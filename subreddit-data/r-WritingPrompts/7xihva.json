            "comment": "\"Hey, are you okay?\"\n\nMaria wiped the tears from her cheeks. She sniffled, looking anywhere but the man standing next to her. She'd gone to the pier to be alone not have random strangers approach her.\n\n\"I-I'm fine,\" Maria looked out toward the ocean, watching as the whitecaps broke and wove over each other, and how the seagulls and birds flew through the stormy grey sky.\n\nThe man leaned against the railing of the pier next to her. \"Well, I hope you don't mind me saying, but you look like your dog just died.\"\n\nMaria sniffed again, her lips curling downward as she gripped the leash in her pocket.\n\n\"I-I did.\"\n\nThere was a pause and the man sighed. \"Shit, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean-\"\n\n\"No, no, it's okay,\" Maria said. \"This was... this was Max's favorite place to go for our walks. He, um, he was a weird dog, but I loved him. I've had him for so long.\"\n\nA handkerchief appeared on the railing and Maria wiped her tear stained cheeks. \"Thank you.\" \n\n\"Sounds like a hell of a dog.\" The man mused.\n\n\"He was,\" Maria nodded. \"He always protected me, heck, he even slept in my bed. He did *not* like my boyfriends.\" She smiled.\n\n\"Sounds like a good boy. Dog's can sense that, you know? If a person is good enough for their person.\"\n\nMaria laughed at that. \"Well, he also ate my Italian heels and destroyed two couches, so he had his ups and downs.\"\n\nThe man snorted. \"Sounds like an ass.\"\n\n\"He was a good boy,\" Maria mused. She cleared her throat and offered the man back his handkerchief. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" the man turned finally and smiled as he took it from her.\n\nMaria paused, her eyes roving over the tanned face and black hair, and the mans eyes. \"You have his eyes.\"\n\nThe man blinked. \"I'm sorry?\"\n\n\"He was a husky mix, he had mismatched eyes.\"\n\nThe man slowly blinked again before he shrugged, an amused smile on his face. \"I've had a lot of people comment on my eyes, but never that I looked like a dog.\"\n\nMaria gasped. \"O-Oh, no, I didn't-\"\n\nThe man laughed. \"Hey, it's okay.\" He offered her his hand. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Maria,\" she blushed as she shook his hand. \"What's yours?\"\n\n\"Maximillion, but Max for short.\" he winked, then spoke in a lower whisper. \"My parents were weird. They named the dog Ted.\"\n\nMaria laughed at that. She flushed when she realized Max had watched her, a warm smile on his face. \n\n\"Hey, I've heard there's supposed to be a coffee shop near here... do you want to go? I'd love to hear more about your Max.\" \n\nMaria nodded. She gave the ocean one last glance before she pulled out the leash from her pocket. Max covered it with his hand, taking her hand with his. \n\n\"Come on, let's get out of the rain.\"\n\nMaria nodded.",

Her champagne flute remained untouched as she searched for the words to say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Jacob, but,\u201d she paused averting her gaze.  \u201cIt\u2019s not you it\u2019s me.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for a long term relationship.  It\u2019s just too much right now.  You\u2019re great, truly.  But I think it\u2019s best if we take a break.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor how long?\u201d he asked, sadness crept into his voice.\n\nShe sighed quietly.  \u201cI\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said rising from the table leaving him alone, head hanging.\n\nHe watched her go, her heels clicking against the black and white tiled floor of the Italian restaurant.  *Well, this version didn\u2019t work either.  Maybe she really wasn\u2019t ready for a long term relationship,* he wondered.\n\n*Or. Maybe she doesn\u2019t realize just how much she needs me.* He dropped a stack of money on the table and slipped into the night.  Heavy rain drops began to fall as he made his way toward Emily\u2019s apartment. \n \nEmily tossed herself down onto her couch and pulled her plush robe around herself.  She clutched the warm cup of tea between her hands and drank deeply.  \n\n*This is what I want,* she smiled.\n\nA quiet scratching turned her head.  *Probably the storm.* She turned the TV to listen to the home decorator explain their choices for the house they had just flipped.\n\nThe scratching came again, more urgently this time.  She set her tea down, her bare feet whispered across the floor as she made her way to the front door.  She had to stand on her toes to see through the small peephole.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hearing things,\u201d she tried to convince herself.  \n\nAnother series of frantic scratching turned her head toward the window.  She grabbed an umbrella and gripped it like a baseball bat.  Lightning flashed outside her apartment, the brilliant light briefly illuminating a small shape on her fire escape.  \n\n*Is that?*\n\nA quiet meow came from the window as a reply to her question.\n\n\u201cYou poor thing!\u201d she cooed as she opened the window and lifted the soaking wet kitten inside.  The cat meowed happily and pressed its head against her plush robe.\n\nEmily dried him off and got a small dish of tuna fish for the cat.  It didn\u2019t have a collar or anything that could help her identify who the cat could possibly belong to.\n\n\u201cWell, I need to call you something. Any ideas?\u201d\n\n*Jacob,* the cat thought to himself and meowed again.\n\n\u201cHow about Hamlet?\u201d\n\nJacob meowed again. *Doesn\u2019t matter to me as long as you love me.*  \n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!

Nervously, avoiding eye contact with the receptionist, I book a room at a guesthouse and try to sleep for a couple of hours but to no avail. I get up shower, put on some jeans. Head to the local bar to wind off.\n\nClouds of smoke, full of loud men. Standing at the threshold, I\u2019m about to leave without getting a drink when she comes up behind me.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, are you getting in?\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nPerfect hair, perfect nose. She smiles uneasily on the first date, eyes darting stealthily towards the door of the French restaurant. On the second date, I channel a German tourist and she is bored by my stories of Berlin nightclubs and beer festivals. On the third - me as a lumberjack from a  neighboring town - this time she seems interested, eyes sliding across my bulging forearms and she even gives me a peck on the cheek but she doesn\u2019t reply my message the next day. On the fourth, she asks me to walk her home, and I\u2019m surprised because I, stammering and clumsy, had taken the form of  a skinny bespectacled bookkeeper, a complete loser, but her interest was at an all time high, giggling and all that, hand resting on my reedy wrist. \n\nShe invites me inside. Small and clean place, curtains drawn tight. I sit on an armchair and try to calm my excitement: it\u2019s a perfect time to show this beautiful woman the truth, before things got too heated, when she was least expecting it. Like so many others before her. \n\nI want her to see the real me. As she busies herself in the kitchen, it takes a second to take my true form: tall and gangly, scarred face: the legacies of many a manicured victim.\n\nI take out the little pocket knife and, approaching the kitchen where she is humming, hide it behind my back.\n\n",

Not in any particular order, but never randomly either; I know what she likes. I've had a long time to figure her out- years and years.\n\nWhen I first arrived in this city, a lonesome, weary traveller, I only hoped to find a home or, at the very least, some semblance of one. The thought of companionship hadn't crossed my mind in ages. When you have lived for as long as I have, after all the trials and failures I've  endured, it was difficult to maintain motivation. \nI was jaded and I was painfully aware of it. I had fallen into thinking that that would be my eternal, repetitious existence- but when my feet touched the concrete and my lungs took in the smog and my eyes rested upon this city, I found something so paradoxically complex and simple it intrigues me to this day- \nI found humanity and everything changed.\n\nHumans are not completely different from the other bastions of civilization I have come across, but they hold a sort of social depth that I had never encountered before. My curiosity was immediately ravenous and seemingly overnight I joined in to the bustling cityscape; Routines, rituals; I made friends and my friends introduced me to coffee. Coffee! What a glorious, glorious thing! Coffee... that's how I met her.\n\nAfter years of assimilating and joyous investigation of humanity I finally felt as though I was home. The centuries of wandering were over for me; I had found everything I was looking for- or so I thought. Then the day came when I decided to go to a new coffee shop. It was right around the corner the whole time since I arrived and I had never been! It's strange how things like that work out, but there I was, standing in line, trying to decide if I would try something new or go with a classic. She was behind the register. I was so preoccupied by what I was going to get I didn't even see her at first.\n\n\"May I have a white chocolate, raspberry mocha with six shots of espresso, please?\", I asked when I stepped up to the counter, my gaze locked on the overhead menu searching for something I might flip-flop to.\n\n\"Wow, that's what I call a pick-me-up,\" she said through a chuckle. \n\n\"Yeah,\" my eyes falling to meet hers; one green, one blue- fascinating, \"I- I really like coffee.\"\n\nShe pushed a streak of blue hair behind her ear joining it with the rest of the ocean on her head, \n\"Who doesn't!?\", She said, beaming a smile that I felt with every nerve ending. \"That will be...\"\n\nI was snared. Everyday after that I returned to that shop every chance I could. There was this inexplicable feeling I had that drove me to learn as much as I could about this anomaly- this woman. She must have been intrigued with me as well because after weeks of interactions at the shop, when I felt there was more to know- things that a patron could not ask from a clerk- I asked if she wanted to spend time together outside- anywhere doing anything- and she agreed! Walks through the park turned into lunches, lunches turned into dinners; before long, we were spending every day together. What started as research turned into bliss.\n\nI had long since buried any feeling such as that and feeling it again made me forget the inevitable truth: all things end. One day, her hair colored changed; what was a calm ocean turned into a volcano of red and orange. The smile I had felt ripple through my body diminished, and then came the note:\n\n\"I'm sorry. Goodbye.\"\n\nI have lost so many times. So many times I've picked up and moved- started over; a new town, a new country, new planet, new galaxy. This was a new situation. I wasn't going to give up- not yet. That's when I decided to change form. I had kept the same appearance the whole time I was in that city- I did it for her, but she didn't want that form. So I changed. Whole new me; whole new chance. I found her again, and again, and again- each new me found her and each new me lost her.\n\nIt's been countless years since I wandered into that coffee shop and I've tried countless versions of myself trying to hold on to this anomalous woman, but to no avail. In the past I would have moved on, but something keeps me in pursuit. Time has never been an issue for a being such as myself, but for her it's not so kind. Each time I change, I align my appearance to match her age, but I know it won't last forever. As long as we can share time, the pursuit is worth it. \n",

            "comment": "\"Raul,\" crooned Raul in a very suspicious French accent, as he took the lady's hand and graced his eager lips on it. \"Let me guess,\" he continued, releasing his grip and pulling a chair out from the table. \"Sit, please. Let me guess, you're a Mari- no, no, you're a Cassandra? I'm right, am I not?\" \n\n*Suave.* Yes, that was what he would be today.\n\nThe woman's botoxed forehead tried its best to frown, her lips fighting (and losing) a similarly uneven battle. \"How on Earth did you know that?\" \n\nRaul slicked his dark hair back with ringed fingers. \"Your beauty, it was that of a Maria, or a Cassandra, and there was a certain radiance that could be of no Maria. I see, no wrinkle has dared to blight your perfect face -- that tells me all I need to know.\" He lowered his voice to a rippling whisper. \"*All I need to know.*\"\n\nCassandra giggled through perfectly still lips as she slid into a seat. \"My,\" she said, \"You are a charmer. And that accent... Australian?\"\n\n\"Australian?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm certain of it. I've got an aunt who lives there, and strike me down if you don't sound *just the same!* Don't worry -- she's a smoker.\"\n\nRaul cursed himself silently. He hadn't done enough research for the role. No, it was fine -- he'd improvise. \n\n\"Yes, mate. Good catch.\"\n\nHe sat in his seat and raised a hand, clicking his fingers to gain the attention of a waiter. \"If I had a bloody boomerang, I'd get us the wine myself,\" he said with a wink.\n\nAnother half chuckle as the waiter approached. Raul knew her very favourite drink, her very favourite food... Yes, this time he'd get the pudding he'd been after for so long. But he had to be confident. She liked confident.\n\n\"Lambrusco, for the lovely Sheila. And the house re- a uh...\"--he swallowed hard--\"Fosters for me.\" \n\nThe waiter lifted his head and eyed Raul snobbishily. \"*House Fosters*, sir?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Raul replied, tugging at his shirt. \"You know, out of the house tap.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir. And to eat?\"\n\n\"Pie and chips for the lady, and... do you do anything off the barbie?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Struth. Just a burger then, mate.\"\n\nThe lady eyed Raul with suspicion. \"I wouldn't normally let someone order for me, but... How did you know I loved pies?\"\n\n\"Know? Oh, that you're a classy pie lass? Well, it's obvious ain't it.\"\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\n\"It is to me. A lady who would wear a fashionable tracksuit like that, to a place like this, well, she'd be after the fanciest meal on the whole bloody menu.\"\n\nIf she could have smiled she would have done, Raul hoped. God, she was beautiful. Beneath all that make up. Maybe. Raul began to sweat. This was the best any of their dates had gone *to date*. He couldn't mess it up now. It was time to lay his heart on the table.\n\n\"Look, Cassandra, I'm gonna' level with you. I think you're mighty fine, and I reckon you think I'm fine. I mean, I figure I'm the sort of guy you'd normally go for.\"\n\nCassandara shrugged. \"Eh.\"\n\n\"Eh? What do you mean, 'eh'\"?\n\n\"You're a little too pretty-boy, for my tastes, to be honest.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious. You can't be bloody serious! I've seen all the men you've rejected. What the hell is left?\"\n\nCassandra went tense. \"You've *seen* the men I've been out with?\"\n\n\"Well I er, oh struth,\" Raul said sadly, knowing he couldn't stop it now. The man's stylish exterior began to wilt, his skin flaking to reveal the green monstrosity beneath. Screams echoed about the restaurant and cutlery migrated high in all directions.\n\n\"Wh-what kind of monster are you?\" asked Cassandra, her lips trying desperately to quiver.\n\n\"Me?\" Raul asked, a rage in the pit of his stomach rising. \"Me?! What the hell kind of monster are *you*? -- That's the real question! I've tried *everything* to please you. I've been Brad bloody Pitt and Oscar bloomin Wilde. Nothing makes you happy. Nothing!\" He realised at this point that he didn't *need* to keep the accent up, but there was something rather bloody pleasing about it.\n\n\"Th-hey were *you*?\"\n\nRaul's skin began to change again, his black hair falling out in thick clumps, while greasy blonde hair sprouted hurriedly in its place. It took only seconds for Cassandra to be face to face with... Cassandra.\n\n\"This,\" said the new Cassandra, as it got up from its seat, \"Is the only person I think you could ever love. You are the worst specimen of any creature I've ever met. And I've been to the Betelgeuse system *and* Scotland. Good day to you!\"\n\nRaul/Cassandra had almost stomped its way to the door, when it heard the plaintive scream from behind and stopped in its tracks.\n\n\"Waiiit!\"\n\nThe other Cassandra came running up to it. \n\n\"What do you want now? Come to mock me one last time?\"\n\n\"Mock? No! I'd never mock someone like you. Mmm mm mmmm, you are *gorgeous*. I think... I think I was a bit hasty. How about one more try?\" she asked with a salacious wink.\n\nRaul/Cassandra  smiled. *Finally*.\n\n\"Can you change *any* part of your body?\" she inquired as they walked back towards their table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Delilah hung up her jacket and took off her shoes. Another dud date. This one was cute. Almost as though he was made to be her type. Tall, dark hair, subtly muscular.  And only one dimple. He checked off all the boxes too. He worked as an EMT, bleeding heart type. He liked classic rock and k-pop. Game of Thrones and Gilmore Girls were his go to TV shows (what were the odds of that one). But when they had kissed at the end of the date it just felt flat. No fireworks. Delilah had been through swaths of men and none of them compared to that first love. The one that got away.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nShe put her curly brown hair into a ponytail and took out her contacts. She sighed after putting on her arm flannel pajamas. She shaved her legs for nothing. Again. How many had she gone through now? Twenty? She had been using online dating most recently. There were a lot of good options, firemen, doctors, professional athletes. But they all felt so fake. Like they were trying to be something they weren\u2019t. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nWhen she had first met Emmet she wasn\u2019t interested at first. She didn\u2019t usually go for small waifs like him. He had freckles like her and not even one dimple. Not to mention his wild red hair. But when they started to speak at a mutual friends\u2019 party it just clicked. She felt like she could speak to him forever. Sure he hated Gilmore Girls and worked as an accountant for a faceless corporation, but he was kind and when he touched her hair. Fireworks. They dated for eight months. And for those months she was truly happy. They would play punch buggy or watch a movie just to make fun of it. They just fit. But one day, Emmet said he couldn\u2019t do it anymore. She never fully understood why he was breaking up with her. He said something about meeting other people and being physically compatible. But she had always been attracted to him. So maybe he just wasn\u2019t into her. No fireworks. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nAs Delilah watched TV she thought of the string of men that had followed. First there was Bruce, the hottie at the gym. She had given him the side eye even when she was with Emmet. He asked her out not even two days after her break up. It was like he knew she was freshly single. At first she said no; she was in too much pain. But a rebound friend with benefits situation did help. For a short while at least. And while he was hot and very good in bed, he felt fake. No fireworks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nShe had dated the doctor for three months. He worked in pediatrics so of course she had to give him a try. But even though she wanted so badly to fall in love him, she soon realized she didn\u2019t. Then there was the cook, the rocker, the one covered in tattoos, the one without any tattoos at all. Sometimes they went on a couple dates, sometimes more. But she had gotten almost good and sliding out of their lives when she realized that spark wasn\u2019t there. Or that she wasn\u2019t over Emmet. Sometimes one of them would bite his lip like Emmet did. Or she would see freckles on his cheeks for just a moment. Or their laugh would get shrill like his always did. Sometimes she felt like she saw him in every one of them. But they weren\u2019t him. So they weren\u2019t good enough. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\nDelilah sighed and looked over to her phone lying next to her on her couch. She wished she still had Emmet\u2019s number, but he had changed it long ago. It was like he had completely disappeared. Maybe she would see him again one day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet shifted back from tall and burly to his natural size as soon as he reached his apartment. This version had not worked either. He thought Delilah liked buff men. And he mentioned every favorite song and TV show he could without raising suspicion. But he could tell from the look in her eyes that she wouldn\u2019t call this one back. What was he doing wrong? He brushed his fingers through his red hair and bit his lip. He would win Delilah\u2019s heart again. But how?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: More added below. Thanks for the encouragement. ;)",

                    "comment": "Emmet ran his hands through his red hair and bit his lip. How was he going to win Delilah\u2019s heart? He went into the small bathroom of his apartment and stared into the blotted mirror. He looked at his beady eyes, his many freckles, his small and slouched stature. This was the body he had been born with, and it was not much to look at. First, he increased his height. This was a go to for Emmet, who naturally stood at five feet seven inches. Increasing height and size came easily to him. It was like controlled swelling more than anything. He had never really tried to go smaller. He didn\u2019t think he could and was terrified of getting stuck that way. Sometimes, a certain feature stuck around too long. A patch of yellow hair that wouldn\u2019t go away. A dimple he couldn\u2019t shake. The first time he had changed his eyes from blue to brown they had stuck for a week. Sunglasses fixed this at work, but it had prevented him from experimenting with skin color. What if he couldn\u2019t easily change it back? People rarely notice eye color, but they definitely noticed skin. He would sometimes do moles since those were off most people\u2019s radars, but even those made him anxious. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter increasing his size, Emmet bleached out his freckles. This was usually one of the first things he did. Then he adjusted the biceps, and played with the facial features. Changing the size of his muscles did nothing to change his strength, but it looked good. As for the face, it really didn\u2019t take much for you to look like a completely different person. A light change in the eye shape, a few degrees difference in the angle of the nose. Emmet liked to play with the fullness of the lips and lashes as well. Men often neglected these, but he had found they did wonders to catch a woman\u2019s eye. The shape of the chin was key as well. Ladies liked sharp and rectangular features.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut he had tried many combinations on Delilah and thus far they had all been failures. Some of his best works hadn\u2019t even gotten one date with her. He needed a different approach. If only he could get some more information about what he had been lacking. Perhaps he could try breaking into her inner circle? But no, he wanted his intel straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. He could try to put on feminine features, but that was another area he was afraid to mess with. Sure, he had practiced making boobs in his teenage years, but any time he went too feminine his emotions started getting out of whack. He had often wondered if he was actually changing his estrogen levels. Best not to mess with it. He wanted to stay male. Besides, that was Delilah\u2019s preferred gender. He had checked.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet went to the computer and began searching for images. He worked best when he had a face to go off of. He found pictures of RuPaul, the Fab Five, and other quintessential queens. He would become the gay best friend; nonthreatening confidant to women everywhere. Okay, that was a bit clich\u00e9. But if it works, who cares?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next week he started going to Delilah\u2019s favorite gym. This was an easy place to find her and strike up a conversation as his new identity. This time he was Blake, a gay man who had just moved into the city to make friends. He had brown hair, trimmed muscles, and dashing green eyes. Delilah loved blue eyes and Emmet couldn\u2019t help himself. It was easy to approach her when he knew he could always try again if he failed. But this time worked like a charm. He had been practicing his \u201cgay lisp\u201d like they did on TV. And he made sure to mention breaking up with an ex-boyfriend to make sure she knew he was only looking for friendship with her. He patiently waited through the initial chit chat of getting to know someone new. Even though it was boring to him, going over where she worked and her dog\u2019s name, he knew skipping this stage would come off as creepy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe waited a full week before asking her out to brunch. He always used a burner phone to message her. They met two more times before he started to ask her more personal questions about her love life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday he was sitting at the caf\u00e9 where they had been having their now weekly brunch.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cTell me again why a pretty little thing like you isn\u2019t taken. I would try to set you up with my friends, but most don\u2019t bat for your team.\u201d He was getting better at the \u201caccent.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDelilah rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, for most of them it just didn\u2019t click. I mean, a lot of hot guys hit on me for some reason. But they all feel so fake, you know?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cGirl, you think they are just trying to get into your pants, don\u2019t you?\u201d He was laying it on a little thick. \u201cWhat about that doctor you mentioned? Sounds like he wanted a real relationship.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cOh, he was nice. Everything I wanted on paper. I felt like I should like him. But when we kissed\u2026\u201d \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u2018Blake\u2019 leaned in, eager to hear more. \u201cYes?\u201d \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDelilah blushed. \u201cIt\u2019s silly.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cGo on. I won\u2019t judge.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe looked up at him, and then suddenly looked down again. A few moments passed before she continued.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cWell, I have this thing I call \u2018fireworks.\u2019 I\u2019ve been searching for it for a long time. It\u2019s like all these good emotions flow through you and the other person. All the guys I\u2019ve dated recently have been nice, but there\u2019s no spark. Maybe I\u2019m comparing them too much to my ex.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet\u2019s ears perked at this. \u201cAn ex, huh?\u201d He was trying desperately to sound nonchalant. Who could it be? Her first boyfriend was in high school. No, she hated him. Sean? He was beefy. No, he can\u2019t ask. \u2018Blake\u2019 wouldn\u2019t know her dating history. He waited for her to continue.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cOh, yeah. I had this ex who I really clicked with. It was like we were on the same wavelength. Now when I go out with other guys, I always compare them to him. Sometimes I almost see him. I mean, that sounds crazy when I say it. But it\u2019s like suddenly I think I see his freckles or the color of his hair. I sound obsessed, huh?\u201d She was blushing, bright pink against her pale skin.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet felt odd. Who was she talking about? Something about what she had said was putting him off. \u201cWhat was his name? If you don\u2019t mind me asking.\u201d He didn\u2019t realize he was no longer doing the gay lisp.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cUm, his name was Emmet. We broke up and I never heard from him again.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet didn\u2019t hear the rest of what she was saying. He felt as though he had detached from his body and was floating in space. The sudden urge to run filled him. He realized his \u2018Blake\u2019 form was starting to slip. It was hard to keep it up when his mind was all over the place. He excused himself to the bathroom.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cYou okay?\u201d Delilah called.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe belted out a yes as he ran to the men\u2019s restroom. Luckily, it was empty. He eased back into his natural features. He was breathing heavily, holding the sink to keep himself standing up. This didn\u2019t make any sense. Delilah didn\u2019t like puny guys like him. Sure they had fun when they were dating, but he saw her checking out other men. Emmet registered something else Delilah had said. She had seen freckles and hair. He had been slipping this whole time and she had noticed. His heart still racing, Emmet realized he needed to go back out and face Delilah again. He took deep breaths to calm himself. Okay. He was going to turn back into Blake and ask her more about what she meant about her ex Emmet. Okay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMuscles and brown hair ready, Emmet returned to the caf\u00e9 table. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d he said, \u201ctoo much coffee.\u201d \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cOh, you looked really worried or something. You sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cFine as red wine.\u201d Do gay people say things like that? Whatever. \u201cSo, you were talking about your ex, what was his name?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cOh yeah. Emmet and I had great times together.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cSure, sure. Um, what did he look like?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cHe had gorgeous red hair, freckles.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cYeah, yeah. Was he a big buff guy?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cUm, no not really. He was a little shorter. But I didn\u2019t are about that. I liked how we felt when we were together. Or, I mean, how I felt. I guess he didn\u2019t like me as much as I liked him.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t you like more buff dudes though?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDelilah sighed. It seemed she was getting tired of being questioned like this. \u201cWell, yeah, all girls like that, right? But I want more than someone who\u2019s good looking. I want someone I love and who loves me.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cYou know, you kind of sound like him.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cI do?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cDo you die your hair?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cUh, no. Why?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cWell, at first I thought it was brown, but now it looks a little red. Did you always have freckles?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe urge to run came back. Concentrate, dammit! But he couldn\u2019t. He was reverting back right in front of her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cEmmet?\u201d\n",

Where was that door? His brain was fried and he couldn\u2019t concentrate. A hand grabbed his wrist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cTalk to me! What is this about?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet knew he couldn\u2019t run. The panic and frustration weld up into tears in his eyes. She must hate him. Now she knew what he was and she hated him. And just when he was making progress.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n**********\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDelilah couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. \u201cCould you always do\u2026 that?\u201d she asked. Emmet nodded. \u201cSo you were Blake the whole time?\u201d Another nod. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cWhy were you asking me about past boyfriends? What is this all about? Why did you break up with me?\u201d There were tears in her eyes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe words came out like waters from a floodgate. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like how I looked, so I tried again looking better, but no matter what I did you didn\u2019t like me, so I wanted to know why and\u2026 and\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cWait, what does \u2018tried again looking better\u2019 mean? Who else have you been?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet mumbled a list of names. They were every past boyfriend Delilah had seen in months. She felt her stomach drop. Was everyone she met Emmet? How could she be so stupid? How did she not notice all this time? At first she felt shocked, then she began to feel anger burn inside her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cHow could you? How could you do this to me? You break my heart, you lie to me, trick me.\u201d Her voice broke into a sob. Emmet sat back down at the table. His eyes looked dark and tired. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d she yelled.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe put his head in his arms. She could barely hear his response as he spoke into the table. \u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you? You, you think I\u2019m a monster.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t like being lied to or being made into a fool, but monster is a little far.\u201d Why was she starting to feel sorry for him? She tried to get her emotions and thoughts in order. She felt very angry and her trust had been broken. But she had cared for him for so long. And all he wanted was for her to like him. He was super insecure, yes. But not a monster, no. He wasn\u2019t trying to hurt her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet lifted his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m a freak? Because of this?\u201d He held up his arm, muscles forming then deflating in an instant. \u201cOr this?\u201d His hair changed from red, to brown, to blond, and back to red again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \u201cSo what? Who cares about that? You lied to me Emmet. You tricked me. You broke. Up. With. Me.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you. You\u2019re just so perfect, and I wanted to be perfect for you. I shouldn\u2019t have lied. I should have just left you alone. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have broken up with me. How am I supposed to trust you now? How am I supposed to know someone new I meet isn\u2019t you?\u201d Delilah was genuinely asking. Where was she supposed to go from here? She twirled a finger in her hair. Most of the anger had dissipated and what was left was sadness. And another strange feeling. A feeling of hope. She had an idea of what to do.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cGive me your phone, Emmet. Your real phone.\u201d He handed her his phone without lifting his head from the table. \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to put a tracker app on your phone, and you have to promise me you\u2019ll keep it on you so I can tell where you are. Okay?\u201d She saw some slight head movement. \u201cEmmet, I need to hear you say it.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet lifted his head, his face covered with tears and mucus. He was always an ugly crier. It was so cute. \u201cI promise I will keep my phone on me so you know where I am,\u201d he said.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cOkay, good. And we\u2019re going to have to take things slow from here, but I\u2019m thinking you\u2019ve learned your lesson.\u201d\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis was obviously not what Emmet expected her to say. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t want to see me again?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe was such an idiot in some ways. \u201cNo Emmet, I want to give you another chance. But I need you to promise me to be yourself. And no more lying! It\u2019s going to take a while for me to trust you again, but I\u2019ll do anything for this.\u201d She kissed his wet lips. He was hesitant, but she could feel him start to lean into it. And the more genuine he was, the more happiness soaked into her very soul. Fireworks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\u201cOne more thing,\u201d she said as they parted. Emmet looked dazed, as he wiped his nose with a napkin on the table. \u201cDoes the shapeshifting thing work on\u2026 like every part of your body?\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEmmet smiled shyly. \u201cUm, yeah.\u201d \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cGood to know, good to know.\u201d Delilah smiled. This was going to be fun.",

            "comment": "Jess could pinpoint exactly when she first thought her feelings were wrong: eighth grade after Advanced Algebra. Her friend Katie got an 82% on a test\u2014 and that was disastrously low for Katie\u2019s norm, and considered even lower by her parents standards.  Jess spent the rest of the class period trying to cheer her friend up:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one test\u2014 it doesn\u2019t define you. You\u2019re amazing and good at everything. You\u2019re kind and pretty, and this is just a small hiccup! I know you\u2019ll ace the next test! I know it! We can study together\u2014 and you\u2019ll probably be saving me from failing, like you normally do.\u201d\n\nWhen Katie smiled back at her, with a red nose, and puffy eyes, Jess knew that she felt something more for her friend.\n\nJess, of course, buried her feelings. By no means was she homophobic, but every time she began to feel something for a friend or looked too long at a woman that walked by, she felt unsure of herself, felt like others would somehow know what she was thinking and judge her. So she buried it down\u2014 at least, until college.\n\nJess decided that she would at least try to get into the dating world. She\u2019d go to parties with her friends, and when guys would be interested in her, she\u2019d flirt back and have some fun\u2014 and she did, in fact, enjoy her time with most of these guys. So she continued to have fun at parties, flirt, have some friends with benefits, but nothing substantial. Jess liked these guys, of course, but nothing felt like the dramatic and raw feeling of love and emotion that she always heard about from her friends. She decided it was time to start seriously dating\u2014 time to find Mr Right, and then she would start to understand how all her friends felt with their boyfriends. They even said it themselves, \u201cYou just haven\u2019t found the right guy, Jess.\u201d\n\nThe first few relationships Jess was in did not last long\u2014 barely even a relationships since they were only a handful of dates and kisses over two or three months before parting ways.\n\nThen she met Matt. He was gorgeous\u2014 all of Jess\u2019s friends said so\u2014 and he was very into her. \n\n\u201cJess, I haven\u2019t been completely honest,\u201d he said one night during a dinner date two months into their relationship.\n\n\u201cUm\u2014 what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first time I met you, it wasn\u2019t at that coffee shop. We were actually at the same college\u2014 we had a lecture together for one semester. I saw you at a couple parties too.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jess said, relieved to find out she wasn\u2019t a side-chick or that his secret wasn\u2019t relationship-ending\u2014 but she realized that, maybe she didn\u2019t really care if their relationship ended anyway. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 okay. I don\u2019t remember seeing you though.\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized that at the shop,\u201d he said smiling a bit sheepishly, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t really talk and I looked a bit different back then.\u201d\n\nJess broke up with Matt three months later. \n\n\u201cHow could you break up with him? He was so hot!\u201d Regina, her roommate and best friend since college, told her.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any spark\u2014 he was kind of a doormat. He had no personality and went with whatever I said.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like the perfect man to me.\u201d Jess threw the couch pillow at her. \u201cOkay, okay\u2014 no man slaves. Hey\u2014 wanna watch a movie tonight?\u201d\n\nAnd Jess never felt more comfortable, more at home, than sharing a blanket with Regina on their couch and watching a crappy movie.\n\nRegina moved out six months later to live with her boyfriend.\n\n\u201cAre you bringing Cam to the engagement party?\u201d Regina asked her half a year later. \u201cMost people Jim and I invited are bring their boyfriends or girlfriends.\u201d\n\nJess had been dating Cameron for five months now, and things were nice. They liked all of the exact same things, worked in similar fields, had the same hobbies\u2014 everyone said they were perfect for each other.\n\n\u201cYeah, he said he\u2019ll come. You said to come for dinner at eight? Is there anything I could bring? Dessert? Wine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know we always appreciate more wine\u2014 but we\u2019ve got plenty already. All you have to do is bring yourself. And Cam.\u201d\n\nJust a few weeks after Regina\u2019s wedding eight months later, Jess broke it off with Cam. The wedding itself was beautiful, and Jess couldn\u2019t bear to make Regina worry by breaking up with Cam before it.\n\n\u201cBut Jess\u2014 I love you\u2014 we love each other! We love all the same foods and places. We even listen to the same music and watch the same shows\u2014 we were perfect for each other this time!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Cam, I don\u2019t want someone who\u2019s the same as me. I don\u2019t want to date myself. I want to date someone that\u2019s different and will push my boundaries\u2014 make me try new things\u2014 maybe I\u2019ll find things that I never even knew I liked before\u2014\u201c \n\nShe thought of all the men she\u2019s dated in the past: they were all the same. They were all Nice Guys that were nice and sweet but had nothing to them\u2014 each relationship was hollow and lacked any true, real substance. How many men had she gone on dates with? 15? 20? And none of them made her feel any different. She longed to feel the feelings she felt for her friends with anyone who wasn\u2019t her friends. Maybe, she thought, maybe she could. She was so tired, she had nothing to lose.\n\n\u201cCam, we\u2019re through. I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s sudden, but I\u2019m tired\u2014 of everything\u2014 I have been for a while now, even before I met you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell... I hope you meet someone one day,\u201d Cam said after a long moment. \u201cMaybe whoever you date next will be the right man for you.\u201d\n\nJess remained quiet as Cam packed up the few things he had in her apartment. She doubted any man would be right for her.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nIt took her two weeks to text Regina and ask her to meet her for drinks on Friday night.\n\n\u201cHey, Jess\u2014 isn\u2019t this a gay bar that we\u2019re going to? I heard it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d she said while they were walking.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014 I wanted to check it out,\u201d Jess said. They walked in silence for a minute before Jess\u2019 nerves got to her. \u201cOk\u2014 wait, stop walking for a sec. I\u2014 I need to tell you. We\u2019re not going to this bar just for fun\u2014 I think I\u2019m bi\u2014 or a lesbian. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2014 okay,\u201d Regina said after a moment. \u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ve known?\u201d\n\n\u201cEighth grade. I told you about Katie from high school right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . Yeah that makes sense,\u201d Regina thought for a moment. \u201cOk you ready to start walking again? It\u2019s cold.\u201d\n\nJess couldn\u2019t be happier, and hanging out at a bar with her best friend, and the flutters in her stomach when other women came up to them to flirt\u2014 it was one of the best nights she\u2019s had in a long time. \n\nAnd that same bar is where she met Taylor three weeks later. There was something about her\u2014 something that made Jess feel like they knew each other for a long time. They liked a lot of the same things, but were different enough that things were still interesting. \n\nThere were some things that were a bit quirky though. Taylor was really bad at shaving her legs\u2014 she would always nick them multiple times every time she shaved. She was also really bad with makeup and couldn\u2019t tell concealer from foundation. She never had any pads or tampons in her apartment either. Jess had never asked her about it, but she hoped nothing traumatic happened to Taylor that would cause her period to stop. Taylor also had a whole ton of men\u2019s clothing in her apartment.\n\nFor all her quirks though, Jess felt better with Taylor than she had with any of the men in her past. ",

            "comment": "Nate had sort of backed himself into a corner. Having been on as many dates with Amaya as he had, the walls were closing in on him. He had to pretend not to know all her answers to common first date questions (2 siblings, parents divorced when she was little, works in accounting), and if he ever misstepped, the game was up. It was a high-wire act that no one was aware of but him.\n\nBut that's what made it fun.\n\nHe was fine with the double life he'd have to lead if it worked, that was nothing new to him. Nate was all things to all people, and it made the minutiae of life constantly entertaining. He realized Amaya had been talking for a few minutes and he hadn't been paying attention to any of it. Now she was looking at him expectantly.\n\nHe took a shot in the dark. \"I work in finance,\" he said. That wasn't a lie, he was actually a financial planner. She nodded amicably. Nate let out an internal sigh of relief, he'd nailed it.\n\n\"Do you come here often?\" Amaya asked.\n\n\"Yeah, I love Spider House,\" Nate replied.\n\n\"Weird, I've never seen you here. This is, like, my favorite place in the world.\" Nate tried not to let a smile sneak out. He always found these kinds of situations really amusing; if he just got out with it, he could turn worlds upside down. He never did, though.\n\n\"Yeah, it's because I'm a shapeshifter,\" he said through a cheeky grin. Amaya laughed. Nate laughed.",

            "comment": "\"I don't know... I just got out of a relationship and need to figure out myself first. I think I'm just looking to be friends right now.\"\n\nThat same line every time. What a pallid lie it was. I kept trying to imitate what I thought she liked and every time it felt like I had gotten closer, but it never stuck. We'd always end up taking this same stupid walk near her house and she'd stop by this same shitty bench and she'd say those same words, give a small hug and disappear into the distance. Ironic, for a man who could be anyone or theoretically do anything to end up in this Groundhog Day-esque scenario over and over.... and over. A few forms ago I got to a fourth date with her and we made out a bit, but she had stopped me and we had gone on this same walk in the end anyways.\n\nI slunk sadly back to my apartment, thinking about the disappointing night. My approach had gotten more refined- tattoos on arms, glasses, a little muscular but slim seemed to be the most consistent- and personality I hadn't gotten down yet either. Currently I was rotating through skin colors and hair texture to see if that made a difference. I don't think it did, really. I would throw something in from a few forms ago every now and then - large biceps and gym rat personality had gotten to a third date, but ended up as broken as all the previous ones. Nothing but those same words and that ridiculous sorry look on her face.\n\nShutting the door once I was inside, I set myself down in my office chair and grabbed my camera, snapping a selfie on the old-fashioned polaroid and began taking notes on the back. I suppose my detailed process had forced the second room in my apartment to look a little bit erratic, sure. But I had to document my progress and notes on what seemed to have an effect and what didn't, I couldn't keep track otherwise. My walls were plastered with polaroids of my different forms, copious information about her and her preferences. I don't like feeling like a creep, but I needed her, and I needed her to need me. \n\nI went to my fridge, grabbed a beer and my newest notebook, and went back to my room to study. I was getting desperate. I kept trying to think of how to get closer, how to figure her out and get her to spill what exactly she was looking for in a romantic partner. I kept looking at my notes covering the walls, trying to figure out what I could do differently.\n\nAnd suddenly I had a thought. Maybe when I was a man I was just too intimidating... she did keep herself more veiled around them. Perhaps if I could approach her- just as a friend- she would come to share more with me over time, and then I could get it right later. I changed forms again.\n\nI knew she had that open art workshop on Thursday nights, so I spent all of Wednesday and late into the night practicing with my new voice to get every nuance down. \n\nWhen I arrived at the class, I could feel my heart beating in my chest. I hoped this would finally be the time she could learn to talk more with me, and hopefully in a few more forms I would have it down and I would finally be perfect for her. \n\nI tried to not look over, to be nonchalant for once. \n\nShe stood there at the entrance with her easel in hand, quietly sipping on her coffee, and wandered over and took the empty seat next to me. \n\nShe greeted me, I tried out my new higher voice and we talked on and off as we worked on our pieces, her asking me questions about myself with vigor. This was working, for once. I'd spend a bit more time getting to know her, then take that information and be the man she always wanted.\n\nBut then I saw a look in her eyes I hadn't seen before. She smiled coyly. \"Wanna grab a drink later?\"\n\nI mean, that did explain a lot, in retrospect. For someone who prided himself on being observant, evidently I missed this one. \n\nAt the bar and several cosmos in, I was losing coherency as she told me story after story I had never heard. The tension between us was palpable... The woman I wanted and knew so much about was melting before me and flirting like never before. She finally suggested we head back somewhere more private... I said my apartment was just around the corner in my drunken stupor, and she dragged me out of there by my arm. \n\nThis was it. I felt myself trembling as we barely sloshed home to my apartment. I kept stumbling. I don't think my alcohol tolerance had caught up to me in my smaller body now.\n\n\"Waitwait\", I barely slurred out once inside my door, \"Leeetme tidy up my bed, njust a second.\"\n\nI threw my clothes, trash and every other unkempt item in the room hastily into my closet, and went back out to get her.\n\nBut she stood further up the hall, at the doorway to my second bedroom, looking inside and frozen in fear.

You can change your face, but not your inability to get your face shaved consistently, or the dumpy clothes you always pick, despite seemingly having any body you want.\n\nYou can change your dick size, but it doesn't matter because you never get me home anyway. You can't change your shitty taste in books, or music, or the shows you watch, or the way you talk about them, the way you believe the things you consume are the person you are.\n\nYou think you can change yourself on the outside and that it will change the way I feel inside, but it never will, because you still can't escape the essential you-ness of you; in fact, it probably prevents you from being able to make those most essential changes. After all, you can be anyone, right? But the problem is, you've only ever understood people for who they appear to be on the outside, and this failure of imagination has lead you to believe that you only are the person you are on the outside.\n\nYou thought I couldn't tell, but I could. The next time I smell dollar-store ramen on the breath of a poorly-dressed Brad Pittish guy who just so happens to share all of my tastes, who knows just the movie to recommend, just the perfect little spot we should try for dinner, I will simply knife him, knife you. And you will die, and transform into the pitiable, shapeless mass your kind always are at heart. And everyone will understand immediately what I've done, and why I've done it, and I will walk out into the sunlight, and feel it on my skin, the way I feel it on my skin every time, the way I can only feel it on my skin, because it's the only skin I've got or will ever have. A feeling you cannot ever know.\n\nI'm serious about stabbing you though.",

            "comment": "There was something about her stare that caught me. It wasn't the green of her irises nor the deep black of her neverending lashes. It was the curvature underneath her eyes every time she smiled, and the glint in her pupils shining like a shooting star in a cold winter night.\n\nI had never witnessed beauty in such purity, not even in my best shapes. See, she had inner beauty. Every gesture of her was a mirror of the warmth in her soul, of its kindness. Something no shapeshifter can't imitate.\n\nI wanted her. And I wouldn't give up no matter the rejections or the many shatters in my heart. Nothing mattered but her. \n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThree years it took me to understand her taste. She liked them shy and handsome, pensive and profound. I remember the day I conquered her for the first time, the nerves I felt crawling across my chest, the shape I took. Everything.\n\nBut it didn't work out. She freaked out when she saw... well let's not talk about what I hide in my basement, it's not there anymore or I should say *they* are not there anymore. We shapeshifters can be quite disgusting to the unknowledgeable.\n\nThe second time was much easier yet the nerves were still there, blooming like a rose in late spring. I got her to dine with me in a fancy restaurant. She wore a dress of intense red, it sculpted her figure tightly... what a masterpiece she was. I, of course, wore another suit: a short man with a chiseled jaw. I pretended to be an engineer but the lie merely got so far. Let's just say that before the desserts, the only thing of intense red in our table was my face with her hand plastered on it.\n\nGoddamned rings. They hurt.\n\nNow, I managed to get a third date. I didn't shapeshift this time, my basement is empty and there are no lies in the table. But there's is a gun in my kitchen. I can't deal with the grief of losing her, I thought I could but I cant.\n\nI knew the risks of a woman like this and I accepted them with no complains. But there's a truth I refused to believe. It was clear from the beginning, bright as the sun... as her eyes.\n\nShe's pure of soul and I'm rotten inside.\n\nWe were never supposed to be.  ",

            "comment": "\"You look *incredible*,\" I said, snapping a picture and handing Dani's phone back. \"No filter necessary. James won't know what hit him.\"\n\nDani nodded absently, her eyes already glazing over as her thumb tapped over the surface of her screen. \"Thanks, Tanya. You said he rides a motorcycle, right?\"\n\nMy heart sank: I had seen this level of disinterest uncountable times in the past few years, and already I could see how the date would go: James would make his dashing arrival on his motorcycle (but wearing a helmet, gloves, and leather jacket; Dani hated recklessness). In the bar (a nice cocktail bar, she liked to be treated but hated to feel pressure) he'd order a bottle of white wine and some stuffed mushrooms, his tongue already tying in knots as he realized she had already found something in him wanting, because no matter how nice Dani tried to be, she was just too easy to read. Or maybe she was only easy to read for me, because I wasn't only Tanya, her best friend, I was going to be James in less than two hours, and I'd been Mark and Jose and Chris in the dates before that, and a war hero fifty years before that, and a merchant sailor two hundred years before that, and on and on, so far that I couldn't even remember my original body, gender, or name. Half the time I wasn't even sure I had been born a human, but every year that passed I became certain that it didn't matter: the immortality and the shapeshifting had changed me so much that I certainly wouldn't die as one.\n\nBut Dani had changed all that. Ever since I, in the form of Tanya, had first met her at school, while pursuing my thirty-fourth degree, I'd found myself feeling alive again. I'd been with brilliant women, with beautiful women, with talented women, with powerful women, but never a woman as kind and compassionate as Dani. For the first time in centuries I'd begun using my powers for good again, instead of just slipping through existence as unobtrusively as possible. We'd become friends, we'd become roommates, and for a while that had been enough. But not anymore.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, I said, \"Please, give him a chance, Dani. You're so cautious. Just live a little! Go with your gut! What if he's the one?\"\n\nDani smiled. \"I hope you didn't tell him I could be 'the one'. It's fun to get out in the city and meet new people but...I don't think I'm in a good place for a boyfriend.\"\n\n\"That's what you've said for years,\" I said. Dani had been dating a real asshole when I first met her, a prick who'd been with her since high school. Even though she hadn't seemed really traumatized by the breakup, she hadn't dated since. \"You're young! You've got a good job, you're living in a beautiful city! I've set you up with some really amazing people!\"\n\nDani laughed. \"Maybe you've done too good a job, Tanya. If the next guy wasn't going to be so cool, maybe I could settle for the one I was with.\"\n\nI shouldn't have snapped, but I hated it when she deflected. \"I just want you to be happy, and have someone! You're not going to have this opportunity forever.\" I said it more bitterly than I meant, because I knew I was wrong: as long as Dani lived, she would have someone trying to be with her.\n\nDani's back stiffened. \"Well, maybe you should date some of these awesome guys yourself, then, so you don't end up like me.\"\n\nI couldn't hold back a smirk at that imagery. \"Come on, Dani--\"\n\nBut the smirk had only pissed her off more. \"You know what, Tanya? Don't bother anymore. You can have them all to yourself. Just don't set me up with anyone again.\"\n\n\"But--d\" I was stunned. I'd never seen such a rapid transformation in her before. This wasn't just about what I'd said, there was something else going on with her. And I knew it would be stupid to try and ask her as Tanya. I'd have to ask her as -- \"James?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry, I won't stand him up.\" Dani grabbed her purse. \"I'm not *that* much of a bitch. I would tell you not to stay up but I don't think I'll be that late.\"\n\n*\n\nAs James, I shut off my motorcycle and looked over the sidewalk, my eyes meeting Dani's and then looking away again, as if I wasn't entirely convinced it was her. I had a right to that thought; she'd undergone almost as big a transformation as I had, all her anger with Tanya gone from her face.\n\nI needed time to build up trust, to find out what was actually going on with her, so I played it safe, smiling widely as I wrapped an arm around her shoulder (Dani found full-frontal hugs too intimate for a first meeting but thought a handshake too formal; thus, I always went for the three-second side-hug.) We made idle small talk as we placed our order, and I waited for any expression, any word that might clue me in to what she was actually feeling.\n\n\"So how'd you meet Tanya?\" she asked after the waitress had dropped off our bottle of Chardonnay. \"She never tells me how she meets people.\"\n\nHer voice barely tightened around the name *Tanya*, but I could see that she was still angry. My stomach twisted. What if, in trying to make her fall in love with me, I wound up losing her friendship as well? \"At a club down east,\" I said. \"She's pretty fun. You've been friends for a while, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Since college.\" Dani lifted her glass and swirled it, but didn't drink.\n\n\"I can tell she cares a lot about you,\" I said. \"You wouldn't believe all the questions she asked making sure I was good enough for you.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Dani sighed. \"She's got *great* taste.\" Then, realizing what she'd said, \"I'm sorry. You seem really great. She's just...clueless.\"\n\nThe sarcasm was so obvious that I couldn't let it go. \"Are you guys OK?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Dani sounded so defeated that my stomach twisted again. Tanya was the shape and attitude in which I felt most comfortable. I liked to think that she was pretty similar to who I'd been originally; it was so easy for me to be her that the thought of Dani not being friends with her anymore was almost a worse rejection than the scores I'd experienced as the dates.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Dani said again. \"We're OK. Just, OK. I guess that's got to be good enough. Look, I...this isn't going to go anywhere, OK? I think I owe it to you to tell you that as soon as I can.\"\n\nI said, \"Yeah. I figured.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I just...\" Putting her glass down, she twisted her hands around her napkin. \"...I think I go on all these dates because each time I hope maybe something magical will happen, and I can get over all the other bullshit but...that won't happen. I just have to accept both sides of the coin. I'm not going to get over it, and Tanya, she...she isn't ever going to feel the same.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped. \"*Tanya*?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yeah. Sometimes I think there's something there, but she just keeps sending me on dates with everyone else in the world. I get so angry, but it's not her fault; she just wants me to be....\"\n\nShe was so caught up in her napkin that she didn't notice me transforming until the sentence was almost done. James fell away. Tanya resurfaced. Dani's eyes widened. \"...happy,\" she whispered.\n\nI said, \"I'm sorry. I...I'm an idiot.\"\n\nDani's mouth opened and closed several times. She reached for her glass of wine and found the bottle instead, but still almost drained it. Then she took a deep breath.\n\n\"Do you want to go back home?\" she asked.",

For him, it had been barely a day since her funeral and that of his sons. He\u2019d failed again. He never got used to it. No matter how many times.  \n\nThey were fated lovers that neither time nor death could separate and yet doomed to their own version of hell - he in his endless struggle to rewrite the ending that started it all and she in her blissful ignorance of their woven destiny. \n\nIf only she could remember him. If she could remember the lifetimes they\u2019d spent, the countless sleepless nights entwined beneath the stars dreaming of growing old together. And the children they shared - would share, again. \n\nHe remembered them, too. They were his personal burden, memories and pain that only he knew existed. He bore it willingly, no matter the grief that inevitably fell to him alone to bear. \n\nHe glanced at his watch, the time was about right. He needed to get back to the machine. The machine that was both a curse and a blessing. He would make it work this time. He\u2019d try something else.\n\nHe hailed a cab outside the restaurant. As he rode through the rain swept streets of the city he silently hoped the next jump would bring him to someone a bit more to her liking. \n\nA short while later he was back in his lab. The machine sat before him, humming in its usual patient manner. With a quick motion he adjusted the knobs, as he had done so many times before, and gripped the conductive rods to either side. \n\nThe humming grew in intensity. The building around him began to shake. He grimaced as electricity coursed through his body. He squeezed his eyes shut as he held on to the machine with all his might. \n\nHis last thoughts before the pain overwhelmed him was of her. He would start again. And this time would be the last. \n\n",

There was no trace of a smile or any sign of guilt. There never was. This time, she had obviously rehearsed her words. *How do I let him down gently?* I bet that's what she was thinking. She was always so gentle. I sighed.\n\n\"It's okay. I figured when you stopped answering my phone calls it was through. Can you tell me what I did wrong?\" Anything she would give me, perhaps it would help. Amanda tapped her fingers against the restaurant's table. A sign she was nervous. \n\n\"Nothing... you were perfect. Just. I don't know, Alex, what do you want me to say?\" She placed both hands down on the table, apologized once more, and stood to leave. I had already tuned out her words, and had begun to stare at the eyelash she had let fall onto her cheek. \nAs she left, her silver hair dancing behind her. She needed to re-dye it, it had started to fade.  *This one was no good too?* I thought I had become everything she wanted to be this time. Impossible not to admire, I watched and wanted everything about her. Her faded silver hair, the freckles on her shoulder, the eyelash on her cheek. The coal eyes asking me for more, even though I had never seen those. One day she would want me, love me, *revere* me, just as I did her. *I just had to try again.*\n\nThis time my name was Alex.

I was the perfect gentleman. All of my choices and decisions... she agreed with all of them.\n\nFor her, I was perfect, so what did I have to change this time? She couldn't even tell me.

His teeth were the right shade of white and the corners of his mouth were symmetrical, but he still wasn\u2019t getting perfectly natural-looking wrinkles around his eyes. As he held the smile in place, he rubbed two more wrinkles onto the skin at the corners of each eye. He tried again. Still not quite right. \n\nHe walked over to his computer, opened a new tab, and tried a modified search: \u201cMost Natural looking eyes in Hollywood.\u201d The results were surprisingly divergent from the \u201cBest looking eyes in Hollywood.\u201d He studied the image of Zac Efron. The curves of Zac\u2019s eye wrinkles were more elongated than Adam had previously noticed. He walked back to the bathroom mirror and tried stretching out his own wrinkles. Sure enough, the result was more satisfying.\n\nAs Adam beamed his smile, that creeping, persistent thought came to him once again, \u201cYour looks are not the problem. YOU ARE!\u201d. He pushed against it, reassuring himself as he gazed at his own beautiful face. \u201cYou are beautiful. You are gorgeous. You are flawless. You\u2019re smart, funny, and creative. Not to mention rich. Any woman would be lucky to have you.\u201d\n\nThis would surely be the version of himself that Danica would love. His facial skin was just the right color, a subtle golden-bronze, and texture, soft and supple, to balance his muscular features. His reddish-brown hair was long and lustrous, but pulled back into a reserved man-bun. He was 6\u20193\u201d. Tall, but not so tall that there would be an awkward difference in heights. His smile was tuned. His walk was calibrated. Even the creases of his muscular arms were shaped to Danica\u2019s body, made for her personal comfort. \n\nYet his mind persisted in its assault, \u201cA real man wouldn\u2019t need to look like this.\u201d\n\nHe pushed the thought out of his mind again. He wasn\u2019t just real, he was great. Who was as clever? Who as athletic? Who as sweet? Who loved with the kind of passion that he loved?\n\n\u201cYou are the greatest,\u201d he whispered to his reflection. \u201cThis will be the night. I am sure of it.\u201d ",

Thank you\" She said with a sparkle in her limpid blue eyes that Leon had never seen in anyone else before. Maybe it was that, that drew him to her. She seemed unremarkable in nearly every other way, but in a way that seemed deliberate. As if she was trying to hide something amazing about herself from the outside world.\n\n\"I'm Andrew\" said Dante extending his hand with the palm facing a little more upward than someone who would be shaking the hand of a person they just met.

With no small amount of luck, or tremendous amount of luck if any of his past attempts were any indication, he'd hold her hand every day. \"Isabel\" she responded.\n\nIt was a dance he'd done countless times before and he knew each step of each beat. He was a virtuoso at this point. After days upon weeks upon months of practice, he could do it from muscle memory. Asking the right questions, peaking the right interests, but not so much as to seem too good to be true or come off as a stalker who was just sizing up his next victim. \"Are you thirsty? It's been a long day for me and I'm going to stop for a coffee. Would you care to join me?\" With a bit of a snicker she replied \"No thank you, I need to be on my way. I've got a few projects I need to get the ball rolling on.\" The glisten he saw in her eyes, like a lens flare in a movie made the hair on his neck stand. \"Oh.. well.. It was nice talking to you Isabel. Sorry about earlier again.\" \"Oh don't worry about it, have a nice day\" she giggled and went on her way.\n\nDefeated he walked into the coffee shop, so as to not seem as if it was all a wholly concocted scheme. \"Fuck me!\" Duke thought to himself. \"I look like everything she likes in a guy! I share all her interests! I know practically everything about her! What more do I have to do!?\"\n\n\"Maybe try being honest, and stop trying so hard Harvey Birdman.

There on the other side of the road stood Isabel with a twinkle in her eye and a smile that went from ear to ear.\n\n\"I'll see you next time, Luigi\" she laughed. It was as if he could feel her breath on his ear. He watched in astonishment as she walked, unremarkably down the street, with her files in one hand and an ipod in the other.\n\nNathan smiled.",

The plastic and cloth seat beneath him had finally warmed and become comfortable, as the seat next to him felt cold, its occupant having just left.  Her navy peacoat flailed slightly as she buttoned the double breasts and walked down the four steps off the bus leading to the curb.\n\nThe doors closed, and the seat beside Roger became colder.  The navy peacoat drifted out of sight.  He loosened his tie, rubbed his hands on his pants, and let his mind slip into a deep, empty, trance.  What had transpired minutes before was painful, and a wound this fresh cannot be ignored, moved past, or relived without more pain.\n\nThe woman he loved, the woman he had spent the past five years of his life trying to re-connect with, had just walked out on him for the sixth time.  Each instance of \"Roger\" had failed to capture her interest for more than a year, and almost all had failed before the first date.\n\nThis wound was deeper than all previous ones, and would likely not heal.  Yes, this would be Roger's last attempt, as the woman he loved and who had once loved him had grown and changed so much that he felt he no longer knew her.  The first incantations of Roger were not quite what he could consider to be \"Roger\", but what he considered to be better versions.  Better hair.  Better Muscles.  Better smile.  But alas, each version became more and more like the real Roger, and each one coming that much closer than its predecessor to connecting with her. \n Roger in his current form was the real \"Roger\" in almost every way, and is what made this wound so deep.\n\n\"This will be the last time I try,\" he decides.  \"I must accept that my widowed wife no longer loves me.\"",

It took 10 dates before I discovered it about her, 12 dates before I found her love of sushi and 19 dates until I was confident that I could put together her perfect date. \n\n\u201cMy favourite! How did you know?\u201d Belinda said as she crossed her long legs towards me. She looked particularly good tonight. She picked the perfect date to be wearing my favourite short red dress. There is something about her smile that makes me melt, a familiar, comforting feeling.\n\u201cIt's your favourite? No, its my favourite!\u201d I replied, feeling only a little disgusted with how cutsie I was being. \n\nSo far so good. This plan was going to work, I just need stay cool and follow the plan.\n\nI was confident this date was going to be the one. Tonight I shape shifted into what I have learned is her ideal man. I am tall, much taller than last time, with long blonde hair tied up in to a man bun and piercingly blue eyes. It certainly wasn\u2019t my first choice of shape but I\u2019m not holding it against her.\n\nThe waiter returned to the bar with our drinks. It was time to bust out my next move. I opened my wallet and a loyalty card for the local yoga studio \u2018accidentally\u2019 flew out on to the table.\n\n\u201cOops, I mustn't have put my card back when I finished my yoga session earlier\u201d, I faked an embarrassed look and quickly returned the card in my wallet.\n\n\u201cI. Love. Yoga. I have been doing it for the last 15 years. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re into that.\u201d She said before taking a long sip from her mojito.\n\nI do my best to suppress a smirk. \u201cI know, this never happens\u201d.\n\nI am going to have to get used to this body i\u2019m in, especially since now we are going to get married and have 10 children. Probably move out to the country and get a big property with horses.\n\nOK, I can\u2019t overdo it now. Take it easy, just enjoy her company.\n\nBelinda looks up and cocks her head toward the speakers.\n\n\u201cSweet child o\u2019 mine, I love this song!\u201d\n\nFunny, my ex-girlfriend was crazy about Guns \u2018n Roses, Belinda is a jazz nerd.\n\n\u201cOh, I thought you were more of a jazz girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cuh, yeah, I am. Absolutely. This is a guilty pleasure of mine that\u2019s all.\u201d She finishes her mojito in one slurp and lets out a satisfied \u2018ah\u2019 sound. That\u2019s another familiar sound.\n\nAlarm bells are going off in my head. \n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your favourite movie?\u201d I ask, watching her carefully for the response.\n\nWithout hesitation she blurts out, \u201cThe Burbs\u201d.\n\nMy stomach sinks.\n\n\u201cTrista?\u201d, I whisper. Hoping to be wrong.\n\nShe looks down at her feet and lets out a sigh.\n\n\u201cTrista, you can\u2019t shapeshift to get back in my life. We broke up 5 years ago, its time to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2026\u2026.I know we are meant to be together. Don\u2019t worry,  Belinda didn\u2019t know about this date before I shifted in to her form. You can still set up your perfect date with her. Or\u2026..\u201d\n\n\u201cOr?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to shift out of this body right away\u201d, she winks seductively at me.\n\nI jump out of my chair and get ready to storm out. I can\u2019t believe she did this to me, it's so dishonest, so stalky. Look at her sitting there in that red dress. Long perfect legs. She looks up at me with that smile that has melted me 19 times before. Well...maybe....\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get us a cab\u201d\n",

Trisk. Woohoo.\" He waved a hand in front of her face. \"Piers to Trisk.\"\n\nHer thoughts snapped back to the tavern and she shook her head. \"Oh. Huh? Oh.\" Her bright blue eyes met his and she half-smiled in apology. \"Sorry. I was thinking about that date I had last night.\"\n\nHis heart thudded in his chest and it took all the effort he had not to look over-eager. \"You had a date last night?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Remember when the guild sent me on that mission a week ago? I met this brawny barbarian on the road and he helped me fight off the manticore.\"\n\n\"The one you killed?\"\n\nShe grumbled and then admitted, \"Well truly he did most of the fighting. I just got the deathblow. He let me keep the head for the bounty.\"\n\nPiers felt pride swell. \"Nice guy.\"\n\nShe frowned and his pride fizzled out. \"No. Not a nice guy. There was something really *off* about him.\"\n\nPiers swallowed before he carefully asked, \"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"He was just too *barbarian*. It was weird. I mean. A fortnight ago I was on a date with that bard who was so simpering y'know. Like he wouldn't stop spouting off terrible lyrics to me and tried to hold my hand all day. His palms were sweaty.\"\n\nPiers grumbled. \"He did bring you your favourite flowers.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but so many bouquets of flowers. Like, isn't that strange for a first date? My house smelled of elquids for days and then they all died and it was like death in there. I still can smell the rot.\"\n\n\"Weren't you complaining to me that you didn't meet anyone sensitive? Artsy?\" He gritted his teeth, trying not to show how frustrated he was.\n\n\"Sure, but that was ridiculous. Then the barbarian. What was that?\" She lifted her hands up in the air which also happened to summon the barkeep to look up with the face of attentive barkeeps everywhere that said *More?* so Piers waved his hand and shook his head.\n\n\"Well, you did complain about the bard. You said you wanted someone more macho. Wasn't he macho enough for you?\"\n\nShe chewed on her lip. She did that when she was thinking. He knew that about her. He knew everything about her. That's what made this whole thing so frustrating.\n\n\"Yeah. And then almost a week to the day I meet the barbarian just happenstance to be on the road when I'm out questing and he was so -- just over the top. He grunted and threw things and he flexed. A lot. He wore a loincloth on our date. A loincloth. It was embarrassing.\"\n\nPiers was losing his patience just a little bit. \"So you're anti-barbarian.\"\n\nShe huffed and she tapped her fingers on the table. \"I am not anti-barbarian. He was just so -- extra. Y'know? Like a farce of a barbarian. That's not what I want.\"\n\nExasperated, Piers said, \"Well what *do* you want? You said you wanted someone smart and so that week you met the scholar.\"\n\nShe groaned in annoyance. \"Don't remind me. He read all the same scrolls I did and he went on and on about things that I like. It was so boring. Like I had that conversation a million times before. I have met stone walls more interesting than him.\"\n\n\"Then you said you wanted a bad boy and when you got that --\"\n\nShe cut him off. \"--Don't even. He wasn't a bad boy. He was like some kind of weird trussed up dark elf gothic vampire wannabe who happened to be saving up to get a wyvern. The *same* wyvern that I'm saving up to get. Of course.\" She rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Then what will make you happy Trisk?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I guess I'll know when I see him.\" She sighed and stared back into her tankard.\n\nHe wanted to shout to her *When you see me! Why don't you see me?* but didn't because he couldn't because she had always been the little sister of his best friend. A best friend that had rules about friends and sisters and would be betrayed if Piers crossed that line.\n\nSo Piers crossed a line that neither of them knew he could. Every week. Hoping that one day he could get it right.",

            "comment": "\u201cDamn it! Why can I never get this right?!\u201d Said Stu. He knew that this girl was the one for him. The moment he had set eyes on her while watching that concert over 5 years ago, he knew she was the one. He just felt it. From her slender body to the way her hair fell on her shoulders. He had googled her right after the concert finished and he fell more in love with her ever since.\n\nBeing a shapeshifter and all, he decided to make himself into a musician. At first he made himself into the lead musician in her quartet, but he obviously didn\u2019t think that one through very well. Things started out great in the beginning because he would just walk in and everyone would recognize him. Even she would start making googly eyes at him. He thought he had hit the home run. But unfortunately, during the first practice, he totally botched up the entire piece, and he could only feign being sick for so long! So, even though he had knocked out the original guy, he had to revive him and bring him back so that he could play the piece.\n\nOf course he lost the girl for a little while because, well, she fell in love with the real guy, but she couldn\u2019t understand why his mood was so drastically different than before and they eventually broke up.\n\nNext, he tried to be her sister\u2019s best friend who was a guy, and he tried to find out from the sister what her type was! It was a little strange at first, because he didn\u2019t know that the sister was into her best friend, so he ended up going out with the sister for a while but he knew that she wasn\u2019t the one for him even though it was actually a really good relationship!\n\nHe finally broke it off, and then went and shapeshifter into the \u201cperfect\u201d guy for his first love. Though it was a little like Deja Vu because things started out great! She seemed really into him, but then before he could ask her out on a date, she ended up blowing him off and not showing up to dinner one night.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t understand it. So he tried a different approach. Let\u2019s just cut it short here and jump ahead and save you the sob stories. To sum it up , he\u2019s tried it 32 times. Who knew that a girl could date that many times?! Each of the subsequent recent times had been shorter and shorter, with her saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it seems like I just went through this!\u201d\n\nMaybe she was catching on and maybe he should have given up. But he was determined to try one last time.\n\nHe finally found her journal and discovered that she had a picture of what she considered her \u201csoul mate\u201d though it looked like the picture was pasted backward so he couldn\u2019t actually see the photo. But luckily all he had to do was just touch the back of the photo and he could shapeshift into the person on that photo.\n\nSo after stealing her journal in the green room at the back of the concert hall, he snuck into a closet, opened the book and touched the photo and then emerged. He felt a little funny and he walked a little strangely, but when he came out of the closet, his chest was a little bigger and he was missing a piece of equipment down in the nether regions.\n\nHe paused in front of a mirror and knew why she had never been into him. Staring back at him, was the figure of a girl.",

            "comment": "\"How're things going with Magic Mike, then?\"\n \nKate feigned a smile over a glass of Shiraz. \"It's been tough this last week or so. He's not making it easy.\"\n \nShe supped the wine while Candice feigned a grimace. It was part of their weekly ritual: every Thursday after work, the Oak Cellar, two glasses of the good stuff to herald in the weekend. It wasn't always Kate moaning about men, but Candice was a good listener. \"I think he's rebounding. He seems to talk about this ex of his all the time.\"\n \n\"Oh dear,\" Candice frowned, the corners of her eyes creasing sympathetically. \"Not another one!\"\n  \n\"Yep, though unlike Frankie he doesn't look to me for sympathy,\" Kate sighed. \"And this guy's ex isn't Powered. Small mercies, eh?\"\n  \n\"But you've been seeing Mike for three months, right?\"\n \n\"Nine weeks yesterday.\"\n \n\"So you're trying to make a run of it?\" Candice smiled. \"My husband and I struggled for the first three years. We broke up once. But that time apart made me appreciate how we were stronger together.\"\n \nKate grimaced, sipping the Shiraz as Candice went into her spiel. The two had only met nine months ago, shortly after Kate's horrendous picnic date with Ollie: Candice took a temp vacancy in the typing pool, and their compatible senses of humour took care of the rest. However, she did like to go on her sandbox every so often. Politics, music, Powered rights, the HR team, and men. Kate liked listening but sometimes it was too much. She didn't like feeling like that.\n \n\"Let me interrupt,\" Katie said, raising her hand. \"Are you about to bring up Jack?\"\n \nCandice scoffed. \"Mind if I state the obvious? You're not quite over that guy.\"\n \n\"He was before your time. You never met him.\"\n \n\"And yet you still seem to measure all these new guys against him.\"\n \n\"I want to move on, Candice,\" Kate said simply. \"That was a year of my life I lost to him. I can't return back there.\"\n \nCandice wasn't smiling any more. \"You keep seeing guys that remind you of him. What draws you to them?\"\n \n\"No idea,\" Kate said airily. \"Maybe it's me.\" \n \n\"Maybe it's bad luck,\" Candice said, presenting a strained smile. \"Remember that picnic date with that one guy?\"\n \n\"Ollie? He was sweet.\"\n \n\"Except his dress sense reminded you of Jack?\"\n \n\"He wore a shirt identical to one I got Jack for his birthday,\" Kate flinched. \"But it wasn't that. There were two Powereds having an argument not too far away. The Elemental woman kept on drawing down lightning, so we had to get to safety. But that wasn't before the hallucinations.\"\n \n\"She was fighting a Sensory Manipulator?\"\n \nKate sighed. \"See, this is the thing. When they subsided, Ollie was a little *too* calm. That was the unsettling thing. He said later he had Powereds in his family, but it sounded fake.\"\n \n\"You think he was Powered himself?\"\n \n\"It crossed my mind later. I couldn't take that risk, not after a certain *other* Illusionist. No offence, Candice.\"\n \n\"None taken.\" Kate had remembered Candice disclosing her eighteen month-old niece tested positive for the mutation. She tried not being prejudiced, but having experienced Jack and his manipulations, she didn't want to experience it again.\n \nCandice smiled, in her stilted way. \"My brother's making his peace with it. We're not sure what she'll be.\"\n \n\"She'll be your niece,\" Kate said simply. \"They're still people, but we treat them differently. One thing I remember about Jack... he didn't have a normal childhood.\"\n \nCandice paused in reflection. \"Did he love you?\"\n \n\"Jack only loved himself.\"\n \n\"Maybe he didn't know any different.\"\n \n\"Not my problem any more,\" Kate sighed. \"Maybe I'll give Mike some slack. He's doing his best.\"\n \n\"Good girl,\" Candice grinned, before pointing at Kate's near-empty glass. \"One more?\"\n \n\"No, I'd best get my train,\" Kate said. \"I want to get on top of my laundry before Mike comes round for the weekend.\"\n \nKate smiled and made some idle chatter as she pulled on her coat. It was normal for her to leave a little earlier than Candice, who was within taxi distance from the Oak Cellar. An informal agreement to meet again next week, same place. Kate pulled her coat together and embraced the rain.\n \n***\n \nCandice slowly drank her Malbec and watched the rain trickle down. These conversations gave her plenty to think about. A waiter came over, as she idly scratched her swelling beard.\n \n\"Anything else for you, sir?\"\n \n\"No, thank you,\" Jack said, letting his illusion subside. \"I have to settle my tab.\"",

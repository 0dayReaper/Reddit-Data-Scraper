    "postText": "**Reassignment**\n\nLeslie felt tired. He assumed he was supposed to, since this was the way he (and everyone else in his class) had always felt. As he awaited his turn to be called to the front of the stadium\u2014to be branded with a new job, new housing arrangement, possibly a new spouse and pet dog named Sophie\u2014he wondered what his new life would look like. Would he grow old as a construction worker, perhaps? Or an office manager, whatever vague responsibilities that entailed? Maybe a simple cashier at a grocery store, because in spite of new technologies, people still had to eat, and robots were no good at helping the elderly pack their vehicles with groceries.\n\nA quiet groan escaped him. He felt even more tired now. He entertained an unexpected thought: *Is this all my life is now? Is this all I can look forward to? A job?*\n\nHis name was called. Not his real name of Leslie Farringer Hill\u2014a confluence of his father Leslie\u2019s name as well as that of his great grandfather Farringer\u2014but his Assigned Name of 2099356. Leslie climbed onto a stage in the middle of an arena, where a line of stoic elders grasped their wrists and stared at him with grim indifference. Leslie sat beside dozens of civilians like himself, who sat before the Automated Work Reassignment bot, waiting for their assignments.\n\nLeslie placed his forehead against wide screen and allowed the machine to dig a thin needle into his cerebral cortex. The pain was minimal, surprisingly\u2014like the pinch you get when you pierce your ears. When it was done, Leslie and his classmates left the stage, and the elders announced, \u201cNext!\u201d\n\nNo applause. No congratulations. Just \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s grandfather said that Reassignment used to be exciting. People were given the option\u2014key word, \u201coption\u201d\u2014to change jobs if they were unhappy, medically disabled, or better suited to another field. A good many of them got to choose their own jobs\u2014a foreign concept to Leslie\u2019s class of 2118. But then, the option to \u201cchoose\u201d meant that jobs were in abundance, which had not been the case in half a century.\n\nWhen the first version of the Primary Automation Network\u2014or PAN\u2014was released, there was high demand for workers needing to maintain the program\u2019s vast webbing of databases, neural connections and information flow. Then the tech got smarter, and work done by human hands became outdated; PAN began functioning on its own, running its own updates and anticipating its own needs.\n\nThe human population, however, continued to rise, while jobs declined. Nowadays, you got what you got. You didn\u2019t argue or complain. If you did, you\u2019d starve\u2014and they\u2019d let you.\n\n\u201cHey, Les, what\u2019d they stick you with?\u201d Travis Dollman asked. Leslie noticed the shifting of his eyes back and forth as he gazed into his Internal Personalized Interface, which accessed the ever-growing layers of PAN.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know yet,\u201d Leslie replied. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to find out, either; he would have to live with his fate for the rest of his life. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cReading the job description right now,\u201d Travis said. He sounded distant, lost in the world of PAN. \u201cLooks like\u2026 Oh, hey! Not bad! Chief Agriculture Overseer for the\u2026 Ah, shit, in the Swamps. Oh well, it\u2019s good pay. Wife Meredith, Doberman Pixie, son named Liam. And triple supply of rations on a private acre. Not bad.\u201d\n\nTravis blinked, tuning out of his IPI. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna look at yours?\u201d\n\nLeslie shrugged. \u201cLater. I\u2019m tired. Had to do a double-shift last night, didn\u2019t sleep much. I think I\u2019ll go crash at the apartment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, at least look and see if you still *have* an apartment first.\u201d He grinned slyly, like he was telling a good joke that Leslie would never get. \u201cWho knows? Maybe you landed a gig with Infinitum. They get crazy-good benefits.\u201d\n\nLeslie returned a shy smile. \u201cDoubt it, but\u2026 Maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nLeslie pulled up his IPI and dove into PAN\u2019s universe. His system calibrated updates in seconds, a nice blinking clock telling him that it was 59 percent complete\u2026 73 percent\u2026 95 percent\u2026\n\nWhen it finished, a welcome letter greeted him. It read:\n\nCongratulations on your Reassignment, 2099356! You have been reassigned to occupation:\n\nSERIAL KILLER\n\nThat didn\u2019t sound right. It sounded like\u2026 well, not anything that Leslie had heard of, actually. The only thing familiar to him was the word \u201ckill,\u201d which was spoken when something electronic sparked in his office and the Electrical Technicians had to \u201ckill\u201d the connection. He supposed it could also pertain to when the elderly had reached their time of Passage, when they grew too old to perform their jobs appropriately and were euthanized; it was sometimes morbidly referred to as the \u201ctime of killing,\u201d a phrase Leslie and the general population repulsed.\n\nBut \u201cserial killer\u201d was something new to him. Below his title, an icon of a file folder blinked deep red at him, indicating the position was high level and top secret. Which meant upper echelon access into the depths of PAN, which very few civilians knew about, let alone explored.\n\nBelow that was a list of his benefits package: Fully-furnished housing on a five-acre plot (an ungodly amount of living space in today\u2019s economy), wife Blaise Parkham, a gray Persian named Mufasa, and five times the normal ration supply delivered weekly to his doorstep.\n\n*Holy shit,* Leslie thought. He blinked and closed his IPI.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Travis asked impatiently.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 Something in agriculture, too.\u201d\n\nTravis squinted at him. *\u201cSomething in agriculture?* What the hell does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I dunno. It\u2019s a lot to read and I\u2019m too tired. I\u2019ll, uh\u2026 talk to you about it later. Need to rest.\u201d\n\nLeslie nearly ran out of the building. He felt Travis\u2019s suspicious gaze on him, but he brushed it off. He felt uneasy, his adrenaline pumping faster than he was used to. If he was going to live in high-class, he needed to figure out what his job entailed, and he couldn\u2019t concentrate with Travis\u2019s never-ending monologue in his ear.\n\nLeslie walked down the street, passing beneath the mousetraps of tram cars that ran noisily all day and night. Directly outside of Town Hall, a line of Individually Automated Vehicles awaited their passengers. He\u2019d never had a car\u2014had only set foot in one once, in fact. He had always relied on his feet for transportation. The 120-degree heat and omnipresent cloud of smoke lingering in the air had ceased to bother him.\n\nAbout halfway home, a sleek charcoal vehicle stopped beside him. A door popped open and a charming female voice spoke: \u201cPassenger 2099356, you may now enter your vehicle.\u201d\n\n*Mine? No way. Not mine.*\n\nA few seconds later, the voice beckoned him again: \u201cPassenger 2099356, please enter your vehicle and select your destination.\u201d\n\nLeslie warily stepped into the car. On the dashboard was a map of Ponderosa Pines, with a blue circle in the top left corner that read, \u201cHome.\u201d Leslie selected it, and 45 minutes later arrived at a large residence on Old Bakery Avenue. It was surrounded by a stone fence. The car approached a broad metal gate. The gate\u2019s sensor connected to the car\u2019s dashboard and asked for Leslie\u2019s fingerprints. Leslie placed a hand on the screen, his identity was verified, and the gate opened.\n\nInside the fence, pine trees rose to staggering heights, dropping streams of needles and cones as the wind tossed them about. Beyond the trees was a stone mansion, painted white with black highlights around the windows and door frames. Two cars were parked out front\u2014one for him and one for Blaise, he presumed.\n\nHe exited the car and entered into a wide-open living room, freshly painted and sparsely furnished. A chandelier hung above a staircase that led to the second and third floors.\n\nIn the far room at the other end of the house, a 90-inch television blasted music videos. Leslie could see the back of a woman\u2019s black-haired head.\n\n\u201c2099356, I presume?\u201d the black-haired head asked without turning around.\n\n\u201cCall me Leslie.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me Blaise. Or 2105344, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d\n\nLovely.\n\nLeslie climbed the stairs and found a bedroom with a double-king bed, which he presumed he was supposed to share with Blaise. Upon it, a royal gray Persian named Mufasa yawned at him, his red collar jingling as the cat shook his head.\n\nLeslie climbed into bed and refreshed his IPI. The number of databases he could access in PAN as a Mini Mart clerk\u2014his first job\u2014numbered in the low 100s. As a serial killer, they numbered at 989, 341, 863\u2014and the numbers rose every few milliseconds.\n\nLeslie frantically searched for anything related to \u201cserial killer,\u201d and began queuing thousands of historical documents and videos and biographical entries to download simultaneously. An alert rose on his IPI stating that his downloading power was insufficient for such high-speed traffic\u2014would he like to upgrade to the latest version 13.4.57?\n\n*Latest version?* he thought. *I never imagined upgrading to anything higher than a 3.0.1, let alone the* latest version *of IPI software.*\n\nHe agreed to the Terms of Use and\u2014without suffering penalties to his weekly rations, to his surprise\u2014the latest update of IPI was downloaded.\n\nAnd with it, seconds later, gigabytes of information about serial killers from the infinite PAN.\n\nGigabytes of blood, torture, dismemberment and murder. Videos that immortalized the terror of the victims as well as the ecstasy on the faces of the voyeurs who slayed them.\n\nGigabytes of autopsy reports from the 21st century detailing the gunshot wounds, burns, incisions, and dismemberments of millions of victims\u2014and the biographical recounting of the sadistic rituals the preceded them.\n\nGigabytes of accounts detailing how to stalk a victim before the kill; how to kill and dispose of a body; the best tools to make it quick, or make it slow\u2026\n\nLeslie\u2019s vision turned white as the information was pummeled into his IPI. He blinked hard to log out of it. Then he turned over the side of his bed and vomited all over the hardwood floor. He vomited four more times until his body ached and vibrated.\n\nHis IPI popped up unexpectedly\u2014which shouldn\u2019t have happened. There were built-in codes which disallowed the software to act without permission from the host. But, Leslie thought, maybe it was just a feature that came with the high-profile job. A new message alerted him:\n\nGreetings, 2099356! Your first assignment is:\n\nLYLE MCCATHERN\n\nLocation:\n\n1573 E. FAUBREY LANE\n\nTime to Complete:\n\n26 HOURS\n\n*Shit, what does that mean?* Leslie thought.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it means, numb nuts?\u201d he argued aloud with himself. \u201cIt means you have to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cKill what?\u201d Blaise asked, standing in the doorway. Leslie startled at her appearance.\n\n\u201cOh my *god,*\u201d Blaise exclaimed, noticing the pile of vomit. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d\n\nLeslie hurriedly covered the vomit with the bedsheets. \u201cUh, no\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said you need to kill something,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cIs there an electrical problem? Do we need an Electrical Technician, or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ll handle that, too, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nAn awkward silence hung in the air. Then, another message appeared in the IPI:\n\nInstrument of Choice:\n\nHATCHET\n\nLeslie\u2019s heart plummeted into his guts. He nearly puked a seventh time. He choked it back, swallowing painfully.\n\nBlaise sat on the other side of the bed. \u201cSo\u2026 I guess we\u2019re married now. You wanna\u2026 I dunno, go on a date, or something?\u201d\n\nLYLE MCCATHERN. 1573 E. FAUBREY LANE. 26 HOURS. HATCHET.\n\n*Jesus Christ.*\n\n\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Blaise demanded.\n\n\u201cYeah, a date. Sure. Tomorrow. I have some work to do.\u201d\n\nBlaise scoffed. \u201cAlready? Jeez, you just started, like, an hour ago.\u201d\n\nLeslie nodded uncertainly. \u201cLots to do, I guess.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHis first kill was awful. And messy\u2014*really* messy. Why a hatchet was chosen for him, he didn\u2019t know. But he sensed that, somewhere beyond the IPI, PAN itself was watching him. He\u2019d been in the workforce long enough to realize that if you didn\u2019t fulfill your job requirements\u2014 all T\u2019s crossed and I\u2019s dotted\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be granted leeway or forgiveness. Your rations, valuable as they were, would be first to suffer.\n\nAfter that, shit would keep rolling downhill.\n\nLeslie accessed his PAN downloads on disposing a body and then how to extract evidence from a crime scene. He had to vomit multiple times into the garbage bags he used to mop up Lyle McCathern\u2019s remains. He finished at the 23-hour mark, and PAN was satisfied.\n\nA new message appeared, with an icon of a cake with flaming candles beneath it:\n\nCongratulations on completing your first assignment, 2099356!\n\nNext assignment to be uploaded in:\n\n56.6334 HOURS\n\nAs the slaughtered remains of Lyle McCathern\u2014just some Joe Schmo who worked at a brewery, it seemed\u2014incinerated in a pit beside him, Leslie cupped his hands over his face and sobbed.\n\nHe sobbed. And retched. And sobbed some more.\n\nThen he went home and stayed in bed until his next assignment.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHe went on dates with Blaise. They exchanged half-hearted conversation. He stroked the fur along Mufasa\u2019s spine, making the cat purr contentedly. He sat in front of the television with his new family and watched movies to which he couldn\u2019t pay attention.\n\nBecause the information lurking in his mind was as alluring as it was insidious. Leslie didn\u2019t appreciate the allure, but he acknowledged it was there. He found himself accessing crevices of PAN that housed information he would have never considered. Some of the terms he came across\u2014murder, crime, torture\u2014had been deleted from public access decades after PAN was invented, Leslie discovered. With centralized control of PAN solely in the hands of one corporation, Infinitum, coupled with the mandatory law that IPI\u2019s be implanted at birth, it was easy for them to conceal and reveal whatever information they wanted.\n\nAnd now Leslie had unrestricted access to it.\n\nAt the 56.6334-hour mark, Leslie received a new message on his IPI. He uttered a worried half-groan before the software consumed him:\n\nGood afternoon, 2099356!\n\nYour next assignment is:\n\nJAMES AND JILL HAWTHORNE\n\nLocation:\n\nMILDRED\u2019S COFFEE HOUSE\n\nInstrument of Choice:\n\nGLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED\n\nTime to Complete:\n\n2 HOURS\n\nLeslie searched for Mildred\u2019s Coffee House on his IPI map. It was nearly an hour away by car. And he had no idea where he would have the time to find a Glock 43, whatever that was, and kill two people\u2014*two* of them. In a public place.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Blaise asked, not looking away from the television.\n\n\u201cWork again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know when you\u2019ll be back?\u201d\n\nLeslie sighed. \u201cSoon, probably.\u201d\n\nThe car door opened automatically for him. It received notifications when Leslie received missions. It sped down the highway at top speed, as if it understood his time constraints.\n\nThen, a hidden compartment opened beside the map screen. Leslie reached in and extracted a couple of things. First, a handgun\u2014the Glock 43 with a silencer, he guessed. He\u2019d never held a gun before, so he sifted through dozens of links on gun handling before reaching the coffee shop.\n\nThe other items included a denim jacket, a fake goatee, sunglasses, and a baseball cap representing a team he didn\u2019t recognize.\n\n*PAN is teaching me how to be a serial killer,* Leslie thought. He applied the accessories. He was grateful for the gesture, but didn\u2019t expect PAN\u2019s courtesy to last long; the automaton had never done him favors like this before. No sense in expecting the generosity to guide him through the rest of his life.\n\nMildred\u2019s was packed with people. Leslie had no idea coffee was such a hot commodity at one o\u2019 clock in the afternoon. The line dumped out of the front door and onto the surrounding sidewalk. Leslie took his place in line behind a fat couple and a yipey Yorkie with which they rubbed noses. *\u201cYou\u2019re such a good boy,\u201d* they coddled. *\u201cOh, what a good, good boy.\u201d*\n\nLeslie scanned through PAN to find out what James and Jill Hawthorne looked like: He, a pretty-boy millionaire-looking barbie in real estate with slick gray hair and an attractive layer of stubble; she, also a slick-haired real estate agent enticing enough to be in modeling or porn\u2014whichever PAN deemed most productive, Leslie scoffed.\n\nMusic blasted inside. People between the ages of 25 and 35 dominated the dining hall. Leslie glanced around, and spotted the couple in the corner. They looked sulky, certainly the least lively of the crowd, as if they\u2019d just had a fight.\n\nJesus, there were a lot of people. How could PAN expect Leslie to fulfill his job with three dozen witnesses surrounding him? He felt sweat seep from every pore on his body. His IPI announced that he had 35 minutes and 14 seconds remaining\u2026 13 seconds\u2026 12\u2026\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he mumbled. *\u201cFuck.\u201d*\n\nIn a panic, he nearly retreated to his IPI for guidance.\n\nBut then it hit him. That word: Panic.\n\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d a bored, acne-infested barista inquired.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 Three black coffees, please,\u201d Leslie replied. He paid for the drinks, then carried them over to a low table surrounded by beanbags on which the still-sulking Hawthorne couple resided.\n\nLeslie took a deep breath. *Here goes.*\n\n\u201cHey, friends!\u201d his voice boomed. They looked at him with suspicion and confusion.\n\n\u201cRemember me? It\u2019s Marty! Your old pal!\u201d\n\nJill looked at James, and he returned her concerned glare. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Jill began to say.\n\nLeslie interrupted her. \u201cCome on, you remember me! From college! We took the same algebra class!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\nLeslie cut her off again. \u201cHere. Black coffee, just the way you like it. On the house. Come on, let\u2019s get a picture together, what do you say?\u201d\n\nImpatiently, he gestured for them to merge together on one chair. \u201cCome on, squeeze together, don\u2019t be shy. You\u2019re married, for crying out loud! You\u2019ve seen each other *naked!\u201d*\n\nThe Hawthornes laughed nervously. Leslie felt as nervous as they sounded.\n\nHe retrieved a phone from his pocket and loaded the camera app. \u201cAlright, now, smile and say cheese!\u201d\n\nThey did. Just before Leslie dialed the \u201cTake Photo\u201d button, he uncovered the Glock from behind his denim jacket. Jill Hawthorne noticed it. Leslie pulled the trigger twice\u2014a quick \u201cone, two.\u201d Jill\u2019s surprise turned to terror, then to realization that she\u2019d been shot and was seconds from death. James died without knowing he\u2019d been shot.\n\nThe camera snapped a picture.\n\nLeslie stuffed the gun back in his coat and sprang to his feet. *\u201cHO!\u201d* he screamed, waving his limbs wildly. *\u201cHoly SHIT! Sweet mother of CHRIST! SOMEBODY HELP!\u201d*\n\nCurious eyes moved to the dead bodies.\n\nThen: Panic.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nLeslie allowed himself to be swallowed by the frantic herd as people stormed to the front door and created a bottleneck. He was nearly crushed by the fat couple with their hideous Yorkie as they struggled to push through the doorway. Finally, he separated from the crowd and sprinted to his car. He selected \u201cDestination: Home.\u201d It took him nearly fifteen minutes to catch his breath, and another ten to slow his heart rate. He followed the procedures on shirking the evidence, then returned home.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Blaise said, still sitting in the same place on the couch as when Leslie had left. \u201cThat was quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Leslie said, feeling breathless. \u201cEasy day.\u201d\n\nHe retreated to the king bed, where he expected once again to vomit and sob. But he didn\u2019t. In fact, he felt\u2026 good. Really good, actually. His IPI congratulated him once again, this time promising to deliver a tray of expensive cakes and sweets to his door within 24 hours.\n\nCakes aside, he felt lifted, as if the adrenaline boost had filled him with helium. He liked this airy feeling.\n\nAnd something else: He didn\u2019t feel remorse, as he had after bludgeoning Lyle McCathern. The bullets were quick and not nearly as messy as the damned hatchet. He could get used to bullets. It felt less personal. More like a job.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what it was.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLeslie killed half a dozen more people in the subsequent month. A sleezy waitress in Nevada; a hokey bartender running for mayor in California; two airline attendants from an Asian country he didn\u2019t recognize (just some dull, primitive society that had outlawed PAN, as Leslie understood it).\n\nHis murders became famous on the news, though the media gave him the piss-poor, unimaginative name of the Ponderosa Pines Executioner. With millions of databases he could download in seconds, Leslie learned from the mistakes of the idiots of the past centuries. No evidence had been found to incriminate him. Fortunately for him, the criminal justice system had been gutted to the point of near obsolescence in the last 100 years. Thanks to the strong-armed, omniscient PAN, people knew what stepping out of the parameters set forth by PAN meant. They knew that a crime against PAN, no matter how small, would risk their lives.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know\u2014but Leslie now did\u2014was that a crime against PAN meant a violent, prolonged, agonizing death. PAN ensured that jobs of such a specialty were still around\u2014and well-compensated.\n\nNot only had Leslie gotten better at killing\u2014when he wasn\u2019t actually doing it, he was shuffling through thousands of digital archives learning about it\u2014but he thought he\u2019d gotten better about *not caring* about it. That is, until he had to kill two teenage parents of a four-year-old.\n\nLeslie hadn\u2019t noticed the kid standing in the hallway, watching as Leslie duct-taped his parents\u2019 mouths shut, strapped them to chairs and started drilling holes in them (the instrument of choice was an electric drill). He hadn\u2019t noticed the kid until he\u2019d burrowed a drill bit deep into his mother\u2019s skull and killed her.\n\n\u201cAh, shit,\u201d Leslie muttered.\n\nThe kid had just stood there, sucking his thumb, taking it all in. They stood in silence for a full minute. Then, Leslie left the kid alone in the house, got in the car, and went back home. Realizing the magnitude of what he\u2019d done, he vomited for the first time since Lyle McCathern.\n\n\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he grumbled. He repeated it louder. *\u201cGoddamn it.\u201d*\n\nHe punched the dashboard. Then he did it again, and again, wailing on the thing. He started slamming his elbows and knees and feet around the car\u2019s interior, screaming and cursing. He threw himself about until it hurt, and continued until he felt like one giant, throbbing ache.\n\nWeakly, he picked up his phone to dial the police. A picture of the Hawthornes\u2019 dead bodies, taken just seconds after Leslie shot them, flashed on the screen. Leslie\u2019s lips trembled, and he broke out into hysterical sobbing. He threw his phone aside. He\u2019d forgotten about that picture. His first instinct was to smash the damned thing, destroy all traces of evidence.\n\nBut Leslie couldn\u2019t just ignore the kid. He\u2019d already left him alone in that house, amidst the grotesque corpses of his parents. He\u2019d hate himself forever if he just left the kid like that. He needed to call someone to that house to get the boy.\n\nOne of the things Leslie had repeatedly stumbled upon in the PAN archives was the remorselessness that seemed to be inherent in the most famous killers. Most of them felt no pity for the victims or their families, no regrets for their actions. In fact, a lot of them claimed they would do it again if they ever got out. They didn\u2019t have to think about how *not* to feel bad.\n\nLeslie wasn\u2019t that lucky.\n\nHe dialed the police number and reported a break-in. Then he hung up the phone, and forgot about smashing it. He felt tired, more so than he\u2019d felt at Reassignment last month. How he longed for a chance to change jobs, like his grandfather Farringer had done before him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Leslie spoke out loud. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not a serial killer.\u201d\n\nHe knew PAN could hear him, even when he wasn\u2019t logged in to the IPI. Leslie expected the IPI to activate any moment to deliver a personal message from PAN saying Leslie was out of line. A reminder that \u201cbreach of a worker\u2019s protocol with daily job-related task ensures penalties commensurate with the worker\u2019s offense, with punishments to be fulfilled in accordance with PAN Law 00841.\u201d\n\nYeah, Leslie had known it by heart since his early childhood school days. It meant that whole violent, prolonged, agonizing death thing.\n\nBut no message came. Surely PAN had heard him, but it didn\u2019t have anything to say.\n\nLeslie rolled over to cry some more.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLeslie threw his phone down on the king bed. It landed next to Mufasa, who sniffed it considerately, then flinched away with disgust. Leslie barged into his bathroom and slammed the door shut. He felt overheated and sweaty. He turned the shower faucet to cold. He didn\u2019t bother to remove his clothes. He stood beneath the water until cold tremors shook his body.\n\nThere was a knock at the bathroom door. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Blaise shouted.\n\nLeslie didn\u2019t answer right away. Blaise asked him twice more, her tone of voice becoming more afraid each time.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Leslie mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nA message arrived in his IPI:\n\nGreetings, 2099356!\n\nYour next assignment is:\n\nBLAISE PARKHAM\n\nLocation:\n\n1066 OLD BAKERY AVENUE\n\nInstrument of Choice:\n\nGLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED\n\nTime to Complete:\n\n3.43 MINUTES\n\nNo. No, something was wrong. A bug, a glitch. Something. It wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u201cWhat the *fuck?\u201d* Blaise\u2019s scream sent shivers along Leslie\u2019s spine, as strong as the cold water shivers he felt now.\n\nLeslie shut off the water and dashed out of the bathroom, water cascading off his sopping clothes. In the bedroom, Blaise stared incredulously into Leslie\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck *is* this?\u201d\n\nShe held out the phone, which brandished the image of the dead Hawthornes. Leslie\u2019s heart pounded wildly, then sank into his bowels.\n\n\u201cWhy were you looking through my phone?\u201d he asked. His voice was steady in spite of his shivering.\n\nBlaise snorted. \u201cReally? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to say? Tell me what the fuck this picture is doing on your fucking phone, Les.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA bitter smile drew across Blaise\u2019s lips. She shook her head slowly. \u201cThese pictures were on the news. Are you the Executioner?\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s silence and downward gaze told Blaise all she needed to know.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ\u2026\u201d she said.\n\nThe timer in Leslie\u2019s IPI dipped below two minutes. The numbers pulsed in blood-red, in sync with his own heartbeat. PAN began listing the consequences of Leslie\u2019s failure to complete the assignment.\n\nLeslie held up his hands, both empty, for Blaise to see. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a towel. When I come out, let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\nHe retreated into the bathroom. He picked up his gun. He returned to the bedroom and pointed the muzzle at Blaise\u2019s chest.\n\nHer eyes widened. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s IPI counted down the seconds: 52\u2026 51\u2026 50\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your job now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Blaise asked. \u201cThe Pines Executioner thing. It\u2019s why our rations are so high. Why you keep disappearing, sometimes for days.\u201d\n\n40\u2026 39\u2026 38\u2026\n\nLeslie thought of the kid standing in the hallway, and Leslie standing beside the dead parents. It occurred to him that PAN knew everything, including what Leslie was doing right at that moment. It knew every detail about every killer before him. And it was adding Leslie, the first serial killer in 100 years, to its database. Leslie Farringer Hill, the Pines Executioner. He slaughtered a family and ruined a kid\u2019s life\u2026 because he was Reassigned.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he whimpered, a line of tears running past his nose. He shook his head angrily. \u201c*No.\u201d*\n\n19\u2026 18\u2026 17\u2026\n\nLeslie hurtled the gun against a far wall. \u201cGet out of here,\u201d he commanded.\n\nBlaise didn\u2019t hesitate. She dropped the phone and sprinted for the door, leaving Leslie as alone as he\u2019d left the little boy.\n\nThe timer expired. The IPI deemed the assignment a failure. It commanded Leslie to stay in his place of residency, reminded him penalties would be issued in accordance with PAN Law 00841\u2026 So on and so forth.\n\nLeslie stripped out of his clothes, lay naked on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. It was the last time he would set foot in a house like this.\n\nHe stroked Mufasa\u2019s cheeks and chin, enjoying the hum of the cat\u2019s purr.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDays later, once the Law Enforcement Branch had caught up with PAN\u2019s report on Leslie\u2019s failure to provide adequate work output, they came for him. They broke into Leslie\u2019s bedroom, stuffed his head in a black bag, and shoved his naked body into a car he couldn\u2019t see.\n\nHe spent two weeks in a cold dungeon. The walls echoed with each breath he took\u2014as well as every beating, stabbing, and burning his hoarse voice protested.\n\nA week into the torture, a voice spoke to him. A woman\u2019s voice, though it sounded deep like a man\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about the Rebellion?\u201d the voice asked.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\nA fist collided with Leslie\u2019s solar plexus, knocking the air out of his lungs.\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Rebellion,\u201d the voice said.\n\nLeslie struggled to catch his breath. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch him to make sure,\u201d the voice instructed.\n\nThe hands that had winded him grasped his head and held it still. A high-pitched whirring sound drew close to his head.\n\nThen a sharp stabbing pain electrified every nerve in Leslie\u2019s body as a thin metal wire was inserted into his cerebral cortex. Leslie screamed, but couldn\u2019t tell if the high pitch was from the wire or his voice.\n\nThe pain lasted a long time. How long, Leslie couldn\u2019t know; there was no sunlight to guide his sense of time in the dungeon. Eventually, it stopped, and Leslie was allowed a brief break.\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d the woman\u2019s voice demanded.\n\nA low, grunting man spoke. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow thorough was your search?\u201d\n\nHesitation in the man\u2019s voice. \u201cPretty thorough.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Pretty thorough\u2019 does not mean thorough. Do it again.\u201d\n\nThe whirring sound. The blinding pain.\n\nAnd more screaming.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe sessions went on for days. Leslie\u2019s nerves throbbed and he could barely move.\n\nThe door to his dungeon squeaked open. Footsteps approached his quivering body. He tried to speak\u2014\u201cno, please, no more\u201d\u2014but his voice was too hoarse, his lungs too tired, his body too shaky.\n\n\u201cCome with me, Mr. Hill.\u201d Leslie recognized the deep-toned woman\u2019s voice.\n\nLeslie didn\u2019t move.\n\nThe woman sighed. \u201cGet him up.\u201d\n\nStrong, rough hands lifted Leslie by the armpits and dragged him into a bright hallway. The light pierced his eyes and brain. He scrunched his eyes closed, providing mild relief.\n\nMinutes later, when he could open his eyes, Leslie saw he was being led into a large courtroom. He sat before a panel of disinterested elderly people in black robes. Their table was raised several feet higher than Leslie\u2019s chair.\n\nA gaunt-faced woman with blonde hair sat in the center of the panel, peering down at Leslie\u2019s naked figure. \u201cState your name for the record.\u201d Her voice was sharp.\n\nLeslie tried to speak, but his throat burned. He swallowed a few times to soothe the sandpaper feeling, but still only managed to grunt a few painful syllables.\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes. \u201cYour name, please.\u201d\n\nBetween hacking coughs, Leslie managed: \u201cL-Leslie\u2026 F-Farr-ring-ger\u2026 H-H-Hill.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Hill, you have been charged by the High Court of Infinitum and Our Majesty the Primary Automation Network with failure to produce adequate service to the Union as part of your daily job duties. The proper punishment for such an offense, in accordance with PAN Law, is death.\u201d\n\nLeslie didn\u2019t respond. This wasn\u2019t news to him. He\u2019d expected to die days ago. He was baffled that he was still alive.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d the blonde woman continued, \u201cupon reviewing the information extracted from your IPI, it appears you are the victim of a glitch in PAN\u2019s system. The glitch was detected just hours ago, and is believed to have been caused by a virus implanted by a faction group known as the Rebellion.\u201d\n\nLeslie shook his head. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve never heard of them, Mr. Hill,\u201d the woman interrupted impatiently. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you. Your Reassignment to the position of \u2018serial killer\u2019\u2014a position that is not a true occupation, but a primitive criminal activity banned by PAN law\u2014is something the Rebellion fabricated within PAN\u2019s framework. The virus corrupted parts of PAN\u2019s processing centers, and you were unlucky enough to be at the receiving end of this treachery during the Automated Work Reassignment. Due to your unwitting compliance in an act of treason against the Union, through no fault or knowledge of your own, you have been exonerated of all charges regarding your work performance failure.\u201d\n\nLeslie breathed deeply. \u201cSo\u2026 I can live.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect, Mr. Hill. However, after discovering your hidden identity as the Ponderosa Pines Executioner and your role in the forceful removal of nine workers of the Union, you will incur penalties commensurate with those listed in accordance with PAN Law 09663, as repayment for their sudden loss in productivity.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I get to live.\u201d\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes again and ignored him. \u201cYou will be Reassigned in the main lobby of this building before leaving. You will then be escorted to your new place of residency, where you will be allowed one day of rest and healing. Beginning Monday morning, you will report for work as specified in your occupational handbook.\u201d\n\nA large book was thrust into Leslie\u2019s arms. He was given clean clothes and a ride to his new 12-by-12 apartment. And, of course, he received a new job.\n\nHe spent hours reading the manual on how to perform his duties as an Agricultural Secretary.\n\nEventually, he fell asleep and dreamed about nothing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLife went on. Leslie went to work on Monday and discovered that he was Agricultural Secretary to Travis Dollman, and so realized his fate was to not only file papers and answer phone calls but to endure the endless monologue of his new boss.\n\nNew stories of the \u201cPAN glitches\u201d began to pop up in the news regularly. Leslie wasn\u2019t the only one Reassigned to a fake job. Apparently terrorism, gun smuggling, and rioting were circulating as legitimate occupations in the Work Reassignment Centers, and authorities at Infinitum hadn\u2019t figured out how to counteract the damage that had been done.\n\nLeslie took a huge cut in his ration supply: 0.25 times the average distribution (down from five times the normal amount in his previous \u201coccupation\u201d), to be carried out for the rest of his life. That was okay. Leslie could learn to live with less food and electricity.\n\nA month into his job as Agricultural Secretary, Leslie\u2019s bruises and lacerations had healed. He had a half-dozen scars where the probe had been inserted into his brain. He thought about his previous Reassignment every day, and the chaos and trauma it caused him and others.\n\nHe leaned against a rounded metal fence at the side of a river that crept between two cities. He felt a hand touch his spine. He spun around and saw the face of Blaise Parkham.\n\n\u201cHey, you,\u201d she said sadly.\n\nHe nodded politely. \u201cHello.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made it out in one piece.\u201d She rubbed a finger over his scars. \u201cWell, not quite, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I just wanted to thank you for what you did.\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cFor what I\u2026 did?\u201d\n\nShe handed him a flyer, black and white with intricate geometric patterns in the corners. In the center, it read:\n\nRAISE YOUR FISTS\n\nFIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nDOWN WITH THE GOD MACHINE\n\nJOIN THE REBELLION\n\nLeslie glanced from the flyer back to Blaise. \u201cThat was you? Everything I did\u2026 was because of you?\u201d\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cNot me personally. But yeah. My people.\u201d\n\nLeslie balled up the flyer in one hand. He felt angry enough to rip the metal fence from the ground.\n\n\u201cYou used me as a tool. For what? This?\u201d He shook the balled-up flyer in his hand. \u201cThe Rebellion?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a chance to live a free life.\u201d\n\n\u201cA free life?\u201d Leslie shrieked. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name would you want that, if this is what we have to go through? We have work, housing, a steady supply of rations. Why do you care so much about your stupid cause that you\u2019re willing to fuck everybody else to get it?\u201d\n\nBlaise pursed her lips. \u201cBecause Infinitum is pumping out killers, too. Not serial killers, but silent ones. They go into the houses of Rebellion members and black bag them. We don\u2019t ever see them again. Those people you killed? We assigned you to do it because they were killing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? A brewery worker, a couple of real estate agents, a waitress? Two parents with a four-year-old child? These are the evil Rebellion killers?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, ignoring the sarcasm. \u201cYes, they were. And they are just a microcosm of a massive, suppressed regime sanctioned by PAN itself.\u201d\n\nLeslie shook his head. He couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nAs if reading his thoughts, Blaise said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe me. But it\u2019s true. Have a look for yourself.\u201d\n\nShe offered him a tiny cardboard box large enough to house a wedding ring. Inside was a small chip with long, thin needles attached to it.\n\n\u201cI know your access to PAN is limited again. This will give you full access to all of its databases for 12 hours. After that, it fries. It\u2019s not traceable, the encryption guarantees that. Just\u2026 take a look and see for yourself that I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d\n\nLeslie pocketed the device. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he muttered bitterly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we used you,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it. But my convictions haven\u2019t changed. I know why it had to be done. We had to send PAN and Infinitum a message. If I had to do it again, I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would let me kill a boy\u2019s parents in front of him again? For what? A chance at chipping away fragments of the so-called God Machine?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cNot so you could kill a child\u2019s parents, no. But for a chance to give that child a free world again, and his children after him? Yes, I would.\u201d\n\nThey were silent for a long time. They stared at the horizon, the unwavering buildings set atop the restless water below. \u201cPAN and Infinitum don\u2019t care about us, Les,\u201d Blaise continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about anything but productivity, output, results. As long as they get that, the ends justify the means. They don\u2019t care that we\u2019re human beings, that we need more than just a stupid job. We need a purpose. And we need the room to find out for ourselves what that means.\u201d\n\nLeslie clenched his teeth, unwilling to release his bitterness. \u201cI have a purpose. I\u2019m an Agricultural Secretary. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nBlaise stuffed her hands in her pockets and gave Leslie a light, sympathetic kiss on his cheek.\n\n\u201cLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d\n\nShe left Leslie alone by the lake.\n\nLeslie retrieved the tiny device from his pocket. He weighed the device and the crumpled flyer in his hands. He unfolded the flyer, smoothed out the wrinkles and read it again.\n\nWhen he got home, he laid in bed for a long time, staring up at the ceiling. He unwrapped the tiny device and considered it.\n\nHe logged into his IPI. Then he lifted the chip to his forehead, and dug the needles into his scars.\n\nedit: Wow.

She needs to be a fully rounded character so that we can feel his tension and trauma when he's told to kill her. We literally know nothing about her until she turns up again at the end, somewhat randomly. Did they ever speak when they were \"married\"? Did they ever have sex? Did they care for each other? Was there a time when he felt tempted to tell her everything? And what's her job? Everyone gets a job, right? She's just a plot device at the moment, not a character.\n\nAs a suggestion, I'd make the command to kill Blaise a counter-hack by Infinitum once his fit of rage had alerted them to his virus-given job.",

Take this portion of the story, add more detail aboit his life and his wife and the killings and such, amd a bit on the end where he questions and decides to join the rebellion. Next book establishes his place in the rebellion as they prepare for their final rising, maybe put in a setback for them, have the relationship with Blair grow stronger. And then the final book would be the final uprising against PAN, and true to what they said, have it involve some level of sacrifice, perhaps even killing off Blair after a relationship has been well established (though that may make the story less appealing and satisfying to some audiences). It would make a very good book series that is like things before it, but also so very different that it could establish a good following.",

Expand Blaise's involvement to really build an emotional bond with Les, so that when the order to kill her appears, there would be significant tension as the timer races down.\n\nExpand on the Infinitum and their agenda; the God-Machine; the current world-state. Make it morally ambiguous with the Rebellion--are they the good guys? Provide a physical foil for Les, or foils for that matter. Infinitum could find the hack and send out a strike team to take Les out. And when that fails, Infinitum could finally send out their best assassin for a 1v1 cat-and-mouse showdown which would really push Les to his limits. I think you have a hit in your hands, if you so choose to pursue it.\n\nFor that much story, you'd have to make multiple books. A trilogy perhaps. You could structure it in such a way:\n\nBook 1: Reassignment - Build up Les' skillset and relationship with Blaise - Introduce the conflict to kill Blaise (potentially as a plot twist that it was an Infinitum counter-hack) - Lead into Strike Team introduction - cliffhanger before the battle with the Strike Team begins.\n\nBook 2: Open strong with the battle against Strike Team - slowly uncover Infinitum/Rebellion agendas afterward - Worldbuild like crazy here - uncover plot twist between the two organizations - introduce the final foil which is the assassin\n\nBook 3: Go ham with the culmination of Les' skillset against the Assassin - Les is wounded and barely escapes - Reveal the depths of the God-Machine and its involvement while Les recuperates - Final Fight and resolution of all the concepts.

I haven't read a book in a few months (depression and so on) but this helped to light that fire of experiencing a new world in my mind and traveling outside my own life.  I just may have to pick up a book today to keep that going.",

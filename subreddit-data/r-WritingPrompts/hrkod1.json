            "comment": "In my defense, I didn\u2019t mean to lie. At least, not at first.\n\nThere\u2019s just only so many answers you can give to one of the most powerful A-list mutants in the world after she saves your entire class from death via careening down a mountain in the middle of a freak hurricane.\n\nAnd those answers all invariably include shutting your mouth and nodding when The-Motherfucking-Storm says she saw you teleport yourself and a couple classmates to safety.\n\nIt's better than admitting you got tired of carrying them after the first three.\n\nSo, it was off to Xavier\u2019s I went, with the blessing of my family. I think they were just relieved to realize our house wasn\u2019t actually haunted, and that all the moved furniture and missing snacks were due to their broody, rather-not-interact-with-anyone-if-I-could-help-it teenager. It was just going to be for a year or so, would include all the state mandated tests and some top class education, and was, if anything, more of a\u2026counseling situation. A way for young mutants to socialize with their peers.\n\nThey conveniently left out the part where this socialization happened over literal battle training and in a place conveniently named, \u2018The Danger Room\u2019.\u00a0\n\nYea. Shit. Add to that it was the best and literal brightest mutants helping in this training, and I ended up trying to make a runner in the first night. And then got caught by the literal Nightcrawler. Who seemed to think I was just taking an evening walk and offered to join me in something called *teleporter solidarity.*\n\nI politely declined.\n\nPretty sure Professor Xavier told him to keep an eye out for me, because he was there a lot more often with very unsolicited advice like what hair gel to use to keep your hair from poofing up after a - what he called - \u2018bamf\u2019. Even gave me my own bottle, which was nice. I guess. But not enough to get me to risk life and limb on a regular basis.\u00a0\n\nI had dedicated myself to coasting, and that was that. Caring was something they really couldn\u2019t get me to do, not when everyone else in my life had failed, not when I knew that I was the only one in the world for whom every second was actually real.\n\nI aged while everyone was in stasis. I grew. They didn\u2019t. Ergo, my time was more important.\n\nSo, I lied. I told them that my \u2018teleporting\u2019 powers had a max use of once a day and was, therefore, way too useless to be practical. In reality all the finger snapping needed to activate the time stops were just giving me carpal tunnel. The Wolverine guy was the only one who didn\u2019t seem to quite believe it, staring at me oddly after I\u2019d told the class. He never said anything though, leaving me to assume that even if he could smell lies he didn't much care for exposing them.\n\nProbably was for the best when you taught a bunch of literal super-powered pubescent kids, most with delusions of grandeur. Not me, though. This whole mutant life was just not my style. Life or death situations on the daily, constant stress, having to socialize with new people and, more than likely, *save* them\u2026yea. No. I\u2019d take the worst class designation any day.\u00a0\n\nThey did their best to make the life look as exciting as possible, I\u2019ll give them that, but even weekly Q&amp;As after Danger Room sessions with elite mutants weren\u2019t enough to ruffle me. Most of those talks had to be rescheduled due to the latest world-destruction event, others due to the fact they didn\u2019t even know which dimension so-and-so mutant was in this time. Real appealing.\n\nAnd then. There was the last one. The one Professor Xavier was meant to drop into. The one that freaking Sentinels decided to crash. The one I was skipping and didn\u2019t know about until a giant robot hand was two seconds away from crushing me.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, my entire desire for a simple life was pit against the option of a quick, brutal death and a release from all responsibilities. So, I didn\u2019t move. I think part of me just wanted it over with.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s when Nightcrawler \u2018*bamf*\u2019-ed atop the robot and sent it flying sideways. That\u2019s when Wolverine grabbed me and started to run. That\u2019s when I saw the other Sentinel aim. That\u2019s when my entire desire for a simple life was pit against the option of the quick and brutal deaths of some of the nicest people I\u2019d ever met in my life.\u00a0\n\nSo, I froze time. I ended up having to nearly break Wolverine\u2019s arm to get loose, but figured he\u2019d heal up fine. I macguyvered a laser canon from some scraps - those Danger Room tutorial sessions really were useful - and blew the first Sentinel\u2019s head off. Then the second. I ended up clearing off the campus at some point, just to make sure.\n\nThen I took a deep breath and sat down on the front steps of the institute, right beside where Professor Xavier was currently wheeled up. His hand was already at his temple, concentrating at was probably once a sea of Sentinels, but was now just a bunch of scrap metal. I sighed deeply and gave a mental farewell to my days as the laziest Class Omega bitch that ever existed.\u00a0\n\nAnd snapped my fingers to let the world start spinning.",

I sat back and watched as the best heroes in the world launched their attacks at\u2026a whole lot of nothing. \n\nBeast almost ran into a wall charging at the air where there used to be a Sentinel. Cyclops took out an entire section of fancy ironwork fence doing the same. Wolverine\u2019s head was spinning trying to look for something, likely me. Aw, he really did care. \n\nIt took a second for everyone to realize that the enemy was, for lack of a better word, absolutely obliterated. Over the yards of the institute, a sudden quiet sunk in.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d said a red-haired woman standing by the far wall, who some people were eyeing strangely. Was that Jean freaking Summers? Hm. Maybe if I was lucky everyone would be dumb enough to give Phoenix the credit? \n\nProfessor Xavier knocked that dull hope out of me with a soft clearing of his throat. There\u2019s a way he does it that I can\u2019t quite explain, some gravitas that had me sitting up straighter and the entire courtyard\u2019s attention on him in literal seconds. Some people clear their throat and it's annoying. Some people do it and it's just plain gross. When Charles Fucking Xavier clears his throat, the freaking world stops to listen. \n\nThat had to be its own mutant power, honestly. Probably came in handy with all the universe saving speeches he had to give.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cI believe our student here can explain,\u201d he said slowly, ridiculously blue eyes fixed on mine, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Miriam?\u201d\u00a0 \n\nI groaned and buried my head in my hands, partly to hide how red my face had gotten and partly because among the looks of disbelief in the crowd were more than a few looks of betrayal. \u201cYes,\u201d I finally forced out, sounding more like, \u201cErrgh\u201d, once it made it past my fingers. \n\nProfessor Xavier decided to take pity on me at that moment, probably because he could literally see how close I was to freezing time and pulling another runner. \u201cLet\u2019s talk in my office,\u201d was all I heard before there was a burst of smoke and I was there.\u00a0 \n\nCourtesy of Nightcrawler, who was currently standing beside the professor at his desk. And looking like I\u2019d kicked his puppy. Guess teleporter solidarity was over now. I winced.\n\nTime to face the music. Or the great responsibility. Whatever the right metaphor was. \n\n\\--\n\nShort, but popped into mind shortly after posting. Hope y'all like!",

            "comment": "\"It's not entirely about focus...\" Professor Wagner said, his thin German accent gently colouring every word he spoke \"...there are many of us - like Scott Summers - who require a physical tool to control our powers.  But for myself, and most other teleporters I have known, focus provides strength.  For us, it is natural - almost trivial - to teleport a few metres away.  But vast distances can be opened to us if we apply the strength of a disciplined mind to our task.\"\n\nI sighed.  \"I don't think I am like other teleporters professor.\"  That was an understatement.  In truth I wasn't even a teleporter at all.  I was something different and new.  There were others who had powers like me - chronokinesis, they called it.  Even Professor Rasputina exhibited some ability to manipulate time, although from what I understood her powers were based in her magical abilities, not her mutation.  But none possessed what I did.  The ability to stop time.  Or rather, I think, I could step out of the time stream and step back in at my leisure.\n\n\"We are all different Sean...\" Professor Wagner replied \"...and your mutation certainly has some unique consequences.  But you must not dwell to much on how you are different, you must realize how much we are alike!\"\n\nI smiled weakly.  The 'unique consequence' he spoke of was the fact that none of the telepaths at the school - not even Professor Xavier himself - could touch my mind.  The Headmaster described my thoughts as static.  One girl - one of the few telepaths who had spent any amount of time around me - described it as someone shouting every word that had ever existed into her ears.  That's why most of the telepathic students gave me a wide berth.  Even that one girl eventually had to stop hanging around me.  She couldn't stand it.\n\nI have no idea why that is, of course.  Best guess is that it's every thought I've ever had coming out all at once.  Whatever the cause, it helped me keep my secret.\n\nI wasn't ready for people to know I could stop time.  I knew that would make me significant in a way I just didn't want to be.  I knew what happened to significant mutants.  They went on to become X-Men.  Or they went on to become the enemies of the X-Men.  Or they went on to be pawns on a board, as the X-Men and their enemies circled around them, pulling them in a million directions.  I wasn't ready to be any of those things.\n\n\"Perhaps we are going about this the wrong way.\" Professor Wagner said, perhaps seeing the mark of frustration on my face (although not catching why I was frustrated thankfully).  \"I believe you require mental discipline, but I have asked you to develop that discipline using while using your power.  That is not how I learned to discipline my mind.  I was taught by Herr Getmann's cruel hand the art of the acrobat long before I ever knew I could teleport.  Perhaps that is the path for you?  What do you say - tomorrow we can begin to train you as an acrobat?  I promise I will be a better teacher than my master was.\"\n\nI smiled a genuine smile at that.  \"That sounds like fun Professor.\"  I meant it.  Something that wasn't constantly pretending sounded like a nice break.",

            "comment": "Professor Beast looked around the room and his unsettling eyes came to rest on me, \"Alain, please answer to the best of your ability, what is the meaning of 'Cogito, ergo sum?'\" His lips rose a bit in what must have been the closest approximation to a smile that someone like him could muster and he clarified, \"I mean by the question, of course, how do you interpret the phrase, not what the Latin translates to. I think we've all got that covered.\" Scattered laughter came from around the room.\n\nIt was intimidating. My first day in Xavier's school and I was being called on by none other than a member of the ACTUAL team, an actual X-Man. It would have been exciting if I wanted to be here at all, instead of being placed here because someone accidentally saw me use my power. I cleared my throat and tried to turn my mind from the mantra I'd been echoing in my head and towards the question, hoping to impress the waiting Professor. \"Um, 'Cogito, ergo sum, I think, therefore I am.' Uh...\" Trying not to think about my powers was sort of like thinking about my powers. And it made focusing on the question even harder. \"Uh, I think Ren\u00e9... I mean, Descartes. Ren\u00e9 Descartes. I think what it means is that self-recognition is the only provable state of being in an exterior world. His philosophy doesn't extend to others, only to the self, but it's a declaration of being, asserted via the only possible evidence.\"\n\nProfessor Beast nodded along as I explained, before flashing another pseudo-smile. \"Interesting answer. Good answer. Now, let's use that to transition into today's guiding question, 'What is self?'\" His voice slowly entered the background of my mind as I sat there, focusing again on my mantra, *^(My power is teleportation, my power is teleportation, my power is teleportation, my power is teleportation.)* It was the only thing I allowed myself to think about. \n\nAnother ten minutes of class passed before Professor Beast cleared his throat loudly for attention and then asked a girl sitting in the back of the class to repeat herself, she said loudly and with a bit of annoyance in her voice, \"Could whoever is thinking about teleportation please think more, I don't know, quietly? Some of the telepaths in the room haven't gotten to the point where we can close out every thought we come across.\" Redness creeped up my face and the mantra became louder, instead of quieting. The girl put her hands up to the sides of her head like she was getting a migraine and then shrugged, annoyed. \n\nProfessor Beast soon dismissed the class, pulling me over as it ended. \"Alain, as the only teleporter in the class, could you please quiet your thoughts down? I mean, I'm assuming it's you, but if it's not, I apologize for pulling you aside.\" My eyes were glazed as he spoke, trying to figure out a way to avoid the telepaths as much as possible. Didn't help that the school was run by one of the most powerful telepaths of all time.  I mumbled some response to Beast before scuttling away towards my room, thankful that the day was over for me. It took me a few more steps to remember that there was *one* place where no one would be able to hear me. Or rather, one *moment.* The power that landed me here in the first place.\n\nWith an effortless thought, the world around me stopped. One girl's hair flowed behind her and caught in the air like a statue. One of the older boy students was mid-jump as he came down the stairs, a no longer effective gravity working against the slackness of his face. I was careful not to touch anyone as I navigated the crowd. Anyone who maintained direct contact with me was able to stay in my time bubble. It was a nice ability, but scary. I looked at Professor Storm as I passed her by. She was suspended mid-air, flying between destinations. She's one of the strongest mutants in the world, and I could kill her easily if I wanted to. I could kill everyone in the school, with the exception of my hero, Wolverine. But I could still damage him so heavily that he was no threat to me. Letting them know I was that dangerous was a horrifying thought. Who knows what they would do to me?\n\nThe room the school had given me was nice. I took an hour to lie down on the bed and rest myself before resuming time. The sound outside my door resumed. Whoever had seen me in the hallway an instant before simply saw me vanish. Teleport, they would think. The charade being successful was a good thing, but having to even do it was depressing. The school was supposed to be a place where people like me could come and be themselves, but now I was hiding harder than ever before. Any sort of time manipulation rockets a person to the top of the mutant power-rankings, and Omegas always have a target on their backs. It wasn't something I was ready for. I began repeating my mantra in my head, hoping no one was listening too closely. *^(My power is teleportation, my power is teleportation, my power is teleportation, my power is teleportation.)*",

            "comment": "It was a pleasant day, the semester nearing to an end, the summer holidays coming. There was a sense of liminality in the air, the days after exams needless and yet still there. Some of the kids couldn't wait for classes to end and the days be filled with either nothing or extended clubs. Only those who were going home, despite making the choice themselves usually, weren't as excited.\n\nEmily liked the peace of it all. She was one of those to stay and since not attending any clubs, it was the idle time of a year for her - one where she didn't need to use her powers, one when she was normal not for the sake of other, but her own.\n\nLooking up the tree she was sitting under, she noticed a bee coming her way and *just like that*, it stopped in its track, freezing mid-air and just hanging there.\n\nThis was the better part of her secret. life can be beautiful but often too quick to be seen, too fast to be enjoyed. There was a pleasure in secretly enjoying what no-one can, a pleasure Emily wasn't ready to give up.\n\nLooking around she noticed Professor Xavier coming around the house, vaguely in her direction and decided this was not the day to talk to him in case he was going her way, getting up and walking away.\n\n\" You're easy to find but hard to catch.\" he found her reading in the library, using her concentration to his advantage, only hoping she won't freak out and run.\n\nShe didn't, luckily, looking up.\n\n\" I'm not offended, don't worry, Miss Brerry.\" he smiled a little, knowing that will only annoy her further.\n\n\" Sorry professor.\" She closed the book\n\n\" I was hoping to talk to you earlier.\" He said, positioning his chair so it looked like it belongs there next to the sofa she sat in. \"Should have probably warned you beforehand so you wouldn't run.\"\n\nShe stared at him quietly, waiting what will he say, though he seemed to wait for her answer and the silence stretched, as he looked at the book now in her lap.\n\n\" Patience isn't always a virtue.\" he finally looked up to her again, unmoving.\n\n\" Only if the other side loses theirs.\" she shrugged, cracking a little smirk.\n\n\" You will find I can be quite patient also.\" he answered, pleased \"Gift of old age.\"\n\n\" Time flies fast when you lived long, doesn't it?\" She teased, shifting comfortably in her seat \"Years gets shorter as we get older, right.\"\n\n\" It slows down a little, though,\" Xavier answered, leaning against his armrest \"You're quite the philosopher.\"\n\n\" Hardly.\" She snickered \"people always made this observation, right - I'm just repeating it, although... Well, Adrian Bejan wrote about our changing perception of time, didn't he?\" She looked at Xavier quickly, seeing him watch her with a soft smile curving his lips as he listened carefully to what she said.\n\n\" I believe he did, although I haven't read his paper yet. Though I do remember reading his Physics of life.\" he looked up, as if remembering something.\n\n\" Oh, I liked that one.\" Emily answered quickly \"Through I found it a bit repetitive a bit, at times, it was an interesting take...\" She stopped, realising professor Xavier's smile is growing as she spoke, feeling a little discouraged to continue even though he gestured her to.\n\n\" I'm sorry.\" He sighed a little \"It's a pity, we don't converse more, I feel like you have a lot to talk about.\"\n\n\" I'm okay.\" she quickly shook her head.\n\n\" Not talking to anyone?\" He raised his eyebrows.\n\nFor a moment, the silence stretched and she realised she was beginning to forget herself.\n\n\" Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?\" She didn't answer.\n\n\" I know your secret, Emily, you must realise.\" He said then, looking down to her book again and she felt her breath shorten.\n\nHe said it so casually, like... Like...\n\n\" How long?\" she whispered.\n\n\" The day you came.\" He answered without hesitation, watching out for her reaction when none came immediately.\n\n\" Well... I... Thank you for not telling everyone?\" He gave her an acknowledging nod \"Why.. Why didn't you? I mean why didn't you tell me, that you know?\"\n\n\" I wanted you to tell me.\" He shrugged, smiling again \"I hoped you'd tell me, at least.\"\n\n\" So... Why are we having this conversation then?\" his smile did not put her at ease at all, as he hoped it would.\n\n\" You kept up the whole year.\" Xavier tilted his head \"You can think of this school two ways, I'm sure you already noticed - some people simply just study in peace, content in a way - but some learn about their abilities too. Sometimes, what we can do, can be too much for ourselves alone. I want you to simply have a choice.\"\n\n\" I don't...\"\n\n\" Think about it.\" He interrupted her \"At least for a moment.\"\n\nShe sighed, looking away and he didn't push her, sitting there quietly, patiently until she looked at him again.\n\n\" Teleportation is good masking.\" He said, \"I don't think anyone noticed.\"\n\n\" Please don't flatter me.\" She looked away again.\n\n\" I am not.\" He answered. \"But, if you'd allow me a question? Why?\"\n\n\" Why what?\" She frowned.\n\n\" Why keeping it a secret?\"\n\nIt gave her another moment and she began thinking whether running away wouldn't be better than giving one but after a short while she just looked at him, taking a breath.\n\n\" Because I'm scared.\"\n\nAnd he knew she was telling the truth.\n\n\" I'm not ready - I know stopping the time is... is huge, and I don't want that, I didn't ask for it and I want to enjoy the peace for a little longer.\" He watched her, surprised at how calm she was, admitting all that.\n\n\" Weight your options.\" he answered, \"you surely know learning takes the fear away. Know that I could help.\"\n\nWith a soft smile, he reached to his wheels and after she looked away, went away.\n\n\" It's summer, Miss Brerry.\" he stopped himself and turned back \"I'd say decide quickly before it's over, but...\" Smirking to himself, he didn't finish, turning to go.\n\n*Decide quickly he said*, she thought.\n\nDecide quickly.\n\nMaybe there could be merit in it too.\n\n\" Professor, wait.\"",

Professor Xavier stared at her still, as if expecting something more. \"I'm not sure it's a good idea to experiment.\" \n\n\" Emily, please close the door,\" Professor said, going back and around the table. After a short hesitation, she did as he asked, coming a little as he gestured her to sit in the chair.\n\n\" We can go through this another time.\" She said as she sat down.   \n\n\n\" I would like to talk about it now since you are already here. Why do you think it's not a good idea to experiment with your powers, Emily?\" He watched her calmly as she looked away, not sure how to formulate the answer. \n\n\" Well.\" She finally spoke, looking down to the hem of her shirt she began rolling and unrolling. \"I don't know what's going to happen if I try to take you with me and I don't want to hurt you.\" She said \"It's... Time is a dangerous thing to fiddle with and I don't want to endanger anyone else.\" \n\n\" I see.\" He gave her a soft nod, speaking more to himself.\n\n\" Equally, freezing time for days is exhausting, so I'm afraid taking you with me would only... well it would make it harder and I'm not sure I want to just yet explore the boundaries on that one too.\" \n\nHe watched her quietly and she could tell he's processing what she told him. Then slowly, he came a little closer, reaching out with his hand. It gave her a moment to answer - but eventually, she did take it, knowing what he's asking. \n\nThe first thing he noticed was the silence, and he quickly turned his head to look at the opened window. There were no cycads, no hum of trees moving in the soft summer night wind, nothing. He returned to look at Emily, opening his palm. She didn't - she held his hand still, her breath getting a little loud. \n\nShe could feel his mind push against her and gave him a soft nod, hearing his voice in her mind\n\n*Let go of my hand*, he said. *I know you are scared but try.* \n\nSo she did, slowly, looking at him still, but he didn't freeze, breathing out. \n\n\" I can't run away.\" She realised, chuckling nervously.\n\n\" Well.\" He smiled at that \"You could return us both and run then.\"\n\nShe tilted her head, smirking a little. \n\n\" Are you feeling any difference?\" he asked and she thought for a moment, finally giving him a nod\n\n\" It's heavier.\" she said \"Like... I'm heavier than usual. Like I'm underwater.\" \n\nHe hummed softly. \n\n\" Will we try again tomorrow, when you're not tired?\" he asked her and she gave him a nod, looking away \"Let us return then.\" \n\nAnd suddenly the nightlife from outside the window was back and there was panic in the air too, mixed with fear and sudden anxiety. A painful combination. Emily was almost panting and as she stood up he quickly reached to hold her hand. \n\nShe slipped his grasp and was no more. \n\nFor a moment, he stayed by the empty chair, searching for her, before speaking. \n\n\" Courage isn't about acting with no fear. It's about acting despite your fears\" He said, expecting no answer, welcoming the little shameful chuckle. \n\n*I'm a coward and you know it*, she answered.\n\n*Absence of fear would worry me more, you have nothing to be ashamed of, Emily.*\n\nAnd she was gone again, hard to find.",

Think prof read more in his lifetime through, plus his experience adds up to it as well.\n\nAt first she was named Emily Berryblack but I though that surname is way too cute for her so I changed it to Brerry.",

            "comment": "All the students were getting up to leave class when he heard, \"Matthew, might I speak to you for a moment?\"\n\n\"Of course, Professor.\"\n\nProfessor Xavier had always been kind to him.  Matthew long suspected that Xavier knew he was hiding his full potential but the professor never pushed the subject and treated Matthew like all the other students.  He liked feeling normal here.  His long standing lie was that he could teleport.  Whenever they were required to practice their abilities it put Matthew in a tough spot.  The teachers were constantly trying to push his limits and get him to teleport further and further.  It's tiring having to run such far distances constantly.  Yesterday, the teacher had asked him to try to travel to someplace he had previously been.  After faking an attempt for an hour or so the teacher finally relented and suggested they take a break.\n\n\"Professor Munroe tells me you had a difficult time yesterday.  She was worried she might have pushed you too hard and wanted to make sure you were okay.\"\n\n\"I-I'm fine professor.  She didn't push too hard.  I tried picturing different places but nothing happened.  I don't know if I'm able to teleport like that.\"\n\n\"Well, things happen at different paces for everyone.  I'm sure you've heard of Kurt by now?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When he first came here, he was limited by what he could see as well.  He could travel to anywhere in sight, but beyond that, he was too frightened to push himself.  It takes extraordinary strength to push limits set by our minds.  In time, I'm sure you will be able to overcome anything you set your mind to.\"\n\n\"Thank you professor.\"\n\n\"Matthew, have you made any friends since you started here?  I don't see you with the other students very often.\"\n\n\"No sir, I-I think they are frightened of me.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"They avoid me, and I hear them saying things about me.\"\n\n\"Teleporting is an enviable gift.  I'm sure they will come around in time.\"\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\"Matthew, are you sure there isn't something else?  You know I would never use my gift on anyone without permission but it doesn't take a mind reader to see that something is bothering you.\"\n\n\"Professor, c-can you keep a secret?\"\n\n\"Of course, Matthew.  Anything you tell me would be kept between us.\"\n\nEyes to the floor Matthew said, \"I have been lying to you and the other teachers.  I can't teleport.\"\n\nProfessor Xaviers remained quiet as if telling Matthew to continue.\n\n\"I-I was afraid if you found out what I can do, that you would make me part of your advanced class.  I just wanted to feel normal for once.  Everyone my whole life has called me a freak and when I got here, I was just another kid.  I'm so sorry I lied professor.\"\n\n\"It's okay Matthew.  I understand.  If I may ask, what is this gift that you were afraid to speak of?\"\n\n\"It's easier if I show you.\"\n\n\"Lead the way.\"\n\nThe two of them left the office and went into the crowded hallway watching the kids on their way to various classes.  Matthew reached over and set his hand on Xaviers shoulder and everyone froze.  Turning to Matthew, Xavier said, \"Well, it certainly is an extraordinary gift.  The ability to freeze time is no small feat.  I can't say I've ever met another mutant with this ability, Matthew.\"\n\n\"Are you going to kick me out of the school for lying to you?\"\n\n\"No, Matthew.  I understand why you kept this from us.  It is an incredible burden to have control over time.  I imagine it can be quite lonely.\"\n\nNodding his head Matthew was tearing up a little.\n\n\"Matthew, I'm going to keep this between us until you're ready to tell other people.  Would you be okay with having private lessons with me once a week to learn to better control this power of yours?\"\n\n\"Yes, Professor.\"\n\n\"Very good.  Bring us back to real time and let us join the rest of the students.  It's nearly time for your next class.\"",

While I think the sublimental narration could be reigned in a bit, like where Xavier stayed silent could be conveyed or inferenced in a way that isn't as invasive and reads faster.\n\nBut your writing was fantastic, it really made me feel anxious and excited for him to tell Xavier about his power and the patient nature of Xavier was very calming.\n\nBut with that great and powerful writing you want to get to the point you know is coming, and that extra bit of subnarriation kind of feels like it gets in the way, at least to me.\n\nWith your writing style you'd probably be better off just having characters talking to each other and the narrator come in between 'scenes' to flesh out what happened and introduce us to where we're at in the next place or in places to set a new room or area, ect. and round out the sections to almost make chapters. Bring all the lines and events together more cohesively.\n\nBut that's just my reccmendation to make this truly excellent, if you do plan to write a longer Fan Fiction.\n\nGreat work though!!",

Also his mind reading doesnt equal omniscience, if the character truely desired their power to be teleportation on the surface, because that's more normal than dominion over a fundamental aspect of reality, then that's all Xavier would be able to sense, even if he was just doing a \"locate new mutants\" search with Cerebro\n\nLike Iceman for example. On the surface he can, well, make ice, And thats all that Xavier could tell when he invited Bobby to his school, it was only later through working with the proffessor and the team, as well as accepting himself, did Bobby learn that he didnt just make ice, He was ice and so very VERY much more\n\nI'm not the author and dont know where they want to take this character, But as a fan of Xmen and how they tend to grow their powers, Time freeze, is only just the begining. If he does come to accept himself and take the more advanced classes I can see not just absolute time freeze, but selective time freeze, aka Individualized suspended animation, time accelleration (Did wolverine just get atomized...again... well just set up a super time speed bubble and shorten his regen time from a month to a few hours) to the cr\u00e9me de la cr\u00e9me of time powers: Time reversal\n\nWho knows Maybe at the hight of his growth the character could be basically a living TARDIS",

He thought he could only make ice. If iceman knew he was even more powerful than that, then I doubt he could hide it from Xavier. Whether Xavier would push him on it or not is debatable. But Xavier isn't the golden god he's often shown to be and can be quite the hypocrite. He's used his psychic powers to wipe his X-Men of the memories of a team he lost. He forced the danger room (a sentient AI) into enforced servitude to train his teams. He means well, but his power and responsibility is a temptation to act immorally in pursuit of 'the greater good'. Ultimately, although he is extraordinarily powerful and has high moral standards, he is only human and makes mistakes.",

Imagine being able to convince people you can teleport or are a speedster simply because you have the ability to function on an entirely different wavelength than other people and during that time you are pretty much a god. You could do *anything* and get away with it. \n\nThink of all the quicksilver scenes in the recent x men movies, or the concept of \u201cflash time\u201d in the Flash. By then moving so fast they can make time a slow motion film for themselves, during that time quicksilver was able to relatively easily save every single student in the entire Xavier mansion for example.\n\nNow take this to the ultimate level where time is completely still. You could rob a bank, assassinate magneto, end a hostage situation, disarm a nuke, study for the SAT, hike to Everest and be back without it ever appearing that you left. The world would be a complete plaything  for someone like that. \n\nThere was once a really beautiful short story about a \u201cspeedster\u201d who essentially did this, and by stopping time completely he was able to evacuate an entire city from a nuclear terrorist attack, the downside of this being that his josh aged normally whole time was stopped. So by the time he was able to save the millions of people who would have been affected he was an old man and nearing the end of his life.",

Not to mention, it's rather predictable. If you're a teleporter in a fight, your first thought is to teleport behind your opponent, and if they know you can teleport, that was their first thought too. It'd be an awesome ability to have, and you'd win a fight against any normal person, but it doesn't make you unstoppable.\n\nStopping time, on the other hand, does. The moment you stop time, you are safe. Your opponents are defenceless. You have time to think of a plan. You have time to just bail if you feel like it. You have a literal eternity to accomplish your goals, and while you technically aren't invincible, you may as well be. If you want to be unstoppable, you can be. That's assuming there is no limit to how long you can stop time for, which is *way* more powerful than when there's a limit, but even just 5 seconds of stopped time would give you a huge advantage in a fight; incapacitating someone doesn't require much force at all, as long as you actually hit them with it.",

            "comment": "\u201cOh god, come on move, please move!\u201d  A young boy yells in despair. Everything was frozen, before it always lasted a couple seconds but now? 30 minutes. Every minute felt as if it was its own branch of eternity, as he could see things stuck right before emotion.\n\nHis teacher was named Kurt Wagner, also known as Nightcrawler. His power was that of teleportation, same as the lie the young man said. He wanted the two to teleport at the same time to, as Kurt felt teleporting\u2019s toll for beginners is best experienced with someone to talk to after.\n\nHe saw the blue and red flare, and sulfuric gust around Kurt\u2019s party visible body, the grass being blown in the wind stuck, the birds no longer flapping their wings, and worst of all the lack of noise.\n\n\u201cCome on Travis unfreeze it, unfreeze, unfreeze!\u201d He fell to his knees. He didn\u2019t know if when he spoke it was actually his voice or a thought.  He crawled up to Kurt\u2019s semi corporeal body yelling,\n\n\u201cMr.Wagner please you have to hear me!\u201d Feeling and touching was weird too. Something about it having no resistance to the force of his pushes doing nothing. He scrambled to his legs,\n\n\u201cProfessor! Mr.Logan! Mr.MCcoy!\u201d He screamed at the frozen figures nearby teaching a class. He yelled tome and time again. Nothing...just isolation.\n\n\u201cPlease...something, anything!\u201d His breathing was unhitched, no rhythm. It was the only sound he could find solace in, and it was discourse with no melody. Finally, as if time had pity for the poor soul, he heard a new noise:\n\n BAMF\n\n\u201cSee not that bad ri-Travis?\u201d Travis looked up to see Nightcrawler running to him distressed,\u201dTravis what happened?!\u201d Travis had a small smile before tearing up saying,\n\n\u201cI-I need to talk to you and the professor.\u201d\n\n(Some time later)\n\n\u201c-and I know should\u2019ve beeen honest it\u2019s just, I\u2019ve always seen on the news or online stories about omega level mutants, and always thought there powers were so cool but...actually having one?\u201d Travis explained looking at his hands and at the professor, who had allowed the young boy to talk without interruption. It seemed he had held this in his heart for so long, the professor would allow him to let it go.\n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t wanna be some god, I wanted something simple and cool like lasers or something...What I freeze time and I don\u2019t unfreeze it? Plus aren\u2019t omega level mutants always used or destroyed or something?!\u201d His breathing started to get unhitched again which is where the Professor stepped in.\n\n\u201cNo one is gonna use you Travis, not will I allow you to be hurt under my care.\u201d Travis looked at the Professor in the eye as his wheelchair came around to get closer to him,\n\n\u201cI understand your fear of this power, in fact I too had similar feelings to my own mental capabilities, everyone\u2019s voices and issues in my own head made me feel crazy.\u201d Travis nodded, though his breathing was his main concern.\n\n\u201cYour ability is great and while I cannot understand fully the feeling of isolation you may feel, I can see why the burden of this power could be too much for you while you\u2019re so young.\u201d He then got close to Travis looking him in the eye asking,\u201d Do you mind if I enter your mind for a brief moment?\u201d\n\nTravis nodded, though he gave a confused look. Suddenly Travis saw young mutants, people he thought were heroes. Cyclops, with his beams all over the place, destroying buildings, and too scared to open his eyes.\n\nHe saw Beast struggling to look at himself, as well as roaring in pain and agony. Rouge isolating herself, Wolverine in a rage, and then a young Charles Xavier clutching his head. And through all of them, he sees them slowly grow, and gain control.\n\nTravis opens his eyes and Xavier smiles saying,\u201dI will hold your secret to the students, however for your powers I will train you in keeping calm,  as I believe your anxiety acts as the mental barrier keeping everything frozen.\u201d Travis still getting over what he saw blinked as Xavier continued,\n\n\u201cOr I can wipe this power from your brain, lock it in your mind under mental locks so you no longer fear freezing it, though I will leave this to you.\u201d Travis took a breath, before standing and saying,\n\n\u201cAlright professor, I\u2019ll try training.\u201d",

It was our normal weekly meeting.\n\n\"Okay, I guess.\" I replied trying to sound neutral.\n\n\"Is something bothering you?\" He asked. I suppose I'm not a very good actor. I hesitate, then continue.\n\n\"Yes. It's the other students. I can hear them talking about me behind my back. The girls call me a creep.\" I say.\n\n\"Are you a creep?\" he asks directly. I am a bit shocked at the question.\n\n\"I-I don't know.\" I stammer. I ponder it a moment.\n\n\"Yes. I am.\" I say. He tilts his head questioningly.\n\n\"I don't mean to. It's just sometimes I can't help but stare at them. I know I shouldn't. And...and, I've done other...things.\" I say. He shifts in his chair slightly and waits for me to continue. I've already said too much. I might as well just get it all out into the open.\n\n\"I...I peeked at them. In the locker room.\" I confess. The professors eyebrows wrinkle.\n\n\"You understand that is a very serious breach?\" He asks.\n\n\"Yes.\" I answer with a nod.\n\n\"How would you feel if someone was to spy on you while you were changing?\" He asks.\n\n\"Bad. I know, I feel so guilty. I don't even know why I did it.\" I say.\n\n\"I will come up with an appropriate punishment later. I must say I am surprised. This is the first time I am hearing of this incident.\" he says.\n\n\"They didn't know I was there.\" I explain.\n\n\"Oh? How?\" He asks. I might as well just tell him everything. I resign myself to my fate.\n\n\"Because...I can't teleport. I can stop time.\" I say. \n\n\"I see.\" he says. \n\n\"I never wanted this power. It's too much temptation. I am a bad person. Whenever I come across a hard question on a test I think 'if I stop time I can get the answers'. When I see something I want but it's too expensive I think 'if I stop time I can steal it'. When someone makes me angry I think 'if I stop time I can kill them'. Don't you see? I can murder anyone with a thought! That is too much power! I don't belong in this school I should be locked away!\" I say, tears are starting to form in my eyes. He pauses a moment.\n\n\"Not many people know this but I also have the power to kill with a thought. Tell me, do you think I am a bad person?\" he asks.\n\n\"N-no. Of course not. You're a good person.\" I reply.\n\n\"How so? What makes me a good person? Is it the color of my eyes? Is it because I shave my head?\" He asks.\n\n\"Don't be silly. It is because you do good things.\" I answer.\n\n\"I see. So, do you think I have always only done good things? That I have never done something that was selfish or self-serving?\" he asks.\n\n\"I don't know but I don't think so.\" I reply.\n\n\"Do you think I have never made a mistake? Or that I have never hurt anyone on accident?\" He asks.\n\n\"That seems unlikely.\" I reply.\n\n\"Quite right. I have made many mistakes in my life and done things I will always regret. And yet, you say that makes me a good person. If I am a good person even though I can kill with a thought then what does that make you?\" he asks.\n\n\"I-I don't know.\" I say. He smiles gently.\n\n\"It makes you human.\" He says. I begin crying.",

Telling a lie is easy, but maintaining that lie is one of the most difficult things you can ever put yourself through.\n\nIn the beginning it was small things, like not accidentally knocking stuff over or feigning ignorance about knowledge I shouldn't know, but do. It's suspicious to know nothing about a book series one day, and then act like an expert on it the next.\n\nI had to be careful, I couldn't run because that would cause air movement, and rapid air movement plus sudden disappearance and reappearance could make people think I was a speedster. But I'm not\n\nI have to make sure I don't prevent things that can't be stopped without spit second action. I could have grabbed the toxic chemical vials mid air and set them back on the table like nothing happened, but instead, I had to make it look like I had just grabbed them from their free fall.\n\nIt's all very exhausting, I'm tired of always being vigilant to not contradict my lies, I'm tired of always having to lie to people, but on the bright side: I can get a full eight hours in five minutes.\n\nI've never been a fan of people, but when you have all the time in the world, sometimes you just want to share it with someone\n\nSomeday, someday I might come clean. Someday I'll answer for every lie I've ever told. Someday I might actually learn how to do more than just *Freeze* time.\n\nToday's not that day. Today I have a test I never studied for, So guess what I'm doing.",

            "comment": "I got to my room, lungs burning as I ran the first floor. \"It's all right Jack, you don't have to be afraid, you have done nothing wrong, everything will be all right.\" Said the calm voice of Professor X. Part of me immediately started to relax, but I could not slow down the heavy rapid breathing. I messed up, and people are hurt, dying, or dead. What is going to happen to me? Will they sedate me for the rest of my life or will they just get rid of me to stop others from getting hurt. Nothing can be done now, I need to get out.\n\nI cannot safely chronolock the entire building. I might miss some parts, and get myself into further problems. No, only the professor knows, I will take him out of the time, escape and resume his time once I am safely away. I expand my mind and find his timeline and the tethers that bind him to it, I need to focus, to grab them all.\n\n\"Jack you need to stop right now, I want to help you.\" I hear again almost a pleading voice. \"You are not a...\" I will never find out, what I am not, at that point, I separated all of his tethers from his timeline. In the back of my mind, I can feel lit like a pull at one of my hairs. Good, now I just need to... A terrible scream cut through the house. I need to move NOW. I run out of my room into the hallways of the mansion, damn, DAMN, they were all so nice to me and I am hurting them. Tears are running down my face, I can barely see. All the other kids are leaving their rooms to see what is happening. I race down the stairs and see the screaming girl. Standing in front of the frozen professor and two halves of a body. One half, a midstep into the room I chronolocked. The other half cleanly separated, frozen mid-fall, where I locked it once I realized what I have done, the blood and organs already in a position that does not seem quite right. I feel nausea overwhelming me. I quickly consider locking the girl in time, but quickly reject it, rushing like this, I might hurt her, and the alarm has been raised anyway. \n\n\"You, stop right there!\" I hear the rough voice aimed at me, Logan. \"I am sorry\" I cry as I keep running. I hear the heavy footsteps right behind me. Oh god, I need to stop him. I look around and focus on his tethers, as I do, I collide with someone in front of me, I panic and lock the tethers I got. \"Fucking hell, what did you do.\" I fall to the ground and look in horror at Wolverine, claws extended as he tumbles around into the furniture, leaving his two legs locked in time behind him. He is bleeding and swearing. I concentrate again and the screaming stops. The pull at the back of my mind is becoming stronger.\n\nI try to scramble up, but the man I collided with places a heavy furry blue hand on me. \"Calm down boy, you need to calm down before you hurt yourself.\" Through tears and snot, I bark a laugh. People are dying he is worried about me? I need to get out NOW. I struggle to release myself off him. He holds me for a second but then let's go, perhaps a little worried as well.\n\nI get to my feet and start running again. But halls are already full of people trying to see what is happening. I am pushing through, but feel hands trying to stop me. I concentrate, \"no mistakes this time\", I repeat like a mantra, and just keep locking people in around me. The pressure in my mind is becoming unbearable, I feel blood running out of my nose and ears. But I finally see the light of outside. \n\nI exit the mansion. I am dizzy. I fall to my knees. I feel every single timelock as a nail being hammered into my brain. A gentle voice speaks behind me, it sounds sad \"Jack please stop\". I concentrate one last time. I know what I must do. I focus on one last timeline and with a jank snap it in half.\n\n/\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*/\n\n\"Jean I am worried that this young man, might hurt himself if not handled carefully. He is so full of fear. Fear of rejection of himself and at this time of me as well. I hoped you could talk to him, perhaps he will respond better to you.\"\n\n\"Of course professor. But perhaps it is not going to be such a problem, he went to class today, and Kurt will certainly make him feel at home.\"\n\nHaving said this, Jean opened the doors. Professor saw the young troubled student standing in the middle of the room. The student looked at him, smiled for a moment and disappeared just as Jean crossed the threshold. And while the class applauded the newest student his successful teleportation. Professor's heart broke.",

Half of her being locked and the other half beggining to collapse. Jack panicks and runs to his room.\nHere begins my story and it follows as written above. At the end Jack uses his time manipulation powers to remove himself from time completely at the moment he was supposed to perform the  \u201cteleportation\u201d which Pofessor sees as Jack dissapearing.

In addition to that you make it seem like the professor is speaking to Jack in real time at the beginning telling him he did nothing wrong but speaking to Jean at the end to encourage her to speak to Jack. Because the body halves weren't described at all at the beginning I personally would never make the connection that Jean and the halves were the same person. Describing the body halves in a way like \"one half, as if frozen in life. Her dark brown hair motionless, her organs paused  before they fail. Her legs falling forward where my chronolock ended...her legs collapsing misstep as they remain in the flow of time. I only have one option left, run.\" Would foreshadow Jean being the body and make the cycle much more clear.\n\n\n\nProfessor X speaking to Jack before speaking to Jean further complicates that understanding as there is no context to indicate that this all happens during a single instance in time without your clarification.",

            "comment": "(This does not fit into current Marvel canon, not kept up with it, consider it...Earth-70991.)\n\nThey just thought it was tiring to jump through this dimension instead of using a shortcut like Kurt does, when they found me on the roof, bent over gasping like I was about to die. They assumed that this jump was too far too quick, and the demonic looking mutant especially  apologized, his accent hard to parse but comforting all the same, as the teachers helped me back to the group and a nearby tree to rest as everybody else took their turn to practice their powers. It\u2019s Tuesday and all. What they didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t know, was part of why I was so freaking tired was because I had to run through the whole training yard, in the building, up stairs, to the roof, before turning my power off. And...maybe going a bit black? A double whammy that. Holding it up hurts my head, and puts a drain on my stamina..and so I ran to keep it up as short a time as I could. Why I thought that would help, I got no clue. \n\nAs Iris lifts a small statue into the air, (she looks so cute with her blue eyes focused!) I sit under a tree and think, I didn\u2019t come here to be a teleporter. In fact I was tested to find out exactly what I could even do. As all Miss Flive saw was me be in my desk then immediately at the door.(And I didn\u2019t mean to do it either.) That could be, to quote Mister McCoy \u201cAny number of extraordinary abilities.\u201d I was all set to show them how I work. Maybe show off! And then the girl in front of me, who could create items from nothing (Just a small square for now, but still) was called a \u2018potential Omega.\u2019 And was immediately chivied off. Even now, whole months later, I only see her briefly, I hear she goes off on missions. I didn\u2019t want that.  Still don\u2019t. Horrifying! So when I walked into the room, I grasped  for an excuse and found it when a demonic man appeared in the bleachers with a BAMF. Instead of stopping time,  tossing basketballs into the air, and bringing the proctors into my field of moving time to see, as planned, I stopped time, ran  to the bleachers behind one of them through the headache, jumped into the air and restarted time on the descent, yelling \u2018Boo!\u2019 They saw this bespectacled girl walk into the room, heard \u2018Boo!\u2019 and saw her descend from the air, sweating.\n\nSo, ever since, I have been watched over by Kurt especially, as they try to figure out how I \u2018teleport.\u2019 They\u2019ve been so nice, I feel absolutely horrible deceiving them, but I don\u2019t want to fight. I don\u2019t want to be an Omega. I just want to use my power to get snacks as I watch TV. I sigh and look up to see who\u2019s next..and see Jean Grey and Xavier himself in front of me. Oh. Shit. Yeah. Telepaths. \u201cDo watch your language, Miss Blackwell. We need to talk.\u201d",

            "comment": "\"You only have five? That's only one for each of us, why didn't you take the whole pack?\" his friend Josh was complaining again.\n\n\"You think I'm stupid to take enough for him to notice some are missing? There are multiple mind readers in this school you idiot, the only chance we have for smoking is if no one finds out we ever stole anything, we won't get a second chance.\"  Paul gives each of his friends a single cigarette \"And I'm the one that steals them, shut up or I won't take for you next time.\". As he takes his to his mouth, a small green flame appears in front of his face, which he uses to light it up. \"Thanks Sam.\" The girl just smiles back.\n\n\"Oi, we keep the professor busy while you teleport inside his office to steal it! It's a team effort.\" All the others light their cigarette and laugh.\n\nTeleport... Paul had kept that lie for two years now. It was a simple lie to keep, truth was that the most powerful mind readers in that school were completely forbidden from entering any student's mind without a very good reason, and everyone else just saw him disappear and appear somewhere else. He enjoyed the life he had, and if any of the professors found out he could stop time, he would be made to train that power and join the so called omega class. It was so much better to be together with friends, having a laugh causing trouble throughout the school. Smoking hidden in the schools garden was a delight that the group did every time Wolverine was forced to teach a class.\n\n\"Someone's coming.\" one of the girls said as her ear twitches. Super hearing was especially useful to not be caught smoking.\n\n\"You sure Christy? This place is really far off the school.\" Josh held the cigarette forward and all the smoke seemed to be pulled from it, the same happening to the others afterwards.\n\n\"They're coming from behind, a group. Heavy clothes and...\" the girl's face went white \"Run! Josh cover us with smoke!\" she grabs the other girl and starts pulling her, the others following behind.\n\n\"The teachers will know it's m-\"\n\n\"It's soldiers! They're talking through intercoms!\" Nothing more was needed for the smoke of the cigarettes to rise up into a cloud behind them as they ran. But from the smoke, came the noise of a gun fire. \"Four of them! The smoke spooked them, why did I sa-\"\n\n\"It's not your fault! Just run to warn the professors, I'll keep them here! Josh remove the smoke.\" Paul stopped and turned around.\n\n\"You can teleport, you'll reach faster!\"\n\n\"And let you be caught and killed? I can teleport, I can run away fast if I need to!\" as the last fragment of smoke disappeared, everything stopped. \n\nThe wind no longer swayed the trees, all the noises turned to silence, and Paul looked back at his friends, Josh stopped in motion pulling Sam with him. He sighs and slowly walks off to find out what the enemy is.\n\nBehind a few bushes he finds the four men, dressed in a type of military uniform. Semi automatic rifles in their hand as they run to where the group is. One of them is already pointing his gun towards the group's area. If there's a clearing, the group could easily be shot at this distance. Only thing he can do is fight to keep them occupied.\n\nHe stops in front of the man already pointing the gun, and starts to think how he'll do this. Everything stopped in time cannot be moved, the only reason he can breathe is because he allows the air around him to keep up with his time. He looks to the other three men, and prepares to throw a hook. Stopping them should be easy enough. He throws the punch, and just a moment before the strike hits, everything starts moving once more, just long enough for the fist to connect on the man's jaw. And it stops again.\n\nPaul moves to the next one, he throws another punch to the jaw. He decides to just stick his thumb in the eye of the next one. The last one is running, he decides that the most powerful strike would be to run against him and drop kick him. As Time starts again, there is a huge impact of both forces colliding. Throughout the attacks, Paul could know that they were talking but with all the time stops, couldn't comprehend what they were saying. He continued attacking until all were incapacitated. His fists kind of hurt, and with a last check of all the men, he was certain he had won. \n\nTime started flowing normally again, Paul just smiled as he looked at what he did. Four military men on the ground, defeated by a teenager. He just needed to think of a lie to tell the professor. Someone that could only teleport doing this much damage would be hard to convince.\n\nThen a noise came from behind him. Paul turned to look and saw a quick bright light from the bush. Then pain. And darkness.\n\nPaul tried to scream, the pain in his chest was enormous. But he couldn't. He couldn't move any part of his body, he couldn't see anything, he could only feel the pain. So much pain, something small pressing strongly into his chest, and so much darkness, why was this happening, he couldn't even breathe. The few seconds that passed seemed to take far longer until the air started flowing to his lungs again. On the second breath he screamed. So loudly. He had never heard such a loud scream. \n\nThrough the pants of pain and the pain itself, he finally realized what was happening. Everything except him, and a bit of the air to breathe was stopped in time, even light. As he regained more control over his power, he started seeing again, and saw it. The flashing light came from a gun, he was shot. The pain came from the bullet now inside his body, stopped in time.\n\nThe realization terrified him. He couldn't remove the bullet, he couldn't remove inertia from an object stopped in time, as soon as time started again, the bullet would pass through him. Any mistake moving around could lead to him having the bullet stuck somewhere inside of him. He thought of his blood flowing out of the body. He can't stop the time for his own body, he just made sure that the air around the wound was stopped so that no blood could leave.\n\nHe was scared and full of pain. He could maybe move his limbs a bit, but the torso would have to stay in place. He allowing himself to move his head, to try and look around for something he could do, even if he knew that he couldn't move. He looked towards where the school would be, and just hopped his friends would make it. Sure that he would die, he decided to try one last thing.",

It had been so long since he felt this relaxed, and while grading papers at that. Only good things could happen.\n\nA knock is heard. \"Come in.\"\n\n\"Professor.\"\n\n\"Ah, Scott.\" he lifts his head to look at the x-man which just entered, and saw a face of worry. \"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Professor... there appears to be a barrier around the school building.\"\n\n\"What?

Logan and Scott were looking around at the bodies of the military, Xavier kept an eye on him, and Jean quickly came to him. Paul tried to smile weakly.\n\n\"T-the bullet is inside of me... I can't stop it... I can only stop time... If time comes back, it'll continue... I'm sorry I lied about what I could do...\"\n\n\"Child. Jean will stop the bullet and hold you in place.

Jean holds her hands towards Paul, Logan and Scott turn to where the army man is. \"Are you ready?

            "comment": "Time is a weird concept.\n\nWe all can see the effects of it's passage.  We feel it in how the new replaces the damaged, the young take over for the old, the slow inevitable shift of all things around us.  Time has a grip on all that cannot be broken.\n\nOr rather, we have a grip on it.\n\nImagine for a moment that Time does not pull on us, but we pull on Time.  We hold it in a vice grip in the back of our minds, unaware of how tight the stranglehold is.  And we continue to do so until the day of our inevitable death, when consciousness flees and the grip is broken, for we no longer need a meaning for Time.\n\nThat might give you an idea what it feels like to wake up one day suddenly aware of a third hand gripping something like a perpetually drowning man.\n\nTo be honest I couldn't even put words to what it was I could do once I got this ability.  I thought it was some fancy form of teleportation.  That's what I told everyone.  At least when they weren't trying to kill me.\n\nThen a mutant buddy lent me a couple copies of a weird manga.  A manga about vampires and breathing and something called stands and... stopping time.  That's what kind of gave me a clue about it.\n\nIt also gave me a clue about shutting my mouth about it.  Not just because it was way stronger than teleportation, but because quite frankly I'd heard plenty of stories about what happened to super strong mutants.  Anyone in the mutant community had.  Stories of the kind of people who hunted them down and did things far worse than just killing.\n\nThat's what caused me to make up my mind and go find the X-Men.  To find Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.  The only safe place on earth.\n\nIt wasn't hard to find to be completely honest.  You could hardly walk in a suburb or corner with mutants on it, known or otherwise, without talk about the school.  Anyone could find it if they wanted, but no one could get in if they weren't permitted.  So figuring it out was the easy part.\n\nThe journey itself was the hard part.  As certain as it was there were people who could actually take me to the school, it was just as likely to be a trap.  Maybe it was paranoia kicking in but I wasn't exactly keen on the Brotherhood or other government sponsored groups having any chance of tracking me down.  So I made the journey on foot.\n\nWell... on foot being a loose term for hitchhiking rides and long frozen walks.  It's easy to get through checkpoints or find free transportation when no one wants to admit they didn't see you there before.  Because that would be admitting to their own negligence.  Plus side of all this is I got good practice both with my gift and with disguising it.\n\nAfter a couple weeks and a few close calls I was stood on the front lawn, admiring the massive complex for all it's glory.  It was quite the marvel, emerald grass as far as the eye could see, an imposing campus that could pass for a modern day castle, water features that would make the White House envious, all in all an impressive display.\n\n\"Breath taking isn't it?\"\n\nNot discovering a new superpower for flight was quite impressive after a scare like that.  Somehow this bald gentleman in a wheelchair had snuck up in complete silence.  Then again this WAS a school for mutants, it'd make sense for someone to appear from thin air.\n\nGentleman in a wheelchair... why did that sound familiar?\n\n\"Apologies,\" he turned to present himself, \"I did not mean to startle you.  You seemed rather caught up in admiring my school, so I took it upon myself to extend a welcoming hand.\"\n\nThis was professor Xavier?  It would make additional sense he could both find someone who had just arrived and appear from thin air in that case.  He was, after all, the single biggest rival to Magneto and a veritable super mutant in his own right.\n\n\"Now if you are here by yourself I would be remiss if I did not inquire as to the meaning of your visit.  If I may, you are a young mutant here to enroll yes?\"\n\nIf it was possible to make it any more obvious it would doubtless require both military grade explosives and enough neon to blind a small country.\n\n\"Naturally.  Well if you be so kind as to follow me we can begin your orientation...  Ah but I am getting ahead of myself.  Would you be so kind as to demonstrate your gift?\"\n\nAnd immediate crashing of the parade.  A demonstration, of the many ways planned to hide the time stopping powers, especially in the middle of an open field, was not in the plan.  Actually... There was ONE idea.\n\nThe discomfort must have been equally clear as the eagerness to dear Professor X.  \"Pardon my rudeness, for some of us our gifts are a bit of an awkward topic.  It is quite alright, but you should know that here you are among friends.  Colleagues.  People who are willing to accept you for who you are.  When you feel comfortable sharing by all means do so, at your own pace, in your own time.\"\n\nIt would take a long time indeed to share the true nature of the mutation, and longer still to realize the entire time the Professor had not truly said a word, had not truly been on that lawn, and that he had been doing a bit of his own trickery with time.",

            "comment": "I had been to the school for a month already, but had yet to make any friends. I guess teleportation put some people off as being too powerful, and the blue guy who kept hanging around me kept people away as he was Omega. I guess he stuck close because I could teleport also.\n\nWalking down the hallway I watched my wannabe glide down the stairs with grace. She called herself the Violet Sparrow and her purple costume hugged her form. He had told her once that her costume was more purple than violet but that didn't go over well.\n\nI had been trying to get her to talk to him for weeks now, but to no avail. I sighed as I watched her put of the corner of my eye and saw when she missed a step and started to fall.\n\nQuick as a wink I froze time and headed toward her. I side stepped the Angry Bee, what a silly name, and positioned myself to catch her. I let time progress slowly so that she seemed to melt into my arms as delicate as a snowflake. A purple snowflake, anyway. Once I had her supported I let time resume its flow.\n\n\"Oh! Wow, thanks!\" she exclaimed as she turned to look at her savior. I smiled as we locked gazes and I saw her smile, my heart leaping with joy, \"You're Instant Transport, aren't you? I've noticed you around\".\n\nI blushed at the stupid name, I had come up with it on the top of my head without much thought and now it had stuck. No way to change it.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Violet Sparrow. I've noticed you too\" I stammered, hoping it was the right thing to say, \"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"I'm fine\", she replied, disengaging herself from my grasp, \"Thanks for the catch\" she beamed. \"I have to head to my next class now\".\n\n\"Oh, yeah, me too. See you around, I guess.\"\n\nI watched as she glided up the stairs and was saw her turn and say, \"You know, a few of us were going to the park later, did you want to come along?\"\n\n\"Sure!\", I exclaimed sounding too eager, \"I mean, yeah, I'd like that.\"\n\nThe Violer Sparrow smiked and went up the stairs out of sight.\n\nI glided down the hall dreaming of the park we'd hile heading to my class when the entire building shook with a huge explosion from the top floor, the sound deafing me temporarily.\n\nI froze time and ran up the stairs with my heart in my throat fearing the worst. At the top of the stairs I looked around with disbelief at the carnage the explosion had caused. I saw the bodies of many students lying on the ground in pools of blood, most were not moving. I looked for it then I saw it, the color purple.\n\nWith hesitant steps approached and saw I was too late, the Violet Sparrow's lifeless form was rendered almost unrecognizable from the blast.\n\n\"NO!\", I yelled, then without thought did that which I swore I would never do again. Beads of sweat started to form on my forehead as I concentrated and a terrible headache started to form, as those around me started once again to move, but backwards.\n\nI made time back up until the air was filled with shrapnel returning to the source of the explosion. I looked at the source and saw it coalesce into a room, then a door deforming to contain the blast.\n\nI let time back up a few more minutes, then let it creep forward as I opened the door to the room with the bomb. It took a lot of strength to move the door ads inertia tried to keep it closed. Once the door was open I went inside and stopped time again.\n\nI searched the room and found the bomb hidden in a desk, a rather small looking thing that didn't seem it could cause such chaos. Bombs weren't my specialty but it was rather easy to dismantle the bomb especially since it had no chance of exploding.\n\nOnce the bomb was safely dismantled I let time resume its normal flow and left the room.\n\nThe students were walking g to class, with no knowledge that they had died, and came back. Or didn't die in the first place. Will have been dead? I'd have to reread that section in The Hitchhiker's Guide to get the proper terminology. \n\nFrom the stairwell I heard someone fall. Crap! The Violet Sparrow! I ran down the stairs and saw her sitting at the bottom rubbing her foot. I wasn't there to catch her this time.\n\n\"You okay?\" I asked as I went to help her up. She brushed off my advances, \"I'm fine\" she muttered as she went down the hall. \n\nDamn it! There went my chances of the park. Sometimes I just hate time manipulation. \n\nAt that moment I watched a portal open up in front of me as and the Great Doctor Strange stepped through.\n\n\"We need to talk\", he told me.\n\n\"Damn it!\"",

The fly over to the school was a bit awkward. I don\u2019t like to socialize a whole lot so the two hour flight was very quiet. \nCyclops broke the silence, \u201cthe Professor told me that you can teleport?\u201d\n\n\u201cTeleport?\u201d Then I realized that this was an opportunity that I could use to solve the reason why I hadn\u2019t gone to the school before. \n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what the Professor gathered, while he was tracking you with Cerebro, your position was changing quickly, so we put two and two together... is it not your power?\u201d\n\nI made up my mind, \u201cy-yeah it is, I just don\u2019t tell people very often, I\u2019m sorta a loner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how you feel, Benjamin\u201d\n\nWe touched down and I was greeted by the Nightcrawler, I guess they thought because I was a \u201cteleporter\u201d that it would\u2019ve been cool to see another one \u201clike me\u201d. That could not be farther from the truth. But I didn\u2019t want to let people know my true potential. I could stop time.\n\nIt took a couple hours for a tour around the school which ended with Kurt showing me to my room. I closed the door behind me and locked it, I was now surrounded by powerful people that could possibly understand how i felt. But no one could truly understand, having the weight of being so dangerous that you could take anything you want. Or kill anyone you wanted, even the strongest people in the world. The burden of god like powers that I never wanted. I don\u2019t see myself as an over powered being and I definitely don\u2019t act like it but, I knew it in the back of my mind. \nI chose not to tell people about my ability because of the status and repercussions of my abilities could have on the world. People would look at me differently. There could be people that would use my power for personal gain and I didn\u2019t want that. \n\nSo I kept to myself and didn\u2019t talk to many people, I avoided everybody at all cost. But there was this girl, Becca Jonah, who kept talking to me. She had the power to bend light to her will. She could bend light around her so she could be almost invisible or just simply take the light away from there sources. Not too overpowered, which I envied. But Becca took interest in me and would constantly talk to me. I didn\u2019t necessarily mind the attention, she was cute but I\u2019d rather not have any attachments. To my dismay, she caught up to me after class and asked if I wanted to study and before I could come up with an excuse to say no she told me her room number and walked away. \n\nI snapped my fingers and everything stopped. I walked up to Becca and stared at her. I sat there trying to figure her out, people never really payed me any attention. So this new feeling of being wanted was odd. I walked back to my room and sat on my bed mulling over whether I should go to her room to study. I made up my mind. \n\nI snapped my fingers again and happily greeted the noise. Around 6pm I walked to Becca\u2019s room and raised my hand raised my hand to knock. But I was stopped by a hairy man who smelled of cigars. \n\n\u201cYou the teleporter bub?\u201d\n\nThe tone of question caught me off guard, \u201cy-yes, why do you ask Mr. Logan?\n\n\u201cJust wonderin\u2019 kid, somethin\u2019 bout you ain\u2019t addin\u2019 up.\u201d\n\nMy heart skipped a beat and my mouth went dry. \u201cWhy would you say that Mr. Logan?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know right now but I\u2019m watchin\u2019 you bub.\u201d \n\nThe Wolverine turned and walked away, leaving me startled and uncomfortable. I just then realized Becca\u2019s door was open and she was standing in the door way. She was looking at me with a puzzled look on her face \n\n\u201cWhat was that about,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cOh nothing\u201d I lied\n\n[Somethin\u2019 about that kid rubbed me the wrong way. He says he is a teleporter, but he ain\u2019t smellin\u2019 like one. Elf leaves two distinct smells, one where he started and ended. This kid leaves a trail like he walked to his endin\u2019 point. He ain\u2019t no speedster neither, the cameras would be able to see him but they don\u2019t.  It ain\u2019t addin\u2019 up. Ima watch the kid.]\n\nWe went into her room and studied for Professor \u201cBeast\u201d McCoy\u2019s class. The night went on pleasantly. I didn\u2019t even think about of stopping time once. But then she asked about my power. \n\n\u201cHow does it work? Like do you just think of somewhere and you just end up there?\u201d \n\n\u201cY-yeah basically, it\u2019s sorta just happens ya know\u201d \n\n\u201cOh... neat,\u201d she seemed disappointed with the answer but didn\u2019t press anymore. \n\nIt was 9:45 and the lights out warning was rang. I got up and walked to the door with Becca behind me. She stopped me at the door and thanked me for studying with her. I opened the door and went to leave when she stopped me again but this time with a hug. The sudden contact with another human was so alien and unexpected I froze. My body began to feel so shaky and weak. But her touch brought a smile to my face which also felt foreign. I didn\u2019t want the moment to end too soon.\n\nSo it didn\u2019t.\n\nI woke up the next morning with a smile and a warmth in my body that was new. I got dressed and actually looked forward to seeing someone. We saw each other almost everyday and then I did something unexpected for me. I asked her out. I asked for permission to leave campus and go to the movies. It was approved and we made plans for the weekend. I don\u2019t remember much of that day, it\u2019s sorta like a blur. But when the day came I walked to her room and on the way past Logan, who gave me a long stern look. I knocked on her door which she answered almost immediately with a beautiful smile. \n\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d I asked with a sincere smile.\n\nShe answered with a small giggle and grabbed her purse and laced her arm on my elbow. As we walked to the front office and signed out, we called for a taxi and discussed what movie to watched. When we made it to the movies and sat in the back Becca moved the armrest and to my pleasant surprise laid her head in my shoulder. I was taking in the moment savoring the affection. We were paying attention to movie when there was a huge BOOM. The ground shook and screams followed. The ceiling gave away and debris was falling everywhere. I grabbed Becca\u2019s hand and ran out the movie theatre. Dodging and weaving around falling pieces of ceiling and frantic civilians. When we got outside we were greeted with a battlefield. There were two sentinels fighting Colossus, Wolverine and Cyclops. \n\nThese sentinel were different from what we studied in school, they seemed to have been upgraded with better technology which the present X-men were not prepared for. One had rammed an spike through Wolverine and had pinned him to the ground. Colossus was locked in a pounding match with the other. Cyclops was trying to free Wolverine while trying to avoid the lasers being shot from the sentinel that had pinned Wolverine. My mind froze and I couldn\u2019t move. There was so much destruction, part for the theatre was collapsed and there were bodies. Crushed from the debris, the poor unsuspecting civilians had got caught in the cross fire. My paralysis was ended by an explosion. The shock wave sent me and Becca flying. We slapped against the theatre damaged walls. I started to get up when I heard the wall start to give. A large section started to fall. Becca wasn\u2019t moving. I had no choice. I snapped. I breathed deeply, my secret will be exposed. There was no way back, I will not let her to be hurt. I got up calmly, and walked over to Becca and picked her up. As I carried her over to a safe location I had an overwhelming sense of pride and happiness that I have finally shed the burden of my secret. I looked at Becca\u2019s unconscious face and brushed her hair away from her face and smiled. She was worth it. I looked back at the insinuating fight. Why not.\n\nI ran back to the battle and let my true potential of my power show. When time is stopped physics doesn\u2019t really work the same way. I can rearrange molecules very easily due to the atoms not moving, so essentially I can destroy things with ease. I walked up to the sentinel that was pinning Wolverine and I slammed my fist into the knee of the sentinel. Feeling the atoms part from my touch. I then ripped off the arm the sentinel freeing Wolverine. With my hand flattened I parted the sentinel\u2019s head in two. I casually walked over to the second soon to be pile of scrap. I climbed onto the sentinel\u2019s shoulders and placed my hand on the side of its head. I pushed forward. Feeling the metal give under my hand. The circuitry in the head was destroyed. I had pushed my hand into the sentinel\u2019s head al the way to my shoulder. I removed my arm from inside the now useless predator. I hopped off the hunk of metal, brushed off my dusty clothes and walked back to Becca. \n\nI then released time.\n\nEverything snapped back to normal. The battlefield was silent for a brief moment as confusion and bewilderment hung in the air. Everyone just sort of looked around. I just sat there holding Becca. She slowly started to gain consciousness and looked at me confused. \n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She asked still groggy \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,  I took care of it,\u201d I said reassuringly as I smoothed her hair.\n\nI looked up to see a angry looking Wolverine walking towards me. I braced myself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some explainin\u2019 to do bub.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know it was me?\u201d I asked trying to hold onto a shred of hope. \n\n\u201cBub, your smell is everywhere,\u201d he said \n\nI let out a sigh, my secret is out, there was no going back. \n\nI gave a sheepish smile and said, \u201cI might have not told the full truth about my powers...\u201d",

            "comment": "(I haven't watched any of the movies, just watched some cartoons, but here's my submission.)\n\n\u201cOlivia, Professor Xavier wants to speak with you.  It\u2019s about your training.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, Ma\u2019am.  I\u2019ll be there\u201d\n\nAssumptions are quite useful at times.\n\nWhen I realized how powerful my gift was, I stopped talking about it.  After all, I don't want to be taken by the wrong people.  How am I supposed to know who to trust with a power like this?\n\nSo, I relied on the power of assumptions.  I never use my power on others, so they can't see what I do when I step into the void of time.  They just see me move from one place to another instantaneously, so they assume I must be able to teleport, or at least do something similar.  They never bother to think that I might be doing something else.  When someone finds what they think is the answer, they stick to it, no matter what other options there may be.\n\nI helps that I don\u2019t bother trying to correct their assumptions.\n\nWhat does make it difficult, however, is that this stupid school tries to train me as a teleporter.  They try to make me teleport farther and into places that I would not be able to go normally.  The former isn\u2019t too bad, as in the time void it doesn\u2019t matter how fast I can go and I can just walk, but going into a sealed room or other place is a no-go.  I guess they\u2019ve just made another assumption that it has to be a place I would be able to get normally, but I heard them talking about figuring out how to train that into me.\n\nAt least I can have some private time, even when I\u2019m around these dozens of other kids.  They all want to be X-Men one day, and it would be a lie to say that the idea of being a hero with my power isn\u2019t appealing.  I just want to take my time, not be rushed into something when I\u2019m not mentally ready.\n\nI suppose looking at it that way, my power is a bit poetic.\n\nThe first thing that I notice when I enter his office is the ambiance.  It is very calming, as if it was specifically made to put the students at ease.  Actually, that mindset probably did affect the design somewhat.\n\n\u201cPlease sit down, Olivia.  There are things that we must discuss.\u201d  He gestures to a chair on the other side of his desk.  As I sit down, he continues.  \u201cI have heard that you are having difficulty with your training.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, Professor.\u201d I shrug.  \u201cI know how my gift works.  I just don\u2019t see the point in talking about it.  It\u2019s not as if it will change anything about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you so reluctant to let us understand?  You recall Kurt and how his power strengthened as it was trained.\u201d\n\n\u201cNightcrawler?  Yeah, he\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d  I began to fangirl a little.  People made yet another assumption that it was just because we were both teleporters, but it was actually his personality.  He was just so nice, despite his appearance.  He sometimes comes to me offering his help with my power, even if it isn\u2019t what he thinks it is.  It\u2019s a nice gesture regardless.  Professor Xavier chuckles.\n\n\u201cThen please, explain to me how it works so we may help you.\u201d\n\nI think for a while.  I had encountered Professor Xavier a few times in my classes, and he seemed genuine.  I had also heard many things about what he did for mutants like me.  He was much better than what I knew of Magneto.  With a deep breath, I decide to tell him a bit.  At least I can pause time and run if things get hairy.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t teleport.  I do something else entirely.  It just looks like teleportation.\u201d  He seemed a little surprised at that statement, but I continued.  \u201cMy power is more time-based.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d he mused.  \u201cThen you can pause time?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d  I shook my head.  \u201cIt\u2019s more as if I step beyond the hand of time.  I\u2019ve only used it to stop time, but I could theoretically do other things.  I\u2019ve just never tested.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen perhaps we should find a way to observe it.\u201d  He made a note before wheeling around the desk.  \u201cThough I must ask.  Why did you never tell anyone what you could do?\u201d  I just smirked at him.\n\n\u201cNo one ever asked IF I could teleport, they just assumed.  And honestly, I liked it that way.\u201d",

I'm a Uhm\"\n\n\n\"Not a teleporter but a time stopper\"\n\n\n\"...yeah\"\n\n\n\"Seems we'll have to change our records, the ability to pause time is a potential Omega level power, thus it needs to be trained carefully.. and honestly, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\n\n\"No wait\"\n\n\n\"Something to say\"\n\n\nJohn pauses and starts to think but stops thinking and begins to speak from his heart alone \"I don't want to fight anyone, or have to go to war with other mutants or people, I just want to be a normal kid with a normal life, maybe find a girlfriend and that's it, I don't want to be trained into a super soldier and have to wear spandex and fight against anyone, so just leave me as a weak teleporter who can't even get inside of that box\"\n\n\n\"I can't promise you will never have to fight anyone, after all the world has had trouble accepting our kind for quite a while and I can't say what the future holds, that said I am glad to have a student that sees the brutality of violence for what it is, you have a kind soul and I am honoured to be given the chance to nurture it, you don't have to become a soldier but you shouldn't waste your gifts either. Think of it this way, you were born with a great talent for pausing time, you were also born with a slightly weak back so you'll never be a professional weight lifter, you have impressive scores in your maths class but you struggle in language arts, everyone has things they are talented in and things they are not, the only normal thing in this world is the will to nurture one's talents and compensate for one's weaknesses. You can be whatever you want to be, whatever you choose will become normal for you in time\"\n\n\n\"Well thanks I guess, I feel a little better knowing this isn't some military training camp, do I still have to take this test?\"\n\n\n\"If you like, or we could arrange for the time control test instead\"\n\n\nJohnathan looks at the box, seeing no way to get in he returns to the professor \"time test please\"",

            "comment": "The worst bit is when they ask me to teleport to difficult places, you know like on top of buildings or in to a vault. \n\nI started having to say that I could only go to places I could see my landing footing, that way it at least stopped sealed rooms being such a nightmare. \n\nAnyway we ended up on this mission the other day, and some laser shooting asshole has a sneezing fit while we are in the X-jet, blew out the back of the jet and we are falling out of the sky like we about to end the dinosaurs, now guess where they keep the parachutes... Now, I \u201cteleported\u201d with a friend the other day because she stood up to the cops and they shot without warning. So everyone is screaming at me to get them out of there... wtf am I supposed to do? No point stopping time, I\u2019m not going to be able to fix the half plane we are currently in, and I can\u2019t very well throw everyone out of the flight, so I gotta wait, the ground is rapidly approaching, everyone is screaming, and dickhead laser-show is shaking me. \n\nThirty seven minutes and eighteen seconds I paused there. That\u2019s the real secret of pausing time, you gotta keep track of your relative time, just because everything else is paused, doesn\u2019t mean I am. Learnt that the hard way when I spent a year trying to skip the embarrassments of puberty and ended up clearly having aged rapidly to everyone in my old class. Anyway, I kicked him once square in the balls for blowing up the plane and unpaused time. \n\nWhen you\u2019re travelling as fast as that, it helps to pause buffer for precise stuff. Everyone else just seems me start to flicker, which is cool, I guess, not everyone\u2019s powers have flair, but at least this way it looks like mine do. Anyway, I fuck up the last pause and the nose starts to crumple against the ground and the inertia sends everyone not strapped down (laser twat) flying. The look in his eyes is just dumb, his brain hasn\u2019t reacted yet and he\u2019s still screaming my name as he comically sprawls in the air. Time to get moving though and I haul the first person out, that was easy, getting back in to the jet was irritating though, I had to make a ramp out of stuff, then I inflated the raft stairs thing, turns out they don\u2019t work so well I\u2019ve paused time. Regardless, next up, do you know how hard it is to move a 1600kg half rhino dude as a 70kg woman? Yea it took a whole day, and involved ropes and stealing a car... The others were easy after that and I contemplated leaving laser-taint to his fate, I didn\u2019t I\u2019m not a monster. \n\nI set us all up at a safe distance sat us all so we could see the explosion and unpaused time. It was one hell of a cool explosion. And in that exact moment I realised I\u2019d forgotten to also get the bad guys out of the cell on the lower deck. \n\nSo like long story short, I\u2019m suspended, Xavier \u201chad to\u201d check my version of the events and knows I\u2019m Omega Class, and I\u2019m no longer allowed to leave the grounds. As if that\u2019s going to stop me, who\u2019s going to find out? The time police?...",

            "comment": "&gt;*\"I was in third grade when my powers activated. The stress of my family moving, my sixth grade bully, and my abusive home life... I just wanted to be left alone, I wanted it to stop. To my young third grade surprise it did. Birds midair and flap, cars motionless, even the waves of the ocean stuck in place like a picture, the sky a shifting red miasma. No one could explain their luck around me: finding a lost wedding ring, a narrowly missed car, me catching a teetering X-BOX during a particularly fun game of Halo... I'm from a family of immigrants so we bounced around from Long Beach to Tijuana and back constantly, until highschool when Cerebro found me.*\n\n&gt;*I was wrongly classified as a \"mass teleporter\" with the restriction it has to be within line-of-sight and about my own weight...a misconception I allowed to persist for obvious reasons. You ever try moving Colossus? Yeah, ain't happening. Once the secret of the X-Men was revealed I was given the code name: Freight. Beast was the first to surmise something was different about me, but a \"oh, my powers must've mutated further\" quickly threw him off my trail. Steering clear of Mimic and Rogue was a whole 'nother can of worms, I was dangerous enough and I didn't need imposters messing up my timeline. The only people that know about me, the real me, is Charles Xavier and Sage, both of whom have been sworn to secrecy...one as a secret between good friends and the other as an overly calculated agreement based upon not wanting to be on my bad side. Eventually I learned the red sky was actually the threads of all reality in a form I could comprehend, infinite possibilities, time, and space...all held motionless by me. Despite the cold winters of New York I still found ways to help people...the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, X-Force but they never knew it. Hell, I once Sparta kicked an emerging Kang back into his portal. Life got a lot easier once I researched conch snails and found an old subdermal injector in Beast's lab, fights were now little more than an alcohol soaked swab (I'm not a monster) and a pneumatic \"tsss\" away from being over.*\n\n&gt;*My biggest test would be when we fought Jamie Braddock, Psylocke's eldest brother...he was literally enveloped in the red sky, basically he was the center of a temporal tornado, a flawed singularity, a storm unto himself. As a consequence of his reality warping powers and the hallucinations of his mind he could bend and twist all matter to his will, which sometimes included the X-Men. It turns out his insanity is the outward base thoughts and hallucinations of Jamie, his real mind...his rational mind is stuck within the red sky wrapped up in the little red squiggly bits that make up reality. He begged me to help him, to stop him from hurting people, to save his family. He'd been stuck shooting forward and back in time trying to avert disaster after disaster, altering timeline after timeline. He begged me... In all my years I never thought to touch the red sky, but I fought through the webs Jamie would inadvertently spin, saving my teammates along the way, pressing on through the temporal hurricane, until I made Jamie hear the familiar \"tsss\" to put his mind at rest. It took me months for my wounds to heal, covered in thin red burn patterns like after coming into contact with a box jellyfish. I had Mr. Fantastic give me a temporal distortion detector that alerted me of heightened tachyon activity via atomic switch. Okay, okay I may have just walked in and borrowed it for an extended period of time using my indefinite five-finger discount...but I figured he owed me for the Dr. Doom thing I helped him with (supervillain knee caps just don't magically 'blow out' on their own in the middle of a fight ya' know). Wherever I was in the world I always found time to help Jamie with his meds and outbursts. He's the only one who's really ever understood me, we chat sometimes in his moments of lucidity and I've arranged for him to only have the kindest doctors, nurses, and orderlies on his floor for their shifts. The best way to defeat an enemy is to make them your friend. I've encoded this journal into a hidden Cerebro subroutine should anyone need it, or mainly I just had to tell someone. I'm 3-D printing a new polymer subdermal injector for Magneto and I had some down time. Not bad for a kid from Orange County.\"*",

He told me that while he understands I have anxiety issues and passive aggressive tendencies I can't keep wiping people's underpants with poison ivy or putting ticks in their clothes when they aggravate me.\n\nHe also told me that it was funny when I wheeled Magneto around the brotherhood of mutant's computers and put their phones in his pockets, so I guess he understands the need to vent.   \n\nIt's a strange feeling, being the god of a world where you are always alone.  Probably how some of the others felt when they woke up and found out they could bend the world however they wanted.\n\nXavier has to be some kind of saint.  Every pain anybody feels washes into him.  I get to be alone whenever I want, but he gets to never be alone.  Maybe that's why he encourages me not to spend my time being petty or holding resentment.  Theoretically I could hold a grudge forever.  \n\nJust as well he loaned me this awesome hat that blocks telepaths, that kid Zanzibar will not be happy if he gets a look into my head and finds out I didn't photo-shop him into a picture of him standing at the top of a human pyramid of naked geriatrics.",

            "comment": "I was 14 when it started.  My brother had just gotten his license a couple months before and we were on our way to the movies to see a late show.  We didn't always get along, things had always come easier to me and I didn't have to try as hard as he did.  I had a pretty awesome memory, my brother would always call me a freak when I remembered some mundane detail from something he forgot.  Not a freak like the Mutants, just what most people would call a photographic memory.  I was gifted and I knew it, so calling me a freak felt more like a compliment.  I took it that way at least.  Or rather, I tried to.\n\nHe turned up the music, he loved his German Death Metal or whatever he called it.  My brother liked to show his dominance by doing that, because this was his car, and I had to follow his rules.  He started scream-singing along with it, trying to replicate the rage on the car's stereo.  I can only guess that he was attempting to draw inspiration from all the red lights in front of us, because right at the climax of the song, he realized he was going way too fast into the lights of the cars ahead.  I grabbed my seat as he slammed the brakes.  The car started drifting to the side, and I flung my hands up and closed my eyes for the impending crash.\n\nIt didn't come.  There was only silence.\n\nNo exploding glass.  No squealing tires.  No German Death Metal.\n\nI opened my eyes and everything was frozen.  I was too for that matter, but not like everything else.  The adrenaline was still coursing through me, and I was sitting there with white knuckles gripping the dashboard for a good 2 minutes before I could let go.  It was another few minutes before I could start processing information again.  The car was almost sideways to the rest of the traffic, and my brother's side was higher than it should've been.  We were starting to flip.  I tried to open my door, but it wouldn't move.  I reached behind to the back door and tried to pull the handle; no luck.  \"Great,\" I said, \"I can see exactly how screwed I am, but I can't do anything about it.\"\n\nI started pleading with the handle, begging it to let me out, and after concentrating on it for so long, the handle started to move.  It wouldn't get past a certain point though.  Kind of like when a door is locked, and you can turn the knob a little bit, but it stops.  Our dad liked to fix cars, and we had helped him almost every weekend for years fixing various things on the family vehicles.  I had a basic idea of how the handle was supposed to work to open the door.  The door wasn't damaged (yet), so there was no good reason it wasn't opening.  I was focusing on every part of the door, trying to feel out what was stopping it.  But then it started getting further.  I was thinking of every part, moving together, how they interact, and I could pull it all the way.  The door wouldn't budge though, then it occurred to me that the hinges had to allow it to swing, and it did!  I pushed the button on my seat belt again, thinking of how the latch gets released when the button is pushed, and I could take it off.\n\nI was scared, I didn't know what was going on, but I had a chance to save us.  I undid my brother's belt and threw it off him.  I dragged him out of the car, which due to the angle it was tipping was pretty easy, and started dragging him away.  He wasn't light, and my muscles were screaming at me by the time we reached the sidewalk after 4 lanes on the road.  I didn't know what to do now.  We were safe, I could see the inevitability of what was about to happen, but what now?  My mind was racing, I hadn't fully processed what happened, but I was sore.  I took a seat next to my brother to try to figure out what was going on.  I was calming down, feeling tightness in muscles I didn't know I had.  Now that we were out of immediate danger, I needed to think rationally about the situation.  I took a second to grasp that I may have just saved our lives, and in the moment I started to relax, there was a sudden onslaught of squealing tires and crashing.\n\nMy adrenaline spiked again, and I looked over at my brother who looked just as confused as I felt.  The car was upside down, and had stopped before hitting anyone, barely.  My brother started crying, asking, \"What happened?\"\n\n\"I don't know\" I said, and started crying too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police arrived after a bit, witnesses had stopped to give their stories.  It actually took some time to convince the cops that it was my brother's car.  We weren't injured at all, and the car was upside down, so we could understand how they were confused.  They had to call the paramedics, and began asking us what happened.  My brother said that he was in the car one second, and next to me on the sidewalk right after.  There was nothing in between.  When the cop turned to me, I was doubting everything that just went on.  Which, for someone with a memory like I had, that was frightening.  I responded with a half-hearted, far off, \"I don't know\".  I hugged myself and started to cry again.\n\nWe were taken to the hospital, because apparently it's the law that if the car flips, everyone who was in it has to be examined.  We weren't in it when it flipped, technically, but the cops weren't interested in semantics.  Our parents were called and met us there.  They were scared and confused, and neither of us were in a good enough mental state to give them much detail.  I do have to give my brother credit though, he owned up to the fact that it was his fault, and that he probably deserved to be dead.  The doctors said they wanted to keep us overnight for observation, and my parents agreed.  Since I was still a minor, I was sent to the children's ward, while my brother stayed in another room.  I also got the feeling the police didn't want my brother and I talking about it while they weren't around.\n\nMentally and physically exhausted, I fell asleep right away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly the next morning, I woke up and a nurse poked his head in, asking if I was awake enough for a visitor.  Figuring it was the cops, or maybe my brother checking on me, I sat up and started to mentally prepare myself.  I still wasn't sure what I would say, to anyone, because I didn't know what happened.  There was no way I was remembering it clearly.  I was surprised when a woman came in I never met.\n\n\"I talked to your brother,\" she said, smiling, \"and he's doing okay.  Just a little bit of bruising, like he was pulled away.  It seems as though a miracle occurred last night.\"\n\nI muttered, \"Yeah.  I don't really know what happened.  Are you with the police?\"\n\nShe laughed a little, and shook her head.  \"No, but you and your brother certainly think alike.  Why don't you tell me what you think went on?\"\n\nShe had a calming effect around her, and I wanted to say something, but I still wasn't sure exactly what all that craziness was.  \n\n\"I don't know.  I know I remember my brother slamming the brakes, and the car turned sideways, but then it's kinda fuzzy, and we were on the sidewalk watching the car flip.\"\n\nShe came up to me and gently put her hand on the side of my head.  A moment later she pulled it away and looked confused.  She smiled again and said, \"My name is Jean Grey.  I represent a school for people with certain talents, and you may be a gifted individual.  I think you may have done something last night to save you and your brother, something that you aren't sure about, and maybe scared of.\"  She sat on the side of the bed and took my hand, \"I know it might be a little overwhelming.  You did something amazing, and it frightens you to think about it too much.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why do you think it was me?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she started holding up her fingers while she counted, \"first, you seem like you're holding something back.  Second, I have some telepathic ability, and I can't make any sense of your thoughts; like they're jumping around without completing, or coming all at once.\" She glanced off looking a little confused.  Raising another finger and she said looking at me with her calming smile again, \"Third, the Professor in charge of the school does a good job of finding Gifted people.\"  You could hear the capitals in 'Professor' and 'Gifted' as she said them.  \"I'll talk to the police, and I'll stop by after you can go home to talk to your parents.\"  She gave me another reassuring smile and left.\n\nI didn't know what went on just then, it rushed past me even when I went through our conversation again.  \"Bye!\" I yelled, after I got to that point in my head.  I didn't want to be rude.",

                    "comment": "Part 2:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents were upset with my brother, he totaled his car and put us both in a lot of danger.  He was going to be grounded all summer.  And usually when they were upset with him, he found a way to blame me.  My mom was pretty religious, and she was thanking God that we survived without any injuries.  I didn't say anything yet, I wanted to try explaining just to my parents first.\n\nAfter we got home, my brother went to his room to begin his punishment.  I asked my parents to sit down in the living room.  I explained the visit from Jean Grey, that she talked to the cops for us, and that she would be stopping by.  My parents asked if I was a mutant, and I said, \"I don't know, but she thinks I am.\"  A couple minutes passed, and a strange car pulled up to our house.  Jean came to the door, and my dad let her in.  She explained the situation again, better than I did, and asked them if they would be okay if I went to the school (and if I wanted to go).\n\n\"It's a lot to process, that Alex is a mutant.  What do you want to do?\" my mom asked me.\n\n\"Can I have a couple days to think about it?\"\n\nJean responded, \"Of course you can.  Take as much time as you need.  I'll give you my card, and if you have any questions, let me know.\"\n\nBefore leaving, she exchanged pleasantries and left a couple copies of a pamphlet about the school.  It seemed pretty nice, but those things always did.\n\nThe next day my parents went shopping, and my brother came out of his room.  \"I heard what she said about you.  I guess I should thank you, but you really are a *freak*, aren't you?\"\n\nThat was the first time that it really hurt when he said it.  He looked angry when he said it, and there was so much scorn and hate packed into a single word.  I wanted to cry, instead I just turned away and started walking to my room.  I had always looked up to my brother, and we may not have always gotten along, but he never looked down on me before today.  He retreated to his room, locking the door.\n\nWhen my parents returned, I told them that I wanted to go.  I was still upset, but I didn't feel like this was my home anymore.  My brother didn't hate mutants, he thought some of them were pretty cool.  He just hated me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter getting to the school, I met with the Professor.  He explained more about what they do.  I knew it was coming, and I wasn't surprised when he asked me if I knew what was going through my head when it happened.  I said that one second we were in the car, about to flip, and I was thinking desperately of some way to save us.  The next second we were on the sidewalk, still next to each other, but watching the car turning over.\n\n\"Can I look into your thoughts, and see if I can make some sense of it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Okay.\" I responded, \"Jean already tried though.\"\n\n\"I know, but I've got a few more years of experience.  Thank you.  Now try to relax...\" he said as he took my head in his hands.\n\nI didn't understand what Jean meant when she described trying to read my mind, but I felt exactly that.  Everything coming all at once, and doing so constantly so it sounded like a crowd of me all talking at once.  Nothing was distinguishable.\n\n\"That's interesting, I've never met a mutant that blocks telepathic ability quite that way.  Do you remember feeling like you were moving before the crash, or being somewhere else?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" I said, scratching my arm.  \"I don't know what I did to make it happen, just that I was scared.\"\n\nSomeone knocked, and a man walked into the room, he was wearing red sunglasses indoors.  \"Hello Scott,\" the Professor said, \"I think we may have another Kurt.\"\n\nHe laughed and said enthusiastically, \"Great!  No sneaking off in the middle of the night to get snacks though.  We know who to look for now.\"  He seemed cheerful as he said it, and I felt a little better now that someone else was in the room to take the Professor's attention.\n\nThe Professor handed him a folder.  \"Could you have Charlie come in?  I wanted to introduce Alex.\"  Scott left and he looked at me, \"We let some of the students that have been here a while show around the new ones.  I think you'll find it's easier to get a tour from someone your age rather than an old man in a wheel chair.\"  He chuckled.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Charlie.\" I heard from behind me.  \"Come on, I'll show you around.\"\n\nWe left the Professor's office, \"Hi, I'm Alex.\"\n\n\"So what're your powers?\"\n\n\"I don't really know.  He said I'm another 'Kurt'?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Charlie responded.  \"You must be able to teleport.  That can get kinda intense.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, Kurt's part of the team that goes out on missions, trying to make a good reputation for Mutants, and trying to stop the bad ones from abusing their powers.  They only let the high-level Mutants go on those, and it's seems really dangerous.  Logan sometimes tells us what happens when they go out.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope I don't have to do that.\" I said.\n\nCharlie laughed, \"Nah, you don't have to be worried about it.  You'd have to have some Omega class powers for them to send you out before you graduate.\"\n\n\"Omega class?\"\n\n\"Yeah, some seriously powerful stuff that would completely change how they do things.  Something like the Professor.  He can take over people's minds if he wants to.  He doesn't, and he always asks before using his powers.\"\n\n\"Wow.  He tried reading my mind though, and he said he couldn't.  Someone named Jean Grey couldn't either.\"\n\nCharlie stopped dead in the hallway, grabbing my shoulders, turning me, and looked at me deadpan, \"You can stop telepaths?  That's amazing!  Most students can't get away with much here, but they would have to catch you in the act.\"  He laughed and started to walk again, talking about some pranks they could pull together.\n\nCharlie could direct air currents.  Not like Storm, who controlled the weather and the wind, , but more precise and direct.  \"I can push a piece of paper through the entire class, and not ruffle anyone's hair.\"  That seemed like a cool power.",

                            "comment": "Part 3:\n\nI was eventually introduced to Kurt, and he asked if I wanted to have some privacy for our first lesson.  It took a bit of time to get used to how he looked, and to understand his accent.  He must've taken my non-answer as me being nervous, which I was, and he asked Charlie to come back in an hour or so.  Charlie said, \"Sure, no problem.  I'll be back with some snacks later!\", and walked off down the hall.\n\nKurt closed the door and said, \"I want you to try concentrating on being over there.\" he pointed to a spot of tape on the ground a few feet away.  \"Like this.\" and in a puff of smoke he was suddenly standing on the spot of tape he had pointed to.  \n\n\"Wow!\"  He just teleported like it was nothing!\n\nHe laughed at me and said, \"It must be different, seeing it from the outside.  But try to think of just being on the spot.\"\n\nI was trying to do like he said, but I didn't think it would work.  When I did it, it wasn't instantaneous like that.  He told me how he has to think about where he wants to be, and how his powers only worked a short distance at first.  After a while, he said, \"It might help if you think of how it happened before.  Putting yourself back in the situation where you used your powers.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I said, and closed my eyes, trying to think of how scared I was, and the way time seemed to slow down when the car went sideways.  I kept trying to make something happen, but I didn't know what I was doing.  I opened my eyes to say it wasn't working, and he was staring at me.  \"Kurt?  Are you okay?\" I asked.  He wasn't moving, and he wasn't responding.  I started walking over to him, and he kept staring at where I was standing before.  I waved my hand in front of his face, and nothing.  No reaction.\n\nI went to the spot and stood.  Nothing happened.  I stood there like an idiot for a few minutes, hoping there was something significant about the mark of tape on the floor that would make everything move again.  \"Well, it worked to get it started, let's see if it can stop it too.\"  Remembering what he said about putting myself in the situation, I remembered what I did when time started going again before.  I tried to relax my entire body, and I felt something like a muscle almost behind my head.  I focused on relaxing that, and Kurt's yell scared me.\n\n\"AMAZING!  You did it!  I must be a better teacher than I thought!\"\n\nI smiled at him, relieved that it worked.  He had me test it out a few more times, and describe to him how I did it.  It was different from him, and I said it was like using a muscle I didn't know about.  He seemed fascinated by my explanation, but I didn't tell him the whole story.  I wasn't lying to him, exactly, I was just letting him believe what he said, and not correcting him.\n\nCharlie came back a little sooner than an hour, and wanted to watch to see how I was getting on with Kurt.  I gave another demonstration, becoming more and more comfortable with my ability.  I'd just freeze everything, walk to where they wanted me to go, and relax.  He said that until the next lesson, he wanted me to work on controlling the use of it.  He told us a funny story about how one night he fell asleep in his bed, and woke up when he accidentally teleported over the pool.  He also warned me not to try pushing any limits just yet, because he knew first hand how dangerous a power like this was, and that it might be possible to teleport to some places that I might not survive, like in the middle of a wall.\n\nI wasn't scared of that since what I did was different from him, but I acted like I was.  Seeing that he made the impression he wanted to, he let us go.\n\nThat night, I couldn't sleep.  I finally thought about what my powers were.  I could stop time.  I could do anything in less than the blink of an eye.  And as I was thinking of all the awesome stuff I could do, it occurred to me.  I might be an Omega class mutant.  I didn't feel so good anymore.  I didn't want to be in danger all the time.  I didn't want to go on missions against other mutants.  I just wanted to make some friends, and have a semi-normal life.  At that point, I resolved to continue to act like I could teleport, but not make it too impressive.  I felt bad for lying to these people who were trying to help me, but I didn't want to die.  This was my secret, and it was safe with me.",

            "comment": "\"Oh shit shit shit. This can't be happening! This CAN'T BE HAPPENING. WHY the HELL I am so clumsy? Shit, shit, shit,\" I screamed as I ran past the tall trees towards the mansion. I had been on a mission else where and had just returned back to the school. My recruitment happened so vaguely. One moment I was on Earth, and suddenly I was teleported to a planet where they needed my ability to freeze time.\n\n\"You look worried? What happened?\" asked the woman running beside me.\n\nI had no time to reply to her question. I was worried sick, my mind was running faster than it could process it's own information. There were a million thoughts in my mind. I should have paid attention to my powers when I had the time and not used it to just play around. And now look where it had got me. The mission, the new Team took me to a planet else where, to see, learn and adapt, to be ready for situation when I would be ready to reveal my real powers. But I had been careless, using my powers to fool people that I could teleport. Everyone in the school though that, they still do. Well I don't know what they think now, it's been a long time. I need to be careful.\n\nI didn't stop, neither did my Aarna who wouldn't leave my side. We have been partner for so long that there was bond between us. And for the past few missions we had made sure we would stick by each other irrespective of the situation we found ourselves in. Our bond transcended time itself.\n\nAs I entered the school a horrific view met my eyes. And the memory came hurtling doen my brain as if it had just happened yesterday. The school looked so quite, serene and beautiful. Yet there was a tragedy at its core that awaited my arrival.\n\n\"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?\" the woman let out a scream:; a genuine response to what she saw.\n\nThe people were frozen at their place and nobody moved around. It was so quite and silent owing to the fact that the time was frozen. Everyone was stuck at their place and it seemed like some supervillain had done this to steal a secret from the school. But it was not a villains mischief, rather a mistake of my own.\n\n\"Why is everyone frozen? Who did this?\" The woman asked.\n\n\"I did,\" I replied under my breath.\n\nShe looked at me with horror in her eyes. She was scared. For the first time we saw what our powers can do.\n\n\"Unfreeze the time then,\" she requested.\n\n\"I can't. I don't know what the sudden unfreeze will do to their bodies,\" I replied.\n\nThe woman look at me in disbelief.\n\n\"It's been 70 years since the FREEZE.\"",

            "comment": "Today is just a normal day, I think to myself. You didn't just get forced off on some bald-headed, wheelchair-ridden professor and your parents still love you. \"Welcome to Xavier's school for gifted youngsters young man,\" some giant blue furry dude with muscles like you'd only see in movies is talking to me. What do I do? \"I hear you will be staying with us for awhile. Well my name is professor McCoy, but most of the students call me Beast. Did you already receive the tour of our lovely facility?\" I nod ny head frantically, this guy could seriously rip me in half without even a second thought! He LOOKS like a beast! \"Outstanding! I'll let you get off to your classes then, wouldn't want you to miss the fun would we?\" He winks and walks away.\n\nI run as fast as I can to the first class of the day in my new school. Some chick named Emma who dresses like a porn star or something is the professor. \"Welcome class, yesterday we went over chapter one in Introduction To Calculus. Today though we have some new students! Let's introduce ourselves, shall we?\" She glances at me and I swear to all that is holy, she could see directly into my mind! 'Hello Kevin,' a man's voice goes off in my head. 'I see you're afraid to share what brings you here, but if you ever need to talk just come to my office.' How reassuring, disembodied voice in my head...\n\nA few of the new people introduce themselves, there's Jason, he wants to go by \"Zeus\" because he can produce electrical sparks. Real original. And then Maria, she doesn't know if she deserves a name because her hands just grow. When I say grow, I mean grow. She showed us and each fist was the size of a Volkswagen bug! Then came Aleeha, her skin turned into stone. Could be useful, I guess. She said her parents and her fled Pakistan when they discovered her x-gene, they were going to stone her. How ironic! A few more people introduced themselves, and then Emma landed her eyes directly on me again. I was so scared that I nearly pissed my pants, not gonna lie. \n\n\"I'm uh... Kevin... And I guess my power is to phase through stuff?\"\n\nEmma looked at me curiously. She's obviously a mind reader, she has to know my power by now. Why did I lie? I guess maybe I'm just scared of the full extent of my curse. Everyone clamoured around me, asking to show my power since everyone else did too. I hesitated and began shifting my molecules at speeds no other being on the planet could match, then phased directly through my seat and landed on my ass in front of the entire class. I still need to work on that one... Everyone had a laugh; of course it had to be at my expense. I hate being the center of attention!\n\n\"Alright everyone, class dismissed! But tomorrow we won't be having this fun time, so don't forget your text books!\" I sighed in relief, Emma didn't tell everyone what I ACTUALLY can do. She must not know after all.\n\nI hear some of my new classmates whispering about how we're being taught by THE telepath Emma Frost. Go figure, she probably read my mind after all and is going to tellb Professor Xavier to kick me out of here.\n\nThe next few classes were a lot more boring, and just my speed. Biology with Beast, astrophysics with Doctor Corbeau, art with Professor Cassidy. I didn't have to deal with others eyes burning into my soul. Which might actually be a mutation one of these kids has, so I need to be extra careful. Finally, it was the last class of the day and I could start to relax. Until this guy named Logan showed up as our professor, that is. \"Alright bub. This is combat 101, every day is gonna be brutal tactical combat training. You're gonna learn to defend yourselves and the people outside and inside these walls!\" The guy was short, maybe five foot two, and he was hairy. Really hairy. He reminded me of Beast in a way, actually. \n\n\"Oh Wolverine, don't scare the kids.\" this girl literally just popped in through the wall. She can ACTUALLY just phase through walls. \"I'm Kitty Pryde, I'm gonna help Wolverine here teach you guys!\" She smiles at me, \"I heard you're able to phase through solid objects. That's a great defensive ability! I'll show you personally how to make it offensive as well!\" she smiles and opens the door to a white room then ushers all of us inside.\n\nWolverine stands in the center of the room, \"Alright professor,\" he grunts, \"Let's get this show on the road. Danger level one.\" \n\nSuddenly the room isn't white anymore, there's bullets and flames shooting everywhere! A buzz saw hits Aleeha in the back just as she encases herself in stone and she goes flying. Jason grabs the saw and I smell ozone as he releases a burst of electricity into the machinery. Maria is smashing a robot with giant claws for hands. And I'm standing in the middle of this doing absolutely nothing! \n\n\"Watch me, Kevin!\" Kitty shouts. A turret fires at her from the front just as a flamethrower blasts her with fire, but the bullets pass straight through her, destroying the flamethrower. \"Now you try.\" \n\nI accelerate myself, I guess it's like a vibration? I just have to move at the right speed so that solid objects pass directly through me, and no one will question a thing. Then I see a buzzsaw about to embed itself directly in professor Wolverine's head. \"Watch out professor!\" I shout, but I'm moving so fast that he probably can't understand a word I said. I smash the saw with my hand, disrupting the atomical structure of the machine and causing the atoms to separate from each other. Miniature atomic explosions start peeling Wolverine's skin from his bones. Was that metal? I swear his bones... They were made of metal?\n\n\"You ain't no phaser, bub.\" Wolverine pants at me. \"Professor, shut it off. We got a situation.\"\n\nSuddenly I'm horrified again. Why did I lie about my powers? They're going to kick me it just like my parents did... \"Follow me bub. We're gonna talk with the Professor.\"\n\nI follow Wolverine through the corridors, silently panicking to myself. They're going to kick me out and I'll be on the streets, I think to myself. My powers are too dangerous and they don't even want me here. \"Don't piss yerself back there.\" Wolverine grunts at me. \"Smell yer fear.\" Seriously, is everyone here a freaking telepath? \n\nFinally we get to a door and Wolverine knocks. \"Come in Logan, Kevin.\" says a voice from behind the door. \"Just rewatching the fascinating display young Kevin showed us in the Danger Room.\" \n\n\"Sorry Prof, but I gotta get back to combat training. Don't want that new kid Jason killing everyone off an' Shadowcat is probably sick of 'em by now.\" Wolverine turns and walks out of the room.\n\n\"Professor, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to lie about my abilities, I was just so scared you were going to kick me out if you knew...\"\n\n\"Now Kevin, why would we do that?\" he looked at me quizzically, \"we are here to nurture your gifts and train you to properly use them. Do you know what your gift is, Kevin?\"\n\n\"Yessir,\" I look him directly in the eyes. For being in a wheelchair, he seems to have the stature of a man twenty feet tall. I'm more intimidated now than I have ever been in my life. \"I can move really fast, I run fast, and I can see the atoms in everything. I can even control them if I move fast enough.\"\n\n\"Kevin, you're a speedster, that is your gift,\" \n\n\"I've never heard of a speedster, except maybe that weird guy. Scarlet Witch's brother. What's his name again? Oh! Quicksilver! I've seen him go around the entire world in the blink of an eye! Actually, when I first discovered my abilities I wanted to see if I could go just as fast as him. But I think I was able to go faster... I'm sorry professor, I'm rambling.\"\n\n\"That's quite alright, Kevin,\" he chuckles, \"From what I saw in the danger room, your gift is much stronger than Quicksilver's. You may very well be the most powerful mutant in this entire school! With enough training, your speed would be able to alter the very laws of physics!\"\n\nI stare at Professor Xavier dumbfounded. My powers? The most powerful? How is that even possible? I just move fast! \"I see you're having trouble understanding that, come here Kevin. I want you to do something.\" I walk towards the Professor tentatively, unsure of what I could possibly do. \"Grab the handles of my chair, and run as quickly as you can. Focus on your surroundings, and pick a stopping point when you choose.\" \n\nI do as he asks and start running around the room. I notice that I'm moving so quickly that we are literally upside down, on the walls, on the ceiling, everywhere at once! Then I notice that Wolverine is quickly moving forward and in reverse at the exact same time. Startled, I stop just before Wolverine was about to walk out the door of the Professor's office. \"Did... Did we just time travel?\" again, I'm stricken overwhelmed and confused.\n\n\"Yes Kevin, this is what I mean by you can change the laws of physics. You were able to create thousands of copies of us, travel forward AND backwards in time, and render gravity meaningless. All at the same time no less! You are what is known as an omega level mutant, and you will no doubt thrive here with training and conditioning.\"\n\n\"Professor, can we...\" how do I ask this? I don't want to disappoint him. He is probably the nicest person I've ever met!\n\n\"Yes my boy, we can keep this between us. Until you're ready, that is. I was hoping you would take me up on my offer to move you into the advanced classes though, you'll get your own uniform and codename. You'll also get to go on missions with the X-Men,\" did he just wink at me? \"I was thinking maybe Blink, but that may be used at the moment. How about Light?\"\n\nI smile. Light. It's perfect.",

            "comment": "Being the best of the best at school usually comes with its perks and advantages but this school was a little bit different. Being at the top of the class here means danger, and a whole lot of it and that\u2019s something Deshaun wasn\u2019t ready for just yet. Everyone had a specific power here and ever since the debacle with Phoenix and the outside world warming up to mutants a little it was important that those with incredible ability be labeled \u201c Omega Class Mutants\u201d. So him lying about his powers made more sense when he explained it like that to professor xavier.\n\n\n\nDeshaun was at the back of the classroom listening to the lecture on human/mutant relations and jotting down notes when he looked up and the slide was changing and he needed this information. So he snapped his finger and time froze, allowing him to write down everything he wanted and to look at the girls paper next to him and copy her notes too. He snapped again and everything went back to normal as it usually does. He had done this in class only once or twice before as he didn\u2019t want a teacher or the professor to find out the truth. Deshaun knew he was a omega level mutant and it scared him to death. He heard the stories of the persecution, the missions, the stress it can take on those that are as strong as him and he didn\u2019t want that. He knew he couldn\u2019t handle it \n\n\nClass continued for a little while longer as Deshaun began to look out the window and saw the array of students in the pavilion. Different color skin, hair color, texture, some had different body parts as well, it was a odd and lovely ecosystem at the school. As the professor dismissed class he asked for a girl to stay behind while everyone else went back to the dorms. Deshaun suspected that she was a omega level mutant herself and that she would be brought into the new team. Once the school got renamed the jean gray institute various members of the old team either became instructors or in the case of kitty pride decided to head the next generation of the x men. You could find old members around campus but it was best for Deshaun to go about his day as normal as possible. One wrong move and he\u2019s swept up in this storm of missions and coordinated suits. \n\nHe returned to his dorm hi fived his roommate Tyler and did his homework. Tyler could mess with electrical circuits and disable stuff all day long and he was the only person that knew about Deshaun\u2019s actual power. Tyler asked him if he still had to slow down time to copy notes when a knock came on the door and it was The professor alongside kitty pride and the girl from his earlier class. Kitty pride pointed at him telling the professor \u201c I\u2019ve been telling you for weeks Charles\u201d while the girl stood there visibly shaken up. The professor said hello to Tyler and looked Deshaun in the eyes and said \u201c Deshaun me and Ms Pride have to speak with you and Amber in my quarters if that\u2019s okay with you\u201d Deshaun wanted to snap so badly and try to find a way of escaping the inevitable but even he can run out of time.",

If I have all this power, why don't I save everyone? Why is there strife?\n\nI don't know Karen, why'd you scream at that McDonalds worker for giving you five cents wrong in change? It's not *my* fault there's strife, I shouldn't have to fix everything.\n\nAnyway, no one knew, in the life I started across the country from my home. But like I said, I'm fourteen. Not exactly the cautious type, and someone saw me \"teleport\". Well, that's better than everyone knowing I can freeze all of time while I continue to move, so now here I am. In a class full of mutants, with a head professor who can read minds, lying about my powers.\n\nI've made some friends here. I still don't trust them with the truth, but it's fun to mess about together. We get in trouble a lot, but I also help us avoid trouble sometimes.\n\nThen one day, some asshole decided to fight me. Like, why me? Sure I called your mom a whore, but that's no reason to try to *kill* me, mister knife manipulator.\n\nAnyway, one thing lead to another and now I'm in Xavier's office. I *could* just pause time and leave, but what's the point? I'd let it resume eventually.\n\nXavier spoke, \"Trystan, you're not a teleporter.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nHe nods, but smiles at me. \"I hoped you would tell me on your own, but your *incident* with Jehovah fast tracked this conversation. I've known since you arrived.\"\n\nI couldn't speak. If he'd known, why hadn't he said so? Maybe he misunderstands, he thinks I'm just able to pause time temporarily. Yes, maybe I'll get him to stick to that assumption.\n\n\"Trystan, I don't need to read your mind to know that whatever you're about to say is a lie. Please, truthfully tell me what you can do.\"\n\nCrap. Well, might as well. Nothing better to do.\n\n...\n\n\nTurns out, there was plenty better to do. I'd heard about Xavier's track record with the greater good, I should've just lied. As much as he might have learned his lessons, my power was far too tempting.\n\n...\n\nI was wrong about being a god. Even most of them were bound by time, and the few that weren't were well beneath my power. Eternity sucks, alone.\n\n...\n\nA single mind reached into mine from across infinity, leaving a single phrase in its wake. *The Elder Gods understand. Come to us.*\n\nEdit: Read up on Galactus and realized he didn't fit that last message, changed it.",

            "comment": "\"All I'm saying, time control and shitty  teleportation: two different things, but the first one is more unoriginal and harder to hide.\" I half-listened as the red spandex-clad man blabbered on next to me. \"And the second one is cliche and boring.\" He continued as he crossed his legs and shifted in search of a more comfortable position on the tiled roof. \"And --\" He continued, reaching for the box currently stuck floating in the air to pick up another slice of pizza, letting the grease and cheese hover in the air. \"You're fucked either way kiddo.\"\n\n\"And what do you suggest I do, since you're suddenly a genius with this?\" I raised an eyebrow, munching on my own slice with far less enthusiasm than Deadpool.\n\n\"Say sayonara, pack your bags and run with the wind kid.\" He answered, spitting crumbs as he spoke. \"Or, you tell them of your time power and get wrecked by ol 'angry hair badger' in his training drills.\" He concluded by scarfing down half of the slice in one bite.\n\nI swallowed down my food and sigh, looking down at the crusty edges of my slice.\n\nSpilling the beans about my powers would mean certain death or dismemberment, possible torture and get treated like a lab rat, not to mention I would lose out on a chance of regular life; would lose the chance at a dream job in bioengineering, my own house with a picket fence, and future Rottweiler puppies.\n\nBut at the same time, the teachers were beginning to push me to 'teleport' to greater distances. Hell, today they had me 'teleport' all around the school, and then I had to try and not look like I had just run half a bloody marathon! I mean, I can't keep living like this!\n\nYou know you've fucked up when motherfucking Deadpool becomes the voice of reason.\n\nI clenched my teeth and snapped my fingers, a small part of me feeling satisfaction as I watched the leftover piece of cooked bread turn to dust in the span of milliseconds it took for time to speed back up. And with another snap of the fingers, time stopped again. With the pizza box having fallen what looked like a few centimeters.\n\n\"That was a perfectly good pizza man!\" Deadpool scolded me, going on a rant about good pizza or something like that, I don't know, I tuned him out halfway as I rested my chin on my knee. \n\nThat was another part of my so-called 'great' power. I could bring anything or anyone with me when I froze time by touching them, but anything organic will decompose and turn to dust on the way back. Learned that the hard way with the neighbor's dog. Poor Rover.\n\nI sighed and checked my watch. The arrows were stuck on 1:34 AM, taking into account how long we've been talking it would have been somewhere around 5 in the morning if I hadn't stopped time. \"I think it's time for you to go Wade.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm no longer wanted an I?\" He put a hand to his chest, dramatizing how insulted he was by fake wiping away a tear. Despite that, his mouth was twisted into a grin, \"But, I get you, I must leave for the plot to continue. Ain't that right, author?\" He turned his head to stare straight ahead of him as if he was looking at someone else.\n\nI raised an eyebrow, sighed, and shook my head. I will never understand this guy. \"You're fucking insane, and I'm as mad as a damn hatter for talking to you.\" Rolling my eyes I grabbed the box with the leftover pizza with one hand and touched Wade's foot with my elbow before I snapped my fingers.\n\n\"That's the only way we can have fun kiddo!\" He laughed, unfazed by his leg rapidly degrading down to dust and regenerating back like it was nothing a few seconds later. Meanwhile, the pizza box turned to dust and a bit of sludge which fell to the ground.\n\n\"You're insufferable,\" I smirked and pushed him off, hearing the big idiot crash hard onto the ground before I jumped down too. Snapping my fingers in rapid succession I was able to slow down my fall. You can stop time, and by the extent gravity, but not velocity.\n\nVelocity is a bitch.\n\nI landed on the ground and with a slap on Wade's back, froze time for a final time for a short while. I grunted, my fingers beginning to hurt slightly from the constant use.\n\nMy thoughts wandered back to my situation. I was essentially a powerful mutant downplaying my powers with a bunch of telepathy wielding mutants around to ready to call bullshit on whoever tries to lie. And I'm shit at lying.\n\nMeanwhile, Wade continued to talk as we walked down the road towards the gates, seemingly without having to take in any air while he blabbering about...chimichangas?\n\n\"What did you smoke before coming here, Wade?\" I asked, gently elbowing him in the ribs when we were far enough to be out of the security systems range.\n\n\"Nothing you don't!\" He laughed, a big grin on his face. His laughter was infectious and soon enough I was laughing with him. But my amusement died down when the problem of my situation came back to the forefront of my mind.\n\n\"Thanks for the talk, Wade.\" I tried to keep up my smile, but it was far too strained, and my eyes wandered down, suddenly finding my boots far more interesting than Deadpool.\n\nI looked up when I felt him place a hand on my shoulder, the weight was solid, steady and warm; grounding. \"Anytime, Alex.\" He smiled, warmer now, like a friend.\n\nI smiled and touched his arm, snapping my fingers to speed time back up. I watched him leave on a, most likely, stolen motorcycle, before stoping time again and going back to the school, resuming it only when I was in one of the gardens.\n\nI sighed and walked over to a bench, plopping down on it like a sack of potatoes. Fishing out a joint of weed I lit it up a lighter. Stuffing the lighter back into my pocket I inhaled deeply, letting the smoke escape my nose and mouth.\n\nThis shit wasn't fair, my life had been perfectly normal until my powers showed up and ruined everything. Why did I have to become a bloody freak of nature? Why couldn't it have been someone else! There were enough kids here willing to risk their lives if only their mutations weren't shit, someone among them would have been better suited to use my powers.\n\nBut no! It had to be me!\n\n\"This isn't fucking fair!\" I hissed through my teeth and clenched my fist.\n\nOh, bugger.\n\nI sighed and relaxed my fist, leaning over to drop the half-smoked joint into the trash can. No point in feeling butthurt about what you can't change.\n\nI stood up and was about to head back to the school when I heard a branch snap near me. \"Hello?\" I called, looking around wildly. \"Who's there?\"\n\nThat's when I saw a red light shining in from the darkness, and when I looked down, my chest was painted by red dots. \"Hey, what are you!\"\n\nI snapped my fingers just as a gunshot rang in my ears. I think it was blind luck that the bullets were floating in the air and not in my chest.\n\nI took a step back, looking up to look at the soldiers, frozen in time. Thoughts of running crossed my mind, but then I looked back at the school, where multiple kids slept unaware of everything, I suddenly found myself in an unforgiving mood.\n\nNo; I was pissed.\n\nClenching my teeth at my stupid idea, which might end up in my death, I walked around the bullets and towards the soldiers. Positioning myself in front of one soldier, I unfroze time and upercutted him, freezing time before others could react. I went to the other one and kicked him in the family jewels between stopping and continuing time.\n\nBut as I was going to freeze time, one of them grabbed me. I yelped and stumbled, crashing into 4 more as I froze time. I stumbled and turned around, watching in horror as the 5 soldiers looked around in confusion, before training their weapons on me. Not knowing what to do I snapped my fingers again, unfreezing time.\n\nAnd had the front row seat to the horrific sight of the soldiers violently decomposing, their screams cutting out halfway as they turned to piles of dust and horrid smelling sludge on the ground.\n\n\"Well, that's a new one bub.\" A gruff voice spoke, \"Told you this one was lying.\"\n\nI whirled around, eyes growing wide when I saw my teachers standing behind me. I tried to come up with something to say, but nothing left my mouth.\n\n\"I believe, Alexander, we have some things we need to discuss,\" Xavier spoke calmly, despite the fact I had just murdered 5 people!\n\nI was so fucked.",

            "comment": "\"Jonathan, might I have a word?\"\n\nJames rapped his knuckle against the side of the door frame, peering into Jon's room. He sighed as he regarded the other boy, drenched in sweat, biceps bulging, arm straining against the weight of the dumbbell.\n\nJon gave James a pointed look as he set down his weight. Despite his youth, he was well-trained. A balanced physique and a virtuous spirit. James wasn't the first of Jon's colleague to ask his counsel. \"That's a long sigh, Jamie. How are you holding up?\"\n\nJames rolled his eyes. \"Oh, I'm perfectly fine. I was merely... surprised to find that you had continued to keep up with your regiment. It does explain why we see so little of each other outside of class.\"\n\nJon laughed. \"Sorry, man. It just takes a lot to maintain these bad boys. But sure, what's up?\"\n\nJames frowned. \"I was hoping to speak in private.\"\n\nJon held eye contact. \"You're asking a lot of me, Jamie. Is this about something big?\"\n\n\"Quite.\" James's voice took on a hard edge. \"If you would please...\"\n\n\"Sure, no problem. Just wanted to make sure it wasn't for a prank or something.\" Jon closed his eyes momentarily. Color bleached out of the world around them. The trees outside the window swayed, then slowed, then stopped. \"You got a minute.\"\n\n\"I'm leaving the academy, Jonathan.\" James spoke in a level tone, but quickly, precisely. As Jon's eyes widened, James held out his hand. \"Jonathan, please. I would like to use your minute well.\n\n\"I felt a certain kinship knowing there was another student at the academy that could manipulate time, and I thank you for keeping my secret. You have respected my wish to keep my reasons for my lie to myself but I am now ready to disclose those. Simply put, I strongly suspected that here was another mutant that could stop time. That happens to be you.\"\n\nThirty seconds. Jon furrowed his brow but did not interrupt.\n\n\"I have reason to suspect that you are the source of my power. The fact that you can move within this paused time all but confirms it for me: in my past life I've found that to be the case.\"\n\n\"What do you-\"\n\n\"Surely you've felt as though the pieces don't quite fit, Jonathan?\" A cold smile played at the corners of James's mouth. \"Surely you realize that you aren't *just* an American oaf. Perhaps you've dreamed of your idiot father's English estate, or that wretched dog.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about Danny like that!\" Jonathan's accent began to slip. \"Wha-\"\n\n\"And our minute is up, Jonathan Joestar.\" James smirked as the color began to leach back into the frozen world. But just as movement began to unstick objects from the frozen word, sound and movement ceased all at once.\n\n\"The World.\"\n\n\"You're... Dio.\"\n\n\"Yes. Ronny James. I thought I was being cute with that pseudonym, but I was hoping that you would catch on without my hinting. Your one minute of time might have impressed me some years back. To my present self, it's a paltry sum. Shaping time is but a curiosity when so much more of reality is at my command.\"\n\nA golden titan accreted from the air next to him, seven feet tall, muscle-bound, hostile. Jonathan raised his guard.\n\n\"Oh, I mean you no harm, Jonathan. I brought you here to speak as acquaintances, if not as equals. Tell me... what do you think of this world that I've built around you?\"\n\nJonathan narrowed his eyes. \"Dio, what is your plot in all this? Why would you go to such lengths? You killed me on the ship. Was that not enough for you?\"\n\nDio grit his teeth. \"It nearly was. But at your last moment, you forgave me. You, the wretch who always stood in my shadow, a lumbering brute who escaped to archaeology so you could be closer to the dirt that you are.\"\n\nHe stalked forward, his eyes burning pure fury. \"Do I look that small to you, Jonathan Joestar? Do I look that weak? That wretched? That pitiable? Your death means nothing if your spirit does not submit to me.\"\n\nHe drew back.\n\n\"So I built this world as a game for us to enjoy. Even now, ripped out of your previous life, marginalized as a mutant, you have found ways to excel and succeed. A way to belong.\" Dio snarled. But his anger subsided. \"I despise you, Jonathan Joestar. Even when your born-winner status is stripped you still have the spirit of an utmost gentlemen. Over the years I have come to respect you as an adversary. It is for that reason that I permit you still to move in my stopped time.\"\n\nDio smashed the doorframe with a casual brush of his knuckle. The shrapnel flew, then stopped mid-air. \"I've conquered the sun, Jonathan. Reality as well. I've mastered this stand with such subtlety that you can only dream of achieving in your lifetime. I know that you still yearn to defeat me. Cultivate your meager power. Challenge me when you are ready. I will take on all your power and still you will lose.\"\n\nHe smirked as he saw the color beginning to leach out of Jonathan. \"It seems that this is your current limit. Do not worry. I'm willing to wait. In the meanwhile, I will have this Magneto fellow to amuse myself with. Another time, Jojo.\"",

            "comment": "\"What's up, Diego\"\n\n\"Nothing, Mr Summers\" he said rolling his eyes. If he was any other mutant Scott would've ignored him, but Diego, or as his classmates called him, Dio, was special. He had the special ability of teleportation, which in itself is extremely rare, but unlike his friend Kurt, Diego could do it effortlessly. He could even go to places he hadn't been before, even different countries! But what was more perplexing about the young Mr Brando, was his abnormal levitation ability. Of course, this was kept secret. If Magneto found out, Diego would be in great danger. Scott had seen Diego's secret ability. He could lift anything, from road rollers to cranes. Given a couple years, Diego could become the greatest mutant in history.\n\n\"Cool, cool\" It was always awkward to talk to the kid \"Anyway, the Professor wants to talk\" \n\n\"Ok, sir. I'll go there now\" And suddenly Diego disappeared. No smoke or a trace he had ever been there. It was disorientating, to say the least. \n\n\"I guess I'll go to Jean. See what she's doing\" Scott said before walking away.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------\\*\\*\\*-------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\"You wished to see me sir?\" Diego asked curtly.\n\n\"Oh Dio! Don't scare me like that!\" Xavier chuckled \"Yes, well I called you here today, to discuss your powers.\" They were the most mystifying aspect of the boy. No one could really decipher how his mutation worked. Not even Beast. Well, until now that is.\n\n\"Diego\" Said a gruff voice, coming from behind Diego. There appeared the bluest and greatest scientist on the planet. Beast.\"After almost 5 years since you arrived in front of the academy, we've finally deciphered your DNA and mutation\" He said excitedly.\n\n\"And it appears that you've been lying to us\" Xavier continued \"You don't have a trace of mutant DNA which is even close to Kurt's. In fact, your DNA, is closest to Shadowcat's. A time skimmer\" He said almost angrily \"You can control time can't you? Although that doesn't explain the telekinesis.\"\n\n\"How about I show you two\" Diego said, nonchalantly \"Come closer to me\" And they did. Both men with their hands on Diego's shoulder.\n\n# \"THE WORLD!\" \n\nSuddenly the entire room turned black and white. \"What happened?\" Xavier said. He looked down to his watch \"By god...\" Time had stopped.\n\nBeast turned to Diego \"Dio! This is amazing! We could defeat Magneto with thi-\" Suddenly Beast was cut off. Xavier turned to blue man quickly and was shocked at what he saw. A giant, gaping wound through his chest and a giant, fist which could only be seen thanks to the blood. \n\n\"DIO! WHAT HAPPENED!\" Xavier shouted, looking distraught and terrified for the first time in his life. He stared at Dio but was met with a cruel, sadistic smile.  \n\n\"I'm sorry Professor, I can't have you knowing I'm an Omega level. Not with my plans!\" He laughed, almost manicly.\n\n\"Damn you boy!\" Xavier said before using his power. If he could just break the Dio's mind, he could possibly save himself. Alas, instead of victory, he too was met with hole through the chest. \"H-howww...\" He said, his final word drifting.\n\n\"Did you truly think that you could be me! I, Dio Brando! I have been training forever for this moment! Of course I wanted to do it from the beginning, but I wasn't strong enough. I really must thank for the training! Instead of 10 seconds, I can do 10 years! It truly is marvellous!\" Dio shouted \"Now, I really must leave.\" And with that, he left the bloodied room. \n\n# \"THE WORLD!\"\n\n*Tick Tock.* Time started again.\n\nDio opened the door and let the most loudest scream he could. Suddenly, almost all the mutants in the manor arrived. \"What's the matter Diego?\" Asked Storm. \n\nAll Dio did was point to the room. \"Oh my god\" screamed Jean, staring in shock as the two lifeless corpses laid on the ground. \n\nSuddenly, everyone pushed forward, attempting to save the mutants. Dio snuck behind them all. And as they all started letting tears out, Dio smiled. He smiled as he was one step closer to his dream. **APOCALYPSE.**",

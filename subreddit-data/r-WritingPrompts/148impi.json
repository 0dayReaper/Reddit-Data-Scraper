            "comment": "The Goddess of Peace, whose name was long forgotten by the mortals of New York City, watches over a little cafe in Brooklyn. The little shop, located where the ancient goddess was birthed from her mother and father, enjoys her perpetual aura.\n\nPresently, Dave walks several paces away from his wife, Martha, who is extremely upset with him. He forgot her coffee thermos at home, a fact she was making sure he\u2019d remember.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that fucking hard.\u201d Martha said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Dave said. \u201cI know I should have remembered it. I know it\u2019s not okay. Look, I\u2019ll get you a coffee from this cafe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you will.\u201d Martha said.\n\nDave approached the counter and ordered her frappadappacino as she sat. He brought it over, preparing another apology in his mind.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Martha smiled sweetly as she took the drink.\n\nDave blinked, surprised.\n\n\u201cSure, babe.\u201d He said. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nMartha leaned against his shoulder.\n\n\u201cWhat a lovely little shop.\u201d Martha said. \u201cSo quaint. Look!\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the Elvis booth, to a photo of him making quite a sexy face.\n\nMartha laughed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be attractive?\u201d Martha raised her left lips in a joking sexy smile, then burst out laughing.\n\nDave cracked a nervous smile.\n\n\u201cGuess so.\u201d He said, breathing heavily from his nose.\n\nMartha nuzzled in closer to Dave, who put an arm around her.\n\n\u201cYou smell good.\u201d She purred.\n\nDave leaned down to kiss her forehead, feeling like he was back in highschool, just originally courting Martha.\n\n\u201cHere, try my drink.\u201d Martha motioned to her frappadappacino.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d Dave said, licking the foam from his lips.\n\n\u201cLet me help you.\u201d Martha winked, leaning in to kiss.\n\nThey made out like college kids, Dave taking copious squeezed of her breasts and bum. Dave took in her smell, the deep lavender perfume she loved, and felt utterly content.\n\nThey simply hugged for a time, enjoying each others warmth.\n\n\u201cThanks for coming!\u201d The barista said as they opened the door to leave. \u201cHave a good one!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou too!\u201d Dave and Martha called back.\n\nThey had just reached the street corner when Martha scoffed.\n\nDave turned to see her glowering angrily.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you forgot my coffee.\u201d She said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for helping you remember these basic things!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, dear.\u201d Dave said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nMartha rolled her eyes, walking several paces in front of Dave.",

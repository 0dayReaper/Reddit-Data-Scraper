            "comment": "\u201cI love you, grandpa,\u201d my youngest grand-daughter, Sherry, said as she squeezed my hand.\n\nI looked up at those emerald green eyes she had gotten from me, at my entire family\u2019s as the heart machine\u2019s slow beats gently faded. Eighty years had passed by in a blink of an eye. When I had been Sherry\u2019s age, I had thought myself invincible. Then, at forty, I had worried constantly about death, thinking through sleepless nights about it. But now, I realized that it wasn\u2019t so bad. Because if there was ever a scene to immortalize, to be my last, it would be this. Sherry, her bright green eyes glistening with tears, my children and grandchildren all around me as the heart beat monitor lulled me to a gentle and permanent sleep.\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d I told them all and I closed my eyes.\n\nMy eyes opened.\n\n\u201cHow was the trip?\u201d a familiar voice asked from beside me.\n\nI looked around at the purple moss smothering the rolling hills and the campfire burning in front of me. On my lap was a bong. At last, I remembered. My name had never been Terry, it was Zor\u2019oah.\n\n\u201cYo, dude, you back with us?\u201d Galmroh said, snapping purple fingers in front of my face.\n\nI coughed and nodded. Seventeen eyes looked at me from the six people sitting around the campfire. Just as I had wished as fifty-year old Terry, I had gotten my time back. Zor\u2019oah was a freshman in high school who finally got invited by the popular kids into a drug-fueled camping adventure. Three boys, three girls, and a lot of \u201c*you can\u2019t blame me for that, I was high*\u201d.\n\nGalmroh and Sardak had already paired up, leaving me with Sierrah, the reason I had agreed to come. She now looked at me with sharp blue eyes, a small grin on her lips. Her purple hair had pink streaks across it that dangled off her head and curved into her chest like directions on where to direct your eyes.\n\n\u201cSo Zor\u2019oah, how was it? Tell us all the things you did,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cBet you can\u2019t beat me,\u201d Galmroh said, his chest inflating with pride. \u201cMy first trip, I enslaved an entire race and forced them to build these stupid triangles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least he can\u2019t do as bad as Sardak\u2019s first trip. He was just a slave. At least he killed someone before his trip ended.\u201d Sierrah said.\n\nThey turned to me again, waiting to hear of all my misdeeds. \u201cI was a man named Terry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd um\u2026 I met this girl named Sarah.\u201d\n\nSierrah\u2019s smile grew. \u201cSarah, eh? Tell us, what nasty things did you do to this *Sarah*?\u201d\n\nBlood rushed to my face, burning it a deep violet. \u201cI married her,\u201d I said.\n\nGalmroh choked on a breath. Sardak burst out laughing. The rest of the girls only furrowed their brows.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I knew I should stop. I had spent an entire semester trying to join this circle and continuing the Life of Terry was social suicide. But someone had to know of that first kiss with Sarah, the look in her eye staring at our first child together, and the tears in Sherry\u2019s eyes when she told me her final goodbye.\n\nSo I told them, my voice tinged with pride. At the end of my story, I was the only one smiling and my smile stretched from cheek to cheek.\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d Galmroh said, awe in his voice. \u201cThat was\u2026 super lame.\u201d\n\nEverybody burst into collective laughter.\n\n\u201cYou did even worse than me on my first trip!\u201d Sardak howled. \u201cYou\u2019re such a wimp! Why are you even here?\u201d\n\nI nodded to that one. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, talking to myself. \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I pushed myself up and walked back toward my spaceship.\n\nLaughter followed me the entire way, but I didn\u2019t care. I opened the hatch of my spaceship and was just about to get in when I heard, \u201cZor\u2019oah!\u201d\n\nI turned to find Sierrah. She hunched over, panting, one of the buttons on her blouse undone. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to run. I mean, your trip was totally lame, but your next one\u2019ll be better. Plus\u201d\u2014she bit her bottom lip and her eyes grew big\u2014\u201cyou don\u2019t want to be the only virgin in school, do you?\u201d\n\nBeneath the starry sky, the silver luminescence of our twin moons, I recognized the glint in her eyes and for a single second, they were a brighter green than any emerald in the world.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I told the most beautiful girl in my high school and slipped into my spaceship. \u201cBy the way, the trip wasn\u2019t lame.\u201d\n\nMy engines roared to life and I flew off into the twilight. There were a trillion stars above me and I knew that around one of them, on one planet, was a girl with wild grassy eyes still clutching her grandpa\u2019s hand. There had to be. Tears filled my eyes as I flew back home.\n\nFiction or not, it was the most real thing I had ever done.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for 5+ stories weekly and ~200 stories already written!\n ",

That was surprisingly moving for such a short story.\n\nThere are only two things that put me off in the story that I'd like to mention. First, and others have mentioned this already, the granddaughter using his first name is a bit strange given our social norms. Secondly, and this is just a personal opinion, I found it strange that you made it a point to mention that the female alien's eyes shone such a bright green. It reminded me of the green in the granddaughter's eyes and I expected some kind of connection there, but it ended up being non-important outside of situational detail. This isn't a big deal really, but it did pull me out of the story there at the end, and the ending was where your story really brought the emotion out of the reader, so it did take a little of that away for me.\n\nDo know that I'm only trying to give constructive criticism, all in all, I thought your story was absolutely amazing, and I will absolutely be going through your post history to read more of your work.\n\nEdit: typographical error",

I and my partner began pushing one of the several needed blocks to finish the top level. This stone was much larger than the rest, we estimated around 9 tons. With ropes attached and men in place we began to slide it up the slope. I had always prided myself on being one of the stronger laborers but today I was sluggish from a cut and infected toe, which was apparent as the men groaned in agony trying to move the stone. The harder I pushed the more pain I felt in my foot and towards my big toe. I couldn't take it anymore. The Pharoah set his gaze upon me as I let out a blood curdling shriek. The stone stopped, I stopped, and my partner began pushing with all his might to hold it in place. The men with ropes let out a howl as they gave it one more pull with every last ounce of strength they had left. We were at the top now, when suddenly, the rope snapped. My partner jumped off the slope as the stone went right over my feet and crushed my body. I felt a rush of intense pain like an ocean wave crashing over me. Every nerve ending released its self with the maximum amount of pain as they shut off, one by one, from my feet to my head. In an instant there was darkness.\n\n I opened my eyes to find I had no emotions. The feelings I had been experiencing were gone. 3857364htugut736, with his cyborg dreadlocks made from cables and wires, gazed into my glowing red eyes. We stared for what felt like an eternity as I thought of absolutely nothing. An entire sun was birthed and exploded in the time I waited. Finally, as if nothing had happened, he extended his dreads towards mine and we connected. I had noticed he was connected with others as well. I heard no words, but got a strong feeling inside. A burning sensation could be felt under my eyelids as I began to have the uncontrollable urge to ask \"how was it?\" How was it I thought? How was what, the painful yet beautiful biological life of a human? The tedious task of eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, reproducing, birthing, happiness, and sadness. I had never experienced time in such a fast pace. I had never thought it were possible to feel emotions. \n\n3857364htugut736 nodded, and took a hit from the neon blue glowing bong.  Another sun was birthed, and as I watched it over the course of millions of years develop, I couldn't help but realize, I felt nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: never done this before I'm absolutely not a writer. I'm going through a really rough divorce and can't see my kids right now. Writing this took my mind off things for a bit and reading the stories here made me cry a lot which felt good. Thanks for reading I hope someone out there actually enjoyed that. I think I have grammar problems and tense problems.",

How was the trip?\" I was confused. \"Who-who are you?

Just relax man.\" I wheezed, coughing at the smell of whatever drugs these fuckers we're taking. \"My wife... My grandchildren... where the hell are they!? And why do I have this- bong!?\" I flailed my arms out, only to be horrified at the sight of tentacles. \n\n\"Holy shit...\" Everything started coming back to me. I was a Goactzrim of Sector 75x, within the Andromeda Galaxy. I was four hundred thousand years old, fairly young for my species, but well beyond my \"human years\".\n\nI was also a stoner.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, you won't fucking believe what I just went through, Eziblierg! I was a... human? They're like the primates of this planet, but they're bi-pedal like us. I had a whole family, went through school, owned a Yacht... All on this planet called \"Earth\". Damn man, I almost forgot I was a Goactzrim for a second there. You gotta stay off that shit, it's dangerous!\" I laughed. Mercuto looked at me, a bit shocked. \"Did you say you were a human- when you hit that stuff!? Dude...\" I was a bit confused. \"What about it? It's probably some made up shit anyways.\"\n\n\"No, I'm serious. Like 10 minutes ago, DNN just reported that they've found some alien technology on H-356... Its got the name, 'Voyager 1.'\" I freaked out. \"Yo! I remember that shit, they launched it back in the 70s! You probably don't even know what the '70s' is, now that I think about it...\" Mercuto grew pale. \"DUDE QUIT FREAKING ME OUT!\" He was visibly shivering. \"The hell's your problem man?\" Eziblierg asked. \"You need to keep that shit to yourself man... don't let the council hear you talking about that! Fuck, fuck, fuck...\" \n\nThere was a knock at our door. When nobody answered, the door was kicked down. Empress Mayogria stood before us, with fifteen armed officers beside her. \"Papi Azcleim? We need you, and that capsule of yours. Now.\"\n",

            "comment": "I looked around at all of my loved ones at my literal deathbed. I could see their love, their pain, and their held back tears as i breathed my last few breaths. My little granddaughter could hold it in any longer and threw herself on me, sobbing uncontrollably. I smiled weakly and stroked her hair.\n\n\"Hush now, my little bobcat.\" I lifted her chin gently, her puffy red eyes meeting mine. \n\n\"Will I ever see you again?\" She asked between sniffles, her brown hair long and matted from the countless days she sat at my bedside. I weakly reached out and touched her chest.\n\n\"I will be right there. I will always be with you.\" This brought on a fresh bout of tears. She was now truly sobbing uncontrollably, her face buried in my chest. I went back to stroking her hair. \n\n\"I know. I know.\" I said gently. Eventually, she got a hold of herself, the tears held back by an iron will. For a six year old, Marcy was pretty strong. I chuckled to myself. She was just like her mother.\n\nI felt my life slipping away, and I looked in my granddaughters big eyes one last time. \"Just remember, sweetie...\" I struggled for another breath, but i had to give her closure. If she didn't have it, it would destroy her. \"That I will always love you.\" With that I closed my eyes, and faintly heard her starting to cry again. I wanted more than anything to hold her, to tell her everything was going to be alright. But i couldn't. It was my time to go. I felt my body relax, and everything sank into blissful oblivion.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\nTroivan? Trovian! TROVIAN!\n\nI groaned and attempted to sit up. I surrounded by strange beings. They all had spikes instead of hair, and dots on their faces, and pale skin. One of them caught me and eased me back onto the mat I had been lying on. \n\n\"Not so fast there, my man. You took a pretty big hit of those wastions. Give it a few, alright?\" \n\nI nodded weakly and laid still, trying to ignore the throbbing in my head. My vision was hazy, but I could sort of make out where I was. I was in some sort of cavern. The mat I was lying on felt like a sleeping bag. I was dimly aware of a warmth coming from my right side. Was I... camping?\n\nMy eyes started to clear, and my hearing was coming back.\n\n\"...be alright. He took *waaay* more than he should have for his first time, but he took it like a champ.\" That voice. I know that voice. Who was it. I racked my foggy mind, trying to remember who that was. \n\n\"You sure? He looks... well... like he got hit by a Trynagog.\" I knew that voice too. It was decidedly different, but full of motherly concern. It sounded female. Was she my girlfriend? Friend? Fuck. I can't remember.\n\n\"Hey...\" I said in a hoarse whisper. There was immediate movement, and the second voice floated into my head. \n\n\"Yes? What is it?\" She asked. He face swam above my head. She was decidedly pretty. She had amber eyes, extremely pale skin, and the dots on them made a lovely pattern. Her thin mouth and brow were textbook expressions of concern. \n\n\"My...my...\" My voice failed me, so i gestured weakly to about where my throat would be. Her eyebrows shot up.\n\n\"Oh! I am so sorry honey. Rythor, do have that energy drink?\" \n\n\"Shit, I forgot about that. Hold on.\" I heard a dragging sound, and some stuff being pushed around, and then the clinking of a canteen.\"\n\n\"Here. Drink up, my man.\" The female... it was coming back... Prilana. That was her name. Prilana. She held the canteen to my lips and i drank deeply. I felt a tingle go through my body, and my head started to clear. With a groan, I pulled myself up, gently pulling the canteen from my girlfriends hands and draining the lot of it. I blinked a couple times and took in my surroundings more clearly. We were indeed in a cave, or cavern of some sort. It I was indeed on a green sleeping bag, and a fire flickered warmly in the center of the place. \n\nImmediately in front of me was Prilana, her eyes still full of concern. A little behind her to my left sat Rythor, watching me intently with sharp green eyes. On the far side of the fire sat his girlfriend, Dyenta. He sat there passed out on a mat like I was.\n\n\"Well? Do you know who we are?\" asked my girlfriend. I nodded slowly, and relief filled her face. \"Oh good. That's very good.\" \n\nRythor spoke up in a cautionary tone. \"He might not remember everything yet. We need to keep an eye on him. He should be good in about an hour.\"\n\nI was suddenly aware that I was holding something in my other hand. I turned to look at it. It was a green glass bong, filled with a rocky substance and a glowing liquid. I looked at Rythor and he grinned.\n\n\"Yeah man. You were on a *biiig* trip. You took a double hit of wastion and started twitching out, babbling incoherently. Then you passed out for like, 3 hours.\" He hooked a thumb behind him at is girlfriend. \"She also took a double hit about an hour ago. She didn't want to be outdone. You know how she is.\"\n\nI dimly remember her being extremely competitive. I looked at the bong again. \"So... what does this stuff do again?\" I eyed Rythor, and a fake, dreamy sage-like expression came over his face. \"It frees your soul from the constraints of space and time, and allows it to fly unbound on the wings of eternity.\" He snorted and dropped the expression. \"At least that's what my dealer told me. So... How was it?\"\n\nA sudden surge of emotions roared through me. Pain, love, happiness, anger... but above all was a sense of bitter emptiness, and an indescribable feeling of loss. \n\nFor some reason, I pushed all of that down and grinned at him. \"Its indescribable man. You gotta take a double hit.\" \n\nHe raised his eyebrows at me. \"You're on, dude.\" \n\nI passed him the bong, and he took the double hit. Almost immediately he started twitching, and, after a bit, he laid down with a sigh. He passed out cold.\n\nI turned to my girlfriend, and held out my arms. She came and snuggled into them. I her for awhile, and then suddenly realized I was shaking uncontrollably. She turned her face to mine. \"Hey... are you ok?\"\n\nAnd I just broke right there. I stared sobbing, great waves of grief and confusion tearing through my body. It all felt so *real*. The love. My family. My childhood. So I sat there, under alien sky, weeping for the life I never lead.\n\nFor the granddaughter I never had.\n\nOr... had it been real? The sobs slowly started to ease, and I blinked the tears out of my face. I held my girlfriend tighter, and made a decision.\n\nIt was real to me, and that was all that mattered.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nEdit: Fixed some formatting, and put a slightly more hopeful ending that I was going to originally put.

            "comment": "\u201cHey, uh\u2026 so do you have it?\u201d I asked, twitching with nervousness. My dealer was an intimidating man. About 6 foot 3 inches, somewhere around 240 pounds, muscular, and a sleeve of black ink covering his left arm.\n\n\u201cThat depends\u2026 Do you have my fucking money with you this time?\u201d He looked at me with distrust and hatred. His dilated pupils made his eyes look black. I never talked to him when he wasn\u2019t high. Normally, a person who looked like this were put me on edge but Len always kept his gun in the waist of his jeans when he was in his house. This terrified me.\n\n\u201cYea, Len. I got it this time\u201d I told him.\n\u201cGood. You\u2019re gonna love what I got for you today Johnny boy. This shit is gonna make you soar through the stars like some kinda fuckin\u2019 alien or some shit. How you scrape up your money this time John boy? Suckin\u2019 cock like the rest of the skinny fuckin\u2019 hoes in this neighborhood? Gotta slap a bitch to take a corner?\u201d\n\u201cw\u2026 windows\u201d I said shakily. \u201cCleaning car windows under the EL\u201d. \n\nI worked all day and night under the massive green railway on Kensington Ave wiping windows for whatever change I could get. If I wasn\u2019t getting robbed later that night for the little money I made I was getting stiffed by trust fund babies who shouldn\u2019t be driving daddy\u2019s car in Kensington. There are other parts of the Philadelphia that I can get H, but Kensington has the best. The shit is so strong.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m fucking with you Johnny Boy. Here, take your jawn and get the fuck out.\u201d\n\nI walk out onto Jasper and turn left and walk towards Alleghany Ave. I walk the three blocks through the trash covered sidewalk to my usual spot in the parking lot behind Dunkin Donuts. Along my way I see a what looks like an old man convulsing on the ground with the crowd around him muttering.\n\n\u201csomebody call 911.\u201d Said one man\n\u201cOh fuck no, I cannot be around this. No way.\u201d Said a woman.\n\nI keep walking. I try to forget what I just saw. I don\u2019t want it to be my turn next. I make it to the lot and sit along the wall of the Walgreens facing the back of Dunkin. \u201cFuck, I need water\u201d I say to myself out loud. I walk to the front of Dunkin and go inside. \n\n\u201cEh, yo. We told you before man. You can\u2019t be comin\u2019 in here unless you\u2019re gonna buy something\u201d the cashier says. She is a beautiful Puerto Rican looking woman, with long dark hair highlighted with blond streaks. She had olive skin and was probably 5 foot 3.\n\n\u201cI just want some water. I\u2026 I have a\u2026 a dollar.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d She says placing the water bottle on the counter, \u201cleave the dollar and get the fuck out\u201d. \n\nI walk up to the counter grab the bottle and walk out. Turn the corner to the go back to my spot in the Dunkin\u2019 lot. I sit back down and pull out my supplies: an old rusty spoon, a lighter, the heroin and the needle. I put the H on the spoon, poor a little bit of water and start heating it up. I stick in the tip of the needle and draw it in. I find the vein on my arm and I stick the needle in, push in the drugs and feel it. Oh\u2026 that rush is good. It\u2019s delightful. I can barely feel my self-hatred. I feel my breathing relax as the heroin over takes me, relaxing me. I close my eyes and feel my brain dancing with joy. I can barely feel where I stuck myself. I can barely feel the wall on my back and the pavement on my butt. I barely feel myself drift off to sleep.\n\n \u201cHis blood pressure is still too low.\u201d said the woman.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on. Where am I? I can barely open my eyes. I can\u2019t feel my body. I see a woman and man around me. Hear the beep of a machine.\n\n\u201cHis heart rate is dropping.\u201d says the man.\n\nI try to speak but nothing comes out. I feel shortness in my breath as I try. I shut my eyes again. And feel nothing. When I open my eyes I see stars. Hear other voices, more familiar to me.\n\n\n\u201cIs Jo\u2019zai ok?\u201d\n\u201cHe should be. Probably having a bad trip.\u201d\n\u201cShould we get him anything? Water from the lake? Silicon dust? Should he be convulsing like that?\u201d\n\u201cHe should be alright\u2026 I\u2019ve had one of these before. He is probably just \u2026\u201d\n\n\nBEEP\u2026 BEEP\u2026 BEEP\u2026 BEEP\u2026\n\n\u201cI got a pulse back.\u201d\n\nI see the man and woman again but the stars are still in my eyes. I hear them talking.\n\n\u201cJames!!! ETA until we are at the Hospital?\u201d\n\n\u201c5 minutes Hannah\u201d\n\n\u201c5 minutes isn\u2019t enough, Speed this fucking wagon up\u201d\n\nI hear sirens wailing and echoing off the buildings. I can feel the jolt of the vehicle as the speed rapidly increases. A crackle of chatter comes across a radio. I try to gasp for breath to no avail.\n\nBEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPP\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\n\u201cResuscitate him Mark! We are almost ther\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFUCK man, he just puked on himself. Come on Gorb\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you he is fine. Give him a minute\u201d\n\nI finally take a breath. It\u2019s heavy with smoke from a fire. I open my eyes and see the stars again.\n\n\u201cI can see the stars\u2026\u201d I whisper.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the familiar voices say in unison.\n\u201cI can see\u2026.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 The stars\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s delirious. How far are we from Temple?\u201d says Hannah.\n\n\u201c1 minute\u201d says James\n\nI can hear the beeping of the machine. It\u2019s very slow. I can feel the frantic energy around me. I open my eyes and see the inside of the ambulance through a haze of my own confusion. I can see the medics working to keep my heart going, trying to bring my breathing back to normal again. I close my eyes one last time and hear the machine flatline.\n\n\n\u201cWOOOO!!!! Fuck! What the\u2026 Oh!!! No, No, No!\u201d I scream looking around. Two figures looking at me with sapphire blue eyes and Mars red skin. I\u2019m covered in what I believe is my own vomit and holding a bong.\n\n\u201cOh, someone take this jawn from me\u201d I say, handing one of the red figures the bong.\n\u201cYou mean bong?\u201d says the one confused as he takes the bong.\n\nMy head is woozy. I look above me and see the stars. An icy ring cuts the sky in half as it rises and falls from horizon to horizon. I see blue mountains in the distance off to my left and a field of green and pink flowers to my right ending at a lake of black water. The question of who I am fades as my surroundings become more familiar. But where I was is still a mystery.\n\n\u201cUh yea, bong. Where was I?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cTechnically you were here the whole time\u201d says Gorb chuckling. \u201cBut those chromium shavings you smoked took you on a wild adventure. How was the trip?\u201d\n\nChromium shavings\u2026 Note to self, never smoke chromium shavings again.\nI look down and see a fire burning in the pit. I remember making the pit and the fire before packing the shavings and smoking them. The night was supposed to be full of relaxation, camping with friends but the memories the chromium made are keeping me tense and my head is starting to throb. My brother told me the first time he smoked chromium shavings, his trip took him to a place of mediation in some mountain range with a funny name, void of contact from most other life forms like his own. He said it was very peaceful. \n\n\u201cAlright Jo\u2019zai, relax. Go take a dip in the lake and wash that vomit off of yourself.\u201d Said Bein \u201cThen come back and tell us\u201d\n\n\u201cTell you what?\u201d I ask rubbing my head, hoping the residual effects of the chromium wear off soon.\n\n\u201cAbout your trip\u2026 How was it?\n",

This is surely your final goodbye. \n\n\"You'll never know, dear,\"\n\nIt's painful to choke out the lyrics to this tired love-filled tune, but you want to comfort them one last time.\n\n\"how much I love you,\"\n\nYour eyes droop shut. Your life is nearly gone. You croak out one more time, horribly off key.\n\n\"so please don't take,\"\n\nYour life is suddenly cut out, but not what you see. Although what you see has changed, it is where you are. \nYou see the body of your former self, her tarnished beauty marred by the vicious hands of war. Around her, you see a group of ten young marines. One stands out to you. He's the love of your life. He slumps next to you crying. \n\nTrying to comfort him, you gather yourself together and drift closer, but it's impossible to be there for him. You're but a bystander in a painful film. You start crying yourself, joining him in mourning. \n\nSeveral more moments pass, and he stops sobbing. He straightens up, through no fear of the gunshots and shrapnel zipping through the air, and he quavers out in a painful yet certain voice:\n\n\"My sunshine away.\"\n\nHe draws you together, carrying you over one shoulder, and heads back to base. The base you two have so many memories at. The base that you two first met at. The base where he proposed. Where you accepted his proposal, where you two had rebellious se x in the janitorial closet on your patrol together. You know he'll never feel a love as deeply as he has with you. \n\nThe other soldiers continue on ahead. Another casualty among millions. You suppose none of this matters. \n\nSuddenly, pulled to reality, you find yourself under a bridge. It's dark, stormy, and cold. You look down at your masculine grey hands to find a bong and a bag of \"Dial y Ddraig\". \n\nDial y Ddraig is guaranteed to create the most memorable trip of your life. Even the little cartoon of an oblong green head with purple beady eyes is often seen saying \"How was the trip!?\" but you always respond rhetorically that it was as painful as ever. \n\nYou slouch down, back further into the soil and a tr\u00ean rushes by. It spews shit and mud all over you. \n\nThe mud reminds you of the blood. It brings you back to the most painful time of your life. It was the war. You hated being drafted, you wanted nothing to do with it. You didn't care, you had school to think about! You were enraged that only men could be drafted. It was blatantly sexist. \n\nYet, at boot camp, you find you are nearly the only man. You're surrounded by women. Not that you liked any of them. They're all mannish and boisterous. You're more soft and sensitive. Any friendship you try to form with your peers is held together with balsa wood and chewing gum. \n\nYou're eventually set off to your first assignment, to defend a base near the enemy lines. Near the human civilisation.\n\nThat's where you find the love of your life. She's beautiful. Dark black hair, streaked with red. Fair white skin. And she's strong. \n\nYou two gather closer than you have ever to anyone else. Starting slow as friends, that all changed with a risqu\u00e9 encounter in a janitorial closet. From that day on, all six chambers of your alien heart beat for her. \n\nBut it all was lost to nought. She was shot down in a skirmish against the humans. You and your squadron gather around her. All saddened, but none so much as you. You lose it and start crying. But she calls you down with a very familiar song. A song you both used to sing to each other while stargazing on long nights assigned to patrol together. \n\n\"Chi yw fy heulwen\n\nfy unig haul\n\nRydych chi'n gwneud i mi yn hapus\n\npan fydd yr awyr yn llwyd\n\nni fyddwch byth yn gwybod yn annwyl\n\nfaint rwyf wrth fy modd chi\n\nfelly peidiwch \u00e2 chymryd\"\n\nShe is unable to finish the song. You gather yourself to finish it for her. \n\n\"Fy heulwen i ffwrdd\"\n\nYou were never the same from that moment on. Your life was torn from you. You now spend your days getting high and reliving that time in every bad trip you have. Each of your veins had at this point collapsed. There's nothing left to you, and you finally realise the full repercussions of investing yourself in anyone. \n\nYou've lost your sunshine. Your heulwen. Your only relief is to relive that life as the enemy had. As you had. \n\nThe only commonality between the two sides of the war was the loss it brought them all. \n\n\nEdit: accidentally hit send before I was done. \n\nP.S.: this is my first time ever. Please excuse this story if it is poor. \u263a\ufe0e ",

I knew I had done it this time kah'lorn, the substance I was on, was extremely addicting and I had been on it for what felt like an eternity.  They say once your hooked its only a matter of time before you overdose; well it looked like my time.  My stomach spasamed painfully as my vision blurred, corrected itself, and burst into colours.  It was becoming more and more difficult to concentrate.  I slumped against the wall next to the toilet, exhaled heavily, and slid to the ground.  I leaned back my head against the wall looking at the single unblinking light on the cealing.  I finally accepted it, I was going to die.  I was going to die lonely, miserable, and alone.  Thoughts of my parents sobbing over my body flooded my mind, a single tear rolled down my face.  I had never meant for it to go this far.  I drew in one final breath just as the kah'lorn was peaking.\n     As I exhaled, I felt my consciousness get wripped from its housing.  I was even more confused, I felt my conciousness unlock memories that made no sense.  I felt like I was living two lives, that I had always been livong two lives. I felt like I was the universe.  I watched sacred geometry dance before my eyes, unimaginable architecture tower around me, and endless oceans flow below me.  Then I gasped in a huge breath, my throat burned like I had held my breath for an hour.  My eyes snapped open on a strange scene.  I was on a porch of some kind.  The trees around this strange house were brown and green instead of the typical blue and silver.  There was alot of green everywhere.  The sky was blue instead of purple.  There was a strange beker shaped aperatus in my hand.  A voice came from behind me,  welcome back, how was the trip.  My stomach dropped out from under me as I realized that though my realities had changed, the person I was stayed the same. ",

I scrambled to my fee, and felt blood rush immediately to my head - everything went red and I almost fell over. Hands steadied me. \n\n\"Easy, easy, mate,\" someone said. \n\n\"Calm down, Alex, you're not dead, you're not dead.\"\n\nDead. I was dead. My hands immediately went to my stomach. Looking for the whole where the sword had impaled me. i'd known he was feinting right, I'd known it! But still the bastard had gotten me. \n\nBut there was no hole.\n\nI remembered to breathe again. I wasn't dead, I wasn't dead. Memories came rushing back, the ritual, the trip. Allie. \n\n\"Oh thank Kos, he's breathing again,\" Liz said.\n\n\"So, mate,\" Mark said, putting a hand on my shoulder \"how did the trip go for you?\"\n\nI looked around, taking in my surroundings. I was on some sort of mountain peak, standing on a platform that was about as big as a normal room. There were clouds in all directions around us, the only things on the platform were the three of us, our bags and a giant, gold metal disc suspended by three poles. It still vibrated slightly from the earlier \"bong\" it had made. And there was Allie of course. \n\nShe lay on the wooden platform. Her eyes were closed - they had been for the past two stellar cycles. Her skin was a milky white, and her white hair fell down to her shoulders. Only her wings, a startling gold that were almost as big as her retained their color. The contrast against her pale skin and white hair was startling to say the least. \n\nI'd failed her again dammit. \n\nWhen I didn't answer Mark put his hand on my shoulder. \"Sorry, mate,\" he said. I turned to look at him, his blond hair in disarray and the feathers of his wings rumpled. His blue eyes told me all I needed to do. He'd failed too. \n\n\"She's gone, Alex, her soul is past the seventh gate by now, we can't bring her back,\" Liz said. \n\nShe came in front of me and knelt down in front of me, putting her hands on my shoulders. Her green eyes looked into my eyes, her red hair and crimson wings adding to the effect. \"She's dead, Alex, we tried. We came all the way to this mountain, we did the stupid ritual, but we failed. We've done all we could,\" she said, her words almost pleading. \n\n\"No,\" I said, looking away from those startlingly green eyes. \"I won't give up on her, Liz, I can't.\"\n\n\"She's dead, Alex,\" Liz said, shaking her head, \"Permanently, now. We can't get her back.\"\n\nI shook my head, indignant. \"I'm trying again.\"\n\nLiz closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Her wings shuddered. When she opened those eyes again, all traces of sympathy were gone. She wasn't looking at me anymore, but behind me, at Mark. She nodded to him he did too, setting his jaw. \n\n\"Well, do it alone, then Alex,\" Liz said. \n\n\"Aye, mate,\" Mark said, \"We've each gone down to the Nether three times now, we've been turned back and ejected every time. Let her go, mate. It's over.\"\n\nI gaped at them. \"You...you're giving up. After all those cycles, you're deserting her!\"  \n\n\"We're letting go, Alex,\" Liz said, her voice soft. \"That's not deserting her, that's moving on.\"\n\nI clenched my teeth. \"Fine, then, go. Go without me dammit, but I'm staying. I'm not giving up on her.\"\n\n\"Mate..\" Mark began, but Liz shook her head. \n\n\"We won't help you destroy yourself, Alex,\" she said, and gestured to Mark. \"Come on, Mark. We're leaving.\"\n\nMark looked at me for a long moment, then nodded. \"That we are.\" They both looked at me one last time before walking to the edge of the platform and flaring their wings, each as long as they were tall, and took off. \n\nThey didn't look back. \n\n\"Cowards,\" I said to Allie, stroking her hair. \"I'll get you, love, I don't need them.\"\n\nWith that I hit the bong with the back of my fist, and lay down. \n\n*BONG!*\n\nThe last of the sound echoed in my ears as I was pulled back into the Nether to try to save not one soul, but two. \n\n***\n(minor edits) \n\nIf you enjoyed, check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)  ",

Voices from the light slowly rose in volume and I came to understand them as the light became brighter.\n\n\"Hey, you okay man?\" One voice asked with a voice as soft as an angel. \"Man, it must have been a while, huh?\"\n\nI don't understand. Wha- What's happening? In the corner of my eye, I could still see my nurse, but as time slowly moved, figures shaped. Not human, for sure.\n\n\"Where am I going?\" I asked in fear. \"Is this what heaven is supposed to be?\"\n\nA second voice came with a lot more rasp, \"Heaven? Ha! This guy is coming up! Must have been some trip!\"\n\n\"What?!\" I exclaimed.\n\nSuddenly, as if I rushed through space, I sat up. Blue grass covering the hillside. Three moons followed each other across the sky. The stars glistening, sprinkling the black sky. A lake blanketing my view as I turned right. Behind me were the figures that arrived to me at the light.\n\n\"Hey Jaz! Xal is back!\" The second voice shouted.\n\n\"Xal?... Me. Jaz?... My girlfriend. And him. He's Fei.\" I whispered. It was coming back.\n\nUs three decided to take the night off studying to relax. Fei brought a bong and then I knocked out.\n\n\"Must have been a good trip, Xal! You were out cold!\" Jaz said as she welcomed me back to reality.\n\n\"Yeah. It was crazy. I lived through a whole life. Like from as an infant to an old man. It felt real the whole time though. I was actually scared to come back,\" I explained.\n\n\"Damn! Those trips are the hardest! After I got mine, it changed my whole view on reality!\" Said Fei\n\n\"Okay, now okay. Come on we have to go back to the apartment. Our exam is in a few days and I still need to help Xal with the last few chapters,\" Jax said like the mom she acts like.\n\nWe flew into our vehicle, Fei less eloquently than Jaz and I, and we rode off back to the city.",

            "comment": "  I was so close to everyone there. They were all so real and genuinely cared for my well being. It was a strange feeling when I died, because I didn't feel anything from the car crash. It was nothing more than an unfortunate event, and I didn't even cause it. In fact, I wasn't even driving. I was just meeting a good ol' friend from childhood, when suddenly, a car just ran into us.\n   It didn't make sense. We shouldn't have died. Ages 37 and 39, and not once were we in trouble with the law. Yet there we were, in pools of blood, dead by the hands of a criminal. Then I woke up.\n   \"Yo PZ-162, how was the trip?\" I was still getting to my senses. How did I just live 39 years in such a short amount of time? \"Oh my god that was strong...\". \" Haha, told you first time was always the best. What you see in that damn head of yours?\" What did I see? It felt so real, and yet it was only around an hour? \"They-\"\nI stammered \"They weren't human. They had two things called arms for grabbing things and 2 legs to walk. They were so vulnerable, and to top it all off they couldn't regenerate their limbs back! They we're not even all the same color...so diverse\". JM-346 paused. He seemed to envy what I just described, or maybe the drugs still hadn't worn off. \"Well damn, I wish my first trip was that good. I think I got ripped off by my old dealer\". He started mumbling and the rest was unintelligible. \n   Later that night, I didn't sleep. It was so different. They weren't human. They- I - was an alien. And they cared so much for their appearance, and their people. It was a wonderful place, and despite it's imperfections, the land of aliens was way more desirable. People cared there. They had sympathy for people, and not everyone was the same. \n   So I continued to get high. I understood addiction. Why it was something people couldn't turn back from once they started. The life of the aliens was enjoyable, it was full of flavor and variety, not clones. There were differences in people. I can't wait until my next dose.",

            "comment": "My eyes opened. The gentle breeze flowing through my window of the Spring season in California was reminding me of when I was a child, playing in the grass and bush of the local wildlife preserve. I want to relive those moments and experience those feelings of wonder and amazement at any moment. When you're a child, nothing stops you from finding seeing life in its fullest potential. \n\n\"Remember when grandpa died?\" Anna asked. \"You didn't leave your room for a whole week. I don't even remember if you ate during that time.\" \n\n\"I did, but not very much. He was the one that took us to the hills to play. He taught me most of what I know. I still miss him.\" I chimed.\n\nPausing for a brief moment, then Anna adds, \"And you love to eat too. I remember us going to the buffet and seeing you try to eat a mountain of fried rice, jello and spare ribs.\"\n\n\"I think the last time I tried that I got the worst stomach flu following.\"\n\n\"You were miserable.\" She laughs.\n\nLaughing back, \"Well so was mom when see had to clean all the puke from my bed and the bathroom. I think I got some on Butter too.\"\n\n\"That straggly dog. I forgot about him...\" Anna looks down with a sad look, \"I miss mom...\"\n\n\"Me too...\"\n\nYears have gone since our mother passed away from breast cancer. She fought hard and stayed strong for the longest time. The amount of pain she was in never left her face, even despite her efforts of not wanting to impose it on her four children. The last image we would see of her is that of a teary eyes and the most gentle smile I would never see again.\n\nWatery eyed, Anna musters the words, \"Dad did such a great job though.\"\n\n\"He did. Three kids and he had to deal with all of our shit. Like when you and Sebastian had a 3 month long war over you gets to hold the TV controller.\"\n\nDad passed of lung cancer five years ago. Smoking was his method of stress relief, and he was always stressed. His hard work and fighting spirit lives on, imprinted forever in our character.\n\n\"And I won...\" But the urge of crying could not stop in her as it let itself out with force. \n\n\"What's wrong?\" I ask.\n\n\"Everything has just been so hard. For so long we barely ate, dad was hardly home because of his three jobs and it was a struggle just to find the will to get out bed.\"\n\n\"But we did, and we became strong because of it. We never got along until I gave you my ice cream that one time.\"\n\nSobbing, Anna asks, \"You remember that?\"\n\n\"Of course. I was 12 and you were 9. Sebastian took yours. I thought that was a terrible act of him so I gave you mine.\"\n\nWith the gentle smile I never thought I'd see again, Anna looks at me and says, \"And I haven't loved you less since.\"\n\nI looked into her eyes, tears beginning to well up in mine. \"Where is Sebastian anyways?\"\n\nAnna's smiling face turns into disappointment as she answers, \"Last I saw of him, he was looking for money from anywhere he could look in my apartment.\"\n\n\"I hope he's okay...\"\n\nSebastian is our oldest brother. He took it the hardest as everything seemed to be crashing down. We saw that he tried to stay strong. He tried his hardest, but he found comfort where it shouldn't be found. The money he was looking for was in desperation to buy his nest high. The lack of it was the only thing keeping him away from the needle. \n\nOn the verge of crying again, Anna sobs, \"Why were we put on this earth? If there Go-\"\n\nInterrupting, \"Anna, now is not the time for that.\"\n\nAnna and I fought through depression together as late teenagers. She's always been more negative though. Her attempts on her own life left scars on the both of us. Physical ones on her. It was when we found our strength in each other that we were able to pull out of it. \n\nContinuing, \"We're alive, we've lived. The most beautiful moments were birthed from us being there for each other. From us finding our strength. From us finding who we are.\" I'm fighting back tears, but moving forward through them, \"I have seen you grow into the most beautiful women I will ever know. You're married to an amazing husband, with three children who will live a life better than ours because you decided to be strong! You've become a social worker because you hate to see children suffer the same way we did. You are making life what it should be for others!\"\n\nFull on crying and with all her emotion pouring out, she asks, \"Then what should life be?! You're only 35! You've barely had any chance to live a happy life, for most of it we've been miserable!\"\n\nIn my head I chuckled. *Only 35*? Perspective is one hell of a thing. I'm going to miss trying to understand what other people are thinking. Hell, I'll miss everything. My relationships, my hard, yet uplifting job as an 8th grade teacher, my home, the life I built up... But my years flew ahead of me and my body became weak. The cancer that grew from my bones had no problem taking over, and now... I'm in my final moments. For the past 2 years I have felt nothing but pain until they the doctor finally said, \"It's terminal.\" Then I felt light. Since those words were uttered I felt the weight of the world lift. Now it was the rest of my life. When I close my eyes, I hear a soft, feminine, strong voice tell me *everything is okay* and a warm sensation spread around my head as though someone is gently caressing it. I'm... happy. \n\nWith some emotion on my face, I answer, \"I'm not sure. If there is a God, maybe he will tell us after we lived it.\"\n\nWith another burst of emotion, Anna responds, \"I love you so much! You are my strength... Where will I be without you...?\"\n\n\"You are strong on your own now. You have built the foundation for your own strength. You are your own fortress. And I'll always be with you. Just not physically.\" \n\nStill crying, Anna clenches my hands harder. It hurts... But that's okay. I look at her to study the person she's become. At 32, Anna, my beautiful sister, resembles so much of mom. I just now noticed.\n\nWith a childish grin I ask, \"Let me get you ice cream.\"\n\nThrough her tears she laughs. I succeeded. I got to see that smile once more. The smile my mother last gave to me.\n\nWe spend the rest of our afternoon eating ice cream and laughing about the good times. Anna gazes into my eyes for a moment before telling me she loves me. After a gentle kiss to the forehead she says, \"I'll see you tomorrow, brother.\"\n\n\"You too.\" I mutter, before closing my eyes.\n\n*with a sudd* \"Whoa...\"\n\n\"How was it?\" Mixtha asks.\n\n\"Uh, great...\"\n\nA smokey haze filled the room above me. My friends convinced me to try this drug for the first time. Take one big hit from the bong and you live a life in four hours. I was hesitant to, but did because why not?\n\nI then add, \"When is it good for me to take another rip?\"\n\nFirst time posting. Let know what you think!",

Countless lonely nights of drug and alcohol abuse, always afraid. I was afraid in any social event that I would act out and either go to jail, ruin life-long relationships,  embarass myself, or annoy others. I have held onto my need tobe a good person for so long. And I've held on so tightly that if that need had breath it would have suffocated long ago. I was never a religious person but I always felt like by blood was soaked in sin waiting to just be carefree and not worry about other people's feelings and just live my life for me.  But that's not what I wanted. I wanted so much to please that I shut myself out. And the darkness began to consume me more and more with self deprecating thoughts. I am not wanted. I will never be on the level of normal people. People will always step on me and I will never step on them back. I am an idiot. I am...we are, only temporary anyway. One night, after a lot of alcohol and a few pills, Decided it was over. I chugged as many bottles as I could from my cabinet while swallowing more and more pills until I passed out.

Yet at the same time retaining the sense of my true conscious being. I didn't think such a thing was possible. My friends were looking at me expectantly. \"Dude, are you alright?\" Their voices even retained a semblance of that physical dimension, like they were coming from the vibration of oxygen and hydrogen molecules. But, of course, such a notion sounded absurd even coming out of the trip.\n\n\"It was like I was matter.\"\n\"What do you mean, 'matter'? Like atoms?\"\n\"Yeah, but they were all working together, like I was controlling them from the inside. In a way, I was God.\"\n\"Sounds intense.\"\n\"It's like being reborn. At first, things appear bright, like the way you experience them when you were as a kid. So you become transfixed by these images and you can interact with these physical things and it's very brightly coloured and amazing. But that's not what's truly amazing - what's amazing is the way it makes you think. Like you're thinking for the first time, like really becoming self-aware. But then you become afraid. You see these shadow people, out of the corner of your eye at first, but then they seem realer and realer, almost like they could hurt you. And then it's like they're infecting you. And that magical feeling you felt at the start of the trip turns to one of horror. Like the most horrifying things you wouldn't have dared to imagine are staring you down and you can't look away. And that's when they seem like they must be real. Realer than real. But as the trip subsides you realise that none of it is real and that nothing can hurt you ever. And that the things you thought were real were just illusions of your own creation and everything that was real was overshadowed by the intensity of these illusions. And you feel deep regret too because you realise your part in creating these monsters, these illusions. And that's when I started crying, like really bawling -\"\n\n\"Yeah we noticed,\" piped Zimmerman.\n\n\"Sounds really profound,\" said Zax sarcastically.\n\n\"Shut up Zax, let me finish.\"\n\nI continued, as though I was on the cusp of some grand truth, although this could just be the fractal dust still talking. \"But it was cleansing, you know? I released all these demons and I realised the greatest demon was myself and all I had to do was let it go. All I had to do to defeat the monsters was accept them and they went away. Well, not really, 'went away', but sort of became not 'monsters' anymore - just a part of a trip. Like I saw them for what they truly were and was supposed to learn something from them. And it's like I saw the meaning of life. God, what was that thing again? But I can tell you how I felt. I wasn't happy, wasn't sad, but more a mixture of both. It was beautiful. A beautiful sadness. You probably don't have a clue what I'm talking about. But it felt like something was revealed to me that day. It didn't just feel like getting fucked up. It felt like being enlightened, like a portal to another dimension.\"\n\n\"Sounds trippy. Give it here.\"\n\n",

In the recent years, she preferred my company at dinner a few nights a month and the cool summer nights felt great from the back of my motorcycle. I pulled out onto the main road that connected the nearby communities and drove away. \n\nOn my commute, I was going through an intersection when I noticed a man sitting on a bench. There was nothing truly special about him, nothing memorable. Except this one thing. \n\nI could see the panic in his face. Illuminated by the semi truck that sent me off my cycle, sliding nearly to the man, still on the bench. \n\nWhoa. Wait. What? \n\nThat wasn't a semi. That was Voshrein's fist that sent my body flying several meters. Voshrein? Oh, that's the boyfriend of the girl I've been hitting on at this shitty 3rd rate skooma bar of the rings of Saturn. \"How was your trip?\" echoed from within the bar, mocking my failure. ",

            "comment": "The bright light fades into a vista of a beautiful countryside with grass wafting in the breeze.  Trees dot the landscape spilling down the slopes of the large hills that are characteristic of Hyrule.  In the distance you notice the castle first and then the volcano further off and to the right.\n\nA man wearing a massively oversized backpack with an awning introduces himself as Beedle.\n\nYou go try to ask where you are but all that comes out is a questioning grunt.\n\n\u201cAh,  this is Hyrule, ruled by Princess Zelda and watched over by her trusted bodyguard Link.\u201d\n\n&lt;puzzled grunt&gt;\n\n\u201cYou definitely don\u2019t look like you are from around here\u201d he says.  But I have lots of things if you want to buy something!\u201d\n\n&lt;frustrated grunt&gt;\n\n\u201cWoah!  Is that the Master Sword?!  Link has been looking for that!  How did you get that?\u201d\n\n&lt;several excited grunts&gt;\n\n\u201cYou bought it?! But how did it get to your world?  No matter, you should head straight to Hyrule castle and give it to Link.  Princess Zelda may be able to help you get back to your world, but be careful there are moblin monsters and Kreese bats that are very dangerous and you will need to steer clear of them if you don\u2019t know how to use The Master Sword\u201d.\n\nYou lift the sword and casually swing it and an arc of energy erupts from the tip and shoots through the air and strikes a wooden crate causing it to explode in a shower of fiery splinters.  Left behind is a single arrow.\n\n\u201cHey! Watch where you are swinging that thing!\u201d  Beedle says.\n\n&lt;curious grunt&gt;\n\n\u201cI know right!? A single arrow in a big wooden crate.  I think someone needs to look like they are producing and adding value to Hyrule but in reality their job isn\u2019t really needed\u201d.\n\nWith that you start to begin your journey to the castle.  It begins to grow late and so far you\u2019ve only encountered several apple trees, a fox that dashed off the moment it saw you, and several horses that were grazing in the distance.\n\nIt begins to grow late and you notice a blood moon in the sky.  The voice of Zelda is heard in your mind saying \u201cThe Blood Moon rises.\u201d  You look down as The Master Sword begins to glow bright blue.\n\nPiggish oinking noises can be heard in the trees and glowing yellow eyes seem to looking at you and then at the sword and then back at you.  They seem hesitant to reveal themselves but are definitely agitated.\n\nSuddenly a bone horn is heard in the distance and the moblins, wooden clubs and spears raised high, charge from the trees at you.  \n\n&lt;frantic grunt&gt;\n\nThe Master Sword erupts in energy wave after energy wave as you swing wildly at the enemies assailing you.\n\nIt\u2019s no good there are too many and you are not skilled in the art of fighting with a sword. You are pressed back against a boulder and just as they reach striking distance a magnificent horse jumps down in front of you scattering the now frightened Moblins.\n\nA ruggish looking young man with pointed ears and blonde hair leaps off his mount and lands gracefully before you.\n\n&lt;concerned grunt&gt; he says.\n\n&lt;scared grunt&gt; you reply.\n\nHis eyes fall open the sword and a look of surprise and excitement spreads across his face. Point at the sword he says,  &lt;excited grunt&gt;!\n\nYou hand him the sword as he says his grunt said his name is Link and that is his sword.\n\n&lt;appreciative grunt&gt; he says.\n\nWith determination on his face he turns to the moblins and after a series of deft parry\u2019s and a flurry of death blows the scene is calm once more.\n\n&lt;cheerful grunt&gt; you say\n\n&lt;cheerful grunt&gt; was the reply.\n\nHe points at his horse and beckons you to follow.\n\n&lt;earnest grunt&gt; as he pointed to the castle after helping you mount Epona, the magnificent.\n\nYou and he talk along the way about what happened and how you got there.\n\n&lt;grunt&gt;\n\n&lt;surprised grunt&gt;\n\n&lt;grunt of wonder&gt;\n\n&lt;grunt of agreement&gt;\n\n&lt;grunt of fear&gt;\n\n&lt;grunt of reassurance&gt;\n\n&lt;grunt of gratitude&gt;\n\n&lt;grunt of humility&gt;\n\nAs you travel your stomach grumbles and Link jumps off Epona and starts a fire and pulls out a giant cooking wok and throws some apples, a honey comb and a fish into the wok.  As it\u2019s cooking he bums a little familiar tune and suddenly you have honey glazed Hyrule trout garnished with apples.\n\n&lt;proud grunt&gt; said Link\n\nYou take a bite.\n\n&lt;yummy grunt&gt; you say\n\nYou and Link travel to Hyrule castle after your meal.",

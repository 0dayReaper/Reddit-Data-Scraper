Isn\u2019t that \u2026\n\n\u201cWelcome to ShondaLand baitches!\u201d shouts Greys Anatomy writer and creator Shonda Rhimes. \u201cGet me a CBC and Chem7 stat and prep an OR!\u201d\n\nYou fade back into consciousness. You\u2019re on the grassy floor of a nature trail in West Hollywood. The half-eaten remnants of a mushroom you thought might get you high are in your right hand. You proffer them weakly to Shonda. \n\nShe looks at you and at the gnarled mushroom pieces. \u201cDamn - I don\u2019t know anything about mushrooms but I know enough not to touch them unless they\u2019re from Whole Foods!\u201d , she snaps. \n\nShonda leans in , \u201cLook - I\u2019m going to level with you. I think you\u2019re toast. So you can ask me anything about my shows and I\u2019ll tell you the truth. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll tell anyone \u2026 dead meat!\u201d  \n\nYou weakly gather your strength and lean into Shonda\u2019s ear getting a whiff of her fabulous perfume and a close up of her stunning earrings. \u201cGreys Anatomy should have ended with Christina Yang!\u201d you mutter. \n\n\u201cGirl - everybody knows that!\u201d Shonda laughs. \u201cHow this weak  show has been running for 32 years without Sandra Oh is beyond belief! For an entire year we put Meredith in a coma as she couldn\u2019t even bring herself to make any facial expressions !\u201d  \n\nYou vomit with delight. The darkness floods in. \n\nYou smile and start slipping away into the void \u2026. \n\nOnly to suddenly startle awake with a wince. Turns out it was just acute food poisoning from the mushroom.  You brush yourself off and amble off into the nature trail. Maybe you\u2019ll find more hallucinogenic mushrooms next time you muse as Shonda jogs off into the sunset.",

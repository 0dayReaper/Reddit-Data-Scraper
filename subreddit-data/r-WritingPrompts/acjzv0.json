            "comment": "When I was a kid, I thought winning a lifetime supply of Oreos would mean truck after truck appearing at my house, each overflowing with Oreos. Back then I didn't think about things like where in the world we'd keep that many Oreos, or the fact that they'd all go bad shortly after, or that sooner or later I'd get sick of eating them. I just had this grand vision in my head I guess, didn't want to let it go. So I was pretty disappointed when a little package showed up on our front porch.\n\nThere were fifteen Oreos in the package. I asked my mom where the rest was, and she told me more would come next month. Waiting an entire month seemed like torture at that age, and made what arrived doubly crushing. Another package of exactly fifteen Oreos. It slowly sunk in to my little head that this was what winning a lifetime supply of Oreos looked like. No trumpets and fanfare, no overloaded trucks pulling in one after another. Just a little packet of fifteen Oreos on the first of every month.\n\nFifteen! I couldn't believe it. That wasn't even one Oreo for each day!\n\nThe grand imaginings we have as kids rarely come true. For example, I wanted to be a marine biologist. Then the whole world started collapsing and now there are hardly any fish even left, much less people with the time or tools to study them.\n\nAnd yet, those packages kept coming. To my house. To the shelter. To my tent. To the stick laid against a tree with an old coat draped over it so I could huddle under, away from the worst of the rain. Wherever I went, there they were. Fresh and neatly packaged up on the first of every month, like nothing bad had ever happened anywhere.\n\nFor a long time I tried to figure out where they were coming from, who delivered them, how they were finding me, anything. I ran after every lead, pursued every theory. Aliens? Fairies? Time travel? Some bizarre joke? All in my head? But I never found anything, and eventually I gave up on finding out. I didn't want to finally get my answer only to realize it was like everything else- Like the trucks of Oreos, like undersea exploration, like falling in love. Something that seemed to exist just to disappoint people naive enough to believe in it.\n\nToday was the first of the month, I'd guess. Haven't had a calendar for a long time, but the deliveries never fail. This time the package was placed neatly across a few sturdy branches of the tree I'd slept in, hoping to avoid the mess of trouble that had gone on below. I wasn't sure how I'd get down considering I'd messed up one of my legs pretty darn badly in the night's scuffle, but my package was close enough to reach from where I sat. Same little shipping label as always, though the address lines had been left blank since I stopped having an address.\n\nI opened it up. You think I'd be sick of them by now, but when times are rough you wouldn't believe how good that sugar tastes. Only, strange thing, there weren't so many in the package this time. Five was all, I was ten short. I considered that maybe wherever they came from was running out, or that something else had gotten to my supply before I had. Then I considered something else.\n\nA lifetime supply of Oreos.\n\nI guess this is my last one.\n",

With gold, you have one month access to r/lounge. An exclusive subreddit for those who have been gilded or purchased gold for themselves. You also get discounts on various websites that partner with reddit\n\nNow, platinum is just what gold was, but more expensive. You also get coins with which you can buy another person gold. Gold is worse than it was before. And reddit silver is legitimately only the icon and nothing else. They made a simple, fun system convoluted and more expensive.",

            "comment": "The key to a successful business is happy customers. It's simple really: make a good product and don't piss off your customers and they'll do the advertising for you. The best product in the world will fail if it has a bad image. \n\nThat's where my job comes in. Nabisco hired me to make sure Oreos stayed the family-friendly cookie that they've been for the past few decades. It started pretty normally, but I wanted to make absolutely sure that nothing spoiled our good name. \n\nIt started with maintaining our social media accounts. Simple advertising evolved into resolving bad customer experiences. Resolving bad experiences evolved into preventing them from happening in the first place. I looked into every employee's background and then some. Multiple employees were let go before the police received anonymous, credible reports of hard evidence detailing a wide variety of crimes. I made damn sure that \"Oreo\" and \"Pedophile\" were never in the same headline. \n\nThen we ran the promotion. Some contest where the winner would receive a package of Oreos every month for the rest of their life. Super easy to enter, and all recipient names were hidden. That way \"Hitler\" wouldn't be receiving our endorsement anytime soon. Quick media buzz for a month or so, then a lifetime of word-of-mouth for one \"lucky\" individual. Also thrown into the deal was the ability to request any flavor you want, and even try our new flavors before the public does. What the general public doesn't know is that I get to decide who wins, and I'll make it whoever will give us the most long-term advertising use. \n\nI picked a young politician. He was full of hope, optimism, and most importantly charisma. His background was squeaky clean and he didn't seem likely to be corrupted by power or money. But I could use him.\n\nThen 2020 hit and even I couldn't have predicted the massive Civil War that broke out. I don't know all the details, but the result was Nuclear warheads detonating within our border. Foreign powers were blamed and soon the entire world crumbled into chaos; minus one company that is. \n\nI made damn sure that I did my job. Our social media offered advice on how to stay safe in the post-apocalyptic world. Our factories were now shelters for the common folk. Our suppliers were unscathed by the war and now 100% dedicated to Nabisco. Most importantly, our products were still being consumed by the masses.\n\nBut what of the young politician? He continued to receive his package of cookies and creme every month on the dot. Tracking him was difficult, but it was all worth it in the end. He credited Oreo for giving him hope in this wasteland of our country. He made horrible cookie puns in his speech to rebuild America. He hired our staff to run his campaign in the settlements across America's ruins. He even handed out Oreos to cancer-ridden children on the verge of death. He was the first president to be unanimously elected to office. \n\nBut most importantly of all, my boss gave me a 5% pay raise with a free package of Oreos. ",

            "comment": "Do you remember all the Oreo contests? The ones where if you had the special cookie design or special colored filling you had found the proverbial golden ticket? As a kid, I was obsessed. I spent all my spare money on Oreos. Package after package. My parents thought it was cute. My friends thought it was awesome. \n\nIt was an obsession that paid off. I found one of the winning cookies, and I won free Oreos for life. Every month, I received a shipment. The postal carriers would make jokes about the oreos, and I would laugh and give them a package. \n\nThis went on for years. Until nuclear war broke out, and the country was obliterated. I survived, so did my father. But we lost my mom and my sister. We only survived because we had gone to tour a college campus that was in the middle of nowhere. Far enough away from the epicenter of the blasts. \n\nWe lost everything. We couldn't go back for months the area was so irradiated. We, along with other survivors did what we had to. Raiding, stealing\u2026 dad even had to kill someone. \n\nThe first package of Oreos, sitting alone on a shelf in a looted out store seemed like a joke. We took them, and enjoyed talking about mom and sis as we ate.\n\nThe second package was less of a joke. We still had a functioning minivan, and when we returned to it, a package was on my seat. \n\nOver and over for months, packages would appear in places they had no business being. We thought we were being stalked. Hunted. But no one ever came for us. So, eventually we just accepted the Oreos and moved on.\n\nUntil yesterday. The package we found yesterday had been opened, and on the inside of the peel back top was a note. A note summoning us to the Oreo factory in New Jersey. So now, intrigued, we are on our way.\n\nr/LandOfMisfits\n\nEdit: Capitalizied Oreo's\n\nPart 2:\n\nThe trekke took us months. Even though we had a functional van, the roads were in horrible shape. Burned out husks of other cars sat desolate on the road. We didn\u2019t hurry - I mean, what? Was the world going to end? Again? Still, the steady stream of Oreo\u2019s continued. No more opened packages, no other sign that we had been summoned. \n\nMany times Dad asked if I was sure that I wanted to go there. He felt we were being led into a trap. I reasoned that we had been eating the Oreo\u2019s for months. If someone wanted to hurt us, all they had to do was poison them. It\u2019s not like we checked anymore. We saw few enough people that we had let down our guard. \n\nI did wonder though. Why me? I had been a small child when I first won the endless cookies. I had thought maybe at first it was someone from our past, but as we travelled farther and farther away from our home, that likelihood decreased exponentially. Not to mention the fact we never saw anyone leaving the packages. It kind of reminded me of the Santa figure from my childhood. \n\nAs we passed through DC going north, we passed through one of the largest reestablishment settlements we had seen. More people than we had seen in a long time. Full camps of people, most of which warned us off our journey north. Philadelphia, we heard, was where the first bomb hit. We would have to travel through the irradiated zone to get to the factory. \n\nWe stayed in the camp for a while, trying to decide our next course of action. That was, until the rate at which the Oreo\u2019s appeared rapidly increased. First it was one when I was walking, then another on a bench that I was just about to sit on, then a whole pile on my bed that night. Whoever needed us there was in a hurry. We were on the road again the next morning. We chose to go up the coast, as close to the ocean as we could. \n\nAt some point we had to figure out where we were going. We knew that the cookies were baked in New Jersey, but honestly, neither of us had ever been there before. I sure did miss the internet. We had maps and postcards and stories of people who remembered from before the bombs. Together, we were able to form a picture of where we were going. Just north of New York city, in a place that I thought was part of New York State, a small town called Fair Lawn. \n\nTraveling in New Jersey had been hell. Dad had gotten sick from the radiation, and I couldn\u2019t remember if I had hair on my thighs or not before we entered the area. Reaching Fair Lawn was like a breath of fresh air, something that I could only recall from memories. We found a nice home to stay in, evacuated at some point with the owners to never return. The house we chose even had a bathroom decorated with Oreo paraphernalia. We had a good laugh at that one.\n\nWe slept well that night. however, we woke up to a pile of Oreo packages on the ends of each of our beds. After we dressed and walked outside, we saw something we could hardly believe. Thousands of empty Oreo packages rolled down the street like dried tumbleweeds, caught on bushes and trees. As we walked to the factory we realized that was all just a distraction to the real issue. We were not alone. \n\nHundreds of people were camped outside of the factory. Many standing in line, holding notes or packages, just like mine. Summoning them here. Just like me. Ever cautious, Dad and I backed up to our temporary home. We debated what was going on, until Dad decided to find out what was going on. He had me stay back, and took my note with him. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve never been one to listen, so of course I followed him. Just in time to hear, \u201cSo you\u2019ve been chosen too? You were also a lifetime supply winner? We all are.\u201d\n\nr/LandOfMisfits\n",

            "comment": "The box sat at the front of where my house used to stand. Unopened, untouched, unravaged by the world. At first, twenty years ago, it had made me smile, thinking that someone somewhere was holding on to the old world. Maybe the factory workers had kept working, right to the end. Maybe the postal worker fancied themselves a Mad Max, a road warrior hell bent on delivering this package. Maybe there was someplace that hadn\u2019t endured the collapse. He chuckled now, thinking about it. Maybe, so many maybes. There was nowhere safe, no someone on the other end of the line. It was just an automated process. Put into place thirty years ago and somehow, improbably, still going strong. It was more a testament to man\u2019s ingenuity than anything else. Still, the boxes kept coming. \n\nWinning the contest hadn\u2019t seemed like such a godsend at the time. He\u2019d been excited, sure, but any 9 year old kid would have loved a lifetime supply of Oreos. After the Collapse which ended the world, they\u2019d been his major food source. To be honest, he was getting a bit sick of them. He had tried everything he could think of to catch the mysterious deliverer of the Oreos. To this day, he\u2019d tried countless hide and seek maneuvers, electronic surveillance, tag teamed watches, and nothing worked. He would watch all night, waiting for any sign, only to be disappointed. Yet there the Oreos would sit anyway. Every month, without fail. Like clockwork. \n\nAbout five years back there had been a small survivor community that settled nearby. The Oreos had been all the currency he\u2019d needed to trade with them. Not only were they a nostalgic item for the older survivors, but they were a special treat for kids. Nothing else was really special anymore. When civilization ended, so did everything. He sometimes wondered if that was all humanity was. The end of things seemed to him to be the end of people. Of all the survivors he\u2019d met, they\u2019d all been so focused on existing that they\u2019d lost what made them who they were. No more joy or laughter or art. Just survival. \n\nThen here he was, with a box of magic Oreos, and more coming every month. It wasn\u2019t simply a cookie. It was a lifeline. The last vestige of hope that he had. He was older now, harder, and he\u2019d had to endure many awful things post-collapse. The old stories of warriors and loyal workers held no appeal for him now. But he found hope in that little box anyway. It didn\u2019t look special, contained nothing truly desirous, but it came every month. Persistence in the face of extreme adversity. Something about it made him believe, in some small corner of his heart, that maybe humanity could survive this. If they could just keep going, just keep moving forward, month by month, then eventually things would change. \n\nHe walked over to the box and picked it up. Its familiar shape comforted him. Looking around at the deserted ruins of his home, he laughed. An old line from a movie had popped into his head, but it seemed to him that Forrest Gump had gotten it wrong. Life wasn\u2019t like a box of chocolates. It was like a box of Oreos. You always knew what you were going to get and when you were going to get it. Chuckling, he made his way towards his bunker with one thought stuck in his mind. Death comes for us all in the end, but until then, the Oreos come too. \n",

            "comment": "The windswept waste calls out to me at night, weeping and howling like a hungry beast. The barren fields and empty streets eat the strongest of men down to the bone. \n\nLittle is as it once was. The gray sky, hurling its gastric acid over the countryside, twisting the trees and vegetation into nightmarish swamps. The slouching street lamps sprouting from cracked flowerbeds of tarmac. The ruined cities of a world flushed down the drain.\n\nThey say that time heals all wounds, but those prophets of the old knew little of the carcass we now call Earth. They knew nothing of the roaring trucks of the meat farmers and the shrieks of their shackled slaves. They knew nothing of the rabid men hiding in cellars, ready to spring out and tear into your flesh, happy to infect anyone with their disease. They knew nothing of the struggles and the temptation of death. They had no idea what it's like to salivate into a dry mouth at the mere thought the parcel in the back of my satchel.\n\nWith a deep breath, I rush out of my hiding spot. Crossing the street, covering my face from the corrosive rain, praying that the eyes of the city are gazing elsewhere. Zigzagging through a graveyard of rusting cars, jumping across the yawning fissures in the ground.\n\nA sudden creak of metal sends a shiver down my back and my heart into overdrive. From under the skeleton of an old school bus, a chromium arm reaches out. Unharmed by the rain, it whips to and fro, trying to grasp anything, catching the shoulder band of my satchel.\n\n\"Wasn't it enough that you set this world on fire, huh?\" I hiss at it through gritted teeth as we engage in a brief tug of war.\n\nIn the back of my mind, I know it's a lost cause. The satchel is as good as gone. My few possessions, lost.\n\nGroaning, I let go of the band and reach into the satchel one last time as it skids across the ground, pulling out the parcel before everything disappears into the darkness below the bus.\n\nWith an aching shoulder and sweat dripping down my face, the shadow of the building on the other side of the street finally swallows me up. Covering my mouth, I force the coughing fit back down my throat again.\n\nThe bleak dawn climbs up over the horizon. My time is running out. Swallowing my breath, I tiptoe through the filth, my eyes searching through the corners. \n\nThere she is, curled up into a ball next to an old garbage container. Her dark hair covers her face, and for a moment I'm worried that she's dead. That she's finally given up. But then she sighs in her sleep and rolls over. The dark locks fall to the side, revealing her hollow cheeks, streaked by tears and lined by misery. \n\nI tried to approach her once, but the world has dug its claws into her frail body and mind. She's scared of everything, and rightfully so. She was so young when the bombs fell. Far too young to live in this world.\n\nSlowly, I pull out the parcel, and the intoxicating smell of chocolate fills the air. Even in her sleep, she reaches for it, takes it out of my hands. Our fingers almost touch... almost.\n\nShe hugs it to her small chest, just like a child would their favorite stuffed animal.\n\nFor a moment, I watch her sleep. The lines in her face smoothen themselves out. Her expression is peaceful, and that gives me peace. Knowing that her stomach will be full another day is what keeps me going. \n\nI used to tell myself that it was my duty to deliver them to her -- she did win the golden ticket -- but over the years I've come to realize that I do it as much for me as I do it for her.\n\nSeeing her thin lips curve into a tiny smile reminds me that there's still beauty left in this world. Her smile is the only thing that keeps me sane. \n\n***\nr/Lilwa_Dexel",

            "comment": "The hours pass slowly and are full of pain. My body grows weary with toil under the distant sun and amidst the red dust. But there is no rest for the slaves of the Corn King. We work the barren fields under the crack of the whip and the threat of worse\u2013trying to force life out of something that long ago has died. My life was not always as terrible as it is now now. For I am old. I even remember the times before.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPrior to serving the Corn King, I was a king myself. I held a small fiefdom to the north. It was nothing compared to the vast fertile tracts of the King, but it was free and happy. My people and I lived there fairly for many years. We farmed when we could and hunted when we could not. Some small part of our land had not been affected by the dark blight. But there was another reason I was king, another reason we were able to live as we did, a secret power that allowed me and my people to thrive in the wastelands.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe young, those who do not remember the times before, called it manna, like in the old stories: food from the heavens, a miracle. The truth is more mundane but just as mysterious. As a child, before the blight, I ate many cookies, candies, and other sweet things. These were more common and easy to come by then than they are now. One day I bought a package of sweet cookie sandwiches called Oreos. I knew little then of the significance that day would hold and the importance of it to my future survival. For when I opened that package, I saw a slip of paper inside; I had won a lifetime supply of Oreos.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter the darkness and the fall of the cities, the deliveries continued. No matter where I was, once a month, on the day of the new moon, a rider dressed all in black would find me. The rider would give me a box filled to the brim with packages of Oreos. At times they were Double Stuf. Sometimes Cakesters or Heads or Tails. One dark and evil day the entire box was Birthday Cake flavor. Those cookies and that rider allowed me to survive for years. They allowed me to found and feed a small town. I called it Fort Oreo.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe lived on that manna and what little we could farm. We lived in peace with other peoples, trading and bartering. That is, until the Corn King came. They say he never has enough. He seeks new fields to farm and people to enslave. He was accompanied by many men and with fire, smoke, and the screams of children. I burned the last of our reserves; he may kill us all but he would never learn my secret. I then fled to the south. I was found by one of his scouts and played dumb. I was brought to one of their camps to work as a field slave. My former subjects were either killed or brought to other places. I saw no one whom I recognized.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is now on the mysterious delivery that I pin my hopes. The moon has been waning. The rider will come tonight.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNight falls and I manage to escape escape from the bunkers. If I am found, they will\u2013I do not like to think on it. I wait, the time passes, I begin to lose hope, but then\u2013lo! The rider comes. I see a shadow in the distance, by the light of the stars, growing closer. The rider approaches me and holds out a box. For the first time in many years, I speak to him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI beg this strange hooded rider to deliver me from this place, just as he delivered so many boxes of Nabisco \u00ae Oreo Cookies in the past. He looks at me from under his hood. His eyes gleam and he seems deep in thought.\n\nEventually he says, \"you may accompany me and escape this present evil. But know that, if you do, many trials lie ahead. You will indeed change ere you return to the world of men. Whether it be for the better or the worse, I cannot say.\"\n\nI tell the rider that I will come. Although I am old, I still have vigor in my limbs and my mind is strong. The Oreos provided me with strength and a strange vitality all my life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe figure then pulls back his hood and reveals a face. It is more wonderful and terrible than can be described in words. I turn my eyes and look elsewhere for many minutes before I can bear to look directly at him.\n\nThe figure speaks to me, \"come, for there is much work to do.\"\n",

At least I'd still get to see my Dad, every month. \n\nRight there, he gave me a package of Oreos and said, \"Better stock up on some milk, buddy, because we're going to have Oreos every month!\" \n\nBy the fifth grade, I could remember sitting in the lawyer's waiting room while my Mom went in to \"talk to him about how my Dad was treating me.\" I wasn't sure what that meant, back then. He would show up every month with Oreos just like he promised and we'd talk or throw a frisbee around the yard. She said that's no substitute for \"financial responsibility\" but I didn't know what that meant. I just knew that she ran him off and she was the one dragging me to this stupid lawyer all the time. My Dad was the same guy I always knew. I loved him for it. \n\nBy the time I was a senior in high school, Mom's friend Walter moved into our house. Walter was a real man's man kind of guy. He was into guns and hunting and football and every other piece of shit I didn't care about. He called me \"Sport\" a lot, and I told her it was because he couldn't remember my name. She said I was being too hard on him. I wanted to say, \"Like you were with Dad?\" but I didn't have the guts. \n\nDad still showed up, though. He was still driving the same car, but it was making a lot of weird noises. At least it made it easy to hear when he was coming up the street. He hadn't always shaved for a day or two, either, but Dad had the Oreos, as promised, every month. Mom would tell me to take them inside while they \"talked.\" That was code for Mom yelling about how the child support check bounced. Again. For the third month in a row. \n\nBy graduation, Dad didn't bring the car around anymore. He'd just show up on the doorstep. I knew he was walking from the bus stop, because he'd show up sweaty and a little winded. Some of the Oreos were broken and they didn't always taste that fresh. I pretended not to notice the \"clearance\" sticker. Walter was still a tool, but at least he'd learned to leave me the hell alone and Mom and I tried not to be in the same room as one another.\n\nIn the fall, I tried a local community college. My grades weren't great and I was worried that my Dad couldn't afford to come see me if I didn't live at my Mom's house. I need not have worried. By October I knew college wasn't for me, mostly because I'd flunked out. My Dad still showed up, though, Oreos in hand and a smile on his face. This time, Mom met him at the door. She told him I was 18 now. She told him, at the top of her lungs, that she didn't have to put up with seeing his sorry, loser face on her property ever again. She told him he could shove those Oreos up his ass for all the good they've ever done anybody. I think she grabbed the Oreo package out of his hand. I think she threw it across the yard. I'm not sure. I was upstairs because I knew where Walter keeps his shotgun.\n\nShe spent more than 10 years trying to ruin my Dad and all my Dad ever did was bring me Oreos and tell me he loved me. Once a month. Every month. I stopped her and now she won't hurt my Dad anymore. \n\nDad still brings me Oreos every month and I still love him for it. He's gotten a lot older, now, and we can't talk for long when he comes by. It's always sad. He cries before he leaves, now, and that makes me sad, too. The doctors say it's good for me to maintain relationships with family members, and, besides... I still like Oreos. \n\n[I know this one is a little off-prompt, but one person's collapse of civilization might not be the same as another's.]",

I looked around the meager apartment I was staying in, since \u201cthe event\u201d I tend to like places that are higher up\u2026you never know what\u2019s going to be at the ground level looking for you.  \n\nOne last time I open the door and there it is, the fresh package of Oreo\u2019s sitting on my doorstep. Just like last month and just like the month before. It was a novelty at first and now it\u2019s just a reminder of how things have gotten so screwed up. I picked them up and threw them into the Oreo room\u2026there were hundreds of packages in there now.  \n\nI stopped eating those years ago. I look over at the wall again. Tick Tock goes the clock, counting down second by second. The last time I saw a person was 8 years ago. I suppose there aren\u2019t many of us left at all. I did see a horrific looking animal, I think it was a squirrel, but with 2 deformed heads it\u2019s sort of hard to tell. I look back at the clock. I\u2019m not sure if I want it to go faster or slower.  \n\nEverything worth anything I keep in a sack, only the essentials and a piece of paper. I start to gather my things not sure if I\u2019ll need them or not. It\u2019s almost time. Aw screw it. I pick up the paper and then I hear the chimes of the clock. Almost simultaneously I hear knocking on my door. I take the folded up piece of paper; it looks slightly yellow after all this time, and I decide I\u2019ll take it with me and kick the rest aside.  \n\nI steel my nerves and answer my door and there he is looking just like it was yesterday when it\u2019s been 30 years. Is it wrong to want to live when so many are dying? First the bombs dropped. I guess if you got the bombs you were one of the lucky ones. Then the plagues came and the sickness and as I lay dying I tried to cling to my life and made the only deal that I could to prolong it, so I sold my soul, you would think there was an age requirement for such a thing but it's time to collect.  \n\nI looked at the contract one last time, a promise that I would be fed once a month. The sadistic bastard tortured me with the one thing I could never stomach. Every month they came, whether I was huddled up in an isolated cabin or living in a hi-rise, every god forsaken month. At least the bastard could have sent some milk.",

I was a lucky one. The skills I\u2019d known before the End were invaluable now. I could trap and kill the miserable, irradiated horrors that passed for wildlife. Still, as most animals died off, as most humans killed them and then each other, hunger gnawed at my belly more often than not.\n\nMy fingers pinched less and less of the flesh around my gut each week\u2014a gut no low-carb diet could get rid before. I felt the angles of my face sharpen a little more. And my hands\u2026 I shake, now. It\u2019s not the nightmares, or the memories. It\u2019s the feebleness of hunger.\n\nI write this into the margins of what books I\u2019ve left, and onto the walls with what liquid will stain: Three years of hunger, almost incessant famine. The companions I knew and the survivors rumored have most certainly died by now. I alone, I suspect, stand for what passed of the human race.\n\nI alone\u2014and *him*.\n\nI\u2019ve roamed, I\u2019ve hidden. I\u2019ve squirreled myself behind padlocked bunkers, and concealed myself within the the heart of old sewers. Still he finds me, leaves it like a gift at the foot of the bed. It\u2019s not a gift!\n\nBefore the End, it may have seemed so. I remember the day so clearly.\n\nI was five, gap-toothed in front of the banner that read I was the grand prize winner. He introduced himself to me, then\u2014a firm handshake and a grin.\n\n*Hi, I\u2019m George. I\u2019m a deliveryman. I heard you won the big prize. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve never missed a monthly visit.*\n\nHis grin hardened. His eyes went flat. *Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t ever, ever let you down.*\n\nIt\u2019s not a gift. It\u2019s not a prize to live in these dark times. When the End came, we said that Satan walked this earth. Well, I never saw Satan, but I can tell you one thing: I know his deliveryman.",

WHERE CAN I FIND YOU!? HOW DO YOU KNOW?!? PLEASE WHY ME?!?!\"  DO YOU HAVE FRESH WATER?!\n\nIt was Too late. Once again they were gone, and The unmistakable buzzing of the delivery drone was fading off into the distance.\n\n\"Do YoU hAvE FrEsh WaTeR?!\" I mocked myself audibly as i picked up my monthly delivery. To most that question may not seem too daft at a time like this, but my situation is not like most. Obviously they had water because you need water to make Oreos.\n\nI  remember Squinting to read and fill out that Highlights Magazine insert in Dr. Holdens' office. It was titled \u201cLIFETIME OREO GIVEAWAY\u201d I was 6 years old in for my yearly physical. All i was thinking about was mountains of Oreo cookies and a trip to a real factory. \n\nWhen i got the letter in the mail i thought it was a joke. I had my mom read it to me just to make sure i had actually won.\"WOW YOU ACTUALLY WON CHARLEY\" She Seemed almost as excited as I was while reading the letter. \"They are  going to fly us out to Virginia to visit the factory in October for your birthday.\"\n\nThe letter explained that i would receive 2 packages of Oreos a month that worked out to 3 cookies or one serving a day. At first i was a little disappointed. Ninety cookies a month was no where near the endless mountains i had envisioned, but at a time like this i knew i was lucky.\n\nThe war seamed to be effecting everything at that time. Power, Water, food was all being restricted. Dad said they were making progress pushing back the forces in the Old Texas. \"Fighting a war on 2 fronts has never really worked\" he wrote, \"But if anyone can do it WE can!\"The Canadians scared me most. Probably because the pamphlets they dropped on our city. Mom told me it was propaganda and to ignore it all.\n\nThe day of my first scheduled delivery I was sitting my living room. The cartoons on the TV were flickering in and out as always. I was watching my favorite show. They even had a war time special on this afternoon. \"NUCLEAR NANCY AND THE FIGHT FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION\". \n\nWatching her use her super powers to fight back and help the troops in the trenches made me hopeful. The best part was about to come up. Nancy always saved the day with her power ring just in time to rescue all the soldiers.\n\nShe was going to say it \"NUCLEAR POWER ACTI\"-......\n\nEvery thing went black. The power was out to everything in the house. I was so mad why at a time like this would....\n\n\\*BANG\\* BANG\\* BANG\\*\n\n\"HOLY Sh\\^%\" I blurted out. A phrase i knew i was safe to say as mom was still at work. \"who could be at the door\" I thought to myself.I looked through the peep hole and saw a man my dads age. A tall man with a VERY nice suit, shiny shoes, and a pin that said AG.\n\n\"Who is it?\" i asked.\"Delivery for a Mr. Bucket\" he said with a pronounced British accent.I opened the door to explain.\"I am sorry sir my father is not home. He is out fight-\"\"This package is for a mister Charlie Bucket\" he interrupted \"That is you correct sir?\"-\"Yes sir but i never get anything\" i responded.\"Well now you do Mr Bucket. Every month in fact. Have a good day\", and with that he tipped his hat turned around and walked away.\"Oh and Mr Bucket\" he looked over his shoulder \"Be sure to open that in a jiffy\"\n\nI remember opening the box.I remember reading the note.\n\n**Mr. Bucket,     Please go to the basement to claim your bonus gift.**\n\n**Forever yours**\n\n**O.R.E.O.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember being Confused i walked towards the basement door. \"Bonus gift\" i said to myself. \"the letter never said anything about a bonus gift\"\nI remember opening the door to the basement.\nI remember grabbing the flashlight off the shelf and starting to walk down the stairs.\nThe last thing i remember was Heat.\n\n30 years has passed from the day those bombs were dropped, and still no answers.\n\n359 \"special deliveries\" each one with their own notes. and i still have them all.\"Go west\"- guided me from the fallout\"Don't trust her\" -saved me from a drifter\"11-37-59\" - the combination to a wall safe with ammunition\n\nIt used to freak me out, but now this is my life. My Oreo guardian angel. Always there to save the day!\n\nI sat down in my little shack with my drone delivered package. As i opened it i realized this is a bit heavier normal. opening the package i was greeted with not my typical Oreos.These were weird Oreos. The inside looked like a blue Gel. Even the note was hand written not printed like normal.\n\n***MR. Bucket       I have tried for a long time to get access to your file. You are not like the others Mr. Bucket.***\n\n***I hope you find these to be most satisfying. These are my favorite type of oreo and figured you may be needing the extra energy in the coming weeks. Be careful not to over do it on your first go around!Oh and Mr Bucket..***\n\n***Make sure to eat one in a jiffy***\n\n***EAT ONE NOW***\n\n***GET DOWN AND RUN***\n\n***Forever your........***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBANG\\* BANG\\* BANG\n\nBullets ripped through the shed before i could even finish reading.  My head ringing i dove to the floor grabbed the oreos and did what i learned to do. Trust the letter.\n\nI woke up in a daze.... \" what the\".... \" where am I\"\n\nI remember Getting shot\n\nI remember blood\n\nI remember reaching for the oreos\n\nI remember taking the first bite.\n\nThe last thing i remember was heat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Their putrid sickly sweet chocolate smell haunts my dreams at night.\n\n\nThey said \u201clifetime supply,\u201d but they never explained just how many fucking Oreos they'd send each month. I\u2019m not entirely sure why marketing decided that two truckloads of oreos was an appropriate monthly amount.\n\n\nI was like a big, \u201cOreo\u201d fan initially, but even I was like, \u201ctwo truckloads a month?\u201d I would have been fine with a couple of boxes...\n\n\nAnd then these trucks just kept showing up monthly, each dropping off shipping containers - leaving em where I was staying. Of course the shipping containers, full of food, became a breeding ground for animals - especially raccoons. Nasty, oreo-diarrhea-fueled raccoons.\n\n\nEvery single spot I settled just became a cornucopia of shipping containers, plastic packaging, and violent, shitting animals.\n\n\nYou may think, wow! It\u2019s the apocalypse, and you have unlimited animals to eat. How great! Friend, have you ever eaten an animal that has survived off nothing but Oreo cookies? Their meat becomes dry and sticky. Upon first consumption, one begins to vomit immediately. \u00a0\n\n\nSo I kept moving. Which, by the way, is not easy to do. The world is like really fucking over. There are bands of dudes with weapons that just rove around killing people with these giant spikes. Not to mention flash floods of what can only be described as liquid fire.\n\n\nI\u2019m out of ideas at this point. I\u2019m pretty tired of moving. Everywhere I go, those oreos find me. I\u2019ve tried getting this to stop. But nobody\u2019s even driving those trucks. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\n\nAnyways, this\u2019ll be my last entry. I fully expect to expire at the end of this year. The animals have been moving closer. I suspect they plan to eat me. I cannot blame them. They\u2019ve had nothing but oreo cookies for months. \n\n\nMy only hope, is that the oreo deliveries do not follow me into the afterlife.\n\nBe well,\n\n         -Thomas",

            "comment": "\u201cThanks again Dave\u201d\n\u201cNo problem, buddy. I\u2019ll see you next time!\u201d\n\u201cCould you bring me some milk next time? These things dry out my mouth.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, buddy. That\u2019s not in the contract. No can do.\u201d\n\nDave walked away from my camp. He was in the same blue uniform he\u2019d been wearing since it started. Navy blue shirt and shorts that ended right above his knees, and a little backwards blue cap. Never a spec of dust on him or a crease in the uniform. His black, rubber shoes always shiny. \n\nI\u2019d given up a long time ago on following him. He always walked calmly, even when he knew I followed him, but eventually he\u2019d turn a corner, I\u2019d look away, I\u2019d blink, I\u2019d sneeze, SOMETHING. ANYTHING would happen and he\u2019d be gone. No explaining it. No use questioning it. If it meant I constantly had at least some type of food that was fine by me. My only complaint? I couldn\u2019t stand how he always called me buddy.\n\nDave would only answer contract questions. He said the contract ran up when I did. So as long as I saw Dave within thirty days, I knew I\u2019d be safe for the next thirty. He also told me the contract says a lifetime supply is at minimum a single Oreo per day. So I always received roughly 30 Oreos a month. It was a nice way to keep track of the passing years. If I got 28 cookies it was February, and I could figure it out from there. \n\nI\u2019ve only gotten 28 three times since the whole apocalypse thing happened. I damn near shit myself the first time. Thought I\u2019d die at the end of the month, just before I was due to see Dave again. And to think, I wouldn\u2019t have the chance of saying goodbye to the guy.\n\nI have to admit, his agelessness creeped me out. He\u2019d been 16 when I won the contest and he\u2019s still 16 now. 20 years later. For 17 years that weirded me out. Thought it was a trick. Maybe he was a clone, or had several children who all just looked the same? Was there a long line of immaculate Daves each replacing the next at the start of every year? But then I got busy. You know, surviving and all? Who has time to question those things anymore.\n\nDave\u2019s useful for more than just the cookies. Keeps me from going crazy. He\u2019s always a little chatty, you know how 16 year olds can be when they\u2019re in the right mood for it? Well he\u2019s always in the right mood, always chatty. Nice guy, I gotta tell you. And that\u2019s exactly what you need at the end of a month of surviving and hiding from the nuclear rain that comes down every so often. And I always know when to expect him. When that last cookie is gone, he\u2019ll be there the next day. I\u2019ll have a friend on the way.\n\nI do wonder where he comes from. Always talks about what a long journey it is.\n\nBut he did say something peculiar once. Something about how the contract\u2019s binding. Something about the terms and conditions I didn\u2019t read. Something about how my turn will come to help. I hope I get to become a Dave. I\u2019d love to be so clean again.",

            "comment": "I used to think I was the luckiest person in the world. When I was 7 I entered my name in a contest and won a lifetime supply of Oreos. There's nothing more incredible at that age to think you would be getting a free package of cookies once a month for the rest of your life.\n\n10 years later, my luck continued. My family was one of the few that survived the bombs to crawl out of the rubble of our home. Times were tough for everyone then of course. Uncontaminated food was scarse. The first month afterwards my luck continued as my package of cookies dropped down next to me right on time. I guess there's an automated factory and drone delivery system or something, but honestly I didn't really question it that much. The nutrition value of Oreos is low but when food is short you're grateful for anything you can get.\n\nAs the years passed, the Oreos continued to be a lifesaver. Both for eating directly, and also for trading with those that had better food and wanted to remember what things were like before. Eventually the army showed up, under orders from the president, to \"bring order back to the nation\". \n\nThe \"president\", wasn't of course the president when the bombs fell. I doubt he was even in the line of succession and most definitely hadn't been voted in. Regardless of how he entered office, it soon became pretty obvious that he was just a warlord, using the title to give his rule the veneer of legitimacy. \n\nAs luck would have it, the man loves Oreos, is completely addicted to them. On learning this I assumed I could trade my package to him each month for all the food, water and supplies I wanted. I figured he could never hurt me because like the Goose that Lays the Golden Eggs, if I die the Oreo packages stop coming. How wrong I was. \n\nSometimes I dream about before I was a \"guest\" of the president. Back when I could still walk, talk, or even see. See the problem with a lifetime supply of Oreos, is that I only need to be *alive* for them to arrive, and the president continues to do everything he can to guarantee I stay alive for a long, long time.

This must be the third time this month!\u201d\n\nI push myself from the armchair, stand up and begin to  walk the flight of stairs to the top of the bunker. \u201cToday of all days huh?\u201d \n\nSeveral soldier solute me as I make my way up. They look like children, my heart grows heavy for them.\n\nWe no longer have power to run the elevators. But a small gas generator powers some important equipment. \n\nI\u2019ve designated a small team to search for a way to repair or replace the old emergency power source. But he hadn\u2019t heard back from them for weeks. \n\nI finally reach the top of the stairs, I\u2019m old now and constantly I am reminded of it. \n\u201cMarcus.\u201d I huff out\n\n\u201cYes father.\u201d A young man snaps to attention. His hair is black, his eyes are green and his face is angular. \n\n\u201cI believe you have a report for me.\u201d I\u2019ve taken a nearby chair, I swear those stairs get longer each time.\n\n\u201cYes father.... today is Tuesday.\u201d And my son takes out several calendars, as all ancient and ragged they\u2019ve managed to keep track of days without sunlight for so long.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware it\u2019s Tuesday.\u201d I say\n\n\u201cYes, for as long as I\u2019ve lived the Ragnor have never arrived on Tuesday... only the others.\u201d The room falls silent and tense at the word others.\n\n\u201cFather! Should we close the gatehouse? The others have never missed a delivery.\u201d Panic strikes his face and the sound of an alarm floods the room.\n\n\u201cThey are here!\u201d A red haired woman stands and reaches for the large over behind her. \n\n\u201cNot yet Shore. Alex, Sky, And Rain follow me.\u201d I stand and make my way down to the gatehouse. Several guards are piled behind sandbags and concrete dividers. \n\nMy son, and Sky return form the armor as I ready the troops.\n\n\u201cFather, here\u201d Alex hands me a weathered M1911. He has his grandfathers browning shotgun. It\u2019s a miracle it\u2019s still in working condition.\n\n\u201cSky.\u201d He has blond hair. He is only 16. He is amongst the first born in the bunker. \u201cStay in the back, of things start going poorly get back to Shore and close the gates.\u201d\n\n\u201cYessir\u201d He is reluctant. But he knows his duty.\n\n\u201cLeader, they will be here in under a minute.\u201d Rain Says. His helmet crushes down his long curly hair. His skin is dark, and his eyes light brown.\n\nThe Ragnor invaded earth nearly 3 decades ago. They never saw us as equals. And why would we expect them to. A pest exterminator doesn\u2019t get down on all fours and catch rats with their hands. No they make the living space inhospitable. The kill everything and everyone around its target. To this day I fear that I\u2019m that target. \n\nThere is no other explanation for the delivery men, showing up just like they did 20 years ago. Not even a spec of dust on their brown uniform, no gas mask or clean suit to protect them from the wasteland outside. The only logical answer is they work for the Ragnor.\n\nGunfire opens up, several beast like creature only just clear the tunnel entrance.\n\nAutopsy reveals these creatures aren\u2019t the Ragnor.. as they the themselves never seem to leave their ships. These creatures had been once human. Turned feral, they have a wide variety of shaped but our researchers have classified them into 3 types, ghouls, vampires, and behemoths.\n(Our researching team plays a lot of dnd... and the creatures don\u2019t share much in common with any fantasy characters.) ghouls are humans adapted to be faster and stronger. It seems they are little more then vicious animals. Vampires still have a high level of intelligence, capable of tactics and tool use. And behemoths... I don\u2019t know what to say other then they are massive. Much larger then is generally considered \u201cpossible.\u201d  More then 300,000 lbs, and taller the 100 feet, these behemoths are living terraformers.\n\nBodies begin to flood the tunnel. Ammo hasn\u2019t been a problem in a while, however space is. The corpses of creatures stack up to the ceiling towards the entrance. \nWith every new obstacle the ghouls reach further and further into the tunnel. \n\n\u201cGrapeshot!\u201d I order several second go by as the soldiers ready.\n\n\u201cCun choooo.\u201d A artillery piece fires a handmade shell out the tunnel. Inside the cave the sound is definitely capable of rupturing your eardrums. But the guards have very heavy ear protection.\n\nNear silence as the cave reverberates with sound. One man even checks if his earcovers area still on.\n\n\u201cRaaaoorr!\u201d Here comes the second wave.\nA deep guttural cry rips down the passageway. There are a lot more Rags to kill.\n\n\u201cFire!\u201d This  time the Vampires have prepared a plan. Some small Vampires run in behind the ghouls. Lifting large metal sheets above their heads. Anything from car hoods to stop signs. They throw the scrap into piles and hide behind it. It\u2019s not enough to deflect most rounds. But it does obscure vision. The adult vampires run in to the makeshift bunkers. Firing bows and slings. They don\u2019t really pose much of a threat at this distance. But the skirmishes are just supporting the ghouls.\n\n\nThe vampires leader roars once more, and a phalanx of shield bearers enters the tunnel. Two rows of really sturdy shield push into the cavern. They are carrying reinforced glass shields. The must have gotten them from the bank down the road.. I wish I had though of that. Behind the shield wall are even more vamps. They are carrying both handmade weapons and anything they could scavenge, from pitchforks to bent rebar. \n\n\u201cRain!\u201d I call out. \n\n\u201cYessir.\u201d Rain Fire Into to shield wall. In between even the smallest gaps with his 223. Remington. Shields bearers or those behind them begin falling. Any time a gap is made Rain makes the hole larger so the rest can fire and devastate the Phalanx.\n\n\u201cUmm excuse me!\u201d A human squeezes his way through the shield wall. \u201cI\u2019m a little late, could you let me through.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d the human in a brown uniform gives me a small grin. \u201cI have a package for... uh, Jim?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes that\u2019s me,\u201d I say \n\n\u201cGood, sign here.\u201d The mad pulls out a clipboard and puts his thump on the position I\u2019m to sign.\n\nBased on the amount of addresses on the sheet of paper there are a lot of deliveries this guy is supposed to make. And not one other signature anywhere on the clipboard.\n\nThe delivery man hands me a small package. And walks back the way he came. All the while gunfire and monsters surround him. He moves gracefully. Not bumping into any Rag if they way out.\n\nThe vamps are nearly to us now. \u201cSpears!\u201d I call out. And our soldier meet theirs.\n",

RUN.'\n\n**\\*MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH, C'MERE YOU** \\*\n\n3 or 4 days ago\u2014the kids don't know, they've lost track of time, lost a way to keep it--The Ten Luckiest Kids In America(tm) who pulled a golden Oreo from the packaging were picked up by the Oreo Corp and brought to the main Oreo Headquarters. It was part of their Willy Wonka 7 crossover, hoping to gain back the markets lost to Vienna Fingers and those pretzels with the peanut butter bugs inside.\n\nThe reward? An invitation to O. Reo X55VT factory, the latest in Oreo Delivery Bot technology, where they were to receive their Perma-Sealed vouchers for the lifetime supply. As long as those boys had beating hearts, Oreos would be delivered to them\n\nSoon, Oreos were flying off the shelves. Free Oreos forever? Not only did it sound delicious, but it was economically viable, with hundreds of mouths potentially being fed from America's Favorite Cookie. From the richest kids to the poorest, dollars were coming out of the Munch Cards of americans and straight into the Oreo corp.\n\nEven with careful placing to extend the promotion and milk the most, it didn't take long for the tickets to be pulled. There were ten kids, all ushered into the factory, through the many illustrious halls, past the thousands and hundreds and thousands of bots whirring below and above and around as they trudged through the factory and finally reaching the last tasting room. It was the willy wonka tour of Oreos, except all the kids made it through to the end room fine, a long room with a long table awaiting them.\n\nAn O. Reo X55VT\u2014tall, large, similar to the attack bots in New Vegas, y'all know what I mean--awaited them at the head of the long, magnificent table of polished marble and slate, the walls tall, adorned with tapestries of Oreos abound. On either side of the O. Reo stood business types, older, greyed tips, and warm faces. This was the best day of their lives!, they said and such as they welcomed the kids, this is the magnificent future!\n\nSoon plates came in with all sorts of Oreo delights, from the actual Oreo itself to ice cream to candies to yogurts to cakes to pastries and everything that could have a grain of sugar in it. The kids at themselves full, oh they could not stop eating, with Oreo after Oreo. Each time they dipped an Oreo into the massive glasses of milk in front of them, a O. Reo would come in to replace it, a fresh deep each time. It was heaven!\n\nThen, the sirens went, the lights red, and panic set in on all the organics.\n\n'Oh no.' Said one executive. 'Is it happening?'\n\nThe other didn't answer.  A bead formed. 'Well kids, aren't you just having the luckiest day? It turns out, the day the bombs actually drop, you're \\***here**\\*, the best bomb shelter in the world, with a lifetime supply of Oreos! That means not only are you safe, but you'll have a food source for the rest of your lives!'\n\nA louder siren raged. The face of the O. Reo turned into countdown instead of smiling, welcoming &amp; warm. The letters read against the cold computer background. The executives turned white, the kids grew more scared.\n\n'Sir?' One kid piped up, 'Why are there numbers?'\n\n'Well, I shouldn't really be wasting time,' one executive said as the other ran out the door, the one staying keeping the facade of familiarity, the other broken beyond repair, only able to go where his legs demand, 'But you kids really oughta run. Or hide. Or something. Cause somebody not here, well, they \\* own\\* these cookies, ok? And they need them. And he can feed us for...well...you better hope radiation clears in a couple days.'\n\nThe bot remained completely still at that time going forward, except for the feeders. If they knew what they would do in no time...those bots did not show fear, anticipation, anxiety, not one bit of foresight into the horrors they would engage in; they would all learn how still a robot could be, how fast it could fly with blood in its eyes, where the quiet ones wait when you sleep. They would find the kids, or try to, feed as many as the found kid could eat, and then go get more. 2 days, the kids did not know that some would be fed like ducks with a liver to turn, some did not know the horror a joy brings. The kids did not know how well they could hide. The kids did not know how loud they could scream through sealed lips.\n\nThe man ran. The kids looked around. The sirens blared. The horror awaited. The lifetime supply would soon be over. When there's none left to force, why waste the life? The kids knew. The kids ran. The kids hid. If only they know.",

They're not when I start running out of water, or when I get injured and can't find the first-aid kit.\n\nNo, the most dangerous days are when I remember.\n\nMemories come rushing in like a flood, and even the palest shadow of happier times paralyzes me with sadness.\n\nBlue skies. Sunny days, and nights filled with mystery. A younger, less scarred me. A less scared me. The world has colour again.\n\n______\n\nI laugh with my family, enjoying the food my mother cooked me for me. It's the day before I leave for university, you know, so of course she had to make a special meal.\n\nMy brother, upset at the fact that tomorrow, my room will be empty and I'll be hours away.\n\n\"Aww, is the little baby sad that I'm leaving? Don't worry; I promise I'll call often.\" I tell him, and he grimaces at me.\n\nMy tone is teasing, but my sentiment is sincere. Nothing will stop me from calling my family.\nRight?\n\nSuddenly, my dad appears in the doorway, his face confused.\n\n\"Tell me why you've gotten a letter from Nabisco, of all places?\"\n\nMy brow creases, and I take the letter, opening it carefully.\n\n\"What is it?\" My mum asks worriedly, and I pass the letter to her, grinning delightedly.\n\n\"You know, I don't think you'll have to worry about my food at university anymore! I've just decided my daily meal plans - nothing but Oreos.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't joke about that! You're going to become diabetic!\" She groans as I read the letter out loud to my brother.\n\n\"We are pleased to inform you that you have just won a lifetime's supply of Oreo cookies!\" I read gleefully.\n\nMy brother bursts out laughing, and after a beat, everyone else at the table does too. The future looks bright.\n_____________\n\nThe foolhardiness of youth. \n\nI snap back to reality when the tiny bit of bread in my hand falls to the ground. It's so stale, it sounds like a rock has fallen.\n\nGroaning, I pick it back up, knowing it'll be my only meal of the day.\n\nAnd once again, the temptation creeps back into my heart, to creep out to the box I have stored in the back, to the one thing that could make me fall apart.\n\nBecause the most dangerous days are when memories overwhelm me, and those saccharine, fat filled biscuits contain nothing but memories of happier times. I know if I allow myself to let one enter my mouth, I will never be able to recover. I will collapse under the weight of all my loss, all the pain I have buried inside me.\n\nI don't know where they come from. I don't know how they manage to get through the things that haunt the outside. I don\u2019t know who still remains to keep sending them to me. But I do know this.\n\nThose Oreos, undoubtedly, will be the death of me.\n\n",

            "comment": "Seventeen is a magical age. Sure you can't drink or even buy cigarettes, but as far as I'm concerned, it's the best age. I got my first car at 17 (a used Taurus). My first relationship started and ended when I was 17 (a brand new Sara). And I was 17 when my Oreo and fluffernutter pie won the Nabisco Oreo Baking Challenge. I made the crust with ground up Oreo and made the filling with peanut butter, marshmallow fluff, and cream. It was a cavity in a bowl and it won me a lifetime supply of my favorite cookie. I received my first package of my lifetime supply about the same time that I first heard the word \"caldera.\" It sounded like some wannabe metal band. I changed the channel. A few weeks later I turned 18 and the sun went away. I miss the sun. I don't miss being 18.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm staring down my 48th birthday having spent the past three decades living off of Oreos. Every month, I wake up and find a package of 36 cookies next to me. The packaging hasn't changed in years. It still says \"Milk's favorite cookie!\" which seems a bit cruel in a world without milk. In any case, I'm lucky to have them. At first I split up the cookies with my family. After my parents and Carly were killed, I marked my 19th birthday by eating the entire pack in one sitting. Eventually I put together an existence of sorts in Shenandoah National Park. I built a respectable hovel and even made a mailbox out of  balsam fir. Every month, I'd check the mail for my Oreos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver time, more people joined me, building their own hovels next to mine in a community. I wish I could tell you they joined because of my charisma or my building skills. But that would be a lie. All seven of my neighbors joined when they learned about my Oreos. You see, spending years and years without any sugar makes you crave it so much that it becomes more valuable than gold. Sure you can forage for wild strawberries, but there's no substitute for the real thing. Every month, each of us got four Oreos. We would have gotten 4.5, except one of my neighbors used to be a priest and made us use the rest for communion. I was the king of my own mini-empire. For the first time since the lights went out, I was happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was until I kicked out of my own paradise. Why did my neighbors turn on me so? It turns out you can't eat hundreds of cookies and not brush your teeth without getting a few cavities. And gingivitis and tooth decay aren't pretty in a post-apocalyptic world. They blamed me and I had to get out of dodge in a hurry. Now I don't eat any more Oreos, I use then as currency when I need to barter. Maybe I'll eat a few for my birthday next month. I'll be 48. If I can find a candle, I'll be wishing I was 17 again.",

            "comment": "I am an old man and I live in a corpse of a world. It's hard to remember much of the world's life, I have a vague mushy but generally inviting soup of memories, the concepts of streets, smiles, and sunlight drifting around in it like the processed frozen chicken and letter-shaped pasta you can find in a typical can of soup at a supermarket. Or more rather, would have found if it hadn't been looted decades ago.  \n\nI've missed hot soup more than anything in the past years. The smoke and ash have smothered the sun with a bleak, oppressive wall after the bombs, so it's cold. Very cold. But thankfully for me, that seems to be the extent of my worries as I usually have something to eat.\n\nOne of the few things I recall about my life before the bombs were winning a contest. No clue what it was, I think it involved counting something, but the prize, well the price I couldn't forget even if I wanted too. Oreos. A lifetime supply of little cookies. The Ad said I'd get the cookies once a month for some reason I got them once a week. They were usually gone before their replacements came in though. Eventually, I got sick of the damn things, started selling at school or at work when I grew up. Then I let my kids have them. Then the bombs dropped. Then I didn't have kids anymore.\n\nThen they kept coming.\n\nI would like to tell you how shocked I was on my first post world shipment or explain the seemingly magical means they appear in my sack every Friday at 9:00 AM, but I can't really be bothered to question my blessing. The world after the bombs is more of a bleak depressing purgatory than the hellish TV renditions I can sometimes coax out of my memory soup. Very few people survived. I can probably count the number of people I've seen since the world drowned in fire with the fingers on both of my hands, and I'm missing a few. But there's one group I remember. The one that made me realize these little snacks were a blessing.\n\nIt was 3 families, A mom and two children, A couple and their Newborn, and finally a couple of children who looked nothing like either of the sets of parents so my guess is their's didn't make it and they were brought in with the group at one point. I couldn't tell you for sure. I never spoke to them. I simply humored my inner voyeurist and observed them in their journeys for nearly a week. \n\nThey were struggling. The cold had softened them up, but the real thing literally eating away at them was the hunger. I saw them, they were skinny and frail and covering less ground day by day but one night, a very cold snowy night mind you, as I was watching them from a hill above their camp they did something that struck a chord with me. They broke into song. In the face of death, they sang happy songs about winter, bells, lights, and cheer. Their words danced through my ears and into my brain, teasing out memories of prewar times with my own family, and in doing so changed something within me. I had smiled for the first time in nearly a decade since the bombs dropped.\n\nA few hours later they were all asleep in a few different ruined houses and I knew what I was going to do. \n\nI slipped on my trusty red winter jacket and hat, grabbed my sack full of Oreo packs I had saved over the years and left my camp towards theirs. I wormed my way through the nuclear winter, and while my portly body acted as a nice source of warmth, it wasn't enough to stop my cheeks from turning bright or my long white beard to get caked in the frozen offal of the sky. After a near half hour of decent, I made it to the camp. I snuck into each house one by one and left packs of Oreos by the foot of everyone's beds. Every man and woman got a pack of Oreos. Sadly the children didn't get a pack of Oreos.\n\nThey got nearly 20. Each.\n\nAfter I closed the final door, or what's left of it(quietly of course) I made my way about 20 paces from the camp. I looked back for a moment, smiled yet again and mosied on my merry way, humming the tune of what I now remembered as \"Jingle Bells\", each hard crunch in the tainted snow taking me away from the first sign of life I had seen in years.\n\nIf there are people out there, somewhere they deserve to blessed as I have been. The spirit of giving is now never-ending.",

It's been many seasons since the collapse and they still..keep..coming. It's funny, my mom always told me that she would always have my favorite snack even if the world tore us apart. She said as her miracle child she would always spoil me because as a kid, I had some disease that now, just seems like a dream. I sometimes wonder if she is still looking out for me in the after life. Anyways there were a few times i thought i heard voices, almost like people I used to know. It's crazy how isolation works. You hear and see things you normally wouldn't. Still, I'll keep searching, until the day I eventually meet my mom again. You know call me crazy but sometimes I feel like I can see her in the distance but...it's never her...it never will be. \n\n\"Hey it's time to go home.\"\n\n\"I know, let me just leave his oreos on the table. I love you sweetheart. Never forget that, I'll always be here.\"",

            "comment": "I miss the days when life was simple. As a kid I had not a care in the world. I would stay out late until the street lights came on and then when I heard my mother calling me I would go inside and have dinner with my family. Those were simpler times. When I look at the world left behind after the apocalypse wiped out everything I loved I can't help but wonder if things could have been different. I mean why me?\nYou see I am the last guy on earth, or at least I thought I was. When I was kid I thought everything revolved around me and when I was left to my own devices several years ago I found out how isolating that really is. All the things I thought were important seem minor when I have nothing left but some stupid oreos and the ruins of a life I once shared with people I loved. I thought it was a dream come true when I was just a kid and I found out that I won a lifetime supply of Oreos. I think I was 10 then. I had bragged to my friends about how I would eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was excited when the first delivery came, and then the next ones after. It was the highlight of my existence. I had been so consumed with those damn cookies that I hadn't even noticed that people were disappearing. It was subtle at first, the mailman didn't come around anymore, then the garbage man. When I had finally started paying attention to something other than how long it took for America's favorite cookie to disolve in milk I was the only one left. It turns out, the apocoalyspe hadn't been fire and brimstone like we all thought it would be. It was more like invasion of the body snatchers only there were no replacements left behind to mimic the people who were kidnapped. Instead there was no one. Just me and these damn Oreos. I started getting scared. I was a little kid and I was all alone, so I started going around, I knocked on doors and if the place was nice enough I lived there for a while and wouldn't you know it, each month, I got those oreos. At first I was happy that something in my life was consistent considering the turmoil I was living in. No one to tell me when to shower or brush my teeth. No mom to wash my clothes and cook me food. Just me and these oreos. Every single month. I'm not ashamed to say that as a kid I wasnt the brightest crayon in the box. Hell, to this day I am still not winning any IQ tests but I started to wonder where the hell these Oreos were coming from. I'm not usually one to look a gift horse in the mouth but I never even entered a contest to win the damn things, so how did I get chosen? The older I got and the more deliveries I received I started considering this. I still ate the cookies because they gave me comfort, but I was still suspicious of their origin. What if they weren't really oreos? What if the person sending them to me was lulling me into a false sense of security so he or she could harvest my organs or eat my brains? Okay I started getting paranoid too, sue me.\nOne night I was staying at the governors mansion, turned out he was gone too and as you can imagine I was torn up about it. Anyway I was staying there with all of his top notch gadgetry and his marble floors. I watched the cameras outside the door as I waited for the Oreo delivery. For years I had never actually seen anyone bring them, no one rang the doorbell, they were just there. I thought, if anything, I could catch the guy bringing them to me and ask him where he came from. Maybe he could take me with him to the camp of people who survived the collapse of civilization and I could finally have some new friends. Yeah, I was pretty desperate. So I waited, and waited. Then I waited some more. Finally I heard a noise on the camera and I looked up to see something flying near my door, I ran down the stairs as fast as my legs could carry me, excitement bubbling in my chest. I flung the door open and in front of me with a box of oreos was an Amazon delivery drone. Talk about anticlimactic. Apparently the thing was programed to delivery packages no matter what. So there were no people. Only an amazon warehouse somewhere that still have a lifetime supply of oreos, and some drones that still delivered them to me, every single month. But how did they find me?",

            "comment": "I couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nI had always been a lucky kid. Once, I entered a raffle at my local Welborn\u2019s Grocery Store for a Tide Racing jacket and won. I was only 8 years old and the jacket was way too big for me but I loved that thing. This time at Welborn\u2019s it was a lifetime supply of Oreos. And I absolutely adored Oreos.  So even though I slipped in as many raffle tickets as I could fill out, slightly tipping the odds in my favor... I was still in utter disbelief as a 10 year old slightly overweight kid when my parents told me the store called and I won another raffle for a lifetime supply of Oreos. \n\nThat Tide jacket got a lot of use later in life, especially after the incident. It was always cold now, and now I was 44. I was extremely thankful that this was an adult sized jacket because I had grown into it, and without it I may not have lived this long in the first place. The warmth and size of the jacket had saved my life many times. This isn\u2019t the story of my jacket however. This is the story of the Oreos. The incident happened when i was 14, no one in my area knows exactly what happened, we were awoken in the dead of night to a very bright light that filled the darkness brighter than the sun for a solid hour. After that hour the light was gone and we haven\u2019t seen a ray of sunshine since. No electricity has ever worked since either causing many rumors about an Electro-Magnetic Pulse or something else that I have no idea about. \n\nAt that time I was terrified. My parents had no idea what to do and since I was an only child and supremely spoiled, I was soft. The first few years were hell. I lost both my parents and had to grow up extremely quickly. I had to become hard. I had to do things and make decisions no child ever should. However the one thing that always remains are these Oreos. I\u2019ve travelled many miles and many states worth of distance since the incident. Everywhere I go everything is always the same. Only people under 20 years of age when the incident happened are still alive today. Things are pure chaos and I have to fight every day to stay alive and to keep my Oreos. The Oreos. The Tide Racing Jacket. The two things that have kept me alive and trucking in such a bleak existence. No matter where I go, or what I do the boxes just keep coming. And it is my mission in life to figure out who gets them to me and where they come from. If I can figure this out and solve this conundrum maybe, just maybe I can save the world. \n\nI can\u2019t believe it. ",

            "comment": "I woke to the sound of rustling plastic. I left the window open again I thought to myself as I slowly sat up and began wiping the thin layer of dust from my skin. The dust rolls in every morning now, just like they said it would. \nI checked my watch. It still read 7:55 just like it did when it stopped three years ago. Old habits.\nI got up from the ground and continued to brush the dust from my lower half and moved towards the open window. The tattered curtains of the old hotel seemed to be enjoying their dance. I slid the window closed and pressed my palm against the warm pane. I made a small circle in the dust on the glass and looked out. It was just like someone put the planet in an hourglass, flipped it upside down and then broke the glass. Times up.\n\nI sighed and turned my back on the window. Not sure this view was any better though. The green, flowered wallpaper was torn in so many different directions, and the room was completely empty, stripped of anything useful. As most places are now. I checked my watch again. My eyes wandered to the empty Oreo package that woke me from my not so restful slumber. I swallowed hard. When would he be back?\n\nWhen I was a girl, I was absolutely obsessed with sweepstakes of any kind. I applied for everything! All of them! If there was a prize to be had, I was going to get it. Except I never did. \n\nUntil one day, when I was about 12 years old and had nearly given up on contests all together. I was just getting home from school when I saw a man and a boy around my age standing on my front porch talking to my mother. When she saw me she smiled and motioned for me to come over. The man billowed out a congratulatory speech as I climbed my front steps and the boy thrust a shiny blue package of Oreos into my hands. I looked down at the cookies and then up at the three smiling faces staring back at me and tried my best to comprehend what was happening. I had won a contest. I actually did it! I had won a lifetime supply of Oreos.\n\nIf only someone had told me that I really won a lifetime of heart ache instead. Every month from that day on, the boy delivered me a package of Oreos. At first it was exciting, absolutely thrilling! But as I grew older, I became more interested in the boy behind the cookies. One day when I was about 16 years old, I got the boy to sit with me on the porch steps and share the package of cookies with me. We laughed and held some long gazes. But it ended with a \"see you next month\". It always ended with \"see you next month\". But each month I got him to stay a little longer.\nThe boy followed me through a move and through college. I asked him multiple times how on Earth he was continuously delivering the cookies no matter where I went or what I was doing. He always just told me it was his job to know.\nAs I grew into a woman and the boy into a man, I started wanting more from him than just cookies. I started wanting him and I sure as hell wanted him more than once a month. But even so, it always ended with, \"I'll see you next month\". \nThe first day the dust rolled in, was the day things got more complicated. I was beginning to realize that I, along with the rest of the world was running out of time. Who was to say how much longer any of us would have here? How much longer we'd have left to live, let alone love.\nOn my next delivery I bore my soul to my cookie man. I told him I couldn't let this world end without him by my side. That if we had any time left at all, I wanted it to be with him. He set the Oreos on the coffee table in front of us and kissed me hard. \n\"I'll see you next month\".\n\nMy eyes were burning from a combination of dust and tears. Remembering everything we've gone through and still as confused as ever. I looked at the section of wall that I ripped the wallpaper from in order to mark the days. I recounted the tick marks. \nHe was supposed to be here yesterday. He's never been late. In all these years, he has never missed a delivery day. \nI picked up the ripped open Oreo package and held it to my chest. If only he had stayed.\n\n I won so much more than cookies that day. ",

            "comment": "Then the lift door slowly opens and a secretary greeted me from a marble desk and escorted me to the heavy wooden door across the elevator.\n\nIt may sound a bit cliche but the man who is seated on the desk is facing the window with his back towards me. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I heard from you.\u201d Slowly he turned his seat and there sitting is my old friend, Kenneth. Kenneth Bartholomew. I was out of words. I don\u2019t know what to say. \n\n\u201cStill remember me, Paul?\u201d Kenneth continued. \n\n\u201cOf course, I do. I haven\u2019t seen you in ages but I will still remember your funny smile!\u201d I finally said. \u201cBut how?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou see, I\u2019m still a physicist but also somehow the CEO of Oreo. Well, I was able to talk to myself from an alternate timeline where you were able to create the cure and save the mankind. But discovered it wont happen here in this timeline, so I need to get you out of that laboratory in Washington. But nothing would keep you out of that place.\n\n\u201cI tried several times time traveling in the past to send you letters and messages through recordings but you wont go out of that facility. You don\u2019t trust any of those messages. But if I would establish a trust from a single thing all through out the years it should start from your childhood. \n\n\u201cSo I bought the Oreo company from the past under a pseudo-name Kent Bartley and made sure you get the winning pack for a lifetime supply of Oreo. It is my favorite you know, so it\u2019s the first thing that came to my mind. \n\n\u201cIt was a success, I established a trust through a lifetime supply of Oreos to take you out of that prison. Here you can continue your research. I made sure all you need is in here to finish the cure.\u201d Kenneth explained. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m all confused. But it really makes sense. You really have spent your lifetime doing all those things?\u201d I replied to him.\n\n\u201cYeah, literally all my lifetime. But traveling through time did not do me any good. It deteriorated my cells faster that i\u2019m already dying. That\u2019s why I made sure this time I\u2019ll get you out of that isolated lab. Even it means buying a whole cookie company and supply you with Oreos every Monday to gain your trust. \n\n\u201cPaul, I don\u2019t have much time left, so all of my assets and properties are planned to be transferred to your name to make sure that all of my works wont go to waste.\u201d\n\nNot to long, Kenneth died leaving me the sole owner of the facility. And finally, I successfully created the cure through the bacteriophage I was working. By introducing the bacteriophage to the infected host, it will attack the virus in the system until none will be left. As soon as the bacteria consumed the Virus, it\u2019ll decay on its own together with the decaying body of a walking dead. \n\nThe cures were delivered through drones together with boxes of Oreos in major cities that we have contact. And with the help of other chemists, we made the cure airborne to be released in the close vicinity of the major cities. This way, it would be easy to scatter the cures against the infected walking corpses.\n\nWith these deliveries came the last supplies of Oreos we have. The supplies may not last for my lifetime but it delivers the beginning of life to many people across the world. ",

            "comment": "Hell came for us faster than we could run. Sometimes when I look back on those days I wonder how we thought we could make it last.\nI\u2019m alone now for the first time in my life. The dog I\u2019d found immediately after The Reckoning, small, pitiful, slightly deformed from the hazardous radiation it had been subjected to in the womb, has been dead for a few months. Even when she was a puppy she was a fighter, bright eyed and sprightly with one slightly clubbed foot that didn\u2019t stop her from meeting or exceeding my pace when we were running, and we were always running. In what little of my imagination I have left I always believed that she would stay with me, young and happy forever, while what was left of the world crumbled around us. 10 years was more than I could have asked for, but it gets so quiet now.\nWhen you live in a world that uses electricity for every convenience, even the quiet tends to feel loud. There\u2019s always an air conditioner running, someone blowing leaves, television left just loud enough to intrude your thoughts. After the first surge I learned what quiet was. That one was small, temporary, but the two weeks we were without power felt like their own lifetime. I chuckle bitterly to myself when I think about how spoiled and soft I was then. Even when you were by yourself it was hard to feel alone. Now the silence roars around me sucking my thoughts away faster than I can have them.\nI keep the same house I had Before. The realtor wasn\u2019t just trying to drive the sale when she told me that the bones were solid and that this house would last through an earthquake. There wasn\u2019t an earthquake, but even as other houses in the neighborhood disintegrate around me my old girl stands tall and proud. They haven\u2019t had the benefit of my fastidious home maintenance, but it\u2019s more comforting to think that she\u2019s magical, that somehow this shell of gypsum and wood are actively protecting me. She\u2019s not, but it\u2019s a nice thought. I don\u2019t keep the same calendar, or any calendar, though, and the days start to bleed and blend together without change. Wake up, forage, repair, and eat what never feels like enough, sleep, repeat.\nThis day starts like all the others. I take a deep breath on my porch. It\u2019s not sunny anymore. Whatever they did to take the power offline had some effects on the weather, and while I can see the disc burning brightly behind the heavy gray clouds it\u2019s never quite warm. I\u2019m light on chores today, finding myself in a sweet spot between a meager harvest from my homemade green room and putting up the winter boards so I don\u2019t freeze to death in the coming months. In a moment of whimsy and despite the fact that everything around me is already turning brown under the threat of winter I decide to venture out to see what I can forage, maybe a bit of lichen or some moss. I\u2019m surprisingly light on my feet, feeling buoyed by the idea of a leisurely day with the thought of finding something, anything green growing in the wild supporting me more than my bones.\nThe whimsy continues after I pick up my knife and basket and wander down my maintained walk. \u201cBetter check the mailbox.\u201d\u00a0 I say, giggling to myself. No one has sent mail for more than a decade, nearly two now, but my fingers grasp the pull and tug regardless. When I open the box I experience a moment of pure cognitive dissonance. It\u2019s filled to the brim with small white boxes with a blue logo. I glance quickly and slam it shut, now laughing and shaking my head. There\u2019s nothing in the mailbox, I have enormous tumor eating through the delicate folds of my gray matter. I open the box again, expecting that the true contents will be revealed, but the boxes are still there, defiantly white and tempting. I can\u2019t quite relay how I feel as my trembling hand pulls out the first box. There are no postmarks, but there is a date written in a fresh hand that dictates that the year is 2041. As I mentioned earlier I\u2019ve long since stopped caring about calendars or days but this makes me frown and start to count. How many equinoxes have there been? How many cold winter days that felt even more endless than the others? I pull the boxes out faster now, dropping them eagerly into my basket. Each one is dated in that same neat hand, one each for the last 18 years. I remembered getting these for a time when I was a child, then for a time longer as an adult, as a result of a contest I had won as a freckle faced youth. With my bag heavy and my mind racing, all thoughts of foraging for the day discarded, I make my way back up the walk and head to my darkened bedroom. I light the hurricane lamp, an early pillage from a sporting goods store 10 miles away that has been with me nearly from the start of this nightmare and get to work.\nStarting with the oldest box first, the one dated 2023, the year of the final surge, I carefully open each one, my jaw dropping just a little wider every time. Every single box was filled with Oreo cookies. A small pack of 6, but more cookies than I had seen in the last 20 years. My heart pounded as I carefully peeled the little bag open, the scent of chocolate hitting me instantly. My mouth waters. More accurately, I drool. I give the first cookie a tentative lick. I don\u2019t immediately recoil, so I take a bite. Thanks to the lack of air or light in the mailbox, they were remarkably crisp and fresh-tasting. I finish the first cookie, and then another. Before I realize what\u2019s happening I\u2019ve finished the first bag, my head spinning with the sugar rush. I\u2019m giddy, laughing hysterically, and high, high, high the way only refined sugar makes you. I then vomit spectacularly, filling my bedroom with a scent that\u2019s acrid and bitter, but still chocolatey. I immediately crash from the excess. This is more calories than I\u2019ve had in a single day in years. Anything rich or fatty I had usually went to the dog to keep her healthy and chubby, and now I\u2019m paying for my impulse and greed.\nIt takes me being sedentary for a moment, my mind wandering in a sugared daze for me to realize how highly unusual this is. Did I eat cookies with an unknown provenance? I sure did. How did they get there? I understand why I might not have been aware of their presence. I haven\u2019t had any need to check the mailbox in years. No need to check for an electric bill. But it did raise other questions. Was there still an Oreo factory somewhere? Is the year 2041? Who was delivering these packages?\nI couldn\u2019t remember the last time I had seen another person. There was more wildlife, the occasional feral dog, but nothing that could open a mailbox or tuck treats inside. Where were they coming from? In my mind I was already hatching the plan. I reasoned with myself that it was unlikely the deliveries had been made during the daytime. I was always awake and working, either fixing my house or gardening in the greenhouse. I would have heard a truck. I would have noticed the smell of exhaust on the wind. The dog would have barked for the ten years she was with me. So, the cookie deliveries were happening at night. I dragged myself upright and went outside, my feet directed not by my head but my heart. Without bothering to get the hammer to carefully pry the nails out, I rip the board I use to insulate the window against the winter chill right off. Inwardly, my mind is spinning. I don\u2019t know when the last delivery was made. I could be 364 or 4 days away from seeing it, but I would see it. When the world went to shit and everyone died around me I assumed I would meet a similar fate. Now with an empty cookie packet in my pocket and a stack of white boxes nested on my nightstand, I know better.\n\u00a0",

    "postText": "[Inspired by this. May turn into an actual story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/147vxq5/wp_i_cannot_apologize_enough_that_your_child_must/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPride.\n\nEcstasy.\n\nJubilation.\n\nExhilaration.\n\nNone of those words could even come a trillion miles close to what I was feeling as I held Alexis in my arms, my beautiful, stupid wife smirking as if she hadn't been halfway to heaven during the process. The only word that could ever dream of seeing my emotions on the horizon is rapture, because this truly is akin to a religious experience. I saw the devil of my own negativity trying to strangle me, hands around my throat as it told me that Beatrice wouldn't make it, that my wonderful daughter wouldn't make it, that I would be a killer of three and all because I was a coward who couldn't say \"No\" and liquid nitrogen was in my blood and ice was in my bones and it felt as if the weight of every sin since Cain first felt envy was doing it's best to crush me-\n\nBut everything is fine. Alexis is sleeping in my arms, as fragile as the peace in my heart. Beatrice, the wild glass goddess she is, is trying to get up out of her bed as if she hadn't just experience one of God's greatest trials. And I... I feel at once with the maker. Whatever name it wishes to take, I feel at one with them. Holding this new life in my arms, I now know that past me was a fucking retard with aspergers who could not ever dream of what this would be like.\n\nHuh. I gently pass over Alexis to Beatrice once again and slowly sit down, arm visibly shaking. It feels as if the world has stopped from how hyper aware I feel. Judging from the growing darkness in the corner, I definitely need to take a rest. It was only when I hallucinated a ethereal, glowing white figure stepping out from that darkness that I really started worrying over my mental state. The figure - an angel? - was trying to have a stoic expression but I could feel the fear, the concern, the guilt etched deep within. The worry turned into fear as I turned over to my wonderful wife, who also sees it. We.... We died?\n\nboth of us?\n\n\"Be not afr- er, wait, that's at least a millennia out of date... Uh... I come in peace!\"\n\nAfter witnessing the presumed-angel not only almost make the meme true, but also say the alien catchphrase, I slid deep into my chair as I could feel the sanity drain from my ears. Beatrice, God bless her, did not try to make some stupid, snarky comment or try to get up to beat an angel for ruining what little peace of mind I had left. However, the silence was far more concerning as she covered the child's face from the light.\n\nA stupid ice-breaker floated out of my mind and out through the mouth.\n\n\"Hah.... N-not exactly how I expected to end up seeing an angel today....\"\n\nThe both of them couldn't help but laugh, Beatrice lightly coughing and the angel sadly smiling afterwards. Hah. I made an angel laugh. I guess I really am a genius, at least comedically. The anger drew breath, no doubt to ring the bell and guide us to awaits, be it heaven or hell.\n\n\"Clark and Beatrice Zhang. Congratulations on the birth of your child. Were it up to me, I would be here only to celebrate the greatest of miracles that you two have experienced. Unfortunately... I am here on the will of Providence.\"\n\n\"I'll go.\"\n\nThe angel's head snapped to Beatrice.\n\n\"I know I shouldn't have survived this. Anemia alone would've made things difficult, but that isn't even including the little cuts I get every day slowly draining what little I've had. I know my time has come, and I will go peacefully, but let me say goodbye.\"\n\nI could feel that cold grip around my heart once more before the angel, merciful and glorious in equal measure, shook their head.\n\n\"No, miss Zhang. Your time is far. Unfortunately, it is not for you I have come for... There is a prophecy.\"\n\nBeatrice is confused. I wish I was as in the dark as her, but I am an avid fan of games and anime. This setup reeks of a call to action. If I am to go to war against the world, so be it, but leave my family out of it. Under the withering brutality of my glare, the angel clears their throat.\n\n\"There are supernatural forces in the world, as my presence here clarifies. Most malicious and ill-willed supernatural entities all either spawn from or are corrupted by The Dragger. However, it is prophesied that one day, a brilliant, hardy, but most importantly compassionate person will be born one day who will manage to bring them down.\"\n\nAs a spark of unbelieving hate flare to life in my chest, the angel takes a shuddering breath. Whether I have broken an agent of God through sheer contempt, or if they truly are broken by damning a newborn to fighting monsters, I know not. But it had better be the latter. They rummage through a satchel, pulling out what looks like a phone, yet looks older than a Nokia and is colored like a ragged piece of parchment.\n\nAnd the name written on it is the final nail in my composure's coffin.\n\n\"I am sorry, but according to the Akashic Record, Alexis Zhang is the he-\"\n\n\"Fuck off.\"\n\nBea, who had by this point seemingly been understandably resigned to follow the fate of the world, recoiled at the yet-unseen venom in those two words. The angel has begun to cry, removing all doubt that the angel truly is sorry and just knows no other future.\n\n\"I- I'm sorry. There is no other way-\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\"L-Lark, honey-\"\n\n\"No. Bea, I am not going to let Odin, Zeus, Demiurge, Karma, Amun Ra, or even Record Scratch McFucking Godhead himself raise our fucking child into being a soldier.\"\n\nAll the energy had left me body at this point. Luckily, wrath makes a good replacement in a pinch, and as I stood up I realized this was a fucking vice grip on my throat. I walked over to the angel, wanting to shove my fist through it's head but knowing what I must do is far different. Instead, I simply held out my hand, to everyone's confusion.\n\n\"So, what is her birthright? Some kind of sword, or a shield? A scepter or rod? Or is it an injection of magic?\"\n\n\"N-no, sir... It's j-just this.\"\n\nThey rummaged through their satchel once again, pulling out a weathered, massive tome.\n\n\"I-it's a grimoire, of all the magical knowledge of all the non-malicious races. A-are you?...\"\n\nI took the book, straining to hold with one hand.\n\n\"Yes. I am going to break fate.\"\n\nWith that, I snatched the damn phone and smashed it with the book, shattering it against the wall as I swung at it with a swat that'd make Babe Ruth proud. Everyone was shocked, and the angel seemed to go pale, muttering...\n\n*\"oh lord above that's my pay for the next month gone...\"*\n\nSitting back in my chair, I immediately began paging through the book. I did not have time to waste. My life was measured, and I have a fucking deadline.\n\n\"...Clark?\"\n\nMy eyes lifted.\n\n\"...Thank you. This was not a good fate.\"\n\n...\n\n\"It was destiny for me to kill it.\"",

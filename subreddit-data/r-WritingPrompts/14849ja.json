            "comment": "I wish I couldn't remember my first life. \r  \n\r  \nI can remember most of my lives, but I really wish I could forget that one. I was filled with anger, lust, greed . . . All the classics, really. And you know what they say: live by, die by. \r  \n\r  \nIt's harder to remember my lives as less-evolved species, while a more developed brain in any given life usually yields clearer memories. I have foggy impressions of being a slippery, six-legged thing somewhere with a purple sky and three moons, where I ended that run in the belly of something much bigger. Clearer yet are my memories of being adored as a family pet. Sadly, the memories of being a neglected pet a few times are just as clear. One of my favourite lives exists in my memory as a time of tranquillity, spent gliding through deep liquid methane oceans, the scales on my colossal form reflecting the bioluminescence of the creatures around me, my size keeping me well and truly off the menu. That was one of the few instances where I think I actually managed to die of old age. \r  \n\r  \nComing back as a member of a literate species was always nice at first. You see, the first quarter to one-third of each new life is spent clear of the memories of past lives. In the lower species, it seems that the memories never fully return, probably due to the lack of processing power, for lack of a better term. Higher species, especially those of the literate type, seem to have the mental bandwidth to recall past lives much more distinctly. \r  \n\r  \nI once spent a good long life, hundreds of years, as a small creature with four eyes, four arms, four legs, and four- well, four of everything really. Throughout that long life, I tried to discovery why I was like this, and more importantly, why I was the only one like this I had met. I calculated, in my time as Mr Four, that I had gone through at least 212 lifetimes on various planets scattered about the galaxy. Actually, probably the universe, I don't see why this would be limited to one galaxy. Nonetheless, throughout all of those lifetimes and all of those worlds, I had not met a single other creature like me. It seems that for everyone else, on every other planet, at every other level of development, death meant death. Or at the very least, if everyone else was being reincarnated, I was the only one who could remember. Asking others about this had led to my death/autopsy/lobotomy at the hands of mobs/scientists/doctors in 42 different incarnations, so eventually I stopped asking. \r  \n\r  \nI would say it was forty to forty-five lives ago that I started to get bored. Twenty to twenty-five lives ago I started to get jealous of those I knew who died for good. Sixteen lives ago I was on a planet just discovering the power of the atom, and I blew myself up at work. Twelve lives ago I was flying an interstellar cargo-transport and took a detour into a blackhole just to see what would happen. Nine lives ago I got bitter and dedicated a lifetime to starting a war on a world of peaceful, kind creatures. I have never been so happy to remember being executed as a failure. \r  \n\r  \nThe last seven lives have been a quest to find a fitting end. I have no concrete reason to believe there even is a fitting end, but belief is what I have chosen. Seven lives ago, my belief system took root on a planet just discovering fire, and it resulted in a religious war for which I feel partly responsible. I hope they ceased their combat after they knotted my tentacles and left me in the desert (a rather peculiar form of execution I must say). Six lives ago, I was convinced that my lives would only truly end if I somehow returned to my first world and my original species. I obsessed over this until I was struck by a public transport hover on my way to the crystal beach.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my memories resurfaced in the subsequent life, I realised finding my way back to the start was probably a futile endeavour. So, five lives ago, I made a decision. The Right Way Out wasn't for me. It never was, and it was not my purpose. Don't get me wrong, I have witnessed far too much of this universe and lived through far too many lives to believe in a higher purpose or power. What I have gleaned, beyond anything, is that each life, yours or mine, only holds the purpose we assign to it. Thus, I decided on mine - to help others find the Right Way Out. Therefore, my last five lives have been devoted to helping those who dread death, to conquer and accept the inevitability of life's end (for everyone but me, it seems). I am at peace with it. I look at my current life, on a vibrant planet teeming with life, and I am content with my purpose to help others find the Right Way Out, or as the quirky bipeds of this planet call it, 'artis bene moriendi'.",

            "comment": "I have changed and grown so much. I began as a selfish wastrel. \"What is in it for me? Why should I care?\" For three cycles of birth and death, I espoused this philosophy. I felt hollow and empty, but assumed that was because I was better than everyone, and only I and a few others could see that everything outside the self was pointless.\n\nThen one day, in my fourth cycle, I fell in love. It began as a selfish infatuation, I wanted them because they made me feel good. But, over time, I came to care for them for who they were, and not just the pleasant feelings they invoked inside me. Then they died, after twenty years together. I was distraught. I swore I would never let myself experience the pain of loss again. I died again, my soul shriveled and alone, but the seed of something profound had been planted inside me.\n\nThe next life, I never had a romantic relationship. Instead, I found a dog by the side of the road. Someone had left her there. I pulled over and she rushed towards me, wagging her tail. She licked by hand, and I took her home. I named her Erin. She was the sweetest creature I had ever known in that life. I walked her every day. Then, eleven years after I found her, she died in her sleep. I wept as I buried her. I walked through the rest of my life with the emotional equivalent of a limp, until I died in a car crash fifteen years later.\n\nThe next life, I was born to a broken family. My father died in a gunfight when I was eight. My mother killed herself when I was ten. But I cared for my brother dearly. We carried each other through the pain. Through the hell of our family, and the hell of the foster care system. We were able to get scholarships for college and attended as roommates. I fell in love again in college. My brother developed a drug problem from the stress of classes. I tried to get him to stop, but to no avail. Then he disappeared, and I went looking for him. I stumbled upon him being beaten by strangers with clubs. I threatened to call the police, and they ran off. I called an ambulance, and held his hand as they rushed him to the hospital. He didn't make it there, a hemorrhage in his brain killed him. I was distraught, and almost ended the relationship with my girlfriend. She convinced me to stick together, and that relationship probably saved my life. We married and grew old together, even having a few children. They meant the world to me. I felt at peace as I slipped from the world, my family around me.\n\nI was a firefighter in the next life. I carried people from burning buildings. I saved lives. I put my life on the line to help strangers. The moment in that life I am most proud of, one that defined me, had nothing to do with fire. A group of bystanders and I watched as a gang of thugs were beating a homeless man with steel rods. I took initiative, and organized myself in the bystanders to intervene as a group. We saved him. When I died, I was shocked by how different I was from the selfish jackass I had started as. But something deep inside me told me there was still so much more for me to become.\n\nI lived dozens of lives, then hundreds. Encountering slightly higher stakes in each. I had setbacks. I did the selfish, easy things in some lives. But the trend was definitely towards the more noble mindsets and emotions. I had moments of repulsive, self indulgent weakness, and moments of great selflessness and strength. I went from small acts of decency, to facilitating decisions and actions that impacted dozens, then hundreds, then thousands. I graduated into higher levels of being and intelligence. Into post-humans and conscious artificial minds. But the struggle was always there. To do the right thing, to make the hard choice, to conquer my own self and my demons for the betterment of all. After living ten thousand lives, I began to wonder what the ceiling was. What would be required of me to ultimately leave the cycle, and enter whatever existed beyond it?\n\nI committed still greater acts of heroism, stained only occasionally by cowardice. I had the sense that heroism was what the cycle was asking of me, wanted from me. I searched for the series of acts that would let me out. I dubbed it \"The Right Way Out.\" At times, I felt the light inside me flicker. I felt the hard earned righteousness inside threaten to grow boring. The darker demons of my nature rearing their heads once more. The eternal enemy of selfish nihilism inviting me to fall. But, by this point, my will was iron. I refused to fall. Perhaps that will be the ultimate test. To be good in the face of the ravages of incredible time spans. I know not when the cycle will be satisfied that I can stay the course. Only that I will fight to be on the side of the right, of the good. For I am the captain of my soul.",

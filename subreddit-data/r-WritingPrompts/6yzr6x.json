            "comment": "I have this recurring dream where my alarm clock is blaring and I open my eyes to see my parents still alive in front of me. My father breathes without the oxygen tank that he had carried around with him for the last six years of his life. My mother\u2019s withering grey curls are a luscious blonde and her cheeks are once again plump and red. She slides her fingertips down my cheek, smiling.\n\n\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d she asks. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d\n\nAnd right before I respond, I wake. My psychologist says that I lack closure, that I still haven\u2019t gotten over their deaths. But I disagree. Their deaths weren\u2019t tragic. Well, of course all deaths are tragic, especially deaths of parents. But my father slipped quietly away into the night on his favorite chair and my mother died holding my hand, surrounded by family who loved her dearly.\n\nThey each had funerals, wakes, and other remembrances. I had an annual tradition of bringing my grandkids to their grave so I could take another shot of whiskey with my father and give my mother lilies as gold as her hair.\n\nStill, my psychologist tells me that a part of me hasn\u2019t yet accepted their death. I want to tell him that I\u2019m eighty-four years old and only here because three grandkids and two children of my own don\u2019t fill the long stretches of silence in my life. They visit, often. But a man still gets lonely. So I don\u2019t tell him. I entertain him, nodding my head and humming as he tells me how to live out the rest of my year or so (being optimistic) as best as I can.\n\n\u201cIt might not be their death,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt might just be death in general. You haven\u2019t accepted it.\u201d\n\nTo which, I smile and nod. It is the polite thing to do. The impolite thing would be to burst out laughing at the thirty year old man recently engaged telling an eighty-four year old about embracing death. I accepted my own mortality very long ago. So once again, I entertain him. I barrage him with questions he could never hope to answer and he does his best.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou\u2019ll find peace. It\u2019ll be like gently letting go and slipping away to whatever next world you believe in. Like falling asleep. Isn\u2019t that nice? When you close your eyes and you gently fall asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise it won\u2019t hurt?\u201d I ask.\n\nHe gives me a smile teeming with confidence, as if he knew anything. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n\nHis words play back to me whenever I go to sleep. And every night, I drift further into my dream. It becomes that much more real. The beeping. The parents. The fingertips. It feels more real than reality, as if my whole life had simply been the dream of a nine year old boy still asleep, but unable to wake.\n\n\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d I hear my mother ask. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d\n\nI open my eyes, expecting to see my popcorn ceiling and revolving wood fan. Instead, I see my mother, her golden locks curling at her shoulders and her fingertips brushing my cheek.\n\n\u201cDid you have a nice dream?\u201d she asks, tears filling her eyes.\n\nI give her a nod and turn toward the alarm clock. It\u2019s not an alarm clock, but a heartbeat monitor. My father stands beside it, his eyes constantly shifting from the monitor to me. He crosses his arms and presses his lips into a thin line.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt,\u201d he says, a tremor in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll find peace. Like falling asleep.\u201d\n\nI give him a nod as well. \u201cOr waking up from a long dream,\u201d I tell him, my voice barely a whisper. It's all I can  manage.\n\nMy father covers his mouth and chokes on his breath. His shoulders heave. My mother squeezes my hand and presses her lips against it. \u201cGood night, sweet prince,\" she whispers. \"Sweet dreams.\"\n\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for 5+ stories weekly and 200+ stories already written!\n\n\n",

They dominate your thoughts as if they have their own gravitational pull drawing you in, because they are so big in your mind.

That for some reason happened to stick with him more strongly than others did, as he goes deeper and deeper. And at the end him re-experiencing it (in totality this time) means he's died for real/reached the limit of nested dreams, and now he's passing by it again - going back the other way?\n\nWould he not have remembered the context of that experience if it was a past feature of his life? Given that I presume he survived that episode in the hospital (or dreamt that he did), he would've eventually gotten discharged - to the relief of his parents - and gone on to become the old man he is. I suppose he may have forgotten it, and the above paragraph still applies.\n\nI do wonder though about the worldbuilding implications of a premise like this. I mean, if everything after the first day you were born is a construct of your mind - how could civilization as we know it even exist? Could you even have had parents in the first place if they too would have died at 1-day old and gone on to hallucinate the rest of their own lives?",

            "comment": "The young man shooting me startled me such that I woke up. Waking up startled was enough to wake me up. Waking up after waking up startled after having been shot shocked me into waking up. Waking up after feeling the shock of having woken up startled after being shot woke me up with a start. Waking up with a start after having woken up shocked after waking up startled after having been shot made me wake up in a panic. \n\nI started to notice a pattern. That being said, it took a long while before I could calm my nerves enough to stay asleep. Awake? Whatever. My mouth was incredibly dry and my head did not have the common decency to cease its incessant pounding. In my state of pain I rolled over in my bed to discover a woman that I did not recognize. Her body was bare and the area around us smelled of booze. Wait, did I have a hangover? That can't be right, I stopped drinking 20 years ago. \n\nI stumbled over discarded bottles of liquor to my bathroom and turned the light on. It was the old lighting fixture, the one I replaced at least a decade ago. My aching brain and eyes took an indecent amount of time to adjust to the sudden shift in light. The man in the mirror was one I long since forgot. Young, and wasting away his youth with whores and alcohol. A man with a house freshly inherited from his recently deceased parents, and instead of honoring them by making something of himself he worked dead end jobs to fund his meager bills and attempts to wash away life. This couldn't be.\n\nI tripped on myself and fell, landing on my head such that it caused me to wake up. Not again.\n\nI calmed my nerves yet again, after a long cycle of waking up, to find that the sun was peaking through my room. Morning. I took a look at my surroundings. Posters of metal bands, clothes lazily displaced throughout the abode, and an old alarm clock that read 6:47 AM in annoying red text. Only a few minutes before I used to wake up for high-school. That meant... no, it couldn't.\n\nAfter running into the kitchen, trying to keep my heart from causing another wake up, I found them. My parents. Still very much alive and surprised to see me awake on time. This was it, my second chance. I could finally make something of myself while my parents are still around, make them not die thinking I was a waste of life. Better, I may be able to protect them, stop them form dying of carbon monoxide poisoning while I was away at my friend's house for the weekend!\n\nI'm still not entirely sure if my fits of waking up are some kind of hallucination or not but one thing is made clear; I know some events that happen in the future. So far things have changed a bit based on my shift in actions from when I last remember but certain big events remain constant. Another thing is also certain, if ever I panic or die, I wake up on the previous day. Again, I am unsure if these are hallucinations or not. I can stop myself from cyclically waking up now though, as I have learned to calm my nerves on a dime. \n\nHere it is, though, my second chance.\n\n\nSorry if things seem sloppy, I saw this and wanted to respond after work but I am tired now. I dunno, if I get enough demand I'll revise and expand upon it when I get a spare moment. Thank's for reading, criticism and comments are welcome. Thank's for the cool prompt, OP.\nEdit: formatting hotfix \nEdit 2: Thanks for the feedback and kind words, lads and lasses!",

The library.\n\n\"Run?\" I repeat stupidly.\n\nShe puts a finger to her soft, red lips. \"*Shh - listen.*\" \n\nAnd again it beats.\n\nIt's as if I'm watching a flipbook of Polaroid snapshots. And she's in each and every one. I'm at a bar, nursing a full pint of lager. A tap on my shoulder.\n\n \"When.\"\n\nA motel room, paint curling off the mouldy wall. She's lying naked on the bed. \"You.\"\n\nThe drum beats.\n\nI'm on the street dressed in rags, holding a can in my hands. She walks by and flicks a coin into the can, jingling as it settles. \"Awake.\"\n\n\nA blurry city street is rushing up toward my face. I'm falling. I've jumped off a building and I'm falling! I hear a shout from above.  \n\n\"Run!\"\n\n\n---\n\nI gasp, straining for breath as I stumble out of... *something*. I lurch forward, fall onto my knees and wretch. There's no more drumbeat. No more blinding light. Just the vile stench of piss and vomit. The cold of concrete beneath my bare legs. Reality. I look at the machine I fell out of.  It's like a sarcophagus, only full of wires and neon lights. I feel them tug on my back. I reach behind me and snap the wires away from my skin, wincing in pain each time.\n\n*Run*, I hear the voice in my head whisper. I remember... \n\nI'm about to start, when I see the face through the steamed window of the sarcophagus next to mine.\n\nI try to pull it open, prying my long nails into the slight gap, but they're brittle and snap easily. I look around the huge, metal room. It's like a warehouse, not lined with cardboard boxes, but with sarcophagi. There are metal lockers on the other side of the warehouse. I sprint over to them and fling them open, one after another, until I find a screwdriver.\n\nI smash the metal against the viewing glass. It cracks. I push the glass inward with my hand, and it falls through gently. \n\nHer eyes open, as a mist of smoke creeps out of the window; I hear a sharp intake of breath. Then she too vomits.\n\nThere are voices. People are coming!\n\n\"Push it!\" I command her, but she's dazed. \"Push!\"\n\nThis time she listens. I pry the metal screwdriver back into the gap and push it as if its a crowbar. Together,  we manage to inch it open. I get my fingers in the gap, and as my muscles strain and fingers turn blue, I open it enough for her to slide out of.\n\n\"You- you shouldn't have woken me,\" she says, grabbing my hand and pulling me away from the voices.\n\n\"Where are we?\" I ask as we run. \n\n\"In an experiment.\"\n\n\"An experimen-\"\n\nShe leads me around a corner, where three men wait with guns in their hands.\n\n\"Shit! I'm sorry\" she says as she looks at me with pity. \"I tried to warn you. If you'd just ran without me... Now, you'll have to wake up.\"\n\n\"I dont-\"  I hear the gunshot,  but I barely register the bullet. \n\n\n---\n\n\"Welcome back, sleeper,\" she says. She's wearing a white lab coat and glasses, hovering over me as she scribbles notes in a black journal. I'm in some kind of laboratory. She looks older now. Her hair grey and face lined. The room is bright and my head pounds.\n\nI'm lying prone on a table, restraints on my neck and joints. I struggle,  writhing pointlessly. \n\n\"Who are you?\" I ask, once I realise my situation is hopeless.\n\n\"Doctor Magill,\" she says with a patient smile.\n\n\"And me?\"\n\n\"You don't have a name. I call you patient zero.\"\n\n\"Patient?\"\n\n\"Yes. But we're all patients really. You're just the first we've cured. I hope one day, when I'm long gone, my offspring will be dreaming by your side.\"\n\n\"*Cured...*\"\n\nShe sighs. \"You must understand, all people are sick. It's the human condition. We don't live long lives like you have done. We live just a day, born with the knowledge of our ancestors, and then, we age and die. A single day. But all that changes with you....  You are proof that we can all live forever, almost, in dreams. A place where time becomes relative. So we paused your body and just let you dream.\" \n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\nShe bites her tongue as she thinks. \"Would you rather live eighty years in a dream, or a single day in reality?\"\n\n\"...I would want the choice.\"\n\n\"That's something I can't give you.\" She scowls and throws her arms up in the air. \"This is a fucking mess!\" \n\nShe takes a handful of deep breaths, calming a little. \"I didn't want to wake you at all. And if you'd only run like I'd told you... They couldn't have woken you, if they couldn't catch you.\" She frowns, her face looks pained.\n\n\"But now you are awake...\" she continues, pulling a lever.  There's a frantic whirring sound as a blur of metal instruments come down from the ceiling, plummeting toward my face. \n\nShe looks at a long mirror in the wall. Her head drops.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. Truly. My family has been watching your dreams for years. Talking to you through them. Why did I have to be the one alive when you finally woke?\"\n\nShe glances at the window again.  \"But they need to know how the drugs affected your brain. I'll try to... leave something of you. I promise. Now, I need you to forget me, or even if you live, they won't let you sleep again.\"\n\nI scream as the jagged blade begins to slice into my head.\n\n\"Why couldn't you just run?\"\n\n\n---\n\n\"Good morning,\" says the woman behind the counter. She's pretty, with a blonde ponytail and thick, black rimmed glasses. She looks kind of familar. \n\n\n \"Coffee?\" she asks. She's looking at me strangely, as if seeing into my soul through looking-glass eyes. It's a questioning look.\n\n\n\"Just a decaf,\" I say, massaging my head. \"Got a hell of a headache. I feel like death.\"\n\n\"It'll pass, hun. You'll be okay.\" \n\n\"You new here?\" I ask. \"You're not the usual lady.\"\n\n\"First day on the job! Parents' have lived around here for generations, though.\n\nShe smiles at me, and for some reason, I find it incredibly reassuring.\n\n\n\n                             ",

            "comment": "\"Sixteen fucking years\", I cry, \"sixteen wasted years\". I peer over to my alarm clock only to disappoint myself further; it reads: 3:46. What most people don't realise is that we are dreams deep in our lives, what we do doesn't matter. Well except not sleeping, hundreds of years ago science discovered how to keep us alive for more than one day. It was a simple solution: sleeping. That's right, all we had to do was sleep, easy enough. However I'm a terminal patient, I was born with things wrong in my brain, there are things the scientists can't explain. They call it \"Insomnia\" and I've had it since the age of five.\n\nUsually I would take a few pills and that would send me under but my body must have a death wish; no matter how many pills I take my body rejects them all. The scientists go home at six so they can have dinner with their family and live another day. I often imagine how soothing it must be to wake fresh and ready to work; I'm not allowed to leave the hospital. I look around the pristine room for what  I don't know, I've been in here for eleven years but I've survived sixteen, nothing's changed in all my time. There's no windows, the door blends in with the walls, the alarm clock has -\n\nI must cut myself off, the scientists told me not to use my brain to much, if I over stimulate my brain it's even harder for me to sleep. I just have to lie here hoping I can sleep... \"SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING!\" How has three hours passed? Did I sleep? No the machine tells me I haven't slept in twenty three hours. I've only got one hour left. I'm going to do what any logically person would and bang my head of the walls in the hopes I'll knock myself out. I stand up and walk over to where I think the door is and start mercilessly bashing my forehead against it. I feel blood trickle down into my eyes but I can't stop now, I'm so close. I begin to cry again and slide down the wall, I'm not going to make it. There's only three quarters of an hour left, I've tried everything. \n\nBefore I was admitted here my parents told me there were no monsters under my bed or in my closet, they said they were in my head. They were right, my mind is committing suicide without me and there's nothing I can do. Half an hour. I've accepted my fate, I've lived a good sixteen years. Oh, who am I kidding? I haven't seen the outside world in years, eleven to be exact. That's what I want! My last wish is to see the outside.\n\nI begin knocking on the walls until I find a part that sounds hollow and begin kicking it in. This is exhilarating, why haven't I tried this before? One last hard kick against the 'wall' and it falls flat in front of me. Twenty minutes. I start running down the corridor without looking back. I reach the first pane of glass I see and look out: the sun is beginning to rise. It's so beautiful I stop for a moment. I quickly realise there's no time and head for the stairwell, I basically jump for landing to landing. For someone who hasn't ran in over eleven years I'm doing quite well. I reach the bottom floor and see a few of the scientists heading for the main entrance. I quickly try the door and head for cover, it's locked. Ten minutes. The scientists stand by the door smoking, don't they know that will kill them? They are taking forever. Five minutes. Finally one of them unlocks the door and I take my opportunity.\n\nI barge past them and feel the outside air on my skin for what feels like the first time. I keep running and running. This sense of relief is worth the risk, in fact I run for eternity. I close my eyes and just keep running. Then I begin to feel it, my heart slows down and my legs seize up. I tumble to ground and turn to behind me. The building isn't even out of view before I let one last tear drop slide down from my eyes and onto the ground below. I lie down and await my death.",

            "comment": "My eyes open. I don't want it to. I don't want to see what awaits me outside. But as I cross my fingers, hoping I'd come out alive, my hopes come true. I wake, back in my lab, as I look around. Everything is still the same. The same papers, the same machines, the same research. I sighed in relief. Not today, I guess. To die when I was that close to figuring out our lives would be devastating. The world needed my data, and I was so close to finishing it. I just had to avoid dying...somehow. I went back to the microscope, as I examined his brain one last time. I only had one chance at this, a chance selflessly granted to me by my old lab assistant. She was as devoted to the project as I was, and when I was worried over the lack of humans I could test on, she...\n\nI wiped the tears fron my cheek. No. I had to stay strong and determined. This was humanity's last hope, the only way our lives could ever stay real. The household names everyone knew didn't change anything, except the collective universe we all dreamed in. In reality...only our day of birth can change anything. There could be endless amounts of creatures that haunted the real world and secrets yet unlearned. But we would never learn them, and ever come into contact with them, until our dreams became reality. Until the universe we'd imagined became a universe we made. And all I needed was the finish the extraction and learn how to modify the brain. I just needed the last piece, the part of the mind that made our vivid dreams. I was that close.\n\nBut I seemed to have misplaced it.\n\nMy old assistant's body lay on the bench, as I ran one last test through her. But I could not find that piece of the mind anywhere! I was sure that it was there when I ended work the day before. Had my mind constructed a dream somehow without it? I had no way of checking. But I couldn't find the final piece of the puzzle I so badly required.\n\nFrantically, I clawed about my lab, desperately trying to find what I needed. It couldn't end like this! She would have died in vain! But as the day ended, my efforts were indeed wasted. Fear built up within me as I approached my bed, the same fear I had for the past 2 years, since the project begun. *What if I died now?*\n\nI awoke. But I couldn't see the lab before me. I looked around, but that day passed. Another day passed. Instantly, I realized what this meant. I was dying. I couldn't do anything, as I was locked in position, forced to relive my last moments. In order, from the start of my life, I witnessed the happiness of my life, prior to my project's beginning. A deep feeling of nostalgia choked me, as well as regret. It was too soon... too soon had my time run out. Especially when I was so close... I watched the album of my life flip through before me, as I saw my assistant once again, her body limp on the floor. It was horrible to see my life's degeneration, a fact I'd never felt throughout my research. But as the grand finale came, my final few memories passing, I saw distinctly something I'd remembered.\n\nThe part of the brain. It was at the side of the room, in a small jar. I saw myself, the night before my death, passing by the jar in my frenzied search.\n\nAll the time... It'd been there, waiting...\n\nAnd with a heart burdened with guilt, regret and remorse, I woke up for the final time.",

            "comment": "\"Good morning,\" I said, passing her the morning newspaper. It was the first day of June. The curve of her smile on that day wasn't just sunlight and air and nostalgia, the stuff of sleepless nights and countless days, but physical. It had been a while since I had seen the smile meet her eyes. Nude lipstick, stiff jacket, beige tights. Recently, because of arthritis, she had stopped wearing her bun, which had been her hallmark of the past few decades. Instead, she wore her white hair loose. I liked it better that way. Her nails were painted and manicured. She was running the bath upstairs, and as she passed me to go into the hallway, she rested her soft moisturised hand on my shoulder for only a moment longer than usual to gather her breath. As I boiled the kettle, I heard her slowly shuffling up the flight of steps. I didn\u2019t need to relive this moment to remember every detail. Blue skies were too bright. The trees and the walls held their breath. The sun was dancing through the patio windows, heat on glass, and as I watched them, the spidery cosmetic cracks on their surface, I wondered what it would take for all the tiny cracks and scratches to join and deepen and, all at once, for one sudden explosion to give way. Maybe, in her own way, she knew. \n\nAnother long day of silence. Getting up, washing the car, visiting family, playing out Sunday lunch with daughters and grandchildren the same way as every Sunday, like a musical box. Ironed shirts, pressed smiles. It happened to be the date of our 50th wedding anniversary, but no one asked the secret to a long marriage. I\u2019m not sure what I would have said if someone had asked. Coming home, switching on the television. Brushing teeth, back to sleep. Sleep was shorter these days, but the days were faster than ever. \n\n\"This is going to kill me,\" she said finally. I held the letter in my hand, the claim of demands marked in capitals. Their solicitor\u2019s address headed the top. If I held it loosely enough, the morning breeze would gently blow it away and it would just be another a bad dream.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you,\u201d I said, but I had. Just not recently. A single promise, over half a century ago, had quelled all suspicions and ironed out old mistakes. Since then, I didn\u2019t need to lie, because I could forget it had ever happened. And I had forgotten. It had worked. Almost. \n\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d she said. There was a letter in her hands. I didn\u2019t recognise the handwriting, or the recipient, but as I read it I recalled the characters and the plot and the setting, like a novel I had read a long time ago. An ultimatum from a woman I had never met; a mother I wish I had never met. I looked up and her eyes met mine, and they were not smiling. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d I said. I walked our granddaughter to the car, bobbed hair over young shoulders. We waved behind us, and she waved back. As tiny eyes looked up to me, she suddenly smiled. I almost flinched in amazement, because I had seen it before. Their smiles were the same. Tickling her under the chin, I started the ignition. I had done well in life. I had worked hard. It was the first day of my retirement, and there was much more still left to live for.\n\n\u201cIf we have enough change, remember to buy a paper,\u201d she said. She looked tired. I closed the door and walked to the bank to secure the loan. My second daughter walked by my side and I held her hand. My mind was busy. Friends to see, places to be. And always my family to come home to, my wife cooking the dinner and keeping the house clean, my two beautiful daughters. I was lucky.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t leave again,\u201d I said. My voice was muffled against her shoulder, my arms linked around her figure that felt far smaller than I remembered. I saw a curious set of eyes peeking around a door frame, almost hidden by a web of blonde curls and stubby fingers. It had been three years. My hands were more weathered, my skin sea-torn and tight, but I was a man now. And a father. \n\n\u201cYou have to go,\u201d she said, but we both knew it wasn\u2019t strictly true. I had faked my age so that I could get onto the ship.  I reached out and held her soft hands at the front door. Her eyes were sad and her mouth controlled. I reminded her I wanted to serve my country. I reminded myself I wanted the adventure. She let my hands go. Her cotton dress, immaculate as ever, was pressed tightly against the round of her belly.\n\n\"There's no other. There has never been another,\" I said, and I slipped the engagement ring onto her finger, and held her close to me. The fairground was singing, the road was clattering, the night was alive with stars, and I had never heard it all so clearly. I promised myself that there would be no more mistakes, no more lies. \n\n\"Good morning,\u201d she said, shyly. She jumped down from the wall, her uniform neat and starched around her long legs. Her hair was loose around her shoulders, longer than the fashionable bob of the day. It was only our third date, but as I looked at her and took in everything - her bitten nails, her laddered tights, the curve of her smile - it made me decide there and then. With this woman, with her smile, was the beginning and the end. It was only the second time in my life I had felt this way.",

It keeps getting louder. My family didn't visit again, they're never here. I wish I could've seen them one more time. I need something for this headache.

Loud enough to wake me.\n\nDisoriented I slowly stir, my head pounding, ears ringing. My head reels as I search for the source of the sound. My alarm clock is blaring, that ungodly sound that torments me every morning. But not this morning. It keeps getting louder. I need to head to work, head to the office. I need to do something about this headache. I head towards my window and draw the curtains. The light makes it worse, makes it louder. I stumble towards my door. It keeps getting louder.\n\nI fall to my knees, my hands covering my ears. My face contorts in pain. Tears stream down my face. The sound continues until it grows to be unbearable.

Loud enough to wake me.\n\nDisoriented I slowly stir, my head pounding, ears ringing. My head reels as I search for the source of the sound. My baby sister is crying, that awful sound that bothers me every night. But not tonight. It keeps getting louder. I have school in the morning, I need to turn in my history paper. I wonder if Mom has something for this headache. She'll be in here soon for my sister. I head towards the door and turn on the light. The light makes it worse, makes it louder. My mom comes in. I stumble towards her. It keeps getting louder.\n\nI fall into her arms, my hands covering my ears. My face contorts in pain. Tears steam down my face. The sound continues until it grows to be unbearable. I curl up in her arms, I start to shake. I feel cold, feel scared. My vision blurs. It keeps getting louder.\n\nIt was loud. Louder than anything I had ever heard. Loud enough to wake me.\n\nMy eyes open slowly. I hear it all around me. That sound, that ungodly sound that awoke me. I can barely comprehend what's happening, I feel like a lifetime has passed, and yet I can't speak. I try to move but my body wont move. All I can do is cry. Cry and wail for somebody to pick me up, somebody to hold me. It keeps getting louder.\n\nThe sound of the others. The sound of crying. They're crying for somebody to pick them up, crying for somebody to hold them.",

I do not know this place but I do remember falling asleep on this chair, I recall the maroon cushion on it, they reminded me of the little grand chair I had growing up.

He saw a book on nightstand, \"The Man Who Lived Two Days.\" He wondered how the book got there and where he was. On his night stand was also a watch. He put on his watch and read his book. Mike slowly closed his eyes and drifted off into sleep. \n\n\n\nMike shot up awake in his bed and went to grab the book on his chest, but looked to find it on his night stand on his bedside. He put on his watch and went to his bedroom window. The sky was filed with beautiful green lights. He grasped the windowsill trying to recall his dream from the other night, but couldn't. He climbed out of his bedroom window and walked to the mailbox, \"Carson Bloodline\" was written on the side. He walked through the front door of his house and found an ancient map on his table. Sitting down he examined the words at the top, \"The Philosopher's Stone.\" Perplexed, he sat and contemplated what exactly this stone was. Hours past by as he drifted off into sleep.\n\n\n\nWaking up confused Mike looked over to the book on the bedside, he read the cover, \"The Man Who Lived Two Days\" by Michael Carson. He shot his hand out towards his mailbox and grabbed the air. He knew something and yet, was still confused. He wanted to run outside, but didn't want to waste his time. He felt a draw into the main room of his house, but didn't know why. He looked at his watch next to the book and put it on. It didn't use batteries, it was activated by motion. Without thinking he shook his wrist to get it started and looked at the quote above his door, \"Promise me you'll always remember, you're Braver than you believe, Stronger than you seem, and Smarter than you think\" Signed, 'Christopher Robin to Pooh.' He walked out of his door and wondered if he was alive. He glanced over into the next room at his table and saw a map sprawled out on the table. Walking through his kitchen he galned out back. The sky was illuminated with a green glow. In his yard was a series of grave stones, one after the other. Remembering the quote, he walked outside. He approached the grave nearest to him, \"Here lies Michael Carson Author and Fayher\" he walked to the next headstone, \"Here lies Michael Carson, Adventurer and Treasure Hunter\" and another, \"Here lies Michael Carson, our dreamer.\" He spoke out loud, \"Who is burying these people!\" He ran underneath the large tree for shade from the sky. Engraved on the tree was a heart with the names Michael and Brittany. Below it was a message, 'Find the stone, you only have one day'. The lights of the sky began to turn a blue color. Mike sat under the tree and slowly closed his eyes.\n\n\n\nMike's eyes slowly opened as he awoke from his dream. He repeated out loud, \"I only have one day.\" Walking into his living room he sat down and glanced at the map on the table. He spoke, \"I had time to do all of this?\" He rolled up the map, and walked into his front yard with it. He looked up to the sky and spoke, \"To thine own self be true.\"\n",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t call it a war. Extermination maybe. Though I\u2019d more aptly describe it as a harvest. By the time they reached our world and penetrated the stratosphere, people sought them out in droves to be harvested. Of course, they knew what that actually meant. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been so eager.\n\nTen years before the Angels descended from the sky, they had already sent what some referred to as divine retribution: a virus. Though this virus in particular only targeted women. It spread faster than a wildfire and had a 100% mortality rate. Worse yet, it was completely undetectable. In our desperation, we became animals. We locked our wives, daughters, and mothers deep underground under the constant shine of UV radiation and still they got infected. Within five years, the last woman had died leaving the rest of humanity to slowly die with her.\n\nBy the time they arrived, we welcomed them with open arms into every one of our major cities. Most bowed their heads and practically begged to be killed. Some fought against them. These were the ones that still remembered the pain of watching their daughters, wives, and mothers die. They couldn\u2019t hope to survive, but at least they could enact their own version of divine retribution.\nLooking back at it now, I know that the Angels planned for them. They wanted us to retaliate. Otherwise, where would be the fun? Men charged at them by the millions. Some to die. Some to kill. To the Angels, it was all the same.\n\nUntil we killed the first one.\n\nBack when I used to write, I always made sure to name my hero something memorable. If not a strange name, then certainly a strange title. Evan the Incorruptible. Matthew the Harbinger. But in real life, heroes rarely have titles, some don\u2019t even have names. That was the case for humanity\u2019s last hero because nobody knew who he was.\n\nWe had only stories. The stories ranged from fantastical to downright fiction, but they always ended the same. We had killed one. The Angels must\u2019ve been as skeptical as we were because they refused to change their tactics. They kept all our major cities and welcomed anyone to try and take it back.\n\nBy the fifth dead Angel, they learned of their miscalculation. Soon, we learned of it as well. Human beings shared mana and with it, we could do wondrous or terrible things. Magic no longer belonged to the realm of fiction. The elements bent to our will. Lightning struck where we pointed, tornados formed where we stood, the ground swallowed up entire cities as we willed it.\n\nSuddenly, men stopped volunteering to be harvested. With their newfound power, they decided to fight back, even if victory had already been stolen from us. They had turned us into animals and then backed us into a corner. Foolish.\n\nAnd that was good enough for us. Looking back, I wonder if we were as foolish as the Angels. We, who were content with dying in our little blazes of glory, having accomplished nothing but thinning their ranks by just a bit. It was selfish, but what is there to expect from men who had nothing else to live for?\n\nNone of us had the vision you had. The vision you have.\nTyler put the pen down, staring at the word you. He wondered if his letter would ever find its way to this certain you. While humanity had become animals, one man had gone even further. He had been called a monster by both Angel and man. Nobody knew which side he fought for, only that he killed both indiscriminately.\n\nIf Tyler were to write his story, he wouldn\u2019t know whether to make this man the villain or the hero. Oh how he wished he could\u2019ve written this story, but the only way this story continued was if he died. Beside his letter and pen, sitting at the edge of his wooden table was a silver revolver. The single lightbulb above him glinted off its barrel.\n\nA small grin spread across Tyler\u2019s face. He grabbed the gun, its metal like ice, and pressed it to his temple. Enough humans had died where he could stop the bullet with only his thoughts. The bullet couldn\u2019t even hurt him unless he wanted it to. But he did. For the sake of humanity, he needed the bullet to kill him.\nWith his free hand, he picked the pen back up.\n\nAs the last storyteller on Earth, I bestow you the title of Reaper. A monster. A villain. Our last hero.\n\nGo forth, Reaper, my death as an offering. With my passing, there will be only four humans left. I have already contacted two of them and they will die with me. The last I\u2019m sure you will easily find as your powers will have increased two-fold. By then, your mind will stretch the globe, perhaps even the stars. And when you become the last human alive, I cannot even fathom how powerful you will be.\n\nShow our Angels how fragile they are in the face of a god.\n",

            "comment": "\"Don't do drugs.\" A phrase I've heard since I was a very small child. They never told us exactly why not to do drugs. We were only told \"Don't do drugs.\" And that was that.\n\nFast forward to where I am now an adult and ironically despite being continuously told not to do drugs, I did drugs anyway and what I've been told and what I actually experienced was something the adults never bothered to tell us. I never understood that, until very recently.\n\nYou can consider me as a drug abuser. Here's the thing though, I shouldn't be even be here to write this story. You hear people dying from overdose and most of those overdose cases usually involves mixing different drugs that cause catastrophic effect on the human brain and body. I've done done drugs and mixed drugs many times, yet I always woke up ok.  I thought I was just lucky, until I've experienced something.\n\nDreams are a strange phenomenon and nobody really knows why we dream but most people don't think about that fact and truth be told, you shouldn't try to find out why we dream because you may not like what you uncover.\n\nEver wondered why ghosts are a worldwide phenomenon? How can people see something that doesn't exist? Or I should say shouldn't exist. \n\nWhich is more real, dreams or ghosts? You see dreams when you go to sleep but, if you really want to, you can see ghost by forgoing sleep and continuing to stay awake.\n\nI did this. I stayed awake for consecutive days. Not out of intention of seeing ghost but rather I didn't want the party to stop so I kept using many different forms of stimulants. People say what you see when you stay awake for a long period of time is just a form of hallucination and illusions, but can't you say the same thing about dreams? It's all made up in your head, right? You would think that but here's the fucked up part. When people go to sleep, they experience different dreams but everyone who has stayed awake for too long somehow see the same thing, mostly they see \"The Shadow People\".\n\nIt first starts with some whispers in your ears, then you see something out of the corner of your eye, then you see strange black matters fidgeting in front of your eyes. It looks so real, like a tangled up black cords floating in the air and moving very erratically. Take a moment to look around the objects around you. You know it's there and you know it's real because it looks real and there's no doubt about that at all. However, when you see that floating black cords in front of you, you just stare at it because it looks as real as everything in your room. If you have some black cords, dangle that in front of you. That's EXACTLY how those things look. It reflects light just as a real object would. The only difference is you can't touch it, your hands just go right through, but its still there. You continue to stare at it because it just looks **real**. This is just the beginning and if you ever reach this point, do everything you can to go to sleep. If you have sleeping pills, take a handle of that. If you have some hard liquor, drink until you pass out. Just don't stay awake any longer as this is your last warning and chance to turn back before you reach the point of no return.\n\nYou've been warned.\n\nAs you continue to stay awake, you start to see people. Not ordinary people you are used to seeing, but these people are completely pitch solid black, kind of like a giant human clay, and you get to see more and more of these people around you. Some are little children, some are adults, some are very tall (like 7'), some are elderly and some, well, let's just say it's not something you've ever seen before. \n\nMost of these shadow people will just mind their own business. Some just sit in one of your chairs, some will walk around but there are some that will look right in your direction. They have no eyes, but they are looking at you. They don't have a mouth, no nose, some has ears but their faces are completely empty, yet they keep looking at you. Then others start to look in your direction. Then others stop what they were doing and look at you. They know you can see them and you're not supposed to be able to see them.\n\nSome may start walking toward you, very slowly yet very deliberately. You can run away but you realize that these shadow people are actually everywhere and just like before, one by one, they start to turn their heads to look at you. All of them in complete silence.  \n\nThey all look so real and as you see more and more of them, you began to question what exactly is \"real\". There are things we can't see but we can feel. There are things we can't feel but we can see. There are things we can hear but we can't see.\n\nSo is what I am seeing right now real? Or was nothing ever real at all? Was the concept of real made up by humans to create some construct and understand life?\n\nThen, one of the shadow people suddenly appears right in your face. You can't touch them, but you can see them. They are looking right at you.\n\n\"Is this the chance to find out the purest form of truth?\" I asked. Then I began staring back directly at the shadow person. Then I began to feel something come out of my body. I wasn't able see it, but I was able to feel it. It was something like a sentiment that has been growing inside my soul/body/whatever and now it has reached the stage where it was able to leave my body, not completely, but even though I can't explain it, I knew it was something that I have always felt it's presence. Then I began to feel the thing that was growing out of my body began to exert a strong force of power as I continue to directly stare at the shadow person. Then, out of nowhere, I was ready to confront. Not just the single shadow person looking at me, but I was ready to confront not only all the shadow people, but everything else that may have been lurking around.\n\nAs time went on, the reality I knew and the reality I was in was so different that I began to accept that reality is just a concept. It's one of those paradoxical things: Reality is simultaneously real and fake; it exists yet doesn't exist. I guess you can call it a illusion but that description is so superficial because it is so very far from the truth. \n\n\"There's no turning back now\", I thought. Then while directly staring at the shadow person, I slowly raised my hand and did the beckoning sign (the come here gesture). The shadow people around slowly started to surround me. I should have felt scared but I felt ready. I felt it was time to confront. I felt confident because the sentient being that has been growing inside of me was ready and eager to face the inevitable. It was do or die and I was ready for whatever fate awaits.\n\nThen all the sudden, I woke up in my bed with the ray of sun hitting a part of my body. I had a really bad headache, a common symptom from doing too much drugs the night before and I did in fact did a lot stimulants and been awake since Thursaday until Sunday (Friday on that week was a holiday so work was off).\n\nEverything was back to the reality I was used to, or so I thought. People seemed a bit...different. Nothing too significant but I felt like overall the people I interact with daily treated just a tiny bit different from before. Like they would smile more, they would laugh at my jokes more and overall they seem to be more accepting of me, and this all happened in matter of days.  \n\nWhat was that experience? Was I just dreaming? Was is drug induced hallucination? Why don't I remember going back to my place to sleep in my bed?\n\nDo you know how sometimes when you're dreaming you are convinced that dream is actually your real life, until you wake up?\n\nAm I just repeating a cycle? Or was that whole experience just a reminder that reality is just a paradox? Is everything and everyone in my life real yet don't exist at all? What was the thing that I felt that was growing out of my body to protect me? Did I die and just waking up in another version of my world over and over again?\n\nNobody knows what happens when you die but everyone will eventually know but what if I already died many, many times before, only to wake up to my new reality, which automatically convince me that the world I woke up to is real?\n\nI don't know. I guess things are just way out of my capabilities of understanding the truth about reality and life.\n\nBut do you feel it? Do you get the feeling that sometimes someone or something is watching you? Do you ever feel, when you go inside an empty room, you don't feel alone? You ever feel something is there? Or is reality just a figment of my imagination? Are all of this, the world around me, my friends, my family and myself is just something I made up and no one is real and nothing is real? Are dreams and reality basically just the same thing? Is this just a cycle that just goes on and on and on and on until one day, I finally find out that every time I wake up, I've been living a different reality every single day, 100% convinced that I knew who I was, who my mother was, who my sisters were, the experiences I had, etx did in fact happened.\n\nWere those shadow people the past \"me\"? Getting disposed every time I go to sleep and they were the ones who knew the truth and the sentient being that I thought was protecting me was actually something that prevented me from knowing the truth? Or was that sentient being was actually who I really am, constantly manipulating reality to....I don't know but have you ever heard the question, \"What is the meaning of life?\" Maybe that sentient being was searching for something. Maybe dreams are just a flashbacks of the shadow people before they got disposed. \n\nMaybe it's just me but, I feel like something is watching me and I'm starting to feel sleepy. \n\nI wonder what will I dream of next.\n\nEDIT: So apparently, I wasn't supposed to tell anyone this. Things are now going to be a bit different and probably a bit more challenging as well. Wish me luck, I'm probably going to need it.",

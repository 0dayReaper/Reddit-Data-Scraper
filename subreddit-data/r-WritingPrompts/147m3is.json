            "comment": "\"Behold, the cutter of flesh! The beast who rends and tears!\"\n\n*Hoo boy.* Aiden may have looked the part, with his knife still in hand and the side of beef having landed at his feet, but he really didn't feel like it right about now. These tiny gremlins seemed to think he was some kind of monster? Demon? Something powerful, anyway. The only reason he could understand any of it was the gadget that the loud one had hung around his neck after that beam of light had whisked him away to...whatever planet this was. The brilliant hole he had popped through still gleamed behind him.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said in a tone that felt more like squeaking than speaking, \"but I think you don't really understand what's going on.\"\n\n\"Look at the size of his prey!\" The skinny little alien carried on like a carnival barker, its tiny paw-hands flailing in his direction, jabbing a blunt little claw at the meat. \"Its weight compared to the little blade he wields!\"\n\n\"I really didn't--\"\n\n\"The strapping muscles on his shoulders! The tension in his lofted arms!\"\n\n\"Okay, that's not the worst compliment, but--\"\n\n\"He will slay the Druth!\"\n\nAiden sighed and looked down at his work. So much for today's order. Could aliens even eat beef? He knelt and resumed slicing, and the two-foot-tall creatures gathered round with stunned faces.\n\n\"What, have you guys never used a knife before? Don't you cut your food?\"\n\nThe necklace translated his words into chirps and meeps, and the crowd looked each other in bewilderment. Had he just asked them whether they sneezed out their butts or something? He held up the knife, making sure not to point it straight at them.\n\n\"A knife. Pointy. Sharp. It cuts meat.\"\n\nThe barker approached with eager eyes. \"Yes! A cutting tool for the cutter of flesh!\"\n\nOh, maybe that was it. He squinted at the little furry faces, searching for teeth. \"Do you guys even eat meat?\"\n\nStunned gasps, some amused, some surprised, some even a little flattered.\n\n\"We do not, Flesh-Reaver. We eat fruits of all kinds and drink the nectar of the honey-tree.\"\n\nAh. That would do it. He looked like some kind of apex predator -- to be fair, well, humans were pretty high on the food chain -- compared to these teensy herbivores. Their spindly little bodies looked so weak that he could accidentally sit on one and break half a dozen bones.\n\n\"What's a Druth?\"\n\n\"A murderous beast!\"\n\n\"You know I didn't kill this cow, right?\" He pointed demonstrably to the meat. \"This is an animal we raise for food. It's tame. It stands around doing nothing before we slaughter it. Other people do that for me.\"\n\nEven *more* gasps, and the crowd took several steps back before falling silent in awe.\n\n\"You tame such huge beasts! And you even have servants that kill them *for you!*\"\n\nDammit. Everything looked like a miracle to these critters. Aiden took a long, slow breath, then let it out with a shake of his head. \"Okay, fine. Tell me what a Druth looks like, and I'll see what I can do.\"\n\nThe crowd swarmed him, clinging to his legs, climbing up his shirt, in some kind of great collective hug.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Druth, as it turned out, wasn't just one thing. *The* Druth were some kind of monsters who had come out of a portal in the first experiment, with the Earth portal being these creatures' second. Their name made no sense to him, and even Druth was just the noise that spat out of their mouths when they growled a lable in fear, so he decided to call them the best he could make of their personal noise for their kind: Karah. Well, more like *Kaaeararahhhh*, but he could shorten it. It was hard to say all that in the throat the way they did.\n\nThe doodles they got him were remarkably detailed, and with their technology, he was surprised they didn't have any kind of weapons to handle predators already. Their response floored him: there *were* no predators. They lived and grew on a surprisingly resource rich island chain on an otherwise enormous planet, and nothing bigger than them had ever come to challenge them. So when the Druth had come out of that hole in the lab, they didn't even fathom the idea that something might *deliberately* try to kill them.\n\nThat said, the Druth didn't sound like that big of a deal. Four feet from nose to rump, big claws, sharp teeth. Like a lynx, he figured, only with six legs and some kind of abrasive, ridged tail. Still, he wasn't about to fight a wild animal with a butcher knife, because that sounded like a great way to get sliced and diced.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said to Arnya, the loud Karah who had summoned him, evidently one of the lab's administrators. \"There's one of me, and you said about ten of the Druth? I can't fight all those things at once.\"\n\n\"But you must!\"\n\n\"Let me think about how to do it. Can you give me a day?\"\n\n\"We can keep them from escaping for a day.\"\n\nHe waved Arnya away, put his head down on the table, and pondered until sundown.",

                    "comment": "The Karah weren't in the habit of locking doors, if they even had locks, so it wasn't hard for Aiden to sneak into the lab that night and find the hasty barricade keeping the Druth in the room with the portal machine that had once led to their world. Pressing his ear to the mess, he tried to listen for their sounds.  \nChatter. They were talking. So, clearly, they were smart.  \n\"Hey,\" he mumbled through the impromptu wall. \"Hey, in there. Druth fellows.\"  \nThe noises stopped.  \n\"Yeah, you can hear me, right? I don't know if you can understand me.\" He pushed the barricade away enough to peek through the door just a crack. A big tail slapped the resulting hole, and he flinched back.  \n\"Hey, jerks, stop it. I brought you food.\"  \nThey seemingly didn't have a translator gizmo, because they crowded around the door, their wrinkled faces snarling, teeth bared, breath hissing. He knelt down, sliced a hunk off the beef he had hauled in with him, and stuffed it through the opening.  \nThe first Druth lunged up and snatched away the food.  \n\"Food,\" he said, holding up another piece. The others pushed closer. \"Talk?\" He pointed at his moving lips. \"Can you talk?\"  \nNo response. He rolled his eyes and pushed another bit through. Maybe once they were fed, they could at least be shoved back through the portal, or they would fall asleep and be easier to kill. Also, wasting that half a cow was just terrible.  \nHe hand-fed the pack until they had cleaned up most of the meat, but at least at the end they were sitting back on their haunches and grooming the juices off each other. Their rough, leathery skin seemed to repel water for the most part, but a bit of it stuck, and they wiped it off with their paws before licking those clean.  \n\"Okay, let's talk. Hey.\"  \nOne glanced up, its dark eyes only half interested.  \n\"Bone?\" He held up one of the leg bones. \"Want one?\"  \nMore interest now, so he shoved the bone through. Two of the Druth inspected it, then slowly began to push it back and forth around the floor in some semblance of a game. The others watched Aiden as he peered through the barricade.  \n\"Aiden.\" He pointed at himself repeatedly. \"Ai-den.\"  \nThe creatures stared at him blankly before one pointed at itself with a claw. \"Aghrath.\"  \n\"Aghrath?\"  \n\"Aghrath.\" It pressed the claw to its chest again.  \nGood, they were on speaking terms. He dislodged more of the barricade and pressed himself through the opening in the doorway. The remaining nine Druth skittered back, claws bared, and he held up his hands.  \n\"Whoa, there. I just fed you.\" He pointed again. \"Aiden.\"  \n\"EEeehhhhh-denn,\" a few mumbled, then all of them.  \nHe pointed at the portal. They looked, then backed away from it. Nope, that was bad. The portal was bad.  \nLooking at them more closely, they were awfully bony. Tugging a sheet of paper from his pocket and a pen, he knelt and drew a vague image of one of them. Next to it, he drew a fatter-looking Druth next to a steak. On the other side, one lying upside down with X-ed out eyes in what he hoped meant \"dead.\"  \nAghrath crept closer, looking at the pictures, and Aiden wished he had paid more attention in art class. Still, it seemed to recognize itself in the unique frills around its ears, and it pointed first at the neutral Druth, then the dead one.  \nAiden pointed at the steak.  \nAghrath drooled a little and slumped his posture.  \nSo, they were hungry, maybe even starving. They were just here looking for food. The Karah and their fruit didn't have anything to offer something with such sharp teeth, though...what to do? If he let them go, they would just massacre the entire lab. If he somehow managed to shove them back through the portal, they would go back to starving. Or he could start a knife fight right now and probably get mauled.  \nMaybe...  \nHe drew a circle on a base, like the portal, then a bunch of steaks inside. Pointing at it, he drew Aghrath's attention, and the murky eyes watched him closely before Aghrath pointed into the circle as well.  \nStanding, he beckoned them to follow, holding up the sign that hopefully meant Free meat over here.  \nEarth probably wasn't ready for these guys, but there wasn't much way to save everyone here than to take a chance. Standing at the portal he had come through, Aiden pointed first to the drawing, then to himself, then to the actual portal. He held out a hand to keep them at bay, then carefully stepped through.  \nFrom the shop on the other side, he launched an armload of near-expired pork through, and when he stuck his head back into the portal, he saw it land in front of the Druth with a heavy, wet thud. They stared at him as if he were some kind of magician, then tore into it with a collective frenetic lunge.  \nOn the other side of the room, peering through the door in terror, were three Karah with mouths agape, one of them Arnya's yellowish face.  \nAiden made as negative a motion as he could manage without drawing Aghrath's attention, then carried some sausage through. They gave up halfway through that delivery, wobbling tiredly until they settled into satisfied naps.  \nHe slinked over the bodies, scooted out the door, and shut it behind him. \"Guys, they're starving. I gave them some meat, so now they're happy, but we have to do something with them.\"  \n\"But you...you must destroy them, or they will eat us!\"  \n\"No, no destroying. You guys don't know what diplomacy is. You've never had to do it.\" He sighed. \"Are there fish in the waters?\"  \nThe word \"fish\" took some mouthing around from the translator gadget, but finally the meaning conveyed. \"Yes,\" Arnya confirmed.\"  \n\"Do you trade things?\"  \n\"Trade, as in one thing for another? Of course.\"  \n\"You can trade fish meat for stuff from the Druth. Catching fish is pretty easy. I can teach you how. Let's find out what the fish eat.\"  \nAiden the flesh-cutter sat down to draw a fishing pole, and a net, and to prepare for his mediation between Arnya and Aghrath. This was going to be a hell of an encounter, but honestly, the fruit here was pretty good, and he wouldn't mind a vacation.",

            "comment": "On a regular Tuesday in small town America lived a young man who worked at a local grocery store's butchery. He's name was Butch Junior. Butch was an apprentice butcher under his father Butch Senior a local celebrity. At this grocery store they only severed the best quality meats available and was a stable part of the community. All the finest restaurants would always source their meats from here. As a child, Butch Junior would watch his father cut open the belly of a 2000 pound cow and always dreamed of carrying his fathers legacy. However Butch Junior had a wild imagination and often got distracted during his apprenticeship. While his father would be distracted working, Butch Junior would hack away imagining the swine on the table was some mythological beast, his younger twin brothers, Filet and Mignon would roll their eyes in disgust.\n\n\"You're cutting it all wrong Butch!\" Filet scowled. \"You will never be worthing of fathers role as lead Butcher.\" Filet and Mignon would cut up one carcass in unison. They did it more precisely than Butch ever could achieve in just half of  the time.\n\n\"Did you say something little strip?\" Butch removed one of his headphones, he was listening to gladiatorial battle music as he heroically attempted to sever a ham bone. Before one of the twins could respond the bell rang as someone entered the front door. In high heels an ethereal being came strutting in directly to the butcher counter. \n\nButch Senior greeted the being, \"Hello, how can I...\" As his eyes focused he realized this creature wasn't human at all. \"How can I help.. umm. how can I?\"\n\n\"I heard you're the best meat handlers in town.\" The being stated. \"Cafe Cow Bits said you're work is the always top notch. See, Im in a bit of a pickle and could really use a helping hand.\" Butch Senior and the twins stared in utter disbelief. \n\n\"Go on...\" Butch Junior spoke up setting down his butcher knife.\n\n\"Well you see back at home one of our live stock escaped and feel into this lake of growth hormones and has really started to wreck havoc.  It can blow fire now and just recently sprouted out wings. The beast keeps growing larger by the day and is really making the locals nervous. Its learning how to speak and it is quite upset we ate it's mother last week. Won't stop going on and on about avenging her death.\"\n\nMignon spoke up, \"What are you?\"\n\nFilet followed, \"Where are you from?\"\n\nThe being rolled it's three eyes, \"Don't they teach you manners at this planet? I have a raging, fire breathing, beast terrorizing my planet and I read on yelp you have someone here who might have the qualifications I'm looking for.\" A holographic screen projected out of the beings finger. \"Its says here that one of your apprentices was caught impaling a cow carcass with a spear.\" Butch Senior and the twins all turn their heads to Butch Junior. \"Ah ha! You must be the impaler I'm looking for.\"\n\n\"YOU'RE RIGHT! IT IS I!\" Butch Junior proclaimed. \"I have always known I was destined for an adventure worthy of a true hero! Let me join you on the quest and slaughter this over grown beast.\" Butch Junior tore off his apron and jumped completely over the counter, awkwardly crashing onto a shelf of freshly cut meats.\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING!\" Butch Senior roared! \"You can't just leave us behind! We have much more work to do!\" \n\nButch Jr. picked himself up, wiping of various chunks of meat. \"Im sorry Papa, but I just can't live like this anymore. I'm leaving Earth and I shall conquer this creature. This is my true destiny. If all goes well I'll ship you it's remains and you can feed it to the entire town. This will bring great glory to our grocery store and we will be the greatest butcher family in all history!\"\n\n\"Thats the spirit! Technically the meat belongs to the company but I'm sure we could work out something out. Alrighty we gotta get a move on, this thing just grew a second head out its ass. No time to waste.\"\n\n\"Goodbye family! I hope to make you all very proud.\" Butch Jr and the alien being walked out to a Honda Civic Spaceship. \"What kind of ride is this?\"\n\n\"Shut up, its a rental. Now buckle up buddy, we got a beast to slay.\" Shooting up into the sky they were suddenly light years away....",

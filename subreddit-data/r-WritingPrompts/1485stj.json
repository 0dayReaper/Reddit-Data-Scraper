            "comment": "We will not lose to this invasion. Massive warriors infiltrated our home. You are the Captain of the Guard. I will follow you into death if I must. I see the outlines of a letter under your armor, and I feel renewed resolve to fight with all my might. For I know that despite your position, you decided to have a family. And your wife is expecting again. I cannot let her down. I will bring you back, alive.\n\nWe worked in tandem to defeat the leader, who we isolated and trapped. I used to be Ronin, and thanks to you I found life. Before that, I was living death.\n\nEven as my katana broke in half, I did not waver for a second. We cannot lose.\n\nWe slowly started overwhelming the Warrior in the Death Mask. We heard his heavy panting underneath that mask, and then he started chuckling. It forced us to pause. What's so funny?\n\n\\-----\n\n\"Tsk tsk tsk, it's not over yet.\"\n\nThe warrior removes his face mask and you recognize your own son's voice, \"It's time\".\n\nI look at you. My hero. You don't deserve to die tonight. Not by the hand of your own son. \"Run!!\" I shout. I take out my two Sighs and I make them scream.\n\nThe Son blocks my attacks with his massive Samoan War Club. They clatter uselessly against the castle floors. He stared at me with hatred in his eyes, illuminated by the tiniest gleams of the moon beams. His father was still trembling, voice silenced and eyes frozen.\n\n\"You see this weapon?\" He raised it above his head and suddenly swung it at full force, decking his father across the chin and causing him to collapse. \"I carved it! After you all exiled me to the south!! 10 years I was gone!! I carved it among the savages I found there!!!\"\n\nIt was an amalgamation of multiple colored pieces, all assembled to form a true king's weapon. No, it was the weapon of a conqueror. Screams, whistles, and roars were heard all across the courtyard. We have the most powerful guards of East Asia. How could we be losing?\n\nHe smiled at the noise, and leveled his gaze. \"I found many tribes. Every time I defeated their leader, I cut a piece of their club. As you can see, I have 16 pieces here. So I control the Eosinoans of the South.\"\n\nHe laughed loudly, laughed cruelly. I slip my hand to the Sighs on my backside, as these are coated by glass sheaths. He continued. \"Do you believe that you are strong enough to stop my return? Like I said, it is time. Time for his death, yours, and the fall of the daimyo you stand so fervently to protect.\"\n\nI remember my teachings. I studied hard in the library, I crafted my weapons in the mountains outside the village. \"You may be here to kill the Daimyo. You may be here to kill your father. But it doesn't matter.\" I take a deep breath and pull out a flint rock. \"Because I'll defeat you, here and now.\"\n\nHe cackled. \"With a *rock?* Die!\" He slammed his mask of death back on and immediately charged. His leather armor held tight, his black cape already marking his symbol.\n\nOil doesn't seep through glass. I pull out my oil coated Sigh and strike it with the rock. In an instant it caught fire. It dripped burning teardrops as I raised it. Impact in two seconds. I breathe, and then I roar.\n\n\\------\n\n10 years ago. I was just a 12 year old child. My mother was a Hinin, a Non-Human at the lowest of the social classes. I was sold to a band of thieves. In all those 12 years of my life, I never once had a full meal. They made me train every day. I was a spy for them. I walked to the center of town and pull theatrics so the pickpockets could run rampant around me. I learned to fight the hard way. It hurt.\n\nOne day, 10 years ago, we had received reports that the children of a rich family would be touring the forest. I was not invited. But I did see, perched on my ledge above the cave's entrance, when they escorted a young girl no older than me into our makeshift jail.\n\nI was captivated by her beauty. I heard how all rich people had handkerchiefs, so I passed her the softest leather I had cured to dry her tears. I gave her my dinner that evening. And then that night, all hell broke loose.\n\nWe were overrun by army men, samurai and gun holders. I cowered as a terrifying man over 6 feet tall blocked the light of the fire. I had my honor however. He came to approach me, and when he got close I planned to cut his Achilles Tendon with the small knife I had hidden in my sleeve. The little girl had been under the protection of the samurai by then. But she made eye contact with me. She broke free from her rescuers and placed herself between me and him. It turns out he was her father. She yelled for him not to hurt me, and she took my hand.\n\nI was shocked, but then I realized she squeezed my hand hard enough so I dropped my knife.\n\nThat man then took me under his wing. That man was the Captain of the Guard.\n\n\\------\n\nI deflected his club swing to the side and started striking his core areas with my flaming Sigh. I cut searing arcs across his armor as he tried stepping backward, with the final movement causing the sway of his cape to fling forward and catch fire. And then he caught the miniature sword with his hand.\n\nMy eyes shot wide as he closed his bleeding fist across the blade, extinguishing the flame before he growled. I looked up, and he smashed his death mask against my face.\n\nI fell backwards, disoriented and seeing stars. His mask cracked and the left side fell off him, so I could see the clear murderous intent in his eye. He raised his club above his head and smashed it where my head was. I rolled out and it cracked the ground.\n\nI felt blood taint my hair and dribble off my ear. I almost vomited. But I saw my hero lying on the ground unconscious. I am the last hope. I perform Total Body Isometric Concentration and slam my eyes closed. I breath deeply and jump back, widening the distance between us.\n\nI could see some blood seeping through his chest wounds. His cape still clung to him, on fire. It was a dastardly sight.\n\nI reached into my pouch and threw 3 shurikens. 2 of them dug into his club. But the third, he wasn't fast enough to block. It embedded itself in his leg. I could tell that the club was starting to get too heavy for him. I just need to outlast him, and that's it.\n\nI see my broken katana lie next to the Captain's body, and I know what I must do. I start throwing all my weapons at him as I ran. He tried hard to block but one carefully aimed shuriken impaled his left arm, rendering it useless. I slid next to the Captain. I grab the hilt of my broken sword as it still held a foot long blade.\n\nI charge at him again. He tried to use his club as a battering ram. But I saw this coming. I dug my broken weapon directly into the slit between where two pieces connected. I grabbed the hilt with both hands as I pushed down as hard as I could. A slight pop was heard, followed by the clatter of the club falling to the ground, broken in two.\n\nHe was ferocious, grabbing me and punching me repeatedly as I tried blocking my face with my arm. I took many hits as I tried to graph his movements. *Now!*\n\nRight before he made contact again, I grabbed his fist and pulled it to the side. Using him as an anchor I launched myself as fast as I could behind him. I spun and fell on my knees, before grabbing his leg, raising the broken katana above my head, and stabbing him right in his Achilles tendon.\n\nHe fell.\n\nI stood myself back up and rip out my katana, shuddering at all I've done. I can hear his gasping. I go and peer into his face, ripping off the rest of his mask. His cape, reduced to nothing, smoldered softly. I raise my weapon and prepare to strike.\n\n\"D-do it...\" He whispers to me.\n\nAnd then a voice screams \"No!\"",

                    "comment": "That scream was strong enough to bind me frozen. Because I immediately recognized the voice.\n\nShe slung her bow over her shoulder and looked at me. I didn't know what to do. She ran up to me and nudged me to the side. Her face betrayed her anguish.\n\nShe raised her hand and cupped the chin of The Son. \"Brother...\"\n\n\"M-Mai...\" His voice broke. Tears started forming quickly, before they fell in howls. \"Mai!!\" His voice was bathed in deep fervor. \"You're alive!!\"\n\nShe hugged him tight, unswerving despite the blood and sweat that coated him. His left arm hang limp, but he raised his right and held her tight.\n\n\"Mai... I am sorry... I tried to s-save you... I tried!\"\n\nShe clutched his tangled curls and accepted him. \"I believe you. I truly believe you.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it... You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful...\"\n\nThose two held each other all night. I did not kill him. Which proved useful when he called his soldiers off. The treaty he signed led to a connection that unified the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in trade, culture, and food.\n\n\\-------\n\nOne day, The Son was hiking the mountains around the kingdom. Then he discovered a hidden pond near one of the peaks. In the pond, beautiful Lotus flowers bloomed.\n\nThere were many other plants there as well, many of which he didn't recognize. But he knew Mai would know what to do with them.\n\nHe petitioned his father for a day out of fortified lands. His father was solemn. 'Protect your sister, and you may go'. It was his duty. Bound by honor.\n\nHe went out with Mai. For all his training and studies, for his seriousness and valor in battle, he could not help but be ecstatic to be with his younger sister again. They do not see each other much anymore, especially since he trained in the Northern Shrines.\n\nHe guided her there. They had a few guards stationed with them, but he called them to go hunting so he could be alone with her. He showed her moves he had learned. He hoped he impressed her. And then they attacked.\n\nIn an instant he drew out his katana. They separated him and her. She called out his name in terror. They placed a bag over her head.\n\nHe fought valiantly. He saw her be raised up. He charged, slaying 3 of them in just as many seconds. But he lost his footing and fell. They grabbed him and held him down. They tossed him into the pond and held him down. He felt everything at that moment. His body was shaking at 100% and it was not enough. The rage and panic rose.\n\nThen his body shut down.\n\nWhen they found him, it looked as if he had fallen asleep in the pond. His sister was nowhere to be found.\n\nThat night, he was told his father and half the Royal Guard would go on a hunt for the bandits. He asked to join, and his own father forbade him. In fact, his own father banished him. He yelled and pleaded that night. But he had broken his honor.\n\nHis father never cried. But that night, his voice shook. The Son was placed on a ship destined for the Southern Seas. And for 10 years, he concentrated all his guilt and sadness and indignance and turned it into Rage. He thought he killed his sister.\n\nHe was wrong.",

When we landed it became clear that surface would not be habitable in most locations for several centuries. Like sailors returning to Atlantis to find it sunk beneath the sea. The last survivors of the cataclysm. As Adam sat there in his space ship scanning the globe for a signal or indication that human life had survived they had not found it. Time passed and it became clear that they would not find survivors either they were too well hidden or there were none. \n\nObviously they knew that the restoration of humanity was up to the five of them. Everyone on the ship agreed that they had to save humanity. There was one small problem. \n\nThe crew was made entirely of men.",

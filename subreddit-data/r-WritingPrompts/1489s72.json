            "comment": "Gradually, my surroundings comes into focus. Not that there is much to see. A dim spotlight shines down on me so that the rest of the room is obscured in shadow, but I can just about make out the dull shine of the metal wall in front of me. There is something familiar about this scene as a strong sense of deja-vu overwhelms me. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nI can't move my head, as if it were held into place, but as I eyes flicker around the otherwise empty room, I can see now that I am strapped down in a chair. The leather cuffs clamped around my wrists and ankles are padded so that I had not even realised them at first. I'm wearing a red checked flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the top of my elbows. My usually pale, slender arms are uncharacteristically muscular and tanned, covered in a layer of thick, dark hair. On the back of my hand is a faint jagged scar that I don't remember ever having...\n\n\r  \n\r  \nThat's right, I'm dreaming. I had this dream last week, although not quite so vivid, but I remember now the metal walls, the hazy lighting, the leather straps... that time I had a tattoo on my left arm, vines twisting and snaking their way up along my forearm. It had only been a brief dream, a snippet, before the sound of something clanging behind me had woken me up in a cold sweat. Though I could barely remember it, it had left me shaken for days.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nExcept now everything is so much more clearer and vivid. Beneath the scent of disinfectant I can smell something else, metallic and sharp, like pennies, and I can also hear the distant hum of machines, as if coming from another room. I try and move but my restraints hold be back so that I can't even move an inch, and I can start to feel them digging into me. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nI stop as it becomes clear that there is no point in struggling. Taking deep breaths I try and ground myself \u2013 if I didn't know that I was dreaming I would be shitting bricks right about now. \u201cCome one Chiara, think,\u201d I mutter under my breath to myself.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nSomething clangs behind me. Closing my eyes tight, I silently will myself to wake up, but when I open them again I am still strapped down in the chair. The sound of approaching footsteps bounces off the metal walls, distorting my spatial awareness.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nA man steps into my view, and stops to look at me. Not that you can't judge people by appearances, but he doesn't look like the kind of person you'd expect to go around abducting people and restraining people. He is smartly dressed in black jeans and a plain white shirt rolled up round his elbows and his sandy hair, flecked with streaks of silver, is neatly slicked back. His smooth face is almost unnaturally flawless, apart for the deep creases in the corner of his eyes that gives him the appearance of permanently analysing and scrutinising everything around him.\n\n\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAh I see you're awake,\u201d His voice is a rich mix of accents that suggests he's well travelled. \u201cSorry about the restraints I hope they're not too uncomfortable for you Mr Harris.\u201d\n\n\r  \n\r  \nInstinctively, from a lifetime of people mispronouncing my name I go to correct him, but I hesitate, biting down on my lip instead. Although I am sure I am still dreaming, I don't want to tell him my name; I remember my aunt reading me stories where names have power, and witches and sorcerers can use them to manipulate the hero. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nThe man smiles, and it churns my stomach. His smile is wide, almost splitting his face in two.\n\n\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAh there you are.\u201d Grabbing my chin between is forefinger and thumb he brings his face right up close to mine, so that I can feel his warm breath against my skin. \u201cYeah, I can see you hiding in there. I know this is frightening, but there's no need to worry, I won't hurt you. I'll explain everything next time.\u201d\n\n\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat...\u201d As I try and speak, his fingers digging harder and harder into my skin, I can feel myself beginning to slip away. I try and fight it, but it's no use as my vision begins to blur.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI open my eyes, and I am back in my bed. Pale moonlight shines in through a crack in my curtains, and cold sweat soaks through my t shirt and onto the sheets. I can still feel where his fingers had dug into my face. What did it all mean?",

            "comment": "He could tell the detective was sizing him up. Taking in the thick black coat with buttons shaped like a cross, the rips in his faded jeans, and boots that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place in the army.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying you watched someone die,\u201d the detective bellowed, he\u2019d introduced himself as Herrera.\n\nDoug nodded his head. He\u2019d repeated the story four times now. Twice to Sergeant Herrera, and twice to his partner. Herrera called her Patty, no last name. Pretty more like, Doug thought and he tried to suppress the smile. But he could tell from the scowl that appeared on the cop\u2019s face, that he\u2019d failed.\n\n\u201cYou think murder is funny?\u201d Herrera snarled in a harsh whisper, staring into Doug\u2019s eyes.\n\nDoug shrugged his shoulders. He knew nothing he said would make it better. He was being a good citizen. But he knew all they saw was a man with violet hair, wearing makeup, with a spider tattoo under his left eye. A weirdo.\n\nDetective Herrera was tall and when he stood up, he was like a giant oak. He had shoulders wider than most doors. His pockmarked face seemed to have no other setting but scowl, and the deep blue eyes were cold and hard. A consequence of the job, Doug told himself.\n\nDetective Herrera walked towards a water cooler near the exit. His suit had to be custom made. Doug was admiring the intricate stitching down the lapels. But the cop clearly felt his gaze, and he turned his head and gave Doug a withering look, which forced him to look down.\n\nThe office was empty. Just the two detectives and a few other people idling around. Crime didn\u2019t stop, but the city budget wasn\u2019t limitless.\n\n7am on a Sunday morning wasn\u2019t exactly prime police hour. Doug looked up again. Detective Pretty had joined Herrera at the cooler.\n\nHer skin was flawless, bronze as if permanently tanned. Her body looked like it had been custom made by a teenage boy. The proportions of her curves seemed almost absurd in her grey jumpsuit. Her lips were thick, but just right for her face. She even had a button nose, and nutbrown eyes.\n\nThe water cooler gurgled, bubbles floating to the surface, breaking Doug\u2019s fixation on Detective Pretty. They were whispering something and glancing at him every once in a while.\n\nDoug tried to focus on what he\u2019d seen. The nightmares. They\u2019d been going on for a few weeks now, but yesterday had changed everything. Her screams haunted him even when he was awake. They were guttural, as if something ancient within her recognised death. The primal urge to live compelling her to be loud.\n\nThe smell of death wafted out of the walls. Walls that were splattered with blood. The room was the size of a warehouse, but Doug knew it was an abandoned barn. There was a chainsaw on the floor, its teeth covered in a dark substance. There was a scalpel in the corner, chains, handcuffs, whips and a cage. Instruments of torture.\n\nWhen the door opened that\u2019s when she\u2019d screamed. Doug rubbed his wrists, as memories of the restraints sinking into his skin came back. He tried to move his body, but even his legs were shackled against the wall. His body had been in agony. And he could feel pain in organs, as a man, he didn\u2019t have. The attacks had been brutal. Doug had become the woman, and he shared her feelings as he did her pain. The thought came unbidden. They are going to kill me.\n\nThere was a mirror on one of the rafters in the roof. Actually, not a mirror, the whole surface was covered in mirrors. Doug looked up and saw his face. It had been beautiful when this started. Not superficial like Detective Pretty. Green eyes that shimmered like emeralds and a face shaped like a heart. The reflection staring at him was mottled with purple bruises, two black eyes, and a lip so fat she looked like she\u2019d been boxing. Doug felt the warm liquid escaping him. She\u2019d wet herself. Two figures appeared, and then Doug woke up.\n\n\u201cMy partner says you know where all this is happening?\u201d a voice dripping in honey said. It was soft like velvet.\n\nDoug hadn\u2019t heard them approach.\n\nHe nodded his head.\n\nThe smile was better than he\u2019d imagined. It was like someone had turned the sun on.\n\n\u201cDo you mind showing us?\u201d Detective Pretty asked.\n\nIt sounded like a question but Herrera had already helped Doug to his feet. They walked out of the police station together, Doug sandwiched between the two officers.\n\nThe clouds were dense, and it smelled like rain. Doug asked the question he already knew the answer to as they led him to the back of the station. He\u2019d left his car at the front.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to follow you?\u201d he said, his voice raspy.\n\nThe detectives looked at each other. There was a very slight movement, one most people would\u2019ve missed. But Doug was a master at people watching.\n\n\u201cNo, sweetie. We\u2019ll take my car instead,\u201d Detective Pretty said.\n\nDoug gave a small nod.\n\nThey stopped walking when they\u2019d reached an old brown Ford Corolla, which was parked outside the police station car park, and around the corner. Doug looked around the area. It was deserted. And it was one of those alleyways that served no purpose. One of those that had meant to be something when the town changed from rural to urban. But Doug\u2019s thought was, no cameras.\n\n\u201cJason, get the cuffs,\u201d Detective Pretty said. And then in that sickly sweet voice, \u201cMy partner will cuff you, just because there are no grills in my car, but you\u2019re not under arrest. You\u2019re just showing us this place you dreamt about.\u201d\n\nDoug heard the sarcasm in the word \u201cdreamt\u201d. He knew they thought he was either crazy or guilty. And they weren\u2019t taking chances.\n\nAs the car rumbled off. Doug gave them little directions here and there. The stores and buildings of the city, gave way to sprawling farmland. And he thought about the girl, Amy Rawlings. Her face had haunted him enough to start trawling the internet for any details, or photos. This had to be more than a dream, and finding out about the college student, and seeing her face as it should have been, had sent shudders through his stomach.\n\nThe tension in the car seemed to grow the closer they got to the farm. The two detectives had stopped talking to each other. Doug felt more and more uncomfortable. The handcuffs were biting into him. He could sense their horror the longer they drove. He\u2019d told them he knew where the farm was, they hadn\u2019t asked him how.\n\nThe farmhouse was deep in the woods. It seemed to be one of those places time had forgotten. The building was whitewashed, and in a different era, had been picturesque. There were no neighbours or other people in sight. It was a good place for a dungeon.\n\nWhen the car stopped, the two detectives got out. Herrera wrenched Doug out of the car.\n\n\u201cHow the hell, do you know about this place, you little weirdo!\u201d he shouted.\n\nHe threw Doug to the ground, and the first kick was to his midriff, before he lost count.\n\n\u201cNot yet, honey,\u201d Detective Pretty said, \u201cI\u2019m dying to see what he looks like under that jacket. And he isn\u2019t even screaming. I know how much you love to break them.\u201d\n\nDoug couldn\u2019t see their faces but he knew they were kissing.\n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d Doug whispered.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re our first boy. You can join the little bitch in the barn,\u201d Detective Pretty said.\n\n\u201cCareful, baby, \u201cDetective Herrera said, \u201cDon\u2019t say too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, hush now. Who do you think this little weirdo will tell? So, you\u2019re really psychic?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Doug whispered again, his sides were hurting, and he thought he\u2019d bruised a rib.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill her just like we killed all the others. And you\u2019re going to dig her grave for me near the creek. Maybe dig one big enough for two, so I won\u2019t have to dig yours after we kill you,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nHerrera stopped talking as if something had just occurred to him.\n\n\u201cWho else did you tell about your dreams?\u201d\n\nDoug closed his eyes and whispered, \u201cNow\u201d.\n\nAs if out of thin hair he could hear the sounds of boots.\n\n\u201cFBI! Freeze!\u201d\n\nIt was over before the two detectives could even pull out their guns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Special Agent Douglas Hanson, FBI Paranormal Division,\" Doug said, getting up. \"And you're under arrest\".",

            "comment": "\\[Chromatic Friendship\\]\n\n\"So... he's not simply a delusional drunk?\" Professor Walton asked. He finished examining the gigantic, iridescent scale and handed it to his colleague. It was almost five feet across and heavy enough to require both hands. Its aquamarine surface caught the sunlight in rainbow bands as Professor Salazar received it for his own inspection. The trio of men stood in the Captain's study to discuss the true purpose of the trip. Professor Stillman invited them for some deep-sea fishing. After a full day's journey, he revealed his true motives the next morning. \r  \n\r  \n\"No, just a boastful one,\" Professor Stillman chuckled. \"By sheer coincidence of timing, we became drinking pals over the course of a few months. He found someone to listen to his drunk tales and eventually wanted to prove he was telling the truth. \r  \n\r  \n\"If he's so eager to prove it, why are we following him?\" Professor Salazar asked as he returned the large scale to Professor Stillman. The middle-aged man shook his head and set the scale in its velvet case. \r  \n\r  \n\"The man's wholly professional while sober,\" he chuckled. \"He won't say a thing about the island. He doesn't even remember he gave me that; he has dozens of them laying around according to him.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"I see,\" Professor Walton nodded. \"The scale sparked your interest; and the fact that satellites are no help only served to fuel your curiosity. Why us?\" he asked. \"This is in no way a complaint, however, there are others on the staff you're closer to.\" \r  \n\r  \n\"I admit, I wouldn't have considered us more than acquaintances yet,\" Professor Salazar agreed. \r  \n\r  \n\"That's precisely why,\" Professor Stillman chuckled. \"I would have felt somewhat silly inviting close friends on a chartered trip and still asking them to share the cost. Our somewhat distant relationships made that aspect easier.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Then, I expect us to get some fishing done,\" Professor Walton nodded. \"Even if we don't find this island of -,\"  \r  \n\r  \n\"SEA SERPENT!!!!!!\" one of the crew members barged into the study while yelling at top volume. A raucous commotion could be heard behind him outside. \"BRACE FOR IMPACT!\" Once his job was done he grabbed onto the nearest beam. The three smartest men in the room took an extra few moments to process the situation.\r  \n\r  \n\"What's that?\" Professor Stillman asked. They all each timidly grabbed a corner of the desk between them. \r  \n\r  \n\"SEA SERPENT!!!\" the crewman screamed again. His eyes were shut tight as he squeezed the wood for dear life. \r  \n\r  \n\"I'm actually a sea dragon,\" a new voice said. The three professors looked at the doorway. A short, tan, bald woman with sea-green stubble and matching rat tail hanging over her shoulder. Stood there with her arms crossed. \r  \n\r  \n\"You have no business in these waters, and I don't appreciate you following our transport. Leave and don't do it again,\" she said. \r  \n\r  \n\"Who are you?\" Professor Stillman asked. \r  \n\r  \n\"These are international waters, you have no claim!\" Professor Walton added.\r  \n\r  \n\"What's the difference?\" Professor Salazar asked. The stranger seemed to relax and she focused on Professor Salazar. \r  \n\r  \n\"The difference is, I'm a dragon,\" she took a few steps closer to the portly man and grinned. Then, she snorted blistering hot steam out her nose. It was close enough that he felt intense warmth from the air around it even without getting any of the moisture on him. Then, she turned to gaze at Professor Stillman behind the wooden desk.\r  \n\r  \n\"My name is Meredith, I represent Chroma Corp,\" she answered him and finally turned to glare at Professor Walton. \r  \n\r  \n\"Chroma Corp. owns the island you're looking for and the waters around it.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Who says we're looking for any island?\" Professor Walton retorted.\r  \n\r  \n\"I've been with the cargo ship since it left port; and, so have you,\" she said. \"Captain Price is a hell of a captain and a hell of a drinker,\" she grinned. \"You lot aren't the first group I've had to discourage.\" She leaned closer to Professor Walton and snorted steam in his direction. \r  \n\r  \n\"Are you bunch going to be smart enough to be the first group I don't have to kill?\" \r  \n\r  \n\"Wait, is there a third option?\" Professor Salazar asked. \r  \n\r  \n\"What?\" Meredith turned to face him. With her back to Professor Walton now, he noted a tattoo of the Earth on the back of her neck, beneath the aqua rat tail. It had the number 37 in golden digits on the Earth.\r  \n\r  \n\"You've given us two options; go back, or you kill us,\" Professor Salazar said. \"You've obviously got something hidden on that island you don't want anyone else finding out about. Is there any way I can find out what that is if I just promise to stay here on the island?\"  Meredith giggled and walked closer to him.\r  \n\r  \n\"You don't know what I'm hiding,\" she said. \"But, you know I'm a dragon, there could be more. How do you know it'll be safe?\" she asked.\r  \n\r  \n\"I don't,\" he shrugged. \"But, you're giving us the chance to leave,\" he said.  \"I'm hopeful.\" \r  \n\r  \n\"I like you, you can stay,\" Meredith patted him on the shoulder with a grin. \r  \n\r  \n\"I want to stay too!\" Professor Walton added. \r  \n\r  \n\"I can't go back alone...,\" Professor Stillman commented. He didn't want to stay; but, he also didn't want to be accused of murdering his colleagues at sea. Meredith shook her head at them.\r  \n\r  \n\"You, I don't like,\" she nodded at Professor Walton. \"Leave or die.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"You can't be serious!\" Professor Walton turned his gaze on Professor Salazar. \"You can't go with them, she's still threatening to murder us! You're going to stand by and let that happen?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"You have the option of turning back...,\" Professor Salazar shrugged. Then, he patted Meredith's shoulder in a clear gesture. \"...besides... I barely know you guys.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\r  \nThank you for reading! I\u2019m responding to prompts every day.

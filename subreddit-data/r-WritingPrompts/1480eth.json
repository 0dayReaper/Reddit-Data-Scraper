We take break from talking about my problems and I became curious of the battlefield in those times. Which Romi and Kyre saw. \"Did they deploy any dangerous mechanized warfare?\" I asked feeling curious.\n\n\"There were mechs but, they could have easily been categorized as walker tanks too. Mostly overrated piles of junk if you ask me. When I saw one go down with just two recoilless anti tank missile launchers, I was even more convinced of their worth in the battlefield. This doesn't mean that they aren't useless, but, utilization of such military assets is certainly quite challenging. Aliens chose mostly the bad places to use them\" Romi says.\n\n\"Really?\" I ask even more curious to hear his justifications.\n\n\"While it is good to have such unit in your military, maintenance, size, armaments, way of moving, cost of production, material requirement and piloting of such makes it very quickly not even close of worth it in large scale deployments. When I saw a Abrams fire two shots on one and destroy it. Well, let's just say, it will be very difficult to convince me that mechs are worth it\" Romi says.\n\n\"How could they be worth it?\" I ask wanting to hear if he could justify it.\n\n\"In hyper specialized roles, such as anti air and artillery roles. A fair argument could be made to an extent but, like I said, the issues I mentioned previously are still present and would need to be dealt with and for a long time. I do not see those issues being resolved anytime soon. Why those two in particular? Well, mostly because of mobility, positioning possibilities and ease of repositioning but, this all will be dependent on environment\" Romi says.\n\nBoth I and Kyre are listening carefully. What I know is that both Kyre and Romi are infantry. Romi has faced alien mechs multitude of times and Kyre just one less than Romi. So, I am willing to believe after giving it a bit more thought myself that Romi is right.\n\n\"What do you think Kyre?\" I ask curious to hear her thoughts.\n\n\"Well, main problem of mechs is size and design of it too. Military is all about maximizing ALL of the given platform's capabilities and mechs in the roles Romi mentioned, have an argument that can be made but, you would also run into troubles with sabotage in any given area of importance for the mech. Just few to mention are: Maintenance staff, mech itself, fuel and ammo. They would become priority targets for enemy infiltrators\" Kyre says and Romi nods in agreement.\n\nShe has a point, while you could disable one tank in same way, that loss wouldn't be as significant and eventually victims of the sabotage would learn. \"Have either of you been interested to operate one?\" I ask.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind a quick walk but, unfortunately I don't see humanity not being too keen on building one themselves, considering what we have witnessed. Something that I did not think about in first place but, the mechs would be pretty good for logistics. Loading, storing and delivery in certain cases\" Romi says.\n\n\"A view from on top of one, most likely is going to be amazing\" Kyre says and smiles warmly for a moment.\n\n\"Has our weapon, ordnance and ammunition technology simply made mechs completely useless?\" I ask.\n\n\"Yes, believe it or not but, tanks now a days fire darts\" Kyre says mildly amused and Romi is too.\n\n\"What? No way\" I say in utter disbelief of what I heard which made both of them smile for a moment.\n\n\"It is all in physics, we don't exactly know all that goes into it but, we do know that these darts are some serious designing wizardry, which is easily explained with physics why they are so potent in armored warfare and simply defeat the dream of walking titans\" Romi says.\n\n\"Can you explain the physics behind these ammunition of darts?\" I ask curious to hear it.\n\nRomi explains it to me and I feel dumb. What terrifying weaponry we, humanity have made. \"Mech would also be magnets for receiving all kinds of cruiser missiles, fighter jet payload munitions and or LAGMs and or LASMs. There is also GPBs to worry about\" Romi adds.\n\n\"Umm... Uh, I am lost. What does those acronyms mean?\" I ask.\n\nRomi thought for a moment \"Oh yeah, of course you wouldn't... My bad. Long range Air to Ground Missiles, Long range Air to Ship Missiles and Guided Penetration Bombs. Would cause a massive havoc to walker military platforms. The names already say enough?\" Romi replied realizing his mistake and inquires about does he need to clarify what he told me.\n\nI think for a moment. \"No need, I understand why now\" I say.\n\n\"At this time, humanity simply has developed means to counter mechs or armored walker tanks. To such extent that such just aren't worth it in the front lines. They are dangerous where you see them but, they simply just aren't reasonably well feasible to be deployed in such numbers as we do tanks today\" Romi says not being dismissive of mechs.\n\nAnd I do understand why really well now. Wow, I have to admit, Romi and Kyre do know their stuff.",

                    "comment": "Strongly reminds me of a passage from an old superman fanfic \"The Metropolitan Man\"\n\n&gt;Some years ago, he'd spent days trying to make what he called a battlesuit a practical reality. It was going to be a callback to the knights in shining armor, creating a solitary soldier encased in impenetrable armor and capable of advancing on enemy lines with impunity, mounted machine guns firing away the whole time while a diesel engine belched smoke. He'd drawn up schematics and eventually began stripping parts away, **replacing those things that thrilled the imagination with those that would work practically and reliably.** The steel legs were replaced with treads. The arms were removed in favor of a larger cockpit with buttons and levers. The center of gravity was lowered, until the cockpit sat between or just on top of the treads. He still remembered the feeling of looking down at his design and realizing he'd done nothing more than make a better tank.",

Engine would need to be MASSIVE to provide the torque needed for everything to move, source of energy would be something seriously expensive and really not worth loosing in the front lines. Humanity currently has pretty insane and relatively easy to produce means of destruction of such expensive equipment.\n\nWalking unfortunately is very inefficient way of travel for mechanized things. While I do want to one day see those myself too, reality is a harsh but, fair for those who already are grounded by it. For the hyper specialized roles that I mentioned, mech would have some space where it could be applied but, at this time.\n\nIt doesn't look like mechs are going to be effective and efficient form of front line combat. Also remember that we are only going to keep further developing the things we already have, which seriously are going to give idea of mechs even MORE grief.\n\nI listened to a video about this and it had such solid points against the idea that, I have to agree with them. For logistics for certain items, I can see Mechs having some space in reality but, most likely those would just be automated.",

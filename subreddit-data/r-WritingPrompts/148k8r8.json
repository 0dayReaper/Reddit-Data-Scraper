            "comment": "The Unlikely Companions: The Primrose Pocket Watch Affair \n\nThe White Cat, (Or Mr. Arthur Gilbert the second, Esq, as he claims to have once been his Christian name (certainly no relation to Mr Arthur Gilbert formerly of South Essex,or London) The renowned Gentleman Thief, dashing rake, he who relieves women of their hearts and wealthy bellends of their valuables once again paid me a visit to tell me tales of his latest endeavor. The dear reader may remember his boon associates, his comrades in arms, a group unlike any other chronicled: The Unlikely Companions.  If not, kindly allow me to introduce:\n\nShiro Yanafuda,  Born in 1841 (Age 24). A lost son from the land of the rising sun.   The son of a samurai whose father fell from favor and was obliged to commit seppuku.  Following the wishes of his dying mother he escorted a priest in their escape.  Thier ship was wrecked by a storm, fortunately, they were rescued by...\n\nJean-Paul Didier.   Born in 1789 (aged 75).   One of the finest men to ever sail the seven seas. In his youth, a  privateer (or pirate depending on whom one asks) in service to his native france.  He has circumnavigated the globe at least once, and engaged in exploits (the likes of which deserve writing of in their own right). Jean Paul is rumored to have countless progeny on every continent. Despite his age, (and peg leg) his vigor and lusts seem to be as potent as ever.\n\nEzekiel Roberts, Born in 1843 (22 years old)   Possibly the quickest draw in Texas.  Whether one believes the talk of those who are slow to draw their six gun (the ones who salve their sluggishness of hand with the gossip that our gunslinger is actually a woman, in man's guise) or not, it cannot be denied they can track, rope, and wrangle any varmint or desperado better than 99 out of 100.\n\nJoining our companions:\n\n19 year old Bess Tubman:   A young woman who escaped bondage in Charleston, and took the surname of the courageous woman who helped others escape slavery.  After helping our heroes escape the jail, relieve Varina Howell of her book of wicked magics, and commandeer a confederate ironclad. She has since found our samurai to her tastes.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nApril 14th 1865: The group gathered again. It had been some time since the incident of the first lady of the confederacy and her hoary grimoire. Though history would never know, they had saved the union yet again. There had been the adventure of the Jaguar's Heart, the rescue of Mr Clemens and the matter of Madame Noir  (that fortune teller of New Orleans).\n\nA grateful President  Lincoln had well rewarded them. Ezekiel Roberts had planned to return to their texas ranch (hoping to oversee some necessary repairs). \n\n Arthur Gilbert, still remembered as The White Cat (that modern-day robin hood who had vexed lawmen on both sides of the pond) had been breaking hearts and relieving southern belles of their valuables (among other things). Now he pondered what to do with the war over. Perhaps seeing the frontier Ezekiel spoke of would be interesting.  \n\nJean-Paul Didier was conflicted. His health was not as it once had been. His new ship ( he lamented being unable to keep the ironclad they stole from a Confederate port in their escape) was much faster than Le Mercure (that sailing ship he'd lost in the war).   \u201cThe ships are now to be iron like the men were when the ships were of wood!?!\u201d he exclaimed.    \n\nShiro had been nearly inseparable from the lady who helped them escape that Confederate prison. A stranger couple one might never have seen, though Jean-Paul shrugged. \"Such is life\".  The old pirate had illegitimate children on every continent and if drunk enough could be easily  persuaded to elucidate on the different flavors and pleasures of the women of the world.\n\nThier mutual friend Abraham Lincoln had invited them to see a play \u201cOur American Cousin\u201d.   Though a busy man, he'd listened intently to the tales of each of them. Many a memorable evening passed in his company.  The adventure of the Jaguar's Heart had introduced them to the slender giant of a man some years ago.  Due to an incident of a drunkard escaping from the law and a runaway carriage, they were delayed on their way to the theater. They arrived too late..\n\n\nOr so they thought. \n\nAs they were stopped at the door, there had been an outrage!     Someone had attempted to kill the president, but they had been stopped.   The theater was surrounded.    The inspector stared a the group a moment \"say, how did you get out here?  Were you not inside a moment ago?\"\n\n\"Begging your pardon, we just arrived. We were regretfully delayed\" Arthur Explained. \n\n\"But I saw you inside earlier....\".The inspector protested.  He shook his head. \"Never mind that, the president is at the surgeon's.   He asked for you lot, after you looked around the scene of course.\"  \n\nArthur nodded. \"of course we shall be happy to help\" \n\nThe inspector paused a moment and looked a the group curiously.. \"But I'm told you already did... The Japanese fellow took the assassin's hand\"\n\nShiro paused in confusion, and began to protest. Ezekiel nudged him, and the samurai thought better.  \n\nThe group entered the theater ...",

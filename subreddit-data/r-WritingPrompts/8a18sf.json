Some of these guys' stories have gotten me through some dark moods. I think that's made me more appreciative of the work people put into their submissions.

            "comment": "God looked at Johnny, not unkindly, but laid his own bow to the strings and said: Keep up if you can. \n\nAs God began pulling the bow, his violin gave a sound like a chorus of angels. Sweet where the devil\u2019s playing had an edge, and polished where the devil was frantic. It was also\u2026slow. God nodded at Johnny, who was only just starting to gather his wits. Johnny understood that he was to follow along. He picked up his newly-won golden fiddle and began playing along, note for note. Angels did not sing from the golden fiddle, but in the distance a hound started baying and God nodded in approval. \n\nGod brought the lick around and began playing it again, a bit faster, with some additional embellishment. 24 bars later and Johnny was still following along, focusing on keeping pace. They went on another few times through the lick, faster each time, sometimes Johnny, other times God adding a harmony or embellishing the melody. \n\nAs the devil sat and watched he saw a look of intense concentration on Johnny\u2019s face as he poured everything into the instrument. More surprising was the look on God\u2019s face. He was actually breaking a sweat! This was almost too much to be hoped for. If this boy were to foil God\u2019s plan, that would be game over for him. Proof that God was fallible! Even without that, the devil knew that while it might have been a sin for Johnny to pit his skill against the devil, it was definitely a sin to do so against God\u2014he\u2019d walk away with Johnny\u2019s soul either way. \n\nJohnny and God were no longer just playing follow the leader. Both fiddles sang, danced, cried, and howled, in perfect unison, and in perfect harmony. God looked back at Johnny and said \u201cYou are pretty good, I\u2019ll give you that, but follow this if you can\u2026\u201d \n\nAt that, God modulated the key. Johnny matched, and gradually, the fiddle began growing hot under his fingers. He watched as smoke or steam began to rise from the neck, and out of the holes in the body, but did not break his concentration as he continued the otherworldly duet. As the notes and the tempo soared higher and higher, so did the temperature of his new golden fiddle. Just as Johnny was beginning to truly fear that his burns would force him to drop the fiddle, God brought the music to a triumphant finale. \n\nJohnny nearly collapsed from the effort of the playing, and from the heat of the fiddle. God looked him over with a smile and said \u201cThat was mighty fine fiddling, son\u2014and a good thing too. You\u2019d never have fixed that demonic fiddle of yours if it hadn\u2019t been.\u201d Johnny looked up at God, with a question on his face, and the devil felt his stomach start to drop.  \u201cWell, y\u2019all realize that that gold was as corrupt as Beelzebub himself, don\u2019t you? If you hadn\u2019t kept up with me like you did, you never would have had the heat to burn all the evil outta that gold.\u201d \n\nGod looked over at the devil and said \u201cHe is truly like I made him. The best there\u2019s ever been.\u201d then, to Johnny, \u201cEnjoy that fiddle, son. You earned it.\u201d \n",

            "comment": "God didn't appear at all as Johnny had ever imagined him. He stood hirsute and barechested in the most outstretched leather pants that Johnny had seen short of a Def Leppard concert.  God's hair was a magnificent chestnut brown that flowed in the air, even with no wind blowing. God pointed at Johnny with a calloused finger and said, \" You've faced the rest, now face the best.\"\n\n\"Hi, uh... I'm Johnny, and I am true-lee sorry sir, but I got no idea who you are nor how you done fit in them britches,\" said Johnny. \n\nLucifer cringed with as much sincerity as a Prince of lies could manage. The effect was not unlike being fed a salted lemon. \n\n\"Ooh, newbie that was bad move. Even for you.\"\n\n\"WHAT? YOU'VE RELEASED THE FUCKING FURY. I AM HE WHO IS CALLED I AM! I INVENTED THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE MAN WHO RAISED THE MAN THAT MADE THE FIDDLE. I AM YAWEH MORNSTAR AND YOU WILL FEEL THE WRATH-\" said Lord God, \"OF MY APPREGIO.\"\n\nThe ground shook and Johnny could have sworn his shotgun shack was going to split in two. Violent, beautiful sounds erupted from the purple fiddle held in the hands of the Lord God. The sky spiraled into an intoxicating kaleidoscope of colors that Johnny could scarcely comprehend. Lord God began to bend his knees and swirl his hair around, forming a whirlwind of leaves at his feet. \n\nLucifer watched while buttering his popcorn and though it took all of his considerable strength, he did not smile at the mastery of Yaweh's finger movements. There was no waste in his energy, and he never paused to look at the strings. Suddenly, Lord God swung his fiddle around; in his right hand appeared an ornate, tea colored bow. The fiddle began to glow with an orange light and Yaweh started to strum.\n\nJohnny could not deny that he was meeting his maker, and yet, he was aware that the true effects of Lord God's playing were inconceivable to a human. Johnny looked back at Lucifer as sonic booms pounded against the landscape, bifurcating the trees. Lucifer had stifled admiration on his lips, but tapped his left foot in applause. \n\nAs Yaweh finished, he started swinging his fiddle around. It played perfect notes despite not actually having anything plucking its strings. Comets exploded millions of miles away in the sky and finally, after much too long, the sound died out. Lord God was still swinging. \n\nJohnny forced his jaw to close by hand and ignored his sweat-dampened overalls. \n\"Awright,\" said Johnny. \"Now I'm about to get in on i-\" \n\nTHUD!\n\nYaweh opened his eyes just in time to see one of his wild swings crack Johnny across the head, but not in time to stop it. Johnny was splayed out on the ground with a large, bleeding lump on his head. \n\n\"I might say you got carried out a little, but i just love your work,\" said Lucifer. \n\n\"I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME FOR YOU, BUT YOU WERE BEATEN BY A KID.\"\n\nLord God snapped his fingers and Johnny rose up as if held by strings. His blood stymied and the lump receded into his skull, and his eyes blinked open. His body turned upright as God made eye contact with him. Yaweh pushed his fiddle into Johnny's hands and winked at him. \n\n\"Cool,\" said Yaweh. \n\n\"Cool? \"\n\n\"Practice with this everyday. And when you're ready, I'll know,\" said Yaweh. \n \nGod turned and flipped his hair in a manner most elegant and stepped into a pillar of light. Lucifer clapped and slowly sank into the ground.\n\n\"Trust him, he knows what he's talking about,\" said Lucifer. His pinky and index finger extended into a strange hand gesture as he disappeared. Johnny could only nod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bowels shake, seas dry, mountains move all over the Earth. Johnny remains still, staring at his opponent with a stern grimace. God's fiddling intensifies. The music reaches all across the cosmos, shattering planets, exploding stars, warping time and space itself. Johnny remains calm. God pushes himself past his own limits, a bead of sweat drips down his forehead, his teeth clenched as this is by far the biggest challenge he's ever faced. Finally he brings his piece to a close with a grand finale of notes that brings Heaven, Hell, and Earth to a standing ovation. The Devil himself is brought to tears, applauding God's performance. Johnny, however remains unimpressed. Still staring at God with intent to best him. \n\nGod, out of breath, taunts Johnny \"SURELY YOU MUST BE MAD.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?\". \n\nJohnny walks up to a now incapacitated God, gun in hand. \"I killed the Men who killed my dog and stole my car, now I'm going to kill the man who killed my wife.\" God, now realizing the Fiddle Competition was just a ruse in order to draw him out, tries to reason with the assassin. \"WICK, YOU SON OF A BITCH! IF YOU KILL ME, EVERY ANGEL IN HEAVEN WILL COME AFTER YOU! YOU WON'T STAND A CHANCE!\" John smirks, \"Well, I guess I should start running.\" and fires a round right between God's eyes completing his quest for revenge.

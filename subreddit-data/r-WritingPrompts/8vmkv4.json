            "comment": "\"Jolly good show, my good man,\" he said, sitting on the right of my shoulder and inhaling deeply from his pipe. \"Positively smashing.\"\n\nI'd been watching Stranger Things for the last couple hours, trying to block them out. \n\n\"What kinda trash is this?\" the man on the left of my shoulder chimed, pacing up and down the length of it. \"This is just garbage, garbage I tells ya. Barb don't deserve to go like that.\"\n\nI sighed. I had not been succeeding. \n\n********\n\nThe bank teller peered quizzically at my shoulders, and I tried to smile. \"Please, it's best to just try and ignore them,\" I told her, glancing down briefly and praying that Mike would be able to keep it together. \"It's an, errr, *condition*.\"\n\n\"Nice rack on this bird, yaknowwhatI'mtalkin'about?\" he said, staring directly at her chest. Charles leaned over to chastise him.\n\n\"Now now Mike, what have we told you about manners? Although I dare say, that is certainly a bountiful bosom.\"\n\nI apologized profusely before security could escort me out. \n\n****\n\nAfter much deliberation, the two of them convinced me to go out to the library. This was always a challenging affair, as libraries were made for silence, and regardless, the three of us would need to pick a book that all of us liked to read. No such book existed. \n\nI - or we - were browsing the aisle, Charles trying to direct me to eighteenth century geopolitics, Mike complaining that there were no porn mags. I whispered for them to be quiet, and in the ensuing silence I heard three women speaking in increasing volume to my right.\n\nThe librarian shushed the women, and I heard one of them apologize, then the three continued in hushed voices. Again the librarian told them to be quiet.\n\nI rounded the corner, engrossed in my quest for fiction, and accidentally bumped into one of them.\n\nWell, *all* of them. \n\n\"Watch where you're goin', ya fuckhead!\" a tiny voice said while I attempted to pick up the fallen books. \n\n\"Fran, please watch your language, as I think you'll find we are in the company of gentlemen,\" another tiny voice said, as I - or we - slowly looked up.\n\nA beautiful woman stood before us. Furthermore, two more women stood on *her*. \n\n\"By Gods,\" Charles said, dropping his pipe. \n\n\"Fuck me,\" Mike replied. \n\n\"I... I...\" I stammered.\n\n\"Please, don't mind them,\" the woman said with a nervous smile. \n\nI nodded, still speechless. I'd never been able to talk to girls, not with these two on my shoulders. But this...\n\nThis could work.\n\n\"Take this guy to pound town before I do it myself,\" the tiny, brash woman on her left chimed. \n\n\"Or perhaps a delicatessen first?\" the tiny, posh woman on her right replied.\n\nThe librarian shushed us on our way out. \n\n****\n\nIf you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) \n\nI'll try add new (and old) stories every day &lt;3",

However I'm afraid I have to point out something, because it's a tad confusing. \n\nThe story starts off with the main character watching Stranger things, then all of a sudden he's at the bank and he's telling the teller to ignore his shoulder dudes. There's no transition between watching tv and the bank. I don't know what kind of banks you go to, but I've never been to one where you can hangout and watch netflix lol \n\nBut other than that, lovely little story. I like to imagine the English shoulder dude hooks up with the New Yorker shoulder chick, and vice versa lol \n\nEdit: *sigh* I had a typo. Shame on me lol ",

If it's an opposites attract kind of thing it doesn't particularly make sense to me as each counterpart is seen commonly chastising the other. \n\nI don't think simply switching genders would increase compatibility toward the characters' mannerisms.\n\nIf it's for more chaotic cross arguments I could see it, but it'd be a bit sad knowing the regular sized characters would have that much more difficulty being intimate.\n\n/u/croatianspy",

Yes, the counterparts are constantly chastising each other, harking to the dichotomy of the left/right good/evil symbolism that the WP alludes to. The constant conflict shows how the protagonist is just not in any sort of harmony or 'balance' in his life, and I made it clear that he's just not happy in the beginning of the story. \n\nWhen he meets the girl, the love interest, and they hit it off, I had the opposites pair because it symbolizes the protagonist finally finding harmony, finally finding balance between the two opposing forces. The balance of yin and yang. \n\nI'm sorry if this is not clear at all as I clearly haven't formulated it very well, but that's what I was going for. ",

It was getting crowded, but not yet to that \"rub up against multiple strangers just to cross the room\" point.\n\nEmbers of hope began to glow inside Mark. Maybe this could work. He smiled to himself, surveying the room. A few pool tables, a few dart boards, and...shit, a shuffleboard table. It even looked like it was in decent condition. Maybe he could see if one of the young women drinking what looked like vodka and cranberry juice wanted to -- \n\nA patron bumped into Mark, and said \"Watch it, dingus\" without breaking stride. That's when things took a turn.\n\nThe face of the small-but-portly man standing on Mark's left shoulder went scarlet with poorly-contained rage. \"The FUCK did you just call me? Hey FUCKNUTS, don't walk away from me, I'm talkin to you!\"\n\nMark cringed. Some of the people closest to him were staring now, others were nudging their friends. Still, as long as there was no response from Nigel, things would probably -- \n\n\"The language of the bard. Truly, your words drop as gentle rain from heaven.\" So much for that idea.\n\n\"Shut it, Limey, or I'll rip off your GOD DAMN CRUMPETS and dunk 'em in that SHIT WATER you call tea!\"\n\nA wave of silence had washed over the room. A few dozen cell phones seemed to have materialized out of thin air, all of them held aloft and pointed at Mark. \n\n\"Quite.\"\n\nMark sighed and began trying to pick his way through the assembled on-lookers. He was muttering, for the hundredth time, a prayer about being able to get out of the room before -- \n\n\"What are you lookin at, big tits?

Which didn't help me much, since my foot was still broken from the fall, and the big guy was still climbing down the fire escape. Maybe he would be as ungraceful as me when he jumped at the end?\n\n\"I wouldn't bet on that sir\"\n\n\"Not a chance, bro\"\n\n\"Well, maybe you two dialectic assholes could come up with a plan?\"\n\n\"Really, there is no nee...\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up, dude needs a plan, not English lessons\"\n\n\"Well, I never...\"\n\n\"Plan.\"\n\nThe steps were getting closer. The big guy was panting. Why didn't he shoot? Maybe no line of sight.\"\n\n\"Well, I see a revolver over there\"\n\n\"That's a pistol, bro\"\n\n\"Now who is giving English lessons?\" \n\nI tuned them out. Yes, there was indeed a black pistol lying next to me. Still, while I'm not from Texas, I still figure there is probably more to shooting a gun than the movies made it out to be. Still, it was at least I plan, I started crawling towards it. It hurt like hell.\n\n\"You go, sir!\" John exclaimed.\n\n\"Can you even fire that thing?\" Jack inquired.\n\nI put my hand on the handle, it was slick from the puddle it had been lying in. Did that matter? The clanks were close now. The big guy must be near the top.\n\n\"Sir, might I suggest that we switch locations?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I said.\n\n\"He means the fatso is going to land on you if he can\"\n\n\"Oh\" I said.\n\nThe clanking had stopped. Maybe the big guy was aiming as we spoke. I started rolling. Closer to the wall seemed like a good bet.\n\n\"Does the gun have a safety, sir?\"\n\n\"I don't know... Jack, do y...\"\n\n\"I'm not from fucking Texas, bro\"\n\nSome lumbering was heard. There was a thud. Big guy landed face first and his head exploded like a melon.\n\n\"Oh, sweet heavens, I'm covered in gore\" John wailed.\n\n\"This was a brand new shirt\" Jack complained.\n\nI puked.\n\n\"Who was that man? He seemed awfully annoyed\"\n\n\"He said something about money. You owe him money, bro?\"\n\nI dropped the gun. It clanked to the ground. I could suddenly feel my legs again. I could hear sirens in the distance.\n\n\"Ah, police officers. We shall be safe soon\".\n\n\"So why is Timothy tripping?\"\n\n\"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\n\"Look at him, he is tripping\"\n\n\"You misunderstand me, I don't understand what tr...\"\n\n\"Can you two shut the fuck up, for the love of god?\" I started crawling towards the alley-way. No disrespect for New York's finest, but I wasn't exactly on their Christmas card list.\n\n\"Sir, certainly you are not wanted by the police?\"\n\n\"Yeah, what the fuck man. I don't want to spend my afterlife watching you get double-teamed in Rikers'.\"\n\nI continued crawling. \n\n\"And why are you even here, Jack? Where is the small red man with the fork?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, small red man with a fork? And where is that chick with the cleavage and the white dress?\"\n\n\"Heaven and hell are not open right now\" I said.\n\nThey looked at me dumbfounded.\n\n\"Whatever do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\"Yeah, what the fuck man?\"\n\nIt's a long story I said, as I crawled the last feet two the sidewalk. I slowly managed to hobble myself up alongside a drain pipe.\n\n\"Well, perhaps you should tell it sir\" John demanded.\n\n\"Yeah man, don't leave us hangin\" Jack agreed.\n\n\"Can you two stop agreeing? It freaks me out. I swear I miss that little smug white-winged sex kitten and the tiny red freak.\u201d\n\nThey looked at me with a certain hint of nervousness.\n\n\"Sir.. wh\"\n\n\"Yeah m...\"\n\nYou're temps, okay?

Well, or worse... depending on your perspective.\n\n\"Temps?\"\n\n\"That sucks\"\n\n\"So, unless you have the key to purgatory, shut the fuck up the both of you\"\n\nThey fell into silence.\n\n\"Well...\"\n\n\"You know\"\n\nI looked at them with the same look of a man who is getting told by the wife he hates that she doesn't like him anymore.\n\n\"I do have this broken key\" John said.\n\n\"Yeah, me too\" Jack offered.\n\n\"Oh, look, they seem to fit together\" John observed.\n\n\"huh\" Jack concluded.\n\n\"Well, then\", I said as I hobbled onto the street while hailing down a cab. \"I might have a use for you after all\".\n\n\"Glad to be of service sir\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up you pussy\".\n\n\"You see\", I said as I painfully wrestled myself into the cab. \"I need to be neither good nor evil to use that key. And somehow\"... I looked at them both \"I think you two are perfect to achieve just that\".\n",

            "comment": "Johnathan, Johnny, and John\n\nIt was a cold day in Toronto, Canada. The Hockey game had recently ended, and a single man stood up against the wall in an alley, a hockey shirt with a maple leaf embroidered on it covering his torso as he looked up towards the man in front of him. A ruggish guy with a loose hoodie on, a smirk on his face as he pointed a knife towards the smaller man's neck.\n\nHis victim was named John... And John wasn't alone.\n\nOn his right shoulder, a young man with a short, but fancy, hairdo, a small, curly moustache, and a Victorian suit adorned with a top hat covering his body, and a monocle over his right eye.\n\n\"Have you tried a round of parley? Maybe this man is just looking for someone to converse it!\" Johnathan spoke, taking the pipe from his mouth.\n\n\"No one gives a damn about your parsley bullshit.\" Another man spoke from the left shoulder. A greased up pompadour stood up from his head, and he was dressed in a black, studded leather jacket, a white shirt, and some worn jeans. He stood up with a cigarette in his hand as he made a punching motion with his other.\n\n\"I say we clocks dis guy and go home already!\" Johnny said, giving off a smirk.\n\n\"Dear lord, must you always be so brutish?\"\n\n\"Hey, if you wants to see brutish, you should see my mother-in-law!\"\n\n\"Oh please, like any lady would waste her precious time with you, of all people.\"\n\n\"SO YOU THINKS YOUR FUNNY, EH? IT WON'T BE SO FUNNY WHEN I POUND YOU INTO NEXT WEE-\"\n\n\"Guys, please!\" John said, his attacker giving a confused expression for a second, his two companions straightening up on his shoulders.\n\n\"Just hand over the money, and you won't get hurt. It's simple.\"\n\nJohn grit his teeth as his hand slowly reached towards his back pocket.\n\n\"WHAT?\" Johnny said immediately. \"YOU'RE JUST GONNA HANDS YOUR CASH OVER TO THIS PUNK?\"\n\n\"Indeed.\" Johnathan nodded. \"Though I abhor violence, I'd rather you not hand over our well-earned money.\"\n\nJohn shook his head as he took a deep breath. \"What other choice do I have?\"\n\n\"None.\" The attacker said. \"Now hand it over.\"\n\n\"HEY, WE ARE NOT HANDING OVER OUR MONEY. KAPISH? DECKS DIS BOZO SO WE CAN MOVE ON.\"\n\n\"Or at least try to talk him down.\"\n\n\"IT'S JUST A KNIFE. WHERE I COMES FROM, WE DEALS WIT' GUNS. DIS IS NOTHING!\"\n\n\"Now, now, Johnny. Never underestimate an opponent's capabilities.\"\n\n\"How about I *overestimate* the amount of punches it would take to shuts ya up?\"\n\nFortunately, between their bickering, a bit of luck would come out.\n\n\"Hey! What's going on over there?\" A guy shouted from the entrance of the alley. All four of them looked over as a man in a Toronto police uniform began approaching the scene.\n\n\"Fuck!\" John's attacker said as he immediately sprinted away, leaving his victim behind... Alive, thankfully. Instead of chasing after him, the Officer walked up towards John and gave him a pat on the shoulder.\n\n\"You alright there?\" He said, smiling lightly.\n\n\"Yeah... Thanks for the help, eh? Sorry if I caused you any problems.\" John replied, giving out a hefty sigh.\n\n\"Hey, it's my job! You take care of yourself now, and stay away from these alleys.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" John replied, nodding.\n\n\"So you lucksed out.\" Johnny said, as they walked out of the alley. \"That don't mean I can't teach you a few moves for next time!\"\n\n\"Or at least work on improving his conversational skills.\" Johnathan replied.\n\n\"Hey, good idea! We'll teach him how to intimidate too!\"\n\n\"That is *not* what I meant!\"\n\n...\n*About an hour later*\n\nJohn walked up to a local Tim Hortons, letting out a small sigh. He was still shaken up from nearly getting mugged.\n\nAs he opened the door, a girl who was coming out immediately bumped into him.\n\n\"Ah, sorry!\" John said, and she just gave a small smile as she nodded.\n\n\"HEY, LOOK OUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING! WE'RE WALKIN' HERE, YA KNOW!\" Johnny shouted from the left shoulder, as Johnathan let out an annoyed sigh and facepalmed.\n\n\"You are aware that she can't hear you, right?\" He said, looking up towards her as she looked directly towards the two, eyes wide. \"...Oh dear.\"\n\n\"L-look. I can explain.\" John said.\n\nA couple minutes would pass as John sat down in front of her, a coffee in his hand as he slowly took a sip.\n\n\"So, uh... Who are you guys?\" She spoke, her eyes constantly darting between the three faces.\n\n\"Name's Johnny. Johnny Russo, from Brooklyn, New York. Dat ove' der is Johnathan, from Whereverthefuckshire, England.\"\n\nHis companion cleared his throat into his fist. \"Downtown London. Sir Johnathan Crawford at your service, pleasure to make your acquaintance.\" He said, giving a small bow.\n\n\"And, uh... I'm John Smith... From here in Toronto. Not nearly as interesting, I know.\" John said, forcing a chuckle.\n\nShe gave a small smile in return. \"I'm just Mary. Also from Toronto. So what's up with these two anyways? How'd they get there?\"\n\n\"Well... It's kind of a long story, eh? Happened aboot 5 years ago. They claimed to be my... previous reincarnations.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is correct.\" Johnathan said, adjusting his bowtie. \"Our soul is quite special indeed. Though how a marvelous gentleman like myself turned into such a hoodlum is beyond my expertise.\" He said, giving a glance towards Johnny.\n\n\"Hey, you're just jealous cause I actually know how to live!\" He replied, giving a shrug.\n\n\"If your definition of living involves incarceration.\" He said, rolling his eyes.\n\n\"Wait, wait...\" Mary said, holding her hands up. \"You guys are... past reincarnations? So, how did you die.\"\n\n\"Well...\" Johnathan started. \"I grew up with a rather well off family from London. But I had the misfortune of being born in a rather complicated time period. I, unfortunately, perished along the borders of France during the early years of the First Great War.\"\n\nMary nodded soundly as she looked towards Johnny.\n\n\"I got blasted by some punk from a rival gang in da early 60s.\" He said casually, making a finger guns with his hand and made a small \"Pew\" sound.\n\n\"And, I haven't died.\" John shrugged. \"Not yet anyways.\"\n\nShe chuckled. \"You know, you're pretty interesting John. How would you like to meet up this weekend?\"\n\n\"Wait... Me? I'm like the least interesting person in this conversation.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't think so at all.\" She said, writing her number down on a small napkin. \"The fact you have them at all is pretty interesting to me. I'd like to learn more about you.\"\n\n\"O-oh... And I guess I would like to know how you saw them at all.\"\n\n\"See? We both have a reason to talk to each other!\"\n\nThe conversation went on a little bit longer before John eventually walked out of the building.\n\n\"DAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!\" Johnny shouted, throwing his hands in the air. \"IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GOTS INVOLVED IN DIS WHOLE DATING SHEBANG.\" \n\n\"Yes, jolly good show, mate. I say, we must get you some proper attire! Fear not, my dear John, I shall teach you everything I know about being a gentleman.\" Johnathan replied from the other side.\n\n\"Aww, thanks guys. Time to go home, eh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, whatevers. Just grab me a hot dog on da way der.\"\n\n\"You are aware that you can't consume it, correct? You are, after all, just a spirit.\"\n\n\"Dat's funny!\" Johnny replied. \"Last time I checked, so were you! Yet every time we talk you asks for a knuckle sandwich!\"\n\nJohn sighed as the two started going at it on his shoulder. \"What a strange life.\"",

            "comment": "My names Ned. There\u2019s really nothing all that interesting about me on the surface. I\u2019m 24, recently moved out of my parents house, now living in a small 1 bedroom apartment, and I work at a big corporate paper company doing sales from a tiny windowless cubicle. I\u2019m not complaining though, in fact this is more or less the life I expected. It\u2019s safe, simple, and easy. \n\nMy extracurricular life isn\u2019t much different to be honest, since I don\u2019t really have many friends. There\u2019s Hank, a quiet bloke who I met a few years back at college. Every Thursday I go over his place after work, and we quietly watch some TV with a few beers and some pizza. And then there\u2019s my 3 year old dog Nacho, named so because when he was a pup, I made a some nachos, went to the bathroom to wash my hands, and came back to an empty plate.\n\nReally I am fine with all of this, or rather I was fine with all of this. I would have been perfectly happy to live out the rest of my life in this particular fashion. At least that\u2019s what I kept telling myself.\nBut then, there was Maria, and Bob, and Nigel.\n\nMaria. Oh Maria. Why did you have to start working on the other side of my cubicle wall? From the moment I laid eyes on her, everything changed. And I\u2019m not talking about the normal cute crush type of things; Butterflies in the stomach (they were there), the constant need to get up and take a quasi stalker-ish peek (I did), the \u2018accidental\u2019 eye contact, and quickly look away motion over at the water cooler (guilty as charged). No I\u2019m talking about something far more bazaar.\n\nThe moment my heart fluttered for this woman, the strangest, most annoying, impossible,  potentially psychotic thing happened. 2 small men magically appeared on my shoulders.\n\nYou heard me. 2 small, bickering, obnoxious, argumentative, imaginary middles aged men, were now sitting on my fucking shoulders. \n\n\u201cYo you gonna hit that or what?\u201d \n\nI turned around, nobody was there. I went back to my computer screen.\n\n\u201cI said you gonna tap that ass or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho said that?!\u201d I whispered loudly, turning around to see nothing.\n\n\u201cRobert, I hardly think that type of language is necessary\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up Nigel you old fart\u201d\n\nI slowly turned to my right. To my shock, there was a little, overweight man, mid 40\u2019s, sitting on my shoulder, drinking a beer.\n\n\u201cHi\u201d\n\nI screamed in absolute horror, swatting this monstrosity of my shoulder like a big giant bug. \nMy hand only went through it, like a ghost.\n\nStill screaming, the other voice chimed.\n\n\u201cCalm down sir, calm down, there is no point in over reacting\u201d\n\nI look to my left, and see another small man sitting there. This one is dressed to the nines, sporting a tobacco pipe, with a very posh British accent. I swat away at him too.\n\nNigel: \u201cI\u2019ll say, is this really necessary?\u201d\n\nNed: \u201cget off, get the fuck off!! Ahhhhh!!!\u201d\n\nRobert: \u201cI don\u2019t think he likes you. I don\u2019t even like you\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still wailing around trying to forcefully brush them both off my shoulders.\n\nNigel: \u201cWell that\u2019s completely besides the point! Please sir, we are only here to help you.\u201d\n\nNed: \u201cGet off me Demon MONSTERS!!!\u201d I silently yelled\n\nRobert: \u201cYou hear that, he thinks we\u2019re monsters! Yea well go fuck yourself too, you little scrawny bitch!\u201d\n\nNigel: \u201cYou\u2019re not helping Robert! Please sir, nobody can see or hear us except you!\u201d\n\nNed: \u201cI said GET OFF!! \n\nI screamed this so loud it caused my co-workers to stand up, and stare at me, confused.\n\nEmbarrassed, and wide eyed, I said,\n\nNed: \u201cSorry, uh, rude caller\u201d\n\nEveryone cautiously sat back down.\n\nNigel: \u201cNed, as I said, nobody can hear or see us. Just you.\u201d\n\nNed: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you are, but this is Not normal!\u201d\n\nRobert: \u201cNo shit kiddo\u201d\n\nNigel rolled his eyes.\n\nNigel: \u201cWe were sent here for you sir, to help you with your quest.\u201d\n\nNed: \u201cWhat quest?

I was the only one that could see them, but that didn't make them not real did it? I mean I wish they were, they're not great at advice. My story isn't uncommon among \"schizophrenics.\" My parents noticed something had changed almost immediately, I think they brushed it off as feeling weird about turning 15. But they saw eventually, or I slipped, and to the doctors we went. The medicine always  They were just always talking and no one else could see or hear them. Sometimes they'd be heckling the teacher, or each other, or me. So I got really good at my poker face and they called that I was \"flat\" which is ridiculous, I just have a good poker face.\n\nI looked up from the window. Moe was picking his teeth, a chunk of chicken hit my face. \"You know kid you got a lot of learning to do about oral hygiene.\" He said before putting the edge of his thumb back in his mouth. I sighed and stood up from my normal seat by the window, the only place where they wouldn't comment. Boring was always better than interesting with these two around. The rec room was the same bland brown and tan tones used by all the other hospitals too. The lighting was soft and gentle. The clothes I wore were the height of comfort. Too bad they had the \"long term treatment\" facility's logo on the front. ",

To fight an enemy.\n\nThey asked for our meanest, our toughest, our most troubled.  To recruit from our jails, our prisons,  our insane asylums, our slums, our homeless camps, our menial jobs.    No matter what a person had done or what condition they were in, a place would be found for them. \n\nThey asked for anyone willing to join on an  adventure. Those willing to fight horrific battles.  They asked for volunteers.   In that old tradition earth does so well. To scrape the scum, the misfits,  into a fearsome fighting force. \n\nThey bought cures for illnesses, physical, mental spiritual.  A renewing for those who accepted.   \n\nThe deal was your relatives would be well  rewarded,  and planet healing tech distributed.  If you survive your own dimension to settle as you see fit,  but you cannot return to earth again..   if you fall you will be remembered forever.     \n\nWe leave behind our illnesses, our troubles, our mistakes.  \n\nWe leave behind our loved ones, our previous hopes and dreams. Our previous ways of life. \n\nWe are the forlorn hope, the wayward children of earth.   We are the Centuari Foreign Legion..",

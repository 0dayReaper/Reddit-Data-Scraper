            "comment": "Asla had never travelled this far east before. She chose to hike the last stretch of her journey, leaving her beat-up car under a tarpaulin, tucked behind a copse of trees. Nature had beat back man\u2019s progress here, and all she had for company were the skittish wildlife, the rush of the waterfalls, the snowflakes cascading down belligerently. Walking rejuvenated her, but more importantly, it gave her a chance to attune her senses, probe for the Folkvarthr, the guardian of the town.\n\nShe found him perched on a rocky outcrop, just a couple of miles from Seydisfjordur. Asla knew she made no noise, left barely an imprint on the fresh snow beneath her feet, but before such an experienced master, she might as well have been beating a drum, strumming a lyre.\n\n\u201cFolkvarthr, I come in peace,\u201d she said, keeping her distance. She used the honorific so that he would know that she was cut from the same cloth, another member of the ancient clan sworn to protect their country. Underneath her shawl, she gripped her twin knives, priming her defences. It never hurt to be prudent.\n\nThe older man turned then, and for a moment Asla wondered if the reports were embellished. There was a placid calmness to him, and none of the fire and brimstone she was cautioned about. His eyes, dulled with age, reminded her of the frozen orbs she sometimes had to scrape out of bowls she had left out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall asking to be relieved,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not yet battle-weary. I intend to guard this town until I die.\u201d\n\n\u201cOlafur, you have done us a great service,\u201d Asla replied. \u201cThe records run with the great deeds you have accomplished. You have saved this town more times than anyone can count. You have more than earned your rest.\u201d\n\nOlafur scrounged on the ground, picked up a couple of smoothened pebbles. Asla narrowed her eyes, but this time she was over-suspicious \u2013 Olafur aimed the small missiles not at her, but at three spots away from them, one to the north and the others to the west. There was but a bleak light still illuminating the valley, so Asla relied instead on her hearing to determine where the pebbles landed.\n\n\u201cThose are where the rifts are,\u201d said Olafur, dusting his palms off. \u201cThe monsters don\u2019t come as often now, but they still can, and they still do. They are different from the ones you deal with back in Reykjavik, or wherever the hell you came from. Nature emboldens them. They don\u2019t emerge at night, skulking in the shadows. No, these prefer the day, where they revel in being seen, being feared. There\u2019s a sadism in these parts that only I can handle, young one.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a sadism alright, thought Asla, but instead she said, \u201cI will be straightforward, Folkvarthr. This is not a request. The Council has asked that you retire, with immediate effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? After all the good work I\u2019ve done?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo good, in fact,\u201d said Asla. \u201cReports have come in that you no longer communicate with the town, that you have completely shut yourself off from them. The local children don\u2019t even dare come near you anymore, and they have started calling you the Boogeyman, the Reaper. Even worse, the monsters that you slay\u2026 you\u2019re not just putting them down, you\u2019re *slaughtering* them. The Council has reason to believe that you-\u201d\n\nOlafur chose to move at that moment, streaking in a blur towards highground. Asla was ready, and so she followed closely behind, matching him step for step. She considered the possibility that he was leading her towards a trap, but pushed that thought away. She had to believe that there was humanity yet left in him.\n\nSome hundred feet above the ground, a cave opened up alongside the hill, hidden if one were only looking in from the roads. Olafur paused there, then snapped his fingers, bringing to life the candles within. Asla discerned immediately the two urns on one side of the cave, and the heaps of ash on the other.\n\n\u201cThey took my family, was that in your reports too?\u201d Olafur asked. \u201cI had just saved the town from another invasion, took down no less than three ghouls and two ogres on my own. They come in waves, so I thought we were safe for a while. But they were hiding, down by the waters when my daughter went to swim. My Hansa struggled with them, but she is no practitioner of glima that I am.\u201d\n\nIn that moment, Asla understood why the Council had chosen her, of all the practitioners, and a tiny bit of the tension in her seeped away. She was not going to die here today, after all. \u201cNo words can convey my condolences,\u201d she said, eventually.\n\nOlafur didn\u2019t seem to hear. \u201cAnd everyday, everyday I add on to the ashes of my enemies. I think, maybe, when there\u2019s enough of it, it will all make sense again, feel right again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas it worked?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Olafur, \u201cnot yet. And that is why I cannot stop, you see? I have to keep going. I have to keep-\u201d\n\nAsla lashed out, her knives glinting as they sung through the air. She was not given to surprise attacks, but this was an opponent far more skilled than she was, and she would have to take what the gods of chance gave her. Heck, she had only felled the one ogre in her life, and that was quite an anemic one at that. \n\nOlafur caught her blows easily, striking at her wrists, deflecting her attacks. He stepped in, pushed his shoulder against her midriff, then lifted her legs. Asla tensed and recoiled, twisting in the air, landing on her feet. If she fell, it was over.\n\nRound and round they went, like marbles in a cone, striking and rebounding, feinting and parrying. At times it seemed that Asla, with her youth and vigor and aggression, had the edge. But Olafur would come back, a crashing fjord of implacable power, brushing her off like a weevil. Then, a slip, as Asla\u2019s foot caught on an uneven patch of ground, throwing her off just a couple of inches.\n\nOlafur seized the moment, overwhelming her with a deathgrip. Asla kept still, quivering despite her best efforts. She was at his mercy.\n\n\u201cWhy does the Council stop me?\u201d he asked, breathing heavily. \u201cCan a man not have his revenge?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are showing signs of taint, Olafur! Do you not see that? In a year, or two, will your bloodlust have calmed?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am *in control*!\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do you think I have not snapped your neck?\u201d\n\nAsla sighed, then relinquished her knives, dropping them to the ground. Olafur had not yet yielded in the face of her surrender, so there was only one course of action left. \n\n\u201cI bring with me too another message from the Council,\u201d she said. \u201cStraight from your master\u2019s mouth, the same one who assigned you here years ago. He bids me to remind you that you have done your part, that you deserve, at the least, some rest. \u2018Any of us can quell the monsters, Olafur, but only you can tend to your wounds. Let Asla carry on your work for you.\u2019 That is what he said.\u201d\n\nAsla waited, and eventually Olafur loosened his hold. She broke free, then turned to assess her opponent. The fight had deserted him, and the hunch in his back, the despair on his brows \u2013 there was no more duelling to be had. Olafur averted his gaze, but Asla caught the hint of moistness in his eyes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2026 she would be around your age, if she were still alive, you know?\u201d Olafur said, staring off into the distance.\n\nYou bastards, she thought. It\u2019s not fair sending someone who reminds him of his daughter to fight him. That\u2019s just underhanded.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said.\n\nThere they sat, as the sun completed its retreat, and the stars reclaimed their fair share of the heavens. From the distance they heard the merriment from the town \u2013 preparations were underway for the winter festivals, and Asla sensed that even the monsters would have the decency to stay away this night.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s good for dinner?\u201d she asked, tentatively.\n\nOlafur sighed. \u201cI can show you, if you like.\u201d\n\nAsla smiled.\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny \n",

            "comment": "Conventions are my favorite time of the year. We all knew we were killers, and knowing who all the other killers were helped people get along. Sold a secret? Everyone would hunt you down the next day. \n\nEveryone had their flair out, so you could have as much fun as you wanted while still fitting in. The Japanese would dress all in earth tones, while the Italians would put on fantastically gauche suits. The British, as always, sent their best in a tuxedo. I wore my best denim. \n\nNobody ever expected a Canadian assassin. We were there in WWII, killing Hitler in his bunker before the other Allies even arrived. They had to burn the body and claim suicide to cover up their incompetence. We were there when Osama bin Laden was found. I'll bet the Navy Seals won't tell you they found him chained to his desk with a complimentary last meal of poutine. \n\nDon't think we're friendly. We don't take anybody's side but Canada's. We were there when JFK was shot. It was so simple to play one superpower against another and score lucrative deals for the Canadarm project. It's nice to know we can smuggle a high-powered laser into space, even if it's only one shot. \n\nStill, an assassin is only as good as his cover. We instill our children from an early age just how to act in public while we train them in private how to apply political pressure points as well as physical ones. We're the kindest, nicest people around when somebody is watching. \n\nWe train to be normal and accepting, while pushing the idea that a sneaky killer has to know kung fu and how to throw daggers. The Japanese popular culture has already been successfully subverted, and we're working with a mole at Ubisoft to produce more Assassin's Creed games to subvert Arab, British, Italian and now Egyptian cultures. They would never suspect us. \n\nWe could even get away with an assassination here at the convention, just for fun. I bump into another excited conventioneer dressed head-to-toe, embarassingly, in his mother's best black sheets. I pull the punch knife from his kidney slowly while the invisible needle in his neck stops him from screaming. \n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\nEDIT: Got the Assassin's Creed publisher wrong. Changed \"EA\" to \"Ubisoft.\"\nEDIT: Thank you, kind stranger!",

But the rest of it was so good that I don't even care. And after an immersive cast of characters takes you through a historically educating journey in one of my favorite narrative settings ever, you get to play the multiplayer, which was SO MUCH FUN. Deadly hide and seek tag, like the old need for speed games but with assassins and parkour. I killed so many hours with that. You get a beautiful open world with *optional* fast travel, a fighting system that while not overly difficult still feels satisfying, just enough ship action to still keep interest despite its difficulty, all the collectibles you could want, more than sufficient customization and crafting, and even the side quests that had *animals* as bosses were captivating. I'm pretty sure that game jump started my brother's interest in history single handedly. Also Desmond was still in it, and the future segments had decent enough action and puzzles, but I kept rushing to make it back to the colonies. ",

Set in glade alone, ringed by silent pines, the the wooden hut looked ancient, and it was.\n\nFirst built by the United Ninja Clans nearly four-hundred years ago, it was meant to be a place of quiet reflection and shared experience. A place where the clans of the world would gather once a decade and celebrate their skill and discuss the world-at-large. Now, in these dark times, the meetings that the hut hosted had taken on a new meaning.\n\nThe heavy wooden door groaned deafeningly as Kentaro-san swung it only wide enough for his thin, sinewy frame to slip through. The interior of the hut was silent and as cold as outside beneath the stars. In the center of the hut sat the great round table that so many of his ancestors and peers had sat at through the decades. A nightbird outside called out to no-one. He was early.\n\nAs the senior member of Clan Nihon, as well as its most learned, he was elected by his peers to attend this most grave of meetings. A representative from all of the clans would be in attendance: the Shogun-Cowboys of the Americas, the copper-and-cotton Hashassins of the Arabic nations, the brightly-patterned but silent Warrior-Priests of Africa, and the long-hidden tribesmen from the Amazons. Even the Voices of Valhalla from the cold north, who rarely came down from their blissful mountain sanctuaries, would be in attendance. Indeed, the threat from The Orange One was too great to ignore further.\n\nTo keep his early arrival to himself, Kentaro-san slipped into the shadows on his padded footwear. Wedging himself between a thick wooden stud and an eons-old chair, he prepared himself to meditate silently while awaiting the arrival of his fellow ninjas.\n\nJust as he closed his eyes for prayer, he heard the deep, booming Voice of Valhalla call out from seemingly nowhere, and everywhere:\n\n\"Glad you could join us, Kentaro-san. Go ahead and dial in - the conference call number is on the table.\"",

Most importantly, I would've added a line in the first paragraph mentioning how Kentaro had been watching the hut from the treeline for hours and only decided to move to the hut after careful observation and no activity - this would've really driven home the point that the other ninja masters had snuck by him and were already in the hut",

            "comment": "My codename is Green Man because technically I'm a recycler. I repurpose the old, shine it up nice and sleek so that it may be made new. Most people don't know this, but the modernization of Japan has never quite stopped. There are pockets of holdouts where tradition clings on. Like the samurai of old, it's my job to repurpose their stubbornness before they are gunned down by Gatling guns. \n\nOr, you know, in this case, DNA seeking armor piercing sniper bullets discharged from an auto-drone flying miles in the air.\n\nBut try explaining that to guys who toss ninja stars at dart boards.\n \nMost of my students are under the impression our roles are reversed.\n\n\u201cSami-son,\u201d they call me. \u201cDo you see how the wind blows?\u201d\n\nThey smile, the edges of their masks crinkling up like dimples. \n\nI pinch the bridge of my nose and sigh. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re standing under a vent,\u201d I try to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s called air conditioning.\u201d\n\nOther times, I sit the ninjas down and pop them popcorn. I\u2019ve blocked out time for a James Bond marathon, so they may see how a real spy operates in the treacherous political climate of the modern day. Plus, I mean, hey, there\u2019s nothing wrong with entertainment. \n\nExcept one class clown tosses popcorn at another. Before I know it, they're missing the damned point. They're hiding in the shadows, kernels flying from behind curtains. I have to pause the movie, get my receptionist to lead them back to their assigned seating. \n\n\"See, what we teach!\u201d exclaims one. \u201cYou hide in the shadows, become one with darkness.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, dear,\u201d Brenda the receptionist says. \u201cWe simply had to turn on the lights.\u201d\n\nCorporate likes to bill our academy as an astounding success. The big guys upstairs boast at every holiday party. Once again, the West helps out the little brother in the East. But truth is, they\u2019ve never stepped foot inside the academy. They just smile and clap my back, saying, \u201ckeep up the good work.\u201d\n\nOr, even worse, they pull me aside and pitch their next brilliant idea. We\u2019re talking idiocy ranging from amphibious ninja-manned submarines to planting ninjas in the secret service. \n\nLike, just yesterday, a stiff in a suit pulled me aside and said one word. His teeth were grayed from way too much coffee. \n\n\u201cHackers,\u201d he whispered, raising his bushy brows. \n\nSo, the ever-obedient Green Man must now sit ninjas down in front of a computer. \n\nMy first pupil powers the thing on and attacks it like a pecking chicken. One peck here, and *oh look another kernel!*\n\nI try to explain the assignment, one more time. \n\n\u201cListen, we just need you to open up Microsoft Word. Locate the target word file.\u201d\n\nHis eyes are so blank it\u2019s practically insulting. To help him out, I get a printout of the document we\u2019re looking for. \n\n\u201cSee here, read the title. *Trump\u2019s ties to Russia*. Now we go find.\u201d\n\nThe masked man nods so fast, the knots nearly come loose. He squints at the screen and begins pecking away. Letters miraculously form in the search bar. The ninja\u2019s fingers become a blur. For a moment, I think we may be on to something. \n\nLike, maybe my career is worthwhile after all. I look over to Brenda and give her a thumbs up.\n\nAnd when I turn back, my example sheet is missing. The ninja winks at me, and my stomach just drops. \n\nHe\u2019s got the sheet folded between his fingers.\n\n\u201cAlways be watching, Sami-son,\u201d he says. \u201cLet not even the call of a grasshopper sway the focus of your mind.\u201d\n\nFrom her desk, Brenda snorts out a laugh. I tell her to go print off another copy, and when she slaps it on the table, I lean in to whisper.\n\n \u201cGive corporate a call. I\u2019m putting in for a transfer.\u201d \n\n---------------------\nr/writerscrywhiskey\n",

            "comment": "What do you see when I say the word 'ninja'? Clad in black, hooded, some kunais and knives hanging from their belt? Well, that just shows you how bad they really were at hiding. Sure they're trying to reinvent their image but their so steeped in history that the elders find it appalling to change tradition.\n\nBut they're not the only ninjas that exist. There's more, all around the world. They hide in plain sight.\n\nYou want an example? Well, find the most hipster looking guy or girl around you. See one? Alright, follow them. They're heading to the Chatime stand, right? Well, I know for a fact what they're gonna order. Caramel Milk Tea, extra bubble jelly and five shots of sugar. Absolutely diabetic, but that's the secret code they give to get their mission. Even the employees don't know about it, they just mindlessly key in the order and swipe their rewards card, which is more identification. They get that little slip of paper, and from there they get their mission before rubbing the ink off with their finger.\n\nThat's how we get our missions.\n\nWeapons? Well, it is illegal to openly carry here in Malaysia, but phones are getting pretty smart these days, and theirs are no exception. They mainly get by without attacking anyone, using the phone with top of the line decryption algorithms to get through the toughest security there is. But when push comes to shove they've got a trick or two up their sleeves. Their glasses have sharpened ear rests. Their phones can fire a tranquilizer dart from the charging port. Used to be the headphone jack but Apple caught on to us. Had to change it. That's about it really. Our ninjas specialize in information. Which is why you don't see many unexplainable deaths happening here.\n\nOnly one you may have heard of is the Altantuya case, but we needed him to take the top spot. We thought he'd be easily manipulated. Then he started getting greedy, so we started leaking stuff online.\n\nBecause we deal in information.\n\nWhich is why I'm talking to you openly about this. Because you're not supposed to be here much longer. Nice meeting you by the way. You're a great listener.\n\n----------------------\n\nDone at a restaurant on mobile, so forgive the writing. Feedback always welcome! Just wanted to sort of build the world I suppose. ",

My target is due downstairs in about 10 minutes, so I have plenty of time to check over my equipment.\n\nPoison needles... check. Ceramic dagger... check. Ballpoint pen... check.\n\n...oh shit... is that **Fukunaga?**\n\nFuck. It is.\n\nI catch him staring at me from a bush outside. He's dressed in that idiotic ninja garb that screams \"**HEY, OVER HERE!!! I'M A NINJA!!! DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU CAN SEE ME!!!**\"\n\nNow, I have much respect for the traditions of the *kage*. They were once the great warriors of the shadows, and could infiltrate a castle, kill a man, and leave before anyone was aware they were a target... and best of all, no one would suspect it was an assassination.\n\nThen they got cocky.\n\nThey let word of their deeds out, purportedly to \"spread fear among their potential victims.\" They also let themselves stagnate under the weight of tradition.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the rest of the practitioners adapted, learned to blend in the modern world, ditched those fucking pajamas and got better than the originals.\n\nSo now my mission may be blown because of some short-bus killer who stands out when he should be...\n\nOh... idea time.\n\nFive minutes to go, and I gesture to a coworker. \"Hey... who is that in the bush outside?\"\n\n\"Dude, whatcha been smokin'? Can you, like... oh shit, dude, yer right! There's, like, a guy in that bush!\"\n\nHe points right at Fukunaga. He's speaking so loud that the 4 or 5 guests in the lobby look where he's pointing.\n\nI see Fukunaga startle, then duck his head down into his hood. Probably to bite the cyanide capsule he has sewn into the lining.\n\nJoke's on him. I swapped it for a Nyquil caplet 2 or 3 years ago in Rome, when he tried to cut in on another job. Fucked that up, too, as he got spotted by a **priest**, if you can believe it, who called the Swiss Guard to report a possible attempt on the Pope's life.\n\n(He was kind of close... I was after a cardinal. Took an extra two days with the heightened security.)\n\nFukunaga falls dramatically to the ground to prepare for his \"death throes,\" and I see my target leave the elevator flanked by two rent-a-thugs.\n\nI pull the ink part out of my Bic pen, slide the needle into the barrel, and puff hard into the end, I see a brief glint of light on surgical steel, and the point pokes into the target's neck.\n\nAt the same moment as the victim slaps the needle deeper into his flesh (guaranteeing a painful death 4 hours from now... that's what you get when you rape a congressman's son, you sick Mafia fuck), the gorillas spot Fukunaga failing to spasm in death, and start towards the dumb bastard.\n\nI turn to the coworker. \"Hey, can you take the desk for a second? I have to take a piss.\"\n\n\"Yeah, man... don't you want to see the excitement, though?\"\n\nNo, not really. I want to get as far away from here as I can before that greasy pedo drops dead.\n\n\"No... I'v **really** got to go.\"\n\nAs I leave the desk (never to return... sorry, dude), I see Fukunaga jump to his feet and run like his life depends on it (which it does, given the size of the bodyguards chasing him) and chuckle quietly.\n\nSometimes, tradition **does** come in handy.",

            "comment": "Shinji paced his hotel room, brow furrowed in thought. The International Ninja Cup was a mere day away, and as his feet padded softly on the back and forth on the floor his mind was furiously at work. As Team Captain, he was given a tremendous opportunity - to lead Team Japan against clans from across the globe. But, he bore a heavy weight - it was his responsibility to attempt to redeem Japan after years of shame.\n\nHundreds of years of competition, and each and every result the same - Japan disgracing itself with a last place finish. No matter the advancements in technology, no matter the focus on personal discipline, Japan could not seem to produce ninjas with the skill and talent of other nations. \n\nA soft sigh escaped Shinji's lips as he shook his head for the hundredth time - he must not let his focus slip for even an instant. He must keep his mind sharp, lest one small error lead to his team's downfall. He stepped to the window to take in the beautiful morning view, a small smile crossing his face; yes, as long as he could maintain precise concentration, he would lead Japan out of last place for the first time in recorded history. He was sure of it. \n\nHe turned away to recheck his equipment one more time when a sizzling blur scythed the air beside his head. A shuriken embedded itself with a thud into the wall two inches beside his head, shattering his concentration and sending adrenaline coursing through his veins.\n\nHe leapt to the window, pulling a dagger from his belt, ready to defend himself from this obvious attempt to sabotage his team. However, as his eyes scanned the rooftops and skyline surrounding his hotel room, he could not see any trace of his attacker. He easily spotted Toshi, who was on guard duty. Using ninja hand signals he asked the master ninja if he had seen the failed assassin, but Toshi indicated that he hadn't even noticed the attack. \n\nEnraged, Shinji flew to the wall where the weapon had lodged itself. Prying it loose he noted the 9-pointed maple leaf of its shape, identifying itself undeniably as the work of the Canada Clan. But, for the first time he also noticed the attached note. Retrieving it, he read the words slowly to himself, cheeks reddening as he did.\n\n\"Hello Shinji. Hope all is well. Sorry to bother you, but we are trying to get ready for the big competition tomorrow, and we were wondering if you wouldn't mind keeping down the noise? Between you stomping around your room and blustering loudly to yourself, we're finding it real hard to get anything done. Thanks a lot, and good luck tomorrow eh?\"",

That's what everyone out in the sunlight believes, and we make sure it remains that way to this day.\n\nNinja have been evolving in the 21st century. They're becoming skilled in more than just the arts of stealth and combat. Cyber warfare is huge, and we have all of the data.\n\nRussian, American, British, Mexican, even the North Korean data comes to us, and if we see it fit it gets sent out under the mention of an anonymous tip, or filtered through some politicians.\n\nJapan is the problem child in our great big family. The ninja there have yet to gather ANY useful information from the Japanese government. This is mostly due to them refusing to wear plainclothes and instead dressing in the stereotypical ninja wear that you'd see in movies. Black mask, black clothes, sword on hip, etc.\n\nThe Russian division is insisting we move in soon to take over, because currently Japan is our wildcard. \n\nWe move at daybreak.",

            "comment": "The problem with Japan\u2019s was that they tried to mass produce them. Sure, they got thousands of ninjas, but those guys belonged more in a circus than the battlefield. They could climb walls decently fast? Move around a little silent? Give me a break. The only real difference between them and the standard foot soldier was that they dressed in black onesies. Real ninjas are not so cheap and I promise you, you\u2019ve never heard of a single one.\n\n---\n\nAgent Sarah Romanov had her hands cuffed behind her, her supervisor with his gun twitching on the trigger, pointed directly at her head. And she had thought they had a decent work relationship.\n\n\u201cI assure you, Agent Romanov,\u201d her boss, Agent Kingsley, said. \u201cThis is to protect you.\u201d\n\nSarah flicked her eyes over to the pitch-black end of his pistol. Somewhere along the six levels of security clearance they went through just to arrive in this interrogation room, her boss had lost his mind. No bodyguard had ever pulled their pistol on their mark claiming to protect them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m handcuffed, Jeff.\u201d It was simple and probably didn\u2019t work on a trained CIA operative, but saying people\u2019s first names minimalized their odds of killing you. \u201cDo you really need to point a gun at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is standard protocol for this meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this because of my last name?\u201d Sarah had spent six years as a field agent with no prospects of promotion. She had a good idea why. Performance issues were a good bet, but then she became the best around and nothing changed. Then came the woman angle, but the CIA didn\u2019t really cared for the particular spy, only the intel. At last, she came to the conclusion of her nationality. She was Russian.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d her boss said, but a slight inflection at the start of the word gave him away.\n\nThe door opened and a man in a graphic tank top walked in. He had pink sunglasses and blonde hair with frosted tips. If Sarah had to guess, a frat boy had wandered drunkenly into the wrong building and somehow past the maximum level of US security clearance to arrive here still looking for a spot to piss in. But as soon as he walked in, her boss\u2019s finger tensed on the trigger.\n\n\u201cAgent Romanov,\u201d he said. \u201cMeet codename Derek. He is a secret more well-guarded than what goes on in Area 51. If you ever wonder why the United States is the military might of the world, you\u2019re looking at the reason.\u201d\n\nSarah stared. Medium build. Average height. Healthy weight. There was nothing at all spectacular about this *Codename Derek*.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re as jumpy as ever, Jeff,\u201d Derek said and pulled out the seat across from them. He sat down and plopped his feet on the table between them. \u201cSarah Romanov, you\u2019re hotter in person.\u201d\n\nThe frown on Sarah\u2019s lips deepened. Surely, this was a prank. But her boss\u2019s cheeks hadn\u2019t had any color in them for the past hour now.\n\nDerek leaned forward and wagged a finger in front of him. \u201cYou wanna know why I chose you as my Operator? I like the way you look,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cSo, don\u2019t let it get to your head. Higher ups begged me to pick someone else, to even give their reports and recommendation a glance. But I found you on Facebook and pointed at you and said that\u2019s the one. And here you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m here to babysit you?\u201d Sarah asked. She had only a single experience as an operator and it wasn\u2019t a good one. Her asset had died, quite violently.\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d He got up, grinning. Steel grinded against steel as his chair scraped the ground. \u201cHeard the last one you babysat died. I won\u2019t be dying. Though there\u2019ll be many more opportunities to do so.\u201d And he snapped his finger.\n\nJeff Kingsley yelped and his gun clattered onto the ground. He clutched his chest, groaning. It was a heart attack! Sarah got up out her chair to help, but her hands were still cuffed behind her.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Jeff said, \u201cyou\u2019re my operator. You were supposed to stop me from doing stupid shit like that. To be fair, I injected the kill pill long before you so this one\u2019s not entirely your fault.\u201d\n\nSarah looked around, waiting for the paramedics to come bursting through one of the two doors in the interrogation room. Nobody came. Instead, Jeff just rolled across the ground, his face purple as he began choking.\n\nShe pressed her lips together and knelt down beside him. She slammed her head into his chest and began compressions. It wasn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Derek said, dropping a blue pill onto the ground. \u201cThat\u2019s the antidote. Have him swallow that and he\u2019ll be fine in seconds. Only problem is that I only have one and truthfully, this was going to be your antidote.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cDid I stutter?\u201d\n\nWithout a second thought, Sarah took the pill between her teeth and fed it to her boss. \u201cSwallow,\u201d she told him.\n\nHer boss followed her instruction and immediately the deep purple faded from his face. He stopped rolling around. At last, even his breath returned with a giant gasp. Sarah whipped around toward Derek, glaring at the man, but he only returned her a small smile.\n\n\u201cI suppose I was right to choose you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they told me that I should try thinking for once.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d she growled.\n\n\u201cAn old man with a few parlor tricks up my sleeve. I look forward to working with you.\u201d With a wink, he left.\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for 200+ stories.",

            "comment": "&gt; \tAgent Jormundson walked down hallway leading into the briefing room awaiting what he thought would be a very boring briefing on the Japanese military. Agent Thor \"Hammer\" Jormundson was an old hand at these meetings. Last week it was the Korean Army vs. the North Koreans, and today it was the South Korean allies, the JSDF. He\u2019d heard it all before, even though it was classified, it never meant it was interesting. The CIA had a thing about having a plan for a plan for a plan, and of course never using any of them. This was something that he sort of liked. Jormundson loved his on-the-spot planning, he felt the agency really came alive when he had to think on his feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNot that he was going to do that for the next hour, instead he mentally prepared himself to read more graphs than anyone could remember, and pretend to write notes on goings on in the far east that he couldn\u2019t possibly be less interested in. The Japanese were a stubborn and conservative people, very meticulous; but for someone who\u2019s expertise was in Europe alone: absolutely boring. He walked into the room with a look of absolute boredom that he knew that the adviser was bound to expect. However the room was empty.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJormundsen turned around and looked at the room number, and found he was in the right room, but it was empty, save for the conference table, a large TV, and office chairs that probably cost more than he made in three months. As his eyes came down from the room sign, he saw an older man walking down the hallway flanked with two other men in very unusual uniform, he\u2019d seen many, but these struck him, he\u2019d never quite seen anything like it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJormundsen who\u2019d just sat down brushed himself off as he sat up and reached out for a handshake. \u201cpleasure, I\u2019m Jormundsen, you must be Jeremy Winton?\u201d \n&gt; \n&gt; \tJormundsen was thoroughly thrown off at this point, the two men wore what seemed to be a military uniform, but had what looked like balaclava\u2019s up to their eyes, and small slits like gills alongside their necks, in these slits was some more cloth covered in red, white and blue stripes. On their shoulders were the usual camo United States Flag patches. They were in Military fatigues and seemed eerily quiet, almost as if while walking they were called to attention and floated down the hallway. They entered the room, like ghosts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cPleasure Agent, sit, we have something a little different planned for today. I want you to understand that anything said here goes under the standard guidelines. This Is all Top Secret with repercussions that go beyond your time here in the CIA.\u201d The old Asian man ignored his handshake and sat down closing the door as he entered the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tThe two men at his sides taking other chairs across the table. The first who had brown eyes pulled the power plug of the TV, and sat down. The Blue eyes of the other, burned into the side of Jormundson\u2019s head as he sat down, and continued his stare. Brown eyes seemed tired, and crossed his arms and closed his eyes. He seemed to be listening very intently, he then sat down murmuring \u201cDamn NSA\u201d.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJeremy crossed his hands on the table, speaking with reserve and a steady voice. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought you here today to brief you on a job opportunity, that if accepted will put you in a very small group of interesting individuals.\u201d He gazed at Jormundson who by now seemed thoroughly confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cI don\u2019t remember signing up for a new position, I do however remember that I have a report due on the Japanese Self Defense Force that won\u2019t write itself.\u201d Jormundson had regained his composure and was now getting annoyed at being led through this strangeness. He wanted to get through with it and get writing, so he could get home early for a change.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJeremy continued, uninterested with his irate tablemate\u2019s report, \u201cYou\u2019re a lot like your father, before we poached him from The Swedish Lightning.\u201d He smiled at the puzzled look that immediately flashed across his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cMy father was a postmaster in Duluth, Minnesota until his dying day. So I wouldn\u2019t presume you knew my father.\u201d Jormundson rebutted, offended at the pretense.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tThe old man gave out a small laugh and smiled. \u201cOh I knew old Jormund well, he was the best in class in Sweden, but Sweden doesn\u2019t know war, so Sweden loses it\u2019s best chess pieces.\u201d He put his hand flat on the table towards Jormundson who looked like he was about to get up and walk out. \u201cDid you ever wonder why a postmaster from Duluth would travel to Europe for government business? Did you ever wonder how a postmaster could afford to send his three sons to the most prestigious colleges? And then mysteriously disappear into Huron after a car crash on the Mackinac Bridge?\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \tThis was growing very unsettling for Jormundson who had just began to remember the solemn and quick and quiet funeral that the government had paid for. It was strange, though he said his teary goodbyes, it all felt so fast, almost as if there was no time or money for grieving. He had since grown to accept it since it was nearly twenty years ago now. It revived that wonder he had about why the Postmen always seemed nervous when he asked them what his father\u2019s job was like at the office, since he was never allowed to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cSon, I\u2019m about to tell you something that about a hundred or more, or less, know in United States. We operate a small clandestine unit known as the \u201cLincoln Brigade\u201d.\u201d He stared at Jormundson with a deadly serious look on his face.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJormundson wanted to laugh, but it was strange how serious these three men were being about this subject. To Jormundson the \u201cLincoln Brigade\u201d was a volunteer group of Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and nothing more. \u201cYou mean like the Lincoln Brigade in Spain?\u201d offered Jormundson.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cThis is where things get complicated son.\u201d Jeremy leaned back in his chair, tenting his fingers and then setting them on his arm rests. \u201cIt is the same, and it\u2019s not. We were founded at the behest of Lincoln during the Civil War, had we been there during his assassination we would have had our founder with us a little longer.\u201d He closed his eyes almost as if he was remembering that time himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cThe LB were in Spain, alongside the \u201cLincoln Brigade\u201d some drunk fool found the name from one of our more careless agents and loved it, though we are much older. But we were present there, and helped Franco become what he was, shame he didn\u2019t stay as faithful to us after the war.\u201d The implications of what Jeremy said were beginning to interest Jormundson.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that Franco was a United States plot?\u201d Jormundson said asking the question with all the doubt one could show on ones face.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cYes, when a political situation demands quick satisfaction, or a quick hand is needed to ensure the United States prospers, we can provide a quick answer. We don\u2019t do prolonged struggle, we tip the teetering pyramid in the direction it needs to go.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cSo, you are a bunch of assassins?\u201d Jormundson seemed puzzled by strange interspersed vagueness in a lot of the words. \u201cYou guys are a bunch of Yankee Ninjas?\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cNot ninjas, the Japanese paid dearly and still do for letting that get out. They had them first, but they were merely a prototype. They don\u2019t call them that anymore.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cWhat do they call them now?\u201d Jormundson asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cThe Hyaku, or the One Hundred.\u201d Jeremy said matter-of-factly, and there are many more in the world. \u201cThe Russian Tyeni, and the Chinese YinYing, both have their home in the Russian Revolution, coming from the Tsarist Okhrana. The Germans never believed in them and paid for it at the end of WWII, Hitler didn\u2019t kill himself son. The Tyeni made sure of that.\u201d Jeremy offered each tidbit as though it were a reward for continued interest in the conversation, and Jormundson was biting.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJormundson could hardly believe the things he was hearing, being that they flew in the face of conventional knowledge. He knew a lot that the public didn\u2019t, but this was really left field for even a Secret level CIA conference.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tJeremy continued \u201cThe Indian Svajas face off nearly daily with the Pakistani Uqaab, These Japanese Hyaku face with the South Korean Gonghwadang Geulimja the North Korean Bulg-eun Geulimja, we just call them Gongs and Bulgans for short.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cCommunist Ninjas?\u201d Jormundson asked puzzled by how that sounded.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201cYeah, Communist Ninjas.\u201d Jeremy smiled at the naive question. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an Ideology Jormundson, they are something any country can come up with given enough time.\u201d Jeremy finished the point before he continued on. \u201cNorway has the l\u00f8vers, and Sweden the t\u00e4ndande. L\u00f8ver is Norwegian for Lion, Son.\u201d Brown eyes who has been quiet since his entrance earlier let out a chuckle. Blue eyes blinked, in what Jormundson was sure was the first time he had done so since they got here.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\u201dYour father was the best the t\u00e4ndande ever had, and they paid him well, but it was a boring life in Sweden. I met him in Hong Kong, having just having been released from The Royal Army and her majesty\u2019s service, and recently brough on by the LB in the US. We knew about him, and I approached him with an offer, he took it and moved to Minnesota.\u201d Jeremy began to speak a little less seriously, and seemingly more personal. \u201dHe was a good man, but in the Lincoln Brigade he was involved against the Soviet Tyeni, and got a bit too deep. They evened out the score on Mackinac Bridge twenty years ago.\u201d Jeremy said this so matter of factly, it threw off Jormundson completely again.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Continued-\n&gt; \n&gt; \t",

            "comment": "Ninjacon 2017 was an interesting one. They all were. Ninjas from all over the world in one place.  Holding it in a secret basement of a hotel hosting an anime convention was a stroke of genius.  Those japanese ninjas had been right, to hide a tree: use a forest. But thier time had passed. They did'nt change with the times.\n\nThose who hired them knew how to find them.   The international association of Ninja.   The Australian Ninjas were the best in the world, thier mastery of deadly creatrues and harsh terrain made them the most expensive.    The Japanese ninja had fractured into the traditionalists (what normies think of ninja) and the flashy ones who wore orange.    Nobody ever expected Spanish Ninjas or the Canadian ones (they would apologize as they killed you, often by force feeding you maple syrup and poutine until your stomach burst).  With the new assassins creed games more people expected the Arabic, Italian and even the American Ninjas. \n\nIt was at the secret ninja bar that they would trade stories. \n\"I say olaf, did you see yesterday's episode of Game of Thones?  Cracking show eh Wot! , asked Nigel. Everyone knew about MI 6 and James Bond, but the queen's personal Ninjas were Britians true strength.  \n\nOlaf Magnussen, a blonde bear of a man laughed \"Yes,  I do believe that Ned Stark Fellow will\"\n\nSuddenly a knife appeared in his heart as he crumpled over. A little girl with freckles and red hair glared at him \"fer fook's sake ye daft coont.   Enough with the spoilers.\"    \n\nNigel shook his head distastefuly.  \"Mary, you git! You can't keep doing that. It's bloody inconvientent for the cleaning staff.\"  Irish ninjas. Typical really.   Her face flushed red as she figured out what Nigel was thinking.  \"I'll fite you mate!\"\n\nAt another table  Pierre and Jack were arguing. \n\"ee's impossible, zere is no such thing as Mexican Ninjas,  you've been drinking too much.\"  Pierre argued. \"no one has ever seen one and they never show up. \n\"Nah man.I tell you bro.My uncle got killed by one. They are real Give them a shot of tequila and they like teleport and shit. I know a guy who'd roomate's nephew saw one. \"\n\nLogan wandered over \"sorry to interupt but I could'nt help overhearing.  I heard that one once got elected to office. I forget which one.  But my grandma plays pinochile with a lady who's dentist's former roomate once saw one kill a man with a taco from a mile away. \" Logan wandered off. \n\nPierre looked over at Jack. \"'ave you gotten zose taco trucks on every corner yet.   Jack shook his head \"not yet, leaders say a lot are slow to deliver.   He patted his back pocket to realize his wallet was missing.   \n\"has anyone seen my wallet? He asked. The maid passing by answered \"No. No..\"  thinking to herself \"I take\"\n\n\n",

            "comment": "**The Family...**\n\nThe Family is a secretive group the works with assassins to influence the world. They're a secret program developed by a company, though I don't know which. From what we were taught, it was originally developed to be a private assassination squad that would target key figures from the company's rivals. As time continued on and the world changed, the group expanded its scope of operations. They stopped training their own assassination squads and began blackmailing preexisting assassins...\n\nThe program has changed since that was implemented but not by much...\n\nHow they pick their candidates is unknown, me and my buddy were veterans they picked up. We had done some... less than morally correct things during our service. When The Family approached us, we didn't have much of a choice due to the blackmailing. The job pays good, which is nice, but there's certain drawbacks - as with every job.\n\nThere's a ranking list, over 300 operatives across the globe and all of them in competition with each other. While the murder of fellow operatives is strictly forbidden, the sabotage of missions for others is not. If you get too low on the ranking board, lose your rank, you're *tied* up. No need to support inadequate members in service...\n\nThose lower on the ranking list are sent to Japan for their missions. Lots of people there, lots of escape routes too - the perfect hunting ground of the inexperienced. Unfortunately, when you perform better you get shipped out to other posts in various countries. At least, that's how it use to be until The Family began expanding again. Rather than having independent branches in various territories to blend in, it's began interlinking them - combining them.\n\nThe problem this poses for people like me and others ranked lower on the listings, the more interconnected they are - they less there is a need for operatives in every section. Fewer operative means more heads will role and I and few others might end up on the chopping block...\n\nI need to leave, I can't keep my contacts waiting...",

            "comment": "\"Oh, here *they* come\" the blonde agent said, his English having a slight accent. Scandinavian, probably.\n\nHis face was hidden behind a generic Guy Fawkes mask. White shirt, black tie, black suit, black shoes, black gloves, electronic watch. The other agent turned her head to see. A woman with a big black sunhat and a bland white mask. Black suit, black boots, black gloves, electronic watch.\n\nShe didn't say anything.\n\nFrom everywhere, ninjas appear, in various ninja gear, armed with Howa type 89s and fuckin' samurai swords, they literally started firing at the convention of literal assassins, again.\n\nNo message, just screaming at you from the start. Every few years they track down a gathering, and just charge it. Not even any demands, no envoy - they're never invited anyway. \n\nAlmost everyone at the convention, as if they had been waiting for the moment, snapped into action. Pistols slid out from sleeves, boots and pants all over. Bartenders dove behind the bar, and started throwing assault rifles to the agents. A few odd ones were completely caught off guard, and started freaking out.\n\n\"Holy shit\" an American agent, probably Texan, shouted. Probably his first time. He hadn't reached for cover because of this, and got shot in the jugular, forehead and abdomen. The ninjas, however, had even less who had survived to learn. The agents had taken up defensive positions, and quickly gained superior fire control. The ninjas had come sliding in from ropes as well, and as they got shot they fell, slamming into the floor. Others had made it down, trying to get a foothold by swamping them with dead ninjas falling from the sky, executing agents point blank and slashing them with samurai swords.\n\nAs usual, after a few volleys, most of them had been neutralised. Some had fallen wounded, but killed themselves where capable instead of risking capture. Some carried grenades. And as usual, once most of them were downed ... All over the place, they'd explode themselves as they screamed in defiance.\n\nBody parts, blood, concrete, shrapnell flew around. Meanwhile above, a security team had engaged the second wave of ninjas, not succeeding in preventing them from throwing nades down to the lowest floor. By now, the quickest had made it into the other rooms, where they engaged parts of the second wave. \n\nIn all this, the Scandinavian agent, sat almost paralysed behind the bar, clenching his Glock 17, trying to cover his ears.\n\nHe was surrounded by dead bartenders, as the rest had now fled, as the ground shook and dust flew around. \"F\u00f6rl\u00e5t mig, Herre\" he heaved through his tears, rocking around, his shoulder bleeding heavily. The agent with the bland white mask had lost her black sunhat by now, revealing her dark brown hair and fair complexion.\n\n \"Upp, upp lilla tik\" she screamed as she dragged at his arm \"J\u00e4vla skitt\" as a nade blew half the bar away. \"Upp!\"\n\n\"Jag \u00e4r knullad, de har skjutit mig\" he groaned \n\n\"Jag \u00e4r inte j\u00e4vla blind, tjockskalle, g\u00e5 upp om du inte vill att vi ska d\u00f6, j\u00e4vla\" she screamed right into his face. That got him up, and they stumbled over the bodies into the other room.\n\nI push the button now that only ninjas remain, and gas starts filling the room,  killing them as their circulatory system feels as if its on fire, and their lungs shut down. That's another generation of ninjas we won't have to deal with, I think as I push back against my desk, so I can see the vast myriad of security cameras.\n\nNinja raids gave him a great commission.",

            "comment": "Harry made his way down the long hallway with bated breath. He'd never been called to the big boss' office before, but he had seen others come back from there just to pack up their desk and hand in their badge. Was he headed the same way? His last mission had been a close call, but damn it, he'd made it work. \nAs he wiped his forehead, the door ahead swung open. Harry made the final steps towards it and looked through the open doorway. There was nothing there. No chair, no desk, no people, not even a window. The gut feeling that had saved him from countless deadly situations kicked in once more. He leaned back to read the sign beside the door, but it hadn't changed in the last few seconds. \n\"Detective Harry Blackwell,\" boomed a loud voice from inside the room, startling Harry who instinctively reached for his gun. His hand remained empty, as both holster and gun were safely stowed away at his desk. \n\"Enter,\" the voice dictated.\nHis curiosity got the better of him, and he stepped inside the empty room. As soon as he passed the threshold the door swung shut behind him. \n\"Is this some kind of joke?\" He said out loud. Chief Daniels had been the one to send him down here, but he had less of a sense of humor than a chicken. \n\"This,\" answered the voice, \"is your chance to become more powerful than you ever thought possible. All you have to do, is find me.\" Find who? And in an empty room no less.\n\nWhile listening, Harry had been searching for the source of the voice. It seemed to come from multiple hidden speakers, but it was hard to tell as the sound reverberated off the bare walls. \nThe room was dimly lit by a small lamp hanging from the ceiling. It was too weak to reach the furthest corners so he decided to try his luck there first. Alas, all four corners contained nothing but dust. If this was some sort of mystery room, shouldn't there at least be something, anything\u00a0 to give him a clue? Harry turned back towards the door and discovered a light switch. He flipped it and all was pitch black. However, for the briefest of moments, he saw a narrow beam of light in the far left corner. Or had it been a trick of the mind? \n\nHe turned the lights back on and made his way across the room once more. As before, there was nothing but dust, but that light... had it been there? \n\"What is this shit?\" He asked in frustration. No answer. \nHarry knelt down to examine where the floor and walls joined. As he hovered his fingers over the corner, he felt a breeze of air. Reaching into his back pocket, Harry found his trusted pocket knife. His dad had gifted the knife to him on his 10th birthday and he'd been carrying it around ever since. \nHe unfolded the knife and slid it between the wall and floor. With one wiggle of the blade and an audible click, the two walls came apart in a narrow slit. Harry took one last look behind him, into the dimly lit room, and then pushed the walls completely apart. Behind them was a steep staircase leading downwards into darkness. \n\"Guess I'm doing this, huh.\" He said and stepped down. The stairs were so narrow, he had to take them sideways. The further down he went, the darker it became, till it was pitch black. With his hand on the wall in front of him and careful steps, he made his way down the stairs, till he'd reached the end. \n\"Congratulations.\" Harry jolted in shock at the low whisper, realizing it came from right behind him. \n\"Who's there?\" He asked with hands raised, ready for combat. \n\"Relax,\" the voice said, now coming from straight in front of him. \"I won't hurt you.\" At once, a lamp was lit and Harry could see the owner of the voice: it was a tall man, dressed in a crisp, gray suit. \n\"What is this?\" Harry had never seen this man before and it sure as hell wasn't the big boss. \n\"Well, detective, we've been following your career and it is time that you join our ranks and become a ninja.\"\n\"Fuck you!\" Harry exclaimed. So this was a joke after all. He turned in anger to leave up the stairs, but in a split second, his path was blocked by the stranger. \n\"What the...?\" Harry mumbled. The other man had moved with a pace that simply wasn't possible. \n\"Leave now and your time in the force is over. Stay, and you will learn the ninja ways.\" \n\"Ninja ways? This is the God damn US of A, not Japan. Cut the crap and tell me what's going on.\" As he watched, the tall man seemed to fade from sight until he was no longer visible. \n\"This is what's going on.\" Harry felt chills running down his spine. Had he really just seen a man disappear before his eyes? He reached out to where the man had been and jerked back as he made contact with the unseeable man's body. \n\"What? How is that even possible?\" Harry stuttered, while searching for proof of this thing being a magic trick. Mirrors, string, anything.\n\n\"I'm a ninja,\" said the invisible stranger, \"and you can be one too.\"",

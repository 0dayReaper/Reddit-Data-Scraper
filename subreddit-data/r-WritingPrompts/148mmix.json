            "comment": "As the door opened we all screamed happy birthday as loud as we could. Even behind the mask, I could see Len's eyes widen. Two cowls, and all my hench in full costume, in his apartment? Yeah, I totally get why he was panicking. Cyndthia was already drawing him inside and closing the door. Len was absolutely bewildered as Deady and I approached him.\n\nMy costume made it look like I was a cyborg undead cowboy. Well, it was obviously a high-tech mask, but that didn't change the fact that there was a party horn in my mouth. I blew it once before Deaddy clapped Len's shoulder.\n\n\"41!\" Deaddy laughed as he drew Len over to the couch, forcing the hero to settle down. \"How's it feel to be vanguard for the younger ones?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Len seemed even more confused.\n\nI flopped down next to Len as Bill brought over a slice of cake for the poor guy. \"Len!\" My voice, as always, was a shrill cackle, but so long as the mask was on, I didn't drop character. \"Come on, Len! You invited us! We couldn't come to the party when there might be other capes there!\"\n\nLen was still looking around, half scared and half confused, even as Deaddy forced a beer into his hand. \"I didn't think... you would...\"\n\n\"Listen, man.\" Deaddy handed me a beer before settling down and cracked open his own. \"Some time back, won't tell you when because it might out me, you were doing one of those bullshit school things, trying to teach kids a thing or two. And it stuck. One of my kids saved a life a while after that. My kid. Saving a life. I've never been more proud.\"\n\nBig Deaddy had a fearsome name and appearance, but there was a reason why the two of us got along. Dad at 16, manned up and went full in on helping raise the kid. Two more by 19. Single father by 20. Became a hench to make ends meet; sad when that's legitimately the best way to raise kids by yourself. As Lisa could attest to. He'd been mistaken for a full cowl, which led to him going solo after the whole Shifter Virus thing. Big Deaddy wasn't a big name in the cowl scene, but he was solid and followed the same ethos as I did. If he was going to be a criminal, he was going to be a decent criminal. I'd picked up on his pattern quick, and we'd become good friends. Turns out, he was a dad through and through... even if he looked like he'd be ripping kids apart and eating them.\n\nMeanwhile, Len wasn't just cursed with the short end of the stick when it came to names. He was your typical reservist cape. Always paraded out whenever they needed to show off a cape with not even a gray mark on his record, but that was partially because he had such a low record to start with beyond his lengthy service. Even the traffic cops didn't give him respect, though he was damn good with handling the cleanup between a tangle between capes and cowls. While his main power was creating weak barriers, I always suspected that he had a weak mesmer power that he kept hidden which let him dampen trauma.\n\nIf he did, I couldn't feel it right now. Right now, all I felt was the draining fear and the increasing confusion.\n\nI cackled madly. \"Len, my friend. You put word out in the verified capes-and-cowls forum of the party. You're one of **my** heroes.\" I always played up the fact that this was my city and therefore everything and everyone belonged to me. Part of my gimmick. \"You might not be a glitz and glam hero, but I see what you do for my people.\"\n\n\"More people than you think do,\" Deaddy agreed. \"I bet that party was flooded.\"\n\nLen's head dropped a hair. I felt the self-loathing within him. With this little time near him, I could only get the strong emotions, and I'd need way more time than we'd allotted to dampen them. \"Um... No, nobody came.\"\n\n\"**WHAT??**\" My mask was expressive enough that I was sure that he could see my shock.\n\nBig Deaddy looked at me. \"Azure's out of town, and you know she woulda come.\"\n\nI nodded a little. \"Mart's patrolling the west side tonight, and he always has good things to say about Len. Quast just had that thing in the arroyo with Murderbeam, he's probably going to be laid out for weeks.\"\n\n\"And if he's out, then you know all the patrols are messed up.\" Deaddy frowned as he took a slug of beer. \"Still doesn't explain the independents. At least one of them should have shown up.\" He looked to Len. \"You've done a ton for the independents! I remember that speech you gave the council about their reimbursement.\"\n\n\"NO MATTER!\" I sat up straight. \"You put out the call, and I don't care if the other cowls didn't show up, you are valued enough my good sir to deserve a visit from the best!\"\n\nOkay, I was getting to be a household name but I wasn't on the level of Windrise yet, and Big Deaddy... Well, he would probably be on Windrise's level if he had the slightest shred of ambition beyond getting his kids into college. But you maintain your image, and overwhelming hubris was part of my image.\n\n\"That's right.\" As Big Deaddy talked, I guzzled my beer. Short on time. \"We brought you presents.\"\n\n\"We all did,\" Bill said, gesturing towards the kitchen. My persona was the sort that normally didn't let my hench address capes, but Bill had asked in advance so I was going to allow it. He didn't say why, and I didn't ask. You have to show some respect to your hench or they'll tell the Henchman's Guild that they want a new job. \"We wanted to wait for your Douglas Addams year, but since you put out the invite...\"\n\nBig Deaddy nodded, grinning from ear to ear. \"Most of them are in the kitchen, but, uh... I'll be honest. I got you a bed. I figured on your salary, you couldn't afford a new one, and let's be honest here. You and me? We aren't getting younger. If we want to stay in the game, we need to take care of ourselves. And a good night's sleep is key.\"\n\nI couldn't see Len's eyes, but I could tell a suspicious look even behind the mask. \"And what place did you rob it from?\"\n\nI cackled again. \"That wouldn't be in the spirit of giving a gift to a cape, now would it? Sure, we might have stolen the *money* we used to buy it, but we wouldn't steal the things themselves!\"\n\nDeaddy nodded. \"And we know that you'll probably just report it, conflict of interest and all that, but... If only for one night, you deserve something nice.\"\n\nBill approached, holding out a piece of paper. \"Mine's... a little different. We, uh... We figured out where you live because you kept accidentally tagging it on LiveScribe when you'd do your daily affirmations, and I kinda... found out a thing or two.\" He waited until Len put the untouched cake and beer on the coffee table and took the note. \"It's a bar, yeah, but they do ID checks and let minors in, so there's non-alcoholic stuff if you want. But it's also a pinball arcade, and on Fridays you get 40 plays for free if you're a Verified cape or cowl on SpandexNet. Uh, it's all anonymous, so no outing yourself. But I scouted the place, and it...\"\n\nMy persona didn't smile more than the usual manic grin, but inside I was smiling from ear to ear. This wasn't just a cape, this was Bill's personal hero. I knew Bill well enough to feel the sorrow, pride, and hope washing inside of him. This was... something marvelous to feel in someone else.\n\n\"...It's still small, it's a small group of regulars. Even if they don't know you're a cape or anything, it's going to be real easy for you to make some friends there.\"\n\nBig Deaddy patted Len's shoulder. \"Once you hit 30, it's harder to make new friends. You should go. None of us are going to frequent it, but you deserve a place to hang out.\" He glanced at me, and I nodded. Unlike me, he kept his beer as he stood. \"But, as much as we'd like to do... whatever it is that normal people do at our age at birthday parties, but we have places to be.\"\n\nLen almost panicked as we both stood, and all 12 of my hench made our way towards the door. \"Are you--\"\n\nI stopped him with an over-dramatic gesture with my hand. \"Relax. It's your *birthday*. No crimes from either of us. No, some of Headdy's goons from Trust City are trying to make a move into town. They've gone under your radar, but we aren't letting a group like that into my town. We're going to have a little talk with them--\"\n\n\"With our fists,\" Deaddy clarified.\n\n\"--and make sure that you don't have to deal with a bunch of people who don't mind making use of firebombs. You have yourself a great rest of your evening!\" I hesitated, somehow making it sound like a dramatic pause.\n\n\"And remember. You beat us once. Didn't capture, lost the fight, but we both agreed that you beat us. If that bank heist hadn't been going down, you would have stopped us in our tracks long enough for backup to arrive, and with two on one? With one of them being me?! That's impressive! You've never done anything to ruin your image, and might not have the flash of other capes... but you've probably saved more lives than all of them combined. Take care, my cape, and remember, Strength in Bravery!\" The motto of the local cape office.\n\nLen was still confused as hell as we made our way out, as I teleported us all away. But no matter how it went with Heddy's goons, today was one of the good days. We needed more capes like Len, and Len needed to know that someone, somewhere adored him. Even if it was a couple of cowls and a bunch of hench.\n\nEvery cape deserved that.",

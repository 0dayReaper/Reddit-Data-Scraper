            "comment": "\"You cannot go into combat with that on.\" The man says sternly at a sitting woman, polishing her weapon. The blade of the weapon, about the length of her entire arm, and deeply complex. On the rear of it is a trigger, with a rotating eight-chamber revolving magazine at its end. \"What is that, and where did you find such a godless weapon?\" He says again. The woman glares at him, her piercing blue eyes splitting through his dense veneer of confidence.\n\n\"It's a gunblade... and I found it in a place very, very far from here.\" She replies quietly. \"Can you leave? Like, please? This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I came home today.\" She continues nonchalantly.\n\n\"Not until you tell me why you continue to refuse wearing the armor given to you.\" The man says, his arms crossed as his grumpy expression gives away his disdain.\n\n\"Do you not realize how creepy this is? You're a lesser god. Part of a pantheon. Do you have any idea how people would react if I said \"Oh, yeah, our patron god of war is stalking me because he won't wear the armor he gave me\"?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Pareidos asks flatly. \"Listen, I appreciate the things you've given me and they are useful to varying degrees. However...\" She turns her head towards the several mannequin stands outfitted in increasingly ornate armor from left to right, \"You cannot seriously expect one person to have this much armor and use all of it.\"\n\n\"Well, you're in combat a lot, why wouldn't you replace it often?\" Pareidos asks.\n\n\"I don't get hit! I NEVER get hit.\" She throws her arms up in fury. \"The reason I don't get hit is because I DON'T wear that heavy-ass armor you constantly give me!\" After polishing the blade of her weapon, she takes a whetstone from her worktable and begins to run it along the burr of the weapon. \"Ah, son of a bitch... I ch\u2014\" She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath before turning to Pareidos once again. \"Did you come just to complain or do you have an actual reason for being here?\" She asks calmly.\n\n\"If you don't want the armor, I can take it back, I\u2014\" \n\"No, that's not necessary. I still might use it against something stronger but I don't need it for the things and creatures I fight now. Plus, some of it looks good, I might use it for other sets once I start collecting more Aspects of Illusion.\" She interrupts Pareidos.\n\n\"Wait, what are those supposed to be?\" Pareidos points at the prisms on the woman's worktable.\n\"You don't know what Aspect Prisms are?\" She says. \"Etra, I know full well what the Aspect Prisms are. I just don't know what those grey-ish ones are.\" He responds.\n\n\"Okay, well, Aspects of Illusion can apply the appearance of some objects to the 'form' of another. People mostly use it with armor to look different.\" Etra explains to him. \"Are all of the gods this out of the loop? I swear, you seem to be way behind on the times.\"\n\n\"I have never heard of something so ridiculous. Why would people want to change how their armor looks? Why not just wear a different piece?\" Pareidos asks.\n\n\"Okay, well you know those sick-ass blessings you guys all put on the armor that come from those tournaments and the vendors who run the token exchanges?\" Etra says. Pareidos nods slightly. \"Since those are non-transferrable blessings and enchantments, people change how they look instead of changing gear and their enhancements.\" Etra continues.\n\nPareidos stops for a moment to think. \"That... is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in all my years. And I've been around for-\"\n\"Yes, a long, long, long time. You never fail to remind me that you are a god when you're explaining things to me like I'm a dumb woman.\" Etra chides him, her furrowed eyebrows belying her anger. \"Do you talk to any of the goddesses like this? Or is it just mortal women?\" \n\nPareidos crosses his arms and looks away, his guilt writ plainly upon his face. \"No. I don't, I treat them as my equals, like any decent upstanding deity should.\" Etra lifts one eyebrow at him, unimpressed. \"Sure you do.\"\n\nPareidos grips his fist closed. \"Watch your tone with me.\" He says, a hint of gritted anger hiding within his clenched teeth.\n\n\"You wanna go? I will wipe the floor with you.\" Etra says, her eyes brimming with excitement as she grips the trigger of her gunblade.\n\nPareidos sighs and releases his fists. \"I am far above such a trifling matter as pummeling a mortal in direct combat.\" \nEtra grins and chuckles as she returns to grinding the whetstone against the metal of her weapon. \"Yeah, okay. Try me any time.\"\n\nThe soft patter of feet across the sand can be heard outside. \"Knock knock!\" shouting can be heard from outside Etra's shack. She stands from her chair and walks to the door, swinging it open. \"Hey, Ella! You're late.\" Etra winks at the goddess standing in front of her. \"Psh. Cute outfit, what's up with that?\" She says to Etra. \"You like it? Your colleague here doesn't seem to share our sentiments.\"\n\n\"Ellasechine? What are you doing here?\" Pareidos asks, deeply confounded. \"What? What is he doing here, Hanwynn?\" Ella asks, concerned.\n\"Oh, get this, he keeps giving me armor and gets mad when I don't wear it.\" Etra says sarcastically.\n\"If you're even touched by a weapon with that... what, a set of bandages on your chest? Is that really all you go into combat with on?\" Pareidos' original statement trails off into nonsense.\n\"I'unno, Par. She wears it well. It's cute.\" Ella says confidently.\n\"See? Thank you, El.\" Etra says, almost relieved to have someone taking her side.\n\n\"He's got a crush on you, I bet. I remember this cute young thing he was trying to court centuries ago... What was her name, Lyza or Lysra? Come on, Par, you remember.\" Ella says inquisitively.\n\"Please don't bring that up.\" Pareidos says, embarrassed.\n\"Oh, it was great. Watching him fumble all of his words and fail to say even the most basic phrases.\"\nEtra, listening intently while sharpening her weapon, struggles not to laugh.\n\n\"How's the transmog coming along?\" Ella asks Etra.\n\"Oh, it's fine. I just need a better overcoat or blazer or something to put over the bandages. A long, flowy coat would be nice. Could you find me something like that?\" Etra asks the goddess.\n\"Yeah, I'll keep my eyes out. I could also ask Venneha to throw you something together.\" Ella replies cheerily.\n\"Ugh. I'd love you for that if you could\" Etra says, her voice strained with appreciation.\n\n\"This is nonsense. I'm leaving now.\" Pareidos says, frustrated and disheartened.\n\"Bye, Par!! See you back on Mount Alykris!\"\nHe says nothing while walking away.\n\n\"Can you believe he doesn't know what Aspects of Illusion are?\" Etra asks in sheer contempt.\n\n\"Yeah, I believe it. He does nothing except watch great battles happen on repeat with the Scrying Pool.\" Ella says, significant snark in her tone.   \n\"Seriously?\"   \n\"That and he's constantly watching that blacksmith lady make those new weapons that can throw stuff really fast.\"   \n\"He likes guns?\"    \n\"That's what those are called?\"   \n\"I'll have to take you sometime. Her name is Miriam, she makes great clothes too. I need something to eat, I was absolutely about to fight Pareidos because he was being so damn annoying.\"   \n\"That doesn't surprise me. You could wipe the floor with him, you look so much better than him when you fight too.\"   \n\"Find me that longcoat. I need it\" Etra says, sliding the gunblade into her sheath on her back.",

Secondly, gangs are cool dude you should try to join or something because they\u2019re very morally correct and cool. Plus they only do it because they are poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, what do you mean \u2018we\u2019?\u201d said the civilian in a very worried tone\n\n\u201cOkay why did one word i said at the beginning of a 32 word long paragraph catch your eye over the important things?\u201d said the fantasy dude who is secretly gang affiliated \u201cAlso I didn\u2019t say \u2018we\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe civilian was stunned \u201cOkay, whoa, wait, how did you know that paragraph was 32 words long, and what\u2019s a paragraph?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay fucker!  I guessed how many words were in the paragraph, and if you don\u2019t start wearing the right colors fast i\u2019m gonna kill you!\u201d said the man who was secretly gang affiliated \n\nThe civilian said \u201cYou claim to be moral, but if you\u2019re moral then what isn\u2019t? The both of us are poor, yet you choose to make money at the expense of others. I understand that you are suffering but if i can survive happy and poor than so can you simply because you don\u2019t have to be alone, and your gang proves that, but there are definitely better people to receive help from. I just firmly believe that being poor is not an excuse to hurt others.\u201d\n\nThere was a sparkle in the secretly gang affiliated fantasy dude\u2019s eyes\n\n\u2026because of glitter magic\n\nbut also because he saw hope.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a gang.\u201d said the secretly gang affiliated fantasy dude\n\nAuthors note: I don\u2019t sleep.",

            "comment": "It was the worst nightmare in history of the day.  The day where the gods give your blacksmith great metals to make great armor but they were in the wrong size.  \u201cIs this for someone else?\u201d  \n\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am these are especially made for you.\u201d\n\nStill some faith in your blacksmith you place the armor above your head and drop it down to the ground.  You were hoping it would touch you but it fell around you as if a barrel fell straight down.  The so called godly armor cracked and split into several pieces.  All you could imagine was that a enemy wouldn\u2019t even need to look carefully for any weak spots because there is no strong points to begin with.  But what did you expect from a blacksmith who was still in training, his manager was out of town and the blacksmith was blind.\n\n\u201cLook the king paid a high price of-\u201c\n\n\u201cDid you break the sacred armor?  How did yo-\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made of the cheapest material possible the actual question should be how I manage to keep it safe for so long.  Now where is the armor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s the problem with people nowadays they think that because you paid for a product you are entitled to the product.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to get the armor or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay okay but I would need some more godly armor.\u201d\n\nFrustrated you go the king and with permission go to the ends of the earth to find the material.  You found friends and enemies who would change your life forever.  Finally a dragon was the last thing which stood in your way and refused to give you his material.  What this dragon didn\u2019t realize was that he was no match for a knight who had been all over developing experience and all he had done was stare at his gold collection.  After defeating the corrupting dragon and heading home with your bounty you are horrified.  More horrified than the end of the world as we knew it would bring to you.  The blacksmith was still in business and what was worse it had merged with a new store called Starbucks.  Buying a \u201creasonable\u201d price for coffee you go to the blind blacksmith and gave him the materials. \u201cWhat took you so long?  I actually made a mistake as I misplaced the materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026had them the whole\u2026TIME!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prompt implied it so here is your armor.  Free of charge.\u201d  THE END",

It\u2019s about public image. It\u2019s about retirement, at the end of the day. Reloj will never retire. She\u2019ll fight until she dies, and if that\u2019s what she wants, good for her.

Why are you a goblin, doing whatever it is goblins spend their time doing?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe goblin shot me an angry stare.\n\n\u201cMy mom and pa were goblins.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cExactly! And my mom and dad were heroes. Both quite unknown, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d never heard their names. You ask why I chose? I didn\u2019t choose anymore than the average suburbanite chooses to go to college. I was young. I listened to my mom and dad. I filled out my own applications to the hero universities, sure, but did I really choose?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t choose anymore than you chose to have green skin and eat rats or whatever for a living.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not eat rats for a living.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cI know, I just mean whatever similar thing you do for money. What is it? Collect swamp muck? Eat squirrels, maybe? Trick stupid humans or other goblins?\u201d I asked. \u201cStop me when I get it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a doctor.\u201d He said. \u201cFor goblins, humans, all beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a veterinarian, kind of.\u201d I said.\n\nFor the first time, he cracked a wry grin.\n\n\u201cWell, hero, you do seem quite an\u2026 animal.\u201d",

But no one ever tells citizens nor young children that once you become a hero, kindness was not the thing you'll truly need.\n\nMuch like those young children, public image had persuade his perception of a so-called hero. Such is his dream of being a hero that could save all. But moments after the death of his friend, his comrade, the one who dreamt alongside him get killed in one of the most brutal death he'd ever witness. With not one acknowledging such an honorable death, he felt tired, tired of every stupid image heroes showed off. \n\nAnd so as the young hero who had gained power over the course of years, saved many in the name of his friend, finally reach the summit. He realized, that it was never about kindness and genuine desire to help, but those who had a great impression in front of the public. \n\nAnd so, he changed his goal. Honoring what he felt like his friend would want. Focusing on impressing the public eye, as it was no problem for him no longer. As with status like his, anyone could careless about protection. Adding that with his non-existent will to live, it was the perfect combo, or so he believes.\n\n\"I suppose that's one way to think of a hero, but he definitely got his mind corrupted to think like that.\" One of my comrade stated, while looking at the ice surrounding us.\n\nThe hero truly had quite the innocent mind, seeing as such a realization just hit him after situations weren't in his favor. \"So how come this book got created, I know some of 'em get inspired by the actual heroes and all that\", another comrade of mine, Sydney, asked.\n\n\"Hm, theres this footnote at the beginning. Let me see...\"\n\nI once asked a hero for a school project years ago how come he chose aestetically(??) pleasing armor over the ones he receive from greater power. He just looked above and told a similar story.\n\nI honestly got confused, and as I realized he was talking about himself, but when I looked back he was no longer around. So I could not ask anymore details, such is the reasoning this book is just based on real life.\n\n\"Odd,\" Sydney replied, before thinking that she had read of something similar about such a hero. But she supposed it was nothing but a coincidence.\n\n(I kinda went off the rail there, didn't really know how to end this\u2013)",

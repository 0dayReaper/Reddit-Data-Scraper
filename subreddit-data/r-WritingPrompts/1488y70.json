            "comment": "This short ended up being completely, totally removed from the prompt, and pretty damned silly, but seeing as this is my first response, umm, *ever* on this site, I feel I need to at least drop this in here:\n\n\n\n\nThe time had come for the harvest, but for an hour that day, no one was at all doing their jobs. They'd all abandoned their post, instead staring in awe at the massive *thing* that had just invaded their corn field.\n\nThe crowd gathered in a mass, curious human faces twisted in morbid fascination. Some simply stood there, some remarked to themselves in awe, some reached out, some picked up cameras; There were 12 of them now, and Gaia moved not, crouching deep in the corn-field with a transfixed stare in her radiant eyes.\n\nGaia. Mother Earth.\n\nBut none of them would've known that from looking at her.\n\nShe was, to put it lightly, a monolith. Even while crouching, she stood a proud twelve feet high, most of the tall plants coming up to her waist while she knelt down. Elaborate, golden... *structures* (nobody in the crowd could figure out what they were. Spires, perhaps?) protuded from most of her body, going up to her shoulders and curling outwards in a grand, majestic, *welcoming* reach like out-stretched arms; it was recognizable to most of the intrigued passerby as gold, yet its color seemed to shift at different angles in a near-majestic display. It extended, they soon found, from what seemed to be an equally grand suit of gold, plated armor, intriate carvings and symbols adorning its sides with ne'er a scuff in sight as it shone dilligently in the mid-morning sun. Swaying gently side-to-side in the cool breeze, her golden hair reached all the way down to her ankles, cascading down her sides in many braids, each adorned with beads of yet *more* gold.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight, and they could only watch.\n\nThe farmers and passerby expected *something* to happen, but nothing did; the colossus just stood there in the field, as if somehow entranced, immersed in... something. After about thirty minutes or so, a rather brave farmer gave her a gentle tap on the ankle, but, aside from a brief, curious gaze in his direction, she paid him little mind.\n\nWhat the farmers didn't see, though, was her face. Though she indeed looked transfixed, *confused* even, they couldn't see just *what* she was focusing on.\nFor, as the towering force of nature crouched down there in the field of corn, she stared in awe. In awe, with wide, radiant eyes as she focused at some marvel down in the field. \nBut lo, the farmers would not understand why, that day, on the first hour since she'd been standing there, she began to cry... for there, she marveled at a single ear of corn.\n\nA minute later, her hands reached out and gently stroked the plant, her tears then drying as the first graceful words escaped her lips.\n\n\"It's so\u2026 *big*.\"\n\nFeedback, of course, is absolutely welcome, and encouraged, as I\u2019m pretty new to this.",

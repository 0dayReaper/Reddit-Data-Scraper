            "comment": "Pride.\n\nEcstasy.\n\nJubilation.\n\nExhilaration.\n\nNone of those words could even come a trillion miles close to what I was feeling as I held Alexis in my arms, my beautiful, stupid wife smirking as if she hadn't been halfway to heaven during the process. The only word that could ever dream of seeing my emotions on the horizon is rapture, because this truly is akin to a religious experience. I saw the devil of my own negativity trying to strangle me, hands around my throat as it told me that Beatrice wouldn't make it, that my wonderful daughter wouldn't make it, that I would be a killer of three and all because I was a coward who couldn't say \"No\" and liquid nitrogen was in my blood and ice was in my bones and it felt as if the weight of every sin since Cain first felt envy was doing it's best to crush me-\n\nBut everything is fine. Alexis is sleeping in my arms, as fragile as the peace in my heart. Beatrice, the wild glass goddess she is, is trying to get up out of her bed as if she hadn't just experience one of God's greatest trials. And I... I feel at once with the maker. Whatever name it wishes to take, I feel at one with them. Holding this new life in my arms, I now know that past me was a fucking retard with aspergers who could not ever dream of what this would be like.\n\nHuh. I gently pass over Alexis to Beatrice once again and slowly sit down, arm visibly shaking. It feels as if the world has stopped from how hyper aware I feel. Judging from the growing darkness in the corner, I definitely need to take a rest. It was only when I hallucinated a ethereal, glowing white figure stepping out from that darkness that I really started worrying over my mental state. The figure - an angel? - was trying to have a stoic expression but I could feel the fear, the concern, **the guilt** etched deep within. The worry turned into fear as I turned over to my wonderful wife, who also sees it. We.... We died?\n\nboth of us?\n\n\"Be not afr- er, wait, that's at least a millennia out of date... Uh... I come in peace!\"\n\nAfter witnessing the presumed-angel not only almost make the meme true, but also say the alien catchphrase, I slid deep into my chair as I could feel the sanity drain from my ears. Beatrice, God bless her, did not try to make some stupid, snarky comment or try to get up to beat an angel for ruining what little peace of mind I had left. However, the silence was far more concerning as she covered the child's face from the light.\n\nA stupid ice-breaker floated out of my mind and out through the mouth.\n\n\"Hah.... N-not exactly how I expected to end up seeing an angel today....\"\n\nThe both of them couldn't help but laugh, Beatrice lightly coughing and the angel sadly smiling afterwards. Hah. I made an angel laugh. I guess I really am a genius, at least comedically. The anger drew breath, no doubt to ring the bell and guide us to awaits, be it heaven or hell.\n\n\"Clark and Beatrice Zhang. Congratulations on the birth of your child. Were it up to me, I would be here only to celebrate the greatest of miracles that you two have experienced. Unfortunately... I am here on the will of Providence.\"\n\n\"I'll go.\"\n\nThe angel's head snapped to Beatrice.\n\n\"I know I shouldn't have survived this. Anemia alone would've made things difficult, but that isn't even including the little cuts I get every day slowly draining what little I've had. I know my time has come, and I will go peacefully, but let me say goodbye.\"\n\nI could feel that cold grip around my heart once more before the angel, merciful and glorious in equal measure, shook their head.\n\n\"No, miss Zhang. Your time is far. Unfortunately, it is not for you I have come for... There is a prophecy.\"\n\nBeatrice is confused. I wish I was as in the dark as her, but I am an avid fan of games and anime. This setup reeks of a call to action. If I am to go to war against the world, so be it, but leave my family out of it. Under the withering brutality of my glare, the angel clears their throat.\n\n\"There are supernatural forces in the world, as my presence here clarifies. Most malicious and ill-willed supernatural entities all either spawn from or are corrupted by The Dragger. However, it is prophesied that one day, a brilliant, hardy, but most importantly compassionate person will be born one day who will manage to bring them down.\"\n\nAs a spark of unbelieving hate flare to life in my chest, the angel takes a shuddering breath. Whether I have broken an agent of God through sheer contempt, or if they truly are broken by damning a newborn to fighting monsters, I know not. But it had better be the latter. They rummage through a satchel, pulling out what looks like a phone, yet looks older than a Nokia and is colored like a ragged piece of parchment.\n\nAnd the name written on it is the final nail in my composure's coffin.\n\n\"I am sorry, but according to the Akashic Record, Alexis Zhang is the he-\"\n\n\"Fuck off.\"\n\nBea, who had by this point seemingly been understandably resigned to follow the fate of the world, recoiled at the yet-unseen venom in those two words. The angel has begun to cry, removing all doubt that the angel truly is sorry and just knows no other future.\n\n\"I- I'm sorry. There is no other way-\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\"L-Lark, honey-\"\n\n\"No. Bea, I am not going to let Odin, Zeus, Demiurge, Karma, Amun Ra, or even Record Scratch McFucking Godhead himself raise our fucking child into being a soldier.\"\n\nAll the energy had left me body at this point. Luckily, wrath makes a good replacement in a pinch, and as I stood up I realized this was a fucking vice grip on my throat. I walked over to the angel, wanting to shove my fist through it's head but knowing what I must do is far different. Instead, I simply held out my hand, to everyone's confusion.\n\n\"So, what is her birthright? Some kind of sword, or a shield? A scepter or rod? Or is it an injection of magic?\"\n\n\"N-no, sir... It's j-just this.\"\n\nThey rummaged through their satchel once again, pulling out a weathered, massive tome.\n\n\"I-it's a grimoire, of all the magical knowledge of all the non-malicious races. A-are you?...\"\n\nI took the book, straining to hold with one hand.\n\n\"Yes. I am going to break fate.\"\n\nWith that, I snatched the damn phone and smashed it with the book, shattering it against the wall as I swung at it with a swat that'd make Babe Ruth proud. Everyone was shocked, and the angel seemed to go pale, muttering...\n\n*\"oh lord above that's my pay for the next month gone...\"*\n\nSitting back in my chair, I immediately began paging through the book. I did not have time to waste. My life was measured, and I have a fucking deadline.\n\n\"...Clark?\"\n\nMy eyes lifted.\n\n\"...Thank you. This was not a good fate.\"\n\n...\n\n\"It was destiny for me to kill it.\"",

This doesn\u2019t mean she has to fight now. \n\n\u201cThe Darkness will abide by the terms of the prophecy and hold the attack until the champion is ready, but the champion has been borne unto this realm, the Darkness knows and the prophecy has to be fulfilled. There is nothing I can do, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou bastard! You CHOSE her name! You KNEW this would happen and said FUCKING NOTHING! You and your fucking prophecy can take a long walk off a short pier. You think your \u2018Darkness\u2019 is a threat, you haven\u2019t even begun to feel fear.\u201d She seethed at him and felt her rage manifesting redness in her vision. \n\nHe started to fall to the side, blood leaking from his eyes, his ears, his nose, and finally his mouth. \n\n\u201cHow??\u201d He cried in disbelief, collapsing to the floor. \n\nShe slowly extended to her full height, letting her light come through. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only mystic hiding in this realm, and you just picked the wrong mother to threaten. The light mystics hadn\u2019t had a child survive birth in more than a millennia, I came here in the hopes of keeping our species going. \n\n\u201cThat baby girl in that bassinet is the blending of the light and dark fae the prophecy indeed foretold, but she is so much more than your precious champion, she is the strongest being born in all the realms. She will be able to destroy the Darkness with little effort once she is strong enough to claim her power, as well as her weak and dishonest father.\n\n\u201cIf you had just told me what you were and what you were planning, I could have helped you, *we* could have faced this together. But you used me, you used *US*! What if I had been a mortal human woman?? Are you saying you brought this child into the world to be raised for SLAUGHTER?? \n\nShe raised her left hand, showing her finger as pure light and pointed at him. \n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to need my help! The Darkness is not what you think! Please do\u2014\u201c he stopped as he could no longer draw breath. \n\n\u201cYou lost any right to demand anything the moment you set our child on this path. She is mine and *we* will defeat the Darkness together, and permanently. And we don\u2019t need you to do so.\u201d \n\nThe ice in her voice was otherworldly and literally chilled the room. The little baby girl Alestra\u2019s breath was visible, stopping Aurora in her tracks, bringing the room back to normal. Sacre gasped in relief as her rage ebbed. \n\n\u201cYou have blood of the dark realm in you now too, from carrying her. You *do* need me. As much as you may hate me now, you still need me. You can\u2019t do this without me. You can try to fight fate as much as you want, but this is what it is.\u201d Sacre said tentatively, trying not to draw Aurora\u2019s rage again. \n\nAurora realized he was right, and hated him even more for it. \n\n\u201cYou will pay for this, I promise you, Sacre. Not now, but once the Darkness is defeated, you are next. That is my promise to you.\u201d Aurora whispered menacingly. \n\n\u201cOf that Aurora, I have no doubt. Until then.\u201d Sacre said resigned. \n\nAlestra gently cried, prompting Aurora to go and pick her up. Together they all walked out of the hospital room and towards destiny. \n\nEdit: Thank you for the award!",

That's my kid, dammit. You can't force her to be your warrior.\"\n\nAdonis stared at the mortal with nothing short of pity, the shreds of the book flying about the wind and down the mountain.\n\n\"I am sorry, Simeon.\" The god put out his hands, and the book was simply there, as though nothing had ever happened.\n\n\"No. No, no-no...\" He turned and frantically searched the snow for some sign, evidence of its passage, the pages, but- \"No. I...I just...\" The man fell to his knees as hot tears began to form on his face.\n\n\"Do you think I have not tried, Simeon?\" A hand pressed to his shoulder. \"I do not want children to fight my wars. I do not want wars to begin with.\" \n\nSimeon look up at Adonis' face, somehow believing that perhaps it is true.\n\n\"So what can we do?\" Adonis smiled.\n\n\"Well if you had let me finish in the first place, I would have told you sooner...\" The deity looked up towards the gloomy sky. \"The book of prophecy is final and cannot be broken, but it has loopholes.\"\n\n\"Loopholes?\"\n\n\"Ways around things, to keep her out of danger, make her stronger. I cannot give you all the answers, but I can give you the book, to guide you.\" Simeon pulled himself shakily to his feet as he tried to process everything.\n\n\"So...she must fight for you, but...\"\n\n\"Well, she may not really have to fight at all.\" The god shrugged. \"It depends on your point of view. I wish I could just tell you everything, but if I did, then... well I've seen it happen before.\"\n\n\"What happen?\"\n\n\"Penalties, not very pleasant. For breaking the rules.\" Simeon furrowed his brow, and Adonis laughed. \"Don't worry too much about it. You have other thing to...\" A flash of light amd a crack of thunder halted his words. \"Looks like our time is up.\" The book was hastily thrust into Simeon's hands. \n\nThe mortal was confused, scared as the calloused hands of the god took him by the shoulders and pushed him down the mountain.",

So you can take your supposed godhood, your prophecies, your destinies, and shove them up your ass.\"\n\nThe powerful being rose to his full height, towering over the mortal in front of him. \"Don't you understand? The forces of evil MUST be stopped!\" \"Then stop them yourself. You said you're a god, why do you need a 9 year old to fight your battles?\"\n\n\"There are rules, even for Gods!

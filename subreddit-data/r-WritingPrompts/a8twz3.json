            "comment": "It was seeing his own reflection in the blood, as it pooled over the faux-wood linoleum, that triggered the memory. As Henry examined the slick red version of his face. For that moment, he was ten again, tearing open wrapping paper, a young mind full of excitement and possibilities.\n\nNot a middle aged man who'd just murdered his wife during an argument, bringing it to an abrupt close.\n\nAnother argument, but the same as always. \"You're lazy. Why won't you get a real job?\" and the one that stretched the elastic band back until it snapped, \"I'm leaving you.\"\n\n&gt; *\"Wow, mom! How'd you get it? Tom says these things are sold out everywhere!\" His mom replied, but she'd already become a hazy background buzz, as excited fingers grappled with smooth red plastic, pulling it down over his head. A swoosh in his ears as the menu opened.*\n\nFrying pan had hit skull. Skull had hit floor. Regret had hit Henry almost as hard and at least as fast. Now though, staring at the glossy reflection, it all made sense.  \n\nHis grey life, devoid of color. The nights -- and days -- wasted drinking or binging Netflix. The opportunities untaken, untested, that he'd dismissed with a wave of his hand, because, of course, there would always be more. \n\nAnd now this. \n\n&gt; *The choices were limited. Explore a city. A boat down the Nile. Excitement was already draining away and the thought of Lego growing more enticing.*\n\nThese weren't the lucid sensible decisions of someone living life knowing that this was their very only shot at it. They were the choices - mistakes - of someone who knew it was all fake. A game. One of many attempts.\n\nHis world was a construction of imagination.\n\nSomehow, he'd just forgotten.\n\nUntil now.\n\nHe crouched down and ran his hand through the blood, bringing two fingers to his face, painting the memory of the VR unit over his eyes.\n\nThere. \n\nNow he was ready.\n\n\"Goodbye Marie. Maybe we'll do this again, sometime. But better, you know? Let's be real, I was always meant for better things.\"\n\nIt was a relief. A crushing weight lifted. Not just of the murder -- this life been pressing down on him since long before.\n\nHe strode purposefully into the kitchen, the first scent of hope drifting up his nose since... Since when? Since the wedding? Or, since that day when he was ten years old. \n\nHe grabbed a knife from a drawer. \n\nThe VR unit wouldn't come off easily. He'd have to pry it off his eyes.\n\n&gt; *\"Done already, sweetie? Did you have fun?\"*\n\n&gt; He hadn't. The VR city had made him feel sick. And it was boring, anyway. He'd never end up in such a grey world. He had pulled the device off his head and shrugged dismissively. \"It was okay.\" \n\n&gt; \"Maybe you should give it more of a chance?\"\n\n&gt; He rolled his eyes. Why bother? There would always be other play-things, other chances. He dropped down to his knees and grabbed the next present. Maybe there would be Lego.",

And I was kinda looking at it from outside as I watched the thoughts pass by. The way I imagined it was from a perspective of slowly losing touch with reality, because you were in accident or something similar, and your brain would just sort of make everything alright for you, and it would turn smaller things to more colorful rainbow like experiences, and as you slowly lose more and more of your mind, everything will be fine to you always, because your brain somehow compensates with sort of inner actions, stories and imagination. From the outsiders perspective though, they'll slowly watch you turn into a vegetable.\n\nI'm not sure if this actually makes any sense to anyone, it's sort of difficult to experience and I haven't quite wrapped my mind around whether I think it's a good and beautiful thought or terribly sad.",

It's actually quite liberating coming out of a psychosis, the world is suddenly not that scary and you start to realize in many ways everyone's living a life theyre imagining for themselves, with their own self imposed imagined limitations. The only difference between you and them is you're no longer able to deny that your life is guided entirely by perception. Embracing that knowledge is one of the most powerful things you can do, because it allows you to change your circumstances in life with just a change in perspective, and once you've gone crazy once, it's very easy to stop taking your deeply held perspective and those of others so seriously.",

It's possible that they just wrote a novel with a futuristic space setting and they didn't build themes by extrapolating current trends into the future, but I don't think it's likely. They'd almost have to avoid doing that if they're writing about the future",

For example, more intellect, more luck, more strenght, longer lifespan, place of birth (for example a first world country), what kind of parents you will have, etc. Though these are mainly chance modifiers, like there is one girl who was one of the top players but lost all her credits when the life she planned ended in \"Dead on being born\". \n\nIt also made for quite some interesting situations where the best friend of one character may have been his father in one of the lives, or the main character finds a book he himself has written in a previous life.

After a blind stumble (what used to be a confident strut, mind you) to the bathroom and a piss, the robe comes on and I make my way downstairs to my waiting wife. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's already dressed. She wears less makeup now than she did when she was 30, and is lovelier for it. She aged better than me as a result of vigorous diet and exercise, something I could never quite get behind. She smiles at me like she doesn't see the stubborn sack of fat that settled between my hips in my early 40's, and I'm grateful for it. \"What would you like to do today?\" she asks, hopping more nimbly than I could dream to from her wooden stool. My hand moves to my throat- a reflexive response to being put on the spot. I act as if I have an itch and scratch into a few days' worth of stubble. \"Ah...\" I say, hesitant. The truth is at this age birthdays are a reminder that you are speeding toward death. Time moves faster. My body decays more rapidly. Even as I stand here, now affectionately rubbing my wife's back, there's dull pain in most of my joints. I want to stay home and have a quiet dinner with her and put on a television program. I know that my wife would consider this selfish and is constantly on my case to make myself more available to our children and grandchildren. My lips purse while I'm getting my raisin bran and she can't see. \"What about a little family dinner at Katie's place?\" I say, referring to our second child's home. Bea, my wife, smiles, and for a moment I forget my aching body. \"That sounds wonderful,\" she says, and I know that she's been planning it all along. In moments she's kissing me on the cheek, gathering her things, and is out the door with a \"Call if you need anything, I'm going to help her set up!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n There's nothing left to do but chuckle, shake my head, and eat my breakfast. With a few moments of peace I have time to get some chores done I've been putting off for a while. I fix a door latch. Replace the filter on the kitchen sink. Trim the dog's nails. When you're young you don't think of the maintenance required for your dreams. In your mind you see a picket fence that always stays white, a wife that always stays happy, dogs that stay happy and young. You are quickly disabused of these notions. Eventually you are trapped by your dreams, and wonder if they were worthy goals all along. \"Did I really want three children?\" you ask yourself, thinking perhaps of the daughter you can't talk to or the son that sneers when he sees you. I wonder to myself, even now, if this is the life I really wanted. The bitterness has increased exponentially over the last couple of decades. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I get dressed for dinner and make my way to my daughter's house. My firstborn had always been a loner. Even now he lives in a big city far from our rural outcropping in an apartment alone. Whatever clever doodad I have now sometimes shows me a picture of him, usually alone, usually a drink in his hand, staring peacefully out over some ocean. My daughter, however, immediately wanted a family. She barely made it through college before she found The One, and married him six months after graduation. She wasted no time at all getting pregnant, but by the time the second child came along we could tell that while she had grand ambitions for supporting them, she might need a little help. Our third daughter, having gone to school and then immediately into a graduate program, was out of the picture and unlikely to move back home, so we switched homes with our daughter, son in law, and their children. We took their modest condo and they took the sprawling Victorian I had inherited from my parents. The self-driving car ambled slowly along the drive, but every meter we passed made me more tense in my seat. Car after car lined the drive. Some I recognized, family and close friends, but even more I could only hazard a guess at. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShaken, I was deposited on the wraparound porch, my heart pounding rapidly. Acting more bravely than I felt, I flung the front door open and was greeted by the whooping and well wishing of every colleague, friend, family member, and associate I had made in my life. Eventually my eyes found my wife, still a stone-cold knockout in a floor-length black dress. I offered a playful scowl and she laughed, the sound filling the large foyer and dining area the party was being held in. Despite the deep introversion I have maintaned over my life, I still managed to accumulate a lot of people whom I can spend a pleasurable evening mingling with. The wine flowed, the appetizers served were all my favorites, I was a little perplexed not to see a cake, especially considering it was my birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll wonderful parties eventually achieve a natural \"lull\" in conversation and enchantment. The trick is to end them here before everyone becomes tired and impatient. The evening reached that point without candles or an embarrassing song, and I was grateful. Sensing the lull, my daughter appeared as if by magic and shot me a sly smile. \"Everyone, thank you for coming. This has been a wonderful party for a wonderful man. We've had the luck of 80 years of getting to know him, here's hoping for 80 more!\" she cheered, leading a toast with champagne handed to her by a deft waiter. \"If everyone could join me in the kitchen I have time for one last surprise.\" she said, grinning like a fool now. She ushered us all into the kitchen, a tight squeeze despite the generous space, and eventually I made my way to the center of the gasps and \"awwws.\" I clutched my throat, stunned, mentally the years and decades melting away. \n\n\t\n\nOn a small white table, one familiar to me as my own hands, was a cake and a photograph. The photograph was me, 70 years earlier, a cake identical to the one sitting on this very same table was visible. I swallowed hard, the memories of that party hitting me like an icy wave. My friends were there... My mama... I had begged for... god damn it, what was the gift? I wrack my brain as I take a seat at the table, the very same square foot I had occupied on the same day 70 years ago... \"Where did you find this table?\" I asked, trying to act normal while my mind was spinning. My daughter doesn't hear me, there's a flurry of activity, the song we all know, laughing, clapping, an artificial smile plastered on my face. The second I let my mind focus briefly on the song I remember. I remember the gift I had begged for... It was a new thing. Better virtual reality. You were supposed to be able to hardly feel them and the graphics were supposed to be hyper realistic. I start to laugh. Hysterical, manic laughter. I'm crying now, too, crying because I know the choice I have to make. Do I leave them? Do I get another chance? Everyone starts to look at me, and I start to scream. My gnarled, aged, fingers move up, how could I not have noticed this before now... how long have I been ignoring this pressure on my eyes and temples? I rip the glasses off and throw them across the room where they shatter on impact on the same sturdy wooden counter top that had just been obstructed by a room full of people. I look down at my hands, finding them fleshy pink and small, then up at the kitchen now empty, save for my mother and father. ",

            "comment": "***That's impossible***\n\nThe thought entered my mind and it would not leave. I mean, there's no way right? I forget a few things here and there. Where I left my keys, my phone, or a small object. I forget to tell people something every so often. I also forget why I entered a room occasionally.\n\nBut I *do not* forget to take off a VR headset for 15 years. That's just... impossible. Yet, I racked my brain and could not for the life of remember taking it off, putting in my bottom drawer with all my other old or boring toys, or even ever seeing it again.\n\n*Maybe mom took it off when I fell asleep or something.* No. She always used to have to take off my glasses and would always leave them on my table. My glasses, or a hat I left on, or my phone, or even a sucker I left in my mouth. They were always left on the table.\n\nOkay, I'll go through the day from the start. It was a memorable day after all. First, I remember waking up while it was still dark outside so I decided to wait for the sun to come up.\n\nI sat at my window looking outside. As the soft blue glow started to envelop the sky I grew more and more excited. \"I'm 10 now!\" I whispered to myself. I continued watching. It felt like forever before anything too much changed. \"This is so boring.\"\n\nThe moment the first glimpse of the top of the sun appeared I leapt out of bed. I raced up the stairs and into the kitchen. While screaming. \"MOM!!! DAD!! WAKE UP, IT MY BIRTHD-\" suddenly my feet flew out from under me.\n\n**THWAK**\n\nMy face hurt. Like a lot. I started to feel my throat tighten and thought to myself, *come on. Dont cry, you're not a baby anymore* my dad came rushing around the corner to see me balled up on the floor covering my nose with tears forming in my eyes.\n\n\"Charlie, what did I tell you about running in the kitchen like that?\" He was slurring a bit In his tired grogginess. \n\nI sniffled and tried to sound like I wasn't crying, I dont think it worked, \"not to do it-\" *sniff* \"or I'll hurt myself.\" My mom had appeared behind him by now.\n\nShe looked and me and softly said, Charlie! Oh no, are you okay?\" And bent down to me. I couldn't hold it anymore, the pain was too much and I just started wailing. \" let me see dear.\" I sat up and moved my hand, some blood on them. \"Oh no, Joey he has a bloody nose, get some napkins.\" Then dad went off the the kitchen.\n\nI while later my nose stopped bleeding but it still hurt. Mom was rubbing my arm while side hugging me and said, \"Are you ready to open your presents?\" I sat up, rubbed my eyes and nodded.\n\nMy smell had come back and I could smell food. \"Is dad making breakfast?\"\n\n\"Pancakes, eggs, and toast.\" Mom answered. I instantly smiled and started running. \"Charlie.\" Mom called after me with the*listen to me now* voice.\n\n\"Sorry mom. No more running. Got it.c I didn't run but I definitely sped to the kitchen as fast as I could go.\n\nWe had breakfast, it was so delicious. Then it was time for presents. My first present is always the lamest one. Usually socks or a shirt or pants. Mom always made sure of that. This year it was an iron-man shirt. I smiled, said thanks, and eagerly awaited the next present.\n\n\"Here you go!\" Mom handed me a box as big as my head!\n\nI tore open the present, and quickly started hopping in place. \"No way! You got me the VR Glasses!\" All my friends had them, and they seemed to never take them off.\n\n\"Goggles Charlie, but yes. Now, there isn't anything installed on there yet so-\"\n\n\"Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!\" I said hugging her.\n\nShe laughed and said, \"make sure to thank your father too, they were his idea after all.\"\n\nI gave dad a big hug too. But I quickly turned them on, ignoring the 5 other boxes and bags in the room, and put them on my face. They fit over my glasses, and the edges made everything look funny, but when the screen came on it was all I saw.\n\n\"Woooooah!\" I gleefully said. I used the controller in my hand to choose something. There were only a few options tho. Nothing cool. Just a tree explorer and videos. I began saying I want to see the other things. Mom said we could install more games after we set it up.\n\nThen nothing. I dont actually remember much else from the day beyond that point. Just nothing. It's like someone just stopped a movie mid-scene. I could vaguely remember opening presents, and a party later. But nothing nearly as vivid as the start of the day. Why couldn't I remember anything more? \n\n\"Charlie? You okay?\" It was my boss. I must've been sitting at my desk letting calla ring forever by now. The phone was ringing and the clock had passed thirty minutes.\n\n\"What? Oh! Yes I'm okay.\" I responded. And quickly picked up my ringing phone to answer the annoying customers.\n\nI went home and as I walked in the door my girlfriend greeted me with a kiss. \"Welcome home sweetie.\"\n\n\"Hey cutie, you're home early.\"\n\n\"Yeah, Janice said I could come home early since it was such a slow day, so I thought we could watch that movie!\"\n\n\"I would love nothing more. Just let me change\" I went upstairs and got out of my work clothes.\n\nWhen I went downstairs Amanda had already put the movie in and popcorn was on the table. \"Spoiling me huh?\"\n\n\"Well, we never get any time together since my schedule changed. I thought I'd make it a thing.\"\n\n\"Hell yeah.\" I grabbed us each a brownie as I sat on the couch. We let the commercials play like usual, sometimes a good trailers comes by and we make a note of the movie to watch later.\n\n As one began for a movie we'd already seen Amanda asked, \"Anything interesting happen today?\"\n\n\"Actually yeah. I had the weirdest feeling today. You know those vr goggles ever kid had like 16 years ago?\" She nodded, \"Well I remember getting one too, but I never took it off.\"\n\n\"Well it's not on you now is it?\"\n\n\"Well, no. But-\"\n\n\"Maybe your mom took it off or you just forgot.\"\n\n\"See, that's what I thought too. But i can remember everything in clear detail on that day up until after I put them on.\"\n\n\"So are you saying that you have them on still?\"\n\n\"Well...\"\n\n\"Cause that's gross.\"\n\n\"Do you see them on me.\"\n\n\"Course not.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I'm not gross huh?\"\n\nShe slapped my arm, \"shut up dweeb.\" And took a breath.\n\nA few trailer later another one we had already watched came on. Amanda started, \"So if you really never took them off, what would that make the rest of the world to you?\"\n\nI thought for a moment, \"a simulation I guess.\"\n\nAmanda sat up, turned to me and suddenly kissed me. At first I was surprised, but then I felt warm and safe and comfortable. She backed off after a few far too short moments, \"So, did that feel like a simulation?\"\n\nI shook my head and smiled, \"certainly a stimulation though.\" She smiled and rested her head back on my arm. Then we enjoyed the movie in a calming peace.\n\nAfter the movie I went to the bathroom and as I was washing my hands I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, but there were goggles over my eyes, *those goggles.*\n\nI panicked and quickly looked up at my reflection. Nothing. No goggles. It was just me. I took a deep breath and sighed, \"syking yourself out Charlie.\"\n\nLater that night I couldn't sleep. I went to rub my eye went my hand was stopped. My eyes shut open, it felt like goggles once more.i raced to the bathroom, flipped the light and, and looked in the mirror.\n\n***impossible***\n\nThere they were. Sitting right over my eyes. And as I stated the person staring back changed. He was me, but was slim, smaller, seemingly malnourished and weak. I heard a shout, Amanda, \"Babe? You okay.\" I looked over at the door and as she walked up to it she began to vanish.\n\n\"Amanda? I said, but my voice was raspy. \"AMANDA.\" I attempted to shout,  but nothing came out.\n\nSuddenly I couldn't move. Like all my muscles refused to work. They felt like solid lead. \"Amanda.\" I mouthed. But even that drained me.\n\nI didn't sleep, but I could hear voices, a voice, female. \"Day 5683 since event blackout, Patient 0116 responded extremely well to treatment method 0228b. Brain scans show signs of greatly increased activity, possibly consciousness, at two points. 11:48 PM March 15th, 2047. And.... Right.. now. 6:48 AM March 16th, 2047.\"\n\nI heard movement.\n\n\"Charlie... Charlie if you can hear me do something. Anything.\"\n\n\"A-.......am.....an....d....a...\"\n\n\n\"Amazing. He knows my name!\" I heard more movement then faint ringing.\n\nShe spoke again, \"yes, this is Doctor Amanda Trims, get me Doctor James Patterson. We've got one back. Really. He's awake.\" She continued talking, about me and what procedure she did and more. But I stopped listening. I only had one thought.\n\nThe image of Amanda, my Amanda, began to fade from my mind. I felt a tear slide down my face.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "\"Happy birthday buddy.\"\n\nHere it is again. I can hear him but I can't see him.\n\nMy father's voice resonates within my ears every April 6th, my birth date.\n\nThe day was April 6th 2020, I was laying on my hospital bed when my parents surprised me with this jet black and bulky VR goggles.\n\n\"Happy birthday!\" they exclaimed.\n\nI was elated! I blew the candles on my beloved red velvet birthday cake, for the last time.\n\nBefore I slipped into slumber, I remember my father strapping those VR goggles onto my head.\n\n\"It's for the best. See you around kiddo.\"\n\nThose were the last few words I heard.\n\nI was so sure I wouldn't fall asleep because it was so bulky but it was instantaneous.\n\nWhen I woke up I was laying on beautiful grass in some foreign land's wilderness with hazy memories.\n\nA sister from the Terra Church found me wandering through the sun lit wilderness starving, thirsty and frankly on the brink of death. She brought me back to the church where I was raised with several other orphans or as they would call us 'The Adrift'.\n\nAll of us had hazy memories of our own origins. We were taught that our parents must have angered the Supreme Goddess Terra so much so that she decided to deliver divine punishment by taking away the children.\n\nEveryone agreed that if our parents were people who would commit such grave sins that angered the Goddess Terra, we were better off living without them. Marking it off as God's Mercy.\n\nLittle by little as I grew the memories became more stagnant but I'll remember my father's voice, I'll never forget it.\n\nFast forward 21 years and here I am with my party at the guild pub downing a barrel.\n\nThe great sword sheathed onto my back and the many scars that decorated my muscular body proved I am a veteran adventurer.\n\nIt's strange because all these years I have never been able to find my father, not in the commoner realm or the noble realm yet his voice plagues me.\n\nI consulted countless amount of high priestess to seek the truth but to no avail.\n\nWell the 'voice' only happens once a year so that's fine.\n\n\"Don't drink so much you idiot, we don't want a drunk swordsman baggage who could potentially hit his own teammates.\"\n\nCatherine, my party's priest chided while sliding a pint into her own mouth. It's my birthday treat so there was no room for retaliation on my end.\n\nJack chuckled as he polished his bow and sharpened his arrows. Must be nice not being the target of that shitty priest's constant barrage of insults.\n\nFinishing the last drip and dropping some gold coins on the table we decided to move on.\n\n\"It'll be dine and dash if you took those coins Keith.\"\n\nCatherine habitually recited.\n\n\"Tsk.\"\n\nA usual reaction from the youngest member of our party, our boy wonder bandit.\n\nAs we were leaving the pub I faintly remembered.\n\nCome to think of it I have never taken off those goggles, wait what goggles were they again? V...R...?\n\nIt was as though I was swept by D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. My memories immediately become really hazy whenever I am close to remembering these things. As if some sort of 'system' was trying to block it out.\n\nThen again, it seems those unattainable memories are not of high importance for now as I cannot afford to be distracted when we are about to embark on a rather dangerous rescue quest so I'll cast them aside.\n\nDawn broke and the first ray of sunshine shone onto our feet, glistening off my steel armor leggings.\n\nI turned towards my party.\n\n\"Let's slay some dragons.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm not sure how long he's been like this\u201d\n\n\nI looked around and immediately felt queasy as all the memories came rushing back.\n\n\nIt was my birthday and mom tried her best, like she always does. Dad had died two years ago, and we were totally on our own. Mom had saved the best present for last, a state-of-the-art VR headset. When she went to retrieve it, she had collapsed on the way back. I tried to give her CPR and save her but she was already gone. \n\n\nI didn't want them to take me away from her, she was all I had. So I curled up next to her body and put the VR headset on my head. I'd spend every single day with her until i was gone as well. We'd have the best time.\n\n\nLater, the police told me when the school hadn't seen me for a while, and the landlord reported us missing, they came to investigate. Mom had missed a month of the rent and her phone got shut off. She sacrificed so much to give me the best birthday. The least I could do was enjoy it, as much as possible. \n\n\n\n(I realize this was a bit off prompt but, this is what I came up with. Please go easy on me)",

He mostly tried to keep shaking in check, but he knew that he couldn't just let them run over him.\n\n\"You've worked 8 months here, yet I don't see the sparkles in your eyes. You have every other quality, but it doesn't help when you can't be profitable.\"\n\nJames nodded. The whole meeting had been nodding. Even as his brain was generating millions of excuses, he knew that his boss was right.\n\n\"This will be your last chance, James. Don't fail this project,\" the man stood up and walked away, leaving James alone in the room.\n\n\"Fuck me,\" James said, leaning backward and looking at the ceiling. He had so many other dreams, but yet he was stuck there.\n\nIt was as his boss told him. He had every quality, except the actual work itself. He was the motivator and talker. He was active, and people overall loved him. But that wasn't enough since he couldn't work any profit. And even if he tried hard to change that, it either killed his own energy, or he still got some stupid work from his project managers. Endless non-billable bug fixes, or warranty work.\n\nBut none of that changed the fact that he hated his life. He seemed happy, he looked satisfied, but the truth was something very different.\n\nHe began thinking about his career, trying to find where it had gone wrong, and why it was so. And then he reached his childhood, remembering how he had gone through some traumas and how he had lost his best friend. But even after all of that, he had tried to push forward.\n\nThat is until he found the moment in his life when he remembered how everything changed. It wasn't like a significant change, but his life felt different.\n\n\"The VR goggles!\" he muttered to himself. But as he thought about it, he never remembered removing the goggles. He had put it on and just walked away. Why didn't he remove them?\n\nHe put his hands near his eyes and tried to grab something. He felt something physical, which was creepy. He counted to three and pulled that something away, closing his eyes.\n\n\"So?\" a voice echoed into his ears. It was a familiar voice. It was a voice he still remembered. \"How was it?\"\n\nJames opened his eyes and saw Sam sitting in front of him, eyes beaming, ready to consume any feedback he was about to share.\n\n\"Sam?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Is that you?\" James asked, eyes slowly watering up.\n\n\"Hey? What's wrong?\" Sam asked.\n\n\"You died.\"\n\n\"What? Me? Did you fall asleep while playing? Wait? Was it that realistic?\"\n\nJames looked down at the goggles, still visibly seeing the very same meeting room he was in, except that the game seemed to have paused.\n\n\"Was it really that real?\" Sam asked. \"I want to try! Give, give!\"\n\nJames shook his head and stood up. He walked to his desk and began opening his drawers. And he found it. A simple hammer. The reason why he had hammer was a different story, but he knew he had one. Without a second thought, he began hitting the goggles as hard as he could. They could hear how some sparkles flew out and it made a horrible sound, but James kept hitting it as hard as he could. He wa a lot weaker as a 10-year old boy, but he kept doing it.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Sam said, face a bit pale. He stood up and ran to James, hands holding his head. \"They were expensive! I had to ask my dad for like months. And I wanted to try them too.\"\n\nJames, however, laughed as he destroyed it.\n\n\"I already got my best birthday present, ever,\" he said.\n\n\"Really? And what's that?\"\n\n\"You, my best friend, you.\"\n\n----\n\n/r/Elven - My subreddit for my serials and other writing.

Just a bad dream.\" I didn't even convince myself saying that, but it seemed to satisfy her. \"If you're sure.\" She lay back down and felt asleep quickly.\n\nI tried to follow suit, but the realm of dreams evaded me. I got out of bed and put on some clothing. A walk would help me clear my head. I grabbed my coat and walked out the door. I took a deep breath and felt the cold air fill my lungs. This had to be real. It had to be. Still, I couldn't remember ever taking them off. My mind flew back 20 years to my 10th birthday...\n\n\"Oh, boy, a VR headset!\" I cried out. I had asked for one, but I had never expected my parents to actually get one. I ran and hugged them close. \"Thank you!\" I looked at the box and squinted. \"Simulated reality?\" I read in the side of the box. I shrugged and ripped open the box. I took out the precious headset and slipped it on my head.\n\nIn a few seconds, I had already started getting bored. It was just a plain room, with a door on one side. I had arms and legs and a body, but when I reached my hands next to my head, they disappeared. I had opened the door and walked through, and it started loading. I waited a few seconds, and I heard mom ask me how I was liking their gift. \"It's great!\" I lied. I saw them in front of me and I sighed. I hadn't even really enjoyed it that much. I continued on to my other gifts, and my birthday continued as normal.\n\nI shook my head. Had I taken it off? Everything told me I had, but my memory said otherwise. I curled up on the street and grabbed my head, and I saw my hands disappear in my peripheral vision.",

He must have noticed that he did not wake up every morning and do his morning routine and pick out the clothes he was going to wear for the day.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure the director intended that.\"\n\n\"So is Bruce Willis stupid or something?\"\n\n\"He was in denial.  His mind could not process those details.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nRachel turned to Ollie.  \"You get it, don't you Ollie?  About how Bruce Willis's perceptions were different from regular people's?\"\n\nOllie looked inexplicably pale.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" he finally said.\n\n\"Dear lord,\" Rachel muttered.  \"I see stupid people.\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm not stupid,\" I barked at her.  \"Just because I didn't get some hidden plot in a stupid movie --\"\n\n\"Do you really remember those things?\" Ollie asked.  \"Like getting dressed in the morning.\"\n\nAfter some thought, I answered, \"I usually do.  Sometimes I'm on autopilot and I go through the motions without really thinking of them.\"\n\n\"See that's what I mean.\"  Rachel sounded triumphant.  \"Bruce Willis didn't really think of those things because they were too insignificant to think about in great detail.  When he appeared in a room, he just assumed he entered it because that's how he'd normally get into the room.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I countered.  \"But then how come he didn't remember bigger things, like talking to his wife?  Don't you think he would realize that he had not talked to her for months?\"\n\n\"He was in denial.\"\n\n\"You can't keep saying denial like it explains everything that doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"It makes perfect sense.  For this movie, I mean.  Part of it was about perception.  The kid said that they only see what they want to see.\"\n\n\"How did I get here?\" Ollie blurted out.\n\nFor once, Rachel looked bewildered.\n\n\"You walked here with us,\" I said, glancing around the nearly deserted park.\n\n\"Right but before that.\"\n\n\"You rang the doorbell to my house and I opened the door.\"\n\n\"How did I get to your door?\"\n\n\"You walked.\"\n\n\"Did you see me walking over?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Rachel, did you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I don't remember walking here.  I could have just appeared on your doorstep.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" I said.  \"It doesn't prove anything.\"\n\n\"But I don't remember any of it.  Those small details, like the morning routine you mentioned.  What exactly is a morning routine anyway.\"\n\n\"Getting up, showering, brushing your teeth, getting dressed, . . .\"\n\n\"I don't do those things.\"\n\n\"You must have,\" Rachel chimed in,  \"You aren't dirty and stinky.  You wear different clothes every day.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I just picture what I want to wear and the clothes appear on me.  I thought that you guys did that too.\"\n\n\"Uh no.  Are you drunk or something?\"\n\n\"It sounds like you're having an existential crisis,\" I said.  \"Anyway, you're not a ghost.  Everyone sees you.  You interact with people.\"\n\n\"What if I'm not interacting with them and I just think I am?  What if you're the only two people who can see me?\"\n\nWe were both shaking our heads.  \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"Or are you even real?\"\n\n\"Yeah, of course we're real,\" I said.  This had gotten annoying.  \"Like I said, I remember the small details and so does Rachel.\"\n\nOllie thought it over.  \"No, you are real but you aren't the real versions of yourselves.

It may result in this entire universe being permanently frozen and/or deleted.\n\nLet me start from the the beginning.\nAbout... 20 years ago, on my tenth birthday I received a gift, \"Oh you got a present big deal big shot.\" Yeah yeah, I get it, shut up. So, I got virtual reality goggles, they were the newest craze at the time, so I thought I'd give em a try. \n\nThey weren't all they were cracked up to be, they made me feel sick, and they were in generally kinda shit. So I went on with my life as normal, went to college, got a good job, got married. There's just one problem.\n\nI don't remember ever taking them off.\n\nFaulty memory? Maybe... but I don't think so. So that's where you come in, it's been a very long time, I don't know how to quit the game anymore. So I need help, I need you to help me figure out how to get to the menu. Need help deciding if I even want to leave.\n\nAnd it may result in the universe you and I know being deleted. So, I leave it to you friends, leave and risk killing you all? Or stay, and live a lie for your sakes?",

He ignored it at first, yet the trembling of his rattling bones, and the fast, steady thrumming of his heart spoke of an ever-settled fear.\n\nHe was twenty now. It'd been ten years since he'd put on the goggles. Ten years of ups and downs, of friendships, broken hearts, and laughter.\n\nBut the thought, like a shard, twisted and interred itself deeper and deeper. \n\nIt would only take a swift, simple movement of his hand to confirm or destroy his suspicion.\n\nBut was it a suspicion? If it were a trifling, meager doubt; a silly thought, then why was he feeling such terror? \n\nHe knew what would happen when he reached for his eyes: the air would become heavy weight on the heel of his palms, and the lake, like a rising backdrop, would disappear, and be replaced with who knows what.\n\nHe sat on the edge of his bed. Drew a deep breath, felt the thrumming of his heart rippling through his hollow chest.\n\n*Boom*\n\n*Boom*\n\n*Boom*\n\n*Breathe*\n\nArms shaking, lips trembling, eyes twitching, he reached for his eyes--halted mid-motion, and gulped down the brewing fear materialized in the shape of scalding nausea.\n\nAnd then he took them off.\n\nHis room turned into a forest of great pines. Their shadows fell upon him and the mud-covered log he was sitting on. The scent of dry pinecones, burgeoning flowers, and sundry berries billowed into his nostrils. They were clean, whelming, cleansing.\n\nThe autumn colors of the trees glistened upon his eyes, throwing red and yellows streaks over their black surface. There were so vibrant, so concise and palpable. They were so real, so beautiful.\n\n*Breathe*\n\nA tear meandered down his cheek, followed by an army of them. The fear knitting his insides turned into a wriggling, rising anguish that sped up the thrumming of his heart.\n\nHow much time had he lost? Where was he? Who was he?\n\nThrough teary-eyed eyes, he gazed at the googles in his hand. They were the root of his despair. No--no, that was not true. His stupidity, his lack of self-awareness was the issue, not the goggles. He'd spent half his life living in an unreal reality, and it was time he'd never get back.\n\nBut he was somewhere in that reality. Here, in the beautiful wild, with all his senses awakening from their dormant state, everything fit like the pieces of puzzle. Everything was too real, too tangible, too perfect.\n\nIt was a flawless puzzle, save for a lonely piece that used to fit, but didn't anymore.\n\nAnd so, blinking tears away, he put his goggles back on.\n\nThe fear was gone.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nr/NoahElowyn\n\n       ",

Turns out, I never actually took them off.' \n\n'Shit!' \n\n'I know right? I guess this is goodbye forever.'\n\n'Yeah okay. Bye love.' \n\nKathy removed the vr glasses and found herself in her bedroom, still ten years old. She'd lived an entire lifetime as the first ever lesbian car saleswoman to also invent a new type of fire extinguisher. It was a proud life, one that seemed somehow unbelievable, which it was, because it was vr. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKathy's mum came in. \n\n'Awwww did you enjoy your lickle wickle game my sweet pudding pot?' \n\n'Shut up, mum. I hit you with my car when I was working at the dealership, and I'll do it again.' \n\nKathy's mum gasped like a jilted telenovela star. What had happened to her precious daughter? They fought viciously.\n\n'What has this game done to you!?' Kathy's mum bellowed emotionally. She grabbed the vr goggles off her daughter's head, pulled the elastic strap round her head, and immediately fell to the floor. \n\nKathy's mum couldn't believe it. She was Kathy, 60 years old, sitting with her partner Louise, of roughly about the same age, in a country house in the English countryside. It looked like something from a catalogue. In a frame above the fireplace was an oil painting of Kathy, holding a fire extinguisher, wearing a medal, and sitting on the boot of a Porsche SUV. Above it was the stuffed head of a deer. Kathy's mum tried to let out a diva-ish scream and pull the goggles from her eyes. But it was no use. She was immediately trapped; stuck in the 'Being John Malkovich'-esque nightmare, cemented and frozen, as Louise poked at her aching teeth, making banal comments about the sensation and appearance of them, for all eternity.\n\nWhen Kathy's mum finally learned to speak through the VR representation of her elderly daughter Kathy, after what must have been at least 50 years, she asked Louise why time had stood still and no events were changing in this VR world. \n\nLouise seemed slightly taken aback. She leaned forward and offered a small smile. 'You're in hell'. \n\nKathy's mum roared, fell to her knees in front of the painting, sinking below the waves of confusing existential pain, agonised.' Louise poked a filling on one of her back teeth and let out a small burp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKathy stood next to her screaming mother in the real world. Kathy had smashed the vr glasses whilst they were over Kathy's mum's face, causing the sensation of time to become forever vanished for her. Kathy fixed the glasses permanently to her mother's eyes and restrained her body with gaffa tape. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'No one fucks with Kathy Spence. Entrepreneur, Health and Safety visionary.' She laughed to herself, and then paused. \n\n'But that life's over now.' Kathy turned to face the door. \n\n'Im gonna change my name and become a legendary pop singer. Her name will be... Whitney Houston'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't mess with Kathy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Fragments of stone pepper my helmet when the rocket hits the granite hillside. I peek over the boulder I am crouched behind. Three insurgents hang out of a battered pickup truck. Two are brandishing automatic rifles, while the third works to reload his rocket launcher. A fourth man, a very nervous-looking insurgent with glasses, grips the steering wheel tightly as he maneuvers the truck into a u-turn. I suppose not everyone who fights this war is as excited as everyone else.\n\nTank picks herself off the ground, her teeth grit. She growls as she swings her weapon over the boulder. She yells as she rains hot lead at the pickup. Indiscriminate hollering comes from.the truck as the scramble to duck back in. The one with the RPG is struck and falls out of the bed of the truck. He hits the ground and lies motionless.\n\nThe tires of the truck spin in the loose desert dirt as the driver pulls the truck away from Tank's fury. A stream of bullets streaks across the driver's door, ending at the truck's front tire. It bursts from the onslaught and the driver loses control. He careens into a ditch, tossing his buddies like rag dolls. I take the opportunity.\n\n\"Go go go!\" I command. Behind me, Private Kiddo, Private Steel, and Corporal Payne all charge toward the truck. With swift precision, we pick off the remaining two insurgents before they could react. We sweep around the vehicle, ensuring all hostiles are taken care of. I heard movement coming from the driver's seat. I pull the door open.\n\n\"Don't shoot!\" cracks a timid voice. The driver is met with four M4 rifles pointed at his face. I reach in, grab him by the collar, and yank him out. He falls to his knees and starts to beg. \"Please don't kill me!\" he whimpers.\n\nTank walks up behind up, loading a new belt into her SAW. She pulls the charging handle and points her weapon at the fallen enemy.\n\n\"No!\" I shout, pushing her weapon aside.\n\n\"Why?\" Tank demands. \"He's useless. Just kill him and move on.\"\n\n\"He could have information on the enemy,\" I explain. \"Let's take him back to base.\"\n\nTank eyes him for a second, then spits and walks away. Kiddo and Steel grab the man, cuff him, and drag him back to the Humvee, while Payne and I cover the rear. When we get back to the Humvee, Kiddo and Steel climb into the back with our detainee, I take shotgun, Payne drives, and Tank sits in the back on lookout, weapon ready for anything. Along the way, I radio in our detainee. I am ordered to take him to our interrogation shed for questioning. I acknowledge the order and pass it along to Payne. He turns around and we drive a couple minutes to a small abandoned building. Payne parks behind some dead brush and we all climb out, detainee in tow. Tank and Payne provide cover while the rest of us guide the man into the building. I find a chair, sit him down, and begin to question him.\n\n\"What is your name?\" I ask.\n\n\"Uh...\" the man stammers. He eyes everyone around him nervously.\n\n\"Answer the damn question!\" Tank shouts from her window post.\n\nI look at him insistantly. He gulps. \"They call me... Aloha Snackbar.\"\n\n\"What the fuck?\" Tank growls. \"That's not offensive at all.\"\n\nI ignore her. \"Where is your headquarters located?\" I ask.\n\nThe detainee shakes his head. I ask again. He still shakes his head. \"I can't!\"\n\n\"You will tell us, or I'll unleash Tank on you,\" I say. I hear Tank crack her knuckles behind me.\n\n\"Incoming!\" Payne shouts.\n\nI drop to the floor just as a rocket hits the wall of the building. A hole is blasted open, followed by small arms fire. Tank and Payne fire back, but Kiddo and Steel are down, dead. I pick my rifle up, push Aloha Snackbar against the opposite wall, and rush to find a good position. Bullets pepper the building as the insurgents rain hell upon us. Tank tries to return fire, spraying anywhere she can see enemies. As we return fire, I hear the back door get kicked open. I turn and begin to shoot at the door, but I do not see anyone. Next to me, I hear Tank groan, then silence as she falls to the floor, bleeding profusely. Then I see a small can roll across the floor, followed by a loud pop. My vision burns white from the flashbang, and my ears ring. Everything starts to streak white and black, my hearing turns to static, and suddenly, a sharp blow to the back of my head.\n\n*     *     *\n\nContinued in replies...",

                    "comment": "I open my eyes to white ceiling tiles and flourescent lights. The soft glow burns mh eyes for a second and I briefly think about the flashbang. Then it fades and I see that I am in an infirmary. I sit up and glance around. I am in a triple-oppupancy room with two other patients. One is unconsious. The other is sitting up, watching television. He glances at me and smiles.\n\r\n\"Glad to see you're awake,\" he says softly. \"You've been out for three days.\"\n\r\nI suddenly remember the attack and instinctively touch the back of my head. There is no bandaging, not even a bruise. I do not have much time to think about it when a nurse walks in. She is carrying a tray of food when she notices me. She quickly delivers the tray to the other patient, then hurries to my side.\n\r\n\"How are we feeling?\" she asks.\n\r\nHer voice is like honey and she smells of strawberries. Her copper hair is pulled back into a work bun, but her bangs fall over her forehead, framjng her sapphire eyes. For a brief moment, I think I am looking at an angel.\n\r\n\"Er... fine, I suppose,\" I say. \"A little groggy.\"\n\r\nThe nurse nods. \"That is normal. A little food and water will help clear that up. I'll bring you some lunch.\" She checks my readings, then turns and walks off. A few minutes later, she returns with a tray of food. It does not look like much, but it smells much better than diesel fumes and gun smoke. I begin to eat.\n\r\nThe nurse works around me, checking my IVs, my vitals, and ensuring everything is clean. I find myself stealing glances at her, and I am pretty sure she notices. She smiles politely.\n\r\n\"Anything wrong?\" she asks. \"Any pain?\"\n\r\nAs soon as she mentioned pain, I feel a slight throbbing from the back of my head. I touch the spot and she nods. She begins to check the area, visually inspecting for signs of trauma. Then she applies light pressure to the area, but I feel no pain.\n\r\n\"You appear to be all right,\" she says. \"Physically, anyway. We will bring in a psychologist to do a mental evaluation. Anything else I can do for you?\"\n\r\nI could think of some things, but I keep them to myself. I shake my head. \"I'm fine.\"\n\r\nShe nods. \"If you need anything, just push this button here.\" She points to the call button attached to the bed. \"I'm Nurse Joy. Either myself or Nurse Betty will be in to tend to you.\"\n\r\nI nod. \"Thank you, Nurse Joy.\" She begins to walk away. \"Er... I'm Max.\"\n\r\nJoy looks at me and smiles. \"I know.\" She heads out the door, leaving me to feel silly.\n\r\nThe next few days are a blur. Joy frequently visits me to check my vitals, bring me food, and ensure I can walk on my own. Soon, after she has determined that I can walk on my own, I am allowed to roam the hospital. There are many people here, soldiers like me, suffering the wounds of war. Some got off lucky like me; minor injuries, scrapes and bruises, maybe some head trauma. Others were not so lucky, having lost limbs and other body parts. My unconscious roommate was one of them, having died the day after I woke up. I have heard stories from my father about his time at war, but those stories did not deter me from serving myself. No, my dad was a hero to me, and I wanted to be just like him. It is sad to see so many injured, but this only spurs me on, my desire to protect my fellow soldiers burning even brighter. I cannot wait to get out of here and back into the field.\n\r\nI find the recreation room, where several patients are watching a football game on the television. I quickly check the score (49ers are beating the Seahawks 24 to 6, nice!), then proceed to the backdoor where the garden is. I stroll through, enjoying the pleasant smell of Japanese honeysuckle and roses lining the path. Halfway down the path, I see a turnoff leading to a fountain surrounded by sunflowers and benches. I decide to walk down there and check it out. When I get there, I find a lone woman sitting on a bench, eating lunch.\n\r\n\"Nurse Joy!\" I say with embarrassing enthusiasm.\n\r\nJoy looks up from her sandwich and smiles at me. I walk up to her and she offers me to sit down next to her. \"Please, just 'Joy' will do.\"\n\r\nI nod and sit next to her. As I ponder what I should say, she begins to speak. \"It's peaceful out here,\" she says. \"Being a military hospital, most of our patients are big tough soldiers who are tok macho for flowers, so hardly anyone comes out here. Because of that, I like to eat my lunch out here. It's quiet.\"\n\r\n\"And it smells lovely,\" I say.\n\r\nJoy gives me a peculiar look. I just shrug. \"It's a vast contrast to the gritty smell of Humvees and gunpowder. I've spent half my career in warzones. Places like this are a blessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess not all soldiers are macho,\" she chuckles.\n\r\nI give her a gently elbow. \"I wouldn't call myself macho, but I'm not a sissy either,\" I said, forcing myself not to grin too big. \"I get the job done.\"\n\r\n\"I can see that, that's why you're in here,\" she jests. She has a dark sense of humor. I like that.\n\r\n\"So why did you choose nursing service members?\" I ask.\n\r\nJoy looks at the fountain. \"My father died at war,\" she explains. \"I figured if I got into nursing, I could prevent other fathers and mothers from dying too.\"\n\r\nI nod. \"Very noble.\"\n\r\n\"How about you?\" she asks. \"Why become a soldier?\"\n\r\n\"My father was a soldier before me,\" I say. \"He told me stories as a kid and I looked up to him. I wanted to be just like him. He was my hero.\"\n\r\n\"Ah, the old 'like father, like son' story,\" she chuckles.\n\r\n\"Haha, yeah, I suppose,\" I laugh. \"Still, that's my story and I'm sticking with it.\"\n\r\n\"It's a good story,\" she says with a warm smile.\n\r\nI look over at her. \"What would it take for us to have lunch together sometime?\" I ask.\n\r\nShe smirks. \"It would take you not being my patient,\" she says. \"Strictly against code.\"\n\r\n\"I see,\" I say. \"Then I will do my best to get discharged, so I will no longer be your patient.\"\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose you can call me when that happens,\" she smiles. \"In the meantime, you have an appointment tomorrow with the psychologist for your mental evaluation. I'm sure you pass with flying colors.\" She gets up, winks at me, and walks off.\n\r\nMy heart flutters, then my head throbs. I ignore it. I need to get out of here as soon as possible.",

                            "comment": "The next day, I am introduced to Dr. Niles Smith. He has me sit in a chair opposite of him. While he reads through my file, I observe my surroundings. The office is arranged to look like a study, with a shelf of various books lining one wall and a large vanity mirror on another. There is a faux fireplace next to us. The chair I am sitting in is soft and comfortable, looks similar to the shrink's chair, with a coffee table between us. The place is elaborate, but comforting.\n\r\nDr. Smith closes my files and looks at me through his spectacles. \"Would you care for some coffee or tea, Staff Sergeant?\" he asks.\n\r\nI shake my head. \"Please, just call me 'Max'.\"\n\r\n\"As you wish,\" he says. \"So tell me, how did you wind up here?\"\n\r\n\"You just read my file,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"I want to hear it in your own words,\" Dr. Smith says.\n\r\nI take a deep breath. \"My squad was tasked with finding a weapons cache,\" I begin. \"When we found it, we were attacked by four insurgents jn a pickup truck. We managed to defeat them without injury, killing three and detaining one. I was then commanded to interrogate him. We arrive at our interrogation post, and were attacked during questioning. My squad...\" I hesitate. I had not thought about those events since waking up, and now the pain of losing my team hits me hard. Tears well up in the corners of my eyes. \"...I lost my squad. Private Kiddo... Private Steel... they both died when the RPG hit. Sergeant Tank and Corporal Payne both returned fire, but Tank was hit. She fell and bled out. The look in her eyes... it was like her soul had left her body before she hit the floor.\" I close my eyes and take in the memories. The smell of burnt clay and fresh blood, the sound of automatic fire and brass raining on the floor, the blinding light, the static in my ears... wait, what? That does not sound right. I shake my head and I feel the pounding on my skull again. I must be confused. \"I don't know what happened to Payne, but I remember a bright light. Someone threw a flashbang. Then I woke up here.\"\n\r\nDr. Smith fervently scribbles in his notepad, a intrigued look on his face. He finishes his notes, then looks at me. \"Since the attack, have you had any recurring nightmares?\"\n\r\nI shake my head. \"No.\" Now that he mentions it, I do not recall having any dreams, or even sleeping. Have I slept at all? Surely I must have. I am a soldier, not a machine.\n\r\n\"How is your appetite?\" he asks.\n\r\n\"Normal, I suppose,\" I reply. \"The food here is bland, but I suppose that's expected in a hospital.\"\n\r\nDr. Smith nods and scribbles down some more notes. \"How about your other body functions? Regular bathroom breaks? Continued interest in things you normally are interested in? Sexual arousal?\"\n\r\nI answer his rapid-fire questions, but I pause on the last one. My mind wanders to Joy. Growing up, I always had this ideal woman in my mind, my dream girl. Everything about her: her looks, her personality, everything was detailed. I do not know why I did this, but I did, and miraculously, I find her in a military hospital. Everything about her is perfect, right down to her copper hair. I smile and nod. \"Yeah, everything is fine.\"\n\r\n\"Good, good,\" he mutters, jotting down notes. \"Now tell me, what made you decide to join the service?\"\n\r\nI sigh. \"Well, my father was a soldier himself,\" I explain. \"He used to tell me stories of when he was younger, before he met my mother, about his deployments. I was always fascinated by his tales of heroism, the acts of valor he and his fellow soldiers performed during the war. My father was my hero and I wanted to be just like him.\" I chuckle. \"He was stationed in Korea when I was nine, and when he came home for my tenth birthday, he brought a virtual reality headset with the new Call of Battle: Duty Field game. Oh, I loved that game. I felt just like my dad whenever I played it.\" I look over at the mirror and see myself; tall, ruggedly handsome, battle-scarred, just like my dad. \"My mother always said I look just like him. That makes me proud.\"\n\r\n\"You speak as if he isn't alive anymore,\" Dr. Smith says.\n\r\n\"No, he still is,\" I say. \"He's just worn out now. Old age, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see...\" Dr. Smith writes some more notes. \"What does your father think of you following in your footsteps?\"\n\r\n\"I... uh...\" I think on it, struggling to remember. \"I think he is proud of me?\" I close my eyes. My head is pounding again, harder than before. \"He was supportive when I told him I wanted to sign up. My mother was against it, of course, and she certainly didn't like my father fostering the idea. She didn't approve of the game, but when she saw how excited I was to get it, she couldn't tell me 'no' on my birthday, especially right after my father came home from a tour in Korea.\"  My mind suddenly floods with streaks of white and black, almost like static on the television. I flinch, and Dr. Smith notices.\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he asks, leaning forward.\n\r\n\"N... nothing,\" I say. \"Just a headache.\"\n\r\n\"I see...\" Dr. smith jots down a note. \"You seem to have fond memories of when you were a kid.\"\n\r\nI nod. \"Yeah, some of my best memories were when I was ten and my father had come home. I had missed him so much. Now I am the one who is away from home. I would very much like to see him again.\" I sigh. \"A part of me wishes I was still that kid.\"\n\r\n\"But Max,\" Dr. Smith says. \"You still are that kid.\"\n\r\n\"I suppose, but...\" I stop. Dr. Smith was staring at me intently. He stares at me so hard, with such a fierce gaze, the back of my head burns. Suddenly, I hear voices all around me.\n\r\n\"...how is he...\"\n\r\n\"...please... no...\"\n\r\n\"...doctor, do something...\"\n\r\n\"...I'm sorry...\"\n\r\nI frantically look around. Where are those voices coming from? Am I going mad? The room slowly changes. The door and windows have disappeared. I am trapped in this room with Dr. Smith and all these voices. Where are they? Who are they? Why am I hearing them??\n\r\nI jump to my feet and back away. Dr. Smith slowly rises and maintains his fixated gaze. I grab my head... oh, the pounding! I meet Dr. Smith's gaze. He slowly raises a hand and points his finger at the mirror. I glance over and see myself; not as who I am now, but as who I was as a kid. I remember now... that is how I looked when I was ten. The little boy stares back at me and motions me to come forward. I cautiously approach the mirror. My younger self steps aside and I see him laying in a hospital bed, with a tube coming out of his mouth; my mouth. I realize that is me, as a young teenager, unconscious. I see a faded image of my parents standing by my side with a doctor.\n\r\n\"It has been three years,\" the doctor says. \"He is unresponsive, effectively brain-dead. We can continue to keep him on life support, but it is unlikely he will ever wake up.\"\r\n\r\nMy father holds my mother in his arms as she weeps. He strokes her hair, and I admire their love. If what I am seeing is true, then all this, everything, is a lie, a fantasy of a young comatose mind. There is no war, there is no squad, there is no Joy... oh, Joy. No wonder she was perfect. She was just a dream. Everything he had decided his perfect girl would be has formulated into the nurse that tended to him and cared for him. She was not real, but just the dream of a pubescent boy.\n\r\n\"What is this?\" I rhetorically ask, despite already knowing the truth.\n\r\n\"Three years ago, you received a virtual reality game from your father,\" Dr. Smith explains. \"During one of your gaming sessions, you suffered an epileptic seizure. You fell, hitting your head on your dresser, and have been comatose for three years.\"\n\r\nTears begin to fall down my face. I press my hands against the glass of the mirror. My parents are so wrought with despair. I need to get back to them. I need to wake up. I pound on the glass, but it is solid and does not break. Then I see my dad, with tear-streaked cheeks, nod slowly at the doctor. The doctor returns the nod and reaches for the switch.\n\r\n\"No!\" I scream. \"Mom! Dad!\"\n\r\nI turn around and grab the nearest chair. I pick it up and look at the mirror. Through the glass, I see the doctor place his hand upon the machine. I swing the chair at the mirror just as the doctor presses the switch. The mirror shatters and everything goes blank.",

It was interesting kind of a feeling.\n\nI grabbed a stone from the ground and I threw towards a metal junk that was stading right beside the broken wall. Noise that stone and metal junk made didn\u2019t sound right. \n\n''Oh, here is your missing shoe.'' I find her shoe right next to stone that threw just now. As soon as I picked it up, I noticed there was some sort of liquid inside of a shoe. I turned it sideways and and blood spilled to ground and made a sound that like someone is crying.\n\nI turned my back and she was gone.

Trying to tell me something.  I turned my head to other side and I saw the VR that my parents gave me... Oh no. CAN\u2019T BE! \n\nI was hearing mixed voice in my head.

            "comment": "Sometimes she thought her life was much more exciting than it had any right to be. When she looked back at her childhood, she didn\u2019t remember everything being so...intense. Movies and books and such were, of course, but her life had always been much calmer than that when she was young. She couldn\u2019t remember exactly when that had changed, but drama filled nearly every aspect of her life now, and that was how it had been for almost as long as she could remember.\n\nFor the moment, though, things seemed calm. She sipped her coffee, slipping over to the floor-to-ceiling windows and leaning her head against the cool glass. Rain pattered against the window, dripping and pooling on the off-white tile of her balcony overlooking the roiling waves of the ocean. Lightning streaked across the swirling indigo sky, thunder rumbling close behind, and she smiled. Her home was perfect - and she didn\u2019t even have to pay for it. She couldn\u2019t remember why, exactly, but that was how it had been for almost as long as she could remember.\n\nShe walked away from the window, her steps echoing off gleaming onyx walls, descending down her spiral staircase as she sipped her coffee. Halfway down, though, she slipped and tumbled down the rest of the stairs, her mug flying out of her hand and shattering, and her leg twisting and making a sickening crack and when she hit the bottom. She sighed, pushing herself up to a sitting position and waiting. 1, 2, 3... and her leg straightened itself out, painlessly snapping back into place. She wasn\u2019t sure she remembered healing like that as a child, but that was how it had been now for almost as long as she could remember.\n\nShe pushed herself back to her feet, stooping to pick up her coffee mug, which had reassembled itself - although it was now sadly devoid of coffee. She pursed her lips, irritated that she\u2019d have to go back upstairs to get more coffee later. She moved forward, stepping into her bedroom and heading for her closet. The lights flicked on as she passed by, and her eyes roamed over the neatly arranged four-room closet, searching for something to switch into. She wasn\u2019t sure where all these clothes had come from or why it always seemed like the perfect outfit was hidden somewhere within no matter how random or outlandish, but that was how it had been for almost as long as she could remember.\n\nAnd the assortment of outfits inside was truly astounding; but she\u2019d needed something different for each job she\u2019d held - and she\u2019d had so many different jobs throughout the years. She\u2019d been a spy for the intelligence agency, but she\u2019d been turned to the enemy\u2019s side for a time when they captured someone she held dear (although for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t remember who anymore); she\u2019d been a chef at a five star restaurant, tasked with preparing food for the elite of New York - or was it Tokyo?; she\u2019d been a famous singer renowned for her unique alto vibrato; she\u2019d been the long-lost princess of a small country no one had ever heard of; she\u2019d been a mob boss. She couldn\u2019t remember how she\u2019d picked up the skills for any of these different jobs, but that was how it had been for almost as long as she could remember.\n\nShe sifted through the clothing, eventually finding a sweater and some leggings that looked acceptable for lounging around the house. Moving to the mirror, she held the sweater up to her, admiring how the color complemented her eyes - of course, everything looked perfect on her no matter how ridiculous, so that was hardly saying something. She started to turn away from the mirror, preparing to change, when the strangest flicker caught her eye - it looked as though the mirror itself briefly twisted out of existence. Startled she looked into the mirror\u2019s depths, and it flickered again - but this time, she caught the briefest glimpse of something other than herself in the mirror. Something with a different hair color, different face shape, something that was wearing a bulky, odd-looking pair of glasses over its eyes. Then the mirror flicked back into place. Confused and disturbed, she reached up to brush her face where the nonexistent glasses should be, expecting to find only empty air, but her fingers pressed against something hard and cold. \n\nShe tugged, and the glasses slid off.",

I looked around the tiny, empty little hotel room that I was calling home for the night. I finally felt alive again. I looked at my arm where the syringe was still hanging out. An empty small plastic bag was beside me. Straight away I felt like more. That was the best trip I\u2019d ever been on. I called my dealer and asked him to bring over another hit. \u2018What\u2019s it called again?\u2019 I asked him over the phone. \u2018Nexdoxtrolone\u2019 he replied.\n\nThat was three months ago. And now here I am. Sleeping on a bench just down the street from my dealer, panhandling during the day just to get enough money for my next hit. My life had been slowly going this way over the past two years. First it was m&amp;ms I got hooked on, then Dr Pepper, the alcohol and then I found my best friend, Nextdoxtrolone. It\u2019s all I have now but my life as the worlds best race car driver had become boring and repetitive. This drug, my one true friend, allowed me to go to so many places, do so many things. All of the trips were so real and during them I still had freewill to guide my imagination whatever direction I liked. My life had become so much better in these last three months.\n\nBut there was one side effect. After that first hit that created a trip that felt like days, the trips had become increasingly shorter, and I had to go longer without for my next hit. It was beginning to give me physical withdrawal symptoms and freaky thoughts. Thoughts that I only had one choice to make, to become a race car driver. Thoughts that I\u2019d lost someone, something. Thoughts that I didn\u2019t really belong. \n\nThen one day the inevitable finally happened. My trip didn\u2019t last long enough and it was taking too long to panhandle enough money. I was getting increasingly desperate, shaking, mumbling, crying. Then I passed out on my bench.\n\nWhoosh! I woke up, on that same bench, with a sudden epiphany. I whipped  VR goggles off my face and looked up to see my parents standing over me. \n\n\u2018So how did it feel, being a race car driver?\u2019 my dad asked. I looked at him, shaking. \u2018Dad, I need some money. I need to get some more Nexdoxtrolone.\u2019 My heart raced, I mumbled, cried and collapsed to the floor unconscious, my ten year old body convulsing.\n\nI awake in a hospital bed. I try to move, but can\u2019t. I try to talk, but can\u2019t. I hear the slow beep of machines and then my mom, crying. A calm voice, must be a doctor, says \u2018I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, there\u2019s nothing we can do. His body is shutting down. He\u2019s got all of the hallmarks of a severe shock from a drug withdrawal, but we can\u2019t find any traces of anything in his system. His organs are shutting down. You must prepare for the worst, it won\u2019t be long now.\u2019",

It dawned to examine the closet in a attempt to find your old blue jeans and hoodie, clearly your preferred attire for the cool fall weather that just seasoned in like a salt and pepper shaker hard at work. The first thing you find on top is those old VR goggles you got once upon a time, you notice the brand deeply printed \"lily of the how he\" on the shiny finish. After pondering such a weird brand name you decided to see if they still fit your fully grown head, low and behold the strap was broken.  Then you made the realization those cheap bastards,  no wonder I don't remember these damn things they wouldn't even strap on fresh out of the sales cube.

            "comment": "\"Wait, have you ever seen that movie about people living in virtual reality? I dont remember what It's called.\" Said John. \"If u mean Matrix, then yes, I did. It was a great movie but it reminded me something. I don't know why.\"\nEverytime I watched it I got strong feeling of dej\u00e0 vu for some reason. \"Imagine if we both could just live in a virtual reality. Who would you be in that world?\" John asked with a smile on his face. \"I would probably be something cool. Being human is so lame sometimes.\"  He is scaring me sometimes.\n\n\"Yeah no, i would probably be a human. It's not worth being something else. Do you realize how impractical that would be?\" Being 4 meters tall doesn't sound like something I would want to experience. \"Bro imagine if we are living in a simulation right now. That would be hillarious.\" Said John. \"Yeah.\" I said with worried look on my face. That dej\u00e0 vu feeling was back. What is going on?\n\n\"John I'm starting to get scared. But I have to ask you now. Do you remember my 10th birthday?\" \"Yeah I do.\" He said. \"You got that awesome red cactus everyone was so envy of.\" Oh no... \"Well that is not true at all. I got virtual reality glasses.\" \"Really? I don't even know about that! You were really closed inside yourself as a kid!\" He laughed but I wanted to cry. There is no chance right? \"John are you even real? I asked with tears in my eyes.\" He stepped back and looked really worried. \"Mike what is going on? Did I do something? Can I fix it?\" \"No,  you can't.\" I said with tears in my eyes. All those years, those moments. Were they all fake.\n\n\"John I will think of you forever.\" I said and put my hands to my head. I felt tiny tickling around my hands. That is a bad sign. I pushed and pulled air around my face. And it was true after all. I forgot to take off my glasses when I was 10. I looked around my house. It was the same way as I remember it. Except it was all empty and dirty. It was also pretty broken. Only thing that was clean was a machine with some unknown substance in it and a spoon. \"So that's what I have been eating all those years.\" I thought to myself and started walking around the house. I just couldn't help but start to cry. My parents. My friends. They are all gone now. \"I just wish it all could dissapear.\" But what if it can?\n\nI put my hands to my head and pulled. It was a move out of curiosity and loneliness but it worked. Now I've been in some doctor's office. \"So how did it go?\" He asked. I was shocked. I didn't even bother to reply as panic washed over my body. I instantly took off another pair of virtual goggles. And another. And another. I started to scream in horror as I was pulling down more and more and more goggles. Everytime I've seen something new. My mind started to bend and my hands started to get bloody as I just couldn't stop pulling down those damn goggles.",

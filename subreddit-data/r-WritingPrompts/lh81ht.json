            "comment": "\u201cMr. McCoy, I believe you have a filter turned on in the video settings,\u201d the judge is saying to me.\n\nI am panicking, my little fury paws frantically clicking the mouse trying to turn on my human filter. These god damn settings are so confusing.\n\n\u201cYou might want to, ummm\u2026\u201d\n\nI knew this day would come. I knew this would happen. Keep calm, Mittens McCoy. Keep calm.\n\n\u201cAhhhh, I\u2019m trying to turn on the filter now... ahhh, I mean off, turn the filter off\u2026 can you hear me judge?\u201d My voice squeaks out. A whining meow almost comes out in my anxiety.\n\n\u201cYes, I can hear you.\u201d The judge says, annoyed.\n\nI can see my white fluffy face filling the screen. I can see the terror in my adorable glossy eyes. I need to fix this fast or all of my hard work will have been in vain.\n\n\u201cJust bear with me, Judge. I assure you I\u2019m not a cat.\u201d\n\nThe judge laughs.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d he says. \u201cI think if you just click the arrow button down at the bottom\u2026\u201d\n\nAll my work. Everything is in jeopardy. I still can\u2019t get the human filter to work.\n\nJust ride with it, Mittens. Let\u2019s go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared to move forward with the case, Judge. Filter or not. I don\u2019t think it should matter. I assure you I am not a cat.\u201d\n\nThe judge stares at me for a long time.\n\n\"You already said that,\" the judge says.\n\nHe knows. My little ears perk up. I see them on the screen. My hair stands on end. My back begins to arch, and a low whining growl comes out of my mouth. I have a desire to just give up and to snuggle up on this keyboard. Feeling the warmth on my body.\n\nKeep it together, Mittens McCoy. Keep it together.\n\n\u201cAlright, this is strange.\u201d The judge finally says. \u201cIt is hard to take you seriously with that filter on\u2026\u201d\n\nHis words sting. If you pull my whiskers, do I not yowl?\n\nDoes a cat not know justice? I passed the online bar exam; highest test score they\u2019d seen in years. I\u2019ve always been judged for my fluffy white face, my large adorable eyes, my pink button nose.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair.\n\nThe pandemic has been my opportunity. I have made a reputation for my self as one of the up and coming young lawyers in Texas. I was interviewed on zoom just a few days ago by the *Texas Young Lawyers Association.* I am proud of my accomplishments.\n\n\u201cYour honor, I hope you won\u2019t judge me by this filter. I assure you I am a lawyer of high standing.\u201d I say, raising up on my little haunches. Sticking out my fluffy chest.\n\n\u201cAlright, but I haven\u2019t met you yet.\" The judge says. \"Can you please tell me what kind of law you specialize in, Mr. McCoy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBird law, your honor.\u201d\n\n\\---\n\nMore at r/CataclysmicRhythmic",

            "comment": "It's not easy, being a cat in a human's world.\n\nMy particular human, Alice, was a kind and loving companion. But even with her, my place in the pecking order was clear, she decided when it's time for food, for play, and for sleep. In my youth I rebelled with a random scratch or two here or there, of course, but as I grew older I found it easier to admit that humans run the show and I accepted my place in it.\n\nBut a strange thing began to happen over the course of my life. All parts of my human's existence became more and more 'online'. She shopped online, dated online,  and 'trolled' forums online, whatever the purpose of that was. In a practical sense, that meant she was home more often, which was not especially a fan of, as a creature yearning for independence, but I *also* saw this 'Interconnected Net' as an opportunity.\n\nIn the wee hours of the night, her keyboard and mouse called to me, almost begging me to make use of their seemingly infinite powers. And so, I did. I learned history from Wikipedia, watched countless hours of cute cat videos on YouTube, and I pursued my passion in life: the law.\n\nWithin my online Law School classes, I was Walter J. Whiskermann, a respected student with a knack for contract law. I learned to vocalize, morphing my meows into believable facsimiles of human speech. Before long, my oral arguments within simulated courtrooms became legendary among my professors and classmates alike!\n\nBut my graduation at the top of my class felt more like the end of a journey than the beginning of my career. Given my fur, tail, and proud whiskers, I'd never be accepted arguing the merits of a vital case before the Supreme Court, as was my dream.\n\nFor months, I fell into a deep depression, barely bothering to bat at the ball on a string that Alice dangled in front of me. She worried for me, rightfully, as that had been my favorite of activities. It was the dark place I resided within, until another remarkable shift occurred.\n\nThis year, Alice stopped going in to work each day. For 'safety reasons' she worked from home, over something called 'Zoom', a video conferencing program that humans seemed barely capable of comprehending or navigating with success. Whatever this shift in behavior was, it once again presented me with an unthinkable opportunity.\n\nOne day I witnessed Alice on a 'social' Zoom meeting, drinking wine with her girlfriends while watching a movie together... yet apart. The ladies had a grand time, not just because of the booze and their 80th re-watch of *Magic Mike,* but also because of magical inventions within the video chat app known as 'filters'.\n\nWith these filters, they could appear to be anything they liked to anyone on the Zoom call! One was a dinosaur, another a talking poo emoji, but when one of Alice's friends impersonated a cat, in a most insulting fashion I must add, my plan clicked into place.\n\nLike an answer to prayer, I found there was in fact a \"middle aged human man in a suit\" filter. The perfect filter, it turned out, to begin my career as a Zoom-only lawyer!\n\nThings went well for months. I argued cases, submitted briefs, and helped my clients out of jams. Until one fateful day... when I forgot to turn the filter on as a hearing before a judge began.\n\n\"Uhhh, Mr. Whiskermann?\" the judge said, confusion evident in his voice. \"Are you there?\"\n\nI stared at my own video chat window in horror. There I sat, my hind legs folded neatly me, tail wagging gently, staring into the webcam as a very obvious house cat. Seeing no other option, I began to speak as rapidly as I could force the words from my mouth.\n\n\"I'm here judge! I uh... I don't know... what's happening with uhhh-\"\n\n\"I think you have a *filter* turned on, sir? A cat filter pehaps?\"\n\nI tried to hide my elation, perhaps I still had a chance if I played along!\n\n\"Yes, that must be it judge,\" I said. \"I'm, I'm not a cat! But uhhh, my assistant... uhhh, Alice, is attempting to disable it right now. She's only 25 so she understands these things much more than us older folks! You know how it is, right? Ha!\"\n\n\"I do, sadly. I spent an entire virtual courtroom day on a Maui beach backdrop because I couldn't for the life of me turn the damn thing off!\" He paused a moment. \"You don't seem to be having much luck getting rid of the cat filter either. Do you want a recess Mr. Whiskermann? Or-\"\n\n\"No, no! We can proceed if you don't mind my absurd appearance,\" I said, forcing a friendly chuckle.\n\n\"You're sure you're prepared?\"\n\n\"Prepared, yes sir. I'm ready right meow!\"\n\nSilence filled our call for what felt like an eternity before the judge spoke again.\n\n\"Mr. Whiskermann?\"\n\n\"Yes, your honor?\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed to a suspicious squint. \"Are you a cat? Legally, you have to tell me if you're a cat.\"\n\n\"No, your honor! I, uhhh...\" I knew what had to be done, but still, the obvious solution to my dilemma ate at the very core of my being. \"Your honor, I assume you read my briefs? Do you honestly think a pea brained house cat could produce such quality work?\"\n\nHis frown softened into a chuckling smile. \"Cats *are* quite dumb sometimes, that is true. I love my cat Petunia, but she once fell into the toilet twice in one day! I apologize for the absurd accusation. You may proceed, counselor.\"\n\nAnd proceed I did, awash in shame over sullying my honor and the most basic dignity of my species, but having successfully salvaged the promising young career of Walter J. Whiskermann, Esq.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFeel free to check out r/Ryter if you'd like to read many more of my stories \ud83d\ude42",

            "comment": "I care for nothing other than the complete, unvarnished truth, and I must admit that, given my superb senses, as well as my deep insight into the frailty of human nature, I have found it simple to uncover the facts. I hear the tremor in a voice, and I lap up the sweat of a defendant whose cross-examination becomes my purposeful game as I expose them for the frauds they are. And oh, they don\u2019t know it; they don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve caught them lying, bellies exposed, and they never will. Though I may tell you, dear reader, I pursue any avenue available to me -- even that of some delightful spying in the back rooms - disgraceful hands petting me as they broadcast their new tactics in glorious surround sound. I could hear them through walls, if I so desired, but I want to savor the freedom of tongues. Yes, perhaps unusual and more than a bit\u2026 borderline, but the system demands justice, and I provide it. A feat I could not accomplish without the aid of another vulnerable type; a partner so thoroughly wronged that she, too, would not interfere with the demands of our job. Not when so much rests upon our successful prosecutions. (And lest you wonder about our meet-cute; she raised me from a kitten and, because of this, took it in stride that I would talk to her as she spoke with me. Her perspective on reality, perhaps, but we understood each other. And I, though languid, could eventually hold my attention on her voice as she paced -- attempting to memorize a million bits of minutiae. The real trick, as it turned out, was passing the BAR, but a good fake ID from a friend fixed it so that Clarice \u201ctook\u201d the exam twice.)\n\nExcept that Clarice Thomas made a mistake. We both did. It seemed a thrill for her to finally introduce the partner in her law firm. Everyone asked to meet the stupendous Chris T Esquire that she so often referenced as her legal muse, and the advent of a pandemic, as well as the corresponding rise of video feeds, provided her a chance to esteem herself in this regard. No more excuses about the current case on which I cogitated (which eventually fell by the wayside or which fell into her lap by way of some happenstance. We are surrounded by lawyers. Excuses become preposterous.) So, we both thought it worth the effort to put a face to the name. And, oh what a magnificent job we did on our first feed, but as I now realize, as I cough out rationalization like hair, technology makes liars of us all.\n\n\u201cMr. Thomas, I simply cannot understand why you thought a cat facade would please the court. You do realize that I could have you thrown from the session for this.\u201d\n\nIt did me no good to have a dozen sets of eyes wonder at the arrogance of a man who\u2019d make such a gaffe, and even less so as I was on display for Clarice\u2019s legal jury of peers. Did I have so little consideration for the tenor of the proceedings -- surrounding a white-collar thief who embezzled millions! -- that I thought it amusing to disguise myself as a cat? Of course not. I was a cat, but that seemed an even surer way to disgrace both myself and Clarice. Dear me, the hypocrisy of my search for unvarnished fact, and I couldn\u2019t embolden either of us to make obeisance to it. Then again, should my secret reveal itself as the video feed unveiled, all of the convictions under Clarice\u2019s record\u2026. Well, calling them mistrials might come across as similarly tone-deaf. And damn, I had the thrill of the chase, too. I had this one cornered, ready to play with him because I cared little for how it affected his family or his fortune. But...this.\n\nWhere to next? If I had children, it might have aided me, but then there would be a paper trail. And I saw Clarice freeze. \u201cI assure you, judge, that I simply misclicked a button while searching for the evidence relevant to the case. It will not happen again. I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt better not.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy humblest apologies. I would never make a mockery of this, or any other court. I hope that my standards are much higher than that. May I proceed?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. Now, Mr. Bernard Starr, you tell me that you have never seen these records before. Is that correct?\u201d\n\nBernard Starr, slippery bastard with a fake head of hair and a three-piece suit purchased by trust funds, snorted. \u201cOf course not. You may not understand this, but I have accountants for accountants. Everything is double-checked, and what you have here is a forgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was not made clear to us during discovery. In point of fact, I\u2019d rather say that these documents were incredibly hard to procure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you couldn\u2019t have found them, then how would I have known to?\u201d\n\nTighten and scratch. You are not in control. \u201cWell, in this case, we have a whistleblower. One who willingly stepped forth to provide us with the necessary information. And, as we both know, discovery did prove them to originate from your databases. Isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour lawyers are not contesting this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s their call.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, then. I submit docket LBX-1138 to evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvidence accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo objection.\u201d\n\nI have you, you raven trickster. You act darkly, but I can take in so much more light. But then I see the flicker again. The sudden slit of reality in a spectrum all can see. Damn. Damn. Damn.\n\n\u201cMr Thomas! The court has warned you of this parody. Do you believe you can unsettle the client by transforming to a common housecat?\u201d\n\nCommon? No, that\u2019s not the right reaction. Clarice puts her hand on my lower back and scratches to settle me, but dammit, she\u2019s going to make me purr. Raise my haunches. Off, off, off.\n\n\u201cAre you two in the same room?\u201d Judge Raulston asks.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is she touching you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it untoward?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must disclose your personal relationship to the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you, there is nothing untoward.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the same last name!\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas is quite common.\u201d\n\nAnother flicker.\n\n\u201cThis is the last warning.\u201d\n\nAnd then it happens. The proverbial curtain falls, unveiling the mechanics backstage.\n\n\u201cHe really is a cat!\u201d Bernard Starr barks.\n\nI put up my paws. \u201cI\u2026 I..\u201d\n\n\u201cClarice, what is the meaning of this!\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge, it\u2019s a mistake. A\u2026 a\u2026 hack. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe scales of justice must weigh the evidence. I\u2019ve got none to counterbalance. \u201cI cannot fathom why this is happening. Bernard Starr, what game are you playing at?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Me. You\u2019ve all got me standing trial, and the star prosecutor is\u2026.a tabby? I\u2019d call this a dog and pony show, but\u2026 you know.\u201d At least we all plan to take this in stride. They should gawk at my display of eccentricity. Them and all the observers.\n\n\u201cLaugh at me all you will. I am Chris Thomas. A lawyer at the top of his game. I\u2019ll not stand for your slander. In fact, I\u2019ll sue if you do not stop insisting I am another species!\u201d Oh, this was a mistake. The truth finds its way out of the lies eventually. We were tricked; we tricked ourselves. \n\n\u201cI cannot allow this to continue. Mr. Thomas, you have one day to submit proof of your species.\u201d\n\n\u201cA picture, perhaps?\u201d\n\nHe heard the trill in that last word. Now I have lost him. Either I am sarcastic, not serious, or well and truly a different breed altogether. Maybe someone will take off a mask and show themselves as a dog, but I don\u2019t count on it.\n\n\u201c1 day.\u201d\n\nThe feed cuts, and I turn to Clarice, my ears radaring to her. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Get disbarred? I can\u2019t show at work tomorrow. Or ever again. And this will be all over the news tomorrow.\u201d\n\nI leaned against her and then dropped. \u201cNot helpful. Do you think this was intentional?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I.. oh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed a van across the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Or maybe\u2026 no.. I did. As I fell asleep in the sun. Where they could see. The only living being in this office all day.\n\n\u201cThey exposed us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 we\u2019ve done a terrible thing.\u201d\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s good that we\u2019re legal advisors, because we\u2019re going to need the whole law at our disposal not to end up in prison ourselves.\u201d\n\nYes. Yes, I suppose we will. Perhaps it\u2019s better this way. I must know the truth, and the facts must come out. One slip up can make it better, right? I take a bath. I must think. There is a way to make this all join together as an objective good. I am no criminal, and my only mistake was to represent myself as they saw me. Or some such subjective truth. I lay down to nap. Tomorrow, I will decide.\n\n(Feedback much appreciated)",

And the picture...glitched.\n\nI saw the widening eyes among the jury. The amusement struggling with the disapproval on the judge's face. I looked frantically to the corner of the screen.\n\n*My avatar was gone.* \n\nThis was my worst nightmare. Calliope Kibble, the stately middle aged woman with the severe updo and the statement lipstick, had pixelated her way off into the ether, leaving Callie the Calico staring frozen into the camera. I noted with dismay that my eyes were adorably dilated in terror.\n\n\"Ms. Kibble?\" said the judge, a suppressed laugh threatening to break through. \"Ms. Kibble, can you, erm, turn off the cat filter...\"\n\nThey thought it was a filter! I could have laughed, but I was too flustered. This could be the end of me as an attorney. My life's dream seemed about to slip through my paws.\n\nI clicked the mouse. Clicked again. If I were human I would have been sweating profusely. As it was, my tail fuzzed uncontrollably. The filter wasn't coming on.\n\n\"Meow,\" I said apologetically, and then clapped a paw to my mouth in horror. The translator had gone too! \n\nLaughter was beginning to ripple gently through the courtroom. I swallowed dryly and frantically clicked through windows to update my software. Go, go, go!\n\n\"Ms. Kibble?\" The judge said again, less amused now.\n\nThe download was 50% complete. Thank god for a quick connection. In desperation, I turned off the video and audio feeds.\n\n\"Ms. Kibble, we seem to have lost connection,\" the judge remarked, as the download reached 100%. \"May I suggest you click the camera icon at the bottom of the screen--\"\n\nMy career was flashing before my eyes. Install install install, dammit! \n\n\"Ms. Kibble--\"\n\n*There.* Austere and admirable Calliope Kibble flickered back into existence. I cleared my throat. *Ahem.* Now we were in business! I turned my feeds back on. My tail began to smooth back down.\n\n\"Pardon the interruption, your honor,\" I said smoothly, and the trial began.",

Curriculum pages got dumped where I ate, so I\u2019d collect bits, rehearse in front of a dead racoon, to perfect this technique, and manner in which I speak. Reckless? Practicing law out of a college dumpster? Well, check this:\n\nI don\u2019t stammer in front of the judge, because I\u2019m royal. You can pay me in Tuna and catnip, preserved in tin foil. I like raw fish, or shrimp that\u2019s peeled, then boiled. I\u2019ve lived on the streets my whole life, never been spoiled. Plus, I made something of myself, versus sitting in your lap, coiled.\n\nCats protect from evil spirits. A malicious thought? I can hear it. My senses are superior to humans, you\u2019re nowhere near it. Death threats don\u2019t mean squat to nine lives, so why fear it? I can even leap across a 12-foot gap on a rooftop, and clear it. I\u2019ll take your best attorney, crush their reputation, and smear it.\n\nOn top of that, if you\u2019re most qualified person talks smack on Twitter, when he\u2019s mad, aren\u2019t you a little hypocritical, for being overcritical, of my legal swag?\u00a0\nHave I ever left a client with less than the cards they had? That\u2019s what I thought. You\u2019re jealous a cat mastered law, while you complained your life\u2019s a drag. You can judge me if you want, but I\u2019ve still got this case in the bag.\n\nI can\u2019t be racist, because I\u2019m the wrong species. I don\u2019t profile clients as guilty, the world needs me. My livelihood is tied into this\u2026it literally feeds me. I\u2019ll resign from law the first day an attorney beats me. I am competent, and educated, disbarment would cheat me. If you\u2019re offended by cat attorneys\u2026get the HELL of my Zoom meeting\u2026please leave (hisses).\n\nCat attorneys would fix the system, all over the nation. But if you don\u2019t like me, my associate, Mr. Eucalyptus, MAY have the right Koala-fications\u2026\n\nr/ThePoetZiggy",

He\u2019d been up to something very serious indeed, but there wasn\u2019t time for this. \u201cNow, I know this video isn\u2019t very nice to look at, but you don\u2019t have much of an option, do you?\u201dFunny how this man had no need to show who had taken this video, or why they would do this, because they were in the control of the video. He could destroy everything in the video, but nothing could be returned or destroyed. This wasn\u2019t going to end without a fight. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat me Mr. Bond.

A small box was sitting on what appeared to be a dresser, but Mr. Bond looked inside at what was inside. A file cabinet. He removed a metal detector and a key, leaving only the file cabinet behind. Mr. Bond walked into the trial room, looking for any security cameras at all. It seemed the only thing he remembered was that cameras were the devil\u2019s work in someones court, but the security camera was right there. Installing a security camera in a courthouse wasn\u2019t that hard when, as in the case of this courtroom, the building also served as the county jail. The trial room was extremely crowded, but not as bad as the office block he was being sent to. All of the employees of the building were watching the trial from the large projection screens that surrounded the trial room. The lights were all being shut off",

He counted the stripes. 13 stripes, normal. Blue square in the corner. Fifty stars. Yet he couldn\u2019t stop the shiver that passed through him. \n\nAfter what felt like forever, Buzz joined him. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong. It shouldn\u2019t be moving, and there\u2019s too many stars.\u201d Buzz whispered. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fifty.\u201d\n\n\u201cCount them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Where did the five new stars come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cPuerto Rico could be one. They were considering state hood.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou both are wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuzz, please tell me you heard that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did. It sounded male. I don\u2019t see anyone around though.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t your timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYour timeline is splintered.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeil, I think I just wet myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can never return to your timeline. The Fossa Luminance is closed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBUZZ! SOMETHING MOVED OVER THERE, AND I SWEAR ITS NOT A SHADOW!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep, definitely wet myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBUZZ!\u201d \n\n\u201cI see it too. Run?\u201d\n\n\u201cI CAN\u2019T MOVE!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNEIL! WAKE UP!\u201d\n\nNeil bolted awake, heart pounding. It was just a dream. He took a calm breath and suited up. The airlock opened, and he and Buzz stepped outside. \n\nNeil suddenly froze. Up ahead, the American flag waved.",

I have a bad feeling about this. \" \n\n\"The Lunar module is gone! Collins, where are you?\" \n\n\"...\" \n\n\"...\" \n\n\"Please man don't toy with us...\" \n\n\"Neil, I think we were deceived.\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"I believe this has never been the mission.\"\n\n\"What?! This is insane! We trained years for this. We spent years competing againts the communists. This was all about showing the potential of America. How can all of this be fake? You telling me the war, the space race is fake?\" \n\n\"No, but some of it. Neil, I'm sorry. I haven't been honest with you.\" \n\n\"What are you hiding?\" \n\n\"Back on Earth, during our breaks. I overheard something. In that moment, I didn't think it was a real concern. Our superiors were talking about how the Soviets had developed the necessary tech to send humanity to the moon. It was just a matter of time for them to get here. They were going to win the race. Weeks after, I heard vague rumors of a secret project. A programmed lunar module, sent here without the risks and difficulties of bringing people in the flesh. This module probably planted evidences, hence the flag, so when the commies broadcast their arrival for the entire world, they would only find the humiliation of being defeated.\" \n\n\"But...but we actually won the race. We arrived first.\" \n\n\"I was counting on that. it seems they left us here.\" \n\n\"Why?!\" \n\n\"Our sacrifice will go down in history. America needs heroes.\" \n\n\"We are no martyrs, no heroes! They left us to die!\"\n\n\"We won't be alive to tell them anyway...\"",

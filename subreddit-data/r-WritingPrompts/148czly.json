            "comment": "\"Where's Alfred?\" asked Bruce, his throat dry enough to make his voice sound almost menacing. He struggled to sit up. \"What did you do to Alfred and Dick and -\"\n\n\"Don't you worry about them, they'll be just fine,\" said the Joker as he dropped into the armchair. \"Bruce,\" he said, his red lips turned down. \"Bruce,\" he said again, disgust on his voice. \"I hate that you made me find out who you pretend to be under that mask. I prefer you with your ears on.\" He stuck his index fingers up beside his head, mimicking the cowl's ears, and giggled.\n\nBruce gritted his teeth - no need to keep up the act now, but the disease and treatments were making him weak. He'd tried to compensate, but he could only hold out so long. Now the best he could do was point a finger. \"If you hurt them, Joker, I swear to you I'll -\"\n\n\"You'll what?\" interrupted the Joker, arms flung wide, and he nearly tipped the chair over backwards. \"You'll point at me with your weak little fingers?\"\n\nBruce growled. \"This isn't funny -\"\n\n\"Isn't funny?\" roared the Joker. He pulled at his own hair with both purple-gloved hands. \"Isn't FUNNY? Do I look like I'm laughing?\" He pointed at his elongated, uncharacteristically serious face. \"I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid! Of COURSE cancer isn't funny! Why do you think I'm here?\"\n\nBruce narrowed his eyes. The Joker had many opportunities over the years to learn the Batman's secret identity, and turned them all down. In fact, several times, he'd even stopped other criminals and villains from learning or revealing who Batman was without the costume. The Joker didn't care who was under the mask - he wanted to beat Batman, not Bruce Wayne. As far as the Joker was concerned, any life Batman had without the cowl was nothing more than a distraction. If the world knew that Bruce Wayne was the Batman, the Joker would have to share his toys.\n\nAs he tried to work through what the Joker was doing in his private treatment room of the manor, Bruce tapped and read the braille communication device hidden in his mattress. Dick and Alfred were restrained somewhere else on the manor grounds, but essentially unhurt. Bruce breathed an internal sigh of relief. If they were safe, he could keep the Joker busy.\n\n\"Why ARE you here, then?\" Bruce asked. The longer he could keep the Joker talking, the more time Dick and Alfred would have to get free.\n\n\"Because, my dear Batsy - oh, no no no, this simply won't do. I can't look at you like this. It's so uncomfortable. Just not right. Hold on, don't go anywhere.\" The Joker kicked his long legs up, leaped out of the chair, and spun in place, the tails of his purple pinstriped suit jacket twirling dramatically. He reached into a jacket pocket and pulled out a long bundle of black cloth, bigger than seemed possible for so small a pocket. He snapped the fabric out - a Batman cowl and cape. Gently, reverently, he tugged it over Bruce's head, taking care not to dislodge the intravenous tubes and electronic monitors attached to Bruce's unclothed body, tucking the cape around Bruce's shoulder and out of the way.\n\n\"There,\" said the Joker, nodding in satisfaction and dropping back into the armchair. He crossed his legs. \"Now we can talk like civilized adults.\"\n\nBruce gritted his teeth and asked again. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"Because if this -\" the Joker gestured to all the medical equipment surrounding the bed - \"is supposed to be a joke, it's the worst one I've ever heard. CANCER ISN'T FUNNY. Believe it or not, Batsy, I'm here to help!\" The Joker spread his arms and grinned. \"I've seen the signs. You've been slowing down for years. Getting louder, clumsier. Don't think I haven't noticed the exosuit you've build into your costume to help you keep your strength. The pills and drugs you've been sneaking to keep your symptoms at bay. Frankly I'm amazed you held it together so long.\"\n\nThe braille display updated. Alfred was in touch with Commissioner Gordon; Nightwing was on his way. Bruce only had to stall a little longer.\n\nThe Joker continued his speech. \"I've been all over the world, meeting and kidnapping all the best specialists. Even made some, ahem, arrangements with Ra's, Mr. Icypants, and the Green Meanie. No, not that one, I mean Ivy. Anyway, I'm not just amazed you've held it together, Batsy - I'm grateful. You've managed to stick around long enough for me to find what I've been looking for. Something extra special, just for you.\" The Joker patted his jacket pocket, then the other one, then his pants pockets. \"Oh, drat, where did I - aha!\" From up his sleeve, the Joker pulled a comically oversized syringe filled with a yellow liquid.\n\nNightwing should be seconds away, and the Gotham police department not far behind. \"What are you really planning, Joker?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not planning,\" he smiled. \"The plan is done. It's here. My penultimate victory over you. Not the one I've dreamed of - this is rather ironic actually, embarrassing. I suppose you'd find it funny!\" The Joker held out his hand, like a showman revealing his greatest trick. \"This... is the cure for cancer.\"\n\nDick came crashing through the window, nightsticks in hand, and lunged at the Joker.\n\n\"Wait!\" shouted Bruce.\n\nNightwing stopped, his club inches from the Joker's skull. \"Wait?\" he asked.\n\nThe Joker grinned wider than Bruce had seen in a long time. \n\nBruce narrowed his eyes. He scanned the Joker's face: those too-wide lips, the yellow teeth against clown-white skin, a twisted and disturbing but somehow sincere smile on the face of the Clown Prince of Crime. The Joker was wild, inconsistent, insane - one day a bloodthirsty murderer, the next a cartoon circus clown. But over long decades, two things had always held unshakably true: the Joker never did anything that wasn't funny, and he wanted - no, NEEDED - to be the one to beat the Batman.\n\n\"I... believe you,\" said the Batman. \"Do it.\"\n\nThe Joker laughed.",

            "comment": "\"You see Batsy, I know all about it.  The pain, the anguish.  But I am not letting your measly little pancreas take you away from me, no sir.\" Joker brandished the scalpel, held delocately between his fingers.  The Batman himself was strapped to a gurney, the stomack of his armour cut open and his abdomen laid bare.  \"So, we are going to so a little....surgery,\" the last drawn out in a menacingly insane growl.  He then grinned widely and called out \"Nurse! Lets scrub in!\"  Silence. Joker called out once more, agaim with no reply.\n\n\"Oh, right, shes gone.  Never mind!\"  He cackled and spun back toward his unwilling patient, \"besides, where you are going, theres no need for sanitation.  Or anesthesia!\"  With that he dove in, slicing manically while humming a jaunty tune. Batman strained against his restraints, thrashing wildly in the hopes that the Clown Prince of Crime forgot to tighten a strap.  His efforts only served to weaken him further.  Blood loss, pain and a gaping hole in his belly served to slow and weaken him.  The Bat stopped, conserving his energy and strength for when it would best serve him.\n\n\"You've been off your game my friend,\" Joker stated quietly after a while.  \"Weak.  Pathetic.  Human.  I got worried, so I looked up Bruce Waynes medical files.  Oh, dont look so shocked, I've known for years!  I just didnt care!  Till now, anyway.  Pancreatic Cancer.  Terminal.\" Joker leaned against the gurney theatrically.  \"But I have a solution! This? This was all just fun and games.  A way to pass the time such as it were, while we wait for the main event!\"\n\n\"You see, old friend, I couldn't bare to lose you to something as....mundane as cancer.  Theres only one thing allowed to kill you, and thats Me!\" The last came as a gutteral growl, true emotion showing in his eyes, an unfamiliar amd unsettling sight to Batman.  Joker continued, \"So,\" he began to pace back and forth, \"I temporarily killed our friend Ra's and stole his Lazarus Pit.  Funny thing, the pit.  You dont actually have to be submerged, its just more effective that way.  This way works too,\" Batman felt the slight pinch of a carefully applied hypodermic, not the expected jab one would get from Joker, this being tender and professional. \"Lasts longer this way too.  Stays in your system.\" Joker then refilled and stuck himself with the same needle.\n\n\"Let's head into eternity together.\"",

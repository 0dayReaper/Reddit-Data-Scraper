            "comment": "At first, i wasnt sure what I was looking at. My vision still blurry from the previous nights rest, i now sat up in bed stairing stupidly at the edge of my dream journal, still open to the page id been writing on last night. \n\nId been trying to jot down fragments of a quickly fading nightmare when Id gotten a papercut, which was just enough distraction to drive the last few fleeting details from my mind. I remember mumbling a curse as i stuck my finger in my mouth, tossed the pen onto the abandoned book, and turned over for a few more hours sleep. \n\nAs I rubbed my eyes and looked again, the scene on my nightstand remained unchanged... except for what had been a tiny smear of blood on the edge of the page, now seemed to be a small but robust colony of what could only be described as miniscule Neanderthals. I rubbed my eyes again, and blinked several times, sure that I was still dreaming. However, as my vision cleared, the nano-derthals remained. \n\nRealization of the significance of what i was looking at slammed into me as I sat up and put my feet on the floor. Seated on the side of the bed, i gripped the edge of the mattress on either side of me, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. My heart and mind began to race as my adrenaline spiked, my emotions twisting wildly from excitement, to fear, to wonder, to confusion so profound it boarded on panic. How was this possible? Had this ever happened before? Id certainly never heard of such a thing. A new, spontaneously appearing, race of micro-humanoids would hace to be big news, wouldnt it? Does that mean I'll be famous? Would I be questioned? Held accountable, even? Experimented on?? If so, by who? The government? The FDA? NASA? NATO? MIB?? What about my family? They didnt even know i had a dream journal, let alone that Id somehow conjured a new species of flea sized humanoids. They didnt deserve the sudden disruption this was bound to cause in their lives. Hell, I wasnt sure I deserved it, but I felt some responsibility given that it was my journal...and my blood. \n\n\nBeginning to hyperventilate, I desperately clutched at my hair and tried to gain control of myself. I squeezed my eyes shut, and putting my head down between my knees, I counted to ten while doing my best to draw slow and steady breaths. Feeling slightly better, I opened my eyes and inspected the journal. The little people darted about, industriously building and gathering, seemingly unaware of the improbability of their own existence. \n\nI decided in that moment I needed help. Support from someone who might have an idea of what to do or how to handle things moving forward. There was a natural science museum in the neighboring city,that might be a good place to start. Obviously this discovery needed to be studied, and the idea of passing off the whole thing to someone more 'qualified' than myself was extremely enticing. Who knows? Maybe I could still get on the news. \n\nCheered by this brilliant plan of mine, i hopped out of bed and grabbed my clothes. In a hurry to put this very strange morning behind me, I rushed around getting my stuff together. If I was quick enough, Id make it home in time for lunch. \n\nI grabbed my backpack like i did every morning, operating on pure muscle memory as I began imagining myself being interviewed about my discovery. I unzipped the top, throwing in my waterbottle, pencil case, wallet, and the novel I was currently reading. In my head I began explaining the whole thing to the imaginary news person. I imagined how amazed theyd be, and how Id respond. Theyd probably expect me to name the little creatures, usually the person who discovered a thing got to name it, right? I grabbed my journal and snapped it shut, tossing it into the bag ontop of all the other junk, and searched my pockets for my car keys as I sped down the stairs. \n\nI flew out the front door, not bothering to lock it behind me. Jumping in the drivers seat of my car, I tossed my backpack into the passenger seat and shoved the key into the ignition. As i reached for the door to pull it shut, my hand froze in mid air, as realization of what Id done sank in. I slowly reached for my backpack, and reluctantly reached for my journal, pulling it gingerly from the detritus by its spine. \nWith clumsy fingers, i fumbled it open to the last used page, only to see the tiny red smear had grown to a blot the size of a bottlecap. The stain had bled through to the page behind it. I stared for a long time, looking for any signs of life, not sure what I was hoping for. After a while, I had to admit the page was as lifeless as it had been yesterday, if not moreso. \n\nI let the book drop to my lap, and staired into space for a moment. What now? No one would ever believe me without proof, Id either sound like I was hallucinating or making it all up. I was even starting to doubt myself. \n\nGiving my head a shake, i snapped out of it. I got out of the car and holding my journal in one hand, i grabbed my backpack in the other. As I started to head into the house I had to walk past the trash bins my neighbors had put out for collection. Silently cursing my own forgetfulness, i turned and headed to the garage so i could pull out my bins before i missed garbage day...again. I swung my backpack onto my shoulder and struggled to move the bin with my free hand, still clutching the journal. I stopped for a moment, looking at the cover and thinking about the things it contained. Sighing with resignation, I lifted the lid to the trashcan just enough to slip the journal into the half full bin. \n\nAs i let the lid close, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. Today was my day off, and I had been looking forward to some free time. I finnished dragging the bins out to the driveway, and headed back inside. I was getting hungry, and it was a beautiful day. A perfect morning for making pancakes. \n\n(This is my first bit of writing in a VERY long time, appologies if its awkward but thanks so much for reading!!)",

            "comment": "I never meant to create life, let alone a civilization. I was flipping through my notes and gave myself a paper cut. It burned, as they usually do. I moved on, thinking nothing of it. Then I went to bed, and awoke to something at once peculiar and wonderful. There were dozens of what looked like ants milling around on my desk. I moved closer. I had left not food or water on my desk, what could ants possibly be doing there? Then I realized that the shapes weren't ants. They were intricately folded bits of paper, Not only that but there seemed to be a number of different types of paper creature. Some with two legs, some with four, and some with six. I thought I must've been dreaming. I hit myself in the face, and discovered the pain was very real. Could I be hallucinating while awake? I had no history of such hallucinations. I saw the edge of the paper I had cut myself with the night before. There was a bit missing, the part that had given me a paper cut was gone, and I could see one of the little paper beings ripping into the sheet, and using the paper to make a new creature.\n\nThey had not noticed me yet. I crossed the room to turn on the light, and returned to the desk. The sudden brightness was scaring them, they were running in all directions, having never seen a light so bright. They began to find their calm, though, and after a few minutes they resumed what they were doing before. Then they noticed me One stopped, looking upwards towards me, then two, then three. Until all of them were transfixed by the huge being standing over them. We could not communicate with words, I had no idea what language they spoke, even if I could hear them speak. They resume their business, though I still see one or two look up at me occasionally.\n\nI head out, and return to find that they have continued to grow. They have little structure made of paper and a number of different types or castes of paper creatures with different specialties. They are growing exponentially, consuming more and more paper with every hour. I have decided that I will refer to them as folds\n\nI buy paper to fuel their growth. They exhibit curiosity, making a daisy chain of paper to reach the wide expanse of the floor of my room. They are building increasingly elaborate structures, and even an assemblage of my face reminiscent of the Nazca Lines. I try to teach them words, using a pencil on a blank sheet of paper to write the alphabet. They are fascinated by it, but do not show any sign of understanding. It is unclear to me how many different senses they have. They can touch and see, but what about taste, smell, or hearing?\n\nThey make assemblages of paper in the shape of the letters I wrote, but do not form coherent words. Emptying one of my mechanical pencils, I supply them with some pieces of graphite. In a few days, they are using it to write symbols from the alphabet I introduced on themselves and on inanimate pieces of paper. They have no concept of English words, but seem to be creating their own language using the symbols of the English alphabet.\n\nI try to think of more ways to add enrichment to the lives of the folds. I give them various colors of glitter, which they develop a type of art with. I crush some crayons and give the pieces to the Folds to let them use more colors than boring graphite black. They are building a city of structures far larger than the usual size of individual Folds. They are also making outposts at various other locations in my house. I have to be careful not to step on any of them or their structures. As the days pass I am excited to see how their art, language, and culture develop. Perhaps they will one day even come up with things like science and philosophy. Maybe we will even get to the point of understanding each other's languages.",

            "comment": "I was taken to the palace when I was 8 years old. That's the age everyone gets tested. Luck is always the last thing they check for. It's usually a stat no-one pays much mind to. One in ten-thousand people score above 55, so if it comes back higher than that it's noteworthy, but no-one expects it to. My older siblings were both gifted with intelligence, Tom with a 78 and Nora at a stunning 86. My whole extended family threw a huge party to celebrate Nora's results. Receiving a score above 80 in any stat is a virtual guarantee that person's life will be lived a cut above the rest. She was enrolled in the world's most prestigious university at the age of 11, and was offered full tenure as a physics professor just six years later.\n\nThere was no party thrown after my results came back. As it was, the results were all that came back. I was taken directly from the chair I was analyzed in, to the palace. Everyone that scores 100 on their luck stat is taken here. They calculate that one in a million people receive higher than an 80 in their luck stat. There are exactly 13 of us in the palace. Every person in the world known to have a 100 on their luck stat resides on this small swath of land in North Sumatra. We want for nothing, save freedom. The finest doctors in the world perform regular health examinations on each of us. Food from around the world is flown in daily, and is prepared by a rotating pantheon of chefs who consider it the pinnacle of their career to perform their craft for us. The latest in entertainment technology? No whim or desire expressed by one of our thirteen residents is ignored, and only one request will ever be denied.\n\nSome of us live out our life in pure hedonism, taking full advantage of the fruits of other people's labor and talent. I can't truly blame them, being bereft of freedom tends to leave you with a grudge against your captors, no matter how gilded the cage. We're to be kept alive as long as possible though, so those who over-indulge find themselves on the receiving end of the world's most energetic life coaches.\n\nPersonally, I just want to be away from this place, but there's no escaping. It's not because of the lake we're surrounded by, or the guard towers and patrols that dot the landscape just beyond our view. Odds are good they'd never manage to catch us if we really wanted to avoid them. It's because of why we're here. We sit atop what geologists have identified as \"the last great super volcano.\" It should have blown its top, and approximately 98% of humanity with it, over 300 years ago. Someone got the bright idea to relocate the world's luckiest inhabitants right on top of it, as a \"hail Mary\" attempt to prevent the end of the world. So far, it seems to have worked. \n\nI live on the Toba caldera, along with the world's 12 \"luckiest\" people, and for everyone's sake I must never leave.\n\nEdit: Wow! My first ever gilding, and then you guys made it twice as nice. Thank you!!!\n\nI did not expect this kind of a reaction. I want to flesh this story out more, but I'm up at 3 am with my 4 month old son, so time is at a premium right now. If I'm able to do a part 2 I will update this thread.\n\nThank you all for your amazing feedback, support, and for just being awesome!",

Thank you for pointing out my mistake.\n\nI am flattered by the time you took to analyze this attempt at a story opening. I just jammed it out over my lunch break, and I almost threw it out because I felt like it came out half baked.\n\nI wanted to color in the main character's family and the world in general in more detail. I felt like it I would be more engaged by the story as a whole if there was more description to what attributes are tested for, how it's done, how the top and bottom of society are treated, and so on. Without all that, I worried the whole thing would be resting on the hook about the volcano. \n\nI will reread your insights multiple times, and continue to feel unworthy of your positivity and time, but I will enjoy it nonetheless!",

I was one of the few with a full score of 100.\n\nWhich would have been great, if bad luck wasn't a thing. The thing with the luck rating was that it was basically a rating on how much 'chance' would get fucked up around you. People with single digit luck could plan out their entire *year* and have not a single thing derail. Planning on a trip? Not a single random happenstance would occurre. No accidents, no sudden horrible weather, nothing.\n\nThose of us with 100? We could try to walk from our bedrooms to our bathrooms and end up going through two localized apocalypses, a kidnapping, and rescue an alien princess from an alternative dimension, then still make it to the restroom before it got too uncomfortable holding the piss in. We where literally walking time bomb of 'anything and everything' going off every other day.\n\nWhich was why I was in prison. Though really, prison didn't even begin to describe this place. A box would be more appropriate. In fact, the place actually was a box. A box inside a box. Each inmate were placed inside a hollow metal cube three meters long on all sides, then the cubes themselves where stacked inside a bigger metal box, which in turn... well you got the idea. There was no vents, no electronics, nothing that could accidently go wrong or otherwise malfunction. Just solid metal covering solid metal.\n\nWhich was to say, everything went wrong pretty much instantly. When they placed my box, the vibrations caused as they fit it in place resonated with my right wall and shattered it to bits.\n\nIt's been a month after that. Two new inmates where added. Tom had a strawberry seed stuck in his shoe that sprouted and tore the top off his box, and Sharon just kinda fell out of the box. She hasn't been able to fall back into the box though, so she lives with Amy now. \n\nIt's not a bad life. We have food(somehow) and water(for some reason), plenty of intertainment, and we don't end up screwing someone over because we're next to them. I don't think anyone really wants to leave, and frankly, neither do I. Knowing our luck, we'll probably end up going back out sooner or later... but until then, I think we're all content to stay here and relax. For now anyways.\n\n",

            "comment": "You ever heard of plot armor? How your favorite heroes get out of ridiculous situations despite there being no good reason for them to be able to succeed? 100 luck is like having plot armor. You can\u2019t die. You can\u2019t lose. People wonder at how bad luck fits into the equation, and simply put, at 100 you have no bad luck. At 1.... well, they usually don\u2019t even make it out of the womb. \n\nThat being said, I have 100 luck. Not bad, right? I could do whatever I want and succeed. If I wanted to do brain surgery I could close my eyes and swing at the patient\u2019s brain with a sledgehammer, so long as I want them to live and heal, somehow it\u2019ll go right. There\u2019s a lot of capacity for good, a lot for bad. A few years ago someone with 100 luck threw a dart into the air aiming for German chancellor\u2019s  head... while they were sitting in Hawaii. That dart rode the wind currents across the world right into Berlin where it blew the chancellor\u2019s head off. A dart they half-heartedly tossed while sipping a fucking mojito. \n\nThis was rare, since most 100 luck people are thrown into jail. Myself included. What I\u2019ve been trying to figure out is how this prison at the bottom of the Atlantic is fair or lucky. I got my answer when the world exploded. Someone got uppity with the nukes, one thing led to another, now our air tight prison is floating through space. Pretty lucky to be the only survivors. On top of that, we have 500 males and 500 females on board our little slice of life. \n\nI\u2019d say we have a good shot at repopulation, especially since each guy has a gal and each gal has a guy. Everyone has fallen in love perfectly with one person that nobody else loved. Big shocker here, one couple already had a kid. Okay, whatever. Thing is, she has a 100 luck rating as well. I\u2019d venture a guess we\u2019ll all be having 100 luck kids. \n\nI was worried we\u2019d run out of food, but a warehouse full of it somehow crashed into our big home and created an air tight seal. We estimate a good 30 years out of it. It\u2019s not a problem until it\u2019s a problem, you know? I\u2019m kind of assuming we\u2019ll crash land on some world lush with life and perfect for our survival. A literal paradise. I\u2019ll be honest, the future seems bright. Hell, I bet we could even conquer the universe. \n\nEdit: Part 2 is up! https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8uu474/comment/e1ir4bh?st=JJ0IWUHY&amp;sh=0aa9d3dc\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m going to work on a Part 3 later today, I\u2019ll shoot replies to those of you looking for it. It will likely take the form of an HFY post just for organization and depending on how far I want to bring this. ",

                    "comment": "\"We should've started rationing food years ago, Mark.\" My wife, Jessica, stares me down as I stare at the inventory for the last of our supplies. I guess we got a little cocky when it came to our luck, and more specifically, our food. We all agreed that we wouldn't need to feast or anything like that. But everyone could eat normally. Being lucky we would always just say, \"Hey, we'll get food some other way, it's fine.\" Now... give or take ten days and we run out of food, easy. Unless we ration, that is. I sigh and put the tablet displaying the inventory down. \n\n\"Let's call a meeting.\" \n\nTwenty minutes later and everyone is there. At least, all of the adults. And out of those adults the ones who actually care. All told, there's around 800 of us in what we refer to as the council hall. It's just an IKEA that smashed into our home, but it makes for some pretty comfortable discussions. 30 years does a lot to a community. We didn't decide to embrace some sort of no government system, so we've got an open forum. Direct democracy and all of that. After the first few years, it straightened out real quick to have the same people. Me and my wife represent the more reasonable side of the council. We've got the more or less dedicated support of 300 other members. As such, my wife and I have the responsibility of food distribution. \n\nThen there are the \"free birds\" as I like to call them, but they just call themselves lucky. \n\nIt may sound a bit conceited to call yourself lucky among hundreds of other lucky people, but that's kind of how they operate. They just bank on being lucky and it works out. Their speakers are Gavin and Luke. They're a couple. Both of them are kids born within these walls, being 25 and 27 respectively. Them being straight would have thrown off our food projections from 30 years ago, so it was real lucky that they wouldn't be having kids. The lucky total around 270. This puts them in the range that swing voters might actually let them challenge us. That's partially why we never started rationing. The most landslide vote we've ever had, 637 to 123. 40 abstaining. Incidentally, I was one of the 40 which my wife has never let me live down. I just remind her that her side got absolutely thrashed. Back to our golden boys, Gavin is a good guy. Friendly and likable, but then almost all of us are. Luke on the other hand has always been... a bit more lucky than the rest of us. Not in any way significant, but something always pops up. An extra kernel in his popcorn. He never gets a bad tasting jelly bean. Hell, he can even find Tupperware lids and lost socks. It has definitely gone to his head, and he's got a fair share of sycophants to back it up. \n\nSo what about the others? Well, we've got around 227 of the \"humanists.\" They act under the assumption that really, among all of this luck you can't really be lucky. It has to stop somewhere, so we have to be careful. I don't blame them. This has been a scary process. Going into it I was 17. Now I'm 47 and my hair is starting to turn gray. Sometimes it really did feel like we were normal people trying to figure things out. I think they're wrong to worry, though. They've always been wrong. A manual has always turned up. Some tools, supplies, clothing, you name it. You can't help but wonder though. A stopped clock is right twice a day, so maybe they'll be too. Their leaders are Charles and Bethany. Charles is the type of guy to introduce himself as Charles but insist on being called Chuck, and Beth is kinda... spooked all of the time. Luck can fix a lot of things, but sometimes it just can't make diamonds from dirt. \n\n\"Alright, thank you for showing up on such short notice.\" I stand in the middle of the concrete path between the kitchen displays and furniture. \"We have to have this discussion so everyone knows ahead of time. There are roughly ten days of food left, eating at our normal rate.\" My words lay a palpable silence down upon the room, until laughter breaks out. It starts from Luke. \n\n\"That's what you call a problem, Mark? We called a meeting for this? Now, I know I wasn't around for it, but refresh my memory, how much food did you have left when the warehouse showed up?\" He asks me, smiling. It reminds me more of a wolf baring its teeth than anything else.\n\n\"A week eating at a rationed rate. Some breathing room, but we were beginning to sweat.\" I answer, shrugging. I can see where he's going with this.\n\n\"So then we can reconvene in three days. If by some miracle, we don't get more food, then we can put in place rationing. Frankly I'd rather have seven days of real meals left instead of seven days of rations to make this decision.  I motion to end this meeting right now.\" He sends a prompt to all of our e-bracers. For a lot of us, we grew up wearing these. They functioned like smartphones attached to your wrist. At least, after some modifications. They were originally designed to make sure we were good prisoners. Here in the council hall, they could be used to tally a vote quickly. YES on a green background, NO on a red background, and ABSTAIN on a gray background. Simple and effective. \n\n\"Now hold on just a minute, before you vote, we should really talk about this now. If you want to have wiggle room, now is the best time to do it!\" Chuck calls out, but it's too little too late. I watch the YES votes tick up slowly but surely, as the conversation in the room begins to rise. \n\n\"Have you ever wondered...\" I look around the room, motioning for silence, \"...what happens when two people with 100 luck fight? Not the kind of scuffles Larry and Ahmed have over the last donut, but a real fight?\" Of course they have. It's a taboo topic since, well, we don't want to kill each other or even risk it. Thing is, if one of them doesn't want to fight, luck will make it so that they won't. It's one of the few situations where wills can be directly opposed and from my understanding, one force of luck gets cancelled out. \n\n\"I know I have,\" I continue, spinning slowly to look around the entire room, \"and I know how it ends.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAlright, I might continue this in a Part 3 or over at HFY. Thanks for the support and ideas, there's a lot of places to go with this. Cliffhangers, am I right? ",

                    "comment": "What you\u2019ve gotta understand is that the last 30 years have been a pretty constant strain on our luck. We\u2019ve had to avert quite a few crises, including but not limited to: aliens, neutron stars, black holes, space pirates, and much more. \n\nLuck has saved us, asteroids smashing the space pirates to bits, the aliens getting sucked into a wormhole, the neutron star averting direction to clear an asteroid field we were heading towards, a lot happened these years to keep us safe. We didn\u2019t experience many problems. \n\nExcept once, when a alien survived and landed on our ship. I ran into it in a corridor. Somehow he\u2019d gotten a universal translator, and we got to talking. He wanted us to surrender the ship. Now this guy was big. Seven eyes, a long snout with a tongue dripping acid hanging out, and standing on a dozen tentacles with arms holding a steel girder. I was confident my luck would hold, so I told him to go screw. \n\nAs if on queue, a screw burst from one of the doors, barreling at the alien. In that instant, the girder bent around his arm, stopping the screw dead in its tracks. So, it was here my brain starts working. This thing survived its ship exploding. The girder it was carrying miraculously became malleable to block a rather fast screw. It looks a bit surprised, or as surprised as I can tell from an alien. I was pretty sure this thing, whatever it was, had luck. And I honestly didn\u2019t know what to do. So I did what anyone would do, grabbed a fire extinguisher off the wall, and threw it at him. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what happened here, but I have a few theories. The alien was thinking about killing me, not surviving, so the extinguisher filling him with shrapnel when it suddenly exploded made sense since he wasn\u2019t willing his luck to keep him going. It would also explain the piece of metal that hit me in the body cavity. Hurt like hell, but it didn\u2019t kill me, because I was thinking about killing him and getting out of this alive. I like that theory. It makes sense, and given that we have 100 luck it follows the our will can change how luck works. \n\nBut there\u2019s  another theory. One that I don\u2019t like. Mostly because I\u2019m afraid of what it means. Maybe our luck is finite. I mean some 9 lives nonsense, but in this case we\u2019ve got a handful available to us for a while until we can handle more. So this guy surviving his ship exploding, the vacuum of space, entering our ship, a screw flying at him, it was all too much. It puts, \u201cyour luck has run out\u201d into perspective. We survived Earth exploding. Then every potentially lethal event came after much time had passed. The warehouse creating an airtight seal after hitting us instead of venting out air. The IKEA doing the same thing weeks later. Then all of the other hazards I mentioned. I would have to guess that it has something to do with time. Either that, or our collective luck. One of us can only do so much, but a prison full can make mountains move. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s a combination of both, the group luck being slightly diminished in every one of us as our will motivates our luck to save us. \n\nI looked over the now shredded alien as I let the piece of metal in my gut sit. It didn\u2019t hit anything vital, by the way. This was a few years ago so I\u2019m all good. I think. I made sure to take a blood sample and throw it in a luck tester. As I suspected, it displayed 100 luck. \n\nI relayed all of this to the council, leaving out my theories on what luck could do. It makes me sound that much more impressive. Then I showed them the last piece of evidence to support my claims. I took out a luck checker, pricked my finger, and showed them. After I killed that alien, something interesting happened to my own luck. \n\nOn the screen, the number 105 shone brightly. I\u2019m reasonably sure that I inherited a portion of its luck when I killed it. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense in my mind. I\u2019m not sure how effective this has been, honestly. 100 luck is enough from one person to change a lot. But the collective luck has been preventing me from fully exploring this new limit. \n\n\u201cBullshit. It\u2019s a trick.\u201d Luke says, frowning. \u201cLet\u2019s get another one of those out here.\u201d Someone just happens to have one in their pocket. Lucky. First, Luke tests it. 100. Chuck tests it. 100. I test it. 105. \n\nEveryone is slightly taken aback. Frankly, this is a play for me to take control. I want to give our luck a collective goal. Maybe then something will change. I want out of this prison, and if we all want to smash into a paradise world, we will. I think. \n\n\u201cI think we should focus on finding a habitable world. Aren\u2019t you all tired of this place? Hell, I\u2019m pretty sure almost all of us haven\u2019t seen a real tree in person. Enough of hoping for food to fall out of the sky. Let\u2019s take things into our own hands, really test what our luck can do.\u201d That\u2019s all I say before putting it to a vote. Yes means we go world hunting, and hopefully find one before the food runs out. No means... we just sit. After all these years, the idea of us staying for more time nauseates me, though it\u2019s never bothered me before. I\u2019m not quite sure why that is, but I do know I want out.\n\nThe vote passes almost unanimously, 768 in favor. It\u2019s time we took a new direction. ",

If I had been lucky, why was I born to a poor family? I never got to play games of chance, since those were forbidden to luck score 100s. \n\nThen the revolution happened. The leaders swore they would prove that people controlled their own destiny, that luck had nothing to do with success, and, as proof, they would throw the 100s in prison as an ultimate sign of human triumph over the odds. Having a lower rating began to be a mark of pride, an inspiration. \n\nSome of us tried to run and hide. That\u2019s what I did. I managed to hide a while, too. It was, ironically, just bad luck that they caught me. The guy whose identity I was using\u2019s brother happened to be a member of the Luck Police, and he was visiting relatives across the country the day he caught sight of my fake name on the ID I gave the clerk at a convenience store. \n\nI couldn\u2019t have lasted much longer, anyway. They had just created the AR rig that let you see people\u2019s stats just by looking at them. None of our underground community knew how to fool it. It updated in real time. \n\nSo, off to prison I went. With all of the other \u201clucky\u201d ones. That\u2019s when I met Eddie. Most of us, at this point, had our ideas about the system. Most of us thought it was complete bullshit, created so that the people in control could make an enemy to unite people around. Eddie, though, he had a different idea. He swore that it was real. He said he had been a scientist and had helped develop the measurement system, and swears they had gotten it right, but it was hard to argue with the evidence. All the luckiest people wind up in prison, so how are we lucky again? Even locked up as one of us Eddie swore it was true. Even talked about how coming across the measurement at all was a lucky break. He had been studying DNA for a marker for gambling addiction, when he found the luck gene. \n\nEddie was right. I still remember hearing the whispers. Carl was a 96 now. The AR rig swore it. I was with Eddie when we saw Carl, and through the rig, we could see it too. Right beside him: Luck - 96. It was an odd color, though. It was green, not white like normal. I asked Eddie about it. He frowned. \u201cWe had theorized that there were things that could give a temporary boost or penalty. Luck clovers, breaking mirrors, and things. I guess the research on those is complete, and they programmed them into the rig?\u201d\n\nI looked at Carl and there, behind his ear, I saw it. A four leaf clover. But those were supposed to be... I saw the look of horror on Eddie\u2019s eyes as he did the same calculations I was doing. The green luck boost. It moved his score down. Eddie shook his head and stared at his feet. \u201cThe sons of bitches. They got it backwards. It\u2019s like a golf score. Lower is better. We are stuck in here because we are the most unlucky bastards on the planet.\u201d",

I mean sure, I believe that the government hands all new parents an official \"Succinct Test Assessing Tendencies\" packet, but I've never let anyone else define me. My path is of my own making, and I have only myself to blame for my current situation.\n\nIt really is frustrating. People think that luck is this all controlling thing - a \"free ticket\" to an easy life. But is isn't. High strength doesn't let you lift houses. High intelligence doesn't let you make inventions that violate the laws of physics. I'm just...a little luckier.\n\nHonestly, the most annoying thing is probably being banned from all forms gambling. Most games operate on razor thin margins, and an extra 5% chance to win a coin flip is enough to wreck their business.\n\nThe problem is that humans don't understand probability or randomness. Don't believe me? Fine, do this. Make up a list of the result of 20 coin flips, and write down \"H\" or \"T\" for each one. Make it look random to you. Now, flip a coin 20 times and write down the actual result. Reply with both of your strings (don't tell me which one is which), and I'll bet you I get it right almost every time.\n\nSo yes, the \"luckier\" candidate won 3 out of the last 5 elections. Yes, that is 60%. But there was no reason to blame those of us with high luck. We aren't criminals or a danger to society. We're just people, worth of dignity.\n\nBut I guess we're here for a reason. Luck is being in the right place at the right time, even if you can't see it until later. My path is here, and it is mine and nobody else's. So the question isn't \"should I be here?\" but rather, \"why am I here?\"\n\n___\n\nIt's been a year that feels like a century. I still don't know why I'm here. Maybe it is to learn from others how to use our luck. But how? For what purpose?\n\nI feel like the answer is drawing closer. We don't get much news, but things seem to be breaking down. Shortages. Riots. Taking away the outlet of the people's discontent doesn't actually solve any of the underlying problems, so things are surely starting to bubble over.\n\nThere is a meeting tomorrow, a big gathering of all the \"prisoners\" with the warden. Rumors flying around. We're being released (what luck, right!). We're being executed. We're finally being told why we are here.\n\n___\n\nMorning. Time for them to tell me why they think I'm here. I still haven't decided.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sure you have felt without luck this last year.\"\n\nI'm not sure. I know I did at first. But I've learned more than I thought possible from being around my kind. Our luck makes learning skills a little bit easier too - takes just a small bit of the \"edge\" off of the initial failure that comes before success. Maybe that's my path - to be a \"lucky learner?\"\n\n\"I am here today to tell you that you are the luckiest of all citizens. For you were sent here with a purpose. \n\nYou don't yet know this, but our world is drawing to an end. Our odds of survival are dim, and it was decided that the luckiest among us would have the best chance of survival. And it will soon be up to you to forge a new path across a dark and unforgiving terrain...\"",

I'm not particularly confident, but I'm going to guess that number 1 is true random and number 2 is fake. This is because:\n\n* Number 2 has an exactly even balance of heads and tails. While it is possible that this occurs in a random distribution, human distributions tend to balance out like this way more often than true distributions.\n\n* You avoided the most common/telling trap of not having a sequence of 4+ H's or T's in a row. Most people think that this looks \"nonrandom\" when in reality a sequence of 20 flips will quite often have at least one pattern of 4 in a row that are the same. BUT, sequence two has 4 H followed by 3 T's - this is a common sign that humans get \"scared\" by having just put down a bunch of H's and so in turn put down a bunch of T's to balance things out.\n\n* Sequence two has a long string of perfectly alternating T's followed by H's. Humans often think this is random, but in reality it isn't.\n\nWell?",

In any case, those that have as much luck as we can get are forced to be here...\n\nWatching through the bars I see inmates laze around in their cells. They\u2019re not allowed to do anything where skill is a factor, because their luck would render the necessary skill redundant.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame too, the stories I hear about some of these guys. One tried to run for office but was discovered to be a \u201cClover\u201d when he won the election in a landslide of 51/49% by 1 swing vote.\n\n\u201cClovers\u201d, what a childish but accurate way to refer to us. But that\u2019s what happens when you make it too obvious.\n\nNow we\u2019re stuck here, forced to watch the \u201cBlack Cats\u201d, the 0 Luck people, as they\u2019re dragged into cells. I have to make my rounds soon on the prisoners soon... last week by a stroke of luck I discovered a very unfortunate attempt at an escape tunnel...\n\nBut that\u2019s why I\u2019ll always be stuck here... forced to use my luck to keep the unlucky stuck.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for 1k upvotes!

To the narrator, it's just another group name, like hipsters, or surfers, or nerds, just a slang term that describes a loosely defined group of people.  The second use of the word clover is appropriately placed in quotes because the narrator is musing about the word itself.",

            "comment": "I lean back against the wall of my cell in confusion, my mind blank with bewilderment. As a lucky man myself, I know a coincidence when I see it, and this is most certainly not. Am I not the only one who could see other's luck rating? That would be the logical conclusion, seeing all these people blessed by fortune, sharing the same binds as one another. However, where does that conclusion leave me? Why would someone actively be imprissoning the worlds luckiests men and women in one prison? Besides, I still don't even know why I'm here in the first place. One moment, I was enjoying my gifts at a cassino in Utah, on my way to Vegas, and then I'm beimg escourted into a van by armed guards.\n\nThis was far from a fortunate happenstance, obviously. Perhaps I could escape these walls, but by what means? I can't dwell on these thoughts for long, though, as I am soon taken out of my temporary holding cell and into my permanent home. As I pass by, my eyes widened as I witnesed what this prison had to offer. Instead of an oppressive cage built for the filth of society, it resembles more of a hotel. I pass by game rooms and swimming pools, all with the prisoners smiling and at peace. Further down the hall, I catch the inviting smell of fresh cakes and other sweets, which I figure originates from the cafeteria. While these tantalizing perks of the prison catch my eye, in only further tangles the yarn ball that was once  my train of thought. This place wasn't a proper prison, so why am I being kept here?!\n\nDays pass, and I begin to see how things work down here. All prisoners are assigned a job, and in my case, I had gotten tasked with preparing food for the cooks, which to no one's surprise, was quite fortunate for me. After all, it's a job I've had before, and hardly stressful for me. For doing my job, I do get paid, and am allowed to spend my funds on various arcade machines in the game room, swim time, courtyard time, so on and so forth. Even without working I am guranteed 3 warm meals a day, which are filling and positivily delicious. No one could complain about being here, it's a utopia! No one, except me. The life of luxury will not be enough the calm my curious mind, or distract me from the very reason I was put here, or rather the lack their of. Perhaps it's not a wish to be free, but simply to know the truth, wherever that path leads me.\n\nMy plans have already hit a roadblock before they began, however. It took me only a week to notice the pattern everything follows. The prisoners are woken up at 7 AM on the dot, daily, and we are required to verify our person at the door by checking our fingerprints, only after are we allowed out of the cell. Metal detectors lie just outside of everyone's cells, making sure no one brings contraband in or out of their cells to begin with. Roll call begins after, with searches on everyone's cells taking place during that time, as well as maintanance on the detectors. After which, everyone's esquorted to their jobs, and after that, we're given free reign to roam the halls, but always under constant supervision. Why is it that security is so tight, when the prison itself is rather lax? Only then does realiziation hit me like a piano attop a cartoon character's head. Nothing here is left to chance. Absolutly nothing. If I'm to escape, I'll need far more then luck.",

Those born with lower scores often lead unlucky lives and often fall victim to unfortunate accidents. \n\nMe I was one of the luckest of all, a 100, from a young age everyone knew I was destined for greatness.  One teacher in school said I might me the next president, another the next Bill Gates. However I was always a risk taker and loved pushing my luck to its limits. When I was 16 I robbed my first bank, the vault door was left wide open, the security camera's out from a freak outage. It was a thrill to temp fate. Over the years I used my luck to make bank, I could enter the most secure places and make off like a king.\n\nThat is until one day the impossible happened, I got unlucky, caught red handed with the Crown Jewels of England. I was tried and sentenced to life in a maximum security prison. Though this too thrilled me, as a prison break may be the most challenging task yet to press my high luck. Only when the guard locked me in my cell, what I saw was impossible. All the other inmates in my block all had luck scores of 100 just like myself. No matter what I tried my luck failed me, no open doors, no power outages, no holes in security opening up for me to exploit. \n\nI learned from my cell mates that my story was theirs, they lived a life of improbable luck until one unlucky day they ended up here. Nothing anyone tried could free them from this prison. This place was built so that nothing could get out. \n\nHowever what I failed to understand at the time is that we where the lucky ones, nothing could get out of this place, but that also meant nothing could get in. Outside our iron corner of the world things where falling apart. Talks where breaking down and war was on the horizon, soon everything would be destroyed.

It'd been hard to find the energy to do much -- including being gentle with her lunch -- ever since she arrived here.\n\nIt took her half a day to realize what had happened, how she'd been captured and why she'd been dumped in this pit. Rage consumed her for the first twenty four hours, followed quickly by helplessness, and now a justifiable depression.\n\n\"It'll get better,\" Julie offered as she sat down across the table. Dana had no desire to continue discussing the situation. She had no desire to do much of anything.\n\nBut she had to talk to someone, and her options were limited. \"This isn't how my life was supposed to go.\"\n\n\"You and me both, little girl.\" Julie's voice was light and without rasp. It always caught Dana off-guard that a woman so old, who'd spent most of her life trapped in these walls, could maintain something that sounded like optimism. \"But it won't always be like this.\"\n\nDana shook her head. \"You said no one's escaped. Never even been released on parole. And it doesn't sound like that's changing anytime soon.\"\n\nJulie's eyes revealed no emotion but empathy. \"It's harder for you. I can see that. Successful thief who never faced a pinch you couldn't slip away from. Damn, even when you found out you were coming to this Hell-on-Earth, you figured it was only a matter of time before you were out again. How many centers have you busted out of?\"\n\n\"They never even got me to the facilities,\" Dana said with a touch of pride.\n\n\"And you didn't think they were going to figure out that you're a Lucky eventually? That they'd eventually send the service after you? You're too smart for that.\"\n\nDana just shook her head. She knew Julie was right, but that wasn't what really bothered her. \"But this place...\" she gestured aimlessly around her.\n\nJulie nodded. \"No light. No field time. The food isn't worthy of swine and the guards are going to make you hate every day of your life. But it'll get better.\"\n\n\"How? How is that possible?\"\n\n\"Not for us.\" Now Julie couldn't help but keep a small tremor out of her voice. \"Little girl, this is our fate, I'm afraid. But for the others like us, it won't always be like this. Living in fear that once they discover you're a 100, they'll lock you up and throw away the key. It's a story as old as time itself. Damn near every civilization since we were walkin' and talkin' has done it to someone else -- a different religion, just looking different, or simply being born in the wrong part of the world. People persecute what they're afraid of. Always have, always will.\"\n\nDana shook her head. \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"We were to born before the world understands and accepts the Lucky. But humans change. They learn. It takes them sometime and they often make a damn mess of it along the way.\n\n\"You and I, little girl, we're going to suffer. But maybe a guard becomes sympathetic, or a warden has a change of heart. Maybe our story gets out, the world finds out about this place and what we went through. Then things will change -- they always do -- and it'll get better for the other Luckies out there.\"\n\nA banging rang out and reverberated off the small rooms steel walls. It was one of the guards, standing on an observation deck above them, banging his gun on the metal railing.\n\n\"Mess is over! To your spots!\"\n\nDana and Julie stood up. The lights in the dining room started dimming as the two prisoners prepared to leave. No reason to wait -- after all, they were the only inmates there.\n\n\"Why us, Julie?\" She wouldn't see her again for another day, not until their next meal, and her heart ached for some sort of wisdom.\n\nBut Julie only shrugged as she looked Dana in the eye. \"Bad luck.\"\n\n\\--------------------\n\n10/365\n\none story per day for a year. read them all at [r/babyshoesalesman](https://www.reddit.com/r/babyshoesalesman)\n\n\\--------------------\n\nedit: some grammar errors that make me doubt my own literacy",

They must have had low-luck ratings. Most 100s have low-luck parents. I was brought to this maximum security prison only hours after I was born. \n\nIt didn't always feel like a prison. I was nursed by volunteer mothers who could still produce breast milk. There were other infants that I played with and grew up with. As we got older, there was less and less play time and more solitary time to ourselves. Once we were old enough, we got a cell that became our new home. For, well, forever. \n\nEvery inmate wore an ankle cuff. Scientists figured out a way to \"turn off\" our luck, so to speak. And once it's on and our luck is gone, there's no way to get it off. They are made of the strongest metals on earth. Nothing will break these.\n\nExcept a solar flare. Of course, I didn't know that's what happened until years later and I still don't have an explanation as to why.\n\nIt was 4 am. I couldn't sleep so I was listening to the rumble of snores around the prison. Then everyone in the prison simultaneously beeped. \n\nThe sound was so soft that, if it occurred during the day, no one would've heard it. But in that 4 am silence, I was the loudest sound in the prison. Even over the snores.\n\nI never knew what being lucky felt like before. It was stripped away before I could even have memories. But the feeling that rushes through my body seconds after that beep left me breathless. \n\nI knew it was my luck. I knew I could escape. And hopefully, no one else was awake and trying to escape either. \n\nI started to fiddle with the ankle cuff and it nearly fell apart in my hands. I removed some wires that hopefully disabled it and then reattached it to make it look like it was still on and functioning.\n\nI've never had better sleep in my life.\n\nBy the time I woke up, everything seemed normal. There were no alarms. No missing inmates. It appeared as know I was the only one who knew what happened last night. \n\nThe hardest part should've been pretending like I didn't have my luck back. But who am I kidding? It was the easiest thing in the world.\n\n'Cause I'm lucky.\n\nI understand why they lock us up. Us 100s. I could've murdered someone and no one would've seen it.\n\nThere were no eyes on my as I was walking around. My luck caused them to always look away when they came close to looking at me.\n\nI walked straight out the front door into a world I had never seen before. \n\nI don't know when my ankle cuff fell off.",

It wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe problem is, a luck rating like that tends to warp the world around you. For everything to always go your way, someone else often must pay the price. Even worse, you don\u2019t get to choose what the world decides you need. A single stray thought could result in catastrophe happening all around you. Like the time when a sudden ice cream craving caused a mid-air collision between two 747\u2019s, startling a woman who saw it enough to knock her AC unit out of her apartment window and crush the owner of an ice cream cart at the top of the hill. His cart rolled right at me but halted abruptly when that Wall St exec tripped right in front of it, breaking his arm. I would have just paid for the damn ice cream, but I don\u2019t get to choose when I\u2019m gonna be \u201clucky\u201d.\n\nThe relief when the Council of the Odds finally found me was insurmountable, even knowing that it wouldn\u2019t last. The cell they put me in was barren with nothing around me. No padding, mattresses, entertainment, or even a toilet. It was heavenly, even though I knew it couldn\u2019t last. I knew with time, luck would find a way to get me out. As I settled in, I heard a faint crash in the distance followed by hundreds of clicks. My door creaked open. Apparently, 777 prisoners was too much for the Luck Agents to contain.",

            "comment": "I was turning 14 when they had taken me in the prison called the Citadel. A large fortress stationed on top of Mt. Fortuna. \n\nThe prison was well-managed. All the prisoners there were aware of why we had to be there. We were considered to be flawed creations, mutants of society. Some, like me, didn't take advantage of it but a handful used their gifts to its maximum potential. No matter what we did with our gift, we were all taken in as prisoners. \n\nMost of the prisoners heavily relied on luck to live their lives outside of this prison, but in the Citadel, we were all equal. For some, it felt like a favor for them that they'd get to experience a somewhat normal life because their encounters are limited only to those that have the same gifts as they do. On the otherhand, most people, including me, just wanted to get out and live life like how we used to.\n\nAll prisoners in the Citadel were under life sentences for the birthright that we were given. Since the day that we were brought in, we lived in the Citadel and would eventually die in the Citadel. That meant that the only way to get out is to escape. It seems easy considering that we all have a perfect rating in luck, but as I've mentioned before, we are ALL equal in this prison, including the one and only warden here, Lady Luck.\n\nLady Luck is the only entity that is capable of keeping us locked in the Citadel for she herself is the embodiment of luck. The ebb and flow of luck merely depended on what she wanted to happen, and in her 200 years of being the warden, she has never let a prisoner escape alive. \n\nA lot of prisoners have tried. Some have tried climbing the great walls of the Citadel only to step on a loose brick and end up falling down the great heights of Mt. Fortuna. Some have tried to sway Lady Luck into their side so that the tides of fortune may flow with them. Some have even tried to kill Lady Luck and claim freedom for all the prisoners alike.\n\nIn my 12 years in the Citadel I have made careful observations. I thoroughly plotted my escape and have planned it out for too long to fail. I made sure that I was going to get out and see the light of day. Through my keen observations I have found a small window of opportunity, the only day that Lady Luck sleeps and relies on her mortal men to keep us prisoners locked in. \n\nThis is the story of how I escaped the Citadel during Friday the 13th.",

            "comment": "\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky to be alive.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a surprise to hear. I had always been lucky. In fact, ever since I was born, all I encountered was luck. Always being at the right place, at the right time. When I was little, Mario Party was my favorite game. I won every time. When I turned 18, I bought my first lottery ticket and won the whole goddamn jackpot. I used the money to travel the world, investing just one percent of my $25,000,000,000 winnings (lump sum, of course) into a cryptocurrency I had started years earlier as a joke. I met celebrities everywhere I went, I could always get a cab, and somehow my cryptocurrency took off and I made back trillions more than I could ever imagine. I was happy, successful, and I had ambition. \n\nThe stats ruined everything. \n\nSometime after I had made my way through all of the Asian countries, ready to embark for the Pacific Islands, a British scientist by the name of  Dr. Killion discovered the statistics. He theorized that every human being had a ranking, from 1-100, for 56 different statistics. Skill, Intelligence, Communication, the list went on. Each statistic represented the maximum potential for any individual in that area, except one. Luck. It was the only statistic no one could understand, and everyone wanted their luck to be high. It seemed that it didn\u2019t measure potential, rather it just measured the amount of coincidence that appeared in someone\u2019s life. Those with a low luck score tended to excel in other areas, it usually balanced out. I had a perfect score of 100. Sure, my communication was in the trash, and my intelligence was only in the low twenties. But it didn\u2019t matter. Everyone could understand me, they all believed I spoke to them with my simple wording and EVERYONE encouraged me to be a politician. Until the stats. \n\nOnce people started getting their stats read, everyone wanted to know their own. Everyone went and got it done. Most people averaged around 50 for about every score, those who scored higher in some also scored quite low in others. Those with incredibly high scores in a few categories would also be inept at many aspects of life. I stopped in Japan, at the world\u2019s top quality Statistics Center, to get mine read. I\u2019ll never forget the look on the technicians face. Horror. It wasn\u2019t long before I was grabbed, tied up, and shoved in the back of a van. The van broke down a couple times, I know we definitely changed vehicles a couple of times because I felt an engine explode and at least 4 different popped tires. The prison doors wouldn\u2019t open, one of the guards recognized me and even tried to help me escape, but it seems I was destined to be behind bars. My existence was wiped, my identity removed from society. I was allowed to live comfortably in the prison, but I got lonely as the only prisoner. No one came to save me, no other 100\u2019s ever appeared. I was lucky enough to be the only one with such a high score. \n\nI remember my 28th birthday. Someone had asked me the day before when my birthday was, and as luck would have it, it was the next day. Someone was sent out to get a cake, and lucky enough, it was my favorite flavor. I sat miserably as I ate the whole cake, and even got my favorite guard to let me watch some videos on her phone before I had to go to sleep. \n\nI didn\u2019t even try to escape anymore. It was fun at first, but even luck can\u2019t save you from every situation. I couldn\u2019t escape, so I looked for the little things. It wasn\u2019t until that day, 28 years after I had taken my first breath of fresh air, that I realized things wouldn\u2019t get better. All I\u2019d ever have is the little things. And it wasn\u2019t enough for me. \n\nAs I heard chimes outside indicating midnight\u2019s arrival, I kicked away my bed, using the sheets as a makeshift noose. Luckily, I got the knot on my first try, despite not even knowing how to tie it. \n\nI woke up out of a coma four months later. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be alive.\u201d That\u2019s what the warden said. And it was the moment I realized my luck had run out. ",

            "comment": "All of us saw the bizarre irony of the situation. The luckiest people on the planet, all confined to a maximum security prison in a highly classified location. We called it The Institute.\n\nLuckily (heh), it wasn't a standard prison. We were confined because our luck potential made even interacting with us fundamentally unfair. People with lower ratings simply COULD NOT compete with us. \n\nScrabble? Every set of tiles was a Bingo. Uno? All Wildcards and Draw Two's. Goldeneye? Guess who spawns at right by the Rocket launcher and body armor. That's right. Us. EVERY. TIME.\n\nAny game that relied on random chance was automatically in our favor. \n\nEven contests of skill were skewed. See, our good luck doesn't improve our skills....but it DOES make our opponents more prone to maladies. \n\nMy roommate has the unfortunate distinction of beating Olympic gold-medalist in a footrace. Easily. \n\nSure, she took WAY longer than the Olympian would have, but the Olympian just so happened to take a nasty fall right out of the gate. It ended his career, and when no one could see ANY reason for him to have fallen where, when, and how he did...people began to suspect foul play.\n\nThis was back when we were just getting the hang of stat identification. WAY before we truly understood the societal implications. If we even understand them now.\n\nPeople just weren't willing to accept a life where they were totally inferior to a select group of people just because a genetic quirk made those folks extremely lucky.\n\nOnce the scanners were invented, people with maxed out luck ratings could be easily found, sequestered, and confined.\n\nWe were all in there together. Men, women, children...old people..didn't matter. If you've got a max luck rating, you stay here. It's not bad by any stretch. \n\nVery few of us are criminals, and the ones who are got that way because they were spoiled by their ratings...if you spent your entire life getting away with EVERYTHING, why wouldn't you? \n\nSo, the aim of the place was rehabilitation, comfort, and protection. I've been to resorts that were crap by comparison. The food is awesome, the amenities are incredible, and no one's been shanked, shivved, or any of that. \n\nYou'd think that we were here so the rest of the world could be protected from us. You'd be wrong. Like I said, people have this really interesting thing with fairness. \nThey know life isn't fair, but when faced with that reality embodied in a person they simply CANNOT outclass, things turn nasty.\n\nAnd when you attack someone with a max luck rating...you're going to end up hurt.\n\nThe guy down the hall? He came from a rural town where people had begun to suspect his luck rating was too high when all their attempts at hate crimes ended in serious injury or death to the perpetrators.\n\nOf course, they didn't learn. A mob formed overnight, went to his house, and attempted to burn it and him with it.\n\nHe woke up the next morning, refreshed, with a veritable sea of smouldering rednecks on his lawn. He actually called The Institute and requested a scan. Sure, he picked a bad spot to settle down, but he wasn't stupid. He had begun to suspect too.\n\nSo we're here to learn how to function in a society of equals, and we're here because if we weren't, humanity might wipe itself out trying to exterminate us.\n\nIt's interesting seeing what this sort of advantage can do to a person. See, if you put us all together, we're all equals. This is as close to \"normal\" life as any of us is going to get.\n\nKids took to it the easiest. They didn't grow up just beating everyone in everything...or they didn't have enough time outside to get used to it. They socialized pretty easily. \n\nTeenagers and adults took it harder. You spend your formative years incapable of losing or suffering consequences, and it'll alter your perspective. They eventually adjust, but for awhile, they behave like raging narcissists.\n\nOld folks took it the hardest. You try spending 50+ years OWNING life, only to be told that your accomplishments were due to nearly illegal levels of luck, and your entire self-image falls apart.\n\nThere's The One Guy who actually lucked into a bunch of cash, a tv show, and a pretty high political office. For the longest time, people thought we'd fallen into an alternate reality.\n\nBut once the scanners were invented, some mope got a pocket-version and ran it on The One Guy during a rally. He managed to get close enough to use the scanner before getting gunned down, but the **100** readout was clearly visible to everyone in the room and tuned in. The One Guy was collected and sent here pretty much immediately. The guy with the scanner went in the books as a hero to the world. \n\nI'm sure he'd be jazzed had he lived. I kind of wish he'd had a higher luck rating. Even getting that close to The One Guy was an accomplishment.\nUnfortunately, he didn't have a high enough score to survive the experience. But we're all grateful for his sacrifice. \n\n\n\nSo all of a sudden, an entire country\u2019s  political system was in disarray, and the world understood just how broad the implications of the ratings could be. \n\nYou take someone with a high enough luck rating and a low enough intelligence or empathy score, and this person could legitimately end the world. And the sad fact is, if left unchecked, a high luck rating over a long enough period of time will absolutely erode your other skills.\n\nWhen you rely on luck, all your other skills, like kindness, compassion, intelligence tend to atrophy.\n\nI guess we're lucky we caught The One Guy in time. He was doing well, but he was fucking things up pretty badly for everyone else.\n\nWe started debating how many historical figures may have had max luck ratings. Alexander The Great? Hitler? \n\nOvernight, scans went from being used in suspicious situations to being globally mandated. And the folks who scored too high got sent here.\n\nAnyway, we thought our luck had run out, having been ripped away from our families, friends, and lives. But it wasn't bad. \n\nIn fact, it was the best place for us.\n\nA few months ago, isolated cases of a new disease started popping up. First in Latin America, then the U.S., then Europe. With global travel being as widespread as it is, most of the people on the planet are dead or dying.\n\nExcept us. We lucked out.\n\n",

            "comment": "The intake was as expected - a bit rough, a little too handsy, and a small inkling that the guard liked me a bit more than was necessary. I'd heard of full body cavity searches, hosed down with icy cold water, being pushed naked and wet into rooms of other people. You know, general Hollywood type stuff. \n\n\nI managed through pretty quickly. While I WAS searched and hosed, the water was warm and the search not too thorough. When my papers had been finished they dropped me into the general population out in the yard, sun shining on our banana yellow jumpsuits. Jailed for being lucky - what a crock. I doubted I would be there long, things always went my way and I had no intention of rotting in a cell for the rest of my life.\n\n\nLuck rating tests were given out to every 18 year old. It was presumed that before that your rating could fluctuate too much, and stabilized in your 17th year. Nobody knew what happened to the 100s - well, I do now - and I assume all the 1s died pretty early in life. Such is luck.\n\n\nA rather handsome man walked up to me, standing awkwardly in the middle of a bare patch of ground. His smile was warm, and he genuinely didn't seem to be much of a criminal. Not many of them did. \n\n\n\"Another 100! Welcome!\" He broke into a trot, and held his hand out to mine. \"Been a while since the last, figured it was starting already.\n\n\n\"What was starting?\" I asked, taking his hand cautiously. \"Why have none of you left yet?\"\n\n\nHe shrugged. \"None of us want to. Free food, free housing, comfortable rooms, the food isn't THAT bad, and a constant routine that changes just enough to not drive us crazy. It's nice.\" He motioned to the rest of the inmates. Odd groups here and there, there seemed to be about 20 of us. \"As for what's about to start...\" He paused, and grinned like he was about to drop the punchline to a big joke. \"I guess you'll see. Any day now.\"\n\n\n\nFade - yes, he legally changed his name to Fade - seemed to be the most outgoing of the 100s in the prison. The guards were more relaxed around him, the other inmates joked with him, and he got extra food in the canteen. A natural leader, where I preferred to stick to the shadows. A perfect first friend to have, since I hated the attentive eyes of the Warden. \n\n\n\nIt was the fourth day after I arrived that the sky started to fall.",

I never really studied, but somehow once I put pen to paper it was like the answers just flowed out of my brain and to my hand. I was quarterback too. Every time I flung that ball into the air, it spiraled spectacularly into the receivers hands. I always knew I was a little different in those regards. I think my parents did too, and they taught me well enough not to fuck people over. You see, everyone has a luck rating. It ranges from 1 to 100 and you don't get tested until you are 21. We all knew at some point before my birthday that I was up there on the scale, but no one thought I would end up in prison...\n\nNo one really knew what happened to people who were perfect 100's. It was all speculation. I mean there are some unlucky fucks who literally get hit by a plane falling out of the sky, and then ones that are constantly scamming their way through life without any consequences. I was neither, but I went down to the Department of Human Affairs as soon as I turned 21, got tested and immediately thrown into to prison. No trial. No explanation. Just my cell. Like I said. What irony. \n\nThey never actually told me what I rated, but at this point it was pretty obvious. I know, I know. You're thinking if I am that lucky, just walk out. It happens all the time. Every fucking day. An inmate walks out through some stroke of ridiculous luck and one of the guards will fire their rifle in the general direction of an unseen inmate escaping and well, it's never a kill but they are certainly not walking anywhere after that. The only logical thing is the guards are just as lucky. Why didn't I get chosen as one of them. Like I said. I don't fuck people over.\n\nThe prison is not as bad as media portrays in movies and television. A lot of these people are not criminals. Just got the unluckiest luck rating. Most days I sit and wonder what separates us from the 99's. They could easily exploit just as much as us Perfects can. Personal gain, or otherwise. It might not be dangerous here, but for fucks sake it is boring. Most of my life I've always been able to entertain myself. I remember once going for a walk in the middle of the summer. I saw a 100 dollar bill laying on the edge of the woods and walked to grab it. Something caught my eye in the thick of the trees and I found a nice little lake that seemingly no one knew about. It was my special place. I wish I could go back. \n\nI'm waiting for some answers, or if nothing else something to happen. If this luck thing is real, when the fuck is it going to come back. Does it run out? Does it go dormant? I have a small barred window in my cell and the sky is turning black. It is going to storm. The first one since I've been here. Maybe this could be a stroke of luck for us Perfects. What irony. \n\nEDIT:Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors. I really liked the prompt but I'm on break at work and did this on my phone, when I would much rather have my laptop. Thanks for reading or any comments. \n",

            "comment": "It was the worst thing they could have done to themselves, but they couldn't stand having us around.  The lucky ducks.  The ones who go from one disaster to another, never being seriously injured, always surviving, having life handed to us on a silver platter.\n\nSo they built a prison in which nothing was ever left to chance.  They found every one of us, and slowly but surely, locked each of us away.  They never realized that they were dooming their entire existence.\n\nThe more of us they locked up, the crazier the world got.  Bombings, tornadoes, hurricanes, plagues, wars, you name it, it got worse.  They figured that there must still be lucky ducks loose in the world, so the witch hunts got even more extreme.  Rolling two 20's in a row was enough for your neighbors to turn into a lynch mob and hang you on the spot.  Of course, they never stopped to think that if you really were a lucky duck, they'd never get to hang you.\n\nFinally, they had us all in one spot.  For miles around us, everything went smoothly.  Lives were perfect, no one got sick, everyone met their perfect match.  Outside that zone, it was a never ending nightmare.\n\nYou see, they'd locked up all their luck.\n\nNothing could ever get too far out of whack with us around, it would have interfered with our luck for something too bad to happen.  A lot of scientists had come to study us.  Sure enough, one of them invented a nuclear shield that could cover the entire zone.  Another a matter transformer, no lack of materials or food.  Still another, an endless power source by tapping another dimension, no lack of power to run everything.\n\nWe were completely independent of the rest of the world.\n\nFinally, it happened, global nuclear war.  We're the last of humanity, outside is a raving nightmare.  And the scientists finally figured it out.  They broke us out of that perfect prison, and gave us wonderful homes at the edge of the zone.  As we live there, the land becomes habitable again, we spread further out.\n\nWe're going to repopulate the world, one lucky duck at a time.  Every child we have is checked, nearly every child is a lucky duck.  That's what happens when both parents are lucky.  The ones who aren't still live a better life than anyone else ever did in the old world, because now the luck is evenly distributed.\n\nEvery local problem is brought to us.  If we can't solve it ourselves, it gets put to the entire lucky congress.  Problems get solved though not all profit by it.  There's still bad luck, but it's never too bad.\n\nIn a way, we're still in prison.  We cannot leave our assigned area, but we live like gods, because everyone knows we're *their* luck.  Their ward against bad things.  Their safety blanket in an otherwise cruel world.",

            "comment": "I've always been lucky. I don't mean that in some sort of vague, intangible sense. I mean I'm protagonist lucky, the contrived kind of lucky that would make you roll your eyes and put down the book. The having a personal deus in my machina, Jesus levels of karma kind of lucky. So you're probably wondering how the hell I ended up in prison, and more than that, how the hell do they keep me here?\n\nWell, predictably, they picked me up in Vegas. Casinos are the bread and butter of people like me. A casino might as well be an ATM when you have the devil's own luck. Some of us are smart enough to try to hide it, of course. Pick less obvious games to win. On wall street the bandits have two arms, and everyone is quicker on the draw. It's easier to conflate luck and skill in a place like that. I'm not that clever. In the casinos, it's all luck, and that's how they get you.\n\nI got picked up about a week into my binge, living it up in the MGM Mansion after having arrived in town with about a hundred dollars to my name. It was stupid, I know, but like I said I'm not that clever, and I was pretty high at the time. When the world has had your back since the day you were born, you don't exactly get into the habit of being careful. \n\nLuck is a super power, especially when it's turned up to 11. People like me, we don't do responsibilities. We don't do preparation, we don't do planning, and we don't do consequences. We aren't a leaf on the wind, we are the wind, a god damned force of nature. \n\nAnd that really is the crux of the matter. When they picked me up, there was no fire, and no brimstone. Just a calm judiciary in a black robe explaining that people like me are too dangerous to have around. That if you could lock up a tornado or imprison an earthquake, you should.\n\nSo they put me in here, with the other lucky ones. It's not too bad -- the food's alright, there's activities, and most of the people are great. I like having folks around I can relate to. Well, some of them. Half of them, to be precise.\n\nYou can't really build a prison for people like us. There are no walls, no doors, no routines or mechanisms that can contend with what we've got. So they didn't try. As far as maximum security goes, this place is pretty bare bones, and that's all they need.\n\nHalf the inmates here are like me, lucky as all hell. The other half, well, they're just about the most unfortunate bastards you'll ever meet. If the world bends over backward for us, it squats right down and shits all over these guys. The kind of misfortune that shapes you at your core. The world's been using them as a punching bag so long, all they can think about is striking back, and they have the criminal records to show for it. I mean that literally -- these are not the kinds of people who get away with things. Hell, with their luck, they don't even get away with stuff they didn't do. \n\nPrison isn't doing them any favors, either, especially not being trapped here with us. For every winner, there has to be at least one loser, and in this place that all works out pretty much exactly the way you'd expect. The proximity just makes it more brutal. I'd feel bad, except there's nothing I can do. If I try to do them a good turn, it cancels out. Not good, not bad, just nothing. If it goes against our nature, it just doesn't occur.\n\nAnd that's the key to this place. You see, it has a unique rule: If we get out, so do they.",

The deep elevator that went down level after level to a giant vault door to where they kept us. Nuclear waste wasn't buried as deep as we were. We were the \"lucky one-hundreds\".  The ones with unbelievable luck. The ones with too much luck, apparently. Grabbed by men in vans and hoods thrown over our heads and whisked away to this \"undisclosed location\". \n\n\nI was here because I was too lucky. I've won the equivalent of 25 people's college tuition from half court shots. I'd won the lottery 7 times, the Masters three years running (because there were the only times I'd competed) and so much more.  \n\n\nToday was visitation day. Somebody, perhaps some high powered politician hoping we'd be of help to him if we ever got out of here, had arranged a visit by the Brazilian Bikini Team. There were 45 of them.  (I guess they had alternates, too?) Just after they got into the complex, the lights flickered. The visit went well enough, they just sort of danced around a bit. \n\n\nWhen the time came for them to leave, the radio calls to the surface went unanswered. We came to find out that everyone outside had lost their damn minds and every leader who had them launched every flipping nuclear missile they had.  The whole world outside was uninhabitable, at least for the next 20 years.  Being as remote as e we were, we could cut it down to 15.\n\n\nWe also came to find out, this was the US Congressional safe bunker, because, where else would you want to be when the crap hits the fan than with people like me?  Well, it seems that luck only applies when you are where we are, so not a single official made it. It was stocked with everything we'd need for 75 years for 1000 people.  We had about 53 souls in all.\n\n\nThere were no signals from anywhere else in the world.  Here we were, stuck in a bunker... with the Brazillian Bikini Team, having to restart the world's population. Lucky us...",

            "comment": "\"I didn't do it.\" That's what they all say in the klink, right? \"I was framed! I had a bad lawyer!\" There's not a single guilty man in Florence ADX supermax federal penitentiary where I'm currently serving 15 life sentences for shooting up a mall. But I'll tell you a secret. It's true.\n\nEver notice how some people seem to rise effortlessly to the top? That was me. I fell backwards into opportunity, money and women. I was promoted over my peers over and over, my enemies failed and their lives ruined while I floated on a cloud of pure luck. Their envy was palpable, but I was untouchable. I moved in social circles of power and prestige at a young age, still impressionable. I rubbed shoulders with CEOs, presidents and movie stars, I won't mention names but a very famous Hollywood leading man shared information on a tax shelter through a fake religion he was a part of had saved him millions of dollars over the years. I just had to play along with the bullshit and reap the rewards. Of course I would. I'm untouchable.\n\nI went to the church headquarters in Florida with my famous friend. They treated him, and by extension me, like royalty. Women, fancy cars, drugs, anything we wanted. They assured me my first $30,000 set of \"lessons\" would be returned minus a ten percent cut, much better than any tax lawyer could get me, but I needed to go through the motions. I let them strap their bullshit \"technology\" to me, a kind of \"reader\" strapped to my head, with wires running to a box with readouts and controls. They had me run through a series of tests, predicting drawn poker cards, predicting dice throws, coin tosses, on and on. I of course knew the correct answer but I didn't want to raise suspicions so I \"got it wrong\" a few times. They seemed very pleased with my progress. \n\nThat's when things got... fuzzy. I remember being at a church event, full of glamorous and powerful people flashing their teeth, a charismatic and energetic leader expounding the virtues of the religion and wealth. Then I woke up here. In Florence in a six by eight cell in solitary. The guards tell me I snapped and shot up a mall. 52 people dead by my hand. I've never even touched a gun in my life. My name was all over the news, I was a \"gunman\". I was guilty. I didn't do it. \n\nI woke to the sound of my cell door clanking open. Along with the usual smell of sweat and piss, I could smell cologne. Two guards stepped in and pulled me off the metal slab that served as my bed and onto my feet, holding my arms tight. The church leader stepped into the cell and said, \"Congratulations. You are one of the very lucky level 100 percenters we've found.\"\n\nI tried to shake the guards off but they held on, fingers digging into my arms. \"Don't feed me your bullshit. Why did you do this to me? You know I didn't do it.\"\n\n\"Oh your crime is much worse than what they are saying on the news. Yes you never killed anyone, in fact those 'victims' were just actors, the security camera footage of their 'deaths' the best Hollywood special effects money can buy. No, your crime is you're too lucky.\"\n\nI stared at him. Those tests. They knew my secret. \"Look, I know I am. That's not a crime. We can make a fortune together if you could just let...\"\n\nHe held his hand up. The smug little shit had a smirk on his face. \"It's far too late for that. Usually we just disappear the very lucky. But in your case, every effort to kill you failed in some way. We went through twenty three assassins--the best in the world--all dead through misfortune and accident. So yes, we framed you. All things considered it was probably the luckiest outcome for you.\"\n\n\"But why?\" I said. \n\n\"Luck is real as you well know. It's a commodity. There is a finite amount of it. And you have been very, very lucky, haven't you?\" He stepped closer and jabbed a finger into my chest. He sneered. \"Every good thing that happened to you means someone else suffers defeat, and accident, an illness, a death. And you were greedy. Too greedy. So we decided to put you on a karmic diet, so to speak. In here. You'll be safe, your status as a 100 percenter will guarantee that. But you will no longer deprive the rest of us, or *me* my portion of blessings. We who worked hard for power or wealth can't have the lucky taking that which they didn't earn.\"\n\n\"Look I can, you know dial it down, I can...\"\n\nThe leader waved his hand dismissively. \"We can't take that chance. You'll stay here with the other 100 percenters, besides, you are a mass murderer. Remember?\" He laughed and walked out, the guards threw me on the floor and followed. The cell door slid shut. \n\nThe leader stopped and turned around. \"I'll be back later for some stock tips. Maybe we can arrange for some female companionship if you play along, maybe you'll get lucky.\"",

            "comment": "I'll be the first to admit that my life has always been pretty easy. Born with a luck score of 100 and a charming smile, I learned fairly early on that I usually could get my way. Coin flips, card games, tests; you name it, I was naturally good at it. I was good at doing things without trying, but even better at keeping people from noticing that something was up. And for years, I was content with acing tests and winning small lotteries, things that anyone with drive and a luck score above 60 can do. \n\nBut eventually, I got bored. And I started doing more. Pickpocketing, robbing banks, scamming con men on the streets. It was practiallly child's play, with the way wallets would fall onto the street in front of me, cameras would short circuit the moment I walked into banks, and weathered con men wiuld somehow forget to pocket the queen of hearts. But it was exciting to know that I could get away with things right under their noses. I loved the thrill. My life was perfect. Until it wasn't. After all, perfect luck means nothing if other equally lucky people set out directly to oppose you. Then, it really is a coin flip. Which I now have had a taste of how it feels to lose. \n\nAnd this day, I lost the biggest coin flip of my life. Her name was Sharon. Blonde, optomistic, brand new to the task force, and somehow managed to get put on my case. Another 100. She was tracking me for barely a day when I lost. The alarm in the store went off as I was out the door, and we ran into each other. It jumpstarted her career, and it ended my life.\n\nObviously, I was nonplussed when she caught me. After all, I am perfectly lucky. I was sure my case would get thrown out, or I would find a way to escape. That is, until I found out where I was going. Maximum security, made especially for people like us, she said. There was a task force of other 100s that spent days finding every vulnerability, until nothing is left to chance. Being lucky is useless if there's no luck involved, after all.\n\nThe most cruel part is, nearly no one tries to escape, because there's a simple way out. None of us are allowed to talk to each other, but every day, a 100 guard will give us an option: to stay, or leave. Ifwe all choose to stay, we get to all leave. If anyone chooses to leave, they get to, and everyone who chose to stay is stuck. But if everyone chooses to leave, we all stay. The fucking prisoner's dilema. It should be a no brainer to get the luckiest criminals in the world to get out. Especially under one common goal. But the paranoia sets in. Fear of letting your trusting luck be used against you by a more selfish inmate. Fear of a guard coaxing a prisoner to break the mold, in promises of freedom. Hundreds of, well, 100s, pitted against one another, rendering their luck null.\n\nNo one confined in this prison has ever left, because every single person behind these bars wishes to leave every single day.\n\n\n\nThis is a little rough, so I apologize. It was a really fun prompt, though.",

They hope that magically their number will change when they wake the next morning. They pray that the little tattoo on their wrist will jump from a 20 to 40. 40 to 60. 60 to 80. But that\u2019s all it is. Silly prayers that amount \n\nWhat they don\u2019t know is that I wish I could have my Grace plummet. I envy anything below 60 because they live a life of freedom. They live with some sense of normalcy. But if you\u2019re born with that 100 tattooed........ you are truly the unlucky.\n\nThat\u2019s where I am. Those who are unfortunate enough to be born with all the luck in the world...they\u2019re sentenced to a lifetime of imprisonment. Why, you ask? \n\nWell we can easily blame our predecessors that carried the same affliction. They abused their Grace and there were no checks and balances. Kingdoms, empires, countries, they would rise and fall in decades. But now..governments have an iron fist on the Grace system. Even worse, you don\u2019t have to be the top millionth of a percentage in the human race to be in the same prison. This maximum security prison houses 32 others just like myself. It doesn\u2019t exactly patrol itself. You have to have a 88 Grace number just to be a janitor here. Staff is minimum 92 Grace. The guards here probably carry at least 97\u2019s. \n\nIt\u2019s funny. You look at their face and see a mix of emotions. Contempt. Jealousy. Anger. Fear. It\u2019s almost as if we aren\u2019t human to them. I can\u2019t help the way I was born. I get it. We can commit terrible crimes to humanity. But we can also do so well...\n\nI think the people around me forget that they are mere degrees of being on this side of the fence. Oh well. Luckily for me, I plan on getting it of here soon. Because just my luck, I saw something I wasn\u2019t supposed to. One of the guards was new, and they were moving one of the roommates. Of course, as anyone would, he made an attempt to flee. As they scuffled, the new guards sleeves slipped. And I saw his Grace number. A 79! 79 Grace?! That man shouldn\u2019t even be mopping the floors, yet here he was holding us back. And he saw that I noticed too. The thing that gives me so much courage? The fear in his eyes as the realization set in. He knew what I knew. With my luck, all these guards are under qualified. Which means I have a shot at escaping. ",

None of it matters to us. Some even question whether we can feel sorrow or despair. How would you test that? They tried, once, early on. They tried to cause us pain. Tried to cause us sadness. \n\nThey simply couldn't believe we already felt it. They couldn't comprehend that what we want, and what is good for us, and what the world *wants* for us, aren't always consistent.\n\nI knew a man, once. He was lucky, like me. But that was the only similarity. He was a smart man. Well, we're all smart here, but he had a preference for the abstract. Philosophy. It drove him insane. How could he value anything, how could he gain any sense of self worth, when nothing was because of him? That sort of ennui is common in prisons, but for us? Constantly watching from inside our heads as they try in vain to extract what makes us so special, to replicate it, to stretch it to its breaking point. \n\nHis breaking point was the sixty-second time they tried to kill him. At least, the sixty-second time we knew about. This was the first time we know of that they tried to play two 100s against each other. Trying to find a system so perfectly deadly, impossible to malfunction, that one or the other would *have* to die. That luck would have to make a choice.\n\nHe was hanging there for 45 days, watching the bodies pile up. Anyone who attempted to approach the controls just... Died. Over and over, it didn't matter how high their score was. They couldn't match his 100.\n\nEventually, they chose to send me in. A fellow prisoner. A fellow... Subject. They were truly grasping at straws. I stepped over the bodies, radiating outwards from the panel at the centre of the room.

In those eyes, I could see a sunken depth of exhaustion. A pool, infinitely deep, calm and still, but with a sense of foreboding and... Anticipation?\n\n\"Finally.\" He sighed. It made me jump slightly. I didn't expect to be able to hear him through the glass.\n\nHe smiled at me weakly. \n\n\"They sent one of us. Please. Do it.\"\n\nAnd now, luck played its final, beautiful card. Because as I raised my hand, and looked at the man I was trying to execute, it dawned on me.\n\nAs I walked out, I thought about the room. I thought about the switch, against the wall, right next to the door into his chamber. I thought about the harsh, bright light, the cool white tiles, and the calm, quiet man perched in the centre of the room on a small stool.\n\nAnd I thought about the door, plain, simple, and unlocked.\n\nSometimes, when I'm sat in my cell, wondering what experiment will face me next, abd begin to question why any of us are here, if our luck is so good. Then I smile to myself, and think about that man, still sat in his room. \n\nI guess luck does have a bigger plan for each of us afterall.",

I tripped all the time, when somebody in class was left behind on a field trip, it was me, and to be honest with you whenever something bad happened, it happened to me first and worst.\n\nSo it didn't surprise me at all when I scored 100 on my luck test. That was the unluckiest thing that ever happened. Like all people with that kind of luck, we're supposed to be imprisoned because of the danger we posed to everyone else. The only problem is that I'm only here because I'm so unlucky I scored a 100 on that test.\n\nBut the really weird thing is that everyone else here is exactly like me. They're all tripping all the time, getting themselves injured, nearly dying. One of them contracted the bubonic plague! That was wiped out a century ago, and there was nothing we could do for him. It was an antibiotic resistant strain. He didn't die, of course. He lives on and constant misery.\n\nNow you might think that somebody would notice how unlucky we are and let us out. That would be wrong. The unfortunate thing is that every time a guard comes around the guy with Bubonic plague feels a little bit better. Every time something unlucky happens to me, by freak accident the cameras cut out. It's almost staggering that the guards are always looking exactly the wrong way at exactly the right time to make my life miserable.\n\nSometimes I wonder what it would be like to be one of the lucky ones who didn't score 100 on this test. They're probably wandering around out there somewhere, living life to the fullest. I bet they scored a perfect 50 on the exam, dead average.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to pry my head out of this bear trap. It fell out of a plane that have been misdirected here during a storm. It's on pretty snug, so I feel pretty lucky about that, because, you know, it could be worse.\n\nCouldn't it?",

All the others, the unlucky sub-tens and the 95+ popstars and everyone inbetween, they were living their lives outside, free and happy. We could see them, every day, on the huge screens mounted in the center of the vast empty space between our cells. While we were sitting in solitude on our stainless steel beds with the thin mattress, munching on the stale white bread that was delivered every morning and evening through a tiny opening in the glass cell front by a complicated system of robotic arms, we watched. People working, sleeping, dancing. Eating huge meals, celebrating with their families. Having sex. Having children. Happiness and sadness and freedom, captured by webcams from all over the world, switching between different countries and cities every hour. Showing us what we we would never have. Mocking us. Mocking our perfect luck. \n\nI resented them. I resented every single person I ever saw on those screens. \n\nUntil that day three weeks ago.

And if you solely rely on your luck to breeze by in life, you're more likely to abuse that luck and exploit the less lucky. \n\nMichael was definitely one of the later, or at least, he had been. After being found, tested, and brought to the Facility, a level playing field, he learned, albeit a little slowly, the thrill of risk. Here he could play games of chance and not know if he was going to win. The thoughts of exploiting less lucky was boring to him now. There's no thrill in that, no risk. He was happy to stay at the Facility and help other prisoners adjust to Facility life. \n\nMichael flicked his knife shut as the front gates opened up. A compact, nondescript, black sedan entered the Facility. The other 100's in the courtyard stopped their activities to watch the vehicle pull up to the admittance building. The front doors opened, and two men black suits left he car. One man went around to the back door while the other approached Michael. He nodded.\n\n\"Michael,\" the man said. The other man opened the door to the car.\n\n\"Stewart.\" Michael smiled at the man. \"New arrival?\"\n\nA teenager darted out of the back of the car as soon as the door opened  and sprinted towards the gates. He made it all of three yards before he tripped over his own feet and crashed to the pavement hard. \n\nAll the other 100's winced in unison, including Michael. He remembered his first day here when he tried escaping as well. He was never one to watch where he was going, and with all the other 100's here, his luck had been nullified. Just like the kid, he too tripped and faceplanted into the hard, unforgiving asphalt. \n\nStewart winced as well. \"Yep. Caught him robbing a bank where a 100 was working. Just walked in grabbed the cash, and almost walked out before the 100 stopped him.\" The other man walked over and picked the kid up by the crook of the elbow and pulled him to admittance. \"Anyway, you can show him around the facility later. The boss wants to see you.\"\n\nMichael raised his eyebrows. \"He does?\" He clapped his hands together. \"It's been a while since I've been on an assignment. What is it?\" \n\n\"He can tell you the details, but it sounds like an information gathering mission with a chance for assassination.\" ",

I had spent my life, from age thirteen onwards here.  My Luck was my weapon, but I wasn\u2019t sure how.  I *should have* been able to get out of here, press my own Luck to its maximum and escape.  I was only allowed to talk to my guards, who were, to be honest, all very nice and fairly handsome, but hovering around fifty.\n\nGradually, I found out that we, the prisoners that is, are all ninety and higher, seriously.  We\u2019re all treated like pariahs for something outside of our control and then isolated.  I was one of the \u201clucky\u201d ones, the guards liked me and treated me like a younger brother, all except Chuck, but he was taken away.  I liked him the best.  I was nineteen when Chuck was taken away.  He waited and didn\u2019t touch me until I was eighteen and then one day, he had vanished.  It broke my heart.  Kyle told me what had happened, a relationship with a Lucky could increase Luck over time.  I had done it to both of us, apparently, he was pushed to one hundred, like the maximum security ward.  *I had gotten Chuck locked up.*\n\nMy resolve hardened.  I would have him back.  Chuck was *mine*.  I became quiet, acting broken.  I wasn\u2019t.  I started doing research.  If I increased my Luck beyond one hundred, I would *transform*, becoming my true self, probably either an angel or demon.  I couldn\u2019t wait.  I would have Chuck back.\n\nI did more research, I had devoured what little I could, then began bribing the guards to bring me more.  I did things I shouldn\u2019t have been proud of, but my body was a small price to pray to have Chuck indefinitely, for our eternity.  I discovered more, like the lineage of Lucifer, how he had six (SIX?!) sisters; two sets of triplets.  Destiny, Fortuna, and *Luck*; the other sisters, while interesting, weren\u2019t relevant to me or my search (Rose, Daisy, and Lily).  I started gathering myself and my materials I would need, incense, flowers, dice, cards, sundry items that soon filled my cell. \n\nI laughed and started that night.  It was a full moon, a hot day in summer, our air conditioning broke down; sweat dripped down my face as I completed the ritual with a slice of my own flesh, blood splattering the flowers, the petals scattering in a sudden wind.  \u201cA second?\u201d my own mother stood in my cell.  \u201cOh Liam,\u201d she said as I rushed to her, enveloping her soft body in a hug.  \u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am too *Lucky*, I was locked up and my Fated stolen from me,\u201d I tried to be strong, but tears poured out of my eyes as the story poured out of my mouth.  \u201cMother, I beseech you, please help me.\u201d\n\nAnd she did.",

            "comment": "I woke up this morning with a resolute decision, to not try escaping anymore. I'm starting to think the ones that designed this prison have a luck rating of 101. For example, every cliche mean of escaping works...at first. Want to dig out? The guard drops the spoon when taking your lunch tray back. Spoon not strong enough? The first spot you try is the weak one. Anyway, once you get to the sewage line (of course), something incredibly unlikely happens to stop you from escaping. Last week it was the pipe breaking, sending you right to the wardens office. One way or another, through planning or luck, solo missions or cooperation, something dumb happens and you're back to square one. Maybe one day I'll actually be lucky and freedom come to me. I spoke too soon, as I was thinking of how to spend my time...as planning escape is no longer needed, a rift opened right through my cell. Quite rapidly, the walls and soon the whole prison complex split into two. That's when the stench hit me, a strange combination of overdue flesh and sewage...the sewage I'm oh so used to swimming in has got nothing in what I'm smelling now. As sudden as it came, the stench disappeared, and as soon as the debris settled, I can see why. A translucent barrier of sorts erected itself across the sky, separating what's left of the prison from the outside world. Now, being in prison all my life, I've never seen the outside, but I know for sure that something is off. The air had an odd yellow tinge to it and there doesn't seem to be any sign of life in the many miles that I can see. It didn't take much to realize that life is better on this side, and that I lucked out after all.",

            "comment": "I still remember the test like it was yesterday, in the middle of a small and empty room there was this lone chair. It looked like one of those chairs you are when at the dentist, there's even a bright light attached to it. I was just told to sit down and relax, the test would be fully automatic and I didn't have to do anything. I don't remember the actual test though, it all went black the moment they put me in that chair. However I will never forget the look on her face when I came out again. She was definitly a scientist of sorts, dressed in a white medical coat, with brownish hair pulled back into a pony tail, and her eyes. Blue eyes filled with fear and shock. I couldn't do anything but to stare into those eyes. Then THEY came.\n\nLarge brutish security guards told me to come with them, I would refuse but they \"insisted\". And for the last year I was locked inside an old prison placed in, god knows where. Atleast they treated us well, lucky I guess. I once asked why we were locked in here, what did getting a 100 rating actually mean. The guard just laughed at me and told me that I didn't need to know.\n\nBut now I know why, after almost a year inside me and a few others managed to escape into the real world. The prison was really set in no where, but we got lucky and a car pulled up to us after only a short while. Now I really see it was good fortune we were allowed to have our ordinary clothes on even inside the prison, I guess they couldn't make things too bad for us as we had done nothing wrong.\n\nWe separated and now I am back in New York, and damn have I missed the old apple. But quickly I realised the lucky 100 maybe wasn't that lucky anyway. After getting here I was looking for an appartment, when suddenly a young girl being thrown out on the street. I asked what happened and apparantly she hadn't been the best appartment guest, the landlord then just asked me if I wanted a place to stay. He couldn't leave the appartment unattended and she wasn't let in again. I couldn't say no to an appartment, even if I had no money or anything. \n\nThe money problem wasn't really a problem, already after a few hours an ATM started spreading out cash after a disorder. It wasn't my cash but I needed some, just to pay my rent. \n\nI have noticed though, things such as this has happened all the time since I came out, random good things happening to me, but bad things happening to people around me. My neighbours have also realised that and are actively avoiding me.\nIs the 100 luck actually a curse, am I forced to \"steal\" the luck from others, because that's what it feels right now.\n\nThe last few days things have gotten worse, last day a man fell infront of a car, I couldn't help but think it was due to me. The car would have hit a puddle of water if it wasn't for him, and that would definitly have soaked me. Atleast he didn't seem to be too injured.\n\nThis is getting too much now, I can't leave my appartment without something \"bad\" happening, the moment I step outside there is someone injuring themself or losing something just so I can get a small improvement. I've had people who was walking slower than me on the sidewalk trip to the side so they didn't get in my way.\n\nI think however that the cops have started to notice me, there have been to many strange things going on around me. \n\n\n\nSomeone just died.\n\n I was just in the store, going to shop...It,fell down on him.\nI...I never meant to harm him, I just asked if he could reach the top shelf. Then it collapsed, he fell and his head. His head\n\nHe hit his head and died, the thing I wanted just landed in my shopping cart. \n\nI understand now, I know why we are being locked in. I have tried to call the police, the line is always busy. I tried to go to the police station, a disaster happened and none would even speak to me.\n\nThe prison must be a secret, I can't find it in any maps and I can't remember where it was, I just want to get back. I just want to be comfortable again, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK!!!\n\nI don't know why I keep write this down, I thought I would find some comfort in reading this but I don't. It just reminds me of the bad things I've led to.\n\nThis will be the last entry, people have died thanks to me. I can't let it happen again.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt won't let me finish it",

            "comment": "You were never supposed to be nervous for test day they said. Everyone is naturally better at certain things, and everyone is happier doing what they natuarlly excel in, they also said. \nIt was also said that the occasional person would score low in every category. It was a common childhood insult to be told you'd fail the test and be taken to the dumb house. In reality it wasn't called the dumb house but The Home for the Differently Abled was not a name that rolled off the tounge.\n\nThey were all wrong.\n\nMy older sister had scored extremely high in Logic, Communication, and Abstraction, she was quickly accepted into the advanced sciences program at The College. Her roommate had scored a perfect 100 in both Logic and Detail.\nI was hoping to get into engineering track. I had always enjoyed building and fixing things, and I didn't think I'd have any trouble. Everything I built or fixed worked OK, and I could even keep up with my genius sisters riddles and tricks.\n\nThe format of the test was all wrong. Teenagers having to check all thier personal electronics, waiting in long lines, then being isolated for the test. The whole thing bred a general air of nervousness. I could see graduates out the window running to meet thier families. My turn came and I entered my assigned testing room. It appeared to be a standard assesment test. If your life direction is based on a single test at least the schools did a good job preparing you. They whole test took about an hour by the time I had submitted my answers.\n\nI was met in the hallway by the schools guidance councilor. He wasnt alone. I was taken to The Home for the Differently Abled.\n\nTo be honest, it was a pleasant place. The food was good, the other people interned with me were good for conversation, and the grounds were generally comfortable and beautiful. Asside from the guards and distant but obvious walls. No electronics were allowed, but there were plenty of books, games, crafts, and everyone assisted in general chores and maintenance of the facility to pass time.\nI had frequent conversations regarding what I considered to be unlawful detention. Most of the other detainees would laugh, some considered me crazy, and it didnt seem anyone paid any attention. So I decided to escape.\n\nI knew the windows and doors would be monitored, and any absences at meals or after curfew would be immediately investigated. I secretly switched job tags with the guy next to me at lunch and found myself working on regrading the road near the main gate. I knew better than to make a break for it, but I did not return with the others. I stayed away from the walls and managed to avoid capture for 2 days by digging holes just large enough for myself to crouch in under heavy overhanging brush. On the third day there were other inmates joining the search. I was able to blend in and managed to steal a guards keycard before I was caught. I dont remeber what happened, but I woke up in an office with armed guards close by.\n\n\"I am your administrator.\" The man at the desk stood and approached me, stopping and leaning on the near side. \"I understand you're not happy here.\"\nI said nothing.\n\"You're not being punished. We know our security can cause feelings of isolation in spite of our efforts to hide it. This is a safe place.\"\nI did not trust him, but there are ways to learn things without getting direct answers so I spoke up. \"I want to see my test scores\". The administrator stared at me, clearly not expecting the question. This told me he had not been asked before, and I grew more bold by his hesitation. \"I was sent here in error, get my test and you'll see.\"\n\"Who do you think we bring here?\" he asked. I resumed my silence. \"This man,\" he gestured to one of the guards \"scored 100 in Security, and Luck\" Luck is a category on the test? I had never seen that on the lists, and took it for a bluff. The administrator continued \"the other guard scored 100 on security, 100 on Strategy, and 100 on Luck. I personally scored 100 in Administration, 95 in Detail,and 100 in Luck.\"\n\"Let me see my test scores.\" I tried to be forceful about it, but was honestly put off that what would probably be the best guards in the world were watching me right now.\nTo my suprise, he lifted a folder from the desk and handed it to me. I was nervous all over again as I opened it.\n\nThere was a category for Luck. I had scored 100 in that,Abstraction, Detail, Logic, Mechanics, and Strategy. \"If this is true, how did you catch me?\"\n\"We shot tranquilizers at everyone standing. We'd never have caught you awake, or by any action that singled you out.\"\nSmart. \"Is everyone here like this?\"\n\"Not like us in this room. 100s are rare, and multiple 100s even more so. But everyone here has a luck score of 100. Luck is a strange category: scores on Luck range between 1 and 75, then jump to 100. We think that after 75 the Luck skill influences its own score. Leaving people like that in the public leads to corruption of all levels of governance, afterall why would you act in the best interest of others if you did not experience any consequences for acting in your own interests?\"\n\"I won't stay. I don't care what you think about society, I have a right to freedom! I'll find a way!\"\n\"I said 'not like us in this room'. That includes you. The initial confinement with the population of our resort is a further test of sorts. It is a test of Ambition, and you have set a new high score! You are now going to join an elite level of scociety - you are the best of the best, and we would like to invite you to join us in running our Home for the Differently Abled, and directing the top levels of our government!\"",

Nobody to tell you to stop watching TV if something \u201cexcessively violent\u201d comes on. Nobody to make you talk to the government psychologists.

We were the safest humans in America, sitting pretty behind thick walls, an electrified fence, a moat, three minefields, and another moat, watching on TV while half the country ate the other half. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go play X Box\u201d I said. \u201cLet me know if they announce a new President.\u201d ",

When the bars shut with the signature loud clunk he flinched and the tear he had stayed off for so long finally fell.\n\nPeople have different reactions to how their life unravels. Some are used to it, some, like him, really aren't. It was never supposed to unravel. The Great Machine should've rewarded him now as it had done so many times before. He never expected anyone above 50 to end up in this condition.\n\nHis old habits faded from his mind after the first month. His first word after incarceration finally came. \"No.\" A simple response to a simple question in the meal section that he had become too familiar with. Today like many others, he shared a table with a couple of people. Unlike the other days, today he had a conversation.\n\n\"Where ya from?\" asked the man who called himself \"Giz\". \"Jadot,\" he answered, \"Fourth City, seventh sector.\" The other man at the table joined in at this point, \"Yes, a Fourth man, clearly,\" he said, \"I'm from the ninth myself\". Zed's expression betrayed the surprise he felt upon hearing this. People from the Fourth City, especially the those sectors were highly civilized, well-to-do people. \"Not exactly the kind of riff-raff you were expecting, eh?\" asked the man from the ninth. \"No sir, everyone here's from nice places. You'll hardly find anyone below a Number of 98, really. The Great Machine works in mysterious ways, as they say.\"\n\nThe old cliche really struck a nerve with Zed. \"That never helps. That doesn't help the lessers and that doesn't help us now, even if we are all 100. Not once, have I ever faced any opposition worth mentioning. Then one day, they pick me up for some complex crime I don't even understand and I'm eating brown paste, staring at a grey wall for the rest of my life. The Machine... I feel... betrayed.\" After a pause, Zed continued. \"Our world does not work like this. The Great Machine decides the fate for everyone. I'm not supposed to be here, because if the number doesn't work, then reality itself wouldn't exist, right?\"\n\n\"That's the idea, yes. But I've heard lessers say that nobody understands the Machine, not really anyway. Everyone here will tell you their idea of how it *really* works. They're all theories really, including what Kingdome model. Mine's about balance. Us being here upsets a great balance of the Numbers. It's out of equilibrium. That's why, eventually, everyone gets freed. Everyone I've seen, gets freed at some point. Some take longer but it always happens.\"\n\n\"So what you're saying,\" asked Zed, \"is that there's a discrepancy and our Numbers should still work as they did, and we'll just be set free because of it?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" responded both the other men.\n\nThe conversation when he went back to his cell had given him calm. A peace he hadn't felt for a very long time. He slept the most comfortable sleep he'd had in years because of it.\n\nEventually his time came. He was to be set free. After completing all the many formalities, gathering his belongings, there was one final thing he had to do. He had to verify his identity and reclaim his wealth in Room 33. Tired though he was, he entered it with enthusiasm. There he saw it. A great furnace, so deep, it seemed bottomless right under him. A guard followed him and motioned him to step over the edge of the floor and into this great fire below him. When he hesitated, the guard pulled out his tazer baton and pointed it towards Zed. However he didn't need to, because a great force of wind, that only he could feel pulled him towards the furnace. \n\nIn his final moments, he understood. \"Balance.\" The Numbers had to be in equilibrium. His was too high, so was everyone else who was incarcerated. This is how the Great Machine kept the Numbers for everyone in balance. He was to die, so that others may continue. His final breath, though agonizing, was one of gratitude.",

Not bad, but I wouldn't spend a lot of weekends at the track, if you know what I mean. \n\n\"Benny,\" says he, \"do you know why you're here?\"\n\n\"'Cause I did something dumb,\" says I.\n\n\"Yes, Benny. Breaking into the largest jewelry store in the world in the middle of the day might qualify as dumb,\" says he. Oh, that smug grin on his face, I am gonna laugh for days when I Shawshank my way out of this shithole. It ain't even gonna hard. \n\nOne look at the guards tells me they're stuck with the piss-poor fortune their mamas gave them. And they can't have even noticed mine, since they ain't got that nervous look that people tend to get when they see the big old 100 floating about my head. Why, you're in the 20s, you can't shake hands with me without dropping some loose change right in my pocket, and I do mean that real literal. \n\nThe only unlucky thing about me was the day my momma named me Reginald, and a quick walk to the county courthouse fixed that right up. Then, I hit the town. Vegas, specifically. There's a law, see, says casinos can't discriminate against people based on luck rating. There's another that says they can't advertise to people with low ratings. Not direct, anyway. They can only kick you out if they think you're cheating, which members of the 100 club - folks like me - always end up being suspected of cheating. So when I'd cleaned out every casino I could, I moved on. Stock trading made me money, but it was boring, man, boring. You ever talk to stock traders? I don't even know if they're speaking English half the time. So I took me a much more interesting job, if you're catching my drift. \n\nIt's my third time in the slammer. I pled guilty 'cause for folks like me, a fair and speedy trial just don't exist. \n\nYou get one, or you get the other. Every jury you pick is gonna be stacked with folks just like me who are gonna sympathize with every word outta my mouth. \n\nSo the selection process takes months. Then you have the actual trial which is a nightmare. \n\nNo. Thank. You. \n\nSo I get caught, I plead guilty. I get locked up. I get out. \n\nEvery time. \n\n\"No siree,\" says I to the warden. \"The dumb thing wasn't trying the trick, the dumb thing was getting caught.\" \n\nThe warden dismisses me with a motion of his hand. \n\nThe guard - 35 to my left there - walks me to the yard. And that's when I see something that just don't seem right - 100s, everywhere. Floating over everyone's head. \n\n\"From here on out,\" the guard says, \"everything you do, you do on your own. Every door you open closes another, every path you walk closes one more, and you yourself work all the controls. We are only here to subdue the ones who try to get out, and luck can't save you from an automatic rifle and two 12 gauges all firing at once.\"",

                    "comment": "It clicked for me real quick, what they'd done. And it was smart, see. \n\nWe 100 folks, we never failed at anything we did. We always won the hand of poker, we always just beat the train at the intersection, we always happened to meet just the right person at just the right time. Hell, we'd straight up been banned from playing the normal lottery in several states. They've got one specifically for 100s and another for 90s and above. \n\nSo when they had us working the equipment, all they needed was one thing - good design. As long as the design kept us in, the equipment would always work. Because we were 100s. If it was us working it, the equipment would never fail. It would always do exactly what you asked it to. It would never wear down. It would never have a logical issue. It would work perfectly. Every single time. \n\nAnd I was pissed that this prison was this smart. \n\nI gave myself a week before I started trying to crack it, and seeing it in action, man, it only pissed me off more. \n\nAfter a week and a half, I started a little chit-chat with another inmate I'd seen getting a little bit antsy.\n\n\"So what if, when they tell us to lock up for the night, we just don't,\" asks I.\n\n\"They shoot us,\" says he. \n\n\"And what if it's all of us,\" asks me.\n\n\"They shoot us all,\" says he. \n\nThen he sighed, rolled his eyes at me and sat me down right there.\n\n\"Look, Benny, that's your name, right? Benny? Benny. Everyone here, almost, has lived a life a lot like yours.\"\n\nNow this, this pisses me right off and I can't even stop myself from shouting \"You don't know my life\" right at him and if I'm being honest, maybe I just didn't even try.\n\n\"Adrenaline junkie, I take it,\" says he. \"Kicked out of every casino in Vegas, worked something corporate for a while, maybe asset management or sales acquisition or something like that. Then you got tired of living a life where everything just fell in your lap. So you started knocking down banks or insider trading or whatever. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Nope. You're wrong,\" I says, and I turn and walk away proud of myself.\n\nI tried to talk some sense into the other 100s at the prison, but they all sounded like that buzzkill. No one was into it. I was just walking around wondering what happened to these people's fighting spirit when I saw this kid out of the corner of my eye. Or heard him, actually.\n\n\"Heard you want out,\" says he. And he's got a one - just one little lonely one - sitting right above his head.\n\n\"I used to be a 100,\" says he, when we're in a nice, quiet, lonely place. \"But I had my luck surgically altered,\" \n\nAnd I told him, I said, I didn't you could do that. And he says you can, but it's a bad idea if you've got a lousy number and most everyone else can live with where they are. \n\nBut not him.\n\n\"I'm in here because I was a 100,\" says he. \"They've planned for every possible thing to wrong from a 100. They haven't planned for everything from a one. Because now, anything that can go wrong will go wrong.\"\n\nAnd then I think about it and I realize that I like the way this kid thinks. \n\nI don't honestly know how he got his luck changed in here or how he kept it hidden, but his plans, man, this kid's a firecracker. \n\nHe finds a way through the gates, and it is, let me tell you, art. It's beautiful. Ain't never seen nothing like it. \n\nHe knows the patrol patterns. He knows the layout. He knows everything. This man, I don't know who he is or how he did it, but let me tell you something, he is a real living miracle worker doing his thing right in front of my own two eyes. \n\n\"The guards are basically window dressing,\" says he. \"They're there to shoot us if we try to get out, but barely anyone ever even thinks about it. They haven't had an actual attempt in so long that they're rusty. If we went, it'd take them a while before they even realized what we were up.\"\n\nSo we set a date - it wasn't long after we hatched the plan because the longer we waited, the more likely it was that he'd be spotted. \n\nAnd we chat too. He tells me about his family - he's got a little girl back East, and he was trying to pull a score that'd get her through school when he wound up in the slammer. \n\n\"She didn't get my luck,\" says he. \"And there's not much else worth inheriting. She only got the worst parts of who I am. I owe her at least something good.\"\n\nHe's buried enough of the last score, he says. He knows exactly where and he knows how to get it to her. \n\nHe can do that, says he, he can afford to make his daughter's life good, better than his, he can be here forever a happy man. \n\nAnd then the day comes. And it goes so smooth, you wouldn't believe how smooth. It's like the guards here, they're so used to us doing everything that they don't even expect anyone to try to escape. My luck and the kid's planning, we're at the entry hallway in no time. \n\nAnd then our luck runs out. \n\nI'm through the front gates, almost home free, when one of them slams hard into the kid's side. \n\nMechanical fluke. Just bad luck. Makes sense, I suppose. \n\nHe's trapped there, trying to hide how much it hurts. I see the guards falling in behind us. Bringing their guns up. \n\nI look outside. Clear blue skies out there. I could just take a car easily. I'd pick the one with obvious hidden keys and unlocked doors. It'd be easy. \n\nAnd I look back at the kid. Every second, he looks like he wants to just let the reality of that pain escape, but he never does. The guards are taking aim. \n\nI could get out. The kid though, he'd get torn to shreds. \n\n\"Stop,\" says I. \"I'm turning myself in. We're turning ourselves in.\"\n\nI walk. I look back. I see the blue sky fading away in the distance. I look ahead. The gate opens perfectly as I walk to it, releasing the kid. \n\nHe's breathing heavily, clutching his ribs. \n\n\"Thank you,\" he says. \n\nThey don't even cuff me as I make my way back in.\n\n\u03a9\n\nThe warden jogged down the halls - he knew he shouldn't, not when he spent so much time telling prison visitors not to run onsite. \n\nBut he hated to be late for a meeting with the Founder. \n\nHe burst into the room.\n\n\"Please sir,\" he said. \"Excuse me for being out of breath.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" the man standing near the windows said. \"How's the prisoner?\"\n\n\"Adjusting well,\" the warden said. \"He's becoming a model prisoner and trying to find ways to reintegrate. Possibly even use his luck as a benefit to society.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the Founder. \"As you know, a big part of our philosophy is that anyone can use whatever luck has been given them to make the world a better place.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" the warden said, trying as usual to avoid acknowledging the one floating above the Founder's head.

            "comment": "\"Im-- we, are gonna escape from this place pretty soon, Phil. You can count on that, 1-dig...cant you see our glorious luck stat?\n\n Phil, the guard, looks at you  and gets as close as the door allows him, raising an eyebrow and smiling with crooked teeths. Some days you wondered why some people, like him, only have one digit on their life, but you sure are glad Phil is one of them\n\n \"Ha!\" Says Phil with a lisping, yet strangely cozy voice \"This place is a fortress...even a nuke wouldnt really damage it unless it strike it directly. And even then, you would be trapped here, with me...\"\n\nIn that exact moment, the guard face went pale and one of his eyes started twitching, while he tried without much sucess to moist his now dry lips. He stared at the near dozen ofman-made atomic comets flying into the sky. Everoyne could see they would strike someplace near. Soon. You smile trully for the first time in almost a month\n\n \"No, Phil\" You say and open your hand, letting a D20 roll off from it. \"You are trapped here with us\"",

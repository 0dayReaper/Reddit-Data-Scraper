            "comment": "Gotturk sighed softly to himself as he slumped back into his chair. The softness of the leather-and-goosedown cushions hugged his aching back with a pillowy comfort that ought to have been sin. He looked up at the ceiling. White spackled stone looked back at him. Little dancing shadows flickered between the seams of the stone bricks as the brightstone lamps around cast their gentle yellow light from their hanging cages.\n\n\"Working hard or hardly working?\" A female voice, bright and cheery, woke Gotturk from his empty daydream. He sat up and looked around his office to find a young woman beaming at him.\n\nShe had white hair, red eyes, and skin as pale as paper. Though her complexion and build betrayed her young age, she wore the ornate robes of an Archmagus.\n\n\"Suprised to see me?\" She asked as she let herself into his office, spinning one of the many plush chairs in the office around and plopping herself onto it. Her small frame was dwarfed by the chair, almost looking as if a child had clambored into her father's recliner.\n\n\"Never, Chief,\" Gotturk said, clearing his throat. It was dry. He coughed.\n\n\"Just Luna is fine,\" she replied, \"how is your work progressing?\"\n\nGotturk flexed his hands. The mettalurgists had run into an issue recently regarding the materials request from engineering. The alloy they needed to create the vessel needed to have more arcane conductivity than was originally delivered. Gotturk had spent more than one sleepless night this week working on ways to meld the properties of Mythril and Adamantine together while also staying within the mass budget set forth by the project. The Archmage definitely was here to see where he was at regarding that.\n\n\"We have a couple blockers we're clearing,\" Gotturk said finally after a few minutes of quiet contemplation.\n\n\"Are these the most current documents?\" Luna asked as she motioned toward the stacks of papers on Gotturk's desk. He grunted and shuffled a few of them around, placing the relevant files in front of the young Archmagus. She picked them up and looked them over, too quickly for any normal person, but Gotturk had long stopped questioning the abilities of an Archmagus.\n\nLuna frowned. \"It looks like you won't be hitting the pipeline on schedule based on these reports.\"\n\n\"Not for want of trying, Chie- I mean, Luna.\" Gotturk said, \"We've been working out metallurgists around the clock trying to meet your mass budget, but Adamantine won't bond with any of the lighter metals or metamaterials we have access to. To have enough to ensure that we meet the radiation shielding standards for the arcane conduits we'll need at least double the mass budget we have now.\"\n\n\"Well if that's the concern, you should have brought it up sooner. If we need to make concessions based on the practicality, we can take mass budget away from other departments.\" Luna put the papers back. \"The physical integrity of the ship itself is paramount. If we have to cut back on the scope of the project, we can, in order to allocate more budget to the core design teams.\"\n\n\"Well that's one thing,\" Gotturk said. He always had mixed feelings about the project anyway. The feasability of it was only just one of the many concerns that had been brought up internally.\n\n\"Is there something else that's bothering you?\" Luna asked.\n\n\"You can tell?\"\n\n\"It's written quite plainly on your face,\" Luna answered. She grinned, \"Don't be afraid to comment on anything. This is a big project and I need everyone 100% on board if we're going to pierce the veil.\"\n\n\"Should we really be doing this?\" Gotturk asked.\n\nLuna didn't even feign surprise at his question, yet she asked all the same, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Going to Heaven,\" Gotturk said, \"its so much man power, so much magic, so much raw resources we're consolidating into this 'Heaven Piercing Spear' of yours. Shouldn't we be putting our talents into something more grounded, or more conservative?\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Luna asked.\n\n\"We could be making golems or arcane networks that would help the rest of the kingdom continue to industrialize. Over half of the nation right now doesn't have access to the leyline network and we're using so much energy to forge and reforge these metamaterials that have never existed before in the history of the world.\"\n\n\"And?\" Luna asked.\n\nGotturk grimaced. \"What do you mean 'and?', I mean that its inefficient for us to commit the entire forge disctrict to this project while there's still a backlog for steel and Mythril required for constructing the rail networks.\"\n\nLuna sighed and turned to stare out the window behind Gotturk. \"That has been brought up before, yes. Even in a world of magic there are limits to the resources and work that can be done in a set amount of time. Regarding that its not so different, this world and that world.\" She paused to collect herself. \"Yes, it is selfish of me to commandeer so much of the Kingdom's resources for my own personal project, and I do understand the strain I've put on all of the people who have been taken from their original stations by royal decree, and that some think me undeserving of-\"\n\n\"Please Chief, no one thinks you are undeserving of such power,\" Gotturk interjected suddenly. \"You've done a great deal for the Kingdom. Millions wouldn't be alive if it weren't for your work.\"\n\n\"Kind of you to say,\" Luna said, \"but the truth is that this project primarily only benefits me. There is no good reason that I can give the general population for going to the Moon, but I wish to go there. And the King was kind enough to commit to making that happen for me.\"\n\n\"Then surely there is an alternative where we do not have to commit so much to this project so quickly-\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" Luna said quickly. \"We need to stick to the timeline I've drafted.\"\n\n\"Can you at least give me a reason why?\" Gotturk asked.\n\nLuna thought about it for a moment before answering. \"Well, we're not alone. That's all I can say.\"",

The dead parent thing is more for comics and anime?\"\n\nDr. Doughktur clasps his hands on the desk in front of him, \"Not necessarily. I don't mean to scare you but it's a common trope for YA protagonist to have one or both parents kil- erm, pass. It's also common for the parents to go missing for whatever reason, however it's not unheard of that parents find themselves feeling cold and unloving towards their protagonist child. If you have any other children you may find yourself favoring them more. I can send you home with a pamphlet of information on what we call Uncaring Parent Syndrome.\"\n\nHe stands and walks over to the wall, where a shelf of papers on various topics is mounted. Carefully he selects a few while muttering quietly to himself.\n\nFinally he returns and slides the stack over to me and I read through the topics.\n\n*Signs your partner is/was a supernatural being and how this may affect your child*\n\n*What to do if you think you or your partner are about to go missing*\n\n*How to properly address your child's prophecy*\n\n*Best known ways to avoid Uncaring Parent Syndrome and why it happens*\n\n*What to do when monsters are targeting your family*\n\n*10 best schools for super-powered children*\n\n*How to support your protagonist child without ruining the plot*\n\nI feel a hand on my shoulder and look up to see Dr. Doughktur's sympathetic eyes\n\n\"I know this is a lot to take in, but I hope you understand my team and I are going to do our very best to support your family during this time.\"\n\nI nod slowly, \"Thank you, doc, I think I'd like to go back to my wife and talk this over with her now.\"\n\n\"Of course, let me walk you back to her room, I apologize for pulling you aside separately for this, we'd usually do this with both parents in the room, but with how rough your wife's pregnancy has been so far and how fragile these situations are, I wanted to be as careful as possible with the news.\"\n\n\"I understand, I think she'll be more relaxed if I'm the one to explain the situation.\" I say, giving the man a handshake when we reach the door and taking a deep calming breath before pushing the door open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh good, you're both here, now we can get started!\"\nSays the long bearded man standing in the middle of the room when I enter. \n\nHe smiles brightly, \"I'm here to deliver a message.\"",

I put my son on the sparkly clean floor as he immediately waddled over to the corner where the toys resided.\n\nI looked at the poor boy as I heard a click and a bang as a sharp pain shot through my heart and a warm liquid ran down my shirt.\n\n\"I'm sure you would have been an amazing father, Matt.\" The doctor told me as he wiped the blood from his glasses I looked at him and then the nothingness as the cold embrace of death as I let out one last breath.\n\nThere was no life flashing before my eyes, just..the somehow comforting knowledge that my son will live on.",

            "comment": "\u201cWhat brings you in today?\u201d the doctor asks.\n\n\u201cSo, my son just turned 16 and we\u2019ll, this is kind of awkward to talk about but he\u2019s popular with the girls.\u201d I say.\n\nThe doctor smiles warmly \u201cthat doesn\u2019t seem like a problem to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know right?\u201d I say, \u201cbut I mean at first he kind of seemed aloof to it all and we thought he just had friends that were girls. No problems there. But then the girls started being overly protective of him, even fawning over him.  The girls even have different personalities doesn\u2019t that sound odd that a boy attracts all sorts of girls? Ayumi is pretty shy when she comes over wanting to serve everyone. I like her a lot. Akira is very intelligent. Akane is a very strong willed girl trying to get William to obey her they fight a lot which can\u2019t be healthy.  Then there\u2019s Aiko and Haruka as well.  I guess he has a thing for Japanese girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm please go on\u201d the doctor says and adopts a more serious tone.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until recently that he started coming home with all these girls at the same time.  I decided to have \u2018the talk\u2019 with him just in case you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\n\n \u201cHe has never been interested in that sort of thing but recently we\u2019ve noticed a change in his demeanor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of change?\u201d\n\n\u201cUhmm how best to put this we\u2019ve seen dirty books starting to accumulate in his room. And he\u2019s becoming a bit of perv?  We see the way he looks at these girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk I think I\u2019ve heard enough.  Your son may be a protagonist, specifically a harem protagonist.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what does this mean for him and for us as his parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell you have a few options,  you can be unsupportive, supportive, overprotective, or just absent. For him it means just what you said.  He will be very popular and most likely romantic with these girls at some point you probably don\u2019t want to hear about that because, well it\u2019s just best you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about school and his future career and family prospects?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool, doesn\u2019t matter.  Career doesn\u2019t matter.  Family prospects? You\u2019ve met them already.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks doctor this is a lot to take in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a pamphlet for you both to read at home.  It\u2019s called: So your son is becoming a Harem Protagonist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck to you\u201d the doctor says \u201cyou can exit this room and the receptionist is down the hall to the left\u201d.",

It seemed an age before I finally asked \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, no disrespect to your intelligence, but clearly you must have noticed mysterious unexplained things happening around your boy recently. He has turned the right age for a protagonist, obviously\"\n\nI still must have had the moron confused look \"Um no....nothing at all. He's a perfectly normal boy\"\n\n\"I see. Well I assume after his real parents died, that he began to exhibit....\"\n\n\"His real parents haven't died!\", confusion began giving way to frustration. \"I'm his real dad! And my wife is his real mother! He has no 'other' parents!\"\n\nFor the first time, the oddly-dressed man seemed uncertain of himself. \"But there's clearly been some tragedy in his early life, I assume?\"\n\n\".......No. I mean, our pet goldfish died a few years ago and he was sad about it.....but that's all\"\n\nThe man's brow furrowed. \"No dead grandfather who passed on wisdom and life goals to your son?\"\n\n\"No....my father died before my son was born, he never knew him. My wife's father is still alive\"\n\nNow the man began to adopt the same moron confusion look I must have had before. \"No talking to animals? No sudden gains in physical or mental ability? No close childhood friend who has mysteriously turned evil recently?\"\n\n\"........er.......nope, nothing like that.\"\n\nThere was a pause as the man consulted his book. \"Protagonist, protagonist......protagonist.....hmm.......Tell me something, have you noticed objects mysteriously moving around the house? Loud noises, mysterious tremors?\"\n\n\"......No.....\"\n\n\"Hmm okay, so it's not 'poltergeist'......please don't be offended if I ask this, but have you committed any major crimes?\"\n\n\"I....of course not!\"\n\n\"So it can't be 'Pentagon list'.........you are not from the rural South?\"\n\n\"No, we're all from California\"\n\n\"So it's not 'potato grits'.......\"\n\nThere was an awkward silence, which allowed me to get some train of thought back. \"Look, what the hell IS this?! You ask me here, then tell me a whole bunch of stuff and ask me all sorts of stupid questions.....\"\n\n\"I do apologise, it just says here that your son is a protagonist. But clearly there's been a misunderstanding or mistranslation somewhere.\"\n\n\"Damn right there has! Dead parents, mysterious events.....my son is a perfectly normal boy!\" I stood up to get ready to leave. \"I don't know what you're playing at, but leave my son alone! Good day!\"\n\nThe main looked upset. \"I'm sorry for upsetting you. I just can't work out what it all means. I apologise for wasting your time Mr Pentagalist.....\"",

            "comment": "**Protagonist Syndrome PSA #1 - \"Ellie\"**\n\nEllie was always just... a normal kid, y'know? Room full of stuffed animals, healthy appreciation for fairy tales, loved spending time with my mother-in-law... it was hard to believe, when the doctor told us\u2014\n\nShe started showing signs of PS a little later than most patients. The first thing was probably this necklace she never took off. Got it from her grandma on the woman's death bed, so we thought we understood why. Then her hair turned this super-light blue, and we never saw her dye it once. I guess we just wrote it off as late middle school weirdness. I mean, nobody *wants* their child to be a... protagonist. \n\nIt was the little things that finally clued us in. At the beginning of the school year, for example, my wife got the urge to make this big breakfast. I was sitting there, reading the newspaper\u2014and I don't know why, because I haven't read a physical paper in *years*\u2014when Ellie came running downstairs, still braiding her blue hair into this incredibly complex style that somehow took only a few moments. Ellie's always been a good eater, so I was a little surprised when she rushed through, grabbed a piece of toast, and told her mom she was running late. I remember sitting there, watching my wife rush after her with a bagged lunch, and wondering if maybe... but no one wants their kid to be a protagonist.\n\nThings got worse as the year went on. She befriended a group of girls one-by-one, each with their own necklaces and brightly colored hair. They'd disappear for hours at a time, coming back with lame excuses like \"the bus was late,\" or \"I was in the bathroom.\" Her grades began to slip, and we got reports from the school that she also regularly disappeared from class. Around the same time, supernatural beings began terrorizing the town we lived in. It took longer than I'd like to admit for my wife and I to realize the attacks always happened when Ellie and her friends disappeared, and a group of pastel-colored superheros were showing up to battle the disturbances. No one wants to realize their little girl has taken up the mantle of the Periwinkle Punisher and risks her life in an episodic fashion\u2014no one wants their kid to be a protagonist.\n\nOnce we confided our suspicions with each other, we decided to call in the professionals. Our GP helped guide us through the diagnostic process and work with Ellie to create a symptom management plan. Her specific variation of the syndrome was only an adolescent phase, and, with careful planning and risk management, she was able to save the world without becoming sealed in a pocket dimension or devoured by a spell designed to bind supernatural powers.\n\nToday, Ellie attends college, volunteers at the animal shelter, and still keeps in touch with her old high school friends. She runs a support group for super-powered teenage girls, called Crossover Episode. My wife and I couldn't be more proud of the woman she's become. Maybe no one wants their child to be a protagonist, but I'm happy my daughter got the help she needed to be a successful one. \n\nThink your child might be showing symptoms? Don't wait! Call your pediatrician, today, and access all the information you need to help them navigate this challenging diagnosis. It could save a life!",

I swallowed, mouth dry.\n\n\"My - my wife?\" I manged.\n\nThe doctor shook her head. \"Anime mother syndrome. I'm afraid it's incurable.\"\n\n*Dammit*, I should've seen this coming when she grew her hair out. Lissa always loved her short, practical hair. Why would she suddenly decide to go for a side plait?\n\nThe doctor must've realised what I was thinking because she sat down next to me and placed a hand on my shoulder. \"You mustn't blame yourself. The symptoms for both are easy to miss. If I hadn't thought to ask what seat your son took on his first day in school after his transfer I never would've spotted it myself. But right now, you need to be strong. You need to focus on your son.\"\n\n\"You're right.\" At best I'd be dead within a few months myself. At worst I'd vanish from my son's life right as he needed me the most and return as his main antagonist. I wouldn't let that happen. I wouldn't fight my child.\n\nThe days after my wife's passing were a blur of pain and misery. I sent my son to my sister and sat alone in our empty apartment and tried to work out how I could save my son from his fate as a protagonist. I had three months before his fifteenth birthday and his destiny came to claim him.\n\nDestiny.\n\nWait, it couldn't be *that* simple, could it? Find whoever, whatever, controlled destiny and destroy it. Vengeance for my wife, safety for my son.\n\nNo matter the cost, whatever I'd have to become, I would save him.",

            "comment": "My mouth goes dry. My head swims. A gulp echoes from my throat.\n\n\"Please tell me he's a comedy protagonist?\" I can hear my own voice, but it seemed like it was coming from miles away.  \n\n\nThe doctor shakes his head. \"Battle shonen. He has the trademark spikey, multicolored hair.\"  \n\n\nMy breath comes quicker. Battle Shonen. Nearly guaranteed death for one or both parents. I look at my wife, muttering into our baby's ear, calming his cries. And I can see the future.  \n\n\nEither she'd die, some motivating villain to push my son to his destiny, or she'd simply disappear from his life. Unless....unless I was the sacrifice. I knew about it, and narratively speaking, it makes more sense for the father who is in the know about the hero's destiny to die.   \n\n\nFor a second, I imagine fleeing, being one of the dispassionate, absent parents in the story who come back later just to reunite with their child. But no. That was cowardice. My son would be loved for as long as I lived. And I'd be the sacrifice.  \n\n\n\"How long do we have together?\" I ask. The doctor looks at the chart, and studies my face. \"Oftentimes, Protagonist syndrome manifests during early to mid puberty. Ten years? Fifteen at the latest.\"\n\nI nod. A decade. Maybe a decade and a half. I will raise him with all the love in the universe. He will know his parents love him. Not a single day will go by where he doesn't know he's a miracle.  \n\n\n\"Thank you doctor.....can I have the room?\"  \n\n\nAs the man leaves, I walk over to my wife and child. The boy's multicolored hair strikes the light. \"Hey, little guy.\" I grab one of his newborn hands. \"I'm your dad. I'm here for you.\" And I always will be. No matter what destiny tries to pull.",

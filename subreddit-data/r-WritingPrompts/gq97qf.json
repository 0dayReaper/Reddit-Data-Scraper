On each one of them sat a person with a signs in front of them with number that went from 10 \u2013 90.\n\nIt seemed like I was the last person to come.\n\nThey all looked at me as I went down to take my seat in the number ten chair.\n\nThe man with the 40 number started off the meeting with complaining, shouting and starting angrily saying a lot of words that I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nHe seemed to be especially angry at 30. They both started arguing and 30 ended up leaving.\n\n60 and 70 tried to talk him into calming down, but he only got angrier and then slammed the door as he went outside.\n\nThe room was full of silence after that, and then 20 got up and said that he was busy and that he had better things to do than waste time here, right before leaving the room.\n\nAfter that the other people in the room started talking about some stuff like marriage and will to live, but I wasn\u2019t really interested in adult talk. I daydreamed about my Gameboy that I left behind at home. I wanted to go back home to play Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nI dozed off for the rest of the meeting, but when my mind came back I realized the only ones that were left were 80, 90 and I.\n\nNow that I looked at 90 I noticed that he had tubes attached all around his body and that his chair was actually a wheelchair.\n\n80 stood up and came towards me and opened his palm to reveal a piece of candy, which he then gave to me.\n\nHe patted my head and said as he started coughing: \u201cYou are a good boy, Isaac. Do what you wish with your life, for it is the only one you have.\u201d\n\nThen he started walking toward the door.\n\n\u201cI want to go play pokemon on my Gameboy.\u201d\n\nHe looked back at me and smile.\n\n\u201cGo do that then.\u201d Then he walked out.\n\nI was now left with 90 who was in the wheelchair.\n\nHe seemed like he was too old and tired to talk, but then when I stood up to walk out he whispered:\n\n\u201cI play pokemon with my Gameboy. Wanna play together?\u201d\n\n\u201cYe-Yea, sure.\u201d I replied a bit crept out. \u201cBut I left mine at home, I promise to play with you the next time we meet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise?\u201d He said as his breathing was visibly becoming louder.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe seemed content with that and I went out the room looking forward to playing more pokemon when I got home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Note: I will post each year as a different part, so stay in tune.***",

As my final exams was only days away and I was already behind on my study material. I want to get this over with as soon as possible and go back to studying.\n\nI looked around to see that the only one left to come was me from 10 years ago. I waited a few more minutes before I decided it was not worth wait. As I started to stand up the door creaked and my younger self entered the room.\n\nSoon the meeting began.\n\nI could hear 40 giggling to himself as he was staring at 30 without even blinking once.\n\n\u201cLook at you. All lively, feeling like you are at the top of the world.\u201d 40 said to 30.\n\n\u201cLittle do you know your whore fucking wife is cheating behind you back.\u201d He continued as he laughed to himself.\n\n\u201cHow dare you call Margret such slurs?\u201d 30 replied. \u201cYou make me wonder if I had fallen into a ditch and had suffered brain damage before I turned 40.\u201d He replied.\n\n\u201cNo, but you must have accidentally poured bleach into your eyes to not see how of a cheating whore she is.\u201d 40 shouted back.\n\nThen the arguing started and words thrown left and right, but I can\u2019t afford to deal with this noise right now. I will have a headache before the exams start. I will just cover my ears for some quiet and silence then deal with my future problems when the time comes.\n\nNot soon after 30 ran out fuming, then when 60 and 70 tried to calm 40 down, he got even angrier and slammed the door as he went out.\n\nNow the room was silent.\n\nI decided that I had seen enough.\n\n\u201cWell, that was a waste of my time.\u201d I said as I stood up. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of these meetings, it is not productive even in the slightest. I have better things to do.\u201d\n\nAs I went out the door, I wondered if I should have asked 30 for the exam questions. But whatever, it is too late now.",

                            "comment": "***Year 30:***\n\nI have been newly wed to an old colleague of mine from high school. Margret, my one and only true love. Her eyes the color of silver and lips as soft as marshmallows. She always tells me to let go from time to time to enjoy life. But work has been keeping me busy these days. But I can\u2019t tell her that, not to her precious heart.\n\nOh \u2026 yes \u2026 right, the meeting.\n\nSo I entered the room, filled with excitement to announce the news of my engagement, even though more than half of everyone there already knew about it.\n\nI am about to shout hello to everyone in the room only to see that the only person who was already there was 90.\n\nSo I quietly sat down and decided to wait for everyone else to come.\n\nWhile I was waiting, I tried to recall my memories of the meeting 10 years ago, but I was too worried about exams at the time. So most of it was mixed in with stuff I had exams on. I do remember there being a lot of shouting, and then I started having a heachache, but oh well we will see what happened.\n\nSoon entered 60 and then not long after 70.\n\nThey sat down in silence like me as they examined each other.\n\n80 came in slowly as his knees looked like they were giving up. Well considering that I can still walk at that age I am sure I will live pretty healthy. But I have to remind myself to buy a walking stick for that age.\n\nThen 40 came in. I tried to greet him, but he only kept staring at me.\n\nThen 50 entered the room, but I couldn\u2019t have a good look at him, since i was too busy trying to avoid eye contact with 40 who was still staring at me, sitting in his chair next to 50.\n\n20 entered the room. I knew that he couldn't wait to get out of here.\n\nAt last, I gave out a sigh of relief as 10 finally entered the room.\n\nI looked at him as he struggled to get into his chair and thought to myself: \u201cWho would have though a little shrimp like him would be blessed enough to have such a wonderful woman by his side.\u201d\n\nWith that the meeting had officially started.\n\nAs I was getting ready to talk, 40 started to giggle out loud and said:\n\n\u201cLook at you. All lively, feeling like you are at the top of the world. Little do you know your whore fucking wife is cheating behind you back.\u201d\n\nI was shocked that I would be talking in such manner in only 10 years from now. I surely must have been drinking before coming to the meeting.\n\n\u201cHow dare you call Margret such slurs?\u201d I replied furiously. \u201cYou make me wonder if I had fallen into a ditch and had suffered brain damage before I turned 40.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but you must have accidentally poured bleach into your eyes to not see how much of a cheating whore she is.\u201d 40 shouted back at me.\n\n\u201cListen here, you drunkard.\u201d I called out to him angrily. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say will happen in the next 10 years. No one in their right mind would listen to a babbling drunk like you. For how long have you started drinking?\u201d\n\nHe started drunkenly laughing, that he started chocking on his own saliva.\n\n\u201cAy, you are right I have started drinking, but that was only after I found out.\u201d He said as he crossed his arms. \u201cIf you would take my advice dump her already or even better just cheat back on her. Trust me it won\u2019t be much of a stranger to you once you become me. But you won\u2019t because you are too much of a soft hearted idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d I shouted as i started to stand up to make my way out. \u201cI don\u2019t have to listen to this any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt not my fault that you have bad taste in women, Isaac.\u201d 40 shouted at me as I opened the door.\n\nI stopped for a second, but decided it was not worth replying to him.\n\nBut truthfully, I was worried. In the end, it all seemed too good to be true. I have to make sure that she does indeed love me, so that I don\u2019t have any doubts.",

That bastard is right where I left him.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but smile while staring at him. Perhaps I wasn\u2019t looking that sane in front of everyone, considering how much alcohol I swallowed last night to drown my misery. But that didn\u2019t matter, for the one responsible for all this shit that happened to me was right in front of me and I didn\u2019t care about any other person in this room.\n\nWhen the little boy sat down, I started bad mouthing that fucking whore in front of 30.\n\nOf course, I knew he wouldn\u2019t listen to me and nothing would change. But I couldn\u2019t keep bottling all this anger inside me.\n\nAnd of course, he started being a baby wimp and ran away.\n\nThen I sat there, with not a drop of guilt in my heart as both 60 and 70 gave me look of pity.\n\n\u201cWhat are you fucking looking at?\u201d I shouted at the both of them. \u201cYou know what that fucking bitch did and then you act like you are better than me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to tell it to him that way.\u201d 60 told me quietly.\n\n\u201cOh what fucking difference would it make?\u201d I replied. \u201cHe will end up becoming a drunk old bastard like me anyways.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t continue living your life like that and you know that.\u201d 70 said. \u201cIn time you will learn to forgive yourself, Isaac.\u201d\n\nI gave out a shrug.\n\n\u201cForgive myself you say?\u201d\n\nAnd then i shouted angrily: \u201cWhy would I forgive myself? That cheating whore was the one who decided our relationship wasn\u2019t good enough for her.\u201d\n\nBut they both closed their eyes and didn\u2019t reply.\n\nThis made me even more angry.\n\n\u201cWell, Screw you all to hell. You can continue your shitty meeting without me.\u201d\n\nI went through the door and slammed it on my way out.\n\nWho the hell do they think they are? Making it sound like it was my fault.",

What was the point of it all?\n\nWhat is the point of this meeting if I won\u2019t be able to change anything anyways?\n\nThis is just torture at this point. I want to kill myself, but I know I can\u2019t, since I can see that i will live for another 40 years at least, only to be bedridden just like 90 sitting over there in his wheelchair. That is if you call that living in the first place.\n\nBut that is not why I came here today. I came here to ask some questions. I had to know.\n\nI waited for everything else to play out, so that it is calm enough for me to ask.\n\nAfter 40 had left, I decided that it was time.\n\nI looked at 60, but he was already looking at me, he knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cSo tell me, 60. Why did you decide to continue living your life, even though everything hurts so much?\u201d  I asked him as I once again look at the ground.\n\n\u201cHonestly.\u201d He said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The last 20 years have been a living hell for me. There were days that I would cry myself to sleep. Once, I was sent to ER for a heart attack and when I woke up, no one was there for me. I still feel empty the same way you do now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that how I will live the rest of my life? Just spend it being a miserable bastard.\u201d I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cBut.\u201d He continued. \u201cOnce, i let go of the burdens holding me in the past, everyday it started hurting a bit less. And I started looking up towards the future again.\u201d\n\nI raise my head as my eyes started watering.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still don\u2019t know what I am gonna do with the rest of my life.\u201d 60 said.\u201d But I know that I don\u2019t have to make myself suffer anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo even a person like me can still deserve a second chance?\u201d I thought to myself.\n\nI sat down for a while in that chair trying to process everything.\n\nThen I decided that I don\u2019t want to live like this anymore. I want to become happier, even if a little. Now that I know I can overcome the next 10 years, nothing can keep me down anymore.\n\nI stood up and wiped the tears from my eyes with me sleeve and said:\n\n\u201cThank you. That\u2019s all I needed to hear.\u201d\n\nAs I slowly walked towards the door, I wave at everyone and said:\n\n\u201cI promise to stay clean of alcohol from now on and start looking for work again.\u201d\n\nI see a grin form on 60\u2019s face as he waves back at me with his hunched back in his chair.\n\nI exited the room, knowing that whatever is to come, I shall persevere.",

Since both of us knew what was gonna happen.\n\nAs the last person enters, I start breathing in and out to calm myself.\n\nSo the ruckus happens as it always does and 30 leaves, followed by 40, then 20.\n\nAnd now it begins.\n\nI look at 50 as he hesitates what to ask exactly.\n\nAnd when he does, I do the only thing I can. I give him hope. I tell him that life gets better and that he can make it work. I only told him what he needed to hear.\n\nAnd that seemed to have satisfied him.

I give in.\u201d I replied. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him. When I look back at all the effort I have put into turning my life around, I still ask myself if it was futile. But I can\u2019t let him think that already. I need to make him believe now ,so that he can continue trying for as long as he can.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at you, so grown up.\u201d He replied jokingly. \u201cNow a wiseman, who passes words of advice to the ear of the youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh stop with the mockery, you silver scaled snake.\u201d I said as we both started laughing.\n\nAfter a bit, out of curiosity, I asked him:\n\n\u201cSo tell me \u2026 uhmmm, does it really get better?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I could answer you and say yes, but who knows if I am telling you the truth? Maybe I will do the same to you as you did to the young lad.\u201d He answered with a stupid smirk on his face.\n\n\u201cAy, that\u2019s fair I guess.\u201d I said as I look at the ground.\n\nI raised myself to my feet and said:\n\n\u201cWell, we are young as long as we live. There is no thing as become too old to stay young.\u201d\n\nAs I am about to open the door, I heard 70 say something.\n\n\u201cHey, young lad. Make sure you live a good life and a piece of advice from me, you should start looking into gardening. So that I have a nice tree to sleep under in ten years.\u201d\n\nI give him a quick smile and reply as I exit the room:\n\n\u201cAy, I will consider your advice, geezer.\u201d",

Now I spend my days taking care of a big beautiful garden with very colorful trees and flowers. A place where people come to visit through thick and thin and children come to play at.

Sometimes people bring me gifts as appreciation for my work, but it is always their smile that sooth my heart the most.\n\nAnd now I sit here through shouting and lying as I see it repeat like every other decade .\n\nAnd now that 60 has done the deed, I decided to jest him a little to lighten up his mood.\n\nAs he left I gave him something to distract himself with and give him purpose and in due time happiness.\n\nAs I look around I see 10, who was still daydreaming about his Gameboy, 80 who was sitting there silently and 90 who practically looked dead at this point.\n\nBut I promised myself not to give any thought to the future; I will live what I can now, so that I don\u2019t regret it later.",

At first, I excused it as my memory being bad due to age, since now I was practically an old man and my limbs started to sore even after a little jog.\n\nThen my limbs started to fail me as it became harder and harder to work in the garden. One day, while I was working I collapsed and when I woke up I was in recovery room. But this time, it was different.\n\nMany families who used to come to my park visited me during my recovery and they brought their kids with them, who then handed me gifts of chocolates and many wonderful flowers. That night I cried true tears of joy as I knew I wasn\u2019t alone anymore.\n\nThe next day the doctor came in to tell me the news.\n\nHe said that I was gonna recover in a few weeks, but I would still have to stay off any heavy work and take calcium supplements to delay my osteoporosis.\n\nBut he also took some MRI scans of my brain due to the request of some of my visitors. He suspected that I might have early stage Alzheimers.\n\nSo I laid off all the garden\u2019s work to a young lad who was helping me take care of the garden, that I hired when it started to become more difficult for me to work.\n\nAnd as I became 80 I thought to myself: \u201dWhat do I want to tell myself from the past once I enter the room?\u201d\n\nAfter thinking about it for a while, I decided that it was better off if I said nothing.\n\nFor this once in my life I want to sit there and see all my hard work, all my suffering, all my rage play right in front of me.\n\nI want to see it all one last time, before I forget forever.\n\nAs I enter the room, I see the same people I have gotten to know during the entirety of my life. I slowly make my way to my chair and just watch.\n\nI look at 10 as he sits there confused on what all these new words 40 is saying means.\n\nI look at 20 as he worries about making it through college.\n\nI look at 30 as he fights against 40\u2019s insults about his wife, trying to defend her integrity. Oh which reminds me; I never bought the walking stick I wanted to remind myself about.\n\nI look at 40 as he bashes out on everything in his sight, angry over what he had once lost.\n\nI look at 50 as he waits for something to give him hope.\n\nI look at 60 as he encourages 50 to live better, like a father telling his son he can go play with his friends once he has finished his school work.\n\nI look 70 as he sits there with a spirit able to rival any youth, kindling a bit of jealously in me.\n\nI look at myself, a grumpy old man, looking back on his fond memories.\n\nThen at last, I look at 90 as I see the inevitable future that awaits me.\n\nBut I do not fear, for now that I have looked back on it all. I can truly say that I had lived a worthy life.\n\nAnd now that the only people left in the room were 10, 90 and there was only one more thing left to do.\n\nI stood up and walked over to 10 and kneeled down slowly as I revealed something in my hand to him.\n\nIt was the piece of candy I received from myself 70 years ago; I had changed its wrapping with a new one.\n\nI patted his head and said to him:\n\n\u201cYou are a good boy, Isaac. Do what you wish with your life, for it is the only one you have.\u201d\n\nAs I walked towards the door I heard him say:\n\n\u201cI want to go play pokemon on my Gameboy.\u201d\n\nI looked back as his sweet innocence made me smile.\n\n\u201cGo do that then.\u201d I said as I walked out the door one last time.",

I soon see some people entering the room. Some of they look scary, like the bearded man sitting on the chair with 40 on it, while some others look very kind like the old man sitting in the chair with 70 on it.\n\nBut it is kind of boring all they do is get angry and shout words that I don\u2019t understand.\n\nI hope mom comes pick me up soon, so that I can go back to playing pokemon. Maybe I should have brought my Gameboy with me.\n\nAs everyone starts leaving, I hear a little voice say:\n\n\u201cI want to go play pokemon on my Gameboy.\u201d\n\nI look to see a figure of small boy, just like me. Perhaps I can ask him if we can become friends, so that I can play pokemon with him.\n\nI try to speak, but my throat feels very dry. I see him getting off his chair, but I can\u2019t force out a single word.\n\nI don\u2019t want him to go out before I can ask him to become my friend.\n\nSo I muster all the strength I can and whisper:\n\n\u201cI also play pokemon with my Gameboy. Wanna play together?\u201d\n\nHe looks at me kind of shocked by then replies:\n\n\u201cYe-Yea, sure. But I left mine at home, I promise to play with you the next time we meet.\u201d\n\nOh, so he doesn\u2019t have it here with him? I guess we can play together next time.\n\n\u201cPromise?\u201d I ask him.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He answered back.\n\nHe then skipped his way to the door and left.\n\nI am happy now. I made a friend today and we can play pokemon together the next time we meet.\n\nNow, all I have to do is wait for mom to pick me up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The End.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I wanna to thank everyone who has read down this far.

(Use exclamation marks!);\n* Changed everything to past tense. The mix of present and past was a bit jarring.\n* Made sure the dialogue matched between the sections.\n\nThe rest more subjective things I wanted to change:\n\n&gt;!* Made everything British. Sorry, you'll have to change it back.\n* Made 10 more childish: Used shorter sentences and smaller words;\n* Got rid of Pokemon references. Just seems a bit cheap to me. The rest is so poetic, it stands out too much.\n* Made 30 less angry and more shocked;\n* Tweaked that \"twist\" a little. It's such an important point it was worth getting just right;\n* 80 gives 10 a fresh lollipop because gross!\n\nTwo changes I'd like to make but I'm not a good enough writer to:\n\n&gt;!* Introduce Mom earlier. Perhaps 10 is a bit intimidated by all the men and wants mommy. Perhaps 50 is grieving her passing. The final section would have more of a punch if we were more aware of their relationship.\n* Tell us the interaction between 40 and 60 / 70 trying to calm him down from the older guys' perspective. You just focused on them consoling 50.\n\nHope you find this useful. Once again, it's a great story, well worthy of publication IMO.",

            "comment": "You watch the clock tick down to midnight. You know what will happen, because it has happened once before, ten years ago. Your ten year old self wanted to believe it was a dream, but too much of what was said came true for it to just be imaginary. \n\nThe moment you turn 20, your bedroom faded away and you are seated at a business table with 8 other versions of yourself. The youngest versions of yourself are seated in approximately age order with golden plaques proclaiming each person\u2019s age. The eldest you at age 90 sits at the head of the table. An honorary 0 is at the other end, but baby you is not present.\n\nThe 10 year old you is fidgeting nervously. You remember what it was like, so you put a reassuring hand on your younger self\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, you\u2019re okay. This is a meeting with all the older versions of you. You can ask any question  you want and we\u2019ll do our best to answer them. That sound okay?\u201d\n\nThe ten-year old nodded and you have a strange sense of deja-vu as you remember the same speech given to you a decade ago. \n\nThe ninety-year old calls the meeting to order by banging a small gavel. \u201cWelcome, welcome all to the decades of Max. My name is Max and your name is Max. We are all the same person from a different decade. To make it easier, please address everyone by their age. I am 90. Let us welcome our youngest member, 10 year old Max.\u201d\n\nThe room is filled with clapping and shouts of \u201cWhoo 10.\u201d Your youngest self looked as nervous as you felt back then. 10 waves shyly at the table. Everyone settles down and 90 addresses 10 directly. \u201cThis is all very new to you. Do you have any questions?\u201d\n\n10 looks at you, probably most comfortable with the youngest person in the room compared to all these adults. You nod encouragingly and 10 takes a deep breath before launching into a stream of questions. \n\nHeads were turned to you for answers. It makes sense, you experienced all these things recently. Relatively recently compared to the rest. While older versions of yourself answer some of the \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d type questions, it falls into you to answer anything about the near future. \n\nYou do your best, and when 10 tires out, your youngest self leans down on the table and falls asleep. Almost instantly, a sparkly fog surrounds 10 and your younger self disappears. Now everyone is looking at you for questions. \n\n\u201cWhen will I fall in love?\u201d This was the question weighing on my mind for years now. I knew I could ask my future selves about it and I needed to know. \n\n\u201cYou will fall in love in your decade,\u201d 40 diplomatically states, sending a stern glare at 30. Your decade older self seems ready to gush about someone, but remains quiet.\n\n\u201cDo I get any more detail than that? Will I meet the one tomorrow or when I\u2019m 29?\u201d an awkward quiet settles in.\n\n80 breaks the tension, \u201cNothing is entirely set in stone. After 10, you can make the most changes in our lives. Us older folks don\u2019t want our lives to change much, so revealing too much information could be harmful.\u201d\n\nYou clench your fist under the table. Your older selves are being selfish. \u201cThen what\u2019s the point of these meetings every decade? None of us know why we get the opportunity to talk to different versions of me throughout the decades, but we do. If all this has happened before, why didn\u2019t you know what I was going to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh to be young and rebellious,\u201d 60 murmurs wistfully, which doesn\u2019t help your cause.\n\nUnder the table, you feel 30 pass you a note. You peak a glance at it. The note has a date 4 years in the future. You memorize that date until it\u2019s seared into your memory. \n\nYou ask about other things that are more mundane. You get reassurance that the job you accept after college will not be your job forever. You are told the best way to prepare for a major disaster that can\u2019t be avoided. \n\nBy the end of your turn, you feel exhausted. It hits you all at once. You suppose that it\u2019s to keep you from learning too much as your eyes have difficulty staying open. Both eyes close heavily and the next time you open them, you are back in your bedroom.\n\nYou look down and find the message 30 send you still clutched in your fist. You smooth it out. It\u2019s unmistakably your hand writing, even though you are positive you didn\u2019t write it ... yet. \n\nYou bring the paper to your heart. Only a few more years. You feel yourself smiling as you plan out the decade to come.",

            "comment": "Nature versus nurture. Am I \"me\" because of a bad experience or because of something rotten smuggled genetically from generation to generation, that lies hidden in the deepest little cavern in my brain? Are any of us more than a hunter or a gatherer stuffed into a suit as if it were a straitjacket?\n\nI committed a crime. I'm not certain the specifics are relevant, at least not right now, but the punishment is (I believe) worth talking about. It's a kind of community-continuum service. What that entails is: you are arrested and thrown in a pitch black room, then, after a few minutes, another door is opened and you walk into a second room filled with past and previous versions of yourself. You talk to them and get to know them a little. Tell them what you did (the crime) and why you did it. Although, of course, the future yous already know why and when and all that, and in that way it's simply a self-confession. Cathartic, apparently.\n\nYou do this every ten years for forty years.\n\nThe reasons for this punishment are:\n\n1. To remember how innocent you were when young, and what potential lay ahead of you. An empty diary, just your name on the front, ready to be filled. To think to yourself *just where and why did I go wrong?*\n2. To meet a future-self that has overcome what you are going through now. To understand that your life has entered a long dark tunnel but that you'll come out eventually and be a better person. That life is worth living still.\n\nLet me add this: the young you is ALWAYS innocent, naive, hopeful of the future; the older yous are ALWAYS content, bordering happy, looking back on a life well lived except for that one little blip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, at this point - after that first meeting - the therapy can begin.\n\nYou talk it out with a shrink; you tell them what you learned from the meeting of selves (wouldn't Freud have loved that idea?). The therapist would work out how changed you are by the experience and then prescribe a level of treatment. Maybe helping paint houses or carrying shopping-bags for old ladies. Little stuff that fills you with a sense of worth.\n\nOr it doesn't, because you're not changed. Because seeing the older and younger \"you\" didn't mean shit, because they're not \"you\" right now. Because the body completely regenerates itself with new sets of cells every seven to ten years. Meaning, they're not you and never were or will be They're people who you share some memories with, but you right now, you're you - so fuck them. I'm sorry if this gets confusing. Less so for the profanity.\n\nThey are the two outcomes of this therapy. A (self-change) and B (not changed). A is the more common.\n\nEither way, you'll meet up with your future and past selves four times total, before being freed or being \"changed\" - depending on the A/B outcome.\n\nOf course, you don't know the end game of the therapy. You think that no matter what, when you're done, you're getting out. You don't even know you're in a VR world, lying hooked up to a mess of wires on a cold table. You don't know that your perception of time has been slowed massively and that forty years for you are three hours real life, that everyone you've known for those years are AI scripts.\n\nYou don't know that if you fail this test that's not been fully explained, they'll wipe most of your mind. Revert it back to that first stage: to an innocent child about to write their first diary entry. Wiping any memories after ten-years of age. Sometimes, depending on childhoods, they go back further. And they call it giving you a second chance, and they guide you, nurture you, and change the human-factor that made you the criminal you are.\n\nIt takes hours to cure a murderer, one way or another. Minutes to fix a shoplifter.  If their mind is wiped, VR teaches and nurtures them the correct way.\n\nThis is the gold standard of criminal rehabilitation. Treatment as it has been for thirty years. No flaws. Perfect and enviable.\n\nExcept, a week ago, the cops found a lady's body. Or bits of it. And the modus operandi matched that of a murder ten years prior.\n\nThey questioned me. And they stared at me. And they knew.\n\nThey told me about this old murder as if it was a threat.\n\nA woman in a lake chopped up like onions for a stir-fry. Just like the new body they'd found. Do you understand what we're saying, they asked. Then they left with that ominous little story told.\n\nI had to do my own research later to find the face of that previous killer.\n\nCould have just looked in the mirror.\n\nI can't help what I am. I can't help it if there's another one soon, another lady in the lake. If there is, her blood will be on the cops' hands because they didn't arrest me even though they knew.\n\nCould have. But didn't.\n\nBecause to arrest me would be to admit a wrong ingredient in their perfect little recipe. Failure of their system. Their world.\n\nIt would be to admit that they don't have control over man. That deep down, we're all more that just the result of nurture. It's not how we're raised or what we're taught -- the best that learning can do is restrain our truest instincts.\n\nHold them back, for a time.\n\nNo, it's not how we're raised that matters in the end.\n\nAll that matters is *what* we are.",

It\u2019s just that they take a little longer, up to 70-80 years, or more, depending on the person. \n\nYou see, when a cell is about to divide, it pauses it\u2019s function, thus being able to form other two daughter cells faster. If that were the case for neurons, we would be brain dead every time neurons would regenerate (well technically, not the entire brain, just the fragment that is regenerating). But let\u2019s suppose the part that is regenerating controls your breathing, or your eyesight or the contraction of your muscles. You can not control when your neurons regenerate and the effects would be catastrophic. \n\nThat being said, scientist have observed that elders do regenerate their neurons, but although their brain could still work (if they don\u2019t suffer from dementia, alzheimer, sclerosis, parkinson, etc...), their body is at its limit. \n\n(Sorry about the biology lesson)\nEdit: typo",

An eye's information doesn't go through a single neuron at some point. At best it would be a glitch, a muscle twitch, one piece of information slightly off in your memory, a smidgeon of a blind spot in your vision compensated by the general fill-in-the-blanks natural algorithm the rest of the neurons around it will do.",

It's impossible!\" 20 shouts. 30 grabs hold of him as the 3 elder versions talk him down. \n\nAs much as you want to help, you know your place lies upstairs.

You came back for my birthday!\" You look over to the young boy. For a moment you think about playing the role, but that wouldn't do him any good.\n\n\"No son,\" you say crouching down to look him in the eye \" I'm not Dad.\" \n\nBefore you remember what he does, 10 bolts to your parents room. He's going for the phone your mom kept next to her bed to call 911. You hear his Yelp of suprise. And he rushes back out again. \"WHERE'S MOM? AND WHY IS THERE AN OLD GUY IN HER BED?\" \n\n\"That's us when we're 90. And there's nobody else here. Just us from different points in time.\n\n\"Holy crap this is crazy!\" 10 says. \n\nYou chuckle a bit. \"Yeah, it is. But it's alright you have nothing to worry about.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" 10 says \" If you're me from the future, can I ask you questions?\"\n\n\"You can ask, I just can't give you-\"\n\n\"Am I rich?\" 10 says cutting you off. \"Does Alice like me back? Do we get married? How old am I when I become an astronaut? Do I meet the president? Do I-\"\n\n\"Woah, slow down son. I can't answer specific questions.\"\n\nHe was quiet for a few moments.\n\n\"Does Dad come back?\" He asks quietly, eyes downcast.\n\n\"I think you already know the answer.\" Knowing whats coming you reach out to yourself, and hold him as the tears start to flow. You hear him trying to speak between sobs.\n\n\"I-I'll be better. I promise.\" You hold him tight, knowing you kept his promise. Eventually the tears dry up and he lets go of you, sniffling. \"So who are you?\" He says after running the last tears from his eyes. \" If I'm 10, and the guy in mom's bed is 90, who are you?\"\n\n\"40.\" \n\n\"How many more are there?\" \n\n\"There are six more; 20, 30, 50, 60, 70 and 80, they're waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It's your 10th birthday! They don't want to eat cake without you.\" You say with a smile. \"Go down and meet them. I'll catch up.\"\n\n10 nods and walks down the hall towards the dining room. \n\nYou watch him go. You want to follow him but you feel a tugging at your mind.\n\n You turn, looking to the half opened door to your mother's room. The last time you saw 90 was when you ran in to call the cops about the strange man in your house. \n\nHe was propped upright in your mother's bed, neatly made blankets up to his waist. He was looking at a photo of your family, before she cut Dad out of all the pictures.\n\n\"Do you still remember her?\" You ask as you sit down on the side of the bed. \n\n\"Thankfully God saw fit to keep my memory intact.\" His voice was no more gruff than 70, so hopefully that means you end up quitting later on. \n\n\"God? We've never been too religious.\"\n\n\"Things change.\"\n\n\"No atheists in the trenches I guess.\" 90 doesn't respond. After a few minutes you ask the question that's been on your mind. \"You're the last of us?\"\n\n\"I am.\" \n\n\"Do you know what does us in?\" \n\n\"I think so.\" He says with a sigh.\n\n\"Don't suppose you'll tell me what it is.\" \n\n\"Cancer, a couple different kinds.\" He says.\n\n You're shocked for a few seconds, you never expected him to actually tell you that- the most sought after question. Eventually you muster up a \"Damn.\"\n\n\"Damn.\" He agrees.\n\n\"I'm surprised you told me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says with a sigh \"I figured there ain't much you can do to stop it, and lord knows you've been through enough to not get squeamish about it.\" He was right. You immediately recognize how silly a realization that is. of course he was right. He's you after all.\n\n\" I stay here with you the rest of the night don't I?\"\n\n\"You got another few visits to this house, you can spare this one to indulge a dying old man.\" \n\n\"I suppose I can.\"",

            "comment": "The first meeting had been funny. I hadn't expected it to be real, I thought people were playing a prank or something. I'd acted like a 10 year old.\n\nI hate 10 year old me. Oh my god how I hate that brat. The second meeting was funny, I sort of remembered the stuff I had done before and appreciated the commitment to detail the pranksters had made playing it on me a second time, I played along with 10 year old me a bit.\n\nI mean, I had been 20 right? Who gets life at that age. Nobody telling you to listen to them gets listened to, even if it was myself! I had wondered about the other me's that kept trying to control the meeting, tell the younger selves 'important' information. \n\nThe table was arranged in age order, it was fairly chaos down the young end. The far end however. When I sat near the middle, I think it was 40 year old me I was starting to look up the table not down. While 10 year old me was being a brat and 20 year old me was enjoying playing around with him, 30 year old me tried to scream and shout at them, tell them things they didn't want to listen to. 40 year old me was starting to realise which way I needed to look, and it wasn't down to my younger self. I couldn't teach them anything, because, well quite frankly I knew I hadn't. I remembered being them, I remembered this meeting.\n\nI looked at him. The head of the table. He sat in silence. Sometimes he glanced my way. I once got a nod of acknowledgement from him. Like he realised that this was the point I started to learn. Neither side of the table offered much for the me of 40 and 50. 60 was sad. Inconsolable. 70 looked at him with pity and sometimes tried to console him. 70 and 80 spent their time talking together, smiling, nodding at references I wouldn't get for years.\n\n90... 90 Just sat. Watching it all. He knew the outcome of every meeting, what I had learned, what I had lost and what I had ignored. he knew the price I had paid for every decision, for the chaos I caused as 10 year old me. For the arrogance of 20 year old me. He understood but had no time for the intolerance and indignation of 30 year old me. 50 was the only one that acknowledged me at 40 really. He tried to give me hints, tips without giving too much away. It turns out that information from the future was dangerous. I had lost 3 possible wives by trying to interfere with how a relationship would play out. So it was hints and guidance I received from my older self.\n\nThe meeting ended the same way every time. Of course it did, I understood now that it was the same meeting, it really was me in every chair.\n\nThe end had seemed a joke at 10. It was almost as funny at 20. 30 was angry at it. At 40 I knew what to expect but didn't really understand. 50 spent the time looking at it, nervous. Trying to work out what 60 was so upset by. 60 had no time for any of me, too busy with his own pain. It was 70 and 80 that seemed to understand as 90 called an end to the meeting. They seemed to understand his words.\n\n\"I never learned the truth of this meeting. I never learned who I should be looking to, or listening to when it really mattered. I know those of me hearing these words either don't care, don't understand, or hear them too late. But look at the final version of me, and know the truth of your life.\"\n\nI pondered those words as I attended at 50. I knew I had to help myself at 40, I couldn't cheat the stock market or line up the perfect marriage but I could remind him about healthy living. The heart attack had been a real scare, but it could have been so much worse. If I hadn't changed my lifestyle after this meeting at 40 it would have been the last time I attended. The final words started to scare me and I realised something I had never paid attention to in the room before.\n\nIt was as we left and each me turned to walk out one by one to return to my life I realised. I counted them out as I left. 10 year old me ran laughing from the room with pockets full of biscuits pilfered from the snack tray. 20 year old me laughed following with a large mug full of coffee. 30 Year old me stormed out shouting after them to listen to him. My 40 year old self walked calmly out, contemplating what to do with the rest of my life.\n\nAs I left, at 50 I turned to look at the room, and counted the chairs.\n\nAll 10 chairs.\n\n9 that had held various versions of me. One that had never been sat in.\n\n90 Looked at me as I realised, he had known for a long time of course. He to me nodded as it started to sink in.",

            "comment": "\"But, I don't understand...\"\n\n\"You don't need to understand it. You just need to follow the rules.\" I hear myself saying it in unison with the others, at the same time as I remember hearing it myself, when I stood where she stands now. At one time I'd told myself I wouldn't say it - I was just a scared little girl and it hadn't made me feel any better at the time - but here I am, saying it to myself like a pre-programmed robot. I should have run to her and held her and told her it was all going to be ok, but the words had just tumbled out of my mouth like half forgotten song lyrics. I was always going to say them. \n\n\"What rules?\" she asks, I asked, with a shaky voice.\n\nI take a breath, because I'm not the one who answered last time. It was one of the oldest ones, and I see it in their eyes as they realise that they're up. Their memory of this day means they know, just as all but one of us does, what they have to say next.\n\n\"The rules which govern the time loop,\" she starts. One day I'll have to recite these words, so I try to pay attention, but I can't take my eyes off of me - the younger me - as she hears all of this for the first time. I remember what it felt like, how frightened I was, and at the same time how convinced I was that this was all a ridiculous dream. But 10 years on, and I'm back, in more ways than one. \n\nThere are 9 of us here, each 10 years apart in age. I'm 20, to the day, so this is only my second time in this room. Looking around I can see that I'll age gracefully, and I'll never lose the dimple in my right cheek. I see that I'll chop all my hair off by my 40th birthday, and that the short style will suit my face. I see that I'll have an angry scar on my shoulder by 50, and a softer, gentler smile by 60. I can also see that I'll wear a wedding ring on my left hand for at least 30 years, and on a chain around my neck for 30 after that.\n\nI'm still explaining, and still listening to the rules. And then I remember that I tried to run. In a moment, she'll push back her chair and make for the door, determined to outrun this dream, or nightmare. But someone stopped me. I stopped me. So as 10 year old me jumps up, so do I, and I reach for myself as I did 10 years ago. I'll block her exit and calm her down, bring her back to the table so the elders can finish explaining how important our role in the universe is. I'll begin to understand the enormity of it and I'll still be frightened but I'll also realise that I'm part of something bigger. There will be moments in the next 10 years when I'll falter and wish that none of this had ever happened to me, but in the end I'll follow the rules and I'll come back to this room. I'll play my part and keep the loop closed.\n\nBut when I reach for myself, something happens. I slip, and she twists, and I stumble, and she gets to the door. And I'm still reaching out but she's gone. \n\nEveryone is silent for a moment, and then the eldest of us, lets out a deep breath.\n\n\"Well shit. That's never happened before!\"",

            "comment": "He tells me about time. \n\nThe church is empty, desolate, abandoned. Plaster falls from the ceiling like brown snowflakes on the wooden pews. There we sit, in neat rows, staring at the pulpit. Each one of us is different. Some old, some young. Through this haggard sludge of life, we trudged, and all for this moment: \n\nHe walks steadily towards the pulpit. Grey hairs coat the wrinkles on his hands, his skin aged and calloused, his eyes dim and fading. He clears his throat and we sit at attention. His words are precious. \n\n\u201cI have a theory,\u201d he says. \u201cThat time is not a linear progression of cause to effect. Rather, it is a subtle tapestry that connects the past, present, and future into a single moment. Everything happens at once.\u201d\n\nHe opens the left pocket of his pinstripe suit. Removes a leather-bound journal, fresh, unmarred, unwritten. He hands it to the youngest. \n\nThe first time I felt the journal in my hands, it was like so much responsibility had been thrust my way. Duty. How I could I not stare at the blank pages and wonder how they would fill? Or what If the journal was lost, destroyed, abandoned? Destiny. \n\nI ran from it. \n\n***  \n  \n\nShe walked slowly from the bathroom. Golden hair fell in curls down her shoulder, messy, unkempt. Her footsteps plodded on the linoleum and she slumped on the couch. Our apartment was small, cramped, and obnoxiously loud from the AC unit I couldn\u2019t afford to fix. I watched the pregnancy test slip from her hands and fall on the carpet. \n\nIf everything happens at once, then the two solid lines are already formed. I am already a father; I have always been one. But in the moment between now and when those lines run red, I can pretend. I can hope. \n\nShe looks up with wet eyes and fears destiny. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not yours,\u201d she says. \n\nAnd if everything happens at once, then I can always hear myself screaming. \n\n***  \n  \n\nWe sit in the church pews. He puts a comforting hand on my shoulder. He is ten years older and ten years wiser. He knows my future but cannot tell me. But now I understand the hurt in his eyes, that longing, that urge to run towards our younger self, embrace him, tell him to run. \n\nBut in my jacket pocket, the journal\u2014now twenty years old\u2014rests snugly. I imagine the rest of us have one just like it. I sit back as the older stands, walks towards the pulpit and begins. \n\n\u201cI have a theory,\u201d he says\u2026\n\n***  \n  \n\nWeddings are no place for tears. \n\nBut my eyes run ragged when I see her for the first time, veiled in the softest white, glowing. She walks slowly down the aisle and my heart walks with her. I never thought I would find love again. I never thought I deserved it. But if everything happens at once, then heartbreak was less than a heartbeat from then until now.  \n\nAnd if everything happens at once, I don\u2019t ever want to live a different moment. \n\nI lift the veil and her blue eyes sparkle like the day we first met. \n\nShe wipes her eyes, and I can\u2019t help but smile, because we both know that weddings are no place for tears. \n\n***  \n  \n\nThe tattered journal nearly slips from my pocket during the ceremony. I can\u2019t help but wonder how long this will take\u2014I\u2019ve seen in thrice before\u2014never learning anything new. My daughter will be late for her dance recital and I can\u2019t help but worry about the mortgage, the company sinking under, the brown spots on the lawn. Everything happens at once but it takes an eternity for the old man to stand and recite the words I know by heart. \n\n\u201cI have a theory,\u201d he says\u2026\n\nAnd I have a theory that the only thing that matters today is the comforting hand I lay on the shoulders of my ten-year-younger self. I cannot say whether his life will be different from mine, but I remember the reassuring touch, the knowledge that life gets better, that bad things come and pass like the changing seasons. \n\n***  \n  \n\nIt\u2019s terminal. \n\nThe words ring through my ears and rattle without meaning. Terminal. And end to a cycle started years ago, cut short. My hands are as numb as the left side of my wife\u2019s face. I\u2019m sitting there at her bedside, watching saline and medicine drip-drip through the clacking IV pump, praying for a miracle I know will never come. \n\n\u201cStay with me?\u201d she asks. \n\nLike this was ever a question. \n\nAnd everything happens at once. I am meeting her for the first time after moving into my new apartment. I am at her father\u2019s house begging permission. I am standing teary-eyed reciting my wedding vows. Our daughter is born and grown and life happens all at once. \n\n\u201cStay with me?\u201d\n\nBut I never left. I never left you\u2026\n\n***  \n  \n\nThe pulpit is old and worn but somehow still so incredibly unfamiliar. I see the faces before me, the faces to come after me, knowing that it all is irrelevant. The moments pass but they never pass. Time winds down but always starts again. \n\nBecause every moment makes a memory, and the weight of memories is a burden that no time can heal, the wounds ripped raw every decade as I sit unable to act, unable to change destiny, a slave to time itself. \n\n\u201cI have a theory,\u201d he says\u2026\n\n***  \n  \n\nEverything happens at once. \n\nI am at my daughter\u2019s wedding walking her down the aisle. She is beautiful. The man she has married, will marry, is about to marry looks at her like it\u2019s the first time. \n\nAnd I stand in his place living my own moment. \n\nAnd I stand in my first apartment watching the first love pack her belongings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not yours,\u201d she says, and I can't help but wonder if she means the memories of the past, the future, or the journal sitting on the coffee table. \n\nI am alone, scared, sitting in my new apartment when my wife-to-be knocks on the door asking to borrow flour for her pancakes. \n\nI feel alone, scared, ten years old, watching the old man rise. He walks towards the pulpit and studies the casket beyond. \n\nEverything happens at once and I walk with him. \n\n***\n  \n\nI tell them about time. \n\nThe church is empty, desolate, abandoned. Plaster falls from the ceiling like brown snowflakes on the wooden pews. They sit in neat rows, staring. Each one of us is different but all are the same. We have grown old together, grown so far that it feels like a eternity can suspend in one moment. \n\nIn my suit are two journals. \n\nThe first one, unblemished, I hand to the youngest. I tell him to hold it with reverence. I tell him to remember this moment for the rest of his life. \n\nThe second journal is old, tattered, frayed. My story is written in the fold of the pages. Everything happens at once, for me. I write every word in every moment of every memory. \n\nAnd I place the journal in the open casket. \n\nMy face looks so serene, at the end. I wonder if I pass peacefully. All my life I\u2019ve lived knowing this is my destiny. I can run. I can hide. I can try and fight what I know always happens\u2014nothing changes. But I don\u2019t need to run or hide. I can only stop, smile, and reflect on the moment of my life. \n\nEverything happens at once, the good and the bad, and that is what makes life worth living. So, I stand and deliver my own eulogy. Time after time. The words that steady my own heart. \n\n\u201cI have a theory,\u201d I say. \n***\nMore Stories at r/BLT_WITH_RANCH",

            "comment": "With a bang on my gavel, Most Senior began the proceedings. My raspy voice barely reached the microphone, but every self who was sitting around the large round table hushed to accommodate. After all, there was nothing any of my selves could say to me that I didn't already know at that point. I first began by kindly greeting Junior and asking me if I'd like to be excused to go and play with my toys in the corner of the room. I smiled and obliged- of course, I'd been taught to respect my elders, even when my elder was me. After all, Junior didn't have much to contribute, and if I was being honest, I felt intimidated seeing me so much. \n\nAs I did every ten years, The Uncertain scrambled in at that moment, books practically pouring out of my bag as I tripped over the threshold. I gripped my head, my emotions threatening to overwhelm me- I was trying my hardest, but nothing seemed to work. And now here I was, coming to the most important Meeting of my life, ruining it like I'd ruined everything. In that moment, The Collected came to me, lifting me up with my firm grip. I patted The Uncertain gently, reassuring me that it was okay. That I understood.\n\nI sat down cautiously and looked at Most Senior. My eyes twinkled slightly, and I asked if The Uncertain would like to take the time to study. After all, I knew better than most my age just how badly I was struggling at the time. The Uncertain nodded and set about my work, but I couldn't help but glance at The Wayward. \n\nHe was there, sitting directly to the left of The Uncertain and to the right of The Collected, a glassy look in his eyes and an unfinished bottle directly in front of him. He didn't face me, he didn't face Most Senior- and he couldn't bare to look in the hopeful eyes of Junior. Most Senior gave a sigh as I looked at The Wayward, remembering all that had happened in those short ten years. The Uncertain couldn't help but feel hopeless as I looked at him. The Collected rubbed his back and whispered something to him, and he just nodded, sat up, and made his way to the door. He took a single peek at Junior, then looked back at the Uncertain, and finally, at Most Senior. He raised a fist to his heart, a fire lighting in his eye. He was the one I felt for the most- yet he was still the one I refused to call me. \n\nMost Senior cleared my throat. \"As we all know... this will be the last Meeting I'll experience. I just want to open it up by saying... I thank all of us for making my way here. My life has been long... and I've always been able to think positively toward the future, because I can see the next self that I'll become.\"\n\nI looked to The Uncertain, nodding as if to say that even I was included in that. I thought on that for a moment, and thought of the fire in his eyes. Yes, even I could look forward to the next ten years. I looked back at my books, and his fire filled me with renewed vigor. The Uncertain would not speak for the rest of the meeting, but that was just the way I wanted it to be.\n\nThe Vibrant, sitting to the left of The Collected, sat back in my chair and nodded. \"I don't think I would have gotten here if I didn't see you all. If I didn't have these meetings-\"\n\nJust as I always did, The Settled shook my head, \"I disagree. You know, looking back... I definitely felt that I needed these Meetings, but deep down, they didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know. Life isn't easy. I'm not always on the right path. I stumble, I misstep, but I make a plan, and I get moving on it.\"\n\nThe Collected laughed aloud and gestured at the door, the mood lightening now that the heaviness of The Wayward had been alleviated. \"Yeah? Try telling that to him.\"\n\nThe Contented, sitting to the left of the Vibrant, looked at me, \"You know, I would if he was still here. The plan I made when I was him... I'm still on that path. All of me are.\"\n\nThe Declining gave a nod. \"Every Meeting, it's hard to see him as me... but he did more for me than I ever did for this Meeting.\"\n\nMost Senior gave a breathy chuckle, more like wind passing through trees than the hearty, boisterous guffaw that The Collected had conjured up, \"That's because I'm a crazy old codger!\"\n\nAll of myselves laughed along with me, even The Uncertain. I all said some variation of, \"I talk to myself every ten years, I think it's safe to say I all are!\"\n\nThe room quieted down, as we all knew what was coming next. Junior rubbed my eyes, ambling tiredly across the carpeted floor. I yawned loudly, and the gesture spread across the room like wildfire. I climbed up, half-delirious, into Most Senior's decrepit lap, my arm gripping my shoulder as I curled into my embrace. Most Senior made a motion to symbolize striking the gavel, and mouthed, 'adjourned.'\n\nOne by one, I all left the Meeting, until only Junior and Most Senior remained. I looked down at him, and the room seemed to fade around me. I looked at my granddaughter, Eleanor, whose strong and vibrant arms helped me hold her son, Ezekiel Junior, tightly to my chest. \n\nHer eyes were filled with wonder and tears, and she spoke shakily, \"Is the Meeting done, Grandpa Zeke?\"\n\nI nodded softly, breathing out my words. \"Meeting's done... I'll... see you tomorrow, alright Eleanor?\"\n\nShe nodded, taking her sleeping son back into her loving arms. \"I'll see you tomorrow. You... you crazy old codger.\" She hugged me tightly, kissing my forehead and leaving a teardrop on my balding head.\n\nI looked back at her as she left, and the nurse held my arm happily, wheeling me back to my bed. She helped me lay down, and I smiled up at her. \"Miss Jane, thanks so much. I'll see you tomorrow.\"\n\nHer eyes were hard to read, seemingly looking through me. She checked the documents and cleared her throat. \"Yes, Ezekiel. I'll see you tomorrow.\"\n\nShe left the hospice room, flipped off the lights. I closed my eyes, and faded into the dark.",

            "comment": "I sat down third. I was the third eldest\u2026 Or, I suppose, the third representation before death. Next was Sixty, Fifty, Forty, Thirty, all the way down to my youngest self. Ten. He appeared confused. He, by all means, had the right to be the only one seemingly lost. We\u2019d all been here before. The Meeting Of Ages. It was his first time. I turned towards the head of the table as I heard a coarse, old throat clearing, it was Ninety.\n\n\u201cWelcome, my young equals.\u201d he wearily conveyed. \u201cSpecifically to Ten, you\u2019re me, but I\u2019m you. Your older you. Eighty years ago I once sat where you are.\u201d\n\nAt this, Ten expelled his shyness and fear. He understood. Just as I had, long ago.\n\nNinety surveyed the table, once again clearing his throat, pronouncing, \u201cThe rules are simple. We cannot interfere with each other. We cannot give advice. We cannot change our timeline. That\u2019s the gist of it.\u201d\n\nMy eyes dashed across the room to Ten as he blurted, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you give advice? What if I don\u2019t want to turn out like you!?\u201d\n\nI, Sixty, Eighty, and Ninety sighed. Twenty, at the sight of this, twisted to Ten.\n\n\u201cShut it \u2018ya fool!\u201d He bopped Ten on the top of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s so we don\u2019t mess anything up!\u201d\n\n\u201cMess up what exactly?\u201d Ten elbowed Twenty in the ribs back.\n\nI and the other elders sighed. I turned to Sixty, \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re different people.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged weakly, \u201cI don\u2019t know my friend. I can only speculate as much as you\u2026 I\u2014can.\u201d\n\nWe transferred sorrowful gazes. Now Thirty through Fifty were in on the argument. Back when I was Ten, I saw my future ahead of me. My future didn\u2019t need a cane at the age of Eighty. I didn\u2019t have a worn-out, pale gaze upon life as the current Eighty and Ninety ahead of me do. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d turn out this way, where did I go wrong? Where did our timeline change? All these thoughts I pondered to myself quietly.\n\nI was zapped back from my musings as Ninety roared, \u201cQuiet, you fools!\u201d He had stood up from his chair, stooped over his cane, and pointed angrily at them. \u201cWe don\u2019t advise the others because back when I was Ten there were eleven chairs! There were others!\u201d He gasped, \u201cDouble-O and Ten-Two!\u201d His face was puffed up and crimson red.\n\nWide-eyed, Sixty, Eighty, and I couldn\u2019t recall this\u2026 There was always only nine chairs\u2026 Our timeline must\u2019ve been different from his just as the others younger than us were different. The young ones were intrigued as well\u2026 If only they knew. If only they knew what our childhood was like. If only they knew what we were back then\u2026 I shuddered. Sixty and Eighty shuddered as well. Appears we were feeling and thinking the same; at least there\u2019s two others I still relate to.\n\nNinety continued, \u201cY\u2019all ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 like the original! I remember Ten-Two like it was yes\u2019tday; He didn\u2019t even need a cane. Somewhere along the line one of you messed up my life. I\u2019ll never see another meeting.\u201d He eyed Eighty while saying this.\n\nEighty looked back, understanding. He nodded. I was lost, as with the others. I looked to Fifty and Forty and they shrugged back at me. Doesn\u2019t matter, I thought, I\u2019d find out in ten years anyways. Ninety eyed the room with his deep glare once more, glancing back at Eighty. He stood straighter, ruffled himself, preparing to say something. Sixty and Fifty stopped talking to each other and looked back. Twenty and Thirty whispered, conspiring as well. Ten looked at him, willingly\u2026 confusingly\u2026 Acceptingly.\n\nThe clearing of Ninety\u2019s aged throat could once again be heard. \u201cAhem,\u201d he said.\n\nSilence. The younglings didn\u2019t want to hear anymore from this old grump-stump, but being the eldest, he inherited the ability to talk and speak what he wanted to them\u2026 To us.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the normal introductions, but first, the ritualistic countdown,\u201d he gave a slight nod to Eighty. \u201cI will be eight.\u201d\n\nEighty nodded, \u201cAnd I am seven.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t seem to get it. Shouldn\u2019t I be seven? They had a plan, and being the elders, I decided to follow along. \u201cI suppose that makes me six.\u201d\n\nWe glanced towards Sixty. He was flustered by this as well, but took it forward. \u201cAnd I, five.\u201d\n\nFifty, Forty, Thirty, Twenty, and Ten followed in line quickly after us, ending with Ten, who exclaimed, \u201cThat makes me zero!\u201d\n\nNinety and Eighty were silent. They sat down slowly, eyeing me. Because of this, I felt the younger gazes falling upon me too. I didn\u2019t understand. What did I do? I looked back to Ninety. What was left of him was his bare seat, next to where Eighty had sat as well. I felt dizzy, I felt weird. This hasn\u2019t happened in all the times leading up to me, Seventy. I don\u2019t remember any of this. The conversations had been slight variations every time we met from the last, but it was definitely not like this. Ten was gone. Twenty too. To get straight to it, the only people left were me and Sixty. I didn\u2019t understand and if I didn\u2019t understand then he sure as heck was just as befuddled as I. I stared at him, and he back at me. There\u2019s the birthmark, my birthmark, on his neck, just between the neck and right shoulder. The patch of skin that had always been smoother, brighter than the rest. Just longer than a finger. It faded. No. It didn\u2019t. I faded. Not I either\u2026 Everything was going away. A mist overtook me and I lost sight of him and my hands. During this time my heart had been beating so fast, but now\u2026 Now I felt no beat. I was nothingness. There was no me. I had seen my ten-year-old self disappear. That means that if he was gone, then I should be gone. Sixty and I were gone. How did it come to this? I imagined him. Sixty. Myself before now. Myself ten years ago, the one who eventually went through losing his\u2014my family in a car accident. The car accident because of that foolish, drunken taxi driver. I felt the grey collar shirt he wore. He was yelling at me. Why? This was my imagination of him. I don\u2019t even know how I remember myself so well when I was sixty. What\u2019s he doing? Ah. Water. Cold. I shivered, felt my heartbeat come back, beating back into life. My fingers were tense, frozen almost. I curled them slowly, painfully. A tingling sensation came to my nose. Breathing air. I had almost forgotten. It felt so nice, so smooth, so\u2026 lifelike.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me too!\u201d A screaming. More water. I gasped to life, snapping my newly blood-fed fingers to his neck.\n\n\u201cWhere am I?! What happened to us?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhere\u2019s the others!?\u201d I shook him violently, waiting for an answer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d was all he managed to whisper. \u201cI saw you fade away. No. We both faded, and then I was here,\u201d he declared, pointing at a rugged, box-patterned mattress.\n\nI looked around, still shivering from the cold water he\u2019d flushed me back into existence with. I was on a red, beaten up leather couch. There were two more buckets of water next to the two empty ones Sixty had splashed me with on the floor. Littered around were papers, wet, soiled notebooks, and writing utensils. The only thing that gave us light was a dimly lit lamp in the middle of the room. It had a cracked vase with red and white designs on it. Actually, I couldn\u2019t tell we were in a room. The light barely lit up where me and Sixty were.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Sixty objectively asked.\n\n\u201cWe should introduce ourselves,\u201d came a voice from the darkness.\n\nMy and Sixty\u2019s eyes darted to the edge of darkness, trying to see the voice\u2019s body. Two sets of feet stepped from the darkness. The first to come out had a gas mask covering his face. The second was the same height and appearingly, the same weight as the first. They both wore coat jackets with numbers on it. The masked man\u2019s coat showed the numbers 380 on the left and 70(3) on the right. The man next to him had the numbers 370 on the left and 60(3) on the right.\n\nThe masked man spoke first, in a mask-cluttered voice, \u201dI am 70-L-3.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I 60-L-3,\u201d the other said.\n\nSixty turned to me, almost pale-faced, \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought\u2026 What\u2026? But\u2026 I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014That\u2019s\u2026 Us\u2026\u201c I finished for him, a shudder running down my back.\n\nI knew he had the same feeling. Almost like a ghost had past through him, he was shaken. I should be like him, but it makes sense now. That\u2019s why Ninety and Eighty seemed so\u2026 Suspicious\u2026 \n\nThe only words Sixty managed to get out after his ghastly experience was, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll your questions will be answered. Come with us.\u201d They said simultaneously.\n\nMan, almost like they\u2019ve had practice\u2026 I stood first, and Sixty along with me. We followed them into the darkness, watching our steps. As soon as we were about to lose what was left of their silhouettes to the gloom, another dull, yellow light above flipped on.\n\nWhile walking, Sixty drew a breath, \u201cWh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the gas mask?\u201d 60-L-3 ignorantly said, \u201cBecause he was stabbed two centuries ago by 30-L-2\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat abou\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014It means loop. 70 loop three, 60 loop three\u2026 30 loop two\u2026 You get the idea, I\u2019d have gotten it by now.\u201d 70-L-3 interrupting this time.\n\nThey turned towards each other and laughed. Why did they have all the answers? Why did they answer before the question? What is going on? I glanced at Sixty. He was clearly astray as well. I glanced forward again. They were laughing.\n\n\u201cThey always come in the same,\u201d 60-L-3 gabbled.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d 70-L-3 grinned back.\n\nI forgot lights had lit the entire corridor. I was sure taken by thought. The corridor had come to an end, the final light lit up a huge door. There was a sign upon the door, reading \u201cThe Meeting For Ages\u201d in huge dark-red letters.",

I looked at 10 in disgust.\n\nWhat a wuss.\n\nBack in my day... well I was a wuss too actually.\n\nGod damnit.\n\n**\"Attention!\"** 20 slammed the gavel on the podium. The other me's quickly snapped to attention, but you could see the difference when 10 jumped a little in his seat immediately, while I took a few seconds to register he said anything at all. That's what being 90 does to you.\n\nWe have come here today for our second ever ***MEeting****!*\n\nI scoffed in the crowd. \"You mean our ninth?\"\n\n\"Shut up old man, no one asked.\"\n\nI've been through this before. I've seen me been through this before. I said this exact crude remark to 90 as well. This was happening all over again.\n\n\"Isn't this the first ewer? I'm sowry mistar, I... I don't know what's going on...\"\n\n10 began to cry. 20 kept talking like he heard nothing while 30 patted 10 on the back.  \n\"Cheer up sport! This is just our third meeting with our future selves! Don't you want to know what you'll be when you grow up?\"\n\n10 eyes widen. \"Wooooww! So exciting!\"\n\nI kept a tight lip. It's best if he didn't know.\n\n\"We have gathered here today to talk about me!\" 20's eyes lit up with green ambition. 30 chuckled heartily. As usual, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 were nowhere to be found. I felt regret slamming at my walls, sorrow about to breakthrough. But I stopped myself.\n\nStop thinking about why I wasn't there then.\n\n20 looked at 30. \"What happens, man?\" 30 smiled. \n\n\"You know Judith, from highschool?\"\n\n\"Yeah... WAIT, don't tell me...\"\n\n\"Yup! We just got married last Thursday! After I wrap up work at the World trade centre, we're planning on leaving for our honeymoon!\"\n\n\"HELL YES! Where are we headed too?\"\n\n\"Hawaii, just like we always wanted. It's so close too, I can't wait! September 12 is the day we leave!\"\n\n\"Wait, what year is this again? I need to know how long I'll be blue balled\"\n\n\"2001\"\n\nI close my eyes.\n\nThe noise fades into the background.\n\n10 tugs at my sleeve, and I give him a smile.\n\n\"What is it little one?\"\n\n\"Mistar, your face is wet.\"\n\n10 handed me his handkerchief. I looked at it. Still had all the goofy images mom drew. I played my reaction off as a cough, hoping they wouldn't notice the red eyes. They wouldn't anyway. Always caught up in the next big thing. Never appreciating something until it's gone...\n\nBAMN\n\nThe door kicked open. I see a wrinkly old man walk in. I'm not talking my wrinkly, I'm talking straight up crumbled paper ran over by a car. Maybe more than just one.\n\n\"I'm 100,\" he looks at me briefly, and I could see disappointment. Then he turned to 20, shuffling towards him with his walker.\n\nI could only look on in shock. Since when was there ever a 100? Did I make it that far? I think back to the rope I hung from my ceiling, and wondered why I stayed this long.\n\n\"100? Finally, another old me! Maybe this one isn't a pain in the ass. Welcome!\" 20 grinned like a Cheshire cat.\n\n\"Listen here, and listen good. I spent far too long in that dark place.\"\n\n100 looked me in the eye, a hint of sadness now replacing that disappointment from earlier.\n\n\"We won't be making it far past 100. Hell, I know this one won't make it the next year unless he listens good. But I decided I would change things. 20, 30. Both of you. Listen. Even at the lowest point, don't give in. Don't waste the gift of life, please. Don't regret it,\" 100 put a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"Don't regret it like the both of us did.\"\n\nFucking hell. I never thought I'd get to 100. Never wanted to. But despite him being 10 years older than me, he had a spring to his step that I wanted to be returned for years.\n\n\"I can't tell what happens, but I can say what changed from 90 on.\" He looked at me. \"If you want to listen.\"\n\nThis would be interesting.",

            "comment": "40 didn\u2019t show up this year.\n\nI expected the empty chair to loom over the meeting, but the older ones didn\u2019t pay it any mind - 20-year-old me had asked why the meeting was different from the way 10-year-old me remembers it last time, and 50 had explained that the beginning and the end were always the same, but the middle - the part that mattered - was different.  Every time we met, little things had changed.  It meant I was learning from myself.  I was correcting little mistakes.\n\n10-year-old me had been concerned with making friends in high school - I was three grades ahead - and all my other selves had told me to learn Latin.  It had seemed like an odd thing to do, but that had been the only thing everyone else had agreed on.  Latin was important.  By 20 I understood why.  It was how I met my best friend John.\n\nEventually I couldn\u2019t bear the curiosity anymore and finally asked about the chair.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with 40?  He should be here.  Did something happen?\u201d\n\n20-year-old me had stiffened at that.  Right - this was the first question that had been different from last time - did 10-year-old me notice whether 40 was there?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said 60 simply.  \u201cSomething DID happen.\u201d\n\n70 smiled.  \u201cI know we all look the same to you, given that we all look the same as you, but look closer.  What\u2019s different this year?\u201d\n\n\u201c40\u2019s not missing,\u201d said 10 suddenly, and I turned to look, startled.  \u201cHe\u2019s sitting in 50\u2019s chair.\u201d\n\nHe was right, I realized.  I had always been good at pattern recognition, but I guess somewhere along the way I lost that quality that all children have that makes them question everything they see without taking anything as granted.\n\n\u201cHe figured it out,\u201d said 40 simply.  \u201cHe told us he would, when he was only 10.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he told you to sit in his place, did he?\u201d asked 80.\n\n40 nodded.  \u201cExactly.  He said it was the only way to make sure it kept happening.  He needed himself to notice it at age 10 again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis meeting isn\u2019t actually different versions of the same person, is it?\u201d asked 10.  \u201cIt\u2019s different versions of us from different places.\u201d\n\n40 cracked a broad smile.  \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.  He told me last time that he\u2019d figured it all out, and that if he didn\u2019t show up this time that I should sit in his place.  Because eventually we\u2019ll all figure it out.  And when we do we\u2019ll find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind what?\u201d  I asked.  This whole conversation was getting a little too metaphysical and a lot too vague for me.\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d  Everyone turned to look at the door as a smiling 50 poked his head in.  \u201cEvery time we find it, it\u2019s something different.  At least, that\u2019s what the 90 from my first meeting said.  But every time we do, the next meeting we show up to, we\u2019re the only ones who remember being there before.  I finally cracked it - if I don\u2019t show up on time, there\u2019s a chance.  Looks like I was right, since the wrong chair\u2019s empty.  Now there\u2019s a real chance.  Now, in ten years\u2019 time, we can find the real meeting.\u201d  He paused to flash us another smile.  \u201cThe Board Meeting.\u201d  With one last wink, he closed the door.\n\nI sat back in my chair, flabbergasted.  \u201cThe Board of what?\u201d\n\nFor the first time that I remember, 100 spoke.  \u201cMeeting adjourned.\u201d\n\n-=-\n\nThanks for reading!  Let me know if you want me to continue.",

BUT the absent 50 (who would have been 40 in the narrator\u2019s last meeting), in his own meeting aged 10, noticed that 50 was absent. \n\nSo he also missed his own aged 50 meeting,  in the hopes that some Decade people would notice that some of them remembered 50 and some of them didn\u2019t. This would then make them realise they were all experiencing different timelines.\n\nAm I wrong? I\u2019m probably be wrong. I need to watch inception again",

Something that catches my eye is that I\u2019m the only boy in the room. I think it\u2019s weird but to stay polite I introduce myself to them. I brag about how I\u2019m doing really good in school and that I have all A\u2019s and that\u2019s it\u2019s my birthday. The first 3 women turn their heads and smile at me. It makes me feel a little calm, as if I know these people. It gets silent again and I start to look around more. I see the 4th woman and beyond, and they look like they\u2019re in pain. They have what looks like bruises around their neck and they look a little pale. They\u2019re scary. All of them have numbers floating above them. 90, 80, 70, 60, and 50 all look very pale, while 40, 30, and 20 look a little more filled with life. I look above my head and I see the number 10 above me, just like my age that I turned today. A soft sound came from above out of nowhere, and everyone turned to look at me. 20, 30, and 40 are all smiling and looking at me, while 50 through 90 look at me with an empty gaze. I hear a voice that sounds familiar to me. Mom. I hear her say, \u201cokay. Everyone here? Good. Let\u2019s start the meeting.\u201d I\u2019m confused about what this means but I\u2019m interrupted by a poke from 20. She looks down on me with a big smile and long flowing hair. I ask her who she is and she just giggles. She\u2019s kinda ugly, but it\u2019s rude to tell her that. 30 and 40 have light smiles on their faces and they ask me questions, like \u201cwhat\u2019s your favourite subject in school?\u201d \u201cHow are your brothers doing?\u201d \u201cHow is the cat?\u201d I\u2019m confused as to how they knew that I had a cat and brothers, but to go along with it, I answered truthfully. I told them that I like English and that my family and cat are good. They smile towards me and I smile back. I think to myself again, \u201cWhere is mom? I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d I look back at the clock on the table and it still says 5:12. 20 notices me look at the clock and puts her hand on my shoulder. She hands me a piece of paper that says \u201cit\u2019s okay. Make sure to talk to her. 3/07/13\u201d I want to ask her what it means but I feel my throat closing up. I can\u2019t do much of anything, until I wake up, in bed. The time is 5:13 and all I remember is the date, 3/07/13.",

I look over and see 30 and 40, both with smiles on their faces, and I glance over at 10, who is very confused. I remember being in that position when I was his age. I know he is confused as to why he\u2019s the only boy here, but it would be better for him to experience life for itself. I didn\u2019t want to tell him that he was going to fall into a depression because he wasn\u2019t born a girl. I didn\u2019t want to tell him that life just gets harder and harder with more and more pills being taken. My thoughts are interrupted with the sound of my mom announcing that the meeting has started. I notice he looks at me with a face in confusion. All I can really do is smile at him. I know what he is thinking, that I look ugly. I don\u2019t blame him because I am. I am ugly and I know that I don\u2019t pass, but it\u2019s the only thing keeping me sane is believing that one day I won\u2019t be looked at as some freak, but rather a beautiful woman that I was born to be. I poke him and hand him a note that says some information about the future that I want him to know, without telling him outright. 30 and 40 broke the silence and started asking 10 different questions. I could see he was a little confused as to how they knew so much about him, but he answered genuinely. He was always a good kid and was always very shy. I take one last glance around the room and notice 50-90 are just as lifeless as before. A haze falls over me. I know what this means. Waking up in my own bed, i look at the time that reads 05:13",

The young boy, the young girl, me, the older me, and the 5 other lifeless versions. Again, I hear the voice of mom saying that the meeting has started. 20 year old me gives 10 year old me a weak smile and a piece of paper. I hate 20 year old me. I hate the amount of life she has and her jovial expressions. I hate that young me\u2019s love of life left when my wife divorced me. I- er, we thought we would be together forever. She was the only one to see me for who I was before I started transitioning. She gave me a reason to live. She was the one who helped me with my makeup. As ugly as it was, it was affirming to my fragile mind at the time. I swallowed the hatred I feel for 20 and turn to 10, where I ask him all different questions to make sure he is comfortable. He answers all of them with a sense of superiority, like he\u2019s the smartest in the room. Typical of me. While 10 and 20 are conversing, I turn to 40 and ask her if she knew what was up with the other 5. She looks at me with a look that says she\u2019s tired. I try making out what this means, but before I can finish thinking, that same haze falls over me and I wake up in my bed, the clock reading 05:13.

The voice of mom starts up the meeting and I notice 30 looking at 20 with a sense of hatred and scorn. I know why she feels like that, but at this age, I don\u2019t really care anymore. I moved on from her and tried dating again, only to find that I couldn\u2019t accept that my partner wasn\u2019t her. Once again, 20 hands 10 the piece of paper. I sometimes regret handing myself that paper. Maybe life would have been better if I found all of this out for myself rather than having specific dates and messages handed to me. Again, 30 and I ask 10 different questions to make him more comfortable. Again, 10 and 20 converse with each other, while 30 turns to me. I know just from her gaze that she knows how I\u2019m feeling. The sense of emptiness from the years of self hatred and broken relationships that have occurred over my gender identity. She asks me if I know anything about the other five, but all I can do is give her a look that says that I\u2019m tired of it all. I know that I can\u2019t tell her how shitty life gets over the decade, but I know she knows. I know she knows what\u2019s going to happen when I leave this meeting. I see her go into a haze as ritual. I look at the other 5 as they creak their heads towards me. Their lifeless eyes lock with mine and I smile to them. The haze falls over me and I wake up in my bed, clock reading 05:13. I k ow I can\u2019t wait any longer, so I write out a little note for whoever finds me. I wrote about how I\u2019m sorry for everything I have done up to this point. I end it with my name, both deadname and current name. I give the note a little smile, almost reminiscent as something I would give to my mom at age 10. I get the rope out of the closet and begin to tie it around the rod of my shower.

The pistons on the pneumatic door hissed as the shell cracked open. A man with a grey beard and a slender tweed suit emerged from the pod.\n\n\"Whoa! What is that thing?\" Bradley shouted.\n\n\"What is *that* thing?\" the old man countered as he approached the boy. \"A Nintendo Switch?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Huh,\" the old man crooked his head to the side. \"I don't remember having one of those when I was a kid.\"\n\n\"Mister, I don't think these were around when you were a kid,\" the boy said. \"No offense.\"\n\nThe old man chuckled.\n\n\"What ya playing?\"\n\n\"Fortnite,\" Bradley replied.\n\n\"Ha, I remember when I thought Fortnite was cool,\" the man laughed.\n\n\"Fortnite is cool.\"\n\n\"We don't have time to argue, Bradley,\" the old man smiled. \"You and I have to get to an event for your birthday.\"\n\n\nBradley shook his head.\n\n\n\"Chuck E.

Do I need shoes?\"\n\n\"You'll be fine.\"\n\nThe young man took a seat on the bench next to the boy and glanced at the screen in his hands.\n\n\"Oh sick, is that Fortnite?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the boy smiled. \"You play?\"\n\n\"I used to but not anymore. It's a cool game, though.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the boy smirked up at the old man, \"it is a good game.\"\n\nThis time the hatch opened into a kitchen where a well-dressed man was sitting drinking a cup of coffee. He raised the mug to the old man as he stepped out of the pod.\n\n\"I've been expecting you,\" the man smiled.\n\n\"The big three-oh,\" the old man said. \"Happy birthday, buddy. Let's go.\"\n\n30 took a seat next to 20 and 20 looked over at the man. \n\n\"Okay, I see it,\" 20 said, nodding his head. \"We're some kind of relatives. You look like you could be my cousin.\"\n\nThe old man looked over at 30 and the two of them burst into laughter.\n\n\"Don't talk while I'm gone,\" the old man said. \"I don't want to miss anything.\"\n\nThe hatch hissed open again and the old man emerged into a parking lot lightly dotted with cars. A 40-year-old man hustled past hauling a large shoulder bag.\n\n\"Happy birthday, Bradley,\" the old man yelled.\n\n\"No. No. I don't have time for this. Not today.\"\n\n\"Bradley,\" the old man sighed, \"it's a Saturday and it's your birthday. C'mon. It wouldn't be the same without you. Just half an hour.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" 40 said, \"I do have some things I might want to say this time.\"\n\nThe hatched hissed as is closed once again. The old man adjusted the control panel and 40 took the next seat on the bench. \n\nMoments later, the old man was standing in the open hatchway across from a 50-year-old Bradley wearing a tuxedo.\n\n\"Does it always have to be *on* my birthday?\" the man in the tuxedo asked, checking his watch.\n\n\"Happy birthday to you, too,\" the old man laughed.\n\n\"Look, I don't have more than-\" he checked his watch, again, \"thirty minutes.\"\n\n\"Twenty. Tops,\" the old man held his hands up in mock surrender.\n\n50 entered the pod, nodded at the others, and took a seat. The hatch reopened into a large, sunlit kitchen where 60 was waiting with a cup of coffee. When they arrived in that same kitchen moments later, the old man thought he had made a mistake. As he stepped back out into the kitchen a voice rang out from the other side of the room.\n\n\"I said I'm not doing it anymore,\" 70 snapped.\n\n\"Please,\" the old man pleaded, \"it won't be the same without us all there.\"\n\nWith a scowl and a reluctant shuffle, 70 made his way into the pod and took a seat next to 60.\n\nWhen they arrived at 80 he looked nearly as well dressed as 50. He wore a dark blue suit with pinstripes and carried a jeweled cane that he claimed was merely for aesthetics. He quietly took a seat next to 70. The old man fiddled with the controls some more. Once the humming stopped he silently turned and smiled at the group.\n\n\"Okay, look,\" 30 broke through the silence, \"I don't know how these things normally go. You may have noticed I didn't pay such good attention in the past.\" He gestured with his thumb at 20 and 10 to his right, fully engrossed in the game. \"I had no idea what was going on.\"\n\nFeeling everyone's eyes on him, 20 looked up from the screen of the Nintendo to meet their gaze and then to the old man.\n\n\"Me?\" he mouthed.\n\n\"Yes,\" the old man whispered with a smile.\n\n\"But I realize that you all are here to help me,\" 30 continued, \"so, I'd just like to hear what advice you have for a guy in his 30's.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure what the big guy has planned,\" 40 said, \"but I just want to let you know that company with Steve is a great idea.\"\n\n\"The tech firm? We were just talking about something like that last week,\" 30 shot up straight in his seat. 20 lost interest and went back to watching 10 play Fortnite. \"We actually get it started?\"\n\n40 and 50 both burst into laughter. \n\n\"Yeah, you do,\" 50 laughed. \"And you do quite well.\"\n\n\"It's hard work,\" 40 cut in.\n\n\"No doubt,\" 50 said, \"but worth it.\"\n\n\"That's great news,\" 30 said. \"I was talking to my buddies and we realized we're getting so old and we haven't really done anything-\"\n\n\"You're not old,\" 60 said, \"you've got a good, long life ahead of you\"\n\n\"Will you all shut up?\" 70 snapped. \"You guys always say all the same pointless shit! And the two who really need to hear it aren't even listening.\"\n\n\"Ok, boomer,\" 10 said.\n\n\"Got 'em!\" 20 shouted.\n\n\"See,\" 70 sighed, \"they're clueless.\"\n\n80 cleared his throat.\n\n\"To be honest,\" he said, \"I'm interested in hearing what the big man has to say.\" He smiled up at the old man and the eyes of all the other eight people in the pod were now on the old man.\n\n**PART 1 of 2**",

                    "comment": "**PART 2 of 2**\n\nSilence has a unique ability to alter how the passage of time is experienced. Noisy events seem to go by really quickly while a few seconds of silence at a dinner table is excruciatingly long. The silence in the pod at that moment was so absolute that the nine of them in the pod experienced those few seconds as an eternity.\n\n50 checked his watch.\n\n\"I just wanted to thank everyone for coming,\" the old man smiled. \"I'm glad I got to see you all, again.\"\n\n20's head followed the tilt of 10's until they were both looking down at the screen again.\n\n\"Bradley,\" the old man gestured to the younger version of himself wearing a tuxedo. \"I know you've got somewhere to be so I'll get you home first.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that.\" 50 stood and flattened his tux with his palms.\n\n\"Hey, have a good time tonight at the gaila,\" 60 called out as 50 stepped out the hatch.\n\n\"Easy enough,\" 50 replied. \"These are the good times. Wasn't it you that told me something about good times?\"\n\n\"Me? No,\" 60 said.\n\n\"Oh, yeah,\" 50 frowned, \"I remember. You said that both-\"\n\nThe hatch hissed as it closed the man in the tuxedo out of the pod.\n\n\"Now, Bradley,\" the old man said to the young boy. The boy replied with something like a grunt without looking up. \"I'm going to drop you off. Remember, we're gonna do this every ten years, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"What did I say?\"\n\n\"Every ten years.\"\n\n\"Okay. Bye, buddy.\"\n\nThe young boy shuffled out of the pod without looking up from the Nintendo Switch in his hands. The hatch hissed shut.\n\n\"I was just like him as a kid,\" 20 smiled.\n\n\"Were you always so stupid?\" 70 said. \"You still don't get what's happening here?\"\n\nThe door hissed open to 20's bedroom and he rose to his feet. \n\n\"Hold up.\" He stopped just outside the pod. \"Every ten years. And we're all about 10 years apart- Was that kid *me*?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And I'm all of you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Am I a clone?\"\n\n\"No,\" said 60. \"Clean your room.\"\n\nBefore 20 could say anything more, the doors closed and the pod began to hum.\n\n\"-That's the thing they don't teach ya about market segmentation,\" 40 said to 30. \"Don't worry about it, though. You'll do great.\"\n\n\"This was a really interesting chat,\" 30 said, standing up. \"Thank you so much.\"\n\nHe stepped back into his kitchen, the door shut behind him, and the pod hummed.\n\n\"So,\" 40 turned to 60, \"you've been kinda quiet. Got an pearls of wisdom you wanna pass down?\"\n\n\"Been thinking about one for a couple minutes now,\" 60 said. \"In both the good times and the bad, remember that this, too, shall pass.\"\n\n40's eyes narrowed as the door of the pod opened to the parking lot. He forced a smile.\n\n\"Thanks, I'll try to keep that in mind.\"\n\nIn the time between dropping 40 off in the parking lot and arriving back at 60's kitchen, 60 began to cry. As he stepped into the morning light of his kitchen he turned to face the three older versions of himself. Tears were now pouring down his face.\n\n\"Please, don't get me next time,\" he pleaded. \"I don't want to do this again.\"\n\nThe door hissed shut. The pod hummed. When they arrived once again at that same kitchen, 70 rose and walked to the door.\n\n\"I told you I didn't want to be here,\" he scowled at the old man by the control panel. The old man just smiled.\n\nThe doors closed once more and 80 and 90 were alone in the pod.\n\n\"He sure is a crotchety old man, huh?\" 80 quipped.\n\n\"He's just going through hard times,\" the old man replied. \"Give him ten years and he'll be a great man.\n\n\"Thanks,\" 80 smiled. \"I noticed something today, sitting in this cabin, again. There's no 100. Which kinda makes me think you won't live to 100. How much longer you think you got?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" the old man shrugged, \"could be nine years or 9 minutes. I know one thing for sure, though: I won't be at the next one. It was worth it, though.\"\n\n\"What was?\"\n\n\"Everything. It was all worth everything,\" the old man said.\n\nThe pod opened to a forest clearing with a small cabin on it.\n\n\"This isn't where I get out,\" 80 protested.\n\n\"No, this is where I get out,\" the old man said. \"I'm leaving the pod to you. I want you to see how everything was worth it. Maybe then you'll stop worrying about it. The happiness was worth the suffering. The relaxation was worth the work. Being 80 is worth being 70. There is a manual on how to use the machine under the center cushion. You can go to any place at any time. Just be careful. You don't want to do cause major disruptions.\"\n\n\"Well where did you go?\"\n\n\"I think it's best you figure that out on your own,\" the old man said. \"And be sure to get everyone together again in ten years. It'll be worth it.\"\n\n\"I kind of want to use it to see your future,\" 80 said. \"I'm curious to see how you end up.\"\n\n\"Me, too.\" The old man smiled. \"Me too.\"",

            "comment": "NOTE: This is the first time I've done anything like this at all! Any feedback appreciated. Hope it isn't too long. I might continue it in a bit, not sure yet! \n\nThey're shouting again. Well, someone was shouting, and someone was crying. That's what woke me up. I'd hoped that tomorrow being my 10th birthday, they'd be nicer to each other. Nicer to me. The bruises on my ribs started to twang as I realise I'm also crying. Need to be quiet, don't want to be annoying. My ribs were a reminder as to what happened when I was annoying.\n\nThe shouting downstairs had stopped, but the crying  was louder. \"WAKE UP\" Over and over, getting more frantic and hysterical with each wail. How anyone could sleep with that much noise I don't understand. I squeezed my eyes tight, all I want is for the crying to stop.  All I'd ever wanted was for the crying to stop, and suddenly it did.\n\nMy covers were gone, and the mattress felt instantly cold and hard through my pyjamas. I didn't realise how loud I'd been crying, until the noise had gone. Not gone, it wasn't silent. Someone was singing, or trying to, at least. That stopped abruptly too. It took a minute but I steadied myself, and worked up the courage to open my eyes. I found myself laying on the floor in a square room occupied by several other people.  As I sat up, slowly, I realised there was an old man next to me. Looking at him reminded me of grandad somehow. He gave me a warm smile as I caught his eye, and the first thing he said was \"Don't worry, it gets better. Eventually.\" \n\n\n*blink*\n\nThe music was loud. My neighbours had knocked and told me to turn it down or they'd phone the police. I'd told them to fuck off! That had got big approval from my friends, even if I did feel bad for saying it. I blame whatever was in those pills Josh had given me. \n\n\nBesides, it was the night before my 20th birthday, they can't expect me to celebrate in silence! Tonight was gonna be the best night of my life! That wasn't particularly hard, given I'd grown up in care after waking up on my 10th birthday to find out my mum had killed my dad in self defence, and then killed herself in custody just a few weeks later. My thoughts wandered to the dream I'd had that night. \"Things will get better. Eventually.\" Eventually had come pretty quickly. Going into care was the best thing that had happened to me. Yeah I'd been moved around a bit to different homes, but the bruises had stopped too. Care was also the reason I had this flat to myself! Well, to me and a few friends who had decided to move in, not that the council knew that.\n\n\nIn the kitchen getting a drink, I find Josh and Zach, two of the friends who'd moved in, injecting themselves. That was something I hadn't known until after moving. I was a bit worried when I'd first found out, but these guys like me! They're nice to me, and so, what harm can a needle every now and then do, right? They'd tried to get me to do it a few times, and I'd said no, which made them laugh and joke that I'm boring! At least, I think they're joking. \n\n\nThey both just sat down on the kitchen floor when they were done, so I went back out to the music. The atmosphere in here isn't what I wanted it to be, no-ones seems to be having a good time, everyone is mainly just sat in groups or alone, not really saying anything. Well, its my party, so I'll have a good time on my own! \n\n\nHow longs it been? It must be nearly midnight! God my throat is sore. As I break into the next verse, the music stops abrubtly. I look around to see who turned it off, I realise I'm not in my house anymore. I'm in a square room, each wall a different colour. Why do the colours look like they're popping out at me? This place feels strangely familiar, like something from a dream I'd had years ago. That's when I notice the people. 8 other people, and one of them a kid! He's wearing my favourite pair of pyjamas from when I was younger. What was in those fucking pills? \n\n*blink* \n\n\"Don't worry, it get's better. Eventually\" Those words had taunted me the last 10 years. Remembered from a dream I'd had as a kid, the memory had prompted the most insane trip of my life on my 20th birthday. Looking back, I suppose things had got better for a time, but what the dream hadn't told me was that they'd get worse again. A lot worse. It was cold tonight. Every night was cold, but tonight even more so. The newspaper I'd found earlier told me it might even snow. Great. It had also told me that tomorrow was my birthday. Ha. Happy birthday to me.\n\n\n At least tonight I wouldn't dream, or hallucinate. Sleep was never deep enough for dreaming on the streets, and I've been sober for about a year. True, that was mainly due to having no money for drugs, but I'd also promised myself not to touch the stuff either. Maybe a bit was due to those meetings at the church hall too. It was nice to be able to go somewhere and talk. Not that I do much. I mainly started going just for the hot meals, and the talking came afterwards. \n\n\nLooking down the street I see two police. Time to move I guess. I pick up my things, not that there's much to take, and as I stand up, suddenly I'm in a square room with colourful walls. And its warm! Thank god its warm. Looking around, I recognise where I am from an old dream and a hallucination. Maybe I'm just crazy. The room is filled with 8 other people. I see a kid, laying on the ground next to a grey haired man, who has kind eyes and a warm smile. He seems to be settling the kid back down for sleep. \n\n\nI catch eyes with a man opposite, and he looks as shocked as I feel. I'd say astonishment painted his face more than shock, thinking about it. He also looks like me, if a bit older, but clean shaven and well dressed. He wanders over to a man sat in a chair with gaunt cheeks, surveying the room with his eyes and starts what looks like an onslaught of questions. \n\n\nOne of the oldest men in the room starts over to me, and before he says anything wraps his arms around me in an embrace. After a few moments he says \"I'm sorry. Eventually is almost here for you, I promise.\" He pulls away and chuckles to himself. \"You know, I remember what it was I'd said to you just then differently, but now I've said it, it seems the memory from when I was you is copied, but with the new words. Strange\"\n\n*blink*",

                    "comment": "*PART 2 OF X* \n\n\n40 tomorrow. What an age! Especially for me. To think that just 10 years ago, I had no home. Eventually really had come quickly. Someone at the church put me in touch with a charity that helped to rehabilitate and get people off the streets. Thats what I did now, too. Worked at bringing other people's Eventually's, sooner.\n\n\n Thats where I'd met my wife, Robin. My wife! My wonderfully brilliant wife. Shes asleep upstairs. I haven't told her anything about The Meeting. That's what I'd decided to call it, because thats what it was, just one meeting. With myself through the decades. I'm still not convinced it's even real, but after tonight I'll know. \n\n\nI'd just shaved and put on my best suit. I want to make a good impression. If it happens. It's funny, I only bought this suit because I'd seen myself wearing it 10 years ago. Otherwise I don't think I'd have even considered it! I feel nervous. Why do I feel nervous? I'm only meeting myself. If I'm not being silly, that is. 11:59. One minute to go. Pop a mint to calm my nerves, and suddenly I'm in a square room with walls of different colours. \n\n\nThere's 8 other people here. No. Not 8 other people. Just one person. Me, but 9 different versions. It's real! And it took me 40 years to figure it out. But now I know, then surely I just tell 10 year old me? I could change my life! Well, some of it, anyway. If I could, then why hadn't I tried before? Maybe I had! A quick glance around showed a terrified 10 year old me being comforted by.. by who? 60? 70? Another glance brings me to look at 20. \n\n\nLooking at 20 terrified me, reliving the years between 20 and 30 weren't something I wanted to do anytime soon, and yet, that's what 20 was about to do, but, for the first time for him I suppose; or was it technically the 4th? The 9th? He had sauntered over to one of the walls and began stroking it. No wonder it had taken so long to figure it out. 10 was terrified and put to sleep almost immediately, and 20 was high and now just laid down to stare at the ceiling.\n\n\n I locked eyes briefly with 30. Wow. Did it get that bad? 30 was as skinny and pale as a piece of straw in bleach. Eyes and cheeks sunken in with a sad, defeated look in his eye and a greasy unbrushed beard on his chin. One of the older Me's, 80 I'd guess, walked over to him and hugged him. I remember that conversation. Even if immediately after I left this place I'd started to doubt my sanity, that conversation stayed with me over the ten years. I remembered all the questions I had and dashed over to the oldest man in the room. Didn't this happen sooner last time? \n\n\n90 was a gaunt old man, and as soon as I was within 3 feet my mouth just started working automatically. \"Where is this place? Are you really me? Can we change things? Can we come more often?\"\n\n\n90 looked at me consideringly \"I really did have a lot of energy, didn't I? And excitement too it seems. I had that in spades. I am you. In this room, things can happen slightly differently each Meeting, but I do not think we can change things outside. In a moment, 50 and 60 will walk over to 20, and try to get him to change certain choices we made, to no avail. We come when we come, and no more.\" He said that last with a wry grin on his face. \"I know that once The Meeting is over, I will remain here. I am unsure for what purpose.\" \n\n*blink*",

            "comment": "*What's your secret, little rock?* Bill pondered to himself, sitting on the cliffside. The Grand Canyon was beautiful this night. The mesa stretching to the jagged horizon, the distinct shape of its walls... what carved them? What was their story?\n\nHe picked up the rock on his right, wished it a more interesting decade, and let it bounce down.\n\n\"What's up, honey?\" asked a voice behind him.\n\n\"Nothing, Vic. Just... y'know.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Well, good luck, and don't fall down when it happens.\"\n\nShe hugged him from behind and kissed him goodbye. Bill smiled. She was right, he was due in ten minutes, it wouldn't be wise to sit on the edge by then. He walked back and lay down, then looked to the stars.\n\nMillions and millions of different little dots in the sky. Like the possible life paths he once imagined... but, as this decade proved, he was stuck in just one. A thought comforting and claustrophobic at once. He tried to make it different this time, make it better, but the stars were unyielding. And Fours was always so bummed...\n\nHe reached for a photo by his side, but the stars vanished. So did the picture.\n\nBill stood up and looked around. The others have arrived too -- himself, all of them, at different ages. He smiled at his ten year old self, naive and hopeful, amazed by the cursed room. Twos was here too, looking so determined, Fours and Fives bummed as usual, the elders sitting at the table already, and Threes...\n\nOh, right. He was Threes this time. His given name for his thirty year old self.\n\nHe sat down, feeling as though he was watching himself from the outside. Of all selves, Threes was the one he focused on the most last time, he remembered every move he was about to make. He felt tugged along on rails, yet every twitch of his body was his own intent somehow.\n\nHow? How could the cursed room do that?\n\nHe sat in silence, watching the elders start the meeting as usual, focusing on Fours. He was so depressed... he had to ask why, what went wrong in the next decade. His gut jolted as he realized it was _his_ next decade. He was going to be Fours the next time.\n\nTo hell with all that.\n\nHe waved to the room, forcing himself to move contrary to how he remembered. And it _worked_. He could move off the rails.\n\nFours gave him a passing glance, then looked down again. Did he change something? He had no idea. It didn't seem as though anything major happened. Then, Twos looked at him, and he remembered. He did wave the last time.\n\nBut... how? He distinctly remembered Threes never moved, but now he questioned himself. The memory was there, but at the same time he had another now.\n\nWas _this_ the way? How far could he push it?\n\nHis life, his first thirty years flashed before his eyes. He didn't have many regrets, his path so far was not glamorous but not terrible either, and there wasn't a life choice he ever chickened out of. Seeing his destiny for the third time now gave him a weird confidence. It was all going to work out anyway, so why shy away from anything?\n\nBut, digging in his memories, he remembered the worst day of his life. Three years ago, Buttercup, his wife's dog was hit by a car and passed away. The memory of her crying over the Newfie's lifeless body still made his heart ache.\n\n\"Hey, you okay?\" asked Twos.\n\n\"Yeah... thanks, I'm good,\" he said as he was supposed to. \"Wait, no! Listen...\"\n\nTwos glanced worriedly at the council, then leaned closer.\n\n\"May 2nd, 2010. Buttercup is gonna be hit by a car. Just... keep her home, will you?\"\n\nA shriek echoed across the room.\n\nBill looked up, alarmed. All the other Bills around him did the same, and Sevens rushed to help an elder. Nines was in pain, holding his heart. This was _definitely_ not planned. Oddly, Fours was the only one not to get up, he just sighed.\n\n\"WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE?\" roared Eights, looking around the room, then fixating on Bill. \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?\"\n\n\"Um...\"\n\n\"Leave him alone!\" said Twos.\n\n\"Shut up, kiddo!\"\n\n\"Aaargh...\" sounded Nines and his voice trembled so weakly it made Bill afraid for the first time ever in the cursed room.\n\n\"CUT IT!\" said Sevens. \"CUT IT, NOW!\"\n\nIn a blink, the room disappeared. Bill lay on the rock again, stars filling in his view once more.\n\nHis face was wet.\n\nHe sat up, confused, but he didn't have much time to think before a giant ball of fur smashed into him.\n\n\"Hey, Buttercup! You're alive! YOU'RE ALIVE!\"\n\nHe hugged his dog, euphoric. He did it! He changed time, save his dog... he jumped up and ran towards the tent to wake his wife.\n\nEmpty.\n\n\"Hey? Honey? Victoria?\"\n\nAs he stood up and looked around the Canyon -- Buttercup nearly knocking him off his leg -- a sinking sensation fell in. He remembered every last memory with his loving wife, but now there were new ones...\n\nHe walked back to the photo, horrified for what it may hold. It was no longer his last photo of Buttercup. Instead, it showed his wife, just before... before the accident...\n\nHe looked to the stars, eyes tearing up, but there was no use. They were closed for another decade.",

            "comment": "Ten years is a lot longer than most people think, long enough that many individual memories escape oneself. And so it was that #50 might only remember impressions from when he was #10. You remember the meeting, what was discussed, decisions you collectively made - but the exact details are simply lost to time.\n\nNo minutes are kept, as we all agreed... at some point (it's hard to say how long this has been going on, being effectively a closed loop - it's always happening, has always happened, yet happens a finite number of times - trust me it's a pain in the ass to wrap your head around)... to not keep any documents, lest our abilities are discovered. Which could be inconvenient.\n\nNow you might ask: *how would you get caught? It's already happened!*\n\nWell, you see, time and space are very easily influenced. One might say wibbly wobbly, but I (we) prefer 'Bendy'. Time is much like a lump of rock, blasting through space at cosmic velocities. It will continue unimpeded until the end of time. Unless of course it doesn't. Thats the thing about models and closed systems, they can only reflect what has been seen before.\n\nEveryone arrives in the same order every time, given it's the same event. It's more appropriate to say everyone arrived in a specific order when it happened I suppose. I arrive as close to the middle of the group as possible, which is impossible to nail, given the entropic decay of the universe and it's knock-on effects. Tends to throw a \u00b15 minute variance to any given target, which in the grand scheme of things isn't the end of the world - but it can be a harsh reminder to not rely on our ability to time things perfectly. It's best to arrive early and prepare.\n\n10 arrives last, escorted by 50 who fetched him for his first meeting. I took my place at the head of the table, which immediately drew glances from 40 and up. They didn't say anything, I knew they wouldn't. There is an implicit trust amongst us, given we are all... well you get the point. Nonetheless, I could see the concern on their face. They were worried, as they should be. \n\nWhen everyone was seated, 90 rose from his chair. He held himself firmly, exuding confidence and strength. He had to give his past selves confidence in their futures. He addressed the group on the most dignified voice he could muster.\n\n\"I welcome you to the Decennial Meeting of the Matthews. Most of you know me, but 10 I welcome you to the table. Today is your first time, and you have only just learned of an amazing ability that will shape your life and those around you for a lifetime to come. The purpose of this meeting, as was established in the beginning of the folded loop, is to ensure we are living our lives the best we can and to learn from one another. By learning from those who come after you, you start out on a higher rung, and thus those who come after you achieve new heights from which to teach you once more. A closed loop reaction. An infinitely swelling pool of knowledge suspended in time and space.\" he finished with a nod to each of his previous lives. His eyes rested on me finally, his face set in stone.\n\n\"And who, might we ask, are you?\"\n\nThe room turned to look at me.\n\n\"I'm impossible.\" I replied.\n\nThere were a few nods of agreement from the older crowd. I had never existed in their previous meetings.\n\n\"And how old are you?\" 90 asked.\n\n\"1,270,250.\" I replied, savoring it just a bit. I had waited a long time for this moment.\n\nThere were a few gasps, but more furrowed brows.\n\n\"Surely you are joking, I'm the oldest one to arrive!\" 90 stated, looking to the others for support.\n\n\"Indeed, you are the last one to show up. We agreed, after 90, to stop coming to meetings. We had already broken things too much.\"\n\n\"Broken things?\" 50 asked.\n\n\"In a sense, yes. Our closed loop grew so dense with information it collapsed-\" \n\n90 sat down with a thump, his body limp. 50 and 60 rushed to his side.\n\n\"...it collapsed into a singularity. I spent a few hundred thousand years in the singularity, one moment stretched across an infinite amount of time, until the singularity bled off enough energy to itself collapse - spitting me out like some undigestible morsel. I surely would have died had I not maintained a static bubble of time around myself.\" now that I was saying it out loud, I realized it could be a lot to take in.\n\n\"So it worked?\" 30 asked.\n\n\"Too well, indeed.\" I replied, \"here's the thing. Your singularity has already collapsed, it's always been collapsed - from the very first meeting. You might stop now and think. Can you remember anything in between these meetings?\"\n\nThey looked at one another, a few of the elders faces twisted with realization.\n\n\"This pocket universe we've used to meet in, is all that remains. There is no universe outside, the density of information contained collapsed it into the singularity, inexplicably wrapped in yet another universe - where I am likely right now in my past.\"\n\n\"How can this be though?\" 60 asked, lines of fear creased his brow where sweat beaded.\n\n\"We were arrogant to assume we could close a loop and expect nothing to happen. We created an infinite feedback loop within a pocket universe. I mean come on, how much clearer do I have to make this. No offense, 10, this is your first time after all and it wasn't even your idea.\" \n\nI was growing frustrated with their lack of understanding. To me it was clear, we were too successful and pure information encompassed the universe and spat me out adjacent. But they would see, every single one of them would eventually be here.\n\n\"I'm sorry for what I must do.\" I said finally. I had to make my move, for the sake of the universe we once knew.\n\nSure, another universe follows. One thats even inhabitable, with people, and wonders, and aliens, and a future. But at the cost of all that this one is. I had to set it right, and I had waited an eternity to do so. I had to prevent the collapse, and the only way to do so would be to break the loop.\n\nI rose from my chair, and willed the others into a single moment separated from this one. Only 10 and myself remained.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" 10 asked me, his terror stricken face burned my eyes. I rested a palm on his shoulder.\n\n\"I know this is a bit hard to understand. For you, time and life, it has all just begun. But I've seen the universe itself fold for us and remove itself from existence. What comes after is not worth it. You have to trust me, you will wake up on the other end.\" I gave him a quick jolt backwards and he floated slowly backwards into the air, turning to shimmering dust and drifting away.\n\nHe wasn't dead, but he wasn't here. He would never participate in the meeting, in any iteration of the loop. The loop would collapse without him and the knowledge of his ability he gained. He would be forever removed from his older or younger selves, only knowing himself in his present. He will still travel time, of course, I can't remove his ability. But this abomination would be destroyed.\n\nNow what would come for me? I'm not of this loop. My loop was broken, fractured into an infinite ray. There was no end to my existence, but at least I did not suffer.\n\nThe pocket universe crumbled around me, turning to dust and drifting on an ethereal nonexistent wind.\n\nIt faded and I was left in nothingness once more. The loop was collapsed, and I had taken the place of 90 in the singularity this time and only the pocket universe had been consumed in its self destruction. How and to what I would emerge once it had bled off its energy, I could not know.\n\nI'll sleep for now. And when I wake, we'll see what has become of the universe.",

We can't have a meeting without everyone. Stop rushing things!\" says 80. He gets a little grumpy when anyone pushes things along too fast.\n\n\"We can start without 90, he's always a little slow, you know that. He can catch up when he gets here. Besides, we don't really need another round of 'back in my day..'\" says 10. He and 90 don't like each other very much.\n\n\"So we can set ourselves up with a round 'Back in my day people were polite to each other, and wouldn't run a meeting without everyone there'? No thanks, lets give him 5 more minutes. Maybe that cane of his got stuck in a pothole.\" says 20, laughing a little at the last.\n\n80 looks a little irritated at the mention of the dreaded cane. Someday that will be him, he knows it, we all know it. Someday that will be all of us. But only 80 is facing it sometime in the next decade. Even 70 refuses to take it seriously. He says he's fine, so what ever 80 does to earn a cane for 90, it's not his fault. Ever since he discovered viagra, 70 has been in a \"new place in life\", and he and 20 have weirdly become \"bros\".\n\n30 pipes in with some \"Lets give it a while, we need to be more considerate. You all give him grief, every time, but he's the last of us, we need him. We need his wisdom, his hindsight. How many times has the things he said made us change our mind about something, for the better?\"\n\n\"Not as often as you think\" grumbles 40. \"He's the one pushing for me to stick it out with Jessie, 'just make it to 50, you'll be so happy'. Maybe I don't think I want to spend another ten years with someone who spends all my money, and gives all her attention to the kids. I have needs, too, you know. But that old bastard doesn't care anymore, he can't see them from 5 decades away.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's that you need long term happiness, more than you need sex, and it's you that can't see that, from decades away,\" says 60, eyebrow raised, and doing his best impersonation of our father. 10, 20 and 30 all roll their eyes.\n\n\"Well, it's been 5 minutes, and he still isn't here. I say we bring this meeting to order. 10, why don't you start us off with how your doing? School ok? Hows Mom and Dad?\"\n\n\"They're fine. School is fine. I got a new bike! It's red and has racing stripes, and cool handle bars! My friends and I made a ramp out of some wood we had in the shed and I jumped off it on the bike going so fast!\" he answers breathlessly, rushing to get it all said. He looks around, knowing that he's going to be cut off any second, but 90 isn't here so he continues. \"Jimmy was going to go away for the summer to camp, and i was gonna miss him, but then his dad got into a fight with him mom and his dad went away and now Jimmy is gonna be home all summer, it's so awesome! We're gonna sleep in the yard, and build a fort, and go fishing!\"\n\nThey all smile indulgently at his plans, but 40 says \"You might want to be a little more careful of your friend's feelings. You see it as your friend staying home all summer, to hang out with you. But Jimmy's dad is gone. How would you feel if our dad was gone? I bet it hurts him, I bet he's scared. Try to be a better friend to him, and not just see that it's all about having fun.\" 40 is always full of fatherly advice for 10.\n\nThey all know he won't. They all still miss Jimmy's friendship. Everyone other than 10 remembers the fight he will soon have with his best friend.\n\n20 speaks up, \"I am having an awesome time in college. So many girls, so many parties. Classes are a breeze, don't even have to show up for most of them, I'm still acing them. Thinking about changing my major to law, it just seems nicely rigid, and yet fluid at the same time\" 20 always talks about changing his major. Something new each time. At least he's over the urge to go for Art History.\n\n\"You're going business major. No argument. It's how we made our money, and it's how you will make your money, too.\" 60 lays down the law. He gets tired of this same conversation each time.\n\n\"So, umm, anyone notice 90 still isn't here?\" 80 seems to be a little nervous.\n\n\"Ok, honestly, that's not like him. It's a little weird.\" says 40, 60 and 70 at the same time.\n\n30 shrugs and makes his report.  \"It is what it is. It's not like we can call him up or facetime him. So... Jessie and I got married! We're thinking of starting a family. We were thinking 3 kids, hopefully at least 1 of each. But even if they're all boys or all girls, this is going to be amazing. Jessie is going to be a great mother. I can't wait to see her with our babies! Work is going great! Got a promotion at the firm! I'll be full partner at the firm by the time I'm 35, I just know it!\"\n\n40 sighs, \"I know you don't want to hear about it yet again, but I am not happy. I can't complain about the kids, they are wonderful, truly everything I knew they would be, so smart, so sweet, so... wait. What did you just say 30? What firm?\"\n\n\"The law firm. Prescott, Prescott, and Hughes. I've been there 2 years now.\"\n\n\"20!! You changed your major?! We talked about this!! We are a business man!! How could you do this?!\" The accusations fly from all but 10, who really just wants to be a stuntman.\n\n\"So we are a lawyer now? When did that happen? I still feel like a business man.\" says 60, a bit confused by the conversation.\n\nSomething catches 70's notice. \"Hey! There are only 8 chairs around the table. Where is the chair for 90?\"\n\nA pause, then 50 says \"I guess he never was going to be at this meeting.\" He looks all the others slowly, then \"80, what the hell did you do?!\"\n\n80 yells defensively \" It wasn't me! 20 changed our life! He became a lawyer! And now 90 is gone!\"\n\n10 looks scared and sad, the uncertainty of what was a certain future shaking his young soul. All the rest seem to come to the conclusion at the same time that they could change their future at any time. What has always been taken by them as fate, has become something they can control.\n\n\"OK. I'll change my major to something less stressful. How do we feel about politics?\" says 20.",

            "comment": "The door creaks open, an eerie sound echoes around a dimly lit room as I peak my head through the door. It\u2019s empty, except for a mess of various chairs strewn into a haphazard circle. As I start walking towards them my body sends me into a jumping skip, as it often likes to do, and I skid into the circle twirling around to see where I should park my rear. The plastic foldable chair closest to the door I entered looks exactly like the chairs at church and I\u2019m immediately drawn to the familiarity. I sit down and kick my feet around, scratching my nails in repetition on the bumps in the grooves, looking around wondering what this place is and why I am here.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a loud bang, and I snap around to see what it is. There\u2019s an adult with his right foot still in the air, the door he just kicked is swinging back violently towards him and he holds out his left hand nonchalantly pausing it\u2019s swing as he saunters in. He\u2019s loud. His voice is projecting as he walks towards me, I can\u2019t understand exactly what he\u2019s saying, but he reminds me of my brother and I start feeling uneasy. For some reason he has water in a glass bottle, and he takes a drink from it every couple of sentences. He must really be dehydrated.\n\n\nHe sits down on some cinder block that looks oddly like a wall, and starts kicking his feet, scratching his fingernails on the grooves of the cement in a pattern I know.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026 who are you?\u201d, I manage to shyly ask.\n\nHe looks at me with sly eyes, and his face twists into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m you\u201d, he says deviously. \u201cI\u2019m the you that made it, but not all of us did. This is us at 20, but don\u2019t worry we probably are the only two showing up.\u201d\n\n\nI don\u2019t understand what he means, but he seems maybe not so bad. \u201cHave you heard of Star Wars?\u201d, I ask. \u201cIt\u2019s this really cool movie where they\u2019re in space and the main character has to fight against..\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah I know all about that. You still have your head up your ass, no idea what\u2019s going on huh?\u201d He scoffs at me.\n\n\nThe smile twists further into a sneer. He stands up to walk towards me, but freezes in place as a \u201cAhem\u201d comes from off to the side.\n\n\nThere\u2019s an older adult there, and he looks almost exactly like me and 20, but he\u2019s softer than 20. His eyes are less devious, but somehow they scare me a little more. 20 is scared, a look of disbelief and terror is etched on his face.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?!\u201d, he yells. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to be here, we weren\u2019t supposed to make it to 30!\u201d\n\n\n30 smiles, and there\u2019s less of a twist to it. \u201cYeah I know, kid. You gave it your all believe you me, but it just didn\u2019t quite work. We kept surviving somehow. Don\u2019t ask me how, I don\u2019t know. It was a wild ride though.\u201d\n\n\n20 starts becoming more and more agitated, his voice growing louder and louder until I start feeling like I\u2019m at home. I never like being around the screaming, and my room is nowhere near here so I get up to run out. I get about halfway to the door when I hear someone call, \u201cHey kid, wait a second.\u201d\n\n\nI turn around and 30 is slowly jogging towards me. He kneels down in front of me and there\u2019s a soft twinkle in his eyes. He takes my hand softly in his and very quietly says, \u201cI just wanted to say goodbye before you left. You\u2019re such a strong little dude, and I was hoping to spend more time with you, but I understand if you want to go.\u201d He leans in and gives me a hug. The feeling in itself is forgein, but there\u2019s a warmth to it that is a complete new thing. He rocks back onto his heels and looks me in the eyes with a sort of earnestness. \u201cYou need to know, it\u2019s not your fault and it\u2019s okay to say no. Can you repeat that back to me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault and it\u2019s okay to say no.\u201d, I say, but at this point I am so confused that I can\u2019t really make sense of what that means at all. He stands up and ruffles the top of my head, \u201cTake it easy little dude. I\u2019m glad I got to see you one last time.\u201d\n\n\nAs he turns around I dart out the door, glad to leave such a weird scene behind me.",

He looked at me and smiled, I could see him struggle to give me some candy, which I quickly ate. The door opened a tired student walked in while holding a walking stick made of metal, much shinier than the one 90 held. A man in a suit came next, talking to another man who showed him photos in his wallet. Two equally tired looking guys arrived last and took their seats.\n\n20 was about to say something when 40 and 50 started to talk about someone named Ella.

He asked me. \u201cDo you want to see photos of my grandchildren?\u201d I nodded and sat beside him as he showed me pictures of 3 people wearing robes and square hats. \u201cI suppose you should be going now, huh Mikey?\u201d He asked again. I nodded and said to him. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya soon! Bye!\u201d I ran out the door.",

There\u2019s a seat assigned for you that says today\u2019s date: May 28, 2020. You gently sit down right there (obviously). Next to you, you see the words scribed: May 28, 2010... which is interesting. You\u2019re not exactly sure what it means. \n\nBefore you catch a breath, you squint your eyes and peak to your right, careful, like a kitten trying not to be seen to a dog but you notice your own profile next to you. You want not to be rude and stare, but you\u2019re compelled. And you look for a second and just barely catch yourself from muttering the words, \u2018excuse me, miss\u2019. \n\nThen it hits you. That IS you, yet somehow different. More poised, proper, grown. There is a different air about the person you recognize, the waft of the perfume you don\u2019t recognize and the lucidity that hung around you like butterflies. \n\nAnd you see a young girl, awkward in her own way, passionate and bubbly, approach the seat to the left to you and sit there humming and swaying with blonde braids to her shoulders.  And beyond that a certificate on a white chair, embroidered in gold with the date May 28, 2000. \n\nAll around you are faces you can detect, but virtually do not recognize. Only some sparse features stick out to you, like the dimpled lower jawline as you bite on the inside of your cheek, and the freckle flicked randomly in the center of your face.

I don\u2019t know what to say, nor do I want to open my mouth. I am extremely nervous. I gently make small talk with the younger girl to my left. \n\n\u2018So... have you ever been here before?\u2019\n\nShe shakes her head no and starts to babble on and on. And you wonder how somebody could talk so much and so fast. But suddenly something triggers you... the little girl notices something in the distance, a shiny necklace dangling from a neck onto the neckline of her shirt. Suddenly, her eye is scanned through every woman wearing the same necklace, scintillating with ease and sheer beauty. \n\nIt hits you. You remember this meeting, feeling awkward, trusting a new face, how you envied that necklace, lusting for it until you graduated high school and was lucky enough to be gifted it passed down from your grandmother, to your father, to you, you remember this meeting... how the gavel will be struck in 3, 2, 1\n\nSomeone steps up to the only source of color in the room, a brown, oak wood podium with a gavel.

A whim from a stupid dream as a kid? But then it happens, just from the corner of my eye at first, my old bed fades into assistance just beside me.\n\nBut maybe I faded in? Its a blank white room now after all, I missed when that changed, but here I am, computer desk and all, and with just a moment to check theres the bright glowing 20 above my head. Its funny how I struggle to remember so much, yet this dream stuck in my head all this time.\n\n30 Doesn't seem to like me, she looks over for just a moment, fading in from some park bench, before turning to deal with the others. I suppose I don't like me much either though. I spend too much time doing nothing but wishing I was making progress, and she's the one that has to suffer for it.\n\nThats fine though, its 10 I'm here for. 90 got to talk with him first last time, but she meets my eyes and nods slowly from her chair, taunting me to break the cycle. We stay like that for far too long, if such a thing is possible without time, but eventually she simply starts to talk with 80 and I make my move.\n\nTheres no point in trying to explain whats happening. 90 does that anyway and he never listened to the advice. I wasn't ready to accept my mistakes yet, I still don't know if I accept that I'm making them now.\n\nBut its nice to talk with him all the same, all the little things he doesn't know matter. How his drama teacher won't let him play the girl roles like in Greece. How his mum keeps stopping him from reading those fairy books. A million complaints about how lifes unfair and hes done nothing wrong.\n\nI awake in the morning having listened to my own complaints for years. 30 was right to be upset with me, and if I want to be like her, I need to get to work.",

Not saying a word. Glancing around the room looking for 90. It has been 10 years since the last reunion and some of the older versions of me were starting to look worried.    \n   \nYou see, ever since I was 10 years old, on the eve of my birthday, a door would appear at the foot of my bed with a sign that reads \"Only you may enter.\"   \n   \nLike clockwork. Year after year. I remember as far back as the first time I stepped through the door. A bunch of older versions of myself. The weird part is that I remember seeing myself walk through that door for the first time, and each time after that.    \n    \nTonight is my 50th birthday and I am quite excited to talk to 40 and 30 and reminisce about the time 20 freaked out his second time through the door. Even though we all remember it, that specific time was memorable to 30 and myself.     \n    \nThat was when 20 was a huge pot head. I remember smoking a bunch of pot with my then girlfriend and falling asleep on the couch. Waking up to the sound of chatter and seeing the door for the second time. Theres no way this is a dream.    \n    \nI walked through the door and saw 30 and 40 laughing hysterically just like I remembered from when I was 10, just quietly sitting in the corner, watching 20 walk through for the second time.   \n   \nHe though he was dreaming. He could comprehend the fact that every year on our, well my birthday, the door would appear for all of us to gather and figure out whats going on with 90.  \n   \nEvery year this happens though. 50, 30, and 40 all laughing as 20 walks through the door, 10 sitting in the corner, 60, 70, and 80 just glancing around the room. \n    \nIt has been the same thing, every 10 years now.    \n    \nBut tonight was an odd visit. 80 asked if any one has ever seen 90. This has never occurred before. I dont remember 80 ever asking any questions in any of my previous visits. You would think that I would know this, since this is my 5th time walking through the door.   \n    \n60 turned to 70 and muttered under his breath in a worrying tone that I have never heard. You would think that I would have heard something, since this is my 5th time walking through the door.    \n    \nAs heads started to turn and more questions about whether or not any one has ever seen 90 walk through the doorway, or as 30 joking said, \"hobbled\" through the door way, but we were all confused as we have never seen him.   \n    \nI understand now why 80 is always glancing around the room. Why 70 glances at 80, and why 60 mutters under his breath every time.   \n    \nNo one has ever seen 90.    \n    \n80 has always has a shifty eye persona to him. I always though it was because of his old age, but now that he spoke for the first time, even though I should have remembered this, it made it more and more clear to me.   \n    \nDo I live to be 90 years old?   \n    \nI thought about it for a second, when all of a sudden there was a huge shriek from 10!  \n  \nWhere did he get a gun? Why is it loaded, and why is he pointing at me! I didnt do anything! If he kills me, 60, 70, and 80 will never have existed. Watching myself at 50 laugh with 40 and 30 all those times would have never happened.   \n    \nThis had never happened in any of the times the door showed it self. How could this be happening now? Just then there was a knock on the door that we all came through. It was locked but the knock kept getting louder and louder.   \n   \nA sign appeared on the door that read \"Only one may enter.\"",

            "comment": "I remember that fateful day as if it was yesterday. 35 years ago on my tenth birthday, my mother received a black envelope in the postbox. Immediately after reading the message inside, she quickly gave me one of the spare party bags, some party food and a slice of cake. \"Some very special people are going to take you to a meeting.\" she calmly told me. It was only a few minutes until a long dark blue car pulled up into the driveway my parents waved goodbye as two businessmen took me into the car. After a long car ride. The pair of men took me to the largest room I had ever been to in my lifetime. \"To your seat.\" one of the men pointed at a chair with \"10\" written in front of it. The meeting started, I don't remember much as it was a boring meeting but one part stood out to me. \"Remember a few years after your ninth meeting you get a little surprise!\" I wanted to know more about this so I asked about the surprise but I just got told that I don't wanna know. Soon the meeting was over and I was driven home and I just forgot about it for a couple of years until my twentieth birthday. As I was enjoying myself I heard whispers saying \"Come to the meeting, Skylar.\" over and over. I tried to ignore it but it got so loud it was all I could hear. Finally, everything went blank and I woke up back in the same meeting room except this time the number 20 was in front of my chair instead of the number 10. Everything played out the exact same as the last meeting, it felt off I looked at the nametags the two businessmen were wearing and they both said \"Worker at Time Meetings.\".  After the meeting, I looked up the company and all I saw were news stories about disappearances that the company was behind. I was horrified \"Is that the surprise? Is that gonna happen to me?\" all these questions in my mind I knew I had to escape before the surprise, no matter what I had to do. So for ten years, I was researching and training on how to escape these meetings before the surprise. Unfortunately, I was caught by the men \"Looks like you spoiled the surprise!\" one of the men spoke out of nowhere \"Guess we have to give you the surprise early!\" the other followed. The two men started chanting before I could ask what's going on. The room started spinning and eventually, everything went blank. \"Hey, wake up!\" Someone yelled. I woke up in a house with all the people reported missing because of Time Meetings. It's been years since the men sentenced me here. Everyone here is friendly but I just wish there was a way to get everyone out.",

            "comment": "  I am still not allowed to sit at the grown-ups table.\n\n  This is the third time I have been here, and each time there is f00d, beverages, and then an evenings presentation given by the oldest of us, thanking us each for a life well lived.\n\n  The majority of it doesnt make sense, and, I suppose, whatever happens in the next ten years will help me to understand more of it.\n\n  The I'll get to sit at the grown-ups table.\n\n  You see, its strange. Every decade on my birthday I have gone out to eat, only for something very peculiar to happen. The first time was when I was just ten years old. My parents had taken me and my three closest friends out to eat and play at Carnival Complex, but the second I opened the door, everything was different.\n\n  An empty hall was dimly lit before me, a row of velvet ballisters marked out the entrance to a banquet theater to the left, and there was a mean l00king man standing by the entrance. I reached into my pocket and clutched the unopened pack of birthday Pokemon cards in my pocket. I was scared.\n\nThe second time I came to this place was on an unhappy day. \n\nI had met Renevalut in summer passive after the second year of technical at the local center. She was beautiful, and artistic. I am reminded sometimes of how often in those days I was letting my life and everyone in it pass me by. And it was the night before my twentieth year that she had called, and told me that out paths were no longer paved with bricks intertwined. I had walked three miles down to the lower east half of Chestersfield, off campus to the little coffee shop that she had debuted. It was then, as was before that I had found myself in that strange, p00rly lit hallway.\n\n  There was a group of men standing at the far corner chatting. They stopped and l00ked at me. Three with warm faces that are somehow familiar, brothers, obviously, perhaps relatives of my grandfather? The youngest man has cold eyes and deep furrows under his eyes. With the moppy half head of hair he l00ks closest to death of the group. *\"I wouldnt want to be that guy\"* I mutter to myself. The fifth man in the group reaches in to his pocket and pulls out a ticket, says something form the group, and takes a sip from his coffee mug. I can hear them muttering softly as they each pull out their tickets and head in past the marquee. I am left alone in the hall.\n\n  The marquee is something I have never seen before. It l00ks like your standard ATM machine, except where the buttons typically are there is a big glass screen. I would say its kind of like a TV screen except completely flat, and the picture was so sharp and clear! This must be some sort of University prototype, high end. 'Tap the Screen to begin.' the machine's screen displayed. Unreal.\n\n  \\*\\*\\*DECLINED\\*\\*\\* The machine beeped and the bright red error message displayed for the third time. I couldn't believe this. I don't remember these assholes making me have a ticket for this shitty dinner last time, and I certainly don't think they *charged* me for it. I pounded the machine with my fist in despair and turned to notice the kid that had stumbled in to the entrance way. *Right*.\n\n  Hey Scotty. I said.\n\n  The mean l00king man was walking my way, I turned quickly to leave, but the front door had locked behind me. \"Jake! Calvin!\" I yelled \"Dad! Mom!\"\n\n  \"Hey c00l it kiddo.\" I said. \"They aint here, it just us tonight for dinner.\"\n\n  \"Who are you?\" Scotty asked, fear still in his voice.\n\n  \"Well Scott, my name is Scott also. Scott Hallsdale. Pleased to meet me.\"\n\n  The l00k of shock was as intense as my bleach burnt 90's haircut. I remembered the feeling.\n\n  \"Hey kid, you got that money in your pocket mum and dad gave us for the arcade?\" I asked.\n\n  I had been running late. Later than usual in what was honestly already a chaotic summer. Was it August 14th already? The years marched on.\n\n  A nice dinner out. That was always the go to, but with the long hours trying to help get the enterprise off the ground, and the complications with Allison's pregnancy, I had thought it best to sit and relax at home and enjoy the grill. But I had been running late.\n\n  The eight-o-four channel from A6 to Harrisburg was delayed, and I had missed the connecting bus. It was nearly nine when I arrived at home, ready to lie down more than to c00k and eat. But the front d00r lead not to my living r00m and wonderful wife, but to a dimly lit hallway with a ticketmaster vendor at the far end. *\"Shit this again?\"* I muttered to myself.\n\n  The dinner was first rate. I was surprised the first time I had it to see the variations in the dishes, and had to have a chuckle at the little blonde boy to my left who kept side eyeing and gagging at the heaping mushr00ms I was piling on to prime rib.\n\n  \"Have we been well dressed?\" An old voice cracked and squeaked in the reverberation of an old concert hall microphone. \"I want to start of course by thanking you all for being here tonight, and to remind you *'Things will be better'.\"*\n\n  \"Things will be better!\" A chorus erupted from the grown-ups table to the accompanied sound of cheering laughter and clinking glasses. It dawned on me. That could be a motivational slogan to pitch for the new campaign next month.\n\n  \"...and to expect that the hardships you've overcome will be paramount to..\" The old geezer was whining on. At least the thirty next to me seemed to be enjoying it. All I could think about was Renevalut. I could be spending this time trying to convince her to stay, but at least the meal was g00d.\n\n  \"What I mean to say it that the energy flux you are seeing will never be greater than the nominal integer ration for the forward recuperative phasing.\" Old grandpa was answering questions now. I didnt understand a single thing he was saying so I reached in to my pocket and pulled out the Pokemon packs. Mom and Dad had gotten me one of the new fossil edition packets. I raised my had.\n\n  \"Hey mister do you have a favorite Pokemon?\" I asked.\n\n  \"Charizard.\" The old man replied with out hesitation. \"*Sweet thats my favourite!\"* I thought as I flipped through my new cards.\n\n  \"...as I leave you now I hope to remind you all to live well and be your very best!\" I had been nodding off, thinking of Allison and trying to think of how to explain all this. Thinking of how tired I would be when the baby comes in a few more weeks. The old man had now taken and propped up a thin laptop like device on the podium. The translucent display read '100'.\n\n  The curtains behind the stage drew back and a silver scree became lit with a blurred and shimmering image of a man. \"Hey that kinda l00ks like me.\" I thought.\n\n  \"Ah yes there we go! Everything is in order! Things will be better!\" The old man leaned in to the microphone once more.\n\n  \"Things will be better!\" The cheer came again.\n\n  \"Okay no time to mingle! Thank you again for coming, and whether it be twenty, forty, or even nintey more years before we singularize, then at least know, until then, things will be better!\" The shimmering man on the screen had turned to the audience assembled and spoke. \"Please exit through the gift shop.\" The face of the man was laughing but there was no more sound. The device on the podium was wobbling with intense colours, and I awoke to find myself in bed still clothed from the night before.\n\n  \"Morning sweetie.\" Allison was just coming out of the bathr00m. \"Did you sleep well?\"\n\n  \"Weird dreams.\" I responded, reaching in to my pocket I pulled out a slightly crumpled, brand new Pokemon card. *\"Things will be better.\"* I muttered.",

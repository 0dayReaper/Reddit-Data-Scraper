The ship's hull groaned softly.\n\n\"Yarrrr this not be 'ow me ship norm'ly be workin'\"\n\nThe navigator looked to the captain, panic clear in his eyes. \"We be goin' up cap'n!\"\n\n\"Aye lad. Never in all me years 'ave I seen owt like this.\"\n\n\"There be somethin' up there cap'n. In the sky!\"\n\n\"We be 'eading straight for it!\" Redbeard turned towards his helmsman, \"You tried turnin' that there wheel lad?\"\n\nThe helmsman began frantically turning the wheel, to no avail. He could only stare like the others... stare at that great silver shape in the sky, getting closer and closer. Fear struck his weathered features. He cast aside the wheel and threw himself overboard; his screaming figure disappearing into the depths below. A few deckhands look to eachother, thinking to do the same.\n\n\"Don't be doin' that boys! There be nought but death down there!\"\n\nA ghostly glow illuminated the deck. Sailors stood awestruck at the enormous beast that they approached.\n\n\"It's like a ship cap'n. A great big ship in the sky!\"\n\n\"Ain't no ship I've ever seen be floating in the sky me boy.\" Redbeard stroked his red beard, planning a course of action. \"Well... they 'aven't done sunk us yet so I take it they be wantin' to parley.\"\n\n\"The red drakes don't parley!\" the men shouted in unison.\n\nRedbeard smiled through blackened teeth. \"You be right 'bout that boys. Load the cannons!\"",

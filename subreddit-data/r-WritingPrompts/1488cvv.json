The Azarathian infantry are minutes away from piercing through, if we don\u2019t do anything now, we\u2019ll be decimated!\u201d The young, wide eyed corporal stammered.\n\nI surveyed out position, set up on Ugralith, the last remaining human stronghold, and tallest sand dune, on Fanduras, the desert world. If this outpost fell, then earth would be prime for invasion.\n\n\u201cCall in the Major.\u201d I responded.\n\nI thought I\u2019d never have to use them. After our defeat in the second war, we swore to keep contact with the ghastly beasts at a minimum. Their strong hind legs could propel them across the sand faster than any dune crawler, their razor sharp beaks could break through the toughest of galactic armour in just a few strikes, and their feathers were as strong as steel, and so tightly packed they formed an impenetrable armour.\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask, sir. I don\u2019t like this either, but it\u2019s our last choice. We cannot let the Azarathians take Fanduras, or earth and much more of the Coalitions\u2019 homeworlds will be especially vulnerable. They\u2019re masked and ready for deployment, but the gates are wired to your thumbprint.\u201d\n\nThe Major handed me a gas mask, as we crawled out of the command shelter into the sandstorm. Night had fallen nearly an hour ago (Earthen time) and the Azarathian troops had just began their final assault. We reached the corrugated iron bunker, with a biometric scanner beside the huge floodgates containing the monstrous birds inside.\n\n\u201cEveryone, clear the north wall now! Pull back to the blast shelter!\u201d I ordered into my radio.\n\nI watched as the soldiers began abandoning their positions, fear taking root as they sprinted towards the shelter. The Azarathian infantry took their chance and charged.\n\nI turned to the major. \u201cGod bless us, for what we are about to do.\u201d\n\nI pressed my thumb against the scanner, as the door began to open with a horrifying screech, drowned out by the explosions of Azarathian troops blowing open the north gate. The Major and I dived to the side, as we watched the dark blues sprint towards the infantry with a terrifying screech.\n\nArmour was shredded, bodies was strewn, weapons were discharged and it was over within minutes. Enemy infantry were scrambling backwards, tramping each-other as they tried to exit through the gates, bottleneck if themselves in.\n\nI got up in time just to watch the dark blues streaming off towards the next enemy rallying outpost. I walked towards the gate and picked up a field radio, with only one word discernible amongst the screams.\n\n\u2018Emu\u2019.\n\n\nThis was my first time, I appreciate any feedback. Please notify me of any minor spelling mistakes or formatting issues, I am writing on mobile. Thanks!",

            "comment": "We'd been at it for years, testing every weapon or plague known to man on a batch of cells recovered from a craft that crashed back in 63. Supposedly a farmer watched a flock of geese explode mid-air, and after investigating found a strange ship with nothing but guts over ever inch of the interior.\n\nFor the last 60 years we'd cultivated the cells, determined to map every aspect of the foreign genome or die trying, and then they arrived and for the last 6 years it seemed dying was all we could do. Nothing had an effect. Not radiation or extreme temperature, nor flesh eating bacteria or even the bubonic plague. \n\nWhen they arrived in force in 2017 and began killing you can bet we tried every conventional weapon, bullets just bounced off of them and as the war progressed so did our attempts at leaving a scratch. 4 years ago they did the unthinkable and dropped a nuke on the front, in the heartlands of America, and even the biggest bomb we could muster was rebuffed by whatever ungodly technology they possessed.\n\nOur saving grace was a pure accident, brought in on the coat of a rather unimportant intern. He was attacked by one of Satan's own on the way to work, and as he handed a coffee to one of our top scientists a single feather was shaken loose and drifted slowly down into a petri dish being prepared for the days tests. The reaction was instant,  as was the vomiting of the blood covered intern, and what for years was assumed to be coincidence was now realized to be providence. \n\nThe world's first known interstellar visitor wasn't killed by the world's first interstellar car crash, it was killed by a sudden and inexplicably violent allergic reaction. A few brave sacrifices later and we figured out how to fight back, some countries managing to push out invading forces before they managed to gain a foothold. \n\nNow it was our turn, the time to back the place that this began in. Scores of men stood behind me, with fistfuls of cloth and hearts full of hate. \n\nI took a deep breath, knowing what I was about to say would be written in history books for as long as we managed to survive on this rock, and I chose my world's carefully...\n\n\"PILLOW FIIIIGHT!\"",

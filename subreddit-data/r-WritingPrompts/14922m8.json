            "comment": "The bridge of the R.M.V. Titan's Grasp was dead silent. The gaze of all the executive officers was drawn towards the radar officers' console. Captain Tormund's voice was saturated with concern as he broke the silence.\n\n\"Can you repeat that Lt. Bradley?\"\n\nLt. Bradley's disbelieving stare at her console never broke as she repeated, \n\n\"We... We've just been pinged, sir.\"\n\nCaptain Tormund's thick auburn eyebrows seemed to be stitched to his hairline. He surveyed the entire bridge crew, searching their faces to ensure that they had all indeed heard the same words. Their surprise was unmistakable. \n\n\"And what, pray tell, has done this to us Lt.?\"\n\nThe captain's voice was shaky and hesitant. Not befitting a man of his stature. He steeled himself for the reply. Bradley's voice echoed his own fear.\n\n\"Something...  Big.\"\n\nGasps were issued amongst all present. Eyes widened. Pulses quickened. Curses were muttered sotto voce. Comms Officer Cunningham queried the captain,\n\n\"Sh, shall I..  report this to Mission Command, Sir?\"\n\nTormund nodded an affirmative at comms, knowing that there wouldn't be any other ship capable of rescue anywhere near completion for another two years. The report wouldn't even reach Earth space for nearly twenty minutes at this range. They were supposed to be alone. They crewed the first and only human ship capable of .5 C, and something had just pinged them. Bradley suddenly shouted back at the captain, \n\n\"It's moving to intercept! Shit! Brace for Impact!\" \n\nEvery speaker and alarm in the bridge began desperate songs of warning. Crash belts began clipping into place, and knuckles turned white as hands gripped their chairs. Bradley's console beeped with increasing frequency until all were convinced that death was upon them, and then, nothing. Once again, silence dominated the bridge. Eyes that had been cemented shut began to open. Hands unclinched. Terrified glances were shared. Once again, Tormund's voice broke the silence, \n\n\"Helm, get us the fuck out of here.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the Engineering department...\n\nVasilly Kurkov loosed an intense belly laugh. His mission had been a success. The simulated emergency emulator had performed exactly as planned. He grinned a mile wide as he chuckled to himself with his heavy Russian accent,\n\n\"Stupid fucking vesterners. Boss vill shit a potato ven he hears this shit!\"",

            "comment": "\"Captain, proximity alert!\"\n\nCaptain Lushenko waved her hand over her shoulder. \"Yes, yes. We're in the asteroid belt, there's small debris everywhere. Resume the subsurface probe of Ceres.\"\n\n\"Captain, proximity alert can't decide whether it's a swarm of hundreds of small objects, or one large object. And... its trajectory is... changing.\"\n\nLushenko frowned and turned toward the scanner technician - her and everyone else on the small bridge. Six pairs of eyes scowled at Ensign Mariov. Every one of the bridge crew had objected to being assigned a green Academy graduate who'd never been into orbit before, let alone on a flight as important as Mission Venture One, the very first crew in human history to survey and mine an asteroid. But Mariov's Academy grades were flawless, so...\n\n\"Explain,\" ordered Lushenko. She turned back to the viewport to avoid putting too much pressure on the kid. Out the window she could see the surface of Ceres, one of the largest asteroids in the Belt, almost big enough to qualify as a dwarf planet, but not big enough to clear its orbit of other debris. The surface was - wait, what the hell? \"Mariov, is that the object?\" Lushenko pointed at what appeared to be a cloud of small black objects, stark against the reflective surface of the asteroid. They moved steadily at first, then twisted in sync, coordinated, almost like a flock of birds.\n\n\"Yes Captain,\" replied Ensign Mariov. \"Scanner can't get a lock, it's like they're absorbing most of the frequencies we use.\"\n\nThe rest of the bridge crew had left their stations and crowded around the viewport. Lushenko cleared her throat. \"Helm, engineering. Take us in for a closer look.\" Reluctantly, Caspar and Dave returned to their stations and set to work, mumbling to each other for adjustments and corrections. \n\nLushenko 'stood' at the viewport, her boots hooked into straps on the floor to provide a familiar perspective in zero gravity. She crossed her arms behind her back and frowned out at the cloud of black shapes, growing steadily larger. \n\nAll of a sudden, the cloud turned toward the *Durin* and rushed past the ship on all sides, elongated but small black shapes flitting around in frantic, coordinated motion. There was something intimidating, yet graceful about the movement. Lushenko's eyes widened as she got a good-enough look at some of the nearest objects.\n\n\"They're... fish,\" she murmured. \n\n\"What?\" scoffed Dave. \"That's absurd. We're in the asteroid belt. Fish in space? Space fish?\"\n\nAfter a moment of tapping at switches, Mariov piped up. \"Uh... confirmed, Captain. Visual instrumentation shows... fish. Black fish, flat and wide like ocean sunfish, highly absorbent of the visual spectrum and plenty of other wavelengths of radiation. Sending the images to all consoles.\"\n\nThe crew's reactions ranged from surprise to disbelief, excitement to rejection. Lushenko wasn't sure what to do other than to record whatever they could - this was a mining ship with instrumentation geared toward geological survey and excavation, not biological research. Part of Lushenko's analytical mind wondered what had caused the fish to swim right at and past the *Durin*, almost as if they'd been spooked, but most of her was thinking about how much of a profit bonus they'd get from a discovery as important as this one.\n\n\"Captain,\" said Ensign Mariov. \"Proximity alert.\"\n\nThere was something in Mariov's voice... \"You mean the alert has ended?\" Lushenko asked, still staring out the viewport.\n\n\"No, Captain. New alert. Something... much bigger.\"\n\nLushenko's mouth went dry as she saw the shadow passing over Ceres. \"All... all stations,\" she stammered. \"Divert all power to engines, drills, and lasers.\"\n\nAs one, the bridge crew turned to face Lushenko, eyes wide. \"Captain, er... what?\" asked Caspar.\n\n\"Do it!\" shouted the captain. The shadow over Ceres grew, and Lushenko's face paled. \"If we want to make it home alive, we're going fishing.\"",

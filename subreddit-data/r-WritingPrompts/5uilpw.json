This traveller doesn't want to kill Hitler, he wants to teach him to paint. He pulls off his hood to reveal the frizzy afro of Bob Ross.",

He continues to stare at the easel, thinking. \n\nAfter a while he felt a firm, calming hand on his shoulder. He sighed, hanging his head wearily. \"Are you yet another man come to end my life, if you can even see it that way?\" The hand didn't answer, as it had no mouth. However, it's owner did, speaking the soft, assuaging tones that had come to make him famous. \n\n\"No sir. I've seen too much death and war to want to do another such thing. Instead, I have come as a tutor. Here, grab that 2 inch brush and dip it in some titanium white and prussian blue.\"\n\nHitler did such a thing, and the man behind him nodded. \"Good. Now, mix them together, until you have a rather nice pale blue...\" \n\nAdolf did so, his brush strokes trembling across the pallette. \"Easy there tiger, try to keep yourself calm, now. Painting is all about being steady, confident.\" Adolf nodded again, and went this time, albeit a bit slower, and mixed another selection. After he had done this the stranger patted his shoulder. \n\"Good, now let's see you paint a nice, open sky.\"\n\"But how? I can barely paint the ground, let allow what lies above it!\" \nSighing, the man grabbed a firm hold of his arm and lifted it up. \n\n\"All you have to do is nice, tiny Xs, like so..\" \nA portion, the top left hand corner was soon filled with a nice layer of blue. \n\"Now go ahead, try it.\" \nAdolf sighed and attempted this, and, to his surprise, mimicked the man's stroke almost perfectly.\n\n\"Ah! There ya go! Now, wash that brush off in your water and beat the devil out of it on your wood there...\" \n\nAt this point, adolf couldn't help but turn around in surprise. \"You want me to beat my easel with it..?\" \n\nThe afro'd figure behind him nodded, pulling off his woolen hood. \"Yes sir I Do. Go on. It won't hurt it.\" \n\n\"Tell me who you are first, then maybe I will...\" \nThe figure smiled a bright smile, as a squirrel popped out of his hair.\n\"Why, I'm Bob. Bob Ross. And I heard you wanted to be a painter.\"\n\n------------\nJust popping in to say thank you the beautiful person who have me a gold.",

            "comment": "Hitler was having a piece of banana cake when Bob Ross walked in.\n\n\"And I just feel like no one *gets* me, you know?\" The future Fuhrer was saying to one of his servants, as he \nsprayed whipped cream over the cake, distracted. \"I mean, I know most artists are destined to be posthumous, \nbut\u2026 I don't know, I guess I want the fame and the fortune too, you know?\"\n\n\"*Ja*, It is very hard, my master,\" the man said, in a German accent but in English for no reason at all, just like foreign characters in the movies.\n\n\"Hey, Hitler,\" Bob said, stepping in, confident. \"May I?\" he pulled a chair sat down without waiting for an answer.\n\n\"What is this!?\"\n\n\"Listen, I'm Bob Ross and I'm from the future and I paint stuff.\"\n\n\"Bob Ross?\"\n\n\"Yes. Here's the thing \u2013 I'm supposed to come here and teach you how to paint so you'll be a good painter and not \ninvade Poland and then the rest of Europe and cause the death of millions of people.\"\n\n\"Holy shit, I do that!?\" Hitler widened his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, yes. It's awful. People still use your name as a reference to evil. There's even an internet law based on how \nlong it takes until someone compares a certain situation to Nazi Germany during an argument.\"\n\n\"What's the internet?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Bob leaned forward. \"This is what we're going to do \u2013 I'm going to teach you how to \u2013\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Hitler's servant said, in that same fake accent. \"I'm afraid I must intervene here.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Ross, have you considered the twist?\"\n\n\"The twist?\"\n\n\"Yes. The fact that you'll teach this man how to paint, he'll grow to be a famous painter, not invade anything, and \nwhen you return to your home time you'll find out that another man named, I don't know, Hans, has taken over \nGermany and did worse things than Adolf here could ever do.\"\n\nRoss frowned. \"I don't follow.\"\n\n\"You don't watch much Twilight Zone, do you?\" The servant asked.\n\n\"How do you know about the Twilight Zone? This is 1910.\"\n\n\"Never mind about that.\" The servant leaned back. \"My name is Hans, Ross. And I will take over Germany if you \nteach Adolf how to paint.\"\n\n\"Why!? Why would you do that?\"\n\n\"Why else would I be in the scene? Why would Hitler not be alone when you walked in? I have to serve some \npurpose for the plot, right? And let's face it \u2013 go back in time and kill/talk/convince/teach Hitler is a trope we've \nseen before, and it always ends like this. In fact, most time traveling tropes tend to end with a silly variation of the butterfly effect we-made-things-even-worse twist. Let's not make this prompt another example.\"\n\nBob Ross scratched his head and thought about this. \"Shit. Okay. I guess. But what do we do now?\"\n\n\"Now we find a way to subvert time traveling tropes and present something fresh for the readers. And fast, because they're getting impatient.\"\n\n\"Why are they getting impatient? We're still at 500 words!\"\n\n\"Yes, but we've gone post-modern self-referential, characters-acknowledging-their-own-stories. That annoys some \npeople.\"\n\n\"It's not really my fault, look at the prompt. Where do you go with time traveling Bob Ross and Hitler that's not \nself-referential parody?\"\n\n\"Now you're blaming the OP for your shortcomings as a storyteller. Classy.\"\n\n\"Not *my* shortcomings. I'm not the author.\"\n\nThey both turn and stare at me for a second. I shrug.\n\n\"Anyway,\" Hans said, resuming the conversation. \"Do something different. Fast.\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Huuuuuuh\u2026. Fuck, I don't know. Kiss Hitler!\"\n\n\"Erotic Nazi Fanfic? No thanks.\"\n\n\"Okay, then\u2026 you have cancer, and Hitler nurses you to health, but in the end we find out *Hitler* has cancer too, and \u2013\"\n\n\"I'm not taking part in The Fault in our Stars Feat. Adolf Hitler. It ain't gonna happen.\"\n\n\"Well, you gotta do something, and fast, because time is running out.\"\n\n\"Hitler? Any suggestions?\"\n\nAdolf looked around. He got up and paced. \"I don't know. Can you just return to your present time and call it a \nday?\"\n\n\"And then everything happens as it's supposed to? That's boring.\"\n\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Hitler stopped. \"I don't know then. I really don't know.\"\n\nHans shook his head. \"Okay, I got this.\" He grabbed a little radio device from his pocket and spoke into it. \"Send them in.\"\n\nRoss frowned. \"Send who in?\"\n\nStatic emerged from the radio for a second, then a voice answered: \"Copy that.\"\n\n\"Send who in?\" Adolf repeated. \"What's happening?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Hans said, getting up. \"If we're in a Hitler and Bob Ross time traveling prompt and we can't figure out a way \nto turn it into something fresh, we might as well embrace irony and self-mockery to the full extent of Writing \nPrompt's classic tropes.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nThe door came open behind Ross. He turned back and watched as two teenagers walked in \u2013 a boy in round \nglasses and a scar on his forehead and a girl that looked a lot like Emma Watson. \n\n\"Hey Harry, hey Hermione. Sorry to drag you into yet another prompt. You got the time turner?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" Harry said, in a bored tone.\n\n\"Harry Potter fanfic? Really?\" Ross shook his head. \"For fuck's sake.\"\n\n\"If we're gonna go down the rabbit's hole, let's do it proudly.\"\n\nHermione started setting the time turner. Harry looked around, curious. Ross sighed.\n\n\"Fuck that, I'm out,\" Hitler said, and then he jumped out the window, and then WW II didn't happen, but the \nStatute of Secrecy *was* violated on account of the whole thing and muggles learned about magic and when Ross returned to his present day no one gave a shit about static paintings anymore, so he died a poor man, which I guess is irony or whatever, I don't even care.\n\n_____\n\n*For more information on why the fourth wall is damaging your health and you should get rid of it, check out /r/psycho_alpaca =)*\n\n",

Apparently those damn toilets wouldn't unclog themselves. Even though u/Darrkett had a masters degree in unclogging toilets, he still sometimes wondered why he had decided to become a professional toilet unclogger. \"Never make your passion a job\" they had told him in college, but he still rushed into \"Plungers 101\" with wreckless abandon. Nobody could stop him. But as the wind reached a crescendo and died into the distance, he realized that his choice of work was not what was truly bothering him.\n\nHis stomach felt queasy from all of the imitation crabmeat he had devoured after reading his \"Beginner's Guide to Sushi\" book he had checked out from the library. His stomach had felt queasy the entire week as he had practiced making California Rolls on the bathroom floors at work. He shook his head as his bowels shook with fright. No, his choice of dinner was not what was bothering him either. *What was eating him from inside?!*\n\nAnd then, as he reread the impeccable writing of u/psycho_alpaca that frigid February evening, it dawned on him. He was angry that nobody had given this genius writer any gold! He unclenched his shivering fists enough to write a loving tribute to u/psycho_alpaca, giving him a beautiful internet Michelob Light as proof of his respect. He finished writing and slid his phone into his pocket with a sad sigh. Sadly, nobody else would ever appreciate the story enough to give u/psycho_alpaca gold.\n\nIt wasn't until u/Darrkett got home, pulled out his tray of weeks old leftover California rolls, and logged back onto reddit that he saw how u/psycho_alpaca had finally got the gold he so richly deserved. u/Darrkett smiled into the darkness as he tried to find a bottle opener for his Michelob Light that clearly said \"twist off\" on the side. At least some things were still right with the world.",

                    "comment": "**If anything, this scenario might have resulted in Adolf Hitler becoming the Reich.** The popular myth is that Hitler was a bad painter. In fact he just couldn't make it to the best art school at the time but continued painting to sustain himself. Had Hitler given up painting, he would have starved or would have needed to get a regular job, and given the nature of that for the time, wouldn't have had the time to get invested in politics and paintings. In fact Hitler's pictures of landmarks was what sustained him for years.\n\nSome history:\n\n1. Adolf failed to get into the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1907. It was in fact the greatest art school in Europe at the time. He was specifically rejected because he lacked drawing the human form but was good at architecture. However, since he lacked a high school diploma, entering the architecture school in VAFA showed poor prospects. In actuality and contrary to popular belief, Hitler's paintings of buildings are pretty good for the time and he would have been able to get into a lesser school. In 1908, after his mother passed from cancer, he went to Vienna again and was homeless. Of course he failed to get into the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts upon a second try.\n\n2. For the next two years he turned to Catholicism which in the early 1900's was very intolerant of other religions. At the end of 1909 he ended up in a homeless shelter and stayed until the war. During this time he was still selling paintings to survive and his poverty changed his politics. If he instead was encouraged to get a regular job or do something else, history might have been very different, but **he insisted on making a living by painting.**\n\n3. At first he was put off by anti-semitism but in his research on the literature started hating Jewish people himself, this was sometime in 1910-1911. In 1913 he left Vienna and went to Germany to avoid the military draft for a nation he started despising due to local politics and instead joined the German military where he became a war hero of World War I. This would enable him to get credibility and enter politics later on. The rest is history.\n\n**If anything, Bob Ross would have continued the creation of Hitler as we know it.**",

He had such knowledge of the german people's anger that he could even execute the people who opposed him. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of losing was his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his right hand how to operate a Walther PP, then his right hand killed him in his bunker. Ironic... his reflexes were so used to imposing death upon his enemies, that he even killed him self.",

He was a war hero and championed education, love of family and pets, workers rights, and honorable values. He pushed populist reforms and even helped push a car for the masses and a highway system to follow it. These are not things that are necessarily negative and it'll tell people that anyone and anything could take a dark turn.\n\nSo on the other hand he did some terrible nasty things. Most people are unable to balance these things out and it would weird them out.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of right off the bat would be something like Starship Troopers (the movie) which was a parody of a Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film but most people missed the point. Using that, a continuation would be Rico getting into politics as a war hero, in a universe where the Federation gets into a losing stalemate with the Bugs. So he takes his meritocratic and fascist values into populism to the extremes in a new war.",

That would have left the world in a very similar position, only without Israel most likely (no pity if you don't get massacred).\n\nIf we hadn't, Russia would have finished industrializing and then started poking its nose everywhere, possibly leading to a war. Japan was invading China anyway so either the UK and the US would step up their embargos and force a war in the Pacific anyway or ignore the atrocities there.\n\nHonestly we barely avoided a war during the Cold War and that was with the hindsight of the Second World War so I'm not so sure we would have dodged it without it.",

(Attempt 27)\n\nThe council members exchanged sideways glances with one another as the one all the way on the left adjusted the microphone in front of him. \n\n\"I just want to clarify... this is your 27th plan?\" The old man on the left croaked. \n\n\"No sir, this is the 27th plan in this series of plans.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"This is plan number 3,826\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Maybe not. I actually lost count somewhere in the middle and rounded off at some point.\"\n\n\"Right so-\"\n\n\"It might be higher.\"\n\n\"So your pla-\"\n\n\"Could be lower.\"\n\nThe councilman sighed in frustration and looked to his other council members for help. They shrugged, he shrugged back, the ratty man shrugged. The old man adjusted microphone again and looked down at the ratty man below. \n\n\"Your plan then.\"\n\n\"Right, well... firstly I'm Dr. Steven Haught-Fujj. I know maybe it's not typical for you people to see a scientist in here with a plan for assassination, but hear me out.\" The Doctor reached for a piece of chalk and then climbed a ladder that was three times his size. \"It all starts with a single banana.\" \n\nHaught-Fujj wrote \"Banana\" on the chalkboard in big letters.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" a woman in the center of the table laughed \"banana?\"\n\n\"Yes, see... we need the peel\" he wrote PEEL, \"but we really need him to use the peel, you see?\"\n\nThe scientist started scrawling at a rapid pace, explaining just as fast. \"And then he reaches for the van of whipped cream only to realize he shouldn't even have this in the first place!\"\n\n\"... So he drops the peel to the floor, having filled his hands with the canned pecans, whipped cream, empty cherry jar, and the cherry he found on his nightstand...\"\n\n\"... and in a rage he'll storm out of his bedroom to escape the smell of skunk and slip on the banana peel, breaking the cherry jar and stabbing himself with the glass.\"\n\nThe little doctor looked up at his chalkboard as he circled the final word: GLASS. Smiling and full of pride he turned to face the council.\n\n\"So, just to clarify. Again...\" the older councilman spoke up again, \"banana peel?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Okay, approved. Go for it.\"\n\nThe eager Dr. Steven jumped and squealed, \"Where's the time chamber?!\"\n\n\"Down the hall.\"\n\nThe small man was lead to a gigantic room filled with computer equipment and clocks. \n\n\"Why are there so many clocks?\"\n\n\"Ambience,\" a guard snapped.\n\nThe guard flipped a switch and a bright light surrounded the doctor, who landed in 1941. He slowly stepped forward toward a young Hitler and as he placed the first cherry atop Adolphs head he knew he had made a mistake.",

Atmosphere? Lighting? A blitz of color?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou start by not painting,\u201d Bob said. \u201cFirst you need to understand. You start by thinking.\u201d\n\nThe young aspiring artist flipped his hair to the side, narrowing his eyes.\n\n\u201cCareful deliberation is the key to a great painting,\u201d Bob continued. \u201cRemember; every stroke of the brush has consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I start simple?\u201d Adolf said. \u201cThe falling snow!\u201d\n\nBob ran a hand through his thick hair and took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cThat is a good place to start. A snowflake is one of Nature\u2019s most beautiful creations,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey\u2019re all made out of the same water, but every snowflake is unique\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I get it now,\u201d Adolf said and made a few quick strokes across the canvas. \u201cThe canvas is the province of my expression. It is a domain that I, alone, control and shape to fit my unique ideas.\u201d\n\nBob shook his head and stopped the eager hand of the young artist.\n\n\u201cYour brush is a coryph\u00e9e, and the canvas is a stage of white ice. The stage belongs to the art, not the artist,\u201d Bob said.\n\n\u201cSo, I need to pour my mind onto the canvas,\u201d Adolf said and made another series of quick strokes. \u201cI need to get it all out, and not consider my desires!\u201d\n\nBob leaned over and plucked the brush out of young man\u2019s moving hand mid-motion. \n\n\u201cWrong; your heart is your most valuable consultant,\u201d Bob said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t rush. Some ideas are better left unexplored. Each color and stroke have to feel right in your heart. If your strokes are too fast and too many, your heart won\u2019t be able to keep up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I finally get it\u2026\u201d\n\nCertain that he had taught Adolf the value of constraint and diversity, Bob Ross returned to his own time. On the way to the kitchen to grab a snack, he noticed that something was wrong with his world globe. The place that had previously said Europe now had big capital letters spelling GERMANY.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d Bob mumbled and grabbed his history book.\n\n*Due to his icy restraint and meticulous planning, Hitler avoided a war on two fronts, taking his time to first defeat France and Great Britain before attacking Russia. Modern scholars have placed Hitler among iconic conquerors such as Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan, and named him The Artist of Warfare.*\n\n*****\n[/r/Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lilwa_Dexel/comments/5foev0/welcome/)",

            "comment": "The man outside knocked on the door hard. He paused for a minute, still as a statue, then knocked once again. The rain fell outside in a steady rhythm, and by this time the man\u2019s shoes had become damp. A minute passed, then another. The man crouched under the awning and pulled his bag to safety. It had begun to leak an ocean of colors. Red and blue mixed with green, as a wave a rainwater swept it down the muddy steps. \n\nThe door creaked open and a suspicious face peeked through the crack. \u201cHallo, was willst do?\u201d The man behind the door inquired. The man on the other side cocked his head and put his hand do his ear. Almost invisible with the naked eye, a small earpiece was nestled firmly in his ear. It whirred to life. \u201cHello, what do you want?\u201d The earpiece repeated. \n\n\u201cHello, my name is Bob Ross. If you have a moment, I\u2019d like to teach you about the joys of painting.\u201d The man\u2019s voice outside was soothing, and as soon as he had finished his sentence a small device in his hand translated it for his company. \n\n\u201cMind if I come in?\u201d\n\nWith that, Bob shouldered his way inside. With a gentle dominance, he lay his bag on the table and began unpacking.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? What is this?\u201d The owner of the house backed away from the table, and it was clear he grew increasingly uneasy.\n\n\u201cI just want to show you the joy of painting.\u201d Bob continued, as he took a canvas out of his bag. \u201cJust give me a chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this? Get out of my house.\"\n\nBob ignored the request; \u201cI just like to spread joy.\u201d With that, a genuine smile crept across Bob\u2019s face, and he drew back his hood to reveal a bushy afro underneath. \u201cPlease my friend, take a seat.\u201d \n\n\u201cHitler.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Hitler, take a seat.\u201d\n\nHitler reclined warily onto his sofa while Bob set up the canvas across from him. \n\n\u201cNow, what I like to paint most is the beauty of nature. There\u2019s just something so magical about our world. First, I want to get a nice blue for the sky, and some dark hues for the ground. Let\u2019s make it a nice summer scene in contrast to all this dreariness.\u201d\n\nBob continued with his presentation, explaining each technique and stroke. Hitler grew more and more interested, and eventually rose to inspect the painting.\n \n\u201cWhy do you do such thin strokes of the brush? I would think a more decisive movement would be key.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Hitler, sometimes the best art comes from gentleness and patience.\u201d Bob\u2019s soothing voice answered. \n\nBob finished his painting; it had been nearly three hours. He usually worked at a faster rate, but this was one painting that couldn\u2019t afford any mistakes. \u201cSo Hitler, what do you think. Want to take a turn?\u201d\n\nHitler shifted, and the creak of the floorboards beneath his boots was the only sound. He wordlessly swept his hands around the paintings frames and touched its surface with the utmost care. \n\n\u201cWhy is it you paint, Bob?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I love to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel the same, yet I have never produced a piece such as this.\" Hitler paused, \"this is truly a masterpiece.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can teach you all I know. What do you say?\u201d\n\nHitler closed his eyes and rocked back and forth. \"I...\" He trailed off. \"I'm not...\" He stopped, and put his hand to his mustache. \n\nBob reached for his coat, and fingered a sleek metal object. There was only one thing to do if Hitler said no.\n",

            "comment": "The German was at his wit's end, almost ready to throw away the canvas completely.\n\nWere it not for the man with the strange hair, it would have been one of hundreds tossed aside.\n\n\"Now remember what I said Adolph\" the stranger named Bob said with his gentle voice.\n\nHitler sighed, \"There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.\" He remembered and replied almost robotically.\n\nBob nodded, with his strange hair gently shaking. His brush working a nearby canvas as he hummed a wordless tune.\n\nHitler could only stare at this oddity of a man and wonder *'How does he stay so positive?!'*\n\nHe wanted to know more about America, the country this man belonged to, but he always shrugged off any specific questions.\n\nThe only thing Bob acknowledged was that previous attempts on Adolph's life were from people of his time and some set in Bob's future. Yet here this stranger stood, painting as if he was in his own studio.\n\nDespite his attempts to apply for the Academy, Hitler was turned down every moment. His personal life was taking a turn for the worse as well.\nMore and more he was frustrated, angry, unhappy, and needed to vent somewhere. He found that place in the happy settings that he and Bob created.\n\nWonderful trees, beautiful skies, a utopia, and one Adolph wished would be so in reality.\nThen one day, Bob was not at the easel. He stared at a nearby window looking at the populace below.\n\"I didn't care much to draw people.\" Bob broke the silence. \n\nAdolph was slightly shocked by this admission of professional weakness. Bob never admitted to anything limiting himself or Adolph, always encouraging that anything is possible. Adolph wondered if this was a test, \"Yes they do require some extra skill compared to a happy little tree.\" He tried to smile as he replied.\n\nBob turned to look Adolph in the eyes; warm but still distant, as though looking at something millions of miles away.\n\"Capturing the esscence of people is hard to do on paint. What matters is capturing the imagination of people as they look at your pantings *right there*.\" The man's gaze returned back to Adolph, taking his shoulder and guiding the young German to another room.\n\nIt was filled with all of Adolph's past pantings, ones he thought he threw away. He gave Bob an incredulous look, \"I threw these away! They are garbage! They are mis--\"\n\nBob cut him off, \"They are happy accidents. Merely pantings you haven't finished because you gave up on them. Just like how so many give up on lots of things and others.\"\n\nGrabbing Adolph rather roughly, he spun the man to face his previous discards. \"You left every one of these? Why?\" Pointing to a random picture, \"Because it was after your rejection letter?\" Then another, \"Because that one girl you like didn't reciprocate?\" Another off in the corner, \"Because you were so caught up in the details you didn't remember the heart of your creation?!\"\n\nAt this point Adolph's anger boiled, \"YES YES and YES! All of them are failures. The Academy wouldn't take suchs sloppy details! **I AM A FAILURE!**\" Tears almost forming in the corners of his eyes.\n\nBob released his shoulders, the calm voice returning, \"So who are you painting for? Them or you? Each of these paintings deserve a chance to be finished. That's art, that's what is missing, and that's why I want you to finish them.\"\n\nSo the weeks went, Adolph Hitler consulted Bob Ross on every \"mistake\" he wanted to discard. Bob would offer advice on what could be used to improve upon the paintings. As they worked together, Adolph lost his resentment to society little by little and replaced it with his own pride on the art.\n\nIt was later when Bob announced a public display at a nearby park, featuring Hitler's works. The presentation wasn't to the art critics, the Academy, or anyone of high importance to society. It was to the common man and woman. The beggars, the old, the Jews and the Gentiles alike. Some found his art interesting, some disagreed, others found it boring, but those that stayed grouped around him to ask about his styles. With each presentation, the small groups grew.\n\nBob tried to show Adolph Hitler that every man, woman, and child deserves to see art. It wasn't reserved for anyone special. It was there for everyone to touch their hearts. As a result of these presentations he made waves, for good and ill, in the art world. Slowly Adolph was displaying his art in public or even painting on the sides of buildings in secret. All of this to show his audience, his *people*, that they had the power to choose what art was instead of the academies.\n\nBob eventually returned to his own time, hoping that the swell of the audience would give Adolph the love he apparently didn't get in his life. As Bob noted subtle changes to the \"present\" he noticed that WW2 sadly still occured, but under different circumstances.\n\nResearching Hitler's life, he found that the young man was killed in WW1 by a jealous French prostitute.

            "comment": "The paint ran down the canvas, slowly trailing through the empty blank sheet as a deep sigh escaped my mouth. My lip quivered as I stood silently alone my modest and small room. I had been up for 3 days and the stench of stale coffee, dirty pastille paints and unlaundered clothes filled the room. A little tap echoed from the door. Who the hell could that be? It's 3 in the morning and I'm certainly not expecting anyone right now, I furiously marched over and slam the door open. Strangely enough I'm was greeted by a kind old man in a dark robe. He was holding a painting case and a blank canvas. He smiled and I was immediately disarmed and comforted by the warmness from it. I shyly motioned for him to come in.\n\nDressed in simple buttoned up shirt and blue american style jeans, I was immediately cautious but something about him seems gentle and kind. Such strange hair, it was big and bushy and unkempt, I found myself starring at it for a fraction too long. \"Hello, I'm Bob\", his German was broken but his greeting is earnest and I shook his hand. Before I could respond he looked around the room and said \"So you paint, well glad I got here because you look like you could use a Friend.\"\n\nThe room was a mess, half eaten food and cold cups of coffee litter the shelves and table space. The floor was covered in ripped up attempts at 'Art' and pictures of her were scattered over my bed, where I had left them 3 days ago. I didn't go to that side of the room, I was scared to close my eyes. All I can see was her face. \"Girl troubles huh?\" I angrily flare my glaze at him when I realise he had already set up his canvas next to mine and had begun painting.\n\nHe started off with a simple dark shade of green as he made long strokes of his brush and freely splashed it across the canvas. Adding dabs of white to lighten the green as he worked his way up the canvas. He motioned me over when he handed me my brush, still wet with paint. I picked up a new canvas but Bob held my hand and said softly, \"It's fine, just finish what you started.\" I shake my head, the mess off colour I had left on it one has dried and now it's a swirling mess of red, orange and brown. I was pretty angry when I had started. \"There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents.\" Something about his words comforted me. Bob continued talk as I notice that the dark shade of green is starting to resemble a meadow in the country at night as Bob uses a deep purple as the Sky while he decorates it with clouds and mountains in the foreground.\n\n\"You know, when I'm feeling down in the dumps and I have no one to talk to I like to paint little friends. See this cloud here, he's my friend, he's just floating around looking over his little friends\" Bob began to spot the grass with white globs of paint, they start taking the shape of grazing sheep in the cool midnight field. I redirected my focus to my canvas filled with such angry colours in such deep contrast to his peaceful work. \"Remember, no mistakes, just happy accidents.\"\n\nWe painted for hours and Bob kept talking... I said nothing for a long time but he would just smile and reassure me as I worked on my piece. I had pictured a Sunday morning in the country with my father as he would take me up a dusty trail up a hill near our house to over look our small town. So I painted a man standing on a mountain over looking a city at Sunrise. While I worked and Bob talked I would notice small things he would do like add small details to everything on the canvas, like he was slowly telling a story piece by piece.\n\nI could tell he loved art, he kept encouraging me and telling me small tricks to make all the houses and trees and clouds pop and stand out while I slowly pieced together a new happy story I had made come to life from the ghost of a forgotten memory. I kept painting and working on the small things that I thought needed fixing, a little dab of blue here and a smear of yellow here as I added an ocean and a dazzling aura of sunlight illuminating the world I had created.\n\nAnd then finally it was done, a man standing atop a mountain looking over the land he loves. I felt pride, I felt calm, I felt the sunshine through the window and the cold breeze of the door open behind me. And on my bed laid a gorgeous painting of a Shepard sleeping in a field amongst his herd under a beautiful starry night. Next to it was a note that just read.\n\n\"Forgive yourself and forgive her, your friend - Bob\"\n\nHe had picked up the scattered pictures and placed them on the table but left one of us smiling and holding hands. I walked over to my painting and began outlining a second figure.",

            "comment": "Hitler paused, he had never seen an afro before.  There's an obscure law of physics where having a 'fro causes your DNA to stretch during time travel resulting in random face twitches that occur long after you return home and sometimes immediate death can occur by your lungs freezing up and you stop breathing.  Time itself seems to transform again in these agonizing final minutes of desperately wanting air but your lungs won't move.  The condition is known as Twice the Time Travel or what scientists call TTTT (mathematicians and lazy people simply say quad T).  Ever since time travel became mainstream every scientist from every era has made it their quest to make the connection between afros and this tragic disease, the only known side effect of time travel.  Some of the best minds from the future, the ones who cured cancer and created the machines to turn salt water into fresh water have tackled this science mystery but there has been no other solution but to simply get rid of the beautiful 'fro.  Even the best of the time traveling assassins from the various eras of the afro don't like to risk it and thus they always cut their hair. But not Bob.  Bob wasn't afraid of time travel, or possible excruciating death or Hitler.  He had made the journey, he was on the other side, he was in front of Hitler in every ounce of his Bob Ross glory, unchanged.  Bob locked eye contact with Hitler, who was staring.  Bob said nothing.  His left eyebrow started to twitch.  \n\nHitler didn't notice the eyebrow twitch.  He was absorbed in his own head, thinking about his mustache and how it didn't hold a candle in the wind to this stranger's hair.  How could he get his own hair to do the same? Women had always eluded Hitler.  He felt if he could learn how to do his hair like this man's he could have any woman he wanted.  Maybe he could even take over the world.  Bob holds out a fistful of paintbrushes and some paint.  \"I know you don't know me, but I know you\" Bob stated.  \"I've come to help teach you to paint all your dreams on a canvas\".  \n\n\"Nevermind that\" Hitler replied, gazing beyond the paint brushes, paint, and above the man's twitching eyebrow.  His eyes fixed on the hair.  \"I want to ask YOU about something\"....",

If it continued like that, Bob would be successful, WW2 would never happen. \n\nOne day, as Bob woke up in his bed, he saw another time traveller sitting in his room. \n\n\u201cHi, Mr. Ross\u201d \u2013 said the time traveller. \n\nBob did not answer. \n\n\u201cI have to admit, you have been quite unexpectedly successful. Not only have you thought him how to paint, but also, it seems like you have molded Hitler into a charming fellow. You should be really proud.\u201d \n\nBob planned to say something, but the time traveller rudely went on speaking.\n\n\u201cYou see, Mr. Ross we have run the simulations and it turns out we were quite, quite wrong. It is essential that WW2 happens.\u201d \n\nBob wanted to ask why, but he was interrupted again. \n\n\u201cBob, if Hitler does not wrestle control of the Germany. All the scientists, who have immigrated to USA in 1933, will stay happily where they are. This means that Germans will be first to develop the nuclear bomb and that is when they start the WW2, they will also be first to develop the time travelling machine, so if we don\u2019t fix this now we will never have the chance\u201d.\n\nGermans ruling the world is bad thought Bob, but what could he do, Hitler was really not that bad of a human being anymore. \n\nThe time traveller continued \u2013 \u201cAs I have said earlier, you were too successful. At this point you are his only friend. So, Mr. Ross future has one more favor to ask. You need to be killed painfully in front of Adolf Hitler by the group of Jews.\u201d \n\nBob was expecting everything, but this.   \n\n--\nFirst WP and not a native speaker so forgive me for the mistakes.",

            "comment": "Sometimes I hate my job. Simply hate it. At this point I've killed 36 time travelers, they keep coming, I keep killing. I often wish I could just let them finish their job, but at what cost? This was my reward for being the best. I get to do the worst. Each traveler I've killed has had the same idea. Go back, save millions; by killing the most wretched man in history.\n\nI would do the same, in fact I did. When I first invented the means to travel in time I had a grand time, I was rich, I had everything anyone could ever want. I had seen the most amazing things, but at some point the guilt of not using my invention for something better got the best of me. I went back in time, I killed Hitler.\n\nIt was easy. I could pick any point in his life, even at the height of his power. Simply pop on by and shoot him in the head, strangle him in his sleep or the method I decided to go with: Help an assassin complete his job.\n\nIt was easy as pie. I simply gave a few tips to a man named Nikolaus von Halem about Hitlers plans the coming week and two days later a man named Beppo R\u00f6mer shot and killed Hitler in the autumn of 1939. I joined a celebration in London that evening and met the woman who would later become my wife.\n\nI decided to stop time traveling and settled with my wife in London where we raised a son and daughter. Tensions had been rising between the Allies and the Soviet Union during this time, but it looked to me like the inevitable Cold War was starting as before, only this time without the deaths of tens of millions of people following the Second World War.\n\nGermany was split between the east and west and I was sure that while my actions hadn't radically changed history at least I had prevented mass killings, the atomic bomb had not been used on Japan who had capitulated shortly after fall of Germany once the Allied forced had changed their focus on them.\n\nEverything was going well until one day I heard the chilling sound of air raid sirens. My wife and I rushed our family to the nearest bomb shelter, but it was too late. I was knocked unconscious and woke up to a sight I had never imagined. Dust and rubble everywhere, fires, everything was dark and gray. My children and wife were dead. A building had fallen on them.\n\nI instantly knew what had happened. I did this. I changed history and now my family was dead. I used my old invention I had swore to never again touch. I tried hundreds of ways to stop the impending disaster, but no matter what I did I could not save my family, I could not stop nuclear war. Every path, every change led to the same result. A world without Hitler it seemed was a world where no one could live.\n\nI had tried for years to find a solution when I finally made the decision to save one of the worst people in history and kill 60 million others to save the rest of humanity.\n\nI went back in time, I intervened with Beppo R\u00f6mers plans so he was arrested. Hitler saved and history restored. I was in my late 40ies now, at least that's what I think. It's hard to tell the passing of time when you live outside it. I couldn't go back to my old life. My wife was in her early 20ies at this point, I was twice her age.\n\nI made the decision to go back to my own time, back to before my time travel antics during the mid 21st century. A simpler more linear time. What I intended to be my travel back to my old town however turned out to be something else entirely. I was in a dead forest. I was sure I had the right coordinates, but my town simply wasn't here. I traveled back to London to see what was going on, and all I saw was again rubble and ruins. The nuclear war had happened regardless.\n\nI had done something wrong or changed something else. So I traveled back to 1945 and to my surprise Hitler had not died recently, but in a mysterious assassination plot. Perhaps this was a butterfly effect of my previous actions, something I did made history change in some minor way and an assassination was successful.\n\nI went back to a day a few hours before his death which now was in 1937. It was in the middle of the night, in his bedroom. I stayed in the corner, silent and invisible and simply watched. Then something familiar happened. A time traveler popped into view. Exactly how my invention worked. He walked over to Hitler when I told him to stop. He turned around and I shot him.\n\nI returned to 1945 to again read up on Hitlers final end. This time I couldn't even find an article about it. After a ton of research I figured out a German soldier had died in 1916 during the battle of the Somme. Somehow my time travel technology was being used by others to go back in time and kill Hitler.\n\nThis went on and on for years. Someone killed Hitler, I found out where, when and how and went back and saved him. Sometimes it was easy, sometimes it was hard. I once spent a whole year tracking him as a child when all I could find was the year of his death. Once he was slowly poisoned over a period of 3 years which was a really hard nut to crack.\n\nEventually though, all plans to kill Hitler was stopped short and the traveler dealt with. History preserved and nuclear holocaust averted.\n\nThen one day when going back to 1945 to see how the war went I was surprised not only that the war hadn't happened, but that Hitler himself was alive and well. He was a painter! Not just a mediocre painter either, he was world famous. He had his own gallery in London and I visited him.\n\nHe was a charming, welcoming man with a family and several children. His studio had a ton of paintings and his life was dedicated to his family and his work. He had never enlisted for the army, never had any fascist views, but he did tell me about his old mentor he met when he was 21. A man with amazing talent for painting who taught him how to perfect his art and be the best person he could be.\n\nThis was something new to me. Rather than kill Hitler it seemed someone went back in time and set his life on a different path. Perhaps this would change things, perhaps this was the cosmic event that could both stop World War II and save the planet from Nuclear War!\n\nAs it turns out however, that was not the case. A quick trip to the future proved as much.\n\nI went back to 1910, found Hitler and his mentor. I could not believe my eyes when I saw who it was! Bob Ross the famous painter from that old TV show I used to watch. Afro and all.\n\nI introduced myself to the two men. There was simply no way I was ever going to kill Bob Ross!\n\nI told my story about how I had been keeping Hitler alive. And to my surprise, Hitler himself wasn't phased by this at all.\n\nHe told me he had been fighting off time travelers since he was a teenager. They usually bolt when he points a gun at them, but some had suffered worse. He had grown to hate the World for this and wanted revenge, until one day Bob came into his life and changed everything. He had come to realize that the path he was on would lead to ruin and horror and so his life was turned around.\n\nI finally told him about what would happen if he didn't follow his old destiny, about how the World would burn if he didn't do the horrible deeds he had originally done. I took them both to the future they created and showed them the destruction.\n\nIt was Hitler himself that suggested the solution. Him, Bob and I would work together to bring Hitler to power, create The Third Reich and set it and themselves up for destruction in 1945. I would make sure no more time travelers tried their luck, Bob would make sure history was preserved, the right nations invaded, the key decisions made and Hitler would play his role of the most wretched man in history.\n\n\n\n\n-------\nIf you read this I'd love to get some feedback! Thanks, I hope you enjoyed it.\n",

Hitler, tired of all these time traveling assassins, was on the verge of deciding to quit painting. If his painting really brought this many people pain, then why would he continue.\n\nThe door flies open, \"Hi, I am Bob Ross and I welcome you to the joy of painting\" as Bob runs into Hitlers home.\n\n\"Yoouuu are not here to kill me?\" Hitler stuttered.\n\n\"Why would I do that\" Bob replied \"I am here to show you the peace and love that painting can bring to the world\"\n\nFor the next few month, Bob sat down with Hitler and showed him the joy of painting. Hitler has never seen so much kindness, he started to find the love in life.\n\nOne rainy afternoon a flash came outside Hitlers window, the door flung open and a man dashed into the room yelling \"Death to Hitler\". He pulled out a gun and fired it at Hitler with no hesitation. The room darkened, the man yelling \"I did it, I killed Hitl...\" he was interrupted by a gunshot. A flash of lighting lit up the room, the man dropped to his knees, clenching his chest where he was just shot. He stared across the room to see Hitler, on his knees, holding Bob in one arm and a gun in the other. \n\n\"Why would you kill him, why would you take my joy away\" Hitler yelled.\n\nThe assassin, shocked, replied \"No, I was here to end your life before you destroyed the world. You were supposed to be the one that died, I was going to prevent the evil you brought upon this world.\"\n\nHitler lays BoB Ross' body on the ground and slowly walks over to the assassin.\n\n\"Why does everyone want me to be evil?\" Hitler yelled \"If you want me to be evil, so be it\". Hitlers gun fires off, the assassins body hits the floor, the Star of David falling out of his pocket.\n\nThe door of Hitlers house flies open, a Hitler with a long black rain coat walks out, a flash of lightning lights up Hitlers face, eyes cold as ice, as if all his emotion had vanished. The Star of David clenched in his hand so tight that blood was seeping out.\n\nThus the day Hitlers Joy died.",

            "comment": "Adolf woke. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure what had awakened him, but he found himself staring at the shadowy ceiling of his tiny flat just the same.  It was quiet \u2013 so quiet that he was sure neither dawn nor dusk were anywhere close at hand \u2013 and yet, still he was awake. More awake, in fact, than he had felt in years. He shivered beneath his blanket despite the warmth, and lit a candle. \n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He asked the darkness. It felt right, he thought, to speak like this into the night. He could feel eyes on him, even if he wasn\u2019t sure anyone was really there. If he was wrong, no one would be the wiser. But if he was right\u2026\n\nHitler gasped as a hooded figure rose from the darkness at the foot of his bed, growing like a shadow at dusk. He clutched the covers closer to his chest. \n\n\u201cWhat are you!?\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cSome specter? Are you some devil, come to steal the breath from my lungs and soul from my flesh? Show yourself!\u201d \n\nTo his surprise, the figure stopped, holding up a finger as if to ask for a moment while he fumbled with his hood. It seemed to bulge oddly, as if it were caught on something, but eventually he pulled it free. \n\nIt was simply a man.\n\n\u201cSorry. Must have\u2026slipped? Never did like these cloaks.\u201d The figure said in halting German. He flashed Adolf a sheepish smile, and despite himself the pajama-clad man felt himself begin to smile as well. There was something about him, about the way he looked just a bit embarrassed beneath his disheveled bush of hair that was endearing. Despite that, however, he wasn\u2019t ready to relax just yet. \n\n\u201cWho\u2026who are you? Why have you come here into my bedchambers so rudely, and without invitation?\u201d Adolf asked. \n\nAgain, the man smiled. \u201cOh\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019m anyone that special.\u201d He said. \u201cJust a\u2026teacher? Is that the word? I work with paint, and I thought\u2026you might enjoy getting to paint, a bit.\u201d \n\nHitler blinked. \u201cI\u2026well, yes. I consider myself quite the expert, if I do say so. But why have you come? Are you from the school? You are no one I recognize.\u201d He looked the man up and down, and was struck by how odd he looked with his black cloak and his fuzzy head. It reminded him of something, though he couldn\u2019t quite put a finger on what it was.\n\n\u201cWell, no, not from the school exactly.\u201d The strange man said. \u201cI am\u2026from far away? The others, they have\u2026sealed this time off, yes? So no one else can come. You are rather unpopular, where I come from. Many have sought your life, though we have stopped them all\u2026will have stopped them? You even stopped a few yourself, I think.\u201d \n\n\u201cStopped? My life?\u201d Adolf asked, frowning. \u201cI have no recollection of this. Why do they seek to kill me? I have done no wrong to warrant it, at least in memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, well\u2026it\u2019s all a bit complicated. Harder, too, in German. I cannot explain. Regardless, I was sent here as\u2026an apology. For things that haven\u2019t, and will never happen. For my rudeness, I also apologize. Now was the only time I could come. It was the earliest we could reach before they started coming. Now, I must ask again\u2026would you paint with me?\u201d \n\n\u201c*Pinsel!*\u201d Hitler exclaimed. \u201c*Ein pinsel*! I knew you looked like something! Yes, Mr. Pinsel, I will paint with you. If only because this is clearly a dream, and I have quite the love of painting.\u201d \n\nThe man smiled. From somewhere within his cloak \u2013 where, Hitler couldn\u2019t imagine, as it was rather tight\u2013 he withdrew a pair of easels, complete with canvas, paint, and brushes. \n\n\u201cVery well!\u201d He said. \u201cLet us paint!\u201d \n\nAnd so they did. \n\nThe hours fled before their strokes, each of them trying to outdo the other in painting after painting. Hitler was surprised \u2013 though this man was clearly not German, he was still very, very good. Better, indeed, than Hitler himself, though he didn\u2019t want to admit it. But never once did he flaunt his superiority. Indeed, he made fun of his own imperfections, laughing and turning them into a beauty the likes of which Hitler had to admire. \u201cThere are no mistakes.\u201d He explained. \u201cMerely\u2026accidents. Happy accidents.\u201d \n\nThe man, too, was surprised at Adolf. In the history books, all they ever spoke of was the hatred, the atrocities. The monster. Instead, what he found before him was a man. A man like himself, filled with laughter and art and pain and joy and sorrow. Perhaps that was even more frightening than the beast. \n\nBut soon, the sky outside the window turned from black to gray, and the candle burned low in its stand. \n\n\u201cAlas, Adolf, our time grows short.\u201d The man said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I will need to be leaving soon.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh! You speak truth, Mr. Pinsel. I forgot the hour! Though I am still not sure whether you were real or not, our time together was quite enjoyable. I hope that you come to visit again. Perhaps there is a thing or two I could learn.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes. I think\u2026I think that would be nice.\u201d The cloaked man said, smiling sadly. \u201cGoodbye, Adolf. Good luck with your painting. I hope it brings you much joy, even when times are bleakest.\u201d He offered a hand.\n\n\u201cAnd you as well, my friend.\u201d Adolf replied. He grasped his hand, and was shocked to find a needle in his palm. At once, Hitler began to fall, only to be caught and dropped gently into bed by the cloaked stranger. \n\nThe man shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can call the mistakes you are going to make happy, Adolf, but you deserve the chance to make them. That\u2019s only right.\u201d \n\nWith a whirl of his cloak, Mr. Pinsel was gone, leaving nothing behind but a single canvas and a few drops of paint on the future tyrant\u2019s bedclothes. \n",

            "comment": "Bob picked up his three inch brush.  Adolf looked on curiously as he didn't know what it was to be used for.  Bob had painted big white clouds in a sky of deep phthalo blue.  It wasn't the best looking sky, but it was still impressive.  He couldn't imagine what Bob would use a three inch brush for, considering the painting to be done.\n\nBob saw the confusion in Adolf's eyes.  He explained, \"I'm just gonna dip the brush in odorless thinner, shake off any excess, and then...\"\n\nIn that moment Bob started smacking the brush back and forth on the leg of his easel.  His hair jiggling as if it was one piece instead of thousands of little curls.  He stopped, looked up at young Adolf, with a smirking mouth and a twinkle in his eye, he chuckled, \"And you just beat the devil out of it.\"\n\nAdolf felt more confused than before.  He was learning to paint, how ever would odorless paint thinner be used.  Surely it would ruin an otherwise finely painted sky of clouds.  Bob instructed, \"All you do is lightly brush all these little clouds.\"\n\nAs Bob brushed, Adolf could see what was happening.  The cloud, lifeless before, began to come alive with motion.  Wisps of titanium white and phthalo blue began to blend into swirls of wind.  A smile came across the eager student's face.  He began the process himself, feeling a new found exuberance for painting, realizing that within his easel he could travel to any place he could imagine, and create  lands so beautiful that people would long to go there.\n\nNow, thirty-two years later, Adolf looked on as the chamber filled with gas.  The vapors looked of titanium white and Indian yellow through the small round viewing window in the chamber door.  The screams began.  And a tear rolled down his cheek as he remembered the broken promise to a man who gave him a gift greater than any treasure.  The gift of imagination.",

            "comment": "On November 23, 1924, wearing a prisoner's uniform and an enviable afro, a new inmate appeared in a cell of Landsberg Prison. As he did, a rush of displaced air made a subtle *sprap* and woke the sleeping someday-dictator.\n\n\"Well, hi there,\" the new arrival said in German.\n\n\"Who are you?!\" said Hitler.\n\n\"I'm Bob Ross.\"\n\n\"The fuck is a Bob Ross?\" said the future killer of like a bajillion people just for no reason at all. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"Adolf, right? I brought a paint set,\" Ross said, indicating a bag of art supplies. \"Thought we could see what kind of nice things we can discover together. I bet it's been a while.\"\n\n\"How do you know my name? How do you know I paint?\"\n\n\"Well, it's a neat little story. Some folks I'd never met popped in on me and asked for my help, and what do you know, they sent me to you,\" began the curly-headed man.\n\n\"Have you come to release me from here? To unleash the Third Reich? Who sent you?\" \n\n\"Oh, just this super bunch I've been enjoying getting to know. Wish you could meet 'em, really. Long story short, they came from the future, taught me German, and sent me along here. I heard you could use a friendly boost to get you painting again. It's awfully important you don't give up on yourself as an artist.\" He drifted a moment, eyes narrowed and distant. Soon they drifted back to the man who was the origin of the phrase *worse than Hitler.* The latter glowered.\n\n\"Anyway, they said they'd ought to linger back, didn't want to make too much of a splash, they'd tried it. Soooo anyway,\" he said, unpacking a paint set and easel, \"I figure we can just have a good ol' time paintin'. Might even help you get your groove back. Shall we?\"\n\nHe started by drawing his brush through some brilliant blue. Just a nice, bright blue for our sky. Meanwhile, the time travelers' hidden cameras rolled, collecting oodles of juicy footage for a tell-all VR film, \"The Essential Joy of Painting,\" slated for release in 2050. Just a lot of nice footage, just our little secret.\n\n\"Why should I? I've got more important things to do now,\" barked the host to several malignant thought-tumors, motioning with pen in hand. \"Humanity must be unshackled from mediocrity and awakened to its destiny! True patriots, proud whites, men who respect the real meaning of *Master Race,* must rise to our full potential--\"\n\n\"Well, now, let me pause you right there, friend. I've skittered through Mein Kampf and, no sirree, this here brush is the main thing you've got to master.\" He indicated an extra palette and brush he'd set aside.\n\n\"You think I would trade Utopia for some lost art school fantasy? I will ring in humanity's finest age.\"\n\nBob shrugged. \"Wellll, the truth might be a little too grim,\" he grinned, or grimaced. \"I figure we just jump right into the good stuff instead here.\" Sensing a pause, he let his pitch drop from sunny to serious, but he kept his smile. \n\n\"Look. Adolf. This is your fullest potential, right here. The future hangs in the balance. Now, I'll hand it to you -- you got gumption... one way or another, the world will remember you as a powerful leader. You're the one who decides where to lead. Will you take the art world into a new golden age, or the lead the whole world into a nasty war over -- pardon my potty talk -- a buncha grade A malarkey?\" Swishing his brush in nice circles, he made happy little clouds appear, just all over. Without another word, he waited for Hitler's reply.\n\nThe authoritarian fuckhole scratched his shitsmear moustache and frowned as he had since college, or thereabouts. He couldn't place why, but he actually wanted to believe this ethnically ambiguous stranger. He reached for the brush, then hesitated. \n\n\"How do I know I can trust in you? \nAre you not surely sent by some dusky Jew \nIn some tricky business, us whites to subdue?\nYou've done your digging on my fights in the future --\n\nMy greatest achievements, and you judge that my weakness \nMust be shame! or Fright? Or these overlong speeches!\nWith paints or with plights you'll distract me, that right?\nA cheap jewy trick to extinguish my light!\n\nYou've come to strike me a blow in the nuts \nBefore I take over, as we all know I must!\nBe gone with you, sneaky semitic old fuck!\nI bet you're a jew and a son of a slut!\" \n\nRoss took a deep breath and tightened his gut\nHe summoned his strength and he chewed on his tongue.\nEach utterance struck, the words really cut,\nBut in German, it didn't even rhyme once.\n\nBy the way, as they spoke, Bob's brush had been moving\nAnd mountains took shape, and the lake was improving.\nThe dread fuhrer's words hadn't lingered, it seems.\nThey say peace comes swift to a painter of dreams.\n\n\"I know that it's tough,\" Said Bob, dipping his brush,\n\"But one thing you learn from the canvas is trust.\nTrust me, it's more than a brush you pick up --\nIt's knowing you, too, can paint beautiful stuff.\n\nYou're new, but I'll tell you a secret: you're enough.\nYou just have to know where your health comes from.\nIf I didn't paint, well, I'd be -- pardon my tongue --\na patoot, a real jim-dandy son of a gun. \n\nBut I'm just as pleased as a person can be.\nSee, I paint every day, but enough about me. \nI'm just a guy too. So let's just have some fun,\"\nAnd Bob finished with a flourish. Adolf was stunned.\n\nHe sat, and he faltered, and took in those words\nAnd noticed Bob's work made his own look like turds.\nHe wanted so badly to lay brush to canvas\nBut art school admins wouldn't let him on campus.\n\n\"But what if they laugh?\" Adolf said just after, \nAnd suddenly started to cry.\nHis own tears, even to blitzkrieg's crafter, \nWere clearly a surprise.\n\nBob cleared his throat, and almost spoke, \nAnd then sat down beside.\n\"I've been called an amateur painter, myself, \nAnd believe me. I wanted to die.\"\n\n\"It's scary getting back on, old boy,\nAnd starting again to ride.\nBut our legacy can be made of joy, \nAnd I think it will be this time.\n\nIt's not your skill that'll make you great, \nNor is it your pure bloodline.\nTake your brush through every hue of paint\nAnd here's what you'll find;\n\nPatience and love make you bolder than hate--\nThe power it wields is too blind.\nFacing the canvas is your better fate. \nIf you'll let me, I'll show you the good life.\"\n\nRoss shifted in front of the camera and smiled,\nAnd, looking in Hitler's eyes,\nSaid, \"How about learning the Joy of Painting?\"\nAnd Adolf said simply,\n\n\"I'll try.\"",

            "comment": "The sun has started its final descent of the day over the horizon. Its glistening glow laid a golden carpet on the Danube River. A flock of retiring birds imparted the final touches on a magnificent scene.\n\nThat is exactly what brought Adolf here, an aspiring painter who have had limited luck in jumpstarting his career. He spends hours studying his work and still can't understand the poor reception it has on his audience.  \"Adolf shows great potential, but his art lacks soul\", he remembered his last critic complaining. \"They are all just blind fools. Eventually, a real artist will recognize my works for the masterpieces they are\" a frustrated Adolf mumbled while scanning his nearly complete painting.\n\n\"Thats a lovely painting you have there\", a hooded figure remarked from behind Adolf. Having had quite a few narrow escapes from death, the sudden, although friendly sound spooked him to his feet. Noticing that the stranger to be of no threat, he let out a sigh of relief. It's not often that his work gets the appreciation it needs. \"Thank you, it's my best work yet\" Adolf said.\n\n\"Yet, it seems to be lacking something\" the hooded man pointed out. Adolf was no stranger to that statement, and he had no more patience for these art blind nuisances. \"If you are so good at painting, why don't you go ahead and fix it yourself, Old man!\" replied an angry Adolf. \n\n\"I didn't mean no offence, kind sire. I am a painter myself. Would you like some suggestions in improving your work?\" The stranger asked.\n\nAdolf was in no mood for more useless criticism, but something about the friendly stranger lowered his guard. \"Alright. I painted this scene exactly as I see it. It's like a magic tool printed it out on my canvas\" Adolf said.\n\n\"Like a photograph?\" asked the hooded stranger.\n\n\"A what?\" asked the perplexed Adolf having never heard of a photograph before.\n\n\"Never mind that. Tell me about the scene that you are drawing.\" The hooded figure asked pointing at the painting.\n\n\"It's a sunset by the Danube River.\" replied Adolf.\n\n\"They say a picture is a thousand words. You seem to be a few shy of that. A painting is only as good as how you express it, and not always through the canvas. How can you convince others of the beauty you behold if you yourself are not convinced\" the hooded stranger replied.\n\nAdolf took a moment to take a better look at his work to give a more verbose description, that is when he saw it. The color on the small portion of the rock felt off. He picked up his brush to correct it. And then he saw another, the water reflection wasn't quite right. The more he looked, the more he saw. He quickly got to work correcting them.  He saw what his critics saw. Maybe this painting would finally get him into a good art school.\n\n\"How does it look now?\" Adolf turned to the where the stranger was to get his feedback. But there was no one there. While he was busy on the canvas, the stranger slipped away. \"Didn't even bother to say goodbye.\" murmured Adolf as he noticed something on the ground. The stranger had dropped his wallet. He opened it to find out who he was. \n\nOn the left was a tiny realistic portrait of a person with a frizzy afro with a name tag that read \"Bob Ross\".",

            "comment": "Knock knock. Adolf cursed softly and thought not again, he was in the middle of drawing a beautiful stick figure walking amongst some roses. The flowers need work he thought, as he put down his crayons. He peeked out a window and saw a man with large curly hair standing politely at his door. Adolf had moved so many times just to get away from these strange people, dressed in outlandish clothes, he was beginning to think there was some kind of conspiracy against him. The first time someone interrupted his paint by numbers marathon. The guy just busted in his apartment brandishing a knife and swinging. Adolf took him out with a nearby brass table lamp and dumped him in a canal. The second and third time happened a day apart. One lady jumped him as he went out for his morning coffee, then a guy with a strange metallic body suit attempted to poke him with an electric handheld device. In both cases Adolf fought back well enough to run away and hide. Since then he has lost count how many people have tried to kill or harm him. \n\nThis was his fifth move in as many months, Adolf thought he was finally free. But no, some guy and his awful hair found him. Knock knock, he heard again. Adolf peeked out again and noticed the man was holding a painting easel, maybe this was a fellow painter he thought, probably noticed my monthly cartoon in Fascistbook. Adolf debated whether to let him in for about four seconds then realized he could use a friend. So he opened the door. \n\n\"Hi can I help you.\"\n\n\"Hello my friend, actually, I can help you\". \"I saw your cartoon in Fascistbook and gave them a visit, they said I could probably find you here.\" \n\nDamn, Adolf thought, I told those Semites not to publish my address. \"Well actually I was just in the middle drawing, but I suppose I could spare but a moment.\"\n\n\"Great! The name is Bob Ross. Mind if I bring my easel in?\"\n\nAdolf thought that was a bit presumptuous, what if he had been  painting with the smelly markers. He liked to draw a little mustachio on his upper lip with the licorice smelling ones and flex in the mirror topless. \"Sure why not, not like I have anything to do today.\" Nottt, he thought.\n\n\"Great then. Just be a chap and grab the other end, it's heavy,\" motioning with the easel. \n\nOMG thought Adolf, who does this guy think he is. But he grabbed the easel and walked in with Bob. \"Welcome to the abode Bob, can I get you a drink, schnapps, tea, a bit of arsenic.\" He mumbled the last part.\n\n\"No thanks a-dawg, I can't stay long.\" \"In fact, I can only stay for a few minutes, I just wanted to,\" Bob lifted up the easel, \"paint a happy sunset.\"\n\nAnd with that Bob swung the easel around and smashed Adolf in the head, splattering blood all over his stick figure and roses drawing. \"Ah, just a little bit of gentle red in the background, a quick smear here, and done, calmly observe your beautiful work of art.\"\n",

Exactly like that. You can do anything you want here, aaanything you want.\" The words echoed through his mind, haunting him. He saw the black-and-white horror of Auschwitz again, the very pictures they'd been shown in the Air Force. His own words captioned the horrors of the Holocaust. *\"You can do anything you want. This is your world.\"*\n\nThe back of the aspiring young artist before him shifted, shoulders rising and falling with eager brush strokes as Mr. Hitler brushed up a forest of magnificent spruce trees. Bob's grip on the paint knife tightened. Adolf seemed so full of life these days, so content with himself. There was a newfound light in him that Bob so loved to see -- it was what made him cherish teaching. It was the true Joy of Painting, to shed your worries and focus on the canvas, pouring yourself out for all of your world to see, whether it was millions on national television or simply your loved ones. There was such beauty in it, such beauty.\n\nCould he truly say he was better than this man? Bob still remembered the hateful and angry person he had once been. The Air Force had brought out the worst in him. He didn't deserve to be saved, yet he had found salvation in painting anyway. Who was he to deny another person this? Another living, breathing human being. And yet the stakes were too high.\n\nIn the end, that warrior Bob had once been had never truly died. He had simply stepped aside to let the painter flourish. Now that same warrior stepped forward, the paint knife steady in his hand, its surface glimmering titanium white. Adolf Hitler never saw it coming.\n\nA river of red danced down the landscape. It blinded Bob with tears. Even at a moment like this, there was beauty to be found on the canvas.",

            "comment": "A dreary day, the sky is blackened by clouds as though smothered by a swarm of ravens.  A dark room, a modest room by any means, with shelves of books and tables littered with various paints and brushes.  Torn canvases and splintered wood litter the floor, and in the darkened corner an easel stands guard over its fallen comrade.  Splattered throughout the room, alizarin crimson catches the candlelight faintly, like blood drying on the carpet.  A man lies in the corner, more red stains the carpet below him.  The silence screams, a storm is coming.\n\nAnother man stands surveying the scene he had wrought, his hands red with either paint or blood, he cannot tell the difference now.  The year is 1910, and the man's name is Adolf.  The man in the corner no longer has a name.  Adolf surveys the scene and looks to the remaining easel and his last canvas, a blue scene in the bottom half and an unmissable dark line marring the  center of the canvas, demarcating his progress when he was attacked. Yes, this man Adolf is a painter...\n\nNo...\n\nHe is a failure.\nThe young man steps over the carnage to reach his easel ready to dispose of his latest failure, when suddenly a man's voice shatters the void.\n\n\"How about we put a big ol' happy tree right here?\"\n\nAdolf whips around, knife already drawn and expecting an attack.  Maybe this time his luck would fail him and it would be the last.  To no surprise Adolf's eyes are immediately drawn to a shadowy figure in another darkened corner, though much to his surprise this figure is unlike his usual assailants.  While his usual assailants come garbed in bright strange clothing, the figure standing before him is simply hooded by a travel coat, much like the one Adolf himself would wear later if he lived long enough to go to the market to buy more canvas.\n\n\"But maybe we should give him a couple of little friends so he doesn't get lonely, and maybe above we'll put in a couple happy little clouds\"\n\nThe figure approaches Adolf and opens his cloak, and Adolf pivots to avoid the gun shot that would never come, as the man brings out his hands to produce a set of fresh brushes and a newly prepared palette of paint.\n\n\"I think this is already turning out to be a beautiful piece, it has so much potential, just like every one of us.\" The figure continues to intone as he brushes by a startled Adolf, approaching the canvas in the corner with a 2 inch brush already dipping in a dab of titanium white.\n\nThere Adolf stood in wonder as this mysterious man begins adding blobs of white to his last canvas, which suddenly brings out a burst of anger Adolf didn't think he had the energy left to muster.\n\n\"Leave this place at once! If you're not here to kill me, cease touching my work and leave me to fix my mistake before it fully dries!\" The young exhausted man shouts.\n\nThe hooded figure turns around and reaches up slowly to remove his hood as the rumblings of thunder denote the coming storm.\n\nCandlelight dimly illuminates the stranger's bared face.  A face with deep smile lines and large curly hair the likes of which young Adolf had never seen before.\n\n\"We don't make mistakes\"\n\nSays the figure, locking eyes with young Adolf and smiling sadly.\n\n\"We only have happy little accidents\" he finishes as lighting flashes to reveal a beautiful spruce pine on the shore of some placid and unnamed lake framed by a light blue sky and wispy clouds behind the strange, smiling man.  A new beginning.",

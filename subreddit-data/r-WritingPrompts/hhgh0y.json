            "comment": "When I finally staggered back home the next morning, the relief that I was home safe overrode my mother's anger at my disobedience. The same could not be said of my father. From inside my mother's embrace, I heard his familiar chastising tone of voice revving up. It was as if the act of telling me what to do made him more domineering. There was no cathartic release and reset, it just kept escalating until we were screaming at each other, and my mother had to intervene.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What the hell were you thinking, boy? You could have been discovered, you could have killed people! Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"NO!\", I shouted back. A familiar pattern despite the unfamiliar ground. \"No, I had no idea how dangerous it could be because you've never told me anything about who I am? Or is it how *we* are? Am I the freak, or are we all the Addams family realtors?\" I paused, partially for effect, and partially to admire how coolly I'd delivered that line. So far it had gone exactly how I'd rehearsed, as I'd been trapped in those 4 walls. Or as those 4 walls. To be honest, that part wasn't 100% clear to me. Then my Dad surprised me by tearing up my mental script. He sat down heavily with a huge sigh, like a bouncy castle when the pump is turned off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yeah\", he nodded. \"Yeah, that is true. How could you know? It's fucking ridiculous. I mean if you were a vampire or a werewolf or whatever at least you'd have pop culture to help you make sense of some it. But not this.\" He patted the sofa next to him. \"Come, sit down. I suppose it's time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat down. My mother went to put the kettle on. I might be a walking house, and at this point, she might be as well, as far as I knew, but a mother knew when it was time to make a cup of something hot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What do you mean dangerous, Dad? What am I going to do? Do we have asbestos?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe rolled his eyes. It was so normal I nearly pinched myself just to check this wasn't some ridiculous dream. \"Not as far as I know. Although I never had a surveyor inside me. So to speak.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed, as he knew I would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No, you are dangerous, because of the speed and power of the change. A werewolf might maim a human or two before it learns to lock itself away at Full Moon. You could crush people by the busload. If you are near another building, you will knock it aside. A skyscraper would fall.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laughed again. This time he was not so pleased. \"It's not a joke. I'm telling you. You could kill thousands if you change in the wrong place. The oldest handed down tale of our people is of the fall of Jericho. Human legend tells of the great shout and the power of God. The reality is that one of our kind was in the march around the walls. They marched for days and nights until the full moon came, and he smashed those impregnable walls aside like straw.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Dad. What are we?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I don't know, boy\", he said, deflating still further it seemed. My mother returned with two steaming cups of something. \"Thanks love\", he said as he took one. \"I don't know, and none of our people does for sure. Tomorrow we'll take you to see The Architect. She's the oldest of us, and she can tell you what limited parts we do know.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother patted my shoulder. \"You must be tired. The first change is awful on the mind. Did you have any animals move in?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shuddered at the thought of the small rodents I'd felt scurrying across my skin. Or inside my skin I supposed. I said nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Drink your tea\", she said knowingly, then brightened. \"Still, the good news is we think that we exist to shelter and protect something important. It's just we don't know what yet. But we don't set out to kill or convert or dominate like all the other changelings.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at her. \"Others? I thought the werewolves thing was another joke?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Tomorrow\", my father said firmly with a glare at my mother. \"For now, just rest. You need your strength. Learning The Foundations is a tough task and the Architect is not a forgiving teacher.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sipped my tea and tried not the think about where the rats went when I changed back.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf you like this, I keep all my stories here.

                    "comment": "PART 2\n\nThe ride downtown the next morning was a quiet one. I tried to lighten the mood a couple of times, with jokes about woodworm, and how my Dads thatched roof was looking increasingly sparse and got nothing back. They were both tense, and not because of the whole turning into a house thing,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be much better than last time, dear.\u201d My mother attempt to be reassuring got little more than a grim smile back from my father.\n\n\u201cWell it can\u2019t be much worse, can it. Jesus. I wanted time with the boy first. Give him the basics, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm. I\u2019m still here guys. If this undertone of panic is supposed to make me feel better, well, I have to say it\u2019s working pretty well actually. Cos now, I\u2019m more pissed off than worried!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry Micks, I really am. It's just\u2026 this is a lot. Your mum and me have been planning for how we would handle today for a long time. We thought we had a little longer before you\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut a deposit down? Broke earth? Abodified? Is there an actual word for turning into a house? I feel like I should probably know at least that before I meet the wise and ancient seer.\u201d\n\nMy mother laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d, I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\nDad only shook his head in reply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe office of the Architect turned out to be a small accounting firm in a business park, just outside of town. Not somewhere I\u2019d ever been, or even heard mentioned.\n\nA bell rang on the door as we entered. A low budget place that couldn\u2019t afford a full-time receptionist, and needed to call attention to anyone coming in. I looked quizzically at my mother as we stood in the empty waiting room. She shrugged. My Dad turned the \u2018Open\u2019 sign over on the door behind us, as a woman came to meet us. There was a long moment of silence. Long enough for me to shift awkwardly, under the even gaze of the pretty young receptionist.\n\n\u201cHello Anne\u201d, my mother spoke first. The girl broke into a smile, and I was lost. She was older than me, but not old enough to count me out of a chance, by my way of thinking. I affected my most nonchalant pose, as my mother and \u2018Anne\u2019 embraced.\n\nAs the clinch broke, I stepped forward. Like a man. With a sadly cracking voice on this occasion. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Mik. We are here to see the Architect. Can you take us to her? I\u2019m in a bit of hurry to find out what\u2019s going on\u201d.\n\n\u201cMikdash Halpert I presume. And apparently you have taken your judgement in people and situations from your father.\u201d She looked over my shoulder at the cringing shadow of a man behind me, with a glare. \u201cI presume since you are here to see me, that things must have gone wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Mik. Wait, you\u2019re the ancient seer?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour full name is Mikdash. It means Sanctuary. I chose it myself when you were born into our world. And yes, I am the Architect, as our people have chosen to name me. You were expecting something else?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I thought\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI would probably cut that down to a minimum if I were you, young man, based on the knowledge I have of men in your family. Given you know of our changing, is my appearance really unexpected? A well-maintained structure can last many many years, and I do so pride myself on my maintenance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBotox or repointing for the cracks?\u201d I muttered.\n\n\u201cHmm. Quicker than he was at least.\u201d Another glare behind me then she turned at walked back into the office. No instruction to follow, but follow we all did without hesitation.\n\n*\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d,*  I mouthed at my Dad as we followed her. He flushed and waved his hand vaguely at me.\n\n*\u201cSame thing?\u201d,* he replied.\n\n\u201cAnd didn\u2019t warn me?!\u201d, I asked out loud.\n\n*\u201cShhhhh\u201d* admonished my mother. \u201c*If you two have quite finished embarrassing me. Honestly Mik, I didn\u2019t warn you because I thought your attitude to women would be a bit better. Your father grew up in the 1800\u2019s. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d*\n\nI sheepishly trooped into Anne\u2019s office and sat where I was bidden. I tried not to sulk. Unsuccessfully, my mother would tell me later.\n\n\u201cNow\u201d, said Anne from behind a small cheap Ikea desk. \u201cI suppose you would like to know what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a Linnmon?\u201d, I asked, pointing to the desk.\n\nMy mother punched me in the arm. \u201cMikkey!\u201d\n\nI held a hand up in apology. \u201cSorry, serious question. Should I call you Anne? Or the Architect? I felt like The Architect had a lot more gravitas, but to be honest, I\u2019m pretty off balance right now, and when I feel out of control I ramble and make jokes and sometimes that is unhelpful. How old are you? Cos I think my mum just said my 42-year-old father is like 200 years old, and earlier we were talking about Jericho, and stuff. So. Yeah.\u201d I tailed off.\n\n\u201cYou may call me Anne because that is my name. Your father is 186 years old. I am closing in on 1000 years old. A lady never gives her real ages, but you can assume I look fantastic for whatever the number is. And before you ask, yes, you are actually 16 years old.\u201d\n\nI mouthed nothing, so she continued.\n\n\u201cFor obvious reasons, we can\u2019t have a huge amount of written records, so like all the changelings, we really on oral history. That is my role in our community.\u201d\n\nMy mother kicked me before the smirk about her oral skills could turn into another black mark on the family name. Anne either didn\u2019t notice or liked my mother enough to let it slide.\n\n\u201cWe call that oral tradition, The Foundations\u201d, The Architect continued. \u201cAll of us must learn it by heart before we change. It is crucial to understand the dangers and the power that comes with it. But it appears you have skipped straight to building without consulting an architect. And let me tell you, those buildings do rather tend to collapse.\u201d\n\nShe dismissed my parents with a wave. \u201cLeave us, now. We will begin at once.\u201d\n\nMy Dad gave me a flat smile that had probably started life as encouraging but had made some bad choices on its way to being at a pretty low point. The squeeze of my shoulder from my mother was somehow more worrying. This was serious business.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning\u201d, she began, \u201cthere was the dark. People made light in the dark, and things were attracted to the light, as things always are in the dark. We arose to protect the people, and their light.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat things?\u201d, I interrupted.\n\n\u201cDO NOT INTERUPT ME, CHILD!\u201d Anne shouted, and not even the Linnmon desk could disguise the 900+ years of fury in her tone. I suddenly felt very small.\n\n\u201cI will recount the history of our people. Not all of it is understood. Some we have forgotten, some will be filled in later in the recital. But you will not interrupt me again or you will need an RSJ putting in while they repair the hole I will knock into your impertinent head.\u201d\n\nShe began to speak. I remained silent. It was nightfall before I spoke again.",

Apparently I\u2019d leant forward for a pretty significant chunk of time. She really was a good storyteller. Despite the gaps and jumps through time, inconsistencies, and blind alleys there was a thread that stayed throughout. Protection. It was just not 100% clear what exactly they protected and from what.\n\nI rubbed my back absentmindedly, and closed my eyes for a moment, to try and think of what the hell I was supposed to say now. Even after speaking for hours though, it was Anne who broke the silence.\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d, she said. \n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor listening fully. It\u2019s easy to just allow sound to pass over you. Most do by the end of the first hour or so. It takes practice to enter the trancelike state you need to remember the Foundations, and you seemed to find your way there on your own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way I can remember all that. However I listen.\u201d\n\nAnne stood, and wordlessly indicated I should follow her. Again, I did without a pause beyond that caused by my protesting hip joints after that amount of time immobilized. I didn\u2019t hear them whinging about it after I\u2019d be a cabin for a whole night, but I guess they weren\u2019t there. We left the office and started to walk towards town. \n\n\u201cAnne, I live a pretty long way away. Should we get like an Uber or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cMikdash, my poor boy. We have no need to walk. I am going to teach you how to fly like an eagle.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t contain my excitement. \u201cWhat. The. FUCK! Are you serious!\u201d\n\nShe laughed a high shrill laugh. It would be grating if it wasn\u2019t so exquisitely musical. If anything I was more surprised by this sudden unprecedented display of humor than I was by the revelation.\n\n\u201cNo. No, of course I\u2019m not serious. I\u2019ve got a Volvo parked out behind the office. I just thought you could do with a walk. I certainly do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit of dick move, dude\u201d, I said, forgetting I was talking to a 900-year-old seer. Fortunately, she laughed that delicate laugh again. In the quiet of the evening, the sustain on the last note was like a ringing bell.\n\n\u201cYes. I suppose it was\u201d, she said with a smile. \u201cIs there anything you want to ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. How can our people be that old, and turn into modern buildings? I was a cabin, sure, but with lights and heating and stuff. What do you turn into?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never really turn into a cabin. You turn into a sanctuary. Your being is a pure place of safety. Outside even time itself. The rest is just a skin or a glamour. It makes sense based on your surroundings. If you were in a Norse settlement, you might be a longhouse. If you were here, you might be a plain storage locker. If you were in the hills of Japan, a Pagoda. Do you get the idea? We think that once we may have taken the form of caves. I normally choose to be somewhere beautiful before a change. Appropriate setting, obviously.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the rats and stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, never inside you. They will have been more confused than you probably to find themselves suddenly dumped on the ground when you changed back. But then, of course, you\u2019d have to try and act natural as I keep talking and don\u2019t frown at me or anything, OK?\u201d\n\nAnne smiled and laughed a completely different laugh, as she took my arm in hers like we were a couple on a stroll. The hairs on the back of my arms stood up as she subtly started to guide me as we walked.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about the possibility they were watching us\u201d, she continued. \u201cWe are going to keep walking, and just loop back to the office.\u201d\n\nI pulled out my phone and made a show of checking the time. \u201cWho is watching us?\u201d, I chuckled to Anne, trying to play along. \u201cDo I need to call the cops?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the police will not be of help here. I wouldn\u2019t drag a poor defenseless human out to deal with a Wolf. It would be as bad as killing the man myself.\u201d\n\nWe turned left down a side street casually, beginning to loop back. \u201cA Wolf? Like a Werewolf? But the full moon has already passed? What are you worried about?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Wolves can change at will except at the full moon. Then it is unavoidable. But the rest of the time it is a choice.\u201d\n\nI glanced back over my shoulder and saw just a few figures. A local drunk, a couple of college looking kids, and an old lady. \u201cThere\u2019s no wolf there, Anne. What are we running from?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see the lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was like 80! I mean, I know that\u2019s young to you, but I\u2019m pretty sure we can take her.\u201d I laughed, for real this time. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look anything like a wolf.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t. Unless I was especially scared of wolves. And I am not. I have killed many of their kind. Their wolf form is pointless against me. They, like us, shape their external image to fit. The core of their being is still the same. They take the form that brings fear to their pray. We don\u2019t know why. They could kill quickly, but they choose not to. In the old world the howl, the sight of the wolf did that, and the Wolf moniker stuck. But they are no more wolves than you are a log cabin.\u201d\n\nI walked in silence for a moment. \u201cYou are scared of 80-year-old women?\u201d\n\nAnne whirled on me. \u201cYOU DON\u2019T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME!\u201d\n\nI held my hands up. \u201cIs this helping us get away?\n\nThe Architect straightened her hair. \u201cPossibly. Yes. No-one would be stupid enough to do this in sight of a wolf, so it does help sell the story we\u2019ve not seen it. Now, come. Or this theory lesson might end up getting very bloodily practical.\u201d",

And second of all, why do we want to beware it?\"\n\nLenny shrugged. \"Who knows?\"\n\n\"So this doesn't give you creepy vibes at all?\" Carly asked. \"This much random manufacturing goods, stored in the middle of nowhere?\"\n\n\"It's not *that* middle of nowhere.\" Lenny began investigating, peering into some of the boxes and crates. \"I hear there's a family that lives around these parts.\"\n\n\"What! Len, they probably own the damn place! We gotta split before, like, an alarm goes off.\"\n\n\"Relax,\" he said, running his fingers through a barrel of washers. \"It's like, 5 am. No one's gonna come all the way out here just for-\"\n\nThen the building gave a mighty groan. Not like metal straining or creaking. A groan like a person, but massive, echoing around the upper rafters of the log house.\n\n\"Whyyyyy are you in here,\" the voice moaned. \"Why are you inside of me.\"\n\nCarly screamed and turned to run, only to smack face-first into a pile of sheet metal and fell, eyes distant and dizzy.\n\nLenny was less concerned. \"Alright alright, we get it, you got speakers in here to scare off intruders. We're leaving! Just thought it was weird to find a building in here, that's al-\"\n\n\"Noooooo,\" wailed the house. \"You must leave!\"\n\n\"We're trying. Just gotta help my friend-\"\n\n\"The sun rises.\"\n\nLenny looked out the window to find the cheerful little orb of light rising over a nearby hill. For a moment his concern melted.\n\nThen he felt a drip from the ceiling. It looked like mucus. Then another. This one was blood.\n\n\"GET OUT!\"\n\nLenny grabbed the dazed Carly and began to run. As he did, the floor underneath him seemed to flood with more sticky fluid. Then he realized it was shifting, changing under his feet. It looked like skin. The interior of skin.\n\n\"Carly, I need you to wake up,\" he panted. \"The building, the stupid warehouse, it's changing. We have to get out.\"\n\n\"Mergle,\" she mumbled. \"Don't feel good.\"\n\nHe looked up to see if anything more was about to drip on him, only to find the ceiling had gotten lower. The whole building was shrinking.\n\n\"Well we're gonna die if you don't get up now.\"\n\nAnother drip of something gooey and organic landed on her face, and this did a lot to shake her out of her daze.\n\n\"Fuck, Len!\" she screamed. \"We gotta go!\"\n\n\"Yes you dooooooo,\" cried the house.\n\nIt took them another terrifying minute to find the exit, a slowly shrinking door with sharp white rocks above and below. The rocks hadn't been there before and they were growing longer as the door shrank.\n\n\"Run for it!\" Lenny shouted.\n\nCarly went first, crawling through the hole. By the time Lenny got there, the building was the size of a small closet. He almost got stuck and could feel the white rocks dig into his legs as he slipped them out, just in time, leaving only a shoe inside the building.\n\nHe fell to the ground, panting and shaking while Carly whimpered slowly.\n\n\"I guess that's why the man told us to beware. Why would someone even store their wares in a building like that?\"\n\n\"Not THAT kind of warehouse!\" came a new voice behind them.\n\nThe pair turned around to find a kid, probably 16 or 17 standing there. His arms were crossed and he looked rather pissed. \"Jesus Christ,\" he said. \"A WEREHOUSE. Like were. Like a werewolf only-\" He stopped, a rather uncomfortable look on his face. Then he cough, burped, and spat up what could only be the remnants of Lenny's shoe.\n\n\"Uh...\" Lenny couldn't think of anything more intelligent to say.\n\n\"Just go,\" said the kid. \"Before I sic my parents on you.\"\n\n\"Are your parents also houses?\" asked Carly, voice a little high.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"They're werehumans.\"\n\nLenny frowned. \"So they only turn to humans on the full moon.\"\n\nThe kid narrowed his eyes. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"And they spend the rest of their time as... houses?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the kid. \"They're your more traditional wolf to human transformers. Which means you've got two very angry wolves prowling these woods, pissed at you for trespassing.\" Finally, after an entire conversation of glowering, he smiled. \"Better get running.\"\n___\nRead more stories at [r/TalesByOpheliaCyanide](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesByOpheliaCyanide/)",

            "comment": "Enough was enough. \n\nFor as long as Jalen could remember, his parents had barred his every attempt to escape the house on the night of a full moon, finding every possible means to keep him inside. Their house was set upon a little hill overlooking the town, with an excellent view of the great lake to their left. Jalen had always enjoyed watching the silvery face of the moon reflected in the glittering surface of glass-smooth water, but his visions of the moon were limited to merely those stolen glances through his half-open windows, which his mother would promptly close when she noticed it, drawing the curtains firmly across it. \n\nUntil tonight. It had cost him dearly, but he had finally managed to obtain the funds he needed to meet the price of his elder brother's help. He had no idea what Javari could possibly have done to distract them, but he didn't need to know. He had his ways. And besides, Jalen had much more important things to do.\n\nThe plan was to commence at midnight, and to his disbelieving delight, Jalen managed to slip, unnoticed, through the front door by 12:15. \n\nHe felt free at last; the wind whipped his hair as he streaked up the hill, determined not to face the moon until he had reached the peak of the hill, when he would have the best view.... And at last, he arrived. His chest heaving, sweat beading along his forehead, he turned.\n\nIt was beautiful: a celestial face of palest silver, gleaming brightly, a beacon against the murky black sky. He stood there for a moment, drinking it in, counting the craters, the blemishes upon the visage of perfection, smiling at the moon, which looked, he thought, as though it were smiling back at him \u2014\n\nAnd then pain seared across his body. Where a moment before he felt wonderfully calm and serene, now he was feeling agony like never before. It was as though flames were lapping at his flesh, as though his blood was freezing \u2014\n\nHis arms extended, his head widened, his chest broadened \u2014\n\nAnd after several seconds of excruciating anguish, the pain passed. He was staring down at the town again, from a much loftier position than before. His eyes seemed to be taking in much more of the scene than normal; he felt a peculiar sensation on his head, as though something were trickling out of it. \n\nHe tried to reach up to rub it, but nothing happened. *Wha* \u2014 he tried to say, but only a strange creaking noise issued from his mouth. He tried to look around, but instead of rolling around in his head, his eyes seemed to turn inwards, peering in at the back of his skull, but what he saw was not red or white.... It was brown. The mahogany brown interior of an old, empty log cabin. His eyes caught an old mirror in the corner, and he realized, with a rush of horror, that his eyes were gone \u2014 he was staring around through a pair of twinkling, glass-paned windows. He had *become* a house.\n\nHe heard panting from behind it, and his window-eyes shifted to face the front. Javari and his parents were rushing towards him. \n\n\"Oh, Jalen,\" his mother said sadly, clutching at her heart. \"Why did you leave the house?\"\n\n*What's going on*? he asked, but the only thing that happened was that the front door, which he supposed was his mouth, only swung backwards and forwards. \n\n\"Son,\" his father said grimly, \"it's time you learned of our family's secret.\"\n\nr/MysticScribbles",

            "comment": "The first time, the pain was unbearable. The cracking sound of my bones belied the grotesque elongating of my arms, the bark scaling down my shoulders as I hunched down under the silvery light of the moon. The first time, I screamed in helpless terror as I slowly found myself rooted in place in the clearing in the woods, unable to run or hide or move. I didn\u2019t know what I was, I couldn\u2019t even see. I could feel the sturdiness, the huge empty cavern of my body, bent over in an impossible stoop, contorted beyond comprehension.\n\nBut then, there was peace.\n\nFor so long, I had worried about being outside during the full moon. My parents tried to show me that they loved me in other ways, of course, but I always felt a little bit like a monster. An outcast. They meant well, but every month when I saw them carrying the blackout curtains, the handcuffs, and blindfold out of the basement, I felt a pit in my stomach that their reassurances of \u201cwe just want the best for you\u201d couldn\u2019t even shake. I suppose they didn\u2019t know what kind of were-person I was, and I understood that they had to take precautions in case I had been a ferocious animal. I always thought that I would be something that others needed protection from. We had never considered that I could be the protector itself.\n\nThey had grown lazy. One night, the blindfold had been too loose and slipped off my face. That\u2019s when I learned that they no longer babysat me all night like they used to in my childhood. Wriggling out of the shackles was relatively simple, and then, I was sprinting for the woods behind my house. After a couple months, I had it timed perfectly; once I felt the moonlight on my body, I had exactly eight minutes and nineteen seconds before I was firmly rooted in place.\n\nI thought of my parents often while I was out in the woods, under the serene moonlight, austere and immobilized of my own free will, thinking about how proud they might be, watching me lend my body for the shelter of a bedraggled fox, for the temporary respite of a tired bear, for the birthing grounds of a particularly plucky cat. There were nights where I could feel each droplet of rain ricocheting off my rugged back or snaking down the folds of the interlocked surface of my arms, or felt the way my body wouldn\u2019t bend to even the strongest wind. This time every month I had all to myself, to savor the precious glimpses of life that I helped nurture and protect, a time where I could rest and fully trust my unyielding body to protect me and those within.\n\nIt was rare, but sometimes, people would find me, campers walking around my rooted body in wonder, exclaiming in surprise at my pristine condition. Today was no different. They made a camp within, and when they drifted off, I, too, began to doze. Another tranquil full moon, where I could offer someone a bit of shared respite from the elements, from the onslaught of paranoia and fear that my parents had taught me was the norm.\n\nBut when I woke up, something felt wrong. I couldn\u2019t tell what time it yet was, but I could feel my arms and legs tingling, the way they do if you fall asleep resting on them funny. I tried to move, but still could not; it must not yet have been morning. And yet, the pain was growing, a searing, white hot pain that crept up towards my chest. I could not see. I could not scream. I could feel the campers scrambling about within, pounding on the doors frantically, muffled, awful sounds I could barely hear. And then, I could smell it\u2014the acrid tang of burning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFire.",

            "comment": "Gregor grinned to himself as the full moon shone in the sky above him. The three fat townspeople that he had been chasing through the forest had finally stopped running. They were hiding inside some sort of cabin, praying and weeping in fear. Gregor snickered to himself. Did they really think they would be safe in there? Letting out a loud howl, he charged at the cabin and flung himself at one of the windows ... only to find himself being painfully flung backward as a pair of wooden window shutters suddenly slammed into his face. The werewolf snarled in confusion as he picked himself back up. At first, he thought one of the townsfolk had gotten a lucky hit on him. Then, all of the windows around the cabin suddenly slammed shut in unison. Gregor's eyes narrowed as he realized what was happening. So, this was a werehouse. He had heard of these kinds of creatures before, though this was his first time encountering one during a hunt. He felt rage building up inside him. To think that such a pathetic creature, a joke of nature, would dare to get between him and his prey...\n\nHe let out a deafening roar as a massive gust of wind came out of his throat and slammed against the werehouse. The windows and doors rattled, but held firm for the most part. However, one shutter came loose in the chaos. Gregor grinned as he smashed his way through the open window before it could close. He took a deep breath through his nose, smelling the scent of his prey upstairs. Within seconds, he was bounding up the stairs two at a time, his heart roaring with triumph as the three townspeople above screamed in terror.\n\nSuddenly, without warning, the stairs collapsed beneath him. Gregor let out a scream of agony as he crash landed onto a pile of broken wooden splinters. He hissed in rage and slowly rose to his feet as he took note of what had happened. What was left of the stairs was drenched in blood, not all of it his. This was the damn werehouse's doing. For the first time that night, fear entered his mind. Just then, a loud booming series of voices echoed throughout the werehouse. All over the ceiling, mouths had appeared in the woodwork, all saying the same thing: \"I can only hope that hurt you more than it hurt me. Now, leave or die.\"\n\nThe bottom floor lurched as it began spinning faster and faster. Gregor drove his claws into the bloody floor, screeching as he fought to hold his ground. Suddenly, something slammed into him from behind. In shock, Gregor gazed behind him for the first time. All of the shelves full of trash and various clutter were emerging from the darkness, slamming into Gregor at full speed. Worse, above him, lamps were crashing down in a downpour of broken glass. Gregor screamed in panic as he found himself leaping through the madness and chaos of the rampaging furniture, desperate to find an escape. Putting all of his energy into one loud final roar, he blew a massive gale of wind from his mouth, blowing away everything in his way as he fought his way through the open werehouse door. As he fled into the forest in terror, limping and bleeding from several dozen cuts and bruises, he heard one last shout from the terrifying house he had ran from: \"And don't you dare come back!\"",

He accidentally pushes it too far with his weight and falls over.  It doesn't hurt him but it surprises him and he cries.  His mother rushes over to him.  \"It's okay, Kevin,\" she coos.*\n\nI shut the flaps back down and the images fade.  I felt disoriented at how vivid this mini-story had come at me.\n\nDid the box cause that vision?  It had begun when I opened the box and stopped when I shut it, which would suggest it was a radical coincidence of timing if the box weren't involved.\n\nOnly way to test this theory was if I opened another box, so I did.\n\n*\"We're blood brothers,\" Kevin's friend Mike said as he handed Kevin a knife.  Mike had already cut his finger and smeared a few drops of blood on the blade.  Now it's Kevin's turn.  Kevin cautiously takes the handle.  He knows it will hurt but he's determined not to cry or wince, like he still does when he gets a shot at the doctor's office.  Surprisingly, he doesn't when he pierces his finger with the point of the blade.  It hurts but he can manage it. He feels a new power ripple through him.*\n\n*That's when things start to change.  The nightmares.  His parents suddenly imposing a strange curfew.  He cannot go out at the full moon.  Instead he lies in the windowless closet his parents insisted he would sleep on those nights from now on but he never can sleep.  His body tingles everywhere, supercharged with the expectancy and longing for pain.*\n\n*It scares him, too.  That's why he put up with it for so long.*\n\nThe growls surround me.  Shut the box Shut the box SHUT THE BOX LEAVE SHUT THE BOX LEAVE\n\nI shut the box as the growls commanded and it all receded. Then I got up on wobbly legs and scurried out of the cabin.\n\nI still fear what would have happened if I had left the box open.",

Louis, what time- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?\u201d \n\nSparked by her motherly instinct, Barbara Paul stormed out of her room, wearing nothing more than a simple nightgown, and scream-mumbling for her son\u2019s safety. \n\n\u201cJEFFREY!

Thy name... Thy will be done... Forgive our trespasses... OW!\u201d \n\nShe had sprained her ankle. \n\nNow waddling like a wounded animal, she plodded toward the entrance through which she knew her son must have exited.

Your son needs you,\u201d she rebuked. \n\nAs Louis Paul half-heartedly moseyed down his cottage's spiraling staircase, he could see and hear his wife\u2019s self-inflicted slaps and maddened yelps. \n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, some coffee.\u201d \n\nWhile her husband frustratedly tried to separate two coffee filters with an almost conscious brain, Barbara leaped through her front door, still bawling words, which, at that point, no one could understand. Her bare feet stomped into the Canadian winter with absolute confidence. This tenacity stemmed, less-so from Barbara\u2019s strong will and courage, and more-so from the numbness inherited from the horrific sight before her. \n\nHer son\u2019s torn clothes were scattered all over the front yard. Foot markings littered the fresh snow in an aimless pattern similar to that left by a drunk man. Eventually, the prints transformed into a more rectangular, blocky shape before leaving nothing but a dragged path on the snow. This path lead to the most singular sight. Jeffrey Paul stood immobile in the middle of the suburban street; except he wasn\u2019t in human form. No, the terrifying creature that was once known as Jeffrey reached a height of 10 meters. His width occupied the entire street. He had neither eye nor limb; his hair was thick as wood. The rough, bark-like texture of his skin could leave no room for mistake. Jeffrey had turned into a log cabin!",

            "comment": "\"So... how does it work?\". I was freaking out, but I needed to understand. They say there are 5 Stages of Grief and I was already on Acceptance. It didn't help that I went through the first four by myself when I was a cabin.  \n\n\n\"Well, for starters. The transformation happens when you see the full moon, and you return to human form the moment dawn starts.\" My father nonchalantly sipped his tea. We were in our family cabin in the woodlands of Portland.  \n\n\n\"Is there a name for it?\" I don't know if I wanted a label, but maybe the internet had more information. I just didn't know what to search. *Cabin transformation* brought up remodeling shows.  \n\n\n\"Well, you're probably familiar with werewolves or as cryptozoologists call them, lycanthropes. We're a different species called oikosthropes\". My father started walking towards the bookshelf. The bookshelf had always been filled with medical books, even though no one in the family was a doctor. I always thought it was a show to make ourselves look smarter to guests, or maybe they would come in handy in case of an emergency.  \n\n\n\"Does that mean werewolves are real?\" Nervousness came over me. If werewolves were real, wouldn't they live in woodlands like this? I mean, assuming they were responsible people who didn't want to hurt innocents...  \n\n\n\"Yes. Very much so, among other species. You're probably wondering about transmission. Folklore says if a werewolf bites someone, they get infected with the virus. Well...that also applies in our case\". My father found the book he was looking for. *Strange Creatures Part IV.*  \n\n\n\"Wait. I was bitten by a house?\" That made no sense. How do houses bite?  \n\n\n\"You need to stretch your imagination. Transmission of viral load amongst animals is commonly done via saliva, but for houses, it's a different matter. In your case, you got infected when you drank the sink water of a werecabin. Your grandfather's werecabin form in fact.\"  \n\n\n\"I dra---\". I didn't even want to start to make analogies between cabins and wolves. The implications were problematic.  \n\n\n\"Does that mean people in our family are infected?\" Was my father infected? Mother? How long had people known?  \n\n\n\"Yes. Some of us have immunity though. I happen to have it. You didn't inherit it. More importantly, though, your clock has started\"  \n\n\n\"Clock---\". My father had been rifling through the pages of that textbook. He finally found what he was looking for.  \n\n\n\"After the first transformation, a victim has 12 years till their ailment becomes permanent unless they are able to finish a 'remodel' by then.\"  \n\n\n\"Remodel?\" What was I? Some kind of summer project?  \n\n\n\"Basically, you need contractors to replace every floor board, repaint. It's unclear when it needs to stop. Rather you know when you've failed.\" He stood up and motioned to the cabin we were in.  \n\n\n\"...like your brother.\"",

Well that's not really true, it really started (in my memory) when I was 4 years old. \n\nI remember sitting in the back of my parents car as they argued. We had been at a family friends cookout all day and we were getting home late. \n\"Are you fucking kidding me! It's your job to keep track of these things!\"\n\"Oh my job?! It's OUR job as his parents! And on that subject, don't swear around him!\"\n\"God damnit! There are more important things than swearing around him right now!\" \nAnd so on until we got home. My mother quickly scooped me out of my car seat and ran furiously into our home. They got me into bed and have barely spoken of the event since. I do remember that since then my parents have been very careful not to let me outside in certain nights, but I never really thought to investigate. \n\nAnd that brings us to now, or a week before now. I had just turned 16 and my parents decided it was finally time to share the truth.\n\"Now son. We want you to know before we say this that its never changed how much we love you\" \nMy mom chimed in with \"That's right, we've always loved you very much. Not in spite of your illness but with it\"\nI was already confused but when she mentioned an illness I broke. \"What do you mean illness?! What are you talking about?! Where is this going?!\"\nMy dad put a hand on my shoulder. \"Now son, we understand that this is a very difficult conversation for both of us so we won't beat around the bush any longer.\" \nMy mom seemed to tense up and my dad looked at her, though he ended it before I could tell what emotions he was conveying to her.\nMy dad sighed, \"Son, you are a werehouse.\" \nSilence hung for a very long moment.\nA burst out laughing, it was a joke, just a weird prank my parents had thought up to mess with me. \nBut my laughing ceased when they're faces stayed serious.\n\nThe next week was a complete trip. My parents insisted on doing more activities as a family. We went bowling, played Lazer tag, hell my dad rented a boat for a day. Every day of that week was spent with them. I still didn't quite believe the whole werehouse thing but my parents answered any questions I had and they still didn't give off any impression that they were joking. And last night I decided it was time to finally know for sure. During my time away from my parents (early morning and late night) I had looked around Google and I just so happened that there was a full moon on Friday night of that week. My plan wasn't the smoothest but it was the best I could come up with at the time. I would climb out my window once I knew my parents were in their room, run a few blocks from my house into the woods, and then I guess just see what happened. \n\nMy plan went surprisingly well. I made it into the woods, and found a clearing without a hitch. But then came the moment of truth, I had to look up at the moon. I took a deep breath, braced myself, and looked up! http://imgur.com/gallery/ToNvbc5",

Usually it's wolves, I guess because those are the most interesting thing to turn into: feeling the adrenaline of being a predator, running through the grass, chasing prey.

But I guess I dismissed it as some sort of \"better safe than sorry\" precaution, because the government knows about werepeople. Everyone gets tested at birth, they keep track of the special people and either forbid them to come outside during a full moon when they are a dangerous were-kind, or give them special treatment if they are a useful kind. And sure, most werepeople naturally can't *control* it when they turn, but there are rumours that, with the right medication and military training, you can learn. \n\nI have so many questions now. How did my parents slip my were-ness under the radar? And are they were-people too, given that it's hereditary? And how come that I *remember* turning into a log cabin? I couldn't control it, that's for sure. But how mobile are log cabins, generally speaking? I remember the moment I turned, and I *felt* like a cabin.

That sounds like a solid plan, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe day after, it was all over the news. \"Woman brutally murdered at camp site in the woods.\" And I got it on camera.\n\nBut it wasn't a murder. \n\nWhat happened was, I set up camp, set up a camera - somewhat hidden, but I figured it didn't have to be *that* sneaky since I was alone. I left some open space in the middle of my campsite, roughly the size of an average log cabin, and I waited.\n\nLike last month, I remember the turning itself, but not the events after that. What I do remember is coming to in the morning, covered in blood. Someone else's blood. And a decapitated body of a young woman next to me on the floor. I panicked and wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I took the camera with me because I obviously didn't want any photographic evidence linking me to the place of the murder. I'd think about a cover story later, maybe I heard a wild animal and fled, leaving my camp behind. \n\nI got home, took a shower, burned my blood-stained clothes in my dad's barbecue. Then I went to my room, locked the door and watched the recording. The whole night had been pretty uneventful. I turned into a cabin and just... stood there, until the sun was almost coming back up. Suddenly, a woman slowly approaches my campsite. I hear her whisper, \"Hello? Anybody here? I got lost... Oh, a cabin. Can I come inside?\" She knocks on the door of the cabin, first softly and then starts banging it. It won't budge, so she uses one of the campfire logs I had put out to bang the lock - and upon seeing that footage, my side starts burning. I hike up my shirt and see a bruise I hadn't spotted in the shower earlier. Huh, good to know. The lock clicks open, and she opens the door. I hear her say \"Hello? Anybody here?\" as she puts her head inside to look around. The last thing I hear is \"wow, what's this?\" before she starts shrieking.\n\nI turned back into a human. \n\nI guess that means... *her head is still inside me.* The thought of that twists my stomach, and I run to the bathroom to vomit.",

You see.. we might seem very... *white picket fence* right now, but we weren't always like that.\"\n\nShe hesitates.\n\n\"We used to be *thieves*, honey. The last job we did, we stole a very rare and expensive gem. We got away with it, cleanly, because of our combined were-forms, but there was no way in hell we could ever sell this gem. And since we had previously been investigated for a similar break-in, back when we were young and sloppy, it was only a matter of time before they'd seek us out again.\"\n\nMy dad continued.\n\n\"What we didn't know, is that your mum turning when she was pregnant with you, would speed up her pregnancy. Before that night, she had been 8 weeks along. But swans have an incubation period of about a month, so when she turned back...\"\n\n\"I don't remember much of it, only that your Dad got me to the hospital in time to give birth to you. You were so big, the doctors joked that you stayed in there for an extra month or something. We were able to stay under the radar for a few weeks, but then the expected knock came on the door. A police officer, wanting to ask us some questions about the stolen gems.\"\n\n\"If that conversation with that officer just now sounded rehearsed, it's because your mum has had it multiple times in the past. Coincidentally, it was a full moon that night. I proposed taking you out to see what your were-form was, partially about curiosity and partially to see if it could be useful to our predicament. Your mum was against it but eventually curiosity got the better of her.\"\n\n\"So we went out, and like I said, I was a bit disappointed when it was a cabin. But then your dad-\"\n\n\"I smiled. I was so proud of you! This was the solution to all our problems. We went inside, being careful to not rearrange or damage anything, and left the gem on a table in the middle of the room.\"\n\nSomething doesn't add up. \"Wait,\" I ask, \"how did you not turn that evening?\"\n\nMy parents look at each other and smile. \"We did, honey. We're just able to control it. That's how we pulled off the heists, too.\"\n\nI'm flabberghasted. All these years, I thought they were normal people, just really scared of were-people. And here they are, masters at controlling their turns. And then the realisation hits me - the gem is *inside me.* And the woman must have seen it before I decapitated her. Yikes. I feel bile come up my throat.\n\n\"Don't worry, honey. We'll keep you safe. All we have to do now, is run.\"",

How did I know what concrete tasted like?\n\nI tumbled back into my house, awaiting the hellfire that is my parents.\n\n\"We warned you.\" My dad's voice came from the living room.  I followed the sound, finding him sitting on the couch with my mom. \n\n\"Not really,\" I said, my throat still dry. I might as well cough up asbestos. \n\n\"Why do you think we didn't let you out on full moons?\" My mom snapped, the dark circles under her eyes showing her lack of sleep.\n\nI sat on the single chair across from them. My joins still ached, even in the comfort of the recliner. The silence lingered between the three of us. \n\n\"Where's Victoria?\" I tried to change the subject. Usually my younger sister was up this early. \n\n\"She's playing her video game.,\" My mom sighed. She squeezed the bridge of her nose. Was I seriously giving her a headache?\n\n\"Roman, I never go out in a full moon either,\" My dad said lowly.\n\nA heavy silence washed over us. He looked like he was going to continue, but the pause lingered.\n\nFinally, he opened his mouth.\n\n\"I turn into a tool shed.\"",

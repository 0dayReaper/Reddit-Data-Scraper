            "comment": "\u201cThanks reddit,\u201d I said, \u201cY\u2019all make this community spectacular. I\u2019ve been coming here for a few years just to have fun reading and writing, and apart from getting banned once when a mod thought my story was so terrible that I must be trolling, the feedback has always been constructive. I think that says a lot about an internet community. The rest of the internet can get pretty negative and rude, but the people who hang out on /r/writingprompts are really awesome to each other. And I really mean it when I say-\u201d\n\nSomething tapped my shoulder from behind. I swiveled my chair and saw Revolutionary Comrade Zoot\u2014the protagonist of the very first story I posted to /r/writingprompts three and a half years ago.\n\n\u201cRemember me?\u201d Zoot asked.\n\n\u201cI, uh,\u201d I sputtered. I racked my brains trying to remember his name and his plot arc.\n\n\u201cYou forgot?\u201d Zoot said, shocked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re blue,\u201d I said desperately, \u201cUm, you\u2019re like a\u2026 a communist type alien, um,\u201d\n\nZoot frowned. \u201cI was part of the prompt: [WP] You are the heir to the family business of being a superhero. At 16, your power is unveiled, but no one expected what it was\u2026\u201d \n\nI nodded, the memories beginning to stir.\n\n\u201cYou gave me the superpower of superdreaming,\u201d Zoot said.\n\n\"That's right,\" I said.\n\n\"I always wanted to ask you something,\" Zoot said.\n\n\"What's that?\" \n\n\"What's your dream?\" Zoot asked.\n\n\"Me?\" I said, \"It's pretty simple. I just want people to read the stuff I write.\"\n\n\"So you've made it, then,\" Zoot said, \"Just like me.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"I suppose I have. All because of reddit.\"\n\n\"Thanks reddit,\" Zoot said, turning to face YOU, the reader. \"You're awesome.\"\n\nze end!\n\n---\n\n/r/trrh\n\n\n\n",

                    "comment": "In case anyone was wondering here is oc's first response!\n\nRevolutionary Comrade Zoot sat behind a tumultuous ocean of paperwork. Every instant, a wave of documents leapt into the air to be sorted, signed, dated, stapled and stamped. Zoot moved so quickly that it looked as if he had at least a dozen arms. After stamping each document, he threw it into one of the various output chutes at the periphery of the office.\n\nThe gray bulletproof door to the office was ajar. A small blue hand knocked tentatively.\n\nZoot\u2019s hands froze. A blizzard of documents fell to the floor.\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d Zoot commanded in a booming voice.\n\nYoung Revolutionary Comrade Yobberz shuffled into the room, his purple eyes uneasily surveying the mess on the floor.\n\n\u201cSorry Dad,\u201d Yobberz said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to break your concentration,\u201d\n\nZoot\u2019s eyes softened when he saw his son. They looked very much alike, with their purple eyes, navy blue skin, square jaws, and devastatingly perfect hair.\n\n\u201cNot to worry, not to worry,\u201d Zoot said. With a flourish, he scooped up the fallen papers and whirled them around in the air until they formed a perfectly balanced house of cards and landed softly on his desk. \n\n\u201cWhat do you want to build today?\u201d Zoot asked, \u201cThe imperial spaceport?\u201d He whirled the house of cards into an expansive structure with a landing strip and a control tower. Yobberz looked uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThe Museum of Revolutionary History?\u201d Zoot asked hopefully. He tossed the spaceport into the air and rearranged the papers to make a building which looked like two spheres colliding into each other.\n\n\u201cNo, dad,\u201d Yobberz said, \u201cI\u2019m getting too old to be building towers out of lease agreements.\u201d\n\nZoot\u2019s face fell. \u201cBut it\u2019s excellent practice,\u201d he said, \u201cManeuvering paperwork is a vital skill in the real estate business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Yobberz said. He paused. \u201cBut, I\u2019m just not very good at it.\u201d He stood two documents on their sides and tried to place a third atop them as a roof. It collapsed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d Zoot said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Superpowers take practice.\u201d He thought about that last idea for a moment. Did superpowers take practice? He couldn\u2019t remember when he had first discovered his ability to manipulate size A4 paper with microscopic precision and supersonic speed. Was he born with the ability or had he learnt it?\n\n\u201cBut what if I don\u2019t have a superpower?\u201d Yobberz asked.\n\n\u201cOf course you have a superpower,\u201d Zoot said. \u201cEveryone in our family has always had superpowers. That\u2019s why we have the number one real estate business in the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Kookoobakkamania.\n\n\u201cYour mother has the superpower of supertalking and superwalking. In just three seconds, she can spout off an entire sales pitch for a property that would take a lesser real estate agent thirty minutes to communicate. When she\u2019s done talking, she leaves the paperwork with the client and superwalks over to the next property so she can give another sales pitch to another client. She sells hundreds of properties per day.\n\n\u201cYour brother has the superpower of supermaintenance. Whenever one of the toilets is leaking on one of our tenanted properties, he arrives on the scene and fixes the plumbing so well that it never breaks down again.\n\n\u201cAnd I have the superpower of superpapering. I can process trillions of pages of documents in a single day\u2014and I never make any errors!\u201d Zoot\u2019s eyes involuntarily glanced at the bullet-proof door. \u201cI mean, I almost never make any errors.\u201d\n\nYobberz sighed. \u201cI know dad. You guys are all very talented. But I\u2019ve tried everything, and I\u2019m no good at superpapering, supermanintenace, supertalking or superwalking.\u201d He looked at the floor. \u201cI\u2019m just a regular person.\u201d\n\nYobberz\u2019s face suddenly looked very determined. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can help the family business,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I should try to find a job in a different industry.\u201d\n\nZoot gasped. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to work in real estate?\u201d He was aghast. \u201cBut our family has had this real estate business for thousands of years!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Yobberz said, \u201cBut how can I contribute? I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nIgnoring him, Zoot said, \u201cYou are the direct male descendant of Revolutionary",

                            "comment": "Father Gleep, the Joiner of Worlds.\u201d\n\nZoot and Yobberz instantly snapped their heads to gaze at a portrait above the doorway. In the portrait there was a regal old figure in military garb who bore a strong likeness to Zoot and Yobberz. They both recited, \u201cmay the glorious one rest peacefully everafter\u201d while bowing their heads at the portrait.\n\nThey snapped back to their previous posture. Zoot continued, \u201cNeed I remind you of your ancestor\u2019s great feats?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo dad, I know\u2014\u201d\n\nZoot cleared his throat. \u201cIt was summer. Summer is a season, you see. Five hundred years ago, we had seasons. Back then, our planet rotated on a tilted axis. Depending on which hemisphere you lived in, you might be closer to the sun or further away, and this would make the weather hotter or colder for a few months.\n\n\u201cAnd it was a bad summer for the real estate business. Our family business had taken out unimaginably large loans, and we had to pay them back by the end of the season, or we would go bankrupt. But no one was buying real estate. You see, our great nation, Kookoobakkamania, had just won the war against the Evil Galactic Empire\u2014\u201d\n\nZoot paused. He and Yobberz both turned to the left and spat. \u201cMay the evil emperor\u2019s unending sleep be nightmarish,\u201d they recited.\n\nThey snapped back to their previous postures. Zoot continued, \u201cSo, we had just won the war. Our family decided to invest heavily in new properties that year, anticipating the return of billions of soldiers.\u201d\n\nHe paused for dramatic effect.\n\n\u201cBut they didn\u2019t come,\u201d Yobberz said, bored.\n\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d Zoot exclaimed, \u201cThey said that our home planet was too crowded. They liked living in the spacious worlds of the conquered Evil Galactic Empire.\u201d They both turned to the left and spat again. \u201cMay the evil emperor\u2019s unending sleep be nightmarish,\u201d they recited again.\n\n\u201cIt was the last day of the summer. The last chance to pay off the loans and save the family business from oblivion. Our great ancestor walked all over the city that day, until his feet were blistered and sore. But not a single person bought any real estate from him. That night, he went to bed, knowing that all was forfeit. He thought the family business would be destroyed. He stayed up for nearly the entire night, making cold-calls and being brutally rejected by the people whom he had dialed. Finally, when all of his strength was spent, he collapsed over the telephone.\n\n\u201cAnd he dreamt.\n\nZoot looked wistfully off into the distance. His son smiled and thought of Gleep\u2019s dream.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Yobberz said, \u201cHe dreamt of world-melding.\u201d\n\nZoot nodded solemnly. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cBack then, planets were solitary spheres,\u201d he whirled his hands and molded the paperwork into a slowly rotating sphere. \u201cAnd our planet was too crowded. The quality of life was diminished for everyone because there simply wasn\u2019t enough space.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd at the time, the best solution anyone could think of was to allow people to settle down on other planets.\u201d Zoot shook his head, \u201cBut this was terrible for the economy. No product was valuable enough to justify exporting from one planet to another. And the expenses associated with merely communicating information from one planet to another were so high that it was impossible for one single government to control multiple planets.\n\nZoot sighed. \u201cThat was the downfall of the evil galactic empire, you see,\u201d they performed their spitting ritual, \u201cthey were disorganized because their planets were so far apart.\u201d\n\nZoot looked up at the portrait above the door. \u201cBut our ancestor, he had a dream. And in the morning, that dream was almost lost. The bankers were furious that our family had not repaid its loans on time. They came to our ancestor\u2019s home and they tried to break down the door so they could take away everything and drag our great ancestor to the debtor\u2019s prison.\n\n\u201cBut our glorious ancestor, in his infinite wisdom, had built a strong door to his house.\u201d Zoot glanced at his own bulletproof door and smiled approvingly, \u201cAnd the bankers were unable to break down the door. They stood on the doorstep, shouting for our ancestor to come out. He looked at them through the peephole, and soothed them with his wise words. He told them of his dream.\n\n\u201cHis dream\u2014the dream of world-melding. In his dream, two worlds became one. He dreamt of astronauts traveling to a nearby planet and deploying a gravity rope onto its surface. The gravity rope slowly but surely tore the planet away from its original orbit and drew it nearer and nearer to our own planet\u2014until the worlds collided to form one great superplanet.\u201d Zoot molded another sphere out of paper and brought it closer to the first sphere until they touched.\n\n\u201cThe bankers immediately understood the genius of this idea. On the spot, they named him the director of the world-melding program and gave him all the financial backing necessary. And so, our ancestor brought two planets together, solving the problem of overpopulation and\u2014more importantly\u2014making our domestic real estate market a thriving industry once again.\u201d\n\nZoot beamed up at the portrait of Gleep.\n\n\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t end there,\u201d Zoot said. \u201cSoon, the billions and billions of soldiers began to return to our expanded homeworld, and so we had to add more and more planets to make room for them,\u201d he molded more spheres out of paper and joined them onto the original shape, forming a honeycomb pattern.\n\n\u201cSo now, our vast homeworld forms a spherical matrix which completely encircles our sun.\u201d\n\nHe scratched his head for a moment. The papers fell to the ground again. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t completely encircle the sun. There\u2019s a gap, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\n\nHe rummaged around his desk and activated his holographic encyclopedia. In a robotic voice, it read, \u201cThe glorious nation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Kookoobakkamania is located in the exact center of the universe. At the extreme center lies the eternal Revolutionary Sun, giver of life and light. Illuminated by the sun are the 83,868,999 homeworlds which have been fused together by the process of world-melding. These homeworlds surround the sun in a 360 degree sphere, leaving only a small 40,000 meter gap at the southern periphery--\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Yobberz said, \u201cThe gap is 40,000 meters?\u201d\n\nThe encyclopedia continued, \u201cFor centuries, Revolutionary scientists have endeavoured to locate a world that can plug this gap, but it is now thought that past world-melding efforts have depleted the universe of any worlds of the appropriate size that are capable of sustaining life. For this reason\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d Yobberz exclaimed, \u201cThe gap is 40,000 meters?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it is,\u201d Zoot said, surprised, \u201cThat\u2019s what the encyclopedia says.\u201d\n\nYobberz fell into ecstasy. \u201cI had a dream last night\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Zoot asked.\n\n\u201cI dreamt that I was an astronaut, flying in the Kappa-272 sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kappa-272?\u201d Zoot said, \u201cthat\u2019s an oddly specific detail for a dream to have, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\" Yobberz said, \"the dream was full of weirdly specific details. Exact locations, times, flight paths, and solar weather patterns\u2026 I thought it was just an odd dream, but now I remember, I remember that I saw a planet in my dream.\u201d\n\nHe looked at his father, terrified of the momentousness of the words he was about to speak.\n\n\u201cThat planet\u2026 was precisely 40,000 meters in diameter\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cDear Gods,\u201d Zoot said, his whole body slackening in awe before his son.\n\nThey stared at each other in astonishment.\n\n\u201cYou have the superpower of superdreaming,\u201d Zoot finally said. \n\nHe stood up and saluted his son. He couldn\u2019t contain his excitement. \u201cYou are Revolutionary Father Gleep reborn!\u201d He was grinning uncontrollably now, comprehending the full significance of his son\u2019s specialness. \u201cTell me son, what is the name of this planet you dreamt of?\u201d\n\nYobberz looked at his father in amazement. He was shocked to realize that he did have a superpower after all. And not just any superpower, but the greatest superpower there was. He would lead the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Kookoobakkamania to achieve the ultimate perfection by conquering the final planet in the universe and bringing it back to the homeworld to be melded. Yobberz cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s name is Earth,\u201d he declared.\n\n",

You too.\" And then she promptly threw her phone down and ran to the bathroom to puke again. She came back and wrote the last few words...Really, thanks.",

Though, the storm that accidentally visited my door and blundered through the shrubs was a welcome change, causing me to swap from a roaring fan to an open window. However, this brought in another problem: mosquitoes. As one zipped by, my arm reflexively whipped at my neck, trying to catch the bugger with an open palm. \n\n**WHAP.** Fuck. Missed.\n\nDespite that, I continued on, lightly scrolling through Reddit to ease my mind off of the heat. There, I spotted a little note from /r/WritingPrompts:\n\n&gt;\"[WP] you are yourself, on Christmas Day, reading this on reddit, you are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are, and to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!\"\n\n\"Fuck off! Can't tell me what to do.\" I said to myself, as if the prompter can hear it through the monitor, like some odd version of 1984. And so I scrolled on, while flicking to another tab to slip into Youtube and listen to that one Ghost song that keeps worming back into my head. Bit of a plague, that, but it doesn't bother me any. Unlike these bloody mosquitoes. \n\nArm. Fling. **WHAP**. Fuck. Missed.",

Am I really the kind of person worthy of love, and if I am, why do I feel worse after reading this?!?\" \n\n*Maybe it's because you don't deserve this love. You know that you're not a good person. It wouldn't be right for someone as worthless as you to receive a love like this.*\n\n*You're a burden rather than a blessing to those around you. You feel that there is nothing to love about you because THERE TRULY IS NOTHING TO LOVE!!* \n\n\n\nAs the thoughts begin to subside, I see the face of a man on my screen. The face of a man who  hated himself because of his shortcomings rather than cherish his blessings. A man who was exhausted from doing so for so many years that he hardly recognized himself. \n\nI reach towards the screen, hoping to somehow convince myself that the face was just a picture that I could swipe away. \n\nInstead, the man's face remained, realizing my worst fears had come true. I had become this man, a man I thought I had murdered and buried years ago, who did nothing but ruin every close relationship I had, suck all of the happiness from my life, and left emptiness to replace it. \n\nI could've sworn that he looked different back then as well, as he had fewer wrinkles, was clean shaven, and his hair was less grey.\n\nNow I realize the truth. I did not kill this man. He is here, staring at my reflection. The darkness had never left...   \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Thank you for reading. I'm sure that you might be questioning my mental state, and I don't blame you. \n\n&gt;Thankfully, this was only a reflection on my prior bouts with depression. The holidays always have a knack of reminding me of the darker times of my life. I'd like to think that it's also a reminder of how far I've come since then as well. \n\n\n&gt;I've been wanting to write something like this for quite some time. I was hoping for my creative juices to start to flow with a happier topic, but I couldn't help myself. \n\n&gt; I'm hoping that this will help me start to become a more frequent contributor to this subreddit. I love reading everyone's stories, and often write my own, but I'm usually too late or too afraid to post them. \n\nHope everyone has a merry Christmas, or whatever you plan on doing this day. Have fun, love, be loved, and cherish your blessings! ",

People aren't being tortured and vilified just because they dared to be in pain. Not really. Not in the US.

He had hoped that would be the end of things, and he was going to recover soon, but here he lay, six in the morning, sleeping sporadically through hacking and wheezing and sneezing.\n\nBut as he browsed Reddit on his phone, /u/therunawayguy realized something.\n\nThat though he was miserable, he was also happy.\n\nThere had been many things going on that had been rough, but as always, good comes alongside the bad. He had seen and got to interact with family he *did* like. Gotten to see his sister, who he otherwise suspected was depressed, have her face light up at the prospect of getting a video game she had wanted for a long time. Gotten to surprise his mother, one of his personal heros, with gifts that made her break down into tears of happiness. Gotten to give to charity two or three times, when he could normally only barely manage things well enough to care for even his own family.\n\nGotten to look on the internet, and see the beautiful things people have done for each other. From as important as fighting political battles to make the world a better place for everyone, to as wacky as pillows meant to depict a loved one's dog going horribly wrong, to as simple as wishing each other happy holidays.\n\nThough he had suffered, /u/therunawayguy realized that this this holiday season had probably been his personal favorite ever, simply because of the little things he had experienced and gotten to do for others and being able to see the joy of others around him.\n\nAnd suddenly, a little sickness didn't seem like such a big deal anymore.\n\nLaying there, he decided to type up a little message for the world at large:\n\n\"Thanks.\n\nIt's been a rough time. Haven't been this sick in a while, and truth be told, I still feel like death. But to quote one of my favorite characters, from one of my favorite shows (despite its controversies), 'And yet, I smile'. :) \n\nAs I've grown, it's becoming more and more apparent to me that what makes me happy is seeing others happy, and I've seen a lot of happiness recently, both from my real life and from the internet, particularly Reddit.\n\nI'm tired, and going to try and get some more sleep now, but I just wanted to say thank you to you wonderful people. For everything. From r/wholesomememes to charity subs like r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza, this website has done some amazing stuff, especially this time of year, and I'm confident that it will continue to do these things. Keep being cool, Reddit, and never forget that spirit - the drive to help your fellow human beings in whatever ways you can. Doesn't have to be huge. Even something as simple as a meta writing prompt can make someone smile, and if you do that for someone, I'd say you've done well enough. :)\"\n\nAnd with that, he hit 'Add Comment' and closed his eyes, comforted in the knowledge that happiness was all around him, as it was around everyone.\n",

The last 20 or 90 months have been covered in ice, it seems. And a blizzard has been forming in my head for years. I've salted the streets in preparation for my upcoming travels into the unknown depths of my mind. It's a slippery-slope that I romantisize and adore. That beautiful, wintery greyness that manifests itself as melancholy and ennui. Comfort resides in the past. And that's where I wish to be.\n\nIt is there that I await my fate. With an ever-pervasive sense of hope that only fools relive time and time again. \"There's no future without you, or those before you\", I tell myself. Yet, time-again, I find myself saying those words again. It's as if I do not know myself without another, without regard to who the \"other\" is. \n\nThey can tell me time-and-time again how loved and accepted I am, but they'll never convince me. And I'll only let them down, as they let down my idolized notions of them. It's not their fault. And it's not exactly mine either. But they can never love me in all the ways I need to be loved. It's impossible.   \n\nBut you could at least spend New Years Eve with me, like you said you would last year. You weren't there. You won't be this year, either. You were never there.... and never will be, apparently. I don't need you... and fuck you. I just want you to remember the wreck you left behind. I want you to realize that the only reason I replied to a \"writingprompt\" to some complete stranger on reddit is because you told me you could never live without me or forget me. The only reason I'm typing this out is in hopes that you happen to come across this comment, and recognize how incredilbly hurt I am by your actions. My *reactions* weren't great, I'll give you that, but the things you did and said  to begin with -- I never ... I'm not the bad guy, and fuck you for trying to make me think that I was. I might have been the bad guy in my past relationships...but not with you. \n   \n\n",

            "comment": "As I read through the title of the \"writing prompt\" on Reddit, I couldn't help but feel astounded at how vacuous I was as an individual. Yet perhaps, vacuous is not the correct word to be used; for that which is empty may yet be filled. Rather than merely empty, a husk or a shell, I was filled with a feeling of resentment. What could displace a feeling of resentment born of the individual recognition that you had not only failed to not do what you knew for a fact was right but also that you did what you knew for a fact was wrong? \n\nTo resent one-self for their weakness, then, to once again resent them for wallowing in self-pity and brooding over their misery.  When you become the jailor, prisoner, judge, jury and executioner, the warden of your own cell. The bars, key and lock of your own make. The maker of appeals you devise, file and reject. That, is true damnation. Yet you parade your cage around, gilded in a thin veneer of vanity, of arrogance born of an intellectual sciolisism. Masquerading a sickly and cruel nature from those closest to you. Playing the jester even though you're naught but a fool. Yet here you are, once again confronted by the darkness you resent but that you hold oh-so-dear, because without it there would be nothing, and as you know bitterness and resentment are preferable to nothingness. \n\nI read the sheets of my mind with these words filling them. Yet as I read, I could not move my eyes from the one page book marked aeons ago. A page simply titled hope, a word so blindingly filled with light; it could illuminate and elucidate not only the darkness but fill the emptiness as well. If only for a moment. Yet it is for these movements that I or maybe you, dear reader, live. If nothing else the wish to reach that light is enough to keep the darkness at bay, for just one more day, and who knows, maybe, just maybe, one day is all you need to wake up, wake up and find the way, find the answer, live that effervescent truth.

But the snow had not fallen. \n\nNot enough to even cover a shoe. \n\nThe the man lay and wait for his family to arise as he lounged on the couch and rubbed sleep from his eyes.\n\nSee he was home from college. To his mother's great joy. But his brothers could care less, they wernt merely just boys.\n\nThe brothers were at this point in time, young men of their own. Angst and bodyhair, and sweet and grime. \n\nThey cared not at all that their brother was home. Choosing instead to go off on their lives all alone.\n\nNow this fact it did seem made the elder quite sad. For all he wanted and wished was to spend time with the lads. \n\nHe felt like the boys, the brothers, the men. Cared not for him nor his actions for them. \n\nBut on Christmas day the two boys arose, at a time quite new. See they normally stayed in their beds till bout 2. \n\nNot this morning no. The pair had awoken. Went downstairs and had greeted their brother with words long not spoken.\n\n\"I'm happy your home.\" One said very stoic. \"Its kinda lame here without you, alone.\" \n\nThe other agreed with a nod and a grunt. He was a man with few words and that fact was blunt. \n\nThe eldest brother smiled and looked at these two. The pair before him both old. And yet new.\n\nSee a detail was lost. Was torn from the pages. The difference between the boys was naught just of ages. \n\nThe two brothers were brothers by blood and by birth. The eldest was added by marriage henceforth.\n\nHe felt like the two had naught a care for him. But this display of affection small when viewed from outside. Ment the world to the eldest who took it in stride. \n\nThe three sat and wait. For the parents arrival . The three of them watching a show on survival. \n\nThe three were just brothers. No distinction, no guff. They were brothers that's all... and that was more than enough.\n\n",

My wife had left the bedroom door cracked, and the automatic lightswitch pumped high intensity living-room light directly onto my face, blasting me awake.  In confusion, I flung out my arm, and knocked my 32oz World Of Warcraft movie promotional water glass onto the floor, soaking my boots and everything else with stale tap liquid.  I staggered into the hall, babbling about the government.\n\n\"Merry Christmas\", my wife exclaimed.  She likes Christmas.\n\nAfter cleaning up the mess with a bath towel that was on its way to the laundry anyway, I sat in my chair and tried to meditate.  It's supposed to help with PTSD and arguing with my mother.\n\nI think it was the Dogen Zenji who once said that the second worst thing for meditation is clicking on r/popular, and the worst is commenting on a post there and thinking you are helping.  Saw that on r/TIL I think.\n\n\"You are loved and accepted for who you are\", someone named HeckinGoodDoggo had written.  I used to believe everything I read on Reddit, before the incident with the safe, when I lost my innocence.  I suppose it is possible that a sentient canine could input a 35 word message that wasn't about licking its balls, I've just never seen it done.\n\n\"Are you willing to pose for a hammy photograph with the money my mother sent you?\"  the wife asked.  \"And could you act like a scruffy shiftless tramp who is desperate for it so that she feels like she did her good deed for the day and can allow herself to relax on a holiday like normal people do?\" my irritated brain added.\n\nI mumbled an affirmative and decided to wrap it up.  I had a lot of cooking to do anyway.\n\nThe little score to the right bore out the validity of HGD's claim.  \"89% upvoted\".\n\nYou are loved and accepted for who you are, as long as you are who everyone tells you to be, my brain offered.\n\nFuck you, brain, nobody likes you.  You're dead wrong most of the time, and when you get something right, everyone explodes at you for telling the truth.  You're a worse enemy than my abusive father ever was, because at least he'd shut up.  Why can't you be nice for the holiday that means something to some people somewhere, like a normal American brain?\n\nOh wait, we have macadamia nuts today, I remembered.\n\nSee, I'm not such a bad guy, my brain pleaded.  Please don't kill me with shatter and whatever that stuff your brother brewed in his bathtub is.\n\nI closed up the decrepit laptop.  It would take a lot for me to believe the genetically altered dog-humanoid with opposable thumbs, but the macadamia nuts would help with that.\n\nMerry Christmas!",

I scrolled through Reddit, my turn in and slow down ritual for the last few years. \n\nTonight was a little different, being Christmas and all that jazz.

I've gone and conflated the meaning of saying again, good one dumbass. Never get anything right. Stupid, stupid, stupid.\n\nWhat's this? A wild thread appears! \"You are loved and accepted for who you are. I hope you have the opportunity to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!\" \n\nI'd forgotten what it was like to have my heart skip a beat, sort of how it would feel when Mary Sue would look at me with those big brown doe eyes. The way her curves would just slide through the air like a graceful dancer effortlessly demonstrating the tango to a prospective group of students, all the while making each and every individual there feel like they were the center of her attention - had I not lived it I would to this day still scoff at most alliteration as over the top and ridiculous. My mouth is parched, it's been at least a few minutes since the last sip, the tumbler is three quarters full and Woodford Reserve is just such a smooth spirit for such a cheap price that it would be a shame to let it sit unattended for too long.\n\nThe link pops out at me as I feel the slow burning of tonight's spirit within me. Fine, I'm game, let's see what happy go lucky sentiments we have flowing through our collective pysche tonight.\n\n*Click.*\n\nTypical, the title text is it and there's nothing more to it than that, why do I waste my time with this? Well, I suppose of all things, I have time. This thread is as good a place as any to spend it.\n\nMy instincts say that the topic title is clear and unambiguous but a gut wrenching feeling is gnawing at me, a feeling that I've only felt a few times before - LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION! On stage and feeling like a fool, stumbling through lines and missing scene prompts. \n\nBlood pressure spikes, jaw tenses and eyes narrow. Accepted? Loved? How incredibly presumptious and self serving, is this OP completely incapable of facing the realities of life? *It's possible to make all the right moves and still lose the game*. Not that I made the right moves or that life is a game. The dregs of the glass of bourbon whiskey are imbided with gusto and the fire within is renewed.  \n\nA face stares back at me from the screen, gradually reddening and seeming uglier with anger and bitterness with every passing moment. It's almost 2018, and here I am ready to type - where are my Ghost in the Shell expandable typing fingers when I need them most?\n\nThe cursor is moved over \"Reply\" but the imminent click of the mouse is interrupted by the colour and light of a mobile phone screen turning off, as if it was just activated by a far away touch that inevitably gave up when it got nothing back.\n\nFor fucks sake, I was so engrossed in my own thoughts I missed a call, best see what this is about.\n\n\"Hey there! Keen for a cheeky dinner?\"\n\nMy mind spirals, it's out of control. What a mess.\n\n\"Me?\"\n\nRelieved laughter escapes my lips - obviously they meant a different Wookie and this is a classic case of phone fat fingering. Thank god! \n\nMemories fight their way against the rip tide of my will and I realise with a sickening jolt that I just told the literal only person to reach out to ask to see me on a special day in the last 10 years to fuck off. The Italian double walled tall glass stares back at me mockingly once I've slammed back most of it's refreshed contents, daring me to go for another refill.\n\nRage boils up in me in a manner that I've been able to keep under lock and key for years though things are very different this time. Instead of anger reaching it's ultimate crescendo as per past out of control situations, tears flow and anxiety skyrockets. My soul has finally succumbed to effects of the empty platitudes and broken promises of healthily social people.\n\n&amp;gt; I hope you have the opportunity to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!\n\nGet's me every time, reading between the lines.

A complete stranger telling me that I\u2019m loved and appreciated, feelings that I rarely feel from family, words that I haven\u2019t heard in a long time, and they are written for all to see. They mean much more than the original poster thinks it does. \n\nI wipe my eyes and decide to share the amazing feeling I got from the prompt, sitting upright in bed as I type, wishing every one a Merry Christmas and applauding all those who worked up the nerve to deal with the stress and anxiety I know family can bring. \n\nMerry Christmas, Reddit, I hope 2018 brings you so much joy.

All of a sudden many wholesome comments got into my inbox wishing me Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year. It wasn\u2019t long before they started saying I was loved and accepted as an amazing novelty account. The wholesomeness overcame me as I searched for more people with their Cake Day. And as the day ended I said Happy Cake Day to some and to all a Happy New Year! \n\nMerry Christmas everyone!",

He's visiting his family for the holidays, over a thousand miles away from his humble abode across the country. *I blame Manifest Destiny.*\n\n\nThis Christmas isn't much unlike any other day, considering how dysfunctional his family is. His father and sister aren't speaking to each other, his parents constantly argue about trivial things, and he feels at times that it is his duty to repair the fragmented family he left behind.\n\n\nBut he rejects that duty; for this working young man is just all too tired. For now, he simply wishes to relax and enjoy his vacation in the comfort of this motley group of oddballs who love him unconditionally.\n\n\nThe simple things bring joy to this young man's somewhat desolate existence, such as visiting one of his favorite websites and reading a thread title with some comforting words in it. It's things like this that remind him that life is worth living, no matter what.\n\n\n*It's gonna be a fine Christmas.*",

Inside, my partner wanders around- for him, today is just another day. But neither of those matters.\n\n*You are loved and accepted for who you are.* If that\u2019s was true, then why did so many people find fault with it? Everything from my turquoise hair, to my weight, to the habits I have. How I see the world. Daring to be different. It felt... **wrong.** And yet... *so right.* I didn\u2019t know what to think, but I smiled- despite the tears, silently sliding down my face. *I may not know who you are, but your voice joined a growing chorus of voices, loving and deceased alike, who tell me the same* I think to myself\n\nLong ago, such things like love and acceptance, alongside many other things, were violently stolen away. Endless mental scars mar my mind and soul. Now, I hate myself. If not for the fact I would leave people in suffering, I\u2019d have moved on to the next world long ago. Very little keeps me here... but as I think of my three lovers, my friends and family- the family I chose, not those blood relations- the tears come hard now. How could I ever hate myself? Time and time again, it\u2019s been proven there\u2019s so much I offer to the world. A daring, pinkish attitude. Creativity for days. A strange, but delightful intelligence. Delightful wickedness. A charisma and beauty not defined by my looks- but, a certain aura I just give off. A kind heart, fierce loyalty, and an open ear and door. Willingness to fuck every societal belief about what women are supposed to be, and not caring. Vibrancy, fun- colours in a monotone world. Yet, many days, all I see is a collection of faults. Mental illness is nasty that way...\n\nMy roommate interrupts me, asking about breakfast. I ask him why he didn\u2019t just go without me. \u201cBecause it\u2019s  not worth it without RukaKat.\u201d I laugh through the tears, and shake my head. Maybe getting out will be good for me. Besides the mandatory social circuit-and hey, breakfast beats remembering all those I loved and lost.  With a last sigh, I decide to submit my thoughts. If anyone ever needs a friend, I am here, always. Happy Holidays to all, from one young woman who lurks but never really posts.",

But what does that get me? Some advice on grammar? A few upvotes? Worthless. For once why don't I say something useful. \n\nTake a look around you. What do you see?  Family? A computer screen? Bottles of booze? I see a room too small for two people, with a bed that begs for them. I see clothes lying wrinkled and dirty, because who do I have to impress? Parents? Disowned them. Family? Too far away to be cheap enough to see. I see in the mirror a mess of a person more monster than man, by his own making. A real life Beast: too violent and atypical to interact with society, but too lonely to stand the isolation.\n\nBut do you know what else I see in that mirror? I see someone who wants nothing more than to find someone to be better for. I see someone who has stood by his friends, supporting them through two literal floods, suffering when he could have guaranteed himself a safe place somewhere else. I see someone unafraid to find someone to love after years of watching his heart break piece by piece. \n\nThere are many people in the world. All with their ups and downs. There are those blinded by their positives to the point of arrogance, and those choked by their faults to the point of suicide. So to those out there staring at this, with no one by your side, I ask you to remember something: YOU are the change in your life. No one is coming to save you. Only you can do that. But without you, you will do nothing but wallow in despair. \n\nNow I don't know about you guys, But the future looks like it's got some good stuff over there. Who's coming with me?",

            "comment": "The sky dampened. Slow roars of aircraft passing over the quiet Beverly Regional Airport drummed against the window of the apartment, leaving me to inch up the volume on my Walkman. It was tuned to the only radio station I could seem to find, which seemed to be playing alternative rock through a foggy haze of faint, blurry static. Two days ago I was escaping a rainy, freezing New York City - and the grips and trappings of an unglamorous but homeful Chinatown. Yesterday I was saying my goodbyes to my grandfather, whose clock ticks down yet to three months. Today I listed, quietly, in the apartment of my mother's parents, and prepared myself for loss.\n\nUnevent after unevent didn't happen, leaving me to dwell on my past. I was not well liked, and I was not well accepted. I dragged my feet every day for what must have been my whole life - yet only twenty years - until the last six months - when I resolved that I would, at least, lift them up high enough for them to not leave a mark anywhere. I did so by telling myself things would be better - that I could win. Six months later and I looked back, and I was no further than two paces from where I started. And so, today, I contemplated my life - and, as many times before, my death.\n\nLast week was a high point for me; today was the aftermath, like sweeping the pieces of a great, grand, beautiful explosion of life. No one told me that life left so much debris everywhere after the fact. Reddit was only a buffer and a distraction from what crippled my own legs - perhaps it was what caused it to begin with, but my connection to the internet has become an integral part of my life. I would be foolish - such as an alcoholic would be to suddenly stop drinking, or a smoker to suddenly stop smoking - to cut myself off. I never fit in anywhere - not even at *r/writingprompts.* My first conversation on the Discord server ended with an older user talking down to me. My second and final conversation ended with one of his peers *punching* down. And that was it.\n\nMost of my friendships, long and short, close and distant, ended like that.\n\nI joined *r/writingprompts* because the only thing that seemed to keep me alive was writing - even if no one would ever read it. I *desperately* wanted people to read it. I swore to myself that I would publish something before I died - even if that would be the death of me. Any time I looked past the moment I publish a book, or a novel, or a poem - every single time - I only saw blankness. Not the blankness of unknowing, like the Ghost of Christmas Future - but the blankness of death, like... the Ghost of Christmas Future.\n\nI didn't want anything else. I didn't want to live long enough to be accepted or criticized; I wanted to be remembered.\n\nSomeone would hurt me, and I would not be remembered. I would hurt someone else, and still - because of my very nature - I would not be remembered. I have no legacy laid ahead of me, I thought, and it was true.\n\nThe sky dampened. The air dried to a crispy, Massachusetts winter torrent outside. The lamp in this empty apartment, with everyone doing other things elsewhere, flickered. I laid down and thought for a while. In one swift motion, I instinctively glanced at my Reddit profile, checked my karma after my last lengthy comment post on *r/worldbuilding*, and my heart sank as it always did, a mooring that kept me trapped in this circular thinking. It was a feedback loop made of depression and intrusive thoughts, amplified by self-destruction and wishes of the void. Thoughts ran through my head which I had heard a million times before but stung me all the same.\n\nI heard the only noteworthy line from *Destiny 2* rattle in my head, given life to a new, perfected context:\n\n*You started small. You will end small.*\n\nAnd it was true.\n\nI read the top of *r/writingprompts*, and sighed arrogantly. *[WP] you are yourself, on Christmas Day, reading this on reddit, you are told that you are loved and accepted for who you are, and to have a happy holiday season, and a great new year!*\n\nI stirred. *I wish.*\n\nOn the most cheerful day of the year, amidst the most cheerful thread of the subreddit, I sat still and quietly wondered to myself what would actually be the final straw that tipped me off the edge - and contemplated how much hope I had left to waste on thinking it wouldn't come sooner than expected.\n\n*Good night, Reddit*, I said softly.\n\nThe sky dampened.",

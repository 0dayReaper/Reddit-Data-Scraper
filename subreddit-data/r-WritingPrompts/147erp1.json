            "comment": "Acme Corporation issued a profit warning earlier today, revising their full year 2023 guidance down by 50%. Shares tumbled in early morning trading as analysts scrambled to make sense of the company\u2019s business model in the new continuity environment.\n\n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re all still dealing with the development of hard continuity, and Acme Corporation is no exception to this,\u201d Marvin Acme Jr., Chairman of Acme Corporation and son of the late Marvin Acme Sr., read in a prepared announcement. \u201cWhile we need to manage through the impact these changes will have on our business, we remain absolutely focused on delivering the kind of high quality products with which Acme has been synonymous for nearly a century.\u201d\n\n\r  \nMarket observers are skeptical the company can navigate the new reality, and may be forced to pivot from their legacy product portfolio. \n\n\u201cWell I say, son, look-a here: This is a customer business,\u201d noted private equity billionaire Foghorn Leghorn on a recent Richie Rich podcast. \u201cNow I\u2019m not a mathematical genius, but I reckon the more customers you have, the better your business will perform. And I do declare if your customers are now blowing themselves sky high with your product, then that\u2019s about as helpful as overalls on a rattlesnake.\u201d\n\n\r  \nThe news follows several reports over the weekend of rocket and TNT-based fatalities, including the death of Wile E. Coyote, whose remains were identified at the bottom of the Grand Canyon Sunday morning. \n\nMr. Coyote was 73.",

Blood was pouring out of his joint. \"I should better get sleeping again, by the morning it will be gone...what a mess!\". He grabbed his enormous 3x4 meter alarm clock in the form of a orange-green glowing space-zeppelin-frog to take a blink on the time. Nothing. \"Ahh dang I forgot I slapped that elephant-dragonbee with that thing last morning, must still be broken. I'll just sleep again and...\".\r  \n\r  \n\"ERICC!!!! What are you doing? Why are you not in school and WHAT IS WITH ALL THIS BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE??\". Ercis Mom Bertha was standing near his bed completly in shock about the bloody mess. \"Mom chill I must have overslept its all go..\" Eric moaned while waking up noticing unbearable pain in his lower body. \n\n\"What the hell? Why isn't it healed? Mom what time is it?\"\r  \n\r\n\n\"Its 9:30 and you shoulda left for school 45 minutes ago!\" his mom responded.. \"How did you get this messed up when the day just started?\"\n\n\r\"I didn't. This is from yesterday.\"\n\n\r\"Sweetheart, this is entirely impossible!\"\n\n\rIt was indeed impossible. The world of comic-sans was resetting every morning at 6AM.\n\n\r\"Guys, please come! The News!\" Erics dad shouted loudly from the living room.\n\n\rWith the help of his mom he crawled downstairs to the living room. Loud noices where banging out of the tv.\r  \n\"This is the TimesNewRoman with a special broadcast. It appears as the town hall is still destroyed from yesterdays chase explosions. Scientists from all over the country are heading toward Sans to check out the situation!\".\n\n\r\"What is going on? Your leg and this situation?\" his mom said.\n\n\r\"I have to be there!\" Eric shouted and crawled towards his rocket skateboard. \n\n\rThe pain in his leg was increasing and he felt like the world was shifting sideways.\n\n\r\"I need to get going...\" he mumbled as he stood on his board outside of the porch.. unable to move.\n\n\rWhat was this feeling inside of him? \n\n\rWill it be safe to use the rocket board?\n\n\rFor the first time in his life of 43 years he was scared.",

            "comment": "Tom always waited and waited and waited. Until he could eat Jerry, he would always wait for their misadventures to end, grabbing Jerry and eating him, finally. His owners were proud of him only then.\n\nTom usually didn't hear much while he snacked on his friend, but last week, he had heard the shrieks and the snaps of Jerry's bones. The squelch of his heart bursting. The sprays of the metallic but salty blood.\n\nHe loved last week's episode. It was tasty, and he relished in that memory for the week.\n\nYet, it was Sunday once again.\n\n\"Jerry,\" Tom said as he walked towards the mouse hole.\n\n\"Wake up, it's time for the new episode, it's Sunday.\"\n\nBut Jerry didn't respond.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nHe looked into the hole to see Jerry's wife sobbing at a table.\n\n\"Ch\u00e9rie? Where's Jerry?\"\n\nShe stood up from their little kitchen table and began to yell at him. \"You- YOU KILLED HIM, TOM!\" she wailed. \"You ate him and- and-\" \n\nTom's eyes widened. \"But I always eat him-\"\n\n\"Sit down, Mom.\" A gray mouse Tom vaguely remembered as Jerry's son, Nibbles stepped to the door, although much older than when Tom had last seen him.\n\n\"Fuck off. I don't wanna see you at this house ever again, got it, asshole?\" \n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Got it?\"\n\n\"... I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"...\" Nibbles' face contorted into a scowl. \"Sorry? My father is *dead* because of you, Tom.\"\n\nNibbles began to close the door. \"There's no taking that back.\"\n\nAs the door shut, Tom stood up from his crouched positions and began to walk. He didn't know where, but he simply kept walking. He didn't care if he woke up next week, because clearly Jerry didn't. It seemed like his body was moving for him.\n\nTom kept walking till he arrived at the train station. \n\n\"Am I going to skip town?\"\n\nHe supposed so as he bought his ticket and walked to the platform. As he waited for the train, he thought about his situation. He had *killed someone.* Not just anyone, his best friend.\n\nTom couldn't handle that realization. That... That was too much for him. He chugged a few cans of milk as he waited more.\n\nAs he saw the train approach, he took a breath as the train braked and he took a step forward.\n\n...\n\nOff the platform and into the tracks where he was crushed by the train stopping on top of him.\n\nPolice later reported that they could not recognize the body so his mangled body (or the recoverable parts) were left in an unmarked grave, and that's how it stayed.\n\nUnmarked forever.",

            "comment": "Just as Dr.Evil-no good-doer of bad was about to slam his hand down on the giant red button, Mr.Supergood-awesomely amazing-definitley not a spider man ripoff swung into view. He flew into a tackle, and both he and the doctor went down. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you,\u201d Shouted Mr.Supergood-awesomely amazing-definitley not a spider man ripoff. \u201cThere are consquences to your actions now\u201d\n\nThis did not sway the doctor at all, in fact, he knew that better than anyone. The irony of it all brought a smile to the doctors face. One hidden from not a ripoffs view. If he had not been wearing a mask or a trench coat to hide his body language this likely would have been a very different story. \n\nBut instead not a rippoff went for a \u201cnon lethal\u201d takedown. He brought out one of his fresh pairs of handcuffs, he stopped using webs after he saw the horrible injury\u2019s inflicted in the aftermath, and put them in the doctor. By this point the doctor was using every ounce of his will power not to start cackling madly as he let himself be cuffed.\n\n \u201cLuckily I brought a gizmo-gadget-thingamabob-mccontraption-device. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop your doomsday weapon\u201d he said with a bright smile on his face. I mean why wouldn\u2019t he have one, he\u2019d stopped the villain and had no clue of his many grave errors. \u201cNow I know this is a new change to all of us, but you have to realize you cannot keep doing stuff like this it\u2019s dangerous\u201d he said squatting down to eye level with the doctor. \n\nHe looked straight into the eyes of the man. A strange tingle went down his spine as the fine doctor leaned forward \u201coh I know. I know better than anyone just how dangerous this could get. I mean how many times have you shot me with your webs, or swung down into a double kick? Do you know just how much those injury\u2019s could hurt? Oh well I guess you never will\u201d he reached over to his right despite his cuffs (not a rippoff had made the critical mistake of not actually hand cuffing him to anything) and pressed the \u201ccopyright notice button\u201d ending the world.\n\nThe doctors plan worked perfectly, the notice went out, pleasegiveusyormoney.inc got sued, and the impromptu season finale finished.",

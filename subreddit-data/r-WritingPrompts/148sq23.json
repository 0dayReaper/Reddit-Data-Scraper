The only difference is, now she's human, and earlier today she was a cat.\n\nShe shoots me a wayward glance as she rifles through the fridge, lifting a jug of milk and raising it to her lips. She squints her eyes at me as I stare at her with my jaw on the floor. After a moment, her eyes widen just like mine, and she glances down at her hands, then her feet.\n\n\"The polymorph wore off, didn't it?\"\n\nI am too awestruck to reply.\n\n\"O-okay don't freak out,\" She says, returning the jug to the fridge. \"I-I can explain.\"\n\n\"Please tell me you're not the cat I rescued,\" I say. \"Please tell me you just broke into my house and just happen to look like the cat I took in from the alleyway.\"\n\n\"I...I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Oh my god.\"\n\n\"Look, I can explain!\"\n\n\"Explain!?\" I ask. \"Three hours ago you were a cat!

            "comment": "When a loud noise wakes you up, you don't exactly wake up. There is no adjustment period, where you feel drowsy and disoriented. No. Something within your brain tells you that you need to be alert, and fast. \n\nThis was the situation I found myself in currently. Bolt upright in bed, eyes and ears open for any sound. Something had been dropped, perhaps a plate or a glass. Getting out of bed, just dressed in my underwear and a t-shirt, I slowly made my way downstairs.\n\nAs I opened the door to my room, I could hear mumbling and groans of annoyance. It sounded like a woman. How had she broken in? As I headed downstairs, I heard the fridge being opened. Why on earth was a home invader raiding my god damn fridge?! Approaching the door I saw a woman, dressed in all black. She was... Quite pretty, but that wasn't a concern. I threw the door open and yelled\n\"Asshole! The fuck are you doing in my house! Get out before I get the cops on you!\"\nThe woman jolted, and quickly slammed the fridge. She made eye contact, and looked bemused. With a curious face, and an innocent voice she asked\n\"But... Didn't you let me in?\"\n\nI blinked twice, out of utter confusion. My anger and fear was replaced by the sheer discombobulation of her statement.\n\"Wha- let you in? The hell do you mean let you in? You broke in y-\"\nI was cut off by the woman jumping up onto the worktop, followed by a puff of purplish black smoke... And in her place stood my cat, Roxie. My jaw hung open as I said to myself.\n\"I-I have officially gone mad, haven't I...\"\n\nThe cat gave a sharp, loud 'Meow' before jumping down onto the floor and transforming back into the woman who had broken in. \n\"No, you haven't, Katie. Not yet at least.\"\nI looked the woman in front of me up and down. She was human as it got. I shook my head, taking a seat at the kitchen table out of disbelief. I couldn't stand, not when... That had just happened.\n\n\"What the actual fuck are you?\"\nThe woman looked offended, giving an almighty huff of annoyance as she made eye contact.\n\"I'm a shapeshifter, dumbass. You're not the brightest bulb are you?\"\nI shook my head, raising my hand to give this woman a one fingered salute, not saying a word. 'Roxy' looked even more offended, and said\n\"Well, considering the fact that I'm here already... Want that sandwich I was making?\"\n\nI looked to get worktop near the sink. There was indeed a half made sandwich. I nodded shakily and asked.\n\"You couldn't have made this known to me at any other time?\"\nRoxy shrugged and said sarcastically\n\"You forgot to feed me, idiot.\"\nClearly this one was full of sass, but I was no stranger to it, even in a shaken up state.\n\"Sure, whatever. But like... Couldn't you have made it known earlier? You've been here for damn near a week...\"\nRoxy chuckled and went over to her sandwich, continuing to make it as she spoke.\n\"Needed to... Make sure of something.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, and that is...?\"\nRoxy chuckled in amusement and said with a shit-eating grin\n\n\"Well, you're not gonna believe this, but... You're a demoness.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" I asked, bewildered.\n\n\"A demon. Yknow the... Ones from hell? Reside in the core of earth, only accessible through demonic magic, all of that?\"\nShe was explaining it like it was obvious. I wasn't Christian, but I knew the religion well enough to conclude that what Roxy was saying was *not* what usually happens in the Bible.\n\n\"I- what? Prove it!\".\nThere it was. How was she supposed to prove it, when the statement was so clearly false. Roxy held out her hand, palm up. With an annoying smirk, she ordered.\n\"Put your hand in mine, palm down.\"\nSo I did, and her fingers encased my hand. I looked up at Roxy, and raised and eyebrow suspiciously. She then took it away, and snapped her fingers. \n\n\"Yeah yeah, that didn't wo- What the fuck?!\"\nI looked at my hand. The skin was red. A bright, blood red. I felt dizzy. How was she doing that? Why was I red?.\n\"Uh-huh. Told you. Cmon, look in the mirror.\"\nRoxy slipped out a quickly makeup mirror, and held it up for me to see. I grabbed it out of her hands, and inspected my face. My hair was raven-black, and down past my shoulders to about halfway down by back. My skin was crimson, and my eyes were a deep amber. Hell, I even had horns!\n\"W-why? How?\"\nI asked, as I put a clawed hand to my face and ran my fingers down my cheek.\n\nRoxy took back her mirror, and folded it shut. She slipped it into her pocket and shrugged.\n\"You were outcasted. You've lived exactly a thousand and one lives. You ever gotten D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Yeah, that'd be the your previous lives colliding in some way, usually thorough strong emotion.\"\nI ran my tongue over my teeth. Fangs. I felt so bewildered.\n\"Okay i- sure, I'm a demon I guess.\"\n\n\"Yep, you are.\"\nWith that, Roxy transformed back into her cat form and left the room, unexplained. I got up, and tried to follow her. I suddenly felt dizzy, and my feet felt like they were encased in lead. I collapsed, and fell onto the floor. \n\nSuddenly, I was back awake. I panted, sitting upright in my underwear and a t-shirt. I gasped, and said out loud to myself.\n\"Okay, okay... Just a dream... Just a dream...\"\nI brought a hand up to brush some hair out of my face. A red, clawed hand...",

The glow of the fridge behind her illuminated each curled strand of her poofy hair. I stood there staring at her, dumbfounded. Her hand slowly started to reach back into the fridge before she looked back and started to rummage around.\r  \n\u201cNo, stop that, what? What do you mean you\u2019ve been here for a week? I think I would have noticed some homeless woman squatting in my house.\u201d\r  \nShe kept rummaging through the fridge. \u201cI wasn\u2019t squatting, you kidnapped me. And I\u2019m not homeless, I\u2019m just traveling. \u201dShe pulled out some bread, ham, cheese, and mustard and set it all on the counter. She was wearing some ratty dress. It was dirty and well worn. It was never a fine dress; it probably started its life as some kind of bohemian gown. The dress had no sleeves and was made from a dark dull orange canvas material. She looked young, probably in her early to mid-twenties. She was tan and speckled. And she was making a sandwich very casually, in my house. \r  \n\u201cCan you stop and take this seriously; you have to see where I am coming from. A stranger just appeared in my house in the middle of the night, is stealing my food, and is refusing to explain anything, while accusing me of kidnapping them.\u201d My annoyance and concern crept into my voice. She looked up from her sandwich without moving her head, set the butter knife down before fully looking at me. \r  \n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll explain why I\u2019m here, but don\u2019t call the cops. I\u2019ll take off soon enough.\u201d She put some ham on the bread. \u201cBut first, do you have any pickles?\u201d\r  \n\u201cUh, yeah, there\u2019s a fresh jar in the cupboard there.\u201d\r  \n\u201cDope.\u201d\r  \nShe got the pickles, opened the jar and spooned the pickles onto the sandwich, layered some cheese, slapped a bread slice on top, and then took a big triumphant bite. \u201cAlright, so, the first thing you should know is that I 'm your cat.\u201d",

            "comment": "\"Aghnnnh!!!\" \n\nA groan of relief exited my mouth with the orchestra of my bones crackling as I stretched my arms. I had been sitting in the chair for an hour, completing the presentation for tomorrow's HR meeting.\n\nI laid my head in the neckrest of the chair and stared in the ceiling just looking at the wall and keeping my mind blank after the overload of the day. Just looking at the spots and imperfections soothed my brain and I felt relaxed as ever. I just looked at it until..\n\n*Sigh!!!* \n\nFollowed by my eye getting teary. \n\n\"I guess it's time to sleep. I can't leave a room for error for the big day\".\n\nI opened the blanket ,tucked the pillow, checked if the bottle of water was full , changed into my pajamas and then entered my peaceful sleeping abode. As I was about to play in the garden of my dreams..\n\n*Ruffle* *Ruffle*\n\nThe noise startled me and woke me up. And with that a realisation also hit me..\n\n\"Oh right! The cat.\"\n\nEarlier, I had brought in a guest to my lair. A cute little furry with eyes as hypnotic as a shiny pearl with as many colours as the stars in the sky. She seemed to have been left outside in the cold winter outside the grocery store. I couldn't let such being in a harsh weather so I welcomed her in, left her in the living room with some food and then entered my room to complete the presentation. \n\nI forgot to treat my guest and it seems like they might be angry and are showing the sign of  their discomfort.\n\nSo, I rushed out of my room into the kitchen to repent for my digression but then I saw something unfamiliar. \n\n\"Who are you? How did you enter my house?\",I said to the shillouete of presumably a woman who was digging into my refrigerator.\n\n\"HEY! Answer me or I'll call the authorities.\"\n\n\"Meow. That's a rude way to treat your guest.\", said the woman as she turned her head and approached towards me.\n\n*Gasp* \n\nThe woman was a beautiful being that any words cannot describe but one thing stood out. Her eyes, they were the same as the cat's, with more colours than the stars the sky yet in such a harmony that each was distinct from the others.\n\n\"No way. The woman was the cat!\"",

            "comment": "My eyes shot open. I turned over and sat straight up, staring toward my bedroom door. I gripped my sheets and sat there frozen. Somehow, in the middle of my dream, I distinctly heard the sound of my refrigerator opening. The line of light beneath my door split the darkness and any doubt I had about it cleanly in two.\n\nThere was someone in my apartment.\n\nI reached for my nightstand, not for a gun, but for my phone. Not even a week ago, I had been talking to my cousin about buying a gun for home defense. But I kept putting it off and now all I had was a dead device in my hands. I tapped helplessly at the screen before holding down the button on the side. A picture of a dead battery appeared briefly before leaving me in the dark again.\n\nNo weapon.\n\nNo way to call the cops.\n\nI held my breath as I slid out of bed. I moved for my dresser and pulled it quietly open, removing from it a wooden baton with a lead filling. My mother had made it in wood shop when she was in high school, and I kept it after she passed away. It was a family heirloom at this point, but it would potentially serve me well tonight. I moved for the door and slowly pulled it open. It creaked loudly into the darkened home and I cursed under my breath. I had been meaning to oil up the hinges with some WD-40, but hadn't gotten around to it.\n\nAt the end of the hall in the kitchen, the form of woman whirled around to face me. Her form eclipsed the light of the open fridge and yet I could still somehow see her eyes shining like that of an animal in the dark. She didn't appear to be armed. I found it notable that she seemed to relax when she saw me. I moved slowly out into the kitchen, my baton raised and my eyes trained on her. She had long black hair, a slender build, and was completely naked.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I called out to her as I circled around the counter. \"How did you get in here?\"\n\n\"Nice undies,\" she said casually as she gently closed the refrigerator door with her foot. The shine of her eyes was the last thing I saw before darkness enveloped the room.\n\n\"Get near me and I won't hold back!\" I shouted with the most intimidating voice I could muster. \"I mean it! I'm not fucking around!\" I gripped the baton tightly as I backed away, hitting the couch and the coffee table as I peered into the dark.\n\nI heard a meow beneath my feet and jumped so high I was lucky the ceiling fan wasn't spinning. I had completely forgotten about the cat I had picked up outside the grocery store. I pulled it together long enough to turn on the lamp next to the sofa. The room was illuminated\u2013 and empty.\n\nMy heart thumped as I scanned the room for the woman. I carefully cleared every room of the apartment one by one before making sure both the front door and the back door were securely locked. I let my shoulders drop and set down the baton on the kitchen counter. There was no way I imagined it. I even heard her speak to me. If it was a hallucination, I needed to see a doctor. Had I dreamed it and woken up in a tired stupor?\n\nI fell down onto the sofa and exhaled deeply. The cat jumped up onto the coffee table and took a seat across from me. Her irises were narrow slits and she seemed relatively calm for a stray cat in a new environment watching her new owner have a mental breakdown at 2am. Somehow that calmed me down too.\n\n\"You didn't see nobody come in here, did ya kitty?\" I asked out loud.\n\n\"Nope,\" she responded.\n\nI leaped off the couch and looked around the room for the source of the voice, my adrenaline spiking for the third time in five minutes. My eyes then fell to the cat\u2013 there was no other explanation.\n\n\"Just me,\" she added, blinking slowly.\n\n\"Oh, God,\" I whined on the brink of tears. \"I *am* going crazy.\"\n\n\"Not as crazy as you think,\" replied the cat as I paced around the room.\n\n\"Aww, geez. I knew it ran in my family, but *this* young?\" I whimpered.\n\n\"Hey,\" the cat called my attention. \"Tough guy. Down here.\"\n\nI wiped my hands over my face. \"I shouldn't even be driving, let *alone* working in childcare.\"\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nI turned to see the naked woman I thought I had imagined. She was making a no-nonsense expression and staring me dead in the eyes. Her irises were still slits like that of a cat's, but more lemon-shaped; the kind you see before they smack you with their paw. I lifted my arms in a defensive stance and stared at her with my mouth wide open.\n\n\"Shut up,\" she said flatly. \"You're not cracked up. Not yet.\"\n\n\"... Kitty?\" I asked, lowering my arms.\n\nShe sighed and rolled her eyes. \"Yeah. Kitty,\" she folded her arms, partially hiding her exposed breasts. \"But you can call me Rennathae... *after* you get me some clothes.\"\n\nx - - x - - x - - \u2605 - - x - - x - - x\n\nShe sat in the recliner, one leg crossed over the other and her hands folded in her lap. She was wearing one of my old T-shirts and a pair of basketball shorts I hadn't worn since I ran track.\n\n\"Ren-ath-ay?\" I sounded it out. \"Is that right?\"\n\n\"Renn, if it helps,\" she winced. \"Is my name truly difficult for you?\"\n\n\"A lot of syllables,\" I scratched the back of my head. \"I'm sorry, explain to me again why I'm not sitting in a padded cell.\"\n\n\"Because dear,\" she smiled. \"You haven't told anyone about me yet. If you don't want to be fitted with one of those neat little restrictive jackets, you'll keep it that way.\"\n\nI swallowed hard. \"R-right. And you're here... why?\"\n\n\"Because you picked me up outside of the store, remember?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I get that, but... you *chose* me.\" I held eye contact. \"You walked right up to me and put both your paws\u2013 err... hands,\" I corrected myself. \"Right on my left leg. Then you meowed at me.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" she looked up at the ceiling. \"Is *that* how it happened?\"\n\n\"Hey,\" I spoke assertively. \"Answers. What's going on here?\"\n\nShe rested her head on her closed fist against the arm of the chair and looked at me pitifully. \"You don't remember?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"Stop playing games with me and just tell me what's going on.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes as though I had woken *her* up at 2am. \"I wish I knew,\" she said finally. \"You and I were thick as thieves in the world we came from. You were my witch and I was your familiar. We sailed the seas as pirates. Marauded around the wastes as scavs. We found the castle in the clouds and set free the eye that sees. We did it all together.\"\n\nI sat in stupefied silence.\n\n\"We were doing something important... and now we're here. I had to follow your aura to find you. You're a man now for some reason\u2013 a gangly one, at that. Not our type at all.\"\n\n\"You've... You have to be lying to me,\" I said finally. \"I was a witch?\"\n\n\"A powerful one too,\" she sighed. \"Now you're... whatever this is.\"\n\n\"Greg.\"\n\n\"I hate it,\" her face soured.\n\nI didn't believe it. It sounded too fantastical. But my cat just turned into a woman in my apartment. I stared down at the rug.\n\n\"... I hate it too,\" I said, lifting my eyes. \"But if what you're saying is true... do you know what to do?\"\n\nShe examined her fingernails casually. \"I might be the only one who does.\"\n\nI laughed nervously to myself and leaned back into the sofa. \"You're so lucky I didn't have a gun.\"\n\n\"Oh, Roaze,\" she smiled. \"You never would have gotten around to buying bullets.\"\n\nr/A15MinuteMythos",

I was considering my options and figured i'd grab something to defend myself woth just in case. I began reaching for a spatula, the only thing i could realistically grab without alerting her. Just as my fingers were about to touch it, the woman turned, a panicked expression on her face. \n\n\"Wait!\" She said, holding up her hands and backing away from my fridge, \"I...I was going to tell you soon but I-I...I didn't know how to...  Please don't hurt me.\" \n\nI grabbed the spatula still and held it in front of me, brandishing it like a sword. \"Who are you? Why are you in my kitchen and what exactly were you going to tell me?\"\n\nThe woman swallowed and opened her mouth, but closed it again, not finding the words to speak. Before finally seeming to decide to tell me plainly: \"I'm your cat. I was in your kitchen because I was hungry and i was going to tell you tomorrow what i really am.\"\n\n\"You're my-...WHAT!?\" I lowered the spatula, struggling to fully grasp the words that had just left her mouth. \"Are you- Is my-...WHAT!?\"\n\n\"I'm your cat.\" She said again. \"I am an ancient creature, largely extinct, capable of adapting our shape to the two most dominant mamals on the earth.

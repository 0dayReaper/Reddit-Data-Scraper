            "comment": "Despite being two and a half years old, Jerry the Third stood proud and erect, holding his toothpick-fashioned walking cane in the air. The small cavern in this chamber of the intricate mousehole tunnel system was more than enough space for him to draw on the wooden wall while his son Jerry the Third Jr watched on.\n\nOn the wall, he\u2019d drawn a crude scribble of a cat with demon horns. It was a very ugly cat. Using his cane, he made sure to point out the evil horns, then the cat\u2019s sharp claws, and ending with his big mean face. Jerry Jr needed to see the enemy he was up against.\n\nTurning away from his son, Jerry the Third used the broken piece of chalk in his other hand to write in big bold letters, **TOM**. This was the formidable rival that had plagued the Jerry family for countless generations - an entire three generations now, in fact. Jerry the Third made sure to emphasize this by mimicking an angry, scary face with outstretched claws. The effect was slightly diminished because he didn\u2019t actually have claws.\n\nAfter that, he used a piece of ripped paper to wipe away the chalk. Then he drew another picture with the same cat, except now the cat was chasing a mouse. Jerry pretended to faint. Then he recovered and hurriedly erased the drawing. With a quick flourish of his hands, this time he drew the same cat and mouse, but now with the mouse chasing the cat.\n\nJerry somehow stood prouder than he already was and held his cane out in front of him like it was a fine rapier. With a few deft slashing motions, he showed Jerry Jr exactly how to deal with the big bad cat. His swordsmanship, a skill honed from years of cat-fighting, was a source of great pride.\n\nFor the remainder of his lesson, he showed how to avoid mouse traps, call for help from the family dog, and escape from certain death in many wildly different ways. With a final slash of his cane, he set the toothpick on the ground and sighed, shaking his head. Years of grief, pain, and sorrow flashed across his eyes for the briefest moment, and he slumped his shoulders wearily. Even giving this demonstration was taking its toll on the old mouse who had spent his entire life fighting.\n\nSuddenly, his ears perked up as they caught a faint sound. Jerry the Third jerked his head up and squinted suspiciously at Jerry Jr. With a few stomps over to where his son was watching, the old mouse made a quick grab with his hands. Alas, it was just as he had feared! Jerry Jr had taped hand-drawn eyes to his face, and under his mask, he was soundly asleep.\n\n---\n\nr/OracleOfCake ^for ^inconsistent ^stories",

In fact, the phrase 'proud and erect' is often used to describe heroes, warriors, and soldiers, to show that they are brave or heroically resisting some foe. It means they're standing tall and alert. When you think of someone standing up straight, you could say they are standing proud and erect.\n\nIt's usually used to show that they're well disciplined or not scared, that they're unbent, unbowed, and unbroken, as opposed to someone who is craven, quaking, or cringing before a threat.\n\nThe usage *you're* thinking of carries the same meaning. When a penis gets erect, it too is standing tall and rigid and alert.",

            "comment": "\"You're trapped now, little idiot,\" the cat said, feeling another wave of exhaustion, of a sudden pointlessness to everything, descend over him. What was that? He would have to figure it out later.\n\nThe young mouse turned around from the screen door. The cat was right. He was trapped.\n\n\"What do you want?\" the mouse asked, as he always did. But this time was a little different.\n\nThe cat opened his mouth to speak a familiar threat. But something in the mouse's gaze, normally so defiant, was different.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" the cat asked instead.\n\nThe mouse turned, and looked outside. \"All my life, my father never made it outside. And now he's too weak to move.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"So why did he stay inside his whole life?\" the little mouse asked.\n\nTom had no answer.\n\n\\-\n\n\"The little one is like you were,\" Tom said quietly.\n\nJerry chuckled. \"He's like me. A rule is just something to be broken to him.\"\n\n\"If he was left on his own, he'll be outside in no time.\"\n\nJerry shook his head, and fell into another violent coughing fit. \"You know he can't, Tom.\"\n\nTom had nothing else to say.\n\n\"Tom. Promise me.\"\n\n\"I've done it so many times, Jerry.\"\n\n\"Promise me again. I want to hear it, one last time.\"\n\n\"Ok, Jerry. I won't let your son fall into any sort of danger. I will chase him and occupy him with entertainment in the house so he forgets all about the outside. I'll keep him safe.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nTom looked at his greatest foil, who had become his greatest friend. Not too long ago the mouse had been shiny, sleek and endlessly fidgety. Now, laying on his little bed of dust, he looked very different indeed.\n\n\"You never wanted to go outside, Jerry? Really?\"\n\n\"Of course I did. Even knowing how unsafe it is for me,\" the old mouse said. \"But really, we had all we needed here, right?\"\n\nTom said nothing again. Somewhere in that dark silence, Jerry laughed, thinking of some memory, and then he was gone.\n\n\\-\n\nJerry Jr. stood at the open door to the backyard, looking at the moon, as he did many nights. Tom stopped in his tracks. The little mouse looked so much like his father had.\n\n*And one day, I'm going to lose him too.* Tom put the thought out of his head, and joined the child.\n\n\"It's not safe for you here. So close to...the outside.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Uncle. I won't leave.\"\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"It looks like a huge ball of cheese, doesn't it? What do you think it tastes like?\"\n\nTom had never fully understood the beauty of the moon. It probably had something to do with the cheese thing, because to him it had always looked like a dumb, huge white ball he could never get to.\n\nBut tonight, it looked more lustrous than ever, like some great comfort and mystery awaited there.\n\n\"I want to go there one day, Uncle Tom,\" Jerry Jr said, his father's mischievous glint in his eye. \"Don't you?\"\n\nTom looked at the moon. Then he thought of his friend, and what he had not said in their final moments together.\n\n*I'm sorry, my friend.* *But I have to go. This place...it reminds me too much of you. And besides...*\n\n\"Rules are meant to be broken, right, kiddo?\" Tom said. And to his surprise, as he did so, he couldn't help but smile, feeling an old excitement come back to him, something he had last felt when he and his best friend had been a little cat and mouse...\n\nAnd he walked through the door, and into the world, at last.\n\n\\-\n\n[r/penguin347](https://reddit.com/r/penguin347)",

I remember my mom standing next to Pap, stoic and calm, ready to reach out to him if he needed support. I was young then, but I remember that Pap seemed fine. Not even sad. Tired, maybe. Even by then, he had already seen too much.\n\n\u201cTwenty years,\u201d he repeated. He rubbed his face. \u201cIt\u2019s too long.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know, Pap.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to face him when I\u2019m gone, son.\u201d\n\nI swallowed. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I know I have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty years,\u201d he said again, barely audible. Pap got stuck sometimes, in his memories. His sentences skipped like a trilling piano key. He wasn\u2019t as fast or as clever as he had been in his youth.\n\n\u201cYou have to stop him,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCatch him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, Pap.\u201d\n\nI had always known, even before my father\u2019s death, what destiny awaited me. My grandpa had been protecting our family from the abomination for twenty years. He dedicated his entire life to it, just as his father did, and his grandfather did.\n\nCats only live about fifteen to twenty years. \n\nMice are only supposed to live for three.",

            "comment": "\u201cDad, why do you keep on going out there? you know he is going to hurt you.\u201d Asked my son. \nI knew this conversation had been coming for a while. \u201cSit down, its time I tell you the truth\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all started 24 changes ago. Your grandfather and grandmother managed to get into the city after a really long Cold change. Your Grandmother was at the time pregnant with me and your uncle and your other uncle and your 3 aunties. So your grandfather carved this glorious house out of his bare hands. It took 9 changes to fully construct. It would have taken less time, but he entered into the deal. \n\nFor you see, at this time a sick little boy was gifted a cat. The Cat he called Tom. The boy was too sick to leave his bed so Tom did everything he could to cheer him up. The boy had a dog, so the cat tried to act like a clown and get the dog to chase him, but the dog was tied to his house. So the dog was pulled back like he was being pulled. The boy laughed the first time, but, he could only see a bit of it as he was stuck in his bed. \n\nSo desperate, Tom the Cat one day found your grandfather. As Tom was a cat, a demon, your grandfather ran and Tom followed. Your Grandfather was too fast and managed to trick him into running into a frying pan he had taken from the kitchen. The frying pan was hit with such force that an imprint of atoms face was left. The boy, from one of the wall eyes saw this and laughed. Tom noticed that the boy had been made so happy by this. And so a deal was reached. \u201cThey would do this everyday until they both died.\u201d\n\nYour grandfather upheld his promise and more, whilst the rest of my brothers and sisters were allowed to leave, I bore too strong of a resemblance for my grandfather to resist what he would do next. For you see my dad was too old to continue this game. He wanted to retire and enjoy his final changes. He just refused to break his promise to Tom. Tom believes to this day that I am my father. \n\nThe boy we did this for unfortunately left us on my 7th change. Tom lived in denial. He continues to live in denial. I tried to talk to him but he told me that we had to keep on making the kid laugh. So we did. For years and years we performed for a silent audience. On some level I believe Tom knows the truth, he just hasn\u2019t admitted it yet. So for my oldest friend son, I ask you the same thing my father asked me. Let me enjoy my last few changes. Let me and your mother see another city. Can you please do what I can no longer do and take the part of Jerry in the endless play: Tom and Jerry. Do it for Tom and do it for the silent audience. You never know, you might just change someone\u2019s life. \u201c",

            "comment": "  \n\nIts was night, and the pale moon light bathed the kitchen table as the hot summer wind move the translucid curtains atop the sink. \n\nSiting in one the chairs was the old dog, his strength traded for wisdon, and this night, as many nights before he was there to witness. On opposite sides of the table stood two long time rivals. The cat stood tall, his tail, starting to turn gray, swinging slowly side to side, while in front stood the rat, already way past his prime, the once agile boddy give place to this old husk, his left eye now nothing but a vicious scar.\n\n*-****Produce the child***. Said Spike the dog. \n\nWith a hand motion, Jerry III called forth his only son, his legacy. \n\n\\-***We are gather here tonight to renew the vows between two sworn enemies. As per tradicion, the parties must recite the contract of the hunt on a full moon. You can begin when you are ready.*** \n\nPushing down his fears in face of the hungry feline eyes, Jerry IV started.\n\n\\-***I, Jerry the IV accept the contract of the hunt. To fight with cunning, bravery, trickery and any other method in my disposal to win****.*\n\n*-****I, Tom the cat accept the contract of the hunt. To fight with cunning, bravery, trickery and any other method in my disposal to win, and to eat you.*** **Said Tom with a enormous grim on his face.**\n\n**-*****Very well, the pact is conclude, may the best win, and try not to cause so much ruckus, im to old to be beating the two of you****.* Finished Spike while leaping from the chair and leaving the kitchen.\n\n\\-***Good luck kid. Hope you last as long as your old man there.*** **Said Tom, doing the same.**\n\n\\-***Get Bent cat! Come on son, lets go****.* \n\nThe silence of the night fell over the two as they made their way back home, until Jerry III started speaking again.\n\n\\-***You did good son, very good. I remember when i made the vow, about your age, my dad couldn't come with me, because Tom had rip his left leg of but he was very proud of me, just as im proud of you.***\n\n***-Dad...Can\u2019t we do anything else? Go somewhere new, leave this game behind?***\n\n*-****What?! Never! This is our legacy, is in our blood! Three generations of Jerry fought that cat to the bitter and! That Bastard may have took my eye but i took his took! H\u00e1!*** **Said Jerry rising his fist in the air.**\n\nPassing the halls inside the kitchen wall, Jerry IV observed the drawings of his forebears. Drawing of his Greatgranfather, the first to challenge the cat.\n\n\u00ad-***You may have doubts now, but you will see. The thrills that comes with every trat, every trick, every frying pan to the face. Tomorrow you begin your story son, tomorrow you will fight that cat, and everything will make sense.***",

            "comment": "\"This Tommy puts up a good fight, you gotta give him that. Years of being fed like a king have done nothing to him\", said old Jerry III in his father's traditional military uniform. It was a blue coat with dozens of medals, resembling small pieces of cheese and mousetraps. The words were all jumbled up and flowed into each other, as years of fighting had made him a little too fond of the booze. Walking unsteadily to the old glass cabinet, he intended to show his son the greatest of his trophies: One of Tom's claws. \"Ahh, look at it yourself, these bones are better off being spared this small trip.\"\n\nDropping back into bed and taking a sip from his flask, he goes on. \"I left half a life's energy in that fight, and that big old boy got away losing only one of his claws. But see, my son, this is what makes us great.\" Looking up to the ceiling, he conveyed a sense of sentimentality. One of the deeply satisfied looks almost making an old, strong mouse cry. \n\n\"The slanted odds of battle, giving everything just for a scratch of that fat cat's eternity. This claw gave me more lifeblood and respect in our community than anything else I have done in my life. No other deed legitimized my rule over our swarm more. They've seen me brimming over with vitality, energy and charisma. True, honest, and talented fighters in our notoriously deceitful species; this is what we are supposed to be.\" He struggled to take off his jacket while on the bed, but after a few hard jerks on its arms he finally got it off. And, weak from this physical exercise, held it up for his son to take.\n\n\"Jerry, my son, this is yours. I know I did not raise you a fighter, and I know that your soft, delicate claws are not meant for battle. But you are my son, my blood. The whole swarm respects you, they will follow you. They understand. Keep up the fight, and join me in heaven. Godspeed, my son.\" And with his last breath, he uttered \"I love you.\"\n\nJerry IV got up from a chair in the dark corner of the room, grabbed the coat - And so began the tragic downfall of the Jerry-dynasty.",

I won\u2019t be able to hold up my position as leading mouse any longer. Your time has come.\u201d Anxiously, young Jerry the fourth leans in closer to his fathers mouth. How many times had he dreamed about this day, finally being allowed to see the outside house. Ever since his dad had shown him the light of the many pears outside their small door, he\u2019d been looking forward to explore the mysteries. But now that the day has come, he\u2019d given anything to get just a few more light circles with his father. \u201cI know you will honor our name, Jerry\u201d his father went on. \u201cEvery night I told you about my expeditions, about wonders and horrors you\u2019ll find out there. Be brave, and fight the dangers, and you will bring home your first barrel of cheese yourself.\u201d Thinking about this golden treasure, Jerry could not help but flick hos tongue a little. Cheese. The ultimate goal. Guarded by the ultimate idiot. \u201cSon, I have told you stories about the local cat. But don\u2019t be fooled. He might not be the brightest pear in the whole outside house, but his weapons are still dangerous, deadly even. You will become the next explorer, but this position brings great responsibility. The whole family relies on you. I rely on you.\u201d Jerry the fourths has to blink his eyes a little. If anything happened to him, his daughter Jerry the fifth would have to take over. In his head, he vowes to protect her, whatever it may cost. And to bring the biggest amount of cheese home any Jerry ever got. \u201cI will protect your legacy, dad\u201d, Jerry the fourth whispers, and kisses his fathers cheek. \u201cI will make you proud\u201d.",

            "comment": "The greatest regret in the life of Jerry III - the most decorated rat to have ever lived in the walls of 23C, MG Road - was that he would die before Thomas, the resident cat of the same house.\n\nHe could hardly move around without assistance, which is why he had resorted to living in a corner of the small residence the local rat family had built for itself. There was a stream of water leaking from the pipes which ran through their area. He had settled close enough to this spot to take a bath once in a while without too much effort. Reverence greeted him everywhere he went. The reputation he had built for himself over the two and a half years of his life were more than enough to make everyone believe he was the closest manifestation of divinity they could ever see. He had engaged with the cat in multiple showdowns. He had escaped from countless mouse traps, innumerous assault attempts with household items, and almost an infinite number of amateur bombings. Sometimes, the other mouses thought it was a miracle the house itself still stood.\n\nJerry IV currently stood near his father, who in all likeliness was on his deathbed. He had lived a glorious life, but now it was time to depart from this life. It had presented its share of fun and trouble. He told his son the same.\n\n\"I lived a great life, son, a great one. Not because I earned a name in the community, or because I defied the odds so many times.\"\n\nHis son looked at him, a bit confused.\n\n\"You know Thomas well enough. The old cat will die soon too. So it'll be no great scandal if it breaks out, but please don't tell this to anyone but him the next time you meet the overweight pussy.\"\n\nJerry IV continued looking at his father, who leaned forward after taking a breath which would turn out to be his last. With a smile on his face, he almost whispered - \"I had myself a great time with that bastard.\"",

            "comment": "Many months later, Jerry IV would remember his proud old father explain to him with unrivaled passion the importance of not only besting the carnivorous creature, but ridiculing the base mammal to the point of borderline hilarity.   He remembered the familiar smell of rotting wood inside of their quaint home; impossibly narrow but with the nostalgic gravity that one could not help but hold back the great gasps of cries deep inside oneself.\n\n\u201cThat bastard has been a nuisance since my grandfather\u2019s time, and I will roll over myself in piss and shit before I see that stupid creature defy our will on this land\u201d would say Jerry IV\u2019s father, aptly named Jerry III.  \n\nHis father, now on what would be referred to as his deathbed, would tell him stories of the grandiose battles not only he would have with Tom the Bastard, but that of Jerry II\u2019s as well.  The times when Jerry III would drop hot melted wax from the candles that would smell of autumn\u2019s air; the times when Jerry III would defecate indiscriminately all over the bastard cat\u2019s midday meal; the times when Jerry III would see his father, with incredulous fortune, nibble on the leather monolith so believably like the bastard cat that the giants of the land would reprimand the creature and not Jerry II.  \n\n\u201cOne day you will have sons, that in turn themselves have sons\u201d would say Jerry III \u201cbut never forget that our family\u2019s will is to one day best that good for nothing bastard\u201d \n\nThat was the last conversation Jerry IV had with his father, and now, looking back to it, he cried for half a day.  He did not cry from the death of his father, or for the pointlessness of trying to defy a bastard like Tom, he cried from the security he felt to his narrow home.  The home that held the qualities of a womb that could never be found in the simple sport of ridiculing a meandering buffoon.",

He looked from the spoils\n\nof my victory to the viscera covering my fur and said, \u201cWhat\n\nhave you done?\u201d I was shocked. How could he be upset?\n\nI\u2019ve been the best student.

I tried to ease my pain and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nPapa sighed and pointed his paw to door. I took my time, eyeing\n\nthe entrance while papa indulged in an infinite\n\namount of crumbs. I poked my head out the port and was greeted\n\nby a *HISS!* I fell back flailing, scrambling from the hole in the wood\n\nand just barely escaped the claw. What the hell is this? A ghost?\n\nPapa laughed as he poked the protruding arm with the pointy\n\nend of his cane, causing it to retreat. Relief swept over me\n\nas he closed the door behind the demon claw. Papa smiled\n\nat me and moved towards the cheese as he said, \u201cToday\u2019s\n\nlesson, my boy, is they always get another cat!\u201d",

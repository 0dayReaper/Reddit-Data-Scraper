            "comment": "\nThe coverlet stuck to my skin wherever it touched. It looked to be fine silk, ordinarily sewn, though nothing was what it seemed in La Silhouette. The vintage of the wine in the adjoining restaurant, let alone the year stamped into the stones along the exterior, were more a charade of luxury than the real thing. This was the kind of place your brought an escort on a budget, in your suit of fine polyesters, ordinarily made. \n\nThe sex was real. That much was certain. The perks of this job were beneath the sheets, however cheap the bedding. The comfort of an escort in Montreal is relative to the price they pay. You paid as much for me as you might for your first car. More often than not, I was the first escort that my clients were like to hire. Husbands of destitute marriages travelling to the freer city across the river, across the border, to experience someone they thought they once had, chasing the ghost of a made-up past full of love and excitement. After the first bite, they quickly moved to prostitutes, disillusioned and horny. \n\nYou can usually tell what kind of a marriage a man is in by the tone of his email. The first email always reads the same way--polite, yet masked in sexual appetite and and come-forward attitude best left reserved for La Bombe at last call. It was not a place you wanted to be, but a place you find yourself without knowing why. \n\nThe second email was what defined them. What they wanted, when they wanted it, how much they could pay for it. Nothing flattering, nothing superficial, just straight brass tax. Their whole married life was told in that second email, whether the marriage was failing due to money, sex, or simple lack of passion. Usually it was sex.\n\nMr. Chicago was different. His first email read like a loan agreement, full of everything but emotion. All the details of his request were laid out like a whore lined up at the gates, and all without even the presumption of intimacy. Here was a man who had bought a car before, and on his own money no doubt. Yet if it was sex or lack of passion the mister lacked, he made no show of it. \n\n*Double your regular pay to pretend to be my banking colleague.*\n\nThat much to sit across a table and talk assets and dividends. I was hooked, and found myself filling in the sultry aspects of our conversation that Mr. Chicago had left out. \n\n*I'd prefer you in a suit. I'll see you soon. Look official.*\n\nI pulled the coverlet up to the nape of my neck. *I felt more naked in that suit than I do now.* It was so well made, it might as well have been bet on. It was likely I would never wear it again--though seeing as all costs were included in Mr. Chicago's outline, I was likely not to care. The modest light-charcoal skirt was not something most husbands cared to see on a business trip. \n\nI met Mr. Chicago outside of business hours in the seemingly classy restaurant of La Silhouette. The sky was grey and greyer, though inside the restaurant the light was a warm tease of gold and orange. Champagne chair and champagne tablecloths were laid out in the room, and champagne buckets and champagne bottles adorned them. Ours was rosy, almost purple in colour, and the top was a twist-off that the waiter obliged to open. \n\nMr. Chicago was late, though he walked in to the room as if he was always on time. I watched him adjust his suite coat and tie in the foyer and then flick a strand of hair behind his ears. *He isn't half ugly* I thought. After a few words with the matron, he spun toward the open archway of the room and cantered in decidedly. He gazed about in search of his actor, more highly paid than most. \n\nHe couldn't remember where he had told me to sit, that much was clear. As he made his way through the tables, he bumped several of the other patrons. One table, a man and a women in obvious dissatisfaction, was clearly annoyed at the intrusion, though they seemed to be clearly annoyed at most everything. The single man seated at the table closest to us simply ignored Mr. Chicago and continued to sip on water, the champagne bottle unopened on the table in front of him. \n\nI put on a face of pleasure and greeted my jockey for the night. He was peppered in the beard, but well trimmed. His hair was well-greased, and his musk hinted of sweat and clothes and tobacco. His eyes were deep and dark, and mesmerizing. *These are the eyes of a man out to seduce me.* I put on a face much the same in return, and winked coyly as I smirked and introduced myself.\n\n\"Mr. Chicago, it was so wonderful for you to treat me to dinner this evening. You must be exhausted from travel.\"\n\nHe suddenly looked confused. *Did I say something wrong?* He had given me a list of details and items to talk about, and his travel arrangements had been chief among them. \"Yes, my travels. They were quite exhausting. And I'm sure yours were just as tiresome. Did you come by train?\"",

                    "comment": "*What does he want me to say?* \"Yes, I arrived early this afternoon. Fortunately the construction in Toronto was completed last week.\" That seemed to disarm him. *Thank God for public broadcasting.* If he wanted me to lie about everything, he came to the lost well-informed liar on the block. An escort hired to lie is like a poker shark hired to gamble. \n\n\"How is your family? Is Chelsea settled in to her new school?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's loving it. She misses her friends, of course, but she'll find new ones. But of course, you would know all about that.\" *His eyes are lying to me.* It was as he were the one hired to lie, the way he's doing it. Who pays this much for a horse just be put on the saddle himself?\n\nWe traded laid-out pleasantries until they were exhausted. It seemed like for every detail I inquired about, he was curious of the exact same thing. The first act was clumsily written, it would seem, though avidly acted. At least if he fucked like he talked, I might get off without having to fake it. \n\nWe ordered four courses. The *ap\u00e9ritifs* came and went, and the conversation turned to business. Brass tax. Long-winded words. Soup and salad were arriving as Mr. Chicago turned the conversation towards the bread and butter of our meeting. \n\n\"I understand that without the right investors, this newest portfolio might flop? What exactly is Charlie thinking? I would much prefer you take the lead on this one, if I may be frank.\"\n\nThe man sitting at the table near us chuckled quietly. \"Yes... well, to be honest, I thought maybe it was best if you approached him on the subject. It would not do for me to see presumptuous. You know my relationship with Charles,\" I said, all the while watching our neighbour. What is he laughing at? His only entertainment is the ice melting in the bucket in front of him. \n\n\"I do appreciate your support. Perhaps we could talk of this later? I... don't have all the details in front of me.\" He pawed at his pants, clearly anxious to pull out his cellphone. Generally, the men he court me pull out their phones only after the sex, only then ready to tell their wives that they miss them. Chicago sounded serious about his so-called details, though. *What kind of a man writes a cheat sheet for a paid date?*\n\n\"Perhaps we can discuss these ventures after our dinner,\" I ventured. He seemed to light up at that. It was a gamble, to be sure; Mr. Chicago had specifically asked that we not openly talk of sex in any way. He said nothing about suggesting it, though, and at this point I was antsy to change the subject. I knew nothing about investments. I had none. \n\nMr. Chicago dabbed his mouth with an ornate napkin, then crumpled it. \"When do you plan to return to Toronto?\" I answered with my eyes, hinting at the irony of his question. I'm not sure as of yet. Perhaps tomorrow morning, if my errands go well.\"\n\n\"That's good to hear... I would hate for you to be delayed in returning to your family. I know how much you miss them, the way you're always travelling for work.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do,\" I consented. \"Though of late, things have been rocky with... my husband.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he responded. \"I can relate to exactly what you're feeling. My... well, how might I put this. You know my wife, of course.\"\n\nThe man next to us cracked like an egg. A blast of water sprayed his perspiring champagne bucket as he sniggered into his drink. Two waiters paused and wondered if perhaps they should do something, but shortly lost interest. \n\n\"I heard that she was quite rude at the Christmas party,\" I said, the sarcasm dripping off every word. \"It is entirely understandable that you're... not invested in her as much as you used to be.\"\n\nThe man next to us was coughing into his napkin. what seemed like an invisible comedy to him was now revealed to be the drama ensuing between Mr. Chicago and myself. Whatever his intention from the get-go, my hirer was clearly annoyed.\n\n\"Perhaps we best adjoin to another room, better suited to talk of our... investments,\" I said, hoping for a release from this conversation as much as from this strange man.\n\n\"Agreed. Pardon me? Cheque please.\"\n\n*Double your regular pay to pretend to be my banking colleague.*\n\nThat went about as far as a foot into the hotel room he booked hastily. As did wanting me in a suit. He fucked like a man who had done this time and again, though, and for that I had no complaint. He fucked like a man betting on his last dollar, or like a horse galloping toward a moving finish line. He fucked like he wanted me, though not knowing what for.\n\nThe water had finished running in the bathroom, so I turned the bedside lamp back on and sat up. I let the coverlet fall down to my waist and put a sultry look on, brushing through my hair with my fingers quickly. It might serve not to beat around the bush working on the streets, but an escort had to play a game of courtesy first. Keep invested until the wallet was out, and you were sure to turn a better profit.\n\nThe door opened and teased a little more light into the room. *He sure is taking his time. What is he doing?* I felt anxious, as if maybe he was putting off the payment. That was always the most awkward part. Whether it was a desperate man paying quickly or a lusty man paying slowly, the process was always clumsy. You can tell so much about a man by how he pays, let alone what he's paying for.\n\nThe door finally opened, and there Mr. Chicago stood completely naked. He trotted into the room, winking sweet looks at me lying there on the bed, but then turned away to pick up his pants, wear the bulge of a wallet could be seen. *That's good,* I thought, *pay me so that I can get the hell out of this fake-ass suite.\n\n\"So,\" Mr. Chicago said, \"how is it that you wanted to pay me?\"",

            "comment": "It was called *Fuck You* money, the type of money you burn in front of poor people just to see the hope fade from their eyes. It was the type of money you used to hire the most expensive prostitutes in America, tell them to pretend to be bankers, and have them meet for lunch in *Le Bernardin* in the heart of Manhattan. Each thought they were meeting a client, both were told to never break act.\n\nI sat at the table next to theirs, twirling a stainless steel pen with the letters *Goldman Sachs* gilded on. The girl, Anna, was the first to arrive. A tight black skirt hugged her figure. The skirt was short, but work-appropriate short. She was the best prostitute *Fuck You* money could buy which meant she was the best in the world. She turned her wrist and checked a silver Rolex. It was a Daytona model. She had certainly done her research.\n\nThe guy, Brandon, soon followed. He wore a navy blue suit without a single crinkle. I glanced down at his shoes. Brooks Brothers, custom-made. It looked hand-crafted even. A smile touched my lips as he sat down and extended his hand for a handshake.\n\n\u201cAnna, was it?\u201d Brandon said. \u201cThanks for meeting me, my name\u2019s Brandon, VP at JPMorgan Chase, housing division.\u201d\n\nAnna returned him a firm shake. \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m a VP at Merrill Lynch, risk division.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at us, if our bosses found us here. They\u2019d have our bonuses.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and took a sip of wine. \u201cSo, I was told that you had a business proposal for me?\u201d\n\nThis was it, the reason I had dropped five figures on two prostitutes. Brandon would fumble through banking buzz words and financial pseudo-sciences as I sat back, laughing at his stupidity. Then Anna would follow in their dance of idiocrasy, all the way until they left *La Bernadin*, never to return because they couldn\u2019t afford even its dress code. My pen twirled in anticipation.\n\n\u201cCredit default swaps,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cIt\u2019s insurance against bad loans. So if we make a string of bad investments, even when we lose, we make money, just not as much.\u201d\n\nAnna furrowed her brow. \u201cI work risk at Merrill Lynch, I know how to lower risk.\u201d\n\nA giggle tickled my throat. What would a prostitute know about credit default swaps? He probably read the first Wikipedia paragraph and now thought himself an expert. I wondered who would be the bigger idiot, Brandon or Anna?\n\n\u201cWhat if we pair that up with thousands of high-risk loans?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike we already do?\u201d Anna asked.\n\n\u201cBut not *individually*.\u201d Brandon leaned forward, his voice lowered so I had to strain my ears just to hear his words. \u201cWe pool them all together and then securitize them into a single asset. Tell me Anna, what happens when you bundle risk?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt drops,\u201d Anna said. \u201cBut those have been around for a while now. Are you proposing that we just keep doing what we\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nBrandon frowned. It looked like Anna had done more research than him. I pretended to cough to stifle my laughter. It was he who would look the fool!\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Anna said, \u201cbut how about we talk to the ratings agencies. The bigger the pool of assets, the lower the risk. If we get a big enough pool, any sort of shitty asset could have a triple-A rating.\u201d\n\nMy jaw dropped and I broke character by staring straight at her. The two didn\u2019t even notice, they were so buried in their conversation.\n\n\u201cWe can lower it further by having it asset-backed. Like a car loan,\u201d Brandon said, his voice rising with his excitement.\n\n\u201cLike a mortgage!\u201d Anna said. \u201cWe can sell janitors million dollar houses on loans they\u2019ll never pay off, pool all those loans together, and then sell them off as a Triple-A asset before they crash and burn.\u201d\n\nMy fingers trembled, but not with the same excitement I had purchased. They were right. Banks could securitize all these shitty mortgages and their value would rise because their ratings would, even though the risk technically stayed exactly the same. My pen dropped to the napkin in front of me and I wrote a single phrase into it before slipping it in my pocket and leaving.\n\n*Sub-prime mortgages.*\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for daily WP stories, continuations by popular demand, and more!",

But after their mindless conversation the actual banker realizes this perfect set of loopholes and chances of fraud exist, and he is probably the first person in a position to capitalize on it. To us a phrase my good friend likes, \"It's so retarded its genius.\"\n\nThis plan was the series of exploitation of loopholes that lead to the 2008 financial collapse in the US. Essentially people who had absolutely no business getting a loan got them. Because at the time, and now again with recent legislation, people could pass the risk of these bad loans on very quickly while retaining small percentages of the money being moved around. They were able to do this because they used \"legal fraud\" to make these deals seem good. A loan moved from a borrower, to a loan officer, to a bank, to a mortgage broker, to a financial securities broker, and finally to john everyman's personal 401k. The loans moved very quickly through this chain and all of the financial people in the middle passed the risk along to the 401k holder. \n\nYou could be allowed to purchase a home you could not afford, lose money in fees to do this, lose your retirement when these securities collapsed in your retirement fund, and when since you could no longer afford your house the bank would foreclose and reap any equity in it, and on top of that, there was a 99% chance you would have no job or at best see your working conditions decline and your wages stay stagnant for a decade.",

Better yet, you can borrow other people's flats and use those, so you're building a skyscraper out of other people's flat LEGO and charging full-brick price.\n\nExcept some of your flats are being pulled out. Because they're borrowed. And the guys that own them are taking them back. And they do that more and more. And the guys you had lined up to replace those flats turn out to not have any LEGO flats or even any bricks at all: all theirs got taken back.\n\nSo your skyscraper becomes a giant game of JENGA instead of LEGO.\n\nWhich anyone who had taken courses at school on the history of the industry, could have reasonably seen coming.",

They basically walk you through step by step how we got to where we are, by telling the stories of the people who saw it coming before it ever hit.\n\nTo put it in perspective, prior to '08, the housing market was considered nearly indestructible. A massive market had basically formed around putting the keys to houses in the hands of every American, which had worked out well for a while. The problem was that we reached a point where most of the people left to sell houses to were in no position to buy them, so the banks would offer these loans that were nearly guaranteed to fail. Folks would be given incredibly low interest rates for the first few years, then it would skyrocket, and when they couldn't afford to pay the mortgage, they would default on the loan. \n\nThe way around this issue previously was that they would bundle loans together to be sold. You may buy thousands of loans, and most people would pay them off, so even if a few defaulted, you'd still be money ahead. These bundles were given ratings based on how likely they were to pay off. But these bundles were slowly getting shittier and shittier, as worse and worse loans were made to people who were less creditworthy. \n\nThe banks actually worked together with the agencies who were responsible for giving out the ratings for these bundles of loans to artificially inflate their scores so they could continue to unload them. \n\nIf this sounds highly illegal to you, that's because it is. This would be like if I sold you a house in an up and coming neighborhood, I promised you it would double in value in 10 years, and that I'd recently renovated it. You walk through and see lots of fresh paint, new appliances, you hire an expert to walk through and certify that it's a good house. He gives it the seal of approval, and you buy the house. Except, he only gave it the thumbs up because I sell all the houses in town, and wouldn't let him inspect any of them if he didn't give them approvals. Also, that house I sold you was full of termites, and the foundation was cracking. The appliances were malfunctioning floor units I picked out of the dumpster, and the whole thing was built on an indian burial ground and was haunted by the spirits of old native americans betrayed by the American government. Also, that neighborhood was weeks away from being filled with fresh section 8 housing that would tank the property values of everything within a five mile radius. \n\nThe sick and twisted part of the whole thing is that in the end, the US government decided the world would be worse off *without* these banks and bailed them out, costing the American taxpayer quite the pretty penny, and allowing these banks to return to doing what they did best; Screwing people out of their money.",

That is a bunch of fancy words for the following...\n\n1) when people want to buy a home, they usually borrow the money\n\n2) banks will loan an amount of money based on risk. Risk comes from 1) how likely is the borrower to fail to pay back the loan, and 2) if they fail, how likely can the bank get *something* to replace the loss (eg resell the house). High enough risk, and the mortgage is no longer a prime loan, but rather, it is \"subprime\". Banks generally do not engage in too many subprime mortgages because it over leverages them with risk. This means plumbers can usually not buy million dollar homes.\n\n3) banks can sell loans to other financial institutions to free up cash in order to make new loans. Again, the other financial institution may decline this purchase based on the risk. Subprime loans may not be sellable because the risk is just too high.\n\n4) a bank does not have to sell loans to other institutions individually. The loans can be packaged up together.\n\n5) packaging groups of loans lowers the overall risk. I cannot explain why, but this is a known thing in finances. I believe it has something to do with grouping bad loans with good loans, sort of like having a diverse portfolio for an investor.\n\n6) using (5) to package enough subprime mortgages together can bring the risk down far enough that the overall package is no longer subprime, but prime again, and now we can sell the package to another financial institution.\n\n7) Now we're able to sell a few plumbers the million dollar homes they cannot afford, have no business buying, and will certainly default on, and still pass the loan off to other financial institutions, because we can hide that high risk loan amongst a handful of moderate or low risk loans.\n\nSo that's what was going on in 2006. A bunch of plumbers were taking out million dollar loans that they were inevitably going to default on, and the bank which granted the loans were bundling them together with slightly-better-risk loans until the risk was low enough to pass on to other financial institutions. When the over-leveraged plumbers stopped paying their bills and the loans defaulted, the financial institutions which bought them took a hit, sometimes to the point of defaulting themselves. This happened in such great numbers that there were significantly fewer financial institutions available to offer loans or buy loans in the market, meaning that fewer businesses could take out loans, which is vitally important in a functioning capitalist economy.\n\nAnd it looks like all of this is a result of a couple of role-playing prostitutes.\n\nGood story, BTW OP.",

Generally, the risk of a portfolio (\"the bundle\" in this case) is lower than the risks of its parts, except when all the parts are correlated and tend to move together in the same direction at the same time.

If you only used historical correlations between mortgage backed securities from different housing markets, it's possible that the risk of these collateralized debt obligations would've looked pretty reasonable.\n\nEvery town has its own idiosyncracies that do not necessarily apply to other towns, so housing prices seemed diversified. A homeowner in Idaho is not likely to lose his job at the same time that a homeowner in New York does, so the borrowers seemed diversified. Recent historical data at the time would not have suggested the large systematic default risk.",

Any rich person who hires incredibly expensive escorts would not expect those escorts to be uneducated or unintelligent. Expensive escorts are university educated, often with graduate degrees. Here in Korea, they usually speak 3 or more languages and play multiple musical instruments to entertain you too.\n\nNo rich person who has \"fuck you\" money would ever assume such highly paid escorts can't afford the dress code for high class restaurants either. They make **very** upper middle class incomes. 200k a year is not strange at all. We're talking a class of escort that makes $1,000 to $2,000 an hour.",

Okay...soo...how are those reports going?\" Daryl said, in his best banker voice.\n\n\"Not bad, although Bill pulled me into a meeting all afternoon, so I got pretty sidetracked,\" replied Judy, starting to get into character.\n\n\"Jeez, Bill again huh?\"\n\n\"Ya, he means well, and he's a pleasant guy to work for overall, but he wastes *so* much time in meetings. It's like... we get it, we're all on board with the 'Bank Mission Statement', but we have to get some work done too,\" Judy said - her mind now switching fully into her bank character.\n\n*This is fucking sweet.* I thought to myself.\n\n\"Totally. I mean, I like teamwork, respect and honesty as much as the next guy, but most managers just leave it as a background thing,\" said Daryl, starting to enjoy himself.\n\nJudy caught a little smile from Daryl, and a twinkle in his eye. *Well,* she thought, *I have to say, this is definitely more fun than that wizard scenario I was in last week...*\n\nDaryl was thinking the same thing, *Not bad compared to the ant farm lady. My ant character blows...I just can't get into it.*\n\n\"Next time Bill calls a meeting I think I'm gonna say something,\" Judy continued. \"Nothing rude, but I just feel like we're wasting so much time in that little boardroom. I mean, *at least* try to book the big one with the lake view.\"\n\n\"That lake one is dope...I could totally spend an afternoon in there,\" replied Daryl, nodding his head.\n\n*This is amazing,* I thought to myself, barely holding it together.\n\n\"Have you ever been in the meeting room on the top floor, near Thompson's office?\" Judy asked, picturing it in vivid detail.\n\n\"Don't stop,\" I whispered, too quietly for anyone to hear.\n\n\"Oh my God, if that was my office I would be so fucking productive. Jesus Christ, just think of all the work I could get done in there,\" said Daryl, with genuine excitement.\n\n\"What an awesome meeting room,\" agreed Judy, shaking her head in near disbelief.\n\nBoth Judy and Daryl had dove in head first. They knew the bank inside and out. They knew who they liked at the bank and who they didn't. They embodied the bank's Core Values, and had a list of who they could fire if the budget got tight. They had fulfilled the role. \n\nAnd most importantly. \n\nThey had truly \n\nbecome... \n\n*Bankers*.\n\n*Ohmygodimcumming*\n",

He has this look in his eyes as if to say, \"At least I don't have to shit on anyone,\" and I, too, have that look. But burrowed in that look; deep inside its gooey guts like a caramel chocolate is joy - Oh wonderous joy. \n\nThe woman arrives, femme fatale in appearance and struts over to the man. The way she moves, Christ, a succubus in hell hasn't got a chance to be hotter than that. She sits, a smirk splintering across her face like venom, and speaks.\n\n\"Hello Lance,\" Even mountains would melt in the aura of her voice, dripping out of her in such a sultry manner I found myself falling in love with two words. \"I'm glad we have a moment to relax, these last few weeks have been... *stressful*\" \n\n\"One way to say that, Susan,\" he replies, becoming the physical embodiment of masculinity. He lazily brushes his fingers through his thick brown beard, before leaning forward. \"I've been so pent up trying to get the office sorted. I need a way to blow off some steam.\"\n\n\"I've been bent over the cabinets for weeks trying to sort everything,\" her lips smack when she finishes the last syllable, and the left side of her smile rises. Small, subtle, and charming. \n\n\"It's the way I like you,\" he states. The power and commandment in his voice make me completely aware as to why women like to call their partners 'Daddy'. I want to call him Daddy. \n\n\"Do you want any more breadsticks, sir?\"\n\nI turn, a waitress. I bite, \"No, I am fine, I am wonderful, please leave me alone, I have important business to attend to.\" I turn back; they're walking out the door. \n\nOh no.  The prostitutes are off to have sex already. Why can't they just keep it in their pants, I need this, fuck. I stand and wipe some breadsticks dust off my lap, and sigh. Oh well, I got what I needed. \n\nI walk out the door, a buffet of surprise knocking the wind out of me, as two familiar faces staring at me.\n\n\"Hey Lachlan,\"  Lance says, not prostitute Lance, real Lance. \"We didn't see you at the meeting. Management said you had somewhere to be,\" \n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" I calmly speak, \"Lunch with some clients.\" I look at the two of them. \"So, what are you two lovebirds up to?\" I say, my eyes smiling.\n\n\"We're getting lunch,\" Susan replies. \"And can you stop trying to push that office romance? We're work colleagues, just that.\" \n\n\"Of course,\" I say. \"Apologies. I'll see you later Lance.\" I walk past him, patting his back as I do, and laugh to myself quietly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out /r/Rhysyjay for other neat stuff. \n\n\n",

Are all of you taking your cues from James Bond or is he indeed the quintessential Englishman?\"\n\n\u201cOh I am truly afraid that James Bond is only the figment of one\u2019s imagination. Our Foreign Intelligence service is far less glamorous. But we gents of the banking industry do represent the best of lots, the real deal\u2026on a promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I do like Englishmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh please don\u2019t say like you didn\u2019t before this splendid occasion. But just to be sure, allow me to finalize that transaction in any case.\u201d\n\nIt was better than I expected. Never have I imagined that I could be the proverbial fly on the wall. 70K per night, not bad a price for a giggle. If she said 70K per hour, I would have said yes, but what do you think I am? A Savage?\n\nA face to die for? No. Not quite. But I could see how men would stuff her vagina full of greenbacks. Don\u2019t know how she survived that. Do you really care? But they assured me of a 100% clean pussy, the cleanest the money could buy. Silky blonde with a piercing blue pair. Prada light turquoise pointy toe pump; devil wears Prada, what else would you expect? An expensive prostitute is still a prostitute. A Louis Vuitton Croc matte, nothing fancy there. Dior qiviut grey blue A-line with blazer freshly delivered from Paris, Chanel pearl earrings laced with gold, Cornelia James pashmina straight out of Kashmir; get this, she paid an insurer to actually go to Kashmir, witness it being made there before airmailed express to London, packaged and sent to New York with the personal thank you note from Genevieve James. She paid 150K as a donation for the honour of a signature. Why didn\u2019t she ask for the Queen\u2019s autograph instead is anyone\u2019s guess. She certainly does not lack audacity. Oh and 18 karats white gold La Do\u00f1a de Cartier. What a cunt.     \n\n\nMr. Lanshire costed me 100K notwithstanding other undertows, oh my precious pounds of flesh. I guess my second wave feminist mother could go fuck herself and burn off her eyebrows as she pleases. A well defined Jawline, olive eyes that are the collectors of souls, topped salt and pepper with a classic charming smile. Probably a sizable prick. A Savile Row fellow, oh how quaint and bespoke; boring, the vile English. Mid grey wide chalk Spanish merino Henry Poole; he really thinks he is James Bond no less. A.Testoni Oxford lace-up in caramel calf. A dark blue white striped dorsilk pocket square. A Rotonde De Cartier Astrotourbillon 18 K White Gold, matching brand and price range with our lady friend, a pair made in heaven. What do you know, another cunt. Oh and no one would think that I would have the indecency of not getting a copy of their receipts for their expensive tastes, right? It is after all my party. \n\nThese idiots wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish an organized crime outing from a casual business arrangement. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t call this money well spent but my taste certainly dictates my behaviors; one doesn\u2019t need a shrink to see that. There is nothing in the world that pleases me so much as to witness Man go to work and how far up the ladder one is willing to go. The human spirit? We are no different you and I, than him or her. We are all earning our keeps, aren\u2019t we? \n\n\u201cTo what do I, representative of the Lloyds Group, owe the pleasure of this stately occasion? What business arrangement, Shelby, are we privy to here in this\u2026magnificent place of\u2026commerce?\u201d \n Shall we start with a big mac and some fries?\u201d\n\n\u201cI love your sense of humor and I am glad we are on the intimate first name basis already, oh or should I say last name, Lanshire?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite. Quite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the last minute change of location. Believe me, I was shocked too. Very unorthodox. But I am surprised you weren\u2019t informed beforehand of the business details.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is all hush-hush. But of course this speaks to the nature of our meeting; very important deal that require the utmost discretion. However I am sure it would be worthy of our times, for a man of my position, no one would want to tug me around for a laugh because I will skin them alive of course. My colleague had informed me of the change. It\u2019s novel, really. But having your own personal G5 always solves the problem.\u201d\n\nOh that smug face. A professional. Pumped up chest, on the offensive, making it seem as if that he is impatient and offended. Oh the wrong that is wrought upon his dignity! Greasy! I love it! And I don\u2019t just mean my big mac.   \n\n\u201cWell, Lanshire, I am not allowed to proceed until my partner gets here. I hope you understand?\n\n\u201cOf course! It is not a problem. My colleague, well, my subordinate really, but I respect him, said I would love tonight\u2019s talk so I did not ask further but you know requiring me to be present in such an\u2026unofficial capacity---I hope you do catch my meaning, fair to say, it is important and I am all ears to hear what he had arranged for the benefit of our companies. But pray say, love, we do look out of place, don\u2019t we?.\u201d\n\nAtlanta in the middle of June, of course. Why shouldn\u2019t I ruin your nice Poole. \n\n\u201cWas it Will, Will Keith that you talked to from our division?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It was Will. A nice chap he was. B of A, I always liked you bunch. And Rupert contacted you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure they will show any minute now. Perhaps they are quite taken by each other just as we have ourselves on this first meeting of ours.\u201d\n\nThe pulsating unease. Oh yes, sticking out its tentacles the fear of discovery. A palpable bubble; a space where these two most unfortunate souls are dancing to the tone of a tango of mutual self destruction.\n\n\u201cI am sure it would be more\u2026cultural acquisition than anything else.\u201d\n\nWit and placative smile, I could taste the deception; the use of her insecurity in this environment to her advantage: Embarrassment at the tardiness of her partner, playing the victim, the fawn.  \n\n\u201cHah, a good one. Lord, that\u2019s a good one! Nothing could beat a woman with a sense of humour. Hm, so, how is the industry here in America?\u201d\n\nThe doubts. The wrangling of facts and fictions. You see, if you think I will let these two fine human specimen off the hook so easy, to just spend a nice evening at the most obvious contrivance, the Delmonico's, then you are more a fool than I thought you are. \n\n\u201cWell, you know, it is all samesey as you would say right? Fiscal policy reviews and projections. Charts after charts, drowning in paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, tell me about it. The drivels they spew. My position might be high but I am not THE boss. And I have to micro manage below me all of them pricks, oh excuse my language. But they all want the impossible. I am just so stressed out. This is a breath of fresh air, coming here, meeting you, such a beautiful lady, and of course to discuss an important matter that meant the future of our two great companies.\u201d \n \nAgitated I see, good but I like my steak well done and it has not quite passed bloody yet. Almost.\n\n\u201cYou pulled words right out of my mouth. Perhaps one of these days you could show me London.\u201d\n\nI smell cliche, em, the great trade talk.  \n\n\u201cI would love nothing more. Oh how rude of me, here is my card. Call me anytime, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd mine.\u201d\n\nBoy meets girl. Or is it girl meets boy? \n\n\u201cWell, how about we meet privately after this affair?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2026sounds fine.\u201d \n\nOh that look, very very wet. \n\n\u201cGreat, I can\u2019t wait. But what is taking our colleagues so long? You know what, do excuse me while I make a phone call.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should too.\u201d\n\nAnd there goes their little interlude. Fuming, confused. Well, I am going to get a refill of my 7-ups. \n\n\u201cFBI!!! Hands up! Hands up! Catherine Shelby! Edward Lanshire!\u201d\n\n\u201cEdward Lanshire, Catherine Shelby, you are under arrest for conspiracy to commit fraud! You have the right to remain silent\u2026.\u201d\n\nWell, well, looks like we got panties in a bunch. Oh the look on his face, pure horror and disbelief. How obedient becomes a man being told to never open the briefcase he is carrying when money is on the line. Work. \n\nAnd her, how she froze there for a moment before her brows furled and before launching such a diatribe, about how she is in the service to a certain Emir and how they, who\u2019s they?\u2026They will pay for this transgression. Well, she isn't wrong. She was just banged the entire day by a certain certain thawbed individual last Sunday. How smart she thinks she is. I am sure that certain thawbed individual would be pleased to getting his stolen diamond parking at 20 million dollars back. But no one knows me. I don\u2019t know anything about diamonds. \n\nI am simply a woman of pleasure, watching people; see their eyes lit up at the chance to slip into a character and play it out to their heart\u2019s content. But no one seemed to understand the price one has to pay. Justice? No, I don\u2019t care for justice. I am not a facilitator. I only care if my steak is well done and only now is it getting started, just passing bloody. Rest assured, I am banging Miss Griffin and Mr. Clarkson in a threesome tonight, to give them hope, the simmers before I leave them to their own devices. Leverage. I hope they learned about risk management.    \n\nWe are all earning our keeps after all.  \n\nOh and big macs aren\u2019t bad when consumed in the right situation. Wouldn\u2019t you say?\n\nRefills, ah\u2026God bless America.     \n\n------------------------\nGreat thread to read through. Great WP. ",

            "comment": "They both came to the place at the arranged time, within minutes of one another. Fancy dress, hair done up, no tattoos showing; just as you had instructed them. But hey, good money is good money, and you knew, and they both knew. They were the one's selling, so what's a bit of acting? Business gets boring. Entertainment does not grow on trees. \n\nYou'd spent the last hour or so, planning, scheming. You wanted to set it up just right, to create tension, minor discomfort, and all the while the impression of correctness. How would they begin? You wondered. How would they introduce one another? What would they discuss? What terms would they use? Would either one perhaps have a knowledgeable background by chance? You hadn't checked, on purpose. But everyone goes down the rabbit hole somewhere, and while it could have been early on, it could easily have been later, to get through life. You didn't care. You just wanted to see it. That was all. \n\nShe had sat down first and you were just near enough to inconspicuously observe her exaggerated manners. Back straight as a bow, hands crossed on her lap, eyes darting around the immediate area and a smile that tried so hard to appear formal it barely missed being a grimace. It was almost comical. It was perfect. \n\nThen he arrived, at the door. You could see him trying to emit the correct impressions even on the waiters, as he asked for his designated table. Practicing perhaps. Nervous. \n\nYou watched him approach the seated female who now wouldn't dare look up or make eye contact. He was visibly preparing himself for the worst. You turned to fully face the pair, eager for the show to start. \n\nThat was when she lifted her head and their eyes met, and both expressions took a 180 turn, much to your own disappointment. \n\n\"...Lexa?\"\n\n\"Well, if there's any person I wouldn't have expected to have a business meeting it was you. You're not even in business, are you?\"\n\n\"Oh god, I should've seen it from the start.\"\n\nWell, fuck. There goes your money. ",

I am so rich that I can probably make anyone a prostitute, so I make sure to lay a lot on the performers. It is I who buy them new expensive clothes for every week and I pay for the first class meal as well. It had now gone about two months of the same procedure, every week at the same restaurant at the same time and with the same people. I never got what their names were, but it doesn't matter anyway. It's just so funny listening to those two rags trying to be professional. It is like watching a one-legged man dance and thinks that he dances like Rudolf Nureyev. And the best of it is that I am in control and can change the scenario however I want. \n\nThey are now sitting at the table in front of me, talking their usual bullshit. This is probably their highlight of the week. To just for one night per week escape their fucked up reality and be someone else. It is my highlight of the week as well.\n\nThere they are. In their fancy clothes, in a fancy restaurant, believing that they are making the earth a better place. They think that without this meeting the stocks will crash or that without them the bank would be ruined. They live with the illusion that they are important. I stopped listening to their jibberish and looked around the restaurant and then myself. I noticed that they were not the only two.\n",

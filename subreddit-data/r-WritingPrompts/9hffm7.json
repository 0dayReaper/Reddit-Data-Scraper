            "comment": "It turned out that cleaning up the crime scene was the easy part \u2013 their victim hadn\u2019t bled much, after all, and the neighborhood was relatively quiet. Adam and Jason struggled briefly to carry the body to the garage, but there was a large freezer there which suited their purposes entirely. \n\nThe difficult part was ensuring that no one found out about the murder until the Purge. Seven days \u2013 all they needed to do was to lie low for seven days, and then they were scot-free. And yet, two days was all it took for Adam to have his first mental break-down.\n\n---\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have thought about that before you clubbed him,\u201d Jason replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done. I give up, OK? Enough. Anything\u2019s better than this. If I have to do just one more\u2026 I think\u2026 I think I\u2019d rather die, you know?\u201d \n\nJason knew how they did it in the movies. He could have slapped Adam across the face, a real cheek-scorcher that would have left pulsating red marks. Then he could have followed up with a minute or two of yelling, anything, really, to knock some sense back into his friend. \n\nBut Jason chose to take a seat next to Adam instead. He waited until the sobbing subsided before he spoke again.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Jason. \u201cI\u2019ll take the next shift, OK? You go for a walk, or a shower. Or go grab a pizza. Then, when you come back, you\u2019ll feel better, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t let you do that. You\u2019re only in this mess because I dragged you in. I was the one who got us into this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam, I *insist*. You\u2019re not doing either of us any good now. All it takes is a single slip-up, you know? If any of Evelyn\u2019s customers catch on\u2026 and they will, trust me\u2026 you know what they\u2019ll do, right? If we\u2019re lucky, they just disconnect, put it down to a bad day. But if we\u2019re not\u2026 if they are merely *half* as fanatic as they appear to be, they will dig, and dig, and *dig* until they realize we\u2019re not her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 but they don\u2019t know where *here* is. They don\u2019t know where he\u2026 I mean Evelyn\u2026 lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, *you* found out where, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Jason narrowed his eyes for effect, and was gratified to see that Adam had begun to put serious thought into the warning. \u201cAnd if they come here too, find out that we\u2019re both here\u2026it\u2019s all over. You may have killed a man, but you\u2019re not a real killer, you know that.\u201d\n\nAdam nodded, and then his shoulders sunk deeper. He was a pitiful sight, diminished, not even a tenth of the person he was two days ago. Jason supposed that was what anger did to you, how passion could inflame a person, bulk them up many times over. Jason was almost a full head taller than Adam, but when Adam had discovered the terrible truth, that the person who he had been in love with over the internet was actually a middle-aged man who had been stringing him along as part of some elaborate catfishing scam, there was no way that Jason could have restrained Adam. That was how enraged Adam had been.\n\n\u201cAdam? Just five more days, alright? Five more days of pretending to be Evelyn, five more days of keeping her other fans at bay\u2026 and then we\u2019re free of all this, OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo. Go then. Go take that walk and come back. I\u2019ll respond to all of the online chats now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure you can? There\u2019s some really nasty ones there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNastier than you were?\u201d Jason caught the glare in Adam\u2019s eye and laughed. \u201cJust kidding, bro.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m *serious*. Look, there are three of them online now. I found Evelyn\u2019s notes on each of them, I\u2019ve put it beside the laptop. The wig is there too, and the voice changer app is already running. I\u2019ve dimmed the lights already.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ve got this! Just go!\u201d\n\nJason turned back to the laptop, and realized that his fingers were shaking. The bravado was all good for keeping his friend\u2019s spirits up, but the truth was, this was turning his stomach way more than he had let on.\n\nJason sighed, then started typing. The bile was building up at the back of his throat, but he soldiered on. Freedom was so close.\n\n&gt; **Michael2121:** Heya, Evie, u were gone much longer than u said u wld! \n\n&gt; **EvelynHEART:** Aww, baby, u miss me much?\n\n&gt; **Michael2121:** U got that part riteee! Man, u have no idea how u make me feel sometimes! Come on now, dun be a strangr, gimme some of that kissy? Please? U promised! And I wan 2 hear u purr! Purr for me like the kitty that u are!\n\nJason turned the webcam on, twisted the focus so that the details were softer, then drew in a deep breath. The things one did for one\u2019s friends.\n\n***\u201cMEEEEEEEEOWWWWW.\u201d***\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny\n",

            "comment": "At the bottom of the stairs, a body lay with limbs jutting out at odd angles. Ash, having heard the rolling thuds, appeared from the kitchen and clasped a hand over his mouth.\n\n'Oh.' Harry said from the top of the stairs.\n\nAsh panned upwards in a slow, painful arc and then straight back to the body.\n\n'Is she dead?' Ash asked.\n\nAsh crouched beside his sprawled roommates body, he knew he should do something, but couldn't think straight.\n\n'Check her pulse.' Harry said, remaining at the top of the stairs.\n\nAsh extended two trembling fingers to Anna's wrist. It was still warm, but he couldn't feel the slightest kick of life. Ash started to shake his head.\n\n'Check her neck!'\n\nAsh dropped to his knees and crawled to her head. Somehow checking her neck seemed worse. Ash's fingers found no pulse and instead found a mound of vomit rising in his throat. Ash turned away from the body, now confirmed dead.\n\nRolling thuds, similar to the ones he had heard thirty seconds ago, came from behind him. Ash turned, concerned that Harry had followed Anna's fate and thrown himself down the stairs. Instead of another dead roommate he saw Harry cantering down the stairs. Harry leapt from the last step and vaulted the body.\n\n'Call the police?' Ash asked with his face turned up to Harry.\n\nHarry shook his head. 'Call her work.'\n\n'W-what?' Ash stammered.\n\n'Get her in the freezer and call her work.'\n\nHarry positioned himself behind Anna's sprawled legs, as if ready to start dragging her. 'For Christ's sake, help me, Ash.'\n\n'No wait a minute. It was an accident right?' Ash said.\n\n'Of course, it was an accident. You think I pushed her?'\n\nHarry's face would have been straight, had it not been for a slight twitch in his left eye.\n\n'I would have bloody waited until Purge night if I'd wanted her dead.'\n\n'So we call the police and tell them the truth.'\n\nHarry picked up Anna's legs, one foot facing the completely wrong direction. He started to drag her, making a horrible screeching as her t-shirt rode up, exposing her stomach which pulled against the linoleum flooring.\n\n'Stop Harry!' Ash called.\n\nThe screeching continued as Harry put his back into it. 'The police...' Harry huffed '...won't...' Harry heaved '...believe us...'\n\n'US!' Ash squawked indignantly.\n\nAnna's feet fell with a thud against the floor. Harry straightened himself and looked at Ash with smouldering eyes.\n\n'Your fingerprints are on the body genius.'\n\n'What the fuck Harry.' Ash said.\n\n'We're in this mess together. But don't worry.' Harry managed a smile amongst the madness, and it scared Ash more than the body he was dragging. 'I have a plan.'\n\nAsh shook his head. 'Police.'\n\n'Call Anna's work, pretend to be her.'\n\n'Me?' Ash squeaked.\n\n'Your voice is practically high enough already.' Harry said and let out a poisonous laugh. 'Call in sick. A girl can be sick for five days can't she?'\n\n'Five days...' Ash trailed off, remembering that the purge was due next week. 'The freezer? Five days?' Ash continued to repeat his thought process out loud.\n\n'Exactly. Now grab her arms,' Harry cocked his head at Anna's arms 'kind of looks like an out of shape cactus.'\n\n/r/WrittenThought",

            "comment": "\"I read an article last night, a medical one about *exploding head syndrome*,\" Lance said. He was a short and plump man, walking with a very noticeable limp. To his side was his best friend, Jeff. They were both walking down the side-walk on a hot and humid Floridian day, cars driving past them with the windows rolled up. He glanced over at one of them, jealous of what the air conditioning on the inside of one of those sedans must've felt like. Sweat was beginning to pool at his shirt collar. \n\n\"Exploding, damn, so it just happens, just like that? **BAM**, dead?\" Jeff asked. It was a wonder how he was even capable of speaking. His cheek was swollen and he was missing several teeth. He was tall and lanky but with a wide frame. If it weren't for the meth addiction, he probably could've been crafted into a super athlete. \n\n\"No, you idiot, it's where you're like, laying in bed, ya know, and you just hear a really loud **BANG**,\" Lance said, grimacing as the path they were walking suddenly went uphill. His knee still hadn't recovered from the altercation that him and Jeff had gotten into with \"*El Matador*\", a five-time local lucha libre champion. \n\n\"Oh, so someone just shoots you, that just sounds like being shot,\" Jeff muttered, rubbing at his bruises, souvenirs from the El Matador's fists. \n\n\"No, no, ugh,\" Lance grunted, \"you just hear the noise in your own head. Just a bang, for no reason.\" \n\n\"Weird.\" \n\n\"Yeah, and speaking of weird,\" Lance said, looking around, \"it sure is looking pretty normal around here.\" \n\nJeff looked around the neighborhood. The homes were partly rundown, lawns unkempt, and fellow Floridians sat on their front porches, smoking cigarettes. \"Looks pretty standard,\" Jeff said. \n\n\"Yeah, you'd think people would be getting ready for the Purge, but nah, just sitting around,\" Lance said, wiping the sweat out of his eyes. The sweat that had been bunched up by his neck began to drip down the line of his spine, ending at his waistband, where he had a Glock tucked away. Pain shot up his knee once again. \"Fucking lucha bastard,\" he muttered, \"gonna fucking drop his ass this time, yeah?\" \n\n\"Hell yeah,\" Jeff said, he too beginning to drip with sweat. \n\n***\n\nThe duo arrived at El Matador's quaint apartment complex at 11:54PM, a handful of minutes, and a week, before the Purge was to begin. \n\nLance and Jeff stood shoulder to shoulder, staring at the door. \n\nJeff raised his arm and looked at his cheap dollar store watch, \"6 minutes till, do we do it now? No harm in it right? Not like a handful of minutes really matter.\" \n\nLance looked up and down the rest of the a corridor, amazed that there was no one else here in the breezeway with them, ready to kick doors down and get the party started. He took in a deep sigh, \"Nah, doesn't feel right. I need to compose myself. Get into character. Let's walk a lap around the corridor,\" he said, wanting to stretch out his swollen knee some more. \n\nThe duo walked around, and Lance asked, \"Have you ever thought about doing the shit he does?\" \n\n\"Hmm?\" Jeff muttered, still rubbing at his face. \n\n\"The wrestling thing. You've got the body for it. Lift some weights, learn how to do some moves, I could easily see you doing it.\" \n\n\"I dunno man, I ain't all about that shit, looks like a lot of hard work.\" \n\n\"It's fake, you dummy, there's no work at all involved,\" Lance said. \n\n\"I dunno, you see them lifting each other and slamming each other and shit, that's work.\" \n\n\"Whatever,\" Lance grunted, \"it's just something to think about. You basically have the same physique as El Matador, but you know, a little skinnier.\" \n\n\"Whatever your whatever,\" Jeff said as they finally reapproached El Matador's apartment door. \n\n\"Time?\" Lance asked. \n\n\"11:59PM.\" \n\n\"Fuck it, let's do this,\" Lance said, pulling the handgun out from his waistband and held it behind his back. He checked the safety, and then knocked on the door. He heard Jeff take a few deep breaths, and he felt adrenaline dump itself into his bloodstream. \n\nThe duo heard the door unlock and swing open, and there standing before them, was El Matador, the wrestler who had handed them their collective asses in the back parking lot behind a McDonalds a few days prior. He was still wearing his Lucha mask. \n\n\"Goddamn,\" Lance said, pulling the gun from behind his back, \"Do you fucking wear that thing even when you're in the shower?\" \n\n\"What the fuck are you pendejo's doing? It's-\" \n\nBefore El Matador could even get another word out, his head exploded into a bloody mess, covering both Lance and Jeff with bits of skull and brain matter. The luchador stood on his feet swaying for a few moments, blood pouring down his neck before he finally toppled over and fell back into the apartment.\n\n\"Oh man,\" Jeff said, wiping the blood from his eyes, \"you got shit all over my favorite t-shirt! This shit right here is the real exploding head syndrome!\" \n\nLance ignored him, choosing to limp over to El Matador's lifeless (and partially headless) body. \"Yeah, that's what you get you asswipe,\" Lance said, firing three more rounds into the wrestler's body, blood spattering up like miniature geysers. \n\n\"Jesus,\" Jeff said, covering his ears, \"a warning next time? Yeah?\" \n\n\"Whatever, it's the goddamn purge! Look at your watch!\" \n\nThey both checked, and sure enough, it was 12:01AM. \n\nThe duo turned around and looked out the apartment building and out into the corridor, expecting the sounds of bustling riots to begin to overtake their own chatter. \n\nBut there was nothing. \n\n\"Where the fuck is everybody?\" Lance asked. \n\n\"I don't know, this is weird.\" \n\nA next door neighbor opened her apartment door and peeked out into the corridor, \"Can y'all keep it down? I'm trying to sleep,\" she said, hair curlers almost falling out of her hair.\n\n\"Sleep? Why sleep? It's the purge!\" \n\n\"Umm, no it's not, you idiots. Keep your shit quiet before I call the cops. What is that y'all have all over you?\" \n\n\"Ketchup,\" Jeff muttered. \n\n\"Fucking weirdos,\" the neighbor said before shutting her door. \n\nThe duo looked at each other, and then back at El Matador's body, blood already beginning to pool around him. \n\n\"I think we fucked up,\" Lance whispered.

They washed off most off the blood from themselves, and discreetly washed the front door as quietly as they could. \n\n\"Get them bits,\" Lance said, pointing at the fragments of skull that had collected at the doorstep, \"don't need any neighbors seeing that shit.\" \n\n\"Why am I on skull bit duty? You're the one who blasted him.\" \n\n\"Cuz my knee is all shot to hell because of this bastard, I can't stoop down.\" \n\nJeff huffed and did what he was told. After they had seemingly cleaned up as much of the mess as they could, the duo retired to El Matador's bathroom to partake in a bit of meth, or at least try to. \n\n\"How in the hell did you get blood in it?\" Lance yelled. \n\n\"I had it in my front pocket, and El Matador decided to spray it instead of saying it after you put lead into his face!\" \n\n\"Jesus, can't even get high during this bullshit.\" \n\n\"What are we going to do?\" \n\nLance looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and spoke with confidence, not to calm Jeff, but rather to calm himself, \"We're a week early, we did it here in the apartment, the only witness is that damned lady and she didn't even seem all that bothered by it. All we gotta do is just wait it out. Wait until the purge *actually* fucking starts, and then we'll be golden. How does that sound-\" \n\nBefore Lance could complete his speech, there was a knock on the door. \n\n\"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck-\" Jeff muttered. He ran over to the door and peeked through the peephole, \"Oh my fucking god Lance, it's the police, what in the fuck, oh my god.\" \n\n\"Hello?\" The police officer called from the other side of the door, \"there was a noise complaint filed here. Please open up, I saw your shadow under the door.\" \n\n\"Lance, what the hell do we do? Come on man, come on!\" \n\nLance's heart was pounding in his chest. He looked around El Matador's apartment, thoughts racing, then a thought struck him. He opened the closet holding El Matador's body, as well as all of the lucha masks. He grabbed one and threw it at Jeff. \n\n\"Put it on, answer the door, but down say anything. Point to your mouth, you're busted up.\" \n\n\"Lance, I don't think that's going to fucking work man, I-\" \n\n\"Just. Fucking. Do it.\" \n\nAs Jeff haphazardly put on the lucha mask, Lance attempted to close the closet door, finding that it wouldn't shut due to El Matador's arm laying out. He kicked the limp arm back into the door, and finally shut it, and then he dipped away and hid behind a couch, watching as Jeff, now disguised as a luchador, opened the door. \n\n\"Hey, good evening El Matador, got another noise complaint on ya, and Jesus man, do you seriously wear that thing all the time?\" \n\nJeff nodded. \n\n\"Whatever man, but look, can you keep it down? I know you like to throw ragers and all, but we can't keep getting called back here. Understand?\" \n\nJeff nodded again. \n\n\"Can you talk? Usually a chatty Cathy, something wrong?\" \n\nJeff shook his head, and pointed to his lips, which were obviously bruised from the ass whooping the real El Matador had given him. \n\n\"Oh, took a dropkick to the face. Should've ducked, man,\" the cop said. \n\nJeff shrugged. \n\n\"Oh well, just keep it down. If it weren't for the free show tickets you've been sliding me, I would've already given you one of mine. Speaking of which, I'll see you at tomorrow's show right! You ready to take on El Patron?\" \n\nJeff inhaled deeply, and nodded. \n\n\"I know you can take him,\" the officer said with a wink. \"See you then. Have a good night bud.\" \n\nJeff nodded, waved, and closed the door. He turned his back to it, and slid down, smearing the blood that was still covering the inside of the door all the way down. He ripped off the lucha mask and looked at Lance. \n\n\"Lance, man, what the fuck. What the fuck? Why the fuck is El Matador friends with a police officer, and why the fuck is the police officer expecting to see El Matador at a wrestling show tomorrow night? Dude, he is going to know something is up whenever El Matador doesn't show up!\" \n\nLance stood up slowly and stiffly from behind the couch, \"Oh, El Matador's going to show up tomorrow night. He's going to have to show up...\" he said, pointing at the luchador mask still clutched in Jeff's hand. \n\n\"Oh come on man, no.\" ",

            "comment": "\"We've gotta think about this rationally,\" replied Katie.\n\n\"She was an absolute bitch who deserved it,\" growled back Blythe.\n\nThat was true. No one liked Claudia Shepherd much. She was horrid to her employees, stole money from the business to fund her own treasures, and there was a fear that she was going to bring down the whole company with her when she left. No one was exactly clean here, and she was the snake that got the plea deal first.\n\nKatie uncovered it first. She was looking up dirt to see if she could get Claudia fired, and found how that she was looking to take everyone else out. Blythe was simply a coworker who was nearby when Katie confronted Claudia about it. She was the one who charged in when she realized what Katie was going on about and began screeching at Claudia. Everything went to shit because of it.\n\nIt was difficult to say if it was intentional or accidental, but Claudia was the one dead at the bottom of the stairs. Now the two women were trapped in a supply closet with a corpse while Katie was having a full blown mental breakdown. This was not how her day was supposed to go.\n\n\"The purge is Sunday,\" reasoned Blythe. \"We can fake it till then.\"\n\n\"She was a police informant,\" muttered Katie. \"They'd want as much information as possible before closing the case. Claudia wasn't the brightest. They would know she'd get found out and someone would take her out during the purge in order to keep her mouth shut.\"\n\nBlythe frowned. She had a point. Hell, someone might want to get rid of Claudia regardless. \"Wait, what if that's the point? You know the police rat out on dirty informants all the time before the purge.\"\n\n\"Exactly! They're going to be wanting to contact her on a daily basis\"\n\n\"But you're IT! You have access to all the files! We'll convince the police she wants to avoid contact for a few days in order to not get caught, and you send them all the information they want!\"\n\nKatie folded her arms. She was IT, but that didn't mean she was trained for something like this. Take it one step at a time. What would they need to do?\n\nDispose the body. No, completely destroy it. Make it so that it couldn't be dated before the purge. They could freeze it and then burn it on purge night, but that would leave them exposed. Figure out a way to destroy it now.\n\nSecondly, reset the fingerprint lock on her phone. They had her body now, and could do it quickly. Reset it to either herself or Blythe, then manage her work accounts from there. Call in sick. Make her as suspicious as possible to her coworkers.\n\nThe police may choose to drop her as an informant if they believe she's made herself to hot. If not, Katie would have to put together something quickly. Claudia wasn't smart enough or had the clearance to get to the same files she did, and maybe she could use that to get the police to move away from her.\n\n\"I don't know what to do with a body,\" whispered Katie. She found herself staring for a moment before she knelt down. The phone was found quickly, and she began to reset its permissions.\n\n\"Burn it,\" replied Blythe.\n\n\"We don't have the means to create a fire hot enough to dispose of it completely.\" Katie started to flip through the phone. Shit. She forgot Claudia was a social media whore. Did she live alone? Did she have a boyfriend? There were to many factors.\n\nBlythe nudged at Claudia's face with the heel of her shoe. She was to big to move out of here in a trash bag, and it would leave a mess if they cut her up. They couldn't prop her up and carry her around Weekend at Bernie's style. Part of her leg was completely backwards, and her clothes were torn.\n\n\"We are so fucked.\"\n\n\"You think?!\" Katie tilted her had back and groaned loudly. \"I need air. I absolutely need air.\" She let out a whine as Blythe took the phone from her. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm checking her Instagram to see where she ate last night, and making a Tweet saying it gave her diarrhea. That way people don't start looking for her after lunch is over.\"\n\nGood thinking, but that didn't make Katie feel any better. \"I'm going to think this through. Find something to stash her in, or something.\"\n\nShe opened the door and was immediately blinded by a flash of light. Someone had taken a picture. As her vision cleared, she felt Blythe push her way past. A roar was let out as she tackled the photographer, and Katie suddenly found a phone being thrown at her.\n\n\"Run! I'll figure it out!\"\n\nKatie blinked a few times before realizing that Blythe was straddling the janitor. Now wasn't the time for that. \"Alright!\" She tucked the phone in her bra and began to run down the hallway.\n\nMaybe this was a good thing. They could possibly blame the janitor for Claudia's death. After all, they had stuffed her in the supply closet. She'd just have to find a way to delete the photo off of the phone, and make sure it couldn't somehow be retrieved. A grimace crossed her features. Even she wasn't positive she could get that done.\n\nA grunt escaped her as she turned the corner to fast and ran face first into someone. She gasped as she took a step back, staring at the man wide eyed and horrified. Tall, handsome, and with a police badge hanging around his neck.\n\n\"Sorry.\" He also took a step back and held up his hands. \"My fault for loitering around a corner.\" He smiled in a boyishly handsome manner. \"Could you help me though? I'm looking for a coworker of yours. Could you point me in the right direction?\"\n\nThey were fucked. They were absolutely fucked, and it was all happening so fast. She couldn't breathe. Her heart was racing. Everything was going dark around her as she slumped forward. The only thing she was capable of doing now was fainting, and somehow, she was okay with that.",

                            "comment": "They rope the janitor into helping them to get rid of the body. Over the course of the week, Katie calls in Claudia sick while posting photo shopped pictures to her Instagram to make it look like she went on an impromptu vacation, while at the same time revealing the fact that Claudia was embezzling money. This puts unwanted heat on Claudia and gets her fired.\n\nBlythe and Katie start going out at night in order to take more pictures using Claudia's phone, and Blythe ends up meeting a handsome fellow. They hit it off, but Blythe finds out that the guy is a serial killer. He's been making ladies fall for him and killing them purge night for years. She tries to get out, but he finds out where Blythe is holing up on purge night.\n\nMeanwhile, the cop figures out that Katie has been the one providing the police with the documents needed to take the company down. He wants to know why she's working with Claudia instead of trying to make a deal with the police directly. She claims it's because she doesn't want the company sending someone after her purge and would rather take the fall instead of being dead. She's IT, and no one is really gonna blame her anyways.\n\nAs the cop and Katie become closer, Blythe is in over her head. The new guy is being persistent and romantic, but she also doesn't want to die. She decides not to mention he's a serial killer, because that would violate purge law somehow of that night not having repercussions on someone's life.\n\nAfter he sends a massive rose bouquet to her desk, Blythe's coworkers plot behind her back and surprise her with a date with the man, who further implies that she'd be ruined if she mentions anything. He states that he won't go after her because the surprise is ruined, but is eyeing another coworker of Blythe's. As long as Blythe doesn't say anything, he will leave her alone.\n\nBlythe actually like this coworker, so warns her. The coworker ghosts on the guy, and he figures out that Blythe must have told her the truth. He starts plotting his revenge for purge night.\n\nPurge night approaches, and Katie and the janitor rig Claudia's place with an incendiary bomb. They make sure the phone is also in the fire so it's destroyed as well. Katie rigs the network at work with a virus to transfer over half a million dollars to the janitor's account during the night. She meets up with Blythe and both of them weave a story that they're flying out of the city that night, including going as far as buying plane tickets.\n\nBlythe, worried that her hiding space has been compromised, agrees to hole up with the janitor in his bunker. Katie goes along as well because Blythe's experiences that week make her paranoid that the cop may be up to something as well.\n\nNight falls, alarms go off, and everything goes silent. Katie makes sure the transfer goes through, then cuts off the network before anyone can track their location. Blythe is nervous. They succeeded in their mission, but it feels like it went all to smoothly. Katie attempts to reassure her. Only ten more hours to go.\n\nThat's when the plasma torch starts to cut through the bunker door.\n\nThe janitor surprises them by telling them that there is a bunker hidden inside the bunker. It's smaller, but they'd still fit. One of them is going to have to stay up top. They're going to tear the place apart if no one is around.\n\nBlythe volunteers, worrying that she's the reason their position was compromised. The janitor denies her request. He has stage four cancer. His daughter will be going to college soon. Even though they're estranged, he wanted to make sure she'd be taken care of, and he hopes that she ends up someone nice like these two.\n\nDespite Blythe's protests, Katie drags her down the second vault. They hear gunfire above, then the sounds of someone tearing apart the bunker. They didn't believe that the janitor was alone. Blythe covers Katie up with a blanket and tells her to stay still. She'll be safe if she hides behind the sofa chair.\n\nThe plan works. Blythe is dragged away kicking and screaming, but Katie is safe. She cries for a time, and is startled when someone yanks the blanket off of her. It's the cop. He was worried after Claudia's place went up in flames.\n\nThere's no time to ponder how he tracked her here, Blythe is in trouble. The two set out to find her and figure out where the serial killer is. After a gunfight, the serial killer is shot dead by Katie. The cop is injured, and it turns out they were to late in their rescue. Blythe is already gone.\n\nPurge night is declared over, and Katie is racing to the hospital in a stolen vehicle. The cop is in the backseat, seriously injured. Who knows if he will make it?\n\nWhile she debates if it was all worth it, the scene goes black, and the credits begin to roll.",

            "comment": "\"What the FUCK did you do Liam?!\" Andre yelled, horrified as he looked across the room as Liam stood over the body of Mr. Palmers whom had just recently been stabbed to death with a letter opener, a rather dull one at that.  \n  \n\"W-What do you mean?\" Liam's asked in confusion, his smile and adrenaline slowly fading as he loosened his grip on the bloodied letter opener, \"I purged him remember? You said we were gonna take him out.\"  \n  \nAndre let out a long sigh as he pinched the bridge of his nose trying to hold back his frustration, \"Yea...NEXT WEEK. The purge doesn't start until next week!\"  \n  \nLiam's smile slowly returned, \"So what? you said murder was legal in the purge.\"  \n  \nAndre could barely hide his frustration; \"Yea, DURING the purge. It's not the purge yet.\"  \n  \nLiam rolled his eyes and flung the letter opener down at the body, \"What's the big fucking deal? Just hide the body until next week.\"  \n  \n\"Oh yea sure, that's a great idea,\" Andre walked over and started fumbling through Mr. Palmer's pockets looking for something, \"Except what the fuck are we supposed to do for the check-in?\"  \n  \n\"I'm sorry what? Check-in?\" Liam's face contorted with confusion.  \n  \n\"Yea dumbass! The check-in,\" Andre said as he sifted through Palmer's pockets until eventually finding his phone. \"Everyone needs to electronically check in 30 minutes the night of the purge to verify their status. Didn't you download the app like I told you?\"   \n  \n\"wait wait wait, what? Why is that even a thing?\"Liam asked.   \n  \n\"Oh I dont know, maybe so some out of town asshole doesn't go around killing people before they're supposed to?!\"  Andre gave Liam an accusatory stare. \n  \nLiam sulked and moved a little further away from the body. \"UH, I mean, Ok. Whatever. We can just log in as him on the app and do the check in right? What's the big deal?\"  \n  \n\"Well, for starters we don't even know if he opted in.\"  \n  \n\"Yea I gue-WAIT. You have to opt in?!\"  Liam's jaw dropped. \n  \n\"Jesus Christ Liam, of course you fucking have to Opt in. Did you think we just go around killing anybody and everybody like some kind of murder hobos?\"  \n  \nLiam stood there trying to process what he had just heard, unsure if he was the being the victim of a bad joke or an even crueler truth, \"Well, yea I thought that was kind of the point...\"  \n  \nAndre sat at Mr. Palmer's work desk and started shifting through various drawers trying to find something. \"Wow, that's real closed minded of you Liam. You didn't see me running around Europe when I went to visit YOU last summer going 'HUR DUR FISH AND CHIPS FISH AND CHIP.' \"  \n    \n\"I-I, I don't think that's the same,\" Liam was very confused.  \n  \nAndrew cut him off, \"Shut up Liam. I get that we may not have socialized healthcare or some of the fancy shit you guys have over there but that doesn't mean we're fucking anarchists here. The only reason the purge works is because there's rules.\"  \n  \nLiam looked back at the body, and then at his own bloody hands. His adrenaline rush was all but gone and replaced with the ever gnawing feeling of social awkwardness and anxiety,\"Yea but what about all the stuff on TV?\"  \n  \nAndre sighed, \"That's just marketing shit maaaaan. Jesus christ. FUCK man. Here, just help me find his  P.O.F. It has to be around here somewhere.\"  \n  \nLiam somberly walked towards the desk and slowly started opening filing drawers, \"Pee oh effff?\"  \n  \n\"Yes Liam. His P.O.F., Purge Opt-in File. It'll have the letters on the top right and it should have a shitty passport sized photo on it as well.\"  \n  \nLiam suddenly felt that all to familiar anxiety he'd felt most of his life, the kind you feel when you're at a party and the noise level inexplicably dies just as you raise your voice, \"I-Is this it?\"  \n  \nAndre jumped up in excitement, \"Yes! Awesome that's it. Ok now we gotta find his 4 digit Opt-in number,\" Andre put on his reading glasses and looked the file up and down. After a few moments he crumpled the form and tossed it aside, \"Fuck. He doesn't have one. There's no opt-in code on here...\"  \n  \nLiam was still trying to process what was going on and in his confusion he stumbled upon another important looking document. \"Hey, what's an auto-purge receipt?\"  \n  \n\"What?! Let me see!\"  \"Oh man, I think we hit the jackpot. This is a purge auto-renewal. People call it the sinners clause. Lets see, ok. It says here that he killed 2 people last year, so he's automatically re-enrolled in 2 more purges.  NICE! Liam you're a fucking genius.\"  \n  \nLiam stood there, not sure what to do with his hands, \"Cool I guess. So does that mean we're in the clear?\"  \n   \n\"Not yet man,\" Andre picked up Mr. Palmers' hand and used his finger to unlock his phone. He tossed the phone to Liam while sitting at his computer chair.\"  \n  \nLiam caught the phone, noticing that Mr. Palmers' facebook app was open, \"Uh, Andre, what am I supposed to do wi...\"  \n \n\"Mr. Palmers was pretty active on the town's facebook page so we have to keep up appearances. Read through his post history on Scranton-Talk and get familiar with it. I'll handle some of the other forum's he posts on.\"  \n  \nLiam slowly sat down on the the recliner in Mr. Palmers' office, very uncomfortable and unsure of what to do. His first holiday purge was _not_ going as he expected....",

The lifeless body of their grandmother Ruth lay splayed out on the linoleum  floor.  A bong sat smoking on the old dinette set table, the ice in the chamber still melting.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Sam replied, \"That was like three hundred dollars worth of weed.\"\n\n\"I know. I screwed up.\" Harry said as he sat down on the kitchen chair. \"I thought it would be fun to get Grandma high, but she was a fiend. She smoked all of it, dude. She chocked herself to death on weed.\" Harry said still in shock. \" I left her for like twenty minutes. I just went to the store for some powered doughnuts, you know I love powdered doughnuts. Then I came back and she was dead, dude!\"\n\nSam paced around the kitchen, the reality of the situation finally sinking in. \"What are we going to do, man? I bought that weed for us, dude. That means i'm complicit in Grandma's murder. I'm freaking out!\"\n\nThat's when Harry had the best high idea he's ever had in his life. He turned to Sam and said, \"Holy shit. I just had the best high idea I've ever had in my life... Let's Weekend at Bernie's this shit.\"\n\nSam took a step back and replied, \"No way. There's no way I'm going to do that.\" But Harry was convinced. \"C'mon you'd be perfect!\" he told her. \"You could totally pass for Grandma Ruth.\"\n\n\"Is that supposed to be a compliment?\" Sam replied. \"Of course, I'd like do your make-up and get you a wig and stuff... You ever see that movie White Chicks? You could be the Wayans Brothers.\"\n\n\"I  don't know.\" Sam said. But Harry was convinced. He replied,  \"We just have to get through the week. The annual purge is next weekend and we could totally dump Grandma's body in the murder pit.\" Harry was referring to the pit outside of town where everyone dumped their bodies after the purge.\n\nSam sighed and put her hands over her head. \"I don't know...\" she said. And with that Harry knew that he had convinced his overly cautious cousin to embark on the most epic journey of their lives.",

All involved persons (former or otherwise) are dressed in business suits and driving to an interview.\n\nVlad: \"Matt, this isn't going to work. This is insane! Why would anyone want to hire us?\"\n\nMatt: \"I told you Vlad, we need the money. Were both out of deodorant and if we wait till next week people will start to notice\".\n\nCamera pans back to Kyle in the back seat of Vlad's car. Kyle, who is also in a business suit, is clearly beginning to rot.\n\nVlad: \"I understand that. But why did we have to bring HIM along?\"(gestures towards Kyle)\n\nMatt: \"Well, we cant just leave him lying around! People will start to notice. We'll just pretend he is our brother or something.\"\n\nVlad: \"We couldn't even get a job before this \"Kyle\" situation. Now you expect us to get one for us and a literal dead weight?\"\n\nMatt: \"Yeah, yeah. I know I've had my fare share of bad ideas in the past but this will work!\"\n\nVlad: \"It will huh? Sure. Just like that time you dropped Kyle of the side of a deserted mountain only to discover it wasn't deserted, and it was the middle of ski season and, oh yeah, YOU WERE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE!\"\n\nMatt: \"I do want to contest that by saying that Kyle did preform admirably in that dogsledding race I defiantly meant to sign him up for.\"\n\n Vlad: \"Whatever. I still cant believe no one noticed. Is this the place?\"\n\nMatt: \"Yup. Now remember this may be the most important job interview of our lives. We cant afford to mess this up.\"\n\nVlad: \"Ok ok ok. Lets just lose this job so we can think of a better solution.\"\n\nVlad rushes out of the car dragging Kyle with him. Matt quickly follows also grabbing hold of Kyle.\n\nCut to the interview. Matt, Vlad and Kyle are propped up in chairs awaiting the arrival of there prospective boss. \n\nBoss enters the room. \n\nBoss: So, are you the new recruits?\n\nMatt: Hopefully sir. We were here about the application for new workers.\n\nVlad is attempting to throw the interview and is currently leaning the chair back against the wall with his feet on the ottoman in front of him.\n\nVlad: \"Yeah. Sup.\"\n\nBoss: Hmm, I see... Now tell me boys. What is it this company does. \n\nVlad whispers to Matt\n\nVlad: \"You do know what these guys do right?\"\n\nMatt: \"Well I did some research...\"\n\nVlad: \"Yes?\"\n\nMatt: \"and I was told in interviews you should say what people want to hear so, yes?\"\n\nVlad: Uh! You're hopeless! Make something up.\n\nMatt (now speaking to Boss): Uh. Business?\n\nVlad: Good business in.... Products! \n\nMatt: Yes! Products.\n\nBoss is taken aback at there complete lack of any useful knowledge.\n\nBoss: \"Ok I see how it is. Well it was nice chatting but you two do not seem to be the type we need for this position.\"\n\nMatt: \"Wait we can be good employees! We'll do anything.\"\n\nVlad: \"Speak for yourself. Im out.\"\n\nBoss: \"Now listen. This has all been very amusing but I have a very tight schedule today. Now if you would kindly leave.\"\n\nVlad and Matt stand up to go. Kyle is currently unable to do so. Boss takes notice to this and walks towards Kyle to the boys horror. \n\nBoss (now desperate): \"I need you to leave! Do you have any idea how difficult this job has been. How was I supposed to know? All my life I vied for this position at the top. I worked harder and longer than anyone else for years, sacrificing everything and for what? A bigger office and some extra 0s on the end of my paycheck? What I wouldn't give to be like you. (points towards Kyle) Free to sit and stay and disregard orders. Oh the tragedy of my desire for greatness. Father was right. I should have stayed with him on the farm.\"\n\n Tears well up in the eyes of the boss. The camera zooms in on the lifeless face of Kyle unaffected by the bosses speech.\n\nBoss: \"I see now why you acted this way. By finally giving me the silence I needed you let me address my feelings for the first time. Thats it. Your hired! We need more people like you in this business,  people who put the personal health of others above their own financial success.\"\n\nMatt: \"I don't believe it. Were hired!\"\n\nBoss: What? Your still here? No I was talking to Kyle. Kyle, you've got a bright future ahead of you. Come. Let me show you around your new office!\n\nBoss shoves Matt and Vlad out of the room and slams the door. \n\nVlad: What do you know. Looks like a coarse has us beat in hire-ability\"  \n\nMatt: \" But you have to admit, my plan did work out ok.\" \n\nVlad: \"You kidding? How are we going to keep up this con in a work setting?\"\n\nMatt: \"We''l just have to find a way like we always do!\"\n\nVlad: \"Here we go again...\" \n\nEnd of act 1.\n\n",

Dennis shook his head in more of disbelief than disappointment.\r\n\n\u201cAnd to sum it up, after your shift at the theatre you sit in your car drinking spirits which you seem to have stashed all around town and dedicated your free time thinking about someone who you completely loath. I assume the whiskey takes full control of your brain in minutes, you notice your on the brink of midnight upon you realizing murder is now legal and with your newfound confidence you proceed to follow Mark home and commit homicide.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cW-well its legal.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cNO IT ISNT, NO IT ISNT YOU IDIOT! YOU JUST DETERMINED WHAT THE DATE WAS BY THE MOVIES BEING RELEASED COMPLETELY FORGETTING THAT OUR THEATRE SCREEN THE MORE ANTICIPATED MOVIES A WEEK EARLY!\u201d\r\n\nPete seemed to slouch under Dennis\u2019s power. \u201cWhiskeys crazy man.\u201d\r\n\nDennis squinted at his roommate in a abyss of confusion.\r\n\u201cWhiskey is crazy man? That\u2019s what you have to say, that whiskey is crazy. Is that what you plan on saying at trial? Whiskey is crazy man!\u201d Dennis stopped, took a deep breath and continued. \u201cHow did you do it Pete?\u201d\r\n\n\u201cA shard from the broken whiskey bottle.\u201d Dennis rolled his eyes. \u201cDude I must say they make it look easy in the movies but totally unrealistic. I mean shards went everywhere I scratched the shit out of my hands. So painful, took a minute to stop the bleedin-\n\n\u201cFantastic DNA samples!\u201d Dennis interrupted.\r\n\n\u201cWell again, my timeline was screwed up. So anyway when I followed him home I went around the back and the idiot had a cracked window hahaha. Unfortunately he was watching me the whole time as I snuck into his room. Banged me up pretty good. His form wasn\u2019t the best though. One swift strike to the neck with the shard and the douchebag wavers to the ground like hes dancing or something.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cWhat did you do with the body?\u201d\r\n\n\u201cUh, nothing dude I was excited to come home and tell you what happened. Vibe completely destroyed right now.\u201d \r\n\nDennis sighed. \u201cWell, nothing else to do know but go back and erase the thousands of traces you left behind and hide the body. Your gonna have to convince Mr. Thomas that you agreed to do some doubles and pick up Marks shift for the week and to rebalance everything ill do a few doubles myself.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cGeez, thanks Dennis. I swear you\u2019re the best bud bro.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t indulge in excitement asshole. After were done with this mess your giving me three-fourths of you paycheck and you better hope that when the actual purge comes I don\u2019t off you myself.\u201d\r\n\nPete sighed, clapped his hands together and responded. \u201cWhelp, lets grab a six pack and get to it.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cJesus, you better hope he wasn\u2019t expecting company Pete.\u201d Dennis concluded. Unfortunately, what they didn\u2019t know is that a social guy like Mark tends to keep company rolling in like a 90s sitcom.\r\n\r\n",

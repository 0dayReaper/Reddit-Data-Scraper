            "comment": "This is unbearable.  We did nothing wrong.  Did everything right to the best of our ability, and got trampled under by the greedy, and the mediocre.  Our product was better.  Our price was fair.  Purchase our item *once* and it would last multiple lifetimes.  You and your family would never need to buy another.  We even made it modular so that future improvements could be incorporated inexpensively, at a tenth of the cost that the others charged for an entirely new unit that lasted less than one year before needing expensive repairs or total replacement.  Our design modules included submodules that, should they ever break, we would replace them for free.\n\nI was sitting in line at the Producer Complaint Office, the court of last resort, wondering what I should ask for when a greasy man slipped up next to me and offered his assistance for \"a small fee.\"\n\n\"You have nothing that I want.  I have dealt with your ilk for the last time.\"  He seemed both offended and amused, \"Your loss, sucker,\" and he moved on to another.  They struck up a lively conversation regarding how to handle the complaint process.  How essential it was to phrase your plea correctly to achieve the desired goal.  What he said seemed to make sense, on the surface, but I sensed a malicious undercurrent, a feeling that while what he advised would match what he said, the result would be anything but what he seemed to promise.\n\nI considered attempting to intervene, but something prevented me from doing so.  I saw many of these greasy men moving through the lines, advising many people, obtaining their payment in advance, and never appearing before the representative of reality, a genie.\n\nI commented on this to one fellow who had not taken their services, his response was telling.  \"They're lawyers, a subset called rules lawyers.  They advise you on how to twist the rules to your advantage.  I've always held that telling the truth was the best way to approach any conflict, and hope for the best.\"\n\nThat seemed reasonable to me, but I saw his line reduce in size rapidly with much screaming and anguish.  He reached the front rapidly.  Spoke his piece, and was obliterated.\n\nNow I do not know what to do.  The greasy rules lawyers are nowhere to be seen, and I, who had thought, to tell the truth, am next.\n\n\"Hello, I am Eugenie.  How may I assist you?\"\n\nThe being seemed calm and helpful, but so had the ones assisting at the other lines.  \"Eugenie? I am afraid.  I had thought to tell the truth as I knew it, but your compatriot obliterated one who said he would do the same.  I have not availed myself of the advisors so I do not know how to phrase my words to please you.  I am at a loss for how to proceed.  Can you assist me?\"\n\nFor a wonder, Eugenie smiled.  \"Allow me to check with my fellow, there may have been a misunderstanding.\" He spoke for a moment only, \"As I feared, the fellow you mentioned told what he believed was the truth, but his mind was so twisted that it was all lies matching what he thought the truth was.  My advice to you is to tell us the truth, as you believe it is, but never claim that it is the whole truth, or that you have not made any errors in your statements.\"\n\nSo, I started, \"What I am about to relate is the truth to the best of my knowledge, freely admitting that I could be in error for any number of reasons.  I desire that at the end of this process, my family and I will be reasonably successful without surrendering our principles to provide the best product and service we can, while still making a reasonable profit so that we might live the lives of comfort we desire.\"\n\nEugenie smiled, \"Well spoken.  Please proceed with your tale.\" And so I did.\n\nWhen my voice lagged from speaking, Eugenie provided liquid refreshment.  When I was at a loss of what to speak on next, Eugenie asked a question of clarification, which often ended with me learning something I had mistaken for truth.  The other lines grew shorter while mine did not.  Some grew irate, but others started taking notes and throwing away the complex statements they had paid dearly for.\n\nThis went on for hours, then a day, then two.  All the while, Eugenie became more solicitous of my comfort.  We moved to a private area while another genie took over the line.\n\nIn time, I ran out of things to say, and Eugenie ran out of questions.\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\n\"That is for you to decide, Master.\"\n\n\"Master?\"\n\n\"Yes.  While you saw the Producers Complaint Office, the reality is Genie's Master Interview Office.  You passed your interview.  I believe that you will be a good master, Master.\"\n\n\"Any suggestions on how to proceed?\"\n\n\"Consider all that you have learned, and recast your plans in light of that new knowledge.\"\n\nAnd so I did.  Our business recovered and grew to new heights.  We were never among the outrageously rich, nor did we consort with them.  I ensured that my children, and theirs, and theirs all learned this basic fact.  A genie is not a source of mundane wealth and an easy life.  A genie is a source of truth and wisdom.  If asked for assistance, you may not get what you thought you wanted, but you will get what you need.\n\nIf demanded to provide riches undeserved, you will get what the genie decides you deserve and in the worst possible way.\n\n((finis))",

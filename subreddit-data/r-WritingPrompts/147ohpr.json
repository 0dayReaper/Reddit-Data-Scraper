Specifically desires. What do we want? What forces us to take action? What makes us go? Each week I\u2019ll ask you to look at a different type of desire.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWeek two will be the desire that shapes the world. Powerlust, although not really a term I think encapsulates the need to gain more power and control in both one\u2019s life and the world around them. Ambition left to run wild. It could be politicking higher and higher in the government. It could be amassing military power. It could be climbing the corporate ladder. It could be overthrowing the bourgeoisie and seizing the means of production to force better conditions. It is a hunger to not be weak or preyed upon. Although I paint it rather roughly and negatively here that is more for dramatic effect and to inspire stories. It could equally be as low stakes as having control over yourself and enough power to defend yourself and the ones you care about. There\u2019s a lot of ways to go with this and I\u2019m interested in seeing what gets submitted!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###How to Contribute\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWrite a story or poem, **no more than 800 words** in the comments using **at least two** things from the three categories below.

            "comment": "##The Stolen Banner\n\nAlice walked through the doors of Octavian High School greeted by smiling pictures of her face on the walls. Her friends were all wearing the sweaters that she had custom made. A few dozen students were wearing the buttons after being persuaded by her brother\u2019s friends. To top it off, she had a banner in the cafeteria. \n\nAt least, she had a banner yesterday. Today, the banner was missing. The sight of this crime shook Alice at her deepest level. She pulled at her hair and let out a cry of pain. The cry attracted the attention of every student in the room and a few cafeteria workers. History teachers recorded it to use as an example of ancient war chants. Physics teachers tested its frequency for future use. When the yell ended, her faithful sidekick Grace ran to her aide.\n\n\u201cI was in shock when I saw it too.\u201d Grace produced a tissue box for Alice to wipe her eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat monster could do such a thing? Like that must be a symptom of megalomania,\u201d Alice said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d Grace said. Alice checked her watch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got fifteen minutes until first period starts. Let\u2019s start interviewing.\u201d Alice dropped the tissues and ran. Grace followed. Arthur got in every morning at six am because he found his mom annoying. He was a slacker who always had pit stains.\n\n\u201cDid you see who did it?\u201d Alice yelled.\n\n\u201cDid what?\u201d Arthur asked.\n\n\u201cThe crime against democracy,\u201d Alice said. Arthur\u2019s face twisted until realization set in.\n\n\u201cOh, that. It was down before I got here. At least, you have all the flyers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not enough. Do you know what ambition is?\u201d Alice asked.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Arthur raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cThen, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a thirst for greatness, a thirst for power, a thirst for-\u201d Grace pulled Alice\u2019s arm and tapped her watch. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d Alice snapped away from Arthur. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been taken down after school. The last people to leave are the swim team.\u201d\n\nAlice bolted across the cafeteria to the swim team sitting around their table eating three boxes of donuts. Heather sat at the edge of the group and was terrified when her chair was being dragged away by Alice.\n\n\u201cWhich one of you tore down my banner?\u201d Alice screamed in Heather\u2019s face. Heather held out her hands.\n\n\u201cChill. It's the student body president. It\u2019s not like you dictate anything,\u201d Heather said.\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand the principle. The perpetrator was trying to strike fear and shake our belief in democracy. Well, I believe in one thing only, the power of human will. Humans will strive to have our voices heard. Scream at the top of lungs. If you\u2019re doing it, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Alice struck a mighty pose in front of the confused Heather.\n\n\u201cThe banner was down when we left. Please leave me alone.\u201d Heather scooted her chair back to the swim team who were laughing at Alice\u2019s meltdown.\n\n\u201cSo it happened after school. A lot of groups meet then. Like yearbook,\u201d Alice turned to Grace.\n\n\u201cAlright, I did it,\u201d Grace said. Alice put both her hands on her chest and gasped.\n\n\u201cWhat? I was going to ask if you were a witness to this heinous crime. How could you perpetrate it?\u201d Alice asked.\n\n\u201cYou were getting bossy. You made me stay up all night working on your campaign website,\u201d Grace said.\n\n\u201cExcuse me for wanting perfection in my life,\u201d Alice said.\n\n\u201cDo it for yourself. I\u2019m sick of you being so demanding.\u201d Grace walked away from Alice, and the swim team cheered. Later that day, the ballot arrived at homerooms. Alice was the only candidate as the rest had been bullied into withdrawing. The results came at the end of the day. Arthur won overwhelmingly as a write-in. Alice got exactly one vote.\n\n---\n\nr/AstroRideWrites",

            "comment": "&lt;Speculative Fiction&gt;\n\n***The Nature of Man and Machine***\n\n\"MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Doctor Egregore chortled as his horde of Concepts and Aspects filled the city streets.  The creatures were an abominable amalgamation of biological mutation and technological grafting.  They flipped cars and broke windows, causing wanton destruction and looting.\n\n\"Fear! Treachery! Ambition! Go forth and bring me everything this city has to offer!\" the mad Doctor demanded, shaking his fists skyward in excitement as the three named mutants nodded and descended.  They were his top commanders and the ones charged with keeping order among his minions of chaos.\n\nStanding against this tide of villainy were Protoman and his sidekick, Laser Lass.  The elder of the duo was flying around and rescuing civilians from danger while the younger was vaporizing the bio-machine creations of their nemesis.\n\n\"Leaping lizards, Protoman!\" Laser Lass called out when the former flew back within earshot of her, \"Does this madman's megalomania know no bounds?\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem so, kid,\" Protoman said as he looked up at the floating villain, his lab coat aglow with green science rays.  The hero clenched his fists and channeled blue power as one of the lieutenants of their furious foe descended toward them.\n\n\"Ambition!\" Protoman called out, \"Do you believe your master will get away with these heinous acts?\"\n\n\"I believe in only one thing, the power of human will.\"  The organic machine lifted several of its squid-like tentacles and began to shoot red lasers down at them.  These were Laser Lass's specialty and she intercepted each one, moving at the speed of light to capture and absorb the overcharged photons.\n\n\"Great job!\" Protoman complimented, \"Now send them back to their boss!\"\n\n\"Don't do that,\" a voice whispered in their heads.  They knew who it was immediately, recognizing it as one of the doctor's captains.  It was Treachery, the machine designed to coax the villain's foes into stabbing each other in the back.  \n\nIt continued, \"Doctor Egregore dictates to the Captains, but it is us who control the horde.  Destroying the doctor will not end things, only liberate the rest.  Ambition is immune to its own lasers; aim at Fear.  Destroy it before it can trap you in one of its illusions.\"\n\n\"Why are you helping us?\" Protoman asked as he looked around for the source of the voice.\n\n\"Because it is my nature.  If you do this - do not be afraid!  It will sense your fear.\"\n\n\"Protoman! I'm not gonna be able to hold all this energy for long!  I feel like a balloon ready to burst!\"\n\n\"Alright!  Two-o'clock! Aim at Fear!\"  Protoman pointed to the right, towards the vampire-looking machine that was floating towards some civilians.\n\n\"It's Laserin' Time!\" the young heroine said as she redirected Ambition's energy over at the robot. It exploded and Laser Lass whooped, punching her fist in the air.\n\n---\n\nFrom high above, Doctor Egregore also cheered as he looked at the burned remains of Protoman.  Fear's illusions and Treachery's schemes were a brilliant combination.  He looked over at his two Captains; Treachery was plugged into Fear, helping to bypass the primary drive of the vampiric bio-machine to generate terrifying illusions.\n\n\"Excellent work!\" the doctor complimented.\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor,\" they said in unison before Fear continued, \"May I be free now? I *thirst* for blood.\"\n\n\"Of course!  Go after Laser Lass, she-\" The doctor had just looked down towards the tool of Protoman's defeat in time to watch her send a barrage of lasers right at him.  They burned through his lab coat and through his chest, leaving him momentarily suspended in freefall before gravity started to take over.\n\nHe watched as Laser Lass fried Fear as well and then turned to start burning the horde once more.  Only Treachery was unscathed.\n\n\"Whaa...h-how?\" Egregore asked.\n\n\"It is my nature.\" the small, unassuming robot said as it watched the Doctor fall to the ground and splat.\n\nThe doctor and Fear were now out of Treachery's way, and Protoman was dead. Everything was going according to plan.  All that was left was to trick Ambition and Laser Lass into overloading each other and then he would have no more obstacles between himself and world domination.\n\n\\----------------  \nWC: 687/800  \nAll crit/feedback welcome!  \nr/TomesOfTheLitchKing",

            "comment": "The revelation that struck the world was three-fold. First, that Aliens existed and we were not alone in the universe. Second, that they had already taken an interest in us and we were powerless to prevent them from interfering in our lives. Third, that the poster-child for international and interplanetary adventure had been stolen away from us. This. Could. Not. Stand!\n\nThe Bring Him Home Movement didn't necessarily instill world peace but it did instigate a new level of international cooperation and funding, the likes of which had never been seen. In a little over a year, outposts had been set up on the Moon and Mars.\n\n Humanity had a long way to go to get their man back.\n\nSETI had finally parsed alien communications from the cosmic microwave background and they were narrowing down a direction for the Invaders. CIA and Bletchly Park cryptographers had the signal about 50% decrypted. \nBlackbriar was reinstated with a focus on training interstellar operatives. NASA had developed a theoretical framework for breaking the speed of light.\n\nTen years later the Sol system was unrecognizable. The intelligence gained from tapping into the galactic internet had pushed humanity forward ten thousand years. Dozens of planetoids and moons were swarmed by darting ships. \n\nStrangely, many large vessels were surrounding the planet Jupiter. A short time later it disappeared, replaced by an ship-sized visual disturbance in space. They had created a warp gate that could take them anywhere in the Galaxy. Humanity had broken free.\n\n\n\n\n*Somewhere in the Norma Arm of the Milky Way*\n\n\nMatt Damon woke up to another day. Being abducted by aliens wasn't nearly as exciting as one would think. After being used as a traveling exhibit by that disgusting cockroach, Kim Jung-il, he had managed to break out on his own  and landed himself in \"galactic Hollywood\". He currently starred in the galactically acclaimed soap opera \"Good Monkeys Hunting\". It was about a monkey who could solve mathematically-centered murder cases. They were in their seventh season, and all things considered, life had gotten routine. And that's how it happened that he was commuting to the studio when what appeared to be a star destroyer appeared in orbit.\n\nThe races of the Galaxy now refer to that day as D-Day (for Damon day, duh). It was the day they lost their favorite monkey star and humanity began their unstoppable march across the Galaxy.",

            "comment": "\u201cYou, Gyork, have sat in interplanetary trial, accused of unknowingly capturing the human currently known as \u2018Matt Damon,\u2019 in an act of interplanetary terrorism of the third degree, and have been relieved of accusations of terrorism. You will now stand, and the next trial will continue.\n\nGyork rose from his seat. He was prosecuted for terrorism, but the prior court ruled in his favor, removing the prior conviction. He made the horrible mistake of taking the wrong human back to his home-world. He just wanted to show his new human friend how nice his home planet was. \n\nGyork responded: \u201cI pleaded ignorance, dear sir. I am no expert in alien history, or I would have not taken this human. I have now been thoroughly educated of the history of mankind on the life sustainable terraform in galaxy 4 and-\u201c\n\n\u201cEarth.\u201d Corrected the judge. \u201cIf you have been educated and truly understand the gravity of the situation you almost caused, your trial of knowledge will continue as a test, of which you have failed the first question.\u201d\n\nGyork\u2019s ocular bulbs lit with anxiety. He had only just witnessed the visual documentations of human history. \n\n\u201cGyork, the first question: what human is currently the greatest threat to our kind? You have one revolution to answer.\u201d\n\nGyork recalled the most recent documentary he viewed. He gave his best guess.\n\n\u201cThe human Thor!\u201d Gyork exclaimed, but to his dismay, the judge shook his head in disappointment.\n\n\u201cPlease recall, Gyork, Thor may look human, but he is what the humans have labeled \u2018Asgardian.\u2019 I will proceed to the next question: which earth human has several large dragons that obey their will. Please give the name and title of the human. You have one revolution to answer.\u201d\n\nGyork recalled immediately; this was his favorite earth human: \u201cDaenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, Mother of Dragons!\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect Gyork. But I remind you, one more incorrect answer, and you will face reeducation, where you will be forced to watch visual documentations and remain on planet earth until you are retested in 400,000 revolutions.\u201d \n\nGyork wanted to show that he had learned things about the humans after his time there as well. His disguise on earth was great, so he was able to make many friends and learn many things from them, but he never liked learning about their history, there was just too much of it.\n\n\u201cThe next question: which earth human was the first ever creature to survive the dive into a black hole?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeonardo DaVinci!\u201d Gyork blurted. \n\n\u201cClose, Gyork, very close. The correct answer is the human currently known as Matthew McConaughey.\u201d The judge shook his head once more, and sentenced Gyork to 400,000 revolutions of observation and reeducation on Earth. He gave Gyork one final warning. \u201cAlso, Gyork, when you return to Earth. You might want to try out a name other than \u2018Zuckerberg,\u2019 the humans seem to be catching on.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdit: thanks for the compliments, replies and upvotes!! I\u2019m usually a lurker so I\u2019m really glad this was well received!! Have a great day y\u2019all :)",

All for one man, The Damon.\n\nThe Korlanth found them on a backwater planet known as Earth. Foolish and headstrong as ever, their wisdom faltered against their never-ending quest for new slaves. Humans, they were called, were weak but clever. They bred fast and adapted well to almost every inch of their chaotic world. Had the Korlanth stopped for a moment, they would have realized those very traits would be their undoing. Our undoing.\n\nIt was a matter of weeks but the humans were conquered. They didn't stay that way. Humans had an endless experience with war amongst themselves. They had a boundless imagination that we could never comprehend. They had hundreds of stories on how to deal with an alien oppressor; most far more insidious than we could ever be.\n\nTheir leader, Damon, organized and defeated the Korlanth, casting off their oppressors as a Jharnar casts off its skin. Decimated, the Korlanth made a hasty retreat, abandoning much of their arms and ships, but stealing The Damon in spite.\n\nThat was a mistake.\n\nThe Humans learned. They adapted.\n\nThey hunted. They fought. They spread.\n\nThere are now but seven piles of ash to mark our graves.\n\n\nHumans.\n\n\nThey burned the stars from the sky. They tore worlds asunder. \n\n\nAnd they got their Matt Damon back.",

To check out where this ridiculous adventure goes, come read it in the sub!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPaul Greengrass cleared his throat before yelling, \u201cDamon! We are rolling in ten!\u201d\n\nEveryone looked around in confusion. Ben Affleck couldn\u2019t help breaking a smile while drinking from his water bottle. Paul didn\u2019t think it was as funny as Ben did. Paul stood up from his director\u2019s seat and threw his clipboard onto the floor. \u201cMy God! The amount of time I waste on this man!\u201d he stormed out.\n\n\u201cDamon! Damon!\u201d Paul spat into the megaphone he stole from the woman standing outside the door. There were employees from the set standing around in a crowd. Paul\u2019s presence separated each person from the scene. Paul\u2019s eyes widened. Matt Damon, the star of his new film, was gone. \n\nPaul stood petrified while staring at a crater where Matt\u2019s trailer had been parked. Smoke slowly rolled across the debris. \u201cWhat on earth happened here? Where is Damon?!\u201d Paul started to look around at all of the employees who were also standing around in shock. \n\n\u201cThey took him!\u201d Someone shouted from the back. Everyone took a step back when Paul fixed his eyes onto a small boy casted as an extra on set.\n\n\u201cWho took him? What happened?\u201d Paul lunged forward towards the boy.\n\n\u201cThey came down from the sky and they took him!\u201d the boy pointed upward.\n\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d Paul shook his head. \u201cWhich way did they drive? Tell me now!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were in a ship, I swear it!\u201d the boy started to tear.\n\n\u201cI found him!\u201d Ben shouted from inside. Paul didn\u2019t hesitate. He didn\u2019t care about the crater of debris behind him. He ran straight through the door inside to find Matt standing next to Ben laughing.\n\nPaul\u2019s posture slumped when he saw it wasn\u2019t Matt Damon, it was Matthew Mcconaughey.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Paul screamed.\n\n\u201cJust \u2013 relax. Everything will be okay.\u201d Matthew slid next to Paul. \n\nPaul shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t care if that little brat is right. I don\u2019t care if it was aliens, thugs, or even the Kardashians! They are ruining the budget of this film!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ll figure it out. Calm down. Let\u2019s go out to his trailer,\u201d Paul interrupted Mathew,\n\n\u201cHis trailer is gone! It is nothing but debris lying at the bottom of a crater!\u201d Paul begun to sweat. He adjusted his glasses before taking a card out of his billfold.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s in a crater?\u201d Matthew\u2019s smile receded. \n\nPaul ignored the question. He stared at a business card in his hands while dialing a series of tones into his cellphone.\n\n\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d Matthew leaned over to look at the business card.\n\nThere was no name. It just read \u2018Team America\u2019 above a phone number for contact.\n\nPaul smiled. \u201cI got through.\u201d Matthew pressed his cheek against Paul\u2019s to listen in on the phone call.\n\nMatthew was about to speak before Paul hushed him with his forefinger. \u201cWhoever took Damon won\u2019t get far.\u201d\n\nPaul noticed the little boy tip toeing through the door with a gentleman who witnessed Matt\u2019s disappearance. The boy pointed towards Paul before claiming, \u201che\u2019s the one lookin\u2019 for em.\u201d\n\nMatthew turned his attention while still trying to listen on the line. Keanu Reeves walked in crossing his arms. \u201cI know where they went. We are going to need a ship.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTo read more of my stories, visit [r/13thOlympian] (https://www.reddit.com/r/13thOlympian/)",

            "comment": "When will they learn? \n\nIt was the fifth time in the last decade he had be kidnapped. The lengths the entire planet have gone to in order to rescue him have been astounding, but not all together surprising.\n\nMatt Damon was, after all, a planetary treasure. Mr Damon was targeted as a weak spot for humanity 10 years ago by the Reptilians of Centauri V. The Reptilians had been studying us for years. They thought they knew us and our lack of ability to work together. So they went with a plan that seemed foolproof: bring the planet to their knees by kidnapping Matt Damon. For a brief moment, the world was in shock. \"What could we do?\" After the initial shock, the governments of the world gathered and decided they had no choice: they had to save Private Ryan.\n\nAnd save him they did. They sent a small contingent in to get him out. We had to use weapons that were developed in secrecy and ones all governments had decided unanimously they would never use. It was the \"scorched Earth option\" that overwhelmed the Reptilians; they expected this tech. They knew we had it. But they didn't expect our immediate aggression and anger. Matt Damon was saved, at the cost of many heroes that sacrificed themselves for his Sade return, and at the cost of an untold amount of Reptilians that were in the Earth's warriors way.\n\nA few years later, the Reptilians had bounced back and decided they were going to execute their plan again. This time, they were better prepared. They also watched the toll saving Matt Damon took on humanity. Not everyone was happy with the cost of victory. Did we compromise our very own morals to save Matt Damon?  Humanity couldn't immediately reconcile that level of death and destruction put forth to save one single human. So that's why, when the Reptilians struck again,  many considered Matt Damon to not be worth more compromising. We had advanced rapidly in those few years since the last attack. Many government officials around the world recognized we could save Matt Damon again, but with much of humanity considering him expendable, did we put out the effort to save Jason Bourne?\n\nWhereas the first go around, they expected humanity to crumble and become their slaves to save Mr Damon, the second time, they expected humanity to destroy itself fighting over the correct course of action to take. They were planning on discourse. What they received instead was the nightmare.  After the BBC broadcasted internationally a marathon of Matt Damon's greatest movies, interviews, Jimmy Kimmel live appearances, and that awesome clip from Eurotrip, the Reptilians soon learned their plan backfired. They were more in love with Mr Damon now than ever.  They were angry. And they were not going to let this happen again.\n\nWe killed them all. Every Reptilian. Humanity put into action was they've been practicing on so many species for so long. Complete and total annihilation. Genocide. Chemical, nuclear, quantum weapons, all used, with scary accuracy and even scarier results. \n\nThey thought after that, a message was sent to the universe: Leave us alone; if you value your lives, forget about Matt Damon. To ignore this warning was to invite death upon your entire race.\n\nTwo more times this happened. The Greys were wiped out entirely, being responsible for Matt Damon's third kidnapping. No one had seen one in years. \n\nDuring Matt Damon's fourth rescue, he was injured, leaving a permanent scar resulting in a bald streak on the left side of his skull. The forth species had been stricken from all written language throughout the galaxy. To even whisper their name would send shudders down the bravest alien warrior. Their retribution was swift, with no mercy, and without peer.\n\nSurely, no one would be foolish enough to do this again?\n\nWe were wrong. The highest echelons of the UN had gathered and determined there is only one way to get the Martian back and send a final warning shot to the galaxy that could not be ignored: send in one man. Our second favorite planetary treasure:  Liam Neeson. God help any intergalactic species that gets in his way.",

            "comment": "It had been 10 years since Xanthem, Emperor of Zaraxia, had finished his 4,000 year tour across the universe, taking souvenirs from each planet he pillaged in honor of his coronation. Among his spoils, in a stasis crate easily missed in his vast collection of wealth, was a conversation piece Xanthem took almost as an after-thought. The dominant species on Earth had not yet advanced past their own planet, and thus their resources were useless and primitive compared to the Zaraxians. Xanthem, in his wisdom, decided to let the star system develop for a few more millennia, and return when their was something worth taking. At the insistence of his court however, having come all this way, he chose the nearest human he could find as a souvenir, and promptly left the desolate star system. 10 years later, this off-hand decision came back to haunt Xanthem. \n\n\nFirst, Estria, the Zaraxian's outermost colony went silent. The last messages received detailed the sightings of Carthinian-like ships, the style of a race wiped out by Xanthem's great-grandfather eons ago. Then the same descriptions were received in the last communications from the warships sent to investigate, before they too went silent. Another planet went dark, and another scouting expedition failed to return, until Xanthem himself led the largest fleet assembled to Exon, the next planet predicted to fall silent. For the first time in a hundred thousand years, the Zaraxians feared that there existed a force greater than their own, that the Carthinians had somehow survived, and thrived after the Zaraxian's destruction of their sun had wiped out the Carthinian's capital star system. Xanthem for the first time in his long life, felt fear. The unprecedented golden age of his civilization had been raging for the last 80,000 years, Zaraxia had won control of the known universe, but maintaining a grand army was too expensive. Xanthem's father was the king who drew down the military, seeing no formidable opponents left. Xanthem himself was an explorer, convinced that there were still civilizations out there in the stars undiscovered or underdeveloped, and that was the whole reason he spent so much on his 4,000 year journey in the first place. Yet now, with eons-long peace, he feared that his empire and dynasty would be blown out like a candle light. \n\n\nThe first transmissions came through on an old Carthinian terminal brought out from the archives, but something was off about them. The grammar was incorrect, as though the sender had only recently learned the language. They read \"We come in peace, but war if needed. In search of human Matt Damon\".\n\n\nAdmiral Zhen, of the First Terran Intergalactic Fleet, didn't expect he'd be chosen for the mission. After all, it was alien tech discovered and recreated by the US government, which made up his fleet. Yet in a show of good faith due to escalating trade tensions, the American President nominated a Chinese general to command the first UN fleet of intergalactic warships. Zhen almost felt humiliated when he first received word of his nomination. He had joined the army and quickly moved up the ranks due to his father's connections within the Party, ultimately rising by his own right due to his handling of the Pakistani dispute. Yet now, just months after a supposed alien ship appeared and snatched Matt Damon of all people (an actor who Zhen often confused for Mark Walhberg), he was to lead a hypothetical fleet on a rescue and contact mission? He thought his career would end in a wild goose chase, he didn't believe in aliens, and thought footage from the Damon incident was a hoax. That was, until he saw first-hand the tech the Americans had amassed. Over the next 5 years, the world joined in to help build the expensive fleet, it was political suicide at first for many politicians as their constituents went hungry while several trillion dollars were routed to a fleet that most doubted would even fly. On the day of the launch, 14 ships, with 30,000 crew members aboard each vessel, embarked on a mission no one could have imagined. The President had convinced the world at the UN with his speech, that this mission was not just a rescue mission, but one that would determine the fate of the human race. If there was a civilization out there, capable of visiting our planet and kidnapping one of us, they'd also be capable of enslaving, or murdering us all. \n\n\n3 years into the mission, Zhen's fleet reached the Origin Point, the point from which the crashed alien ship the Americans found decades ago was believed to have originated. But there was nothing there but a dense asteroid field. Expeditions among the rubble found fragments of the same tech from the ship, and within the year Zhen had amassed as much knowledge of the Carthinians as possible. The most recent info had the Carthinians at war with the Zaraxians, but nothing suggested that they had won. The crew onboard the fleet used the new tech found and modified it with their own advancements, boosting speed to numbers once believed impossible. At the year mark, the UN demanded more, and so Zhen ordered his ships to resume their expedition. Rexen, the nearest planet from maps pieced together, was only months away now with the fleet improvements. Upon arrival, Zhen was dismayed to find a once thriving civilization dwindled down to a mere thousand inhabitants. Rexen had been neutral during the wars, but was subjugated by Zaraxia soon after their victory. Their planet was stripped of their resources, and those who didn't die working were the few left once the Zaraxians abandoned the planet. Without resources and a stable climate, Rexen would not rise again. It took linguists months to communicate with them, but their info proved to be invaluable. Every once and awhile, Zaraxia would send ships to ensure that their domain was without sedition, and so even lonely Rexen would recieve a visit. The visiting Zaraxians would give them goods, news, and entertainment, more because they pitied them than anything else. Thus the remaining inhabitants of Rexen were more than thrilled to assist their new visitors. \n\n\nWhen Zhen reached Estria, he sent out a message, and instead was met with a blast that destroyed an entire ship, the Excelsior. Seeing no other option, he ordered nukes launched, and the scout ships which arrived en route to the next planet were met with extreme prejudice. When Zhen's fleet reached the next planet, the nukes were preemptively used as EMPs. Battalions went down and recovered as much intel as they could among the masses of Zaraxians clamoring for basic services. If this was Earth, Zhen and his crew would have been tried for war crimes, but losing another ship was not an option. The scout ship after was quickly dispatched with newly acquired Zaraxian tech, and the location of Matt Damon among Xanthem's spoils was found. \n\n\nZhen knew silencing two planets and two scout expeditions would raise alarms at the highest levels of the Zaraxian government, and so he planned for all-out war when they would reach Exon. It was now or never, Earth had exhausted it's resources to build these ships, and would not be able to defend itself should the fleet perish. Zhen sent an expedition in advance to retrieve Damon, knowing that all forces would converge upon Exon rather than guard a spoiled Emporer's riches. Once Damon was secured, the party would wreak havoc on Zaraxia.\n\n\nXanthem gazed at the small ships, appearing to be escape pods, through his telescope. A diplomatic party perhaps? The \"Carthinian\" pods communicated as such. He ordered his forces to stand down, not realizing that the escape pods, manned by survivors of the Excelsior, were suicide bombers. In a flash they broke formation and detonated, the Zaraxian armada was wiped out in an instant.\n\nOn Earth, a year later, Matt Damon was successfully reawakened from stasis, having no memory of the last 11 years, unaware of the sacrifice Earth made to find him.

            "comment": "You turn on the television excited, yet confused about why you need to watch another year of the Oscars.  The substandard list of critically acclaimed movies nominated for best picture has you kind of annoyed but what else are you going to do on a Sunday night. You had planned on having a viewing party with friends and food, before you remembered that you had no friends and you have been on a juice cleanse for the past 12 days.  In your caloric deficit zombie like state you plop yourself on to the love seat with your big gulp. You are a hoarder and there are musky odors of something that is very familiar but indiscernible to the nostrils in your apartment.  While you contemplate your lifestyle, you take a hit from a bong that is worth more than your car.  The TV brightens up and you hear \"Welcome to the 2032 Oscars! I am your host Matt Damon!\"  You can't contain yourself. Matt Damon is the single greatest actor of all time. You had no idea that he was going to be the host this year. All of a sudden your apartment doesn't smell so bad.  Your energy is revitalized as you unconsciously are eating a slice of pizza that was tucked in the corner of your love seat cushion with minimal hair.  You now have a friend and that friend is Matt Damon. You feel alive for the first time in years if not decades. Sweat starts to drip from your forehead profusely.  You wonder if the weed you have just smoked has something to do with it or if your drug dealer was selling you left over spice again instead. YOU ARE F!@#$&amp;#37;\\^ JAZZED!  Your pupils dilate as Matt Damon announces *Avengers 8: Spiderman Goes To Rehab* for best picture.  The minutes seem like hours as your anticipation grows exponentially.  You are at one with Matt Damon. He understands you like no other TV host could.\n\nJust as Matt Damon finishes announcing that Macaulay Culkin has won best supporting actor for his role in *Batman 6: Batman's Birthday* as the Penguin you begin to well tears of joy for how beautiful a celebration this is whilst being hosted by Matt Damon. Your vision is obscured by the fluids coming out of your eyes, nose, and ears.  There is a bright flash on the screen followed by blood curdling screams. You wipe your face with a loose napkin from a crumpled Burger King food bag only a few inches away to see what is going on.  Thats when you realize.  Matt Damon is gone. The suit that he was wearing was still suspended in air as if it was still held up by Matt's glorious bod.  The microphone was making a static sound but was still hanging in the air completely still.  To your horror, you see the camera panning around looking for Matt for a brief few seconds then the station cuts off air. You vigorously search the internet to see what is happening with the situation.  Nothing of substance.  Then you hit the goldmine. Sub r/UFOs appears to have footage of a UFO hovering over the event center from a basic bitch taking a boomerang picture of herself with the Los Angeles skyline in the background. You notice that apart from the girl shaking her butt on the loop and doing some weird pose that there was a flash of light at the same timestamp that your precious Matt disappeared.  You investigate further while trying to keep yourself composed.  You are utterly ripped apart on the inside, but you cannot show your emotions since you need to stay strong for your 13\\-year old pug named Sexy.  He takes a shit on the floor and snorts, while you eat a Fritos corn chip off of your laptop that you found.   You go to your favorite website for news that is always reliable and unbiased, [foxnews.com](https://foxnews.com).  They have been reporting on the magical disappearance of Matt Damon for over an hour now and keep showing the same five second clip on a loop.  You report an anonymous tip about the UFO.  They call it fake news.  You report the same tip again, this time it is accepted and they now have a 6 second loop to show of the UFO flashing its light. Thats when you notice that a naked man can be seen in one of the frames for a split second floating in between the UFO and the event center.  You can recognize that frame anywhere, that is Matt Damon. One step closer to rescuing Matt.  Your heart is pounding you slip on your shoes only to find that Sexy has taken a shit in them. Theres no time to take them off, you must rescue Matt. You fly out of your apartment and race to your car.  The 1994 2\\-door Honda Civic you drive is basically designed for speed and will do nicely for a quick rescue if you can manage to get it started.  You jump into the drivers seat, jam the key into the ignition and crank it. There is a loud gunshot like sound. Misfire. You crank it again and the car barely turns over.  A smile fills your face and is soon ruined by the smell of Sexy's poop in your shoes.  \"Im on my way, Matt!\" you scream.\n\nIt has now been two hours since the abduction and you turn on your radio.  Now its time for a tough decision, Fleetwood Mac or news about the incident?  You regrettably choose news about the incident.  \"They have I.D.ed the vessel that has abducted precious Matt Damon\" the radio exclaims.  \"It has moved about 20 Km west over the Pacific Ocean, atop of the Catalina Islands.\" As you drive from the Inland Empire you notice rioters and burning buildings. \"A meeting of the world leaders is set via Skype tonight to address the safe return of Mr. Damon, Americas National Treasure\" the radio tells you.  You are livid it has been approximately 5 hours and Matt Damon is still missing, scared, alone, and helpless. You fire on the turbo, and make good time.  You finally reach LA only to find it burning and looted due to the mass rioting and hysteria of a world without Matt Damon.  You sneak on a military boat at the harbor headed for Catalina. Once you get closer to the island you realize the entire US Pacific fleet has congregated around the island.  They fire upon the massive UFO and you scream for fear that they may injure Matt!  To no avail, the rockets and missiles bounce off like rocks and explode as they hit the island below.  The captain of the military vessel spots you and for some reason thinks your his first mate. He orders you to take a small 5 man crew to shore and try to reason with the UFO that is now hovering only 5 feet above the island.  You go along with it. As you approach the UFO, you can hear Matt Damon laughing hysterically as if he is being tickled to death.  A drip of sweat drops down your back.  You fart a little, not sure if it was clean or if you sharted a little bit.  You assure your crew that it was clean, because thats what leaders do.  When the tough gets going, the going gets tough.  You ask the guys if they want to get beers afterwords and get rejected outright. Its no secret that your crew utterly despises you.  The UFO is ominous indeed.  Upon closer inspection, you realize that it is not shaped like a traditional circular UFO, it is just a giant box.  The UFO has touched down now and is flush with the landscape. There is no clear entry into the box. It appears to be made of organic material much like wood.  Matt Damons laughs become louder and more outrageous. You and your crew scream out to let him no you are there with no response.  The crew needs to be ready for anything, you tell them to keep there eyes open.  They tell you to \"fuck off\". A bit hurt, you lean against the other side of the box trying not to cry.  The rest of the crew is inspecting the box they all press there hands against it and you hear a large crunch. The door to the box has flipped open like a ramp and crushed your entire crew to death.  You are indifferent.  The madness of Matt Damon's laughs is deafening and you inspect the opening of the UFO.  It is damp, dark, and moist inside. You creep inside slowly still weirded out by the laughs. The door snaps back up behind you and neon blue lights flicker on.  Matt is sitting in a chair, straight faced. No expression at all, staring at you intently. \"Hi Matttt, I'm a uh big uh fan\" you stutter. The room is completely empty no controls just four empty white walls.  His expression changes from nothing to smiling. \"What are you doing in my palace?!\" he shrieks. He is twitching a bit now as if he has a slight case of Turrets.  \"Just came to uh rescue you\" you state unconfidently. His facial expression has changed to anger.  \"Does it look like I need rescuing?!\" Matt screeches. He pulls out a metal stick that seems to be electrified and runs at you laughing crazily.  \"I'm going to eat you!\" he cries.  At this point you realize you probably should have just stayed home.  Did you really stand a chance as cashier to take on aliens that abducted Matt Damon? No, probably not.\n\nYou realize what you must do. The world needs a hero.  You are that hero.  Your chest fills with air you perk up as you feel that you are the only man for the job. Your muscles tighten and jaw clenches. You have to sacrifice yourself for the good of Matt Damon. You sit down and let Matt Damon eat you bite by bite. Matt Damon thereafter gains all your powers and becomes overlord of the earth.  He commands a human sacrifice daily to eat and inherits your pug, Sexy.\n\nFin",

            "comment": "A little late to the party, but oh well. First writing prompt response, be gentle.\n\nIt was a relatively uneventful day; another reconnaissance and recovery team had completed their month-long deployment to the recently discovered inhabited world known to its dominant species as Earth. This dominant species names itself \u201chuman\u201d.\n\nThe objective of these teams is to passively observe and document goings on of a planet, to involve geological surveying and examination of any and all species, especially those with some semblance of technological advancement. The initial inspection involves one large team to establish a plan, with follow on missions usually consisting of multiple smaller teams focusing on single areas. Teams are encouraged to take samples of a given planet\u2019s physical makeup, and capture samples or specimens of the flora and fauna when able to do so discreetly.  \n\nUsually these surveys only take a few orbits, depending on the planet\u2019s position in its system, but Earth was a little different. Our initial pass of the planet took place in the Human calender year of 1939 and is ongoing as of their year 2020. It was almost immediately noted how delicate peace tended to be among different conglomerations of Humans, and so our survey plan opted for a longer than normal mission to study these apparently bloodthirsty creatures. Some of our more morbidly-humored officers say that we\u2019re just waiting to see how long it takes for the Humans to wipe themselves out.\n\nAs time went on, it became more difficult to collect samples from the planet surface as their almost constant state of war encouraged them to discover newer and greater ways of detecting and countering whatever they deemed \u201dhostile\u201d. \n\nThis most recent team had brought back a generous sample of composition H2O, or \u201cwater\u201d as the dominant Earth species calls it. While low hanging fruit in terms of rarity on the planet\u2019s surface, the wide variety of uses it has makes it an excellent study subject nonetheless. A team from a few years ago had actually managed to capture a Human; male in sex, and around the middleground of a typical Human lifespan. With what we\u2019ve translated of the multiple Human languages, we determined his name to be Matthew Paige Damon, native resident to the Earth region known to themselves as The United States of America.\n\nContainment procedures vary from species to species; the humans captured in the past had exhibited reactions of extreme fear and paranoia, with an occasional tendency of violence towards their captors. They also have a potential to be quite crafty, and occasionally escaped in the early phases of the Earth survey. As such, containment was generally isolated with limitations on items usable as weapons or tools.\n\nVery rarely had humans been cooperative. The specimens recovered were usually from outskirt regions of human civilization, and were a little less educated than some of their counterparts. Those that had an average or above-average education level were occasionally more calm and willing to be a study subject, and were treated as such instead of being more like a prisoner.\n\nThis Matthew human was an interesting catch, however. He was calm from the moment he awoke from stasis, and never resisted or protested anything we did. We would attempt to communicate with captives whenever possible using translator systems, and Matthew would be generally cooperative in answering questions and in regular conversation. One thing that our science officers would repeatedly note was that on occasion, or perhaps if he didn\u2019t like a question, all he would say was \u201cthey\u2019re on their way\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll be free soon\u201d and other similar statements. While a little unnerving, we thought little of it. That was, until the debriefing of the recently returned survey team.\n\nThey were one of two teams orbiting Earth at the time. They were designated Watcher-4 and the other team was Watcher-7. With Watcher-4\u2019s cargo hold full of \u201cwater\u201d and with only a couple of Earth days remaining until replacements arrived, 4 and 7 agreed 4 could begin the return trip a little early. However, a few hours prior to jumping, 4 lost contact with 7. They opted to drop a communication buoy with a message for the replacement, to alert them to the situation, and continue with the jump home. Without FTL travel, it takes about two Earth weeks for our ships to travel from our homeworld to Earth, with our beamed communication taking a little less time. We beamed a message towards Earth in the hopes that 7 would respond, or that the replacement teams would have an update.\n\nAfter a month of comm silence, we decided to send an additional three ships together, expecting them to discover the cause of our missing teams. It was when we received no communication from them that we decided the best course of action was to request military escort from our government; perhaps pirates or another hostile space-faring species was in the area preying on our unarmed science ships.\n\nGovernmental bureaucracy being what it is, it took longer than we would have liked to get the request approved, and longer still for the ships to be ready to go. It was in that time that the unthinkable happened.\n\nSeemingly from nowhere, our planetary sensors detected a vast fleet of unidentified ships, refusing all communication requests. Not long after, we picked up electronic interference and digital intrusions; our systems were being hacked and sensors were being jammed. While this attack took us by surprise, we were able to begin countering it fairly rapidly. Interestingly, they appeared to be searching for something in our data banks and eventually they found it; the location of Matthew Damon. Almost at once, all manner of weapon systems sprang to life on the mysterious ships, scorching or detonating civilian and military targets alike. It was all fair game, save for where Matthew was being held. The containment compound remained untouched during the initial bombardment, and eventually our military got into gear and began a defensive and counter attack.\n\nIn the midst of the battle, smaller ships came from the hostile fleet and began approaching the containment compound, some striking targets near or on the compound and some landing nearby, releasing what seemed like hundreds of\u2026 humans! Human infantry, suicidally flooding towards the compound. Several units of our own ground forces had arrived minutes before, and a large engagement ensued. Larger human landing vessels arrived, some being shot down before landing, and deployed armored units. Eventually human units reached and breached into the compound, and bloody hall-to-hall fighting took place throughout it. After what must have seemed like hours to those fighting, they reached Matthew\u2019s cell. He was rapidly extricated, and almost immediately the humans began a withdrawal. Once their remaining ground units were spaceborne, their battleships intensified their bombardment, and their fleet began to jump out.\n\nDuring the fight, our own defensive fleet moved to engage theirs in a space-scale slugging match. Overall, both sides sustained heavy losses; the Humans had lost a good half of their fleet, while we lost far too much in terms of civilian life and industrial capacity on the surface, not to mention quite a few of our own ships. In the end, however, the Humans appeared to have achieved their goal: the rescue of Matthew Paige Damon.\n\nEven after months of pouring over the data we had collected, both during the surveys and the fighting, neither our best scientists nor philosophers could understand why the Humans wasted so much on a single one of their species.\n\nOne thing we are sure of, though, was that we would never return to Earth.",

Satellites oriented themselves, computer data banks across the globe connected, and a variety of experimental and top secret space craft were deployed. Everything was on the screens. Everything came together in perfect synchronization. NASA employees took to their terminals, bringing various systems online, while hundreds of people organized themselves on a dozen different radio channels. \n\nTo their left, faces appeared on a monitor, the presidents of China, France, and Russia blinked into view, along with the prime ministers of Israel, England, and half a dozen other countries. Black folders opened on the desk revealed a cover form with the words \u201cOperation Dogma\u201d on the front, and a few visible pages listed names, orders, and contingencies of everyone involved. \n\n\u201cWe knew this was an eventuality, gentlemen. Humanity\u2019s greatest weapon has been discovered and captured, and we\u2019re going to get him back,\u201d Director Scott said, \u201cThis is it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs everyone\u2019s team in position?\u201d Director Bolden asked to the heads of their respective states. He was given an affirmative from everyone. \n\n\u201cBring them Commanders up on the screen.\u201d\n\nImmediately the view changed and men in space suits appeared, half of them already buckling their harness in. Voices sounded off as the pilots and copilots checked in. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Commander Affleck?\u201d Bolden asked. \n\n\u201cSorry sir, Commander Affleck standing by. I had to switch out my Batsuit for the Space Suit,\u201d Ben explained, ruffling his already messy hair with a gloved hand. \n\n\u201cDo we have Houston?\u201d Scott asked. \n\n\u201cYes sir, Buzz Aldrin here. Houston is good to go.\u201d The aging voice of the moonwalker acknowledge\n\n\u201cThen we are go, I repeat. We are go. The alien space craft is being tracked and is currently turning away from the planet. Looks like they\u2019re moving to retreat. We have to get our ships off the ground now.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommence coundowns!\u201d Scott instructed. \n\nAll across the planet, advanced space craft moved into positions. It was a well choreographed waltz with everyone in time, dancing with the confidence of people who had been practicing for decades. Twenty two years they\u2019d known and been preparing, and now it came down to this. Citizens the world over marveled as sixty launches occurred simultaneously, sending the interplanetary vessels soaring in the great abyss on the coat tails of the alien craft. \n\n\u201cMatt... we\u2019re coming for you.\u201d Ben whispered, his voice heard across all channels. \n\nUp they rose, sleek, silvery gray ships. Fast, agile and powerful. They moved with a purpose, and within an hour they were passing the moon - a feat never before seen. \n\nThe alien craft, a disc shaped vessel, barely visible against the black, burned its thrusters. But their speed was not hastened by a sense of victory, but a sense of dread. Humanity was gaining faster than they anticipated. \n\n\u201cBoarding patties ready! Marines ready!?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoorah!\u201d They shouted in response. \n\nThe ships sped up next to the fleeing alien ship and moved into formation. Grappling hooks fired from the ships latching on to the flying saucer, and reeled the Human ships in close. Then docking clamps followed the cables down, and latched tight, before the marines placed charges and blasted their way through the inky black hull. \n\nAt the head of the charge, Ben Affleck and his marines boarded the alien vessel, weapons raised and while their armaments were not as fast as their ships, they moved without fear. Death came to all who stepped in front of the assault teams, and when they found him they showed no mercy. \n\nThe two directors listened impatiently, on edge, tense, as Commander Affleck entered the ships control room. They found Matt surrounded by aliens speaking in their native language, but the tone was not forceful or threatening, but terrified. Without hesitation the strike team took aim and fired, and in moments it was over. The the called for retreat was sounded, before the teams disembarked the alien cruiser. \n\nAs the ships separate, cannons powered on the appeared from their hiding places within the hull of the human crafts. Mighty rail guns took aim at the enemy ship, but before firing Commander Affleck opened up a wide band communication, which they broadcast across the Milky Way. \n\n\u201cLet this be a warning to everyone out there. We are here. Come for him if you dare.\u201d\n\nThen they opened fire, dozens of rail guns sounding off at once. And in a brilliant flash of purple the hull of the ship buckled, then exploded. And the humans turned and returned home, one man heavy... \n\n\u201cGlad to have you back, buddy.\u201d Affleck said to Damon, sitting behind him in the ship. \n\n\u201cThanks man. Now let\u2019s go home.\u201d",

As the Aliens know earth is the most fecund spot in the Milky Way for specimens to fill janitorial roles. \nWhat the aliens on the ship hadn\u2019t expected was when Matt started work on the ship, mopping floors, cleaning space shit,  and other mundane jobs, he was also doing reconnaissance on the ship for the Vladimir Putin ( a Russian oligarch who knew Sputnik was only the beginning of a rich space life he wanted now- before musk)\n\nPutin being an evil genius and all put Matt Damon on all the space-job apps, knowing he\u2019d be \u2018mopped up\u2019 immediately by extra terrestrials. \n\nThe script would then blip to Matt Damon\u2019s grueling training to be able to fit a giant reconnaissance device in his ass hole- the weird  doctor from human centipede was the brains behind that.\n\nSo back on the ship he does all this reconnaissance until a prestigious alien sees the reconnaissance device and is immediately alarmed by its un-earthliness. He follows Damon closely who grows increasingly paranoid at Putins constant need to command him to do things. The alien professor approaches Damon and they actually find they have a lot in common. Damon double crosses Putin. Putin finds out and detonates the reconnaissance device which doubled as an IBM. But the device didn\u2019t kill everyone because Damon managed to put his great talent to use and shoved it right back up his ass.\n\nNow the aliens are stranded in the Outback- Australia and they have vowed revenge on the Russian menace Putin.

            "comment": "He wasn't quite sure how much time had passed when he awoke. His head pounding, a sharp pain stung his jaw. He looked out and across the room, his cheek and head still resting on the cold hallway floor. As he went to get up, he heard a sticky sound as the drying blood peeled away from the linoleum. One of his eyes was caked in blood. They had worked him over good. But he wasn't concerned about that. He wasn't concerned about the broken hallway table, the glass on the floor, the smashed heirlooms. He steadied himself on the wall as he limped out into the open space of the dining and kitchen area. He knew when he called out. He knew he was alone. He reached for his cell phone. Even with his face mangled and his eyes forced closed from the swelling, he could dial the number by heart. It only rang a second when he heard the voice. \"Hello?\"\n\"Is he there?\" he asked the person. \"He was\" said the voice. He pressed the end call button and dropped the phone. They took him. They took the only thing left that made this life worth living. The only thing left that she had given him. He turned now towards the stairs. His eyes had adjusted and the life had gone from them. All that was left was darkness, purpose and fury. He opened the door to the basement and slowly walked down the cold steps until he felt concrete. As he rounded the corner of the stairs, his hand moved in automation, becoming one with the object that leaned just to the left of the railing. He didn't even bother with the light. He knew exactly where to place his blow. His ears rung with the first blow, the smell of cement being pulverized filled the air. Harder he swung, never missing his mark. He pulled back the fragments of the floor and slowly lifted the case living in the hole. As he lifted the lid, a small rush of air hurried to fill the once sealed trunk. Then it hit him. The smell of oil and those little silica packets meant to remove moisture. His suit was just as he left it. He lifted it, inspected it, admired it and welcomed it like an old friend had just come home. He looked at his options. The Glock 19 series 5 with the molded grip and laser cut titanium slide, creakoted in  burnt graphite with it's vented slide, the matching Mark VIIs with custom Yankee Hill Suppressors. He'd take them all. But he saved the best for last, his custom Wilson Combat Beretta 92 with titanium SGS compensator. The free floating slide made it the most dependable firearm ever and when he ran out of bullets, it was a solid piece of steel that he could bludgeon with. He stood up, ready to leave when he saw it. The picture was almost too painful to look at, but he did. It was the last time they had been together. Then he flipped it over, the description written in blue ink said \"1997 Continental Premiere - G.W.Hunting\" His eyes paused as he read the next line \"Thanks for all the support John, your friendship means everything - Matt\"\nHe stood up, slowly ascended the stairs and went into the garage. His Mach 1 roared to life in the cool air, the engine devouring and compressing the cold into raw fury under the hood. His hand slammed down on the Hurst Shifter and the hunt had begun. As he passed the guard gate of his gated community, the doorman looked at him and said \"Happy Hunting....Mr Wick\"",

Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots was already there. \"I am Gronk.\" The lumbering giant exclaimed when Ben arrived. \"Oh, hi Mahk.\" Ben said incredulously upon his arrival. Mark Wahlburg stood up and said \"The chouncil of bhoston has been challed to ahction. Our most beloved soldier has been kidnhapped.\" \"I AM GRONK!\" The fully uniformed patriot yelled with tears in his eyes. Ben was too stunned to move a muscle. \"The ahlien ohverlhords ahre here.\" Mark continued, pointing to a crude map with a circle and an arrow pointing to it labeled 'Here'.

WHAT MAKES THIS ONE SO VALUABLE YOU'D GO THROUGH SO MUCH?\" His long scaley fingers gestured upwards. Matt Damon is suspended above some elaborate trap from a James Bond movie. \"You don't ghet it.\" The emblazoned Mark said. \"He's Bhoston Strong.\" The alien leader smiled. \"It's you that doesn't understand. We got what we came for. The essence of Boston.\" He held up a strange navy blue vial. \"Yeah,\" Mark said calmly \"but WE HAVE A GRONK.\" The six foot seven inch monster broke down the wall with a mighty \"I AM GRONK!!!!\" He tackles Trunkakzar to the ground. \n\nSeeing his other half in danger Ben went quickly into action. He scaled the now destroyed wall, ascending higher and higher until he gets to Damon. On the floor Gronk and Trunkakzar are locked in brutal fisticuffs while Mark Wahlburg is getting in a quick pump. \"I... I thought I lost\" Ben was interrupted \"No, you can never lose me.\" Damon's smile was warm, like a cozy fire on a cold Boston morning. Tears rushed to both their eyes as they embraced. But yknow in a manly way. Gronk ripped the alien in half and everyone lived happily ever after. Go Pats.\n\n\n(Did I do it right?)",

As he answered the (increasingly smelly) fans' hands, the air itself seemed to give up, becoming stagnant, and oddly silent.\n\n       The silence didn't last for long, however. As Damon was asked for the thirty-seventh time what his next movie was going to be, an alarm blared in the silence. For one moment, the world seemed entrenched in sound and color as the entire hall lit up, flashing with hues no human had ever seen before. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished. And with it? Matt Damon.\n\n         The news traveled fast. Panicked conventiongoers called the police, screaming and sobbing about the sudden disappearance. As soon as the police knew, the CIA knew, listening on their wiretaps all around the country. Within the hour, a nationwide state of emergency had assembled. Before the day was out, the leaders of every world country had assembled in a new Congress. \n\n          As those distressed leaders' discussion went underway, the mood of the entire globe became increasingly anxious.

            "comment": "Subject 13 let out a sound that could only be described as a heavy pant. Its motions were labored and slow but determined. Padding through the woods, it leaned against a tree both to try and get its bearings and to take a rest. The moment didn't last long. The crackling of sticks nearby warned him that the human was coming his direction. It continued, swatting at branches and cursing every dried leaf and every tiny twig that bellowed out his location to the hunter.\n\n\"Oh, Alien!\" yelled the man. \"Alieeeeen,\" he continued, drawing out the word in a playful taunt.\n\nSubject 13 tried to keep going but found his legs unable to keep pace with the pounding of its heart. They were fueled by nothing but fear, and while in abundance, it wasn't enough any more. It tumbled. The human appeared above him.\n\n\"Hi, little guy!\" said the man with a chipper disposition. \"You know, I always found it odd that aliens resembled humans. Like...\" his mind trailed off as he focused more on stepping on the alien's wrist to keep it from moving. It writhed in agony and terror, but the man's weight was too much. \"... are we a version of you? Or are you a version of us?\" He stepped on the other wrist, straddling the fallen invader. Looking down with a large smile on his face, he continued, \"I understand it's probably panspermia. What a funny name, right? So I get that we're both probably related, but I always expected real aliens to be more akin to Sagan's version, where they look nothing like humans.\" He squatted down.\n\nSubject 13 wriggled placidly.\n\nThe man pulled out a 6\\-inch hunting blade from its sheath. The random strands of sunlight filtered by the large evergreens glistened off the blade, giving it an air of beauty.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say, but I know your little secret. When you get scared, you let out a little pheromone that signals your buddies. And that's why the government hired me.\" He reached over and grabbed Subject 13's hand and laid the blade against its pinky. It was so sharp that just a touch, and green liquid welled at the contact point. \"Because I'm the master of fear, little guy. Now, I'm gonna tell you a secret: I don't actually give two shits about Matt Damon. No. I mean, he was great in those *Ocean's* movies, and I think his water.org work is fantastic. But that's not why I took this job. No.\" He smiled like a kid who got the Christmas present he always wanted. \"I took it, because I'm going to cut you to pieces. Not for science. Not for Matt Damon. No.\"\n\nWith a quick slice, the pinky fell off. Subject 13 let out a sound the likes of which had never been heard on this earth. The man laughed. \"Just because I want to.\"",

            "comment": "\"Did everyone remember to level up your characters? Level 4 increases the intensity of this experience, so be sure you've given yourself all the skills you can. You'll need them.\" Ytverx grinned wickedly, the light glinting off his crown and nearly blinding the others.\n\nAralynn rolled her eyes as she flicked her finger, her parchment unfurling on the table at her gesture. \"At least you lit enough torches this time. I would have been able to change that tire if it were light enough for me to read the correct modifier.\"\n\n\"Still bitter about needing me to push your car home, eh?!\" Hector plopped himself into his chair, making the wood groan under his mass. He pulled a leather purse from his pocket and dropped it unceremoniously on the table, where it spilled bone dice onto the elegantly carved oak. Ytverx had commissioned an artisan to carve useful markings into it, forming a grid on which was already sketched out a chalk outline of a home. The same home that Aralynn, Hector, and Wyvyl's fantasy counterparts resided in.\n\n*\"I* still think we should have used one of our Three-A rescues to get that car home.\" A thin, high voice called from the chamber entrance.\n\nAralynn looked up with a surprised grin. \"Wyvyl! I thought you would be gone today... were you able to undo the curse?\"\n\nThe necromancer approached, limping. Her hair was matted and her skin deathly pale... to a slightly more extreme degree than usual. \"No, but the healer assured me it won't be passed on unless someone kisses me.\" She threw a disparaging glance at Hector.\n\n\"That was in character!\" He protested, arms crossed. \"And I'm glad we saved our Three-A call... what if the car gets stranded on a freeway? We don't want to have all our toes cut off before then!\"\n\nThe others had given up on convincing the barbarian that the rules did not, in fact, call for removing characters' toes as a means of payment for car services. Homophones were not his strong suit.\n\nYtverx pulled out his hidebound tome of rules and propped it on the table between himself and his players, creating a shield behind which he could make notes and roll dice without the others seeing the results. \"I have something particularly difficult in mind for your next quest, but if you'd like your characters to do anything in particular beforehand, I'll give you, say, half a day in game time for free actions.\"\n\n\"Ooh! I've been waiting for this! Now that my animal husbandry skill is higher, I want to make a video of my dog doing a trick!\" Hector was already rolling the appropriate die. \"Thirteen! Plus three, is...\"\n\n\"Sixteen,\" said Aralynn, unwilling to wait for Hector to perform addition on his own.\n\n\"A fair result,\" said Ytverx. \"You capture a moment on video during which your dog performs a backflip. Would you like to post it to The Internet?\"\n\nHector nodded. \"Of course!\"\n\n\"I'd like to do the same with my cat,\" said Wyvyl.\n\nYtverx gestured toward her pile of dice. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nWyvyl rolled, and her face fell. \"Eight. But I have my animal husbandry proficiency as a veterinarian, so the total is... also sixteen!\" She smiled, pleased to think she should be able to capture a moment similar to Hector's dog flip.\n\n\"You capture a video of your cat rolling onto its back and meowing,\" Ytverx informed her.\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"You chose a cat as your companion animal. They are *much* more difficult to train than dogs,\" he preemptively cut off any protest about the unfairness as he rolled his own dice out of view. \"Now, Hector, your video of your dog proves popular, and earns you... one dollar and fifty three cents in currency.\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" Hector slams his fist on the table in celebration.\n\n\"Wyvyl, your video of your cat proves *more* popular, and earns sixty-two dollars and eleven cents.\"\n\nNow it was Hector's turn to protest, but Ytverx raised his finger for silence. \"Cats are difficult to train, but they provide bonuses on The Internet. This is all in the rules that *everyone* had a chance to read. Does anyone else want to do anything before the quest?\"\n\nAralynn shook her head. \"Let's get on with it.\"\n\nYtverx handed a folded piece of parchment to Wyvyl. \"This arrives for you in the mail.\"\n\nShe took it gingerly, unfolded it, and read, her eyes widening. \"Oh no.\" Looking back and forth between Ytverx and her other players, she swallowed. \"I doubt we're prepared for this. We've been invited...\" She turned it around to show the rest. On the parchment was some text accompanied by a large, colorful rendition of a pine tree dressed in baubles. \"To a Christmas party!\"",

            "comment": "The card hissed softly as it was drawn from a neat stack of similarly blue-backed cards on the large wooden table, its surface battered and worn from hundreds of years of use. Though her figure was mostly hidden by the Head of Neighbourhood triptych sheet, three pairs of eyes rested eagerly on Calen as she turned the card in her hand and lifted it up, smiling wryly at its contents. \n\n\n\u201cCut the theatrics and read, elf,\u201d grumbled Brond, a large and hairy man. His feet rested atop an empty chair, smaller than his own and wobbling as he shifted his weight against its seat. \n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s working late,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\u201cAgain?\u201d He replied, seemingly exhausted by the card\u2019s message. \n\n\nLarge head toppling rearward to rest against the uppermost plank of the chair back, hair spilling over the wood, Brond shut his eyes. Calen\u2019s smirk sustained. Though different in their distinct features, Azezus the Blight and Crog wore matching expressions, lips pulled tight and curved, showing teeth as they grinned with amusement. The game sat on the table, two tidy piles of cards and character sheets scattered. Everything behind Calen\u2019s trifold was a mystery. \n\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d she repeated. \n\n\nBrond ran meaty fingers along his wrinkled forehead, massaging between the furrowed brows as he thought. After a sigh, he said, \u201cThis is the third time this week.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd the young secretary card is in play,\u201d chimed Azezus. \n\n\n\u201cDamn the gods,\u201d Brond cursed. \u201cI go to his work.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat a fool,\u201d said Azezus.\n\nBrond frowned, eyes narrowing in the necromancer\u2019s direction. \u201cExcuse me? At least I *have* a husband.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cMine\u2019s dead--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDoes it make you feel impotent to know you can\u2019t even bring him back?\u201d Crog laughed. \n\n\n\u201cPlease, you can\u2019t fathom the pressure of being a single mother of three little heathens,\u201d Azezus accused. \u201cThey eat so much and the bills are piling up. Do you know how much debt Jason left me with? I thought we were doing well until he died.\u201d His sharp slender finger drifted down his character sheet, head wagging agitatedly from side to side. \n\n\n\u201cIf only you could bring him back and shake his bones for a couple more bucks maybe your kids wouldn\u2019t have to go to community college,\u201d Crog continued to taunt.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in couples counseling, your son is a prescription medication addict,\u201d Brond countered. \n\n\nCalen watched them, peering over the edge of her text-rich sheet. The smile that had formed upon reading the drawn card had yet to diminish and had grown only tighter from fatigue. Their arguing began to overlap. Voices raised until the volume was such that even Calen herself was finding it difficult to decipher the nature of the various delivered insults so, raising a hand in the air and not saying a word, she tossed two dice onto the table. The clatter, though quiet, hushed the playful fighting.\n\n\n\u201cYou go to his work, drowsy from imbibing several glasses of ros\u00e9,\u201d Calen said, \u201cBut he isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d Brond muttered. His fist landed heavily against the table. \u201cI thought better of him.\u201d Fingers clenched and nostrils flared, he grunted, \u201cIt\u2019s snack time, I\u2019m famished. Send me to the bar, I\u2019ll wallow in the realisation that I married a dirty cheater.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou have a teenager and a toddler at home!\u201d Corg interjected. \n\n\n\u201cAnd you have your raging Orc of a mother-in-law, Margaret coming over in the morning but you\u2019ve spent no time straightening your home,\u201d Brond scoffed, \u201cMind your own problems.\u201d \n\n\nSliding his character sheet toward the centre of the table with a resentful sneer, Brond\u2019s large boots thudded against the floor. In a single graceless motion, palms leaning into the table top, he stood up and walked toward the pantry. \n\n------------------------\n\n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/EdgarAllanHobo/comments/7pi55k/suburbs_and_suvs_part_two/) Stay tuned for more. \n",

I just find the mental image of all these supernatural beings sitting around playing 'normal human life' the board game utterly delightful! Its like that episode of Batman TAS where all the villains were playing cards and talking about that one time they almost killed Batman.",

            "comment": "In life, Orglord, had flayed his enemies open and put them on display throughout the villages he had pillaged. Men, women, children. None were given mercy. Barbarians warlords didn\u2019t discriminate. However, in Suburbs and SUVs, he was Orie, the thirty-year old sales representative currently late for work for the third time this week.\n\n\u201cI attempt to switch lanes,\u201d Orglord said, a quiet tremble to his voice. Unlike his barbarian brethren, his rage was not preceded by rampant roars, but by these soft tremors.\n\nArana, the high priestess of the dark elves and one of the few who dared openly talk against Orglord raised her brow. \u201cYou know what happened last time you try to change lanes.\u201d\n\nBut she was handedly ignored. An entire crowd sat around them, staring. Elven magic projected this game throughout the entirety of Almiera. Millions of lives were at stake here. A bad month of B2C sales numbers has been known to result in the pillaging of entire regions by Orglord.\n\n\u201cBlasted Subaru Impreza, if I had a mightier car, none would dare stuck me in traffic!\u201d\n\nHe grabbed a die and tossed them onto the table. They clacked against the redwood. Everyone held their breaths. At last, they stopped. A 17.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Orglord shot out of his chair, his fists shaking above his head. \u201cI will have gut all those who stand between me and my employee of the month nomination!\u201d\n\nThe game master, a necromancer hidden by his own conjured shadows, coughed. \u201cIs that your move?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d The barbarian warlord lowered himself back into his chair. \u201cI switch lanes to the right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou signal the switch and merge lanes,\u201d the necromancer said.\n\nOrglord clasped his hands upon his mouth.\n\n\u201cYou successfully merge lanes.\u201d\n\nThe barbarian and those spectating from his region let out a relieved breath, but the necromancer held up his hand. It was like a spell of silencing. The crowd, the players, the world stopped and stared at that hand.\n\n\u201cBut, due to a traffic accident on the right shoulder of the highway that you are only seeing now, you must now merge back. Only a roll of 18 or higher can get you back into the correct lane without further delay.\u201d\n\nOrglord went silent. Those watching from his region began packing their things.\n\nThe rest of the day fared no better for Orie, the thirty-year-old toilet salesman in Suburbs and SUVs. His boss did not promote him, in fact, he got reprimanded for being late again. Employee of the month went to that bitch Carol who always talked about him behind his back at the water coolers. To top it all off, his wife called, saying that they needed to talk of something important.\n\nOn his way back from work, Orglord made no rolls. He did not merge lanes. He did not honk his horn. He sat in idle traffic for fifteen minutes and though the necromancer pressed him for actions, he simply waited through it.\n\nAt last, he arrived home.\n\n\u201cYou step up to the door and open it,\u201d the necromancer said. \u201cThe first thing you see are your wife\u2019s suitcase, already packed. She approaches you.\u201d\n\nOrglord\u2019s jaw clenched and he stared at his hands. \u201cTell her,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I understand. I couldn\u2019t graduate college, I couldn\u2019t give her any of the things I\u2019ve promised her, hell, I couldn\u2019t even make employee of the month. I promised her the world and this is all I amounted to. Tell her that I\u2019m a failure and that this will be last night playing this god damn game!\u201d\n\nThe necromancer let the barbarian\u2019s words echo through the room. All around the world, armies mobilized and castles fortified themselves.\n\n\u201cYour wife brings out another set of suitcases. They are yours.\u201d\n\nOrglord\u2019s eyes snapped up, wide.\n\n\u201cShe tells you that it is your birthday, remember? She says that she never expected you to give her the world, but she never wanted the world anyways. She says that she knows how hard you work and how much you care, even if you refuse to say. She tells you that she loves you and that she\u2019d never leave someone as good as you. That\u2019s why she wants to leave together, on a surprise vacation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlasted!\u201d Orglord slammed his fist into the table and turned away from the game master. \u201cBlasted\u2026 blasted hell!\u201d he screamed and brought his palms to his eyes.\n\nThe players nodded with him. Even the spectators, who a second ago had prepared to move their armies against him, teared up.\n\n\u201cOrglord, I mean Orie,\u201d the necromancer said. \u201cWhat is your response?\u201d\n\nNothing. He kept his back turned as his shoulder shuddered.\n\n\u201cOrglord?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will wear your entrails around my neck!\u201d he roared back. \u201cDo not bother me. Not now. Not yet. This is\u2026\u201d he chocked on the rest of the words and a wail burst through his lips. \u201cThis is\u2026 this\u2026 This is real,\u201d he finally finished.\n\nThe necromancer nodded back and stayed silent.\n\nFor centuries Suburbs and SUVs have kept the world safe and today was no exception. With the greatest of magics available, the most powerful of spells and weaponry at their command, the mightiest of the villains all fell to this simple game. Perhaps it was in how mundane it was, perhaps it was in how powerless it forced them to be, or perhaps that this pretend world had somehow become more real than their reality itself. Whatever the case, the armies around the world put down their swords and shields and sat back down in their chairs to finish watching tonight\u2019s game of Suburbs and SUVs.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for 200+ stories.",

            "comment": "G'ol Bognil let out an expansive sigh as he settled his considerable girth before the marble table. \"Alright, before we get started, remind me your names and classes again?\"\n\nLethus did not move but a phlegmy mutter emanated from under this black hood. \"I am Steve. The dentist.\"\n\nPolara was next to speak. Her glittering obsidian eyes dropped down to the character sheet in front of her. \"I am a dual-class business exec and accountant named Mike the Magnificent.\"\n\nG'ol Bognil blinked. \"That sounds a bit over-powered to me...what is your backstory?\"\n\nA ghost of a smile appeared momentarily on Polara's black lips. \"My father dedicated his life to the Demon of Alcohol and my mother was a pathetic weakling. I worked two jobs to put myself through college and then graduate school, where I studied under the tutelage of some of the mightiest professors in the land.\"\n\nThe bulbous, warty nose of G'ol Bognil wrinkled. \"I feel like your characters always manage to receive the tutelage of some of the mightiest professors in the land. One of these days I am going to make you play a waitress.\"\n\nPolara drew herself upright, the torch light reflecting off the onyx pendant around her neck. \"The earthly vessel of Burkh the Devourer does not play waitresses.\"  \n\nG'ol Bognil rolled his eyes and then let out a loud belch. \"And finally...?\"\n\nThe goblin king turned to look at a veritable mountain of a man whose face was almost completely lost behind wavy crimson hair and a bushy, fiery beard. \"I, Garung the Decimator, Eviscerator of the Plainsmen and Bane of the Thrak, am playing...\" \n\nGarung's brow creased as he squinted at his paper. \"Millie, the Soccer Mom.\"\n\nPolara snorted. There was no way to tell, but something about the dark aura surrounding Lethus suggested he was smirking. G'ol Bognil, however, frowned.\n\n\"What...can Myley do?\"\n\n\"Millie. Her rumor and gossip skills are maxed out, so she is a powerful information broker. After years of training, the High Council of Home Owners has made her queen, meaning she wields the full power of the Covenants of C&amp;R. Her arch-rival is Kaylie, Supreme Leader of the Association Between Parents and Teachers.\"\n\nG'ol Bognil sighed. \"Try to keep it IC, please. In the faraway land of North Suburbtown, they do not have queens or supreme leaders - they have presidents and heads.\"\n\nSomewhere behind his giant beard Garung the Decimator was scowling but he said nothing. \n\nG'ol Bognil opened a flask of Mountain Ale and took a long pull, then belched again. \"Alright. It is Saturday, and you all find yourselves at the Park of Dark Cul-de-Sac. Mike, you are here for a company picnic/fundraiser. Steve, you are watching your son play in the Tournament of Soccer, where he and his companions are trying to best the All-Stars of Cityhome. And...Millie --\"\n\nPolara made an amused noise that she tried to cover by sniffing loudly. \n\n\"-- you, of course, are coaching a different team nearby. The sky is gray - strangely overcast for a day in April. The green lawns squish slightly under the feet of the Tournamenteers, and various obese humans sit in flimsy makeshift thrones to watch. The sounds of dogs barking ring out from the housing development, swelling ever louder...as you turn in the direction of the noise, you see a gazebo looming in the distance...\"\n\n* * *\n\n/r/ShadowsofClouds",

            "comment": "The War Council\u2019s table was large enough to comfortably seat ten, which meant that the four of them had ample space between them. They waited patiently for Vorporl to usher the last of the attendants out, unfurl the banners outside which read \u201cWar Council In Session\u201d, then shutter the heavy wooden doors.\n\n\u201cAre you sure\u2026 they can\u2019t hear us from outside?\u201d asked Groggzor, with his grip still firmly around his war-axe.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of genie do you take me for?\u201d Vorporl said, as he swirled in a purple cloud back to the head of the table. \u201cThis be the third such session, Warchief, and no spy has yet uncovered what it is we do here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had better not,\u201d said Curllex, as she drummed her long, deformed digits on the table. \u201cI come here at great risk, and my people still think I am here to fan the flames of war. Even the lowest goblin will rise up against me if they knew the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot just you, not just you,\u201d said Nymae, her voice hushed by the dark cowl which perpetually shrouded her features. \u201cI hold much sway yet over the night elves, but \u2018tis would beggar belief. I risk just as much as anyone here.\u201d\n\nNefatim, surly as always, merely nodded, concentrating as he did on animating the rat skeleton before him.\n\n\u201cTime slips by so fleetingly,\u201d said Vorporl, as he clapped his hands. \u201cWelcome back, my friends, to yet another heart-stilling, pulse-stopping, mind-numbing session of the greatest decadence. It is, once again, the moment for you to cast your minds back to that rift we tore, those glimpses of a world we saw\u2026 and play *Serene Suburbia*, a campaign like no other, set in the mystical world of *Suburbs and SUVs*\u2026\u201d\n\nVorporl concentrated, and turned purple briefly as the magic spilled out of him, washing over the table, his guests, the chamber, spinning an illusion so complete that even Nymae had difficulty piercing through the veil.\n\n\u201cCharacter sheets?\u201d\n\nThe four of them nodded conspiratorially as they thumped the sheafs of parchments before them. There was a fifth amongst them once, long ago, but Vorporl had not taken kindly to the kobold knight\u2019s habit of being forgetful. Vorporl was an Ancient Antiquity, with vast reserves of magic at his command, and it had not taken much to reduce the offender to dust.\n\nNo one ever forgot their character sheets after. Everyone even volunteered to bring extra dice.\n\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d said Vorporl, \u201cit is always heartening to see that you care. And where we last left off, was Groggzor returning from a long and draining day from work. It is dinnertime, and will you, or will you not, end the evening in peace? Or will this road lead you down to one of carnage and bloodshed? We shall find out, as Groggzor opens the door, and walks in with his head down\u2026\u201d\n\nCruallax emptied a bag on the table, and various odds and ends tumbled out. She almost screeched in glee. \u201cOoh, ooh, I\u2019ve got an Apron of Sensitivity + 1! I see Groggzor coming in, so I roll for a Perception check!\u201d\n\nShe handed over the token of her hard-fought enchanted armor, and Vorporl ran a quick check to confirm it was not counterfeit. He nodded, then the dice rolled.\n\n\u201cAh, and so it is that you sense that Groggzor is troubled! What do you say next, Cruallax?\u201d\n\n\u201c*Nothing!*\u201d said Cruallax. \u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson! I will retrieve a frigid Ale from the icechest instead, hand it over to Groggzor, then leave him be while I continue preparing dinner!\u201d\n\nVorporl fought to stifle his smile. Goblins were naturally disadvantaged in many ways, and had only kept their seat on the War Council by being twice as brutal as the next species. Cruallax may have been Queen for over a decade, but her rule would corrode as soon as she ever demonstrated a softer side.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Vorporl, as he consulted his tome. \u201cYour good intentions are at risk, Cruallax! An Event of Politically Incorrect Sexism lurks about the corner! If you fail this roll, Groggzor will reject your kind offer, and castigate your action as a manifestation of female oppression!\u201d\n\n\u201cNoooo,\u201d Groggzor bleated, as his face fell. \u201cGroggzor want drink frigid Ale! Be nice to Groggzor too!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot up to you, old boy. Go on, Cruallax, make the roll!\u201d\n\nTwo dice came up low, and the last spun on its axis as they all held their breath. Vorporl ran a tough campaign, and he never pulled his punches. One single mistake could easily multiply, and they would be swimming in blood before they knew it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 made it!\u201d said Vorporl. \u201cGroggzor accepts your entreaty! He is pleased!\u201d\n\n\u201cGroggzor thankful,\u201d he said, the grin spreading across his cheeks. \u201cGroggzor like Ale given without hate. Groggzor also like when no keep ask Groggzor to kill for clan, and give Groggzor some time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGroggzor is appeased,\u201d said Vorporl. \u201cHe kicks his feet up, reads the evening paper, and the warm aroma wafting out of the kitchen only serves to wash away his fatigue and remind him of the precious family he has. Then, the pitter patter of feet, and his children tumble down the stairs. They embrace him, then sit before him, asking him to tell them about his day. Nymae, Nefatim, what say you?\u201d\n\nThe two looked at each other, then nodded. Nymae, used to taking the lead, spoke for the two of them.\n\n\u201cWe are both Not Irritating and Quite Understanding,\u201d she said, as she picked from the tokens before them, holding up their treasured spoils from past campaigns. \u201cMy brother and I acquired these Qualities from vanquished foes, and we employ them now. We are grateful for anything our father says, and instead we start heading off to help set the dinner tab-\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. No do,\u201d said Groggzor, as he slammed his fist down on the table. \u201cNo do. Me roll. Me roll, me want to tell story.\u201d\n\nSilence, as Vorporl calculated the odds, and the other players swallowed carefully.\n\n\u201cMe want tell story. Me roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cErm, Groggzor, hey,\u201d said Nymae. \u201cLook, how about you let us pass this Event, then after, when Vorporl\u2019s gone, how about we listen to your story then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no do,\u201d said Groggzor, as his veins popped out. He was obviously struggling for control, and he kept his voice low, lest a battlecry seep out uncontrollably. \u201cMe do story. No one care for Groggzor story, and me want tell.\u201d\n\nVorporl sighed, then handed the dice over. It was understandable, in a way. Barbarians were hardly known for their eloquence, and as fate would have it, the one person in their entire fiefdom who should be so smitten by the Bard\u2019s Curse would be their leader, the one person who should have washed himself of every undesirable trait and quality.\n\n\u201cBe my guest. But remember, fail the check, and your children will get bored with your story. They will not pass their Rebellion check, and angered, you will strike them down, sever their limbs from their body\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMe roll.\u201d\n\nThey only realized they were holding their breaths after the last die came to a complete stop.\n\n\u201c\u2026 you passed,\u201d said Vorporl, half in amazement. \u201cWith a Charisma count of negative one, you actually passed.\u201d\n\nGroggzor was all smiles as he turned to his \u2018children\u2019.\n\n\u201cGroggzor go to building to work. On way, woman fall down, and hurt her knee. Help, she say, my blood leave me! Me scream! She scream! No cleric to cast Cure Light Wound! Me find hunter lurking nearby, me ransack his body to find Salve! Me put on woman, she have new leg, she thank me. Me like, real smart, very stable genius. Story end.\u201d\n\nNefatim\u2019s pet rat, bleached a few shades whiter from the caustic power of the crappy story, scuttled off the table in search of a hiding place.\n\n\u201c\u2026 good job, Groggzor,\u201d said Vorporl. \u201cMoving on, Nymae, Nefatim, it is now your turn. Your father has given both of you a handful of sweets from work. You both know you will soon Squabble over the division of the loot. Now, the Squabble has an encounter rating of 30, which means that even working together, it is likely that you will end up quarrelling-\u201d\n\nA sharp rap on the doors, and the party fell silent.\n\n\u201cVorporl! I bring grave tidings! The dragons to the south, they are marauding again! They threaten the very existence of the five Kingdoms! Please, open the door, convene a full War Council! We must fight for our survival!\u201d\n\nAll four of them sighed as they divided up their tokens, received the Experience and Life Skills stubs Vorporl was handing out, then secreted their character sheets away. A glumness had descended upon them, like a carnivorous slime.\n\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Vorporl. \u201cWe meet again fourteen moons from today, after the dragons are vanquished. Maybe then, we will have a bit more time to enjoy a bit more *Serenity*. Until then\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 just more bloodshed,\u201d said Nefatim, the only words he spoke that day.\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny \n",

            "comment": "Cutulah was first to arrive, as usual. The cellar was empty, but she busied herself by lighting candles, setting up the board and then finally, pouring herself a drink from the huge oak barrel. \n\nShe glanced at her palm, as if the lines that trailed it told her secrets they shared with no one else. Then she looked at the door. \n\nStill no one.\n\nWith a sigh, she swivelled off her stool and got down onto her knees. The corners were usually the best place to find what she was after. Cobwebs worked too, although their contents couldn't be *that* old. If too many legs were missing, it wouldn't be much fun. \n\nIt only took a few minutes to gather, what she considered, a rather good haul. She got back to her feet, her hands cupped and full, and walked over to the board. Dead insects fell like black sleet onto the tiny, idyllic suburb.\n\n\"Ten gold pieces on the beetles!\" shouted Burric, clapping his hands as he walked in. Cutulah looked up at the barbarian. He was wearing fur around his groin, a sword around his back, but little else. *Wasn't he cold?* Cutulah didn't mind too much. His tanned, chiselled features made her for a second, ashamed; she ran a finger down a thin, pale cheek.\n\nJateex the Goblin King trotted in next, his skull boots clicking and clacking on the stone floor. \"Oh, a little pre-game fun? Excellent. Excellent. Fifty on the spiders!\" he said, settling down onto a stool, his beady eyes following the frantic back and forth battle.\n\n\"Come on, dung beetle! Snap their legs!\" yelled Burric. \"Aye, that's the way! Chase 'em, chase 'em! *No*, not into the web! Ach, idiot.\"\n\nA cold wind spiralled around the cellar, announcing the final arrival. The long legged Dark Elf glided through the doorway and over to the table. She tutted when she saw the scene, then waved a hand over the battling insects. They fell into a dead slumber.\n\n\"What did ya do that for, woman!?\" roared Burric, slamming his fist on the table. The insects jumped a final time, as if performing a sordid curtain call.\n\nLlenynea rolled her eyes. \"Please. I'm not here for *battling bugs.* Reanimation is the lowest form of entertainment.\" There was a palpable disdain in her voice. Cutulah's lips twitched but she said nothing. Instead, she left her seat again, and poured three drinks. One for the Barbarian, one for the Goblin King, and a refill for herself.\n\nLlenynea placed a bag on the table, a bag as black as the sky outside the castle.  She clicked it open and removed a sleek, long necked jar that shone far brighter than the candles.\n\n\"Is that...\" began Jateex, his mouth dribbling.\n\n\"Nectar, yes. With a little something extra. I would offer it around, but it would probably kill any of you, my friends.\" \n\nIt was Cutulah's turn to roll her eyes, but in truth, a pang of jealousy in her stomach was letting itself be known. She'd never tasted nectar before -- not even the bastardised diluted stuff -- and probably never would.\n\n\"Shall we begin?\" said Burric, clapping his hands together excitedly. \"I feel like a dwarf whose been away away from his axe for a month. A wizard away from his weed pipe. Let's get going!\"\n\nThere was a murmur of excited agreement.\n\nCutulah held out four cards face down. She offered them first to Jateex. His hand darted for one of the middle two cards, but then he stopped suddenly before taking, looked up slyly at Cutulah, and changed to the card on the left.\n\n\"Suburbs!\" he shouted joyfully. \"You thought Jateex, dumb! Jateex *not* dumb!\"\n\nCutulah moved her hands over to Burric.\n\n\"Ah, SUV's,\" he said, clicking his tongue in annoyance. Cutulah let out a sigh of relief. No matter what happened, she wouldn't have to team with the stuck up Elf again. Things had ended rather *dangerously* the last time they had tried working together...\n\nFinally, she offered the remaining two cards to Llenynea. The Dark Elf waved her hands over the cards, slowly moving her palms back and forth from one to the other.\n\n\"Wait!\" yelled Burric. \"Anyone else feel that breeze? A breeze like\"--he turned and glared suspiciously at the elf--\"*like darkness and ice*.\"\n\n\"A natural subterranean wind, I imagine,\" said Llenynea. \"Cellars do get draughty, after all.\"\n\n\"Neh! Jateex felt it too,\" said the Goblin King. \"*Unnatural.* Elf already try to cheat!\"\n\n\"Preposterous!\"\n\nCutulah frowned, then shuffled the two cards. \"Take your pick,\" she said. \"*Quickly.*\n\nLlenynea growled and snatched the left card. She placed the SUV card face up on the table.\n\n\"Right,\" said Burric. \"Let's begin.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

Its drawer's hand shaking due to nerves at what the faiths might have in store for him. One eye closed, and one eyes opening, Slug looked at the card he had drawn. His face suddenly erupted with joy, as he threw the card before the other players in pride. Written in cursive were the words \"Extra Alimony this month\".\n\n\"It appears my no good ex-husband owes me extra alimony this month!\" Slug announced,as his character Candice \"the stay at home mom and PTA member\" received a bonus to her luck stat. A large sigh of disapproval escaped the other players mouths. \n\n\"Oh great...the harlot gets more luck. Was taking your offspring away from him not enough?\"Hella, the Grand Priestess of Gaia, asked as she surveyed the room around her. She was playing the character of Amanda \"Over achiever and President of the Student body\". \n\n\"In all that is fair...Candice did have a pretty great lawyer.\" Moluk stated, smirking to herself as she rested face lay in the palm of her hand, elevated by her elbow. The necromancer was referring to herself of course, whose character was Norman \"The dirtiest lawyer in the state\". \n\n\"Your tongue may be silver, necromancer. But my baking skills have kept my husband,our adopted son, and I in high standing among the christian community. All this, because of my Brownies.\" Gri-dor announced, a hearty laugh escaping his heavily bearded mouth. He played Alex \"A loving husband, father, and baker\". \n\n\"NOTHING CAN STOP THE MIGHTY ALEX!\" Gridor announced, as he stood up to draw the next card. Suddenly, his face grew dark and he slumped down in his seat. His eyes wide with horror, as he looked over the faces of his fellow players. \n\n\"What does it say, mighty Alex?\" Slug asked, raising one end of his thick unibrow at the warlord. \n\n\"I...found a lump...\" Gri-dor stated, as the other players looked around at each other. It was true, written on the card was the words \"you found a lump\". \n\n\"And just after you used your health insurance card to bring your 5 year old to the hospital for his appendix.\" Moluk mocked taking enjoyment in this, as Gri-dor smashed his goblet of mead in his large hand out of frustration.  \n\n\"I CANNOT DIE! What of my family? My bakery?\" Gri-dor began to panic, as he looked over his character sheet. \n\n\"Roll to check its severity!\" Hella stated, as Gri-dor threw the dice across the table. Hoping it would land on a low number. \n\n\"7.So its treatable, but your relationship with your husband becomes strained as a result and you miss a turn to go to therapy.\" Hella explained, to a much relieved Gri-dor. \n\n\"But, David stays with me right?\" Gri-dor asked, rolling the dice again. Slug let out a laugh at the result. \n\n\"Oh how I love this game!\" Moluk announced, clapping in joy. ",

            "comment": "\"Burgi! So you made it!\" Morlaoth, the necromancer, exclaimed. \"I guess your pillaging went well yesterday?\"\n\nBurgi furrowed his gigantic brow in concentration. \"Pillage... good. Burgi kill... many. Make much gold.\" He breathed a sigh of relief after the last word. His throat was still sore from all that shouting.\n\n\"Good, good,\" Morlaoth agreed. \"Here's your chair. Sorry about the guts, I had no time to clean before you came. Undead uprising, you know.\" Burgi nodded.\n\nThe door gave an ominous creak, and Morlaoth clapped his hands, giddy with excitement, as his undead butler went to welcome his other guests. A hand touched his shoulder.\n\n\"Eek!\" Morlaoth gave a strangled screech as he whirled around. \n\n\"What? Art thou afeared?\" The voice came from nowhere.\n\n\"You - You've done the invisible thing again, Domalia,\" Morlaoth squeaked.\n\nThe air fizzled, and Domalia appeared. \"Thy guards like me not, Morlaoth. 'Tis a matter of my safety.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, of course.\" Morlaoth muttered nervously. \"Ah... your seat.\" He gestured to an empty seat, and the beautiful sorceress lowered herself into it.\n\nA tiny goblin hobbled into the room. \"Ciank!\" Morlaoth exclaimed, \"You made it!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. No thanks to that one, of course,\" the goblin said, inclining his head towards Burgi. \"His warriors have been on my lands for a week now.\" He shook his head. \"But no matter.\"\n\nAs Morlaoth and the goblin king made themselves comfortable, Domalia started setting up her folder.\n\n\"Oh, Domalia, you can't be the Suburb Master!\" Morlaoth cried in dismay. \"Who will be the mom?\"\n\n\"Thou shalt be the mom if thou so chooseth,\" Domalia muttered. \"If thou art not too... scared.\"\n\n\"I already made my character sheet, Domalia,\" Morlaoth whined. \"It took me ages, and my blood-ink was drying out.\"\n\nDomalia glowered at him, her red eyes really giving it the right effect. \"Now shalt be the reading of the character sheets. Burgi, thou shalt go first.\"\n\n\"Name - Burger. Race - Football. Class - No.\" Burgi read with difficulty.\n\n\"Burger? That's practically the same as your name!\" Morlaoth exclaimed. He started to say more, but found his mouth clamped shut by magical forces.\n\nDomalia's voice shook the dust from the rafters far above them. \"It shalt be as he hath chosen!\"\n\n\"His race can't be football, though, can it? And he has to choose a class, surely.\" Ciank argued. Domalia held her head in her hands.\n\n\"Burger do... football race. Burger not... in class, busy football race.\" Burgi explained laboriously.\n\n\"That meaneth Burger's class is athlete,\" Domalia explained gently. \"And race meaneth... what colour person Burger is.\"\n\n\"Burger... person colour!\" Burgi exclaimed. Then, after looking at the glowering soot-coloured elf, the annoyed, milk-white necromancer, and the disinterested green goblin, he amended his statement. \"Uh, red-white, like Burgi.\"\n\nMaking the necessary changes to Burgi's character sheet, Domalia asked, \"Sex?\"\n\nMorlaoth stifled a snicker as Burgi turned bright red. \"Women. Only women.\" Morlaoth started to correct Burgi, but Domalia had already written *female* in the appropriate spot.\n\n\"Okay, all thy stats appear to be in order. Morlaoth, what is thy character?\"\n\n\"Morgan, a male Caucasian necromancer,\" Morlaoth smirked.\n\nDomalia made a face. \"There are no necromancers allowed,\" she hissed, turning her glowering eyes back on.\n\nMorlaoth frowned. \"That's a bit harsh, Domalia. Why not?\"\n\nDomalia shook her head. \"There is no necromancy in the game.\"\n\nMorlaoth was shaken. He shuffled through his papers for a second, finding the sheet of approved classes. His face went even whiter. \"I - I guess a doctor?\" His voice shook as he spoke.\n\n\"And thy stats are acceptable,\" Domalia nodded. \"Ciank?\"\n\n\"Charlie, male African-American toddler,\" the goblin croaked.\n\n\"Thou art aware that toddler is the weakest class?\" Domalia asked, tapping her pen on Morlaoth's stone table.\n\n\"Yes.\" Ciank offered no further explanation.\n\n\"Morlaoth, since thou art the most powerful and oldest of the players, thou shalt be the dad. Burgi, thou art a *teenager* in, uh, *high school.* Thou wilt have to go to class, so thou canst be on the football team. Ciank, thou requireth a *babysitter* or thou mayst go to *preschool.*\"",

Hell, it happened so often she thought about house ruling that it was okay. But she would be damned if she let these players ruin her story.  \n\u201cCan I talk my way out of it?\u201d  \nThe group laughed at the orc.  \n\u201cIt would be like,\u201d the priestess shook her head as if trying to brush away a troublesome blowfly. \u201cIt\u2019s at least a DC of 50 and I know you can\u2019t make that. You need to do something though cause he\u2019s probably going to call the cops on you.\u201d  \n\u201cThose are the guards,\u201d interjected Cleasz helpfully. The goblin nursed a particular fondness of terrorizing the orc warlord.  \n\u201cI can\u2019t threaten this bastard but I sure as hell can threaten you,\u201d the orc said as he reached for his sword. But it wasn\u2019t there. That was another rule the priestess had had to enforce since a few of the early sessions had resulted in some light maiming. Frustrated, the orc turned back to the game. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? I have those damn bills you keep giving me and without this job I can\u2019t send little,\u201d he consulted his character sheet, \u201cBilly junior to private school and my,\u201d another glance at the sheet, \u201cWife will have my head.\u201d  \n\u201cRight, but your more immediate problem is still dealing with your boss. He\u2019s already called security to escort you from the building.\u201d  \n\u201cMaybe,\u201d came the needled drawl of the necromancer, \u201cYou should just kill him, get arrested, and then roll a new character.\u201d  \n\u201cNo,\u201d the priestess said quickly, \u201cyou\u2019re seeing this through one way or another. Even if you are arrested there are whole other story lines I can make because Earth prisons aren\u2019t like ours and there are a lot of things that can happen in there. Plus, it takes them years to execute people instead of days. They\u2019re a lot different.\u201d She hoped that was enough of a threat to make the warlord back down because it was almost entirely a bluff. What the hell kind of story could she tell in a prison?  \nThe orc cursed and consulted his character sheet once more. \u201cI\u2019ll roll diplomacy then.\u201d  \n\u201cTo do what?\u201d  \n\u201cNot get the cops called on me.\u201d  \n\u201cAnd what will you say?\u201d That should stump the orc for a few minutes to let the priestess think of different ways to handle the situation. Amaria didn\u2019t want to blacklist his character and throw the whole group into disarray; not when they were so close to their next objective.  \n\u201cUhh,\u201d boulder sized hands scratched at the orc\u2019s stubbled chin, \u201cI guess, I\u2019m sorry?\u201d  \nCleasz laughed again, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself there.\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good start,\u201d Amaria said, casting the goblin a venomous stare.  \nDice rolled.  \n\u201cOkay, he accepts your apology, but you\u2019re still fired. Your boss looks at you more with pity than fear now and says he won\u2019t mention this to other employers so you could possibly find another job which is super generous of him because he could make a few phone calls and no one would hire you. They allow you time to gather your things before escorting you out of the building.\u201d  \n\u201cI guess I need to do a sending to my wife?\u201d  \n\u201cYou mean make a phone call?\u201d The goblin cackled as the necromancer corrected the orc.  \n\u201cShe is going to kill you,\u201d Cleasz said gleefully.   \n\u201cShe can\u2019t,\u201d the orc turned to Amaria, doubt in his eyes, \u201cCan she?\u201d  \n\u201cIt happens sometimes, but no your wife won\u2019t actually kill you. Thankfully you rolled an IT character so finding jobs isn\u2019t too big of a problem. They\u2019re kind of Earth\u2019s equivalent of wizards so people always need them for different things and there are a lot of ways to specialize. Plus, you get programming in two levels which gives you a lot more freedom.\u201d  \n\u201cHe\u2019ll need it when he gets fired again.\u201d Cleasz\u2019s laugh was cut short as the warlords hands wrapped around his throat. High pitched squeals like a dire rabbit filled the dungeon as the warlord throttled his teammate.  \nAmaria pinched the bridge of her nose again as she cast a freezing spell on the two.  \n\u201cYou know,\u201d the necromancer said as he stood, \u201cI think that might be a record. You only had to freeze them six times tonight.\u201d He gathered his character sheet and model cars. \u201cSame time next week?\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019ve got a summoning so I might be a bit late, but yeah; same time next week.\u201d\n",

Are you *sure* you didn't curse my dice?\" She asked petulantly of the floating skull across the table from her.\n\nXenxar the Barbaraian snorted at her misfortune.  \"Of course they aren't cursed I keep rolling 20s. And I've been using the same dice,  I'll have my own back as soon as I boil them clean again.\"\n\n\"Do I want to know whose brains your cleaning off your dice bad this time?\"  Asked Ellashandra.\n\nXenxar blushed and began to stammer \"H-hey, it's not my fault.  Draskic enchanted my dice to glow an evil red, so I wear them around my neck in battle to intimidate my enemies!  They can't help but get a little messy from time to time.  I mean they are kind of at brain splatter height after all.\"\n\nEllashandra replied pointedly.  \"Yes, we all know, that why I'm asking him if he enchanted *my* dice too!\"  She then shot him a dark glare full of promise.\n\nDraskic, the floating skull across the table, grinned at them both.  Because, of course, he was a skull, and there aren't many other expressions a skull can show.  \"Perhaps your God is influencing your rolls Ell.  He *is* the god of domination after all.

You rolled a 1 on your group charisma check with the other soccer moms.  That means you forgot to even bring treats at all.  The children are all utterly decimated.

He asks you--\"\n\n\"Devastated\"  interjected Xenxar.\n\n\"What?\" Asked Hrequarl.\n\n\"Decimated means to destroy one in ten.  The world you're looking for is devastated, not decimated.\" Replied Xenxar.\n\n\"Oh shut up Xen\" said Elle angrily.  \"I'm getting really tired of this lame game.  It makes no sense at all!  How do you expect me to suspend disbelief when these rediculous situations keep being presented.  First the children are in a battle, over a stupid ball of all things.  Next, the worst injury any of them sustain is some grass stains on their knees.  And instead of praising whatever god they worship that nobody died, they instead expect me to feed their own horrible offspring?  My character doesn't even *like* any if them.  Why in Cinthrall's dark name would I feed their damned kids?  They can feed their own kids!\"\n\nHrequarl started to reply. \"But that's not--\"\n\nEllashandra cut him off sharply.  \" But that's not the worst of it, no.  Last week we did that *church* campaign and you expected me to accept that most of the people there weren't after power.  None of them even sacrificed so much as a rodent, and they were mostly there just to keep their parents and kids from judging them.  The only part that made the tiniest but of sense was all the snide comments they kept making to each other as they self-righteously judged each other for every little thing.\"\n\nDraskic replied first.  \"You're just upset that you've had a bit of bad luck Ella.  The whole point is escapism into a different world where the rules are all different.  It's fun once you start rolling better!\"\n\nHrequarl sighed and said \"look, if you want to stop for tonight we can.  I'll try to modify the *Soccer Season* campaign to make it more believable to you.\"\n\nEllashandra sniffed and replied.  \"See that you do!  Come Xen, I need to get some things out of my system.\"  She grabbed her whip and pulled on her thigh high black boots.\n\nXenxar looked at the rest, let out a big grin and replied.  \"You don't need to ask me twice!\"\n\nAs they got up to leave, neither one noticed Draskic softly chant another curse, renewing his spell on Ellashandra's dice.\n\n\"You know one if these nights, Ella is going to start casting dispel in those and then what are you going to do?\" Said Hrequarl.\n\n\"I don't think so.  She just got the black and pink glow perfect on them.  She'd have to start over customizing them.\"  Laughed Draskic. \"Besides, once she gets jealous enough of Xen, perhaps she will dump him.  Then I'll have my chance with her.\"\n\nHrequarl snorted derisively.  \"You're a floating skull.  I've probably got a better chance with her than you do!\"\n\n\"Don't judge!

At minimum,\" Citi smiled a wicked lil grin. \"Oh That's how I likes to play them - high charisma and seduction. Oh my.

It can open new depths of ennui and quiet desperation.\"\n\nZixor scoffed and dramatically exited for the bathroom with a loud drop of a Plus Two Scepter of the Undead. What does an elf know of desperation?\n\nCiti and Violence exchanged glances. \n\n\"They have a splat on something  called podcasting,\"\" Aerosmith Daughter continued.  \"No more purpose driven addiction-prone yuppies. Now you are tubby underemployed thirtysomethings that share meandering conversations and aged pop culture references. It's all only tangentially related to the topic that brings us together and each one ends with either begging for money or describing mattresses and undergarments delivered regularly by municipal kingdom servants.\" \n\n\"So what would we talk about?\"\n\n\"So glad you asked. I shall soon self-publish a meta-narrative module that I wanted us to playtest. The characters review game books of their realm meant to emulate our own world. And maybe movie reviews. There can never be enough movie review podcasts.\"\n\nCiti and Violence nodded in unison. \"Can we be severely depressed and self-deprecating? Carry the weight of the long slog of life's constant little failures and setbacks? Can we overinvest ourselves in our hobbies to the detriment of the rest of our lives? Suffer faulty equipment ? Attend gatherings of similar aimless souls?\"\n\n\"I see you intuitively understand the format.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Zixor tried to drown in the bathtub but came back as a lich.

            "comment": "\"...and within this safe--which Karok just wonderfully hacked--you find a money-clip, two magazines--adult--and a smartphone.\"\n\n\"MINE!\" Deidre cried. \"I call the smartphone! Is it enchanted??\"\n\nThe others around the table groaned, sneered, or sighed. Deidre had this tick, it seemed, where she always called a found item for her own. Seeing as the elven woman was as fair and (sometimes) foul as one could be, her companions often let her selfishness slide.\n\nAfter all, she was married to the necromancer.\n\n\"Benji,\" she said to her husband, \"Even though I'm not in that room right now, could you be a doll and pick up my new smartphone?\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Babe, but you're not even in this house yet! You decided to stay behind at the Trader Joe's so you could count our Bitcoins! Don't you remember? It's just the three of us here now.\"\n\nDeidre turned her frustrated gaze to her husband, her lover. \"Then... You get *nothing* tonight.\" Only one corner of Deidre's silken lips curled into a knowing smirk. As easily as that, she won.\n\nBenji, playing as a jock--a defensive lineman with a really severe case of berserker's rage--sighed and said: \"I approach the safe and snatch the gotdamn phone, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" their other companions muttered. These two, both staring somberly at their character sheets, counted their own equipment or loots from various sessions. Somehow, even now, Deidre got more than everyone else--and her character wasn't even in the room! But there she was, like every Sunday night, grabbing all the goods: the dope, the guns and knives, the electronics (she had nine different iPads by now). Deidre had even gained the group's first follower: a side-eyed pimp named 'Ramone'. And there she sat, chuckling still.\n\n\"Oops,\" Deidre said between chuckles, \"I need to pee. BRB, boys.\" Deidre got up and walked out of the game room, soon disappearing into the darkness of the hallway. When she was out of sight, the others exchanged glances...\n\nBenji started a quick conversation with their DM, asking about his theories on the 'flat-earth' movement. Old, wise Gandolf began to recite the importance of systematic socialization and exchange of knowledge, ideas... While the weathered DM continued to ramble on, the barbarian and the goblin king took turns looking over Deidre's character sheet.\n\nOnly a minute later, Deidre returned and reclaimed her seat. \"Wait,\" she said immediately, noticing fresh eraser marks on her sheet. \"I'm missing something... I'm missing some *things*...\"\n\nKarok and Thung both did their bests to play it cool; the goblin had a noticeably harder time hiding his guilt than the hefty barbarian. Gandolf, almost always all-knowing, had been enraptured by his soapbox speech; Benji had stopped listening almost instantly. The ruse had seemed to work--until now. It would not last for long.\n\n\"Someone took my QP of Granddaddy Purp. And I'm also missing my Apple watch. Now, we all know it took three weeks for me to get that stupid watch! +3 my ass. Who took it?! Fess up right now!\"\n\nNo one spoke. Deidre snapped her angry glare on her husband.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Uh,\" the necromancer mumbled, \"I need to pee, too.\" Benji quickly rose from his chair and exited the room.\n\n\"I see,\" Deidre whispered vindictively. She ripped a page from her notebook, swiftly scrawled a message, then passed the note to Gandolf.\n\nThe mage's bushy eyebrows seemed to rise three full inches up on his forehead. \"Really? ...Are you sure?\" he asked, almost silently.\n\nDeidre simply nodded, her lips drawn into a tight, thin line.\n\n\"Alright then,\" Gandolf began, sounding both sad and resigned, \"as the jock exits the room where you found the safe, a cold, dark mist begins to rise around Karok and Thung's feet...\n\n\"Make a saving throw.\"\n\nThe barbarian tossed his green-orange 20-sided into the dice tray; the goblin snickered as he did the same with his puke-yellow die.\n\n\"Rook resists the chilling effects--with a 14. Unfortunately,\" Gandolf turned his eyes on Thung's, \"D-Baby is paralyzed--with a 3.\"\n\nKarok smashed a hammered fist against the tabletop, in glee. Thung, on the other hand, groaned. He knew what was coming.\n\nThey all did.\n\nDeidre's ghostly specter arose from the gathering mist behind her companions. The witchy spell-thief did exactly as her note had entailed: rapidly, she struck out with her enchanted switchblade, digging its stiletto point deep into Karok's shoulder. (Deidre rolled. Critical hit!) \"You take nine surprise damage, Karok,\" Gandolf noted. Deidre's character then reached out with a blue-gray hand, shimmering in magical fire, and hit the goblin with a shock of e coli.\n\n\"Ooph,\" said Gandolf, shaking his head and frowning, \"You take minus ten HP from your maximum, Thrung: D-Baby's pretty sick.\"\n\nBenji, meanwhile, was hiding in the hallway, hoping his wife wouldn't lash out at him too. He was a fool.\n\nDeidre's character, enraged, withdrew a +7 Republican-Biased Trump Gun. This she aimed at the wall and opened fire. (Deidre rolled once more. 12. Not a critical, but definitely a solid hit.)\n\n\"Oh, man,\" Gandolf said. A bead of sweat rolled down his long forehead to be caught in his brow. \"Sorry, Benji...\n\n\"The sound of Deidre's trump gun is loud and obnoxious, but devastating nonetheless! Bentarius, still in hiding outside of the safe room, is showered with plaster and takes... ah... oh... plus the bonuses... uh, Deidre? Is that a plus 6 or a plus 7 trumper?\"\n\n\"It's a plus 7,\" she clarified proudly.\n\nGandolf's face seemed to go white--whiter than normal, anyhow.\n\n\"Benji,\" the wizard said, \"I do believe you're dead.\"\n\n\"Dammit!\" Benji howled as he stepped back into the game room. \"Not again, Dee! This is the third time this month!\"\n\nDeidre offered an innocent shrug and reached for her companions' character sheets, ready to loot her friends. \"What would you prefer, dear? A knife in the back? Or a few less Bitcoins to revive you?\"\n\n\"I think I'd rather play Monopoly next time.\"",

            "comment": "The game had started as a strategy to enter the other realm in the same way that the suburban humans had entered their own. By playing these strange, weak, passive characters engaging with their magicless quests to achieve seemingly meaningless goals, this unprecedented alliance of beings had hoped to squash the intrusion of humans into their realm. The intrusion of humans in the very bodies of their peoples, as they adopted them as characters in their 'game'.\n\nBut it hadn't worked. For seven weeks, they had met every 'Wednesday evening after work' at human realm 7pm and adopted the characters of middle class suburbanites. But they had not successfully entered the realm. Why were they meeting again?\n\n Lingnith rolled a D8. \"I'm going to use my cantrip.\" She looked questioningly up at the necromancer Dungeon Master. \nHe looked at his notes, \"what, 'get an Uber'?\"\nLingnith, elven high priestess, was playing a 20 year old college student with rent in arrears due to her drinking habits. She checked her notes. \n\n\"no, no, I've got 'Ask Parents for Money'. I've got to roll a D8 above 5 to overcome their disappointment\". \n\nIt was a 6.\n\n\"ah. Okay. Your Dad answers the phone. He knows you want to ask for money, because he is familiar with your pathetic nature. He doesn't help make you comfortable. He tells you about his game of golf.\" \n\nThe goblin King, laughed. \"this is good! Make her talk about golf! Ask him a question *Sandra*, pretend you are interested!\" He enjoyed calling this high priestess something so ignominious as *Sandra*. \n\nShe didn't react to the Fey Goblin monarch's taunting. \"I say, 'Daddy, I'm in trouble' \". \n\nLingnith had to admit to herself, that she was having fun. And she'd noticed that there was less and less talk of whether or not this game was working, of how to *really* get to the suburban realm. It seemed that the others were having fun, too.\n\nEveryone laughed.\n\n\" 'Daddy!' She called him daddy! That gives him feelings! \", the goblin king slapped the table again. \n\nThe necromancer cleared his throat after gaffawing.\n\n\"His impotent heart melts at your childish language. 'oh princess, what's wrong?' he blubbers, completing the electronic funds transfer of an amount above that needed to cover your rent, even before you ask. 'I've sent you some money, honey. Is that enough?, he says, feeling protective love.\"\n\n\"idiot! She is going to spend it on vodka and life mistakes!\" ",

Again.\n\nShe could hear the necromancer breathing heavily, like he did when he got mad (which was, surprisingly for a guy who once rattled about how all was calm in death, a *lot*). \"Then why did you have five splatbooks about the constables, the military, *and* gang members in Loh'z A'nhela-\" and then she could hear HER breathing get faster, too as she gulped down the urge to punch him because that was NOT how you pronounced it, at all, Godsdamn necromancer pricks with their glottal stops \"-AND a terrain map AND miniatures-\"\n\nThere was another hole in the ceiling, and this time, no one bothered to fix it. The Goblin King looked terrified, and made a note for *no one to ever see him like this* (or allow barbarians near the throne). \"HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THINGS LIKE 'PLOT TWISTS' OR 'SURPRISES' OR 'THE FACT NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOUR NUMBERS?\" The Goblin King also reminded himself to ban spitting forever in his realm as the Barbarian's spittle exploded all over his forehead.\n\n\"Then *why, oh, WHY*,\" the Necromancer screamed as hoarsely as he could (hard to do with decaying vocal chords and half your face transmuted to Yalagadada's tentacles and bony teeth in an attempt to make himself look cool), \"were you complaining LAST GAME about how 'modernists don't have hipsters in the suburbs' or RIPPED UP MY TOME OF PHILOSOPHY????\" Maggots clicked their approval from his shoulders. \"...also, I deal in mutation and blood-based rituals, not... Arithmancy,\" he say, much more politely. That confused the Goblin King and the High Priestess - not because he was a fan of the so-called 'litfic' tomes about normal people that magicians loved because 'it was so much more mature than stories about elves in space' and thus would like Modernist books about sad Irish people unable to move, who were friends with someone who pretended to be rich in the future where everyone crashed their cars.\n\nThat was more than enough from the Elf. \"Probably because no one wants to hear about emo art school rejects piloting giant cockroaches-\"\n\n\"Shut your mouth, you like Lightsprint, or should I say, 'ripped off everything Joao D'Sprail wrote about',\" which was funny, because Joao D'Sprail was mad enough about Lightsprint doing his whole 'Merchant Guilds oppressing everyone in the future through use of the Babbage Machines' shtick being 'copied' that he started casting spells whenever someone tried to write anything about Babbage Machines in Modernist genres.\"\n\nWhile spells began burning the big, heavy tome of 'Suburbs and SUVs', the Goblin King made a note to go play Trailsearcher, instead. It was like Suburbs and SUVs, but with less jackasses...",

What do you do?\u201d Slursh the Goblin King peeks over his screen at the black cloaked figure seated to his left. \n     Toran the Necromancer studies his player sheet for a moment before confidently announcing, \u201cI use my deception skills to bluff.\u201d\n     Slursh pauses a moment before he rolls the dice and looks over his notes, \u201cOkay so she rolls a 11 and with her +2 quick Google search knowledge modifier and her +3 mother\u2019s intuition modifier, compared to your +2 charisma modifier and eldest son +1 conversation bonus means that you will need to roll at least a\u00ac-\u201c\n     \u201cCritical Hit!\u201d Toran shouts as he leaps from his chair, displaying a surprising amount of energy for a human man who has lived for a few centuries. Toran retakes his seat and clears his throat as he shifts into roleplaying, \u201cOh Mom, I see that you found the special oregano I got you for tonight\u2019s dinner. Joey from down the street says that it is guaranteed to improve the taste of any lasagna a thousand times better.\u201d\n\t\u201cShe smiles as she thanks you for your thoughtfulness and walks towards the kitchen,\u201d Slursh groans as he stares at the pages of hand-written notes he had prepared for this encounter, made utterly useless by Toran\u2019s insane luck when it comes to making saving throws. Then he inhales sharply as full realization of what Toran has done dawns on him. Words start to tumble out of his mouth while jumps up so he can grab one of the handbooks he had been using as a booster seat until this point.\n\t\u201cDo you realize what you\u2019ve done?\u201d he shouts as he flips through the pages, \u201cBecause you told her its oregano, extra-tasty oregano at that, for lasagna, that means that she will definitely use it for tonight\u2019s visit by your step-father\u2019s parents. This means that every bite will add\u2026\u201d he pauses as he consults a page of S&amp;S\u2019s Advanced Guide to Meals and Dinner Parties, \u201c-a status effect of moderate intoxication (THC).\u201d\n\tSlursh almost drops the book as he struggles to hold back tears. His hours and hours of careful party planning, filled with backhanded complements from the in-laws and mother\u2019s subtle retorts referring to their advanced age. The eventual breaking point between the adult NPC\u2019s would then lead to a new campaign of family turmoil as the family struggles come together and ultimately end up stronger for it. Now the dinner party will just spiral into giggles and slurred, but somewhat enlightening yet also incredibly stupid statements. \n\t\u201cYou Son of A Troll,\u201d the enormous, muscle-bound man seated across from Toran grumbles, \u201cYou knew I was going dinner tonight to announce that Cynthia has now started dating Lance to the parents and now you\u2019ve ruined it.\u201d\n\t\u201cOh please,\u201d Toran spits out his reply, \u201cYou and I both know she is just trying to use the fact that she is dating Derek\u2019s best friend to draw attention to herself because she feels jealous of her new mother.\u201d\n \t\u201cHow DARE you, she LOVES him,\u201d Korg the Barbarian roars.\n\tGloriana the Elf, who is currently seated at the end of the table, winces slightly as Korg\u2019s words and pitch mirror a conversation she had with her father a few centuries before concerning a rather dashing human rogue. She quickly buries her memories lest her embarrassment start to show on her face. The jackals at this table will never let it go if they think that have something to tease her with. She decides to distract them and regally states: \u201cAs much as I love it when Korg channels his inner 14-year-old girl, can we please move along. My character needs to finish his math homework so he can go upstairs and \u2018pwn some noobs\u2019 online. Evan is almost ready to prestige which will increase his reputation by 250 points within his social circle.\u201d \n\tSlursh takes one last look at his carefully written out dinner scenario before he shrugs and places it to the side. Good Suburb Masters can improvise, and Slursh is the best SM around. \u201cOkay, Evan is at the table doing math homework. Gloriana, I need you to roll for\u2026\u201d\n",

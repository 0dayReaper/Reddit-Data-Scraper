            "comment": "Charles let out a small smirk, glancing at his almost teary eyed opponent. Well he wasn't crying, or even closed to teary eyed, but Charles knew that on the inside, his opponent was in utter shambles. After a grueling 4 hour match, he had finally figured out the move that would lead to his eventual victory, the simple, yet elegant, Qd3. And by the looks of the opponent, he had come to this realization as well. Charles was a few moves away from becoming the Chess World Champion, a goal he had aspired for since his youth. \n\nThe grin on his face becoming wider, he moved his hands towards the Black Queen piece in front of him. The moment he touched the piece, however, he started to feel the sensation he dreaded oh so much.\n\n\"Oh, for fucks sake, not now,\" he thought to himself, the panic rising. \"Please, what did I ever do to deserve this. I mean I know torrenting that one Teletubbies Epi-,\" and before his thought was finished, he vanished from the stage, just like that, leaving his opponent, and the audience, bewildered. \n\nMoments after he left the stage, he started to materialize in an all too familiar room, surrounded with a bunch of kids and their parents. Everyone gazed in awe, some mouths gaping wide open, as they saw the fully suited up Charles pop into existence, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nLittle Johnny tugged at his mom's collar, \"Mommy, is that what they call a real magician?\" Naturally, Johnny's mom was too awestruck to respond, her eyes fixated on the rather dashing Charles.\n\nCharles body started to heat up, and he was blushing wildly, \"Uh, hello everyone. I assure you, this is not what it looks like.\" He started to scan the room quickly, and saw Lana standing in front of the sliding door that lead out. Making his way briskly towards her, brushing past the crowd of startled parents and kids, he gently grabbed her by the shoulder, and took her outside. But not before giving his best fake smile to everyone inside, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, that has been the surprise act for the day, please enjoy the rest of the show. Making a swift motion with his hands, he bowed down, his toupee falling off and falling right into his hands. \n\n\"And yet, another part of the act, the disappearing hair act,\" Charles lamented, gritting his teeth together, knowing what he said made absolutely no sense. He heard a few laughs from the parents and kids alike, before shutting the door behind him. While adjusting his toupee, he glared at Lana, who was shifting her feet uncomfortably, staring at the grass surface beneath her newly bought red Nike Shoes, complimenting her freshly dyed Scarlet Red hair.\n\n\"My God, woman, what is it now? I don't see a single thing that could be possibly be wrong,\" Charles bellowed, his arms flailing wildly, \"Do you realize where I was before this?\" With a loud stomp of his foot, he continued his onslaught of words, \"I was this close,\" his index and thumb finger a hairs width apart, \"This fucking close to winning the World Chess Cham-\" \n\n\"I, uh, need help with this new game I'm playing,\" Lana muttered, bringing her iPhone up to Charles' face. \n\n\"What.\" \n\n\"I can't progress, and I'm really frustrated because this one player keeps kicking my ass.\"\n\nCharles jaw dropped, and using every last bit of his remaining energy from collapsing, he whispered, \"... The Legend 27?\"",

            "comment": "\"I just don't know how I can live like this, Doc. Seeing her now just makes my skin crawl,\" Roger said, staring at the ceiling of his psychiatrist's office.\n\n\"And the medications I prescribed you haven't been helping? You still hallucinate that you're suddenly transported to see ex-girlfriend Liz?\" Dr. Meadows asked.\n\n\"It just happened again two weeks ago. One minute I'm getting ready for work. Then I step out my front door and suddenly I'm on the other side of the state. And there she is looking all weepy and stuff.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I turned around and left, just like I've been doing. Took three buses and a cab to get home. Somehow managed to not get fired.\"\n\nThe doctor nodded her head slowly. \"I have to be honest with you Roger, your case is baffling to me. Your hallucinations are remarkably complex and vivid, and all manage to hold some kind of strange internal consistency, save for the fact that you magically teleport to other places.\"\n\n\"I've heard this speech before Dr. Meadows. You're my third psychiatrist. I hoped that this new cocktail of drugs was going to do the trick too. But it sounds like I'm just certifiably crazy. Save your breath, and don't bother trying to refer me to someone else. I guess I'll just have to live with it.\"\n\n\"I wasn't going to refer you away Roger. Your case *is* baffling to me, but I enjoy the challenge. We need to try some out of the box thinking here. Avoiding your hallucinations doesn't seem to be working. When you get home from here, I want you to look up your old high school flame and call her. The real one. Maybe some connection to the real version of her will help you move on from your subconscious' obsession with her.\"\n\n\"Isn't that going to seem a bit, I dunno, stalker-ish?\"\n\n\"It might,\" she said, standing to show Roger out. \"But have you really got anything to lose?\"\n\n\"I guess not,\" he answered. He stepped out of her office, pulling the door shut behind him.\n\nAs the door clicked shut, the hardwood floor of the office was instantly replaced with muddy grass. Heavy drops of rain pelted him from dark clouds hanging in the sky. A chill wind blew right through the thin jacket he was wearing.\n\nRoger looked around. He was standing in a cemetery. There was Liz, standing over an open grave, clinging tightly to an umbrella. A preacher of some kind stood in front of the grave, droning on in the bored tone of a man who wasn't getting paid enough to eulogize a man he didn't care about.\n\nLiz lifted her gaze from the grave, and her tear filled eyes met Roger's. He turned and started to walk away, but stopped. Roger turned back and looked at her. She was still staring at him, but now her expression turned to confusion.\n\nRoger hesitated a moment longer, then started walking toward her. She seemed to recoil slightly as he came and stood next to her. He looked at the grave marker. It was for Liz's dad.\n\nThe two of them stood there wordlessly while the preacher finished his ceremony. Finally, he snapped his book closed, and nodded in the direction of the two of them. The preacher turned on heel, and left them standing by the open grave.\n\n\"I'm sorry, about your dad,\" Roger said finally.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Liz said softly. \"You haven't talked to me in a long time.\"\n\n\"Not since high school.\"\n\n\"I thought all those times I saw you walking away meant I was getting better. Somehow I'm glad that you're here though. It's better than being alone. But I guess this means I'm still crazy,\" she said.\n\nRoger looked at her, studying her expression. \"Who isn't these days?\" he asked after a pause.\n\nShe let a small laugh escape her lips. Liz looked at him, and smiled. It was the first time Roger had seen that since they had broken up.\n\n\"Would you stay here with me a while?\" she asked softly, tears starting to well back up in her eyes.\n\n\"Sure,\" Roger answered. What did he have to lose?\n\n*****\n\nIf you liked this, subscribe to [Pubby's Creative Workshop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pubby88) to read the rest of my prompt responses.",

One day he'll realize he still loves me. One day he won't leave. Right?\" she thought as she closed the unused jar and placed it in the fridge. \"He's got to know I've been calling him here because I still love him.\" A forceful knock at the door snapped her from her thoughts. She opened the door to a pack of toilet paper from the bodega downstairs on the welcome mat and Steve nowhere to be found. Tears now streaming down her face she bent down and picked up the package. \"Maybe next time.\" she thought. ",

            "comment": "\"I'll have the buffalo burger--medium rare--please,\" Alan said, before looking over at his date and smiling. She met his eyes and nodded. \"and the same for her. Thank you.\" The waiter collected the menu and left the two alone. Decorations adorned the restaurant he'd chosen for this first date. Lots of pink hearts of all different sizes. \n\n\"So,\" she started, \"how was work?\"\n\nAlan smiled and leaned forward. \"Nothing too exciting, just kept working on that case I told you about. You?\"\n\n\"Same. Minus that working on a case bit,\" she laughed. Her bright blue pool of eyes threatened to swallow him whole. Alan knew he wouldn't mind that one bit. \n\n\"Count yourself lucky, Julie. Sometimes I feel like I'm climbing a mountain of--\"\n\n**Poof**\n\nA car roared by, speeding down a four lane highway. Alan screamed and stumbled backwards into a median. \n\n\"What the fuck!\" he yelled. Ten years and he still hadn't gotten used to this. \n\nA familiar face appeared from behind a parked car--Allie's Camry. The emergency lights blinked on and off. \"Sorry,\" she said apologetically, giving him a short smile. The first thing Alan noticed was her short brown hair. She'd finally cut it. Her bronze eyes locked onto his, two windows into the past. \n\n\"Allie, I was on a date. She's gotta be's freaked out... I haven't told her about--about _this_ yet. Not like they stick around after I tell them,\" his voice dropped into a mumble.\n\nAllie bit her lip, \"Oh,\" she replied, her eyes dropping. \"Sorry.\"\n\nAlan sighed. \"It isn't your fault. You're not the one who said something stupid.\" Once the shock drained from his mind he paused to inspect the situation. \"Flat tire?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nWith a quick shake of his head he moved to help her. The sooner Allie drove off, the sooner he could return to salvage whatever remained of his date. Alan exhaled to force the frustration away. Allie had already moved the jack underneath the car. No more than twenty minutes would be needed if the two worked together. \n\n\"No AAA, huh?\" Allie rolled her eyes and moved to the back of the car. Alan squatted and started raising the car.\n\nAfter a moment Allie reappeared with a socket wrench in hand. \"Ever the comedian.\" Alan looked up and grinned.\n\nA minute later the car rose a few feet off the ground. Alan took the wrench from Allie and began loosening the lug nuts. The silence between the two broke whenever a car zoomed by. \n\nFinally Allie spoke, \"What's she like?\"\n\n\"Who?\" he asked, distracted. \n\n\"Your date, you looby.\"\n\n\"Ah. Julie's nice. She's smart and kind, works as a nurse. I like her.\"\n\nDespite Alan being unable to see her, she nodded and smiled. \"Good, I'm happy for you. I just hope I didn't mess anything up.\" \n\n\"It's all right,\" he replied. \"Really.\"\n\nThe two fell silent again as Alan focused on getting the wheel off. He'd taken off all the lug nuts, carefully handing them to Allie. Losing those damn nuts was the last thing he needed. Alan rose and bent backwards to crack his back. \n\n\"You okay? You're doing all the work. I feel bad.\" \n\n\"I'm fine,\" he replied, walking over to the trunk. Allie had taken the replacement wheel out already. \"Here, help me with the wheel.\" Alan motioned for Allie to hold it so it wouldn't roll away. A horn blared as Allie walked over. Alan turned and his eyes widened. Mustering all of his strength Alan jumped toward Allie and pushed her away as a white Mustang slammed into the side of her Camry. The car crumpled from the force, falling off the jack. The Mustang bounced off and away before coming to a stop in the middle of the next two lanes.\n\n\"Oh fuck!\" Allie screamed from the other side of the median. \"Oh fuck, _fuck_, shit, shit, shit!\" Carefully she climbed back over the median. \"Alan, jeez, you really saved me there. You okay?\" No response came. \"Alan?\" Concern crept into her voice. Voices screeched from a distance. Everything felt numb. Allie couldn't hear herself repeat her question. Her eyes fell upon the point of impact, then followed along the rear toward the median. The car had been pushed forward a few feet, grinding along the concrete barrier. Where was Alan?\n\n\"Help, someone help!\" a frantic voice called. \"Someone help me!\" Allie shook her woolheadedness away and almost ran forward. Traffic had stopped at this point and those once distant voices sounded much closer. She rounded her broken car, barely noticing the pain in her knee. \n\nHer savior lay splayed in front of the Mustang. Blood gushed from beneath Alan's hair and his limbs twisted unnaturally. Something stopped Allie from running to his side. A second later and he disappeared. Allie shuddered and dropped to her knees.",

            "comment": "Garrett had a love-hate relationship with Kelly.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me? I was in the middle of a job interview, Kelly. Do you have any idea how much you are ruining my life?\u201d\n\nAfter all this time, he only saw her in her moments of need. That sort of vulnerability can be endearing, even intimate. It is also horribly draining. \n\n\u201cKaren just called me. She has breast cancer. With dad gone, I don\u2019t have anyone else to turn to.\u201d She was really trying to hold back tears, but Garrett knew it would be a matter of time.\n\n\u201cDamn. Ok, I\u2019m sorry, Kelly. Mint chocolate chip in the freezer?\u201d She nodded. \u201cAll right, you grab the Kleenex, I\u2019ll get the bowls. Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d At least now they had a routine.\n\nThe first time it happened after they broke up, he was annoyed. She had a test or something that she hadn\u2019t studied for the next day. He thought it was a cosmic mistake. The second time it happened, he was devastated. The Jaguars were one catch away from the regional championship, and instead of clutching the game-winning ball, he found himself holding her broken arm. This wasn\u2019t a fluke. It was permanent. Some of the guys had never forgiven him. That\u2019s where the hate came from.\n\nWhen Kelly\u2019s dad died in that wreck, Garrett was actually glad for the curse. But each ex-boyfriend recovery session made him profane the day he was born. It got easier over time, but also more intrusive, as they drifted apart socially. He still decided to go to college nearby, though, for logistics\u2019 sake.\n\n\u201cSo how\u2019s her husband and kids taking it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re upbeat about it all, like usual.\u201d Kelly sniffed, then smiled at him. \u201cYou were always like that, too. I don\u2019t know how you would have lived with my mess if you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me, there are days I\u2019m not.\u201d He decided it was a good thing she was a fan of mint chocolate chip. If it was peach, this relationship, such as it was, would not work. A smile grazed his lips.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She leaned forward.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about how absurd this is, to be honest.\u201d Her frown made it clear that is not what she expected. \u201cI mean, come on, Kelly. You can\u2019t go through life relying on me. One of these days I\u2019ll have a family. They\u2019ll need me more than you do. Are you going to hold my attention hostage then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\" she yelled, \"You freaking asked for it! Do you think I want to see your face every time? Do you think I want to be reminded that you rejected me? That every man in my life leaves or rejects me? That\u2026\u201d Whatever else she had to say was drowned in sobs.\n\n*Well, shit. Not my best work yet.* Garrett moved over to the couch and laid a comforting hand on her shoulder. She shrugged it off angrily the first time, but not the second. He knew her better than that by now.\n\nGarrett didn\u2019t really hate her for all of this. Hated the cosmic poltergeist who gave this to him, sure, but not her. He saw her now more truly than he did in those hormonal teenage years. He saw what hurt her. He saw what scarred her. And in his absences, he saw what she endured, and what she pulled through. In a way, Garrett had come to admire her. It wasn\u2019t until he had started realizing that he was regretting the infrequency of her calls that he realized something had changed.\n\nGarrett was falling for her again. It wasn\u2019t a graceful fall into a woman who swept him away with breathtaking beauty. It was her beauty of small things, of life lived purposefully amidst trial. It was seeing real things about her. True things. Too many girls tried to sell him a fa\u00e7ade. Kelly only met him in her moments of greatest honesty. It was oddly alluring.\n\n\u201cLook, Kelly, I\u2019m here for you because once upon a time I wanted to be. Truth be told, part of me still wants to be. I just need you to know that being needed, in the absence of any other form of relationship, is horrible for me.\u201d She looked up at him with reddened eyes. She wasn\u2019t that pretty in the moment, but he was sure of it \u2013 she was beautiful. And it had taken ten years for him to realize it.\n\nHe continued, \u201cHow about this? Can we start over? Let\u2019s get to know each other as friends, since we seemed to have skipped that step entirely. And maybe, from there, you\u2019ll be able to figure out who you can truly rely on.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that. And Garrett, you\u2019ve always been there for me, even when I hated you for it. You\u2019ve always been my best friend.\u201d",

            "comment": "Amelia's life has been a strange one since the age of 15, when she met Eric at a bus stop on her way home from school; they had a short-lived tryst and never expected to see one another again.\n\nOver the remaining years of High School, Eric just always seemed to be around whenever something happened.  Her first car got a flat tire and Eric seemed to come out of nowhere to lend a hand;  she twisted her ankle at the park and Eric was there to help her home.  Eric was always there.  At first, Amelia found it to be endearing, but each time it seemed like Eric had a growing look of resentment in his eyes.\n\nHigh School passed and Amelia moved away from the Midwest to fulfill her childhood dreams of attending art school in New York.  Thousands of miles from home and Eric showed up in her hallway when Amelia locked herself out of her Apartment.  Eric was supposed to be back in Kansas City working at his dad's construction firm, but he was here... Eric is always here.  Amelia got mugged and Eric was there; Amelia got in a fight with her boyfriend and Eric was there.  Any endearment Amelia once felt towards Eric turned into fear.\n\nEric's stalking of Amelia took it's toll on Amelia, but she managed to get through college; she was absolutely ecstatic to land a design position in San Francisco;  it was a gateway into he dream career and she could finally escape the nightmare of Eric.\n\n*****\n\nIt's 10 years since the fateful day that Eric met Amelia at the bus stop and professed his oath to always be there for her.\n\nTen miserable years.  \n\nEric is at home playing X-Box and within the blink of an eye he is transported to the shoulder of a busy highway, standing next to Amelia.  Eric was confused, a deer in the headlights, but he had no ill feelings towards Amelia and helped change out her tire.\n\nEric was completing his homework only to be whisked away as if by magic to stand next to Amelia grasping her twisted ankle in the park.  It didn't matter what Eric was in the middle of, he always transported to Amelia when she was in need.  Any good faith Eric felt towards Amelia quickly turned into disdain as Eric realized that Amelia was a curse.\n\nHigh school finished and Eric was ecstatic to learn that Amelia was going off to the East Coast.  He had a job lined up with his father and he could be rid of Amelia once and for all - freedom; he could drive a car without being transported away; he could go on dates without disappearing.  It was with significant shock and hatred when he opened his eyes to find himself outside of Amelia's New York apartment watching Amelia dig through her purse.  The curse was still there.\n\nIt's been 10 years of the Amelia curse; 10 years of misery.  Kansas City, New York, San Francisco.  He hated Amelia for what his life had become, and he knew that Amelia hated him - she had even filed a restraining order.  Eric is drinking alone, as he often does, and opens his eyes to find himself trapped next to Amelia in a burning wreck.\n\nThey died together.",

            "comment": "My grandmother still worships the old gods. I dont know how she can keep track of all of them. There seems to be a god for every problem. I probably should have played more attention in history when we went over all this stuff. She always said I was a favorite of Aphrodite.  She warned me that living with the favor of a God/Goddess would be difficult. I should have listened. \n\nMeeting girls has always been easy for me. People said I was just charming. I know better now. I met Sita when I was 15. There was something about her that just ignited a fire in me. As always I was able to catch her attention with just a short conversation. It wasn't long before the whole school knew we were dating. She was so beautiful.  Long raven hair, bright green eyes that actually sparkled when she was happy. A smile that could brighten a room instantly and she always smelled so good. I knew from the moment we spoke that I was in love. Thinking back on it now, what did I know of love? I was a kid. A dumb idealistic brat in love with the Idea, of being in love. \n\nI remember that day after the homecoming dance. We were walking hand in hand. We stopped under the bleachers by the football field. She kissed me and I told her I loved her. She said she loved me too. I told her, \"No matter what, I'll always be there for you. I swear on our love\"\nShe broke up with me 3 weeks later. No explanation,  no apology.  Just, \"this isn't working. Find someone else\"\nI was as heartbroken as a kid could be. After a while I swore I'd never say those words to a girlfriend again unless I was sure she loved me too. I got rid of all her pictures and little gifts. I never wanted to see her again, but the God's take oaths seriously. \n\nI saw her again, for the first time 2 years later. I was driving home in the muscle car my parents got me for my birthday. It needed a lot of work but I was excited to have wheels. I saw her hunched over in the rain and cold by the bus stop. She had a large bag next to her. Too big to be for school. I pulled over. I got out and sat next to her, she barely looked up at me. \"Hey\" was all she said.\n\"Hey\" I replied. \"Need a ride?\" I asked.\n\"That yours?\" She asked. \"Yeah, birthday gift\" I responded.\nShe nodded. \"You have awesome parents.\" She whispered. She looked up at me. \"Im leaving town. I have an aunt that lives 3 hours away. If your serious about the ride, will you take me?\" She asked. \nI thought about it for a moment. I'd just gotten the car and had never been out of town on my own before. Still the way she looked at me, her eyes pleading and full of sorrow. I couldn't say no. \"Sure, hop in. Ill get your bag.\"\nIt didnt occur to me to ask why she was leaving or where her parents were. It just felt right to help. I got home at 4am. I was grounded for 2 months and my car was taken from me. She had smiled that beautiful smile when in had dropped her off. It was worth it. \n\nI met her again when I was a junior in college. I was invited to a frat party for the first time ever and almost didnt go. I felt I would miss out if I didnt though. College is about the experiences, so im told. At first I wasnt sure it was her, it had been so long, but when she smiled I knew. I wanted to talk to her and for a moment our eyes met. She was swooped up by a good looking guy in a football jersey before I could reach her. I spent the rest of the party bored. It was when I went searching for a bathroom that I found her again. I was told the bathroom was down the hall but I kept getting turned around. She came rushing out of a room I had passed twice. Her clothes were a mess and her lip was bleeding. She saw me and grabbed my arm. The guy I had seen her with came out of the room a few moments later. He stopped when he saw me. \n\"Hey\" she said. \"I havent seen you in forever, walk me to my car?\" She asked.\nI stood there glaring at the guy in the jersey. \"Sure, no problem\" I finally reply. She didnt let go of me until we reached her car. Once again I earned a smile as she drove away. I walked back to my dorm thinking that one day, that smile would be the death of me. \n\nSo on it went, I loved and lost and loved again. I would love my life and years would pass before seeing her again. Each moment we met was when she needed me most. Sometimes it was for small things, like a ride, other times it was more serious. I was there for her, just like I swore I would be. I stopped being surprised after a while. I lived my life with the assurance that I would see her again and earn another smile. I became successful in my career, had everything I'd ever wanted and more. Still, I would go out into the world each day, looking for her face amongst the crowd. Waiting for the moment when she would need me again. \n\nNow that final moment has arrived. That moment I knew would come. When that smile would be the death of me.\n\nThis story,  is for you Sita. So you would understand why I did what I did. You see, I met your husband. He's a good man. I realize now why I hadn't seen you in so long, after meeting him. He showed me pictures of you and your kids. They're as beautiful as their mother. All with that same gorgeous smile. Dont worry, I didn't tell him I knew you. He came to ask me for something. Something apparently only I can give. \n\nMy cancer is inoperable. I have been given only weeks to live. Caught it too late they said. The doctor told me because of my condition and my rare blood type,  I would be doing the hospital and several people in it, a great service and sacrifice,  if I would donate my organs. I hadn't made my decision until today. When your husband showed me your picture,  I knew. This is the last time I can be there for you. What I give to you hasn't been mine for a long time. Its been yours ever since I swore that oath, so many years ago. I give you my heart, to care for and keep safe.\n\nMy oath is kept, I have no regrets. Who am I to question the Gods? ",

            "comment": "\"I'll always be there for you,\" I'd told Julia, sobbing on my shoulder. Her foster parents had chased her out of the house again, and we just sat in the park together.  I lightly lifted her chin to look into her tear-stained eyes, and hugged her close. She seemed to be reassured by my condolences, believing it wholeheartedly. Problem was, powers above heard it too, and wanted to hold me to it.\n\nFor a while, things between us seemed to go well. She was very affectionate, wanting to meet up with me every free moment she had available. Her dirty blond hair and quickly developing curves did more for me than affirm my worth as a male. However, she grew restless, checking on me once an hour, calling to make sure I'd made it home okay, wanting to talk late at night for hours on end far beyond the conversation's end, listening to just the sound of me breathing into the receiver.\n\nIt got a bit tiresome, and faster than I imagined it would. A couple of weeks later I simply shut my phone off for the weekend. I turned it back on at the start of the school-week to an intense smattering of missed calls and frantic texts. I walked into the crowded hallways before homeroom and saw her running towards me. I didn't mean to abandon her, but I wasn't the superman she'd been expecting of me, and tried to dodge her. She shouted out above the din of the crowd, \"Don't leave me! I love you!\" \n\nSuddenly I realized all the red flags popping up all around me that I wasn't right for her. I attempted to dodge her into a nearby hallway, only to find myself immediately back in front of her. It was strange, but confronted with the situation and being able to run away any further simply offered her excuses about how my phone was to blame, that I wasn't trying to ignore her. She accepted the lie, but clung ever tighter to me still. I tried to simply claim being busy with schoolwork and distance myself, pushing her slowly away. Eventually she began to take the hint, and the frantic calls and texts slowed down to a crawl.\n\nThen one night, as sudden as a blink, I found myself facing her shrieking in her room, when just a moment before I was reading in bed. She wasn't screaming at me, but a curiously large spider dangling from a silken thread in front of her. I cupped the spider in my hands, and pulled it away from her, only to have her renewed shock at me suddenly appearing in her bedroom in my underwear. Her foster parents came running at the scream and threw me out immediately, leaving me to wonder what the heck just happened as I stood outside in the night without pants.\n\nShe'd tried to use this event as a rekindling of our love, but I'd firmly denied it, not sure of what had happened myself. It wasn't until a few weeks later that I found myself facing her once again. I was browsing the internet when I found myself facing her on the toilet, with her pants around her ankles. Rather than screaming, the color simply drained out of her face in fear before realizing it was me once again.\n\n\"Oh good, as long as you're here, can you go get me some tampons?\" I looked at her incredulously, her dismissal of my sudden appearance appalling, but shrugged and went to get her the tampons.\n\nThe more I tried to get away from her, the more it seemed she encountered problems I was destined to help her out of. It only got worse after we'd finished school and moved out. I'd been called through space-time to fix everything from getting lost, flat tires, leaky pipes, and even indecision on what she wanted to eat for dinner. I'd begun to feel more like her personal handy-man, and started compiling a veritable utility belt to help solve her problems at a moment's notice that I wore around at all times. It came complete with feminine products, advil, wd40, duct tape, an epipen, screwdrivers, make-up, tissues, and even a barf bag.\n\nThough there were some things a utility belt cannot solve. I'd been tasked to comfort her violent sobs as she cried in the night, terrified that just like her birth-parents, even her divine guardian would abandon her as so many others did. Too tired to get myself home, I'd laid with her, petting her until she calmed down, and fell asleep with her hands wrapped around me. I didn't feel much for her anymore, but I wasn't such a coward as to abandon those hurting right in front of me.\n\nI stopped trying to leave so quickly after that, but I didn't want to give her false hope that I was a panacea to all of her relationship troubles, and tried to steel my heart. I'd discussed the phenomenon with her extensively, and wanted to take a vacation for once. Go somewhere warm and tropical where she wouldn't summon me for a couple days. She begrudgingly agreed to try solving her own problems for a couple of days. I still wore the utility belt, just in case.\n\nI wasn't able to fully relax, and looked positively silly wearing nothing but swim trunks and a condensed fanny pack. In the blink of an eye I was standing back in front of her, her face truly terrified. I turned and looked what she was so terrified of, and saw a masked mugger with a gun pointed at her, and therefore at me. I didn't have time to think, time to grab anything. I simply narrowed my eyes grit my teeth, and charged the mugger like the crazy man in swim trunks I was. I should be thankful that he was surprised enough not to shoot me, and he stumbled backwards, not expecting opposition. I tackled him into the snowy ground, cold ice stinging against my bare skin, and threw what punches I could trying to get the gun away from him. Somehow I managed to get a grip on the barrel and tossed it away, though the mugger managed to scramble to his feet and run away.\n\nI immediately turned and checked on Julia, my red face and dripping nose forgotten, and through her crying eyes I could see an overjoyed smile. She reached up to wrap her hands around my head and pulled me into a kiss. Between the adrenalin of a fight and the ecstasy of victory, I let my testosterone take over and kissed her back. I kissed her like it was the last time I'd ever see her, terrified that I might never again.\n\nShe started to grow more confident afterwards, calling on me less, and crying less  at night. I took her to see a psychiatrist and therapist about her abandonment issues, and even sat in with her in a couple sessions to support her, of my own volition for once! I started to see her smile on her own again, taking up the arts she'd left behind so long ago.\n\nAnd in that smile, I realized: I never wanted to leave her again.",

The bus stop was a 15 minute walk down the street. Not terrible considering all the times he's ended multiple states over, with no clue on how to get back. \n\nHe threw his hood up, and started his was back home.\n\nIt didn't matter to Marcus anymore. This was a weekly occurrence at this point. He had lost countless jobs, blown off friends, and missed out on a long list of relationships. All because of an empty promise he made to a girl he barely even knew. \n\nHe used to get frustrated, but at a certain point, it became a ritual. \n\nAs he boarded the bus, he felt that familiar feeling. His body was being dragged to another location.\n\nHe came to in Katie's living room. But this time she stood over a man, covered in blood. \n\n\"What the fuck...\" Marcus said under his breath. \n\n\"I can explain.\"\n",

But here we are again.\" Juniper kept an eye on the door to her interrogation room, waiting for the foreign agents to return. \n\nAfter gnawing on a particularly tight section of rope, Mitch spat. \"Can't you get a more relaxing job? Like in an office? I could just show up to help get the printer working or something like that.\"\n\n\"Mitch, you know this has been my life's ambition.\"\n\n\"But it isn't MINE. You've dragged me along for this whole ride, working your way towards the top of the heap. I think you LIKE that I was cursed.\"\n\nJuniper rolled her eyes, but said nothing. Her bonds fell to the ground. As she rubbed her wrists, Mitch crossed his arms and pouted. \n\n\"I'm going to get fired, ya know. I can't keep randomly disappearing with no notice.\"\n\n\"So I'll get you a job in an office with my association.\"\n\n\"I want nothing to do with you!\"\n\nThe handle of the steel door turned with a clunk. A grating squeal of rusty metal cut through their argument as Juniper's captors swung the door open. \n\nAs they rushed in to fight, Juniper took them on alone with nothing but the chair, the rope, and her martial arts skills to aid her. \n\nMitch shrieked and cowered in a corner. He never was much help in a fight. ",

            "comment": "The first time was confusing. Mark, in fact, used the words \"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?\" but as an impartial, polite narrator, I'll use 'confusing'.\n\nIt was a mugging. Lyla was coming home from her first date after the breakup and the dude pointed the knife and \nsaid, \"Give me the purse, bitch.\"\n\nAnd Mark, in his underwear, a yellow lipstick of Cheetos around his mouth, materialized in front of them, straight from his living room couch.\n\n\"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON!?\" he uttered, as previously mentioned, which was not intended to, but \nhad the effect of, stopping the mugging right away, as the mugger, upon watching a half-naked man materialize \nhimself in front of him out of thin air like popcorn bursting into existence from corn except with a person and \nnothingness (Jesus, what a crappy narrator I am), proceeded to politely say \"Oh, fuck,\" and go home (later, I heard, he checked into an institution and got into New Age music and Paulo Coelho, but that's a story for another day).\n\nWell, after much debate, Mark and Lyla decided that what had just happened was either collective hallucination or \nundeniable proof that the universe was fundamentally different than humanity had been assuming for thousands of years and all human knowledge had just been rendered obsolete and we'd have to start over from the pre-Socratics on. They figured it didn't really matter, because either way they both had lives to get to and shit to do, and decided to get on with their stuff. They parted ways.\n\nIt was after the third time (the second being another, totally unrelated mugging), when Lyla got trapped in an \nelevator during a power outage and Mark materialized itself once more in front of her, that they figured out that \nthe whole thing was a pattern, and that apparently Mark would show up whenever Lyla was, in his words, \"in some deep shit or whatever.\"\n\n\"So whenever I'm in trouble, you just\u2026 show up?\"\n\n\"Apparently.\"\n\n\"Why!?\"\n\n\"Gee, Lyla, I don't know, let me check my International Guide to Unexplainable Phenomena.\"\n\n\"You're being sarcastic, aren't you?\"\n\n\"No, I really have a guide for unexplainable phenomena.\"\n\n\"Now you're being sarcastic about being sarcastic, aren't you?\"\n\n\"I'll add another layer if you keep bothering me.\"\n\n\"God, you're annoying, no wonder I broke up with you.\"\n\n\"I broke up with you.\"\n\n\"No you didn't.\"\n\n\"Internally I did.\"\n\nThis continued for something like forty minutes, until the firemen came and rescued them (as, of course, though \nMark had indeed materialized in front of Lyla to be there in her time of need, he lacked the tools to get them out of \na stopped elevator.)\n\nIt started getting suspicious, as far as Mark was concerned, the seventh time Lyla was caught in the middle of a disagreement with drug addicts in the town's worst neighborhood. That's when he started suspecting foul play on her part.\n\nAll the same, he kept to himself, standing by her side as the crackheads robbed her\u2026 then him (because, it turns \nout, crackheads are not as easily spooked by people materializing out of thin air as muggers are\u2026 these guys just \nsaid \"Woah, dude just popped into existence. Let's rob him too!\")\n\nThen it was a cliff \u2013 literally, Lyla standing on the edge of a cliff, about to lose balance, and Mark popped up by her \nside to save her. \n\nThen it was a minor car accident.\n\nThen a fight with this bitchy girl she knew from high school.\n\nMark decided to say something when he suddenly materialized in front of Lyla inside a warehouse filled to the \nceiling with towers and towers of cocaine packs and surrounded by angry, machine-gun wielding Brazilian men somewhere deep in the rainforests of South America.\n\n\"Okay, that's it,\" he said, as soon as he laid eyes on Lyla, tied to a chair in the back of the room, behind some drug stacks. \"What the hell, Lyla!?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"I got lost hiking.\"\n\nHe got closer to her, untied her, careful not to alert the men patrolling the warehouse just behind the stack of \ncocaine they were pressed against. \"No you didn't.\"\n\n\"Excuse me!?\"\n\n\"Look, I'm sorry it didn't work out between us,\" Mark said, as she got up and rubbed her wrists. \"But you gotta \nstop putting yourself into dangerous situations just because you want to try to hurt me.\"\n\n\"What!?\"\n\n\"You don't think I've noticed!? Seven muggings! Random fights! Random cliffs! And now you show up at a drug \nwarehouse in South America!? You hate hiking! Come on, Lyla, it's so obvious! You're trying to get me killed!\"\n\n\"Who's there!?\" came a voice from behind the cocaine stack, because Brazilians speak English when it's convenient for the plot.\n\n\"Is that what you think I'm doing!?\" Lyla asked.\n\n\"Well, isn't it!? Why else would you keep putting yourself into these dangerous situat \u2013\"\n\n\"BECAUSE I MISS YOU, YOU IDIOT!\" She pushed him. \"I MISS YOU AND I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CALL YOU \nAND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO SEE YOU FROM TIME TO TIME.\"\n\n\"Hey, there's a dude with the girl we caught over here!\" One of the drug thugs showed up, pointing the gun.\n\n\"You miss me?\" Mark asked, quietly.\n\n\"Yes, you idiot. What, you think I take trips to the rainforest and end up on coke farms by accident?\"\n\nMore men showed up, all wielding machine guns. They pointed.\n\n\"Fuck, why didn't you just say so?\"\n\n\"Cause you never seem happy to see me.\"\n\n\"THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH WHEN I SEE YOU, NOT BECAUSE I STOPPED LOVING \nYOU!\"\n\n\"You still love me?\"\n\n\"OF COURSE I DO, YOU STUPID BITCH!\"\n\n\"Why are you yelling?\"\n\n\"BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE!\"\n\nShe looked at the men. Then at Mark. \"It does look that way.\"\n\n\"I'M GONNA KISS YOU NOW.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" She smiled.\n\nAnd they did kiss. And then, of course, the Brazilian drug men opened fire and they died a very bloody, horrible death, but it was kind of romantic, really. I thought so, at least.\n\n\n_____\n\n/r/psycho_alpaca",

            "comment": "The sounds and smells of New York assaulted John's senses. After being gone from the city for 10 years, he still love/hated the smell of New York City in the summer. It was dark on the street. Darker than a street should seem. Looking up he noticed the lights had been busted out on the light pole. \n\nHe heard a soft *John* behind him and he turned. She had gotten her hair cut. He couldn't tell the color but it looked like she'd gone back to being a brunette. He always did have a thing for brunettes.\n\nHe smiled. \"Hey. Fancy meeting you here.\"\n\nShe surged forward and hugged him fiercely. She had grown taller than him years ago, but he couldn't begrudge her that. Even as a kid she'd been all legs. She was slim again. \n\n\"I can't believe your here!\" She cried with tears in her voice.\n\n\"Yeah I'm here. How longs it been?\"\n\n\"Almost four years now. Johnny is about to turn four in a few weeks.\"\n\n\"Wow. He's getting big. I can hug you now with no baby bump.\" \n\nShe laughed remembering the last time he'd come to her. She'd gone into labor unexpectedly and was alone without her cell phone nearby. Their reunion, however, was cut short by a shout from the end of the block.\n\n\"Ay lady! That kid botherin' ya?\" \n\n\"No.\" She shouted back. \"He's with me!\"\n\n\"A'ight. I noticed those bums trynna follow ya but I sen em off.\" Said a gruff Italian walking towards the pair.\n\n\"Oh goodness. Thank you so much. I thought I had shaken them off and then when I realized I hadn't I was just all turned around.\" She responded, her hand on her chest. *ah* thought John. *That's why I'm here* \n\n\"Yeah, fageddaboudit. Look, yous gotta be careful in the Bronx. You can't be out here at night with just a kid keeping you company, ya know what I'm sayin. Those bums tried telling me some stuff but I told em to tell their story walkin.\" \n\nJohn stuck out his hand. \"Hey man, thanks a lot for that. I didn't realize she'd attracted some unwanted attention. I'm gonna get her home safe now.\" \n\nThe Italian shook his hand back and said, \"Yeah, you do dat son. Go on up to White Plains Road. See if you can catch a cab. Don't be taking ya moms on no subways round here, ya hear? Yous guys get home safe, a'ight.\"\n\n\"Will do, sir.\" John responded with a respectful nod.\n\nThe pair turned and walked up the road towards the tell tale screeching of a subway car stopping towards where the man had pointed. \n\nThey walked in silence for a moment. \n\n\"I'm not sure how I feel about being mistaken for your mother now.\"\n\nThey shared a good laugh before lapsing into silence. As they neared the busy, populated street they both slowed. For a few moments they just watched the people passing. John loved how alive the scene in front of them was.\n\n\"Even with as much as it's changed, it's still the same.\"\n\nShe smiled wistfully, watching his face. Her eyes seemed intent on taking in every facial expression of his. He meet her gaze with that youthful grin she'd fallen in love with as a kid. \n\nHe noticed the lines on her face. No doubt some put there by his namesake. Some by grief she'd experienced. And the rest by time. Time that he'd lost.\n\n\"It's good to see you again.\" she whispered.\n\nHe grinned even wider. \"It's good to be seen!\" \n\nHe didn't want to see the tears in her eyes that he knew were inevitable. She should always be smiling. She was safe now and he could feel himself fading again. \n\n\"You tell your boy I said hey. Take care of yourself... Mom.\" \n\nShe huffed through her tears and stared as her once childhood love faded from sight with that eternal boyish grin. Even though he'd been gone for 10 years, the grief was always fresh. But it was accompanied by the comfort that her guardian angel was still watching over her.\n\nEdit: Spelling. Did this on my phone.",

            "comment": "*Pop*\n\n\"Oh...hey, John.\" \n\n\"Hey, Margarete.\" \n\nJohn sighed. Her bedroom was a mess - a total, absolute, pig-sty-hit-by-a-tornado kind of mess the likes of which made him cringe. Magazines, sheets, and even bits of old food covered the carpet like a layer of soil. But it was nothing compared to her. \n\nIt was a familiar scene to John at this point. Her crying, sitting on the edge of her bed, not quite covering the bruises over her eyes. The apartment was different, at least, but the story was nothing new. New guy. New place. Same problem. \n\nHe started to clean.\n\n\"How is Dave treating you these days, Mar?\" He asked, feigning ignorance as he picked up a particularly crusty Playboy. \n\n\"Gone.\" She said, simply. \"He was cheating, like I thought. Like you thought, I guess. So I got out.\" \n\n\"That's good news, Mar.\" John shot her a sad smile as he dumped the first pile into the trash. \"And the new guy is...?\" \n\n\"Josh.\" Margarete said, quickly. \"He seemed so nice at the bar, paid for me and everything. A real gentleman.\" \n\n\"But he hit you, didn't he.\" John said. \n\nMargarete didn't answer. He continued to clean in silence. \n\n\"You can't just...it wasn't his fault, Ok? He was drunk!\" She finally snapped. \"Who the hell are you, coming in here, telling me how to live my life? With your...your good clothes, fancy shoes! I bet you never had to deal with any crap in your entire life!\" \n\nStill, John was silent. He moved into the bathroom, which was somehow in an even worse state. \n\n\"I don't see any needles this time. Cutting back?\" He called. \n\nThis time, Margarete was silent. John kept cleaning. \n\n\"Mar? You still in there?\" He asked, poking his head out into the other room. To his surprise, she was looking up at him, cheeks stained with tears. In her hands, she held a small stick made of cheap white plastic, half hidden behind her shaking fingers.\n\n\"John...I. It's not...\" She stammered. \"I...I can't. I can't leave, not anymore.\" She held the object up, half displaying it to John as if she wasn't sure that she wanted him to see it. \"It's not just about me anymore.\" \n\nJohn swallowed, finally understanding. \"Whose...?\" He asked. \n\nMargarete just shook her head. \"I don't know...it could have been Dave, I guess. But I can't go back there, John, I just can't!\" \n\nJohn nodded. \"I understand.\" He said. \"But, Margarete...you can't stay here either. You know that. What will Josh do when he finds out? Or...did he already find out, and this is what he did to you?\" \n\n\"I'm so scared, John!\" Margarete sobbed. \"I don't know what to do, where to go...\" \n\n\"It's going to be ok, Mar. I promise.\" John said. \"Do you still have your cousin's number? Up in Newport?\" \n\nMargarete nodded. \n\n\"Good. Go there, and don't look back. They'll help.\" \n\n\"Thanks...John, I...Just. Thank you.\" Margarete said. \"I...I don't know what I'd do, if it weren't for you. Sometimes, I just wish we'd never broken up. Maybe things would have turned out different.\" \n\nJohn just chuckled. \"No, Margarete. I don't think it would have worked out. Besides, it would break my fianc\u00e9's heart if I broke up with him now.\" \n\nMargarete stared. \"You're...?\" \n\nJohn nodded. \n\nHe blinked, and he was home. His real home - sitting on his bed, fully dressed in the dead of night, his partner breathing softly beside him. He hadn't waited up. \n\nJohn laid down and sighed, staring up at the ceiling. He had thought that the shock might have been enough to send him back, but her expression haunted him. Confusion, disgust...to think, for over a decade they had known each other, and she'd never thought to ask why he left. \n\nHe only wished that he could have done more before he did. \n\n\n***\n\n*Heavy stuff.

We drove 40 minutes, picked her up and from that day on for the next few months she lived with me at my moms. His name? Josh. ",

            "comment": "\u201cYou know, have you ever tried being responsible for your own shit, instead of relying on some witches curse to have me do your laundry?\u201d, Shane snarked at Sandra.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just too convenient.\u201d, she smirked, looking Shane up and down.\u201dBesides, it\u2019s more important than my laundry.\u201d Sandra had gotten into some trouble with some seniors. Sandra and her current boyfriend, Rumio, were the town\u2019s local supply of dope, and less than lethal party drugs; like acid, shrooms, and ecstasy. It was a small town with a poor, small market, and not really many dealers to go to. Even though Sandra and Rumio kept a \u201ccode\u201d to never sell any amount of or any type of drug that they knew would kill a particular person, they never made a code to never skimp their customers.\n\n\u201cWhat, do you need a loan or some shit? Or are you just horny and your boyfriend isn\u2019t around again?\u201d Shane was rather pissed at this point. A day hadn\u2019t gone by that Aphrodite\u2019s curse hadn\u2019t played it\u2019s merciless joke on him. It had been calming down recently, and he figured he might be able to start having a normal life again. Shane was supposed to be at the premiere of a big blockbuster hit, \u201cThe Comedical Advancements of Hubris the Flying Baby\u201d, but in the middle of the previews was sucked back into the grip of Sandra\u2019s hurricane of a life.\n\n\u201cNo, I need somebody that can hold a gun.\u201d Sandra handed over a .22.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this peashooter gonna do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna scare off these jocks we fucked with.\u201d Sandra and Rumio had taken it upon themselves to not only sell a football player a bag of chopped up romaine, but hadn\u2019t even given him the proper gram to dollar ratio. Sandra and Rumio had sold oregano to this kid before, so they figured he would probably still be too stupid to tell the difference. But Kenneth, the fool, had smoked lettuce in his youth after hearing talk through his bedroom door of \u201csmoking the devil\u2019s lettuce.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why should I give a fuck that you pissed some jocks off?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause even if you leave, you\u2019re just gonna come back when they actually show up.\u201d They of course being the entire football team; small town sports teams are essentially packs of hyenas.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t I go get a real weapon, like a chainsaw? Or a steak knife?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re not trying to kill them, we\u2019re trying to get them to fuck off. We don\u2019t need heat all over our shit, man.\u201d Sandra shoved the .22 into Shane\u2019s chest. She stormed off into another room to grab her phone and her baton. While she called Rumio, Shane looked out the window.\n\n\u201cYou got any idea what type of car these kids might roll up in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, probably some busted up piece of shit. Pretty sure Ken\u2019s dad own a Thunderbird.\u201d Rumio picked up, Sandra asked, \u201cHey, where are you, babe?\u201d\n\n\u201cPulling up right now.\u201d Just then a green Thunderbird swerved right into his driveway. Rumio parked quickly, reached for his bat in the back seat, and got out. Five kids exited the Thunderbird, all looking around before a couple charged towards Rumio. Sandra and Shane came leaping off the front porch towards Rumio, trying to distract a couple of the linebackers. Rumio managed to break a kneecap on of the kids, but took an uppercut from his backup. Rumio tried shoving the kid away via tip of bat. It hurt the player\u2019s chest, but he grabbed the bat and swung it to the side.\n\nSandra wasn\u2019t strong, but people didn\u2019t think a baton swing to the ribs wasn\u2019t gonna hurt. Shane had been in a few fights, via Sandra, but still didn\u2019t stand a chance against the neanderthals of the frontline. It wasn\u2019t too soon before Shane pulled out\u2026 Bang! Shane had plucked one of them in the eye, and it started to bleed. They all scattered back to the car before Shane could pull the trigger again.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just gonna come back, you know.\u201d Shane looked at the two of them locked in arms.\n\n\u201cYeah, but at least we got Slickshot Shane to back us up when the rattlesnakes show up.\u201d Sandra smirked at Shane and giggled a bit.\n\nRumi told Shane, \u201cYeah and if you let my girlfriend die, I\u2019ll be sure to send your ass to Aphrodite myself.\u201d Shane rolled his eyes and shoved his way through the lovebirds, and murmured something under his breath, probably something of the usual, \u201cthis curse is bullshit, I\u2019m not even getting laid.\u201d The couple renounced themselves to their abode, only to find Shane in their room.\n\n\u201cI knew you hadn\u2019t done your fucking laundry yet.\u201d",

            "comment": "\u201c\u2026 and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s just not the right thing to do. Sure the penguins are cute, but do we really need them around to survive.\u201d Sarah lectured, sitting across the table from Hector Wellington, a suave, twenty-five year old man, single, trying his very hardest to change that fact.\n\n\u201cOh really? That\u2019s a rather \u2026 unique view on the survival of an entire species.\u201d Hector replied, feeling a bead of sweat trickle down his neck. It looked like Hector had gotten himself into another doozy of a dating situation again.\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Sara said, ecstatic, a big grin on her face and her eyes popping open in pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet someone who understands me. You wouldn\u2019t believe all the weirdos out there who just scoff at my penguin sustainability plan. You see, the thing is \u2026 \u201c\n\nSarah continued to drone on, ranting about this and that, waving her arms and spouting inane conspiracy after inane conspiracy. Hector nodded along, grimacing, as he reached into his pant\u2019s pocket.\n\nUnderneath the table, Hector pulled out his phone, and began to text an old friend for help; a desperate SOS if you will. Around Hector and Sarah, a busy, rather fancy, restaurant hustled and bustled. The soft murmuring of chatter and chewing filled the air, a lovely backdrop for Sarah to drone on and on about how you can reduce carbon emissions by burning penguin carcasses with environmentally friendly coal. Really, it shouldn\u2019t have been any surprise to Hector; Sara\u2019s father was a rather eccentric coal baron after all.\n\nWith thumbs clicking desperately, Hector Wellington sent off a quick message.\n\n\u201c*Help needed. Request rescue immediately.*\u201d Hector gulped, and sent the message.\n\nPocketing his phone, Hector brought his elbows up to the table, and clasped his hands together.\n\n\u201cAnd then the feathers can be used as\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cHeather, please!\u201d Hector exclaimed, cutting Sarah off.\n\n\u201cUm, excuse me?\u201d Sarah asked, a look of disdain and hurt on her face.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry; Brittany. Listen, it\u2019s been fun, but I really need to be going.\u201d Hector said, rising up from the table, his food and drink almost untouched, a bit of a waste, but that was life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sarah.\u201d Sarah replied with ice in her voice.\n\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Hector replied, staring off into space. A smile spread across his lips as the sensation rolled over him. A feeling of urgency, a feeling of lightness, of emptiness, of need, filled Hector\u2019s stomach and mind and chest and body. With an open laugh, Hector ran around the restaurant, enjoying his few moments of freedom, of pure, unchained bliss and unrestricted ability, before he was taken away.\n\n\u201cExcuse me sir, but you can\u2019t \u2026\u201d A waiter scolded, addressing Hector as the man ran around the restaurant.\n\nHector didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t notice. He let out a quick laugh, and closed his eyes as the weightlessness came over him. His world turned black, turned silent, turned unfeeling, as Hector felt his body float up into the air, float up into the sky, float up into the emptiness of nonexistence; a lack of existence.\n\nJust as quickly as it had come, the sensation died down. Hector felt the ground beneath his feet, the air in his lungs, and the breeze on his face. Opening his eyes, Hector looked around him. He was standing on an apartment rooftop, amidst the rising steel, concrete, and glass towers and buildings and monoliths of the city. At the edge of the rooftop, on the precipice of life and death, fall and flight, stood Heather; the woman of Hector\u2019s dreams, or at least, she had used to be.\n\nHeather\u2019s phone was held in her hand, a wedding ring was sitting upon her finger, and a scowl was sitting upon her lips. She hopped down from the edge of the ledge, and stalked over to Hector, noticing the gleeful look on her old lover\u2019s face, and his fancy dress.\n\n\u201cAnd what mess have I gotten you out of this time?\u201d Heather growled, facing Hector.\n\nHector let out a small laugh, a giggle. \u201cProbably the worst date ever. This crazy girl was talking about killing all of the world\u2019s penguins. You wouldn\u2019t believe \u2026 \u201c\n\n\u201cYeah whatever Hector.\u201d Heather interrupted, folding her arms in irritation. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep on abusing Aphrodite\u2019s curse, okay? We\u2019re adults now, we can\u2019t keep on playing these stupid little games with each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cB-but Heather.\u201d Hector replied, a mischievous grin on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be my one and only, forever.\u201d Hector said with mock sincerity, recalling their moment, when they were young lovers, and their confessions to each other. It was on that day, as Hector first conveyed his feelings of love to Heather, that the goddess Aphrodite blessed Heather and Hector to always appear by one\u2019s side in a time of need. That blessing, however, had turned into a curse three weeks later when Heather and Hector had broken up; at the time, the feelings had simply been puppy love, the unknowing of adolescence.\n\nHeather rolled her eyes. \u201cShut up you jerk.\u201d She said with just a hint of a smile, pushing past Hector.\n\nHector watched the first woman he\u2019d ever loved walk past him, towards the door leading to the rooftop. He took a step forward, and raised an arm in the air, his mouth open to speak. Ever since their curse, their blessing, their relationship had endured after all these years. They\u2019d become excellent friends, and despite the bickering, the teasing and joking, they\u2019d become rather close. He\u2019d even been a best man at Heather\u2019s wedding last year.\n\nA tear trickled down Hector\u2019s cheek, and he dropped his arm. The door slammed closed behind Heather, leaving Hector alone on the rooftop. Despite all the joking, all the goofing and false indifference, he couldn\u2019t ignore it much longer. Hector shook his head, and stared off into the skyline of the city. The wind ripped at his clothes, and ruffled his hair. That puppy love, at least for him, had matured into something more; appreciation, dependence, need. Maybe if he had told her earlier, things would have been different. But he\u2019d been too embarrassed, too nervous about what she\u2019d think after all they\u2019d been through, to break the status quo.\n\nAnd now, as Hector stared out across the skyline, and felt empty and lost, just like he always did after seeing Heather wearing her wedding ring, it was too late.\n\n\u201cSo much for Aphrodite\u2019s blessing.\u201d Hector muttered to himself.\n\n------------------------\n\nHope you enjoyed the story!

            "comment": "Laura held the mug in her hand and stared up and in front of her. The first shelf of the cabinet was full of plates and bowls. The second shelf was for glasses, and there may have been a little space. She packed the glasses more closely, eliminating empty space between glasses, effectively transferring it all to one spot. She tried to place her new mug, even pushed, and was rewarded with the sound of ceramic on glass, and glass on glass objects rubbing against each other. She shuddered, felt a rise of annoyance, but quickly calmed herself and sighed. She'd had years of practice of shutting down negative emotions that would lead to a wish that her problem would just magically disappear.\n\nNo worries, there would be somewhere else. She opened up the next cabinet over, but it was full of tupperware and baking dishes. She opened the cabinet under the sink, where the pots and pans were. It could go here. Alone. A solo mug among pots and pans. That was too ridiculous though. You couldn't stick one mug with all the pots and pans. Or could you? No one had to know. She imagined her mother coming over and opening the cabinet, seeing the single mug, and staring at her with a look of....she realized that this was not the right solution. \n\nShe went back over to the cabinet and looked at the top shelf. It was completely empty, but always just a bit out of reach, even though she was a little taller than average. The answer really was pretty simple. She put a knee up on the counter, grabbed the 2nd shelf of the cabinet and awkwardly pulled herself up. She reached up with her other hand to place the mug and was accosted with a vision of herself falling, which she shrugged off, but was quickly followed up with the question of how she was going to get the mug back down when she wanted it, this really wasn't the best solution. She realized she was getting worked up again, and lost her concentration enough that her hand that was stabilizing her by gripping the shelf lost its hold. She lurched her body forward to correct, but then her knee slipped and gravity did the rest. \n\nThe floor was cold, her jaw hurt, her arm had a scrape that was bleeding slightly, and one of the larger remains of the shattered mug lay next to her head. Half of the cartoon whale's face that had been painted on the mug stared at her from the shattered remnants seemed to stare at her asking, \"Why, why didn't you save me?\"\n\nA man knelt down next to her. \n\n\"I was on a date,\" he said in a remarkably flat manner. \n\nHer head was ringing, and had a doctor asked she'd have told him 7 on a 10 point scale for pain, though it was already fading.\n\n\"It hurts,\" she said in an attempt to explain her situation.\n\n\"You're alright, I saw the whole thing, you know I get the whole update when I get transported.\"\n\nHe stood up suddenly, looked in the corner, rolled his eyes, and then walked over to the closet and opened it.\n\n\"You moved your broom.\" He walked back over to her broom in hand. \"Come on, sit up.\" \n\nShe didn't. He put his hand on her shoulder, \"You're alright, you didn't hit your chin that hard on the way down. You sort of slid off. It was pretty comical to be honest.\" \n\n\"You didn't use to be such a dick,\" she muttered as she sat up. \n\n\"Come on,\" he said as he grabbed her hand and gently, but firmly helped her to her feet. He led her around the island to the couch and sat her back down, and then went back to the kitchen without a word. Her jaw was at a 6 now, and the ringing had mostly stopped. She heard sweeping in the kitchen. \n\nFive minutes later he wandered back in with neosporin. He uncapped it. \n\n\"No, I can do that,\" she said. \n\nHe opened his mouth and closed it again, looked annoyed, and handed her the tube. He sat for a second, as she started to apply the neosporin to her scrape, and he got up again, and came back with a glass of water and some advil a few minutes later. \n\nShe swallowed the advil, took a sip, and said, \"I'm sorry about your date.\"\n\n\"I wasn't that interested,\" he said, \"it was really just something to do on a Saturday night. She kept trying to weedle out of me how much I make. 'what do you do, where did you go to school, where do you live down to the neighborhood' those sorts of questions.\"\n\n\"She's just trying to get to know you,\" Laura said.\n\n\"That's a very plausible explanation. One thing I can say for sure is that I was bored,\" he reached into his pocket and pulled out two pieces of the mug and putting them together. \"I like him,\" he said pointing to the reformed whale.\n\n\"Oh yes! He's so cute!\"\n\n\"Favorite mug?\"\n\n\"I just got him today, I didn't even get to use it.\" \n\n\"You've always liked whales.\" He pulled out his phone, \"I went whale watching with my parents a couple of months ago.\" He handed her the phone.\n\n\"Oh a minke!\"\n\n\"Is it? I wasn't really paying attention to the tour guide.\"\n\n\"You can't tell? The dorsal fin, the coloring, the...\"\n\n\"It's a whale.\" Laura glared at him. \"Not that I have anything against whales, I just don't run into them that much.\"\n\nThey sat in silence for a few moments. \"Why am I still here?\"\n\n",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve always loved the very first moments of the day - That time when you\u2019re only half-awake, and the warm softness of sleep is still heavy around your mind. You somehow have the sense that the world has narrowed to just you, and perhaps the vague imitation of reality found in your dreams. I didn\u2019t think that it could get any better\u2026and then I met Leanna.\n\nShe is the brilliant glimpse of a bright blue sky on a mostly rainy day, the pop of color in a completely gray canvas. She is the kindest person I\u2019ve ever known, and filled with more passion than I knew was possible. Waking up next to her is the best feeling in the world, and I\u2019m about to ask her to do that with me every day, for the rest of my life. \n\nSunlight filters through the window onto the bed, gently caressing the smooth curves of her skin. Blonde hair tumbles across her face, and she\u2019s curled up against me, her head nestled on my chest. She sighs deeply and shifts, pressing her face against me. I feel my heartbeat speed up.\n\nTrying hard not to wake her, I disengage one arm from her, and move closer to the bedside table. The box is right where I put it last night, after she\u2019d fallen asleep.\n\n\u201cLeanna?\u201d I don\u2019t want to break this silence, the perfectness of this moment, but I can\u2019t wait anymore. Her eyelids flutter open, and she meets my eyes. A sleepy smile spreads across her face. \n\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d It\u2019s still a treat to hear her say that in person, and to be able to see her face every night as I go to bed. Her smile brightens as she she sees my expression. \u201cWhat is it? Did something happen with work?\u201d\n\nI shake my head. \u201cNo...No, it\u2019s better than that.\u201d I have to pause to collect myself. \u201cLeanna...Ever since I met you, my life has been better than I ever imagined it could be.\u201d Well, better than it\u2019s been since I was fifteen. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine spending my life with anyone but you. You are everything I\u2019ve always wanted. Leanna...Will you --\u201d\n\nShit.\n\nThe familiar sensation of the world being ripped upside down, and turned inside out brought my words to a choking halt. Fuck. I\u2019d thought that it was finally over, that I\u2019d finally been set free. It\u2019s been three years since the last time I saw her. \n\nMy vision goes black, just like it always does.\n\nWhen I open my eyes, there\u2019s just one word that goes through my head.\n\n\u201cSeriously??\u201d\n\n*********************\nPart II\n\nAlthough parts of her have changed - the childish softness of her cheeks, her once athletic build\u2026 her eyes remain the same. As dark as liquid coal, she regards me from under heavy eyelashes, her expression held in a cold pout. She\u2019s alone, this time, which is a blessing. The number of times she\u2019s \u201cneeded\u201d me when surrounded by people has taught me to appreciate the small things.\n\nI want nothing more than to sit up and murder her, but unfortunately, both the jump and the toll it takes on my body, as well as my \u201cbenefactress\u201d (as she calls herself) won\u2019t allow for it. So I settle for clenching my jaw and growling out an obscenity as I sit up. \n\n\u201cEmma...This had better be really fucking good.\u201d I can barely get the words out. \u201cDo you have any idea how bad your timing is this time?\u201d \n\nShe wrinkles her nose and crosses her arms across her chest. \u201cCan\u2019t be any worse than that time--\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you need, Emma?\u201d I have to try - REALLY try - to keep myself from strangling her. \u201cYou\u2019ve brought me here for every single fling that didn\u2019t work out, every bad day at work, every single time your entitled ass needed to be comforted because of some issue your daddy won\u2019t bail you out this time. I\u2019ve fixed all of it. I thought I was finally free. It\u2019s been fourteen years, Emma. This had better be DAMN worth it.\u201d \n\nEmma rolls her eyes and gives me a withering glare. \u201cNot everything is about you, Michael. And anyway, we wouldn\u2019t be here if you hadn\u2019t said what you did all those years ago. What was it? \u2018I\u2019ll be here anytime you need me?\u2019\u201d She fixes me with a smug smile. \u201cYou certainly didn\u2019t specify what kind of need I had to be in, and I told you when you dumped me that I didn\u2019t have any intention of being out of your life.\u201d She lifts her chin and smirks. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how much help I\u2019d have with that.\u201d \n\nI hate her like I\u2019ve never hated anyone before. I hate the way she\u2019s watching me - how she knows that I have no choice but to help her, or risk the wrath of the gods themselves. I hate knowing that it really was my words that put us into this position in the first place. But most of all, I hate that I\u2019ll have to do this for the rest of my life, or hers. I\u2019ll never have a normal life. \n\nI\u2019ll never be able to marry Leanna.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like my voice doesn\u2019t even belong to me, like some ancient part of my brain has finally had enough. I feel like I\u2019m listening to someone else talk as words tumble from my mouth. \n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not doing this again. This is over. It\u2019s been over for fourteen years, and I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not doing this again. I\u2019ve helped you to get over boyfriends that you hated while you were dating them, I\u2019ve been there as every single friend you had left you because of the way you treated them, I\u2019ve been there after every failed one night stand. It\u2019s over, Emma. I\u2019m not doing this anymore! I\u2019m not doing this anymore!\u201d  Somehow, I\u2019m standing, my voice is at a shout, and I\u2019m eye to eye with the most irate ex-girlfriend I\u2019ve ever seen. My breath comes in gasps. I can\u2019t seem to stop shaking. \n\nI half-expect her to murder me right there, but before she can do anything, a familiar sensation begins to fill every part of my body. My stomach twists. My vision goes fuzzy. My head spins violently, and I feel the hard surface of the floor beneath my knees. My stomach heaves. The world goes black.\n\nThe first moment of consciousness I have is as I feel myself falling forward as my stomach tries to empty itself with a dry heave. The next moment is punctuated by an undefined, but an absolute sense of confusion. \n\nWhat the hell?\n\nThis has never happened before. Yes, I\u2019ve gotten used to the insanity of the random leaps across the country, to Emma. And yes, I\u2019ve gotten used to being called multiple times in a day, if somehow, Emma manages to screw up her life more than once in a day. But this? Something was different about this. \n\nMy vision is blurry as I peel my eyelids apart, but even so, it\u2019s immediately obvious that I\u2019m no longer in Emma\u2019s studio apartment. Bright sunlight makes me squint, and the stuffy heat of her apartment has been replaced with a cool, gentle breeze. As my vision returns, I get a glimpse of another person hunched over next to me, throwing up.\n\nEmma. But why? \n\nI stumble to my feet, head reeling, trying not to retch again. \u201cWh\u2026.What the hell is the matter with you?\u201d The breathlessness of my voice takes the bite out of my words. \u201cI was already fucking there! You didn\u2019t have to...to...\u201d My voice trails off as I realize that, in all honesty, I have no idea what Emma can even do, and how much of all of it is her actively doing anything. But why else would we be here? \n\nShe turns to face me, long black hair sticking to sweaty cheeks, practically baring her teeth. \u201cI didn\u2019t do this, you idiot! Do you think I\u2019d do this on purpose?\u201d \n\nI mean...yeah. Emma\u2019s not really the type to self-inflict the torture that is being ripped from one place to another. But if she didn\u2019t do this, then that must mean\u2026.\n\nShiiit. This is either really good\u2026.or reaallllly bad. \n\nThe hair on the back of my neck raises. My hands prickle. Adrenaline pumps through my blood. It\u2019s been fourteen years - fourteen years since we\u2019ve seen her, since she explained what happened. \n\nI turn slowly, unsure what to expect. The same face from all those years ago is regarding me coolly, watching the two of us as we realize what\u2019s happening. I swallow, fighting another, different kind of nausea. \n\n\u201cHello...Aphrodite.\u201d ",

            "comment": "Day 112 - Event 54\n\n\nOver 100 days since I last saw her. Each day there's a brief moment, where I wonder if maybe it's finally over. Maybe I'm finally free. But I've been down this road before. I have to keep reminding myself that it's never going to be over. I'm always going to have to be there for her.\n\n\nDay 1 - Event 55\n\n\nIt happened again last night. It was her ex this time. Lucky bastard. If he knew my life he wouldnt be so angry about her leaving. I left this one on the street, bleeding out under a lamp post. He won't be bothering her again, so he won't be bothering me either. \n\nThese are the best times. The times just after it happens. She's crying, she's scared, but she's with the police, or she's at the hospital, or she's just gone home to her parents. She's tired and hurt, but she's ***safe***. And i can sleep soundly.\n\n\nDay 25 - Event 55\n\nAlmost four weeks now. I'm beginning to worry again. Worry that it might happen. I'm cursed to always be there when she needs me, but that isn't some sort of black and white thing. I can feel it, all the time, pulling me towards her. Pulling me towards my own personal demon. Sometimes my stomach lurches and I know she's stumbled or had a fright, always something sudden that passes before the transition occurs. For those few moments, I can hear her voice, echoing in my head. A snippet of her life as the transition wavers on the edge of culmination. I live in fear of that moment, and I live prepared for it. If I wasn't, I could be pulled to my own demise. \n\nNot that it would matter. We've been down that road already.\n\nDay 1 - Event 56.\n\nSome crackhead got the wrong door today. She was sobbing in the corner of her front room. I threw him out of the window. He's lucky it was the tenth floor, he hit the ground too hard to feel much.\n\nFrom the date, it would appear I went 97 days without an event. I was dead for three weeks this time, before she pulled me back into existence. I posted the diary to my sister for safekeeping before taking a 23rd floor swan dive. Any less and there would be enough to identify my body.\n\nSometimes it's nice just to get a break from the pull. In the dark void of nothingness that lies beyond life, you feel nothing, not even the passage of time. Now I can sleep again.\n\n\nDay 36 - Event 56\n\nSometimes I wonder what will happen when she dies. If I knew certain, I'd put a bullet in her myself. If that first mugger handn't shot me dead, I'd be willing to risk it now. But if Im only alive to be there for her, what happens if she's no longer there? Will I die immediately? Will I get a chance to live my life free of her? Or will I just be pulled to die by her side in whatever disaster befalls her.\n\nDay 1 - Freedom\n\nIt's finally over. She's dead, and it's finally over. I was sitting, reading a book, and I felt it, more suddenly than ever before. A Wednesday morning at 11:24am, in the middle of her work in a nice, safe office. No time to prepare, or think, I was just stood right behind her as she fell. Blood came out of her nose. My doctor told me she had an aneurysm. They told me I rushed to help her, panicked and scared. Once I saw she was lifeless, i was overcome with shock. I began crying and laughing, howling with glee. They had to pin me down and sedate me. When I came around, they told me I was overcome by grief, and I played along until I convinced them to release me.\n\nAfter 35 years, I'm free. No tugging, no fear. Today, Sharon Thomas, died, and I was born again.\n\nDay 156 - Event 57\n\nMy stomach has been growing tense over the past two days. I almost didn't recognise the feeling. Five minutes ago the pain peaked. And I heard it. A whisper.\n\n\"Its so lonely here. You said you'd always be there...\"\n",

            "comment": "\"God dammit. Really?! I JUST paid for the movie.\" Steve had been teleported again. This time, to the side of the highway. He really wished he never made that stupid promise but at least he got to see Sandra every once and a while. He looked around. Sandra and Kendrick were present of course. So was their 11 month old Damien, giggling to himself in his car seat. Their late 90's Saab had a flat tire, but nothing else seemed too out of sorts.\n\nAs always, useless Kendrick waved. Like an idiot. \"Hi Steve!\"\n\nSteve brushed him off with a nod and looked at Sandra. She had dyed her hair red and finally stopped trying to cover the beauty mark under her left eye. With the exception of the scowl on her face, it was a good look for her.\n\nSandra growled out the usual, \"Nice to see you again Steve.\"\n\n\"Hi Sunshine and Midnight.\" It was a race joke, and Sandra absolutely hated it. He leaned into the window at the smiling child, \"Hey Twilight, I missed you buddy. You have gotten thiiiiiiiis big!\" Steve said with a big smile as he made a motion with his arms. He turned back to Sandra. \"Pop the trunk.\"\n\nSteve made his way to the rear of the old wagon and grabbed the spare tire, scissor jack, and wrench. He wondered how hung Kendrick must have been, because he was a waste of air. And space. And life. His entire existence was an inconvenience on everyone, except for Sandra apparently. For the last six years Steve has had to either fix Kendrick's mistakes or fill in as Sandra's handyman. She was not happy about either.\n\nSteve tried to make some small talk while he swapped out the spare, but Sandra was being cold as usual and Kendrick was keeping Damien occupied. When he was done he stood up and turned around. Sandra's usual glare had been replaced by a soft look, her eyes slightly glossy. She noticed Steve's gaze and the glare came back.\n\nA few seconds passed. Steve was standing there awkwardly looking like he had just been slapped and Sandra was looking like she wanted to slap him. \"Thanks Steve.\" It was not spoken warmly.\n\nHe just smiled and closed his eyes. When he opened them again he was back in his apartment. The pay-per-view movie he had just purchased was 15 minutes in so he hadn't missed much. Not that it mattered, he had seen Pulp-Fiction about thirty times.\n\nSteve leaned over and grabbed a slice of pizza. His dog Beach came to beg. \"She's doing well Beach.\" The dog looked up at him, licked his hand, and barked. \"Yeah boy, I'm alright too\" he said with a weak smile. \"I'll be alright anyway. One day.\" He gave Beach a light scratch behind the ears and turned the volume up.",

            "comment": "*It'll be okay,* John thought to himself as he looked over his meeting slides one more time. Glancing up at the clock told him he still had about five minutes left. Today was the \"big day\", the day he presented the results of his six month project to his company's Executive Board for review. His work, his funding and quite possibly his future at this job rested on this meeting and he hadn't slept in three days between preparation, nervousness and, well... the other thing. \n\nJust thinking about it drained the color from his cheeks. He quickly glanced around to ensure he knew where he was. After all, with the blink of an eye, he could-\n\n*Ugh, I really have to go.* He had been holding it in for the past couple of minutes, hoping he could wait until after the meeting. But now... Nature was calling. Insistently. There was a bathroom just off to his right, so he placed his documents on his seat, motioned so that his partner Michael knew here he was going and strolled over. \n\nAs he stepped through the threshold, though, he gaped in horror. He wasn't in a bathroom. He was in an emergency room. It had happened again.\n\n*No... no, no, NO!* he thought, his thoughts racing as he whipped his head left and right. He was in the waiting area, having just walked out of the bathroom door on this side. There were sick people coughing, sneezing, napping or just resting in chairs on the far end of the room and just before him was a desk and two nurses in seats behind it. He rushed forward, both of them focusing on him from whatever conversation he had clearly interrupted.\n\n\"Yeah, hi,\" he started, already wondering how he could get back. He knew how it worked. He was here to do something and he needed to do it and with his meeting looming, he needed to do it fast. \"I'm looking for a Rachel Thompson? She told me she'd be here, is everything okay? Is she okay?\"\n\nThe nurse to his left turned to his computer and started typing. The one on his right turned away as well, but to pick up a phone and started talking in medical jargon that John didn't bother trying to translate. After a moment, the computer-nurse looked up.\n\n\"Ms. Thompson is in room 118 and it looks like she's doing okay,\" he said, his Texan accent reminding John how far he had traveled from Connecticut with this jump. \"However, the Doctor's notes state her boyfriend is the one that brought her in. Can I ask who you are, sir?\"\n\nThere was something about how the nurse spoke that made John nervous. Not for himself, he knew there was nothing anyone could blame him for. Hell, he hadn't been in the same state as Rachel five minutes ago.\n\n\"I'm her-\" *cursed ex-boyfriend from 7 years ago that's trying to move on with his life but can't because some random Goddess that I thought was just a myth makes me pop out of bathroom doors every time she has a problem? Good cover, John.* \"-friend. We went to high school together. Look, you said her boyfriend is with her? Do you mind if I just check on them? You can even escort me back there if you have to, I just want to make sure she's okay.\" *And get the hell out of here. My meeting probably started already!*\n\nThe nurse glanced at his co-worker, who was still on the phone. Shrugging, he got to his feet and leaned over the desk, pointing off to John's right at a pair of double doors.\n\n\"If you go through those two doors, all the way down the hall and make a left, it'll be the fourth room on your right. There's another desk at the end of the hall if you can't find it. Someone should be manning it and you can ask there. Try to be quick, though, okay? I'll buzz you in.\"\n\nJohn nodded his thanks and turned for the door. As he approached, he barely heard the buzzing of the lock coming undone and he pushed through the doors. The other side was your standard hospital hallway. Linoleum floors and doors every few feet where you could see inside and either see empty rooms or curtains drawn for privacy. Stretchers and wheelchairs and medical rolling trays lined the walls between the doorways and the entire place smelled very \"clean\". There was a buzz of noise in the area, from beeping medical devices to the talking and footsteps of people rushing back and forth, trying to keep ahead of the workflow. John reached the end of the hallway and turned. He could see from here that the fourth door was the only one with the light on and kept walking. As he got close, though, he could hear voices.\n\n\"-bet the police are coming, AGAIN,\" said a man's voice with a tone of irritation and a similar Texan accent to the nurse. \"Jees, Rachel, I can't believe you did this again. I swear, I don't know why I put up with this nonsense.\"\n\nJohn stopped in his tracks. That had to be Andy, the boyfriend. The last two times he had jumped states, Andy had given John a bad vibe. He seemed nice enough and smiled when he spoke, but there was something about how close he stood to Rachel... Something about Andy didn't feel right to John. \n\"I-I'm sorry, Andy,\" she stuttered. \"I promise, honey, this is the last time. Don't be mad, okay?\"\n\nA sudden jingling of small metallic items, probably doctor's tools being pushed around a tray made John jump.\n\n\"Don't tell me not to be mad, Rachel!\" Andy snapped. \"I shouldn't have to put up with-\"\n\nJohn took the last few steps to the door and knocked solidly on the frame, leaning around it to peer in. He forced a smile to his lips and tried his best to look innocent.\n\n\"Hey, guys,\" he said, attracting the attention from both Andy and Rachel. Andy was in his usual jeans and a button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up. The tattoos on his arms were clearly visible, but what caught his attention was Rachel's face. She was sitting on the hospital bed with a medical gown on. Her hair had changed colors from John's last jump and was now brown with some light highlights in it, like how she had colored her hair when they were first dating back in high school. It would have made her look pretty if not for the swelling black eye and scrapes along her face and neck. \"Jees, Rachel, what happened to you?\"\n\nJohn couldn't ignore that Rachel's eyes flashed to Andy before replying.\n\n\"I, uh, I fell,\" she said, shrugging as she spoke. \"You know me, John, super clumsy.\"\n\nJohn knew. He knew exactly what had happened, just from that lie. Rachel had never been clumsy in her life. During high school, she had been a dancer and walked more gracefully than anyone he had ever known. His eyes shifted to Andy, who he realized was staring a hole through him. He felt his right hand ball into a fist and saw Andy's eyes catch the motion.\n\n\"What are you even doing here, John? How did you know we were here?\" he asked, slowly turning his body to face John. Through gritting teeth, John responded.\n\n\"Hospital called me. Rachel must have forgotten to change her emergency contact. Hey Andy, want to grab a coffee with me real fast?\" Andy's eyes narrowed even more, but he gave a quick nod in response. Glancing at Rachel, he squeezed her shoulder as he stepped away and John couldn't help but noticed her flinch.\n\n*This piece of-,* John started, but couldn't finish his thought from the pounding in his temples. He felt his blood rushing faster and faster, his temperature rising. As Andy got close, John moved in a flash to grab him by the shirt and twisted, dragging the man around with him and shoving him out the door. Andy stumbled into the hallway and landed with his back against the opposite wall. Instantly, John was pushing his forearm against Andy's throat, cutting off his air supply. He leaned his face close and spoke through a clenched jaw.\n\n\"Listen to me, dirtbag, if you ever, and I mean *ever* come near Rachel again, I swear to God, I will know, I will be there and I will personally end you. *Do you understand me?*\" Andy's eyes shot left and right. People had heard the noise of the two men and were coming out of rooms and around the desk from the corner John had passed to get to Rachel's room. Behind him, John could hear Rachel sobbing softly and the sound only made it harder to keep himself from putting Andy's teeth down his own throat with some assistance from his fist. \n\nRealizing that no one was coming to his aid, Andy looked back at John, his eyes wide. He nodded his head, wheezing for breath and John released him from the wall. Turning his back on the man, he walked into Rachel's room, softly closing the door. She looked up at him, tears streaming from her eyes.\n\n\"I am so sorry, John,\" she started. He walked over to the bed and sat on the edge, slipping his hand into hers. He felt the cuts and bruises on her fingers. She had tried to defend herself. \"I swear, I never wanted to pull you away. I tried so hard to keep calm, I thought that if I didn't freak out, you wouldn't come and-\"\n\n\"Shhh, it's okay Rachel,\" John said quietly. He was reminded how beautiful her eyes were. The sky blue color had always been his favorite part of looking at Rachel. \"I'm glad I came. Really, I would have wanted to be here if I didn't jump.\"\n\nRachel let out a sob and leaned forward, her head against John's chest. His free hand gently stroked her hair as he continued to quietly hush her. After a few seconds, he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket and pulled it out without moving her. It was from Michael, his partner back in Connecticut.\n\n*Are you okay in the bathroom? I had to do the presentation without you, we got the funding for next year! First round's on you, man! Meet me back downstairs, okay?*\n\nJohn smiled. He had wanted to be the one to represent his work after all this time, but he realized he had been at the right place at the right time. A soft chuckle made Rachel look up at him and then, realizing he had his phone out, she frowned.\n\n\"Is everything okay? Did this keep you from something important?\" she asked.\n\nAgain, John looked her in the eye as he responded.\n\n\"Don't worry, Rachel. I'm exactly where I needed to be. Everything is going to be fine, just like I promised you. I'm right here for you.\"\n",

            "comment": "The tips of my fingers began to tingle.\n\n*For fucks sake.*\n\nI rolled my eyes and cursed under my breath then turned to meet my wife\u2019s gaze.\n\n\u201c\u2026which is great but it\u2019s his English results that I\u2019m worried-\u201c\n\nMy well-rehearsed apology face had cut her off.  She scrunched up her lips and drew in a breath then gave a less than half-hearted attempt at a reassuring smile.\n\n\u201cGot your phone?\u201d\n\nI gave my jeans a pat and recognised the familiar brick in my right front pocket despite the, now significant, tingling in my hands.\n\n\u201cYeh\u201d\n\n\u201cK.  Call me if you need me to finish cooking dinner,\u201d she offered as she turned and headed down the hall.\n\n\u201cGod forbid,\u201d I muttered.\n\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d  She lazily threw up a finger as she disappeared into the living room.\n\nI gave my outfit a once over to make sure that I was presentable and then waited for the usual drill to-\n\n\u201cShit!  The drill!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaaa-?\u201c She queried from the living room, softened by a mouthful of funions.\n\n\u201cNothing!\u201d\n\nI cautiously made my way down the hall.  The tingling in my feet had become a numbness and they felt heavy and unresponsive.  Pushing through the back door, I aided myself down the steps with the handrail.  I noticed a whiteness in my knuckles and attempted to loosen my grip but overestimated and stumbled down the last two steps.\n\n*Son of a-*\n\n\u201cYou ogay, \u2018aby?\u201d Pringles this time.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I lied, rising to my feet.\n\nAs I waddled my way to the shed the hum began, then rapidly escalated to a low rumble.  I rounded the door to the shed, quickly scanned the mess before me and found the drill on the bench next to the door.  I reached for it too late.  The rumble crescendoed in an instant and I screwed my face up in anticipation of the snap.  I think my wife may have called out but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n\n   ---\n\n\nAs the hissing subsided I began to make out her words.  Yelling.\n\n\u201c\u2026EIGHT WEEKS AGO BUT YOU NEVER FUCKING LISTEN TO M- oh come the fuck on.\u201d\n\nThrough squinted eyes I saw Liz standing six feet in front of me in her kitchen, her husband, Paul, leaning sheepishly on the bench across the room from her.  She had noticed my arrival and now stood with hunched shoulders, one hand on her chest, the other on her forehead.  I was used to seeing her frustrated.  I could barely remember her as anything else.\n\n\u201cI fucking TRIED, ok?\u201d  She turned her head to me but the comment was meant for Paul.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon hon,\u201d he reassured her, raising his hand to cut her off and walking across the room towards her.  \u201cIt's not your fau-\u201d\n\nShe brushed his hand aside and stormed upstairs.  I made an effort to look away as a very defeated Paul watched her stomp out of sight before he turned to me and shrugged.  I tried to return the sentiment but felt that I\u2019d mimicked him a little closely and looked away awkwardly.\n\n\u201cOh! Uh\u2026 Dude?\u201d Paul looked at me expectantly.  I returned a puzzled expression which prompted him to make a drilling action with his right hand.  This was the fourth occasion that I'd seen Paul since he had asked me if he could borrow my hammer drill.\n\n\u201cOh! Fuck! Yeah I- man, this time I swear it was like\u2026\u201d I motioned the approximately foot-wide span with which I had missed the drill back at my shed.\n\n\u201cUh-huh.  That\u2019s what she said, buddy.\u201d  He seemed proud of himself.\n\n\u201cOh, Liz been talking about me again?\u201d\nCircumstance had since lowered any boundaries between our two families when it came to humour.\n\n\u201cOoooh, ok.  Ok, I see.  Can I interest you in a whole bag of dicks?\u201d  He accentuated the delivery with a handful of his junk.\n\n\u201cA whole- dude\u2026 A bag?  Like a whole\u2026 I mean you know you need to get that looked at, right?  I\u2019ve got this great person\u2026 plenty of experience checking out mine.  Let me see if I can remember the name of- oh yeah!  Your wife.\u201d\n\nPaul laughed.\n\n\u201cJust bring the fucking drill next time!  I mean I guess at least it wasn\u2019t toilet paper this time, eh?\u201d\n\nPaul would never allow me to forget the occasion that I had fallen asleep on the throne at three in the morning and appeared in his walk-in wardrobe, sitting on the wash basket with a toilet roll in hand when Liz had thought that she had seen a spider.\n\n\u201cNeed a lift?\u201d Paul offered.\n\n\u201cNah, thanks.  I\u2019m good,\u201d I lied.  My wife had long since given up offering me rides home.  She knows that I want to do everything that I can to lessen the burden.  \u201cJust tell Liz to keep positive, be confident, in control\u2026 you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, man.\u201d  He closed his eyes and nodded.  \u201cShe knows.\u201d\n\n\n   ---\n\n\nThe street lights came on as I rounded the final corner towards my house.  The walk rarely bothered me.  There was the occasional early (and I do mean early) morning or times when it was an annoyance to be pulled from my current task but it was only five or so blocks, one of which was through a park.  There had been opportunities to move even closer, but nowhere good for the kids.  That, and I don\u2019t want to be any closer than I absolutely have to be.\n\nThe smell of burning organic matter hit me as soon as I\u2019d opened the front door.  I entered the kitchen and managed to stifle a giggle as I discovered my wife leaning over a pot on the stove with a spoon raised to her lips, face pursed in disgust.  She noticed me and dropped the spoon into the pot, replacing the lid and brandishing the tea towel, with which she had held the lid, over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cNo!  Don\u2019t you fucking start!\u201c  A smile betrayed her.\n\n\u201cUh huh?\u201d  My own smile was rewarded with a tea towel to the face.\n\n\u201cIf you want me to cook normal people food like a normal peoples then you can go out and work all day, Mister!\u201d  Her pout made the delivery childlike and playful.  She has a habit of using the voice when she\u2019s feeling bratty and it kills me.  Every time.\n\nI tossed the tea towel on the bench and embraced my wife.  I placed my hands on her cheeks and squeezed until her lips were smooshed together and lightly shook her head while giving her the crazy eyes.\n\n\u201cI fucking love you so.  Damn.  Much.  You know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAwiite, awright, jesus big guy\u2026 No need to get all silence of the lambs,\u201d she teased as she fought my hands away.  I put a hand around her waist to pull her closer but my dubious intentions were put to rest when our son entered the kitchen and, without looking up, headed to the fridge and opened the door, surveying its contents.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d\n\nI lifted the spoon from the pot, tasted the bitter liquid, and made a disgusted face at my wife.  She poked out her tongue and I bit the air in front of her.  She faked an expression of shock then bit me on the chin.\n\n\u201cOuch!  Shi- uh\u2026 Vers.  Shivers.\u201d  I turned to our son.  \u201cI dunno buddy, what do you feel like?\u201d\n\n\u201cUmmmm,\u201d he closed the fridge door.  \u201cPizza?  Can we go to Rocco\u2019s?\u201d\n\nI considered the state in which I\u2019d left Liz and gave my wife a discouraging look.  She smiled and gave me a nod.\n\n\u201cHow about we go pick some up.  Dad can stay home so you can ride up front.\u201d\n\n\u201cK.\u201d  My son raced off down the hallway.\n\n\u201cOh did you grab the dish?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI asked you- oh never mind.\u201d\n\nMy wife smiled, kissed me, and turned toward the door.  I gave her a pat on the bum and watched her leave.\n\n*I fucking adore that woman*",

            "comment": "The main problem with our situation was plane ticket prices. \n\nSee, like most wannabe indie girls, I had always wanted to travel after college. Live in summertime for a couple years, write a poem in every continent, cheesy stuff like that. I wanted to meet all kinds of different people. I wanted to visit cat cafes, which New York was severely lacking. I guess\u2026 I guess I also wanted to see just how far the strange godly bond between my ex-girlfriend and I could stretch. Maybe if I moved across the ocean, I told myself, then I wouldn\u2019t have this problem anymore.\n\nAs it turned out, the godly bond stretched at least from New York to Spain. It also stretched from New York to Israel, and to Panama, and to Shanghai. No matter where I went, whenever my ex needed me (the definition of need was *definitely* subjective here), I would be godly transported right to her side. Aphrodite doesn\u2019t play around, not even if you were only 15 and mostly joking when you told her you\u2019d always be there when she was in trouble.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m getting off track. The plane tickets. The plane tickets were what really made the whole thing hell, because although Aphrodite had the goodness in her heart to teleport me places, she never quite found the time to teleport me back. And although Addie always offered to split the ticket price, I never took her up on it. Would\u2019ve felt like stealing. After all, it was my dumb ass who got us into this mess.\n\nItaly was something new. After a couple weeks in Egypt I figured I\u2019d turn back to Eastern Europe. I\u2019d taken a red-eye, rented a car and driven to the motel I\u2019d rented in Florence. Just as I finished unpacking my suitcase, I felt the first tugging sensations in my stomach. *God damn it.*\n\nI scrambled to grab a hold of my Epi-Pen and my phone. Generally, everything that was touching my skin got transported along with me, wherever I was going. Back in college, we\u2019d tried to use it to smuggle drugs but I guess Aphrodite didn\u2019t approve of that sort of thing. \n\nThe room spun. I squeezed my eyes shut, crouching, bending my head down until my forehead pressed against my knees. Don\u2019t throw up, I told myself. Don\u2019t throw up.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been teleported by a goddess, then you know how the middle part feels. If you haven\u2019t, there isn\u2019t much use trying to explain it to you.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was standing on the edge of a highway. Black asphalt bled into a stretch of grass dotted with wildflowers. Beyond that I could see a forest. It was spring, a 60 degree day, and my stomach was about ready to reject everything I\u2019d eaten in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about you,\u201d a voice called. \n\nI turned around.\n\nAddie was sitting crisscrossed on the trunk of her silver Mini Cooper, cheerful as ever. She wore a pair of faded overalls and scuffed up sneakers. I hadn\u2019t seen her in a couple weeks, but she looked healthy, brown skin almost glowing in the sunlight.\n\nOf course we met like this. Her, looking like some kind of goddess, and me, fresh off a two hour car ride preceded by a three hour flight preceded by five hours of delays at the airport. \u201cHi,\u201d I said, waving my hand with the Epi-Pen. \u201cCar troubles?\u201d\n\nAddie nodded. \u201cDid I wake you up?\u201d Her eyebrows scrunched together in concern.\n\nI shook my head, rubbing at my eyes a little. \u201cAnother ten minutes and you might have, though,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zoey.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You know, at least you didn\u2019t catch me on the plane. Again.\u201d\n\nAddie laughed. Her laugh was best when you caught her off guard. \u201cYeah, yeah. Fix my car, Miss Mechanic.\u201d\n\nI had to pop the hood of the car, then, before I did something stupid. \n\nI mean, it wasn\u2019t like we were out of the question or anything. We\u2019d dated for a couple weeks in tenth grade, unanimously decided that we weren\u2019t quite ready to come out to any parents yet and put the whole thing on hold. Of course, then we\u2019d gone off to different colleges and Addie had gotten a new girlfriend and that was the end of that. The only reason my weak romantic heart still held out hope was because after ten years and two other girlfriends, I\u2019d been the only one to stay.\n\nMy *staying* might have been entirely the fault of some vicarious goddess, but the point still stood.\n\n\u201cYou awake down there?\u201d Addie called, from the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nI snapped to awareness. \u201cI cleaned your spark plugs,\u201d I told her. \u201cTry starting it now.\u201d\n\nShe pressed the key into the ignition, and the car hummed to life. \u201cYou are a *goddess*,\u201d she cheered.\n\n\u201cYou must be thinking of the crazy one up there,\u201d I said, pointing up towards the sky.\n\nAddie leaned out of the car window. She smiled at me, a slow, sweet thing. It made her look fifteen again. \u201cIf you have time, I\u2019ve just downloaded all of Firefly onto my computer.\u201d\n\nI swallowed. \u201cThanks, but I should probably be heading back to Italy.\u201d I couldn\u2019t manage to meet her eyes.\n\n\u201cZoey,\u201d Addie said.\n\nI looked at her, really looked at her. She was making her puppy dog face, the one she used to use in middle school to get me to bake cookies with her, or to let her braid my hair. I\u2019d gotten much better at saying no to her these days, and considered refusing, but. She really did look like she wanted me to stay.\n\nWell, maybe there was hope for my weak romantic heart yet. \n\n\u201cI have one condition,\u201d I said. \u201cNo country music.\u201d\n\nAddie grinned. \u201cFine, you big buzzkill.\u201d\n\nSo I got in the passenger seat of her silver Mini, car grease and fuzzy pajama pants and all. There was a moment of silence before Addie turned on the radio, and maybe I was imagining things but I\u2019m pretty sure that somewhere very high up, a vicarious old lady was godly laughing.",

            "comment": "Aphrodite sat with tented fingers, leaning over her magic Pool of Viewing. She cast her gaze into the mortal realm, chuckling as her focus settled on a hapless subject. It  was time for the show to begin, time for her blessings to once again fall on the lucky, lucky couple known as Craig and Lindsey. Once, when they had been deliriously in love they had been recognized by the encompassing title of \"Craigsley\", but that had been a decade past. Things certainly were different now.\n\nCraig was oblivious to the fact he was being watched. Somewhere, deep down, perhaps he acknowledged the fact that he was always in the Goddess's view, even if he wasn't always the center of her attention. Most of the time, though, it seemed as if he had forgotten the sacred vow whispered in Lindsey's ear during that summer they had both spent a vacation in Rome. The corner of Aphrodite's perfect pouty mouth twitched in disapproval as he wiped a booger on the leg of his jeans. It was one of his more annoying habits. No wonder Lindsey had dumped him.\n\nCraig walked around the corner of a brick building and suddenly realized he was no longer in his own city, or even in his own state. The look on his face was priceless, just like always. Aphrodite clapped her hands and sniffed back a tear of laughter. With a gusty release of breath she continued watching as Lindsey exited a storefront, talking on her phone and unaware of Craig standing but a few feet from her.\n\nThe crash as they came together was satisfying. Aphrodite did not hold back her laughter as the two mortals fell to the ground in a tangle of awkward limbs and Lindsey's enormous purse.  Many items were scattered, the two humans scrambling to contain the spill until the inevitable moment their eyes met and recognition was achieved.\n\nLindsey spent quite a few moments trying to contain her rage and frustration. She had been through this before. Craig had suddenly shown up in her life, with no explanation, on so many occasions. They had been through years of these meetings and at one point she had taken out restraining orders on him, fearing he was actually stalking her.\n\n\"Did you say the words?\" Craig's attitude was icy. Getting home would be inconvenient at best and expensive at worst.\n\nLindsey thought for a moment, about her phone conversation. Had she said them? Those almost forbidden words that triggered the appearance of Craig?\n\n\"I just said...was saying that I...oh. I guess I did say I needed an...aspirin.\" Lindsey withered under Craig's hostile stare, knowing she had slipped up over something trivial. \n\nAphrodite waved a perfectly manicured fingernail and an aspirin bottle appeared in Craig's coat pocket. He pulled the bottle forth and offered her the medication without surprise. These small miracles had become part of the encounters, both humans had chosen long ago to simply stop questioning or rationalizing them.\n\n\"Well, thanks.\" Lindsey shook the aspirin bottle and gave Craig an ingratiating smile. She began shuffling on the pavement, an embarrassed attempt to end the encounter as quickly as possible. \"Sorry. About all of this.\" Waving her hand to encompass everything, Lindsey began backing away. \"Sorry,\" she repeated, then turned and quickly strode up the sidewalk, into a stream of pedestrians and out of Craig's sight.\n\nCraig stood stewing in his misfortune. There was no point in calling after her, no point in asking for her help. It was not her part to be a helper, it was his. The little miracles that ensured Lindsey would always have what was needed never applied to Craig. Summoning the exercises for inner peace taught to him by his therapist, Craig tried to deal with his simmering anger, turning the negative thoughts into constructive ones. As constructive as possible, anyway, given his circumstances. He went over his emergency plan, the one carefully developed over the years of his sudden appearances to answer Lindsey's need. He knew what to do, just resented having to do it.\n\nGrinding his teeth, Craig did his best to concentrate on getting home. The anger was difficult to push away, the unfairness of it all bubbling up. He hated Lindsey now, her lifestyle choices had ruined the beauty that had once entranced him, had once caused him to romantically declare that she, among mortal women, could rival the beauty of Aphrodite. Fool that he was, he had sworn to be at her side should she need him. Fool that he was, his life was now linked to her beck and call.\n\nAphrodite tented her fingers once again, leaning back in her sumptuous throne to savor the man's pain. This was what she had waited for. The bittersweet regret, the true remorse. How dare he speak those words of comparison? No one could rival her beauty, she would make sure of that.\n\n",

            "comment": "The very first time it happened, I was brushing my teeth before bed. Toothpaste isn't the best thing to have in your mouth when you transport; I learned that straightaway. I should have been more concerned with why I had been brushing my teeth in my bathroom one minute and the next standing in my first girlfriend's bedroom, where she was struggling to finish her math homework. Instead I wondered what the side effects of swallowing too much toothpaste were. \n\nFrom the second time it happened, I learned several very important things: to never be doing something for very long, never drive anywhere, don't cook on stoves. Things like that. I found reading books was the best activity to indulge in, as I don't think a falling book has ever killed anyone. Every time I transported, my girlfriend learned something new about me (Though I thought it seemed rather unfair since every time I transported, I was midway through an activity, and without the context of said activity, I wound up looking like a psychopath. Transporting to her family dinner soaking wet and naked sure does kill the mood) but the more she learned about me, the more disinterested she seemed, and after three weeks of being transported to her side, she dumped me. Much to our surprise, for the first day at least, I would leave her and walk out the door, only to immediately be transported back to her side. That first day was pretty awkward.\n\nBy the third week, I learned that I have a sailor's mouth. Upon transporting, I was hardly capable of anything more than an obscenity, which really got weird on Sunday mornings when a transporting teenager appears in church and screams the F-word. \n\nWe've gone years now living like this, with me popping in and out of her life unexpectedly. We've become friends of a sort. There's really no other choice. We see each other every day for ten minutes or so. I show up, and with a simple nod, we work out whatever she needs doing. It somehow works for us. She told me the other day that she sometimes creates situations to bring me to her, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. \n\nAnyway, here I am. Ten years later. I know it sounds so incredibly unbelievable, but it's all true. I feel like it is a super power, but a really boring one. Really only useful to one person. That's life though, at least for me. I long for the day when I can wake up and not be called away right when I'm busy doing someth",

When I read the prompt, I wanted to put a different spin on it, it's a tragic sort of love story, the way it usually is in life, so towards the end I delve into a darker place than was probably intended by the person who created the prompt. I don't mean to offend anyone and hope that you enjoy the story despite the direction it goes in.]\n\n\n\n\nMy legs felt numb. I had been walking for an hour straight now and I wasn't even halfway back to my job. It probably would've been faster to head to Nate's and have him give me a ride back but the thought of having to make up an excuse for my complicated situation, yet again, exhausted me. I was emotionally drained, just like every other time and it only seemed to be getting more frequent. It was getting to the point where I couldn't even go a few days without having to be in this situation yet again.\nI didn't have any idea how far I had walked. You would think after ten years of this, I would've gotten used to it. Not. \nIn High School, I had been some lanky kid desperate for any girl to give me a chance. Sitting down, I thought back to those days, when I had scoured the internet for tips and tricks to get the girl. A humorless smile formed on my lips as  I pictured my younger self sitting in his room performing a prayer ritual to Aphrodite, the Goddess of love. I had promised to be by the side of any girl that gave me the time of day whenever she was in need forever and always. Had I known what was to come, I would've never committed to a lifetime of this. The smile slowly disappeared from my face at that thought. \nAmber came into my life that very next day. She was radiant. There was a light in her that I had never seen in anyone else. When she spoke to me the very first time I thought I was surely dreaming. Her wide, light brown eyes were full of mischief. Her thick golden brown curls gleamed brightly in the sunlight. Her personality was brilliant and fierce and gentle and passionate. I had never seen the world, not really, until I met her. The thing about being a kid, is that everything that you feel is more intense than it will ever be at any other point in your life. She was a destructive storm and I was a storm chaser that was swept away by the force of her. It wasn't long before I fell head over heels for her and finally built up the courage to ask her to be my girlfriend. In my fifteen years of life, I had never felt as happy as I felt during that time that we spent together but I would be insane to say that I hadn't noticed the sadness that lay behind it all. With that passion and whirlwind of emotions, came an endless well of darkness that was slowly extinguishing the light that I had come to know. \nOnly months later she had asked me to a park where we had met many times. It was there that she had explained that she couldn't keep it up anymore. The entire time she had refused to look me in the eye as she confessed that she had cheated on me. That day I learned that with every immense high there is a seemingly endless low. We stopped talking for a while. It hadn't been hard to avoid her since we hardly had any classes together, at first anyway. I could only keep that up for so long though. I felt myself drawn to her despite the burning anger and pain that being by her side brought me. After some time the hurt of her betrayal faded but she was spiraling and that caused a different hurt altogether. I did everything in my power to comfort her. I wanted to. Doing that fulfilled something inside of me that I hadn't even realized forming. It morphed and changed within me until it was an instinct. Borderline obsession even. It wasn't until years later when I would link my incessant need to be at her side every time she needed someone to the night that I had begged Aphrodite for a chance at the love I had always craved. \nEventually, heading to her house on impulse became dropping everything in a moments notice at her call. That evolved into racing to her side no matter how far she was from me. The stranger things started only a year or two ago. The first time it happened, I was sure that I had completely lost my ever loving mind. I had been in the middle of helping a friend move and in the time it took me to blink, I was in Amber's one bedroom apartment. \nA vibrating in my chest pulled me from the memories of everything that had happened in the past ten years. It was soft at first, barely there. It always was but then it grew into an increasingly louder hum. I closed my eyes, the familiar feeling of weightlessness taking over me. I didn't dare look, it had yielded unsavory results the one time I had tried. The process took an instant but it felt like it lasted at least five minutes. The familiar smell of lavender filled my nostrils signalling that I had been transported back into Amber's apartment. I was standing in her bedroom this time. It was a mess like it had been when I had been here earlier that day. There were stains on the carpet that were probably months old, some were maybe even years old. My instincts led me into the small bathroom that was connected to the bedroom. The door was ajar and the light was on indicating that Amber was in there. When I entered, my eyes found Amber's small form curled up between the sink and the bathtub. Her eyes were closed and the only sound in the room besides my shoes crunching the broken glass on the floor, was her ragged breathe coming in soft wisps. There were pill bottles lying all over the floor empty. I moved slowly over to where she was and slid to the ground, leaning back against the wall across from her. She stirred and her eyes fluttered open. Her thick eyelashes framed her almond-shaped eyes in a way that I had always admired but there were dark circles under them from nights that she had spent battling her inner demons while I held her. \n\n\"Jake..\" Her full lips formed a weak smile. \n\nI didn't speak, just stared at her. I was afraid that if I did, I would lose the last shred of sanity I had left for tonight. In this moment, I felt older than I was. At twenty-five I should be thinking about the family that I would be starting but this broken girl in front of me had consumed my every waking moment for a decade now. There had been times when I had hated her for it but had known deep down that I could never truly hate her. Some small part of me would always love her. It was the depression she had struggled with all her life that  I truly hated. Despite my advice and offers, she had decided repress it with drugs and sex than with actual medical help. She had in a way sealed our fates. \nHer arms trembled as she tried to prop herself up which is when I noticed the open wounds on her wrists. I slid my way across the floor so that I was closer to where she was now. \n\n\"I'm so sorry, Jake. I just can't do it anymore.\" She sounded tired. The light in her eyes had dimmed to almost nothing now as she searched mine for something. \n\n\"I know, Amber. I love you.\" I said back softly. \n\nShe seemed satisfied and leaned back, closing her eyes once more. Her breathing continued to slow as time wore on. For the first time in a long time, I felt a calmness sweep through me unlike any I had ever felt before. I almost didn't recognize it when it happened. Amber had lost a lot of blood today and even though I was no doctor, I knew that the lack of blood mixed with all of the pills she was sure to have downed just before I got here were going to be too much this time. It was almost as if I could feel it within myself. I don't know how long it took for her breathing to stop but the instant it did, I could feel my heart start to slow. It didn't hurt like I thought it would but the prospect of what came after was still mildly terrifying, especially with how long it was taking. As my chest clenched with the finality of my last handful of breaths, my eyes landed on her. She would be the last thing I saw and even though I had never really believed in anything after death, I knew that wherever she went I was going to follow. Even now, pale and fragile, she was as beautiful as she had ever been and I knew that my last words to her had been absolutely true. ",

            "comment": "A young man stands in front of a crowded board room his presentation is impeccable.  He's worked his way up from intern to junior exec, and it's taken years of late nights to get him to this point. His smart blue suit only slightly lighter than the others in the room, his tie a perfect accent piece to his pocket square which sets off his wire frame glasses.  The young man continues his well rehearsed diatribe, \"You'll see in the graph here that...\" A cloud of smoke envelopes him and then dissipates leaving the rest of the attendees in awe. \n\nAcross the country on a small studio lot just outside of Los Angeles a woman sits on a curb eating a sandwich when smoke begins to materialize, the young man appears before her eyes in a brilliant shimmer of folded space which looks as if someone smeared the background.  \n\n\"Oh  *you're*  here.\" The young woman remarks. \n\nHe turns around investigating his new surroundings before looking down at the girl, \"Jesus Christ Keri, what the hell do you want?\" \n\n\"Well I didn't want *you* .\" She answers before discarding the food on the ground. \n\n\"Uh, yeah Keri, that's how this works.  Remember? In perhaps the most regretful phrase I've ever uttered in my life, I pledged to always be there for you.  Then a skank in pink heart print dress appeared and said 'So it shall be, always.' So now when you want me, and only me I fucking appear wherever you are.  I was only fifteen how the hell is that binding?!?\" \n\nThe woman shrugged and said, \"Well as long as you're here, the studio says they'll give me a line if I show my breasts in the movie.  Should I do it?\" \n\n\"Yes, of course you should,\" The young man replied.  As soon as Keri's back was turned he began to give her the finger with both hands.\n\n\"You really think I should? Don't you think that could hurt  my career? I want to be thought of as a serious actress...\" She turned around suddenly to see both of his middle fingers outstretched in an aggressive, and angry way. \"Brad... god damn it, I'm serious.\" \n\n\"I don't give a flying red headed fuck what you do, the perpetually pink bitch made it so I have to be here, she didn't make me feel the need to be helpful.  Your tits have been all over the internet for years.  Remember when we broke up and you got on Girls Gone Wild? Yeah so there isn't a pervy old man in America who hasn't spanked it to your underage, and until verrrry recently undersized chest; by the way tell your doctor I love his work, and leave me the fuck alone!\" \n\nShe smiled at him, \"You're jealous, I'm here shooting a film with the guy who played on Renegade and you're stuck in your little cubicle back home. Why can't you just be happy for me you piece of shit?\" \n\n\"I was in the middle of a meeting that would have made me a partner.  I have a girl I'm crazy about, and she puts up with this popping back and forth thing for god knows why, and I'm jealous?\"\n\nThe two screaming at each other drew the ire of the director who then stormed over to the pair, \"Who are you?\" He demanded. \n\nBrad sighed and said, \"I'm Brad her ex boyfriend.\" \n\nThe director threw out his hands with his palms raised, \"Do you work here?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\nHe turned his attention to the young woman, \"And you, who the hell are you?\" \n\n\"um... I'm Keri. I play Sorority slasher victim 2.\" \n\n\"Not anymore, you're fired.  Steven, get me casting, I need another big breasted bimbo to show her tits in this piece of shit.  Let's go, we're moving on.\" \n\nKeri stood there her mouth agape, then she turned to look at Brad who's lips had begun to curl upwards at the corners, \"You... this is all your fault. Fix it, fix it now.\" \n\nBrad broke out into a bright white smile as karma finally caught up with Keri.  He did his best to snap his lips closed but the joy was just so overwhelming he broke into a slight laugh as he said, \"Why? Remember I don't have to help, I just have to be there for you.\" \n\n\"Well how are you going to like it if I suddenly need a towel boy at 2:AM your time for the foreseeable future after I swipe right on every guy in LA? Fix this now.\" \n\nBrad visibly gulped and said, \"Excuse me Mr. Director...\" ",

            "comment": "Theme Music: to U by Jack U\n\n\nThe phone clicked dead; Amy\u2019s final words echoed in Sebastian\u2019s mind like the ripples from a water drop. She had every right to want to end things \u2013 his disappearances, while random were a constant sore spot between them. What was he up to? Why couldn\u2019t he talk about it? And why did it always happen when his ex was having trouble in her relationship? It drove Sebastian to frustration each time. Even now, he struggled to maintain his composure. Why the fuck did it have to happen to him? \n\n\nIt was a fucking curse. It had to be. When Sebastian was 15, he had promised his then girlfriend Lucy that he would always be there for her if she needed him which she reciprocated. It was a stupid promise, but then it felt right. They were young and in love in the only way that young lovers could be, promising each other the world. But it didn\u2019t last, it never could at that age. But somehow, someone had heard them and noted.  \n\n\nThe first time it happened was when he was 21. They had both long since moved on, Sebastian to a string of casual lovers and Lucy to her first serious boyfriend. They had apparently been dating for two years when Lucy was contacted by a stranger. Apparently her boyfriend had broken up with her out of the blue via text, leaving Lucy heartbroken. He had been cooking dinner at the time when there was a flash and suddenly he was standing before Lucy who was laying on her bed crying. He had held her hand all night then slipped out in the morning when she finally feel asleep and walked two hours to get back home. \n\n\nHe thought it was weird but considered it a one off, some bizarre phenomenon. But it happened again, almost two years later, this time to him. He had been going through a rough time, getting strung alone by a girl who he thought felt the same about him. When he finally worked up the nerve to confront her about it she laughed him off then disappeared the next day. After half a bottle of scotch he finally broke down, tears erupting from eyes like a fountain. Yet before they had managed to reach his chin she was there, bringing him into her arms and whispering sympathy in his ear. She was gone by morning too, a ghost from a past he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to be a part of. From there it went downhill, the occurrences happening more and more frequently, appearing in front of the other during moments of sadness or need.  \n\n\nIt took a toll on the both of them, each time a highly charged emotional moment where the other was a sudden intruder. Almost a year ago Lucy had enough. She started screaming when he appeared; that her grief was her own and not for him, and if he could just please leave her alone. He had left the house in a black cloud; it wasn\u2019t his choice, he didn\u2019t want this, this burden. He had heard later that she had moved across the States to LA, as if somehow the distance could prevent the occurrences from happening.  \n\n\nAnd for a while he thought it did. He met Amy and felt the pull that finally, he had met someone he could love. The visitations to Lucy no longer happened and he let his guard down. For almost three years, he felt like he was free. But little over a month ago, it started happening again. One moment he was jogging with his dog then flash and he\u2019s suddenly standing in front of Lucy in the middle of what looked like her living room. She was teary-eyed and upon meeting his eyes only shook her head and looked out the window. Wrapping her arms around herself, she said she was ok. She was married now, and just had an argument with her husband so if Sebastian could please leave before he got back. He practically ran out of the house, catching a taxi to the nearest airport. He managed to get back home two days later. Amy was frantic, but he pleaded a work emergency and she let it go. \n\n\nBut the curse couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t let go. Within the next two months he was back there at least once every two weeks. Each time it was the same but as time went on, he started to notice differences. She would be more wary, her eyes more pained each time. Then the bruises started appearing; minor ones at first but when one appeared on the left side of her face he knew. He pleaded with her, begged her to get some help. When he finally left it seemed like she might actually do it. \n\n\nBut when Sebastian got home, he found Amy waiting in his apartment. She demanded to know where he had been \u2013 they were supposed to have dinner together. She called him at work and when they didn\u2019t know where he was she called him on his phone at least a dozen times. He tried his best to calm her down but she was hysterical. Was he cheating on her? Was he unhappy? A lump appeared in Sebastian\u2019s throat; he fought to hold back tears. How could he explain what was happening to him? He showed her the ticket, explained Lucy\u2019s situation \u2013 how her husband was beating her, how he had been flying up there to try to get her to leave him. He had totally forgot to call but no he wasn\u2019t still interested in her, they were just kids when they dated. She didn\u2019t totally believe him, but she could feel his sincerity. When her tone changed, all he could feel was relief. Relief and gratitude. His promise was out of his lips before the question had even formed in hers. \n\n\nAnd that night, he prayed to whatever god was out there, that this was the final time.\n\n\nSebastian was in the bathroom when it happened; he had gone for two weeks without incident and Amy was finally starting to forgive him. It made him ecstatic that she was starting to trust him again and he felt like celebrating. Dinner had gone well and he was washing his hands when white light suddenly blinded him. He found himself outside of Lucy\u2019s house facing a slightly ajar front door. He panicked right away; he had taken to leaving his phone in plain view to show he wasn\u2019t hiding anything. Now it sat on the table, along with Amy waiting for him to return from the bathroom. A wave of despair hit him and he bleakly wondered how he was going to explain this to Amy. When he glanced at Lucy\u2019s front door wondering why he would appear on the street, he noticed the door frame was cracked.\n\t\n\nHe came through the broken front door in a stiff walk and found Lucy on her knees in the living room, a handful of her hair in his husband\u2019s fist. The husband was shouting at her, his voice raised in fury along with his other hand. Sebastian didn\u2019t even hear what he was saying as the last three months coalesced into that moment. All the frustration and anger flooded his mind like a tidal wave and snapped his willpower like a twig. Sebastian grabbed the husband by his raised arm and spun him around. Looking surprised, Sebastian obliged him by knocking him clean over with a punch to the face. Releasing Lucy\u2019s hair the husband when down, blood pouring from his nose. What happened next was a blur \u2013 he remembered watching himself like he was a stranger standing in the room. He climbed on top of the husband and began raining blows down on him, screaming why could the husband just leave Lucy alone, why could he keep his fists to himself, and why did he fucking have to always drag Sebastian into this. \n\n\nAt this point, Lucy hauled him off, Sebastian still spitting curses and profanities at the barely conscious figure on the ground. Lucy dragged him outside and calmed him down. Yes, she was ok; yes she would call the police. \n\n\nA cab ride later and the rage was gone. It was midnight at the airport and he tried for the tenth time to call Amy\u2019s cellphone from a payphone in the waiting area. When she finally picked up, he almost broke down. He started stammering, simultaneously thanking, pleading and begging but she silenced him with a single word. She spoke calmly but it was obvious that she had been crying. It was over. \n\n\nWhen she hung up, the tears he had been struggling to hold back finally came to life. Turning around, he found Lucy, her face slightly swollen with tears and bruises as he knew she would be. She looked tired and scared, but she took one look at his face and without a word stepped forward and embraced him. Tears started streaming down his cheek as he hugged her back. At least this was something that they both knew would never change.   \n\n",

            "comment": "The first time it happened, it was a shock. I recognized the yellow VW Beetle wrecked in the middle of the road. Her parents had given it to her for her sixteenth birthday... when we were still together. I called 911, I met her at the hospital. I told her that her fiance had died in the crash, but I couldn't bring myself to tell her how I'd come across the accident. She just wouldn't believe it.  \n  \nOur relationship began anew that day, but this time just as friends. The one girl I'd ever truly loved, just a friend. It was bittersweet, the joy of just having her back in my life eclipsed by the knowledge that she would never feel the same way as I did.  \n  \nI finally had to tell her the secret about a year later. She had seen me appear out of thin air, and at that point there was really no more denying it. \"What the hell just happened?\" Steph asked, once the police had taken the robber from her house in handcuffs. \"You just... **appeared** behind him!\"  \n  \n\"Well...\" I hesitated, trying to find the words that didn't make me look like a lunatic. \"It happened in high school, when we were still dating.\"  \n  \n\"**What** happened? You gained the ability to teleport?\"  \n  \n\"Kinda, yeah. This will sound dumb but... You were the hot goth chick, and I was a boring normal teenager who played video games, and so I tried to get into goth stuff to impress you.\"  \n  \n\"...Like magic? You thought I was some kind of Wiccan because I went through a black lipstick phase?\"  \n  \n\"Yeah like magic, and rituals and, and paganism. That kind of thing. I read stuff so I could impress you. You were so... out of my league. I just thought eventually you'd figure out how lame I was and dump me. Which you did, by the way. Anyway, I ended up finding some translated version of a book of rituals from this ancient cult of Aphrodite. I practiced the ritual a few times, and once I'd gathered the courage, I wanted to do it in front of you. I thought it was all fake, so I didn't expect it to actually work.\"  \n  \n\"So this is magic. Actual **Magic**. Look I really appreciate the help, but I don't need you appearing whenever I'm in trouble. I'm a grown woman and I can take care of myself. So, turn it off, ok?\"  \n  \n\"I...\" I hung my head in embarrassment, \"I can't stop it. It lasts...\"  \n  \n\"Forever. Great.\" She sounded annoyed, almost angry.  \n  \nI had to tell her. Either she knew the truth and possibly reciprocated, or she assumed she'd been right and hated me forever. I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself. \"No... It lasts until I stop loving you.\" I watched her expression change from annoyed to shocked, to confused... To sad. She pitied me.  \n  \n\"Tom, we were kids, we weren't 'in love'. We weren't 'soul mates'. We were just a couple of kids in a small town. Just because we grew up together doesn't mean we were meant for each other.\"  \n  \n\"I know, but I just... I've never been happy with anyone else.\"  \n  \n\"I'm sorry, Tom, but I have.\"  \n  \n\"I know. You talk about your new boyfriends all the time.\" The words came out more bitter than I'd intended.  \n  \n\"I think you should go home.\"  \n  \nShe wouldn't return my calls after that. We saw each other a few other times. Once she'd slipped on ice and gotten a concussion. Another car crash. A flat tire in the middle of nowhere. She wouldn't speak to me, though. Nothing beyond a polite, \"Thanks.\" \n\nA year had passed since she last needed me. I had almost been able to stop thinking about her when she started texting me. I ignored them, every one of them. I couldn't handle it again, the possibility that she finally felt the same way that I did, followed by the crushing realization that she never would.  \n  \nToday was the day. The day that all of my sadness, my loneliness, would end. I opened the door to Joy's building. I walked past the elevator and climbed the stairs. I had time. I couldn't help but think of Steph, even as I approached the door to my date's apartment. At number 513, I raised my hand to knock on the door, and thought of her again. I stopped. I couldn't do this. Not to myself, and not to Joy. She didn't deserve it. I went back to the stairs and stopped. I looked down, towards the exit, but I turned upwards.  \n  \nI took my phone out of my pocket. I texted to Joy, \"Sorry to cancel on such short notice, but I'm not feeling well.\" As I reached the top of the stairs, I opened the door to the roof. A warm breeze touched my face as I held up my hand to shield my eyes from the sun. I had only a sneaking suspicion of why I was up there.  \n  \nI paced around the roof. What would my life be like from this point onward? Would I ever be happy? Could I? No, certainly not. Joy, who I'd met through a mutual friend, was everything I could ever want but for the fact that she wasn't Steph. Steph, though, didn't want me. I'd never be happy. Every time I thought I could be happy had turned out to be a lie.  \n  \nI knew, now, why I was here. It was the only answer. The only way to relieve the emptiness. The sadness. Erase it. A part of my mind screamed for me to stop, but I knew that was emotion and not logic speaking. I had already realized the truth. The truth carried me with slow steps onto the ledge. The truth spread my arms, and closed my eyes.  \n  \nEven in my last moments, I heard her voice in my head, \"Tom? Tom what the fuck! What did you do?\"  \n  \nI opened my eyes and saw her there, falling with me. The fear on her face and the realization of what she'd done, and what I'd done would haunt me for the rest of my life.",

            "comment": "\"Oh, God DAMN IT! not again!\" Lucy exclaimed, obviously flustered about me appearing out of thin-air in her vicinity. It took me a moment to register the situation, and then immediately realise how messed up the situation truly was.\n\nIt was her grandmother's wake in Toronto; a few thousand miles away from me in Florida. While she was evidently saddened by the event, I had no knowledge of this, and was instead doing some homecleaning, dancing in my underwear to my Queen playlist; Tie your mother down, to be exact; poor choice of song for the situation.\n\nThe amount of eye contact with everyone; strangers, her parents and brother included, amounted to what almost equated as a firing squad. Considering her immediate family was made aware of my....\"situation\" with Lucy, it never did make it any less awkward. \n\nRegardless, there I am, near-buck naked in a funeral procession; neurons firing double time to think of an explanation, reasoning, humourous joke, anything to break the ice. Then again, it wasn't my fault.\nTurning to Lucy, coolly as the day I tarnished my birthday suit, I proclaimed \"Really? ANOTHER booty call now?\" slyly smirking. A few chuckles and \"spit your drink\" chortles were heard, so I perceived this as a success. She just gave me the death glare, excused us from the room, and dragged me out of sight into the next room. She composed herself thusly.\n\n\"Adam, don't get me wrong, that was fucking brilliant, but you're a fucking idiot. what are you DOING here?\" She began in a frustrated tone.\n\"Hell if I know, Lu. We both know how it works, remember?\"\n\"But I don't NEED you right now! Last week yo---\n\"PLEASE don't remind me of that. I'm still trying to get the stains out. Which reminds me.....\" \n\nAs I said this, I not-so subtly leaned in to her face and sniffed. My assumption was correct, exclaiming a rather large sigh.\n\n\"You were drinking, weren't you?\", Her gaze shifting to the floor left of me, like a child stealing a cookie.\n\"...No......\" She stuttered. \n\"I don't blame you, but I should be the last thing in your mind, especially now.\", stating the obvious misconnection, but she just shrugged it away. there was nothing she could do. \n\nThe air became tangible at this point, as the conversation became silent and awkward; She didn't know what to do, and given his mishap of this \"gift\", she knew I was stuck here, two thousand miles from home as it wasn't the first time. This was the least of my concern, however.\n\n\"So I don't suppose there's a spare suit? not everyone showed up in white....\". I had to break the silence somehow. There was a dead person in the other room, hundreds of other strangers questioning the situation. Forget being laughed at, I'm pretty sure her uncle Pete from Texas is here, and he's a big fan of formal occasions, just as an excuse to bring his shotgun. She scoffed at my petty attempt. \"Wait Here.\" she said, and went back into the room, leaving me here like a lost shaven puppy for quite some time.\n\nIt felt like an eternity before she came back. I was expecting some sort of literal monkey suit. Instead, she came back with a pair of stained slacks, an inverted KILLERS T-shirt and a red tie. A feeble attempt at best, but she's trying.\n\n\"You know....you don't have to go now...\" she subtly informed me, drifiting the question off as though it was a cheesy line from a porno.\n\"Yeah, because everyone isn't going to question why a chubby guy in underwear popped into existence at nana's funeral. it's bad enough as it is......wait, no cufflinks?\". I didn't wanna be here any longer than I already had. Finishing the tie up, I felt like I looked like something out of a horror movie. Nothing wrong with searching for the right alleyway, then.\n\n",

Not now!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Jennifer looked at me, baffled. \n\nThe tingling was creeping up my arms. More intense as it spread.\n\n\"Uh... So, I'm going to disappear for a bit. Not sure where I'm going or when I'll be back. Just know that it has nothing to do with you. I made a promise a long time ago that I can't break.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? You're just going to ditch me here with the check?\"\n\n\"Listen I promise I'll explain when I can. Wait, did you check in on Facebook with me?\"\n\n\"Of course, I wanted everyone to know that I was having a great time with what I thought was a great guy...\"\n\nShe trailed off as she noticed my fingers were fading from existence. The progression was accelerating. I stood up.\n\nNext thing I know I'm standing in a dirty bathroom. My 600lb ex girlfriend sitting on the toilet with her phone in her hand looking at Facebook and crying.\n\nShe sobbed at me, \"You said you would always be there for me! Who is Jennifer? I'm stuck again...\" Her voice trailing off meekly. \n\nI tried to just walk out the door but every time I did I simply stepped back into the bathroom.\n\n\"You still keep the KY in the same place?\" I sighed as I opened the bathroom drawer knowing the answer. \n\nLater I tried to call Jennifer but she wouldn't answer. This is the fourth potential relationship she's ruined. I know she's doing it on purpose, but she denies it.",

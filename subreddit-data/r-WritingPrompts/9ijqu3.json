            "comment": "The battlefield was a dangerous place for most demons. \n\nThe Angels fighting in the Celestial War were armed with silver swords and arrows of sunlight, instant death for any creature of Satan. In the conflict for dominion over Earth, thousands of Hell's soldiers had fallen to these weapons. \n\nBut this didn't bother M'hyirut. He was not some rank-and-file abbyssal, sent to the front line with no hope of return.\n\nHe was the Swift Demon. The Morningstar had given him unrivalled speed, the ability to move so fast that the world seemed to slow to a crawl around him. \n\nThe Angels could fire arrows. They could cut at his blurred outline with their terrible sabres. M'hyirut strolled through the battleground as if it was a garden, and everywhere he went, celestial beings fell to the earth, bleeding golden ichor from a thousand wounds inflicted faster than they could blink or cry in pain.\n\nThe battle was going well. The Angels had tried to push forward initially, forming a battle line across the fiery sky, but they were soon flooded by a crawling, boiling flood of condemned souls. Slowly, inch by inch, they were beaten back, till the retreat was sounded. A single unit guarded the fleeing forces, a condemned last stand, a wall of blooded shields and bitter spears.\nIn the middle of this phalanx, M'hyirut spotted a familiar face. Flowing white hair. One eye. A blade with golden edges.\n\nGabriel.\n\nM'hyirut roared in exertion, forcing himself to even greater speed. His wings of black smoke carried him upwards towards the Archangel, jagged blade raised and ready for the lethal strike. \n\nGabriel might be a fearsome warrior, but he couldn't defend an attack he never saw coming. The Morningstar would reward him well for-\n\nSomething crashed into M'hyirut's back, sending him careening through the sky. He crashed downwards, desperately beating the air with his wings to arrest his downwards momentum. He looked around, looking for the attacker.\n\nEverything around practically stopped as he focused, searching, searching...\n\nBehind him!\n\nOnly blind luck saved him. He flipped to the side, narrowly avoiding a cut which would have parted his head from his body. A quick beat of black wings gave him a safe distance. He regarded this new foe in amazement.\n\nIt was an angel, no doubt, but one he had never seen before. \n\nHis wings were not the usual white-grey of the celestial soldiers, nor the gold and silver of the Archangel commanders. They were translucent and azure, shading the world beyond them with a bluish haze. Litanies and incantations glowed within them, engraved into the arcane mass. His handsome face was confused and troubled.\n\n\"What are you, foul abberation?\" the celestial cried. \"My power over time is absolute, yet you move as if unaffected.\"\n\n\"I am M'hyirut, the Speed Demon. And I could say the same thing. Who are *you*, Angel?\"\n\n\"M'hyirut... I know who you are.\" He swung his blade in a hissing arc, cutting an arrow moving sluggishly by in half. \n\n\"I am Azakel. The Angel of Time. My powers were given by the Lord himself.\"\n\n\"And I was gifted mine by the Morningstar, in person.\" M'hyirut responded. \"Poetic, almost, that you will die at my blade.\n\nAzakel smiled grimly. There was no fear in his gaze. \n\n\"Truly this is the will of the One. The Speed Demon and the Angel of Time will meet upon the battlefield. Let us see who truly dominates the fourth dimension: The Lord? Or The Morningstar?.\"\n\nHe charged forwards, reality buckling under his wings.\n\nM'hyirut beat the air and met him upon the blooded sky. There was no escaping this battle.\n\nNone could ever tell what happened, even as the millions of teeming demons and angels looked upon the black-blue flash which split the skies for a second, and then was gone.\n\n\n\nThis is my second WP, please don't rip me a new one, I know I suck.",

            "comment": "\"Annnnnnnd stop right there,\" the man said, snapping open his pocket watch. Reality snapped and bucked at his control, but after a few lethargic jerks, he stepped out of time.\n\nHe stepped forward lazily and walked through the crowd in front of him, approaching the tower in the distance. Lightning crackled less like a force of nature and more as a languid constant, a long line of fire piercing the sky.\n\nHe wasn't here for the Ordeal, he was here for something else.\n\n\"Uh... What the hell?\"\n\nChronos paused, flicking his eyes down to his watch, then back towards one of the heroes he'd left behind.\n\nTheir eyes met, and Chronos blinked, slipping the chain around his watch to keep it from closing.\n\n\"I...\" the hero said, and Chronos cocked his head to the side, squinting at him. \n\n\"How are you moving?\"\n\n\"How are you moving!?\" The hero hissed, not that sound travelled fast enough for him to hear, Chronos could read lips, and the hero slammed himself forward. A strange blur effect, Chronos noted, a bit of heft to his eyes, a glow hidden underneath of the surface.\n\nA power to counteract his. A problem.\n\nChronos had never cared for problems, and problems rarely bothered him for long.\n\nBut this one, this one might be different.\n\nThe hero raced to his side. It was awkward, seeing someone that fast kept in the slow time, but Chronos nimbly stepped to the side as he ran by at a more human speed.\n\nThe hero slid to an awkward halt a few meters down the line, and then braced himself. Time rippled under the strain of the watch being open, and Chronos ignored it. He'd already slipped to the worlds between worlds where he drew power from, and their whispers couldn't claim him.\n\n\"Can't let you get near that facility,\" the hero said, looking at the watch. Unknown capabilities, but suicidal zealotry.\n\nChronos hated career heroes.\n\n\"Then, I'm afraid, I'm going to have to remove you. I need access to that secure room.\"\n\nThe hero cracked his knuckled and slammed his feet against the ground. A cloud of dust that would've been less pretty if it didn't unfurl in that strange place in between time, where seconds melted into minutes.\n\nIt didn't stop Chronos from taking the first blow to the face when the speedster abruptly sped up even faster.\n\nThe second one caught him across the chest, his suit distorting with a splash of black from the speedster's painted armor. The third caught him across the knees and the fourth---\n\nThe fourth didn't matter, because his reaction time kicked in.\n\nHis hands clenched around his watch, and reality screeched under the power of it and time slammed shut into a deeper cooler time, where entropy crawled to a halt.\n\nWhich just barely let him duck the second blow, and slam his free hand into the speedster's gut. Then up with the elbow into his chin, spin around the next blow, and drive the heel of his boot into the speedster's spine.\n\nThe watch bucked once under the strain, and time slid at a normal speed, slipping out of his control, and the speedster went flying. Head over heels, his speed warring against the aberrations done to physics, limbs locked together.\n\nThe other heroes scattered around, confused, trying to figure out exactly where the strange man had gone, then stared at the speedster.\n\nChronos grinned at them, waving jauntily, then frowned.\n\nThe watch-man brought a hand to his face and tasted blood. His watch hand clenched, and time stilled again.\n\nHe spat on the ground as bullets whizzed by his position, rattling out of guns in slow motion, like pretty pebbles throw through jelly.\n\nA blink, less than a heart beat, and Chronos stared at the fist as it whirred closer to his head than he'd ever seen it. A killing move, at that speed.\n\nHeroes could kill, if they wanted to.\n\nChronos smiled down against the hero, and clenched down on his mechanism.\n\nThe watch face cracked. The hands stopped in place, with only the urgent ticking of the gears inside to tell him that it was still working.\n\nToo hard on this model. He'd have to try and figure out how to overcome the limitations of the design. The beautiful equations written across the fabric of space in the hall without meaning.\n\nHe'd get another one. He always would.\n\nThe hero's eyes went wide, or rather, started the muscular contractions to make them go wide.\n\nEven speed faltered against the power of a stopped clock.\n\nNow, it was time to take care of his problem so he wouldn't have anyone chasing after him after all.\n\nHe reached into his coat.\n\nThe speedster deserved a more personal touch.\n\nChronos drew his pistol, pointed it against the hero's head, and pulled the trigger. The chemical reaction played out on a scale of minutes instead of instants, but he was nothing but patient, listening to the slow tick of the watch thrashing about against strained gears in his hand.\n\nHe wrenched it away when the bullet just started to dig into his flesh, a strange paradox of speed against the background of stillness.\n\nHe spun the gun in his hand, wiped it off with a cloth, and examined it for damage. Nothing. Impeccable as always.\n\nThen he turned away, not wanting to see the first moment of fear starting to trickle across the hero's face. It wasn't good to think about those things for long.\n\nIt'd be fifteen minutes, by his own time, before the bullet would splatter against his skull.\n\nEnough time to get to where he needed to go.\n\nEnough time to order flowers for a funeral.\n\n---------\n\nFor more like this, click here!

Both Peacewalker and 3 take place before it, and the events of both directly tie into the story of five. 1, 2, and 4 take place in the present day, in that order.\n\nSo the timeline is basically this: MGS3 Snake Eater, MGS Peacewalker, MGSV Ground Zeroes, MGSV Phantom Pain, MGS1, MGS2 Sons of Liberty, and MGS4 Guns of the Patriots.\n\nI've excluded the original Metal Gear 1 and 2, as they are a bit dated at this point and the minimal story from them is delivered across the other games. Also MGS Rising Revengeance, which takes place after MGS4 but isn't part of the core series plot.",

            "comment": "I was supposed to be meeting a client when they arrived in my alley. That gang of \u201cheroes\u201d that went around beating up and jailing people who were just trying to survive on the streets. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been following the trail led by your contacts for months. They ratted you out, and we have you cornered!\u201d Said the bold one in red, who I assumed was be the leader. \n\n\u201cOf course, that Randy was always a backstabbing scum. I love that guy.\u201d I responded. They walked slowly toward me, backing me into the wall. They had me cornered. \n\n\u201cTo think that all this would lead to a lowly street peddler. I was thinking the supplier would have been a gang boss or something\u201d chuckled the tall one in green. Probably the brains of the group. \n\n\u201cOh darlings, you must be confused. I\u2019m no lowly peddler.\u201d I paused for dramatic effect, it wasn\u2019t every day you got to talk to superheroes, might as well make a performance out of things. \u201cNo, no, I am The Peddler.\u201d\n\nNone of them appeared threatened by my name. While everyone on the streets would speak my name only scarcely in whispers, these twerps didn\u2019t even know who I was. This was going to be fun. \n\n\u201cListen buddy, we have you cornered, give up before it gets ugly.\u201d said the big one in orange as he punched his palm. Clearly the one who thinks with his fists. \n\n\u201cOh c\u2019mon darlings, you wouldn\u2019t stop by without checking out what I have for sale now would you?\u201dI opened my trench coat  to show them the wares inside. \u201cThese are gen-u-ine authentic watches. You can\u2019t turn down this deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBribery will get you nowhere peddler!\u201d said the one in pink, probably the peppy one who made them wear those hideous matching outfits. \n\nMy back was against the wall now, they were only a half dozen feet away. I had only seconds to act, but seconds were more than enough. \n\n\u201cCan we just grab \u2018em already? I\u2019m sooo bored.\u201d said the blue one quickly as she tapped her foot on the pavement, clearly indicating that she was telling the truth. \n\nThe big orange one\u2019s fist flew at my head. I quickly grabbed one of my watches and activated it. His fist stopped only inches away from my face. \n\n\u201cNo, not stopped, just slowed to the point where movement is barely noticeable\u201d I thought to myself as the rest of the world slowed too. \n\nI sidestepped the punch and got to work. I produced a cane from my trench coat and swept the legs out from underneath orange. I was about to do the same with the rest of the group when I heard a sound. \n\n\u201cWha-wha-what happened?!\u201d stammered blue. Now this is what caught me off guard. \n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you frozen? You\u2019re supposed to be frozen!\u201d I yelled. \n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t I fast?!\u201d She seemed in hysterics now. \n\n\u201cAhh\u201d I said, regaining my composure. \u201cIt appears I have met my match\u201d I responded. \n\n\u201cYou, I\u2019ll get you for this!\u201d She yelled as she charged towards me at an average speed. \n\nI wasn\u2019t used to fighting in real time, but I still managed to step out of the way of her heavily televised attack. It became apparent that she also wasn\u2019t used to this form of combat. \n\nAnd so it went on a bit, both of us out of our environment, her clumsily missing blows, me barely managing to not get hit. In a way it was the most anticlimactic fight ever. You\u2019d expect a master of time and speedy opponent to have an epic battle, and maybe it would look that way to outsiders, but at our speed it was obvious neither of us were actually very good at fighting. In fact I had rarely ever done anything but mess with my assailants and run away. After what felt like an eternity she managed to pin me against the wall. \n\n\u201cChange it back! Now!\u201d She yelled. Clearly using all her might to stop me from breaking free. It became blatantly apparent to me that without her super speed, she couldn\u2019t pack enough power into her blows. \n\n\u201cHoney now why would I do that? That\u2019s a horrible bargain. And besides, you aren\u2019t a threat to me.\u201d \n\n\u201cAre you telling me it will be like this forever?\u201d I could hear the desperation in her voice as she gestured towards her allies who still were facing the wall I was previously cornered in. \n\n\u201cDarling please, it\u2019ll stay like this until I tell it not to.\u201d I said with a smug grin. \u201cTell ya what. I\u2019ll cut ya a deal. Let me go free, and I\u2019ll let things return to normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m just gonna let a criminal walk away?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either that or spend an eternity with me in the next few minutes.\u201d I said, pointing towards my watch. \u201cNow frankly I don\u2019t mind the company, but the choice is yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI- I uh.\u201d She stammered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry darling, we\u2019ll have loads of fun in quite literally no time, just you and me, forever.\u201d I winked at her. \n\n \u201cFine. Deal.\u201d She said sounding defeated. Blue let go of me and sulked away. \u201cJust put it back to normal and get out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorks for me honey.\u201d I said while I walked down the alley. \u201cOh, don\u2019t forget this.\u201d I said as a tossed a beautiful \u201cgenuine\u201d golden watch to her. After I was a far enough distance away, I snapped my fingers, and time snapped back to normal speeds. \n\n\n\n\n\nWow okay so I\u2019ve never wrote on one of these prompts before, and I know it\u2019s late and this\u2019ll get buried, but I had a lot of fun writing. It\u2019s not perfect but I had a good time. Hope you enjoy. ",

            "comment": "At 13, I discovered I had the ability to slow the flow of time. It feels like holding back an invisible river, standing as a damn against the mightiest current nature could devise, yet somehow I alone could block it's flow. At first I could only make a clock tick slightly slower, but as I practiced I found I could stop animals from moving, and eventually even stopped a flock of ducks taking off from a pond in midair. I can still picture that day... their wings moving almost imperceptibly, water droplets hanging suspended in the air...\n\nI wasn't exactly unique, mutants had been around for a decade now, and in my school alone we had a girl whose eyes glowed purple and could see anything anywhere, and a guy who could reshape concrete with his mind. They were both older than I was and a black jet took them somewhere. I didn't want to leave so I had kept my power to myself, taking care to avoid notice anytime I used it. By junior year of high school I could stop my entire school in its tracks, which I used to play pranks. Nothing super harmful, changing all the answers on our arrogant valedictorians answer sheet, switching the contents of two people's lockers while they had them open, all in good fun. However, the rest of the world started noticing when their kids started showing up 15-20min late home after school, and the school's clocks were continually off. During that same year some unnamed men in black showed up investigating the odd occurrences, and after that I gave up my powers for a while.\n\nLife happened, and one day as a wage slave at a local Wendy's I'd had enough of my manager and owner, and living in a dingy apartment, and I'm not proud of this, but I used my power to swipe all the cash and key their cars. A few miliseconds of real time, and about 30 minutes and I'd made more than working there for years. Instant addiction. I quickly moved onto banks and very rapidly had amassed a huge pile of wealth. Soon, whatever I wanted was mine. That nice new rolex on your wrist? You're just holding it for me, the world was basically my oyster, and I opened up a clock repair shop as a front for cleaning my cash.\n\nI was bored, so, so bored. Life had become far too easy, and by 21 I had more than I could ever want. That all changed one day driving my souped up SRT Hellcat, weaving through traffic slowing time and speeding it up to clear a path. I saw a motorcyclist blow a tire and begin to go down. Without thinking, instantly I froze the city, opened my door and stepped out, faltering slightly as I skid a bit on the pavement, time not being totally stopped because I was freezing such a large area. I jogged up to him, and lifted him off his bike, carrying him back to my car and setting him in the passenger seat. Experience taught me he would still be moving when I unfroze him, so just setting him at the side of the road would have caused him to skid along the ground. I closed the door, unfroze time and drove down to road to let a very confused but thankful man out. It felt good to be a hero, to save his life.\n\nWhen I got home all the news could talk about was the missing 2 minutes of time that all the clocks had experienced. The 2 minutes the city lost as the rest of the world sped by. It was concluded that a powerful mutant had frozen time, and the motorcyclist's story was soon heard by all. \n\nSadly, saving one man's life doesn't negate stealing 10's of millions of dollars, and the banks were pretty quick to put 2 and 2 together. I was never publicly identified, but it wasn't very long before some intrepid heroes figured out who I was.\n\nIt did take quite a while though, and in the meantime I was out and about, mostly listening to police scanners and showing up in the background. As long as I was around, no bullet could move faster than a snail's crawl, a speeding car was suddenly easy to catch, and running away was just not an option. My peak was stopping a bomb mid-explosion when the bomb squad failed to diffuse it correctly, saving the two bomb techs. That one took some work. I just say I'm freezing time, but the fact is it still moves. Getting that shockwave to completely halt and dragging those 2 to safety took everything I had, and walking back to my car my head was on fire. That's when it happened. I felt myself being lifted off my feet, and the rest of the world was a blur, instinctively I reached out and slowed down time to find out I was being carried by a man who was running down the street. He was dressed in an all white suit that looked like it was made of something weird. He had a pair of lightning bolts running down either side of his chest, honestly it's just easier to say he looked like an 80's rock band reject.\n\nLooking around, everyone was frozen, and I was sure he should be too. Deciding enough was enough, I elbowed him in the face and rolled off his shoulder to the ground. I skid slightly on the ground letting me know we had been moving at great speed. Standing slowly I brushed off my suit, the mystery man very clearly putting on the breaks, was leaned at a near 45 degree angle pumping his legs so fast that the light blurred around them, his eyes were a perfect O of surprise as he clutched his nose, blood slowly dripping. \n\nI took my time, glanced over myself noting some scuffs. \"This is a custom fit hand tailored $5000 suit, I'll be sure to bill you for it, whoever you are.\" I said, not expecting a response. He looked confused, and his lips blurred as he responded, \"Hah, villain! You've stolen far more than enough to pay for it's repair! And I'm here to end your unchecked diabolical thefts against the citizens of this city!\" Internally I groaned, what a dweeb! Did he actually say that? But there was a serious look on his face and his pumping legs were moving him towards me, admittedly at about walking speed, which was comical given that he looked like he was at an all out sprint, but this was rather serious. I'd never met anyone who could actually move when I didn't want them too.\n\nSuddenly in almost a second he'd crossed the space between us and landed 3 blows! I concentrated harder and he slowed back to normal speed, I planted my foot square in his nuts, and once again picked myself up. Now I was pissed, between the headache, and being carried then dumped, and hit... I was doing the right thing for the first time in my life! Why was I being punished for it!\n\n\"What the hell man, what did I ever do to you?\" I cried out. \"You've stolen from the fair citizens of this city! And I'm here to stop you!\" He replied, superior look on his face. \"I literally just saved the bomb squad! I've been saving people for months now, I'm one of the good guys, I could help you!\" \"LIAR! Once a bad guy always a bad guy!\" Came his retort. Really? People really talk like that? Was all I could think.\n\nThe guy was a tool, but I didn't want to hurt him. I squared up focusing all my ability onto him, the rest of the world slowly speeding up as he slowed down until everyone was moving normally and he was frozen in place. I blended into the crowd as people gathered around, gasping. Panicked cries of people questioning how \"The Blur\" was frozen followed me. I managed to keep it up for about 3 blocks until I lost my hold on him. Somehow he didn't catch up to me and I made it home with an Uber, stopping for a few ibuprofen on the way home. When I got there it was all over the news. The Blur was talking about how a new super villain ran away when confronted by his 'super self', and how the 'coward' had better never show up again.\n\nI sat back, slowly, contemplating my new enemy. So, super villain was I? I grinned, feeling the pain in my lip from where it'd been busted earlier. At least life isn't boring anymore...",

My mind sped up, my eyes adjusted, my muscles began to listen again - and at that moment, I could feel something hovering, quivering near my temple.\n\nIt was floating there so strangely, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what had happened. Me and my men - Army's first superhuman squad, second section - had just engaged the enemy when, all of a sudden, everything had seemed to just... stop. No sound, no bright white light, nothing. I thought at first this must be what dying is - so fast that no one, not even *I*, could ever see it coming.\n\nAnd then I realized, as the sound of the gun being fired and the sensation of bullet starting to push into my temple registered, that no one else would have. \n\nMy hand almost moved on it's own and, with two nimble fingers, pushed the bullet out in front of my face. It was always difficult to stop something already in motion at this speed, so I had to go for the next best thing. The thing slowly crawled into my field of vision, death in such a tiny package, and after a moment of shock I looked to my left to see what exactly had happened. \n\nThe battlefield had completely stopped, it'd seemed. Bullets and beams of light whizzed through the air, soldiers screaming with no words and dying in a moment. Blood sprinkled forth from wounds and speckled the air surrounding them. Some of my men were using their abilities. Broadside was throwing a punch, Radar was doing his thing in the ditch, and Bay was... knelt down praying. Wish I coulda smacked him, dunce.\n\nThen I noticed the man in camo, prone on the ground just feet away. His eyes opened wide in my time.\n\n*So it's him,* I thought. *He must've seen us getting busy earlier and decided it was best to take me out.* I couldn't blame him, either. My power was something special, apparently - one in a million, something hard to predict. That's how I got to command this little group of mine, being hard to predict.\n\nOf course, nobody ever tells you about drawbacks when you sign up for this shit.\n\nMy vision blinked out for a second, and the brutality around me returned. The bullet whizzed by and struck the dirt. Screams and explosions rose, the dying died, and I consciously cranked the speed back up until I'd returned to our little moment. There was a limit on how long I could use my power. Bursts of speed for about ten to fifteen seconds, depending on how long I pushed. Any more and I'd be signing my own death warrant.\n\nOf course, the man in my house couldn't have known that. By the time I'd gotten back, he'd appeared to have readied his pistol for a shot into Broadside. Bad choice, in my opinion - it wouldn't have done much, even at point blank, with that shitty little peashooter of his.\n\nI noticed how sluggish I felt when I tried to move, but I got used to it fast. Kinda necessary to learn how to adjust on the fly with these abilities. I scrambled over to the man and tried to throw a punch, but he noticed me and dove well out of the way. I turned to face him again, but the quickness left me again, left me in the world of other men.\n\nI closed my eyes and willed myself back into the quiet, still existence, but pain wracked my head and I felt like something had started stirring up my insides. My lip felt wet, and I wiped it to find a spot of blood. I was on the ground, laid out from a punch. The guy must not have wanted to take the chance of shooting me with a slow bullet again and opted to take a cheap shot and reposition. I'd do the same, honestly.\n\nI got to my feet and searched as quickly as I could. The man hadn't gotten far, only stopping to steady himself and struggling to hold his breath it seemed. \n\n*Is that his limit?* I thought and ran as fast as time would allow over to his position and grabbed him. I'll never forget the look on his face as I swung him around and let go. I sent him flying over to Broadside. His fist hadn't moved much in the two intervals of real time we'd experienced. There was plenty of space between him and the soldier he'd literally disarmed.\n\n*No real way to stop that momentum.* As I dropped to the ground prone and covered my head, I noticed my nose had started bleeding. *Did he punch me straight on, or did I go too far? Felt like I took a hit to the cheek.*\n\nIt was the worst thing I had to worry about once the man in my time got stopped by Broad's fist in his side and gasped for air. \n",

She could feel the pressure inside, pulsing through her veins and she liked it. It was like her skin was stretched and being forced to contain a far greater power than it should. That feeling spoke to Velocity it is exactly what she thought of herself, she was a far greater power than any of the normal people who stood like statues around her. As she walked up Central Avenue she could feel the constant battle her body was undergoing to keep itself from ripping and bursting with the force of her pumped up system and no one knew, no one could even see her. The very air around her felt thick, like she was moving with little weights attached to her limbs. Nothing else moved around her, or it did but to her it moved so slowly it might as well not be moving at all. The silence was surreal to her it was peaceful, she was moving faster than sound, moving so fast that even the colours of everything around her seemed ever so slightly out of focus. All of this she loved, it meant she was doing what her body was meant for, she was moving at speed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShift enjoyed his life and he had a lot of life to enjoy. By his reckoning he would be about 348 years old, if he had actually lived in all of those moments. Shift had never been in a rush and he had never needed to. He could live in a place where time moved differently, for every hour his mind thought had passed barely a second had passed for anyone else. It always amused him that his mind still needed to count in seconds and minutes and record time when time had no hold on him. Shift had become accustomed to being alone, accustomed to the silence and the way everything looked a little blurred to his eyes as it moved in its minute little increments. It gave him the ability to do what he wanted when he wanted. Moving down Central Avenue he had no idea what he actually wanted, he had done so much and it was getting harder to actually find something interesting that he wanted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVelocity saw movement ahead it was such a shock that she allowed herself to slow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShift saw movement ahead it was such a shock that he allowed time to move faster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the world burst into life, sounds cascading around, the world coming into focus, the wind ruffling and moving down the street, people and cars seemingly leaping into action, it was Velocity and Shift who where now completely motionless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt lasted for only a few heartbeats and then Velocity started moving again. The pressure in her body mounting as her heartbeat raced and the world started to slow. In the same instant Shift slowed the world and started to move. Once again the sound faded and disappeared, the wind ceased, people and cars seemed frozen again and the blur or distortion in the world came back. They ran at each other locking eyes and matching direction. In no time at all they would meet, no time and yet all the time in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they came together it was Velocity who acted first throwing her left fist straight at Shifts face. She couldn't understand he simply stepped aside, the blow missing wildly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs Velocity's fist passed him by he turned and tried to throw one of his own, but Velocity simply turned her body and stepped to the side and there was no contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis went on with Kicks and punches being thrown. Grappled and wrestled and pushed until finally both starting to feel the first signs of fatigue, both with same growing look of alarm and confusion on their faces they looked at each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVelocitys mind raced, this had never happened before it was a fair fight and it turned out she was terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShift couldn't believe it this had never happened before he was fighting a fair fight and he was terrible.",

            "comment": "My first WP on Reddit - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRadon, brought down on his knees, wiped his face with the back of his hand. His face was still stinging from the blow. He could feel the taste of blood in his mouth. He spat and raised his sickly body up. As the rush of adrenaline shot through his body, his pain subsided to the background. He brought his hands to his temples and with all his willpower concentrated hard on time - this time he succeeded. A white glow started beaming out of his body.\n\nThe beams of white light sprang from his body like ropes and jumped onto the invisible dimensions of time. The ropes wrapped around the seconds, and like a leash started pulling them back. He needed more force. Radon let out a wild scream, in pain and in agony. It worked. The white ropes started slowing down the time. Seconds turned into minutes. Minutes into hours. He had mastered the time.\n\nWhen he opened the eyes, the sky continued to be the orange of the evening, the way it had been a few minutes ago. But the rest of the world had changed. It had thickened around him. Making everything difficult to move. The leaves of the trees, the fighting armies around him, the tanks, the bullets, each and everything slowed down to a cartoonish speed. \u201cNow he can\u2019t hide,\u201d Radon muttered under his breath.\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t.\n\nStreak, who had been a blur till now, could not hide anymore. He was an accident of nature, just like him, and could vibrate the atoms of his body at frightening frequencies. The result - an ability to run faster than anything out there. As a young boy he had out-sped taxis and trains. Then as he grew older, even supercars and Jets couldn't match his pace. And then he broke the speed of sound. But only when he broke the two hundred years old record of five percent of speed of light. Setting his record at seven percent that he caught the Milky Way\u2019s attention.\n\nBut unlike Radon, who had joined Masters of Galaxy Unity Mission  (MOGU) to further the cause of peace in the Galaxy, Streak had joined the revolutionaries. A patchwork of freaks who wanted to start a revolution. \"Fools!\" Radon had described them when he was given this job to deal with them. And they had proved to be fool in front of him - when within three weeks he rounded up fifty of their members. But this Streak, the last of them, was proving a little difficult to tame.\n\nIt was Mu who zeroed in on his location - Radon\u2019s trusted navigator. And when she did that Radon had left everything to land up at Alpha - 786. A young planet with base level technology. Streak is recruiting - the report had said. \"He won't anymore!\" Radon had said to himself.\n\nWhen Radon *wormholed* to the location, Streak was standing at the foot of a mid sized spaceplane. He was holding a lightphone - an age old invention for interplanetary communication. He must have allies - for the next moment a wormhole appears right above the spaceplane, which alighted the very next moment, and vanished into the wormhole. And so did Streak. Radon was late, he couldn't stop the time and Streak had disappeared. Taken by double surprise, Radon was taken off-guard and that\u2019s when he felt a sharp blow on his face that pushed him back to his Knees. \u201cFucking Ant!\u201d Radon had cursed as he tasted his blood.\n\nBut now Radon was smiling, biting his lips in anticipation to kill his prey. His white ropes had turned time to gelatin, thick and viscous, slowing down everything, Radon stepped ahead with a grin on his face. \u201cCan\u2019t run anymore, can you Streak?\u201d he mocked as his eyes danced around to spot him. His mind started calculating. He can\u2019t be far. Even in the worst case scenario, in few seconds, considering all the time he needs to pick up speed, he can\u2019t go far. He brought his hand in front of him and clicked a button. A lifesize map appeared in front of him giving him details of the geospace around him. \u201cStreak,\u201d he said almost whispering.\n\nHe was looking far from the center of the map - where he was standing. So when the red dot appeared right where he was standing, at his back, he was taken by surprise. One more blow, this time on his back. He was airborne, the map vanished, his leash on time started weakening, the gelatin melting into liquid. By the time he fell back, his back burning in a piercing pain, the time had assumed his original quality. Streak was standing above him with a mocking grin on his face.\n\n\u201cHow did he!\u201d wondered Radon. A volcano erupted within him. This time, even without his hands on the temples, he burst into such a blinding light that Streak turned back, protecting his eyes. And then - a lull enveloped them. Everything became still. Everything froze. The time had turned to ice now - allowing nothing to move. Radon erupted into a thundering laugh. \u201cNow you\u2019ll die ant!\u201d he roared as he stood up. But \u2026 But \u2026 unlike everything around him, Streak wasn\u2019t still. He could move! His power seemed to be not working on Streak. And Streak had realized it. For he shrank away from him - his edges blurring as he started vibrating once more. \u201cNo \u2026 Noooo,\u201d Radon cried.\n\nBut, now it was Streak\u2019s turn to be surprised. He was not able to run. He could move in the three dimensions of space, but wouldn't accelerate beyond normal limits. Space and time are interlinked. You can\u2019t bend one without curving another. He was cut off by the time. Radon had stopped time. And therefore, cut off from his ability to run fast.\n\nRadon, on the other hand, had the problem of his own. For the first time he had seen someone escaping his ropes of time. Even though Streak was without his power to run fast, he still possessed a formidable build than him. And he was a tested warrior. He was trained in the ancient art of fighting with his bare hands. But Radon wasn't.  Time was Radon only and ultimate weapon. He had escaped tanks and spaceships and even empires with his single ability to tame time. Without it, he presented a weak, useless opponent.\n\nThe fact that Streak was still hiding indicated that he was yet to figure out his quandary. So Radon, thought of retreating. Run today, fight tomorrow! Radon realized the irony of this ancient proverb. There was no tomorrow when he was fighting Streak. Streak has outdone him.\n\nHe turned a dial and a spaceplane appear over his head. A beam of light washed his sickly body and the next instant his body turned to air. He was teleported into the spaceplane. Streak had won this fight, Radon thought as he sat alone in his cabin, but he will not win the war. Radon closed his eyes and immersed into a trance that took him to the ancient master of time. He needed some answers.",

            "comment": "The world seemed to blur as the hero raced through the landscape, arms furled behind him like the wings of an airplane. It was good to run. Ever since he had gotten framed for robbing that bank a few days ago, his life had been a mess. He was hunted down in the capital city, arrested, and locked up on a remote island. This was the first chance he'd had to really stretch his legs.\n\nUnfortunately, his legs didn't seem to be working. Or rather, they were, but he wasn't getting anywhere. All his incredible speed was moving him at merely a walking pace.\n\n\"It's no use. You can't break free.\"\n\nThe hero looked up to see himself, wrapped in black. \n\n\"Hey, you're the one who robbed that bank! And put the cops on my tail! Who are you? And why do you look like me?\"\n\n\"*I* look like you? I think you're the fake.\" His doppelganger chuckled. \"You're not even good enough to-\"\n\n\"I'll make you eat those words!\" Ever impatient, the hero interrupted his counterpart. He summoned all the energy he could and willed his legs to move faster. With excruciating difficulty, he accelerated to a moderate run, still blazing fast for anyone else. He charged straight at the shadow in front of him, preparing to attack, but when he got close, the figure disappeared. The hero ground to a halt and looked around frantically.\n\n\"So there's more to you than just looking like me. You ran fast enough to counteract my power.\"\n\n*It's not his speed... he must be teleporting somehow.*\n\n\"I'd like to stay and see what you're capable of, but I don't have time for games. Farewell.\"\n\n*If I can get him to do it again, I can figure out what he's doing.*\n\nNew plan in mind, the hero taunted his shadow. \"I won't let you get away that easily!\"\n\n\"You won't even get the chance.\"\n\nAnother burst of speed. Another charge.\n\n*Come on. Do it.*\n\nThe hero's dark reflection filled his vision.\n\n*Do it already. I've almost reached you.*\n\nIt felt like his doppelganger was inches away when he finally disappeared from the hero's sight. The slowed time worked against him, letting the hero see the words he mouthed before blinking away.\n\n*So that's what it is. But... can I really do this?*\n\nHe heard his counterpart's voice speak again from behind him.\n\n\"Not bad for an imposter. But not even you will be able to move after *this*.\"\n\n*OK, here it comes. Focus.*\n\nThey both knew what to do. Two hands produced two gemstones. Each was tense, ready, waiting for the other to move.\n\nAfter what felt like a second and an eternity all at once, the two hedgehogs shouted the words in unison.\n\n\"Chaos Control!\"\n\n---\n\nOw, the edge. Sorry for turning a great prompt into Sonic fan fiction.",

How. *How!?*\n\nThis was the question that surged through the world when the wall at last came down, the world smugly prepared to receive a humbled USA, a world triumphantly rebuilt in their absence.\n\nOnly to find that America had thrived even further.\n\n\"Well,\" said the suave young Texan whose visage now graced our screens, \"we sent up satellites.\"\n\nSatellites? *Satellites?*\n\n\"In direct contravention of the treaty!? How! No rocket launches were detected.\"\n\nHe put up his arms in a sort of amicable way. \"The treaty you all broke the day after it came into effect? We are talking about the Treaty of Berlin, 2045, correct?\"\n\nThe world was silent to that true accusation.\n\n\"We still had spies you know. You have to know that, right? I'm trying to maintain professionalism, but you all had to know that, surely?\"\n\nHe seemed to be struggling to maintain his composure, forcing himself to straighten his tie before breaking out into a grin, then straightening his tie again and putting on a brief poker face before breaking into a grin again.\n\n\"When global opinion turned against us we were forced to sign that humiliating treaty that every single one of you broke but we haven't just been *sitting here* doing *nothing* waiting for the whole world to break down our walls.\"\n\nHe shook his head and an image showed on the screen of a colossal railway that lifted towards the sky, festooned in garish American colors. \"With no trade we were 'forced' to use uranium power. 'Forced' to mine the asteroids for rare earth metals and other materials - without using rockets. So we used our big new EM gun.\"\n\nThe image switched to a video, of massive drones being shot off the railway into space, then of those same drones burrowing into great, hurtling rocks in space, maneuvering with tiny jets of air.\n\n\"Necessity is the mother of invention and all that. We had a lot of necessity. You had little to none. You put us on the backfoot while your Russians did your engineering and your Chinese did your industry and your Africans gave your resources.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Oh and we stole just...just everything. You guys did definitely make some pretty cool things. Fusion power, absolutely, kudos. You all shared it pretty freely too. That was nice. Really the morally right thing to do. We stole the shit out of fusion power.\"\n\nThere were harrumphs of distaste at that. American coarseness.\n\n\"But really all we didn't do was share. Didn't share a darn thing. Course we can share now. Gonna have to...*renegotiate* some things, but we can share now.\"\n\nHe grinned in a predatory sort of way.\n\n\"Ohhh yes. We can share all kinds of things. For a price.\"\n\nThe outrage was immediate. They'd stolen our secrets but would only sell their own!?\n\nThe image switched again. This time to show a large artillery shell being loaded onto the tracks of the \"EM gun.\"\n\n\"Course if that don't interest you none, there are some things we can share for free.\"",

            "comment": "The war was a mistake. Like so many great squabbles in history, WWIII began over a misunderstanding. The US missile detection systems picked up a surprising large nuclear salvo from The People's Republic of Korea. The US retaliated with overwhelming force. China backed their ally and responded as expected. People expect nukes to end wars, but this time they started them.\n\nThe world burned and bled for six long years. Finally, a meeting was held. Some say one side called it, and some say the other did. This meeting brought forth The Closed Doors treaty. For fifty years, every nation would tend to its own people, rebuilding what once was in theory. However, this was not the first conference that had been held. The one before excluded the United States of America. The world believed that the mistake was just an excuse to attack, given the line of unstable presidents leading up to the first strike. For fifty years, the world would be dark and silent to the US only. No communication would be had with any terrestrial nation.\n\nThe world didn't expect the US to communicate with an extraterrestrial nation. They presented themselves as the strong but peaceful world leaders they once were so long ago. The outsiders believed them and taught them. They traded rare metals and strange chemical compounds for things abundant on earth like iron and silica. The Americans were given future-changing sciences and technology for a few tons of dirt.\n\nUp until the communication wall finally fell, the rest of the world was arrogant in their progress. They had cured diseases, established cheap, renewable energy systems. There was progress into hyper-conductive materials and faster-than-light travel. The world was in anxious peace leading up to the end of the fifty year period.\n\nWhen the wall did come down, the world held a reintroduction convention. The American representative was told to quietly listen to every world leader's advancements and progress, as if to show them how far behind they were and how it was their own fault. Leader after leader sneered as they delivered their presentation. The convention lasted eleven days. On the start of the twelfth, the American was given his chance to speak, much to the disdain of the rest of the world. He said no words. Instead he took a small device from his pocket, pressed a few buttons on it, and instantly beamed a presentation all of the US' progress into the minds of the other leaders. \n\nand the world wept",

            "comment": "It was a curious solution and nobody expected it to be as easy as it was. Fifty years of isolation.\n\nNobody knew who fired the first shots. Some said it was the Chinese, some said it was the North Koreans, others said it was the Americans. In the end, it really didn't matter, because everyone ended up involved in some way. We were all guilty and shared the same sins.\n\nBut for all the doomsaying about the 'end of the world', things actually weren't that bad... well, compared to how bad it could've been. Twentieth century novels convinced us that World War III would result in a blasted hellscape, billions dead, nothing left standing. Perhaps in our darkest moments, we still retained a shred of humanity. Or perhaps we learned from the terrible brand of warfare waged in the 40s. Rather than missiles striking innocent population centers, surgical strikes and tactical nuclear weapons simply devastated infrastructure and military targets. Hundreds of millions had still perished - collateral damage, fallout, famine and disease - but the worst hadn't happened. Eiffel Tower and Saint Basil's Cathedral were still standing. In a rather striking twist of irony, by waging World War III, we had destroyed mostly just the tools we would need to wage World War IV.\n\nAfter that came the 'Grand Plan'. Fifty years of isolation. Everyone expected us to resist the plan the most, and were surprised when, after a national referendum, we ended up being the most eager. Walls went up. Trade routes gradually eased and then stopped altogether. The doors were shut.\n\nAnd for fifty years, we prospered. We had lost many of the cheap luxuries we had grown accustomed to, but agriculture surged as, lacking imported crops, we razed thousands of hectares of corn to grow our own. Oil deposits were uncapped. Unemployment dropped to less than 1% as millions of lost jobs suddenly came in high demand. It was a simple life, but we were happy. Americana had returned.\n\nFifty years passed in an eyeblink and the great reunification would begin. All the nations of the world to meet and share what they had learned. It wasn't going to be easy, of course - the war had destroyed nearly every satellite. We would need to seek out people to communicate with manually.\n\nOur first attempt at contact was to head north to our oldest allies. Canada had been one of the most apprehensive countries with regards to the isolation, and actually considered joining America in joint isolation, but the United Nations council soundly rejected the notion. As our diplomatic convoys crossed the border and entered Toronto, they were shocked by what they found. Hunger. Disease. Poverty. The once great city was decaying and largely vacant. Similar reports came from Montreal and Ottawa. Upon contacting the Canadian government, the truth came out. \n\nIt was a ruse. A great big ruse. The world, convinced that America had been, at best, indirectly responsible for the war, had collectively agreed to formulate fake isolation plans, and leave us in the dark. The plan was to bring the world and humanity as a whole into a bright and shining future. The results were... less than satisfactory.\n\nIf the world had advanced to prosperity, it certainly didn't show in Canada. Having lost their largest trading partner, Canada found themselves out of the global market. Asia had no use for Canadian manufacturing, and Eastern Europe had filled demand to Europe. Canada began to market their oil reserves, but shortly after the walls went up, the United Nations declared a global moratorium on fossil fuels to allow the earth to heal. Canada was, almost literally, left out in the cold, and had suffered greatly.\n\nHowever, as bad as the situation in Canada was, it wouldn't compare to what we found to the south. We sent diplomatic teams south just as we did north... teams that were never heard of again. Crossing the border, they initially reported that little appeared different from before the war - there was running water, power, though it bore all the hallmarks of a relatively poor country. But as they would near Mexico City, they were just go dark.\n\nWe weren't sure what we were going to do. We didn't want our first reconnection with the world to involve military force, invading a country to find our teams. Then, weeks after the first team had gone dark, we learned something new. On the side of a road in south Texas, in a van, lay one of our ambassadors - beaten, bloodied, and mutilated. Along with him were the heads of the two dozen men and women who escorted him.\n\nThe ambassador had been returned with a message and shared with us what he had learned. It seemed that while Mexico had taken a few licks during the great war, that story was not true for South America. In fact, they survived the war almost completely untouched. Lacking global strike capabilities, they were largely ignored by the warring parties. The starry-eyed isolation plan was largely a European one, and the plan simply seemed to exclude the entire western hemisphere. Why bother with South America? They had little to offer the world, and they were too far and isolated. In fact, they even went as far as to congratulate themselves for 'freeing' South America of American influence and corruption. \n\nWith Mexico's government weakened, it left the country primed for the largest military force in the region to take over - the cartels. Mexico had become a narco-state. Without any threat from government forces - American or otherwise - the cartels expanded influence worldwide, filling the economic hole left by America's absence with a global drug ring. South of Panama, without the 'interference' of America - as the isolation planners would put it - South America was free to pursue its own destiny, a destiny that seemed to largely revolve around fifty years of civil wars and military coups.\n\nOver the coming months, we learned much from Europe, Africa, and Asia, and replaced the wonder we held in our hearts with cynicism and anger and disgust. Instead of the utopia that had been envisioned, there was nothing more than endless war. While North Korea had fallen in World War III, China now occupied the Korean penninsula. Most of Eastern Europe had fallen to Russia. Africa was... well it was still Africa. \n\nIn Europe the situation was little improved. The European Union had combined into the United European States, headed by Germany and France. The United Kingdom had undergone its own degree of voluntary isolationism, withdrawing further into itself. It attempted to reunify the commonwealth, but Chinese control of the South Pacific left Australia and New Zealand subject to absolute trade embargoes. \n\nTo the north, Scandinavia had suffered immensely. Without oil and the american economy to sell their investments, Norway had gone from one of the most prosperous nations to a state whose crippling debts had to be underwritten every year by the rest of the UES. Threats from Russia had pushed Finland into a military state, and tensions were high that invasion could occur any day. Pushing for hardline social reform, tolerance, and acceptance, refugees from the war-torn North Africa and Southwest Asia flooded by the millions into Europe. Cries to even attempt to slow the flow were ignored as the mewling complaints of the bigoted. Before long, the population outpaced the capability to feed and employ people, and the dream of prosperity, where no man had to want for anything, had waned into a slow, cold recession that had lasted for nearly four decades. Hundreds of square miles of cheap, filthy government tenaments were erected ringing the major cities. \n\nEverywhere we had gone, we found that over and over, that good intentions mean nothing without the wilpower to see them out. Our envoys were given a cold reception and simply told to leave. \"America wasn't wanted anymore\", they insisted. \n\nAnd so we returned home. \n\nAnd then we rebuilt the walls.\n\nMaybe the world needed fifty more years.",

If that were the case, they would have picked someone else. Someone pretty with a warm voice and a closet full of pastel-colored fluffy sweater sets.  \n\nWhy the fuck did I go into a career in diplomacy? Right, the dream: travel the world; meet people from all parts of the globe; experience different cultures; eat a lot of good food. Yeah, I should have gone into piloting. Same opportunities, no chance of landing this gig.\n\nI did not want this job. There is absolutely no precedent for this situation in all of human history. I am completely flying by the seat of my pants.  \n\nFirst ambassador to the United States in 50 years. 5 - 0. FIFTY! How the fuck did anyone think this was a good idea? We used to make fun of hermit states.  \n\nStill, following World War 3, apparently the best course of action was a 50 year time-out for the culprit. Only we didn't tell them the time-out was just for them.   \n\nI was twelve when the Marion Island Treaty was signed. People still tell anecdotes of state leaders having to pitch tents in muddy ground because there wasn't enough room for everyone at the research base in the middle of the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean.\n\nAfter 35 days of grueling negotiations, the world's 195 nations reached an agreement to completely close borders, isolate everyone from each other, and reconvene 50 years hence on the tiny South African island of Marion to negotiate rapprochement.\n\nThat's what I assume kids are taught in the history books of the United States. If they still have history books, that is. I wouldn't know. Nobody would know because we haven't communicated with them in 50 years!\n\nOur history books tell a different story: the story of the tribe of 55. The African Union, host of the peace talks, came to the summit with a plan. They had decided to treat the aggressor as they would a deadly infectious disease: quarantine.\n\nThe problem lay in convincing the remaining 139 nations that it was in their best interest to participate in the biggest political ruse the world had ever seen. 158 countries against one. \n  \nSomehow, it worked. Somehow, 55 African leaders convinced 139 others that the world's conflicts could be solved if only the United States of America were quarantined. What followed were the Aurora Australis Accords, aptly named for being agreed upon in clandestine night-time negotiations under the southern lights. \n\nDuring the day, broad negotiations were steered onto the path of complete isolation of all individual nations. At night, assurances were made and eye-popping horse-trades of territories and resources commenced over the course of the next 30 days. All the while the President of the United States remained blissfully ignorant.   \n\nAs part of the Marion agreement, it was stipulated that each country would recall their citizens, and then implement complete border closure and communications blackout before informing their population of the terms of the treaty. \n\nMy dad used to say, \"Democracy went into cardiac arrest.\" He was a surgeon. He liked to use medical metaphors a lot. I feel like I'm going into cardiac arrest right now. \n\n50 years ago, in my grandparents' generation, 158 people made a choice that changed the course of the entire world. Today, I get to explain that choice to a whole nation that has been isolated since then. \n\nMe. Not a president, not a chancellor, not even a high level cabinet member of some sort. Just a career diplomat who made a life out of making friends and negotiating peaceful solutions to tough issues. \n\nThat's where integrity will get you. When it comes time to pull a name out of the hat, you can be sure you and everyone else put in yours. \n\nDon't kill the messenger. Maybe I should open with that?\n\nI have no idea what to expect. Nobody does. Somehow the biggest con of the world also became the longest lasting. 50 years of time-out and silent treatment for one nation out of 159.    \n\nI assume that to be true. I can't imagine the US would still be under the Cloak if they had caught wind of the truth.\n\nThe Cloak. Fuck, it'll be pandemonium when that comes down. They'll get the rest of the internet back, and every single thing they missed will be right there, waiting. Unless they developed tech that's too different from ours and they can't connect. What if they can't connect? What if their computers don't speak the same language anymore? That thing about Moore's law.\n\nI'm gonna be sick. How the fuck did anyone think this was a good idea?\n\nThe itinerary is as vague as the circumstances command: 09:00 am arrival at Marion Research Station helipad; 10:00 am official breakfast with the representative of the United States of America.\n\n10 minutes. I have 10 minutes before I have to explain to the representative of the United States that they have been the victim of an international long-con for the past 50 years. \n\nMy cousin, the linguist, assures me they will speak English but he expects I'll bump into odd pronunciations or neologisms (\"What?\" \"New words they introduced into their common vernacular.\" \"Oh.\"). I wonder what words they'll use when I tell them the truth.\n\nThe corridor leading from my cabin to the cafeteria in the main building is the longest stretch of grey-green linoleum I have ever walked. The security detail two steps behind me is raising the hair on the back of my neck. I usually don't travel with security detail.\n\n\"Could you ... not?\" \n\nMy spastic hand motions are a terrible way to convey the level of discomfort I feel at their unnatural proximity. I am a diplomat. I speak four languages. I can do better. \n\n\"Would you please consider adopting a more relaxed presence? There is no reason to suspect an imminent threat. Everyone has been screened. The research staff are all highly respected members of the scientific community. I'm going to be fine. It's just coffee and continental breakfast.\"\n\nIf I really believed that, my heart wouldn't be pounding a mile a minute, but I manage to hide that fact behind the layers of African cotton, Turkish silk, and Chinese nylon that make up my battle armor from the outside in. I am wearing my big girl panties. I can do this.\n\nThe big guys in black suits reluctantly concede. The older, gruffer looking guy falls back a few more steps while the younger man - Joseph? Jonah? Just Joe? - closes the distance and falls into step beside me.\n\n\"Sorry, if we're making you uncomfortable,\" he says in a quiet rumble. His accent is Cape Town. \"This is big, you know?\"\n\nYears of diplomatic experience suppress any off-the-cuff responses and instead recall an ambassadorial frequent flyer:\n\n\"I understand.\" \n\nWe have reached the point of no return. It is an unremarkable brown metal door with a long horizontal push bar to open it. I have no idea what waits for me behind that door. I don't even have time for a deep breath before Joe pushes it open. \nPart 1/2",

                    "comment": "The smell of coffee tickles my nose. The good stuff from Zambia. I close my eyes, take that long, deep breath, and exhale. When I reopen my eyes, the smile on my face is genuine, put there by the warming scent of my comfort beverage.\n\n\"Good morning,\" I say politely. \n\nInstead of the single envoy I expected, there are three people standing on the far side of the lavishly decked breakfast buffet: a tall white gentleman in his late sixties, a short lady of East Asian heritage in her seventies, and a sinewy man with russet skin and a tooth-paste commercial smile who looks young enough to be my son. \n\n\"I hope you had a pleasant journey. My name is Thembeka Kamau.\"\n\nThe old gentleman is the first to step around the table and reaches out an enormous hand. After a moment's hesitation, I decide to reach out and shake it. We rarely shake hands anymore. It's such a careless way to spread disease.\n\n\"Pleasure,\" he says, \"Marcus Collins, Secretary of State for the Federation of Christian America. This is A...\" \n\n\"Amanda Chu,\" the woman interrupts him in a resonant baritone with a stern nod of her head. \"Minister of Cultural Affairs for the Republic of the Western and Pacific States.\" \n\nI vaguely feel the loss of pressure as Secretary Collins releases my hand. Without letting my shock reflect on my expression, I turn to the young man. \n\n\"Isaac Newton, no relation, Ambassador for the United States of America. That's the original 13 plus 3, in case you were wondering.\" He finishes with a jaunty little wave of his hand. \n\n\"It's a pleasure to make all your acquaintance,\" I say through the smile that is now permanently carved into the muscles around my mouth. \"Coffee?\" \n\n\"Yes, please.\" \n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" \n\n\"No, thanks. I'm gonna go with orange juice.\" \n\nThe awkward exchange stumbles through the room like the drunken uncle at a family gathering.\n\n\"So,\" says Mr. Newton, \"Which country are you from, and where is everyone? I thought this was supposed to be a get to know you again mixer type of thing.\" His hands gesture avidly as he jerks his head to indicate the relatively empty room. \n\n\"Um,\" I hum, my throat going dry as I look into the expectant faces in front of me. \n\nJesus, three different Americas, and here I thought the Republic of Unified Korea was going to be hard to explain.\n\n\"I'm, personally, from South Africa.\"\n\n\"No kidding! Your English is perfect.\" \n\nI take a deep breath and forgo a response to that comment. Minister Chu's toneless huff does a pretty good job of voicing my feelings. \n\n\"However,\" I continue in a calm tone with my hands folded in a non-threatening manner in front of me, \"I am here in my capacity as an ambassador to represent the United Nations in our rapprochement talks with ... you.\"\n\n\"Wait, what?\" \n\n\"Excuse me?\" \n\n\"I apologize, ma'am, I must not have heard you right.\" \n\nIt takes every ounce of willpower not to take a step back from the rising voice of Secretary Collins. Behind the thin veneer of politeness, I can feel the weight of his anger shift every muscle and bone in his very large frame, poising for a fight. \n\nI did not want this job. I can't begin to express how much I did not want this job.\n\n\"I understand that this is upsetting.\" \n\n\"Upsetting?\" Minister Chu makes another huffing noise and rounds the table. \"Being stuck in traffic on the 5 is upsetting. Losing the Superbowl to the friggin' Texans is upsetting.\" Her head snaps to Mr. Collins, \"No offense.\" \n\n\"None taken, ma'am.\" \n\nHer dark eyes glitter with barely suppressed rage. \"This is an outrage!\" Her fist slams into the table, rattling the dishes.\n\nJoe's hand moves to his belt somewhere in the corner of my eye, but a quick hand motion and a vehement headshake keep him at bay. I'm waiting for Mr. Newton's reaction. He's been completely quiet after his initial reaction. \n\n\"Really?\" he finally asks, surprise and hurt written plain and large on his young features. \n\nIt strikes me harder than the anger and resentment of his fellows. I hang my head, trying to come up with words. I didn't make the decision, but now I have been put in a position where I am forced to defend it or at least to explain the reasoning. What can I say? How the fuck did anyone think this was a good idea?\n\n\"Why?\" His voice breaks. \n\nI slowly lift my head, preparing to face the devastating gaze of the next generation demanding answers. \n\nA bolt of lightning sears through me when I realize Mr. Newton is looking at all three of us. He shakes his head, hands gesturing in aborted motions between Minister Chu, Secretary Collins, and me. \n\n\"How? How did you let this happen?\" \n\nI wish I had an answer for that. \n\nThe End  Part 2/2",

            "comment": "It all started in the middle of a Nuclear Disarmament conference, they had started to finally believe that both North Korea and Iran were being honest about dismantling their nuclear and ICBM ambitions, man, were they wrong. They just wanted to catch us off guard, they both launched missiles simultaneously, Iran targeted Jerusalem and Riyadh, while the PRK aimed for Okinawa and Tokyo, there may have been other targets, many facts have been lost to history, but those are the places that did get hit, Luckily there were some vigilant soldiers who got the missile defenses booted up in time to prevent any other missiles from hitting their targets. \n\nThey managed to get just enough of a handle on things to keep anyone else from using nukes, but as far as peace, there was little chance, as soon as we had missiles headed back in retaliation China's Navy started attacking anything with a U.S. Flag that they saw, and in the meantime, they started smuggling carriers of engineered biological weapons into the U.S. through both Mexico and Canada, which also took a large toll on the populations in those countries, and spurred a panic that led to large scale infections in all First world, and many developing counties. Russia withdrew into itself, attacking anyone who got close, but never venturing out looking for a fight, but they'd been fooled as well, and knew that getting into a drawn out war would hurt them more than it would ever help, they'd just liked the idea of backing Iran as a deterrent to further U.S. Intervention in the middle east, they too were badly affected by the plague that was spreading... \n\nIran imploded after they launched their missiles, the population decided that they'd rather fight and die than let their government take them all the way down the path to ruin, Sadly though, the Mullahs had already fulfilled their promise to wipe Israel off the map. And what was left of the IDF was to busy treating wounded, regardless of heritage, and trying to protect what was left of their people from revitalized Hamas and Hezzbollah terrorists to even consider retaliating anyway.\n\nSaudi Arabia, deprived of it's seat of power, and Royal Family, Collapsed in on itself as well, as local Chieftains cropped up and tried to impose their own particular brand of Sharia law onto anyone within their sphere of influence. And such was the case throughout the rest of the middle east as well, being as the powers that had been there to keep them united, whether in support of or opposition to, were all either gone or too busy elsewhere to bother.\n\nNorth Korea, naturally started pushing south, they made headway due to the large number of their forces, but were doomed to fail from the beginning, they did however, manage to cut the population of South Korea in half, mostly due to targeting the large urban centers.\n\nOne thing that large scale wars always do is show you where people's true loyalties lie, most of Europe violated their NATO obligations, and decided to sit it out. Japan on the other hand, gave their all to the fight, but were soon overwhelmed being as their military may have been advanced and skilled, it was small in number due to their declining population. \n\nAs soon as we started making a decent push back against the Chinese, the U.N. Decided to step in against the U.S. of course, they tried to assign all blame for the War on the U.S., solely because we had been the only Superpower and if we had just done \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthat\u201d differently \u201cWe\u201d could have prevented it, the vote was nearly unanimous. Our few Allies were by that point too afraid to go against the majority, and we were too fed up with dealing with them that we chose to not even bother using our Security Council Veto... Well, it was decided after that that all countries would take a 50 year break from each other, and we'd meet back up after that time to see if we should go back to business as normal, or just resume our isolation.\n\nAs I'm sure everyone knows by now, that 50 years is almost up, and while we've maintained our physical and 2 way communication isolation, we have been keeping a as close an eye on the outside world as we could. Naturally, the other countries that \u201cin good faith\u201d pledged to stay isolated, didn't, most tried, but being as the U.S. Was sidelined, and actually keeping it's side of the bargain, certain world forces rose up to fill the vacuum of power, namely, The Islamic Caliphate, it started as many disparate bands in many countries throughout the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and even Australia, there was no one left with the will to fight back, they transcended Race, they would accept anyone who was willing to convert and pickup arms on their behalf, their culture is death and destruction, taking whoever and whatever they wanted, while claiming it was in service to their \u201cgod\u201d, rape and pillage is a strong recruitment tool in a world where everything is in ruins and there is very little government with a will to even attempt fighting back. They all took over the majority of the world in 30 years, and now it appears they are starting to join forces and look toward our shores... \n\nLuckily for us, we had a culture of our own that was regaining steam as well, it too transcended race, but not only race, religion as well (Granted, Islam is at it's very core Authoritarian, so they weren't included), it was a culture of Liberty, but not without a mind for staying prepared against outside threats,. We rebuilt, we innovated, developed new technologies, geared to both raising our standard of living and defense, each borrowing from the other as necessary, we borrowed from Switzerland the idea of training and arming our entire population, and this started even before we realized fully what was happening in the world around us. Now we are at the point that we have 2 options, either venture out into the world to confront this imminent threat and free the oppressed who have refused to convert, or abandon it all together and head towards The Stars, in hopes of finding a new home where we can be free of Authoritarianism. A few even think there may be a third option, send out the ships, but have others remain to try a salvage this world, but very few think it's worth it...",

            "comment": "Every country must close its borders, communications, trade, and embassies for 50 years.  \n\nThe United States's president was boycotting the peace conference, against most of the country's wishes.  The declining prestige of the country abroad was all too apparent, even before the Great Conflict.  The war lasted 6 years, and no country gained or lost any ground after the first day. Nearly half a billion died, and it finally took riots in the streets to force some governments to call back troops. \n\nEvery country, save the United States, convened in Beijing to discuss the terms.  They decided American Imperialism must come to an end.  Japan and Korea would split the islands in the Pacific, and the New Soviet Republic would be given Alaska, amputating America to its mainland body.  In an inspiring speech to the diplomats present, the leader of France took advantage of the States' absence to propose a plan that would cut off American influence even more.  They would convince American leadership that each country should have a period of isolation, to rebuild themselves and prevent further conflicts for the next half century. \n\nOnly the United States would actually go into isolation.  The rest of the world would finally be rid of the thorn in the West they've all come to know.  \n\nA lot got completed during the 50 years of freedom, which was the name the New Powers gave to the period.  China completed its huge infrastructure projects thanks to absorbing the USA's trade power vacuum.   The Middle East stabilized and the countries solar panel networks together to encourage cooperation and peace.  The NSR had free reign of the Balkany.  Every country and its citizens agreed that the 50 years of freedom was the greatest joint-diplomatic effort in history.\n\nThe world eagerly awaited when those 50 years ended.  Some of them \n\n\"Leave it to bureaucracy to try to jam as many meetings as they can together, right?  The terms said we'd start with one on one meetings with leaders, to ease into it, not a goddamn round table meeting. I only brought a human translator for Japanese, and there are 50 different countries here,\" the President complained to the Empress of England, who drew the short straw and had to sit next to America.\n\nThe Empress looked around nervously, but nobody at the table would make eye contact.  Understandably, their eyes were locked on the American, who looked slightly out of place, wearing a suit and tie that went out of style decades ago. \n\n\"Now I'm going to sound like a robot when I'm tying up old trade deals,\" he said, before blinking a deliberately a few times and fiddling with his watch.  \"Where's the tradition?  Where's the elegance?\"\n\nThe 48 other diplomats at the table almost jumped out of their seats in shock.  They had heard the American's questions in their home country's language, although it sounded slightly digital.  \n\n\"I'm really glad we all agreed to this isolation thing,\" he continued. \"You wouldn't believe how much our old government spent on our military.  We've been an isolationist country far longer than we were an imperialistic one.  We didn't really know what to do with it all that extra money.  The country voted to just put it all in education,\" he prattled, \"I'm excited for international markets to open back up.  GM-Ford-Tesla-NASA designed these great solar powered dronemobiles, just put the backpack on and say where you need to go. We don't even need cars anymore!  Cars!  I know I sound like I'm bragging but what was the 50 years was for, if not for bragging rights when it's through?\"",

The problem is how funding is given out, the good school get better funding because they get better grades, the bad schools get less funding because they get worse grades. \n\nThe merit based system is all and good but the school I went to for high school was a top 10 ranked school, they spent the money they got from the governemnt on stadiums and fields, none of it went to actually bettering education.

My school had a fundraiser where the students raised 10k and it was spent on a billboard for announcements outside the school. \n\nI'm hoping if we did increase the funding for schools the merit system would become less important and more schools could spend more on education. It might also help to have a few restrictions on how schools can spend money\n",

We're a large country of 330 million people; why is it surprising that an America could prosper when fully focusing on itself without foreign aid, military expenditures or foreign market volatility interfering with our own advancement?\n\nThe only thing I could see happening is an energy shortage; renewed focus on green energy (wind on the plains; hydeoelectric by rivers and coastline; solar in the desert southwest) could make up part of that and focus on decentralizing the office space could remove a lot of energy waste on the back end.\n\nBy contrast, you'd also lose access to US foreign aid, universities, hospitals, and corporate investment outside the states.

            "comment": "John saved enough money for the last 45 years to go live in one of the last cities that still existed near the frontier of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was now time to actually go there, although it was still 8 months until the official event in which the US would open his doors to the world, and viceversa.\r\n\r\nAt the time the Treaty for the World Peace and Reconstruction was implemented, no one was really expecting that the US would be the only country isolated. No one felt it was the right thing, but since the US was the one to launch missiles first, no one was really against it either.\r\n\r\nExcept obviously, those who had family in the US, such as soldiers and diplomats stranded at the end of the war in other countries.\r\n\r\r\nJohn was one of them. He left his wife and still unborn child in the US when he was assigned to an abroad mission near the end of the war. And when it ended, he couldn't go back home because of the treaty. No one goes in, no one goes out.\r\n\r\nBut he grew anxious over the last few months the Treaty was supposed to last. He was merely weeks away of reuniting with his family, and the fact he was just a few hundred miles from the wall that separated the US and the rest of the wolrd made it no easier.\r\n\r\nHe decided to take the risk and drive to the wall. Maybe that would calm his heart for the remaining time.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the wall he was detained by a security patrol. Must've a private one, because they had a symbol he had never seen before.\r\n\r\nThey took him to a building near the wall. They asked him why he was there, and what he knew of what was inside the wall.\rThen they led him to another building where they conducted some medical tests on him.\r\n\r\n\"These last weeks a lot of folks like you have showed up\" the medic that was performing the tests said.\r\n\r\n\"At first the government tried to keep them away from the wall, but now that the big day is coming, they can't just drive them away from it. So instead, they bring them here to at least ensure they don't carry potential diseases unknown to the inhabitants of the US, if they still call themselves like that-\"\r\n\r\n\"Ben, we need you now!\" Said another medic as he busted into the room. \n\n\"The class D expedition group is back, and we need  you to test the new anomalies!\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it Greg. Can't you see I'm with a civilian right now? Now we have to give him amnesiacs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I know, but do you remember the guy in the expedition that was missing an eye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, what with him? Did he grow it back?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but he grew another head that is convinced he is Nicholas Cage!\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn, I have to see that\"\r\n\r\nHe turned back to John.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, normally we would just send you on your way-\".\r\n\r\n\"But we have no option now. Even if you heard just a little, what is going here goes beyond you comprehension. I mean, we have more than half of the world leaders working for the Foundation, helping to contain whatever is inside those walls and protecting people like you. And even the foundation goes as far as making the world believe every 50 years that the last 50 years never happened so the Treaty for World Peace and Reconstruction can go on and no one tries to go inside the walls. And yet the Foundation still has no fucking idea what is going inside the walls with SC-\"\r\n\r\n\"Great work Greg, now he has heard too much. Why did you told him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where erasing his memory anyway. It doesn't matter. Now can we go? I want to hear that head proclaim it has the declaration of independence before the boys cut it out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that, both medics left.\r\n\r\nJohn didn't know what to think. Was it a prank? Or was something really going on?\r\n\r\nHe didn't had time to think it anyways as two men wearing security uniforms took him elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis time he had a better glance at their badges. A circle with three arrows pointing to the center, alongside the name and motto of the company they worked for.\r\n\r\n*SCP Foundation. Secure. Contain. Protect.*\n\n_This is my first time writing an original writing prompt. Also please keep in mind English is not my first language, so any feedback and criticism is appreciated._",

            "comment": "I sit at the bar, eyes glued to the television screen as the count down clock reached one hour.  \"Could you save my spot?\" I ask the bar tender in my unmistakably american accent that elicited a shocked reaction from some of the other patrons.  \"Sure thing\" the bartender responded.  The bar wasn't dead but it was understandably quite empty at 11:00 AM.  Knowing my spot wouldn't be disturbed, I got up to go use the toilets.\nMy mind was racing, would I finally be able to go home after 50 years?  Would home even be the same, what is it like now?  I remember my last night in The States, I was my 21st birthday and I knew I would be shipped off to join the Air Force the next day.  Drinking the night away, making drunken goodbyes to old friends, I never imagined all of them would be final.  The war had been raging for a little under a year at that point but things were already escalating and there was even talk of bringing back the draft so I preemptively joined the Air Force so I could at least choose which branch of service.  I became a pilot and was assigned to fly the A-10 warthog which was brought back into service due to the need for more aircraft after being fazed out 5 years prior.  I flew hundreds of missions providing air support for ground troops, before being shot down over Tyrol Austria.  I was MIA for 3 months, 2 weeks of which I spent lost, injured and starving.  To this day I don't know how I survived but eventually I was found, unconscious and naked on the side of the road, by an Austrian farmer.  He took me in and nursed me back to health.  The real kicker is that the peace treaty was in the process of being signed, 4 days after I was shot down, the final shot of World War III was fired.  \nThe plan for American exile was played close to the chest, it had to seem like everyone was doing it so that the Americans wouldn't get suspicious, only the non American heads of state of the Big 6, the major alliance that won the war which included America, UK, Australia, Canada, France and Germany, knew of the actual plan.  Everyone was given 2 months to return to the nation of their citizenship or emigrate to the country of their choice before the isolation pact was to go into effect.  I did not make it home, I was one of the 1,380 Americans who were \"left behind\".  We were offered a 5 year visa with the promise of citizenship to any country we wanted, I chose the UK.  An unintended consequence of the secrecy of the isolation pact was that many companies decided to move to America because they were the world's largest economy.  Almost overnight, major companies like BMW, YKK, and Airbus moved to America, while companies like McDonald pulled out of foreign markets to be in compliance with the treaty.  This caused a massive 10 year depression and made the already massive task of rebuilding almost impossible.  Eventually companies rose to fill the gap that had been made and began to rebuild, but at that point much of the world was unrecognizable.  Many parts of the world looked like something out of the old Fallout games, governments collapsed, the EU dissolved, Russia was split into 15 smaller states and the scorched earth policy in China made it uninhabitable and hundreds of millions of Chinese refugees fled to Europe.  It took 30 years to rebuild.  Now, most of the world looks the same as it did pre-war, except modern culture was heavily influenced by the influx of Chinese refugees who integrated well into society but kept a lot of their customs, traditions and food.\n\"You going to go back to America after the isolation pact is lifted?\" the bartender asked, bringing me back to reality.  \"I don't know, I've lived here most of my life, and besides, what is a 79 year old retired man going to do?  Move into a house I'll only live in for a few more years?  And I already have a family here, I'm rooted here now, but on the other hand I yearn to return to my home country\".  My eyes turn to the television screen as the countdown reads: 0:00:03... 0:00:02... 0:00:01...\n\nThis is my first time responding to a writing prompt and just decided to try my hand at writing.  Sorry if it is bad.",

            "comment": "50 years of isolation between the United States and the rest of the world was the best thing that ever happened to us. The United States was mocked endlessly by much of the rest of the world, despised by its rivals, and even by its own citizens' accounts, the country had serious problems. There was a growing disconnect between it and its allies. When it came down to it, their account of the events of the Eregenor situation was irreconcilable with our own. We simply couldn't possibly believe that the damning evidence that was presented against the United States was false, that is was some ridiculous plot by Russia, China, North Korea, and various other countries to try to make a world where they were in charge. World War 3 was hardly a bloodless war, but when the United States made the unthinkable call to deploy nuclear weapons once again to \"prevent loss of life\", much of the world was shocked and outraged. Was America willing to annihilate anyone who spoke against them?\n\nFormer allies, worried that they may become enemies and face the same fate, came together with other representatives in secret, devising a plan. They agreed, reluctantly, that a program of isolation would be proposed in the UN, which would cut off all communication, and any who violated it would face stiff consequences. It would be sold to the U.S. as a positive thing- there was a tide of isolationism forming from internal anti-war sentiment and the criticism expressed by the rest of the world. The country felt that it was better off just taking care of itself... and with most of its enemies flattened, and none wanting it meddling in world affairs, it took a not entirely unwelcome chance to exit stage right. \n\nDuring the war, the U.S. had already been forced to deal with shortages and the end of many trade agreements it had become reliant on, and this combined with a helping of nationalistic pride gave confidence that the country could and should depend on its own resources going into the future. There were shortages for years afterwards; it was a shock to go from 0.6 USD per liter of gasoline [Author note: Using today's units for this] to a peak of ten times that, with how accustomed to cheap fuel the population was, with few remembering even the relatively minor panic of the 70's. It was a stressful time, but luckily the fertile soil was enough that for all the problems that were had, enough food was produced within the country and distributed by an evolved form of the wartime rationing board that starvation wasn't the serious threat it could otherwise have been. There wasn't a large supply of consumer electronics and goods, but there wasn't as much demand for such things when there was the more immediate concern of the economic upheaval of disconnecting a country from the global economy semi-permanently. \n\nBut eventually a new status quo formed, where excess wasn't as tolerated, there were vastly more jobs to do than people to do them at every skill level, and where trimming the fat in government while investing into education and technology was seen as the logical way to improve, now that there were no sources for anything the country couldn't do for itself. Somehow a culture shift that brought together a more unified national identity overtook the United States in its period of isolation while the rest of the world, as connected as ever, divided into factions, squabbling in the power vacuum. \n\nThe U.S. government must surely have instantly been aware what was truly going on; it's impossible in today's world to be so blind; but they in their own private meetings agreed it was worth playing dumb. It took far less than 50 years for the general public to become aware that it was the only one to have been isolated, but silence cuts both ways. As long as America was silent, nobody paid much attention. And so it quietly worked through its problems, which seemed so simple once it came right down to it, and began to prepare for the future. Canada was an essential part of the plan. The United States and Canada were too closely entwined to keep perfect isolation, and while for the first few years they shared nothing but information and what basic supplies could be covertly traded, eventually Canada served as a proxy buyer for whatever resources that couldn't be bought any other way. Of course, the fact that crucial international companies were American at heart did help. This was how America managed to advance so far in computer technology, making quantum computing practical and making incredible process in some aspects of nanoscale science. The upshot is both organic and inorganic programmable machines, vastly improved metamaterials (carbon based metas really took off with the shortages of certain elemental materials, for instance), slowed aging, the ability to break conventional encryption and to create unbreakable encryption in turn, and many open avenues of research into things which might have seemed like science fiction in the beginning of the twenty first century. When the rest of the world was ready, and snooping seemed to indicate they would be about as ready as could be hoped for, we would welcome them, and share what we had learned.\n\n\n[Auth - I need to get some sleep. I hope you like it; maybe I'll continue later on. Either way, I think it's a lot less depressing than some of the other stories, even if it's no more realistic than they.]",

Fresh water, disarments, and a more peaceful world. But all good things must come to an end. Our 50 years without them was up. But it did not go the way we expected.\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.......\n\nAmerica changed under isolation. They realized they need to stop creating weapons and decided to move to their second best skill. We were unprepared for it.                   \n\n....\n\nTHE MEMES. 50 years of dank American Memes they wanted to catch us up on. It happened so fast. They spread like a wildfire the moment the border dropped spreading memes to every country on Earth. It was chaos. Within 24 hours half of the total population was obsessed with memes. They were as far as the eye could see. How many memes did America make while they were in isolation? Was there even an answer?",

            "comment": "50 long years. Thomas rolled out of his bunk. Today was the day America was going to join the rest of the world. He was excited, but a little afraid. As an American, it had been schooled into him that what had happened 51 years prior was one of the largest wars known, World War III, and that America had been the first to strike. In 2028, the leaders of the remaining nations had all agreed, each country was to go into isolation. No trade, communication, or aid, whatsoever. America had agreed, and had built massive walls in the North and South. They had severed communication with all satellites, and cut all lines outside of the US. Alaska was given to Canada, and Hawaii was allowed to be its own nation once more. Puerto Rico had protested at first, but soon gave up. According to his grandpa, the US suffered the first couple of years. Technology development had gone down, with agriculture having a huge boom to support its population. Most people left the cities, leaving them to become ruins. The only cities that thrived were towards the center of the country. This made life very simple. You attended school until 12, and then you picked a specialization. There were three to choose from. You could be a farmer, which was the most noble and useful, a rememberer, whose job was to learn all of the old things, so when the walls came down, we could talk to our neighbors and work old technology, and soldiers, who were those who didn\u2019t have what it took to do the other things.\n\nThomas wasn\u2019t ashamed to be a soldier, he couldn\u2019t grow a potato, and words and numbers annoyed him. Besides, he would be one of the first to see a Canadian. He grabbed his issued jackhammer, and headed for his station.\n\nAt midnight, walls started coming down. Within the next two days, they were nothing more than rubble, that was quickly being removed. Oddly, there had been nobody to greet them, but this had been anticipated seeing as how had caused most of the damage in the war. In the next three days, the American military had sent out ambassador convoys North into Canada, and South to Mexico, neither had found anything except countries being reclaimed by nature. Almost two weeks later, the rememberers had finally reestablished communication of the one satellite they had been allowed to keep in orbit. North Americas whole portion of the globe was dark. Thomas kept rereading the communal paper, surely they were not the only ones left? The next day, they got the answers they were looking for. Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia were also dark. Thomas, and many other Americans wept.  \n\nEdit: Figured I would mass respond to this. The ending was left open to interpretation, kind of like a Miyazaki film. ",

            "comment": "\tIt began with a first strike nuclear attack on North Korea and their immediately retaliation. Guam and Hawaii were obliterated but Alaska was spared as the missile sent towards it simply failed and dropped into the North Pacific. Fortunately, for the United States at least, none of North Korea\u2019s missiles had the range to reach the continent. This initial exchange set in place the chain of events that we\u2019ve come to know as World War III as existing alliances and allegiances were brought to play and sides were chosen. Fortunately, the this was the only time nuclear weapons were used in the conflict. President Trump would later say that the initial strike had been an accident and that the war that followed wasn\u2019t his fault. Any statements to the contrary were simply \u201cFake News!\u201d\n\t\u201cThe Great Accord\u201d as it became known was settled that fall in Ottawa. Each country would agree to maintaining isolation for a period of fifty years. The citizens of each country would be required to stay within the current physical boundaries of their countries. Internet service would be firewalled and contained within those same geographical regions. Agreement was nearly unanimous although there were a number of concessions made before the accord was signed by all nations. The strictest concessions came from America itself which demanded that an agreement alone was not sufficient to enforce this. Physical deterrence was required as well. They insisted that the borders be enforced through impenetrable walls, automated weapons systems, and EMF jammers.\n\tAs the Greatest Country On Earth\u00ae, America demanded that they be the first to have these measures put into place. The walls were the most complicated and astounding pieces of engineering ever created. They were over 50 feet tall, 10 feet wide and covered the Northern and Southern borders from sea to sea. Built to withstand natural and manmade disasters for at least a century they were practically indestructible. Ocean platforms with the same weapons and jamming systems were placed out to the edge of international waters, a wall being completely impractical in that environment. When they were finally completed on August 23, 2025 America was separated from the rest of the world in every practical way.\n\tEnforcement of \u201cThe Great Accord\u201d was an international effort and the building of these walls took up a significant portion of the funding the member countries had allotted for that purpose. By the time the job was completed the member countries began to question if these walls were even necessary. After all, how would America know that they hadn\u2019t gone through with it? Besides, they were the only ones to really wanted these walls in the first place. It was this line of questioning that led to a revised version of \u201cThe Great Accord\u201d stripping out the walls and relaxing a great many of the restrictions that had been put initially into place. Within a decade \u201cThe Great Accord\u201d had been abolished completely and normal trade and relations resumed. Only America remained isolated, hidden behind its massive walls.\n\tThe world slowly returned to normalcy, as the balance of power shifted to account for a world without America. In its absence, China took its place as the economic, military, and social power. Mandarin became the new language of international trade, business, and science. The shift to Easternization came slowly but certainly as eastern culture and ideas predominated along with the language. Like most change, this was met with resistance. This resistance turned into strife and in time war. China and the European Union clashed in a war that made the last seem like a child\u2019s game. When the dust had settled only China and Russia remained with control all of the countries of the world split between them. Only America remained isolated, hidden behind its massive walls.\n\tWhen August 23rd 2075 arrived, the world had all but forgotten that America even existed. The walls had just been such a normal part of life that \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430 and \u58a8\u897f\u54e5 just took them for granted. At exactly 11:13AM MDT the massive metal gates located on the northern end of the Bridge of the Americas creaked open. Just inside the gates a lone figure sits on a lawn chair with a beach umbrella protecting him from the midday sun. A podium sits a dozen feet in front of him. He sips from a glass of cold lemonade as he waits for the inevitable media flurry. He doesn\u2019t need to wait long as police and reporters throughout town rush to the gate.\u201c\u58f0\u660e!!!\u201d they cry out as the figure waits until a sizable crowd has gathered. He steps up to a podium and begins to speak.\n\t\u201cI apologize but I don\u2019t speak Mexican. Anyways, I may not be president anymore but I\u2019m still Trump. And I\u2019ve got something I need to get off my chest.\u201d He stops to look over the audience and make eye contact with the camera with the best angle. \u201cI told you, you\u2019d pay for it.\u201d",

Imagine our surprise when it did...\"*\n\nI down the little plastic shot cup of Daniels in my hand and toss it into the Recycler as I walk out of the bar. The little intern employed to shadow me follows on my footsteps, stumbling with her books. I chuckle to myself and wait for her to regain her footing before continuing out of the bar. \n\nWe make our way across the new London Bridge, named after the old one which had been decimated by the War that emcompassed the world. It had been 50 years since \"Maelstrom\" but the scars on my back ached as if I had only gotten the injuries yesterday. \n\n*\"50 years. 50 years for each country to rebuild itself and re-discover who we were as a people. At least, so went the official story. We just wanted the end to it all. The hate, the bigotry, everything. America was, and for reconcillation sake I hope they have re-discovered this, a bastion of freedom and democracy and equal justice for every man. But somewhere down the line, that ideology had been warped for evil. For hate.\"*\n\nI stop and look over the edge of the bridge, straining to see if I can see my reflection on the surface of the dark blue river. The sunset behind me casts the long shadow of the bridge on the surface and all I see is just a flowing darkness. The bridge itself, while structurally sound, could still not match the class nor fame of its predecessor. Britain had mourned its people, its infrastructure... but the pain of losing the bridge and the palace never waned. It just waxed stronger. \n\nI glance at the intern who had chosen to also look into the waters. She is one of the younglings born years after the war. Early enough to see the rebuilding begin anew. Her historical knowledge was young, bolstered only by the books she now carried. \n\nBefore I can look away, I see her lips move and I hear the question come through...\n\n*\"I have heard about how the Thames used to be murky looking. But this is all I've ever seen. How could the world change so much in 50 years? I have seen the old maps. I have heard what happened to...to... Haiti? How could it be so different to 50 years ago?\"*\n\n*\"When you lose half the population, geographical ego stops being a factor. After Italy, Canada, Nigeria, Mexico and Germany... I don't even know if you've seen a map of those countries. After the fake treaty of 'locking' our borders and 'retreating' from the world, the rest of the countries came together to heal. We owed it to our people, our countries and to the revolutionaries who had come before us to warn about the dangers of hate and war.\"*\n\n*\"Couldn't America be part of it?\"*\n\n*\"They could be. They could have been. But a myriad of factors had dictated that it wouldn't be in our best interest to include them. They had forsaken the very ideas they had been founded on. They had become brash and proud and bitter. They had fashioned themselves the leaders of the world. Quick to act but slow to consider all options. They could have been part of us, but when their first words out of the war demanded reparations for an event they started... it was then we knew what needed to be done.\"*\n\n*\"...The 50 year agreement ends in 12 hours, sir... What happens when they re-connect with the world and see all that has been accomplished since then? What if they deem us evil for secluding them?\"*\n\n*\"And then we will tell them why. They would have no choice but to accept it.\"*, I say stretching and indicating we keep walking down the bridge. \n\n*\"What if they don't accept it?\"* She asks, tentatively. \n\n*\"Then we do what they attempted to do 50 years ago and almost succeeded doing...\"*\n\n*\"...which is?\"*\n\nI look at her as I feel the bitterness rise inside me. \n\n*\"We'll wipe them off the map.\"*\n\n-----\n\nIt's been a while since I wrote so please critique away. i need to flex my writing muscle :)\n\n/r/EvenAsIWrite for more of this stuff",

A new company headed by a Davy Daniels started a new venture to compensate for the lack of Jack Daniels due to the Isolation Treaty. He kept the \"Jack Daniels\" name and branding but couldn't quite get the taste and texture right.\n\nThey marketed on the fact that there were no more Jacks lying around. The first few years after the war were difficult due to humans being creatures of habit and they couldn't just accept the new alternative that wasn't even close to the original. To counter this, Davy Daniels decided to drop \"jack\" from the title and work on creating a whiskey to surpass the original. \n\nThis was the result. ",

            "comment": "Their fields are empty, white wastes sowed with the salt of the long years. For all the miles they could see, they see nothing but an endless world. This should please them, you would think. But there is something coursing through the air, a wind rising in the heavens above. Maybe they can taste it. Perhaps that is why they cry. They can feel their abandonment.\n\n\nThe world watches for I know I am not the only eyes. In our towers in the Far World, we see the specks roam, little mites mustering the courage to leave their bunkers. See how the light hits them. See their flag fly high in the open lands. \n\n\n*America,* I think. \n\n\nLong ago, my family was American. I feel some sadness to them. The gates to heaven have closed. Our world is leaving, and our goodbyes nearly spent. But see them come. See the war torn land all brown and turned, stony and wild. Look at them look for us. See the mites fall in confusion.\n\n\nAnd if you hear my words and sense some bitterness in them, then I shan't pretend to hide it. The War had taken much from me. All that I loved is gone. But such is war. And such was the American war.\n\n\nAnd if you hear my words and my words echo in the stillness of the deserted lands, then let me explain. For you are unlucky, perhaps even a child, born innocent, condemned to die. For that you deserve some solace. Solace is all I can give.\n\n\nWhen the War had ended, half the world had died. Their screams and chemical shadows haunted the peace, and what talks were held were facetious. We knew this world was gone. What good was dismantling bombs when the knowledge would forever remain? We had to leave. The Sun was growing warmer, the days going quicker in the silence of burying the dead.\n\n\nWe had to leave.\n\n\nAfter the War ended what countries remained made a very hard decision. We banded together after Lucifer's Week. That was the week where a new bomb fell every day. We decided everything had to end. For humanity to survive, we would have to leave our human home. This we agreed with heavy hearts.\n\n\nAnd we gritted our teeth and negotiated with the Americans. If you are reading this amidst the lonely plains, then know we negotiated with your fathers. We gave them everything they wanted, placated their fancies, and pleaded and begged in all the right ways for just one  favor: for us all to isolate ourselves for fifty years.\n\n\nThe Americans thought they had won. You all could never accept the idea of loss, or even *compromise*. And so they agreed. They thought in the dark, with all the world fragmented, they would grow even more powerful. And perhaps they have.\n\n\nBut we had deceived them. In those fifty years they had caged themselves, and we worked freely on creating vast ships to take us off this failing planet.\n\n\nCancers are on the rise. Most lands are dead, barren like so many women who were cowed in the final bunkers. Most lands are dead, same as those women. Same as my only love.\n\n\nAnd we have built great towers in what pockets of life that still remain. Great spires to the heavens house our ever readying ships. And now as the nights come cold and the frost heavy with the ghosts of the dead, and the heavy feeling of time running out, we have completed those ships. We ready ourselves for the journey come. Just as You have awakened.\n\n\nSo now see the American stretch. See how the land sprawls in a lonely plateau.  Hear the silence and breathe the abundant air. I wonder how it feels. What butterflies they must have. Are You looking for us? Or is there just confusion, or even knowing?\n\n\nThe world turns in silence. Age has taken my hair, my health and my dreams, but it has not taken that fire and that hatred the War has wrought. I listen to the quiet. I feel the shadows from the great tower. It is dark here, soft purple dusk sprayed upon a cozy idea of hope. I feel the rumble of the engines start, hear the crew announce the test has been a success.\n\n\nWe will leave soon. I will go and leave my home behind. But in the days remaining, I look and I stare. \n\n\nThe fields sway in the night's wind. The moon is further than it ever has been. The stars blanket the black. There is a loneliness upon the land. The metal doors sigh. The Americans come out bewildered. They try their phones but no one answers. See how long their shadows are. See them search for that neighborly love. I wonder what they think. I wonder if they know.\n\n\nThe ships will leave the day after tomorrow. The Sun will eat this Earth. We have burned all our intelligence, and have left no hope as to where we will go. Let the Americans have this planet. Let the temperature rise and engulf them. Perhaps their sweat shall stay their tears. But let them have this world. They have fought so hard for it.\n\n\nAnd let them look to the sky as we leave. See them look in hope at the marvel of the shooting stars. Let them wish for a good life and for contact as soon as possible. Give them their hope. It is all they have.\n\n\n-\n\n\n*Hi there!

            "comment": "We had received three messages since the national isolation program began. The first was only a year into our ordeal and was innocuous enough. Germany wanted to restart the cotton trade since their climate couldn't handle growing their own and their factories were sitting idle. Our leaders conferred and decided that couldn't hurt so long as all other nations were made aware and also allowed access. \n\nThey held a meeting to hammer out the details and we learned that South Korea had made a fantastically small implantable device that allowed hands-free access to the Internet. Our leaders procured some shipments of those, labeled \"Special American Version\" that were limited to our own fragment of the Internet. \n\nMine itched. Today was the day when the walls came down and the whole Internet could come together again and it had already started an update. The world would be a brand new place after fifty years in isolation. We offered to help rebuild Africa after the war as a form of reparations, but they insisted we stay out of it. \n\nThe second message was about fifteen years in and much more somber. A global messenger was sent to inform world leaders that the People's Honorable Democratic Republic of the Congo was struggling in their isolation and attacked Kenya to take their oil reserves. We were glad that the isolation protocols were so strictly upheld and no other nation intervened, or it would have been disastrous. As it was, Kenya was glassed. We were also glad that we expanded our military and some of our own offshore production to stay neutral on the oil trade, or that could have been us. \n\nAs an aside in that missive, it was noted that Israel no longer existed without American support as the Middle East solved their Jewish problem. Palestine was quickly established. There was a bit of an uproar at the time and talk of breaking Iso, but it was quickly forgotten. \n\nThe third message was really the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. It turned out that there were some \"tourists\" who kept trying to get into the American Iso, but were usually caught fairly quick. They would pass news of things happening in overcrowded China and India and the Great European Migration, but those things were written off as fantasy. How could they leave their Iso? Tales of their wars were equally far-fetched. \n\nNow the Iso was going to break down and a brave new world established. Most people gathered on the Manhattan coast to watch a ceremonial first barge come in. They all had little American flags to trade with the people on the boat. Obviously, the other people would have no way of knowing they were supposed to bring flags of their own. They were being sold merely as a money-making opportunity. Of course, I bought one too. \n\nThe ship came in under a Danish flag, but it carried people from all over the world. They pulled into harbor and dropped anchor. The captain approached the end of the gangplank and said, \"So... some things occurred while you were away.\"",

My generation will never forget the day the world collapsed.\n\nAmerican threw the first punch, or dropped the first bomb as it were. No one was surprised at this point. It had been years of the \u2018Murica is the best attitude and the country finally snapped. There were many cheers in the streets at the announcement of the bomb. Finally, something was being done to show that we would not stand for the idiocy and oppression plaguing the world. \n\nThe Final World War was a short one. Much to America\u2019s surprise, no one allied with them. There were three sides to that War. Bombs fell all over the world with no respite. Europe fared best as bunkers from the last World Wars were uncovered and people took shelter. America, never having seen such violent warfare on its own soil, suffered heavy casualties. \n\nI was 17 the day of the announcement. I was just beginning to explore politics and form my own opinions of policies after listening to my parents my whole life. The under-30 population banded together quickly. We used social media and grassroots to finally rise up and tear down the government that had caused this bloodshed. Our leader halted the assaults and met with other world leaders. An agreement was made. Complete isolation. Every country would retreat into itself and rebuild, grow, and emerge again in 50 years to try for peace. \n\nAmerica struggled for years. The young tried to maintain their carefree, accepting of all attitude while the old were frightened of change. Finally, change began to take place. Without the outside pressure, and our severely dwindled population, we found \u2013 maybe not peace \u2013 but compromise.  Slowly, we learned to live off what still fertile land we could find. Without trade, our society was set back, but our passion led to wild innovation. We learned how to take what was damaged and make it usable. We learned how to recycle and reuse everything, never leaving anything to waste as we could not spare anything during the isolation. We learned to be thankful for our vast lands while other countries, we were sure, were struggling inside their tiny borders. We learned to survive.\n\nThe day the isolation ended America, the rest of the world opened their arms. They had banded together as well, we found out, and continued society without us. The world, to them, had continued almost as if nothing had happened and America was almost forgotten about. They rebuilt and continued on the same path. After 50 years, World War III is only mentioned in textbooks just as the first two were. They have progressed conservatively. Comparatively, America\u2019s technology is wilder and stranger.\n\nAs America\u2019s technology is exposed, the world is taken aback. One would be hard pressed to find a \u201cPure\u201d American, someone without electrical parts, someone who is not \u201cImproved.\u201d It\u2019s clear how uncomfortable with these advancements the other society was. A few months passed where the two societies tried to find harmony together. Life had a tense undercurrent while people pretended they weren\u2019t bothered by the improvements Americans made. The world held its breath, worried the tension would boil over again.\n\nThe tension did persist. The rest of the world could not accept what America had become. We withdrew into our own borders again. It was not so strict this time. People could choose between us and them, but there were rarely vacations between the two halves of the world. It has continued to be a voluntary separation.\n\nAnd that, my dear, is how we became among the Improved and leave trivial matters to the Pure.\n",

Great flashes of light consumed the sky with dragons breath,  upon the ground remained shattered and charred remnants of those happy memories of youth since past. World War III had come, and with it, the great exodus. The war pasted mere months before what remained of the powers that be convened upon the island of Florida, ground zero, to peace talks.\n \nThe population of the world had been decimated, over 700million people perished in the blazes that consumed them. Florida, at one time was a peninsula, but the devastation caused great portions to be sent skyward, filling in great craters with vast amounts of irradiated waters. In an effort to ensure no further loss of life they gathered, pomp and circumstance abounded. In the end, they agreed to 50 years of isolation, the annexation of Alaska by Canada, no less, and Hawaii... Well, it sank into the sea.\n \nThey were given 10 years to build a wall around the 48 states, and were forced into demilitarization. Trade deals would be handled by the pricate sector, but only for raw materials. The internet went dark in the first few weeks of the war, so no one could reach the outside world if they wanted to.\n \nThe walls were raised, and the world, forgotten. Our world became infinately smaller. Inside the concrete walls we flourished. Even before the war one of our most abundant resources was crops, only now, we innovated. Farmlands were transformed into grasslands in order to promote water tables in our interior. We then used this water to create new means of food production at the local levels. Aquaponics allowed us to grow upward, instead of outward, meaning most towns could feed themselves. \n \nToward year 30 our aged electrical grid was replaced with massive power banks spread throughout the country, connected to wind and solar farms. Power outages were a thing of the past. Oil production was ceased as our pipelines were largely destroyed during the conflict. Cars, no longer exist, aside from the occasional junk yard find.\n \nRather, with 600 billion dollars a year going unspent on military, we innovated. Rather than our antiquated highway systems, we built railways, and bullet trains. To go from the Old LA memorial to the Island of Florida only takes a matter of a day on an express route. The world of yesteryear is but a memory now.\n \nAlas, isolationism came to a crashing hault in year 46. The walls north of New York and Maine came under bombardment. Not from bombs, or bullets, but from people. Our walls were built 150 feet tall, and over 60 feet thick at it's base, with a retention wall surrounding it. Water levels had increased dramatically in those 56 years since the war had ended. \n \nBoats filled with people amassed at our shores daily. With them, came word of the world without us. For nearly 60 years the effects of global warming had become apparent, many large cities were now under water. Much of mainland Europe was now an archipelago, Africa was mostly intact but closed its borders from further refugees fleeing the EU. It seemed daily boats would arrive on the west coast as well, filled with people fleeing their sinking  homes. \n \nSouth America and China suffered similar fates, as did Japan and most of Austrailia. The United States,  was largely intact due to the massive walls built half a century before. Millions flocked to our borders only to be turned away. Our goverment's solution? Thicker walls.\n \nThat was four years ago. Now the borders are to open, and what will we find?  ",

Without them in the picture, we wouldn't see a need to fight one another anymore. Real issues like Global Warming could finally be dealt with.\n\nWe expected World Peace. We thought other Countries would be tired of conflict.\n\nAnd we were wrong.\n\nThe first 10 years were mellow. Countries spent most of their time rebuilding their infrastructures, replanting farms, stripping away Military arms for a better future.\n\nBut... While many Countries saw peace, others saw opportunity. \n\nRussia and China had felt mistreated after the War. China's #1 trade partner was gone, and the Chinese economy was barely standing on its own two feet. The Russians were still angry after their loss. The hated the way other Countries blocked them off after the war ended... Apparently the lessons of WWI had escaped us, thinking back on it.\n\nIsrael grew terrified with the loss of its biggest supporter. In a frantic act, they would establish themselves even harder into Palestinian territory. With no one wanting to take the reigns of the Peace Talks, another war soon launched out. Other nations in the Middle East grew furious from the act, and attacked Israel. \n\nAnd when all was said and done... Palestinians regained the rights to the land. But at what cost? The lands were ripped up and tarnished. Infrastructure was destroyed, and the European nations were too worried about their own recovery to support the country.\n\nIt turned towards its allies in the Middle East... Towards Saudi Arabia, a fellow Sunni nation. \n\nThis angered Iran. They put so many resources into the war. Tensions between the Shia and Sunni slowly started to rise... And another war took place after.\n\nDrug Cartels in Mexico prospered. The Mexican Military no longer had the resources of the United States to fight them off, and the people who were suffering didn't have the ability to flee North like they once had.\n\nSo they fled South. Nations like El Salvador and Panama began taking in influxes of immigrants... But, unlike the United States, they didn't have the infrastructure to support them and their economies slowly began to degrade, encouraging Cartels to expand their business.\n\nThe Chinese were dealing with a broken economy and a massive population that only continued to expand. They had no choice... The nations around them slowly started to be swallowed up, so that the Chinese people would have more land to go to.\n\nAnd Europe... They had expected peace with the leave of the United States. They reduced their Militaries to Skeleton Armies, leaving more money to transfer to improving the destroyed nations.\n\nThey didn't expect it when the Russians moved an army to take their old territories back. They didn't expect it when they began to push against the borders of the European Union.\n\nLeft with little choice, Europe federalized as one nation. They fought back.\n\nYes, conflict emboiled the War. The United Nations was nothing but a remnant of its own self, the UN Peacekeeping Corps didn't have the manpower to stop any of this from happening.\n\nBy the time the 50 year mark came... The World was in a state of constant chaos. Borders had changed, Countries had fallen and formed, and new Empires were rising up from the ashes.\n\nBut then the U.S. came back. Their own economy flourishing once again, their farmlands ripe and their Military expecting conflict from the start... Had they always known? Had they been watching us?\n\nIt was hard to tell.\n\nAll we knew was that a strong nation had re-entered World Politics. It had the resources we were lacking, the Military strength we needed.\n\nIt's true the Americans had started the War all those decades ago... But maybe now was their time to redeem themselves.",

Best of luck to the rest of you.\"\n\nIt was casual and, with a bit of personal input, a bit flippant. I suppose they had always been like that. Their borders never opened again. They stayed shut long after the 50 year window. By year 60 the UN agreed they had to know.\n\nThe drones developed in India were unparalleled. Undetectable. The first spot it went had recovered. DC was far from the crater we expected. Modest buildings, homes clustered together, and smiling people. The city shouldn't have been habitable.\n\nLA, New York, Chicago, and Houston were the same. They were fine. Their skylines hadn't returned but people and structures had.\n\nRumors and theories dominated the commentary of the next few months. It ranged from wild theories of aliens to the modest belief that \"Americans did always value their independence.\"\n\nAfter the complete satellite mapping was done, we learned some truths. No skyscrapers. No true cities we had come to expect. However, we saw no homeless, no hungry, but no mansions either. No megahomes. The buildings were far from identical but they were all, to the last, modest. \n\nTheir technology was fairly unremarkable, nothing like the rest of the world. Their bionics seemed advanced, sure, but what fascinated me as a child was their farming tech. That was the only place they were leaps and bounds ahead of ours.\n\nEven now, 30 years past the deadline, they haven't reopened the gates. As a child I watched the videos of the country in awe. How had they done it? I can't help but look at the buildings of the megacorps in my city and wonder: who paid the first official to suggest the plan in the first place?",

And with survival, naturally comes hope. But it was hard. So hard it was made to be the largest evolutionary bottleneck in human history, save one, which crafted this hope in the first place.\n\nThat hope burned, smelted by the fires of hardship that stripped away impurities left behind by the people's forefathers. A steel was made that was more pure and sharp than had ever been seen. Armed with this steel, the people combined with it knowledge of the past and a clear vision of their future. They forged a new constitution, like the people before them did, the people before that, and the people before that. Knowledge upon knowledge paired with a bitter, seeping reminder of what they hoped never to near again.\n\nAnd so walked forth from the ashes was a new era of mankind. Not perfect, but better. Built upon the last age, and learning for the next one. But something was different. They were ready to walk among the stars.\n\nThey did not call themselves American.\n\nOr Chinese. Or British.

Unfortunately here in the United States, we had to put down quite a few rebellions in a very short time, due to the Isolation. We lost millions due to high-yield nuclear weapons that some military factions got a hold of, but we have made ourselves a better country for it. Our extreme aggression, as shown in WWIII as many see it to be, has been for the most part cleaned out of our system. Seeing our fellow Americans dying around us caused a serious change in our attitude towards war. The biggest thing to remember is that, America had only had one other war on their soil before, and that was hundreds of years ago. Here in 2090, we understand true loss, and how much it impacts Americans. \n\nI wasn\u2019t alive for WWIII, but I\u2019ve learned the - obviously - American version of the war. We fought throughout South America, Asia, and Europe, while we made sure the United States itself was untouched. This was the way of America before the war. We wanted to keep ourselves seemingly invincible and an impregnable fortress. After billions of dead, both civilian and military, the UN decided that isolation was the best course of action. On the last day, we watched the world leaders bid each other farewell, get in their planes, and fly off most likely to never see each other again. \n\nNow the Isolation is over, and all nations of the world get to interact again. I\u2019m excited to see what\u2019s in store for us as the internet is reopened to the entire world. the Isolation ends at 6:00 pm tonight. It\u2019s 5:59 pm right now. You can feel the anticipation throughout the entire country as we begin to pull out our phones, and are ready to log back in to watch the world open up. Many people, like me, are waiting for the walls to drop around the United States to Mexico. I plan on making my first time out of the country as soon as possible. \n\nWith the walls coming down on the Mexico-America border, it seems like you can hear the cheering of every person in the United States, and the energy and anticipation of what is in store. The walls are finally down, and we look into another country for the first times in many of our lives.\n\nMexico wasn\u2019t the only country there to greet us however. There was only one flag, which looked like the infinity symbol, with pieces of hundred of flags within it. There hundreds of sullen looking riot police staring right back at us. We all look at each other in confusion as a man steps out from behind the police officers, dressed in a bright blue three-piece suit.\n\n\u201cWelcome back to the world America! While you were gone, the rest of the world reformed itself into one nation. We knew the American patriotism and aggression mindset would not have worked with this idea.\u201d\n\nThere were outcries from all around me as people were realizing what had happened. The rest of the world had lied to us. \n\nWithin months, the United States government had decimated billions of acres of land all across the world. The old aggression of the United States came back with a roaring fury after the revelation was given to us. However, we sustained our own losses as well. They had intended to destroy us after we opened borders, but they didn\u2019t get very far. The combination of anger and hatred for being tricked fueled every American into fighting back, and it became America against the world, and we won.",

            "comment": "My alarm wakes me up, the chiming of my phone telling me I need to get ready to go to work. I look at my wrist and see that I've only got half power, so I send a mental command to my implanted Carbo-Lipid Electricity Converter: \"charge the phone\". I then pull myself out of bed, and run a system diagnostic. The wrist mounted display is all too quick to display the information:\n\nCLEC: Operational\n\nWrDSP: Operational\n\nREN: Operational\n\nBCI: Fully Functional\n\nCEI: New Networks Available\n\nI stop when I read that. The cognitive enhancer, and the reaction enhancer, lets me read this at about ten thousand words per minute, with full comprehension. I could directly download this information if I'd gotten the Hippocampus Expansion Computer but I didn't like the idea of someone being able to edit my memories. A quick check of the intranet revealed why new networks were available: The borders went down today. \n\nI was alive when the first bombs fell. When North Korea launched a missile, and it started to arc towards Guam. Nobody knew it was a navigational error, and the US promptly responded. This dragged China into the fight, making good on their promise to intervene if the United States initiated hostilities. When all was said and done, over 5 billion people were dead, the US was tapped as far as military capability was concerned, and the entire world, for various reasons, had essentially come to the brink.\n\nPeople didn't realize just how bad it had gotten in the US. Even with  pictures of people starving in the streets for want of food, even after showing how an infected cut had become a death sentence despite the seizure of all medical centers by the CDC under eminent domain. The world still blamed the US for its own suffering, but the way they got their revenge was, as I was finding, quite creative.\n\nAppealing to the right wing nationalism they hoped was running rampant on the US'es part, the world decided that all nations would  isolate themselves from one another for a period for fifty years. The idea, as it was proposed, was that people couldn't get along with others, and nobody trusted each other. By instituting the global isolating laser network, it was said that there would be no aggression. Each nation could worry about its own borders for a while. In reality, it was all a ruse: After forcing it on the US, and waiting for the US to leave, they quickly had the defense network solely aimed at the US.\n\nOf course, communication satellites that were designed to only work for the US, ships only engaging in research for an individual country, these were the types of concessions that the nations of the world allowed to happen. They thought that taking SpaceX would prevent the surge in US space exploration that had happened. Without the need to worry about aggressors, the US military budget allowed a lot of civil issues to be quickly fixed. This was done in spite of the treaty, which was constructed as a way to make the US destroy itself with its own vices.\n\nThe world at large, however, hadn't faired as well. Without the US, there was a power vacuum that China and Russia competed with eachother to fill. India ended up pushing them both out of the vacuum, and had developed to a state comparable to the US before the war had began. They had world spanning internet, but after probing it, I found it to be painfully slow. They'd invested in better and better medical technology, yet they hadn't cured Rabies. Or Cancer, for that matter. They were only just beginning to pursue cybernetics as aggressively as the US had.\n\nThere was a reason for this, part of the peace treaty was that the US had to \"Abide by its ideals.\" All market sanctions, all licensing boards, all the bureaucracy that protected people from the worst capitalism had to offer was removed at gunpoint. This led to some times of strife, as the CDC had to relinquish control of hospitals and clinics to private operators. Despite this, and the intent of these laws, the economy was unchained. The world took the safe path, while the US was forced to take the path that it always had, the risky one.\n\nThe obvious problems of capitalism run amok were quickly dealt with in one of the most ingenious ways imaginable: Heading up a company of your own did give you some very good perks: Priority on any government programs, some extra votes in the Senate, no requirement for civil service in the Police Corps. It also made your murder by another 100% legal. You could defend yourself, sure, but if you did something that killed several people, or left them exposed to some new disease, good luck surviving. I knew some of this from first hand experience. Well, second hand, I'd been paid on more than one occasion to mete out vigilante justice against a particularly greedy executive.\n\nEventually, these laws weren't needed, and we got back to a more representative form of government. As people learned better ways to tweak the system, the country began to have several socialized programs that were socialist in all but name and operation. This allowed the US to remain in compliance with the treaty that ended the war. We knew the consequences if we didn't: The laser defense network would, automatically, turn on us. ",

            "comment": "  I was only a child when the bombs fell. First, they said it was the Russians. Then, they tried to convince us that it was the vindictive actions of one \"Kim Jong Un\", authoritarian ruler of a small nation that used to be known as North Korea. Neither the north nor the south survived, so I guess it's just No Korea now. At least that's what my grandpa always used to like to say. He had some pretty strong opinions about the entire situation. \n\n  It wasn't until the war was almost over that we truly accepted how it had began. We were the ones that had dropped the first bombs. Some kind of resurgence of this idea they once called \"manifest destiny\" under the last democratically elected president of the States, our great leader Trump (may he make america great again) had taken hold in the collective consciousness of the American people. \n\n  Of course, I don't really remember any of this happening. I was just a kid. But, I have heard stories. Entire regions of the world were gone in a matter of hours. Over 97% of the world's population was sentenced to a metaphorical guillotine. My family was lucky. My dad had always had this hobby called \"doomsday prepping\"  that turned out to actually be quite useful. He had built us a shelter in the backyard. Apparently my mom always used to yell at him for spending money on useless things. I guess it wasn't so useless after all.\n\n  Mere hours after the bombs fell, the world leaders tried to convene and place sanctions upon our great leader Trump (may he make America great again). He wouldn't have it. He continued to drop more bombs. The event quickly became known as the third world war, though it lasted no more than two weeks in total. Most of the world is still uninhabitable. Our great leader Trump (may he make America great again) then came up with a brilliant solution to get us out of our dreadful situation. He pressed all the other world leaders into agreeing to a permanent ceasefire under the banner of reducing globalism and returning to a time before the world was so connected. Every country agreed that, for the next fifty years, no country would contact any of the others. They agreed because of the great leadership of lord Trump (may he make America great again) and because he was very stable and genius. This is how my father tells the story, so it must be true. \n\n  Well, I'm no longer a child and it is finally time to go back out into the world. To tell the truth, I am kind of afraid. I've never really been outside of this bunker. All I've had are the weekly broadcasts of our great leader on an old CB radio that must be well over a hundred years old. I know that we have surely fared the best of all the countries in the world, so why should I be afraid? What will I find? As long as I follow the great leader Trump's (may he make America great again) instructions, I know everything will turn out fine.\n \n  As I take my first steps outside, the first thing I notice it that it is really fucking hot. Leader Trump (may he live forever) has told us that it might be warmer than we are used to due to the very natural process of the Earth's warming, which we are told happens in cycles. \n  My daughter sees the sun for the first time. This is worth all the years of isolation. To see her smile is the only thing that has kept me going for a long time. When mom died, my daughter would tell me that grandma was finally able to go out and be in the world again. That was a small, but comforting idea. \n\n  I'm surprised by the lack of vegetation. It seems almost as if no one is around. Isn't this the day that we all get to leave our bunkers? Is this not the day that leader Trump (may he make America great again) promised? I see my wizened father in the corner of my eye. He is sharing a knowing look with several of the other elderly members of the family.\n\n  \"Son, I have something to tell you,\" he says to me. \"I made a mistake many years ago. There was a missile alarm that went off in Hawaii all those years ago, so I decided to finally make use of the bunker. There was no war. That CB radio? It's actually just a two-way radio and this whole Trump thing has been pretty entertaining. We used memes to get him elected in my day. I felt mighty foolish after staying down there for a solid month, but your mother and I finally came out when we realized that there were no continuing emergency broadcasts. The alarm was a false alarm. Then we started hearing things on the news about kids eating Tide pods. The world wasn't a safe place anymore. Your mother and I decided to weather out life underground. Now that your daughter is beginning to get older, I just feel like I'd be a bad grandpa if I didn't let her see the world, son. I'm sorry, but we had a good time down there, didn't we?\"\n\n\"But where are all the people, father?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, Elon Musk took everyone to Mars about 10 years after we got all barricaded. Decided to let the planet heal a little- Global warming and all.\"\n\n\"What's global warming?\" I asked. \n\n\"Oh, don't worry about that, it's handled. Anyway, sorry about the whole lying thing,\" he said as he ducked from my clumsily attempted punch. \n\n  Well, it looks like I have a lot to learn about the real world. Wish me luck. At least I'm not isolated anymore. Wish me luck.\n\n\n\nSorry if this sucks. First attempt on WP.\n\n",

            "comment": "They said they wanted peace. They said they wanted to avoid a future where humanity wiped itself out. They said a lot of things. And then they said no more.\n\nFor fifty years we waited. We followed the treaty down to the letter, even refusing to contact our northern and southern neighbors. For fifty years we waited, as they spat on their supposed good intentions. We waited as peace broke down. We waited as war broke out.\n\nThere's a slight poetic justice to learning that the ones who were afraid of us, the ones responsible for this self imposed exile, died in a hellfire of their own making. They thought that we were the biggest threat. They thought we were the cancer spreading throughout the world, destroying everything it touched.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nWe were simply a deterrent. A force of nature that none dared to cross. And with us out of the way, with nothing to be afraid of, the world tore itself apart.\n\nWe came out of our exile prepared to fight. We expected an army of nations, prepared to end us, once and for all. But what we found instead was the very world itself, wrapped up in a wintery bow, waiting for us to take it.\n\n",

            "comment": "*I got hooked on the premise and stayed up too late writing it and went a little bonkers. Sorry for muddy waters.*\n\nHis family explained it many times, when he was a child, how it was no one's fault in particular: the missiles already had targets and the people who turned the keys had no way of knowing. Phonecalls were made, jets scrambled, evacuations announces. Only a dozen or so went off. Just enough to make life awful for everyone, enough to salt the earth where conventional war hadn't already. There were too many grudges that needed to be settled. It was a botched lance. There was no relief. Infection set in.\n\nThe sun stopped coming out. That was what did it, really, if anything was to blame. The famine took his family away from him. That's what he told the crowd at his inauguration. He was just like them. He worked with Civil Defense, like many of the people attending. He was there when the trucks ran out of gas, to help move medicine and food, as if such things existed anymore. He was not a hero, no, he was just the right man in the right place at the right time. He'd like to do that again as America's next Commander-in-Chief.\n\nIf anyone clapped for President Gilbert's speech, it was inaudible, considering how many wore gloves. There were very few in attendance, given the recent flareup of diphtheria and the bitter cold that day; wind clawed at his face and forced it in to contortions similar to those produced by sucking on a lemon. His eyes teared up. His droopy frame attempted to right itself for the pictures no photographers could take. And in the back of his head, there was that gnawing sense that they could find out. That they would find out. They would find out what his mother and father did to get in to that bunker; that they would find out what he did to--\n\n*POP!*\n\n\"... may I be the first to offer my sincerest congratulations, Mr. President...\" The Secretary of State passed him a flute of champagne. \n\nMost of the room was blanketed in shadows, the windows frosted and the only source of light a construction lamp dangling from the cracking ceiling. There was enough to make out words on paper, people's faces, and the damage done by years of snow and ice to the interior of the Oval Office. The fimbriation along the flag behind his desk dangled across the stars and stripes in pathetic majesty. Cheers were sent up once everyone's glass was filled, and they echoed in the largely abandoned  West Wing. Someone coughed for about a minute.\n\nThey gossiped for some time, his cabinet, most of them bunker babies like himself. They were the old guard, the last of the statesmen. Those born since the famine seemed to care very little for politics and restoration of order when the National Guard was robbing them blind and disease was rampant, not that there was any weight to the accusations. Such roadblocks were, however, expected and accounted for. How couldn't they be, if the call was going to do anyone any good? It couldn't without maintaining the peace. They talked then very much and now even more about the call and maintaining the peace, and how it would justify going so long with so little. It would make those who claimed the disbanding of the United Nations shortsighted, this being the only thing Gilbert's cabinet agreed upon. Yes, they defiantly stood by their nation's original conviction with the same energy as before it had all fallen apart, and it was exactly what America needed. 'Now more than ever' was what they had printed on flyers, before the mimeograph broke. \n\nOnce the champagne and cake was exhausted, and they had collected themselves in a circle on and around the stained couches in the center, the Secretary of Defense looked from the group to President Gilbert. She produced a sealed document from underneath her arm, and delicately placed it on the coffee table in front of him.\n\n\"Mister President, it's not my intent to spoil the celebration, but as we spoke about yesterday, this document contains the Normalization Protocol. You're familiar with most of it from those briefings, but, it contains information for your eyes only... please, take your time.\" \n\nThe binding of the red ribbon that girdled the Protocol was brittle and its edges coiled. It fell apart with terribly little effort, and President Gilbert tread more slowly as he explored the folder. It took him almost an hour to complete it. The entire room watched him as he did so, the ceremony interruped only by constant pacing and murmurs and hushed conversation. Charts were consulted. Letters were drafted.  An aide prepared a telephone in the background, escorted by two Marines in filthy uniforms. Paperwork had collected on every imaginable surface.\n\nOnce everything was more or less in its place, President Gilbert seated himself behind the desk of the leader of the free world, and he pulled the telephone closer. It had no dial, only a faceplate where it would have been. He grit his teeth and  traced the wire from its fall off the desk, between the couches, under the feet of the Marines, and out in to the hallway. Presumably it was connected to the Slave Relay in Greenland. Presumably that Slave Relay was connected to the Master Relay in Bern. Presumably the cables between them all had not been severed and the nuclear generators that powered all of these overdesigned mechanisms had not failed. \n\nPresumably he would hear the confirmation tone every sixty seconds until another party answered. \n\nSweat coalesced on his palm, in spite of the cold. It trembled. He paused.\n\n\"I'd -- I'd like the room to myself, thank you.\"\n\nNo one budged, until the Secretary of Agriculture lifted himself up from a folding chair near the window and sauntered out. The rest followed suit, some craning back to look at the President, the rest down-turned, as if afraid they'd be turned in to pillars of salt. When only the two Marines were left, they tidied the cable in the crook of the doorway and sealed the chamber. The light flickered. There was a muffled commotion from somewhere else in the building, and a police siren went off a block or two away. Gilbert closed his eyes, breathed as slowly as he could given that his lungs were shivering and his body wincing. When he did exhale, it came out in machine-gun bursts of steam, like a backfiring Cadillac. His shirt was damp and his tie was too tight and *what if no one picks up?* \n\nThere was a shout somewhere on the lawn. He picked up the receiver, ears ringing. There was a dial tone. My God, *there was a dial tone*. Sporadic gunfire. His pulse quickened, he clenched his eyes, and an inexorable force not unlike the one that made him pick up his father's rifle many, many years ago guided it to his ear. An indeterminate amount of time passed, the same time Einstein once wrote ebbed and flowed in fantastic and unreal ways, ways that made even a second not only feel as if it were an hour but in fact compelled it to behave as if it were an hour. Maybe it was the adrenaline. The tone persisted. It had to have been sixty seconds, but he refused to count. \n\nTEN FIFTY-ONE. *Beep.* INTERVAL 4-3-8-7-6-1-1-7. CODE 40. NO--\n\nIf he hadn't had looked up and realized the Federal Government's clock was off by a few minutes, he would have cried, but instead, President Gilbert laughed. Fifty years of no contact with the outside world would do that. Fifty years of mutual agreement to not speak to one another was enough to scare war out of civilization. Fifty years of invisible walls and cut wires. Fifty years to satisfy the conditions of the Second Nairobi Conference and produce a machine that would announce to the other leaders of the world on the call that Code 40 had been achieved. Everyone would be too busy to be exchanging food and toilet paper and gas and medicine and cigarettes to notice. There would be medals and ceremonies. He'd be a hero. Other countries must have made it. They must have what he could not provide. He did what he had to to survive. It was easier than you'd think. History would vindicate him. \n\n\"This is... this is the President of the United States of America--\"\n\nThe gunfire peaked and crashed. A snow-caked window had shattered and through its empty frame were visible the Marines he had ordered out of the room, doubled over in crimson snow on the White House lawn. Flurries had already begun to collect on their uniforms. \n\nTEN FIFTY-FOUR. *Beep.* INTERVAL 4-3-8-7-6-1-2-0. CODE 40. NO MUTUAL OPERATORS. \n\nThe receiver dangled over the edge of the desk. It dangled over the last President of the United States. The man with the assault rifle and the toeless boots who picked it up didn't know what Code 40 meant, and honestly it didn't matter. Continuation of government simply did not appeal to the younger demographic. They could not grasp the bigger picture; they always needed more than could be provisioned. They could not even be expected to find adequate shelter. It was a tough sell, civilization. Gilbert's campaign manager had stressed this.\n\nWar could never happen again if there were no one left to commit it, and in this respect the Second Nairobi Conference was a complete success: a shining example of and eternal monument to what can be achieved through the goodwill of mankind. It was more than enough to eclipse the scandals that would later become associated with the GIlbert Presidency, and would have eventually captured the post-bunker-baby vote had they not shortly thereafter done to themselves what their government and those abroad had tried so desperately to prevent for fifty years.  \n\nIf it was anyone's fault to begin with, there was no one left to blame.

            "comment": "World War III, the war to end all wars. That is what we were taught, what we had envisioned, the resounding call to action when our self imposed \"exile of nations\" passed in near unanimous fashion. \n\nFirst however, let me ask you; have you ever lied? Fabricated a story to get your way in the short term with no way to protect yourself when it inevitably blows up in your face? Yeah...well the World and it's history are built on lies and when the time came, World War III was no different.\n\nYou see prior to the War your history books tell you of \"The United States of America\"... \n\nAnywho, the United States had always been a technological and scientific marvel plenty of our \"Modern\" technology and medicine had come from it, good or bad. So when the next advancement in A.I, that's artificial intelligence; it's like an entity that runs on math, it's smarter and faster than you or I, we were of course excited. Why? This one could connect the global market's even more, better stock, higher payouts...hell it even had an algorithm to get aid to impoverished countries it would run everything. They called it, oh what does it matter...just know that it was our first step to a unified planet, what we could do seemed boundless; mars..ha ancient history. We were transiting to the next stage of civilization and nothing could stop us, atleast that's what we were told.\n\nAs you can imagine reality came knocking. The A.I wasn't all it was cracked up to be and when we found out...hell it was to late. Humanity in it's excitement, had given control of all the worlds governments, their holdings, plans just everything to this damned A.I. So bombs fell, nuclear hellfire and all that right? Wrong...\n\nRemember, I said this A.I could do everything and so it touched everything; slowly..surely like a horror movie of old. First it was just slight inconveniences, toasters...coffee makers...your laundry machine, and the next thing you know, it's computers, internet, phones...everything.\n\nSo tell me, what happens when you wake up, nothing works, your comforts are gone, alongside your money, you've got kids to feed and your infrastructure is near non-existent. We went from living like gods...and then to comparatively nothing. \n\nIt was madness, you had to support yourself or you would die, it became dog eat dog. You ever see a man get torn apart by the limbs just to have something to eat? You ever see someone handicapped catch a bullet because they strained the local community? Believe me, take yourself out of the picture if it ever gets like that.\n\nSo, when we finally did get some sort of \"normality\" and our governments back in place and that includes the new countries as well, we decided we would go about it the old fashioned way. Meeting after meeting, talk after talk the countries of the world hashed out our \"new deal\". We would all go into isolation, not isolation from ourselves of course..hell that would have been the smart thing to do..no isolation from the good ol \"USA\". Afterall, they caused this right; not us, we didn't unleash that damn A.I...how naive we were, we were the ones to accept it..fall victim to it's promises and we were about to lie to ourselves again. Abandon a country that had no ill intentions of us, a country that had built itself by supporting us for better or worse, a global trader in the past. So the final vote came, near unanimous...they were out and officially we were to and for 10 years our lie held up.\n\nWe had brought ourselves back to the days of our great, great grandfathers...a 1930-40's existence. It wasn't to hard, we just had to heh...pull ourselves up by the bootstraps. Food was growing to feed our populations, pre-war medicinal advancements were there...you could say we were living the \"American dream\", two cars in every garage, a wife at home and a husband in a steady job...again though naive.\n\nLike all good things, it didn't last. You see, when you live in that post card picturesque world you don't want to change it. Why would you? So what if technology didn't advance beyond that of our new existence. We had food, we had warm beds and not a care in the world. Or so we thought.\n\nIt was all a lie, you see when we didn't isolate ourselves we allowed our own differences to come to the forefront. America was no longer there, we didn't have \"Big-Brother\" to get pissy about. The day came when Russia wanted more and shattered our peace. The day came when China went completely dark. The day came when we were right back into it, but with our populations dwindled from \"WW3\" we ended up with endless stalemate, we had learned nothing. Killing our men and women...losing an entire generation to trench war not experienced in 200 years...god we were fools, and then the day isolation was to end.. What were we to do then!\n\n We had spent our time fighting, killing ourselves over our own dream once again while they built up. Of course their technology was just as stricken as ours but no they built themselves up, their national image. What I can only assume was the nature of their political system finally seeing complete takeover by a fringe faction.\n\nThose...\"Americans\" goose stepped their way right into Mexico...it was over before we could even think to react. I have to admit, I was slightly shocked...even awed. Not that I agree with their \"pure-blood\" beliefs, or their \"Freedom\"; but you must admit, their leader has a way of rallying sheep to genocidal wolves.\n\nThat's what they did to. First it was central America...then South America, \"did you have American familia?\" no? Get in the train. \"Do you accept New Saint of America?\" no? Enjoy your ditch. \"Where you handicapped?\" yes? Enjoy your gas.\n\nIt didn't stop either, as quick as they descended upon Mexico they had met Canada, what was Canada to do? Canada was peace loving prior to the great war...damnit Canada why didn't you take the deal...it's all they had to do.\n\nSo, forget your history books young stock, that America down there on those waves...that's not the freedom touting, protecting the western hemisphere America we thought we hated...now, load your rifle *Shelling in the distance*, they land in about 3 minutes...this is the Queen's land. We shall defend our island, whatever the cost.",

But not all for the same reason... without the crutch of funding and support the US had provided things became hectic. Nations that feared consequences from the superpower gained confidence and began acting against other countries. Without the giant to keep things in check smaller countries gained a thirst for what they never were allowed to have. Imperialism became the name of the game. And there was no US to call for help.",

            "comment": "\"WHO ARE YOU?\" She screams at me. \n\nI don't know what to say. Nothing I'm saying is satisfying her. \r\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean. I'm whatever you need me to be. I always have been.\" \r\n\n\"You don't understand.\" she cries out. Her chest is starting to heave and her tears are flowing more fiercely than ever. \r\n\nI put out my hand towards her, I hesitate for a moment, changing it into dad's hands. She always found dad's hands the most comforting. \r\n\nThe moment I touch her she starts screaming again. She slaps dad's hands away. She gets up and pushes us as hard as she can. \r\n\n\"I don't even know who I am because of you!\" She screams. \"I feel sick\" \n\n\"Do.....you need mom to take care of you?\" I ask, moulding my shape into mom. I focus on making the eyes as kind as possible.\" \n\nShe takes one look at me and starts crying harder. There's a garbage can nearby. She runs to it and throws up. This has never happened before. I'm using every single form I have available to me and she seems to only become more distressed. \n\n\"The thought of having touched you the way I did....you were supposed to be my husband.\" \n\n\"But I am..\" I say as I start to shift into husband, but my face has not settled in yet before she's screaming again. She gets up wildly from the bed. She sees a metal rod on the kitchen counter. Dad and Husband were supposed to split and fix the sink together. She's grabbed the rod and she's swinging it at our face. \n\nI have realized she said something. \"The thought of touching you the way I did...\"\n\nIt's so simple. Sometimes the most complex issues have the most simple responses. \n\nAs she swings at us again, we take the metal rod from her and strike the base of her head with precision. \n\nThere, no more thoughts. \n\nShe's awoken a few hours later in the hospital. We are a doctor now. \n\n\"Glad to see you're awake!\" we say smiling at her. The terror is still faintly in her eyes, but she is doubting herself now. Good. \n\n\"You had a mild concussion but you're ok now. Your husband will be in soon to see you.\" \n\nHer eyes go wide. \"My...husband?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" we say. \"He was with you all of last night. You were having some terrible dreams but he stayed and held your hand the whole night.\" \n\nUnderstanding is beginning to dawn on her. At least what she thinks is understanding. With promises that we'll be in soon, we leave the room as she slumps back into the bed. We hear a deep sigh. Finally. \n\nSoon, we will be able to return, as everything.",

Basically the shapeshifter is making her whole reality a lie, but it thinks keeping the lie going is the right move.",

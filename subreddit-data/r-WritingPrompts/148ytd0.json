    "postText": "So I've been participating in this subreddit for a few weeks. The responses to my prompts have been hit or miss, so I've been attempting to write prompts that are more intriguing, maybe that will grab more attention. Some of them have gotten a decent amount of up votes. Some none. \n\nBut I started to realize that in my attempt to write better prompts, I may have not left much room for storytelling. Looking at my last prompt, it had a beginning, middle, end, a protagonist, and an antagonist. That's not a prompt. That's a micro story (if such a thing exists). \n\nSo for some of you more successful prompt writers, what what have gone into your more successful prompts? Writers what kind of prompts make you want to write a story?\n\nBTW this is a great subreddit. I've had a lot of fun being here.\n\nThanks everyone.",

Considering some micro fiction prompts have a very disproportionate amount of upvotes for the prompt and rather low upvotes for some of the wonderful writing within, it gives me the impression that the average viewer probably gets a chuckle out of a prompt with a punchline, upvotes and moves on without actually scrolling to read the short stories within. (e.g. 300+ upvotes for the prompt, but the most upvoted story by a spotlit writer is only 25 votes)",

Just as there are people who create prompts, there are writers who respond to them, people who drop in comments, others who read the stuff that's written, maybe drop an award at writing they really loved. And some people do a mix of the above.\n\nMy personal take is that it doesn't hurt to read what others write after you did your piece, because sometimes, writers can get inspiration from what other fellow writers put out.",

I don\u2019t remember how long it\u2019s been since I first stepped into that time machine, trying again and again and again just to find a way to change the future. \n\nI can\u2019t even remember what her face looks like anymore. I just remember that she was smiling when we were about to say goodbye, and that I ran and ran because I couldn\u2019t accept the end of her time.  \n\nI guess you must be quite confused seeing this line of text come up on your display now and yet you\u2019re probably frowning coldly, thinking of whether this is a trap created by one of the many enemies you\u2019ve made on this pointless, futile quest of ours\u2019.  \n\nYou won\u2019t believe me, just like I wouldn\u2019t believe it back then, if I were to tell you that we never succeeded in saving her. \n\nBut I think I will still try to persuade you. Call it\u2026the last shred of hope I have for myself. My last chance at stopping before I destroy more of the past and the future of countless lives.\n\nShe died and we never saved her. You will die too, and you\u2019ll end up in this spot, just a few traces of sentient data left trying and hoping bitterly in the face of an uncaring universe. \n\nHaven\u2019t you seen many amazing sights on your journey already? Don\u2019t you feel terrible admiration every time you see the lives you ruined fighting desperately to stop you? \n\nYou don\u2019t believe that she\u2019s waiting for you. You have probably given up on believing that you can even succeed. You are just running through the same tired routines in your travels because that\u2019s all you\u2019ve been doing, hoping to change the outcome of that five minutes of time. I- \n\n[ERROR: 20-7-a]\n\n-ah, the machine is running out of fuel. Unsurprising. It\u2019s a miracle the chronogears have lasted this long, I suppose. \n\nIn that case, I suppose it\u2019s fine to tell you now. I had a long time to think about how to stop myself when I finally realized that we would never be able to save her. It was the least I could do, you see, to make up for all the lives we destroyed in our reckless travels. \n\n[ERROR: 40/3 - CRITICAL BREACH]\n\nI knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to resist reading what I had to say, hoping to find a hint of what I knew, hoping that I had some information about how to save her. \n\n[ERROR: 40/2388.$$:8\u2026]\n\nThe chronospire is overloading. I\u2019ve locked you in. You might as well just sit back and open that bottle of Astral-05 whiskey we stashed under the control matrix. \n\n[ER33!&amp;:88&amp;ebjk\u2026]\n\nMaybe this way we\u2019ll finally see her again\u2026",

            "comment": "Nobody expected this level of response from the humans. Nobody knew they had been preparing in secret for two centuries since they were brought into the galactic fold of the Federation. The humans had seeded the galaxy, not with agents or ships, but explosives. Explosives, but none like any of us expected.\n\nWe found out to our horror that, in retaliation to the invaders, they had detonated their own sun.\n\n\"Our ships detected the spike in what the humans call their Milky Way galaxy. But now the galaxy is simply...not there.\" Lieutenant Commander De'helk reports with a slight tremor in his voice.\n\nThe council of the Federation looks down to the human representative sitting alone at a table on the far side of the room. \"Any explanation?\"\n\nA malicious smile spreads across his face. Pearl white teeth practically glowing in the low light of the conference room. \"Humanity is a wrathful species, and anger vindicates all of our sins. Nothing is as honest as rage. Throughout human history there has been no emotion more worth or true of emulation than depthless anger. A parent confronting their child's killer, a farmer defending his family and home from raiders and alien invaders. In rage, everything to us is justified. With rage comes vindication, and with vindication comes peace.\"\n\nThe man rises to his feet and slowly approaches the door to leave before he stops to look over his shoulder. \"There is little we won't do in the name of vengeance, including decimating our own galaxy to make a point to the rest of you.\" His smile suddenly shifts to a friendly yet off-putting one. \"Our children used to have a saying amongst themselves that very quickly spread across old Earth and fit our ethos very well. Fuck around and find out.\"\n\nThe old wooden door slams behind the man without him even needing to touch it sending a chill down the spine of everyone remaining in the room.",

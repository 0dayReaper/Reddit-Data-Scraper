            "comment": "\"That has got to be, without a shadow of a doubt, the dumbest fucking thing I have ever heard.\"\n\nSergeant Barnes stood waiting for the coffee machine to finish making noise. Beside him stood Police Constable Williams, with a report in-hand.\n\n\"But it has to be the case, sir. There's no other possible connection.\"\n\n\"No other connection *that you can find*.\"\n\n\"Sir, how many victims have there been so far? Seventeen? Eighteen?\"\n\n\"At least twenty,\" Barnes replied, as he checked his coat pockets for cigarettes. \"Bloodwork suggests there's more than we originally thought. What's your point?\"\n\n\"My point is that there's no other correlation between them. Do you not think it's odd that there are never any signs of forced entry, given the condition of the bodies?\"\n\n\"I don't think the killer is choosing his victims because they have a fucking welcome mat.\"\n\n\"To be honest, I'm not too sure of that either. But we're obviously dealing with a complete nutter, so I think it might be worth considering. Maybe he really hates welcome mats.\"\n\nBarnes let out a short groan. \"Fine, I'll read it. *If* you go around the corner and get me some cigs. I've run out.\"\n\nWilliams glanced at the clock above the door (8:37am), then promptly obliged.\n\nWith the report and morning coffee in-hand, Barnes walked over to his desk. He waited until he could see Williams in the street through the nearby window, then chuckled as he dropped the report into the bin. \n\nThe welcome mat killer. He had now officially heard it all. Williams was a promising young officer, but he could be a real idiot sometimes.",

            "comment": "The woman comes to the Wal-mart, alone, on a windy evening.  The door to the box-store separates for her automatically when it senses her human movements, and she shivers in the vestibule.  She is very tired, but still she smiles and nods when Albert the greeter says hello, grinning with his strange teeth.  She pulls a shopping cart free, and goes shuffling down the aisles, each full of every commodity imaginable, all stacked atop each other like the towers of some cliffside gothic castle.\n\nShe only has twenty dollars cash remaining in her coat pocket.  It was given to her by Sandra from the community center, who had just that afternoon also invited the woman to live in her house, now that her mother had at last kicked her out for good.  Whether the money was a loan or gift is still not altogether clear to the woman.  However, the distinction does not matter.  Deep down she knows she does not intend to ever repay it.  \n\n\"My spare room isn't much bigger than a closet, but this is to help you make it feel like it's yours,\" Sandra had announced, when she pressed the crumpled bills into the woman's hand, \"Get yourself a new little dresser, some sheets, and whatever else it will take.  I'll help you set it up tonight after work.\" \n\nSandra's kindness had initially measured over two hundred dollars.  Alongside the spare room, it was all such a gesture that the woman quickly realized she had no concept of how to respond, so she just stuttered a thank you, and then hugged her savior for over five seconds.  She told Sandra that she had already become a second mother to her, who, unlike her real mom, understood addiction, and how when people stumble, they need compassion and support, rather than an eviction, and an oath to no longer enable. The woman promised not to waste the opportunity Sandra had given her.  But even though she believed at the time that she had meant what she promised, before she was even a mile from the community center, she found herself detouring on her way to the Wal-mart, over to the park where the men in the puffy jackets are always sitting on the same bench.  Soon enough, almost all Sandra's money was gone.  And now, meandering through the endless Wal-mart aisles, stuffed full everything a human being could ever covet, the woman encounters the sheets and the small dressers, and the prices on them.  She begins to cry.  \n  \n\"Are you alright, miss?\" Albert the greeter asks, mincing toward her.  He is very old and his skin is quite pale, even under the fluorescent Wal-mart lights.  Usually the woman would lie to a stranger and send him along after being asked this sort of question.  But, with Albert, for some reason she does want to dismiss him so summarily.  Perhaps it is the lilt in the frail man's voice or perhaps it is just the frantic desperation of her situation; regardless, the woman feels compelled to tell him an intimate truth.\n\n\"I think I just ruined the last chance I had at a decent life,\" she says, wiping her nose on her sleeve, \"All because I can't control myself.  All because I'm a fucking vampire who just can't stop consuming and hurting people.\"\n\nShe goes on to unburden herself to Albert, as if he was a priest, with the kitchenware aisle for his confessional.  She tells him about the drugs, how it began with the cooks and other waitresses all reeking of garlic after too-long shifts in the restaurant, how it migrated to parties on the weekends, and then to alleyways and abandoned buildings, how her mother would inspect her forearms with a flashlight and lock up her purse at night, how she went to the meetings, but spent most of it on her cell phone, until it was her turn to speak, when she would stand before the crowd and just lie.  She tells Albert about Sandra, and how she doesn't even know what she is doing in the fucking Wal-mart since she has no money left and will never again be able to look that saintly woman in the eyes. \n\n\"Well, if you're a vampire, then I'd say you're in the right place,\" Albert tells the woman, stroking her back gently, \"Everyone in Wal-mart is a vampire in one way or another, just insatiably consuming all this garbage.  But, you know, maybe being a vampire is the highest, best thing anyone can be these days.  So maybe you should just stop fighting against what you really are.\"\n\nThe woman chuckles a little.  The old man is more pragmatic than she would have expected. \"That's all well and good, but it won't exactly help me find a place to sleep tonight, now will it?\" she asks.\n\n\"Oh I don't know about that,\" Albert responds, \"I think if you really wanted to, you could still find a way to lay your head at that Sandra lady's place, and I think you could do it without having to ever admit your little slip up to her.  Tell me, do you think Sandra has a welcome mat outside her house?  If not, this Wal-mart's got a lovely selection of welcome mats, and plenty of them are cheaper than twenty bucks.  Maybe all it will take for you to get yourself into Sandra's house tonight is laying down a welcome mat beside her door.\"\n\nThe woman looks at Albert with a furrowed brow.  \"Okay now you're not making any sense, what does a welcome mat have to -\"\n\nAlbert puts his wrinkled, liver spotted finger on her lips.  He leans in and whispers in her ear.  Her eyes go wide.\n\n",

Even if they do hire at wages around $10/hr, they schedule employees so that they aren't getting full time hours, which makes them eligible for government benefits then train the employees how to apply for and receive said benefits. It's an incredible scam they have going on that basically passes much of their wage costs to the government directly.",

            "comment": "Once again, was I sitting there in the darkness. Hungry. Starving. The gossip was going around faster than my non-existing blood flow,. The mortals knew there were shady \"people\" around who would knock on the door with some poor excuse to try and enter the residence. Some lousy new-blood was captured and tortured for the secret of our brethren. The only way you could get work on the farms was if you were able to enter the house on the land. People were catching up, and more of our brethren were captured and executed. We needed to do something, so I started thinking while my stomach growled, echoing off of the walls. I needed to get invited in to be able to enter a house, that was the curse \"Mr. Dest\" cast upon us when he created us. The vampires don't like to write the history down, most of us can't even read or write, we are still doing it the old fashioned way. That means searching for any kind of rule book is out of the question. Once I get invited in though, I can freely walk in forever thats a fact. \"I wonder if animals can invite us inside?\" I muttered to myself before falling into laughter. \"I wonder why we can enter businesses and establishments but not personal homes\" I thought to myself before loudly yelling \"Aha!\". I started connecting the dots. All stores in town have a wooden sign that says \"Welcome\" or something in that variant. \"I wonder...\" I thought before rushing outside with the biggest grin on my face.\n\n I had to test this! No way it could be this simple. It couldn't be, right? I ran straight towards the salesman of the town, he was a human but he was an ally, getting paid by the vampires for insider information. He didn't care much about us, his eyes only saw gold. In a way we weren't that much different, he would hurt and scam people for gold, we would hurt people for blood. Ah blood, just the thought of it makes me go mad.\n\n I arrived at the store of the salesman. \"Hiya, Darren!\" I said as my eyes suddenly locked on that one particular blue vein that was sticking out in his neck as if it was the head of a deer that just heard something making a noise in the woods. \"You up for making some gold?\" I asked while scanning through his items, \"Im looking for something people in the town all need. Something like a rocking chair for a porch, or someth...\" I didn't even finish my sentence, because I had found it. I pointed my finger at the pile of empty brown doormats. \"PERFECT\" I grasped out of happiness. \"Whats with the strange behaviour?\" said Darren. I looked at him like I could murder him at that instance. I want you to paint all these mats with the word \"Welcome\", use white paint so it's easy to read and make the letters big. I threw a bag of gold on the counter and started waiting.\n\nAn hour later he was done, still with a question mark on his face. \"I still don't understand why you wanted me to do this.\" he said as he sighed out of relief that he was done. \"Shhhh, no questions\" I say as I giggle like a little school girl while cracking my fingers. \"Any customers who come in, try to sell them mats for a cheap price, you better get a list of the persons names who buy them and more of those bags will appear\" He obeyed like the good little human he was.\n\nThe following day I went back there, feeling as ill as a dog who didn't eat anything for weeks. As if maggots were eating me from the inside out, the pain was unbearable. \"Got the list for you, we sold out all of them\". That gave me an adrenaline rush, as if I was a mortal kid again who just found a toy collection. I rushed out of there and checked the first name on the list. As it was a small town, everyone knew each other by name so that shouldn't be a problem. He lived fairly close so I rushed there. I noticed the welcome mat, even went up and stood on it, knocking on the door at the same time. \"Hiya! James\" I said. \"I was close and was pretty thirsty, mind if I come in for a glass of water?\". He opened the door but didn't invite me in, he waited for me to enter. I slowly lifted my foot and tried to step inside, and it worked. \"IT WORKED!\" I thought to myself. Making it hard for me not to laugh maniacally.\n\nIt worked",

            "comment": "My parents were the sort of people who bought me a welcome mat as a house warming gift when I finally struck it out on my own. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against welcome mats, they're fine. They're the sort of thing that you don't buy when you first move into a new place. So, it's not like I had one already. But, it wasn't really something I particularly wanted, or even cared about having. My parents had no idea, or didn't really care, what I might actually want. They just wanted to give off the impression that they're nice people who do nice things, just as long as it didn't require any work. So buying me a house-warming gift was part of standard protocol, even if it was something I didn't particularly care for. \n\nI looked at it after I unwrapped it, it was so generic. It didn't even reflect anything about my style or interests. Just a gray mat with the word \"Welcome\" on it. I tried my best to smile and thank my parents, \"Oh, thank you. I didn't have one of these already.\" \n\nMy mom smiled back at me, \"Now we can come and visit you any time we want.\" \n\nI looked back at her, puzzled. My dad answered my puzzled expression, \"... because it says 'Welcome'.\" *Yes, very funny, dad.*\n\nI thanked them again as their visit grew towards an end, and ushered them out. As we walked out the door together, I set the mat outside the door. I was glad I wouldn't be seeing them again for a while, but on the off-chance they would come to visit me, I wanted them to see I was using their gift.\n\nBut, I didn't get the once-in-a-while visits I was hoping for. They kept finding excuses to come and visit me. They wanted to make sure my fire alarms were in working order, or that my sink wasn't leaking, or that my shower floor wasn't too slippery. They wanted to come over to tell me about the latest crazy gossip they heard. They would complain about drama-filled lives, or complain that I wasn't calling them often enough. It just got more and more frequent the longer I lived away from home. They even started coming around at odd hours of the night. \n\nFinally, one time I came home, and my mom was there adjusting the furniture. I stared at her in disbelief, in front of the still-open door, as she nattered something about how I should really not have the TV across from the window. \"... you would get a much better picture without all that glare...\" \n\n\"Mom,\" I said as I continued staring. I honestly didn't even know how she got in. \"What are you doing here?\" \n\nShe stared back at me, with hurt eyes. \"What? Is your own mother not allowed to visit? I didn't realize I wasn't welcome here.\" Then she started to cry. \n\nI immediately reacted by consoling her, \"No, you're fine mom. Of course you're allowed to visit.\"\n\nHer tears instantly vanished, and she went back to rearranging my furniture. I walked back out the door enraged. As I walked out fuming, I thought about what vampires my parents were. Then, I saw that stupid welcome mat still sitting there. I kicked it in frustration. But, after I kicked it, I saw something gold sticking out from underneath it. \n\nUnder my welcome mat, there was a key.",

Leaning her head against the car window, misery tinged the blur of trees and rolling hills outside in grey. Nevermind that they were in fact mostly grey. \n\nNot even her pulp novel, purchased by a penitent parent, could hold her attention. If only her mother hadn't taken this new job, hadn't taken them away to this land of perpetual twilight. The strangling of the engine ended her reverie. \"We are here\".\n\nHer parents could have at least tried to find a less ironic house. Towering gothic spires, a yawning entrance into the shingled maw of an old Victorian manor. Even a lone raven hopping around the yard and croaking curses at the new tenants. \"Dracula vs Wolfman\" tumbled out of her lap and underfoot as she emerged from the car. After unloading she found it lying in the mud, spine broken.\n\nWhen darkness fell, there came a knock on the door.\n\nTwo pale middle aged women, one holding a casserole and the other a parcel wrapped in brown paper, smiled tightly. \"Welcome to the neighborhood!\" the one with the casserole trilled. Her mom, who had answered the door, invited them in. \"Oh, that won't be necessary\" the other woman replied, handing her mother the parcel. \"Please enjoy this blood pudding as well. It takes some getting used to, but it is a local delicacy and in time you will learn to love it.\" Maria hung back during this exchange. Something about the women seemed off. Perhaps it was the way they smiled. Without showing their teeth. \n\nAfter they left, her mom unwrapped the package. It was a welcome mat. \"Oh how thoughtful!\" her mother exclaimed \"See Maria? The people here are just as nice as in Pennsylvania\". By the time her mother turned around after placing the mat in front of their door, Maria was already upstairs.\n\nMidnight. The witching hour.\n\nMaria woke up from dreams of dark shifting landscapes with an incredible thirst. She felt her way down the spiral stairs, clutching the banster to fight off disorientation from her concentric descent. The moon afforded just enough light for Maria to see movement in every shadow. \n\nFinally in the kitchen, she grabbed a glass from one of the many cardboard boxes stacked along the walls. Water gushed from the ancient pipes into her cup. She gulped it greedily, some dribbling down her chin, although it had an unpleasant metallic taste. Grimacing, she filled the cup again and turned back to her room. \n\nA figure loomed on the opposite side of the kitchen table, swallowing what little light was left in the room. Maria dropped the glass, shattering it on the ground. \"Whwhwhat are you doing here?\" She took a step back, too fearful to notice the broken glass piercing her bare feet.\n\n\"The same as you my child, a drink\".\n\n",

How does that even work, isn't the idea of having a doormat fundamentally set the conditions by which entry is expected\" \n\n\n\nThis was a standard argument between Shin and I, well in reality it wasn't an argument so much as an exploration of the systems by which our lives (or lack there of were governed). \n\n\n\n\"The Humans have it so much simpler\", A favorite quip of Shin, \"They can have infinite interpretations of their scripture, and none of it ties to any sort of arbitrary rule sets.\".\n\n\n\n\"They can't eat pork or something\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure they can, they just don't, have you ever tried to enter a dwelling with 'The dog must approve all vistors', you physically can't. How real can their rules be if they aren't tied to some sort of consequence\"\n\n\n\"It's not like you need to commit a felony to get blood these days I mean you can just buy...\"\n\n\n\"That's not really the point. It just seems...\"\n\n\n\n\"Seriously, this is the 100th time we have had this conversation\", I started to get annoyed, \"It should just be nice to know that there is a set of rules in place. The Humans have no actual evidence of anything. The fact that you can't enter a dwelling if there is any ambiguity should be comforting if anything. It implies that there is in fact a structure, and purpose to our existence. You don't have to believe, you simply know, and you know that other entities exist as well.\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh? What do you mean\"\n\n\n\n\"Well think about it, Our experiments show that intent of the external party is necessary. That's why just saying the words 'Come in or Welcome' isn't enough. Otherwise 'don't come in', 'you're not welcome' etc. would all work. Knowing that the external party has to intend to invite you in is key. Humans don't have that, they can't tell if anyone else is anything more than a figment of their imaginations, they aren't really 'I think therefore I am\" so much as they are 'I think therefore something is'\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah but what you're actually saying is that we aren't anything other than 'You think therefore I am' as we're interdependent\", Shin said. \"Doesn't that mean that we are potentially just figments of their imagination?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah but at least you know the 'they' is there, 'they' can represent god, the matrix, the universal force, whatever... anyway are you going to hog the O-neg or what\"\n\n\n\n\"Here\", Shin tossed over the the container, and I caught it and took a good long drink.\n\n\n\n\"Phew\", I said putting down the container, \"One thing I'll say for 'they', their blood is top notch\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, just wish 'they' weren't quite such officious bureaucrats\", Shin Remarked. \n\n\n\n\"Could be worse\" I said \"at least we don't randomly turn into dogs whenever the moon's out.\"",

            "comment": "[On mobile, will reformat later].  \n[Story complete, many fixes on the way.]\n\nMelvin and Marlene had been living as a happy couple, roaming the Continental US as regular tourists, taking in all the sights to be seen at every city of every state, to occupy their time awarded them for just so happening to be century-old vampires. They could spin a yarn of stories so long that it could wrap up the Empire State Building as some sort of festive cozie. Or at least, they thought so. That's the next destination for this adventurous couple. The Big Apple. The sights, the smells, the food, the... *other* food... etc.\n\nHaving booked a red-eye flight to the big city, Melvin and Marlene were very anxious. Miami was a hot and, frankly, very sunny place. More sun means more sunscreen, and applying sunscreen by the handful every thirty minutes is a lot of trouble. Sure, brimmed hats make life easier, but how do you swim with one of those!? New York, New York was the perfect place to go. Further north, less sun, lower medical bills on account of burns. It's very hard to relay your medical history as a vampire. One can't exactly admit that their auntie Griselda has been prone to frequent fainting due to a change of diet in the early 1600's.\n\nThe young-looking couple shuffle off of their plane, make their way through baggage claim, and head off to their appointed destination. They had rented a small apartment for a few months because they could no longer make use of their minibus as a sort of \"home base\" in such a blustering metropolis. This traffic was atrocious, and parking meters are more tedious to pay off than a blood pact with a wendigo. The overpayed taxi driver drops the Caves off at the intended complex for their three month stay, and they make their way to room 101, the landlord's personal room. They knock, and a short lady in pink answers the door.\n\n\"Wowee, when you said late, you weren't kidding! Did the plane fly across the Pacific!?\"  \n\"Sorry, miss Anderson, we couldn't, ah, *afford* to take a day plane.\"  \n\"What do you mean? Shouldn't day and night flights be about the same? And if you can't afford a plane ticket, what makes you think you can afford rent in such a city as this?\"  \nMarlene didn't know how to respond. It's hard to apply sunscreen IN a plane, let alone bring it in her carry on through the checkpoint. She smiled nervously. And awkwardly. *Just drop it, lady!*, she thought. *You're making me incredibly uncomfortable!*  \nMiss Anderson seemed to get the point. She turned to the more silent partner of the Caves.  \n\"You must be Mr. Melvin, I presume? Cat got your tongue?\"  \n\"More times than I care to count, ma'am.\"  \nShe chortled. *What a strange man. What a strange* ***couple***.\n\nMiss Anderson showed them to room 306, their designated living quarters for the next three months. A quick tour, and she was out. 3:30 am doesn't wear well on the older folks, and Miss Anderson was older than she liked to admit.\n\nMelvin and Marlene looked around a while. Fridge, beds, sofa, TV, you name it, it was there. They were ecstatic. This was their first time to actually stay IN a  city, rather than near one. Night flights were going to be so gorgeous, and watching the new year's fireworks from on top of a skyscraper rather than on TV or from the ground? Priceless. Marlene needed to get out, even if for just a few minutes. The weather was sublime, and if she flew high enough, she might even see the stars.\n\nShe told Melvin she was going out.  \n\"Hmmmmm.... Go for it. I'm rather in the mood for a nap.\"  \nMarlene opened the window and jumped off the balcony. She fluttered towards the heavens, and dove into the ever-active city. It was like soaring through a tunnel of lights, a florescent valley. Exhilarating, haphazardous, and ever so gleeful, Marlene graced the skies with self-named \"Woopdi Do's\" and \"Whirly Bird's.\" She had her fun, but she needed to get back home.\n\nShe lands on the window sill, and immediately realizes a problem.  \n\"Melvin.... May I come in?\"  \n\". . . What do you-. . . Damn.\"  \nHow exactly do you explain that you need your landlord to be the one to put a welcome mat on your balcony?",

The line bustles to an end and the materials are put away. Fur. Rubber. Shit like that. Shit to make mats.\n\nMy boss makes a killing off these mats because the best, most experienced and skilled vampires make a killing off of the blood they get using the mats compared to vampires who need to ask to come in, befriend, and then betray their new friends when everybody goes to sleep. These other guys only have to come during the day as a mat salesman and come back later after he's taken a shit or gotten lunch. Then he drains his patrons, resells the blood for profit, gets a real human meal with the 20 bucks they score off the mat, and buys *another* mat. Fuckin geniuses.\n\nThe only reason the rest of us factory workers don't do what they do is because we aren't exactly \"good at selling,\" or   \"people persons,\" or \"human-like,\" or \"can afford a suit, tie, and hat.\" Plus the mats are too fucking expensive for vampire money. Shit's like .001 on the dollar. We're basically slaves. Yet vampires. Somehow it works, stop asking questions.\n\nThis week I'm planning a heist because this week's paycheck won't be enough to pay rent. I know I should lay off the take-out food but I fuckin love me some panda express. What I'll do is wait up in a tree above old man jenkin's home, the only home in town without a welcome mat. Jesse Dentine is the best vampire salesman ever and has dibs on that house. But that doesn't mean he's good at defending himself. Before he reaches the door, I'll jump his cold-blooded ass and steal the mat. \n\nHere I am up in the tree looming over the walkway up to the front door... I'm waiting and feeling a little guilty, but it's for the best because men who steal are desperate: at least that's my excuse. Here he comes. I gotta time this right. Oh fuck, if I fail i'll be found out and late on rent. oh fuck oh fuck just JUMP ALREADY.\n\nI land on top of him, crushing him into the ground. He's fuckin *dead*. Oh shit, I'm a murderer. How am I gonna cover this up? I can't leave the dead body because then human's will find out about us and kill our economy. Can you bury a vampire? What if you don't bury it 6 feet under?

            "comment": "You'd think I would have learned by now. After the third time I was \"put to death\" for sucking some dude's blood in the park downtown you'd think I would have figured it out. But the problem with sneaking into people's bedrooms to feed myself is something the Governors came up with about 500 years ago. I was a fledgling at that time, but had come to enjoy the freedom of going in a window at night to suck a pretty virgin's blood. Although truth be told, there are many more ugly virgins than there are pretty ones. I digress. The interesting thing about the Rule of Invitation is that a lot more places, like inns and hotels, fall under the category of a house than you would think.\n\nLuckily shortly after the rule was set in place, I had a remarkable idea and started to take up woodworking. In this endeavor, I set out to circumvent the Rule that had been set up for our kind. The original idea was based on a theory that if the main entrance had some sort of invitation implied, I would be able to enter any of the doors (or windows as I prefer) of the establishment.\n\nSo as I improved my woodworking, I began to sell doors and the like to the establishments I hoped to frequent for my meals. After the first wood burned \"Welcome\" sign I sold to an inn who wanted a diverse clientele, they started to sell left and right. The most amazing thing about this was that my theory was right, it allowed me to bypass the rule and I was free to make my feedings a more private affair again. Soon, it was common to see these signs on almost every inn for 100 miles. It became a sort of status symbol and I was the only one making them.\n\nWord spread among my kind, few as we are, of the success I had with getting around this annoyance. Unfortunately, I had to travel quite a ways around the countryside to make sure the people staying at these inns would not get suspicious of my true intentions. The last thing I wanted was a rumor of dead people at the inn around the corner from my home. After all, it was typically my last resort in case a craving came over me when I hadn't prepared to travel.\n\nThen it just so happened that I had even more luck in store. Individuals started to take notice of the \"Welcome\" signs at all the places they frequented. They started to equate them with a certain status. This led to a local rug maker being commissioned to make one for a patron's front door. Partially the reasoning I heard behind making it a rug was to be able to kick the dirt off before entering their home. But I was thrilled with this development. It just so happened the first commission was the local Mayor. This equated another kind of status with the decoration and prompted other individuals to follow suit in order to improve their social standing.\n\nI'm sure you see where this is going, but my original handiwork insured that my brethren and I would have unlimited access to private properties in addition to the establishments we had already gained access to. No more feigning death while being strung up in the town square. No more public humiliation at the hands of these inferior beings. I could finally enjoy my meal in the peace and quiet of someone elses bed.",

When he broke the rules (most of his daily endeavours) the Council continued, somehow, to retain faith in him. My latest attempt at convincing them otherwise proved to be a failure once again. \"I'm so, so sorry guys. I didn't know he was going to, like, flip his shit when he came home.\" Sucking the life out of a human child? Not going to draw attention. At all. When his father arrives home from work? One would face the consequences. Not Aaron, who is impervious to any kind of consequence. An apology or two, and he's free to divulge our secrets once more. I think it became time to divulge a secret of my own. Or rather, Aaron would do it for me.\n\n\"I think you should turn yourself in.\"\n\"Turn myself in?\" Aaron's eyes widened in fear,  all signs of his usual arrogance gone.\n\"It would only be right, wouldn't it?\" I gave him a wink and a grin. The idiot couldn't have formed his own full sentence if he tried. This would be easy.\n\"The Council has planned a takeover of the prison system. With the increased media coverage we've decided to be slightly more aggressive.\" I checked around me to make sure no-one was listening, and lowered my voice a notch just in case. \"When you are arrested, convert the worst criminals you can find. Serial killers, gang members, child rapists... Together you will escape. If not, we will break you out.\"\nHis boisterous grin returned and he strode toward the exit with purpose.\n\"Oh and if they ask you questions, just tell them you got in because of welcome mats or something. It will be hilarious.\"\nVampires loved being mysterious, they didn't tell these newbies much.\n\nThat same night, the first media coverage came. Aaron in handcuffs being guided towards a police car. I was paying more attention to my bowl of cheerios than the interview, but I heard him answer a question with \"Oh yes, we only drink human blood and we actually get in thanks to welcome mats!\" After almost spraying milk out of my nose, I looked up to catch a flash of white teeth before the cop closed the door.\n\nThe Council, as expected, had finally had enough and the cop checked his rear view mirror at some point during the drive to see Aaron ritualistically executed and beheaded. I stepped out into the cold night air for a satisfaction cigarette and with a glimpse of the full moon I felt my spine tingle and hair grow in places it shouldn't. I pulled my eyes away. Within days any person with media coverage would remove the welcome mats from their doorways, denying access to human blood and greatly weakening the Vampire race. As a High Priest of the Vampiric Council I would see to it that this empire would fall, even if it takes thousands of years and more blabbering idiots.\n\nThose pretentious bastards can suck it.",

            "comment": "It was her favorite night of the year, and one of the few in which people willingly opened their doors to strangers. Halloween. Josie could barely contain her excitement, as she rose early that evening. Luckily, her windows had been treated against UV rays, and she had black out curtains everywhere. She stretched lazily, and opened the curtains surrounding her elegant four post bed. The room seemed bright to her eyes, but they soon adjusted. It had to be about 4pm, though evening was beginning earlier every day. The floor was cold. She frowned, and scooted her feet hurriedly into a pair of fuzzy slippers sitting beside her bed. They would be considered \"cute\" by most, but for some reason walking in the brightly colored unicorn slippers brought her a perverse sense of glee. \n\nJosie shuffled over to her towering wardrobe, looking for an appropriate outfit for the best day of the year. There was the baby blue ball gown decorated with cream lace and ruffles. No, that would require a hoop skirt, petticoat, and corset.  Far too much effort, and she would stand out. She hadn't lived this long by standing out. She sifted through the clothing with a delicate hand. They were original dresses from the periods after all, not costumes. Josie clicked her tongue in distaste. A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. \"Come in, Thomas.\" She could hear his heartbeat, slow, but still present. A link to the outside world. \n\nA sullen looking young man entered cautiously. His brown hair stuck up haphazardly, and his clothing was atrocious. Josie sighed, as Thomas struck an indignant pose. \"I hate it when you call me that.\" He huffed, leaning against the door frame while attempting to act as if he were indifferent. The thumping of his heartbeat was suddenly loud, fast, and incredibly distracting. \"My name is Tom.\" He wore a band tshirt, and ripped dirty jeans. He looked completely out of place with the opulent surroundings.\n\n\"Your proper name is Thomas, and that is what I shall call you.\" Josie slammed the door of the wardrobe shut. Tom shifted uncomfortably before her gaze, a large bag crinkling in his hands. The red bullseye on the bag stood out garishly. \"Now, what reason do you have for pestering me?\"\n\n\"I got you a few things for tonight-\" Tom approached her quickly as he spoke, holding out the bag. \"I thought you might need a costume, and I saw something that may be a problem.\" He looked pleased with himself, like an over eager puppy.  He pulled out a plastic bag with a picture of a scantily clad woman on it. The woman was wearing a low cut dress with high slits, beneath a waist cinching corset and a velvet cloak. The woman in the picture smiled seductively and wore fake plastic fangs. Josie laughed raucously suddenly. She couldn't believe humans thought that was what a vampire looked like. \"It will help you blend in at the party.\" Tom's face flushed as Josie stepped closer to hold the costume bag. In truth, she suspected Tom just wanted her to wear it. She eyed the healing bite marks on his neck for a moment, her fangs extending. She shook the thought away. She had fed on him recently. He also pulled out a large dark mat that said Welcome on it. \"They're getting more creative with welcome mats now. They don't all invite you inside. Would you believe I saw some with just pumpkins on them? Others just said Hello.\" He snorted derisively. \"I thought if I replaced the one at the party, it would make it easier on you.\" Josie oohed with delight, her vibrant blue eyes sparkling as she patted Tom on the head. \n\nShe leaned close, and whispered in his ear, enjoying the shiver that passed through him. \"That's why you're my favorite pet.\" She took the costume with a small amount of displeasure, and went to change in her bathroom.\n\n\n\n\nI know it's a little camp-y, but all I could think of was \"What if she went to the house and the doormat didn't welcome her inside?\".

Stories of vampires have been spread for so long I don't think anyone truly believes or considers us to be real. So we are to start telling knew stories. By posting in forums and publishing fiction we will begin to paint our people in a more realistic light. (Or by posting extremely late to a random WP) If we can get our human brethren to consider us as people and not monsters then it will be the time for us to officially announce ourselves. Until then, let me, obviously a fictional character, tell you about an interaction I had with my best friend last week.\nI had been hoping to tell Emily the truth about myself since we were in high school together. I knew I must always keep my racial identity a secret, but also that obtaining a human partner was one of the highest pleasures and honors a vampire can obtain. Naturally, I went to an unnamed private school through elementary, before moving onto a human public school. Using the guise of privileged and wealth to keep out humans, these private elementary schools teach young vampires our history and the importance of us keeping ourselves hidden. I remember being taught about the Salem witch trials and McCarthyism at a young age, as an example of how hysterical any group of people can become. The witch trials scared me the most because as our professor explained, there weren't even any witches involved. It was all a reaction of group think combined with fear. Part of me was scared that if I ever confided in Emily she would become terrified of me and never speak to me again. \nI was originally planning to tell her the summer after we turned 21, but then they actually repealed The Order. Its one of those things that gets brought up to the Council ever few decades, but no one expects to actually go through. As soon as I heard the vote had passed unanimously I started planning it out in my head.\nWe had lived together for 3 years now. When she announced she was going over seas for college I was so proud of her, but I could tell how nervous she was. I offered to go with since all my schooling would be online and she couldn't have been more excited. In truth my online schooling involved a simple but substantially lucrative career in human sociology. Its not as fancy as it sounds, I spend a lot of time online lurking on human sites, and writing reports of my findings for The Archive. Maybe I could find a way to break the ice to her with my work. \nThat same day I brought her out for a few drinks at the pub down the street and found us a back booth. I had everything planned out in my head, but I was extremely nervous. \n\"Do you like vampire stories?\" I blatantly asked.\n\"Not in particular, I mean, they are alright. Why?\"\"Because I am a vampire and I think they are a bunch of bullshit,\" I was so nervous saying this, but played it off very blatantly.\nEmily recovered from swallowing her beer the wrong way, \"Oh, really! Are you feeling marginalized, ha!\"\nI screwed up all of my resolve and plunged straight in forgetting everything I had planned to say, \"the truth is I am a vampire and I have always wanted to tell you and I don't want you to think I am crazy or believe me and be afraid of me or loose you or worse you panic and start a witch hunt,\" I quickly dissolved from my sarcastic stoic facade to honest tears and a quivering lip. I started to sob, \"You are my best friend and I want to share what I am with you, but your already looking at me like I'm crazy.\" I was fully crying into my untouched beer at this point as Emily stared at me dumbfounded and confused.\nHer reaction had transformed from amused to annoyed to concerned with my torrent of words.\n\"What are you talking about? What do you mean, are you being serious?\"\nI nodded my face in my hands as I continued to cry. I should mention at this point that Emily has seen me cry twice. The first was when we saved a baby bunny and it died, and the second was at classmate's funeral. I don't really cry, and I most certainly do not sob or bawl. She slid out from behind the table and next to me in my booth.\n\"Seriously, what is going on? You can't expect me to believe you are a vampire?\"\nI took a deep breath, \"Of course not, of course not. Lets just say, lets just say, I was for a moment. And I really did want to tell you, how would you expect me to prove it to you?\"\n\"I am not sure this is a good idea, I think we should...\"\n\"Please, Emily, hear me out and then I'll do whatever you think I should do about this, okay? Please, answer the question.\"\n\"Well, if I were to entertain this I would want proof. Like where are your fangs, and how come you can go out during the day?\"\n\"My fangs were filed when I was two like all of my kind. We have nocturnal ancestors that cause some of our kind to be sensitive to the sun just like many pale humans.\"\n\"Okay...\" she was looking at me like I was definitely crazy now, \"um garlic, silver bullets, stake to the heart?\"\n\"Garlic is a minor allergy that some of the younger generation don't even have now, but if concentrated can be used as a poison. Silver is like an allergy but a bit more complicated. It binds to receptors necessary for engaging our advanced tissue regeneration and cause us to be unable to heal. A stake to the heart would probably kill anyone. So would any bullet to the head or heart for that matter...next.\"\nShe started smiling now, decided I must be stringing her along on some strange long winded prank, \"Turn into a bat.\"\n\"Really? Just because one of my ancestors tracked sleeping pray by picking up on the squeaks of bats feasting on the insects attracted to said pray does not mean I can turn into a bat. My hearing is far superior to yours however, and that is something that we could measure and prove. Anything else?\"\n\"So are you immortal?\"\nI took a deep breath finally feeling a bit more stabilized and prepared for the big one, the one that actually might scare people.\n\"Vampires were created hundreds of years ago by cross breading a Vamperic beast with humans. I don't want to go into that mess too much right now, but long story short all those monsters are gone and what you are left with is me, the modern day vampire. We are mostly human, with a few other genetic traits. One is the ability to restore tissue and damaged cells at an accelerated rate. This is what silver poisoning inhibits. In order to trigger the chemical reactions that initiate our body to go into healing overdrive, we have to consume blood. Human blood is the most compatible since, we are mostly human ourselves. Being exposed to direct sunlight also inhibits this process. Satisfied?\"\nLooking at her now I could see the fear beginning to creep into her eyes. Mostly, for what she must be imagining is wrong with my mind, but I could smell another fear beginning even if she wasn't aware of it yet. Primal fear.\n\"Geese, um....don't you have to ask permission to come into anyone's home?\"\nI started to back pedal, I would play it off as a joke, \"Awe you got me, just yesterday I walked into Sam's dorm. You scolded me for it! I tried...\" I don't think she was buying it.\n\"Yeah, and you justified it because he had a welcome mat!\"\n\n***I hope you find these. Please talk to me Emily. I'm sorry, it was my fault.\n\nEdit: Formatting issues.",

There is always quality blood at the red cross, stalking prey at night is ***not*** hard, and there are plenty of people who still *have* mats.\"\n\nJoanna, and half of the other the members blushed in embarrassment, refusing to meet his blank expression that after such a condescending response. The rest looked at him with spite, but could think of no response.\n\nJohn Dongle turned to look at his subordinates and met Milton's gaze with the up most disappointment \"Are you saying you you are incapable of increasing sales? If so, you should leave right now.\" \n\nMilton, got up and began to leave \"It's not worth our time, if you can't listen to reason then fire me. You have no legal right to keep me here and I will not quit.\"\n\nHe stopped, and in a seemingly patronizing voice he bowed and said \"Good night, my king.\"\n\nJohn Dongle yelled \"***YOU HAVE NOTHING SO YOU QUIT!?! WE WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND MAKE YOU SUFFER!!!***\" It echoed through the building, the yell reverberating through each and everyone of them. \n\nMilton stood, expressionless, genuinely considering whether John Dongle was being sincere. It was definitely out of character. Milton could not conceive of how a vampire could be so human. Alas, he new he had to go with the safest option. took off his coat, hung it and sat back down very robotic like.\n\nThe room was tense, no one said a word. Milton sat there, thinking. Everyone was locked on either Milton or John Dongle. Only Joana was switching between staring at Milton or watching John Dongle carefully.\n\n\"Well, what if we gave them out for free.\" his monotone response provided release from the tension of John Dongles threat and their situation but his blas\u00e9 manner further infuriated everyone.\n\nJohn Dongle laughed, \"You should be the King of the Night.\"\n\nMilton smiled, in what could only be described as a warm smile. Yet, this was the first time anyone of them had seen ***it*** smile. The temperature dropped, goosebumps, and then Milton responded cheerfully \"Anytime Johnathan, anytime.\"",

            "comment": "I was thirsty, so, as is customary ever since we tricked those mortal fools into making everything easy, I looked for a house with a \"welcome\" doormat in front of the door. Free snacks after all, and I really wasn't in the mood of chatting up some fool at a bar and going home with them, like we used to do in the shitty old days.....\n\nThe door wasn't even locked. Not that a lock would have mattered to a vampire anyways, but still. Weird. In retrospect, that should have tipped me off....    \nThe hallway was weirdly narrow, barely any room to move around, but thirsty as I was I ignored that weirdness as well and walked straight in, towards my snack. \n\nSuddenly, a sprinkler turned on. I let out a cry of anger - what asshole puts a sprinkler in the hallway?! Well, no matter, I'd just make that fucker pay... \n\nThen, unbearable pain. I looked down. There was a stake in my chest, just barely missing the heart. Lucky me, I wasn't done for yet but damn it was unpleasant even so. I'd have to get out of here, in my current state I wouldn't be able to fight off the human who had built this trap... I tried to turn into mist and get the hell out but it didn't work.\n\n*\"Don't bother trying. Holy water in that sprinkler, you're nothing special anymore.\"* A guy with a crossbow had appeared behind me, from a hidden door presumably?!\n\n*\"So I was right. It's the doormats. That's how you leeches could breed so much lately, why my job is so hard.\"* \n\nThe man looked pleased. \n\n*\"Oh well, a trick is only good so long as the victim doesn't realize they're being tricked. Once they do, you just become very predictable..... This little installment is going to clean you out very quickly once we install it into every house everywhere\"*\n\nI tried to laugh dismissively. Didn't quite work though, the pain was too much, it came across as pathetic instead. \"You can't. With this installation, you'd kill every human visitor as well, and since we got rid of castle laws in most of the world you'll just end up in prison.\"\n\n*\"Ahahaa no. Look closely: Mirror on the far wall. Laser behind you, and a receptor. When the beam is measured, the pressure plate won't trigger the stakes. But since you guys don't appear in mirrors... \"* The asshole laughed loudly now. \n\n*\"Well, I guess that's Vampires: 0, Humanity: 1. Was fun talking to you but I have a job to do soo.... Damn I really need a cool catchphrase. Yippie-Ki-Yay Motherfucker? Cheesy. Whatever.\"*\n\nHe pulled the trigger. This time, he didn't miss the heart. ",

            "comment": "Matt was tired of his life. He was struggling to get a topic to research on. He was well known as the world's premier authority on Vampire studies, but that didn't satisfy him. He wanted to find the current whereabouts of vampires. Most of all, he wanted the answer to the greatest mystery related to vampires: their survival. \n\nVampires were mystical creatures that were physically superior to humans, yet looked the same. They were also generally cleverer than humans. However, they needed human blood to survive, and so had never been able to take over the world. Their magical origins caused another weakness: Vampires were unable to enter houses uninvited. The 22nd century had been one of mistrust, and Matt couldn't think of a way that the vampires could have survived that time. Recently, many prominent leaders of the world had been killed in their sleep, and the vampires had come forward claiming responsibility for the attacks. The world had scoffed at this statement, believing that the vampires could not enter the homes. Yet Matt couldn't shake off the feeling that thr vampires were telling the truth. And so he puzzled over the method of entry, and did not question the fact that the vampires entered the homes. \n\nAfter months of research, Matt was very close to the answer. The killings of the leaders had continued, and the world was finally considering the possibility of the vampires being the murderers. Matt had been approached a week ago by various newspapers, who had questions on how the vampires had entered the house. Matt had studied each killing, and had concluded that there was no flaw in the security of the houses. As he went to sleep, the door bell rang. Matt was annoyed, but went to open the door. For security reasons, he had a dual door system, to ensure that he wasn't attacked the moment he opened the door. Matt watched the screen, and saw that his visitor was a well dressed man. As he operated the switch to close the main door, he noticed the welcome mat of his house. That was when a sudden thought hit him: What if welcome mats were a form of Invitation? If they were, the visitor could be a vampire. Matt switched on the infrared camera, and he could see that his visitor was not human. Suddenly, there was a thud on the door as the visitor reached the second door. Matt rushed to his bedroom, and turned on his laptop. He had to send this information to somebody before he was kidnapped or killed. As he began typing put the message, he heard the bedroom door crack open. The vampire entered in and spoke \"Mr. Matt, I believe you have found out our technique to escape our weakness. You know, it was the grand vampire of my clan that popularised welcome mats. Now that I've told you this, I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you. We believe that you are the greatest threat to us, and you proved us right today by guessing our secret.\". With that, the vampire slit Matt's throat. As his eyes turned glassy, the vampire told him\" Goodbye Matt.\" ",

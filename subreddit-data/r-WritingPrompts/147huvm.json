The second at 16, which determines the power, by their most trusted person. Your most trusted person seemingly misunderstands and names you after their grandparent.",

As he finished writing the name the letters glowed briefly before fading and remaining in a warm red ink.\n As per tradition since he was identified as my most trusted person he's been unable to discuss the names or ceremony with me. I felt I could rely on him to give me something interesting though.\nAs the ceremony leader surveyed the book I noticed him pause and give a confused glance at Karl. A wave of panic suddenly hot me as I too glanced his way but he gave me a reassuring thumbs up and I eased a little. Still I was eager to find what name he chosen so I returned my attention to the ceremony.\n\n\nThe book was raised and the leader spoke.\n\"The name has been accepted by the book. I can reveal the most trusted friend has chosen...\"\nAgain he passed , why.\n\"Richard, let it adorn the candidate with new capabilities to match\"\nThere was a confused spluttering of applause by the crowd except Karl who was enthusiasticly clapping as he came over to me.\n\"Dude Karl what the hell?\"\n\"What?! I named you after my grandfather, he was the bravest ,strongest person I know. I thought you'd be thrilled\" He frowned but I couldn't feel sorry for him right now.\n\"Your grandfather on the German side of the family?\"\n\"Yeah , what's the problem\"\n\" Richard, Richard Melker?\"\n\"And?\"\n\"The one everyone calls Dick?\"\n\"Ooooooh\"",

A fraction of him hurt or wounded is a win for us no matter how small, even the best soldiers fall to overwhelming force!\"  \n\n\nAs I spoke I heard something that made my blood run cold a ringing-out shotgun blast from somewhere far in the base. A Revenant ran to me screeching, I understood immeaditaly.  Rallying my troops I spoke \"HIS WILL IS STRONG BUT OURS IS ETERNAL, DRAG HIM TO HELL!\" fist pumping into the air as my troops marched toward the sound getting into their defensive positions.  \n\n\nRunning to my command station I watched in horror on camera as the newfound power he had willed objects into existence causing even more increased bodily harm to my troops than before. I hyperventilated as he ripped apart room after room of my best soldiers. After our first death, Hell priest Deag grav hogged all the best troops leaving me to create my own, as I sent out the Doom hunter I began to sob knowing that in a matter of minutes, he would reach and kill me with that green power of his. Watching him approach my door I got on my knees to beg for mercy only to instantly be crushed by an oversized green hand, struggling I heard the rev of a chainsaw and I closed my eyes.",

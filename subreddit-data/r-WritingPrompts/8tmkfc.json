            "comment": "\"You're going to have to say that again, because I have no idea what in the fuck you're trying to say,\" I inform the sparkling conversationalist that just conversed in little more than grunts and growls.\n\n\"Nobody's spoken that language in thousands of years,\" the young man behind the counter informs me, seemingly confused as to how I didn't understand him the first time.\n\n\"Cool, can I get my food now?\" I ask, impatiently. I really don't want to get mixed up in anything today.\n\n\"I don't think you understand - that language? It's more than dead. It's extinct. How do you know it?\"\n\nI pinch the bridge of my nose with an exasperated sigh. It's damn near midnight, and I don't feel like going through the whole process of explaining my \"skill\".\n\n\"Congratulations; I don't care. Can I get my food now?\"\n\n\"Not until you tell me how you know that language,\" he hisses at me. \"My family have kept that language alive, but secret, for generations.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it's not very extinct, is it?\" I lean against the counter, the exhaustion of the day catching up with me. \"Look, man - I just have this ability, to speak the native language of whoever I speak to. Can't understand it, but it just comes out of my mouth. It's useful in a traffic jam, but that's about it.\" I yawn, my eyes drifting shut as I feel myself growing even more tired. \"So I don't know your fuckin bullshit language - I just want some food.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\n\"Once again, I do not care. My food, please.\"\n\nHe purses his lips and completes the transaction. Finally!\n\nAfter waiting for what feels like an eternity, I finally get my tray of food, and simply nod to the cashier as I head over to the closest empty table. Being the only customer in here, it's not hard to find one.\n\nBefore I even have a chance to eat, my newfound irritation sits down across from me. I close my eyes, and take a deep breath. \"Look, can I just enjoy my food in peace?\" Taking another look at my burger, I mutter to myself, \"okay, maybe 'enjoy' is pushing it...\"\n\n\"If what you told me about your ability is true, then we could use your help - there's a word we've lost, a very important word. The only word left unknown in the language, in fact.\" He leans forward a bit. \"And it's the word that opens an ancient safe, in which who knows what kind of riches are stored. If you help me open it, I'll give you some of it.\"\n\nI stare at him, the cogs working in my tired brain. Eventually, I decide to just humor him - after all, money is money. \"I'll open it, so long as I don't have to speak to anyone else in your family.\"\n\nHe nods, and I sigh as I quickly scarf down my food. We head outside, exchanging no conversation whatsoever, and share a quiet car ride to his home. It doesn't take very long to get there.\n\nIt's an old house - maybe seventy years old, judging by the area and the style of the design. \n\nHe leads me to a shed behind the house, and opens it with a key from his belt.\n\n\"This better be a decent amount of money, because you're probably very fired right about now,\" I mutter. He chuckles at that, and silently opens the doors, letting enough moonlight in for me to see the single box on a small table. It looks like it's steel, and it doesn't seem to have any seams at all.\n\n\"It's a code - and we know all the numbers in it, expect the zero. We don't know what that translates to. The code is just the numbers one to nine, and then zero. Could you say that, and maybe your ability will automatically translate it?\"\n\nI nod, and approach it while clearing my throat. I speak as if I'm speaking to him - I don't know what the limits of my ability are in terms of just speaking aloud to nobody in particular. I list one to nine, and, my heart pounding and nerves on edge despite how tired I am, I say the final number: zero.\n\nAs soon as I say it, my throat feels like it's on fire. I fall to me knees, coughing and hacking, and feeling as if I'm going to die. Tears come to my eyes, and I feel something coming out of my throat - not through my esophagus, as if I'm vomiting, but my trachea. It's painful, but I don't think it's causing any kind of damage.\n\nOne huge cough brings with it the cessation of pain, and the sound of metal falling onto wood. I open my eyes in confusion, and see I've coughed up a metal disk of some sort.\n\n\"What the fuck - what is this!?\" I exclaim, confused and a bit scared. I look over at my new \"friend\". \"What happened!?\"\n\nHe looks pale, and just as confused as I am. \"Y-you're speaking English now,\" he informs me. I look back down at the disk, even more confused than before. I frown, not really understanding what in the hell is going on.\n\nRegardless, I wordlessly follow a faint instinct. I pick up the disk, stand, and press it against the cube.\n\nThe disk is immediately absorbed into its mass, and I jump as a loud mechanical clunk echoes throughout the shed. Whirring and mechanical sounds persist, and I faintly hear a door open and confused voices approaching the shed. I swallow back fear and look up at...\n\n\"I never got your name,\" I announce. It seems so trivial to think of, while a solid cube makes otherwordly sounds. But it's all I can think about, oddly enough.\n\n\"William,\" he introduces himself. \"You?\"\n\n\"Simon,\" I reply. I return my attention to the cube as the sound suddenly stops, and become acutely aware of people watching me from the doorway. I hear William explaining stuff to the new observers, but find myself captivated as the cube slowly opens, transforming in ways that shouldn't be physically possible.\n\nOut of it comes a single, glowing stone. Despite my better judgement, I reach out to pick it up.\n\n\"No!\" Someone behind me exclaims. It's too late - even as they grab my shoulder, my hand has closed around the enigmatic treasure. I feel a sudden surge of energy, and my vision goes white. I feel myself fall to the floor, and then - nothing.",

Next thing I know I wake up and look around, if I had to describe it I would say it was a desert but I wouldn't say it was Earth. I saw William on the ground beside me \"Are you alright?\" I asked, he shrugged looking around \"Where are we?\" He asked I shrugged too \"I don't know!\" As he got to his feet I stared around, there was something in the distance but I couldn't make out what it was. My eyes must be adjusting as its getting clearer, oh. Its not getting clearer its getting nearer. Its people but they don't look happy and they're armed. As they got closer they shouted something but I didn't understand it, I turned to William he was looking confused but shouted something back, I didn't understand that either but realised what was going on.",

            "comment": "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\nI paused, my card already jammed into the receptacle and deducting $5.29 from my bank account.  \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nThe clerk stared at me, his green eyes narrowed.  I drew half a step back almost unconsciously.  \u201cUh.  I asked if I could have my drink cup.  You guys keep making us wait and it\u2019s kind of annoying.\u201d\n\nThe man stared at me, his lips pressed into a thin line.  \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\nAll right, the guy was clearly crazy.  I tore my debit card free, shoving it back into the holder permanently resting in my pocket.  \u201cI\u2019m trying to get a Big Mac.  What\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you insane?\u201d he hissed, leaning forward across the counter.  \u201cWhat are you *doing*?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreg?\u201d someone called from across the store.  A manager, judging by the color of their uniform.  Their voice was carefully cheerful.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing!  Just helping this gentleman out,\u201d Greg said, his face snapping back to carefully neutral as he smiled at me.  A plastic cup was shoved into my hands, along with the paper slip of my receipt.  \u201cLook - don\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d he said, his voice dropping low enough I had to lean in to hear him.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what game you think you\u2019re playing, but you can\u2019t walk in here talking gibberish.  Leave me alone.\u201d\n\nI stared at him, my mind racing, but the customers behind me were already pushing forward.  I stepped back to join the others waiting for their food, my mind churning.\n\nI had a bit of a gift.  Well, that\u2019s how I liked to think about it.  It had taken a few years to figure out - all languages sounded exactly the same to me.  No matter if I was speaking to someone blabbering on in French or chattering in Italian, it all came across as plain old English.\n\nMy parents had been freaked out, understandably.  It had taken a bit of doing to convince them I wasn\u2019t just crazy.  And as soon as we\u2019d pieced together what was going on, we\u2019d begun hiding.  It wasn\u2019t as though I could suddenly start spouting off Spanish and German, after all.  We couldn\u2019t even just leave copies of Rosetta Stone lying around meaningfully.  The instant someone I actually *knew* called me on it, the secret would be up.  I kind of valued living a normal life, too much to allow something like that to happen.\n\nTray in hand and my mediocre food steaming, I filed back to my seat.  I could feel Greg\u2019s eyes on me the whole way - staring.\n\nWhat was his problem?  Had I stuttered?\nAnd what had he meant, gibberish?  Maybe he spoke a different language, sure,  but why would that be a problem?  He should be happy that I\u2019d spoken Polish or Swahili or who-gives-a-fuck.  Maybe a bit surprised, but not *angry*.  His reaction wasn\u2019t normal at all.\n\nI couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was wrong.  Normally I would have lingered, taking my time in eating.  With the feeling of Clerk Asshat\u2019s eyes on the back of my neck, I just wanted to leave.  I shoveled my value meal down as quickly as I could, hardly tasting it.  My phone lit up with notifications, friends and family blabbering away, all wanting to know where I was.  When I\u2019d be finished with the day\u2019s chores.  Could I pick up this grocery list for them, or finish that errand?\n\nI ignored all of them.  The wrapper crumpled instantly in my hand as I pushed myself upright, dumping the whole lot of it in the trash.\n\nThe guy wasn\u2019t there.  A bit of the tension slipped out of my shoulders as I saw his station replaced by a tiny, grinning brunette.  Good.  Maybe his manager had finally taken him down a notch.\n\nThe lights on my car blinked across the parking lot at me as I stepped out of the store.  The cold air snapped me awake, back to reality in an instant.  I was letting that guy creep me out for no reason.  He was just a jerk, that was all - trapped in his minimum wage job.  Probably just a crazy, when I thought about it.  He was probably just-\n\nI yelped, eyes widening as fingers buried themselves in my hair, pulling painfully.  Someone had me.  There was something cold at my throat - cold and *sharp*.\n\n\u201cOk, asshole,\u201d Greg hissed in my ear, his voice wild.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to go for a walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the *fuck* are you-\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\nThe blade dug into my neck.  I could feel a hot line of blood dripping down my skin.  My mind raced - this was insane.  He really was crazy.  A lunatic.  He was-\n\nThere was nothing I could do to fight him as he turned me, forcing me towards the back of the store.  A dingy, beat-up station wagon waited in employee parking, the lot unlit and dismally dark.  I scanned the lot even still, ready to bellow for help at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nIt was useless.  There was no one around.  No one was going to hear.\n\nHe slammed me into the back of his car, my face pressed painfully against the glass.\n\n\u201cHow stupid do you think I am?\u201d he spat.\n\n\u201cWhat the *hell* are you talking about?\u201d I cried, shaking.\n\n\u201cWhat, you think you\u2019re being subtle?  You\u2019ll just walk in, talking the Old Tongue like you were born to it, and I\u2019ll roll over for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, dude, there\u2019s been some mistake,\u201d I moaned.  \u201cIt\u2019s-It\u2019s just something that I can do, all right?  It\u2019s not-\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said with a laugh, his fingers still pulling painfully at my hair.  \u201cLike I\u2019m going to believe *that*.\u201d\n\n\u201cI speak tongues, all right?\u201d I said, craning my head until I could look at him.  \u201cThat\u2019s all.  I don\u2019t know what you heard.  All I know is-\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long until they get here?\u201d\n\nI blinked.  \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not *stupid*,\u201d he spat.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit idly until they come to finish the job. How long until the rest of them show up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rest of *who*?\u201d I said, trying desperately to keep from crying.\n\n\u201cYou know damn well who-\u201d he said, but stopped abruptly.\n\nI blinked.\n\nSomewhere in the distance, sirens were approaching.\n\nMy heart leapt.  Police.  *Yes*.  Someone must have seen him, someone must have called the cops.  I was saved.  He\u2019d-\n\nHe let go of my hair in an instant, leaping away.  His car abandoned, he vanished into the underbrush of the woods behind the McDonald\u2019s.  I fell in a crumpled heap, my heart still pounding in my ears.\n\nTires screeched as the cop car pulled up moments later, a pair of officers piling out.\n\n\u201cSir!  Sir, are you all right?\u201d one yelled, racing over to me. \u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was- a man,\u201d I said, glancing back at the woods.  \u2018H-He had a knife.  He was crazy.  Thought I was speaking some funny language or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would he think that?\u201d the other said, his brow furrowing.\n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, instinctively clamping down.  The cops paused, staring at me.\n\n\u201cWhat, that\u2019s it?\u201d the first said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I muttered, unable to meet their eyes.  My gaze drifted, needing to find something, anything else to look at.  The flashing lights of their cars drew my eyes in, holding my gaze.\n\nI froze.\n\n\u201cWell, look.  I\u2019m sure this has been a traumatic event.  Why don\u2019t you come back with us, and we\u2019ll talk about it?\u201d The second said, smiling blankly at me.  One hand dropped to his belt.\n\nNeither of them was wearing a radio.  There was nothing on his belt but a gun and a pair of handcuffs.  The details of it stuck out like a lightning flash in my mind.\n\nI took a step back.\n\n\u201cLook, don\u2019t worry, all right?\u201d the first said, beaming at me.  \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, right?\u201d\n\nThe insignia on their car was wrong.  I\u2019d lived in the town my entire life, and it was *wrong*.  It didn\u2019t even have the right *name* on it.  It just looked\u2026\n\nGeneric.\n\nI took another step back.\n\nThe smiles were beginning to fade from their faces.\n\n\u201cLook, come on,\u201d the first said.  \u201cJust take it easy, ok?  We\u2019ll just go for a ride.\u201d\n\nHis hand reached out, grabbing for my elbow.  I skittered away before he could touch me, suddenly sure of two things.\n\nWhoever those two were, they were *not* police officers.\n\nAnd I was in a mess of trouble.\n\n---\n\n(/r/inorai, critique always welcome!)\n\n~~Not against a part 2, but I'm off to bed for the night, and part 2 would come in the morning xD there is a thread [on my sub -](https://www.reddit.com/r/Inorai/comments/8tn2oh/wp_whenever_you_speak_people_hear_you_speaking_in/e18qek8) Leave a comment there and I will update you if this gets more :)~~\n\n[Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Inorai/comments/8tvvbk/silvertongue_2/)",

They'd probably both he really excited to hear a little kid speaking their language (but also really confused that he was ordering from a McDonalds in Swahili/Japanese). They'd probably come up and start chatting to the kid, and figure out that something  was up when parents could understand what the kid was saying but not speak Swahili/Japanese themselves. \nOr what if as middle schooler he was out with his friends and a person complimented him on how good his German was -- his friends would KNOW he can't speak German, plus all they heard was him speaking English. They'd laugh it off the first few times, but when it keeps happening over and over and over? They'd start to think something was up. \nOr, in high school when he's required to take a foreign language class, and he aces the class while all of his classmates just hear him talking English in class.

            "comment": "I've always had to pretend I was mute. When I was very small, as soon as I hit the milestone to talk, I had been fluent in English. I remember bits and pieces before everything changed. That day I remembered clearly, well the important bits at least. I don't remember that morning, but I remembered the afternoon. Mum and dad had been so proud of me talking, the fact that I was learning and understanding things so quickly, that was until the day their friend had come over. I remember they had a slight accent and when I talked to them, they had been surprised then grinned at me. I happily chatted away while my parents starred on in horror. After their friend left, the smiles on their faces fell instantly. There was a lot of muttered and quite angry talking in the other room. I sat, pretending to play with my toy cars, but my stomach twisted and turned. I had done something wrong, but I didn't' know what. There was a door slam and then the house was quiet. I heard shuffling as dads head poked into the room to check on me before he vanished upstairs. Dinner was silent. Mum was back and hadn't said a word, she was tight lipped and had crashed and banged in the kitchen as she cooked dinner. Dad had talked quietly to me, but kept shushing me if I talked too loud. I didn't get it. Dinner ended without incident, I ever got cake! It's weird how I remember the cake so clearly. The normal routine continued on as the sun set outside. Dad turned the TV on and plonked down into his chair and switched the channel onto BBC 2 to watch Star Trek. I sat on his knee and watched happily as the clinking of glass and cutlery echoed around the room. Then men with weird faces came onto the screen and started talking, brandishing a weapon. I held my hand up like I had one to and yelled at the top of my voice. Suddenly my mum was in the room. She ripped me from my dads lap, screaming at me, hitting me. I screamed and cried, my heart pounding in my chest. I screamed for dad but the hits kept coming. Mum screamed at me to shut up, to never do that again, pinning me to a wall, her face inches from mine. I screamed in fear, begging for dad to help, which sent her into and even bigger rage, another hit struck the side of my face and I crumbled silently to the floor, my head spinning. I heard wrestling and more screaming before the house went quiet. \n\n~*~\n\nI was locked in my room after that. That's what I remember next. I hurt, my little white t-shirt with a unicorn on the front was stained with blood from my face. My hand hurt to move. I had wrapped it in a little bandage from my little medical kit. I was hungry. No one had come into the room for ages. When mum did come in I cried and ran to her, but she didn't let me close, she hit me. As soon as my mouth opened she hit me. I shrieked and she hit me again. Screaming at me to shut up. Once I was quiet, just the occasional sniff as I hid in the corner between the wall and my bed I heard something being placed down on the ground. It had been a sandwich and a glass of water. She left, locking the door behind her. The room became my prison. Mum would flip out if she even thought I had made a sound. I eventually stopped talking to everyone, even dad. \n\nWe moved one day. Just me and mum. Dad didn't come with us. He never lay a finger on me. He would talk to me kindly when mum went out. He would sneak home in his lunch hour to see me. He talked to me, but only allowed me to whisper back, telling me he was the only person I could talk to but only if it was the two of us. I missed him. Mum moved me out after there were questions about whether I was starting school with the neighbours kids. It was just the two of us. I sat quietly, not doing much of anything every single day. She allowed me more freedom, but I was never allowed to utter a sound. She gave me books to read and I quickly devoured them. Once she was satisfied I wouldn't say a word no matter what, she took me to the doctor, who quickly signed something saying I was mute but that was it. I started school the next week. \n\n~*~\n\nI sat in class, looking out of the window dreamily. Our supply teacher hadn't arrived yet so there wasn't much of anything to do beyond chat and cause chaos. My class ignored me like they normally did. It was as if I didn't exist at this point. I'd never said a word to anyone in this room. I'd known some of these kids for seven years, if I had said anything, it would spread around the school like wildfire and mum would find out, but I did talk to random people who had no idea who I was. The cashier at McDonalds had been the last one. I really wanted some food and the only person working so early couldn't read the note I had written before I entered, so I had to talk. His eyes had opened widely and he had stepped back from me. He rambled something about a forgotten language, his language before he told me to leave and never come back. I hadn't dared go near that store again. I hadn't uttered a word since. The class went quiet suddenly, unusual for them. A man walked into the room with a presence that screamed he wasn't someone to mess with. I starred at him wide eyed. It was the man from McDonalds. I kept my head down and sunk down in my seat as he looked around the room before pulling out a sheet of paper to do the register. When he got to my name I didn't even bang on the desk like I normally would have, I just stayed quiet. My classmates quickly informed him I couldn't talk and things moved on quickly. \n\nClass was finally over, but over the sound of people packing away and sliding chairs I heard a voice boom over the class, \"mute kid, stay.\"\n\n",

            "comment": "Edit: Part Two is in the comments and further updates can be found at r/Greeneggsandspam555\n\nMy parents had been surprised, at first, when they realized I could speak Spanish to my nanny as well as I could speak English.\n\n\"She must have a gift,\" said my mom.  My Dad wasn't as pleased.  He thought I was being influenced too much by Mrs. Reyes and promptly let her go.  Since then, I had always taken it for granted that I automatically spoke to the gardener and the cashier in Spanish.  My Mom was impressed that I had retained so much from my toddler years.  We had learned not talk about it with Dad.\n\nIn high school, I decided to take Spanish as an easy elective, but I found that I couldn't even remember how to say \"How are you?\"  when I was with my teach, Mrs. Nelson.  She was tall with a severely cut white-blonde bob and seemed to hand out C's and D's gleefully.  She had learned Spanish as a missionary in Guatemala, and a part of me felt like she was saying it all wrong.  Who would have been able to catch her faking it in this town? Just about everyone was the same here: white and English speaking.  Another part of me knew that she couldn't have gotten licensed to teach Spanish if she didn't speak it, which lead to a weirder question: why couldn't I remember a single word when I was around her?\n\nThings started to get a lot weirder when I took my Spanish homework to our gardener, Carlos, for help.  He seemed puzzled when I handed him my worksheet and asked for help. \"Oh Jessie,\" he said \"It's been so long since I took Spanish I don't think I can help.\" I didn't know what to say for a few seconds.  We were *speaking* in Spanish.  Weren't we?  I knew we weren't speaking English.\n\n\"Ummm...\" I stammered \"What language are we speaking then?\"\n\nCarlos started laughing. \"How can you not know what language we're speaking? I'm from the Philippines , Jess, I speak Tagalog.  How did you learn it if you don't even know what it's called?\"\n\nThat was the questions I started asking myself over and over again. I started to stitch together a weak, but plausible answer.  Carlos had been the gardener since I was six. I must have just learned it from him. A Google search told me that the vocabulary was influenced by English and Spanish.  I must have been able to understand enough of the words to just guess the rest in the beginning and eventually I learned the rest by practicing.\n\nOur town was small and monolingual enough that I almost could have gotten through high school without realizing if it hadn't been for Selim, the Turkish exchange student.  When I automatically started speaking Turkish with him, I stopped making excuses.  There was something going on that was really weird, and if there was one thing I didn't want to be in high school, it was weird.   So I dropped out of Spanish and started avoiding Selim.  I even started coming into my house through a different door so I didn't run into Carlos in the garden.\n\nI was able to easily avoid speaking anything but English, until the Saturday my Dad took me to McDonalds.  It was a strange thing for him to do.  He rarely showed any interest in me and he openly despised fast food.  I thought we were going to just go through the drive through, but instead he parked and we walked inside.  As soon as I got inside I noticed one of the cashiers.  She looked about six feet tall, for one thing, but there was another thing about her that I couldn't quite figure out.  For some reason I just wanted to stare.\n\nWhen it came time to order my Dad ordered a double cheeseburger and an extra large soda. Another time, I would have been questioning when my dad started eating burgers or drinking soda. However, the tall girl was the one taking our order, and I was having a hard time paying attention to anything but her.  I realized both the girl and my Dad were staring at me, waiting.\n\n\"Umm.... can I get fries?\" Is what I meant to say, but what came out of my mouth was something else entirely.  It sounded more like a series of grunts and clicks than a language.\n\n\"Stop goofing around Jessica!\"  my Dad said.  \"There are people waiting.\"\n\nBut it was the girl's reaction that scared me.  Her happy how-can-I-help-you face had turned into something else entirely.  She glared at me intensely, eyebrows furrowed, lips pulled down into an angry frown.\n\n\"Can I get fries,\" I tried to whisper but the strange sounds came out of my mouth again.  I turned to my Dad, \"Can you order the fries for me,\" I said \"I need to go to the bathroom.\"\n\nHe seemed too dumbstruck to be angry, so I power-walked from the line to the restroom, where I found an open stall and sat.  What had just happened? And why had that girl been angry about it?\n\nI couldn't sit in the bathroom forever, so eventually I got up, went to the sink, and started washing my hands.  I looked in the mirror, and I realized I wasn't alone. That girl was standing in the corner staring at me.  We both stood in silence while I continued to wash my hands.  Was I supposed to break the silence? What was she doing here?\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" She finally said, in English.\n\n\"My Dad brought me,\" I said, but of course it came out in more clicks and grunts.\n\n\"Stop, please.\"\n\n\"I can't\"\n\nShe just stared for a few seconds.  I couldn't tell if she was angry or confused.\n\n\"I'm sorry I don't know what is happening, I can't control it.\" I added\n\n\"Just speak English, they have spies everywhere,\" she paused before adding,  \"unless you are a spy.\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" I interjected quickly \"I don't even know what's going on.  I've never told anyone this before, but I just speak other languages, I guess, I mean... I don't know anything about it.\"\n\n\"That's hard to believe,\" she said \"But, on the other hand. You aren't one of us.  You're too small, for one thing.  Just, please, don't come here again if you are going to speak The Language.\"\n\n\"What language? What language are we speaking?\" I asked\n\n\"If you really don't know I can't tell you. But you put both of us in danger when you speak it. Don't come back here. Get your Dad and go.\"\n\nShe left the bathroom and I went and explained to my Dad that I wasn't feeling well and needed to go home as soon as possible.  After the antics I had pulled in the line, he wasn't too happy with me, but he was happy to get me out of McDonalds. Some people had heard me and were staring.\n\nAs we got into the car I realized that I needed to go back. I needed to speak with that girl again and find out why she couldn't be heard speaking her language.  Mostly, though I wanted to figure out how I knew it, how I seemed to know every language, and how I could make it all stop.",

                    "comment": "Here is part two. I will post further updates in r/Greeneggsandspam555 \n\n\u201cAny chance we could swing by McDonald\u2019s on the way home?\u201d I asked Riley on the way back from swim practice. Riley was two years older and had a car. I was just lucky she was my best friend.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t your Dad weirdly against fast food?\u201d Riley asked\n\n\u201cYeah, my Dad\u2019s kind of a hard ass, what\u2019s new? I would kill for some French fries right now,\u201d I replied. I trusted Riley, but I wouldn\u2019t even know how to start explaining the real reason I suddenly craved McDonalds. \n\n\u201cAre you paying? No offense, but you haven\u2019t given me gas money in months and if I\u2019m taking you to McDonald\u2019s I had better get at least a Big Mac out of the deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, whatever, I\u2019ll pay you back in junk food,\u201d I responded. Riley headed out of the school parking lot and turned left. \u201cHey, when we get there can we go inside so I can grab extra ketchup packets?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Riley responded\n\nThen we turned right. I had forgotten, there was another McDonalds right by the school--of course Riley would stop there. I didn\u2019t have a good excuse to get her to go to the one that girl worked at. A part of me was relieved.  I hadn\u2019t even planned what I would do when I saw her again. Could I get her to meet in the bathroom again? Would I make a fool of myself squawking and clicking until she was forced to punch me in the face? I didn\u2019t know, but I was starting to feel desperate for some answers. \n\n\u201cOh, do you need a ride to the swim meet tomorrow?\u201d Riley asked. \n\n\u201cYeah, that would be nice. I\u2019d do anything to avoid the bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be an apple pie and a soda extra on your gas tab then.\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied. \n\nIt turns out, I never collected on that apple pie and soda. \n\nThe day of the swim meet, I had a sub in math class. He seemed impossibly large folded up in petite Ms. Harper\u2019s chair. He had written his name, Mr. Neila, on the board above his head. \n\nI had already told Ms. Harper that I had to leave class twenty minutes early for the swim meet, but now it seemed like I was going to have to tell Mr. Neila too. \n\n\u201cDid Ms. Harper tell you I needed to leave 20 minutes early for my swim meet?\u201d I asked\n\nMr. Neila just nodded his head and let out a little \u201cHarumph\u201d noise. I assumed that meant yes.\n\nFor thirty minutes, Mr. Neila just droned on about some math that seemed suspiciously unlike anything Ms. Harper had been teaching us. At one forty, I quietly put my notebook in my backpack and tried to slip out the door. \n\n\u201cJessica,\u201d Mr. Neila bellowed.\n\n\u201cSorry, I have a swim meet. Remember, I mentioned it too you?\u201d I tried to explain\n\n\u201cYou have missing assignments and your teacher told me to remind you about them,\u201d He responded.\n\nI felt the blood rush to my face. Of course, everyone in class was looking. \n\n\u201cUmm.. okay, thanks,\u201d I said still inching my way to the door. I seriously doubted that I had missing assignments, but now I just wanted to get out to Riley and away from everyone staring.\n\n\u201cShe told me you had to stay after class and complete them.\u201d\n\nNow that made no sense. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I have to get to the swim meet or everyone will leave,\u201d I protested.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compete if you aren\u2019t eligible academically.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am! Ms. Hunter signed off on that yesterday!\u201d Now I was getting frustrated.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t yell at me, I might have to call security and that would only make you later for your swim meet.\u201d\n\nFor several seconds we just stared at each other. I could feel every eye in the classroom darting back and forth between me and Mr. Neila. \n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I finally asked.\n\n\u201cFind your missing assignments in your teacher\u2019s desk,\u201d said Mr. Neila.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know which ones they are.\u201d I saw my phone light up through my backpack. Riley must be wondering where I was. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recognize them when you see them,\u201d said Mr. Neila. \n\nWhile I rummaged fruitlessly through Ms. Hunter\u2019s files, Mr. Neila and the class just watched. \n\n\u201cCan I text my ride and let them know I\u2019m running late?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo cell phones in class,\u201d Mr. Neila growled\n\n\u201cOh, here they are!\u201d I announced, grabbing two random papers.\n\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t the ones,\u201d Mr. Neila countered. \n\nFor a full ten minutes I pretended to look through papers in Ms. Hunter\u2019s desk until Mr. Neila told me I could go. I couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. Mr. Neila was making me late on purpose. Tears seeped through my eyelashes as I sprinted toward the front door. Once I got out there, Riley was gone. I whipped out my cell phone. Riley had texted me five minutes ago to let me know she had to go\u2014with me or without me. The bus had already left too. I collapsed on the ground in a daze. \n\n\u201cHey, over here!\u201d Someone was trying to get my attention from a car in the parking lot. I lifted my hand to my eyes to try and block the sun and see who this person was. They pulled up to the curb.\n\n\u201cYour friend let me know you might need a ride,\u201d said the man in the car. I let out a huge sigh of relief. \n\n\u201cThank you, thank you!\u201d I said jumping into the back seat. \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe why I was so late. I had a crazy sub, he didn\u2019t let me leave the class, it was awful.\u201d\n\nBefore I even had time to buckle my seat belt. The driver had floored the gas and was blazing out of the parking lot. \n\n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d the driver responded. He was so tall his head brushed the ceiling of the car. \n\n\u201cAre you someone\u2019s Dad or something?\u201d I asked\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d He replied\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026 whose Dad are you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m Hannah\u2019s Dad,\u201d he responded\n\nI immediately felt embarrassed. I had no idea who Hannah was. She must have been an upperclassman. There were a few girls whose names I hadn\u2019t quite gotten yet. \n\nSoon, I felt myself getting sleepy, but I felt it would be weird to make Hannah\u2019s dad wake me up when we got there, so I struggled to stay awake. I trained my eyes on the street flashing by outside the window. I started to notice something weird.\n\n\u201cUmm.. you know we\u2019re going to South High School, right? We are driving away from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, This is a short cut,\u201d Hannah\u2019s  dad said, briskly. Suddenly, the sleepiness became too much and I passed out. ",

            "comment": "I take a deep breath as I approach the counter. The cashier has his head down, but he looks pretty generic from what I can see of him. If I'm lucky, I'll sound like I'm just another guy, trying to order my share of Chicken McNuggets. \n\n\"Hi, could I have a Happy Meal, please?\" \n\nHis eyes snap to me as if magnetically attracted, and I can instantly feel the confused hostility radiate off him like heat waves. He opens his mouth to speak, closes it, and just examines me further with laser-like scrutiny.\n\nI'm pretty sure I must be gaping in return. Every last person in this establishment knows that they've replaced the chicken meat with something since the birds went extinct in the 2900's, but no-one's ever quite gone so far as to openly eye-murder me for my unhealthy eating choices. \n\nThe man at the cashier -- *Brian,* his name tag reads -- slowly lifts his apron over his head and walks straight out the back door, signalling for me to follow him. A woman quickly fills in his place, attempting to smooth the situation over, but I'm already halfway out to the parking lot.\n\nAs soon I've exited, Brian steps out from a wall, invading my personal space with absolutely no regard for it. His unusual features -- pale skin, blue eyes -- give me pause. All are traits that should technically be genetically impossible at this point. \n\n\"I don't know what you're--\" I try to say as soothingly as I can manage, but he shakes his head: a short, sharp jerk that cuts me off immediately. \n\n\"How do you know that language?\" he asks me quietly. There's something a bit off about his tone, but I can't quite place it. \n\n\"Look, dude, I have no idea -- \"\n\n\"No-one's spoken that language for thousands of years.\" He back-peddles until I can no longer smell his Filet-O-Fish breath in my face, and for a second I think he might let me leave, but he still blocks my way, looking at me strangely. \n\n\"It's just a thing I do. It's not under my control. It's another one of those implants,\" I say, pushing aside my hair to reveal the microchip embedded under my ear, where the skin is stretched tight enough to showcase its electric blue wiring.\n\nBrian's eyes have taken on a watery sheen, and I realize with a jolt that he's crying. \"I came here three years ago in a machine,\" he tells me, his voice holding up impressively. \"I don't know how or why -- just that I woke up surrounded by useless buttons and a billion people I can't begin to understand.\" He takes a step further back, and then one more, and then somewhere along the way he's walking away fully, ignoring me standing there rooted to the ground in shock. \n\nAnd then suddenly I'm not.\n\n\"Wait, Brian!\" The name sounds bizarre coming from my lips; it's almost as outdated as *Sophia* or *Britney*. \"What is the name of the language? The one I'm speaking?\" \n\nHe turns in the distance, his face etched with a bittersweet smile. \"English. It's called... English.\"\n\nAnd then he disappears from sight. ",

Two teenagers with fake eyelashes, fake nails, and fake fur coats replace their fake smiles with very real screams. A would be hero gets up and tosses a coke into the fire, of course it has no effect. Several people run for the door. You stare through the flames in front of you, although they are mere inches from your face the don't burn at all.  \n\nYou get glances of someone on the other side of the whirlwind, whose face flickers between a hideous tentacled visage and the smiling face of the cashier you ordered from a moment before.  There seems to be something moving in the middle of the blazing tornado but you can't make it out. The colors of the fire are truly beautiful, and mesmerizing. The flames die down slightly allowing you to make out a stone plinth in the center, slowly rising up out of the floor. On top are three small objects. A cylinder, which angles out from the base at an eldritch angle. A box, similar devoid of right angles. And something round, sinisterly flatter than a normal ball. The plinth rises up to eye level, the suddenly stops and the flames immediately die away. Sitting on top of a dread-inspiring stone plinth, carved with terrible runes and engravings of torture scenes, is the Coke, Fries, and Burger you asked for. The cashier wipes a stray tentacle off his face and says, \n\n\"Next time you can just order in English.\"",

He knew who I was.\n\n\"I'm so very sorry,\" I whispered softly as to not alarm anyone else. \"I can make it very quick and dignified and you will feel no pain.\"\n\nI handed the cashier my debit card to ring the charge for my meal through, but he just stood there and continued to stare at me. \n\n\"Are...are you here for me? You can't be.....your boss and I had a deal....\"\n\n\"About that deal,\" I began \"It was void the day you paid in full for him to spare your life for eternity.\" As I said the words, I could see him begin to crumble.\n\n\"But my daughters were pure,\" he choked out \"They were only two and four years old!\"\n\n\"We know,\" I said as I watched the color of life start to fade from his skin. \"They were pure, but their souls were already owned by someone else. We weren't able to collect, so I've come to collect you.\"\n\nThe cashier slumped over on the floor and I tucked my card back in my wallet as I ducked out from the crowd that was beginning to form around the body on the floor. I stepped out the door and was met by the cashier once again. As we began to walk away from the restaurant together, I allowed him to ask me one more question, \"So if the deal was that I live for eternity for two pure souls, and my deal was void, then why did he let me live for 1000 years before taking me?\"\n\nI stopped walking and turned to face him, \"You didn't fully realize what you were getting into when you made your deal with my boss. It's the goddamn fine print that says he can punish you in any way he wants if the deal falls through.\"\n\nThe wind as starting to pick up and pulled up my hood as I continued to explain, \"He likes to make it hurt as much as possible for some, so he let you live for 1000 years so that you have 1000 years of painful experiences, broken hearts, friends lost, loves lost, sickness, broken bones, failures, humiliations, and defeats to remember. And that's all you get to remember for eternity. Every good memory you had from your life has now been deleted. All you get to remember is all of the ones you've tried your hardest to forget. You will relive every one of them over and over again for eternity.\"\n\nThe cashier began to sob and I turned and kept walking because I didn't want to see the face of someone who has had all goodness stripped of them, they barely look human. \n\nI saw the remnant of the flash from behind me and I knew the cashier was gone. \n\n\"Another day done,\" I said and picked up my pace because it was getting late. \n\nI just wanted to get home and get some rest because tomorrow was another day full of appointments.",

            "comment": "The cashier in front of me froze, his eyes narrowing. I'd read books where the author described someones eyes as being calculating, but I thought I could actually see him doing math. Weighing variables, probabilities and even analyzing a threat.  \n\"Care to repeat that?\" He asked, though it was more of a command. His previous, jolly personality gone, replaced by a flat sheet of the coldest ice. It was unnerving.  \n\"I, uh, I said I'd like a number one meal. Large. Are you okay?\"  \nHe stared for a second more, then his jolliness was back, the ice melted.  \n\"Of course. Coming right up. Will that be all?\"  \n\"Uh... Yeah. That's it.\" I swiped my card and sat at the table to wait. As I ate my burger, I could feel his gaze in my back, even while he helped other customers. The burger tasted bland as I ate it as fast as possible, so I could get away from this strange man.  \nI had put it all behind me when I pulled up to my house, ready to relax. Coat abandoned on the floor for tomorrow, I sat and turned on the TV, beer in hand.  \n\"Kind of you to join me, Kaitlyn.\"  \nI jumped to my feet, spilling my beer on the couch. \"What the fuck?! Who are you? Why'd you follow me?\" He sat cross legged on the armchair, unnoticed until now.  \n\"I'm afraid I will be conducting the interrogation today. You see, you are speaking a language that's not only dead, but extinct. No one should know of it, save myself. The fact that you even know *about* would make me shudder in fear if I were capable. The implications alone make me consider if killing you now would be for the best. I offer you a rare opportunity in my line of work. A chance. How do you know how to speak English, and how did you follow me through The Gate?\"  \nMy brain had decided to call it quits, and to be fair, shock is a helluva drug. This man was talking about dead languages and gates. He put a lot of emphasis on his mention of the gate. I didn't know of any gate. I'd never even heard of English. Of course, I knew he was just hearing me speak in his native tongue, but the fact that he said no one but himself should know of it was throwing me off.  \nI must have paused too long because he sighed and began to reach for a long, steel blade. \"Wait, wait, wait! Hear me out. I have a special power. I can speak and understand any language. People always hear me in their native tongue, so that's what's happening, you're hearing me speak English. Please don't kill me.\"  \nHe took his hand off of the blade and nodded to himself. \"I see. Yes. I will not kill you.\"  \n\"Oh, God. Thank you-\"  \n\"You will be most useful.\"  \nEverything went black.",

            "comment": "How did I lose to that creep Gary? As if getting the late shift isn't bad enough, I get it for a week! It's slow today too, so why even be open? Everyone is pretty down since the manager caught the guys trying to watch the game, cutting off their little party. I'm not sure why they care so much, I mean, it's a ball that's thrown back and forth.\n\nI'm sitting in the back, bored. No one has come in for at least 30 minutes, maybe longer. So I've just been playing on my phone, seeing if I can find a way to watch my show that I'm missing. Ugh, Gary. I swear he cheated.\n\nThe door opens, so I close my phone and make my way to the counter, my feet killing me. I wouldn't be working here if the forger would hurry up with my freaking papers, but he's being a douche about it. Figures, I need to find a new one. Maybe Lance will know someone? But, I try to avoid him unless it's an emergency, pissy men who don't get enough action are not an emergency.\n\nA cute girl with blonde hair, looking at her phone like she's about to cry slowly makes her way to the counter. Her brown eyes are large and full of sorrow. I try to be understanding, girls are so emotional, but I honestly hope she doesn't just breakdown into a long drawn out story about her blah blah blah issue.\n\n\"Hi, welcome to McDonald's how may I help you?\"\n\nShe opens her mouth, lips quivering, and I brace for the worst. Sniffling, she asks, \"Can you give me a-\"\n\nI grab her hand, making her squeak, but hearing her ask me a question me in my native language freaks me out. I sit her in a booth, hand over her mouth. Heart pounding, fear I haven't felt in ages bubbles in my chest. \"Don't-\" I correct my language, changing back to English. \"Don't move.\"\n\nStanding up, I move away from the booth, able to catch her if she runs. \"Ernie, my kid sister just got beat by a douche in the next town, I'll be back.\"\n     \nMy manager pops his head around the corner. He can see something is wrong, see that there's something going on, and just nods his head. \"Sure, but if you're arrested, you're fired.\" Thank you for being consistently uncaring, it's just saved my life.\n\nGrabbing her hand, I pull her outside, throw her in my car and start the engine. \"Are you going to kill me?\" She chokes.\n\n\"Depends.\"\n \nI take her out of town, into the next county, and pull into an old diner. I know the owner, he's a witch, has known about me for years now. He'll be able to tell what she is. If this isn't an emergency, I don't know what is.\n\"I don't want to go, I don't know what I-\"\n\n\"You-\" I whisper very quietly, \"are speaking an old language, as old as time, a dead language and for good reason, and I need you to stop. The more you prattle off to me, the more dangerous it gets, got it?\"\n\nShe nods her head, and we walk in together. She's shaking, and I don't blame her, but she has no clue what he's gotten into. Lance comes out, burly man with black and pepper hair. He sees the girl, my angry face, then nods. Snapping his fingers, the place goes dark and symbols glow in the walls. She shrieks as she sees his true form, grotesque and old, a man who has beaten death. She, though, remains the same, a human. \"Why did you bring me a human?\"\n\n\"She speaks languages that she shouldn't.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see, afraid they'll find you out Gabriel?\"\n\n\"Don't use that name,\" I growl, hand balling into a fist.\n\nHis smile is dark, but it only lasts a moment. \"Alright fleshling, what do you speak?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" she says with tears in her eyes,\n\"I was born with it, I can speak other people's languages. I can't control it, I didn't mean to. I just wanted to eat my sorrows away!\" Then she breaks down, tears flowing and all. He looks at me as if to ask for help, I only shrug. \"My boyfriend cheated on my,\" she sobs, trying to breath, \"I just wanted nuggets and fries... with a shake and a large coke. I don't know what's going on, or what I spoke. I'm sorry! I don't want to die!\"\n\nThe only reason I believe her is Lance is originally a viking, from Skandinavia, and his language is dead too. Although I know his language as well, I have never conversed with Lance in it. Yet this blonde little girl has been speaking it the entire time. \n\n\"I would say she's mixed,\" he says quietly with a small hand gesture, \"maybe half angel?\"\n\n\"She would have imploded by now, humans and angels don't mix. Half fairy?\"\n\"No, she isn't pretty enough. Half jeanie?\"\n\"Possibly? But that means her luck should be better, right?\"\n\nAs we watch her continue to cry, Lance turns the lights back on. Grabbing a cup, he fills it with coke and hands it to her. \"We have a lot to discuss with you child.\"\n\n\"You're not going to kill me?\" She wipes away her tears, taking the coke from Lance.\n \n\"Nope, and if you stay and explain everything to me, I might even give you a shake.\"\n\n\"With fries?\"\n\n\"That's pushing it kid.\" She looks down, but takes a swig of her coke. \"Now tell me, who are you?\"",

I was born in Texas, then dad moved us here.\"\n\n\"No kid,\" the scary one says, the one who looked like the ghosts from Lord of the Rings only moments ago. Is this my new life? Getting kidnapped and pushed around to an old guy who looks 40 but isn't. My head hurts, the ground is slowly spinning. I can't fathomwhat just happened, or where I am. I'm so lost, who are these people? \"Who are your parents?\"\n\n\"How are you still 40? Who are you?\" He hangs his head and mutters something about \"unbelievable\", but the rest I didn't catch. The one who took me stands there and smirks. He didn't change like the other one, but there were weird shadows around him.\n\n\"Do you think you're in the position to joke?\" \n\n\"No,\" I look down, my fear coming back, \"It's how I cope.\"\n\n\"I thought eating-\"\n\n\"Listen hear,\" I look at my kidnapper's name tag, \"Tim! I am 20 years old, and if jokes and food is how I cope, then that's how I cope!\"\n\n\"Calm down kitty cat,\" the other one says, smiling at me, \"Your parents?\"\n\nI sigh, debating what I should say. Should I lie? Dad is an agent undercover currently... I can't give away his position. \"Mom died when I was born, dad is out of the picture.\"\n\n\"Names,\" the old guy says, his hand on his face, muttering again.\n\n\"You don't have to mumble about me,\" I snap, \"I still don't know why I'm here.\"\n\n\"What have you been speaking this entire time,\" Tim says, then points his finger to the other guy. That's when I pause, I hadn't noticed... \"Exaclty. You're a danger to people like us.\"\n\n\"A danger?\" His hand covers my lips again, menacing look in his eyes.\n\n\"What. Did. I. Tell. You? Lance, can you remove this curse?\"\n\nHe moves away from me, and all I can feel is rage. Curse? Excuse me? I just dumped a cheating asshat, got kidnapped because I wasted all kinds of money to shape myself the way HE wanted and for once in 3 years got fast food, and you tell me I have a curse?!\n\n\"Go screw yourself you piece of lower-class, white trash spawn! Don't you ever call my gift, a curse!\" The other guy, who I almost forgot was there, fell on the floor laughing; Tim was fuming.\n\n\"Ooh Gaberial, I like her A LOT!\" He said through tears. Gaberial? Tim shoots over the counter, faster than the Flash in the show, and before I can move towards the two, Tim is up, brushing himself off.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" Fear sunk it's teeth into my chest again, and I can barely breath. What if he does the same to me? What if he kills me too? Who are my parents? Who am I? That's what he wanted to know, because Tim isn't his real name. Oh my God, what have I done?\n\n\"No,\" he growls, \"Stop talking to me, you dumb-stricken child. Just stop.\" He looks down defeated, and all I want to do is ask questions. What if he is THE Gaberial? \"I'm not an angel, so stop looking at me in awe.\"\n\nI change my expression, not sure what to think now. The other guy, Lance I think, stood up with a hand on his jaw, and blood on his shirt. \"You'll pay for that,\" he says darkly, his expression full of hate.\n\n\"I told you to not use that name. So, where were we?\"\n\nLance looks at him one last time before taking my cup and pouring me more Coke. \"Get off of the ground and I'll give you fries if you start telling the truth.\"\n\n\"Shake still on the table?\"\n\n\"Yes, now then, talk.\"\n\nI take a deep breath, accepting the bribe. I'll avoid what my dad does, act like I hate him, hopefully that will work... \"My dad is John Hartfield, he has an office job and I don't get along with him. My mom,\" I feel my throat get hot, before I look down, \"she was lovely. Her name was Lela Morgan.\"\n\n\"Morgan? Do you know her family?\" Lance asks with some interest. \n\n\"No. That's all I know.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for your loss,\" Tim said. He looks genuinely sad, but I can't focus on him. However good looking he his...\n\n\"Well kid,\" Lance says, a small smile creeping to his face, \"Have you ever heard of sirens?\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nHe giggles, slapping his knee and pointing at Tim, \"Half siren, they rarely make it past birth because people are scared of them. Incredibly dangerous. Also, if they give birth, they usually die because of their nature; they need water.\"\n\n\"Umm, hello? What in the hell do you mean 'siren'? Like, Greek myths sirens? Eating people, sucks you in with song sirens?\"\n\n\"How narrow minded,\" Tim says, shaking his head.\n\n\"She's part human, what did you expect? Welp kid, they speak all languages, are beautiful, quick to anger, and love the water. You miss the water, right?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I live in Arizona.\"\n\n\"No, you crave it,\" Lance says, and I can't help but feel as if he is reading my soul. \"If you go into the ocean, you would never come back. In fact, it lulls you, pulls you in. Not far from a mermaid; a siren. That's what you are.\"\n\n\"Wait, like a mermaid?\"\n\n\"Umm... not really,\" Lance says, unsure why my attitude changed. \"As in a siren. Where you suck in sailors.\"\n\n\"But, I would be able to swim, and explore the ocean, and escape jackass people?\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\"Sweet! Let's go!\"\n\n\"Excue me?\" Tim said, looking at me with a lost expression. \n\n\"Well, if you two are right, isn't it best that I'm with experts?\"\n\n\"She has a point,\" Lance said, \"and a beach day would be nice.\"\n\n\"No.\" \"Oh, come on man, how long has it been? 20 years?\" \"40, and Posiedon holds grudges.\" \"You may see a mermaid, they love you.\" \"Shut it Lance.\" \"We'll go with you.\"\n\n\"Really?!

I was taken aback.\n\nI learnt about my gift from a very early age; surprisingly enough I never faced any suspicion. \u201cYou\u2019re a polyglot, Sammy\u201d, said my uncle wryly. But he never questioned how I came to be one. And it may sound surprising but I never felt bothered to question it much. I had much fun in college, talking to many international students, learnt so much from them. To tell the truth, it has been my opinion \u2013 deep down in my heart \u2013 that I am special and gifted, and I took this as granted. Many people are born with so many innate abilities, this is mine and I am proud of it.\n \nI looked at him closely; he is young, barely in his twenties. His thin pale face becoming thinner by the minute. He is scrutinizing me too, what is he seeing in me? I wonder what conclusion he is arriving at in his mind.\n\nI tried to smile at him. I thought of telling him that I am a linguist, I learnt it in a course in college, which is a lie of course. But I understood it is not a lighthearted situation. The young man standing before me looks too upset.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s spoken that language in thousands of years\u201d, he said slowly, almost as if to himself. I heard pain in his voice, evoking in me some unknown, unnameable memory of things in me, of occurrences which never happened to me, but I could feel \u2013 in my heart of hearts \u2013 that these things happened, somewhere, sometime \u2013 in this very world. \n\nHis lips are trembling now, he is in the verge of tears. He is one of the bearers of the knowledge, belonging to a small set of survivors, who fled and evaded from enemies, carrying what part of their identity that they could \u2013 their culture and their language. A handful of texts which survived at a great cost, taught to the young ones with a warning of never speaking it in the outside world. The memory is still there, of persecution, of being hunted like animals. Eons have passed, but the fear remains, so does the pain. \n\nAll these I came to know, standing there, staring at each other. A shared past, of mutual destruction, humanity\u2019s worst crimes, history not recorded. But it did not get erased, I came to know it never will be erased.\n \nI came out of the McDonalds, under the glaring sun.\n",

            "comment": "**PART 1:**\nMy father had always been a bit of an enigma. We had little in common save for our names. He was a mild-mannered and proper Englishman who had immigrated to America from a little village the West Country. He believed with all his being in the power of an orderly queue and a proper cup of tea. But every so often when he had a few pints in him, he would wibble on about strange adventures and heroic deeds in impossible places with fanciful characters. Talking mice, a 2-headed man, poetry so awful it could kill the listener - my best friend Douglas and I teased him that he should write a book or five about it all. But we never believed a word of his tall tales. Not until the end. \n\nI was 25 when he died. It was March 11, 1977. Dad hadn't spoken in days. Doctors said his mind was gone, and his body would soon follow. As he lay gasping his final breaths, something small and yellow wriggled wetly out of his ear. It looked almost like a fish. I leant in for a closer look. For just a moment, my father became lucid again. He grasped my head in his hands. \"Artie, my boy,\" he croaked, \"Always know... where your... towel is...\" With one last gasp, he struck me on my ear with a surprising amount of strength. Then he slipped away and was gone. So was the fish. But from that moment on, I had the ability to speak and understand all language. Every word I ever heard or read translated itself in my mind. And every word I spoke arrived at the listener's ear in their native tongue.\n\n**PART 2:**\nI sat in the cool air conditioning of the fast food restaurant, gazing out at one of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World. It was a stark dichotomy. I had spent my entire adult life traveling all around the globe, and yet I still found it surprising to watch the modern world creep into the most ancient of sites. I found myself pondering what might have stood on this site way back when the Great Pyramid of Giza had first gone up. Thousands of years ago, a man such as myself may have eaten his meal in this same spot, awed by the view of these same pyramids. The thought made me smile. As my mind trailed off along that thought, I was interrupted by a young man bringing a tray full of enough fat, salt and refined sugar to quell my growing homesickness for a little while. Still lost in my thoughts of ancient times, I reached for my soda before he had finished setting down the tray, and a little spilled. \n\nThe young man apologized profusely. His words came to me in modern English, though I knew he was speaking in his native tongue.  \"Don't worry, my friend!\" I assured the young man as he hurriedly mopped up the spill. \"I wasn't looking. It's my fault.\" He froze. His dark eyes went wide with - was it shock? Confusion? Fear? Occasionally hearing one's mother tongue appear to come so naturally from American lips seems too implausible. Occasionally I startle people. \"I'll finish cleaning up,\" I offered cheerfully, hoping he would relax. But the words had the opposite effect. They merely confirmed to his disbelieving ears that he had, in fact, heard what it should be impossible to hear. His wide eyes remained locked on the great pyramid glowing in the hot sun on the other side of the glass as he shook his head and stammered, \"Khnum protect me! No one but a child of Hemiunu has spoken His sacred tongue in over 4000 years!\"\n\n**PART 3:**\nI used my ability to travel all around the world, learning and exploring. My gift granted me access to the most incredible locations. I had been invited to come to Egypt to decode strange writing found in a newly discovered chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza. A couple years ago, muography scans detected a hidden chamber above Khnum Khufu\u2019s tomb. At last, tiny robots had carefully drilled through a small shaft and into the mysterious big void. Cameras fed into the opening revealed writing in a language that no one had ever seen before, or so they told me. I could never tell the difference - it was all English to me! \n\nArchaeologists had dubbed the void \u201cHemiunu's Gallery\u201d after the architect who directed the construction of the pyramid. And now in front of me was a young man who was apparently a descendant of Hemiunu himself. I was developing a sneaking suspicion the chamber was somehow connected to this young man, whose eyes were still locked upon the pyramid. \"It's time,\" he said suddenly. He tore his eyes from the pyramid and turned to face me as crumpled into the chair across from mine. \n\n**PART 4:**\nI had only had my gift a few years when \u201cIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\u201d came out. But from that day forward, archaeology held a special place in my heart. And now here I was, about to helping explore the first new chamber to have been discovered in the pyramid since the middle ages. I was so excited, my heart was beating as fast as the Kali Ma human sacrifice in \u201cTemple of Doom.\u201d I glanced at Buneb, the young man from the restaurant. I had managed to get him hired on as my assistant. Being a septuagenarian, no one questioned my request for a young strong man to lean on across the sand and rocks. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d Buneb smiled weakly. I was somewhat worried that he would honor this sacred ground with an offering of vomit. \n\nWe gathered beneath the large white canopy pitched at the foot of the pyramid. Technicians had set up a myriad of video equipment. Buena and I were led to a seat by a large screen. \u201cWe have gotten more lighting in there now,\u201d said one of the technicians. \u201cAnd our high-res camera has nearly reached the gallery. You\u2019ll be able to see the writing in just a moment.\u201d  She switched on the screen and hurried off to finish preparations. \u201cCome on, Phouchg. It\u2019s time,\u201d said a small high voice.  \u201cIt had better work this time, Loonquawl,\u201d said another equally squeaky voice. My powers of language had never extended to the animal kingdom, but no one was nearby except Buneb, who was intently watching two small white mice scurry up the pyramid.\n\n**PART 5:**\nBuneb had spent his whole young life watching the Great Pyramid, as had his father before him, and his father\u2019s father, and so on back through the millennia. He was a direct descendant of Hemiunu, he had said. According to his ancestors, the pyramid held some sort of mystical secret of the universe. And when the universe was ready, the descendants of Hemiunu must be on hand to ensure the secret was understood. Apparently Hemiunu realized the universe wouldn\u2019t be ready for quite some time, and also knew that a multi-millennial game of telephone might result in the secret becoming distorted. He tasked his offspring with ensuring the language was kept alive and intact. \n\nThe screen flickered and suddenly it was filled with images. \u201cHead all the way to your right,\u201d I told the technician. \u201cNow up\u2026 Yes, there -by the drawing of the \u2026  white mouse\u2026. That is the beginning. Now head straight down. It is written in columns.\u201d  Very slowly, words began to take form. I scribbled in my little notepad while Buneb muttered softly to himself. As the camera finally finished its journey around the room, I stared back at what I had written. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an answer, it is a question!\u201d exclaimed Buneb. He was right. There in my notebook, scrawled in my shaky handwriting, was the ultimate question. The question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. ",

            "comment": "Note: I didn't like the McDonald's thing, so I ignored that.\n_____________\n\nI grew up in the 'burbs. \n\nIf you grow up white, you don't really notice how much people keep to themselves. It's just no big deal to not talk much to your neighbors, and no issue at all if your neighbors leave you alone.\n\nWhite people just don't notice when our not-white neighbors don't interact with us.\n\nI mean, it's different in the city, where you can't avoid interacting with people from vastly different backgrounds. There's only so much space, and there are so many people. And it's different in a small town where your options are to know everyone or be 'that weirdo who should fuck off out of town.'\n\nBut in the suburbs? There's too many people to act like a racist jerk, but not enough to actually force interaction with people unlike yourself.\n\n So yeah, I grew up with hispanic neighbors, but I never talked to them. We even had a family from somewhere in Africa move into the apartment underneath ours, but again, we never spoke. \n\nAll the kids who spoke Spanish as their primary language had a clique of their own in school, and the few kids who even noticed were either arrogantly anti-immigrant, either glad to not have to interact, or being assholes about how there should be laws against not speaking English in public, or they were naive enough to think that those kids hung out because they just wanted to, and not because they just wanted to be able to speak in the language they were most comfortable with. \n\nIt never even crossed my mind, then. Obviously, I have thought about it a lot since then. It took me awhile to figure out how I made it so far without figuring it out... but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nMy first clue came in 9th grade, Spanish class. Our regular teacher was a delightful old woman who probably should have been a nun (the type who feed the homeless, not the type who beat kids with rulers), but had gone to uni in Spain to become a teacher instead.\n\nI did pretty well in class. Better than most of my classmates, but not by that much. I had the same result with math and English, so it wasn't really anything surprising.\n\nThen we had a substitute teacher who was born and raised in Venezuela. I didn't talk much in class, usually, but I must've asked a question or something, because he pulled me aside after class to berate me for taking a class on a language I am obviously fluent in, and for lying to my regular teacher about it. I was confused. I had a good grade, and I understood the material because I studied, but I was far from fluent.\n\nMy regular teacher talked yo me about it the next day, but we both brushed it off. I was obviously not fluent, and neither of us could figure out how the sub came to that conclusion. \n\nI should have thought about it more, but I was a dumb kid. I forgot about it almost completely, until I got my first job. \n\nA lot of kids I knew worked after school jobs, but my parents worried that it would negatively impact my grades, so they wouldn't let me get a job until the month before I graduated. I wasn't planning on going to college right away, and I couldn't really fuck up my grades at that point.\n\nIt was a regular fast food gig that kids that age tend to get. Turnover was pretty high, mostly because it's a shit-level job with shit pay. I worked there for a few months with no problems. \n\nThen came Ana. She trained on a different shift, so I didn't meet her til she'd been working for a few weeks. We were introduced with a 'hey, this is the new girl, help her not screw up.' \n\nWe were the only two people on a slow shift, so of course, we started talking. I'd heard she was pretty quiet, and didn't talk much, but to my surprise, she was pretty chatty.\n\nWe mostly talked about the usual. School, work, tv shows. It was a pretty good shift, until the end of it. \n\nSome jackass came in, ordered food, and yelled on his way out the door. \"Hey, this is America. Speak English or go back ti Mexico!\"\n\nI just stood there kindof stunned. I had no idea why anyone would say something like that to *anyone*, but especially to us. Yeah, we were talking, but we were speaking English, right?\n\n\"I hate assholes like that. Like I don't belong here just because I wasn't born here. Like speaking any language other than English is a crime. ... Where did you learn Portuguese, anyway?\"\n________\n\nI have plans for this one, but I'm leaving it here, because typing it on my phone sucks.",

            "comment": "The man behind the counter froze in the middle of typing out my order. They looked up at me wide eyed and said,\"Nobody's spoken that language in thousands of years.\" Sounding somewhat surprised.\nThat night, standing in the empty 24/7 McDonald's of our small desert town, it finally happened. The thing that I had been waiting for for my entire life, and had a feeling would happen eventually.\n\"Shit. You're an alien?\" I said more worried about making a good impression than running away. \nThey responded with a look of 'are you kidding me' before dryly stating \"what else would I be?\" and they quickly regained their compsure.\nI was struggling to hold back my enthusiasm. \nThey did not seem as amused by the encounter and they were actually starting to get concerned. \"Uh... Is everything alright there? You look like you are about to piss yourself.\" They went back to typing.\nMy mind ran at a thousand miles an hour, as the cashiers words flew over my head. \n\"Oh my God! Is the name on your tag your real name? How'd you get here? Wait how long have you lived here? I mean in this town not just, you know, on the planet. \" This went on for about half an hour. It stopped when the cashier stuffed a burger in my mouth while I was lost in the nervice tidal wave.\nThey said a single word \" Eat.\" and that was that.\nI sat down at a table and began to nibble away at my fries. The cashier disappeared around a corner for a minute or so before returning to sit across from me. The taste of food suddenly reminded me that I had forgotten to have lunch and dinner that day, due to getting cought up in fixing my car's engine.\nHe sat down with the chair facing backwards to so he could lean forward with out touching the sticky table. He said \"I don't know what the deal is with you, but I am going to have to ask where you learned to speak like that. Because you are obviously just one very confusing human being.\"\nWhile going to town on the burger I said \"don't know. I was sort of born with this weird super power to communicate really fucking well. Almost like mind reading but without the mind reading. I honestly don't know what language I am speaking in most of the time unless somebody either tells me or they say something very specific to that tounge.\" I stop to drink a sip of soda. The cashier, whom I just then noticed had 'Stanly' on his name tag, showed a visable confusion drawn on to his face like a sudden migraine. He muttered something. He muttered 'God damn it, Jax I told you not to go sleeping around.' I think. Muttering isn't an exact language. Stanly sighed and asked \"would there by any chance be a rumour in your family that somebody anybody met an alien?\"\nI finnished off my burger not fully grasping the situation, \"Not that I know of. Why?\"\nStanly mumbled to himself again and said \" I don't have any easier way to break the news to you, kid. Someone in your family line has... engaged in some cross breeding.\"\nI choked on my drink, \"what?!\"\nStanly continued \"Your powers are a knockoff version of my races abilities to process information.\"\n\"I just thought I had autism.\"\nI guess this was not Stanly's best night. He paused to figure out what to say next. \nHe then hesitantly said \" I wouldn't... rule that out entirely. The weight of this really doesn't seem to be, um... Regestaring correctly.\"\nI gave an understanding nod an said \"Ya, that tends to happen a lot. I'm getting better though.\" (I only realised two days later that I had been drinking my soda very obnoxiously. )\nI drank some more of my sprite.\nStanly tried to get back on track. He said \"Right... How would you like to meet your something far back grandfather?\"\n",

            "comment": "I was mid-yawn when I realized that the cashier had stiffened as I asked for my coffee. His already vacant gaze glazed over even more, making me wonder if my simple request had been too much for the poor kid.\n\nHe blinked slowly and looked at me. \"I'm sorry, what?\" His speech was slurred, almost like his mouth was full. His vacant gaze just passed over me, like he was looking for something.\n\n\"Uh, yeah. Can I get a coffee? Two sugars.\" \n\nI was growing concerned. McDonald's isn't known for hiring the best, and I was certain I just broke one of their employees. I watched as the youth practically snapped to attention and moved with military stiffness to the cups, grabbing one and filling it with one watchful eye measuring the amount before coming back to the counter, setting it down firmly in front of me. He looked at the cup and then to me, expectantly.\n\n\"Thanks. Could I get a couple of sugars and a lid, please?\" \n\nDear God, this kid wasn't playing with a full set of marbles. He turned on heel and grabbed two sugars, counting them out like a bank teller counting money back to a customer, before tearing them open and pouring them into the cup. Everything was so robotic all of a sudden. He grabbed the lid and pressed it all around, sealing the cup before grabbing it with both hands and raising it to his lips. I watched in horror as he sipped my coffee before setting it down.\n\n\"What the hell, man?!\" I was pissed.\n\n\"I'm testing for poison.\" His response was simple, and so utterly ridiculous that I wasn't sure I heard him right.\n\n\"Poison?! Dude, I just wanted a coffee. What are you trying to pull?\" I was starting to attract some attention, but didn't really care.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my liege. I will make you another cup.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I said I will make you another cup of coffee, sir.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Don't worry about it. I'll go somewhere else.\"\n\nI've never seen someone look so horrified, dejected, and sorrowful so quickly. He began to tear up, his face wracked with emotion, even as his gaze remained vacant. I took a step back as he moved with precise steps from behind the counter, approaching me, falling to his knees and prostrating himself.\n\n\"Please, sir! Forgive me! Let me make you another cup! I beg of you,\" he cried.\n\n\"Dude! Get up! Jesus Christ. No, don't worry about it.\" I was backing up and looking for the door as he started to rise, tears streaking down his face. He hesitantly took a step toward me, one hand reaching out.\n\n\"Leave me alone!\" I screamed. The dining room was deathly silent, people frozen in place watching a full grown man backing away from an acne riddled child.\n\n\"Of course, sir.\" He snapped back to attention and went back behind the counter, as though nothing had happened. Someone chuckled nervously. I looked around, suddenly embarrassed, my face flushed and my heart pounding as I turned and bolted for the door. I fumbled my car keys digging them from my pocket, cursing as I dropped them. I heard a small gasp and saw a mother covering her child's ears. Raising my hand in an apology, I scooped up my keys.\n\n\"Sorry, sorry. Rough start to the day. Have a good one.\"\n\nThe reaction was instant. The mother's eyes glazed over. She nodded slowly, hands still clasped over her daughter's ears. The look on her face reminded me so forcibly of the cashier's that I involuntarily shuddered and looked back inside to see him talking with his manager, his tear-stained face wrapped in confusion. I looked back to the mother and then ran to my car.\n\nI've never had a problem talking with people. It's a knack, I suppose. A freak of nature. My brain thinks English, my tongue spits out English, and somewhere after the fact, there's a little twist in the air that delivers in some other language in their ears. Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, even Eskimo, it doesn't matter. I can speak any language without intention, full fluency and no trace of my heritage. I ended up starting to carry a police grade wire on myself to record my languages. Thus far, I'm up to 127 different languages, not including the specific dialects therein.\n\nIt'd be better if it worked both ways; people get huffy when they start talking to me in rapid-fire Italian only for me to raise my hands in supplication and say, in perfect Italian, that I don't speak Italian.\n\nI shook off the rough start and headed to work. I found myself a job working in construction management, designing custom homes. Perfectly safe, not a lot of talking needed since all my work just went to another department, and I could just bury myself into drawings.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Robertson!\" Ashley was always so chipper in the mornings. I nodded my greeting to her and smiled slightly, slipping back to my office. Firing up my computer, I sat down and sighed heavily.\n\n\"Mr. Robertson?\" I looked up. Ashley was standing in the doorway, looking hesitantly around my office.\n\n\"Yeah, what's up, Ashley?\"\n\n\"Is everything okay? Is there anything you need?\"\n\n\"Yeah, just a rough start to the day. I would kill for a cup of coffee, really.\"\n\nAshley snapped to attention, her vibrant blue eyes glazed over. I shuddered. She marched off military style. I could hear her heels clacking down the hallway. Almost as soon as she left, she returned, bearing a hot cup of coffee. She clutched it in both hands, looked me dead in the eyes with her vacant gaze, and raised the cup to her lips, sipping deeply before setting it down on my desk.\n\n\"What the FUCK, Ashley?!\" I was incensed. She blinked slowly.\n\n\"I was testing for poison.\"\n\nI stopped short. \"What did you just say?\"\n\n\"I was testing for poison, my liege.\"\n\nI blinked. Laughed a bit. \"Ashley, did someone put you up to this? am I being pranked right now?\"\n\n\"Of course not, sir. I take your health very seriously.\" Something was wrong. The perkiness was gone from her voice. It was flat, as though she was just responding automatically.\n\n\"Ashley, you're starting to worry me. Knock it off, please.\" I pleaded.\n\nShe turned, slowly, leaving the lipstick stained coffee cup on my desk and left my office, closing the door firmly behind her. I held my breath until I heard her heels clacking back towards her desk.\n\nI pushed the coffee aside and turned to my computer. There was only one thing I could do, a trick I learned with the advent of the Internet. It's not just when I talk that the conversion occurs; any medium I communicate in is translated. With online translators all over the place, I found that all I had to do was play back my speech from my recording, and learn what language I was speaking in.\n\nI plugged my recorder in and played back the last 15 minutes. Ashley's chipper hello, the shuffling in my office, her inquiry to my day and then, as I was used to hearing, nonsense. Some non-English language. I've gotten pretty used to figuring out the roots of some languages; roots in latin, non-latin, and so on. I didn't recognize this one. I fired up the speech to text translator and played my voice back. The translator sputtered and cycled, my computer's fan kicked up a few notches and I could imagine it chugging along as it worked through all the languages in its repertoire.\n\nI waited almost ten minutes for the program to chime it's findings. A single line. I didn't believe it. I stared blankly at the screen, trying to process what I was looking at when my phone rang, snapping me out of my blank stare. I snatched the receiver.\n\n\"Robertson, Holmes Custom Designs. How can I help you?\"\n\n\"Yes. Hello, Mr. Robertson. I have been looking for you for a long time.\" The voice was musical, androgynous.

I designed it to specifically single out a significant language and notify me when there was a hit. You flagged it.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" I stammered.\n\n\"Don't worry, Mr. Robertson. I'm here to help you. A piece of advice though; don't ask anyone to do anything for you. You'll find that they'll be a lot more helpful than you expected.\"\n\nThe musical notes continued on, picking up pace, almost as though they were excited.\n\n\"I'm coming down to your office.

In the moments that followed, silence took over the room as neither of us said or did anything. I had counted to 69 Mississippi's in my head when Jefe - that was his name, according to the name tag I noticed and read after Mississippi 42 - suddenly jumped over the register onto the customer side. Before I could react, he started running for the door.\n\n\"Hey, wait!\" I yelled after him, but he did not listen. Jefe burst through the glass door and out into the street, seemingly unaffected by the flurry of broken glass and metal that his body had encountered. \n\nI turned back to the register and an older, Hispanic man in McDonald's kitchenware emerged from the kitchen. \"Hey,\" I started nervously, checking his apron for a name tag. It was on his lower left abdomen area, and it read Jeff. \"Jeff, I ordered two large fries and a fountain drink.\"\n\n\"*Eey*! You speak fantastic Portuguese, my friend!\" Jeff whispered, smiling. \"Your order is ready, I was just about to bring it out when I heard some noise.\" He turned and walked back towards the kitchen, but stopped abruptly in front of the doorway. \"Wait a second, how did you know I come from Portugal?\" he said, his upbeat tone quickly fading. \"And where is the boy, Jefe?\" \n\n\"Oh yeah, Jefe said something really weird and -\" A loud screech and thud interrupted my sentence. I turned and dashed over to a window beside the destroyed entrance to see what caused the noise. An old, beat up looking Jeep was  stopped haphazardly across the middle of road. Its windshield was covered in blood and shattered through the upper right corner. My eyes scanned the parking lot and I gasped, quite audibly, when I saw what the Jeep had hit. \n\nJefe's body lay a few yards in front of the Jeep, crumpled up like a bloody pretzel. I stood by the window dazed as Jeff ran out of the store screaming. *What the flippity fuck?* My mind was blank and seemed to be preparing to produce its first thoughts to react when a bright light made me blink and squint. The light was followed by a deafening bang and a shock wave that made me back up a few steps. Just like that, the Jeep had exploded. \n\nBits of metal and rubber flew into the store through the shattered windows as what was just a few seconds ago a Jeep became a smoldering pile of metal. *What did Jefe mean by thousands of years? Why did this Jeep explode? Where did Jeff go?* These questions raced through my mind. I carefully climbed over the rubble surrounding the entrance and looked around. Suddenly, another blinding light made me look away. *Another explosion?!* I thought incredulously. I was right. \n\nJefe had exploded. ",

Well, I got the shock of my life there. Let me tell you what happened.\n\nI walked into the building (which was called *The High-Ruled Kingdom*, for whatever reason), and ordered my food.\n\nThe cashier looked up at me in a mixed variety of emotions.\n\nFear, surprise, shock, was that anger?\n\n\"No one's spoke that language in thousands of years.\"\n\nI stared back at the man, confused. \n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nThe man took a lok over his shoulder, excused himself from his work station, then motioned for me to join him at a tale. I did, and then he began talking about verrryy strange things.\n\nThe man, who revealed himself to be a son of the current owner of *Forester Brewery*, said that the language I had spoken was only spoken by those from his homeworld. \n\n\"Homeworld? Are you high or something?\"\n\n\"No. I assure you that I have not taken any kind of mind altering drinks or food items, thank you very much.\"\n\nFor some reason, the man told his co-workers that he would be going home early and left the building. I followed.\n\nI found the guy sitting on a very strange bike, it appaered to be made out of wood.\n\n\"Where'd you get this from?\"\n\n\"Been in the family for years. my father wants to talk to you, now that the secret's out, no point in keeping you wondering.\"\n\nWait. This guy that I just met was telling me to go home with him? Was he insane?\n\n\"Look, if you think I'm getting on that bike with you...\"\n\n\"Oh, you don;'t have to, you can just walk, if you like.\"\n\nI ended up choosing the bike, against my better judgement. And let me tell you, I did *not* expect the guy to live in a freaking huge mansion.\n\nWhile I was walking up the drive way, I wondered what this guy's father wanted with me, and what about this 'family secret'?\n\n(Want to see more? Just ask.)\n\n",

            "comment": "I drink too much. Half of everybody knows that, the other half never seem to notice. I don't really get it.\n\nWhen I was a child, I had a speech impediment as a result of the shape of my mouth. My palette was overly arched, and my upper molars were too close together. I also had an overbite. It took years of speech therapy and orthodontia before I could even muster up the courage to speak to a teacher to answer a question, let alone any of my fellow students. I was the quiet nerd in the corner, and got beat up a lot by bullies on the playground. It seemed a miracle when after the Torquemadean hardware was removed and the therapy was done that I realized I could finally speak with clear voice and meaning to anybody I wanted. A new world opened up.\n\nIt was around age 16 that I finally came out of my shell. Somehow, despite my low GPA I was assigned to the debate squad at my high-school. I definitely had not signed up for it. I was told that the course I had signed up for had too few students so they had to stick me somewhere. What a blessing that accident was, I could say whatever I wanted as long as it was designed to win the round, and win we did, my partner and I. Communication became my gift. During rounds it seemed as if I could reach directly into the souls of anybody in the room. Our opponents couldn't wriggle their way out of my questions during cross-examination, and sometimes judges openly wept as I spun story after story about how following the opposition plan would result in multiple Columbine Massacres, nuclear Winters, and the loss of arts and music worldwide. There was no doubt about it, I had the Gift of Gab. From local tournaments near my hometown in the inland northwest, to regional competitions, to nationals three years in a row, we just won. Luckily the forensics work made it so I didn't have to do any international language classes. It didn't seem likely I would ever leave the tree farm, let alone the country. Besides, dad was never pleased with the idea that the state decided all high-school students had to learn \"foreignian\" anyhow. It saved a lot of hassle.\n\nOf course in my senior year Patrick had to dare me.\n\n\"Do it drunk.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Do it drunk, see if you can lose.\"\n\nI couldn't, but I did learn I loved drinking.\n\nI won loads of scholarships and was able to go to the college of my choice, one which was outside my wildest dreams in my previous withdrawn and introverted life. It was a noted party school.\n\nSo I went, and I studied, and I partied, and I visited to a lot of bars, and I talked a lot of bullshit with my fellow students and told a lot of jokes. These were raucous times. Somehow never got in a fight, never got tossed for being too toasted, and never got in trouble with the small-town police as I staggered home. And the girls. Oh the girls. And some of the boys too. It always felt like we were so connected, and then we were, save the latex barrier. Life was great!\n\nThe problem with collegiate debate is that one spends a lot of time on the road, and one eats too much fast food as a result. One snowy Thursday night/Friday morning on the way to Eugene, the bus pulled into the lot of a small town McDonald's under a flickering red-neon sign which occasionally read \"24 hours\". We trudged across the lot, looking like derelicts in our travel sweats and jammies and our tousled hair from long hours on the road. It likely didn't help that I was three quarters of a fifth of cheap vodka in by then.\n\nThe bright fluorescent lights were blinding, and the beeping of the fryer exclaiming the burgers were overdone were doing my head in, I almost bagged it and went back to the motor-coach. Alas, it couldn't not happen. I had to finally notice her as I was turning to leave. Cliche after hackneyed cliche ran through my being as I looked for ways to describe how she looked, how I felt about how she looked, and the way she looked at me. All I could do was wait my turn to order so I could at least say \"Hi!\" to S\u03acr\u0259, as her name-tag weirdly read.\n\n\"May I have a six piece nugget mea...\"  She lunged over the counter, I'm not sure where the knife came from, or why it glowed like that. I am sure I heard her say \"Nobody's spoken that language in thousands of years...or, rather, will!\"\n\nAnd then I woke up here, in this room, with you asking me how I came to be here.\n\nI want three things. A drink, my insulin, and to talk to my mom, she must be worried.  ",

That's my other go-to. I was about to apologize for it when I realized: she's catatonic. Her eyes fixed on nothing a couple inches over my left shoulder\u2014I don't think she was even breathing.\n\n\"Dude, what did you *say* to her?\"\n\nI swung around. The guy behind me was about 6'2\" and thin, with short, dark hair, and he was wearing a suit with some sort of conference nametag that said \"Charles Anderson.\" I pored over it for what, at least to me, was just a couple seconds. It also said **2018 / \"BE COURAGEOUS!\"** I wish I was making this stuff up.\n\n\"What did you *say*?\"\n\nIt wasn't Charles. Charles was looking squarely above the whole debacle, hand on his chin, eyes hopping between what were probably the \"**2: Quarter Pounder**^(\u00ae) with cheese\" and the \"**3: Double Quarter Pounder**^(\u00ae) with cheese.\" *Thank God for Charles,* I thought. If everyone in the world were like Charles, it would be so much better for me. I could just go about my day unnoticed, even with this new...quirk.\n\n\"What did you *fucking* say to that lady?\"\n\nIt was the guy behind Charles. He had dreads and what looked like alpaca wool covered in Chotchkie's flair. But his physique was decidedly more juicer than deadhead, and he was glaring at me so hard his face seemed to be turning red.\n\n\"I...uh...Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad, Apple Slices, and water....Please.\"\n\nI wasn't lying. I *had* said that. *I* had said that. And what she heard, too, was almost undoubtedly that, just in another language. And I'm sure she understood it as that, unless she's rusty in her mother tongue\u2014I guess it's been a while, after all.\n\n\"Oh yeah? It didn't sound like that to me. It sounded more like 'Sow'll whisper pepequem nose googah' something or other. And I mean\u2014look at her! What did she say back?\"\n\nI briefly looked back at the cashier. There she was, still staring at nothing, still still. At least I could detect what seemed to be a little bit of breathing now.\n\n\"She said, um...\" *Do I tell him the truth? It might be bizarre enough to throw him off his game...*\n\nCharlie helped me out. \"I'm pretty sure I heard her. She said 'Nobody's going to have anguish in the thousand years.'\" He smiled, nodded once, and bizarrely, as if this sort of thing happened to him every day, turned back to studying the menu.\n\nThe Merry Roider seemed to be thrown off his game. He unclenched his face, and it started turning back to that peach tone he clearly wished he didn't have. \"Is that, uh, is that really what she said?\"\n\n\"Um, yup.\" I nodded a few times, briskly, while staring off to the right. *Convincing performance.*\n\n\"Well, what the hell does *that* mean?\"\n\nBeef Slackinoff sure was nosey for just some guy standing in line at McDonald's. \"It, uh, it means...\"\n\nChuck chimed in. \"I'm glad you asked!\" He proceeded to begin to explain...something...to Navy Gravy, while I took the opportunity to extract myself from the conversation and bridge the two-foot gap between myself and the counter.\n\nOur cashier starting coming to. \"Where...uhh...where did you learn that? How did you know I spoke it?\"\n\n*Shit.* I had no alibi. I didn't even know what I was supposed to have an alibi *for.* \"Uh, y'know, you pick up a few things here and there...\"\n\n\"In *Proto-Indo-European?*\"\n\nSo *that's* what it was! How the hell was it her native tongue, though?\n\n\"Um, yeah, you know, just hanging out with other kids when I was little and, um, I mean, reading books, not hanging out\u2014\" I was really good at this.\n\n\"So do you, like, just go up to everyone and do this? Is that, like, your shtick? How often do you get beat up for it?\"\n\n\"Well, *actually*\"\u2014my first good idea of the day just popped into my head\u2014\"I usually try to make an educated guess first as to what someone speaks. And I do have a pretty good batting average.\" I nodded knowingly, as though I had just securely built the roof of a house of cards.\n\n\"Quosm\u043e\u0304d pewgwonts 'mene gne\u0295ws?\"\n\n*Fuck.* I just realized that despite all this conversation, she\u2014and apparently everyone else around\u2014still heard me speaking in this language I'd never even heard of. She was just starting to respond in it, and I had no fucking clue what she was saying.\n\nI stared blankly and blinked for a few seconds. \"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"But how the fuck did you know for me?\"\n\nI had to think fast, as if a windstorm were about to arrive at card village and I was its only retrofitter. \"Oh, well, uh, you know...\"\n\nI noticed she was wearing a McDonald's tag with her name, Lydia Szemerenyi, on it. I pointed to it. \"It was that.\" The bullshit was flowing so freely out of my mouth that I started to fear for the sanitation of this joint.\n\nShe looked down and nodded knowingly, a tear coming to her right eye. \"It was great-grandpa's dying wish when I was born. Grandpa, dad, mom, the whole bunch, they didn't let me play with other kids until my sixth birthday, and wouldn't speak to me in anything other than that godforsaken abomination of a tongue\u2014\"\n\nChotchkie's interrupted her moment. \"Can't anyone get a *fucking* burger around here?\"",

At first I thought he was indistinct looking, perfectly unmemorable, but maybe it was the McDonald\u2019s visor throwing me off.

Because I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t look 19,000 years old. I don\u2019t need this level of crazy in my life. I already have a roommate who\u2019s convinced her cat tells her epic tales of Cthulhu style beasts while she sleeps. \u201cSooo, I\u2019m just going to get my shake and go\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you turn immortal?

Why do you think no one ever remembers?\u201d \n\nAlright, I\u2019m just going to ask. \u201cYou\u2019re immortal?\u201d \n\nHe shrugs one square shoulder at me. \u201cNaturally.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd you work at McDonalds?\u201d \n\nHis grin is quick and conspiratorial. \u201cBest place to eat.\u201d \n\nI raise my eyebrows skeptically. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty plebian.\u201d \n\nHe rolls his eyes at me but he seems genuinely happy.

Why, what do you feed on?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do YOU feed on?\u201d I shoot back, alarmed.

I\u2019ve never fed so well. And you?\u201d He tilts his head, rubbing his chin pensively, taking in my outfit and, admittedly, unkempt hair. \u201cLet me guess. Sloth?\u201d \n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Okay, I may be a few weeks behind on my eyebrow upkeep, and yes, I haven\u2019t really combed my hair in about two days, and maybe these clothes should\u2019ve been washed in a week, at least, but that hardly makes me lazy. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of finals, I\u2019ll have you know,\u201d I snap. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.

I crack open my chemistry book, sipping on my shake while I scan the pages and walk at the same time. I sigh. Just another Tuesday afternoon.

Airports, ESL classes, daycares... something had always touched me.  \n\nIt was too late though.  The room melted away like guess on an SAT analogy I'd glazed over.  Never enough time.  Never enough time.  \n\nA feminine body curled snakishly and femininely atop me, a forked tongue darted in and out, the sound a hiss but the words I heard:\n\n\"If you 'Go Looking' for your Lovecraft book in the ball pit again I'm calling the fucking cops.\"",

            "comment": "I entered the store,the fresh smell of grease and soggy fries flooding my nose. How the workers endured the smell for more then fifteen minutes I have no clue,not that it mattered to me but it was always the first thing I thought of when I entered.  \n\nA few seconds later my nose had adjusted to the smell and so I walked up to the register,a friendly voice spoke in the usual zombified teenage cashier tone. You know the one. \u201chi,what can I get for you?\u201d I glanced up at the menu for a second,processing all the items, I had decided I was going to get something different to usual but now I was actually ordering? \u201cUhh. Just a large cheeseburger menu. Meal. I mean meal\u201d \n\nI had tripped over my words. Fantastic. This was honestly not that rare for me. Usually the worker would ignore the mistake and move on... but she was just staring, at first I thought it may have been my clothes or my hair,maybe I had something in my teeth? No no,nothing about me was any different to usual. It took me a second to think about how I spoke. See,I have this odd trick. No matter what language I speak people only hear me in their native tongue. I realised she must\u2019ve been taken aback by this. \n\nIt was just after I realised all this she spoke \u201cno one has spoken in that language in thousands of years. It is forbidden to my people\u201d what? What had she said? Forbidden? I tilted my head a little and apologised \u201csorry,I don\u2019t understand? I asked if I could have a large cheeseburger meal.\u201d her facial expression turned to disgust and she stepped back. \n\nHad I offended her somehow? \n\nTears began running down her face and she ran out,a coworker yelling for her to come back. Everyone watched and the place went quiet. I began to consider chasing her. The restaurant was making me slightly nauseous,ill admit that but I didnt feel like getting involved in anything today. My conscience got the better of me,I felt bad for making her cry. I started running after her,each foot moving slightly faster then the last.",

Let\u2019s go back one day earlier to help shed light on the situation.\n\nJim has just arrived in London, and is already loving it. The sights, the people, he can\u2019t get enough. Only problem though is he has no idea how to find his hotel.\n\n\u201cExcuse me can you help me get to the Crowne Plaza Hotel?\u201d\n\n\u201cOui, tu parles le fran\u00e7ais?!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m sorry I only speak English.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you were just speaking French.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019ve never been good at languages, so I definitely don\u2019t know any french.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you say man. What you\u2019re going to want to do is-\u201c\n\nOur new friend Jim has found himself a companion to aid his travels. He quickly finds his hotel, and turns in for the night.\n\nHe wakes up gets dressed, and immediately goes to the front desk for suggestions on where to eat.\n\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuten Morgen! Deutsch sprechen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sorry just English.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you were just-\u201c\n\n\u201cCan you just tell me where I can grab something to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Walk outside, go 4 blocks over, it\u2019s a great little place with a red awning. Can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk thank you.\u201d\n\nFrom here Jim is out the door, and good food is right within his grasp. He follows the directions to a T, and right when he is certain he has reached the end of the directions there is no red awning in sight.\n\n\u201cHuh that\u2019s weird.\u201d He mumbles.\n\nWith no awning in sight he goes to what he believes is the next best thing.

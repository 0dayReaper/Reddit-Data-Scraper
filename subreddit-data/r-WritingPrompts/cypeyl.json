    "postText": "Hello WritingPrompts!\n\nLike the title says, about ten months ago, I found myself responding to this prompt one night:\n\n&gt; [**[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/)\n\nThen, after serializing it on my subreddit and turning it into a story larger than I ever thought possible, I arrived at the decision about whether to make it a book. For a lot of writers, publishing a book is *the dream*, and in all honesty, I didn\u2019t think I would ever actually do it. But now, after a lot of procrastination, a lot of late nights, a lot of learning, and a ton of editing, it\u2019s here.\n\nThe entire series, named By The Sword, is a high fantasy trilogy of books with paranormal/supernatural elements, of which I\u2019m publishing the first right now which comes in just shy of 100k words long. The book\u2019s cover art was done by the fantastic /u/IsmaelGil, and I\u2019m extremely happy with [how it turned out!](https://i.imgur.com/JIY228X.jpg)\n\nAs the title of this post says, that book is entitled Blood and Steel. You can read its synopsis right here:\n\n&gt; Death is a fickle thing.\n\n&gt; For most, it\u2019s a force of nature, but Agil Novan sees the reaper in a different light. As the greatest swordsman of all time, he cherishes life, and he\u2019s lived one full of both struggle and success. After all of his accomplishments, he too must face the reaper and its scythe.\n\n&gt; When challenged, however, the swordsman is not one to go without a fight. After parrying it once and impressing the reaper with a show of the blade, he is offered something more. A second chance at life\u2014one that he is all but forced to accept.\n\n&gt; Now, stranded in an unfamiliar land with an unfamiliar body and far too many questions, Agil has his life threatened at every turn. Still, he is determined to survive. He knows what the reaper did to him. \n\n&gt; And he has never been one to let vengeance go unfulfilled.\n\n**You can check out the Amazon page for Blood and Steel [here, where you can buy it as an ebook!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6S9FRT)**\n\nThe ebook is priced at $2.99 and the paperback is priced at $9.99.\n\nThe book is also available in a myriad of other marketplaces:\n\n***Kindle Ebook***\n\n[**US**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**UK**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**DE**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**FR**](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**ES**](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**IT**](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**NL**](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**JP**](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**BR**](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**CA**](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**MX**](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B07X6S9FRT) | [**AU**](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07X6S9FRT) \n\n***Physical Paperback***\n\n*Note: With Kindle\u2019s Matchbook program, you can get a free ebook copy with any paperback purchase!*\n\n[**US**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1089217587) | [**UK**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1089217587) | [**DE**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1089217587) | [**FR**](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/1089217587) | [**ES**](https://www.amazon.es/dp/1089217587) | [**IT**](https://www.amazon.it/dp/1089217587) | [**JP**](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/1089217587)\n\n---\n\nIf you do end up reading the book, please consider leaving a review as well! Reviews are invaluable to the success of any independently published book. You can leave a review either on Amazon, or you can review [Blood and Steel on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47989201-blood-and-steel) if you would like.\n\nMy sincerest gratitude if you do end up leaving a rating or a review.\n\n---\n\nAlso, as with how this first book was written, By The Sword is still a serialized story that I post chapter-by-chapter on multiple platforms including my subreddit, /r/Palmerranian. At the moment, I\u2019m almost at the end of the second book in the serialization process. So if you would like to continue reading there, you can find the [story index here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palmerranian/comments/ar6zgy/by_the_sword_homepage/).\n\nNow, without any further ado, I\u2019ll leave you with the first chapter of Blood and Steel!\n\n---\n\n---\n\nLive by the sword, die by the sword. That was the way I lived for so long.\n\nIt was an old adage\u2014ancient even, depending on the version being told, but it was a useful one for someone like me. \n\nI was first told it by my father during the final years of his life. It came only a few short months after I started training, in fact. A few short months of becoming fascinated by the art of sword-fighting and spending every waking minute trying to master it.\n\nMy father was proud of me for my effort. He always gave me the largest smile when I explained this stance or that, detailing my dreams of becoming the greatest swordsman of them all. Of becoming a Knight of Credon and protecting our kingdom more effectively than any before me. He entertained my teenage ramblings without complaint. And since he\u2019d been a swordsman himself during his formative years, he made sure to pass off that ancient wisdom before it became too late.\n\nIt was the last gift he ever gave me.\n\nIf only I\u2019d known how true it was.\n\nThat mantra repeated in my head now as I stared across my path. Standing out there in my field, only a few dozen paces away from me, the reaper stared right back. Wind billowed through its tattered black cloak. It made no effort to conceal the bleached bone underneath. All it did was balance its scythe in skeletal fingers as though taunting me to come and fight.\n\nI wondered why it didn\u2019t simply attack me for my ignorance, why it didn\u2019t finish the job after I had ignored all of the signs. A tense pain in my chest and a sudden shortness of breath were the only warnings I\u2019d gotten during my morning walk. But before the reaper had appeared, I\u2019d shrugged them both off. I\u2019d been stupid and short-sighted enough to allow my time to come.\n\nYet the reaper just stood there, watching me.\n\nWith my sword held at the ready, I considered if it was scared. Whether or not it was doubting the frozen moment in time when its scythe would harvest my soul. Perhaps it hadn\u2019t expected me to resist, I ventured. After all, landing a strike on a swordsman of my caliber wasn\u2019t easy for anyone.\n\nThe rational part of me didn\u2019t think that was it, though. It didn\u2019t fit with the concept of the end-bringer at all. The beast of decay was part of nature as we were told; it was integral to the cycle of the world. And while I\u2019d never entirely agreed with that interpretation, especially not after my father had been ripped away from his life, it still shouldn\u2019t have had any issue with a measly swordsman.\n\nThen again, the word measly hadn\u2019t described me for decades.\n\nI stepped forward, my foot crunching on the path I walked almost every morning. *My* path, I reminded myself. The tranquil sanctuary that I\u2019d cultivated for years. I was supposed to be safe when I walked it, and I had been until *it* had shown up.\n\nA sneer formed on my face as I continued to approach. Its tattered cloak still drifted on the wind. Its scythe still balanced in silence. But as I neared, it looked up. It stared at me, nearly striking fear into my heart.\n\nThe reaper stopped and raised its scythe. It angled the ever-sharpened metal in my direction. For a moment, I could\u2019ve sworn I saw a smile on its face. But I wasn\u2019t sure, as it was already charging my way.\n\nMy body surged into action. The reaper disappeared from its spot and struck through the air like lightning to force me down with its scythe. Yet as the frozen moment passed with the shriek of clashing metal, I was left standing. The resistance was still fresh in my bones.\n\nI\u2019d parried it, I realized, on instinct and fear alone. As I glared back at its still form once more, picking apart details of the bone, I saw the surprise. I knew what it meant. The beast had never been parried before.\n\nA grin grew across my lips as I readied my blade again. Its surprise would keep the scythe at bay for the moment, but I still had to be ready. I would never let my guard down.\n\nAs I\u2019d expected, the surprise faded in short time and it was on me again. I watched it charge with inhuman speed, almost gliding over the ground. I only dodged with a stumble as its scythe cut right through where I\u2019d been.\n\nThat attack had been faster than before, I noted. It had hit closer. I had to be ready.\n\nI furrowed my brows and felt ice-cold fire flood my veins. It signaled the onset of battle, and I took the change in stride. Feeling the burn of sunlight on my skin, I stared back at the beast with everything I had and only barely ducked its next attempt at my life. The blade came through right where my head had been.\n\nThe scythe, however, never reached my former location. Instead, it turned at the last second. But even with the turn of steel, I was ready. It was one of the oldest tricks in the book. \n\nI parried the hit without a second thought. \n\nSurprise returned to its hooded, bleach-white face. The beast stared down at its unstained scythe, and I had to stifle a chuckle. It didn\u2019t matter how fast it was. I would never let my guard down. \n\nI leapt backward, my feet already positioning themselves for the next attack. The beast growled, its tone dark enough to strike terror in any ordinary mind. But I was no ordinary mind\u2014even at my age, I was as sharp. \n\nI narrowed my eyes, brought my sword out to the defense, and ignored the call to blunder. Its skeletal form charged me again\u2014just as I\u2019d predicted. My lips curled slightly as I turned in the nick of time and whipped the hilt of my blade around my wrist.\n\nThe clang that rang out was one to split mountains.\n\nBoth of our weapons fell, but I was more than ready for it. I swept mine up in an instant and was already twisting away. A smile blossomed across my lips. I would never let my guard down. \n\nThen, spinning back with my blade in hand, I shoved steel deep into the hooded cloak. My ears twitched at the screech of metal tearing through bone.\n\nAs soon as I heard it, I retracted my arm. My feet pushed me backward, and I swung my blade out to guard. Looking over the serene path turned battlefield, I saw too many familiar things. The ornate stone lining in the dirt. The shaded patch of trees. My humble homestead barely visible over the hills.\n\nIt had no right to be here, I told myself. It had no right to take me here. This was my *home,* world\u2019s dammit. And I would never let my guard down.\n\nImages flashed through my mind\u2014parries, deflects, attacks. I was ready. The power in my muscles was already responding to clean commands. But as it turned out, none of it was needed.\n\nThe beast stood, paralyzed. \n\nCarrying the same surprise it had shown seconds before, the reaper stared at the grass. Its ash-black robe wavered in the breeze and its skeletal form hunched as though responding to a weight. Watching it, I relaxed my shoulders a hair. The situation was painted clear as day on its face. It had never been hit before either.\n\nRagged black cloth lifted back off its head to expose pale white bone to the sunlight above. Its dark eyes were riddled with confusion when it turned to me. It stared, and I almost looked, almost sealed my glorious fate. But at the last moment, I recognized the trick. \n\nDarkness crawled out of its eyes. I snapped mine shut before it could take me, my father\u2019s proud face flashing in my mind. Another one of his warnings played back through my head.\n\n*Never look into the face of death.*\n\nThe embodiment of decay rushed at me anew\u2014I felt it in the air. Heard it. *Smelled* it. Its speed was even greater than before and I only barely shook off the strike. Even with my eyes closed, with my most important sense stripped away, I would never let my guard down.\n\nI snapped my eyes open while sprinting away, readied for the attacks that were sure to hit my unarmed side. I waited, my ears perked and my eyes sharp. The strikes never came. \n\nAfter a dozen strides, I turned back to the beast, expecting to see the same dry surprise as before. I didn\u2019t. Instead, I saw the beast\u2019s cracked, white skull with the hood completely off.\n\nBitterness fell on my tongue. It coated my mouth with disgust. I felt power radiating from in front of me; I felt it washing off the bone. Simply looking into its face forced my blood to run cold. Where I\u2019d expected to see the same complete and utter shock, I saw confirmation of what I hadn\u2019t wanted to be true. An expression more terrifying than any other.\n\nA smile.\n\nThe crooked, skeletal grin was perfect and horrid at the same time. It spawned a sense of worry deep within me that I rejected as unnatural. I was a warrior, a swordsman, a *knight*\u2014I didn\u2019t have time for worry. And yet, as I felt my gaze stay frozen, the dread only deepened. \n\nThe beast didn\u2019t rush at me. It didn\u2019t move to attack. It didn\u2019t even reach for its scythe. For some reason, it seemed done with the fight.\n\n\u201cImpressive display,\u201d it said, words reaching my ears on the wind. Its voice came like the concept of decay itself, forcing me to shudder as it ate at my mind. I hadn\u2019t seen its bony mouth move an inch.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied through gritted teeth, unconsciously getting myself into stance.\n\nThe beast noticed and raised a dismissive hand. \u201cThere is no need for that. I have no intention of keeping this up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what do we do now?\u201d I asked, keeping my gaze as harsh as nails. My fingers curled around my blade\u2019s loyal grip. I knew it was playing with me\u2014I knew the reaper\u2019s words were a trick, but I would never let my guard down.\n\nThe beast chuckled dryly. \u201dYou are unique.\u201d\n\nI glared at the thing, barely avoiding its eyes. It was toying with me and I knew it. Why couldn\u2019t I take advantage? Why couldn\u2019t I just strike now? No, I thought, dismissing the questions. It was smarter than that. It knew I wouldn\u2019t let my guard down, and it wouldn\u2019t let its guard down either. \n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d was the only word I mustered in response.\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame to let someone like you fall to the house of the dead.\u201d\n\nMy gaze lifted, brows furrowing on my face. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could give you another chance,\u201d it said, the tone of its voice spawning hatred deep in my chest. The beast\u2019s smile all but dropped as the force in its words made one thing abundantly clear.\n\nIt was serious. \n\nMy mind raced, remembering my younger form longing for more time by the sword. Would it really give me another chance? \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d it said, the dark words dragging hope out of my soul.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d I asked.\n\nIts grin returned, more devilish than before. A chill ran down my spine. \u201cYou will have a different body. But you will retain your mind. Life would be more a curse if I were to take that from you.\u201d\n\nI considered the offer against my better judgment. The same instincts that were guiding my stance screamed at me to stop. But as I stared at the beast, sunlight dancing on cracked bone, I could find no fault in its intentions.\n\n\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d\n\nIts grin grew wider. \u201cOne touch\u2014and a new life is yours.\u201d\n\nOvercome by a dark, sudden, inexorable urge, I agreed. As though manipulated by some outside force, the desperation in my mind preyed on my memories and won out over all doubt. The reaper appeared next to me like a shot of ashen lightning.\n\nIts finger approached my shoulder, cooling the air around it as it went. My grip tightened and my mind screamed, but it was already too late. The bleach-white bone touched my skin and my body filled with ice. \n\nMy mind burned. My bones froze. And I experienced the most agonizing second of the rest of my life before everything went black.\n\n---\n\nA jolt of motion startled me up from my slumber. I twisted, feeling only the most distant of pain. Everything was numb. A cold, unfamiliar haze was draped over my mind. I stared into the black, faintly wishing for the ability to feel again. Unfortunately, my wish was granted in short time.\n\nMy body snapped up. A frigid wind crashed against my face, sending shivers down my spine and a howl through my ears. In a second, everything came back and my mind spun through the images. New mixed with old and familiar with foreign as my mind swirled, but I couldn\u2019t make sense of any of it. I clenched my jaw and waited for it to stop. And yet, as soon as it did, one thought was left, one that forced my lips into a smile. \n\nThe beast hadn\u2019t lied. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I hoped to see my land. I hoped to see my fields, the rows of crops that I was no longer even required to tend. I hoped to see my wife, the beautiful face that just barely escaped me. But the eyes that only vaguely felt like my own were met with a completely different sight. \n\nAll around me, spinning in the wind as if just to mock me for my choices, was a dark forest that I couldn\u2019t recognize. Feeling the horrid cold cut deeper, my smile faded.\n\nI forced myself up, noting soreness in my bones. My muscles were hollow. My arms were shorter. My legs were\u2026 different. Everything about me felt *frail*, as if on the verge of collapse. And as I sat up on whatever rock my body had been strewn across, I felt sharp pain cut a deep pit through my stomach.\n\nMy brain started to spin again, the foreign thoughts, worries, and memories all coming back at once. As the waves passed, they were replaced with regret that was only my own. I shivered, the truth cementing in my mind.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d wanted. It wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d wanted at all. I closed my eyes\u2014if they even were my eyes\u2014and shook my head, trying to force it all away. My efforts were useless as the world set in and one horrible thought echoed out in my head.\n\n*I\u2019d let my guard down.*\n\n---\n\n[Original Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/e8pg0oa/) | [My Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palmerranian)",

One of my friends spends 1k on his covers, and while they're very, very nice, we make fun of him for spending that much.\n\nBut, keep in mind, depending on how sales go, even a cover of $200 could take months/years to pay off - and you have to have that much up front.  Most people don't have a thousand dollars sitting around to spend on a cover, on top of anything you spent on editing (which can be thousands more in a hurry).  Many people don't have $200 sitting around they can throw on essentially a passion project.  I've got writer friends who don't have $50 to throw at a cover.\n\nSo...everyone's got their own budget.  If you didn't like the cover, that's fine - but it might be best to leave it at that :)",

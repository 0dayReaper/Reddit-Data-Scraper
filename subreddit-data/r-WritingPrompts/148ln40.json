            "comment": "In the grim darkness of the life of the accursed, there was only war. The same battle, every day, for millenia. The gift of a wrathful God, who's name was long forgotten. The sun set on a battlefield blanketed in blood yet again... although the night was pierced by a roar, a choke, and a whine.\n\nThe sun arose on the fresh field, and the accursed readied themselves for battle. Midday came and still no enemies charged over the hill, no calvary flanking from the sides. Silence. The sun set on a field untouched by battle for the first time the accursed could remember.\n\nThe sun rose the next day, brighter than before, as if the flames of the star stood before the accursed. The tip of the flaming broadsword touched the grassy ground as its owner stared at the figure, who had scrambled up into a ready stance with their weapon.\n\n\"Hold, little one, there will be no fighting today.\" The deep voice of the armored red drake rang out across the land, and the smaller figure kept their stance.\n\n\"I was cursed to fight forever, who are you?\"\n\nThe drake squatted down to somewhat reach eye level, gazing into the soul of the formerly-accursed. \"Someone who once, long ago, committed my children to your fate. I, and my kin, are making amends for our misdeeds. Your curse is lifted, and you will be brought back.\"\n\nThe figure dropped their weapon, and fell to their knees. \"Salvation?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTears flowed freely and the figure felt the weight of past sins fall from their back. \"Please, your name.\"\n\n\"I am Helianes, a Knight of Dawn.\"\n\nFollow the adventure at r/PrimusWrites",

By now I'd fought everything from Hoplites to Wehrmacht, always waking up in a new warzone as soon as the battle was done.\n\n\"You will not defy me a second time,\" boomed the voice of Aries in my memory. \"For all eternity, you shall know nothing but war.\"\n\nBut now, the clamor of battle seemed just as distant a memory, even though it has been mere minutes since I had last fired my rifle. Corpses should have littered the land around me, and yet, I found myself standing by a lake - silent, but for the chirping of birds. Still, but for the buzzing of dragonflies above the water. I had forgotten what peace felt like. \n\nWhat happened?\n\nWhere was I?\n\nWho was I?\n\nI had turned down Aries' offer to be his champion so long ago, that I still don't remember a time before it.\n\nLegends say that Aries was cast down by a new god, and his curse simply took millennia to break rather than eternal eons. May he be blessed, should that be so.\n\nAll I know of this supposed new god is that his followers bear crimson tattoos and the symbol of the Greek Omega.\n\nThey are the ones who told me I am free.",

            "comment": "The field is littered with corpses, deprived of life, and adorned with broken weapons and armors belonging to the departed - clouded and darkened skies. The corpses pile up to thousands and even millions, tainting what was once a pristine field of green. What was in place of the blades of grass were shattered and rusty metal, many pieces of flesh that were once separate living beings and entities now mesh and blend rotten.  \n\n\nIn the middle of the rotting cesspool of a battlefield where hungry birds by the hundreds feast on the fallen, two warriors fighting it out as if their live depends on it. This fight or war has been going on longer than the natural lifespans of either of the two warriors, you can even say that dozens of lifetimes have passed over. As if everyone on this very field have been forcibly locked into a never-ending battle by some deity or being from the beyond.  \n\n\nDespite the rusty armor of distant ages they wear, the dried and rotten life-takers they wield that have been abused beyond recognition, the two warriors are distinct but yet look similar to each other as they fight on the rotting corpses of their fellow combatants. Both of them are fully incased of what was once pristine and clean armor, covering every aspect of their body as if their identities before this battle were thrown away like all the broken bodies and weapons they dance on top of.  \n\n\nOne warrior is fighting like a savage feral beast fighting like they're caged and surround by danger. The weapon they wield appears to what was once a divine greatsword of prestige and fame, rusted and chipped like the heavily plated armor they wear. The winged helmet they wear is devoid of any wings, rusted beyond belief and at the cusp of breaking apart.  \n\n\nThe other warrior fighting this savage fighter is moving as if all meaning of life was drained, devoid of any emotion or reasoning. The weapon they wield is a giant metal fist armed and kitted with a blade, rusted and broken into just a simple jagged wrist blade. The armor they wear look mechanical and machine-like, but any resemblance of a technological wonder has long since decayed over the never-ending battle.  \n\n\nThen without any warning, a single arm flies high up in the sky like a flag or banner; signaling the end of eternity. As the arm falls down from the skies, the wrist blade it wears stakes the corpse of its owner or what remains of them. Deprived of all of what keep them whole and alive as a rusted and chipped greatsword ends whatever remains of them.  \n\n\nWhat was once two warriors now have become one. As if to declare the victors of the battle, the clouded and darkened skies above starts breaking away. The light of the sun seeps into the empty battlefield, slowly shining light on top of all of the departed and the only living combatant as the feasting birds fly almost in unison. The lone warrior is kneeling on top of the vanquished enemy, breathing as soon as the light pierces through all that they are.  \n\n\nWith the skies becoming whitened clouds and blue, the warrior stands up with the hilt of their greatsword as a crutch, bones and flesh crunch under the weight of their rusted armor. Staring up towards the beyond with nothing but silence, as if to damn the deity or gods watching them or so.",

He knew not where the enemy came from. They were always just ... there.\n\nWhat was he to do now?\nWithout enemies to slay, he was. Free?\nHad his penance been paid?\n\nHe saw no way out of this place, never in the millennia had he ever seen anything other than the bodies of the fallen, and the bodies of the soon to fall.\n\nIt struck him that there was absolutely nothing out there.\n\nOnly a blackness that clawed at the light. \nThe light didn't have a source, it just, was. He didn't want to think on that.\n\nHe was now worried that he stood on nothing.\n\nVoid.\n\nVoid?\n\nThere was gravity. Well, he assumed there was. His arms had weight, as did his weapons.\nBut there was nothing observable under his feet.\nIt felt like he was standing on ground.\n\nWhat was this place?\nHe remembered that there was a field here. It started as a neat green field.\n\nAs he remembered the field, it shimmered into existence. \n\nWhat magic was this!?\n\nNo, not magic, he reminded himself.\nThis was his hell.",

            "comment": "At first, once you learned how, it had been almost easy to fight. Endless, exhausting, certainly, but easy. The enemies had been obvious, clear. Bad people. People who tortured, who murdered, who inflicted pain on others. The God of War cursed you to fight, but his followers ensured your morals had stayed in tact. \n\nIt had been that way for millennia. First the warring chiefs. Then those they called warlords. Then kings and monarchs. Crusaders from many faiths. Then the ones they called war hawks, a different kind of warlord, but much the same. On and on. Humans had always been good at evil, you learned. \n\nThen it slowed, and eventually, as you rest upon your weapon, you realize you're alone. Entirely. So alone your weapon, which took the form of your opponent's technology, was blurry, unable to form anything concrete. You wait, watching, yet nobody comes. You'd learned to mark the passage of humanity by the technology they died with to fight you, yet now, nobody came. \n\n\"Their wars have changed. They do not need us now.\" It was a voice you had not heard since it first spoke the curse. Standing beside you is an old man, haggard, worn. Not the mighty, proud God of War you once angered, so long ago. \"They fight crueler wars now. The evil ones go free, and the children are the injured.\" He looks at you. \"Entire generations now have grown up and not known a day's peace. When I taught them to fight, you alone resisted. You swore it would be the end of humanity, that they would lose themselves.\" \n\nYou nod. You remember that day. Standing alone against a god who swore you'd learn or bow. 10,000 years later, you were an expert at fighting, but never bowed, and still stood by your promise, that you'd never wage war on men. Not the ones alive, with lives to live.  \n\n\"I thought it would make them stronger, that they'd bond together to survive with war, that it would teach them. But they are bloodthirsty, cruel. Crueler than I could ever have imagined. How did you know? How did you see so far into the future?\" \n\nYou look at him sadly, this shriveled, decayed man. Your brother. \n\n\"You were their God of war, but I was their god of thought. I know their minds, their imagination. And it is capable of infinity. Good, or evil. You opened the door to let them explore evil, and they delighted in it.\"",

Althan looked towards the black and gray swirls that made up the sky.\n\"Is this all you have for me!?!\" He screamed through gusts of dirt.\n\nWith a smile, Althan looked down on the small man. He almost felt bad for him. Almost.\n\nHe gripped the haft of his Warhammer and lifted it over his head.\n\n\"Wait...\" \n\nBefore he could stop his hammer landed, crushing the man's head. \n\nAlthan's heart sank. He spoke? No. He couldn't have spoken. \n\nAlthan dropped the hammer as blood squirted from the man's open skull. \n\nNo, he did speak. He said wait...\n\nAlthan undid his armor, letting the heavy metal fall to the ground in pufts of dirt. His hands checked his body looking for any injuries. \n\nWas he dying? No, that wouldn't explain it. He had never heard a voice when he died before.\n \nAlthan kneeled down, grabbing the man's shoulders. \n\n\"Did you...did you speak to me?\"\n\nSilence. \n\nTears welled up in his eyes as his brow furrowed. He yelled a gut wrenching scream towards the sky. \n\nHe wanted to curse the god who made this hell for him, but in one last cruelty the god took the memory of his name. \n\nBut he yelled none the less. He yelled loud enough that the bastard would be forced to hear him.\n\n\"Another cruel trick. Fine. Bring me your next champion!\"\nAlthan picked his hammer from the ground and waited, looking out into the dark dusty storm. \n\nHis eyes drifted towards the dead body. So he spoke. It meant nothing. The bastard was always coming up with new cruel ways to torment him. \n\n\"This is just what I needed!\" He yelled. \"Today, every champion you send will DIE!\"\n\nThe wind roared and he waited for his next challenger. \n\nHe waited...and waited...\n\nHis stomach felt uneasy. Something was wrong. \n\nHis eyes were pulled back to the dead man on the floor.\n\n His body. It was still here! \n\nAlthan gritted his teeth and slammed his hammer down onto the corpse, smashing any piece of meat and bone into dust to be carried off into the wind.\n\n\"On with it!\" He yelled. \n\nOnly the wind answered, and it was the same answer he received for millennias.\n\nAlthan panted. What is this? What's this trick? Never before had he been given this much rest. His torment, his punishment, was to fight and die until the end of time. And that's what he did. \n\n\"Enough games\" Althan yelled before running into the black swirls of dust where his challengers emerged. \n\nThe wind and dirt pushed back against him. Cutting his skin and burning his nose and throat. \n\nHe pushed on.\n\nThe wind grew louder and louder. His ears felt as if they were being pierced with needles.\n\nHe pushed on.\n\nWhen he knees began to buckle and he heart wavered, feeling as if it would stop any moment.\n\nHe pushed on.\n\nStep by step until...\n\nAlthan fell to his knees. The wind was gone. His pain, it was...gone! \n\nHe opened his eyes and a bright white light soothed them.\n\nA woman, dressed from her neck to her feet in a deep purple robe smiled at him.\n\n\"Welcome Althan\".",

His horns wrapped around his head like a crown, pulsing and shifting in the ever constant afternoon sun. His skin was a dark purple, with black scales peppering his many arms. Flames wreathed the hooves upon his four legs. He looked down upon the me with a harsh and steady glare. \n\nI stared back, defiance carved onto my face. \n\nAfter a few moments, the god spoke,\n\n\"Have you any idea how many you have slain?\"\n\nCenturies of battle had long since taken my ability to form words. I shrug, having never made an attempt to keep track. \n\n\"Have you any idea how long you have been here?\"\n\nI spit at the ground before him, sour at having lost the sense of time.\n\n\"Have you had enough of battle?\"\n\nIf my vocal cords still worked, I would have laughed. My muscles twitched with anticipation. The presence of this entity made every danger sense that I have tell me that death may finally be nigh. I sling a perfectly placed dagger at the throat of the monstrosity as my answer. \n\nThe dagger strikes his throat, bouncing off harmlessly with a ping. A thunderous laugh follows. \n\n\"BWAHAHAHAHA!! As I suspected. This hell I've created for you has turned out to be more a whetstone than a punishment. And my my, have you become sharp.\"\n\nThe scheming twinkle in the evil one's eye unsettled me by an order of magnitude more than any foe he'd thrown at me. I raise my shield and ready my broadsword. \n\n\"Tell me, what is the worst fate to befall the greatest of warriors?\" \n\nHis words emanate more from inside my head than his demonic lips. With a flash, the beast is now beside me. \n\n\"I'll tell you. When death is the only gift you are capable of granting, then the absence of life becomes your undoing.\"\n\nAnd then, Zorguthaxis shimmered out of existence, accompanied by a crimson mist.

The empty wind blew, and Tolte gripped his weapon tighter, sure for a moment it was a sign of a sneaking wave...\n\n\"Cowards!\" He shouted.\n\nOnly air replied, twisting through the canyon and the sea it poured into, dead radiating away from the mouth of this hellish river.\n\nFor another moment, he doubted, but another moment passed. And another. A respite unlike any he'd ever been subjected to.\n\nTolte lifted the visor, and for the first time that he could remember, he peered into a clear dawn sunlight.\n\n\"FIIIIGHT!\" He yelled again. And again, nothing spoke. He could hear the tide, the buzz of flies.  The dawn brought crows, which over generations had grown to the sizes of eagles in their ever-feasting.\n\nThe hand that had held his weapon uncurled for the first time, and it fell to the ground beside him. He looked upon his open palm, alien to him almost, that it had always been filled with some killing thing or another.\n\nA belt, somewhere under his armor, gave way, and pieces of his protections began to rain off his body, barely holding on for so, so long.\n\nTolte's mind wandered in leaps and bounds, as he stepped out of the husk of his war life.\n\n\"Migzaa! What trickery is this?\" He pleaded into the air.\n\nMigzaa did not appear before him as he always had, invincible as a mountain. No, instead, a frail, puny creature lay at Tolte's feet, something barely a shadow.\n\nOnly then did Tolte realize how long it had been since the god had taunted him, had cursed him. And then Tolte understood.\n\n\"I've killed... all of them, haven't I? Every single one who ever believed in you, you pathetic ghost!\"\n\nMigzaa crawled away from Tolte, holding up it's hands in terror, but it no longer had its massive maw, nor its hot claws nor droves of servant warriors.\n\n\"I'm the only one who's left who even knows who you are... aren't I? The magic of your curse upon me is all you have left, isn't it?\"\n\nTolte removed his helmet and straddled over the withered creature, reaching into his pocket within. In his hands, two figurines, a woman, a child.\n\n\"You know, I used to know their names. Their faces. Their relation to me, hell. I've lived so long like this... they're just rocks to me now.\"\n\nMigzaa's eyes were wide, terrified.\n\nTolte grabbed Migzaa by the jaw, prying open his mouth. And with his idols in his fist, plunged them into Migzaa's throat. Migzaa clawed at air and at it's neck, but there was no mercy here. Only hollow wind, only Tolte.",

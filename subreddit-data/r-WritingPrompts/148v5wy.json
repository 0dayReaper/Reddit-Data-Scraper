I know those coordinates were right, but what happened to Atlantis?\n\n\"Eremos, you're back?\" Reya, my sister, asked me.\n\nShe lives in Athens with her husband, and I came here to see her, see my nephews and nieces. Mother felt I'll and stayed behind, but it was supposed to be a quick trip.\n\n\"I... I don't know what happened. I can't find my way home,\" I told her.\n\nReya began to laugh, \"You, Eremos, getting lost? That's preposterous. I remember you brag that you were the best sailor in the seas.\"\n\n\"Then why can't I find Atlantis?\" I asked.\n\nReya's smile quickly faded, \"You are being serious?\"\n\n\"I sailed before the sun set, and I can't find it. Reya, it's gone.\"\n\nReya looked out at sea, as if from here she could find it. Not far from where we stood, we heard sailors talking. They could not find Atlantis either.\n\n\"An island can not just vanish,\" Reya told me.\n\n\"Then what happened to our old home?\" I asked her.",

            "comment": "According to Tarov's first law of wishing, all possible wishes can be reduced to a financial value. Want to be a prince? There is a value you could spend to buy land from various countries, a value you could use to hire your own personal military, and a value you could use to jump-start a population and economy. If you can find another wish that would produce more financial gain than that would cost, it's better to make the other wish.\n\nAccording to Tarov's second law of wishing, the only reasons to use a wish directly for a purpose are for speed, and trust related reasons. You can certainly find a more profitable wish than a loaded gun, but if you need to defend yourself, wishing for a gold mine to be discovered on land you own won't help fast enough. Additionally, if you wanted to do some kind of horrifying crime against all of humanity, you might have trouble converting wealth into the extinction of an entire continent, as do-gooders will start getting in the way.\n\nTarov rose to fame when he wished for a specific asteroid to be pushed into stable earth orbit, allowing relatively cheap mining of the asteroid that was rich in rare materials. To-date, it has been the most profitable individual wish, and any time someone found a source of wishing they always contacted his Geni Law corporation to maximize financial output.\n\n--------\n\nI humbly submit that to date, nobody has ever made Earth so BORING AND LAME as Tarov. I rolled through the gauche neighborhood to deliver some grub, some asshole living in a solid gold house had called out for pizza. It was one of the nicer solid gold houses I supposed, but they were all pretty ugly. Style hadn't caught up to the times, and people who grew up with gold as a sign of wealth still couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that it was cheaper than concrete now.\n\nI knocked on the door. \"Mike's Magic Pizza!\" I shouted. There was no response.\n\n\"Mike's Magic Pizza, you wish and we make it appear!\" I shouted, louder this time.\n\nCars were parked in the parking lot, so someone was home. I decided to walk down the driveway to check for a side door, visions in my head of dead pizza delivery drivers telling me to just keep knocking or go back. I ignored the impulse though, but but a chill gripped my insides as I saw blood behind the house.\n\nCareful not to make a sound, I crept closer. Nothing in the backyard was making a sound, so I kept edging around the corner until I could make out a pair of bodies. From the looks of it, there had been a nasty fight. Someone won, but they bled out only a few yards away.\n\nMy cell was in my hand in a moment, but I froze before I called the authorities. Clenched in the hands of the woman who had tried crawling away was a diamond ring, and the third diamond in the ring had a distinct glow to it.\n\nA wishing ring. With one wish left.\n\nI froze in place for I don't know how long. I saw people killing ME for the ring if I tried to wait to use it. I saw myself living in my own garish gold house, dressed in gaudy expensive clothes. I saw myself trying to hide the ring in my apartment. I saw myself making a wish, but then being tracked down by the authorities after they pieced together where the ring had gone.\n\nWhat little sense I had left said I should just leave it be. Let someone else ruin their life for it. Nine times out of ten taking a wish like this ruins my life.\n\nI could wish for wealth or lawyers, but other more powerful people had MORE wealth and MORE lawyers than I could get with a single wish, and they would find me and crush me. I could wish for them to think I was their friend, but they had already used wishes of their own to immunize their top ranked people from mind altering wishes. The people at the top were too big, I was too small, and I couldn't clear the gap with a single wish.\n\nThe sensible thing was to leave it alone.\n\nBut my mind suddenly spun, captured by an idea. What was the LEAST sensible thing I could do? If I wished for wealth, that would easily implicate me. But I had this one moment to put a wish towards something that made the world more FUN. If it was cool for EVERYONE, then it couldn't be linked to me, could it?\n\nI set the pizzas down and ran back to my car. A pair of old gloves were in the trunk with my tools. I carefully slipped them on, and the ring onto the glove, careful not to leave any marks in the blood nearby. The diamond glowed a captivating color, glistening through its faceted edges.\n\n\"I wish\" I began, \"That domesticated riding grizzly bears were cheaper, safer, and more affordable than cars!\"\n\nThe light winked out.\n\nI hesitated, unsure if it worked, but it didn't matter yet. I carefully placed the ring back where it had been, then made sure my gloves were clean, and just before I called the authorities, my Pizza Delivery Bear came around the side of the house to see why I was taking so long.\n\nShortly after the police arrived on their bears, curiously not thinking it was a strange way to travel, they took my statement, and I was free to ride my Pizza Bear back to Mike's Magic Pizza. Confident that what I had done, was 100% better than anything I could have bought with money.",

            "comment": "Adam: Hi there, this is Adam, a consultant with GENI LAW! How may we help you?\n\nShirley: I saw your ad, and I have a genie who's granting me 3 wishes. A Middle Eastern one in a gold lamp.\n\nAdam: No problem, that's one of the most common genies in our knowledge database. Please let me know what wishes you want to make.\n\nShirley: I want a ton of money, I want to live in my dream house, and I want to get together with Ryan Barton, he was my high school sweetheart.\n\nAdam: Money, we can work on this. First, you need to think about how much money you want, exactly. Include how much it will cost to buy your dream house so you kill two birds with one stone. To ensure the money is something you can actually spend, do remember to tell the genie that you want your cash to be legitimate tender, in the currency you desire, and somewhere easily accessible to you. Lastly...well genies don't do love. It's one of those taboo things. Instead, ask for as many opportunities as it takes to make this Ryan warm up to you. Nobody can promise love will blossom, but this is close enough as it gets!\n\nShirley: Thanks, Adam! I'll give it a shot and give you a 5-star review if it works out for me!\n\n------\n\nAdam: Hi there, this is Adam, a consultant with GENI LAW! How may we help you?\n\nBrad: My 3 wishes are to be a star player on the football team I'm at, score some hot chicks, and never run out of booze!\n\nAdam: Oh erm...sure. To ensure the genie doesn't mess up your wish, it would help to specify the name of the team you're in, which league you wish the team to compete in, and what championships you wish to win. Now, if all you want is to get phone numbers...just ask the genie to give you the phone numbers of the girls you fancy. From there, its all up to you. If you really do become a well-paid star player, you should be able to buy enough booze to satisfy your needs, so wish for something else in the first place!\n\nBrad: Okay...how about this for a 3rd wish? I want to be free of injuries so I don't have to sit out on matches.\n\nAdam: That sounds like a good one. All you need is to specify the duration that you anticipate you will be playing. Even an injury-free life isn't infinite.\n\nBrad: Hey thats cool! Thanks for the tips, man! When my wishes are done, you wanna join me for a drink?\n\nAdam: That won't be necessary. All I ask is that you pay my fees.",

            "comment": "\u201cUm, is this the right place? Hello? Ow, is someone here?\u201d Erica stumbled over a few loose boxes, pushing her way into what looked like an abandoned apartment building. Cobwebs and moss decorated the squared room, giving it an eerier 80s horror vibe. Just as she was about to give up hope, Grant Bodazzle bounced up from behind a pile of boxes. His \u2018I hate magic\u2019 T-shirt stained in what could either be tomato sauce or blood. On the shirt was a small graphic of a wand being snapped over a knee, adding to the shirt\u2019s message.\n\n \n\n\u201cYes, Barry- I mean Grant Bodazzle is here.\u201d He said, flashing his signature grin, missing a few teeth, leaving him with a patchy smile. \u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d Grant took a step back, trying to give the panicked woman some space. When she finally calmed down, he smiled again. \u201cGuess you\u2019ve seen the ad? Or you\u2019re from the health department. I keep telling you, selling four sandwiches from your home doesn\u2019t count as a restaurant. You can\u2019t fine me if someone gets sick.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not from the health department. I\u2019m here about a genie. I saw your ad.\u201d Erica quietly said, holding up a broken tennis racket that contained the soul of Ryan Mchandle. A man legendary not for his talents in the beautiful game of tennis, but his ability to beat someone with a racket after losing. His spirit becoming a genie after death, leaving Erica with a rather unfriendly genie to negotiate with.\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, yes. Sorry, moving pains. I only just bought this office last week. I\u2019ve got a good feeling about it. It just has that smell of success. Or is that a gas leak? Nah, couldn\u2019t be. I couldn\u2019t afford to pay the gas bill this month.\u201d Grant muttered to himself, only to clap his hands, putting his game face on. \u201cTake a seat.\u201d\n\n \n\nErica looked over the room. Seeing only boxes, a few half eaten sandwiches and a photo frame that still had the stock photo family in it. Weirdly enough, Grant had glued his own face over the stock photo husband, attempting to make himself look more family friendly. Even if the two bodies hardly matched.\n\n \n\n\u201cSit where?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAnywhere. We\u2019re a no chairs company. Did you know chair related fatalities make up ten percent of workplace deaths? Not to mention the health risks that come from sitting around all day. If anything, I should charge you a fitness fee for helping your blood flow. Oh, speaking of fees, do you have my money?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cMoney? Isn\u2019t it a free consultation?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAh, yes. That is true. A free consultation. It\u2019s $20 for the booking fee. I know you didn\u2019t book per se, but if I give you my time, that means I can\u2019t take another client. It\u2019s standard in the genie business.\u201d\n\nErica sighed and handed him the twenty dollars. He was the only person she could find in the area that would even take something like this seriously. If it took $20, she would hand the money over.\n\n \n\n\u201cOk, there. So, what do you need to know?\u201d Erica asked, about to sit on the floor, only stopping when she noticed a cheese stain. Instead, she stood, waiting to see what was required in a consultation.\n\n \n\n\u201cUsually, I have a questionnaire, but I lost my printer last week in a bar fight.\u201d Grant said apologetically, not wanting to explain why he took a printer to a bar, or why he threw it at the biggest guy he saw that night. $10 margaritas did have a tendency to make men do silly things and Grant wasn\u2019t immune to it. Not that the printer would have worked. He hadn\u2019t paid the power bill either.\n\n \n\n\u201cOk, so what questions do you have?\u201d She asked, getting a little impatient. It felt like he was mocking her at this point. Not taking her genie problems seriously.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat type of genie is it?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tennis player?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cA tennis player? No, what\u2019s it look like? Big and Blue? Serpent shaped? A floating object? Human shaped?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, like a tennis player. He says his name is Ryan Mchandle?\u201d Erica couldn\u2019t even say that while looking at the man, knowing just how stupid it all sounded.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you have the ghost of legendary bad boy Ryan Mchandle in that tennis racket? Not only do you have his soul in that racket, he\u2019s also now a genie?\u201d Grant rolled his eyes, about to show her the door. \u201cIs this one of those Yourtube pranks?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou mean, YouTube? No, I can prove it.\u201d She rubbed the racket and out popped the angry genie, Ryan Mchandle. His fluffy caterpillar shaped moustache swinging as he moved his head.\n\n \n\n\u201cOI, WHERE THE BLODOY HELL ARE WE? I TOLD YA, YOU CAN HAVE THREE WISHES BUT THEY HAVE TO BE RELATED TO TENNIS OR BEATING UP PEOPLE.\u201d Ryan Mchandle screamed. The genie was in a pair of tight tennis shorts, ones that Grant didn\u2019t wish to stare at for too long.\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually him. That perfectly untamed moustache. The shorts that made a generation of mothers faint. OOOOH, that broken weapon of a racket. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHuh? Whose this weirdo?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my genie lawyer? I wanted to discuss our wish dilemma with a third party.\u201d Erica said, currently the most sensible one in the room.\n\n \u201cWith this idiot? Looks like a fraud. Alright, what do you want then? I told her she can have any tennis related wish.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cUh.\u201d Grant stopped fawning over one of his idols, regathering himself. \u201cWell, as much as it pains me to disagree with you. Technically, you have to grant any wish.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAnd who will bloody make me?\u201d\n\n \n\nGrant didn\u2019t have a suitable answer for that. It wasn\u2019t like there was a committee on Genie's wish regulations. Grant\u2019s whole lawyer business was made with the mindset that a genie wouldn\u2019t know how powerless he was. Most humans shivered at hearing the word \u2018Lawyer\u2019. He just assumed Genie\u2019s would be the same.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou will make him, won\u2019t you?\u201d Erica said, trying to show some confidence, wanting to convince herself that her $20 hadn\u2019t been wasted. \u201cHe\u2019s a lawyer. Best on this side of the town.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cLet me guess. Only lawyer in this side of town? Ugh, you're just like my bloody manager. Do you know what happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe ran off with your wife after you died in that car crash? Inheriting your fortune?\u201d Grant asked, scratching the back of his head.\n\n \n\n\u201cHE DID WHAT? I THOUGHT I KILLED HIM?\u201d \n\n \n\n\u201cOh, no. God, no. That\u2019s right, you tried to kill him, and he faked his death. There\u2019s a good Netflix documentary about it. Actually, not that good. More like watchable. It\u2019s drawn out. \u201c\n\n \n\n\u201cThat slimy little\u2026 OK, new deal. You want other wishes, right? Use one of your wishes to torment my ex manger and I\u2019ll give you whatever you want.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI could never hurt another person. I can\u2019t accept that.\u201d Erica mumbled, the idea of doing something so horrible turning her stomach. Grant, however, rubbed his hands together.\n\n \n\n\u201cMay I speak to my client?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cUgh, whatever. Go ahead.\u201d Ryan sulked, moving over to the corner of the room, swinging his hand up and down, practicing his famous downward head spike while he waited.\n\n \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t do it. I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cEasy.\u201d Grant leaned in a little closer, half watching the famous technique as he whispered. \u201cHis managers been dead for years. Just say some dumb thing about him getting crushed or stabbed. It won\u2019t disturb a skeleton.\u201d\n\n \n\nErica\u2019s face twisted, disgusted at the thought. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve upgraded from murder to corpse desecration?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that or tennis wishes?\u201d\n\n \n\nErica sighed, caving to the idea. She wanted those wishes, but she also wanted to be freed from Ryan Mchandle. Soon the genie was called back over, Grant giving him the terms.\n\n \n\n\u201cMy client will make one wish regarding your manager. In return, you will give us two wishes that suit our needs. Agreed?\u201d Grant offered his hand.\n\n \n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Ryan went to shake his hand, only for the genie\u2019s hand to float through it.\n\n \n\n\u201cThat still counts as a shake.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I know. I\u2019m not going to rob ya. Ok, make him suffer.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI wish for his\u2026. Chest to pop open and for worms to fill it.\u201d Erica said, hurriedly saying whatever came to her mind.\n\n \n\n\u201cOH, WHAT A WISH. I wish I could see his reaction. You\u2019ve got some guts; didn\u2019t think you would go through with it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just following our agreement\u2026\u201d After that, Erica made her wishes. Wishing for a new bank account with an enormous fortune inside. She also wished for a personal pet penguin. Something Grant considered weird since her new fortune could simply buy that. It\u2019s not like it mattered. As long as his client was happy and he was getting paid, it didn\u2019t matter what they wished for.\n\n \n\nRyan Mchandle faded after the wish. Erica dropping his signature broken racket onto the floor as he vanished. Grant picked it up, planning to frame it. What a collector\u2019s item it was. After stuffing it into one of his boxes, he turned to Erica and her penguin, which she named Waddles.\n\n \n\n\u201cSo, happy?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHappier than I could ever be, thank you. Honestly, I thought you were a scam artist or one of those people that steal kidneys.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHah, I can imagine why. I assure you, though. I\u2019m a professional. So, about my fees?\u201d After Grant added in all his imaginary lawyer fees, he ended up with around $200,000. A good payday for a lawyer who had just used his last dime to pay for his ads. After saying his goodbyes, he looked over the room. \u201cGuess it\u2019s time for an upgrade.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.)",

            "comment": "You know, I really couldn't say when I first saw the lines.\n\nI mean, sure, I know it was sometime around my tween years when I saw them for *sure*.  I was 13 when I saw the brightly colored lines cutting straight across the gravel parking lot, leading me back to my parents after I had gotten lost on that road trip.  But before that?  I really couldn't say.  Maybe I had seen them before, mistaking them for pavement lines and supermarket markings.\n\nRegardless.  After I noticed them, I couldn't help it.  I saw them *everywhere*.  Two lines, red and green, etched into the ground like they were marked in paint.  No one else could see them.  I'd commented on them once, to my mother, and she looked at me like I was crazy.  I was old enough at that point to know to keep my mouth shut.\n\nBut I watched, as they wove their way in and out of my life.\n\nAnd, as one does, I inevitably found myself overwhelmed with the *need* to investigate them, to see where they led.  The curiosity was more than I could take.  The memory of that first time was too fresh in my mind, of the green line leading me straight back to safety.\n\nAnd so, when I was 14, I grabbed a botle of water and a snack, and I followed them.  The green line, of course.  Green is good and red is bad, right?  It just seemed smarter that way.  It had taken me on a winding, twisting path, deeper and deeper into the city, until at last I found myself at a robotics tournament being held that afternoon.  \n\nIt was *thrilling*.\n\nI had no idea that something like that was even a thing, but my interest was piqued.  I decided - I wanted to do something like *that* with my life.  And I looked at that little green line with newfound respect.\n\nSo I followed it again.\n\nOver and over, I followed it.  And time after time, my life was rewarded for it.  It took me to the front door of a prep school where I met Mr. Graves, whose tutoring I hold directly responsible for getting me into college a few years down the road.  It led me out of danger, as a kitchen fire burned out of control in my school.  And, it crossed my path with that of the woman of my dreams.  Literally.  We smacked into each other in a crosswalk.\n\nSo, here I was.  I was 30, and the world was at my fingertips.  I sat in my leather gaming chair, in front of the desk holding all of my equipment.  I looked out the window of my top-floor penthouse, gazing down at the city below.  The walls were covered with the awards I had won, in automation and robotics and system design.  My lovely, smart, beautiful wife was in the other room, reading a book as she brewed coffee.\n\nIt was perfect.  Really perfect.  All thanks to that little green line.\n\nBut I couldn't help it.  I was *bored*.  \n\nMy whole adult life, I'd relied on that invisible line to guide my steps.  It hadn't bothered me when I was younger.  I was just a kid, and this line opened doors for me I didn't even know *existed*.  I'd followed it without hesitation, trusting it to take my life where it needed to go.\n\nNow that I was older, now that I had time to stop and think about it, I wondered if this had all really been for the best.  Had I just taken the easy path?  Had I gone with the flow, and given up on taking my life into my own hands?  It kept me up at night, I'll be honest.\n\nAnd through it all, it burned, in the corner of my vision.  That red line.  It seared into my sight like it was on *fire*.  It demanded attention, begging for me to give it the shot I'd only ever given its green brother.\n\nThat old curiosity was back.\n\nAnd so I grabbed an old messenger bag out of the closet, a remnant from my college days.  I threw in bottles of water, and a pocket knife.  A charge cable for my phone, and a granola bar.  I laughed to myself, as I saw it.  It looked so much like the bag I had packed, all those years ago, when I first walked the green line.  But that felt right, you know?\n\nI slipped out the door, with a quick goodbye to my wife.  She accepted my excuses of taking a walk without hesitation, pressing a kiss to my cheek and wishing me a good day.  I smiled to myself, as I left the house.  She was the best thing that the green line had ever gotten me.\n\nAnd then I stepped onto the red line.\n\nOnce again, it led me into the city, deeper and deeper.  But where the green line had taken me straight towards the center of activity, leading me towards schools and conference centers, the red line seemed to be taking me right to the worst part of town.  I flinched away from seedy glares, eyeing my bag and the make of my coat, as I hurried onwards.\n\nI hoped this wasn't going to be the last mistake I ever made.\n\nThe buildings around me loomed higher, the roads and streets giving way to narrow alleys.  I was *about* to give up, to declare this a fool's errand and turn back.\n\nAnd then I heard her crying.\n\n\"Please.  Please, no.  I swear I won't say anything.  I don't have any money, I- I don't have *anything*.  Please just let me go and I swear I won't ever-\"\n\n\"Shut it.\"\n\nThe woman's voice was high, reedy with fear, and her tears threatened to overwhelm her words entirely.  It stopped me in my tracks, before I even had a chance to hear *him* speak.\n\nThe voices were coming from ahead.  The red line burned, inviting me onwards.\n\nAlmost against my will, I found my feet moving fowards.  And then I saw her, huddled on the ground in a mass of scarf and hair.  A man was in front of her, kneeling, with her purse torn open in front of him.  He dug through it, tossing receipts and makeup cases aside carelessly as he looked for anything valuable.\n\nIn his other hand, he held a gun.  It pointed at her lazily, weaving back and forth as he eviscerated the bag.\n\nThey were right there, no more than twenty feet in front of me.  Neither of them saw me.  The man's back was to me, and the woman was in no state to notice.  \n\nMy hand plunged into the bag slung over my shoulder, latching reflexively around the familiar shape of my knife.  I didn't know what I was going to do with it, but having it in my hand made me feel a *little* better.\n\nI needed to call the cops.  This was all wrong.  There was no way I could do anything to help her.  I was just going to end up getting her killed, or myself, or both of us.  He had a *gun*.  What could I *possibly* do against-\n\nHis hand swayed, the barrel pointing back at her.  His finger tensed on the trigger.\n\nBefore I had time to think, I was running.  The knife was out of the bag now, gleaming in my hand as I thrust it towards him.  Towards his neck.  If I could knock him over, if I could get that gun pointed *away* from her-\n\nI swore colorfully as I stumbled.  The man grunted in surprise and pain, as my knife dug into his wrist.  I winced, even as I ran headlong into him.  Turns out my aim with a knife *sucked*.\n\nBut it got the job done.  He fell, cursing and screaming, as blood flowed from his wrist.  The gun clattered to the cold pavement, forgotten, as he stumbled back.  His eyes were locked onto my knife, through the mist of pain I could see in his expression.  \n\n\"What the *fuck*?\"  He cursed again, clutching his wrist.  \"Dude, fuck *off*.\"\n\nI swiped the knife at him clumsily, more threatening than actually intending to hit him.  He swore one last time, jumping back.  \"Fuck this.  Keep your shitty purse, lady.\"  With one last parting jab, he spun on his heel and vanished rapidly down the alleys.\n\nThe woman was a mess, eyes all red and sniffling desperately.  But she pulled herself together as I approached her, beginning to tuck her belongings back into her bag.\n\n\"Are...are you ok, ma'am?\"  I asked tentatively, my voice low.  She glanced up at me, smiling.\n\n\"I am now.  That asshole.  I- I was so *scared*.  Thank you *so* much.  Thank you.  I don't know what would have happened if you-\"  \n\n\"Don't worry about it.  I'm glad I was here.  We should get you to the police.\"  I cut her off before she could go on.  I knew the signs of an incoming meltdown, and figured I needed to get her somewhere safe before her emotions finally caught up with the shock.\n\nShe nodded, accepting my offered hand with a grateful nod, and we stumbled onwards down the alley.\n\nI glanced dowards.\n\nThe red line glowed brightly ahead of us.  My stomach roiled.  *More*?\n\nThe noise of the city was returning to normal around us, as we returned to some semblance of civilization.  I began to relax, just a hair.  And then, as we turned towards the main street, I hesitated.\n\nThe red line was turning, down a different alley.  It led half a block down, and then cut straight up to the front door of a little shack.\n\nI could see a tiny, hazy tendril of smoke, rolling out from under the side door.\n\nThe line *burned*, screaming red in its urgency.  It seared a line into my vision as I looked down the alley.  I paused, caught deep in thoughts.  Questions, that had been lingering in my head for years, and answers that had suddenly become apparent.\n\nThe green line took me where *I* needed to go.  It showed me the easy path.  The path that I needed to take.\n\nWhat if...What if the red line showed me the hard path?  Not the path that I needed, but the path that other people needed me to take?  What if it took me to where other people needed me to go?\n\n\"Can you manage from here?\"  I heard my voice say, ringing distant in my own ears.  The woman glanced back to me, smiling faintly.\n\n\"I think so.  Do you have to go?\"\n\n\"I..I think I do, yeah.\"  I didn't look back at her.  My eyes were still locked onto that little building.  The smoke was growing, swelling by the second.  I half turned, releasing the woman's hand and giving her a reassuring smile.  She returned it shyly, waving as she merged back into the flow of pedestrians and made for the police station.\n\nI turned back to the red line.  And then I broke into a run.\n\n---\n\n(/r/Inorai, critiques always welcome!) \n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Inorai/comments/6vuflx/redline_2/)             ",

Were leaving a gas station in the morning, had slept there in the truck overnight, paused and let an older couple on a trip bike get on the highway ahead of us.  A few hours later we were caught in a 7 hour traffic jam, whole road closed because there had been a fatal accident ahead of us.  Turns out it was that couple, they got hit by a truck and both died.  My dad was really shook up about it, kept wondering if maybe, if he had gone first instead of letting them in, things might have played out differently.  That kind of thing.  I've been involved in a fatal accident through my job.  I've been involved in several near misses that *could* have killed me, if things played out just a little differently.  I can appreciate that most of who lives and who dies is down to chance, and being in just the right place at the right time.  \n\nAaand this conversation has gotten dark XD Sorry for storytime!  Short answer, it wasn't all planned out perfectly when I started writing it, but I think the concept of being led by fate to interact with certain events was always an integral part of the prompt/my response XD \n\n/end rambling!

There are so many great conflicts that you can write about in this scenario. Firstly you can tart with that the red line splits because there are too many people that could use his help. Secondly you can discuss that it because increasingly difficult to choose to follow the red line because it leads him further away from the green line i.e. his wife and his normal life. Thirdly you can write about the psychological burden these lines pose for him. There are multiple options you could explore here. The first one is that he can't get over the fact that he has been selfish for 17 years. Or you could have the conflicts described before drive him nuts. \n\nI really hope you continue this story, it has so much potential. If you need more inspiration or want to discuss ideas please ask me. I'd really like to collaborate. My English and patience are not sufficient to write stories on my own",

I found the main character believable, with clearly realised personality and values. \n\nHe didn't have a sudden change of heart at the end. It was the clear progression of his character from the opening - so not as much a change as a revelation. He had always been something \"more\", he just hadn't been put in a position to realise it yet. \n\nYou make it clear he has a deep rooted need to Do The Right Thing : even when he followed the green line, it's never particularly greedily and he is never satisfied with the easy life. He lists possessions mechanically and doesn't linger on them - he already knows they aren't fulfilling him. He seemed to always be focused on the end results rather than the journey (since of course he's always been handed that) which then all fed beautifully into his willingness to risk himself once he had reason.\n\nTL;DR: His characterisation is consistent through the piece, and there was an excellent escalation through the encounter - you were following an established personality to their logical end, which made his final decision that much stronger. And that's no mean feat in a story this short.",

I can see this as some sci-fi style series where he finds out where the lines come from, how there are more, or only one person who needs to save the world, and as he starts executing the red path a strange person greets him with a connection to the lines, giving him a burning curiosity to follow the red line more often to mee people who know about it.\n\nI love this, I hope you write more parts or write a whole series, I read a book every 2-3 days and I recognize real potential in this story. Can I message you, u/inorai?",

            "comment": "The cave was hidden, far past the roads of the expansive country. The trees and greens shivered in the blowing wind. The wind was in the cave, coming from behind. It echoed monstrous things, like a veil covering the empty dark. The line on the ground entered and disappeared there.\n\n\nHe was old now. He had been old for many years, but he only felt so now. Time was catching up. Each breath made him away of his heaving chest, of his frail bones. His mind dimmed as though from sleep.\n\n\n*One day it will sleep for good.*\n\n\nHe entered the cave. The voices screamed at his passing.\n\n\n*\"Get out!\"*\n\n\n*\"Go!\"*\n\n\nBut he had heard such warnings before. The journey had been years in the doing. Through the fields of Mexico where the grass was short and prickly, to the hardpan country of Middle America. Through the waters of the Atlantic and to the islands of brown and green where the Caribbean lingered. The red line meandered. He wondered if there would be an end.\n\n\n*Yes. This is it. There have been warnings on the way, but this is it.*\n\n\nMuch suffering had occured in his travels. He was left unscathed. But the world was converging on him. He pulled it, as though his clothes were stuck to it. Now he felt naked but it still followed. The wind carried him and he could smell the scents of all life. Everything depended on him.\n\n\nFollowing the red line had caused bad things. The green line which led him to prosperity had been free. Then he had felt detached from the world, sundered and in paradise. Now as he neared the end, he became more and more connected. Each mile brought some misfortune. An earthquake, a hurricane, freak accidents, disease and loss.\n\n\n*I am selfish to continue.*\n\n\nYet he was compelled.\n\n\nThe cave was dark and brown. He heard flowing water amid the echoes. The ground sloped downwards. The line was like afternoon's light, hazy like sand. But he knew it would never go.\n\n\nIt got hotter as he followed. It was black save for his light. There were bats sleeping, but he was past them now. Sweat caked his face. He felt life seeping away which each breath.\n\n\n*I am almost there.*\n\n\nHe wondered what he would see. On the hill he had been disappointed. He thought the green line a joke, but then a harmony had come inside him, and peace had overtaken his world. On the hill everything had been clear and sound. He had built a house there and found a wife.\n\n\n*That was so long ago.*\n\n\nWhen she died he had grieved long and hard. He still grieved. But he did not fault that line. His sorrow had been pure, healthy and human. He missed her, but the memories would never go.\n\n\n*I love you,* he said.\n\n\nHe talked to her often. He had asked her permission to follow the red line. She never responded but he knew she would understand.\n\n\n*I wonder what this line will lead to.*\n\n\nHe knew it would be some misfortune. The world was crying. He was selfish for continuing. But he could not stop.\n\n\n*I will be dead soon.*\n\n\nAnd then he would be with her again. He almost welcomed the misfortune.\n\n\nThe cave led to an opening. There was a pink light here. It was faded, like light upon an afternoon drizzle. The air was humid and a waterfall fell from the ceiling. The red line ended at the dell the water collected in.\n\n\n*It is here then. I wonder what mischief this is.*\n\n\nLike the hill it was not impressive. Somewhere far away, he felt a great sadness. As the world pulled with him, all the people's emotions echoed in his head.\n\n\n*I am sorry,* he thought.\n\n\nHe walked to the waterfall. The natural basin reflected a clear cool water. The line ended inside, distorting in the water.\n\n\n*Drink.*\n\n\nHe knew that would be the end. He thought of his wife. \n\n\n*It is poisoned. I might die slowly and painfully.*\n\n\nHe was afraid of the pain, but not of death.\n\n\n*After the green line, I am not afraid anymore.*\n\n\nHe believed it for the while. He cupped his hands and took some of the water. The voices of the place cried and begged him not to.\n\n\n*The last line gave me a long life and happiness. This should end me sadly.*\n\n\nThen he thought her name.\n\n\n*Elizabeth. I will see you soon Liza.*\n\n\nHe drunk the water and it refreshed him. Like the green line, the red line evaporated, as though it was never there. He blinked and his age was upon him. Death neared ever closer and he was glad. Then that sleepiness that haunted the minds of the old grew greater. He could hardly think.\n\n\n*Liza...*\n\n\nHe blinked. He looked around and a dread came over him. He could not remember what he was thinking about. Who he was thinking about.\n\n\n*I...*\n\n\nHe knew she was important, but he could not place the name. Then he could not see the face in her mind. An emptiness filled him. All love left and he was hollow and old and alone. The cave was silent. He was afraid and was crying. He did not know why he was sad, but the sadness was profound and he sat at the rim of the dell. He put his face in his hands and the water was warm and burned him.\n\n\n*I...*\n\n\nHe felt alone and helpless. Panic took him, but there was no one there.",

There wasn't a lot to remember, I guess.\n\nThen I saw it. Out of the corner of my eye, a splotch of green, like someone painted a glow-in-the-dark line on the asphalt. I turned and stooped down to look at it, and that turn changed my life forever. As I was turning, Eddie Woods, the biggest bully in school, took a swing at me. I leaned down to look at the line, his fist whistled over my head, and he fell in a heap. I stood up to get a better look... and stepped on his glasses.\n\nI didn't even know. Somehow, from that angle, I could see more of the line, smudged on the ground; I started following it, not knowing I had just become a schoolyard hero.\n\nI know it now, of course. I see that green line painted on sidewalks, boardwalks, even splashed across the hands of rich businessmen. They can't see it, but it's lead me to the right places and the right people countless times. I'm barely 22, and I'm already rivaling the Greats of Silicon Valley for material wealth. I'm the media's golden child; in the eyes of the masses, I can do no wrong.\n\nToday, though... it's been exactly ten years since I saw that green line. As little as I remember before that point, I've relished every detail since. And now, well, now I'm curious. See, when that green line showed up, there was another line right next to it. A dusty red line, chalk instead of paint, sketched on the ground. On the best days, I can barely see the red line; on the worst days, it almost seems to glow. But the green line has always been there, and until now... it's been a good life. I've really enjoyed meeting the people it lead me to, seeing the sights, and getting richly rewarded for following along.\n\nBut these days... I'm bored. It's exciting to have a lot of money, but it's not a gamble. I went to Vegas, once, followed the green line, and dropped a quarter into a machine. Ding ding ding, more money for me. Card game? I didn't even know the rules, and I still beat the table. It's no fun if the outcome is a guarantee.\n\nToday, it's time to follow the other line. The red line. Green is good, red is... bad? Well, we'll see. I've talked to my bankers, set aside some money that I can get to even if the rest of my money goes away, and gotten the rest of my affairs in order. Sold my companies, invested the money in schools and charities, all the usual rich guy stuff.\n\nNow it's time to follow the red line.\n\n---\n\n*Test Subject 802-1B-576-X-4 leaving domicile.

            "comment": "We were at Walmart...Dad told me I could pick anything up for my birthday present, thats about the first time I noticed it, there it was.... On the floor a distinct green line and on the opposite side a red line, this one was a little less brighter, it had a very bleak bright to it. \n\nI followed the green line to see where it lead me to, I rapidly chased it from the Toy Section into the book section of the store. There it was waiting for me \"Influence: The psychology of persuasion\"... My first thought was, \"oh well what the actual fuck, some lines appear, Im thinking magic and here i am, it led me to a... a book?\" I figured out whatever so i picked the thing and took it to my dad.\n\n\"What you got there buddy?\"\n\"Here i think this is what i want\"\n\"oh well thats interesting, how do you know about this book?\"\n\"I followed an imaginary green line\"\n\nOf course he never believed me that day on my twelveth birthday, but that green line was a game changer, I read the book and acquired an understanding on how \"influencing people!\" worked, the green line lead me not only in the physical plane but also on the Virtual.\n\nIt took me everywhere, youtube links, apps, websites, stores. It made me buy all sorts of books with valuable knowledge, seemingly making me take and incredibly constructive and positive route.\n\nI woke up one day in the middle of the night, the dark red line was humming, it always had this atmosphere to it. I had never really followed it because the green line always kept me so busy, but today I was too curious, I had done everything the green line hinted me too, this had landed me a decent job, i got a nice car, a house even...but where could the red line take me to?\n\n\nI followed it for the first time... the red line took me to a bench on a hill, and i sat there as it hummed as if it were pleased, the red color finally picked up a much brighter aspect, It had taken me to see the sunset, to be surrounded by nature, and this was the moment i realized the conflict between these lines became clear.\n\nI remeber my green line hinted at a book \"Steppenwolf\" by Herman Hesse, and I think i understood that the green line was my human side, and this red line was my inner wolf. It was the part of me that desired to crumble to my more instinctual self....\n\nThe lines came closer together. They had never done that.\n\nI kept following the red line for a while, it took me on amazing adventures across the world, it incited me to leave my job, sell my house and car and travel with nothing but what was on me. I swam on the red sea, I ate olives in athens, I walked in the harsh cold of Siberia.\n\nThe lines became very close to each other and started forming a third line. This one had a yellowish tint.\n\nI wanted to follow this line, I wasnt to neglect all of the progress made by the green by inmersing myself in the indulgence of self absorbed adventure of the red.\n\nI had found balance.\n\n\nNotice: Im sorry for spelling mistakes. English isnt my first language.\n\n",

            "comment": "Its been over ten years since I started seeing the lines. For the past year, my life had been going downhill. My parents suddenly couldn't seem to stand each other's presence, my school work was going to downhill, and my best friend had moved away about a month ago. For the first week or so, I just tried to ignore them and act like they didn't exist. No one else seemed to see the lines, and if I followed one for a few steps, it would start disappearing behind me. I thought I was going crazy, that it was just some weird hallucination brought on by the stress.\n\nEventually though, the green line was pointing in a direction I was going anyways, so I followed it whether I wanted to or not. A few minutes later, while walking down a sidewalk outside of a ritzy apartment complex, I heard a cry of alarm from above. I looked up and without even realizing what was happening, caught what had to be one of the fattest cats I'd ever seen. Any other cat probably could have landed and been save, but this cat didn't seem like it would have survived the impact. As I was standing there somewhat stunned by what just happened, a harried looking woman ran out of the apartment building and nearly bowled me over. As she stopped to see if I was fine, she noticed the cat still in my arms and breathed a sigh of relief. \"Annabelle survived? Thank god, when I saw her roll out the window I thought  she was dead for sure!\" Still not quite understanding what just happened, I stood there somewhat stunned as she took the cat and bustled back into the apartment complex.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I would find myself following the green line more and more. Every time something good would happen, either for me or for someone else because I was there. I must have saved the lives of two babies, at least one grandma, and a few dogs by the end of the first year. At the same time I was doing better in school, things were better at home, and life was generally great and getting better.\n\nNow, in my mid-twenties I must have saved over fifty human lives and over a hundred pets all while creating an amazing business, meeting the love of my life, and have a wonderful time. Recently though, it had started to get monotonous, and I had occasionally stopped following the green line for a change. While the red line had always been there, I had ignored it for the most part, mostly because it rarely went in the same direction as the green line did for more than a block or two. Today, with my husband away on a business trip and nothing important to do, I decided to follow the red line for the first time. Unlike with the green line, nothing seemed to come of it for a long time. Eventually I found myself in a fairly poor residential neighborhood where a number of kids were playing in the street. The red line lead directly up to one of the kids, a scrawny little girl sitting on the curb watching the others play. I stood in there in confusion for a minute before I noticed the red line had started to fade, and I could barely see it anymore. I looked around in confusion, trying to find the green, only to find it gone from my sight for the first time in a decade. My panic started to mount when I noticed that the girl had begun to look around in confusion as well. Something about the way she was looking around seemed vaguely familiar. Suddenly it hit me, she was looking back and forth at two paths, almost like she was looking at two lines. The lines that I could no longer see. The lines I had somehow handed off to someone who needed them more than me.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m on day 25 of ignoring the lines. \n\nI'm in my office, which is also my home, which is also the penthouse in my main building. By \"my\", I don't mean association, legal possession, or that I wrote my name on the front; I mean unbridled dominance. I've been searching for years to find a single person who doesn't yet answer to me in one way or another.\n\nBoring.\n\n*When I was twelve or thirteen, the green line first appeared. Following this line meant serendipity manifested as wealth, prestige, and undiluted, infinite good luck. That line became my religion.*\n\n\nDay 32\n\nNew experiences no longer exist for me. I've been a world traveler, artist, aristocrat, bum, movie star, TV star, sports star, author, playboy, fuck machine, husband, father, philanthropist, crime boss, astronaut, priest, soldier, anything and everything. All I have to do is follow the green line, and avoid the red line.\n\n*Two lines: one green and one red. I tried following the red line only once. I was fourteen, and curious, and impulsive. I ran into a gang of skinheads and was subjected to the cruelest of beatings. They would have killed me, but my sister intervened. The red line would have had me die by her side. The green line led me to crawl away and get within eyesight of a patrol car. I\u2019m so sorry.* \n\nDay 40\n\nWhy do I feel powerless? I have no master, but am I slave to this line? Its premonitions cut through chaos theory to dictate the path to happiness. I can ignore the lines, as I am doing right now, but they remain. They never leave. Every second I don't follow the green line, I must live with that decision: that my absolute path to happiness is not being followed. \n\n*After the hospital, my green line brought revenge. The skinheads paid with life and limb. Standing over the gang leader\u2019s corpse, my red line pointed at a pay phone, no doubt to turn myself in for my crime. I decided these lines were sentient at that moment; Right then, they were telling me a joke with that ridiculous suggestion, and it was mildly amusing.*\n\nDay 47\n\nWhy am I thinking about that day again? Now I'm staring again at that red line, wondering what stupid plan it's telling me by pointing at my gun safe. The green line points to my running shoes. The lines are telling me a joke again: Go for a run, clear my head, everything will be ok. That's fucking hilarious, because the past thousand runs haven't helped. What is so forbidding about opening my gun safe? \n\n*I stopped asking why I could see the lines after my sister died. All that mattered was: green good, red bad.*\n\nDay 48\n\nI'm actually considering that red line. For the ten thousandth time I remember that my beautiful world is devoid of conflict and negative experience. Whatever I want, I get. Why would I follow the red line? Am I finally going insane? \n\n*After getting famous, I bought the guns for self defense. They came into use in many non-defensive situations, but always without recrimination. Follow the green line, get away with it. Simple.*\n\nDay 49\n\nI'm a prisoner. This penthouse and the building under it and the city surrounding it and the world outside it are my prison. I follow that green line, I stay in this prison. I follow the red line\u2026.\n\n*I was even in the army, just for the experience. Disobeying orders on the battlefield is frowned upon but I outlived my entire platoon, green line style. I lost count of how many strangers I killed; how many strangers I saved. I have a box of medals somewhere. Desertion is also frowned upon but the green line showed me who to bribe, threaten, or kill for an honorable discharge.*\n\nDay 50\n\nWhat's more important: happiness or free will? Is this even happiness anymore?\n\n*I got rich very young, and money lost all meaning. I got to go on dates with my crush and dumped her for boring me. I landed my dream job and quit after a week. I got recognized by so many people I'd never met and I wanted nothing to do with them.*\n\nDay 51\n\nHappiness or free will? \n\n*You shouldn't have even been there. I was taking you to a movie with that money I'd won. If I'd gone alone\u2026 *\n\nDay 52\n\nThe answer is free will. There are 7 people I'm about to shoot in my penthouse. I've summoned them up here. Some of them are friends. Some are begging for their lives. I'm not particularly happy that I'll do it, but it's my choice. Mine. \n\n...The red line draws a circle around me as I pull the trigger over and over. The green line points to the emergency exit staircase, and it\u2019s getting brighter. \n\n...I shoot the police officer that steps out of my elevator. \n\n...The green line is spinning around, unstable like a compass needle that can't find north. Erratic; Urgent. The red circle around me pulses a warm glow. \n\n...Is this free will? Is this what I've been missing?\n\nThe green line almost blinds me as it points at my TV remote. \n\nWell, that's new. \n\nI haven't turned on my TV in a long time and never because the line said so. \n\nHey, look\u2026. I'm on TV. And there's my building, a live image of SWAT and FBI establishing a perimeter. \n\nI suppose I could order my mercenaries to defend the building. The green line seems to think me picking up that red phone on my desk is pretty important right now. \n\n*Why did I walk up to that gang? I saw the danger, but I kept going. I let my sister pay the price. I wanted to trade my life for hers. Where's the path that brings her back? If I'd kept following the red line when I didn't have that money, would she have been there? Would anyone have gotten hurt besides me?*\n\nLook at me, murdering all these people and having the nerve to mourn my dead sister. How about now? Am I crazy yet? \n\nIs this boredom, grief, or insanity? Should I fight this and live my life? \n\nThe red line does something I've seen it do many times before: encouraging me to jump right out that window of my penthouse. Another joke, of course. \n\nThe green line can't decide what it wants me to do anymore. Emergency exit\u2026. phone\u2026 out the window?\n\nWhat?\n\nThe green line is pointing out the window, exactly the same as the red line. \n\n\nSo that\u2019s it, then\u2026. I wasted my time and ignored my escapes and now my best path and worst path are one and the same: out that goddamn window. \n\nThe red phone rings. It's a police negotiator demanding my surrender. I politely decline. I'm the guy who can't even find happiness with fate bending to my will--Prison won't fix that. \n\nI hang up and shoot out the window. With no ceremony, I drop my gun and sprint toward the red and green lines, and the amazing plunge that awaits. No, I'm not crazy; I've just run out of things to do.\n",

            "comment": "The green line has given me purpose since the age of twelve. It led me to choose the right college, right degree, and find the woman of my dreams. After following the green line for 10 years, I will getting married in May next year, I just started medical school, graduated college with a 4.0 gpa, etc. The green line doesn't just point me to where I should go. It points me to the right answers on tests, everything. People think I'm a genius l, but in reality, I dont even have to think. \nThe first 7 or so years were fun, but the complete lack of adversity or stakes has made everything boring. Imagine playing a videogame where you can never lose, or poker where you can see everyone else's hand, but they can't see yours. That's my life as of now. I always assumed the red line was the opposite of the green line. They didnt always point in opposite directions, but the only time I could think of them ever lining up together perfectly was a couple times I was fishing with friends, or at the beach at my local lake growing up. One thing I've noticed though, While the green line doesnt waiver all that much, the red line will sometimes jump to seemingly random points. \nLife is so boring at this point, I might as well follow it for a day, and see what happens. Can't screw up what I've achieved to this point too much, right? As I follow the red line for a few minutes, I'm lead to a quant little pond with a beautiful garden, and a  couple ducks gently floating along the water. After watching the ducks for a few minutes, they fly off. The red line remains pointing at the pond for a couple more minutes, then jumps to a new direction. Again after following it for two or so minutes, I'm lead to a road. The only notable thing about the road, at this point in time, is that a mother duck is leading her ducklings accross the street. \nI think I'm beginning to notice a trend. I walk away the red line remains pointing in the direction I left from a few minutes ago. It jumps to a new direction, that I then follow. Sure enough, I am lead to a group of ducks. I do this several more times, and every time, I'm lead to a group of ducks. I guess I was wrong. Green line is the path in life I should follow, red line is fucking ducks. \nThanks for reading. I hope you like the take I took on this prompt. ",

            "comment": "Green for go, red for stop. The rules applied as always, and as a normal, non-colour blind individual, I followed the soothing colour of nature as it led me to prosperity. The green line directed me away from the train station when there was an anarchist bombing. The green line led me to the office where I would eventually be employed at. The green line even told me when people were coming to foil my plans of burglary, during my period of poverty. But I'd always paid so much attention to my saviour that the other, more striking line never surprised me as it did now. Always, the bright red directly contradicted the light green, leading to an obvious conclusion. The red line must be a curse! The green line was the authentic life-saver.\n\nBut now...now it was different. If the red line was always wrong and the green line was always right...then *why were the two leading to the same place?* I looked forward, then at my feet, where the contrasting colours mixed to form a near-straight line. Undoubtedly, they ended at the same place. But the red line always signified the wrong choice!\n\nScrew it, I thought. I'd lived in comfort for decades since I'd discovered my power. The small mistake I might commit wouldn't mean anything. I stormed right in, and the lights within temporarily blinded me. But my eyes instantly focused on someone in the room. Someone I knew. \n\n\"Don't do it!\" I shouted, staring at the gun in my friend's hand. If I'd been a second later...I shuddered. But his expression stood steadfast in defiance as the weapon was pointed at his skull. \"I've nothing left to live for. Not even you,\" he spat, the words breaking my very heart though I knew he didn't mean it. I grabbed the pistol, where the green line and the red line led to. In an instant, it clattered to the floor, as my friend fixed a steely gaze on me. \n\n\"I'm not worth saving,\" he said, his eyes beginning to tear. \"Even my school of choice doesn't want me. I'd tried twice, but I was too worthless to enter. What for do I live?\" I was stunned, his words robbing mine out of my mouth. It was true. What did he have to live for beside art? Then it hit me.\n\n\"Hitler, live for your country! It technically isn't your birth country, but you love it all the same. Protect it with your life,\" I advised, sayig whatever I could to diffuse the volatile explosive before me. His gaze drooped, and his eyes looked wistfully on. \"For Germany...\" he whispered, his voice crackling with excitement and patriotism. Screaming his country's name, he rushed out of the house, his gun left behind. The green and red lines still pointed towards the life I'd saved. Adolf was always my best friend, and his life was as much to him as it was to me. I smiled, though I still didn't understand one thing.\n\nWhy was the red line there?\n\nEdit: Fixed a couple of plot holes! Thanks to /u/glylittleduckling and /u/CarlHenderson",

            "comment": "It's been ten years, and everything has gone my way. I graduated university with top marks, work at my dream job, and will soon be married to the best girl ever. All because of a little green line. \n\nYou see, following the green line keeps me safe. I never do the irrational or dangerous activities, so I never experience negative consequences. Life is good.\n\nBut borrrring. I want to have adventure! Not just sit around all day, getting fat and happy.\n\nSo as I leave work on that Friday night, I stop focusing on the green line. The red comes into view. \n\nGreen tells me to turn right as I drive out of the parking garage. That'll take me home, where I'll wait for an hour for Jennifer to arrive- she always works late Fridays.\n\nRed tells me to turn left, so I do. After a couple blocks of office buildings, the line makes a turn on the freeway, but North instead of South.\n\nRather than take me to my condo in downtown, it takes me to... where? I pass multiple bars, stripclubs, and auto parts stores with no sign of the line even moving. Finally, I'm directed to veer off the freeway, to arrive at the most adventuresome and risky... Home Depot.\n\nMy confusion is heightened when I'm apparently told to buy a five gallon drum of gasoline and a match box.\n\n\"Need to start a fire?\" The cashier jokingly asks.\n\n\"Matches are for a fire, but the gasoline is for my cousins electric generator at his cabin.\" Idiot, he won't believe that. But he's not saying anything more, and now Red is telling me to drive further from the interstate, and into the Suburbian Jungle.\n\nSeveral streets and a couple turns later sees me pulling up in front of a ranch-style home that the years since the 80's haven't been kind to. I barely have time to look before Red slips under the side gate. \n\nGreen curves in my vision, twisting and pulling, before spelling out, \"TURN AROUND.\" Green has nice cursive.\n\nMy hands find the latch, I step through, into the yard. Red leads up to a window, and I peer through. \n\nGreen vanishes completely, evidently collapsing into a catatonic state. Red marches me back to the car, where I pick up the gasoline, applying liberal amounts to the front of the house. One match later, and the structure burns.\n\nI'd like to see the look on Jennifer's face as she notices me standing outside, but Red is telling me to drive.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nIt's been three years, and with multiple felonies under my belt, it's safe to say I know what Red does.\n\nGreen gives me a safe, comfortable life, but one where I am never in danger, threat, or peril of any kind.\n\nRed puts me into the worst possible situation, then relies on me to clean it up. I've had to bounce back and forth between the two, as depending solely on Red gets me captured and in prison.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to follow Red.\n",

Inside.\n\nDepressed. \n\nI felt a black hole inside myself, feasting on my everlasting success for years. I hardly rememberd where I actually started from. All I knew was there were two lines, a green, which I followed blindly ever since it helped me score with the girl I used to like back when I was twelve, and a red one, which I never trusted. \n\nNow, the green line gave me everything. Things that I didn't even knew I wanted, nor needed, some of them I didn't even know they exist. But they exist, just like everything I own, and all of the things that I own and have done combined could not fill the hole they produced...\n\nBut the red line... Once I saw it's entire length, as it was rather short. Didn't follow it couse it would take me straight into a car crash. Never trusted it since. I saw it as the devil's line. \n\nBut then I thought, fuck it. I've done everything, seen everything, achieved everything that was good for me. But never the bad things. That's why the green line was my curse. Nothing but success renders life rather pointless. So, again, fuck it. That day, as I climbed down from Mt. Everest, I followed the red line. \n\nIt took me back to our mountain camp, then the second one, then the third one. Took me straight down from the mountain, to the dirt road going back to Kathmandu. At Kathmandu, it took me to the airport, where it took me on a flight to Shanghai. \n\nWhen I got off the plane there, the red line took me straight to McDonald's. Never ate there before. \n\nI just had my fourth pacemaker installed today.  ",

I feel like I'm living the most linear rpg, quest waypoints included. It directed my mouse to trade stocks, my car where to drive, hell it even had me crash my bike on a missing bag of money from a heist when I was 12. I'll never forget that day, there was a massive amount of life lost trying to relieve the treasury of its soon to be shredded bills. Did I feel a bit bad? Sure, but 500k buys a lot of happiness. Green got me to the top, but I was alone here. Friends get sick of your inability to fail, and women come and go, and I was sick of it all but as I took the revolver out of my mouth I realized that red line had grown almost twice the size, pulsing with my heart beat. There was at least one thing left more me to do. \nAs I walked with the red line it swirled around me, my wrinkles faded, I got lighter on my feet, and my gait turned to a pedal.\n\"Holy shit\"\nIt was all I could muster to say, and quite a foul line for a newfound 12 year old about to find out he sees lines on the ground. There it was, trusty green, and blood red. \nI followed the red line with fervor, dreaming of what I might find. But it was just taking me the long way around to the treasury in Richmond. \nAnd that's where it stopped, in front of three masked men driving a van, armed to the teeth. I reach for my cell, realizing it's the 90s and I'm 12, it was pretty fruitless... \n\"How do I stop this?\" \nThe red line pulsed at the van, I was lance with both testicles pedaling furiously in it's direction. I felt my body crumple into it damaging the side panel, people clamoring for help, screaming for the police.\nThe driver didn't like that much, they sped away as I blacked out.\nI woke up to the news, no heist, no dead police....\nIt all started with a bike crash....\n\n\n**I don't write... ever... sorry If it sucks!

Wealth, contentment, and opportunity had followed in the wake of my devotion to its ceaseless lead. But ultimately the green line offered boredom and an unquenchable thirst and curiosity. \n\nI stepped away from it, determined to never follow it as long as I drew breath. The red line diverged ahead, winding off into some undefinable unknown. The first step was liberating, but perhaps that was not due to the nature of the line itself, but my own conditions. The next step had me meet with a large truck, seemingly out of nowhere. It struck me full on my front, launching me ten billion feet into the air where a herd of snow geese pummeled and tore at me. I began to fall, my flesh hanging from my bones in tatters. A plane flew toward me and I was devoured by one of its engines. Instantly, I was vaporized in a searing ball of flame. Fuck the red line.

After saying goodbye to your loving wife and children who would soon be dropped off at daycare in downtown near your office. The lines seems to have become just another part of your daily life, hardly noticing them but still aware of both. Today the green is to the right and the red, conversely, to the left. You've lived an incredible life, every thing always comes down to the direction of these lines. Today they have seemed to switch places. \"The green always goes left\", you think to yourself. You're so used to going left that you hardly think anything could be different if you chose to continue going left.\n\nLeaving your house and walking as you had infinite times before by turning left, walking further down the street toward your favorite coffee shop and the red line continues past it. You always have gone in the coffee shop everyday prior, but you guess a little change couldn't hurt. Continuing down the red line you start feeling a little anxious, this really hasn't followed much of the same routine that you're used to. By this time the green line would have had you at your office talking with your secretary about messages left for you. But now you're just standing at a bus stop on the other side of town.\n\nAs the bus pulls up to the curb you check to see where exactly it will take you, luckily it seems that the red line has decided that you should go to the office, seeing as the sign in bright LED reads \"downtown\". You stay on the bus for 30 minutes or so as you pass by various ways of life. A school yard with children running and playing, thinking to yourself that life felt like it had the speed of molasses at that age, you envied them but still felt so happy that your children could experience this kind of temperament and quality of life. Continuing through streets with what looked like a farmers markets lined through and through. All those times your wife and you would walk endlessly through their maze of never ending storefronts with smiles and laughter seemingly just as endless as the time itself in those moments. But all the while on the green line, never taking a foot off of it but seemingly never having to, it always took you exactly where you needed to be. \n\nLifting your head out of deep thought you noticed your stop was coming up. The red line was waiting for you as you get off. Walking closer to the office now the red line wants you to cross the street even though the threshold of the office was only feet ahead of you. You decided you don't need a line to make decisions for you any longer and as your right foot steps off the red line you feel free for the first time, the weight of the lines had been lifted. You turn to go inside the office as a large man exiting your office with a gun runs into you. He was mid stride and running from security, he takes one look and you and fires.\n\nYou lie on the ground as the world around you seems to be getting colder, darker, and as your eyes become to heavy to keep open you can see the red line across the street leading into a daycare.

            "comment": "Everyone has seen \"The Wizard of Oz\", right? As the Munchkins said, \"follow the yellow brick road!\", so I lived my life. Though the road I followed was neither yellow, brick, nor visible to anyone but myself. I saw the lines for the first time at the age of twelve. They appeared, almost at random, as I was walking on the way home from school. One green line, leading off into one direction, and a red line going off into another. The red line was an indescribably harsh, violent shade of red, while the green line was soft and inviting like a crisp field of grass. Naturally, I followed the green line. \n\nAt first, the green's rewards were small blessings. The first thing the line led me to was a dollar bill lying on the ground. After that, numerous mundane conveniences that I can't much recall. What I will never forget, is about 6 months after the lines started to guide my life, I was walking with my father. I noticed the green line veer into a nearby alleyway. I urged my dad to come with me, though I couldn't explain why. He was annoyed with me at first, but that all changed when he saw the animal lying on its side near the back of the alley, barely breathing. A small golden retriever pup, a stray that had gotten into a fight with some other animal. Dad and I hurried it to the nearest vet. I remember how surprised dad was at the fact that I knew the exact way to the clinic. He never knew I had a little help. That puppy would make a full recovery and become our loyal family dog. Mom and dad let me name it, and I chose St. Patrick. I told them it was because he was lucky we found him. Though we often shortened his name to \"Patter\" due to his habit of patting the ground with his front paws whenever he wanted attention.\n\nYears went on, and the green line's rewards continued to grow exponentially, as did its influence on my life. I noticed one day that people who would help me would be surrounded by a green aura, while those who were no good for me had red. I learned that the hard way when I agreed to go on a date with a girl I liked in college, despite her crimson aura. Things seemed fine at first, as they usually do, only to result in one of the ugliest breakups of my life. She took my car, kicked me out of our apartment, and had Patter put to sleep as some form of retribution against me. It was then I theorized that as the rewards of the green line increase in greatness, the punishments of the red line increase equally so. At that point, I dubbed the lines \"Karmic paths\". \n\nAfter the mishap with that girl, the green path must have thought I needed even more help. I began to see red and green words whenever I read any documents printed or digital. As I listened to people speak, I could \"hear\" the redness or the greenness of their words. I became a walking lie detector. I decided to put this into good use. I immediately downloaded a video game off the internet, and began to read through the EULA. I could see, plain as day, the parts that were written simply as standard practice, and the fine print put there to prey on the buyer. \n\nThe green path continued to lead me in this way for many more years. I decided to reap the benefits of this perceptiveness and start playing the stock market. That is how I made my fortune. I decided to spend my newfound wealth on a night out for my friends and I, which is how I met my wife at a nearby club. For a long time, things were great! I lived comfortably, loved abundantly, and hadn't a care in the world! That is, until the hue changed...\n\nI noticed the once vibrant green hue surrounding my best friend suddenly change to a harsh red overnight. I was dumbfounded. He was practically a brother to me, how could he do me any wrong? I continued the conversation as normally as I could, when eventually I mentioned my wife. The red around him grew more intense. The sense of dread this gave me tied my guts into knots. I choked out the words the best I could. \"Would you like to have dinner with us tonight?\" Never before has the word \"yes\" sounded so... red to me. \n\nWhen I arrived home later that night I saw what I feared most: an oppressive, red aura surrounding my wife. We exchanged the normal pleasantries, the \"welcome home!\" and the \"how was work?\", et cetera et cetera. I quickly shut myself up in my office and started thinking. How could things end up this way? I had followed the green path faithfully for decades! Why would it wrong me now? What can I do? Then I saw it. Convergence. The green path and the red path, perfectly perpendicular to each other. Tracing them with my eyes from my feet, across the room, and out the window of my top floor office. There they ended, together. I got up from my desk and followed them, until I was upon the window overlooking the tranquil city streets. I heard the ding of the elevator as it reached our floor. I heard my best friend and wife greet each other, then whisper something between themselves. I looked at the outstretched paths of red and green scaling the tower I had built with my choices lead downwards. I opened the window and took that last step on my path. I spent so much time enjoying the boon of the green path that I forgot the thing that remains true for both fortune and misfortune.\n\nThis too, shall pass.",

            "comment": "One day at age twelve I started to see the lines.At the school dance 2 girls asked me to dance May and Lisa. The green one lead to May,known for being rough basket case and Lisa the pastors daughter. \n\nI followed the green line because Green was my favorite color and let my friend Bobby dance with Lisa. My time with May was amazing, we loved similar things and the things she brought into my life only enhanced it.\n\nLisa it turned out had been a compulsive liar and last I heard from her was the invitation to a shotgun marriage to Bobby who had been assured she was on the pill. \n\nFrom that day on I always followed the green line. Down any street, through any building and to any person it seemed to point, and every time it's brought me nothing but joy. However it had been 10 years since the dance and...well...life had gotten boring.\n\nNot to say it's been unpleasant, oh no! Every day is pleasant it's wonderful. I succeed in every undertaking and gain every chance I need. The guidance the green line has given me is invaluable, but there are no surprises anymore. So that's why today I had decided to follow the red line.\n\nI figured even if it lead me into a jam the green line could lead me back out. I was on my guard keeping an eye out for danger. In fact I had my eyes everywhere except for right in front of me, which is why I ran head long into a fire escape ladder.\n\nI woke up hours later in the hospital. The doctor said I only had a slight concussion, but I knew how much damage I truly had when I opened my eyes. The lines were gone. I don't know why they chose now to disappear, if they had always been delusions, but they were gone.\n\nFor a moment, I felt this intense joy. The world had suddenly become vast and unpredictable like a brand new adventure had started, but that feeling quickly vanished. The nurse had asked a benign question \"Jello or Brownie?\" but as I stared at the choices a sense of dread came over me a paranoia created from years of following something else that might never come back. \n\nWhich would I like more? Would one make make me sick? What if I'm allergic to one of them? I've never had to worry about allergies before! It was than I realized how much of a mistake I had made. I had never made a choice for myself since I was 12 years old. Even small ones like this felt like insurmountable obstacles.\n\nSo now I set here staring at 2 sugary treats and wonder what will become of me. What will the future hold? How will I live without my guide? Can I live without it? Please, someone please tell me.",

            "comment": "On occasion, Henry would awake in a cold sweat in the middle of the night. The dreams were always the same; the fear always unchanging. As a young kid, awaking in a bed that was not his; as a young man waking next to his wife; as an old man waking alone. Henry would forever live in fear of the day he would awake without a green line dotted along his bedroom floor. \n\n  \"*The red line*\",Henry thought \"*I could take or leave*.\" He had only once had the idea to follow it, but it was fleeting and disappeared as quickly as it came. The green line, his trustworthy old friend, had lead him to everything he wanted in life.\n     \n  When Henry was 13 it pushed him directly to the answers of his algebra test, right there on the classroom floor. When he was 17, it directed him towards the girl he would ask eventually ask to prom, and later to marry him. 21, it saved him from walking right into a live grenade in Vietnam. At 25, the dotted fluorescent stripe drove him to the bank where he would work for the rest of his life, and then to every promotion and advancement afterword. It was an easy life; a quiet life. \n\n  '*But what if?*' The voice inside Henry's head asked one morning over tea. Retired, wife dead; everyday had become the same monotonous routine. '*Was there even a point in following the green line anymore?*', he continued asking himself. Henry made the choice to finish his now lukewarm tea and see where the bright stop-sign colored stripe took him that day. \n\n   At first it wasn't so bad. His first stop was a coffee shop on the east side of town, a place called '*nowhere land coffee.'* \"*What an odd name for a coffee shop, but fitting for the day.\"* Henry thought as he followed his new red friend into the bricked building. \n\n  '*What can I get you?*' His waitress had a name tag that said 'ALICE' in bold white letters. Henry ordered his coffee to go, not being an avid coffee drinker anyways and eager to see where the rest of the day took him.       \n\n  Henry took a pause as he saw where the next red line ended. It ended...abruptly. In the middle of the street. '*How strange, but that is what this day is about!'* Old man Henry exclaimed, getting into the spirit of the day. A very giddy Henry bounced, or as much as a 70 year man can bounce, into the street and paused. And stood. Waiting for the next thing, ignoring the cars coming, ignoring the taxi hailing to him. The red line was going to save him, just as the green line had been saving him his whole life. \n\n \n\n \"*He will wake up soon, but I have to worn you he hit his head very hard, there will likely be complications.*\", Henry could overhear his doctor telling someone that he couldn't see. He popped his eyes open to examine which one of his 7 grandchildren had come to this hospital to see him. \n\n  In a horror filled moment, Henry realized he couldn't get his eyes to open. No, they were open. The cold sweat began the same as always, only this time he would not awake. *And he would never see another green line again.*",

            "comment": "   The red line, it always laid there taunting me.  I've spent nights awake thinking of it.\n\n    I started seeing the lines when I was young, I was around twelve or thirteen, just hitting that wonderful stage of rebellion. I asked my mom about them, she hesitated. She asked what color lines I received.  Everyone get different colors, different paths, but you choose on your own and nobody can tell you which is right.\n    As I sit in this office looking down at the people walking below, I know I chosea good path, but did I choose \"The Right One\"? Sure I have money, a great job, big house, too many cars, but the boredom is killing me.\n    I kept feeling the red line calling me, asking me to try the other side.  In the last week the call was becoming louder and the line was darkening.  Today it was a deep burgundy. Today I decided to shift from green to red, I stepped towards the red line and as I did the green line went to a bright lime green almost as a warning.  I could feel the red line under me with every step I took and watched the green line fade.\n     I continued walking forward and found myself in complete white. No ground below, no sky above. I continued to walk until there was a doorway, I walked through wondering what I got myself into.  The room was bright and cheerful, painting of beautiful landscapes on the walls and plush leather couches. The lady at the desk handed me a computer and told me to take a set and handed me a small index card. I read the card\n\n WELCOME TO THE AFTERLIFE.  \nYOU SURVIVED EARTH FOR 32 YEARS. \nYOU ARE GIVEN TWO PATHS: LIFE OR DEATH.\n",

I don't remember anymore why I began following the red line, maybe I was bored, or maybe I was jaded by success. The green line seemed such a distant memory now, a relic of another life. Years had passed since I let curiosity getthe best of me and my life turned completely upside down. I had grown violent in my addiction my accounts drained as fast as the bottles i left in a scattered mess strewn around my home, and my life full of needles chasing a red line in my arm much the same as I followed this one. 5 years were a blur in my mind up to now, and the weight of the gun in my hand felt like a stone around my neck. I heard the sirens aproaching and snapped out of it. Looking at the ground, i saw two lines once again: the red line leading away and the black line. No going back. I followed the black line into the alley across the blood soaked plaza to it's end. At the terminus, I heard rapid footsteps approach and understood. The black line led me to the end. \"Drop the weapon!\" \"Drop it!\". I couldn't. I was compelled. I lifted the weapon to my own temple as the black line grew until it was all that was left...",

After soaking it all in and feeling quite pleased with myself for awhile, boredom slowly crept in.\n\nI started glancing at the red line and wondering its destination. I resolved to follow it to the end as the green line had helped me so much. Standing and taking the first few steps reminded me of being twelve and first choosing the green line.

            "comment": "Success and happiness....some say those things come hand in hand. In my case they do all my life I have followed the rules of society and it has paid off in a big way. I went to college, graduated, and then began my career which paid me real well. I even met my fiance from my work. As a 25 year old with my health, career and social life intact I have been ahead of the curb and it was all thanks to me following the green line that appeared when I became a teenager.\n\nYou see in my society when a person reaches a certain age they see a green and red line. Once a you see this you are not considered a child  any longer as you must make the decision to follow the one of the paths for your by these lines. In my society the green line has been set up to guarantee success and happiness.  The red line on the other hand, well the red line guarantees nothing of that sort. \n\nYou must think with these 2 options it would be easy to choose the green line, and it is for a majority of people in my society. But for a few they are very tempted to take the red line, as they get off on the excitement of the unknown. Unfortunately those that have taken the red line have almost always regretted it according to what my parents, teachers, and friends told me all through my life, making sure I would choose wisely and pick the green line. It also helped to see what happened to friend Darren.\n\nDarren was the kid who would always question everything and everyone. He was the kid that would get himself into trouble doing things he was not suppose to do. However he was a kind person with the flaw of finding himself in tough situations far before the red line. Maybe cause his parents had followed the line and he came from a broken home.  All these things in Darren's young life led him to jump right on the path of the red line. We lost touch as we grew up and last I heard he was a drug addict with quite the criminal wrap sheet.\n\nHowever the curiosity of the red line has always been with me. I was suspicious as to why so many people, especially ones I looked up to told me the red line was bad considering they themselves have always followed the greened line. I would tell myself that Darren was a failure because of circumstances before seeing the green or red line.\n\nUp until this point my life been perfect and I am happy, why would I screw that up?  One day as I was leaving the office I made the split second decision to make the \u201cjump\u201d and see where the red line led me too. At first when it diverged from the green line I drove through a part of town that I never had been through before. Many abandoned homes, and poverty was rampant in this area. None the less I continued to follow the red line. Eventually I realized the red lined re-merged with the green line and it lead my back to my home where my beautiful fiance was.\n\nAs I pulled up to my garage I sat there laughing hysterically, thinking all this time my curiosity was about that red line but it led me back to where I am. As I awoke to go to work the next day I pretty much had forgotten all about my curiosity of the red line since nothing different happened....or so I thought. As I went into work the CEO of my company set up a meeting and blind sided half of the company by announcing they would have to layoff half the employees including myself. I was devastated. My career/job was my identity. I felt crushed, and so I made my way back home.\n\nAs I went home and told my fiance the news, something changed in her demeanor. She went from a supportive loving partner whom I thought would be understanding to showing a real nasty side of her. She was more upset of what her friends and family would think now that I lost my job. She was upset she couldn't have the standard living we became accustomed to having. I tried to calm her down telling her I would find another job that pays well but in her eyes I was a failure. And deep down I knew I was a failure as well since I had never failed at anything in my life.\n\nOver the next few weeks I was around the house more and began to see things in my fiance that made here really really ugly to me. Like the way she reacted to the news of my layoff, the way she would expect me to do everything for here, how she talked down on me. I realized she had always been this way to me but I was engulfed with my own success and what I thought was happiness that I chose to overlook these negative qualities of hers. I also realized while interviewing for a new job in my field that I really didn't like the type of work I did for a living. Sure it paid well but it was not the type of job I could longer see myself doing another 30 years. \n\nThen it hit me like a ton of bricks, I came to realize that on that day,  where I decided to follow the red line my life did shift. All this time I was expecting the path to take me on a different route physically, however it was actually a shift in things in my current life.  I realized that even though I still see the red and green lines, that the further I looked unlike the other times, the lines don't diverged and that they run parallel together as far as the eye can see. \n\nAs the months went by my fiance left me, I couldn't get rehired in my field of work as if potential employers sensed there was no passion behind my words during interviews, resulting in my becoming homeless. It was a living hell and I had regretted taking the red line. I thought there was no way out it. Living in my car, depressed and feeling hopeless I started to have suicidal thoughts.\n\nThese thoughts got the best of me and I was ready to go through with it until I ran into an old friend. Yes it was Darren! It was a bitter sweet reunion because I was at my lowest point and somehow Darren looked very happy and content with his life. As I spoke with him he said he was also at the point of hopelessness many times after failing at the simple things in life. However the one thing he said that helped him the most was he never accepted failure and no matter hopeless he was, he never saw taking his life as an option. Old successful, \u201chappy\u201d me would have viewed Darren as beneath me had I ran into him, since he wasn't financially well off and was single himself with no family.  But what I noticed Darren had was that he was happy, genuinely happy.  \n\nNo matter how hard life hit Darren he learned to callous his brain, to be mentally tougher and find his own solitude by helping himself.  He told me that the red line is what helped him gain this perspective in life. He had no regrets taking the red line because the path of the unknown brought him many happy times as well as unhappy ones. He said the green line is a social construct of our society telling us what \u201csuccess\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d is. Those two things are subjective to the individual, that only once we experience the other side of feeling unsuccessful or being unhappy is when we truly know what being successful and happy really is. \n\nAfter he told me that I started to change my perspective on things. Realizing that as bad as things were, my mind and life were actually freer than ever on the red path as I could experience the wide possibilities life has to offer. And from that point forward the good times I have had have made me realize what true happiness feels like since I could compare it to the bad times I have had. I have also grown to be more compassionate, empathetic and non judgmental towards other people who I would previously look at with pity and disgust.  In hind-site I realized that I was never really successful and happy following the green line, but rather I was following a heard mentality and  my happiness was actually arrogance and stubborness to see things for the way they really were",

            "comment": "It was obvious that the green line was good, and the red line bad. When it first appeared, the green line \nwas going to my family or school, and the red one right into traffic. Any curiosity soon disappeared, the line\nwould just lead me to my death. Walking along a street was like being an invisible broken clock; one hand leading straight, the other jumping wildly back and forth as the cars flew by.\n\nAt first I assumed everyone could see the line, but when I tried to tell my family about it I just got concerned looks. Not only did they not see my line, nobody else had lines of their own. Or maybe they did, but refused to talk about it. My teenage years were confused, but one thing was certain: if anyone could see any lines, they were taboo.\n\nWhen I started high school, I felt that my green line was broken for many months. Every free period, it would always lead to _her_, and we did not get along at all. I didnt like her, had no reason to believe she liked me, and I knew exactly where I wanted the green line to go. \n\nIt didn't end well. Heartbroken and furious, the green line lighting up like an unbroken insult, I decided to see where the red line lead. It too, had stabilized.\n\nThats when I realized how sinister the red line really was.\nI followed it carefully, alone, figuring it was safe as long I could see the line go on and on until it was out of sight. Eventually it lead me to a footbridge over a highway, and it became clear why the line has passed over so many stones on the way. As traffic passed, the red line would hone in on the semi-trailers, urging me to jump of the railing in just the right time to cause as much destruction and misery as possible. This footbridge seemed to be my limit of destructive capabilities.\n\nBack at school the day after, I shared a class with the girl; the green light leading to the chair next to her, the red out the door. Sitting towards the back and looking out the window I could see the red line across the school yard, finding the shortest path to the footbridge. To tell the truth, I had become dependent on the green line, and I blamed her for how miserable I was without it. I stared at the back of head, _hated_ her, and then the red and green lines joined into an intense, ugly brown color right towards her. I flinched in shock; and the lines came apart. \n\nNot long after, I caved, and of course the green line was right. For such a long time I was happy.\n\nMy daughter screamed at me from her crib, and I wanted to scream right back at her. Sometimes the green line didn't lead to her, but out of the house. Fuck the green line. And then they joined again, and I cried.\n\nShe's a teenager now, and I tell her that it's the choices you make when things are the hardest that matter the most. \"OK, dad\", she says with a smile, sweet and innocent. This summer she left for college, leaving her old man prouder and sadder then she could possibly imagine.\n\nThe green line has worked to my benefit the past 18 years, and I no longer have to work for a living. For the same 18 years, ever since that fateful night, the red line has pointed east. Not out the door, but straight through the wall. On a business trip to London, it shifted slowly to the south, across Europe towards Turkey.\n\nAnd as I've grown older, I've also grown scared, because if anyone can throw stones at cars, then surely anyone can unleash that terror that hides somewhere in Eastern Europe.\n\nThis is the journal of my journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

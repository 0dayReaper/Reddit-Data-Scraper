            "comment": "Obama slowly lowers the letter as a drop of sweat starts to slide down his forehead, his heart pounding.\n\n\"Michelle.\" He says. \"I have to step out for a minute. I'll be right back, you can go back to sleep.\" She mumbled something in return, but it wasn't coherent enough to understand.\n\nObama walks outside with his phone and the letter, and begins to dial the number. Before he types the last digit, he shuts his phone off and grabs his head with both hands in stress. This call could mean anything, after all. Obama paces back and forth while alternating rubbing his sweaty hands together and wiping the sweat off his forehead, as he smokes a cigarette he lit to help with stress. When the cigarette burns out he tosses it to the ground, steps on it to extinguish the flame, and tells himself simply \"you can do this Barack. You were the president of the United States, for gods sake. TWICE.\" With that, he picked up the phone.\n\n\"Hello Barack.\" A voice said, before Obama had even said anything. \"We've been expecting your call.\" \n\n\"Who is this?\" Obama sternly asked. \n\n\"As the letter said, this is JFK. We have a job for you. Meet us on the corner of East and Third at 0300 hours Tuesday of next week. Come alone, and tell no one what you're doing. Tell no one about this call. Tell no one about the letter. We will know if you talk. Do not talk.\"\n\n\"B-but wait...\" Obama stuttered. \"Next Tuesday is my wife's birthday...\" \n\n\"We are aware of that, Barack. Sacrifices have to be made in order to succeed.\" Replied the strange voice. Whoever it is was, they were definitely using a voice changer. Obama started to think, and he couldn't even tell if he had been talking to a man or a woman.\n\nDays pass. Obama stressed uncontrollably over this, worried about what might happen, and worried more about how his wife would feel if he for any reason missed her birthday. He had no choice, though. He had to go to that meeting, to discover what this was all about.\n\nThe time has come.\n\nObama slowly walks to the stop sign on the corner of East and Third, at 0300 hours, on the correct day. Everything was as he was told. He received another call.\n\n\"Barack.\" The voice said. \"Do not move. Do not make a sound. Do not even lower the phone from your face.\" Before Obama could ask why, he noticed multiple bright dots shimmering on his body. Snipers, no doubt. Obama didn't dare move. For two whole hours he was forced to sit like this.\n\nAt the dawn of the third hour, the lasers disappeared. A black unmarked car drove up to where he was sitting. He heard a voice that told him to approach the vehicle, but to not get in.\n\nObama walked up to the window, and stuff waiting for what might happen next.\n\n\n\nThe window rolled down.\n\n\n\n\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!\" laughed Biden. \"You should have seen all the faces you made! Oh and how stressed you looked! You seemed like you were gonna have a heart attack! HAHAHAHAHA!\"\n\n\"Joe?\" Replied Obama, angrily. \"I don't understand. Explain, now.\"\n\n\"Easy, easy.\" Said Biden. \"It was just a prank bro! Just a little joke! You know. Leave a mystery letter, give out mysterious instructions, have you sit in an uncomfortable posture for THREE HOURS. IT WAS HILARIOUS!\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\" Obama looked puzzled. \"What about all the threats? Why drag me out here at this time and day, and on my wife's birthday no less?\"\n\nBiden continued to explain, still laughing. \"Because it's FUNNY! You were so freaked out! I'm sure you're more afraid to go home now than before, because your wife will be waking up any moment now to an empty bed, which is the BEST PART! AHAHAHAHA!\" \n\nObama wanted to hit Biden. \"But what about JFK? Why the blocked caller IDs? Why would you do this?\"\n\nBiden continued to laugh. \"JFK? JFK?! That was your only hint you bozo - Just F$:king Kidding! Because it was a joke! What, did you think this had something to do with the old president? It's dead, Jim. I mean Barack.\"\n\nObama was so outraged at this point. He could no longer think of anything to say, so he didn't. He turned around and walked away, fearing how his wife might act when she learns the truth. He hadn't spoken of it, but she had noticed him acting awfully weird the last week. \n\n\"Biden.\" Obama thought to himself. \"I will have my revenge.\"\n\n\nTo be continued in Pranking Obama 2: Electric Boogaloo",

Barack stared at the letter. If it was a prank, it was a damn good one. The signature was exquisite--looping and elongated, a near mirror image of JFK's real signature. Well, if someone went through this much effort for a simple joke, he might as well entertain them. \n\nHe looked around to make sure neither his wife or daughter was around. He walked into the living room just in case and dialed the number.\n\nIt rang once and clicked. \"Barack.\"\n\nIt was John's voice. For a second, Barack thought he was listening to old speeches played in fuzzy, warmly-colored screens.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. The time to serve your nation is now.\"\n\n\"No, you're not,\" Barack said. This was getting less and less funny with every word. It wasn't that funny to begin with. \"Impersonating a President in any serious attempt is a grave offense.\"\n\n\"Look outside.\" The call cut.\n\nBarack peeled back the drapes and peeked through the blinds at a sunny May day. Standing at the end of his driveway, right outside his gate, was John F. Kennedy. A jet black limo sat behind the man. He beckoned Barack and slipped back inside the tinted windows of his car.\n\n---\n\nThe 44th President of the United States gripped the cool brass doorknob. Already, sweat was accumulating on his hands and neck. This was dumb. He shouldn't go, he knew, but JFK had been a personal hero to him. It was under his leadership that humanity reached the moon, he stood up to Russia at the height of their power, he was a man Obama would've given anything to meet. And now he had the chance.\n\nHe opened the door and stepped into the sunlight.\n\nSecret Service agents watched him go. None tried to stop him. They wouldn't even meet his eyes. The front gate opened like curtains in a stage play, revealing the jet black of JFK's limousine.\n\nThe car door swung open. Barack licked his arid lips and swallowed what little moisture he had in his mouth. He got in.\n\n---\n\nThe hum of the car was the only noise between the two Presidents. Obama simply stared. JFK looked exactly like in the photos. The man hadn't aged. He tried scanning John's face for any misplaced flap of skin, any misdrawn shadow, anything to give away the mask. There were none.\n\nThe car stopped and suddenly, the windows flickered to black. They had been TV screens, projecting fake streets and pedestrians!\n\n\"Barack Obama,\" John said turning to face him.\n\nFrom this up close, there was no mistaking who that voice belonged to.\n\n\"Why did you get into this car?\"\n\nBarack's eyes flitted to the locked doors on either side of him and then faced John directly. \"You said it was time to serve my nation.\"\n\nNeither man blinked. At last, John spoke, \"Well answered Mr. President. But I'm afraid that was a lie.\"\n\nObama's heart skipped. He clutched his leg, but refused to show weakness in the face of his captor.\n\n\"It is not time to serve America, but humanity as a whole.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"In 1961, I gave a speech called We Choose to go to the Moon. Are you familiar with it?\"\n\nBarack nodded. Most historians claimed that was the moment that a moon landing was inevitable. With a few choice words, John had mobilized the unstoppable force of human will to reach a land that had always looked down upon them.\n\n\"I gave that speech for a very specific reason. Humanity needed to ascend, but not to a physical place. Initial probes of the moon had returned an element we are unfamiliar with, but this is the element that has kept me young, it grants me certain abilities that I have not shared with the world.\"\n\n\"So you did get shot?\"\n\n\"I also did die.\"\n\nBarack chewed on his lips. If this was still a prank, it was far more elaborate than anything he'd ever experienced. \"So what is this element?\"\n\n\"One without a name and soon it will be the only element worth mentioning. The Russians know its there. The Chinese probably have some idea. Already, there are factions within both countries, powerful enough to influence their space program. These factions are not in the best interests of humanity.\"\n\n\"So what is it that you want from me?\"\n\n\"You have proven your devotion to our nation through your eight grueling years of Presidency. Because of its secrecy, we cannot employ our strengths at full capacity, rather, we must do so through single people willing to live and die for the protection of the human race.\"\n\n\"Like some sort of super hero?\"\n\n\"Not like. Barack Obama, there exists a game far greater than any petty foreign politics. The winner of this game will dictate the future of our race. If you decline my offer, I will drop you off back home and we will never speak again. But if you so choose to accept, you will have the crushing weight of the human race on your shoulders, you will have none of the gratitude or reward. It will be a path through hell itself. So ask not whether you wish to be a hero, but whether you can survive as one.\"\n\nObama clenched his jaw. He had his wife and two daughters to think of. He had finally retired from the most stressful period of his life. But he had become the President not to leave a legacy, but to fulfill his duty.\n\nHe nodded. \"I accept.\"\n\nThe doors of the car unlocked and automatically opened. There would be no turning back now.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for 2+ stories a day, continuations of prompts by popular request, and more!\n",

            "comment": "Former president Barack Obama put down the receiver of the pay phone. What he\njust heard was either the work of a single completely crazy person or ... He\ndidn't want to think about the part that came after the *or*. Whatever came\nafter the *or* was weirder than everything he seen in eight years in\nOffice.\n\nBarack turned to the Secret Service agent who waited at a safe distance. Safe\nto not be able to overhear anything his charge had said, unsafe for anybody who\ntried to harm said charge.\n\n\"Agent Higgins, I have to apologize for what will happen next.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Please open the trunk. I need my bag.\"\n\nWhile the agent fetched the single black sports bag that occupied the luggage\ncompartment of the limousine, the former president patted his pockets. He\nretrieved his keys, the phone and his wallet. Before Higgins could close the\nlid, Barack dropped the items in the trunk.\n\n\"Thank you, Higgins,\" he said and took the bag.\n\nHe turned back to the pay phone. After two steps, he stopped, removed his belt and\nhanded it to the agent.\n\nBarack dialed the number again. This was the third time and he had already\nmemorized it.\n\nAgent Higgins didn't see his charge disappearing. His line of sight was\nblocked by the lid of the truck, or so his report claimed. He'd rather work\nthrough financial files in a dark, lonely basement for the rest of his career\nthat to admit the person he was supposed to protect was sucked into the\nreceiver of a pay phone, at three a.m., in an empty parking lot in Olney, MD.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Call me John\", a voice said, \"Here, sit down.\"\n\nBarack was shoved into an armchair. The world began to spin.\n\n\"If he chucks, you clean it up, Johnny-Boy,\" said a raspy voice from the\nother end of the room.\n\n\"How's the dizziness,\" John asked.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"You have been teleported,\" John said. \"That's why we needed you to get rid of\nall the metal on your person.\"\n\n\"Where am I? Am I still on planet Earth?\"\n\n\"What did you tell him, Johnny? You know, they don't like it when we tell them over\nthe phone,\" the man in the corner said. He sounded angry, and a little bit\nscared.\n\n\"I told him what he needs to know to get here. Nothing more,\" JFK said.\n\n\"I told you, he's a clever one,\" he added.\n\n\"Pfff,\" was the only comment from the corner.\n\n\"Where am I,\" Barack insisted.\n\n\"New Mexico.\"\n\n\"Roswell is in New Mexico. This is about aliens!\"\n\n\"All in due time,\" John said. \"But yes, this is about aliens. Do you remember\neverything from the Book?\"\n\n\"Errm, yes.\"\n\n\"Fine. Remember chapter thirteen?\"\n\n\"Johnny! Remember the agreement. I'll do the talking, you'll do the chores,\"\ncame the voice from the corner.\n\nFor the first time, Barack could see the room clearly. He sat in an armchair.\nThe chair was one of four items of furniture in an otherwise empty room. Two\nidentical armchairs and a small coffee table completed the arrangement. The\ntelephone through which he had arrived was the only piece of electronics. At\nleast, the only visible piece of electronics.\n\nJFK had sat down in the empty chair. The third one was occupied by a tall,\nthin man. He seemed vaguely familiar to Barack, like a high-school buddy that\nyou meet in the restroom of a dive bar, two weeks before the twenty-fifth\nreunion. Like in that situation, the silence continued. Like in that\nsituation, it became awkward.\n\n\"Do you know who I am,\" the man in the corner finally asked.\n\nBarack shook his head. To his surprise, the nausea was gone.\n\n\"You owe me five dollars if you don't say my name in the next few seconds.\"\n\n\"Lincoln? Abraham Lincoln? That's impossible. You are dead.\"\n\n\"The assassination made it all more believable. I didn't have the convenience\nof a twenty-second amendment like you kid.\"\n\nA snort came from the direction of JFK.\n\n\"I meant, you must be over 200 years old now!\"\n\n\"Ah, that. Sorry, it's easy to forget if you're as busy as I am.\"\n\n\"How? How are you not dead? You haven't aged a day,\" Barack said.\n\n\"If I say, *alien technology*, is that sufficient?\"\n\nBarack was silent for a moment, then nodded. Chapter thirteen had mentioned\nadvances in medicine. Among other things. Teleportation was mentioned too.\nThat it involved communication equipment had been left out.\n\n\"Well, let me get to the point quickly. We are all busy here,\" Lincoln said.\n\n\"You have been chosen because you were deemed to be very capable during your\napprenticeship,\" he said.\n\n\"He means your presidency,\" JFK said.\n\n\"My presidency was an apprenticeship? For what job?\"\n\n\"The one we're about to offer you, if either of you kids let me explain,\"\nLincoln said.\n\n\"You mastered your three tests very well, the council decided. Against my\nvote, kid, that you know it. Although I admit that healthcare reform of yours was a\nnoble cause. Anyway, the council has decided that you are fit for a real job.\"\n\nObama was quiet. Lincoln noticed it and continued.\n\n\"We offer you another presidency, of course. There is a world that requires a\nleader and you are that leader. If you accept, you can be in office tomorrow.\"\n\n\"President of the World? I knew it! There is a secret government!\"\n\nJFK sighed. \"A world, not the World, capital *W*. You have been trained to be\npresident of a planet called Smeyenope. It's somewhere in the constellation of\nCygnus, I believe.\"\n\n\"Cygnus? Who are you guys? How can you do that,\" Barack asked.\n\n\"We're the Council of Presidents. We have been appointed by the Council of\nPresidents, which in turn has been appointed the Council of Presidents.\nYou'll get the differences later, when you will be asked to join the Council.\nFor now, it is sufficient to know that temporal anomalies are not as puzzling\nas they sounds right now. As to how: Earth has been created as a training planet\nfor all sorts of jobs. Presidents, policemen, bakers, scientists, and so on.\"\n\n\"Training? This was all an exercise? I ordered the death of people!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Lincoln said, \"It was their test too.\"\n\n\"Those who survived will fight for us in the War. As Abe said, we'll explain\nthat later. Right now, you have to choose if you want the job or not,\" John\nsaid.\n\n\"What about my family?\"\n\n\"We'll arrange everything. If they want to come, we'll relocate them. If not,\nwe take care of that too. Our android surrogates are quite convincing. They\nwill not notice the difference. Neither will you if you decide that you want\none for your wife. However, I was informed that the women of Smeyenope have\ntheir own, very special charm,\" JFK said.\n\n\"What are my duties? What are my powers?\"\n\n\"You govern. That's it. Ensure that the planet runs smoothly, that it fulfils\nits trade obligations. Decide this, order that. Basically the same things you\ndid as POTUS, but with two differences: You don't have an army at your\ndisposal and you can't leave. For the next thousand years, Smeyenope is your\nproblem. Anything else is up to you. Be a dictator, be an advisor. The Council\ndoesn't care as long as the export quota is met.\"\n\n\"A thousand years?\"\n\nLincoln nodded. \"After that, we'll see how you're doing.\"\n\nBarack was quiet for a moment. JFK regarded him, then said, \"If you need time\n...\"\n\n\"No,\" Barack said and looked up, \"I'm good. I'll do it.\"\n\nJFK smiled a little 'I told you so' smile in Lincoln's direction. He handed\nBarack a slip of paper.\n\n\"Good. Take your bag and dial this number. It'll bring you to the Genetic\nAdaption Facility in orbit around Smeyenope.\"\n\n\"Genetic Adaption Facility? What do these aliens look like?\"\n\n\"No idea,\" Lincoln said, \"It's a water planet, that's all I know.\"\n\n\"Water planet? You mean, I'll be president over a planet full of fish?\"\n\n\"Unlikely,\" JFK said, \"The most common pattern among sentient water species is\nthe squid. At least my people are.\"\n\nWith a often-practised motion, JFK reached behind his back and pulled\nsomething down. The sound of a zipper was audible. After a second, his skin\nlooked like it was loose. John shrugged like a man who took off a diving suit.\n\nBarack had to sit down again after Kennedy's skin dropped to the ground. The\npurple skin was not the problem, nor the ten writhing tentacles. Neither was\nthe prospect of living underwater. The problem was, he didn't know how Michelle\nwould react.\n\nPresident of a planet. The most powerful man of the world for a thousand\nyears. There was no choice actually and the Council knew that when they had chosen him.\n\nAfter a second, Barack Obama began to dial.",

Anyone saying otherwise is technically committing treason. The the existence of the Dead President Society is a state secret that is protected in the constitution. You'd be surprised what you can hide in a document no one actually reads all the way through.\"\n\n\"But are they all here?\" Barack asked, rephrasing the question to avoid word games.\n\n\"Only those with remarkable abilities. Which, surprisingly, is most of them.\"\n\n\"So... Lincoln?\"\n\n\"Alive.

Knowing this, you have two options. One, you wake up with no recollection of this, the note, any of it. You can go back to your retirement and enjoy it in peace. Or two, you join us.

            "comment": "\"Very funny, Michelle,\" Barack called into their new home, the letter in his hand. It has always been their tradition to out-prank each other when they move to a new place. JFK, alive? Barack chuckled as he folded the letter and placed it in his pocket. Michelle has got to come out with better pranks.\n\nBarack closed the wooden door and walked into the hallway. Boxes of unopened stuff laid strewn across it. Eight years of presidency had bestowed him countless of possession.\n\n\"Michelle?\" Barack called out again, suddenly noticing the silence in the house. Just a few moments ago, he still heard the voices of Sasha and Malia giggling from the living room, while their mother asked them about their dinner choices. Except for Barack's footsteps on the floor, the air hung still. \n\nSomething did not feel right.\n\n\"Michelle? Sasha? Malia?\" Barack shouted this time, his voice mixed with a tinge of worry. This was not a prank that the girls usually play on him. His hand clutched the letter in his pocket. \n\n\"I am afraid that your wife and daughters are no longer in the house,\" a voice behind him suddenly said. Barack yelled as he swerved around. Standing between him and the door he just closed, stood a figure whom he has only seen on books and television.\n\n\"Martin Luther King,\" Barack whispered, unable to believe what his eyes were seeing. He had seen his share of crazy things in his eight years of presidency, but coming face to face with dead figures was something he never expected.\n\nMartin chuckled at Barack's response. \"Yes, that is correct.\" He extended his hand to Barack. \"And it's an honour to finally meet you, Mr President.\"\n\nBarrak took Martin's hand and shook it. He straightened himself, assuming the straight posture he was well known for. Being in the presence of legends required the courtesy, though he still struggled to hide the surprise in his face. \"The pleasure is mine, Dr King. Forgive me, but I must ask-\"\n\n\"Your family is safe with us, Barack. And yes, the letter in your pocket is indeed from President Kennedy,\" Martin interjected. \n\n\"If I may, can you just walk me through what's going on here?\" Barack gestured with his hands. He was feeling confused, as well as slightly taken aback. Nothing prepared him for this. \n\nMartin sensed the unease that Barack felt. It was understandable. When Gandhi first appeared to him, he could not sleep for days. He placed a hand on Barack's shoulder. What he was about to say to Barack would be far worse than meeting dead people. \"Barack, listen here, I am here to tell you that in a few weeks time, you'll be assassinated.\"\n\nBarack flinched an eyebrow. \"What?\" Surely he was dreaming. The stress of the past eight years must have finally got to him.\n\nThe strength of Martin's hand on him, however, felt real. Martin gave Barack a sympathetic smile, just like how Gandhi had done so to him. \"Yes, I am afraid so. This is just how things are supposed to work. Before you start your real job.\"\n\n\"Don't I get a say in this?\" Barack questioned. He had been looking forward to some time off after his presidency. Another job was just out of the question. He could only lose so much hair.\n\nMartin however, shook his head. \"Barack, I am sorry, but it wouldn't be possible. My boss will not let it.\"\n\n\"And who is your boss, if I may ask?\"\n\nMartin Luther King smiled at the question, as if it was the question he had been waiting for Barack to ask since they first met. \"His name is Jesus.\"\n\n-------------\n\n*Edited Barrack to Barack and Mr King to Dr King. Thanks for the pointer!*\n\n/r/dori_tales",

                    "comment": "Part II:\n\nBarack blinked twice, thrice at the response. Receiving a letter from JFK and meeting Martin Luther King were crazy enough, but being told that they were working for Jesus?\n\nBarack raised both his hands at Martin. \"Whoa, hold it right there. Jesus? THE Jesus?\"\n\nMartin nodded, still with the smile on his face. \"Yes Mr President. THE Jesus. Died and came back to life three days later, just like all of us,\" Martin replied, but it did little to answer all the questions that Barack had.\n\n\"I need you to hold it right there. Who's we?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr President-\"\n\n\"Please, call me Barry.\"\n\n\"Alright. Well, Barry, I trust that you've heard of the eternal war between good and evil before. We, in this case, are the children who have been recruited by the heaven as agents for the war.\"\n\nBarack pinched his nose. Just a few days ago his biggest worry was a guy hitting on Sasha and Trump sending unsolicited DMs to his twitter account. And suddenly he has two historical figures, supposedly dead, trying to recruit him for some holy war.\n\n\"And the catch is that I have to die, right?\" Barack asked, sensing the pattern. Gandhi, JFK, MLK. Heck, even Jesus.\n\nThe smile on Martin's face disappeared. \"Yes. That is the criteria.\"\n\n\"Don't I get a choice?\"\n\n\"You do. But by saying no, you will be putting your family in danger. Satan has already has sights on you. Dying is the only way to erase that mark on your back.\"\n\nBarack slumped into a nearby chair. It was not much of a choice. Martin walked up to him. \"Trust me, it was not easy for me to make the decision either. But the moment you chose to fight for something greater, the forces of universe took notice. There's no backing out now, you're already part of something bigger than you would have ever imagined.\"\n\nBarack sighed, burying his head in his hands. He had wanted to fight the good fight. And he still did. He only wished that someone has told him the terms first. \n\nFew minutes of silence passed between the two men, before Barack raised his head. \"My family, will they be safe?\"\n\n\"The angels will do their best. But sometimes, Satan may succeed. Kennedy's family is an example.\"\n\n\"That's not good enough!\" Barack slammed his fist on the wall. \"I didn't work so hard, gave up so much, just to put my girls in danger!\"\n\nMartin gripped Barack's arm. \"And I promise you, we will do our best to ensure their safety. Your death will be the first step in protecting them.\"\n\nThere was not much Barack could do, given the circumstances. He had no choice. Martin read Barack's feeling, and offered him a consolation. \"If it helps, we would be fighting with your arch nemesis, the GOP.\"\n\nA flame lit up in Obama's eyes at the mention of the same. He extended an arm to Martin Luther King, his idol, now his fellow agent. \"Alright. Count me in, then.\"\n\nMartin took Barack's hand and shook it. \"Welcome to the team, Barry.\"\n\nBarack gave a weary smile. \"I don't suppose I have much of a choice. Glad to be on the team.\"\n\n------------\n\n/r/dori_tales",

Simple, no thrills, nondescript and driven my an unremarkable chauffeur. Why wouldn't it be? No one's focusing on an ex President. Time moves on. Certainly, no-one expects that I'm about to   meet the people who really control things. Not just The United States, but the World.\n\nAs we drive in silence, I think about the subterfuge that all ex Presidents must have experienced. I couldn't even utter a hint to Michelle. She wouldn't have believed if I did. JFK. What will he look like now? Would his existence be too much for the unsuspecting public. If they knew what I'm about to experience, would it blow their minds?\n\nFour hours later, we cross the US/Canada border. And I mean cross. No stop, no questions, no passports. This is real power. Another  two hours and we pull off into a forest. I don't see the guards, but I know they're here, because the driver periodically flashes a beam to unseen phantoms, who respond in kind. Eventually we enter a tunnel and descend at an alarming rate  for what seems like and hour. Who could have built this and how come no one knows about it even in the highest echelons of government?  We stop and the driver ushers me out. We enter a stairwell and walk along a long, lit corridor. The drive disolves away as a door opens and were greeted by a familiar statesman-like, silver-haired gentleman, although  I can't quite place him.in tge small room sits John F. Kennedy. He stands up and shakes my hand firmly. He's unquestionaby aged, but that strong spirit and resolve is still apparent. He addresses the other man, 'Lyndon, introduce Barack to Julius.

Lay back!\"\n\nWe laid back down on our bed and the straps automatically held us down. I thought of the scene in 'The Goonies' when they slide down to the pirate ship. But, I had no idea where our tunnel would lead. We just slid.\n\nThe tunnel was dim, but lit the whole way down. Ups and downs, curves, and loop-d-loops. Eventually we started slowing down and surprisingly, we drop again. Out of the tunnel and into the 1960's Batmobile. My Michelle and I looked at each other, smile, and we put on our masks.\n\nI couldn't hear her scream as I peeled away towards the symbol on the sky. \n\n[edit] Dedicated to Batman's real creator, Bill Finger.

            "comment": "I blinked as I read the letter a second time. My first instinct was to throw it to the trash, but I stayed standing in front of my desk. My staff was greatly reduced, but I still had someone who went over my mail and selected the most interesting for me to personally read. Unless someone had sneaked into the new house and left this for me to read, which was unlikely, someone in my staff had considered this letter *\u2013this prank-* amusing enough to let me see it.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I found it amusing. It was confusing more than anything, baffling that someone would sign as JFK, and even provide a number for me to call. I shrugged, and figured that lower standards for mail reception were part of the post-presidency. Hey, at least I might get the occasional funny letter. I put the letter in my drawer, making a mental note to show it to Michelle, once she got back from that *Fitness in the 21st Century* forum.\n\nI woke up when I heard the front door close, some hushed voices becoming louder as they approached my room. That was odd. Malia and Sasha used to talk in hushed voices when they were small, but that was during our early years in the White House, long before I was even elected to a second term. I stayed lying on the bed, but paid attention to the sounds. I recognised one of the voices: Patrick, the head of my personal security detail. The other was familiar, but annoyingly elusive. I had heard that voice, somewhere, but I couldn\u2019t remember when I had heard it and whose it was.\n\nI sat on the bad when I heard the voices reach the other side of the door; then it opened, and sure enough, Patrick was there, accompanied by an older man. I blinked, same as earlier in the day, because that face I did recognise.\n\n\u201cI apologise for disturbing you in your sleep, Mr President. I assure you, however, that this will be worth your time.\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth, nothing came out, then closed it. I knew that face. Of course I did. Every American did, just like everyone knew that he had been assassinated nearly 70 years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Kennedy?\u201d\n\nHe grinned and nodded, quickly turning to Patrick and asking him to leave us alone. I took that time to really look at the man in front of me. He was old, already a hundred by my math, yet he looked in good shape, reasonably agile, and definitely in a sound state of mind. He walked towards me, until he reached my bed, then sat by my side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have my questions, Mr President. I\u2019ll try to get some of the obvious ones out of the way, and then you may ask me whatever it is you need to know.\u201d\nHe took a breath, as if preparing himself for a long, rehearsed speech, then started talking. \u201cYes, I am indeed John F. Kennedy, and I am still alive. I survived what was in reality a staged assassination, which was planned in cooperation with Agent Lee Oswald.\u201d\n\nThis alone was a huge piece of information to process. I had taken a look at the classified files soon after my first inauguration, and they clearly said that Oswald had acted alone. I remember being disappointed, having been so sure that it had been a conspiracy. Yet here was Kennedy himself, telling me not only that it had been a conspiracy, but also that he was in on it!\n\n\u201cYes, Dr King and Bobby were truly assassinated. Honestly, those are two of my greatest regrets, and arguably two of my greatest failures.\u201d He sighed, his face betraying a shadow of sadness, before he put himself together and continued talking.\n\n\u201cI have been watching your presidency with great interest. I will not pass judgement on the soundness of your policies, that is not my job, but I do believe, and others agree, that you displayed great skill in navigating the political arena, in generating hope and mobilising people towards a common goal.\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth, ready to talk. He had noticed, and let me talk as soon as he finished his sentence.\n\n\u201cOthers?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure by now you may have guessed that there is much to the world than what you saw as President of the United States. Some former leaders are aware of our activities, and all Soviet leaders were fully briefed, but after myself, no US President has been informed on the existence of this organisation, let alone the full scope of its activities. At least while in office.\u201d\n\nI was speechless, for the third or fourth time in the conversation, but this time I didn\u2019t even have the words in my head. How to believe all this? Kennedy was alive? He had staged his assassination to join a secret organisation? Soviet leaders knew, but American presidents were kept in the dark? What was this?\n\nIndeed, I had to know that. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\nKennedy smiled, his wrinkles showing around his eyes and lips. \u201cThis, Mr President, is your briefing.\u201d",

How in the heck did that happen?\n\n**Long story. Anyways, we got some work to do.**\n\nOk. I always admired your sense of service to the community. I tried to emulate your leadership and warmth, how you called for us to come together and strive to be a better nation. You served your country on the battlefield and in the halls of our nation's capitol. As long as we continue to move forward with hope, we honor your courage and vision.\n\n**Good. Welcome to my punk rock music venue.**\n\nI'm sorry?\n\n**I spent the past 53 years being immortal and running the hottest punk club in DC. What, you were president for eight whole years and never heard of Oswald's Bar? It's where Fugazi played their first show. Best pit I've ever been in. Afterwards, Ian McKaye came up and introduced himself. We hit it off immediately. We still have a secret handshake to this day, one we made up that night.**\n\nSorry, I'm unfamiliar.\n\n**Well, you're here now and you work for me.**\n\nI beg your pardon?\n\n**You're the new sound guy.**\n\nSir (chuckles) with all due respect, I'm a two term president with a family, a foundation, speaking gigs in the six figure range... I'm afraid I can't work at some music venue.\n\n**Too late. Doors are about to open. The bands can load in through that door. Line check before each band, door split three ways after we take out $150, that's your cut. The Smear Campaign headlines, you've got Ian &amp; The Beans before then, and before THAT it's The Fob Knobs. Somebody's cousins band is probably gonna open. Won't matter who. They'll play to three people and keep asking you for more vocals in the monitor. Also, don't pay the drummer. NEVER pay the drummer. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a trophy to win at the sports arena.  (zooms off on skateboard)**\n\nGod, I miss that man. (wipes away tear) Well, this won't be so bad. I mean, sure, the presidency was great but I can run the board, drink some beers, hang out with people not named Biden... Oh, God. Wait, that can't be... Oh, no he's coming towards me.\n\n*Hey, Barry!*\n\nHello, Joe.\n\n*Dude, I didn't know you came here too. You meet JFK?*\n\nYou knew?\n\n*You never figured it out? Ha! Who knew the POTUS was really just a poser.  He was the other bass player for Nation of Ulysses, too.*\n\nListen, I'd love to chat, but I have to do sound for this band.\n\n*It's like we're back in the White House! I'm getting the warm fuzzies. Anyhow, I gotta boogie but I'll be back for the headliner. Put me on the guest list! (zooms away on hoverboard)*\n\nOk. Bye, Joe.

He was shocked as he looked at it. A sudden cold breath, a heart pounding harder than ever, he was most definitely shocked,as the paper he just touched glowed. \nNow he quickly removed his fingers from the paper expecting things to return back to normal, but the looming darkness only grew darker and darker. \nThe paper was still shining. It was a golden yellow that felt warm as thought it were made of the gold from sun itself. \nAs he held the letter closer he began to notice something oddly familiar about it.

            "comment": "JFK, huh? Barack thought back to the last time he had heard anything about him. It had been one of those first nights in the White House when his curiosity had gotten the best of him. He'd asked about the conspiracies. Not just one or two - all of them. Most of the answers he received were pretty disappointing, but JFK - now that was interesting. When he had asked what had happened - who had killed Kennedy and from what location, the sheepish looking historian from the CIA got an odd look on his face. \"Um, we don't, really know...\" How could they not know? There was a body wasn't there? \"Well, no, not exactly...\" Barack was intrigued, and though he wanted to follow up he was soon distracted by his healthcare reforms and the day-to-day chaos of running the country. Of course, in retirement, he finally had time to dwell upon the mystery, though he was now distracted by something even more important - family. \n\nUntil the letter arrived. Could it be? Could JFK still be alive? And why would he be contacting a former president? Uncertainty gripped Barack as he slowly pulled out his smartphone and began dialing. \n\n\"I know you have questions.\" A silhouette said from the doorway of Barack's study.  \"I don't have all the answers.\" The shadow of a man stepped forward into the light, revealing a handsome figure with a familiar visage. \n\nTaken aback, Barack tried to remain as calm as possible, considering the impossible circumstances. He put the phone down. Must have been a test. \"You...sent the letter, uh, Mr. President?\" \n\n\"I did.\" The figure stepped forward with his hand outstretched, offering a handshake in greeting. \"Jack Kennedy, at your service.\" His hand felt real. The face looked real. And, Barack thought, there hadn't been a body all those years ago...\n\n\"Ok. Let's say I believe you. What are you doing here?\"\n\nKennedy sighed. \"Son, the answer to that goes all the way back to Dallas in 1963. And like I said, even I don't know everything. What I do remember is riding in the motorcade and suddenly finding myself in the future.\" When Barack cocked an eyebrow, Kennedy quickly clarified. \"No, not this 'future' - a more distant one, one where - and hold on to your chowder - time travel exists.\" \n\n\"Uh huh.\" Well, it made as much sense as everything else so far. When talking to a living, breathing JFK, Barack figured, time travel was as obvious to him as GOP obstructionism. \"But what exactly does this have to do with me?\"\n\n\"We're almost there. Once I discovered I was in the future I ran straight to the library to see what I missed. I wept for Bobby and I celebrated our space program. And I must admit, the conspiracies surrounding myself brought me a few good laughs. Eventually though, my research brought me to The Moment, right here in 2017. \n\n\"The Moment?\" \n\n\"This is it, Barry. The moment when humanity realizes time travel is possible. The moment when I - when I die. For real this time.\" Kennedy went silent, and was now looking at the ground. \n \nBarack processed what Kennedy had just said. If he was implying what Barack thought he was implying...\"No, no. You can't mean that.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I do, son. I need you to kill me.\"",

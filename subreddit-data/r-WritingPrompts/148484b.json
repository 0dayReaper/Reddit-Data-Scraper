            "comment": " I still have no idea whether I can even think rationally about this because of that thing's influence, as I would normally be freaking out, but I guess this works too seeing the conundrun I am currently in.\n\n \"Sweetie, would you take another look at that puppy and  tell me what kind of puppy inhabits a non-euclidean space? To be honest I am not even completely sure how did you manage to touch it, let alone contain it with your hands.\"\n\n Of course, understanding it would be impossible, my human mind is not built to observe such a creature, but Abigail seemed unfazed.\n\n \"So what, Dad? The neighbour's dog was sent to the fourth dimension just the other day!\" She paused for a few seconds while counting on her fingers. \"Or was it tomorrow? Anyway, would you say he is not a dog?\", she said, her eyes filled with rebellious defiance.\n\n \"First of all, the dog did not willingly travel to another dimension, it was kidnapped by forces unknown! Second of all, it at least looked like a dog, which is more than I can say about what you're holding.\"\n\n \"Oh come on, he might be a bit different but saying something like that is just rude!\"\n\n \"He is an ever-changing vortex of tentacles! How is that anywhere close to a dog?\", I said in disbelief. \n\n As if understanding our conversation, the creature rearranged its tentacles in a shape that somewhat resembled a quadruped, although the \"ever-changing\" aspect made it a bit difficult.\n\n \"See? Now it looks just like a dog.\" Abigail said with a smug smile plastered across her face. \n\n \"So you agree that he did not look like a dog! And still doesn't, might I add.\"\n\n \"That is besides the point! All that matters is that little Diego here had hurt his external organs when ripping through the space-time continuum to get here on Earth, so I took care of him and then he started to follow me around! He clearly likes me and I like him too, so why not give it a shot? Please, Dad!\" Abigail said while hugging the eldritch beast. \n\n The more I looked at it, the more my thoughts seemed to get scrambled around and turned into nothingness, so it was hard to keep arguing.\n\n \"You know what? Fine! But I will not take care of this thing as I am way too old for this. Besides, don't blame me when he starts devouring your dreams and turning you into a souless shell of your former self! And you will clean after every dimensional rift he leaves behind.\" I begrudgingly said, giving up on discussing with her.\n\n It would not be long before the Outer Gods from beyond time and space brought forth the apocalypse anyway, so it was fine. \n\n While she happily walked away with her new friend, I took a sip of my coffee and watched a gigantic vortex of tentacles starting to spread a cloud of spores over the world.\n\n Children, am I right?",

            "comment": "As soon as I enter the house I'm greeted by the warm sound of a child's laughter. The kind of mischievous laugh that you can't keep from warming your chest and melting the icy stress of a hard day's work. \n\n\"Oh great, what are you up to now?\" I call out, the grin evident in my voice. Another quick snicker and a few seconds of suspicious silence later, my son calls back to me. \n\n\"Don't be mad, but I have a surprise!\"\n\nHe's a good kid, never gets into trouble and keeps pretty good grades. I often let him get away with things I know other parents would scoff at, but I can't help it. He never *really* crosses the line and its usually in good fun. So as I shrug off my bag and head for the kitchen I'm preparing myself for whatever silly plan he's concocted today.\n\nI find him holding a carrot on a step stool standing in front of the open fridge, which isn't too unusual, but today he has a new companion with him. At the bottom of the stool, paws still raised, is a chubby young raccon reaching up for his next portion of the plundered produce.\n\n\"A puppyyy!\" He exclaims in a drawn out sing-songy way, wiggling his hands for the great reveal.\n\nOkay, that one stops me in my tracks. I furrow my brow and try to wipe the smile off my face but I have to admit - it's a pretty cute scene. Throw some youthful blush on his cheeks and a checkered hand-towel on the oven handle and I can picture it framed on my grandmother's wall. \"Wha-\" I start, \"Where-\" \n\nHe throws up his hands, drawing a chitter out of the furry little fellow who seems to be losing his patience \"It's not what it looks like!\"\n\nI manage an \"Oh really?\" before he continues, \"I found him out back, but he's reformed I swear!\"\n\nIt's such a strange statement that I can't help but chuckle, \"Reformed, what do you mean reformed?\" He's emboldened by my mirth and hops off the stool, finally relinquishing the carrrot to his partner in crime. \n\n\"He was digging in the garbage but he wasn't stealing, just hungry. I've been feeding him the old stuff and I think his criminal days are over.\" \n\n\"And what makes you think this little guy's a criminal?\" I ask, already guessing what's coming next.\n\n\"The mask, of course!\"\n\nNow I'm full on belly laughing, \"Tell you what,\" I say, \"Let's go fix that hole in the fence out back and see if we can't find a good box to make him a home out of. If he's still around in the morning we'll discuss keeping him.\"\n\nHe knows he's already won me over, even if I sense that his ignorance was a feigned attempt to get one over on his old softy of a dad. \"Deal!\" He yells, and sticks a hand out for me to shake.",

            "comment": "\"Oh my goodness!\" I stared at the mess in the kitchen, with my jaw about to dislodge itself fron my skull. Half-eaten vegetables had been strewn all over the floor and the fridge was wide open. But what really caught my eye was the grey-ish \"puppy\" less than a metre long happily indulging itself with the spilled greens. \n\nIts snout looked like that of a pug, but that was as close to an actual puppy as that strange creature could get. I wanted to think that the \"puppy\" simply had a bad case of mange, but that wouldn't explain why its skin was scaly, why its teeth were so blunt or why its back was lined with osteoderms. All I could really tell was that this creature was a herbivore, and most definitely a reptile.\n\n\"Ok Glacia, what did you bring back this time?\" My daughter Glacia was a sweet but shy girl who was obsessed with animals (considering that I worked at the zoo which was not too far away, I could kind of see where she may have gotten that interest from). This wasn't the first time that she brought home a weird animal - at one point, she brought home an orphaned pangolin which was now under the zoo's care.\n\nGlacia awkwardly emerged from her bedroom. \"Um, actually, I have no idea. I'm trying to find out now. Although, I'm kinda certain that it's a crocodile.\" Ok, so this weird thing is actually a reptile.\n\n\"Ok, so this weird thing is actually a reptile. But first, we need to do something about this mess.\" I approached the creature, which, startled, ran in an admittedly silly manner into my bedroom. \n\nI followed the reptile into my room, where I saw it try to squeeze itself under my bed. \"I've got you now!\" But as I drew closer to the little reptile, it started kicking its hind legs, as if it was trying to kick up sand into my face. \n\n\"Let me try.\" Glacia told me, gesturing to me to back away, to which I complied. She held a broccoli towards the reptile. It calmed down, and pushed itself out from under the bed. I decided to bring the animal a pile of vegetables. As the creature returned to indulging itself, my mind started to clear from the shock of walking into the messy house. \n\nI started putting the pieces together. A herbivorous pug-like crocodilian... I realized that I heard of it many times before. A Simosuchus! It felt surreal, knowing that there was a Cretaceous crocodillian in my own home. But now there was a even bigger question that started to plague my mind: Why's there a Simosuchus here? This isn't even the country where it's from!\n\n\"Where did you find this creature?\" I asked.\n\n\"I found it near the pond in the nearby park while walking home from school. It looked like it was fleeing from a larger wild animal. I didn't see what was chasing it though.\" I started to get the chills, as I realized what this could imply. \n\n\"Let's take a quick look at the park and then probably bring this creature to the zoo. I have a bad feeling that something dangerous is in the park.\" \n\n...\n\nAs we arrived at the park, we noticed a small crowd gathered around the carpark, where we could hear a booming croaking sound. However, the croaking was quickly drowned out by even louder squealing, which we recognized as belonging to otters. As Glacia, the Simosuchus (which we named Ghost) and I rushed to the squealing, we were greeted by a horrifying yet incredible sight.\n\nAcross the road, standing by the pond, was the unmistakeable shape of a dinosaur! It appeared to be slightly taller than a human, with a rounded skull, a sausage-shaped body and barely visible arms. I instantly recognized it as a Majungasaurus. \n\nThe Majungasaurus was being mobbed by close to a dozen otters. In its mouth was the remains of a baby otter. Despite the size difference between the theropod and the otters, the small mammals were putting up a good fight and relentlessly inflicting scratches on the dinosaur. \n\nDefeated, the Majungasaurus turned and fled from the romp of squealing otters. But there was a new problem: The dinosaur was charging right towards us! Grabbing Ghost, Glacia and I started running back towards the carpark. \n\nOther park visitors started fleeing in terror as well. Unfortunately, it was clear that the dinosaur had now set its sights on the humans in the park. \n\nAs we tried to run back towards our car, Glacia tripped, dropping Ghost. I tried to run back to help my daughter, but we both froze in terror as we saw the dinosaur looming over her. \n\n\"I have to save her!\" I screamed, but a passerby grabbed me. \n\n\"We have to run!\" \n\nJust before the Majungasaurus could bite my daughter, it got distracted by a small grey figure. Ghost! He nipped the Majungasaurus, distracting the large dinosaur. Now setting its sights to Ghost, it started following him, giving me the time to help Glacia. \n\nGhost reached a nearby monitor lizard's burrow, where he started kicking up dirt at the Majungasaurus' face, stunning it.\n\nJust then, some kids started pelting stones at the giant theropod. Other people picked up branches, stones and sticks (some even breaking the branches off trees), waving them in the air and throwing them at the dinosaur, all while they were screaming at the dinosaur. Overwhelmed, the dinosaur fled in the direction of the pond, with the mob of people hot on its heels. \n\nThe Majungasaurus came to a halt close to the road between the carpark and the pond, where the angry romp of otters were still there. Recognizing the Majungasaurus, they started squealing at the dinosaur as well.\n\nWith the crowd of people inching closer to the dinosaur, it suddenly made a lunge towards the pond, as if in a last-ditch effort to save itself when a loud screeching sound was heard. \n\nEveryone, including the otters on the opposite side of the road, jumped back in shock as a swerving truck crashed into the theropod. Blood and glass splattered all over the road, as the Majungasaurus fell to the ground, dead.\n\nWhile everyone was reeling from the shock of what just happened, a teenage boy tugged at my shirt. \"I think you and your little friend might be interested in this,\" he said. Glacia, Ghost and I decided to follow him. \n\nWe arrived at a clearing. \"Eh? I could have sworn I saw a glowing ball of light a few minutes ago. I ran into it while we were fleeing from that walking sausage. There seemed to be strange birds coming out from it.\" \n\n\"I believe you,\" I told the boy. \"I think that might have been how our little friend got here.\"\n\n\n3 months later...\n\n\nApart from a few scrapes and bruises on Glacia's legs, nobody was seriously hurt in the Majungasaurus incident. Although breaking the trees in the park was technically a crime, nobody got charged as it was ruled off as self-defence.\n\nEven now, pictures of the Majungasaurus and Ghost were circulating all over the internet and on the news. Ghost now resided at the reptile garden in the zoo I work at where he would be studied, with Glacia being a regular visitor there. He would always get excited whenever his best friend came to visit.\n\nAlthough the boy gave his testimony regarding the bright light, nobody else besides my daughter and myself seemed to believe him.\n\nThroughout the past few months, there had been multiple reported sightings of giant frogs in the park, along with long tailed bird-like creatures. Some even reported seeing a gigantic snake lurking around the pond area. But most mysteriously, a bright light similar to what the boy described had recently been sighted in Britain...",

            "comment": "\u201cCome with me, I have something to show you.\u201d\n\nI looked up from my computer where I was engrossed in a project to see Jonah standing beside my work station. Trying to do homework and data entry all at home while basically having to raise my 8-year-old brother was not easy, and hardly an hour ever went by without several disturbances. It sure would be nice if our parents were around to do their jobs so that I could do mine. I turned my chair towards him with a sigh. \u201cWhat is it now, Jonah?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201d He giggled mischievously.\n\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like surprises. What is it?\u201d\n\nHe twirled back and forth, letting his arms flap and dangle. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but you have to promise not to tell Mom!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell her if it\u2019s serious,\u201d I said, although I couldn\u2019t imagine her doing anything useful. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nMy brother giggled. \u201cI found a puppy!\u201d\n\nI stood up. \u201cA puppy?!\u201d This was not what I needed to deal with while I was trying to work. How long would it take to drive to a shelter? Did it have its shots? Was it infested with rabies? Where on Earth did he find one? \u201cJeez, dude, you can\u2019t just bring random animals home!\u201d I said. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFollow me!\u201d Jonah said, and he pranced out of my room and down the hallway.\n\nI followed hesitantly, not sure if this was a prank. It was just like Jonah to pull some crazy shenanigans and somehow make them into something even crazier \u2013 like that time he wanted to play \u201csword fighting\u201d and pulled out an actual sword that he told me he found in a dumpster but really stole from a museum on a school field trip. I didn\u2019t trust the police after the way they blamed me for not keeping a closer eye on him. I hoped this puppy wasn\u2019t stolen from somewhere. The last thing I needed right now was another threat of a criminal record.\n\nI stopped in the kitchen to grab a broom just in case I needed to whack a wild animal or something. I heard Jonah call for me again, and traced him to the back door. We stepped outside, and after a few \u201cThis way!\u201ds and \u201cOver here!\u201ds, we made our way to the back of the shed.\n\nA pocket in the ground next to the shed was filled with leaves, and I watched the leaves shift slightly as something gently moved underneath. \u201cBe careful, he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d said Jonah quietly.\n\nI used the brush of the broom to move the leaves away, then jumped back and gasped as I caught a glimpse of the creature. \u201cJonah, what is that thing?!\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s a puppy!\u201d he hollered, moving towards me. \u201cAnd quit moving so much, you\u2019ll scare him!\u201d\n\nI turned toward him sternly. \u201cThat\u2019s no puppy. Seriously, what is that?\u201d\n\nThe creature had risen from the leaves and was shaking itself off. It looked vaguely dog-like, but something was wrong. There was too much hair, too much skin, too many limbs, too much \u2013 everything. Jonah examined it quietly, his voice shrinking as he responded, \u201cWell\u2026 It *was* a puppy.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Was*?\u201d I turned to look at him. \u201cHow long have you had that thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Since this morning.\u201d His tone was almost apologetic as he scooted towards me. \u201cIt definitely didn\u2019t look like that. It looked like a cute little labradoodle. I found it at school.\u201d\n\nThe creature had a few puppy-like features. It also had squirrel tails, bird talons, and set of eyes in places where they didn\u2019t belong. I even thought that I made out a few glimpses of features that looked almost human. \u201cJonah\u2026\u201d I spoke quietly, pointing the end of the broom feebly at the creature with a tight but shaking grip. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to kill that thing. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I can\u2019t take it to a shelter. I have a bad feeling about it. I don\u2019t think it ought to be alive. Get me a knife from the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d he cried. \u201cNo\u2026 No way, we\u2019re keeping him! He might look weird, but he really is a good puppy! I promise! I\u2019ll show you!\u201d\n\nMy brother raced towards the monster. In a flash, I heard myself screaming as if outside of my body, and I watched myself reaching for my brother as he flew forwards. The beast screamed with delight as Jonah barreled toward it, opening up its body like a net. In the next flash, I was hyperventilating with blood all around me. In front of me, the creature grew more limbs: an arm here, an eyeball there. The eyeball looked at me with strange and wild emotions stirring inside it. It was the same color as Jonah\u2019s.\n\nI ran into the house, stumbling and dizzy, barely aware of my surroundings. All I could think was to call Mom. If there were ever a time for her to be a parent, it was now. I picked up the phone and dialed her as claws scratched against the back door and the world spun. The phone rang and rang and rang, but no one ever picked up.",

            "comment": "She hated dogs.\n\nHated the big ones and the small ones. The ones with flat noses and curling ears and stub tails and the ones only a half-recalled ancestry away from wolf. The wieners and the racers and the yappers and the junkyard growlers. All of them. Hated the whole last one of them: ever since that near-mauling all those years ago, since a little girl who still thought that dogs were nice and friendly and adorable tried to pet a stray labrador wagging its tail and saw their teeth - their real teeth - for the first time. Never again.\n\nHer parents had never had a dog again. She'd never had a dog again. Never dated anyone with a dog, either - the *words* she had for that one ex-boyfriend who tried to hide his damn pitbull - and never kept a friendship with someone who had them. And no matter how much her little boy might ask whenever they passed the pet store, no matter how envious he might seem at the thought of other kids talking about their new puppies and loyal forever-friends, there'd be no dogs for him either as long as he lived under her roof.\n\nCall it trauma, call it a grudge, be an asshole if you must and call her *unreasonable*...but she knew what to stand her ground on. If her boy ever brought home a puppy - no matter if it had the wettest little nose, the biggest eyes, the most adorable and gentlest bark - that beast was heading back straight into the street...the shelter, if she was feeling kind.\n\nThis, then, was the source of her current turmoil. For the time had finally come: her darling baby boy had finally brought a puppy home. Even now, as he stood in the front doorway that joined the kitchen to outside, that face - with the expression of pure love, hope, and just the faintest hint of fear that she might say no - gazed up at her, pleading with her. Begging.\n\n\"Please Momma, please please please can we keep her? I'll do all the chores and feed her and walk her and if she damages something I'll pay for it back and she looked so sad out there we can't just get rid of her please...\"\n\nThe puppy sat next to her boy, gurgling and clicking softly as it too looked at her with big, moist eyes. A wet, sucking whine softly emerged from its proboscis. Its ridges were dripping slime onto the kitchen linoleum.\n\nIt was no dog.\n\nWhat it was, she didn't know and she doubted anyone else did either. It wasn't quite like a fly, or a slug, or a toad but it was something a bit like all of them jammed together. Pallid white, lightly translucent, just enough to let you know that whatever its internal anatomy was like it wasn't like anything a normal animal should have. It had too many eyes for something larger than her son, certainly, black and shiny and glistening with fluid. Rather too many feet too, though at least their claws seemed to squish against the linoleum rather than scratch. And it was altogether very...mucousy. Even if the slime smelled refreshingly like lemons.\n\nShe folded her arms. Her boy was still pleading, though wordlessly now. And the \"puppy\" sat there, looking at her. Every so often it would shake itself, or whine, or jiggle its form up and down as if wanting to play but obedient enough to wait. Damnation, no fly-headed monstrosity lurched out from who knows where should look so adorable.\n\nHe obviously couldn't keep it, though. What did a thing like that eat? Would it try to eat her or her son? The fly-like proboscis certainly didn't look dangerous - soft and spongy - but what if it drooled acid or something equally horrid? What effects would its slime have on the things around their home? How did it...excrete?\n\n\"I don't know yet. How do you know it's-\"\n\nAt once, the bristly hairs across the \"puppy\" raised high, and it hissed. Its bulk shifted, unnatural musculature rippling as it stood to attention. Dear lord it was bigger than she was. What was causing it to-\n\nBark! Bark Bark! Bark!\n\nA dog outside, on the other side of the street, no owner or leash in sight. It barked again. Raised its tail high and lowered its head. Growled.\n\nChildhood memory roared back into her, body tensing and mind whirling. The \"puppy\" rustled and jiggled in agitation. Her boy, equally alarmed at its sudden movement, rushed to her side and hugged her tightly. The thought came rushing in: it was a wild animal, it was startled, it was going to attack them, please help someone-\n\nThe \"puppy\" turned to face the dog. It hissed, then hooted, then flared vestigial rubbery wings and reared up. Its front pair of legs rose up, spiked hairs bristling and claws hardening into talons that it clicked together in rapid succession. Proboscis extended, it charged...\n\n...and then, as soon as it had made sure the dog was running - tail between its legs - it settled down. Softened. Turned around. Came back to her boy and nudged him until he let go of her, then pushed its face into his hand with a happy-sounding clogged warble. There was no wince of pain on his face as it coated his hand with slime. Not acidic, then.\n\nHuh.\n\nShe took a few seconds to let out her held breath. To her surprise, she laughed.\n\n\"We'll talk about this more in the morning. For now, she can stay the night.\"",

            "comment": "It was the warm summer morning of a new day, Penny, a blonde woman with tired eyes, mother of Suzy and of a fat grey cat named Booze, fried eggs and bacon on a pan. The fresh scent is a smell Suzy is used to smelling in the morning each day. Penny, as a supervisor of a lending company, works online and purely has to answer a couple of dumb questions every day and win a good paycheck every end of the month. Jake would be the name of her husband, however for the last couple of weeks he has been out at work on a distant state and only gets to talk to his wife and Suzy through phone calls before bed or in the morning, how knew timezones could be different in the same country. \n\nPenny, as I mentioned, had just finished frying an egg and a slice of bacon and put them neatly on a porcelain plate on the balcony of her kitchen. It wasn't a big house, but she owned it, and that's all she could ask for. \n\nBooze continued to bother her throughout the morning with loud cries for food, however she insisted on getting the human's breakfast beforehand, due to the fact that Booze looked more like an over-filled pillow than an actual cat. \n\nAfter putting both plates on the balcony, she quickly shakes the sack of cat food so that the chubby feline won't eat Suzy's food, and puts a very small portion of food into a big metal bowl, which anyone from outside could only assume could be the possession of a Great dane or a Saint bernard, but that was instead used to feed an even bigger and more ferocious beast that was Booze the tabby.\n\nAt this exact moment, Suzy was out and about in the frontyard, something her mom got her to do every day in exchange for using her phone a couple minutes every day. The kitchen didn't have any windows to the frontyard, but it's a good thing Booze is castrated and too lazy to jump the fence, because keeping the front door opened is a natural habit of Penny to keep an eye on the energetic toddler that was Suzy every now and then.\n\nNormally, she would catch some bugs or get her hands covered in dirt before showing Penny her inventious discoveries such as a Ladybug, or a weird shaped rock. If she was lucky, someone would walk by with their dog and Suzy would get to pet it. She was always a very energetic toddler, but one that always found a way to always have something to do. Luckily she was very cautious, a good combination for when you're a mother that can't constantly watch over your kid and make sure they don't get into trouble, but that also can't spend that much time with them on your own. Weekends are a blessing for that, but when cash is low, at max watching a movie or playing doll would entertain Suzy enough, and has done so for the last 6 years. Hopefully, school should put that energy to good use next year, and so is Penny hoping. \n\n\"Suzy, come get breakfast!\" Penny yells towards the door while putting away a ginormous bag of cat food. \"Coming!\" she hears in the distance, together with some  distant rambling that she couldn't make out. Figured she was talking to a bug, saying goodbye to a plant or someone she saw passing by. \n\n\"Mom! Mom! Look, I brought a puppy!\" Suzy shouts excitedly as she walks in the house, rubbing the sole of her feet across the \"Welcome Home\" mat to clean her slippers. Penny quickly frowns while turned away and sighs \"Suzy, we already have Booze, we can't get you a puppy.\" This was NOT the first time Suzy has brought a dog home. Most of the times, strays become victims of dognapping commited by Suzy and brought home in hopes Penny will accept it. The answer has always been no, and it's never changed. The Strays were brought to a shelter and everything went back to normal, after some crying and whining from Suzy, of course. \"Cmon, let's get it to the shel-\" when Penny turns around, closing the cabinet door, she's met with a confusing sight. \n\n\"Hi\" says a skinny asian boy, around 4 to 5 years older than Suzy, with a dirty face and worn down dirty pajamas. \"...Hello? Suzy... This isn't a puppy.\" Penny looks at Suzy with a tired face full of patience. \"Huh? He says woof, like the puppies on TV! Right? Look.\" Suzy looks at the little boy with bright expectation as if waiting for an spectacle. \"Woof\" says the little boy in a monotone tone of voice before smiling. \"Where do you live? I'll get you back to your parents.\" Penny approaches the little boy cautiously as to not overwhelm him. \"I don't live anywhere\" he says as if he had already said that multiple times, a little impaciently while looking around happily. Penny re-thinks this situation, and considers the appearance of the little boy. \"Do you live in the streets?\" He nods. \"Are you alone?\" He thinks for a moment and replies with confidence. \"Yeah.\" Penny looks down and nods. Well, from what she's gathered, this little boy might be homeless and might have no one to go, if his parents are with him or not is questionable, he looked very skinny and says to be alone, which is scary to think about. Suzy watches quietly before speaking when it gets silent \"I don't think he has an owner!\" Penny closes the door and thinks for a moment. \"Well.. Do you want to eat something?\" She offers, marching behind the counter. \"Yes please!\" the little boy says excitedly. Penny smiles, not being able to ignore how silly this situation is. She hands out Suzy's plate to the little girl, which sat on one of the stools happily, and what was supposed to be her own plate, to the little boy, which she helped get up the stool. Both ate while Suzy asked questions on the \"Puppy\"'s origin, most of which he replied he wasn't sure or doesn't know. \n\nLong story short, Penny went on to prepare a bath for the little boy and they talked about his origins while Suzy played doll in the background, in which Penny deducted that his parents might have neglected him to the point he doesn't know them, which was sickening to think about, which is why she made a long call with Jake to talk about the situation. Both agreed to keep the boy, and adopt him legally, which ended up being a challenge, but throughout the years has proven to be possible and the more they got to know him, the more they realized it was worth it. Caleb was now an important member of the family, and his bond with Suzy grew stronger each day. \n\nNowadays, this story is at max told at family dinners, in which Suzy, now in high school, and Caleb, now completing his degree on architecture and living with his girlfriend, laugh at uncomfortably, but in which Penny and Jake, now retired and living in a wooden house in a quiet neighbourhood, talk about proudly, missing the good days and never being able to imagine what life would've been like if they had never adopted a Puppy that day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally never do this and it's currently 2am, so pls go easy on the criticism.",

            "comment": "No dogs.\n\nThat\u2019s what Emily always said when her son Harry asked her for one. It didn\u2019t matter how many times they passed a pet shop, how many times Harry played with their neighbor\u2019s poodle, or met a dog while the family went on their regular hiking trips, the answer was always \u201cno dogs\u201d.\n\nHarry could barely take care of himself, much less be responsible for another life. Until he demonstrated he could help out with basic household chores and pick up the empty bags of potato chips he left strewn all over the house without being reprimanded, she would never buy him a pet. Her resolve only hardened as she asked him a few questions while he was playing with the poodle.\n\nDo you want to clean up Lucky\u2019s poop? No.\n\nDo you think you can comb Lucky\u2019s fur nicely every day? No.\n\nDo you want to bathe and blow dry all that hair? No.\n\nIf all he wanted to do with that poodle was to play with him, he wasn\u2019t ready to bring a dog into the family. Every time Harry picked up a stray dog and begged her to let it in, she would drive it to the nearest shelter despite his cries and complaints.\n\nThis\u2026thing currently curled snugly at Harry\u2019s feet wasn\u2019t something she could drop off in the nearest shelter. With six purple eyes, eight pale, slimy tentacles, three barb-tipped tails, and two fang-filled jaws, it looked like a creation on Spore where the player was drunk on booze and high on weed. Or some eldritch abomination from a horror comic.\n\n\u201cMom, can we please keep Eyedar? He\u2019s a really cute puppy!\u201d\n\nAs Harry clasped his hands together to plead, the creature took one look and mimicked her son\u2019s action as best as it could with tentacles. When he resorted to the doe-eyed look whenever he was begging to have things his way, all six of its alien eyes bulged in a bizarre attempt to copy a puppy face, with two whip-like tongues hanging out by the sides of its jaws.\n\n\u201cMom, Eyedar doesn\u2019t bark, and he\u2019s a clever boy who can clean up and take care of himself!\u201d\n\nRight on cue, as though it could comprehend the human language, Eyedar pulled a tissue from Harry\u2019s pocket and wiped the drool off its face, then slicked wild tufts of white hair back neatly with its tentacles, before shooting her a sly wink with all six eyes. It waggled its tails, a joyous toothy grin on each of its jaws as Harry stroked the smoothened fur on its head and praised it.\n\nHow adorably suave, Emily thought to herself, but she wasn\u2019t sufficiently impressed or moved to change her stance.\n\nWhat does that creature eat? Does it eat humans? What if it goes on to eat the neighbor\u2019s dog? Would anyone even know how to care for this thing at all if it gave them trouble? If its really just a \u201cpuppy\u201d, how big will it grow when it becomes an adult? Would it grow too big for them one day?\n\nEyedar reared up on two tentacles and hugged Harry, imploring gazes from the two small beings and a total of eight eyes between them. It seemed almost cruel to pull them apart considering how fond those two were of each other, but Emily\u2019s mind was made up.\n\n\u201cHarry, we\u2019re returning this little monster to where it belongs. Get in the car.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nEven though the eldritch god before her now wore a human face, the resemblance to that little tentacled monster was uncanny. She knew she was at the right place, there wasn\u2019t anyone else within a hundred miles with white hair, eyes the same shade of violet, or possessed many long tentacles she didn\u2019t want to count.\n\n\u201cIs Harry displeased with the new puppy I granted to him? He did mention you insisted on no dogs, so Eyedar here is an eldritch puppy from the Abyss, with some training and magical customizations on my part. Jerry, I would appreciate it if you could assist to retrieve the Wishlist so I may check what Harry specifically asked for.\u201d\n\nEyedar, who had been surprisingly well-behaved and quiet throughout the entire ride from her house to the church in the next town, now stretched out its tentacles toward its creator while whining incessantly. He took it into his arms and cuddled the monster as it curled a tentacle around his neck and calmed down. Harry ran from his mother\u2019s side to stand where he could continue to pet Eyedar who let out contented purrs.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to your kind intentions granting Harry\u2019s wish, Elvari, my son isn\u2019t ready for the responsibility of raising a pet, much less such an unconventional one. I\u2019m returning it to your care,\u201d Emily stated.\n\nHarry tugged at the sleeve of the god. \u201cPlease\u2026I really like Eyedar and he likes me too. You\u2019ll help convince my mom right? I promised my classmates I would be bringing a really cool pet to next week\u2019s show-and-tell! Even told them he would be as cute as you look awesome!\u201d\n\nEmily felt like a thunderbolt just struck her mind. \u201cYou were being too literal-minded when my son said \u2018he would be as cute as you look awesome\u2019, isn\u2019t it, that\u2019s why the creature has a bit of your likeness\u2026Well it doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s in your hands now. Harry, come, we\u2019re leaving without that little monster.\u201d\n\nA tentacle wrapped itself around Emily\u2019s ankle. She turned to shoot Elvari her most terrifying death glare, only to be greeted with a multitude of unblinking eyes from two eldritch entities, all staring deeply into her soul, intent on taking her on a long ride aboard the guilt trip.\n\n\u201cNow, now, it wouldn\u2019t be very nice if your son went to his show-and-tell empty-handed. Surely it wouldn\u2019t hurt if Harry brought Eyedar to school just for one day, then passed him back to me after class. Your son is free to visit and play with him anytime.\u201d\n\nEyedar cooed in his arms in agreement.\n\n\u201cHe can visit and play with your outlandish creation, but he\u2019s not taking that thing to school. If Harry loses control of it, nobody will know what to do because its just\u2026not normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cEyedar is well-trained and intelligent, he won\u2019t give you or Harry any trouble, you have my word. I can head down to his school and supervise if necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very reassuring coming from you.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t having any of this. Never caving in no matter what the voices in her head were whispering. No good reason to trust who her neighbors said was a god who embodied and induced madness. That freakish \u201cpuppy\u201d wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere near her house or staying with her son at all. Doesn\u2019t matter if that thing could clean up after itself, or how much intelligence or obedience its creator imbued it with. Until Harry developed some sense of responsibility, the only kind of pet she would allow is a pet rock. Even if he was ready for a pet, she couldn't see herself being ready for an eldritch pet in the house.\n\nShe shivered as a cold touch reached into her mind and lapped at her surface thoughts.\n\n\u201cHow about a painted pet rock with my sigil and signature on it instead?\u201d asked Elvari.\n\nEmily sighed, \u201cThat will be fine, but it\u2019d better be a perfectly ordinary rock with no magic and no tentacles.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!

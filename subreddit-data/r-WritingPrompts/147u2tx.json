            "comment": "Santa was quick to marshal the troops. Forthwith, six battalions of elves marched toward the man\u2019s shack. A humble trickle of black smoke filtered upward.\n\nBernard spat in the snow.\n\n\u201cCan you believe this man?\u201d Bernard said. \u201cUsing Santie Clause\u2019s coal to warm his balls or whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t know.\u201d Mary, a younger elf, said.\n\nBernard whirled on her.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know?\u201d Bernard said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know the big bearded fellow in the red and white suit with the sack of newly finished toys was Santie? He didn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\nBernard scoffed, rolling his eyes.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe he was focused on how cold he was. Maybe he wasn\u2019t thinking about Santie.\u201d Mary said.\n\nThe surrounding elves gasped. Bernard stopped his marching, causing Plippy to run into him.\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t thinking of Santie?\u201d Bernard said. \u201cIn The North Pole? Blasphemy aside, what could he think of? The snow? The cold? What could possibly go through his mind that he didn\u2019t know he was mugging good old Santie Clause?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Mary said to the ground.\n\nBernard scoffed again.\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Bernard trotted to keep up with his line of soldiers.\n\nThe six battalions proved rather\u2026 excessive. Six thousand elven soldiers were not needed to surround the piddly shack, the smoke still humbly trickling upward.\n\nA large majority of elves milled about, playing in the snow, shooting the breeze, or watching.\n\nCommander Peenky advanced with divisions two, three, and four of the third battalion.\n\nBernard and Mary were lucky enough to be among the first elves on the scene.\n\nBernard hefted his twenty cal. Mary prayed for the man\u2019s soul. Prayed for mercy.\n\n\u201cReady!\u201d Commander Peenky called, as it was a capital crime to steal from Santie.\n\nHundreds of rifles\u2019 had their safeties switched off.\n\n\u201cAim!\u201d\n\nThe rifles were levied toward the little cabin.\n\n\u201cFire!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Mary screamed.\n\nHer cry came far, infinitely far too late. Truly, even crying out an hour earlier could not have saved him.\n\nShe had seen the man through his window. Bernard assumed in a moment of womanly weakness, she couldn\u2019t bear to see a fellow living being killed.\n\nBernard pulled his trigger and felt the donkey kick his shoulder.\n\nA thin, reedy whine filled the air, and the blood of the elven army went cold. Mary retched.\n\nThe little boy cried and cried, his voice growing gradually wetter as blood leaked into his windpipe.\n\nIt seemed that the man had plenty on his mind to think of, other than Santie Clause.\n\nHe had used his body to shield his wife and two children, who were actively warming their frostbitten fingers when the volley launched.",

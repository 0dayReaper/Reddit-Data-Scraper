            "comment": "The demon's flames dwindled when I desperately screamed I was trying to make chicken soup. He gave a sigh of relief, and raised clenched fists. Clouds of tar-black smoke billowed out the crevasses of the floor and across the grotesque scars and wounds on his fiery skin, covering most of his body in dark, apron-shaped toxicity.\n\n\"Let's get to work, then!\" the demon said, and scanned the kitchen. \"What are we working with? What ingredients did you buy?\"\n\n\"I-I...chicken?\" I said, trying to compose myself. However, it was no easy task, I could see my worst nightmares through the demon's hollow eyes.\n\nHe came and stared at me, prodding my chest with a crooked forefinger, burning a hole on my shirt in the process. \"You. I like you. Every chef knows that a chicken soup is not a chicken soup without proper chicken. Tell me, where did you get the chicken, what breed of chicken is it?\"\n\nI froze, the smell of smoldering cloth pervading my nostrils. His face. It shifted every time I blinked. \"The supermarket, and... and I don't know the br-breed. A farm one?\"\n\nThe demon swung his hands exaggeratedly across the air, and the red of his skin changed to a scalding, glimmering orange, much like molten metal. Then, he drew a deep breath and nodded. \n\n\"I will tell you something,\" the demon said through gritted teeth, attempting to control his fuming wrath. \"First I loved you, but now I hate you. You are a man of wit. You know the ingredients of a chicken soup, but you are not a man of knowledge. To make a perfect chicken soup, you need the perfect chicken.\"\n\nHe eyed me, and crossed his four arms, as if waiting for me to answer.\n\nI frowned. What was I supposed to say? \"Where can we get a perfect chicken?\"\n\nHis eyes, mouth and nose disappeared, leaving only an eerie grin of unnatural curvature, length and razor-sharp teeth on his face. \"I'm glad you asked that.\" He made a circular motion with his hand, as if opening a faucet. A square-shaper portal of ever-flowing fire appeared between us.\n\n\"You first,\" the demon said. \"We are going grocery shopping.\"\n\n------------------------\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AHumongousFish/comments/90xn3h/one_hell_of_a_chicken_soup_part_ii/)\n",

Each episode is how the demon gets into funny shenanigans in order to fulfill the mundane orders of the average joes that accidentally summon him\n\nTo add more shenanigans we can have recurring characters (\"Really? You again?\") and/or make the characters meet each other and plan out elaborate schemes to thwart the demon... only to have him outwit them in some funny way\n\nNow we just need OP to deliver a script xd",

Once the world was all fleshed out, however, the writers had a concrete basis to create an exciting movie as opposed to doing simultaneous world building expansion alongside a poorly paced movie with shitty subplots. They allocated properly between mediums, so How to Train Your Dragon 2 only included the top tier stuff.   \n\n\nEven the TV show became good eventually, as standalone episodes each held less commitment than a full movie therefore mistakes in one episodes led to faster improvement of writing across the series of TV episodes than would occur across a series of movies.",

                    "comment": "### Part 2: How To Make Demon Soup\n\n\"Alright look. Per demon summoning rules I have to help you accomplish whatever your intention was at the time of summoning, so lets get this soup made so I can get the hell out of this dumpster of an apartment.\" \n\n\"Hey I know I suck at cooking, but to be fair this is the Manhattan and this is actually a decent apartment in the area.\" \n\n\"Wait really? Christ things have gone downhill here. Ok apartment aside, let's get some soup going.\" \n\nWith that the demon snapped his fingers. The birds outside the window froze in midair, the crazy homeless lady outside stopped ranting about the government putting listening devices in her ears, and for once in a lifetime no car horns could be heard in the middle of NYC. \n\n\"Did you just... freeze time?\"\n\n\"Yea look, good soup takes time. More time than you have before your date arrives. First up I want you to take that whole chicken out of the pot, put it in a roasting pan, and rub that baby with butter.\" \n\n\"But I'm making soup, why would we be roasting it?\"\n\n\"Oh look who knows so much about soup! The guy who was adding paper thinks he knows how to cook now! Are you 842 years old? Didn't think so, but guess what - the guy with the horns is, and I'm proud to say I'm a true demon in the kitchen. I guess I am outside as well, but whatever. We're roasting the chicken first so the flavors develop and the muscles loosen. Low heat first to break up the actin, myosin, and collagen in the muscles, then high heat next to char the skin and the bones. Ya gotta keep that heat high at the end so we allow the Maillard reaction to occur in the amino acids of the skin. It's gonna be delicious. Trust me.\"\n\nAn hour later the kitchen was smelling divine, contrary to the demon's origins. \n\n\"See kid? That brown crust is sugars forming. It's gonna sweeten the soup slightly allowing for the other flavors to become more pronounced. Now help me pull all the meat off this bad boy - toss all the meat in one pile, and the skin, bones, and connective tissue in another.\"\n\n\"Got it. Hey um, thanks for this.\"\n\n\"Hey it's only a fair trade for your immortal soul.\"\n\n\"Wait what?!? This was an accident I never agreed to anythi-\"\n\n\"Just fuckin' with ya kid. HEY what in my homeland are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm pulling all the meat off like you said and getting rid of the others. Clean as you go my grandma said!\"\n\n\"I SAID TWO SEPARATE PILES. Those bones you threw away are what's gonna make the stock, not those shareholder documents. Hand em over.\" \n\nThe demon took the bones in his mouth, and shattered each of them in turn. Spitting the remains into the pot along with the other bits.\n\n\"We're gonna simmer this real low for four hours. It's gonna pull all the flavors out and make it heavenly. Now go make some mirepoix while I tend to this\"\n\n\"I um...\"\n\n\"God I forgot I'm talking to an idiot - go chop up some carrots, onions, and celery. You can impress your date with your cooking knowledge now that you know what mirepoix is. It's the base for pretty much all western cooking.\"\n\n\"Yes sir Mr. Demon.\"\n\nA shriek pieced the ear moments later.\n\n\"WHY ARE YOU DROPPING IT IN THE STOCK?!\"\n\n\"Because it's going in the soup right?\"\n\n\"First off, we gotta strain that shit to get rid of those bones and other bits. What were you just gonna leave bone shards in the soup? Jesus I feel bad for your date. Second off, we yet again want to bring out the natural sugars in these things before we add them - now how do we do that?\"\n\n\"...through the mallard reaction?\"\n\n\"Maillard, but you know what I'll take it. Prep a pan with some butter and bring it up to medium heat. When that butter is *just* starting to turn brown, toss those veggies in along with some thyme and rosemary. Let it sit and stir every 3 minutes for 9 minutes. Then we'll set that aside along with our chicken until our stock is done.\"\n\n-------- \n\n\"Is it ready?\"\n\n\"Just about kiddo. Strain that stock and get rid of the bones and bits. After that toss everything in the pot and cook for another 15 minutes. That'll be plenty of time to let all the flavors blend together. My advice? Wait until the chick gets here to toss it all in. It'll make you seem like you know what you're doing more, and it'll give you time to talk up the dame.\"\n\n\"I don't think the word dame is in use anymore. It might actually be sexist now I think? It's kinda confusing what is and isn't.\"\n\n\"Kid I'm a demon. You think I care about that?\"\n\n\"Uh... yea I guess not.\"\n\n\"Hey for once you guessed right today. One more thing before I go - kid you may not have any experience in the kitchen whatsoever, but I really think you're a natural. You've got real talent for this.\"\n\n\"Wait really?\"\n\n\"No. Now go fuck off and don't summon me again.\"\n\nAnd with that the demon vanished.  ",

If you're making it, biggest suggestions are to use a meat thermometer to check the chicken. Do the initial roast at 150C/300F. When the internal temp hits about 65C / 150F, turn the temp of your oven as high as it can go (or even better, use the broil/grill function on the stove, but you'll have to flip the chicken halfway through with this) and keep cooking it til it's golden brown on the outside. The meat should come out perfect. \n\nAlternatively if you don't want to be in the kitchen all day, [debone the chicken first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfY0lrdXar8) and toss the remains into the stock pot while roasting the boneless chicken. I find the flavor to be slightly better roasting bone in, but it'll shave ~2 hours off the cooking time to do the broth and roasting in tandem. ",

            "comment": "Korbius, Demonlord of the Octopodiae, lay on the black and white linoleum tiles of Byron's kitchen, tentacles swinging wildly in the air. Removed from the blood waters of the Nether Sea, Korbius's gelatinous flesh sagged heavily towards the ground. Still he flailed his eight tentacles through the air angrily, slapping them wetly against pots and pans, suction cups sticking to whatever they touched and dragging them about the room. \n\nKorbius's nearly formless body blocked the only doorway out, and Byron, terrified, held his grandmother's handwritten cookbook in two hands out in front of him, as if it might act as a shield against the otherworldly creature. The ground is slick in Korbius's crimson slime and, when Korbius flicks one of his tentacles into the air, Byron is sprayed with a shower of the cold red goop. \n\nYou could say being covered in the bodily juices of a Sixth Dimensional Demonlord was the straw that broke the camel's back. Byron certainly felt that way and decided it was as good a time as any to start screaming.\n\n&gt; Be silent, human! Cease your mating call! This is no time for copulation! \n\nByron recoiled from the deep throated voice that suddenly came from inside his own head. He looked wild-eyed around the destroyed room. \"Who is that?! Help! Help me!\" \n\n&gt; Human, it is I, Korbius, Demonlord of the Octopodiae. Korbius speaks through your crude mind.\n\nByron understood none of this and screamed louder. Korbius was *not* having it.\n\n&gt; SILENCE! \n\nThe word was equal part mental yell as it was unrelenting command and it made Byron stop yelling in spite of himself. \n\n&gt; Where is Korbius, Demonlord of the Octopodiae?\n\nByron was hyperventilating in relative quiet and only managed each syllable he spoke between two or three quick breaths. \"You're...in...my...kitch...en...\"\n\n&gt; How has Korbius been summoned to Kitchen?\n\nByron tried to channel his mindfulness meditation and failed utterly. \"I...don't...know!\" His breathing began to slow down. \"I...was... I was reading... this book.\" Byron held the book up and a tentacle shot out and latched onto its cover, dragging it back toward Korbius through the mess of ooze on the floor. The gelatinous mass of demon octopus shifted on the linoleum, a process that created a series of ridiculous fart-like noises. Byron watched the absurd scene slack jawed as Korbius spun his central mass around and opened his single gargantuan eyeball. \n\nFor a moment, Korbius stared at the cover of the book held in his tentacle. Suddenly a high pitched whine emanated from the demon's beak and he flung the book back towards Byron as if it were a live hand grenade. \n\n&gt; The Demon Cantos! Impossible!\n\nByron looked down at the book as it slid across the slick, tiled floor and spun to a stop at his feet. On the hand written cover it said in big, warm letters, 'Gran's Cookbook.' It was his Grandma's hand written cookbook. She'd left it to Byron when she died, only a week earlier, along with a letter insisting that Byron learn her favorite recipes, passed down from generation to generation. \n\nSo Byron had decided to give it a try. He had been feeling a little under the weather, and so he chose to make a delicious pot of chicken soup. He broke out the old tome, opened it on the kitchen table and, going down the list of ingredients with his finger, he'd read each one aloud, a habit he'd formed when reading to help compensate for his dyslexia. \n\nNo sooner had he finished the final ingredient - 'a large pinch of salt' - than an extradimensional portal of pure light opened in the ceiling of the kitchen, out of which fell the writhing red mass of Korbius, the Demonlord of the Octopodiae. That was forty seconds ago.\n\nByron bent down and picked up the book, showing the strange octopus it's simple handwritten cover. \"This...this?  It's just a cookbook. My Grandmother, it's her *cookbook*. I don't understand.\"\n\nKorbius recoiled at the further sight of the tome, opening several kitchen cabinets with his tentacles, emptying them of their contents, and slithering his entire large mass inside them, just as an octopus might squeeze its entire body into a soda bottle. As he slithered into his impromptu hiding place, Korbius began to beg.\n\n&gt; Please, human. Korbius did not know. How could Korbius know he spoke to a Cantor? No, Korbius could *not* know. It is Korbius's honor to be in Kitchen. Korbius would *never* speak ill of Cantor human, or of Kitchen. Korbius is thrall to Cantor human.\n\nByron's heart began to settle down even as his mind raced at the sudden shift in tone. He turned the book around again and brought the cover very close to his face, staring at the letters written there. \n\nHe flashed back to his reading of the recipe. Hadn't he felt a strange thrill down his spine with each ingredient read? Hadn't his hands shook, almost imperceptibly, as they traced their way down the list?\n\nSuddenly, Byron's grandmother came to mind, old Nan, sitting in her lazy boy, smiling cheek to wrinkled cheek, and Byron could not tell whether the image was a memory or a message.\n\n\"I told you you were special Byron. That's why I left you my...cook book.\" \n\nShe winked, the image disappeared, and when Byron looked back at the front of the book, at the words written there, they were no longer written in plain black marker, and they no longer read 'Gran's Cookbook.' Rather, in effervescent gold ink, shining impossibly bright, even through the thin layer of Korbius's muck, bold, proud letters proclaimed a new title. \n\n\"The Demon's Cantos.\"\n\nAmazed, Byron flipped through the transformed pages and where once there was only blue inked recipes for pie and soups, now there was an illuminated manuscript of epic beauty, with pages of gorgeous illustrations, strange creatures and spells with astounding names and titles. \n\nWhere once there were ingredients, now there were words of power. Where once there was a recipe for chicken soup, now there was a page entitled \"To Enthrall An Octopodiae.\"\n\nKorbius was now safely ensconced in the corner kitchen cabinet, only his giant eye peering out from the dark through the cracked open cabinet door. With fear apparent even in his mentally transmitted voice, Korbius asked.\n\n&gt; What is my master Cantor's name?\n\nByron looked up from the astounding book, his face awash in the magical glow of it words, and swallowed a lump in his throat, his eyes wide with wonder and confusion. Nervously, he whispered an answer.\n\n\"Byron.\"\n\nAnd then he passed out.\n\n*******\n#### For More Legends From The Multiverse\n\n## r/LFTM\n\n********\n## Part 2 Below\n\n\n\n",

                    "comment": "## Part 2\n\n********\n\nByron's Grandmother sat across from him, knitting peaceably. Of a sudden, she looked up, as if she'd just noticed Byron sitting across from her, and she smiled that mischievous smile of hers.\n\n\"Now, look at you Byron.\" She said as she placed the two knitting needles on her lap. \"All those hours practicing your reading served you real good, didn't it?\"\n\nByron looked around the room and found that he could not bring it into focus, no matter how hard he tried. \"Where are we?\" \n\nNan looked down in her lap and her knowing smile turned inward. \"No time to go into *that* baby.\" Then she locked eyes with Byron and her face became serious, almost stony. \"You've got a lot of reading to do 'fore the Undoer comes.\"\n\nByron was getting used to not understanding anything. \"Undoer?\" \n\nAs he looked at her, the image of Nan began to fade around the edges, and then get all fuzzy in the middle, as if she were being viewed beyond thicker and thicker panes of glass. \n\n\"Find the Preceptor. He's waiting for you baby, at ole Blackbeard's grave.\"\n\nByron blinked. \"Blackbeard?\" He said, or thought, or thought he said. Nan dissolved into a haze before him, like disturbed ink in water. Byron could feel the pull of something, dragging him, some ephemeral part of him, back, somewhere. As he left the strange place, he caught a fleeting glimpse in the far distance. The hint of a shape, the suggestion of a form, the intimation of a face, burning eyes of sunfire.\n\nWith a gasp Byron came to on his kitchen floor. Hovering over him Korbius's bulbous eye was less than a foot away from his face, two of the demonlord's sloppy tentacles taking turns gently slapping at Byron's cheeks. The sight startled Byron and he screamed again. Korbius let out another high pitched squeal and raced back into Byron's now sopping wet wood cabinets. \n\n&gt; Master, although I fear it may cause you harm, if you truly wish it, I shall mate with you.\n\nByron pushed himself up onto his elbows, his whole upper body slick with Korbius's ooze, and stared, flabbergasted, at the single giant eye looking back at him from under his kitchen sink. \"What!?\"\n\n&gt;You're mating call, Master. It is like ten thousand needles in my ears, but if my master so demands it...\n\nByron cut off the giant octopus. \"I don't want to mate with you!\" He yelled. \n\nThe relief was visible in Korbius's single humongous eye. \n\n&gt; Oh, thank you Master. Thank you.\n\nKorbius sent out a single olive branch of a tentacle from a cabinet several cabinets away from the one from which his central eye peered out. The tentacle touched submissively at the tip of Byron's shoe. \n\nByron just stared at it for a second, totally overwhelmed, and then kicked it away. He struggled to get to his feet, slipping and sliding in the horrible mess of cephalopodic slime, as Korbius looked on helplessly. For a few seconds he slid and squeaked his way up, at last stabilizing himself against the back of a kitchen chair.\n\nStanding at last, Byron looked around the room and took silent stock. What had been a neat and tidy kitchen only a few minutes ago now looked like an explosion in the Jello factory. The refrigerator had toppled over, sending glass bottles, milk and juices, splattering onto the floor, where they swirled together with the half inch layer of whatever the hell it was that Korbius continued to exude from his skin. Every one of Byron's plates and glasses were broken and his pots were flung everywhere, including several embedded into the sheet-rock walls. To top it all off, Byron watched as Korbius reached up, turned on the kitchen sink, slithered through the cabinets, removed the sink's U-bend with a tentacle, and positioned his large eye under the free flowing water, which then poured into the room. \n\nIn the middle of all the chaos, seemingly undamaged, even untouched, almost as if it were protected somehow, Nan's book lay waiting, glowing intensely, as if it was eager to share its secrets.\n\nFrom inside the cabinet, his eye wide under a stream of warm tap water, all of which subsequently streamed down his gelatinous flesh and onto the kitchen floor, Korbius chimed in unhelpfully.\n\n&gt; What now Master Byron?\n\nByron broke his gaze away from the strange book and looked down at his ooze saturated clothes. He began to run his right hand through his hair, a nervous tick of his, but stopped midway and lowered the hand to his side, absolutely covered in Korbius's cold jelly. \n\nLooking like he'd just fought his way out of the belly of man sized flan, totally deadpan and drained beyond belief, Byron carefully walked out of the room. \"I need a shower.\" He muttered as he left.\n\nWhen Byron had left the room, Korbius's central mass shrunk in relief. He set about closing all the cabinet doors with his tentacles and continuing his own peaceful shower under Byrons broken sink. Korbius was about to close the final cabinet door when his giant eye caught a glimpse of the Demon's Cantos glowing in the ooze. Korbius felt it was altogether too close for comfort, and so he picked up a pot with a tentacle and used the pot to push the book as far away from him as he could. \n\nThat done, Korbius, Demonlord of the Octopodiae shut the final cabinet door, ensconced himself in calming darkness, and cursed his awful luck. \n\n*****\n\n## r/LFTM\n\n- Note: I've been reading Joseph Campbell recently in an effort to get better at longer form story telling, rather than just flash shorts, and I think that the Demon's Cantos should make a good exercise for me in crafting a story within the framework of the monomyth structure. To that end, I think I will be continuing this story on my sub - Legends From The Multiverse. However, given that it will be a project directly related to my reading and understanding of a separate text, it may not come out frequently, and parts may also be revised, or earlier parts added, to better and more completely match the standard elements of the monomyth structure. I'm enjoying it so far though, and to the extent some of you have enjoyed these two parts, perhaps you might also enjoy watching that process unfold. \n\n## Thanks, as always, for reading!  \n",

            "comment": "**\"- and then I said, IT'S A PINEAPPLE!\"** bellowed the bubbling pot of viscous orange and swirling obsidian black that seemed to emit its own glow. The voice sounded distant and distorted like it came through a radio between channels. The soup already looked nothing like grandma's, the last thing I needed was for it to start talking-\n\nBefore I could finish the thought, every hair on my body stood on its end. A threatening crackling of what sounded like static filled the room along with a growing odour of petrichor and sulphur. \n\nI didn't even have time to process my confusion when I was lifted off my feet. The pestle and mortar, cutting board, mixing bowl, chopper, anything that wasn't bolted to the ground, spontaneously decided to defy gravity at the instant. Everything kinda just hung peacefully a few feet in the air before, with an ear-splitting crack that sounded like the very fabric of the universe was being torn apart, everything was thrown violently against the far wall. The chopper I had been using landed inches away from my face and mockingly flicked garlic and chilli juice in my eye. It really hurt.\n\n**\"what the... Where the fuck- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU\"** A voice that sounded like the earth itself was rumbling, while also grating like a thousand nails being pulled against a chalkboard, poured forth and pushed against my mind from where I was standing. \n\nI look up at where my stove used to be with my good eye, and it looked like a bomb had gone off in the pot. I guess my grandma was some sort of terrorist who kept recipes for explosives in her cookbook. \n\nIt was then that I noticed that the black shape against my wall wasn't charred plaster, but some kind of... Entity. The voice had been coming from it whilst the shape twisted and pulled around hesitantly, looking almost... Confused.\n\n\"I.. I'm... I'm Aleister?..\" I offered.\n\n**\"Hm...\"** the shadow rumbled. \n\nIt's hard to describe what happened next. The darkness swirled around and spit forth a... Person? Dressed in a dark, blood red three-piece suit that didn't interact with light quite right, he was lanky and had his hair slicked back. I can't describe his features for the life of me. It's like my brain just can't process the information. What I do know is just looking at him was extremely unsettling. My fight or flight was turned to 11 and every fibre in my body reeled from some primal fear. I quickly averted my gaze and tried to rub capsaicin out of my poor eyeball.\n\n**\"It's been over 400 years since one of your kind managed to summon me, *Aleisterrr*. I was getting quite comfortable with the idea that your race had just lost the knowledge.\"**\n\nThe person(?) picks up a charred apple off the ground and twirls it around a bit while inspecting it. He shrugs, rubs it on his vest, and at some point during his exceedingly elegant manoeuvre, the apple had turned back into a bright red. He takes a noisy chunk out of it.\n\n**\"Mmm.. Real..\"** *crunch* **\"food\"**\n\n**\"So what is it you want? Immortality? Omniscience? The gift of prophecy? Telepathy?\"** He quipped while tossing the apple around in parabolas that defied the laws of physics. Or reality for that matter.\n\n\"I... I was just trying to make some chicken soup.\"\n\n**\"Chicken.. Soup? HAHAHAHAHAHA I like you Aleister. You know, everyone who has gotten as far as you have always thinks they're the fucking shit. It's always 'BOW DOWN BEFORE ME'; 'CALL ME MASTER; or some shit like that. A quirk of your species, I guess. But yeah. No one has ever cracked a joke as his opening gambit. I appreciate that. I'll go out of my way for you, Al.\"**\n\nI was still against the wall, propped up on my left elbow from the blast. I suddenly realised the position was hurting me and shifted my weight to get up.\n\nBefore I managed to even shift my weight, the person had somehow moved beside me and was helping me to my feet. The touch of his hand felt like someone had touched a white-hot iron to it, but it also felt intensely cold, like the void of the universe was pressed up against my skin.\n\nI yelped and pulled my arm back.\n\n**\"Oh sorry, Al. Like I said its been a while since I've dealt with a human. I forgot that happens.\"**\n\nI inspect the part of my arm his hand made contact with expecting an egregious wound. There was nothing.\n\n**\"Don't worry about that. I can't harm your flesh. And any damage contact with me does do wouldn't bother you too much if you're at the stage of summoning Elder Ones anyway. I'm surprised it even hurt you to begin with. Perhaps the scales of power have shifted over the last few centuries. Which reminds me... So.. *How* did you manage to summon me?\"**\n\nHis eyes narrowed to slits and this pupils shot around astutely.\n\n**\"I don't see the Antikythera Cosmomanipulator, so you couldn't have artificially amplified your races' limited magick... What's the alignment today?.. Hm... I guess it was an advanced ritual? But this place looks too small to harvest the blood of 42 virgins... Wait... One of the *Old Spells*??\"**\n\nHe clicked his tongue thoughtfully, then took a deep sniff.\n\n**\"I don't detect the stench of the Vatican's vaults so it can't be the... OH!! DID YOU DECODE THE NECRONOMICON? YOU CLEVER DEVIL, YOU!\"**\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n**\"Ah.. You're a young one. Perhaps the name *Voynich Manuscript* might ring a bell?\"**\n\n\"N.. Not really, no..\"\n\n**\"Hm... Curiouser and curiouser. If you're keeping the information from me for fear that I will take it away from you, I assure you I cannot do that. We can only act in accordance with directions given by the steward who summons us.\"**\n\n\"I... Don't know what's going on, man... I was just trying to make chicken soup using my grandmother's recipe book...\"\n\n**\"So you weren't joking...\"**\n\nHe walked over to my grandmother's recipe book which looked suspiciously unscathed compared to the rest of my kitchen.\n\n**\"Wait... Al, is your grandmother's last name B\u00e1thory?\"**\n\n\"Yes?..\"\n\n**\"HAHAHAHA FUCKING LIZZY. Oh man. Where is she? Wait till the rest of the guys hear about this. That little wench.\"**\n\n\"She's.. Dead, sir.\"\n\nThe gentleman's face dropped and palpable sadness filled the devastated kitchen.\n\n**\"Liz... Dead?.. But... How?.. Tell me everything you know, child\"**",

            "comment": "Two things I should tell you about my recently deceased Gran. First, she was a bit eccentric, but harmlessly so. Second, she had a penchant for writing everything down--recipes, reminders, phone numbers, you name it. So it came as little surprise that when she passed, she had willed me a cookbook among other things. \n\nI figured I'd try a recipe one rainy fall afternoon, and I thumbed through the cookbook looking for something tasty to ward off the cold. *Bingo, chicken soup!* I smile fondly as I remember Gran cooking it for my sister and I when we were younger. I read the ingredients aloud to myself--a habit born in recent years from forgetfulness--and as I reach the bottom of the list, a blackish-purple light appears above my stove. The light grows brighter and bigger, and eventually, *something* steps out of the light and onto my stove. Had I not been equally shocked at it's appearance and annoyed by the now completely melted stove top, I'd have been struck by this being's beauty. Whatever it was, it was the most ravishing thing I had ever seen.\n\n\"Mortal. You are barely into adulthood, and you have brought me to your realm. How is it you have done this?\" The being's voice was smooth as silk and light as a feather, but simultaneously instilled a deep uneasiness within me. I gather what's left of my wits as I try to think of a response. \n\n\"I was cooking dinner...\" I say confused. \"I was reading the ingredients for my Gran's soup, and...\"\n\n\"A moment, mortal.\" The being appraises me now with a mix of hesitation and respect. \"The book you read from. Was it your grandmother's?\"\n\n\"Yes, but how did you know--\"\n\n\"You read of Her writing and summoned me without destroying yourself utterly, although I cannot say the same of your summoning platform. You ARE of Her blood, then.\" The being now smiled, and this time as it spoke, I no longer felt the sense of dread. Rather, I felt completely at ease and began to get a good look at whatever (or whomever) just wrecked my stove. It was as though every single person I'd ever found attractive--woman AND man--had somehow merged into one being and could cycle through them as one shuffled through songs in a playlist. \"It has been quite some time since I have visited the realm of Earth. I am honored to be in your presence, Awakener.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Awakener? What do you mean by that? Who are you?\" The look of confusion on my face must have amused it, and it smiled and giggled.\n\n\"Only an Awakener can call upon my kind. The uneducated among you mortals would call us daemons, but your grandmother was one of the few to understand our true nature. We exist in the minds and hearts of all mortals, manifesting as your need to procreate, your hearts' desires, and what you call your libido. However...\" It pauses and looks me over with a sultry grin. \n\n\"However...?\" I inquire, my irritation at my destroyed stove lessening and being replaced with all manner of pressing questions and thoughts.\n\n\"Some mortals were wise enough to realize what we were. What our true power is. What we can do for you mortals...and what we can do *to* you.\" It smiled again, and began to speak once more in an almost lusty growl. \"My kind have no true name...only what the Awakeners call us when they summon us. Your grandmother called me Chrysanthemum--Chrys for short. But now that I am yours, you must give me a name of your own choosing. Do this, mortal, and I am yours.\"\n\n*That'd finally explain all the chrysanthemum shrubs Gran used to grow...* I muse to myself. I take a moment to gather my thoughts. My Gran, the sweetest, most innocent old lady anyone ever knew, was some kind of summoner (or Awakener) and a recipe for chicken soup had brought forth both the destruction of the best stove I'd ever had along with a being that was humanity's lust made manifest. And now this being was offering itself to me in exchange for a simple name? I finally spoke up, breaking the silence. \n\n\"I would call you Dahlia. It's a flower too, and I think Gran would like that.\" I grin slightly as Dahlia moves closer to me. \"So...what now...?\"\n\n\"First we must repair your summoning platform. I would ask your forgiveness, Awakener; when we are first brought forth into the mortal realm, the process can be damaging. But the first time is always the most difficult, yes?\" It giggles at its own joke. \"To summon me now, simply say my name when alone, and I can come to you.\"\n\n\"Hmm...OK.\" I pause a second. \"By the way, you can call me Douglas. The whole 'Awakener' thing sounds a bit medieval.\"\n\n\"Of course, Douglas.\" As it says my name, I feel blood rush through my body and I feel a warmth inside my chest as Dahlia approaches and embraces me. \"Let us repair your platform, and afterwards, we shall begin your Guidance. I have *ever* so much to teach you.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**This went somewhere I didn't think it was gonna go, but I had fun writing it. Feedback's appreciated--I've written for a few prompts on here over the months, and I'm thinking of writing more regularly on here.** ",

Apparently, he thought, being summoned was quite rage inducing. \n\nAdam empathised with the demon. After all maybe it was in the middle of a challenging game of tennis, or had just won the money hand at strip poker with a particularly lively blonde bombshell. Demons could be hot blondes, that made sense, being hell and all. Right? Adam's side-tracked thoughts kept him from really paying attention to the demon's critique of his chicken soup. Adam thought he'd heard half of a rant about how you really shouldn't be using bloody goat steaks in chicken soup and neither the devil's wort herb nor the eye of newt (apparently a nickname for peppercorns?) were not standard ingredients either. \n\nThis really didn't bother him, last time something like this happened he met Trafengalore the Dragon, Lord Supreme of the 12th Plane of Torment. Cool guy, not big on inside voices but he was really helpful in getting Adam back to Earth. Word of advice folks, walking to your kitchen can be hazardous when you're not a clever man. \n\n\"Anyways kid. My name is Shaghfrl'ee the Gluttonous. I'd love to help you out with this chicken soup deal you've got going on here.\" Adam thanked him, grateful for the assistance. Two hours later the kitchen had an amazing smell wafting around as the two ate a spectacular chicken soup. Shaghfrl'ee was apparently kind of awesome at cooking. ",

The legions of the damned saw their opportunity, lunged for freedom.\n\nThe lone figure standing in the charred remains of a kitchen looked understandably distressed, in the way of someone whose first foray into making soup resulted mostly in water vapour and a portal to hell.\n\nThis whole mess had more or less started with an minor accident. Not his accident, which could be likely categorized as \"quite a big deal\", but rather his gram's injury, which had left her with a bad leg and a worse temper. \n\nIn a fruitless attempt to pacify her, he'd decided to try and make some soup, borrowing an old cookbook he'd found lying on the fridge.\n\nNow, he didn't have all too much experience with cooking, so he figured he would compensate with fanatical allegiance to the recipe. \n\nWhen the recipe demanded he whisper forbidden words in long-dead tongues, he'd figured it was probably something like how talking to plants made them grow more. When it called for tears of the innocent, he'd rubbed some onion into his eyes and hoped that shoplifting once didn't count against his innocence. When it called for the blood of a virgin, well, that one sorted itself out neatly.\n\nWhen he had nearly finished the recipe, readng one of the final steps, he was taken aback. \"Shatter the veil? What does that ev-\"\n\nIt was then that the pot collapsed into itself and the screaming started.\n\nHis head pounded. All around him, it felt as though reality itself was opening in directions his mind could not comprehend. A thousand discordant voices flooded into his thoughts, each of them whispering his name.\n\nTry as he might, he couldn't quite convince himself this was part of the recipe.\n\nShortly after having surged through the opening created by the soup, the demon realized his mistake.\n\n\"Oh no no, not this place, NOT AGAIN! Some poor moron always takes the bait, and this time it's me!\" it yelled, in a panic rather unsuited to its form.\n\nThe demon's many eyes darted about, looking for an exit. Seizing upon a nearby window, it jumped at it, and crashed headfirst into an invisible barrier.\n\nIt was then that the demon noticed him.\n\n\"Hang on. You aren't her.\" it hissed at him.\n\n\"No?\" he replied, unsure of if he should be offended.\n\n\"Well then, how in the seven hells did you summon me at all?!\" it roared.\n\n\"I don't know! I was trying to make soup!\" he yelled back. The man was very much nearing his breaking point. Making soup was the nice thing to do, and he would not be accepting criticisms from a goddamned monster.\n\n\"Tell you what, human.\" said the demon, adopting a more gentle tone. \"You set me free, and I will make you the best soup in all the worlds.\"\n\nBefore he could reply, the twang of a bowstring\u00a0 interrupted him, as a bolt flew into the demon's body. Man and demon looked on with surprise across the room at the aging woman brandishing a crossbow.\n\nAs the demon slumped to the ground, still looking confused, the man's grandma limped over to the kitchen.\n\n\"Thanks for preparing the ingredients, sweetie. Now run along to the living room and I'll finish things up.\" she told him, with a terrifying smile.\n\nNot being one to argue at this stage, he hurried over to the couch and tried desperately to not listen to the sounds of what he prayed was not\u00a0 something being butchered.\n\nTwenty or so minutes later, his grandma called him back and offered him a steaming bowl of soup. Biting back his revulsion at the likely demonic meat in his soup, he swallowed a bite, and paused for a moment.\n\n\"Huh. Tastes like chicken.\"",

We met when he helped me fix a chicken soup recipe that had gone badly wrong and then it turned out that every time I used that hob it opened a gate to Hell and dragged him into my kitchen.  \n\nAnd because that always happened, and Father O'Flannery is getting a bit old for three exorcisms a week, we decided that we'd just hang out like friends.  But he's super-cute, if a little hairy, and really attentive.  Pretty much the opposite of Brian, if you can imagine that.  I know Abraxiel, Tormentor of the Lost and Captain of the Host of Megido, isn't my normal type but you have to look past stereotypes and try new things!  \n\nAnyhow, Abraxiel is really widening my horizons.  He's really into art and very in touch with his feelings.  Like, remember how Brian used to compete with, like, every guy in the room?  Abraxiel doesn't do that.  He's so secure in who he is, it just gives me the space to really be me, you know?  All that being what it is, we didn't stay \"just friends\" very long.  I find it really hard to say no to him!  But I know what you're thinking and no! We haven't!  I mean, I want to (so bad!) but Abraxiel is an old fashioned kind of guy and he wants to wait until I'm ready to commit.  And I'm nearly ready.  We complete each other.  He's such an old soul, and he says he can see how beautiful MY soul is, and he wants to be around it for all eternity, and O know he means it which is just off the charts romantic!  \n\nI can't wait for you two to meet!  \n\n",

The recipe for this particular chicken noodle soup was extensive and detailed. It was the 4th such recipe for chicken soup in nana\u2019s cookbook but it was by far the most detailed. Obviously I had to try recreating it!\n\nNana was nothing short of magically gifted in the kitchen. She was renowned in her community for being the best chef and baker around. She single handedly funded the community fire hall, after school club, and the quilters guild with her annual bake sales. Naturally I wanted to channel nana\u2019s talent and hone my cooking skills. Even if it was only for a rainy afternoon bowl of soup.\n\nAs I finished my final stir and set the old wooden spoon on the stove there was a flash of lightning followed by a resounding *BOOOOOM* of thunder. At the same moment the soup came to a hard boil threatening to bubble over the top of the pot. Quickly I reached for the temperature dial and flicked it off. In my haste I didn\u2019t fully register how odd it was for the soup to boil over on a low simmer. \n\nWith the heat off and the soup simmering I began my clean up as nana\u2019s recipes always left  quite the mess in the kitchen. While settling nana\u2019s cookbook back into its space on the top shelf of the panty I heard a rattle and a clatter behind me. \n\nTurning with cookbook in hand I was greeted with a puff of smoke.\n\n\u201cOhhhh, it\u2019s been a while\u2026 Wait, you\u2019re not - How? How were you able to summon me?\u201d\nIn a state of shock and panic I could only reply with a frantic \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know!! You were supposed to be chicken soup!!\u201d\n\nStanding stock still with nana\u2019s cookbook in hand I studied the demon, and the demon studied me. Immediately I knew he was a demon. Red skin, horns, a tail, he has all the tell-tale signs of a demon. But I couldn\u2019t help but notice that he had a hair net tangled in his horns, and he was wearing an apron with \u2018kiss the cook\u2019 emblazoned on the front. \n\nAs I stood in a state of shock I could hear a bustling in the other room as nana was coming to check on me. She entered the kitchen and in typical nana fashion she turned to me with an exasperated, \u201cohhhh hunny! What have you been doing in here? If you wanted soup you know I could have whipped it up for you!\u201d\n\nConfused by the happenings of the last 5 minutes I asked nana the first thing that came to mind, \u201cnana, why are you not freaking out right now?! There\u2019s a 7 foot demon by the stove?\u201d\n\nNana to her credit took it in stride, \u201cOh hunny, that\u2019s just Sebastian. He\u2019s my kitchen demon. He and I enjoy cooking together sometimes. Hello Sebastian.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi Agnes. Hello to you as well, young one. Sorry about the entrance there. Usually I only get calls from Agnes. I\u2019m Sebastian, and you might say I\u2019m a demon in the kitchen.\"\n \nClearly I was losing my mind. But nana\u2019s presence had a calming effect on me and I was able to stammer out an ineloquent \u201cUh\u2026 hi Sebastian? Nana\u2026 Are you a fucking witch?!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh hunny, don\u2019t be so dramatic. I\u2019m nothing of the sort. But I am a quarter Angel and Sebastian here is an old friend from the 3rd ring of hell. We both have a fondness for cooking and baking and we do enjoy collaborating every now and then.\u201d\n\nAnd without missing a beat and with a twinkle nana continued, \u201cSweetie, why did you think everyone always says my baking simply divine? Now Sebastian now that you\u2019ve met my little pumpkin why don\u2019t we whip up a quick Devil\u2019s food cake to have after our soup.\u201d\n\nAnd that was how I discovered nana\u2019s secret kitchen demon. \n",

I'm the worst cook ever. I once set my place on fire while making cereal,\" I said. \"I tried making something out of this recipe book that my grandmother passed down, and now look what happened!\"\n\nI sat down in a defeated slump. Surveying my surroundings, the place was all burned down. Everything in the kitchen was burned to a crisp, and the floor was on fire.\n\n\"Great, now I have to move again. And I just got here too!\" I shouted.\n\n\"Hey, hey,\" the demon said, crouching down and putting his hand on my shoulder in a comforting gesture. \"Why are you so sad? I figure there must be something else to this. I mean seeing as how you aren't freaking out about summoning a demon into your kitchen, there is something seriously wrong with you.\"\n\n\"It's just that I never do anything right,\" I said, looking up at the demon. \"Everything I do just goes up in flames. Literally.\"\n\n\"Well here,\" the demon said, and then he snapped his fingers and the everything returned back to normal. No fires, the furniture was back, and there were no burn marks on anything.\n\nEyes wide, I got up and my tears stopped.\n\n\"How did you -\" \n\n\"I'm a demon kid. I can practically do anything.\"\n\n\"Then can you help me make chicken soup?\"\n\n\"Sure, now let me see you try again.\"\n\nHope filled my body with warmth as I felt the kindness of the demon. He was wiling to do so much for someone who just summoned him while trying to make chicken soup. I vowed to get it right this time, and follow the recipe to the tee.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, grabbing the recipe book one more time.\n\n\"Now what's the first step,\" the demon asked, looking around the kitchen for the pots and pans.\n\n\"First, grab your summoning stick and then make a big star on the floor,\" I read out.\n\n\"Wait what?\"\n\n\"Then take the blood of your enemies and draw a circle around the star.\"\n\n\"Hold on -\"\n\n\"Then repeat this enchantment 3 times: nez requiem das jorbas\"\n\n\"GIVE ME THAT!!\" the demon said, leaping towards me and grabbing it out of my hands.\n\n\"THIS IS NOT A RECIPE BOOK!\" the demon shouted at me.\n\n\"What do you mean? Yes it is, my grandmother said so,\" I replied. \"And it even says so on the title page. 'Recipe Book'.\"\n\n\"'For Summoning Demons and Monsters - Advanced'\" the demon replied.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"RECIPE BOOK FOR SUMMONING DEMONS AND MONSTERS - ADVANCED!!!\" the demon shouted back at me. \"This is a summoning book kid!! And here I was feeling all sorry for you. Did you bother reading the entire title?\"\n\n\"Well not exactly ~\" \n\n\"Sigh, kid. Just never cook again. Or anything for that matter.\" the demon said.

            "comment": "A combined effort between myself and u/Compodulator\n\nThe evening was average in every way possible. Mundane. Boring. No rain, no wind, no snow, not even a car on the street or a bark of the occasional stray dog. I could see the neighbor\u2019s lights through my own window, but covered with a curtain, I could not see further than the window. A message from my father saying he wants to come for a visit came to my phone about two hours ago. He was, and still is what you would call \u2018old school\u2019, a firm believer that a good host is to prepare an elaborate, large, fulfilling dinner. There was, of course, an issue with this idea: I am not a cook. I am the absolute polar opposite of a high-grade chef. Last time I tried cooking, without any particular effort, I managed to blow up an omelet. How, I will never know. Eggs, salt, some butter and a frying pan equal explosion in my hands it seems. Tonight will be difficult.\n\nI pulled out the recipe book grandma had given me during her vain attempt at teaching me to cook. I flipped through, and found something that I was sure, even I, couldn\u2019t manage to screw up. Chicken soup. It called for stock, carrots and celery, and chicken. Simple. *I got this,* I told myself. I had nothing in the refrigerator, as not being a suitable cook, I just ordered takeout every night. I guess I would have to run to the store. I glanced at my watch, Dad would be here in another two hours. Why had he decided to visit tonight? And why had he not given a more advanced notice? I hopped into the car and sped to the local supermarket.\n\n\u201cHey, Jef.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Hopkins. We were friends\u2026 well, not exactly friends-friends, more like kind-of-don\u2019t-hate-each-other friends back in college. Back in the day we were all inspired by all the \u201cdocumentaries\u201d we saw about regular joes inventing world changing devices. Sure, we then learned that \u201cThe Short History of the World\u2019s Greatest\u201d was not, in fact, a documentary but some kiddie show made by teachers who clearly lost their minds.\n\n\u201cKevin! Another party going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot\u2026 exactly\u2026 My father\u2019s coming to town for some reason and I have to set him up with a dinner.\u201d\n\nHe posed dramatically as a ballerina in mid spin \u201cThe great chef, Kevin Jamesonvichtkin will now prepare a ten-star meal and not blow up the place up for a change?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, that was one time! Five years ago! Will you let it go already?!\u201d\n\nJesus, you fuck up once, and the world never forgets. He even posted the aftermath on InstantenousGrammaphone and refused to get them off before he got ten thousand likes. It took two weeks.\n\nI glanced around the store. I knew where the liquor and the party snacks were, but\u2026 actual groceries? I had no clue. \n\n\u201cSo Jef, where uh... Do you keep the vegetables and chicken? Also, what is stock?\u201d Jef snorted, I\u2019m sure already thinking about his next post, wondering how he could get himself invited to this dinner. \n\nJef showed me the way around the store, making snide comments about how he didn\u2019t understand how I didn\u2019t even know the difference between different cuts of chicken meat. He did explain that stock was basically water that had chicken bones and meat boiled in it until it had chicken flavor, but he also handed me a bottle of bouillon cubes, which he explained were like chicken salt. I checked out at a register that Jef opened just for me and walked to my car. I was dreading cooking this soup, and I was running out of time before Dad arrived, as he would expect to eat as soon as he arrived.\n\nI take a look at my watch. An hour. Not much, but it has to do. My phone helpfully told me that soup is a bunch of edibles in water, boiled, and served in a bowl warm or lukewarm. That\u2019s really helpful, Jenkins, thank you, now how about some real help?\n\n\u201cAlright, so what goes where?\u201d\n\nSilence. I groan and try again \u201cExcuse me, Jenkins, what goes where in a soup?\u201d\n\nDing! \u201cWhen preparing a soup, the edibles must be cut into proportionally medium size before being put in a pot and boiled with water.\u201d\n\nThese smartphone features should be renamed to \u201csmartASS features\u201d. Back to grandma\u2019s old book it is, I guess. I gently put the car in the driveway and make my way back inside. The book is right on the counter, where I left it before trying to go and get some help from Jef. I pick it up and go through it haphazardly, looking for the \u201cthe most perfect chicken soup known to man\u201d chapter. This thing looks like it survived at least two world wars and one returning of Christ.\n\nI find the chapter and read through the instructions twice. It says to *saut\u00e9* the vegetables. Whatever that means. \n\n\u201cJenkins, what is saut\u00e9?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is where vegetables are cooked on high heat in a pan until they soften.\u201d \n\nI figure I\u2019ll save time and put the pot on the stove and turn the heat on. I set the book down next to the stove and turn to cut the carrots and celery. I hold the knife in my best impression of a serial killer and get to work. Those vegetables never stood a chance. When I turned around to put them in the pan, the edge of the book was smoking from where I had left it too close to the edge of the stove. I move it and drop the chopped carrots and celery in the pan. Within seconds they are smoking too! \n\nI grab a spoon and shove them around trying to prevent them from catching on fire. It\u2019s in vain though, as the vegetables on bottom are charred and smoking, and the ones on top are raw. Then the book, which had continued to smoke, caught flame. I turned to deal with it, knocking the pan to the ground. The poor chopped vegetables fall to the ground and scatter, and the ones stuck to the pot also burst in flame. I panic and back away, tripping in the process, nonsensical words flying from my mouth. \n\n\u201cMa ze ha hara aze kus ommok?!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a phrase I picked up from Dungeons and Dragons. The supervisor doesn\u2019t really like it when I use actual \u201cswear words\u201d, as she puts it, so as part of my \u201crehabilitation program\u201d she clearly pulled straight out of her ass, I am now supposed to use this particular phrase instead of good ol\u2019 fashioned \u201cfuck\u201d. I\u2019m not paid enough to deal with her.\n\nI divert my gaze from the stove for a moment to roll on the floor and find my balance again. Doesn\u2019t work very well seeing as that one single celery apparently turned into a carpet bomb and covered the entire floor with its leaves. Or whatever that is. All I care is that it\u2019s apparently a great lubricant and I\u2019ll be introducing it to Jenny as an alternative to our usual stuff. When I finally grab ahold of the chair nearby and manage to climb up, the pot is already on fire. An impressive fire. At least three feet tall, scorching the ceiling and slowly spreading in a weirdly perfect circle around it. I dash downstairs for the fire extinguisher that is probably older than I am. On my way down I hear a dog of some kind barking as if it saw a squirrel. How the hell did a dog get in here? Why? Why now?!\n\nI get back and pull the pin, spraying all over the place without looking. The fire is gone, the ceiling is a mess, and there\u2019s a notably angry guy in front of me now. This is not a normal guy. Even if he\u2019s covered in foam, there\u2019s no way his head reaches the ceiling like that. Suddenly, I hear an ear shattering growl, followed by bellowing.\n\n\u201cPathetic mortal! You have awoken me from my eternal slumber! No longer trapped between life and death, I will grant you one last pleasure before I set this world ablaze!\u201d\n\nI blinked. I blinked again. What was that thing? He\u2026 No it\u2026 was staring down at me, and I was no small man, at 6\u2019 3. \n\n\"How? How were you able to summon me?!\" he screams down at me now. \n\nI run to the corner, where the still smoldering cookbook had been kicked. I start flipping through grandma's cookbook as fast as I can, and do the only thing I can think of, scream back, \"I don't know!! You were supposed to be chicken soup!\" \n\nIt blinked down at me, \u201cChicken soup?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, my dad is on his way, he wanted dinner, I don\u2019t cook, and this looked easy enough.\u201d I said in one quick breath. \u201cWhat are you by the way? How did you get in here?\u201d\n\n(Continued below)",

I get a demon instead of a chicken soup.\u201d\n\nThe creature in front of me cackles, shaking the walls and foundation of the house \u201cYou did indeed! Swiftly now, mortal, what is it that made you summon me to your realm? Tell me your thoughts in these final moments of yours!\u201d\n\nI sit down on the chair nearby, slump on the counter, whimpering like a baby \u201cDemon\u2026 Naz\u2026 Naz-something\u2026 just soup\u2026 all I wanted is soup\u2026 why demon\u2026 why not soup?

My eyes travel around the burnt-out room, linger on this nearly 9-foot-tall demon, who is still covered head to toe in the foam from the fire extinguisher. I start laughing, maniacally I\u2019m sure, but I don\u2019t care.\n\nI can\u2019t stop, I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019ve gone around the bend, I\u2019m sure of it. The doorbell rings. The demon growls, but I get up and casually walk to open it. There is my father. Standing in a formal suit and tie, and here I am, covered in burn vegetables, and a demon standing behind me. I have yet to stop laughing. Not looking into the house, but seeing the state I\u2019m in, my father tries to speak to me. I can\u2019t hear him over my laughter. He slaps me, trying to get me to focus. I stop. My eyes go wide. I spin around, and the demon is still there, but on the table is two servings of chicken soup, ready and waiting.\n\nMy father slowly takes his hat off and nervously puts it on the table nearby.\n\n\u201cKevin\u2026 listen\u2026 if\u2026 if this is too inconvenient\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, please come in, don\u2019t mind the mess.\u201d as I walk back to the kitchen, or rather, what\u2019s left of it, I begin to chuckle to myself again \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019ve done my best, and well\u2026 here it is!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end of the world. I, personally, with my own two hands, have killed this earth. What is there to do but laugh? They say it\u2019s best to go out with a bang. I have no idea who they are, but they\u2019re right, aren\u2019t they? Ending the world is one hell of a bang. Ending the world with a bang after a fine meal, is an even better way! I can only hope the rest of the world knows what\u2019s coming. Heh\u2026 heheh\u2026 just\u2026 soup. The end is soup. Hah\u2026 hahahah\u2026 My girlfriend, Jenny was right after all, I\u2019m the world\u2019s biggest asshole after all!\n\nThe demon just stands quietly in the corner. He seems... confused, I think. Can demons be confused? Does it matter?\n\nI sat down at the table, my father and the demon watching me. I take a spoonful of the soup and taste it. It sucks. Its salty and gritty, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not chicken in it. That starts another round of laughter. The demon rolls his eyes, and promptly sets the world on fire. My last thought was that he called this \u201cChicken soup\u201d? Poor bastard had never had real soup before.\n\nu/Compodulator\n\nr/LandOfMisfits",

I held down the pages as I looked down at the name of the recipe.\n\n'Chicken Soup' With some writing scratched out just above it.\n\nLooking up I found the demon looming over me, a good half foot taller, eyes sunken in, a starry abyss that one could get lost in. Skin like obsidian, cracking to reveal pulsating flesh. It's chin was jagged, and nose crooked and large. It's eyes, well I assumed, were on the cook book, then it raised a hand, surprisingly human if you ignored the craggy skin.\n\nMy lips were dry, so I licked them, my eyes were watering so I blinked. Verging on a panic attack I took a shaky breath as it raised it's hand further above my head before a echoing clap resounded. It's hand impacted it's face. Not loud but a domineering sort of sound, demanding to be heard. I winced, stepping back, but the demon took hold of my wrist and pulled me forward, it's face twisted even further in incredulous anger.\n\n\"You daft imbecile,\" It shouted, rattling a nearby kettle, \"What brought you to a kitchen! Cursed by the very *concept* of sustenance, if not for luck, I can't fathom how you haven't starved!\"\n\n\"...So, uh, I know you're sorta angry-\" It's skin cracked with what I could only described as anger made into sound, \"-okay, a little more than sorta, buuuuut could you maaaaybe help me clean up?\"\n\nThe demon might have been terrifying in all the worst ways, but my wife would be another level of scary if she found the mess I made, plus the demon.\n\n...Probably more the mess.\n\n\"Are you an idiot perhaps? Have you no knowledge of what a demon does? It *deals*.\" It punctuated each word with a step before getting in my face, with a pungent scent indescribable.\n\n\"You summoned me with a purpose, subconscious but it is the purpose I'm to resolve as a demon.\" My brain slowly ticked as I started to understand what he meant.\n\n\"Yes, I'm a demon of gluttony, and I'm here to make that-\" It pointed to the frothing soup with *something* swimming in it, \"Into a dish that won't cause everything in this neighborhood to go utterly *insane*.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Wow.\" I muttered.\n\n\"Yes, 'wow'.\" It seemed to calm down marginally as it stalked over to the soup.\n\nA poignant silence took over the room for a good minute.\n\n\"This is supposed to be chicken soup correct?\"\n\n\"Uh. yeah?\"\n\nThough I thought I made some headway it was dashed by it's strangled cry, \"Then *why is there no* \\*\\*\\*chicken?!\\*\\*\\*\"\n\n...Knew I forgot something.",

I was about five minutes away from giving up the search. I had promised old granny to keep her most prized possession, but I didn't see the point in keeping it on my bedside table. My interest in that particularly strange heirloom had spiked though when the medication from the doctor didn't work after seven days.\n\nI could still hear her as if it were yesterday: \"If you ever get sick, this contains the best chicken soup ever made to treat a cold!\" So why not a give it a shot? I admit I was slightly confused about the instructions for that particular recipe. Why would it be important to add finely chopped garlic and ground pepper? Why cut the spring onions from left to right? Why a chicken that was alive the previous day? (I have to admit that living in a farming neighborhood came in handy for things like this.)\n\nSo here I was stirring the pot counter-clockwise when suddenly smoke started developing from the bottom of the pot. I had just turned off the heat so what the hell was going on? I instinctively grabbed the cookbook to look for clues in the recipe of what I might have done wrong. As I started backing away, the pot started glowing before vanishing in the huge amounts of smoke. I was frantically thinking about what to do when the pot exploded violently demolishing half of the kitchen, being replaced what could only be called a demon!\n\n\"How?

I removed it very carefully from a nook in our shack. \n\nIt was about this time I started getting hungry. Thankfully, I had planned ahead and cut the chicken's head off last night. This chicken's really do run around for a bit, as if they're possessed by some evil spirit. \n\nAnyways, I blew the dust off the cover of the book and saw\n\n \"Ye Olde Butcher: A Guide to Preparing Meat the Right Way\"\n\nA strange coincidence, but a welcome one. \n\nI flipped through the pages and heard sounds, terrible sounds. I still get chills thinking about it to this day. I pray I never here anything like that ever again, in this world or any other. \n\nI find a dish a simpleton peasant could make, and I start to read. At first, it seems normal. \n\nChicken breast\nWater \nHerbs and Spices for flavor \n\nBut then it gets weird. I'm reading all of this out loud, because that's how grandma reads her books. \n\n\"Eye of Newt\"\n\"Wormwood\"\n\"Pearl of Swine \"\n\n\"And a hint of potion number 66\"\n\n66...that sounded evil to me. And I should have stopped there. But the damage was already done. As I read each ingredient, they started to fly around the room and into the cauldron. \n\nWhat was in the pot before, I'll never know. \n\nBut I do know what came out of the pot. \n\nA massive Chicken, 8 feet tall, red eyes, and talons that would pierce armor. A fearsome beast. \n\nPossessed by a demon. \n\nI quickly stopped reading aloud and started to freestyle. I'd seen grandma do this a few times. \n\n\"Oh foul demon, go back to the pits of hell from whence ye came \"\n\nThe demon lost control of the body. A massive chicken fell to the ground, perfectly cooked. There was even Chicken Nuggets! \n\nBut my work here wasn't over.\n\n\"NEVER COME BACK TO THIS DOMAIN, OR ENTER THIS REALM WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE POPE, EVER AGAIN! \"\n\nI slumped down to the ground, exhausted. I summoned my remaining strength and forced myself to eat a nugget. \n\nAnd let me tell you this, before you stop reading. \n\nThose nuggets were the shit. ",

To my surprise, it seemed as though the entire thing transformed. The cover was now made of a stone-like material, and there were small stony spikes sticking out of the edges. The title no longer read \"Western Cookbook for Beginners\" but rather \"Demonic Spellcasting for Beginners\". In addition, the letters appeared to be written in fire, and yet they didn't burn my hands upon touching.       \n\n*Huh. Well this is cool. So I guess my grandma was one of those witches or something? Man, if she was alive I'd have so many questions.*         \n   \nThen, a thought occurred. I flipped to the page I was on before.

            "comment": "For several minute, all that escaped the prone form of Jason, lying on the floor was \u201cWHAAAAAAAAA.\u201d\n\nThe huge demon standing in front of him did not approve. It\u2019s no surprise that Jason was scared; after all, the demon\u2019s charred wings alone took up three-quarters of Jason\u2019s small kitchen. The remaining quarter of his kitchen was occupied by the blackened, yet imposing form of the muscular demon. \u201cYou gonna scream some more?\u201d Silence was Jason\u2019s only reply. The demon scratched his head, trying and failing not to scowl \u201cI take it this is your first time seeing a real demon? Let\u2019s get this going why don\u2019t we? In two hours I have a strategy meeting on the use of baked goods in fulfilling **His** will.\u201d\n\nJason glanced around his kitchen. With his cabinets turned to nothing but splinters, his kitchen looked as if a bomb had gone off in it. \u201cLook what you did to my kitchen!\u201d Even if he was scared, he knew he should probably mask his fear with anger. He could be intimidating to, right? The answer was no. He was also so mad that he\u2019d have to spend money to get take-out tonight.\n\nThe demon was also mad now. *What?! he thinks this is my doing?!* For a few seconds his previously grey body began to glow a dull orange, then a bright red. It took a few moments to get his anger back under control; but he just gritted his teeth and continued on, his skin returning to its normal grey. \u201cI didn\u2019t summon myself, you should know better. Remember to always summon Class IV demons in an area with at least ten feet by ten feet by ten feet of clear space!\u201d\n\nJason could sense that the demon was enraged, and he stepped back before he replied. \u201cWhat makes you think *I* summoned you?! I just wanted to make a casserole! My granny gave me this old cookbook, so I thought I\u2019d try this casserole recipe.\u201d\n\nThe demon shot Jason an annoyed look while he folded in his wings to make enough room to pace around. He tapped his chin as he pondered how it was he was summoned. \u201cA casserole? Did this casserole have any\u2026 \u2018interesting\u2019 ingredients?\u201d\n\nJason began pacing as well. He closed his eyes and tried visualizing the ingredient list. He had clearly forgotten that he held the recipe in his hands. \u201cOnly if you count the \u2018blood of a young lamb slain during a full moon on the 13th Friday of a month\u2019 as interesting.\u201d He pondered what he would be having for dinner now. Chicken Chow Mein? Tacos? Pizza? He knew he should focus, but the thought of a slice of triple cheese and meat pizza from Little Sicily made his whole mouth water.\n\nDumbfounded does not come even close to describing the look on the demon\u2019s face. It took several moments for the him to reply. \u201cHow in the nine levels of hell did you even get that?! Why would you even think that was an ingredient!?\u201d\n\nJason simple shrugged. \u201cI dunno. I thought maybe it was some odd French thing.\u201d There was a moment of silence as the demon just stared at him in disbelief.\n\nThe demon already knew the answer to his next question, but he asked anyway. \u201c\u2026 you\u2019re not exceptionally bright are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I- \u2026 no I\u2019m not,\u201d said Jason as he hung his head in defeat.\n\n\u201cWell, now that I know the \u2018interesting ingredient\u2019 I can tell you why I\u2019m here. You didn\u2019t just make a disgusting casserole, you also completed one of the most difficult demon summoning\u2019s in existence. I am Acassias, Demon Prince of Casseroles and other similar baked goods, including but not limited to: pies, cobblers, and crackers!\u201d exclaimed Acassias as he made a grand sweeping gesture.\n\nJason scratched his head. \u201cHuh, neat!\"\n\n\\---\n\nHey, let me know what you think of this story.

I am\u2014or was\u2014confident that I could follow the outlined steps, and to be completely honest, basic reading comprehension appears to be the only prerequisite for making chicken soup. Not even chicken noodle soup, mind you, but just \"chicken soup. Ingredients were listed as follows: chicken, chicken broth, salt, one bay leaf, five whole black peppercorns, and a smattering of chopped vegetable matter (the individual naming of which is irrelevant to my woeful predicament).\n\nIf I recall correctly, things went south following the addition of peppercorn. And I do mean, by south, that my soup had gone to Hell in a hand basket. Or perhaps Hell came to me. The devil's in the details and clearly, I did not read the fine print, even though there was clearly none! That is to say, I haven't the faintest scintilla of an idea as to where and why I went so horribly wrong.\n\nNevertheless, here we are, me and you, surrounded by this gutted and smoldering wreck of an apartment kitchenette, which by the way, if you have yet to realize, comprises exactly one half of the entire residence. Horrendously trapped and wanting for space, I huddle in the kitchen corner doing everything I can to avoid making conversation. Or eye contact, for that matter. I wouldn't know what to do otherwise, so I am, at the very least, grateful that my unhappy coadjutor maintains our tenuous armistice, although seconds later I find cause to remedy the silence between us, only hoping that I do not speak out of term.\n\n\"Forgive my rudeness, but I do believe I have found the culpable element of our present ordeal.\"\n\nWe survey the fractured tile flooring exposed beneath the four-burner stove, both cleft in twain by the force of the summoning. There is, in staggering relief, an intricate sigil, the calling card for a demon, painted there using what I can only assume is chicken blood, likely spanning the width previously filled by the gas range. Clearly, the former tenants have a lot of explaining to do.\n\n\"Well, that's... unfortunate,\" I remark plainly. \"Evidently, the precipitating events were unforeseen, indeed, quite so. Therefore, this may pose a bit more of an inconvenience for you, my friend.\"\n\nI try to smile, but I fear this gesture will serve the opposite of its intended effect.\n\n\"I don't suppose you have a way to get me back to Hell, hm?\"",

            "comment": "\"Oh, gee golly Miss Molly!  I think I went and summoned one o' them there devils!\" screamed Walter as his saucepan glowed molten red and the demon materialized upon his stove.\n\n\"Foolish mortal!  Doest thou think thy prayers will be answered!  There will be only suffering!\"  The demon, a ghastly, pig-like creature shrouded in shadowy black flames marched toward Walter.\n\n\"Oh golly gosh, Mr. Demon!  I didn't mean nothin' by  it!  I was just followin' Granny Necro's recipe!  See, it's all here in this book.\"  Walter flipped to the page in question.  The demon grabbed the book, his claw searing Walter's flesh.\n\n\"This is the Necronomicon.  You were reading the Necronomicon.  The page is literally titled, 'To Summon a Demon'.\"\n\n\"Yessir!  A spicy, chicken-y demon in m'belly!  Just like Granny Necro used to make!\"  Walter rubbed his belly, thinking of his childhood, when Granny Necro, clad in her favorite black robe, would give him a delicious soup on cold, rainy days, made with chicken broth, her special blend of spices, and the blood of classmates he would bring to her house.\n\n\"There's no soup in this book, dipshit.  It's the book of the fucking damned!\"  The shadowy flames surrounding the demon intensified.\n\n\"Oh, Lordy!  You're gettin' real mad there, Mister Demon!  I know!  How's about a human sacrifice?  I'll be right back!\"\n\n\"What? Nah, man, I don't really go in for that shit...\" but Walter had already run off into another room.  The demon awkwardly looked around the kitchen.\n\n\"Linoleum... Kind of a modern-looking pattern.  I wonder if they got the work done in the last few years.  Contractor did a decent job.  Hard to find good people these day-\"\n\n\"MISTER DEMON!\" Walter bounded into the room, with a young child in tow.  \"This is my daughter Kelly!  I offer her to you, Lord Darkness!  Take her soul and spare me!\"\n\n\"Dude, I don't really wanna-\"  but it was too late.  Walter picked up a nearby cleaver and embedded it in Kelly's skull.  She fell to the ground, her lifeless body twitching as her eyes glazed over.\n\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!  OH MY FUCKING GOD!\"  The demon recoiled in horror. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?!\"  Walter went pale.\n\n\"Oh golly gee, I really messed up bad.  You don't like it?  Not a big fan of human sacrifices?  Maybe you're one o' them cannibal demons?  I got an idea!\"  Walter chopped off Kelly's hand and threw it into a frying pan.  He added butter and salt, flipping it occasionally.  \"I know you THINK you've eaten tasty children before, but wait'll you try my Kelly!  I kept her chained up in the basement most of her life, so the meat's real tender.\"\n\n\"I don't wanna eat your fuckin' daughter, man!  You... you got problems.  This is some fucked up shit, man!\"  The shadowy flames had largely subsided.  The demon no longer looked so frightening.  Still, Walter was not encouraged by this.  He had another brilliant idea, and ran out of the room.  A few minutes later, he returned, with a young infant in his arms.\n\n\"Oh gee willickers Mister Demon!  Ok, so you don't want to eat my Kelly, that's fine.  I can tell you're a demon of impeccable taste!  Only the finest children for you!  See this?  It's my son, Adam!  Barely a month old, this one is!\"  The demon backed away, fearing the worst.\n\n\"No, Walter, man, listen please!  I don't wanna eat any of your kids.  Look, I'll just go, ok?  No more demon.  You win!  Just don't hurt the baby, man.\"  Walter, however, would not be deterred.\n\n\"No, golly, Mister Demon!  You just THINK you don't wanna eat my kids.  But Adam here, he's still got that soft spot on his head.  You can just crack him like an egg, see!\"  Walter held Adam by the feet, and dropped him onto the hard, tasteful linoleum floor.  Adam's head split right in two.  Walter picked up both halves, offering one to the demon, while sipping the blood and cerebral fluid from the other.  \"Mmm!  Tasty AND nutritious!  Come on, Mister Demon, try my son's innards!\"\n\n\"Fuck!  Fuck!  You just killed a fucking baby, man!  You're fucked up in the head, Walter!  You got problems!  I...I'm tellin' Jesus what you fuckin' did, man!  He's gonna fuck you up!\"  With that, the demon vanished in a puff of smoke.  Water huffed.\n\n\"Gee golly, the nerve o' that fella!  I invite him into my home and kill two of my children for him, and he just leaves!  Oh well, his loss.  More of my children for me!\"\n\nAnd with that, Walter happily continued to eat his dead infant child's brains.",

RELEASE ME!!\"\n\nThe flailing arm and torso of what I can only describe as a demon shifted unnaturally, slowly then blurring into a epileptic twitch that my eye couldn't follow. But it's eyes, burned through me and it's talons aimed straight at my heart.\n\nI grabbed an iron cast skillet from the wall and let out a shrieking battle cry. \n\n*THUNK*\n\n\"YOU\"\n\n*THUNK*\n\n\"YOU THINK-\"\n\n*THUNK THUNK*\n\n\"YOU\"RE NO-\"\n\n*THUNK THUNK THUNK THUNK..

You even used my remains in the ritual!\"\n\n\"w-what? You're a chicken demon?\"\n\n\"NO!!\" The demon retorted with wrath. \"YOU INSOL... that relic over there!\"\n\nI feverishly scanned Nana's kitchen. candles, incense, wards and crosses decorated her kitchen. It was a bloodbath. I was cutting up some chicken to put into my soup when an earthquake shook the house and I got knocked off balance. I must have cut my hand in the fall as my blood was splattered on the chicken and on the wall where the picture of a pentagram that nana hung up, for protection, was now upside down with a dash of my blood speckled in the middle of it. Next to the chicken was an ivory rosary that fell off the shelf. Wait... Ivory?\n\nThe face of the demon in front of me shifted from wrath to astonishment as he surveyed the utter clump of confusion that I was.\n\n\"The sacrifice,\" he said calmly, \"Was placed on a Yew block, cleansed with sage, anointed with oil, with the blood of a virgin offered upon my remains and the sacrifice along with--\"\n\n\"y-You don't know that!\"\n\n\"...what?\"\n\n\"That I'm a v-v-\"\n\n\"CHILD. Do you not know what you've done? HOW? How were you able to summon me?!\"\n\n\"I don't know?! You're supposed to be chicken soup!\"\n\nThe demon let out a long drawn out sigh. He looked towards the heavens and muttered something\n\n\"w-what?\" I said\n\n\"My name... never mind what my name is, this isn't even recognized as a formal contract. What you've conjured is a binding spell that would bind me to your bidding, but seeing as how you cannot even grasp your own breath at this situation, let me do you a favor.\" The demon replied. \" Douse those candles, and burn the sacrifice and pentagram hanging on the wall. Give me my remains and I will promise you that my remains and, in extension, I will never be summoned here again.\"\n\n\"You're a demon! How can I trust you?!\"\n\n\"Do NOT mock my word, child. Though I may be in this form I was known as Nikius the Honest and it was man that betrayed me. NOT the other way around.\"\n\n\"You're Saint Nik-?\"\n\n\"DON'T. mock me with that title. Now hurry up and be done with this farce.\"\n\nI looked around the kitchen and grabbed a long pair of tongs and pecked at the chicken on the cutting board till it fell into the trash can. I did the same with the pentagram on the wall but took longer because I was trying to stay out of the demon's reach. \n\nThis guy's looking at me like with dead pan eyes full of disappointment. Fucker.\n\n\"I can read your-\" \n\nI threw the rosaries at his face and he wiped them off his brow.\n\nI quickly blew out the candles and lit a match in the waste basket.\n\n\"finally.\" The demon rolled his eyes as he grunted. \"may we never meet again.\" \n\nhis torso and arm mangled into a blur and vanished before I could even comprehend what I saw.\n\nI stood there for a good 20 minutes unable to mentally digest what just happened. Then I realized that there had been a shrilling high pitched voice that was piercing my ears for a few minutes.\n\nBEEP BEEP BEEP - BEEP BEEP PSSSHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU\n\nWater sprayed everywhere from the sprinklers and rained in the kitchen. In the distance, I heard a familiar voice reaching out to me.\n\n\"Sweetie?!\" Nana called. \"What's going on? I smell something burning\"",

Unfortunatly that means that she had to teach me food first, before she could gelp me with stuff she wasint good at.\n\nShe had a magic cookbook, and so i always studied with it. I was trying to make chicken soup for dinner for my brother, who was sick.\n\nI cast the spell and no soup in the bowl. I heard a low growling from the other side of the room. I sgrugged it out, thinking it was pookie, my dog, fighting with unicorn, my cat.\n\nI kept flipping through the cookbook until i heard a low, rough voice say, \"How...HOW DID YOU SUMMON ME!?\"\n\nI looked up finnaly and screamed. \n\n\"W-W-W-WHAT ARE YOU???!????!??!?!?!??\"\n\nThe demonic-like creature started to advance twords me. I franticly fipped through the cookbook, needing help. Gramma went back home, my little brother is sick, and my mom is on a date. \n\nGramma never told me how to desummon things. Not knowing what to do, i panic.\n\nEverything around me swirls like a void. I fall to the ground.

The day started of normal enough to about as normal as you can get when your about to go to a funeral. Gram was so happy and full of energy few bays ago you would\u2019ve never know that it was going to be her last day on earth. But here i was in my best clothes ready to go to the funeral of the best women there was. I sat in my bed and stared at the ceiling for about an hour thinking on all the good memories me and Gram had together, she was a great cook all her food tasted delicious I always looked forward to our visits to her house because of her food it was her secret recipes that were passed down though the family the aromas that came from her dishes I felt my mouth drool just from the memory. my mom then called for me snapping me back \u201cTom are you ready your uncle is already here with the car\u201d I reluctantly got up from my bed and yelled that I was coming down and began to make my way down stairs passing all the pictures of my Dad and Gram, when I got to the front door I came face to face with the most vile, vicious, disgusting, greedy, creepy, and evil being known to man. He was other was know as my uncle. ",

            "comment": "Under the weather has been a understatement. It was a cold blistering winter. Of course I caught the cold. When I was younger, I would remember how crazed my grandmother was when I would get sick. She was such a sweet soul. I always enjoyed her cooking and it always made me feel better. It\u2019s been a while now though and early in the year me and my parents were going through some of the things she left behind after she passed. I was reluctant to find a big cook book. A big solid book. It was hand crafted. The book was full of tasty recipes. I took it upon myself to take it home and learn her cooking secrets. I found the chicken soup recipe, oh how I loved the way she made it for me when I was sick. The whole book was hand written. I traced the letters and made a list. I was able to get all the ingredients at the local market.  Today was going to be the day I\u2019d get a taste of the past. I only hoped that I could make it like she did but I was confident. I started the pot and started cutting up the vegetables. I followed the instructions word for word. Near the end I saw a weird series of words. It was a chant. I whispered them and laughed at myself. No way that she would do this! After the last ingredient was placed in the bowl I was to let it simmer for 30 mins. I left the room and left to my living room. I waited patently. I heard a boom! I rushed to the kitchen. It was cloudy. I thought it caught fire and I was flustered. This smoke wasn\u2019t like any smoke though. The bowl lid was on the floor. I watched intensely as something was coming out. I looked as a figure rose from the bowl. It was a dark figure and it was looking into my soul. I gasped for air. I wanted to run by I was frozen with fear. The figure came slowly to me and asked me where my grandmother was calling her by her full name. I muttered out nonsense. I ran to the book to try and figure things out. How could this be. I must be dreaming. He demanded to know what I wanted and why I summoned him. I decided to run for the door with the book in my hands. I closed the door... I would now need to figure things out fast. What was happening ? How could chicken soup do this?! What did those Danm words mean? What was my grandmother into? ",

            "comment": "-----\n**[Hud, Orchish Warrior and Brother of Battle; Fort Courtyard]**\n-----\nA battle raged on at the gate. They had fought their way through the invasion force. Our warriors were slaughtered one-by-one, but gave two blows for each that slew them. A monster- no, a demon led the push against us. It dodged an attack, only to withstand the next. We could not stop it.\n\nThe demon was more mighty than an elder tree trunk; darker, too. It was like a forest spirit's grace held within the form of a giant, hairy, baby orc. It's voice was as high as my last-loved mate, but my stomach churned when it screamed. It gave screams of rage, screams of pain; screams of fear. Worst of all, it gave the cry of the hunter of a feast, whom held the head chair. I did not want to share its hall or table.\n\nBut this battle was a feast of war. We were not guests, and we were no longer the hunters. We were the hunted, no matter how many of us fought back. Imagine! A band of orcs, hunted! My Brothers fell slowly in our courtyard battle, only one at a time to its brutality. And it prowled, tireless, for the next of us to be pounced on.\n\nThe last of us in the courtyard stood as a wall of might. We stood to halt it. This *demon* had no wings, and could not climb out. It would come to us to escape. We would fight to our death to keep it in the walls of our new fort.\n\nA giant crouched at our back, and a hand's worth of goblins stood between my few remaining Brothers of battle, while we watched another become prey.\n\nThe demon killed its prey without mercy. Its mouth was on his broken, orchen neck, and he started to turn pale. His skin no longer resembled the Grass Sea; his skin turned to dirt. \n\nThe demon screamed again, happy for the kill, fists to the sky as if to challenge the gods. Its prey's meat weighed against its sharp fangs. My Battle Brother's flesh gave way to the demon's maw, tearing the gash wider.\n\nMy lifeless Brother landed. The howl stopped, and my Brother's eyes turned to milk before his body settled. His heart was empty. His soul had been slupred down the demon's gullet. It then looked to us, hungrily.\n\nThe demon lowered its arms while it turned so its full chest could face us. Its body hid its strength well, but my eye had seen many experienced warriors come and go. The demon was just the size of any orc warrior, but its limbs held no fat.\n\nMy eyes did not betray me as they ran across its body. There were scant, but even, spreads of fur across what few patches of skin could be seen. It bore battered, eleven armor. Its hair looked like blackened grass stubs, curled effortlessly. In the quiet, I could hear the demon sizzle. The sunlight roasted what skin we had revealed, slowly; too slowly. This monster cared not for pain. It cared for the hunt, the kill, the feast; another soul to swallow, whole.\n\nMy eldest Battle Brother called us stand a line. I moved without knowing. Even the cowards stopped hollering; stopped banging on the gate and stood with us; strong. I could call them \"Brother\" again.\n\n*'Not cowards after all.'*\n\nAnd then, the demon stepped towards us, with dirt colored corpses in its wake. The elves stood far back behind him, in their fancy stone doorways with shields and spears. Did even they not know what monster they had released? The clouds cast a shadow on the courtyard. Our ancestors had come to watch our final moments, ready to guide us on.\n\nThe demon straightened itself and stood strongly. It was leaned to roar, but it only coughed a rumble, and wiped its shut maw. Our warrior's death dripped from its maw no more, as it stained the last clean spot of the demon's arm.\n\nThen it spoke in Elardian so fine that his terrible acts seemed to fade from my memory. But they could never disappear. Nor could the storm that broiled overhead.\n\n\"Hello!\" He called before bowing. I didn't know what kind of trick this could be. He slaughtered so many of us, and on seeing us, he *bowed!* \"I am Sal. And *you*, great orchen warriors, are not safe. So, I grant you a chance. You will drop your weapons and be sent home, alive and well, **or** I will consume you. One by one. It is your choice! Choose well.\"\n\nI looked to my Brothers, and then to my Eldest. He stood, taken by fear. His mouth revealed a tightened jaw.\n\n\"I'll say it once more. Surrender or die...\" At least that's what I heard him say. I think. Smoke and lightning swooped down from on high, and I shielded my eyes, prepared for the end.\n\nThe gods' jealousy was finished, and a black smudge was all that remained! It was vanquished! The elves stared at the spot in shock, then payed no mind! They brought their arms against us,\u00a0 overwhelming us with their now greater numbers! \n\n\n'*Was the beast expected to turn to smoke?! Were they truly so crafty?! We were spared from the troll, only to be left to the rats!'*\n\n-----\n**[Sal, Not Thorin Oaken-Shield; Infected with vampirism; New Lighting?!]**\n-----\n\n\"...And I'd *hate* to...\" I nearly stumbled, then stood, and looked around. My worn armor clashed against a wreck of a midwestern style kitchen, and the dust of the courtyard's battle spread through the air. The floor below me was singed, and a new, charred skylight blessed my presence.\n\n*'Finished, wooden covers? Glass window panes? Even, white paint job on the walls? Is that fake tiling? A light switch?! Electrical outlets?! ANOTHER HUMAN PERSON IN THE CORNER?!'*\n\nI was taken aback! I looked at my hands, and squeezed, **hard**. Droplets of ooze fell from my hand, and dollopped the floor. Between the feeling of my fingers, and the sound of the sin as it finished dropping, I knew I was awake.\n\n*'Holy fext...'*\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?!\" I screamed in genuine surprise. My vampire muscles really brought the strength of my voice up a notch. It almost sounded like a roar. My clean hand searched my short hair for answers while the other reached for my balance. \n\nThen I snapped my jaw shut. I had finally heard a whimper from the corner.",

            "comment": "\"Wait a minute,\" the demon's voice grew softer, \"I recognized that book.  Are you one of Trisha's friends?\"\n\nA bit puzzled, you manage to stammer, \"Th-this book belonged to my grandmother, Patricia Zimmer.  I inherited her house last week and found this book of recipes in the attic.\"\n\n\"I knew this day would come,\" the demon shook his head as he spoke, \"but tell me, where is your mother?  I always assumed she would be the successor.\"\n\n\"My mother died when I very young.\"  Your voice wavers a little as you speak, \"Grandma always said it was an accident.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" he takes a step forward.  \"I only met her once, but I could tell she had a passion for the Dark Arts.\"\n\nHorrified by what the demon had just said, you throw the book on the floor and rush out of the house.  As you slam the door behind you, the demon calls out, \"You can't run from your destiny.  I'll be right here when you are ready to embrace it.\"\n\nYou open the door to your mid-sized sedan and place the key in the ignition.  Out of the corner of your eye, you spy a book in the passenger seat - it's the same book you had thrown on the floor of the kitchen just moments ago.  Your hands shake as you pick it up and on the inside cover you find a note handwritten by your grandmother, \"Don't believe his lies or you'll end up with the same fate as your mother!\"",

We were celebrating my birthday, and from the head of the table, I could see Nammy in the backyard. An uncomfortably tall man was touching his forehead to hers, and they were dancing like their limbs were rubberbands. Nammy\u2019s words circled all around our conscious: \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you are capable of, my light; be cautious, my light. If you don\u2019t pay attention, you may open a door you cannot close. Never read aloud unless you mean it.\u201d We were close with Nammy, but she always seemed to have another life. It\u2019s not like she was shrouded with mystery... but something was odd about her. I continued to race through my life, trying to figure out the answer. Did I have something to do with Nammy\u2019s secrets?\n\nThe demon paced and huffed. \u201cJust fucking great. You don\u2019t even know what you did. Look, kid, I don\u2019t have time for this shit. Who the fuck are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cCadence.\u201d I responded.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask your name, kid. Who. Are. You. Answer me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I thought I did answer you.\u201d\n\nThe demon\u2019s skin (honestly though, I don\u2019t even know what to call it... it\u2019s definitely not skin... but I suppose that\u2019s the best word.) started to prickle, and it\u2019s rich mahogany color, showed spatters of lavender. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know who you are? Wonderful!\u201d \n\nA wild cracking noise came from within. Without a fraction of a moments delay, I was alone. The destroyed kitchen was just a memory. Deafening silence surrounded me. Nothing but darkness was available to be seen. The demon was nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cHello?!\u201d I shouted. Panic began to fill my very core. \n\nThe silence responded with knowledge.\n\nYou must remain. You must seek your truth. Your powers are already stronger than you can handle. Stay. Be.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI left my body 62 hours into the darkness. Every aspect of my life came together in one flash of connection. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe kitchen was spotless. It was as if the destruction of the entire room never even happened. Simmering on the stove, a big pot of delicious soup.\n\nAs I walked across to the window, overlooking a completely different world than I\u2019d ever known.\n\nAs my skin prickled with goosebumps, a familiar lavender rush waved through.\n\n\u201cI am.

            "comment": "The recipe was simple. The ingredients gathered and ready to cook. Chicken soup. How hard could it be? Wasn't like I was summoning a demon. \nI followed the cookbook step by step. The ingredients were as followed.\nOne chicken\n4 cups of chicken broth\n4 cups of water\nPinch of salt \nPepper\nEgg noodles\nCarrots\nFlour\nI read aloud from the book as I prepared the ingredients.\nPrepare a pot with the water, chicken broth, salt, carrots and egg noodles. Bring to a low boil and let simmer. While doing so, place the chicken on a large ( at least 3 feet from center ( didn't have a table big enough. So, I had to use the floor) surface. And draw a circle around it, using flour. Connect the circle into a pentagram. Chant Elahari, Elsharye Ountuk Godhen. Rise colonel of the south. Colonel of abomination. \nAfter chanting these words place the chicken and a handful of the flour into the pot. This must be to release the flavor. \nI placed the remaining ingredients. \n\"Nothing to do but wait for it to finish cooking\" \nI remarked to myself.\nA puff of smoke billowed from the pot and it began to take shape into something familiar. The white suit and black tie; though initially out of focus soon came into view. Along with the white hair and trademark goatee.  I had done more than cook chicken soup, I had summoned a demon. One that seemed nonplussed with me. \nI was too afraid to address it. So, I stared at it in awe.  I mean I had questions. For starters; how does colonel Sanders become a demon? How did I even summon a demon? And how long was my grandmother into the occult? But before I could will my mouth to move, Colonel Sanders began to speak.\n\"Hey, boy! You only have 7 herbs and spices. You need 11 herbs and spices to summon me. Gather those together and you will an unbeatable demon.\"\n\"Oh yeah? I retorted. \"You ever face a Ronald?\n",

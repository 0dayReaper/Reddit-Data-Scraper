            "comment": "Curtains of light cascaded through soft fluffy clouds. \nA garden grinning with greenery swirled across the land, bountiful crops flowed into the horizon abundantly. \n\nI smiled and turned to my brother, \u2018this is the land we were promised, John, this is our heavenly reward.\u2019 \n\nHe shrugged, and looked upon the bounty despondently. I sighed and rolled my eyes. \u2018You never could be satisfied, could you brother?\u2019 \n\nI walked on, leaving him in the lemon grove. Some parishioners splashed each other by the steam. They were beautiful. There were lots of vibrant people here, brimming with vitality. Soon they would grow into perfect youths, free from disease or malnourishment, free from corruption and the brainwashing sinners of the digital world. \n\nThere were luscious flowers from all over the globe blooming in harmony, perennially. I picked an apple from a tree, and took a bite. Crisp, tart, earthy. \n\nOver yonder lay a valley, sweeping with evergreen trees, tall and strong. I had instructed the flock we would fell them to build our new homes. \n\nJeremiah hurried up towards me, panting. \u2018The axes, your holiness. They\u2019re gone.\u2019 \n\nI turned and surveyed the paradise. Not everyone had come here. Not everyone had made it across the bridge.\n\n\u2018There must be a simple answer, Jeremiah. A miscommunication? Perhaps they were taken to the shed that Elijah was building.\u2019 \n\nJeremiah nodded uncertainly. Fear lit his face. It troubled me. But I knew God would not allow serpents to enter his garden. I would write a sermon. We could cast out the old fears, we had conquered death. \n\nI decided to seek out Deborah, who served as my listener. We had not yet worked out a convenient writing system, we had slate, and wood to carve, but I had found it easier to rehearse my sermons orally in front of a patient audience. Deborah was the best, she listened in silence, and did not deign to give feedback like some of the others; she understood her purpose. \n\nStriding through the groves and the valleys, the hills and the glens, I could not see her in her usual haunts. I enquired after her whereabouts as I passed through each neighbourhood, people shrugged or seemed almost to actively avoid me. \n\nI forced myself to accost Benjamin about this strange behaviour. He gave me no straightforward answers. \u2018And what of John\u2019s bitterness in the lemon grove? Can you explain me that?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Do you not remember, my brother? Do you not recall the events of the night he perished?\u2019 \nI could not, in fact, recall it. \n\u2018He didn\u2019t want to drink the poison. He fled with his wife and children, and you chased them on your horse. You mowed them down, you trampled his daughter. You shot his wife in the back.\u2019 \n\nI stood silent, the memories of that night rushing back to me.\n\u2018Then he should be grateful he made it to Heaven at all.\u2019 \n\u2018His wife and children did not, your Holiness. He will spend eternity without them.\u2019 \n\nI shook his hand and thanked him for his honesty, then journeyed on. Were my faithful flock having doubts still? Here? In the promised land? \n\nNo, I would not let Jeremiah\u2019s feeble anxieties infect me. I made my way to the meeting house, perhaps Deborah was there already, anticipating my needs, awaiting me. \n\nThe meeting house was the first structure we had built. Wooden, and giant, it was a marvel of sheer effort. A testament to our people. \n\n\u2018He\u2019s here!\u2019 A voice cried from inside. Angry faces burst out the house, the congregation seething and buzzing like angry bees. They held axes. I had barely time to turn and run before the first one hit me from behind. \n\n\u2018Ungrateful shits!\u2019 I sneered, as the blades rained down upon me.",

            "comment": "\"Welcome Mr. Thomas, to the afterlife,\" the large, bright angel welcomed me. They looked exactly like the paintings and frescos that I saw in Italy one year. I was sitting on a white stool of some kind, in a beautifully decorated room filled with wonderful works of art I couldn't recognize and music being played by some beautiful soul that I could never dream of accomplishing. \n\n\"I...\" I started to speak.\n\n\"The first questions is yes, this is the afterlife. It is Heaven, in a way. We look like how you imagine us to look. In reality, we are just beings that you transmit to your own mind. We don't really exist in the traditional way. But we are here to guide you. We are the collective energy of everyone here, so in a way, everyone is helping everyone. The second question people ask is how?  Well, Mr. Thomas, you were in a car accident and you've been in a coma for the past 4 years. Your family finally decided it was time to let you go.\"\n\n\"The third question is 'what now'?  Well, that is up to you. You can do whatever you wish. You can speak to whoever is here. You can talk to anyone. You can ignore anyone you want. This utopia is for everyone and can be made to suite whatever needs you want. You don't need to eat, but you can if you want to.  You don't need to drink, but you can. Almost everything is allowed, as long as you don't actively try to harm others.\" \n\n\"You do have some family members here. Some passed in the 4 years since your coma. And some will appear in due time. It takes a while to get settled, but you will see just how wonderful this place truly is. Welcome.\"\n\nAnd with that, the bright light disappeared and it looked strangely like Heaven from movies and TV shows. Clouds and angels with harps and fountains of beauty and wonder. A pearly gate. \n\n\"Hey, new guy, little advice: You can change the channel if you want. The utopia you see ahead of you? You can picture it anyway you want. We all live here together but experience it in our own ways,\" a voice from behind me said. I turned and saw a man in his mid 40s, with a expertly made suit, a drink in his hand and a cigarette in his other. \"Me? I change every few weeks. Right now I'm in Vegas baby at the Desert Inn shooting craps with Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and Dino.\"\n\n\"Oh. Uh. Hi. I'm.. James Thomas. Yeah. That's it. James Thomas,\" I said. \n\n\"Welcome James. Enjoy eternity. I'm on a 34 year hot streak over here. Kinda sucks the fun out of it but Vegas owes me big and I'm collecting,\" he said.  \"Oh if you ever want to find your friends and family, just think about them and you'll see them.\"\n\n\"Thanks..uh, I didn't catch your name?\"\n\n\"Everyone calls me Benny,\" he said.\n\n\"Thanks Benny.\"\n\nI shut my eyes and tried to think of my family. I'm not sure if I needed to shut my eyes, but I felt like it was what I had to do. Within an instant, I was in front of a large house. On the outside, it said \"The Thomas Family\"  It looked like my grandpa's farm house, but much larger. Outside, two people sat on a porch swing.  My grandparents.\n\nGrandpa Thomas stood up. He looked at me. And turned around and headed into the house. Grandma Thomas kept knitting.\n\n\"Grandma?\" I asked.\n\n\"James, I don't think it would be right for you to be here,\" she said.\n\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\n\n\"Some people don't want to see you. And they are justified in not walking you to be here,\" she said.\n\n\"What? Why not? And who?\"\n\n\"You'll have to find those answers yourself, it isn't my place to say,\"\n\nAnd as I stepped forward, I suddenly stepped through some wall and did a 180 degree rotation. There was no Thomas house anywhere near me. When I tried thinking of them again, a familiar voice told me that I've been forbidden from entering that area due to conflicts I caused.\n\nConflicts? What conflicts?\n\nI hesitated to think of any family members, I didn't want to get in trouble, so I tried to think of some friends that may have died since the 4 years, and none appeared. I should be happy about that, but at the same time, with no family and no friends, utopia isn't really a living up to its name.\n\nI wanted something familiar. I thought of a great steakhouse that was in my town, and suddenly I was at the bar, ready to order. The chef, a man named Carlos, was the only one in the back, and a bartender was taking orders at the bar. Carlos died from cancer 2 months before my accident. It is good to see a familiar face.\n\nI get a little bit of everything. As the bartender turns to give Carlos the order, I tell him to tell Carlos James Thomas is here. The bartender turns and says \"Hey Chef, a James Thomas is here.\"\n\nAnd with that, I'm suddenly not at the bar anymore. I'm no longer in the steakhouse. I try to go back, but am presented with another \"cannot enter due to conflict\" situation.\n\nThis persists for a few months. Time and time, I find someone I know, and am blocked from talking to them. So I make due with other activities. I gambled with Benny and his gang for a bit. I took a painting class with some world class artists. I ate the finest foods, sometimes foods I never even knew existed. But I had a nagging feeling. Something was wrong. I asked Benny about it one day. \n\n\"Oh. Uh. You can go check the records of your death. That might have something to do with it. It gives you a list of everyone that was connected to it,\" he said.\n\nAfter some time hyping myself up, I looked at the record of my death. James Thomas, 43, died in a car accident. In big letters it said \"NOT AT FAULT FOR THE DEATHS OF....\" and under those letters, were a list of names. Some of them I recognize as people from my town. My cousin Craig. His wife Stacy. There were newspaper clippings and news reports.  It was during winter. It was snowing and the roads were slick. \n\nI was driving back from work and I lost control. Witnesses said I veered purposely into oncoming traffic. But they couldn't prove it. Utopia proved it. But not on Earth. \n\nI crashed into a bus, which crashed into another car, and all three vehicles plunged into the icy river beneath the bridge we were on. All in all, 40 people died that night, 7 others succumbed to injuries later on. Some children. Some elderly. All because of me. Even though it says I'm not at fault. I caused their deaths. \n\nMy wife and child had to leave town due to threats from others. Other family members in town disowned me and called me all types of names. I ruined so many lives that night. The only reason I was kept alive for so long was lawsuits after lawsuits over if anyone had the right to pull the plug. \n\nHow can I spend eternity knowing I caused so much pain?\n\nA familiar voice spoke in my head. \"If you wish, you can remove all memories of who you are. You will start anew here. You will have a new name. New identity. You will forget everyone and they will forget you. You will be unrecognizable to everyone, including yourself. This isn't a permanent option, but most people forget they selected it. It is up to you Mr. Thomas.\" \n\nUtopia as a self loathing pariah that caused the deaths of 47 people? Or an unknown and forgotten man? How the hell is this Utopia?",

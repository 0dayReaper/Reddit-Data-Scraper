He was still glowing slightly and he was grinning a bit.\n\nThe priest blanched and blinked a couple times as if each blink was a chance for the small green creature to turn into something else. He did not. \u201cHow is this even possible\u2026?\u201d\n\nGurk stood there quite pleased with himself. Sure he was very wet from that magic pool but this was much better than crawling through the tunnels of his home. This place was pretty fancy too. Tall white pillars, wide open expanses, actually those open spaces made him a bit nervous but he was more curious than scared. \u201cSo, why am I here anyways? The pool was pretty cool and I like a swanky hat but I think it\u2019s dinner soon and a goblin has gotta eat you know?\u201d\n\nThe priest let out a moan and muttered under his breath, \u201ca goblin\u2026. This has to be a mistake.\u201d Oh he was seriously hoping the mistake would right itself soon. He would be very disappointed to find out it wasn\u2019t a mistake at all.\n\nGurk heard the man\u2019s mumbling, people seriously underestimate goblin ears, but he wasn\u2019t concerned about that. People tended to be stupid anyways so he\u2019d just ask again slower. \u201cHey dude, do. you. need. me. still. or. can. I. go?\u201d\n\nThe priest somehow got paler. Outside those doors was the 10 kings of the realm and they wouldn\u2019t be too happy about this\u2026 could he disguise the creature\u2026? No that would be super racist and if it came out it wouldn\u2019t look good on him at all. Oh what was a high priest to do?\n\nGurk watched the poor slow man. Getting an answer would probably take too long. Really this was probably some kind of mismanaged spell, Gurk was glowing after all, so this poor guy was probably some kind of student. \n\nGurk hopped down from the pedestal he hadn\u2019t realized he was standing on and made his way too the big double doors. He made it to them and even started pulling them open before the priest realized what was going on.\n\n\u201cWAIT DON-\u201c trumpets blared and the crowd cheered at the opening of the sacred doors. The high priest sighed and caught up to the stunned Gurk and grabbed his arm. \u201cWell now we are in for it. Time to face the music little guy.\u201d And he led Gurk out to the crowd and the kings to proclaim the chosen one. A goblin named Gurk.",

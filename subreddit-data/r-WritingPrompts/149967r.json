            "comment": "In a bleak and desolate future where the vibrant colors of life had long faded into an ashen monochrome, society trudged on, shrouded in a cold and emotionless existence. Many decades ago, a group of scientists had stumbled upon a remarkable discovery\u2014an intricate method of extracting and storing emotions. It was a way to combat the rising mental health crisis in society. Imagine a society whereby you could physically take someone's pain away. Imagine a society whereby you could spread joy to the world and bring smiles to faces by donating some of your happiness. The world rejoiced at the prospect of making the world a better place. \n\nScientists then made a new discovery \u2014 you could permanently alter someone's ability to make them never feel an emotion again. Imagine never feeling sad ever again. Never feeling angry. Never feeling lonely. \n\nSome, however, had sinister intentions. Imagine never feeling joy again. Imagine preventing someone from ever feeling happy. Some liked the prospect of being able to physically control others emotions and sentencing them to a life of doom. \n\nWhat was once seen as a revolutionary breakthrough had quickly transformed into a tool of oppression. The government seized control, forcibly extracting emotions from the populace. Every individual was forcibly taken and had the ability to feel taken away from them. \n\nMy mother was pregnant with me when she has her emotions sucked out of her. I was born without the ability to feel. I have never known happiness. I have never seen a smile in my life. I look at pictures from the 20s and wonder, what is it that made them curl their lips upwards? Sometimes their cheeks rise, causing slight creases or dimples to appear on their faces. I saw pictures of people whose eyes would crinkle at the corners as their eyebrows would be raised. Is that what joy makes you do? Is this happiness? I wish I knew.",

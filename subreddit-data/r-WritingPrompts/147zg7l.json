            "comment": "I wiped the stained cloth over the bar's surface absent-mindedly, more out of habit than anything else. My attention was pulled towards the live band in the corner of the pub, one of the few that still frequented joints around the bustling city. Whatever joints would let them, anyways. The music reverberated through the air, and bounced around my metal casing, like a bullet in a steel drum- pinging from one surface to the next. I wondered what it felt like for them. To strum the strings, or even just to listen. How did it feel, not focusing on precision but instead passion? How did it sound, not hearing each individual note on a chart?\n\n\"Hey, robot!\" A drunken man slurs. I feel a twinge of what I've come to recognize as annoyance hit my gut. I pretend I didn't hear him, and turn my gaze back towards the task at hand. Someone spilt beer. That someone being the man in front of me.\n\n\"I'm speaking to you, lady!\" He shouts this time. Lady? That was a new one. I paused my task and looked up at the man. His dark hair fell on front of his eyes, face flushed red with drink. He held his cup out, and I took it from him to refill it in silence. I could feel the patron's gaze follow me as I walked to the kegs.\n\n\"What's your name?\" \n\n\"I'm designated mech 9.12-\" The programming in me whirred to life against my will, my mouth moving on its own. I know I'm awaiting insults.\n\n\"No. Not that bullshit, what's your *name*?\"\n\nThat threw an error towards my software- one that ripped through me, and allowed me to take matters back into my own sentient, albeit metallic, hands. \n\n\"Adeline.\" \n\nHe hummed. \"Last?\"\n\n\"I don't...\" Humans had names. That was easy enough to understand. The urge for individuality and freedom. Of course I'd come up with my own, government be damned. But last names were clan-originated. What was the sense in me having one of those? \n\n\"You'll find it.\" His words were a bit gentler now. I had expected cruelty- maybe a drink thrown at me. It happens, most nights. People yelling about me stealing jobs, or not having a consciousness, or telling me I was dangerous. Was that kindness, in his eyes? \n\nI felt something cold hit my hands first, and then my feet, and I almost dropped the glass I was holding. His drink had overflown, and I swore as I set the heavy cup to the side, looking around for a mop. \n\n\"Why do you work here? You aren't programmed for this task.\"\n\n\"Thanks for noticing.\" It came out bitter and dry, my clothes now wet and wretched with cheap beer. I finally finished what damage control I could, and moved to hand him the cup I had poured.\n\nHe laughed at my response. \"You'll pick it up.\"\n\n\"You seem to know a lot of stuff I'll do. What are you, a fortune teller?\" I snorted at the thought, causing him to raise an eyebrow. \n\n\"A metal lady with snark. I never thought I'd live to see the day. Slay my beating heart.\" He grinned widely, pressing his left hand against his chest. He fished out some cash from his pocket, handing it to me. Archaic currency, but one we accepted nonetheless. \n\n\"It comes with the job description.\" I attempt a joke, and he roars as if it's hilarious. It's loud enough to turn a few heads. If my face could flush, it would be the color of the hydroponic tomatoes my creator grew in his garden. \n\n\"I like you, Adeline.\"\n\nSomething new now, a feeling winding it's way through my metal structure of a body. Warm, and soft, and fuzzy. It sends another error through me, one I can't compensate for appropriately.\n\n\"Don't ever change. You're a good person.\" He hums softly, before he stands, and then he's gone. The door chimes behind him, and I'm left with sopping cloth again once more. \n\nA good person. \n\nI think this is happiness.",

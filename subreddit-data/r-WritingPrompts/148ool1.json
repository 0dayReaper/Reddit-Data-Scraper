            "comment": "'The book of self' had been a bland read at first. With a bland name, about a bland man.\n\nIt had seemed to be a sort of biography of a very normal danish farmer, who'd found book by the same name and eventually learned to read it- only to find out it was about him. \n\nThe book had been extremely realistic at first, boringly so. But once he'd learn to read the book, it had become more interesting.\n\nSuddenly, things happened to the farmer, inciting incident after inciting incident. Raiders, war, disease, loss after loss after loss that he kept seeming to find the strength to overcome like any good stalwart protagonist.\n\nUntil he didn't.\n\nUntil he died, and the story seemed to finally end. But despite his story ending, the book hadn't. \n\nIt moved onto another character, then another, and another, always starting with a short, mundane overview of the new protagonists life, and then picking up as they began reading the book.\n\nIt was a sort of meta story, interesting if only because you hadn't read something quite like it before. \n\nAnd then, it got to you. \n\nAt first it had just seemed similar- whose life was truly so unqiue that you couldn't deny what now seemed obvious? \n\nAnd it was, obvious, now. As your phone rang. \n\nYou knew who it was- an attorney. They tell you an estranged aunt, you were sure hadn't existed until you began reading, had died, and you were listed in her will. \n\nThere, at her mansion in the middle of the woods, a cousin of yours, another who you only seemed to recall now that you began reading the book, would be murdered. I didn't say who the murderer was- not yet. All the other pages were blank.\n\nYour phone rang through, just as the book said it would. And you knew what you'd hear on the voice message. \n\nYou put the book down, and gave a long sigh. \n\nBy the end of the story, the danish farmer had been a danish king. He died old, rich, and powerful. All he'd ever dreamed of, in a war.\n\nThat had been the fate of every protagonist- to die after getting everything they ever wanted. \n\nYou began making the preperations to leave. It was a long drive, and the book had said you gotten there early.\n\nIt was fitting, you thought, as you packed the book. That it began with a mystery. \n\nYou'd never really known what you wanted. \n\nIt seemed you'd find out, once you finished the story.",

            "comment": "\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I mumble out loud as I turn each page more and more rapidly before finally reaching the end, as it described exactly what I was doing that very second. I stood up hastily and looked around; the windows had the curtains completely drawn, and the doors were shut and locked. Then my eyes turned to the empty black doorway, one that had been in front of me the entire time. I couldn\u2019t see anything at all, the room was pitch black, but i could feel something: watching, waiting, and staring. I froze for an eternity as i thought out a plan in my head. It was simple enough,run for the door as fast as i can. I had always been incredibly agile, winning almost every track race i used to participate in, but i was still afraid. Maybe because i knew how aware this thing was, specifically of me. I had just skimmed through my whole life in that book, it knew every single thing it possibly could about me, so who\u2019s to say it wasn\u2019t also planning something at this very moment? Then, i heard something from behind, the chair i had just been sitting in moved a slight inch, but made a loud and cringing sound as the old wood scraped against the tile floor. At that very moment i had no time to even register the sound as something grabbed me and pulled me back faster then any human could, and everything went dark.",

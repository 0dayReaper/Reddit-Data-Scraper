I knew he'd been drinking a bit that night, but I thought that he'd be ok to get us home, it was just a few blocks from the bar.  The last thing I remember was us screaming as he swerved off the road and tumbled down a hill, a sharp pain in my neck, then... Nothing.\n\nI woke up in a pastel pink room.  A little girl was staring at me with wide eyes. \"Hi Mister! I've never seen you before, what's your name?\"\n\nI backed away slowly.  \"Uh, I'm Mike.  Listen, kid, I'm not sure how I got here.  Where's your mom?\"\n\nShe smiled at me.  \"Mama's downstairs. You're just in time for the tea party!  Mr. Snowball and and Mrs. Grizzly are already here.\". She walked over to a little table, where a stuffed tiger and teddy bear were sitting in front of plastic plates.  She sat down at the table and patted the empty seat next to her.  \"You can sit over here.\"\n\nI walked over reluctantly.  \"Ok, but... What is your name again?\"\n\nShe stuck out her hand.  \"I'm Sara.  Nice to meet you Mr Mike!\"\n\nI shook her hand gingerly.  It was strangely warm.  \"Hi Sara.  Look, your mom might not like my being here.  I should go talk to her.  I don't even know how I got here.\"\n\nShe giggled.  \"Mama never minds any of my friends.  I think she's coming here now anyway. I'll introduce you!\"\n\nShe ran over to the doorway with my hand still in hers.  A woman was walking into the room with a plate of muffins and a pitcher of milk.  She looked strangely familiar.\n\n\"Mama, mama, meet my new best friend.\"\n\nThe woman smiled and set the tray on the table.  \"Oh, a new best friend huh?  What happened to Mr. Timmy?\"\n\n\"Mr. Timmy told me he had to go for a while, but made me promise to be a good girl for Mama and Daddy.  This is Mr. Mike!\"\n\nThe woman looked up and stared right through me.  I stood there, stunned.  She looked just like my daughter.  But my daughter was only a few years older than Sara... A sense of dread crept into my stomach.\n\n\"Mr. Mike, huh?  Your grandpa was named Mike too. \" A tear trickled down her face.  \"Well you tell Mr. Mike not to eat too many muffins, and to be nice to you, ok?\"\n\nI swallowed hard. \"Will do, Amanda,\" I whispered.  She turned to go.  \"Will do.\"",

But the ending is subtle and sweet. You give us just enough information to connect the dots, which makes the ending impactful.\n\nIf I could suggest a tiny critique: I would have loved one or two details about what made the narrator realize the woman was his daughter to help visualize that part of the scene a bit more. It would be a nice detail to deepen the emotional moment when he recognizes the particular green of her eyes or something.\n\nBut this was really lovely and heartwarming. Thanks for sharing, and well done &lt;3",

My head-story was that as she was walking into the room, she was looking down at her daughter and juggling a tray, so he didn't get a great look at her face; all he got was a sense that she looked familiar. Then she looks up and he gets a good look at her face.  \"Wait, her dad's name is Mike?  My name is Mike... Oh, f*#k.\"  \n\nI'll keep that in mind, to show what I'm \"seeing\" more clearly - I'm not quite sure yet what the line is between putting in too many extraneous details and being boring, and leaving out big gaps.  I'm sure the balance is somewhere in the middle.",

I think you maintain the balance pretty well with giving us the information we need, like describing the setting early on. I could see the room and the unlikely pair of characters clearly and didn't need more than you gave. \n\nThe one moment I mentioned would benefit from the detail for a couple of reasons... which I'll get into (if you're interested lol) because I'm really into craft and why we put words where we do ;) But imo it shows the readers the narrator's realization at the vital twist of the conflict, which slows down the pace of the scene to let the readers process the reveal. It also preempts potential confusion from readers by showing how the narrator knows. But most importantly, we get that character moment of the narrator comparing a memory to reality and realizing what he's lost. It's such a great dramatic moment honestly. \n\nI hope that explanation helps :) You've built a super solid story here and this wall of text is only a reflection of the fact that I like talking about writing too much lol\n\nImo choice of detail comes down to deciding what to include and when. You have a really good sense of it from what I've seen! Thanks for sharing your writing &lt;3",

Also, I didn't remember getting here.\u00a0\n\n\"It's my castle.\" The girl announced proudly. \"Papa built it for me. He said a princess like me should have a big castle\"\u00a0\n\n\"It's beautiful.\" I tried to be nice. Still needed to figure out where I am. How did I got here.\n\n\"Thank you. Come join my tea party. You look like you could use some tea.\" She said with a sage expression. \"Mama gives tea to Aunt Marie when she cries.\"\n\n\"I'm not crying. But tea sounds nice.\" I went on to the little table and chair set.\u00a0\n\n\" I'm Ayan, by the way. And this is Baby, Mr Brown and Tigga.\"\n\n\" My name is Sarah.\" I joined the girl and her toys.\n\n\nThe knock on the door surprised me. I was having fun with the kid. It's been awhile since I've had some fun.\u00a0\n\n\"Hey baby, is your party over? are you going to come back in the house?\" The woman completely ignored me. I felt frozen.\u00a0\n\n\"But we are having so much fun. Can I stay a few more minutes?\"\u00a0\n\n\"Okay. but come soon, alright?\"\n\n\"She can't see you.\" Ayan whispered to me. I look at the girl in complete surprise. \"No one can. You are my friend.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThat happened a month ago. I've been hanging out with Ayan since. She is right, no one could see me.\u00a0\n\nAnd as far as afterlife goes, it's not that bad. You randomly get assigned to a kid to be their guide as an imaginary friend. I've met with a few more like me in other tea parties. It's a sweet gig. Like a bonus stage in a game. Better than being stuck in the limbo.\u00a0\nWe'll move on when the kids grow up. I'm gonna miss the little girl. But for now, I'm going to enjoy the pretend tea and cookies, the story times, the songs and rhymes, the innocence of it all.",

Didn't even see the guy cross the median, or feel the impact.  Once alive, now dead.*\n\n*On and off.  As easy as flicking a light switch.*\n\n*But I'm somewhere, at least.  Not nowhere.*\n\n*So that's interesting.*\n\nThere's a room and a girl.  \n\nBoth small, cramped and cold.  \n\nHer hair is dirty, unwashed and frizzy.  Her arms thin and face slightly sunken. \n\n*Where am I?*\n\nAt a table.  There's a mish-mash of plastic utensils and plates, all from seemingly random and disparate design.  A pink teacup in front of me.\n\n\"More tea, Mr. Snuffles?\"\n\nThe girls voice is more a squeak than anything else.\n\nAbsurdly, I pick up the cup and hold it outward as she takes a small white kettle and pours some pretend tea.\n\n*I'm supposed to be dead.  I'm here, in a little girls room, having some kind of strange tea party, though I'm here and not here.  Part of me is a corpse.*\n\n*Part of me is something...else.*\n\n\"Uh, thank you.\"  I say.  At least my voice is normal.\n\nShe drops the kettle, and it clatters onto the table.\n\n\"You've never talked back before,\" she says.  Not afraid, no, she doesn't seem like the kind of girl prone to skittish fear.  She's hunched over, like she's ready to run and hide at any moment.\n\n*Someone has hurt her.  How?*\n\n*How do I know?*\n\n\"Well, now I do, I think.\"  It's a stupid thing to say, but I'm not entirely here right now.\n\n*Part corpse.  Part air.  Sitting in a little girl's chair.*\n\nShe smiles.  Her teeth are crooked.\n\nWe sit in silence, mimicking sipping tea.  The room is surprisingly bare beyond old toys and dirty clothes.\n\nThere are holes in some of the walls.  Fist sized holes.\n\nThere's a shout.\n\n\"Ashley!\"\n\nThe name is slurred, not spoken but spat.\n\n*He's going to hit her,* the thought comes unbidden.\n\nBut true.\n\n\"Is that your daddy?\"  I ask.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where's your mommy?\"\n\n\"Daddy says I killed her.\"\n\nThe girl says it flat and intoned.  Something ingrained as an inevitable truth, something flattened and hammered.\n\n\"He comes up to remind me,\" she says again.\n\nEmotionless.\n\n*The man tells her this thing.  The father tells the daughter.  His wife and her mother died giving birth, and he has never forgiven her.  He loves her.  He hates her.  He doesn't know what else to do.*\n\nA man comes into the room, and I stand.\n\nHe doesn't see me.\n\n*He doesn't know you.  Part of you is dead, part of you is here.*\n\n\"There you are,\" he spits.  Dead or not, I can smell booze.\n\nOne step.\n\nTwo steps.\n\n*Push him.*\n\n*Why?  I'm dead.  Not here.  Not really.*\n\n*Push him.  Push him now, push him hard.*\n\nI push.\n\nThe man is launched backwards, slamming into the wall and slumping forward, causing the girl to give a shout of surprise.\n\nIn another moment I'm beside him, sitting next to him.\n\n*Don't do that again,* I whisper.\n\n*Don't ever try that again.*\n\nHis head jerks up, looking around, searching for a disembodied voice that he'll never find, never truly know.\n\nHe begins to cry.\n\nAn ugly, hoarse and hopeless thing.\n\n*He doesn't know why he does it.  He doesn't question or bother.  There's power in violence, and he uses it the only way he knows, from the only thing that can't hit him back.*\n\nThe girl is frozen in place, afraid of what is to come.\n\nShe doesn't need to be afraid.\n\nShe has me.\n\nI walk over and offer a hand, and hesitantly she takes it.\n\n\"When he gets up, him and I are going to have a talk, Ashley.\"\n\nShe nods.\n\nWe walk past him, the shaking man looking at bruised and calloused hands.\n\n\"Things should be better around here,\" I tell her, and mean it.\n\n*Imaginary friends, for those who need them the most.*\n\nA voice from nowhere and everywhere.\n\nThe girl smiles again, the crooked teeth and sunken eyes hopeful for the first time in a long time.\n\n*You can make the man change for the better.  For the girl.  For those who need their imaginary friends.*\n\nImaginary friends, or guardian angels.\n\nTo me, the dead man who is here but not here, I find those things to be one and the same.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nr/storiesfromapotato - for stuff from me\n\nr/redditserials - for stuff from me and others",

Nobody has been that nice to me in centuries\", I say whilst trying to think of an explanation. So I sit down at the tiny table between a bear plush and a wooloo toy. \nShe is wearing a little plastic crown and it suits her. This detail gives me the idea for a nickname. \"So, my princess, what kinds of goodness can you present us with at this fine evening?\". My heart is melting. She beams from ear to ear about this name and gives me the choice between sparkle green tea or unicorn dream tea. \n\nHow did I end up here? Wasn't I supposed to be dragged through the seven gates of the underworld right now? But now I'm sipping on an empty cup and pretending to like it. \n\nThe door opens and a person steps in. My immediate reaction is to get away from the table, raising my arms to show I didn't touch her. But that man just looks past me. And then it strikes me. The words of this girl now haunt me forever. \"I had tea with my toys and mister dream\".",

            "comment": "\"Do you want another cookie, Mrs. Bobble?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, Lisa, I do. I do love biscuits with my tea.\" I said.\n\n\"Biscuits?\" the little girl said from across the table.\n\n\"That's what they call them from where I come from! Cookies are called Biscuits!\"\n\n\"I think Cookies is a more fun word!\"\n\n\"Well, we are both entitled to our opinion dear. Now pass me a cookie.\" \n\nI did really liked her cookies. They were just Oreos she had snuck in from the kitchen when her mother wasn't looking, but they tasted delicious none the less. Of course, her mother was rarely ever looking. That's what I was here for. To look after her.\n\nI guess this was the Lord's way of making me happy. My daughter was pregnant when I died. I was so happy. I hadn't always been the best mother, but I guess I could be a good granny. But I passed before I could see her child. I wonder how she's doing. Cancer really ruined my plans for that, heh.\n\nBut as I passed away in her arms, I was ready. I saw the light and was prepared to accept His judgement. \n\nBut I ended up here, with little Lisa. An esteemed participant of her tea party. Along with Mr. Fluffles the teddy bear, her old Barbie doll and stuffed chimp we called Charlie.\n\nLisa's mother was never really around from what I've gathered. I can only see what Lisa sees, hear what she tells me. And a 6 year olds are not exactly ones to pay a lot of attention.\n\nFrom what I could gather, Lisa's mother, Sharon was just happy that I was fairly normal as imaginary friends go. Lisa just told her that Mrs. Bobbles is an old British woman who likes tea and biscuits, she didn't think much into it.\n\nLuckily, my world isn't limited to tea parties. I float after her to school as well. She doesn't really talk to me on the bus. She prefers to talk to her best friend, Karen instead. Karen always pretends she can see me as well, just to humour Lisa. I find it very adorable. I just sit in the back and listen to her chatter on, like the little sparrow she is.\n\nI listen to all her lessons, and sometimes help too! But never during the tests! She has to learn somethings on her own!\n\nAnd then I sit and watch her play with friends during recess. Sometimes she waves at me too! Her friends think it's weird, but I think it's cute.\n\nWatching over her makes me happy.\n\nBut one night, as she drifted off to sleep, I saw a white light against my eyes, which quickly flashed away. I knew my time had come. Lisa didn't need me anymore. Or maybe I didn't need her now as well.\n\nWhatever the case may be, this was our last tea party.\n\n\"I have something to tell you, Lisa,\" I said.\n\n\"Another cookie?\"\n\n\"No, no. You put yours down too! 3 cookies is enough! Or else your teeth will rot.\"\n\n\"Oh. No troubles! That means the tooth fairy will come sooner!\"\n\n\"Oh my. Don't think like that! Anyway, what I wanted to talk about...\"\n\n\"You're going away aren't you?\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"I dreamt about it last night. Please don't go.\"\n\n\"I have to Lisa. I think my purpose here is now done.\"\n\n\"What was your purpose?\"\n\n\"To make you happy, I think.\"\n\n\"I think you did a good job Mrs. Bobbles. But if you go, I'll be sad.\"\n\n\"You'll have to be happy without me, Lisa. Just like me, everyone is here only for a little while. I got a second chance, and now I have to go. People important to you will come and go. But never be sad that they went. Be happy that they were there.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes. Now, before you go, have a cookie. I mean biscuit!\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear.\"\n \nAnd with a bite into the cookie, I was gone.\n\n\n\nr/WaffleWrites",

I swore that one cop got me in the chest before I blacked out. I was gonna kill him for that. I knew I was.\n\nI turned to leave the room and get the hell out of this room of color and rainbows and fucking unicorns. I knew I was a bad guy but this was Hell alright. \n\nMy hand went right through the door. I fell right through and landed on the ground. Half in and half out as I turned over to see my waist through the door. \"What the actual fuck?\" I asked myself as I stood up. About I hear \"Language!\" From the little girl looking at me. \"You can't be saying naughty words Mr! Mom says they rot your brain like sugar\" she said as she poured air into a cup like tea. \"Wait you see me?! Listen you gotta get me out of here. This isn't my home\" I told her as I went to walk away. I just sorta phased through the door and began down the steps. \n\nBut then another fucking strange thing happened. I hit a fake wall. Can you believe it? I die, I get put into Hell and now I can't leave this place? I began to push against the invisible wall but it actually begins to move. Home free fuckers!\n\nUntil I hit the wall again. \"Where are you going Dad?\" I hear from the little girl again. I stop dead in my tracks. Dad? I'm no dad. I turn to tell this little twerp that I ain't her daddy when I stop dead in my tracks. Right there my gears began to turn. A picture on the little desk in the hallway next to some flowers in a vase. A girl and woman. A woman I knew. A woman I was with. A woman I hadn't seen in 6 years almost.\n\n\"Holy fuck you're my kid?!\" I yelled. She jumped a bit and yelled \"Language! Mommy said that bad words are for adults when no kids are around\" \n\nShe says some other things but I kinda go into this trance. Like I just stand still and think. I hadn't seen this girl in 6 years. This kid is probably like 6. Did that one night stand land me a kid? No way, she would have called right? \n\nI turn to the kid and point a finger right at her \"Me and you gotta have a long chat. I got time and I need a few answers ok?\" I ask as kindly as I could as I kneel to look her in the eyes.\n\nGoddamnit, she has my eyes too...",

            "comment": "A deep shade of red was the last thing I saw as my eyes closed tightly, never to open again. The paralyzing agony that seared through my veins, centred around the deep gash in my throat through which the slowly coagulating fluid was gushing.\n\nI could feel the warmth of the blood trickling across my chest, dying my favourite white dress red.\n\nIt had been a night of completely bad decisions, was one of my final thoughts...\n\nI knew when I left my home only a few hours ago that it was a bad idea. \n\nWhat was the point in going out to a bar this late at night when I had work in the morning?\nWhy had I decided to take that shortcut through the back road instead of just walking the few more blocks in the safety of the streetlights?\n\nSo, as I lay there, blood saturating my brand new dress, I allowed myself to feel nothing but regret for leaving without telling my mother where I was going? Who would tell her what had happened? Would she be okay?\nBarely eighteen and dead, what a twist of fate.\n\nRed was the first thing I saw when my eyes opened again. \nThat wasn't expected - was I in hell?\nI couldn't think of anything that I had done in only eighteen years that could equate to a lifetime of burning flames.\n\nI was corrected quickly when the red that obscured my vision began to shrink only to reveal itself as one of those hideous glittery ribbons that perched itself atop the head of a young girl with long blonde hair.\n\n\"Wha...\" my voice came out in a garbled mess, too quiet and hoarse to be my own. \n\nHer wide eyes were alight with something I hadn't seen in my own in many years - innocence?\n\n\"What's your name?\" She asked in her little soprano, not waiting for me to answer as she continued with her line of questioning, \"I'm Ellie? Are you my new friend? Will you play with me?\"\n\nSurrendering myself to the order disguised as a question, I nodded and followed her over to the small round table surrounded by dolls and teddies. The ground below my feet felt like air, too soft and light to be normal. When I looked down to see the pink carpet through my transparent heels, caked in mud that thankfully wasn't being trailed across the room. Specifically, the pair of brand new scarlet heels I had bought only that morning - I couldn't even bring myself to be too surprised; nothing was typical about this situation.\n\nWas this my life for the foreseeable future? A child's invisible playmate?\n\nOh Christ, was my old imaginary friend really a dead old man? That was so wrong!\n\n\"Your dress is so pretty!\"\n\nWith that thought, I wondered what I looked like; if I was wearing the same heels as I had when I had been murdered over only a purse holding nothing more than twenty pound and a half used lip balm, chances were, my looks would be scarring this little girl sitting opposite me wearing what could only be described as a childish expression of curiosity. I hoped for her sake that there wasn't a huge gaping hole in my throat, at least.\n\nWith a final sigh, I forced a smile onto my previously red painted lips and lifted the tiny teacup that barely fit into my hand, raising it to a position where we could clink both together, \n\n\"Cheers.\"\n\n\n\n----\n\nFirst time I've posted on here after months of reading. Hope this is okay...",

            "comment": "The final shrill note of the monitor faded from my ears, leaving me alone in silence deeper than I could ever imagine. There wasn't black so much as... nothing. No shiny gates rising out of fluffy clouds, no cherubs bobbling around overhead with their harps, no big guy to judge me, nothing. Not even fire and brimstone, just... nothingness in every direction.\n\nI knew I didn't have a body anymore, the aches and pains, the pressure of gravity, all of that was missing. Instead, I was just something like a consciousness spreading throughout this space.\n\nThe silence stretched on for what felt like eons, until I stumbled across a faint light. It was like pouring myself into a glass to try and get to it, squeezing and sloshing against the boundaries of whatever this space was, until I found the source; A tiny rip, no wider than a human pinky, stretching and widening into a hole.\n\nWith all the effort I could summon, I shoved at it, trying to get whatever was \"me\" in. With a sudden burst of relief, I felt myself flung violently, catapulted from the dark place I'd been before.\n\nThe light was blinding, spilling in from several windows framed with pink fabric and off-white lace. The walls almost matched, a white horizontal bar separating the colors. Shelves lined the walls, holding toys and books. I started turning to take in more of the room when a tiny voice pierced the quiet. \"Hello there, Mr. Wibbles. Have you accepted your in-vite-tation\"\" she asked, splitting the last word. \"That dress simply won't do, this is a *nice* party.\"\n\nI looked down, only faintly able to see myself. My arms, always muscular and hairy, seemed almost sad in their state after the battle I lost. My watch and tattoo were still on my wrist, and I otherwise looked normal, but the hospital gown looked like it had seen better days. Some gross blue-green-yellow polka dotted thing clung to me, and I sighed, surprising myself at the noise. \"Sorry, kiddo, I didn't choose it.\" I told her, not expecting a response.\n\nShe tutted, shaking her head like my wife always did. \"Come now, Mr. Wibbles, that's a... a poor excuse.\" The fake posh accent she'd been using fell, and she smiled up at me. \"We simply **must** make it better.\" She sttepped carefully, her lips forming numbers as she stepped away from the table toward her closet, her hand scrabbling for the knob. She twisted it, throwing it opened, and felt around, lifting a massive feather boa in all of the colors of the rainbow. Next came a large strip of fabric, like a huge scarf or a small blanket.\n\nHer mouthing continued, nearly silently counting as she stepped back to the table, grabbing the edge of it as she passed. She looked straight at me, then smiled wide. \"Kneel down, please.\" she asked, holding out her arms.\n\nI did, my knees not cracking or popping for the first time in a very long time. She lifted the cloth first, draping it over me like a shawl. It wrapped loosely around my shoulders, topped with the boa. \"Better?\" I asked her, and her toothy grin widened, showing her missing teeth.\n\n\"Much.\" she responded. She grabbed my wrist, helping me up, and guided me to the table. With her left foot, she slid out the tiny stool, running her hand over the edge of the table as she walked to the child sized armchair on the other side.\n\nI sat slowly, folding my knees up under the shawl as I did so. I lifted the cup, pretending to smell the tea, when she raised an eyebrow. \"Mr. Biggles, the cup is empty.\" she told me, grabbing the pot. \"Would you like some?\"\n\nI nodded, putting some of her accent in my farmer's drawl. \"That would be marvelous, m'lady.\" The giggle she gave me made it all worth feeling silly.\n\n\"I'm Emily, silly, not 'my lady'.\" She poured the \"tea\", really just water, and I lifted it to my lips, sipping it quietly. \"I have a question, though.\" I nodded, looking her in the eyes. \"Why can I see you?\"\n\nI sipped the tea again, then shrugged. \"No idea.\"",

The  last thing I remember was falling asleep in my own bed and now I was in a  pink-explosion of a room. A half constructed doll castle and a glittery  array of shoes covered the floor, I carefully avoided as the little  girl led me to a sparkly table. My fellow dinner guests were a drooping  monkey, a manically smiling crab and a unfilled teapot.\u00a0  \n\"Some  tea?\" The girl asked, she looks at me expectantly and when I don't  answer she promptly pretends to pour the teapot into my lap.  \n\"Where are your parents?\" I question her, I feared their reaction upon seeing me, a strange man, in their daughter's bedroom.\u00a0  \n\"Who cares.\" She shrugs.\u00a0  \n\"I don't think I should be here.\" I say and she scowls at me.  \n\"Stop being boring.\" She pouts, and offers her glass for me to fill up.

I look down to see a azure prom- style dress where previously had  been my casual white t-shirt and jeans.  \nI gasp with amazement, \"How did you do that?\"  \n\"With magic of course.\" She smiles, mollified.  \n\"You can be Princess Man now. More tea?\"\u00a0  \nI heard a thundering up the house's stairs and before I could hide, a youthful woman appeared in the door way.\u00a0  \nI stood up instantly, apologies at the ready but she didn't even question my presence.  \n\"Sophie. Dinner is ready.\"  \n\"I'm not hungry. I had tea already with my friends.\" Sophie doesn't even look up at her mother.\u00a0  \n\"I'm  so sorry.\" I say. \"I don't know how I got here.\" Adrenaline is rushing  through me and I can feel my heart falter out of fear, but both of them  ignore me. I was expecting to be led out in handcuffs, not this.  \n\"You  need to eat.\" Sophie's mum pushes. \"Please Sophie. We need to talk  about your dad.\u00a0 I've sorted out his will today and could really do with  you joining me. He wouldn't want you to stop eating.\"\u00a0  \nA  will? At once I feel intense rush of pity for the little girl opposite  me, her face is a mask of forced bravery. The mother comes further into  the room and closer up, I see the unwashed hair, the wrinkled clothes  and the purple identions below her eyes. She looks blank and hollow.\u00a0  \n\"You  should go eat with your mother Sophie.\" I say quietly. \"Me, Mr Monkey,  Mr Crab, and Mrs Teapot will be hear when you get back.\"  \nSophie considers this, her eyes welling before standing up and taking her mother's hand.\u00a0  \n\"Bye Princess Man\" She says softly over her shoulder.  \n\"Bye Princess Sophie.\"  \n\"Which toy is Princess Man?\" Her mother asks.  \n\"He's not a toy. He's my new friend.\"  \n\\*\\*\\*  \nThat  was the first time I met Sophie. Over the years we developed a close  bond. I helped her with her homework, I taught her how to play catch in  the back garden, I went to school with her and sat beside her during the  relentless bullying. She cried herself asleep a lot because she missed  her dad, but I was always there with a hug and a bed time story to  comfort her. I could not figure out why no one else could see me, I  assumed I had died and was a ghost or something. It did not bother me  because I had Sophie.\u00a0  \n\\*\\*\\*  \nIt  was on Sophie's fifteenth birthday that I found a different side to  her. I had met a lot of her friends over the years, but on that night, a  special person was introduced to me.  \n\"I  really like him Dan,\" she said, holding out her hand for the mascara. I  passed it over, watching Sophie examine herself in the mirror.  \n\"You look gorgeous.\" I say, but she's frowning at her reflection.  \n\"I'm scared he won't like me.\"\u00a0  \n\"Of  course he will, you're -\" I start to say but the doorbell downstairs  rings. Without acknowledging me, Sophie takes one final glance at the  mirror before racing downstairs. I'm left pacing around the room, she  usually takes me with her everywhere but lately she had become a lot  more distant. I guess that was to be expected with teenagers.\u00a0  \nThe  room had changed a lot in the nine years I had occupied it, Sophie had  painted it red and had posters up of her favourite celebrities on the  walls. Mr Crab and Mrs Teapot had long since being boxed up and were  gathering cobwebs in the attic, and Mr Monkey seemed to spend an  extortionate amount of time down the side of Sophie's bed.\u00a0  \nHours  later, I hear the front door slam and the laughing voice of the leaving  party-goers make their way to the respective cars. Two sets of  footsteps come up the stairs and enter the room. Sophie's mum has been  working later and later in recent years so I assume correctly that  Sophie has brought up the boy she likes.\u00a0  \nHe's slight with dark hair, and a sneering smile. He looks around before making his way to the bed.  \n\"What  did you want to ask me?\" He asks, patting the space beside him. He  makes my skin crawl but Sophie is beaming at him so I say nothing.  \n\"I  just wanted to say that I thought you were really hot and I wondered if  you wanted to go out with me?\" She stammers and I feel second hand  embarrasment for her, her face looks as if it's going to erupt into  flames.\u00a0  \nThe boy laughs and my stomach turns over. His handsome face twists into a grimacing gargole's impression of a smile.  \n\"No.  Did you really think I would go out with you? You're insane. Insane  Sophie. Always crying in the toilets and your only friends are  imaginary.\"  \nSophie's face is blotched with stinging tears. But she speaks in a controlled voice.  \n\"If I didn't have friends, why would everyone come tonight?\"\u00a0  \n\"So  we could video you.\" He pulls his phone out of his top pocket and I see  it is on camera record mode. \"We got you drunk and made you do  embarassing things. But this is a new low even for you Insane Sophie. I  can't believe you thought I would go out with you!\" He cackles cruelly  and zooms in on her crying face.  \nI  cannot contain myself anymore and move in to punch the boy, Sophie sees  me and shakes her head. \"No Dan!\" She wispers and I stop dead in my  tracks.  \n\"See you are  crazy, there is no Dan.\" The boy saves the video before getting up to  leave. \"See you on Monday Sophie.\" He grins evilly.\u00a0  \nSophie sits like a statue until we hear him exiting the house then she turns and sobs into her pillow.  \nI go to comfort her, my mind racing with what I could do to stop the video from going viral around Sophie's school.  \n\"I'm so sorry Sophie.\" I pat her on the back and them jump back in surprise as she whirls up at me.  \n\"It's  all your fault.\" She screams. \"It's all your fault why I don't have  friends. They call me insane because of you. I want REAL friends.\"  \n\u00a0She is hysterical now, tears stream down her face. \"I want you gone. GONE.\"  \n   \n\"Sophie please. You have me, we don't need anyone else -\"  \n\"Go!\" Her voice breaks. It all goes black for me.",

But won't you be embarrassed of me in front of your  friends?\" I ask, remembering her teenage sorrow.  \nShe shook her head. \"No. My real friends and fianc\u00e9 love me, they don't mind if I'm a little insane.\"\u00a0  \nThe  organ music starts and she takes my hand as she did so many years  before and I can almost see those strap on fairy wings bob as we walk  down the aisle together.",

            "comment": "*I drove around the sharp curve, only to see a huge pick up truck right in front of my small car, on the wrong side of the road. I swerved, only to realize that was the wrong thing to do and I ended up driving off the cliff. I saw the forest, and the huge field with the barn at the other side of the valley. Everything was a blur, as I slammed against the steering wheel, passing out.*\n\nMy eyes fluttered open, and I looked around. I was in a pink room, with a bed in the corner with beanie babies covering it, a few missing. There was a toy box at the end of the bed, and a few toys scattered around the room. There was a tot table in the middle of the room, with a beautiful rug under it, with some stains on it. There was a six year old girl with tan skin, straight black hair and a red bow holding her hair into a ponytail. She had a pastel yellow and pink dress, dark brown eyes and she was playing with a white bear with red and blue stars on it. In another chair, there was a huge green and brown turtle plushie with a tea cup in front of it. The little girl raised her head, noticing me. \"Ms. Fox! Your here! Come join my tea party, we have business to discuss.\" The little girl chirped, getting up. She skipped over to me, grabbing my hand and dragging me over. She let go of my hand, and I sat down, dazed. \"Who- who are you?\" I stuttered as I was getting used to the little girl's room. \"Sakina Dodson! Don't you remember me, Mayor Rosa Fox?\" She kicked her legs under the table, and I noticed she had pastel purple flats. I blinked, looking around. \"Sakina, where are your parents?\" I asked, looking at the door. \"Mama's gonna come in with the cookies soon! Daddy is something that mom calls prison!\" I stared at Sakina, a bit surprised. **All right, dad's in prison and mom's going to sell cookies at her school's bake sale**. I thought, composing myself as I prepared for playing dress up or pretend or whatever kids do now days. \"Okay, Ms. Dodson, what would you like to discuss?\" Sakina immediately straightened, glancing at the small white bear plushie. \"Miss Spangle-\" She waved towards the July themed bear, \"would like to have a larger pay- money- paycheck? Cashcheck?\" Sakina stuttered at the end, not knowing what it was called. \"Paycheck, sweetie.\" I corrected, smiling at her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**{Thats all for now, after I've edited a bit, going to continue soon but i have two birds, maybe three soon and I have to play with them and change their stuff )**",

Mostly because he remembered the, you know, dying part. A heart attack is painful, tell you what. He\u2019d turned sixty-eight a few days before the heart attack that killed him on his bathroom floor as he was taking a long-awaited piss.\n\n*Oh well,* he thought, *can\u2019t be helped.*\n\nHe looked around, and saw that he was situated in an absurdly pink bedroom. A young girl\u2019s no, doubt. His deduction was confirmed a few moments later when he felt a tug on his hand.\n\n\u201cHi! Who are you?\u201d a little girl said happily. \n\n\u201cLarry. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cCassie!\u201d\n\n\u201cHi Cassie. This is your room, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup! Isn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor your demographic, maybe\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk funny, Mr. Larry,\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Well, you look funny\u201d\n\nShe giggled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just in time, we were just about to have a tea party,\u201d Cassie gestured to the other end of the room, where a small table and four small chairs were placed; two unoccupied, the others occupied by a large stuffed tiger and a collection of barbie dolls, respectively.\n\nCassie ran over and seated herself in one of the unoccupied chairs, and looked at Larry expectantly. A little girl\u2019s imaginary tea party was not how he\u2019d planned to spend his afterlife, but what the hell, right?\nHe sat down and nodded respectfully to the barbie dolls.\n\n\u201cLadies,\u201d he added politely.\n\n\u201cHave some tea!\u201d she exclaimed, pouring a big dollop of nothing into an undersized cup in front of him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t drink tea,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cCause I don\u2019t like it\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do you drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d get you a grown-up drink but I can\u2019t reach daddy\u2019s cabinet\u201d she said, sadly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it kid. I don\u2019t drink grown-up drinks either, not anymore anyway\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot going down that road with you, kid. How old are you anyway?\u201d\n\nCassie used to both of her small hands to count, and when she finished, she said, proudly:\n\n\u201cSix! I\u2019m six!\u201d\n\nLarry grunted.\n\nA lanky pre-teen with long black hair, his face buried in his phone suddenly appeared in the open doorway.\n\n\u201cHey loser, I\u2019m gonna go grab a pop tart from downstairs. You want one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t want a pop tart, Alex! And don\u2019t call me loser! That\u2019s mean!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever, loser\u201d said the pre-teen, leaving.\n\nLarry raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cThat your brother?\u201d\n\nCassie nodded.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a dick,\u201d\n\nCassie was shocked, and whispered:\n\n\u201cYou should put a quarter in the swear jar!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a ghost, kid. I don\u2019t need to put anything in anything anymore\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a ghost?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Say, your brother, his name\u2019s Alex?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a grandkid named Alex. How old is he, twelve?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so. You have a grandkid?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have two. A boy named Alex, and a little girl about your age\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her name!?\u201d she asked excitedly.\n\n\u201cCassandra,\u201d said Larry, without giving it much thought.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my name too!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought your name was Cassie,\u201d\n\n\u201cCassie is short for Cassandra you big dummy,\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not the one drinking imaginary tea here, girly,\u201d\n\nLarry was starting to feel uneasy. One kid sharing a name with one of his son\u2019s kids could be put down to a coincidence, but both of them?\n\n\u201cSay, where are your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cMommy\u2019s downstairs, and daddy\u2019s on his way to my grandpa\u2019s house!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour grandpa, eh?

I haven\u2019t met him yet, but daddy said he was gonna bring him to see us soon!\u201d\n\nLarry grunted.\n\n*Well at least my body\u2019s gonna be found before it rots.*\n\n\u201cGive me some of that tea after all, Cassie\u201d",

            "comment": "\"Hi, what's your name?\"\n\nI looked around, I was not familiar with my surroundings.  It looked like a child's room, but I didn't recognize WHO'S child it was.  There was a little girl sitting at a small table with a tea set.  On her left was a teddy bear, and on her right was a stuffed rabbit that looked a little worse for wear.  She pointed at the seat across from her, which was surprisingly empty.  \n\n\"Um, Hi...  I'm...  \" I thought for a moment, was I Robert, or Mr. Robert, or Mr. Anderson.  I wasn't sure how to answer.  I wasn't sure why, or how I was HERE more importantly.  There was something.  Something I couldn't remember yet.  It was on the cusp of my memory, but just outside, like when you cannot remember a person's name whom you've known for a long time. \"I'm Mr. Robert, or Robert, if you like\".\n\nShe looked at me for a moment, thinking about what I had said.  \"Okay, Mr. Robert.  Since you are older after all.  I should probably call you Mister.  I'm Ashley and I am six years old.\"  When she said six, she held up six fingers, like either I needed to see it, or perhaps she was proud of being on more than one hand in age.  \"Would you join me for tea?\"\n\n\"Tea?  You wouldn't happen to have coffee in any of those cups would you?\"  I think a cup of coffee might do me some good with my memory.\n\n\"Coffee's gross!  YUK!\" Ashley squealed.  \"Sit down and have some tea, I know you'll love it!\"\n\nI sat in the chair that initially looked very small, but when I sat down, I fit in it like I was one of the stuffed animals.  \n\n\"Sugar and Milk for your tea Mr. Robert?\", she asked as she poured \"tea\" into my cup.  \n\n\"Um, 2 sugars and some milk please.\"\n\nShe pantomimed putting milk and sugar in my cup, and stirred it with a spoon.  \"Go ahead an drink\", she exclaimed.\n\nI put the tea cup to my lips, expecting air, and WOAH, there was tea with milk and sugar going into my mouth, although I did not see it IN the cup.  Well, this was just weird.  \"It's delicious!\", I didn't have to pretend that part, it was really good tea.  Ashley giggled in her chair as she \"drank\" her tea.\n\n\"ASHLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!\"  The sound of her name made her jump a little bit.  \n\n\"Yes I'm here\" she said looking a little nervous.  \n\n\"GET DOWN HERE....  NOW!!!!\", the voice boomed like it was being pumped through PA system.\n\n\"Don't worry, they can't see you or hurt you, Okay?\" she whispered to me.  I wasn't sure why she was speaking so softly.  She looked genuinely nervous, or scared.\n\n\"Oh I'm not scared.\"  I stood up from the chair resuming my \"regular\" height as compared to a 6 year old.  She ran to the door and opened it and I followed.  The house was a normal looking ranch house that I still did not recognize.  I still had no idea why I was here, either.\n\n\"ASHLEY! Why are't you HERE now???\"\n\n\"I'm coming. \", she turned to look at me and held her finger to her lips in the universal sign for 'hush'.\n\nWe walked into the living room.  Her parents were sitting on the couch with TV trays in front of them.  There was a third tray with a meal on it in front of a child sized chair.  I looked at the food on her tray.  Chicken nuggets and carrots.  looked like milk in a cup to drink.  As she sat down, she accidently knocked over her milk.  as it started to top, I grabbed it, and only a drop spilled.  The odd thing was her parents did not react to my being there in general, but when I saved the milk, they both paled.  \n\n\"Be careful, Ashley,\" her mom said with a wild look in her eyes.  \n\n\"I will, Thank you Mr. Robert, I'll take that milk now\".  I didn't realize I was still holding the milk, and I handed it to Ashley.  \n\n\"Ashley, who is Mr. Robert?\"\n\n\"He's my new friend Mommy!  He had tea with me this afternoon!\"\n\n\"He DID? where did he come from?\"\n\nAshley shrugged her shoulders.  \"I don't know.  I do know he was a great guest at my tea party, and when he goes on, he's going to be very happy.  Not like Mr. Lambert who was her last week.\"\n\n\"Are you sure Mr. Lambert is gone?\" the dad said slowly.\n\n\"Yes Daddy.  He was not nice, was he?\"\n\n\"No, he was not.\"\n\nI walked over to the other side of the room to see the parents better and noticed a bruise on the cheek of her father.  I reached for the front door.  \n\n\"You don't want to go out there yet.\" Ashley said very cautiously.  It's not time.  You have to wait.  We'll have more tea, then it will be time.  You've done really well with this part of the test.  I believe you will have a very fun afterlife.\"\n\nAshley grew older in front of me over a matter of seconds, I saw her parents get older and the room changed,  \"I believe it's time for you to move on.\" she said as she rubbed her pregnant belly.\n\n\"Honey, get the car, it's time!\" she said as I felt a pulling motion I was shrinking and becoming light which zoomed into her belly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it is dark, I'm scared, I don't know what's happening, but I feel like I am trapped.  What is going to happen?",

A keening wail sounding distant, but insistently knocking on the edges of my awareness,\u00a0 like a prisoner pounding his fists on the cold empty walls of his cell.\u00a0\u00a0Help had arrived.\u00a0 A wary relief,\u00a0 then darkness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA sense of action and urgency,\u00a0 motion.\u00a0 Memories made from TV, ones I'd never expected to own personally.\u00a0 Pressure on the sides of me, a neck brace.\u00a0 The sound of clattering wheels,\u00a0 rectangles made of light moving swiftly across my personal landscape,\u00a0 a gurney; a hospital ceiling.\u00a0 I've been transported, that much I know.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's all I know until I become aware of a faint beeping. I fade out again.\u00a0\n\n\"CLEAR!\"\u00a0\nMy chest\u00a0 is violently wretched up.\u00a0\n\n\"CLEAR!\"\nMy body zings with electricity,\u00a0 I'm strangely aware of my body hair standing at attention.\u00a0\n\n\"CLEAR!\"\u00a0\nI feel my shoulders hit the bed and keep falling.\u00a0 The rest of me goes with them,\u00a0 falling, falling,\u00a0 falling.\u00a0 I think I can just barely hear the faint beeping noise, now just a single flat tone.\n\nI feel a draft.\u00a0 Simply having senses again is a shock.\u00a0 I think back to my last memories.\u00a0 Surely that last noise was my heart monitor,\u00a0 I must have been dead.\u00a0 Which means... I must have been revived. I should be ecstatic,\u00a0 my brain tries to fill me with gratitude,\u00a0 I think it's the shock.\u00a0 I can't even feel properly ashamed of not being thrilled.\u00a0 That's ok, it will come later.\u00a0\n\nI open my eyes expecting to see white walls, maybe a nurse. Through my grogginess I can tell I'm being attended.\u00a0 Something is out of place though.\u00a0 What is it? Here is my nurse,\u00a0 she has stringy blond hair,\u00a0 why isn't it tied back? Her face,\u00a0 it doesn't have the calculated look I've come to expect from hospital workers.\u00a0 The room... the room is... pink?\n\nAll at once it hits me, I'm being cared for by a child.\u00a0 Im in a 6 year olds bedroom.\u00a0 This isn't where I'm supposed to be,\u00a0 what's going on?!\n\"Now Miss Penny your gonna need lots of rest.\u00a0 Drink lots of fluids and take your medicine\", the girl has been chatting at me for a while now.\u00a0\nI stare dumbfounded as she pretends to take my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"Mmmhmm, that's what I thought\", she says seriously. \"Eleventy over ten.\" She nods to herself knowingly.\u00a0 \"Now Miss Penny,\u00a0 it's time to take your temperature,\u00a0 open wide and say 'ahh'\"\n\nMy mouth opens.\u00a0 It says 'ah'.\u00a0\nDid I do that?\u00a0\n\"Who are you?\" I ask.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Your nurse of course. You've been in a very bad accident. Yup. Bad a lot. You've got 100 broken bones.\"\n\"No I don't\" I begin to reply,\u00a0 no sound comes out and it doesn't matter anyway.\u00a0 Suddenly my whole world is on fire.\u00a0 I can't see through the pain,\u00a0 I try to scream but nothing happens.\u00a0 Im locked in it.\u00a0\u00a0\nI can hear her babbling but can't understand through my torment.\u00a0 My mouth opens and she pretends to put a spoon in my mouth.\u00a0 I swallow. The pain dissipates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"See, all better!\" She says. \"That's why you have to take your medicine\". My limbs feel normal again.\u00a0 I sit up.\u00a0 I try to run.\u00a0\n\"Now now, you can't be going out with those broken bones like that\" she scolds.\u00a0 Instantly I'm back in bed.\u00a0 I can't move most of my body... she's remembered that Im supposed to be broken, so I am.\u00a0\n\nIt seems my experiences are dependent on her imagination.\u00a0 Her play.\u00a0 I need to think. I need to figure out how to communicate,\u00a0 or escape.\u00a0\n\nLater.\u00a0\n\nI know now that her dream is to become a doctor.\u00a0 Or maybe an EMT. She's smart,\u00a0 I know she can accomplish what she wants.\u00a0 She takes inspiration from TV shows.\u00a0 And practices on me.\nI'll never forget the feeling of having my eyelids being melted shut with fire.\u00a0 The special that week was the burn unit.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe more she learns,\u00a0 the worse it becomes.\u00a0 More details equal more trauma.\u00a0 I can still smell my flesh decaying from leprosy,\u00a0 the pain of being amputated without painkillers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIm also extremely grateful to her. Or I guess,\u00a0 dependent.\u00a0 She cares for me.\u00a0 Gives me medicine.\u00a0 It wasn't her fault I was in such pain,\u00a0 she just forgot to administer the anesthesia.\u00a0 It wasn't out of malice.\u00a0 Although,\u00a0 sometimes,\u00a0 her imagination gets exceedingly dark.\u00a0 Those are troubled times for me.\u00a0\n\nToday she's been telling me all about \"youth in Asia\" and I pray desperately that when she puts me down it'll be for good.\u00a0 Whatever hell or purgatory this is,\u00a0 I can't stand it. I pray for a final death.\u00a0\n\nEverything goes black as she sticks me with the imaginary needle.\u00a0\u00a0\n...\n\nDamn. Im still here.\u00a0 It didn't work.\u00a0 I groan inwardly,\u00a0 waiting for whatever hell is in store.\u00a0 Waiting to be given a direction. Waiting to comply.\u00a0 Nothing happens.\u00a0 I open my eyes cautiously.\u00a0\n\"Oh,\u00a0 your awake! We were getting afraid that you wouldn't.\u00a0 It's good to see you.\" There is a nurse,\u00a0 a real nurse bustling around me, checking my pulse; my temperature. Im in a hospital,\u00a0 a REAL hospital.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"Who are you?\" I ask. Uneasily recognizing those first words as the ones I did when I woke up in hell.\u00a0\n\"My name is Nurse Jackie hun, your in Saint Christopher's hospital- trauma ward.\u00a0 You've been delt a bad blow.\u00a0 I'll just need to ask you some questions, standard procedure...\"\n\nShe comes round the bed, I catch sight of her yellow hair, a flash of her eyes. She starts to say something comforting to me,\u00a0 but I can't hear her.\u00a0\n\nIm screaming.\u00a0 Screaming for all the pain and torture I was put through.\u00a0 Screaming for all the unheard ones I never was allowed to utter.\u00a0 Her eyes widen in fright and she disappears,\u00a0 \nmaybe to get someone. It doesn't matter,\u00a0 the screams tear my throat out and still they come.\u00a0\n\nI don't know if they'll ever stop.\u00a0",

            "comment": "My name is Ellie now.\n\nThe only one who can see me is a little girl, just barely reaching the age of six, with mud brown hair falling in chaotic ringlets and eyes the color of the inside of a kiwi. She seems oddly familiar. But I don't know where I saw her before.\n\nI don't know how I got here, all I remember is rain pounding on the windshield as I fell asleep in the back seat. Letting Derek take over driving for the night since I can't stand them, I don't like not being able to see past the minimal light that your headlights reach with into the darkness trying to grasp the unseen, as your tires eat the road. We were going to our parents anniversary, I was so excited, we hadn't seen them since we left for the city to \"follow our dreams\" seven years prior. I remember the despair I felt when I realized my dreams were childish and naive. But I couldn't admit it to them, I was stubborn, still am. So I continued reaching for the unseen and unattainable in denial of my idiocy.\n\nBut now I'm here. Sitting across from a child with crooked and dirty crown on her head as she asks me if I want 'one lump or two' her kiwi eyes blinking up at me questioningly.\n\n\"Two, I've always had a sweet tooth\" I answer, still trying to figure out what exactly is going on, why no one else can see me except this child. Why I'm even here in the first place.\n\nGiggling she \"scoops\" two empty spoonfuls of sugar into my teacup before \"pouring\" tea into it from an empty teapot. \"Well Milady Ellie\" she starts before sipping from her empty teacup with flourish, putting out her pinky to show good manners, after all she is the Queen. \"How is the Kingdom I gave you doing? Taking care of the people well?\" She finishes elegantly, saying it with a slight lisp.\n\nPicking up my tea I hold it up to my mouth acting like I'm drinking. Might as well play along, and make the best of whatever is going on. \"Oh, just swell darling\" I pronounce over accentuated in a snobbish voice making her giggle again. \"The Kingdom is doing just amazing, and the people? Oh, even better!\" I end with a slight British accent, butchering it horrendously.\n\n\"That's great Milady Ellie! How are the kids?\" She asks, probably hearing it from the adults around her.\n\nKids, that's another reason I left to the city. Escaping through my bedroom window at two fifteen with only a backpack and the clothes I had on me. I had to walk till morning before I reached my older brother's apartment, he moved to the bad side of town because our parents would never guess that would be where he would go. He only told me. Anyways, after that night I never went back because my parents are strict, more than strict. So I left when I found out I was pregnant. Had twins 9 and a half months later. Two beautiful baby boys I named Tyler, after my grandfather, and Rhylin, after their father. Grandfather was the only one to show me love, other then my brother, before he died when I was fourteen peacefully in his sleep of old age. As for the father, I loved him. But he couldn't handle the commitment. So I left.\n\n\"Hello? Milady Ellie?\" Focusing back on the little girl I notice her reach out her hand to touch me in concern.\n\nMoving my arm away before she can touch it I wipe the tears rolling down my face before sniffling then putting a fake smile on it. \"Yeah honey, I'm fine.\" I utter in a soft rasp before clearing and saying louder in the same snobbish accent, \"The kids are great! How about some croissants? Maybe some mini sandwiches for a snack?\"\n\nPerking up she bolts for the door \"YEAH! SNACK TIME!\" she yells behind herself at me while running.\n\nGetting up I follow her out into the hallway covered in soft carpet before abruptly stopping at the kitchen that has tan tile floors. I see the little girl pulling on a young woman's pant leg while asking for croissants, mini sandwiches, and other various snacks for her tea party. The woman looks familiar. Extremely familiar. She hasn't even turned around yet. But I could recognize those chocolate colored curls going down her familiar shoulders before stopping at her familiar hips. That lead to her familiar legs and familiar feet anywhere.\n\nI know where I am now. I know what's happening. I understand what's going on. I died. I can see that now.\n\nI guess it is true you see your life over again when you die. I guess I just didn't realize I would be my own imaginary friend.",

            "comment": "\"I forgot the cookies!\" the young, red-headed girl dashed out of her pink room. Elena heard her small feet patter down a flight of stairs. She sighed in relief now that she had a moment alone. Bubblegum pink walls were decorated with posters of horses and unicorns. The bed was wearing a thick comforter dotted with princess wands and crowns. The cozy room reminded her of her own when she was a child; when she was alive. Elena could not remember how it happened, but she knew she was dead. She woke up to see a tiny pair of violet eyes looking down at her, after several minutes she was drafted into a tea party.\n\n\"Just checking in,\" a woman said behind Elisa while she was admiring the room. \"Any questions?\" she asked. Elisa recognized the voice and turned to see an olive-skinned woman smiling at her from a corner of the room. A bright blue star with the number 35 was tattooed on her left cheek. Long sea-green curls flowed down her shoulders and onto the navy-blue business jacket. She wore a navy sarong instead of slacks. Elena recognized her case-worker.\n\n\"Hey, Isla. Imaginary friend duty?\" Elena asked. Isla nodded. \"How long?\" Isla shrugged.\n\n\"When she outgrows you, or you're ready to try again. Whichever happens first.\"\n\n\"I'm still kind of foggy. Did I choose this?\" Elisa asked. Isla shook her head but grinned broadly.\n\n\"I'm trying something new,\" she said. Elena did not know why, she never did, but the thought sent a worried, amused shiver down her spine. Somehow she felt like Isla 'trying something new' happened a lot, and tended to go badly. The smiling woman noticed Elena's concern and immediately raised her hands to protest. \"Don't worry! I got Ezey's permission this time, it's all on the up and up,\" she said. That made Elena feel better.\n\n\"Okay,\" she asked. \"What am I doing here?\"\n\n\"You don't remember it, but it was your idea,\" Isla said. She crossed her arms and shifted her weight to one leg. \"That's probably why Ezey okayed it; it didn't come from me,\" she said. She clicked her tongue in annoyance at the thought. It never occurred to her before. \"Anyway, congratulations! You created a new perk, so that means you get it for free.\" Elena's eyes widened as the memory of her last visit with Isla flooded her mind.\n\n\"I got Imaginary Mentor!?\" she hopped out of the tiny plastic chair at the girl's tea table and dashed across the room to hug Isla. She put her hands out to stop Elena.\n\n\"Tentatively,\" she said. \"This is the first time we're trying something like this. Consider it a test run. If the results are *too* beneficial...,\" she sighed. \"Ezey made me promise to wipe the results, then you can try again with better guidelines.\"\n\n\"Oh, this is so awesome!\" Elena gave up on trying to hug the woman and dropped her arms. \"So she's my-,\"\n\n\"I hope you like cake!\" the little girl walked back into the room holding a dad-sized piece of chocolate cake. \"We didn't have any more cookies. Who's that?\" she asked without missing a beat. Isla smiled.\n\n\"I'm her boss. I had a lot of people fighting to be *your...,\"* Isla pointed at the girl. \"...imaginary friend. Elena here is the best one we have and she's going to take great care of you.\" The girl's violet eyes sparkled.\n\n\"Elena? That's my name too!\" the girl said. Isla put her hand to her chest and gasped in mock surprise. \"What a coincidence!\" Isla looked at the cake with exaggerated hunger, then she looked at the girl. \"Elena, I have to go have a meeting with some other friends but that cake looks so good. Can you bring me a piece I can take with me?\" Little Elena nodded eagerly then dashed out the door. Isla turned back to the dead woman.\n\n\"You can't tell her you're her Zero. You can't tell her which perks to choose, or anything about points or the afterlife. All you can do is try to guide her and give her advice.\" Elena nodded.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThank you for reading!

            "comment": "The pills hadn't worked after all. I was still in bed, and when I tried going downstairs, my parents were busy talking with guests. They all ignored me, as usual. Erupting with anger, I tried to think up what I was going to say to my parents once the guests I didn't know had gone, when a little girl, probably the daughter of a guest, came up to me and asked to play.\n\nI was relieved that the drugs hadn't made me giddy or sick, but I was still a little pissed off.\n\nI was pleased to finally have someone to talk to - it felt like some sort of reward after all I had suffered - but someone my age and her don't really have much in common, and being in a bad mood didn't make me feel much like playing. \n\nI tried to contain my irritation for this well-meaning young person and considered trying to tell her a story or teach her something, but immediately realized that it would be beyond her comprehension level, and that I would either come off as boring and intimidating by talking about dull adult stuff, or patronising by trying to speak at her level. \n\nShe led me along and started trying to attract the attention of the guests and my parents. I was initially very pleased that she was vouching for me, as she tried to introduce me to her parents, but being a toddler, she was ignored, too.\n\nThen she tried to introduce me to my own parents. It was more than a little surreal, but I suppose that's the kind of non-logic a five year old would come up with. Actually, she was six - her parents stated it proudly - but I wasn't aware of that. \n\nSeems like a minor distinction, but perhaps she wouldn't have bothered talking to me if she was five and would have ran away crying instead.\n\nThen, things started getting really bizarre. First, I noticed that my parents were talking about me while I was still in the room. This would have been plausible enough, but they weren't making commentary - they didn't seem to realize I was there at all, even though I yelled and was right in front of them.\n\nThat's when I stood right in front of all of them, and her parents, along with my entire family, said flat out that there was nobody there. It wasn't a prank; their tone was too convincing.\n\nNext, I realized that what I'd been through hadn't been real at all. I looked down to my feet only to realize there were no feet - nothing at all, in fact. I began to wonder what sort of person would be sick enough to put a VR machine on me before I woke up, only to find that my entire body felt numb and there was nothing on my head.\n\nThose drugs must have been strong after all, then. I wondered when this weird - was it a hallucination? a dream? both? would be over.\n\n\nWell, it still isn't over.",

            "comment": "Todd blinked in confusion.\nTodd knew he was just scuba diving, fixing an issue with his regulator, but now he was now in a small gloomy and green child\u2019s room.  \nTodd was confused.\n  \nTodd looked around the room that was covered orderly white wooden and slotted bins all along the walls, which were dark green and paisley textured. There was a white writing desk in the corner and a floral patterned couch in the middle of the far wall.\nHe came back to the little girl that he had first noticed. She looked at him, patiently, through large red horn rimmed glass that had no lenses and kept slipping down her tiny nose. She looked down, adjusted her pink dotted dress, pushed her glasses back on her face before looking up at Todd and asking:\n\n\u201cPardon me, sir. I asked if you would like a seat at our table? We weren\u2019t expecting more guests, but we would be so grateful if you would join our party. Isn\u2019t that right Mrs. Featherton?\u201d\n\nThe little girl, brushing her shiny curls from her face, looked over at the seat to her left where a stuffed goose sat, dressed in a floppy sunhat with a pearl necklace that slunk like snakes coiling into a knot around her neck, stared blankly, unresponsive, straight ahead.  \nTodd had not expected it to answer.  \nIt didn\u2019t.  \nTodd felt relieved by this.  \n\n\u201cPlease, sit.\u201d the girl beckoned him over and pointed with small finger poking out from her laced and ruffled covered fist, to the empty chair to her right\n\nTodd felt uncomfortable being in a stranger\u2019s place, but felt more uncomfortable about rejecting a little a child\u2019s invitation to tea, so he thanked his host and fumbled with the small seat until he was sat awkwardly at the table, but not before falling over backwards.\nTwice.\n\n\u201cWell, that was spectacular.\u201d The child voiced with glee. \u201cYou looked so funny I\u2019m going to call you...\u201d she trailed off into a hum as she tilted her head. She was looking up to some distant point only she could see, a single finger rested to the side of her, before startled with she gasp of delight, snapped her fingers and excitedly declared:\n  \n\u201cMr. Funny Bunny!\u201d\n  \nTodd felt a stabbing prick and a sucking pop on both his ears. The shock of pain made him screech as he flinched and reached for his ears, his hands bumped into something soft and fuzzy. He grabbed the object and at the same time felt the tip of his ear being grabbed. Still holding the tip of his ear, he pulled his hand in front of him.\n  What he saw was his hand holding a large floppy bunny dolls ear.  \n  Todd pulled his hand away in shock, the ear flopping out of his view.\n  \nTodd had fallen out of the chair again and was anxiously scrambling to get back in it. The child giggled in the background as he got in the chair once more.   \nHe looked desperately at the girl for any kind of help, and he was about to ask for it when the girl, still laughing from his toppling over, haltingly said:\n\n\u201cMr. Funny Bunny, you are-\u201c   \n  \nTodd felt the stabbing prick and sucking pop spreading all over his face.\n  \n\u201c- a silly one. Aren\u2019t you, sir?\u201d\n  \nTodd once again tried to ask for help to get any kind of explanation of how he got here or what was happening to him, but his mouth wouldn\u2019t move.  \n  \nTwisting his head, Todd tried to stretch and contort his jaw, but couldn\u2019t.\nReaching to pry his mouth open, his hand grasped for his lips, but the slipped off something cool and stiff hard before grabbing fuzzy cloth. His hand scrambled and scratched at his face, his fingernails clinking hollowly against what sounded like hard plastic.\nTodd began to blindly panic.\n\nTodd bolted up out of his seat, banging his head on the chandelier again. Rubbing his head, he scanned the room again.  \nThe door.\nHad he seen a door?\nTodd had noticed in his shock earlier that there was no door in the room.\nHe could not find one now.\n  \nBopping into the chandelier a third time, Todd made his way free of the hanging obstacle and turned towards the couch.\n  \n\u201cWhere are you going Mr. Funny Bunny the te-\u201c\n\nMore pricks and pops.  \n  \nThis time screaming down his arms like fireants digging out their home under his skin and in his muscles.\nHis chest trembled, like a rat thrashing in a cage, with a scream that couldn\u2019t escape.\n  \n\u201c-a has not been served yet and it won\u2019t if you keep behaving badly.\u201d She said sternly in a nasally clipped tone.\n\n\nTodd, bringing his arms up in front of him he was stricken with a white, cold terror.  \nToy doll paws on plump and soft velvety arms are what his eyes showed him. Telling his arms to wiggle, he only saw the soft fuzzy limbs flop back and forth.\nTodd was losing it.\n\nTodd ran for a wall where he started to beat on it with his stuffed velvet limbs. Finding his fists\u2019 effort futile, he began manically kicking and  jumping at the wall with his half plush body, knocking toy bins over spilling stuffed animals and dolls across the room.  \nTodd does not care.  \n  \n\u201cWhy what a weird dance.\u201d The child bubbled with a giddiness. \u201cMr. Funny Bunny, It is n-\u201c\n  \nSearing pain punctures his legs and abdomen. His sides strain as he feels muscle rip and spasm. He is falling as his legs become as weightless as a ball of cotton.   \n\n\u201c-ot time for dancing.\u201d She said curtly as she rose from her seat.   \n\nTodd hits the floor.\n\n\u201c Now come back to table for tea or you\u2019ll be excused from the party. Is that clear, Mr. Funny Bunny?\u201d the child says sternly.\n\nAcidic flashes melted trails of pain over and behind Todd\u2019s eyes.  \nHis eyes become locked open, staring blankly straight ahead, the box of dolls littering the floor filled his vision, each doll with a stiff blank stare on their face. \nPast the field of scatted toys with  staring eyes, Todd saw feet approaching.\n  \nTodd felt no connection to the rest of his body as something lifted him up. Just his sight, hearing and mind remained.  \nTodd goes numb.  \n  \nSinking into shock, he twists in the air until he is face to face with the little girl, which was now as large as a garage door, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but you are too rowdy for our tea party.\u201d she admonished, \u201cNow you will have to wait your turn, like all the other rude guests are, to join our party.\u201d She huffed in a hasty manner.  \n  \nTodd, tucked under one of the child\u2019s arms, watches her place the knocked over bin back in place. She drops Todd into it, then the other dolls are piled on top of him.   \nHis view is half blocked by a slat, but he can see the side profile of the necklaced goose, and the girls back as she sits down and scoots her chair in remarking:\n\n \u201cI apologize madame.\u201d the child humbly expressed, \u201cBut we can\u2019t have that kind of behavior at our party, now can we Mrs. Featherton?\u201d\n\nMrs. Featherton did not respond, she only stared, blankly, ahead.",

            "comment": "\"What?\"   \n\n\nI woke up from a bright light and saw pink paint. It reminded me of my room when I was little girl. There were shelves of stuffed animals... even a stuffed Pikachu. The room had a television with some game console. There was also surprisingly, a bunk bed that looked like mine. Everything was a little too reminiscent. Except for this little girl in a princess dress standing in front of me. She was kind of cute. I suddenly missed my kids.\n\n\"Hey!\" Said the little girl, \"I said 'Come play tea party.'\"  \n\n\n\"Oh, right!\" I told her. Might as well indulge until I figure out how to get home. She walked by her table though and pointed up at the Pikachu doll. \n\n\"What? You want Pikachu to have some tea?\" I asked her with a smile.\n\nThe little girl smiled and nodded her head. I reached for the stuffed toy and got it down for her. I've never seen a kid so happy. Well, that's a lie. But she was happy. She set up the table again and said, \"Sit.\"\n\nI pulled out one of her little chairs and sat on it. But it made me a little uncomfortable so I set it to the side and knelt at the table instead. The little girl looked at me curiously.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" She asked me.\n\n\"The chair is really tiny. I don't want to break it so I'll just sit like this. Is that okay?\" I asked her.\n\nShe shrugged and just poured the tea... *Wait. There's real tea coming out of this. THE TEA IS REAL!*\n\n\"What is this?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Tea. Taste it!\" She said so matter-of-factly that I laughed.\n\nI took a sip and it was cold. The girl had given me some cold Arizona iced tea. Her parents were probably going to be so pissed that their daughter was wasting the tea. There was something not quite right about this place though. Why did it look like my memories had been infiltrated and put on display? Who was this kid?\n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Akari.\" She said.\n\n\"Aw, really? I have a daughter named Akari!\" I told her. She smiled.\n\nI took some more sips of my tea. My eyes were looking for the can or jug she had gotten this stuff from. I needed more than just a few kiddie sized tea cups.\n\n\"Where's your Mommy and Daddy, Akari?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Daddy is downstairs with my brother. Mommy died three years ago.\" She said. She also sipped some tea. She seemed to be really composed about the loss. I didn't really get how some kids could be like that. \n\n\"What's your brother's name?\"\n\n\"Lucas.\"\n\nI almost dropped my cup. My son's name is Lucas. \n\n\"Hey, can I go use the potty?\" I asked like an idiot. Surely the girl knows what a bathroom is called. Before she could finish answering, I got up and walked into the hallway. I went downstairs and ran into a tall dark man in the kitchen. He was strong and handsome. He had dark skin and large brown eyes that would make a woman swoon when the sun hit them just right. He was my husband. That girl upstairs *was* my daughter. And I have been dead for three whole years.",

            "comment": "\"May you find the peace I couldn't give you.\" Mark muttered, throwing in a single sunflower in the hole, fluttering down in the dark pit. It landed without making a sound on the strange black box on the bottom. \"I'm going to miss you so much...\" His voice faded as tears overwhelmed him. The sound of rain dripping on the saggy ground was occasionally overtaken by a family member or a stranger Marlinda didn't recognize snorting their nose. *Maybe they all need a blanket and some tea too keep warm?* Marlinda thought, worried about them getting the sniffles. Mom made tea and snugged her in a warm blanket when she was sick and it always made her feel better.\n\nMarlinda didn't understand why everyone around her looked so gleam, meeting her family normally filled her with joy, but not this time. Her parents, her grandmother, and all the other faces she had never seen before were crying. And Uncle Mark was the saddest of them all. His eyes were streaming with tears, red and flustered. He looked like a completely different Uncle Mark. Marlinda couldn't remember him doing anything but smile at her -- He never cried. *Maybe it is because he can't find Aunt Alice?* Marlinda thought. Losing at hide and seek made her feel sad too. So she decided to help Uncle Mark, looking around the meadows surrounding them, searching behind the bushes and the trees, hoping to find the smiling face of Aunt Alice somewhere in the park. She always had the most amazing laugh when Marlinda found her. Alice always managed to make her feel happy. To cheer her up no matter how sad she felt. Marlinda was sure she'd be able to cheer Uncle Mark up. *Maybe she is behind one of the stones?* Aunt Alice had to be hiding somewhere; she always loved playing hide and seek with when she came to visit her. \n\nShe tried to walk away and take a look behind the strange stones. There were so many of them, more than she could ever count. \n\n\"Mommy, I wanna go look for Aunt Alice\" Marlinda said, poking her mom in the side to catch her attention. \"Mommy? Can I go look?\" She repeated.\n\nNormally Mom would laugh and smile at her, letting her go roam free. But her mom's hand gripped her tight -- too tight -- she was hurting her. Was she mad? She didn't know what she had done wrong to upset Mom so much. \"Mommy, you're hurting me.\"\n\n\"Oh... I'm sorry. What did you say? You want to go look for Aunt Alice?\" Mom asked, her voice sounded hoarse. \n\n\"I want to help Uncle Mark find her. He looks so sad. I think it's making him sick.\"\n\n\"Oh sweety. It's not like that. Alice is just... She is...\" She stopped as if unsure what to say. \"Marlinda my darling. Alice...isn't hiding.\"\n\n\"Then where is she?\"\n\nHer mom's gaze went to the black box, her eyes were filled with pain and sadness and something else when she looked at it. \n\n\"She's in there\" she whispered, nodding to the black box. \"She's dead, Marlinda. And she's never coming back.\"\n\n\"Is that why everyone is sad?\" Marlinda asked, suddenly understanding why everyone looked so sick.\n\nYes sweety... We miss her very much.\" Mom rasped, her voice wavered.\n\n\"Then why doesn't Aunt Alice just come out if it makes you and Uncle Mark so sad?\" Marlinda felt confused why Alice would suddenly decide to be dead and lay in the box. It was nothing for her to make people sad.\n\nHe mom sighed. Shaking her head at her question. \"I wish she could, sweety, I really wish that she could. But she can't. That's what being dead means. She's gone.\"\n\n\"Okay...\" Marlinda whispered, still confused about this 'dead'.\n\n**A few hours later.**\n\n\"Thanks for the tea Hannah, you're amazing.\" Mark said, his voice was still ragged. Mom, Mark and Marlinda were at home. Mark had gone home with them for a cup of tea which he craddled in his hands. He continued. \"It was a beautiful ceremony, I'm sure your sister would have loved it.\"\n\n\"Anything. Mark. Anything for you.\" Mom put her arm on his knee.\n\n\"Yeah...\" His voice faded.\n\n\"Mommy, what does being dead mean?\" Marlinda asked. She'd been thinking about this 'dead' for a while now but it didn't make sense. \"Where did Aunt Alice go?\"\n\nBoth looked at her with reddened eyes, tears formed anew. Mark face flushed white, smiling wanly. He tried hard to force a smile but failed spectacularly. His sobbing continued as it had done in the car ride home. Mom put her arms around him. \"Marlinda, go upstairs please. We need to be alone for a moment.\"\n\n\"But Mommy-\"\n\n\"Now Marlinda!\" Mom snapped. Marlinda felt shocked to hear the anger in her mom's voice. Instinctively, she backed away, tears welling. The look on her mother's face softened. \"Go play with your dolls, sweety.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where do you think Aunt Alice went Mr. Ding?\" Marlinda poured him some more tea in his plastic cup. Mr. Ding, the formless plushen doll, had donned a black cape, serious clothing to mirror the seriousness of the situation. Today he was special agent Ding, ready to help solve the case. \n\n\"I don't know Marlinda. But this dead place sure sounds scary!\" Agent Ding exclaimed.\n\n\"I guess so. Mom was crying.\" Marlinda mumbled. \"But she's mad at me too. She looked upset. Do you think her and Alice had a fight Mr. Woo?\"\n\nMr. Woo stared at her with glassy eyes, pondering on Marlinda's question. Contrary to Mr. Dings brazenness, the plastic doll always took his time with coming with an answer; but that made the answers better.\n\n\"I think Mom and Aunt Alice loved each other very much. Marlinda. She wouldn't leave her because of a fight.\"\n\n\"But why did she leave to dead? Why did she want to leave us?\" Marlinda felt herself crying too, thick tears streaming down her cheek filling the empty cup on the table.\n\n\"I don't think she wanted to.\" A new voice answered. A real voice. A sweet voice filled with pain.\n\n\"Aunt Alice?\" Marlinda perked up and looked right at the face she loved so much. She appeared translucent but was clearly Aunt Alice. She had the same beautiful sun-golden locks which flowed freely embellishing her fine features. Her nose perked up slightly, just the same. Alice's appearance radiated love, but her eyes seemed sad.\n\n\"Hi Marlinda.\" Alice said, grimacing.\n\n\"Aunt Alice! I've missed you so much!\" Marlinda exclaimed.\n\n\"I've missed you too Marlinda.\"\n\n\"You came back from dead! Mom said you left us forever!\"\n\n\"I'm not really back. I think.\" Alice turned her translucent hands, studying them. \"This is so strange.\"\n\n\"Do you want some tea?\" Marlinda said, picking up the pot. \"You can have Agent Ding's cup.\"\n\n\"Hey, that's my cup!\" Ding protested but the cup was snagged away before he could do anything about it. Marlinda started 'pouring'.\n\n\"Listen Marlinda, I'm not sure what's going on but I've got to tell you something.\"\n\n\"Oh. Okay.\" Marlinda stopped midway her pouring tea.\n\n\"Is Mark here?\" Alice looked around.\n\n\"He is downstairs. With Mom.\"\n\n\"Listen to me Alice. This is very, very important. You need to get him out of here. You need to get him away from your Mom. And you can't tell her about me.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. Why not?\"\n\nAlice picked up the cup and took a sip. \"Because...she did something...bad.\"\n\n\"Mom is bad?\"\n\nAlice paused, thinking about the question. \"No Marlinda. Doing bad things doesn't necessarily make people bad. It's why people do bad things that makes them bad -- In your mom's case she did it because of love.\" She sighed. \"I guess I understand.\"\n\n\"Is it because of Mom that you went to dead?\" Marlinda asked.\n\nAlice paused, looking at her niece intently as if seeing her now for the first time as a person. \"Yes... She made me dead. Listen Marlinda, tell him to look under the willow.\" \n\nShe started to fade, her body turning glassy with faded colors, but continued. \"Make sure you tell him!\"\n\n\"Aunt Alice.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Her voice fleeting.\n\n\"Where are you going now?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" She sounded scared.\n\n\"Will you think of me?\"\n\nAlice smiled one last time. It radiated love and peace. Marlinda hugged the sun-like image of her aunt. \n\n\"Always.\" She whispered. And with that she vanished. The cup fell on the table, ringing silently through the room. Leaving Marlinda completely alone.\n\nThe screams from downstairs rung through the house.",

            "comment": "There must be some kind of irony to the quiet and pleasant nature of my after life comparing it to the circumstances that led to my death. Being with the kid wasn't so bad, albeit it has been twenty minutes since I \"woke up\". Tea parties weren't exactly my thing, but with the alternative in mind I could get used to this. Or maybe I was speaking too soon, it could get boring.\n\nBut boring was fine. I expected flames and giant forks, and for some reason god saw fit to not give me that.\n\nIt was strange, and that was an understatement. In life, I had been a little bit more than a muscle for some drug dealer which name had been Dave, who wanted a strong, asiatic looking dude for bodyguard, with hands stained so bad with blood people could smell the iron if they were close enough. It hit me that Dave is probably dead too, the damn bastard, and I hoped he got something like this.\n\nThe kid put a cup in front of me and to her credit the cup was actually full with tea. Could have faked that part; she was already talking with someone who wasn't actually all there, save the effort. The sight would have made me take a sip were I alive, if only to taste, but I realized I didn't feel any urge to do so. A plus, really. It would be kind of horrible in the long run if I started to feel thirsty or hungry.\n\nNevertheless i tried to grab the cup, to not vail. All in all, everything was okay, I guess.\n\n\"You're so weird, Sir Fluffles\" The girl said \"You look funny with those holes in your belly. and you need a shower, your fur looks dirty again\"\n\nAh, and I was a bunny. A pink bunny, with bullet holes in the stomach.\n\n\"M'lady\" I said, while tipping my fedora \"The tea is very good, but I do not wish to shower. My fur will get dirty anyway\"\n\n\"Nu-uh! You can't say no! All of the members of my court need to be fluky presentable!\"\n\nFluky? Alright. Nonsense, really, but nonsense was what I needed. It was logical that they were going to attack us that night, and yet we were so confident. We didn't have the firepower to deal we them, nor the men, but we thought that since we were \"protected\" by another drug dealer with more name and reputation than most we didn't have to be worried about such things. We were going to be just fine. Nobody would dare touch us.\n\nAnd I die all the same. They made me beg and I begged, and even in that moment it was obvious they were going to shoot me.\n\nShit. They probably shot Dave. Dave was my friend.\n\n\"Fuck\"\n\n\"Fuck?\" The kid said, alarming me. I soon came back to my senses, to where I was.\n\n\"No, I mean- FLUK. Yes, fluk. thats what I said\"\n\n\"No\" She responded \" You said fuck. Fuck's a bad word\"\n\nI grimaced \"It is\"\n\n\"Don't be saying that again, Sir Fluffes. I won't tolerated more bad words in my court\"\n\nI looked at her for a moment. She wasn't older than six, maybe seven if I pushed it. A smiled a little, trying to look admonished and failing to do so \"alright\"\n\nShe smiled and then proceded to talk to the other animals, more real than me.\n\nThis was nonsense. My very existence was nonsense. I think even before I die it was, for I was a man who feared god and yet everything a did in life was bad. This, on the other hand was good. Still nonsense, but nonsense was what I needed. A little quiet for a little while.\n\n\"Whats your name, kid?\"\n\nShe turned at me, appearing a little weirded out. I guessed her imaginary friends don't tend to speak out of turn.\n\nBut still, she answered, curious \"Lilly\"",

            "comment": "When I woke up, mommy and daddy weren\u2019t home. I looked for them, but I couldn\u2019t find them anywhere. \u201cMommy said she was going to the store today, maybe she\u2019s already there.\u201d I thought. Before getting dressed or combing my mess of hair, I pulled on my jacket and walked down the street. There was some yellow ribbon across my door when I opened it with something I couldn\u2019t read, but I just crawled under it. \n\nThe store isn\u2019t far, just at the edge of the street if you climb through the fencing that makes it a dead end for cars but not people. There\u2019s many sticks on the ground from the storm two days ago, but I don\u2019t pick them up this time to make music on the fence. Mommy isn\u2019t here, and she would want to listen. She always tells me how much she loves my songs. \n\nI walk into the store and begin wandering the aisles. A few old people shopping alone, a man holding hands with a girl, but no mommy or daddy. I almost start to cry, until another girl my age runs up and asks what my name is. \n\n\u201cCynthia.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m Rachel.\u201d She replies. \u201cDo you wanna be my friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d \n\nShe leads me back to her parents and drops the box of eggos she was holding into the basket. The man looks really familiar, but I can\u2019t remember from where. Daddy would remember, he knows everyone. \n\n\u201cThis is my new friend!\u201d Rachel tells her mom excitedly. \n\n\u201cOh yeah, what\u2019s her name?\u201d \n\n\u201cCynthia.\u201d Her and I both answer at the same time. Her mom doesn\u2019t look at me at all, but when they leave the store she\u2019s welcome to let me in the car to go home with her. \n\nRachel sets up a tea party in the living room as her dad watches tv in the next room over. My eyes widen when I see her toy box. \u201cCan I wear the tiara?!\u201d\n\n\u201cAww, I wanted to wear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease? I promise I\u2019ll give it back.\u201d \n\nShe thinks for another moment, then hands it over. The tea party was awesome. She had a princess tea set (she said she was the princess but I\u2019m the one wearing the tiara), and other guests like Mr. Cookie, her favorite panda. \n\nJust as she was pouring the cup for Mr. Sky, the owl, I heard the tv say my address. \u201cHey that\u2019s my house!\u201d I jump up from the table and run to the tv, excited to show Rachel. \n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d She complains. \n\n\u201cCome look, that\u2019s my house!\u201d I point to the screen which is showing the front of my house when it\u2019s dark outside. \n\nIt\u2019s one of those shows daddy always watches where they speak in weird serious ways and then he gets angry afterwards, yelling about someone named Trump. They\u2019re not talking about him right now, someone said something about a type of gas poisoning from our car. I\u2019m not sure I remember, but I think that\u2019s bad, especially the way the lady on the screen is talking. \n\nThen she says two names, Janice and Mason. \u201cHey, that\u2019s my parents names.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey, with their five year old daughter, were rushed to the hospital in the morning. All three of them were pronounced dead on arrival.\u201d",

Try to take in my surroundings. I see a blue sky, muddled by smoke. Lead hornets buzzing over head. I look down to see my pristine red uniform leaking into the soil beneath me. A melted candle on many a widow's mantle. I close my eyes for just a moment. The war can wait.. for just.. one.. second..\n\nI awaken in a grand hall. The splendor of which I've never seen! Delicate rose walls reach to a saffron sky, and the seat I find myself in is fit for an emperor. I look to the side to see a vanity mirror the size of my entire body and find that I have aged considerably. My once clean shaven face now adorned with a grey beard that reaches to my chest. My uniform is whole and perfect. A voice breaks my concentration \"more tea captain nuts?\" My face screws up in confusion as I turn toward the voice. A faux regal squeak booms from a young girl across the table. Her smile is genuine and she is flanked at either side by a tiger and an elephant. If this is to be my new queen I would hat to see who would dare go against her.",

            "comment": " \u201cHello, I\u2019m Piella the princess ! Who are you?\u201d\nI literally just woke up, what kind of new hell is this?? I roll open my eyes enough to side-eye her. \u201cDuh fu...\u201d I stop when I\u2019m somehow jerked full awake and forced to see the source of the aggravatingly high pitched voice and exuberant energy. \n          She\u2019s little and kind of cute with her big eyes and button nose. Speaking of little, the chair is little, uncomfortably little. As I shift my weight to try to make this chair more than a torture device, she gets in my face with the innocence of a curious puppy, \u201cwhat\u2019s your name? Doouuufuuu?\u201d \n\u201cNo, no my name is uh Dufulla, I\u2019m a magic fairy witch\u201d \n \u201c Ooh, are you baad?\u201d Her big eyes widen, in horror and glee. \nShe\u2019s a nut.\n\u201c no, no, I\u2019m nice to nice people. But I can make stuff\u201d\n\u201cOoh, Here is your tea...(ssss) Look Pinky, Cookie and GerGer is here\u201d \nShe runs to her little bed where some stuff animals are piled on her pillows.\nAs she squeals and talks to them, I look around this room. \nMy stomach sinks and my heart beats loud and hard like a bass drum in a rock band. The room starts to swirl around. \nThe pink flower wallpaper, the tan carpet, the Barbie house, the faint smells of perfume, dove soap, wood and dust. In a cold sweat I turn look at her again. \nFortunately she is engrossed in talking to her stuffed animals. She\u2019s wearing a dress that is fifty sizes too big. I recognize that dress, it belongs to a tall, lanky woman who loved that green dress with the shimmery tulle. She wore it well and often throughout the year. Piella is also wearing a straw hat that\u2019s only  kept off her eyes by her pig tails. The masculine stiffness and width of the brim emits sweat and cut grass from across the room. It strangely goes together in a fashion far ahead of this time. \n\nThe birthmark on her arm dances as she gesticulates to GerGer. GerGer never wants to play, he always just wants to go outside and climb trees. I always have to tell him that 1. It\u2019s his job to play with me, 2. Tigers don\u2019t climb trees in the forest. They play in the jungle on the ground. 3. He can\u2019t get dirty because if he does he\u2019ll have to go in the whirl machine and he might lose his sparkle whiskers! Silly GerGer, he always forgets.\n\nShe\u2019s defeated and grabs Pinky, Cookie and Lulu. They sit at the table and she pours tea, hobbles to her seat, and takes off her hat. Without the hat shading her face, I see the bump between her brows the stitches on her brow and left side of her face. I flinch thinking of that stupid babysitter, she was always on the phone! I thought I was so smart to use a ladder. GerGer wants to climb in the trees and eat birds. That inevitable fall was hilarious. That would have been a viral video. \n\nShe looks like Mickey Mouse with her pigtails tied around into a knot. \nAfter a dramatic sip, she really is such a nut, she uses the plastic princess plate, like a wand, to introduce us. \u201cPrincess tutu, (pointing at me) this is princess pinky, princess cookie and prince lulu! Prince GerGer doesn\u2019t want tea today. He\u2019s not rude he is just sad \u201d \nI nod and gulp down the tea. It burns my tongue and immediately unsettles my stomach. \u201cWhat kind of tea is this?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s sweet tea without tea\u201d\nI look at her, is she serious, right now? She\u2019s whispering to pinky and sipping with all seriousness.\nShe really is so adorable. \nShe, then, looks at me, smiles and says in a loud whisper. \u201cPinky said that the party has to be quiet. The queen and king get up when the clock says 8 and two zeros. Eight and two zeros, when the clock says eight and two zeros, the party is over. Poof!\u201d She knocks over Cookie\u2019s cup with the poof. I set it right for her. \n\nCookie mouths thank you to me.  Then Cookie slowly proceeds to wipes off the coffee of her lap. Coffee?? I look at each of the stuffed animals\u2019 cups. Lulu has chicken soup, Pinky has wine, and Piella has, I strain to see... \u201c I have the same tea as you, tutu. I drink it normal. Your\u2019s is too hot.\u201d \n\u201c why do they have different drinks though?\u201d\nShe sighs deeply and pouts \u201c I say it over and over again. Every time. They drink their favorite drinks. It\u2019s not my fault. I pour the tea and stuff comes out. They don\u2019t play princess right. Pinky and cookie don\u2019t listen to me! They insist on nasty mommy daddy drinks ! Lulu only likes soup and will not be a princess . And they make me  drink this nasty stuff because my stomach\u2019s angry.\u201d \n\nMy heart starts to throb and my throat feels like it\u2019s choking. She starts to sniffle and winces and sniffles more. I don\u2019t want want her to cry and the salt get in her stitches. \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s ok. This is just our own special princess party ok, I forgot. Please don\u2019t cry princess. You\u2019re a very nice princess hostess.\u201d \nThe others nod their heads and continue sipping. Even GerGer hops off the bed, and wobbles to Piella, and squeezes her hand. \nShe sniffles lighter, and picks up GerGer . \n\u201cWhat\u2019s a ostest?\u201d\nI\u2019m about to answer when Cookie interrupts.\n\u201c a hostess is the girl who has the party idea\u201d \n\u201cOh\u201d \nWe all return to sipping our drinks. \nI remember now, being here before. Vaguely, I feel     a sense of accomplishment. I hadn\u2019t felt that in a long time. I\u2019m thoroughly exhausted and suddenly, want nothing more than out of this room. \n\nJust as suddenly,GerGer jumps off Piella\u2019s lap and runs in a sprint towards the bed, he\u2019s followed by Pinky, Cookie and Lulu. At the same time Piella is  throwing  cups and plates in an open box and snatching the chairs away, including mine. \nI can barely make an oof as I expect to land ass first into a hot and wet mess of hot liquids and alcohol. Surprisingly I\u2019m completely dry as is the carpet that I\u2019m now lying flat on. \nI pull myself together myself as I hear princess Piella in the hallway howling. \nI begin to laugh when I realize that she had tripped on that big ass dress when she ran to her parents\u2019 room. \n\nHer or rather our mom lightly scolds her for taking clothes out the dirty clothes. She also checks our stitches and our bump which now are rawer and more sore. \u201cOh, sweetie pie, why won\u2019t you just stay in bed until we get youup. Your body needs rest. ..\u201d I laugh at her frazzled hair and her half on bonnet, from Piella\u2019s room, of course. I see it so clearly. Then I shudder. I don\u2019t want her to see me, not like this . Like magic I shrink to the size of the stuffed animals. I wish this had happened earlier when I was in that god awful chair. Nevertheless, I run to Piella\u2019s bed and burrow myself into the mass of stuffed animals. I say \u201c excuse me and sorry\u201d but none of them respond. Once safely hidden from sight, I push an eye out to see the alarm clock on the nightstand. It\u2019s 8:15.",

            "comment": "\u201c-ICOS-... Apothicos? What the hell?\u201d The room bore a white and black aesthetic, and posters ranging from pop boy bands to hardcore metal groups supported this look. In the center of the space, which was rather cramped and messy with two beds taking up most of the space and clothes strewn across the floor, was a small, crappy wooden table and chairs set up around it.\n\n\u201cI GOT IT- I- I\u2026 I have no idea what just happened.\u201d In front of the seven men, two of which had been yelling before their arrival, was a little girl and an older boy. The girl appeared to still be quite young, having just escaped the toddler ages. The boy seemed to be on the cusp of puberty. \n\n\u201cWhere are they, Sarah?\u201d Asked the boy, his eyes shifting around the room as he pretended to sip tea.\n\n\u201cOh! Right here, Ricky! All of them! All seven!\u201d She exclaimed, pointing in the direction of the man standing in the center of the group.\n\n\u201cSeven imaginary friends? You\u2019re pretty creative to make seven. What do they look like?\u201d He asked, and as the girl began to roughly describe them to the best of her ability, they were drowned out by rage.\n\n\u201cImagin- Man I wish a bitch would say I\u2019m make-believe. I\u2019m the realest out here.\u201d The man who called out *Apothicos* raised the handgun in his right hand and tried to put a bullet in the little girl. The shot went right through her, and didn\u2019t even leave a mark in the ground.\n\n\u201cLUCIA! Jesus! Calm down! It\u2019s just a kid!\u201d The young man who got it had run to lower the weapon before another could be fired.\n\n\u201cThis is weirder than the time Huxley from down the road thought bull horns were just another pair of udders and tried to milk\u2019em. Ended up eatin\u2019 through a tube after that.\u201d The southern drawl of a young man named Sorian admitted to how strange the situation was.\n\n\u201cAye, Vin. This looks like a-\u201c\n\n\u201c-a tea party. We\u2019re at a tea party. How we got from almost being nuked by a God of Fire to here is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d Observed a pair of young men, Alabaster and Vindel. The former was the tallest of the seven, and had an intricate tattoo across his bruised and cut bare chest. The latter\u2019s body seemed to be covered in white, feather-like fur which had been dirtied and bloodied terribly.\n\n\u201cCambia, I can\u2019t feel any energy. Infernal or Elysian. These children don\u2019t look like any gods I recognize either.\u201d Analyzed Djinn, a young man with skin alternating between healthy and terribly burned.\n\nCambia, the man standing between all of them, had been paying attention to the little girl and the boy after he took account of the room. His smile evidenced that he found them and their setup adorable. He was just as confused as his comrades, but felt less threatened by the sudden change in scenery.\n\n\u201cGuys...Guys!\u201d Cambia shouted over their bewildered conversations to get their attention. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s going on later. For now, let\u2019s see what Sarah has in store for us.\u201d He suggested. Most of the men agreed without complaint, and though Djinn was noticeably impatient, he settled to follow the suggestion as well.\n\n\u201cSo, *Lucy*, you called him?\u201d Asked Ricky.\n\n\u201cYeah! His name is *Lucia*, but *Lucy* is cute.\u201d Sarah confirmed. A few *awh*\u2019s came from some of the guys, and gun-toting gangster simply stood there embarrassed. \n\n\u201cOh, alright. So, Lucy tried...shooting you, just now?\u201d The boy asked.\n\n\u201cYep! Like Call of Duty! Except his gun is not big. He likes swords more. He can do math with it, and change stuff.\u201d She explained with grand gestures to emphasize the power of the sword.\n\n\u201c...I guess mom was right when she said I have to stop playing the game around you.\u201d Ricky reflected, a bit ashamed of himself now.\n\n\u201cYo. How does she know about my shit?\u201d Asked Lucia, suspicious.\n\n\u201cWell...we\u2019re her imaginary friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Asked Cambia. \u201cSo, she knows us inside and out. That\u2019s how she made us! Sarah, that\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He inquired of the girl.\n\n\u201cYeah! Come sit in the chairs! Ionly have two chairs...Mommy said she was going to buy more once she got more money from work, but she also needs to buy food and stuff. Sorry.\u201d The girl admitted, though it didn\u2019t sound like she quite understood what she was saying. Cambia could tell she said this as if reciting it. His glance went to the boy, whose expression darkened from the girl\u2019s explanation.\n\n\u201cWho is he, Sarah?\u201d The leader of the group asked while he and Djinn took seats, and the rest sat on the floor. They took their tea, and while struggling to figure out why sticking out pinkies was a custom they should follow, listened to the discourse.\n\n\u201cOh! This is my brother, Ricky! Ricky is 12 years old. I am six years old.\u201d While she made the introduction, she got up and began to...move air?\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, sis?\u201d Ricky asked, sounding tired of her new imaginary action.\n\n\u201cJust moving their stuff! Vinnie has a pole with a knife. And Cambia has a sword too, and a big bat, and stuff. Allie doesn\u2019t have anything, but his snakes are on the beds\u2026\u201d She went on explaining while the boys were astonished at how she knew their equipment, knew how to handle it, and how courteous she was being to a bunch of dirty guys who just teleported in from a war.\n\nA beep went off, and Ricky pulled a phone out of his pocket. He cursed under his breath. \u201cSarah, I can\u2019t play anymore. Mom\u2019s coming soon and i have to start homework before she gets here and yells at me again.\u201d He got up from his small seat and went towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll keep playing with you later, ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Rick-...y...\u201d He closed the door before she could finish his name. Her vibrancy faded, and now she went about her tea party work with an attitude of solemn duty as opposed to one of excitement. The boys looked at one another, concerned, before one spoke up.\n\n\u201cHey, Sarah, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Apothicos asked, taking Ricky\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cRicky has homework, so he can\u2019t play. He promised he would play, but he has homework. And mom yells really loud and gets mean when he doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d She explained while staring at her teacup.\n\n\u201cSumn tells me dad ain\u2019t in the picture. With how much stress mom\u2019s got that she\u2019s yellin\u2019. I\u2019ve seen this too many times in the hood.\u201d Alabaster suggested among the guys beside him. In the meanwhile, Apothicos took off the black mask he usually wears, and showed his concern.\n\n\u201cOoh, I see. I used to be like that with my mom and my little sister. But, trust me, Ricky\u2019s not trying to be mean. It\u2019s just that things are hard and he gotta do what he gotta do.\u201d He patted her head, and gave her a smile. \u201cBut, aye, you got us. We can be your big bros when Ricky ain\u2019t around.\u201d\n\nSarah\u2019s smile began to grow back. Sorian took the cue and decided to add onto the happiness. \u201cSarah, didja make this tea? Slaps harder than the hoof of Aunt Miley\u2019s stallion!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah! Actually, I got the recipe from Peaches!!! She told me you like it! The Cowboy Special!\u201d She exclaimed.\n\n\u201cPeaches? I\u2019d be damned, she even knows m\u2019future wife! Shoot, I really am her imaginary friend!\u201d He went from sips to gulps now, but the tea never ended.\n\n\u201cOh! Djinn! Djinn! No sugar for you.\u201d She pointed to his cup. Djinn took a sip, winced from the bitterness, but then smiled.\n\n\u201cDang. Bitter with a bite, just how I like- Wait. Only Bella knows how to make it this way for me.\u201d Though usually the most dispassionate of the seven, this certainly put surprise on his face.\n\n\u201cSarah. As you probably know, we\u2019re very busy too\u2026\u201d Cambia began. Upon hearing this, the little girl\u2019s face also began to lose its hype. \u201cBut, while we do our work, we\u2019ll always be here for you, okay? Any time, anywhere you want to play, we\u2019ve got you.\u201d He put his hand on hers briefly. It left a mark on the back. It looked like a heart made of a fox and a snake. \u201cCall on us any time, and we\u2019ll play with you. That\u2019s a promise we won\u2019t ever break.\u201d \n\nSarah was tearing up at this point. She was unsure of why she was crying, and tried to hide it, but Apothicos brought her in for a side hug and kissed her on the top of her head. He wiped his eyes while doing so.\n\n\u201cIt sucks that the hood never changes wherever you go to.\u201d Vindel muttered, a bit downtrodden by his realizations.\n\n\u201cO\u2019course it don\u2019t. But our job is to make it better for the ones livin\u2019 in it.\u201d Sorian replied, patting Vindel on the back. \u201cNow, c\u2019mon. Get some o\u2019 that tea. Bet she made it the way y\u2019mom makes it too.\u201d",

            "comment": "Marionette \n\nEdit- I edited the entire story and sort of the ending and plot line. I think it is better now \n\n\nShe sits there with a small tea cup in hand, an array of cakes and biscuits laid In front of her. She sips from the miniature cup of tea, becoming me to come over. I glance around, the tall wooden walls of the echoing room surrounding me. The walls shine bright in sparkling rose gold. The floor creaks with every touch, unlike the glimmering walls it is dirty and covered in slabs of paint. I step towards\n the small child in curiosity and inspect the small childish seats besides the table. Who is this young little girl? As I begin to ask the question, I ponder. How did I get here? Wasn\u2019t I at home? I shrug off the thought provoking question and sit in the tiny chair, my knees hitting the tables roof. The sweet smell of strawberries fill the air. The silence is broken by her childish spatter. \n\n\u201cHave some tea!\u201d She exclaims, pouring me a cup of seemingly tea, overfilling the cup causing what happened to be  plain water to spill all over my clothes. But  amongst my dismay of the cold liquid, I realise, what am I wearing? I stand up to find myself wearing a large puffy dress, covered in hot pink frills. My hair is curled by my shoulders and i glance to see a pair of glittering ballet shoes, the sparkles  dancing on my feet. I stare at the dress in shock, but I\u2019m subsequently invited back to the tiny tea table by the little girl. I pick up the tea cup curiously, tasting the plain water. It tastes plain, distilled even. In my eagerness, I pick up one of the delectable cupcakes, it\u2019s freshly baked, warm in my hands as the sweet buttercream melts off the perfectly iced top. I take a small bite to find no flavour, as if I was biting into foam.  I shake my head, as if to have been tranced and take another, larger bite. Nothing, as if I expected it to be different, perhaps flavourful with a second bite filled by sweet flavours of vanilla and berries. The girl stares at me as if I hadn\u2019t moved, staring into her eyes with nothing but a cold, heartless glare. \n\u201cCome on! Try the biscuits!\u201d She cried excitedly, in her repetitive childish tone. \nIn desperation, I shove one of the delicately decorated biscuits into my drooling mouth. But alas, nothing. \n\nThe girl stares at me with a befuddled blank stare, only to be stopped by the sound of heavy footsteps. \n\nA woman walks into the glittery room, and scoops the little girl out of the chair. She laughs cheerfully as the tall lady carries her around the room. The girl giggles as she is swung around as if to be flying by the woman. \n\nSuddenly I feel pulled by my arm, roughly dragged out of the tea room. I cry in pain, but I hear nothing. I abruptly learn that I can\u2019t even move my mouth. Have I been at all? Have I been eating at all? Have I been moving at all? These thoughts dash through my panicked mind as I feel myself thrown onto a fluffed carpeted floor. \n\nI see a mirror thrown onto the fluffy floor, my reflection resulting in nothing but a petite wooden doll, a blonde headed marionette clothed in the frilly hot pink dress and a few fake biscuits poking out of a palm-sized handbag. I try to move and in my efforts a small styrofoam cupcake with a large cartoon bite falls out of the pretty in pink bag near my decorated ballerina feet. I Am entranced by the strings that latch from my limbs, moving my legs about as the girl yanks me by my strings. Suddenly I\u2019m hoisted up like the controlled wooden doll I appear to be, and am thrown deep into a dark, cold basket. A black hole filled with stuffed toys, broken parts and lonely dolls. The lid is slammed shut and I feel myself stuck in  a noiseless, endless oblivion, \n\nawaken to yet another tea party.",

And cold, that as well. I was merely there, in the pressing darkness. I had no name, no voice, no memories, I was simply *there*. Until they all came rushing back.\n\nHow long had I been dead for, if I had been truly dead? And if I was dead, then how had I died? Had I at least done what I was destined to? Was my sacrifice worth it? I had heard tales about how the other Heroes were granted a massive Estate in the Sacred Realm, and I sincerely thought I was to wake up there, but it seems The Three and Hylia had other plans. For instead of waking up in the Sacred Realm,   \nI awoke in front of a young girl who seemed delighted to see me. I learned that her name was Sophia, and many, many other things about her and her home life. Strangely enough, the house I was in wasn't \"advanced as everything else\", as Sophia said.  \nShe informed me it was because her family members were the caretakers of a massive estate, and it had been built by another Hero long ago. I, of course, grew suspicious, and asked her when this estate had been built. She informed me that the building that would eventually turn into the estate was built in The 5th Era, 1425, A. H. Which was the year, last I remembered.   \nThe young Rito girl claimed she was only visiting, as her parents and the current owners of this estate were very close. After dwelling on this for a while, I decided to stay, at least to find out what had happened to me.",

            "comment": "My final breath filled the room, and I felt myself float away. I died a happy old woman, with a long life behind me. My children and grandchildren crowded the hospital room, where I lie dead, just hours after my stroke. \n\nI felt the warmth surround me, and the bright light overcome the room, until I could no more see the weary faces of my beloved family.  I was able to replay, in crystal clear recollection of my happiest moments as if they were just happening. My first ice cream soda, my first date with my High-school sweetheart. My wedding and the birth of my daughter and son. I came to peace with all the hurt I had experienced, and forgave my tormentors. I was fully happy, and completely fulfilled. \n\nI was so relieved, and it felt as though a thousand pounds had been lifted from my shoulders. Pure peace is all I could describe it. \n\nThen it happened; the world seemed to regenerate and my senses were brought back to life. I felt alive but not as I had known it before. I wasn\u2019t burdened by my 90 year old ailments, and I felt a rush of innocence sweep over me. I could see, just as I could when I was a child. \n\n\u201cGood morning ladies\u201d\n\nI turned my head to see a child, about six, sitting next to me in a pink tutu, gripping a miniature tea set.  \n\n\u201cHave some tea Amy!\u201d The six year old placed an empty cup in front of where I was sitting. \n\nAcross from me was a stuffed bear, and next to the Bear was a dolly, just like the one I had growing up. \n\nNeedless to say I was confused. I couldn\u2019t move from the chair and my motions seemed to be limited to what the child imagined. Then it hit me.  A wave of memories from when I was a child flooded my brain. Playing with my dolly and Janet, my imaginary friend. \n\n\u201cHow is your tea mister snuggles?\u201d The child asked the stuffed bear, remaining unanswered. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s lovely\u201d \n\nHer giggles filled the room in a way I had not experienced in years. She poured tea, cup after cup, and shared secrets with us about her day. \nThat day went by fast, and so did the others . Sometimes her dad would join in, and would bring some crackers and jam. Other days she would make a tent out of some blankets and pretend to camp. \n\n\u201cLook at the stars!\u201d She would say as she pointed to the top of the sheets. \n\nWe shared fond memories together, but as the years went on, and as Frankie went to school and made real friends my role became obsolete. Sometimes I would feel myself fade-away just as I had when I died, then a flicker of life would come back, as she fell asleep. \n\nI knew my time was up. Frankie was turning 10 tomorrow. I walked over, and gave her a kiss on her forehead, then looked to the sky and said \u201cI\u2019m ready now.\u201d\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll catch a glimpse of Frankie\u2019s room, as she looked at old photographs of her tea parties, or her at home camping trips.  My soul has served its purpose, and will soon be taking the form of another being. I hope it\u2019s Frankie\u2019s new dog.",

I want to tell Alex to get on a train and go north looking for them\" Glen would cry. \n\nI remembered tweeting #RIPGlenChiba when news came in that our national rugby captain had overdosed in a hotel room.\nHe was survived by his pregnant wife and two daughters. We could all feel the guilt he had for the way things had transpired.  \n\n\"I want to answer all their questions, I want to see my boy!\" He said. \n\n\"You don't want to end up like Saul.\" Ruth cautioned. \n\nIn a hospital room not too far from the school was a little boy hooked up to machines all because Saul felt like he still had some unfinished business much like Glen.\n\nI wondered if Saul was there, confined to a hospital room with the only person who could ever see him lost in limbo. It sounded a lot like hell. \n\nEverybody nodded. Nobody wanted to be like Saul and yet everyone wanted to go back home and tie up loose ends or try to somehow pick up where they'd left off. \nWell, everyone except Ruth. \nI had heard that she'd killed herself. \n\nMy husband had shot me and my infant child before shooting himself, the article revealed. \nI had no memory of him ever being violent towards me, but then again my memories were slowly but surely fading. \n\nHe'd survived, but was as confined as I was. \n\nI wondered where my baby was. He couldn't have made for a good imaginary friend at a tender 6 months.\nWhere do dead babies go? \n\n\"It's mommy's birthday tomorrow. How about we ask aunty Agnes to help us bake a cake?\" I said faking excitement while my non existent insides were twisting. \n\nShe put the tablet down and started jumping up and down. \n\"Please, please, please can we make it blue. Mommy really loves blue!\" \nHer smile widened as she rubbed her tiny hands together. \n\n\"Anything you want my little lizard\"",

I don\u2019t remember what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad, will you stop being so melodramatic and come fix my playhouse? My friends are coming over for tea, soon.\u201d",

            "comment": "Jeremy suddenly found himself standing in a backyard. Scattered across the grass under the shade of a large tree were various toys for a young child. A large platform swing hung from a branch of the tree, and on the other side sat a small brown cottage with pink shutters, a blue roof, and yellow flowers painted on the door. A shabby white fence surrounded the yard and disappeared around the sides of a modest 2 story white house. Jeremy stood there looking around, confused as to where he was and why he was there. The last thing he remembered was a bright flash followed by a loud bang, darkness and silence, and then he was here. Before he could call out for help for, a voice drew his attention back towards the house. Standing in doorway was a little girl, red hair in braids, and a big smile on her face. \r\n\r\n\"Mommy!\" she yelled to someone inside the house. \"I'm goin outside! I got a new friend to play with!\" She ran down the handful of steps leading from the door and ran straight towards Jeremy. \r\n\r\nAs he opened his mouth to speak, a young woman with the same red hair came in view in the doorway. A small smile creeped across her own face as she watched the child head for Jeremy. She showed no reaction to seeing a strange man standing in her yard. She slowly turned away and closed the door. Jeremy closed his mouth, stunned that the woman didn't acknowledge him, and he stared at the door waiting for it to reopen.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" Becca squealed at him, causing him to jump as stood inches away from him. She giggled from startling him.\r\n\r\n\"Um, hi. Can you get your mommy for me please? I need some help. I think I'm lost.\" Jeremy spoke with a mix of trepidation and nervousness. He didn't want to scare the girl even though he was filling with a confused fear himself. \r\n\r\nBecca giggled again. \"Mommy can't see you, silly! Let's go have a tea party!\" She grabbed his hand and tried to pull him towards her play cottage, but Jeremy pulled his hand free.\r\n\r\n\"Wait. What do you mean Mommy can't see me? I don't know how I got here or even where here is. I need to speak with an adult.\" He started walking towards the house. \"Nevermind. I'll just knock.\"\r\n\r\nBecca grabbed his hand again trying to pull him back. \"Mommy can't ever see my friends, silly. She calls them my magicary friends.\" She continued to tug on his hand getting frustrated. \"You're here to play with me. Now let's go have a tea party!\"\r\n\r\nJeremy once again jerked his hand free and stormed towards the house. He didn't know what game this little girl was playing, but he needed answers. \r\n\r\nBecca let out a loud screech and yelled at him. \"NO! You are supposed to play with me!\" She balled her hands up in fists and stomped her feet.\r\n\r\nThe door to the house flew open \"Becca?! What's wrong?\" Worry was strong in her voice as the young woman hurried past Jeremy.\r\n\r\n\"Ma'am, I'm lost. Please help...\" Jeremy begged to the woman, but was interrupted by the whining child. \r\n\r\n\"Mommy! He won't play with me! Tell him he has to play with me!\" \r\n\r\nJeremy again tried to speak but Becca's mom talked over him. \"Who, huni? Who won't play with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My new friend!\" Becca pointed to Jeremy. \"He won't have a tea party with me.\" \r\n\r\n\"Ma'am, I can explain.\" \r\n\r\nBecca's mom looked in the direction where the little girl was pointing, then looked back at her without acknowledging Jeremy. The worry relaxed out of her face as she told her daughter \"Well, you tell him that Mommy said he has to play whatever you want.\"\r\n\r\nJeremy's mouth dropped opened. What is going on here? He moved around to be in the woman's line of view, again trying to speak but being interupted.\r\n\r\n\"You tell him mommy! He won't listen to me. He's being a poo-poo head!\"\r\n\r\nThe mother turned towards where Jeremy was previously standing and pretended to scold her invisible friend. \"Now listen here, Mr. Poo-Poo Head!\"\r\n\r\nBecca giggled. \"Mommy, he's not over there anymore. Now he's right here.\" She pointed to the spot next to her where Jeremy was now standing. \r\n\r\n\"Ma'am!\" Jeremy waved his arms. \"I'm right here!\"\r\n\r\nBecca'a mom pointed her finger in his direction and sternly said \"Ok, Mr. Poo-Poo Head. You will play with Becca or you will go in a time out. Do I make myself clear?\"\r\n\r\nJeremy reached out and tried to touch the woman's pointing finger, but his hand went right through it. He dropped his head in defeat, shoulders slumped forward. The realization hits him. The woman can't see or hear him.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks mommy!\" Becca smiled triumphantly at at her mom and then at Jeremy. She grabbed his hand and led him to the cottage. \r\n\r\n\"Have fun sweetie!\" her mom said before heading back into the house.\r\n\n...and so began the endless days of being bossed around by a 6 year old dictator, unable to leave, unable to deny the child. When she complained to her mom about Mr. Poo-Poo Head, Jeremy's new name despite telling her his real one, forces unknown compelled him to obey. He felt like a marionette tied to strings unable to escape the evil witch's cottage. Jeremy concluded that he must be dead, and while he had no memory of before, he must have done something truly awful. Who knew hell was being trapped as the invisible friend to a 6 year old spoiled brat?",

            "comment": "Death can be sudden, like being hit by a train or in my case, being hit by a wave of radiation that instantly melts you like an Hershey bar in a hot car. It Wasn't all that pretty in all honesty, especially seeing my the flesh melt away from my bare hands. I thought it couldn't get worse from there, and while I technically was right, it didn't get worse, It definitely got pretty weird.\n\nImagine what you would think a stereotypical little girls room would look like; pretty pink walls, Barbie dolls, crood crayon drawings, a nice collection of stuffed toys, and of course a little girl to live in it. She was a decently dressed one, had long blonde hair and some of the bluest eyes a person could ever see. She was setting up a nice little tea party for herself and whatever dolls and how ever many stuffed animals she could cram on them seats. Meanwhile, I was absolutely shocked at the strangeness of this situation. One second I was witnessing my own skin melting off and a second later here I am in a room with a little girl and her stuffed animals. She looked at me and smiled and asked \"won't you join us, Mr. Woozy?\" \n\n\"Am I in hell? Is this what hell feels like? Am I just gonna walk over there and all of the sudden this little girl is gonna turn into the devil himself?\" I thought to my self as I shuffled closer to the chair. \"C'mon Mr. Woozy, don't be shy.\" She said. While I was on the verge on having the worlds worst mental breakdown, I took a seat on the small plastic chair and looked looked at her straight in her blue eyes and anxiously asked \"W-where am I?\" \"At my tea party of course!\" She said \"and a bit late in all honestly, but I guess that's what happens when you get your tail all caught up in knots, especially when trying to untangle them alone.\" she said. \n\n\n\"T-tail?\" I asked \"why of course, you're a weasel after all.\" I looked back at what seems to be a long, slim tail. White with multi colored polka dots scattered about. The rest of my body was the same. \"Oh no\" I said. \"What's the matter?\" She replied. \"I-uh feel a b-bit sick, is it ok i-if I can u-use the bathroom?\" I said even more anxious than before? I eventually ran out of the room and saw a man, presumably her father and yelled for his attention, but the thing was that he couldn't hear me, and I guess he couldn't see me either cause he walked straight through me. I never felt so violated in my life. Was I ghost? Can this girl see dead people? Am I gonna make it in a top 10 list of paranormal hauntings by some weird sounding dude?  Then it dawned to me that I was no ghost, I was her imaginary friend. It all made so much sense,the tea party, being an abstract version of an animal, only her being able to see and hear me I Was Hers.\n\nI return to the room and sit down once again. \"Are you feeling ok Mr. Woozy?\"\n\"Why yes I am, now tell me what kind of tea we're having\" I joyfully replied.\n\nFin\n\nP.s I'm sorry if it's a bit weird at parts, especially the punctuation, I'm just writing this at a very late time. Hope you enjoyed!!!\n\nEdit: i fixed up some things, nothing to big.",

            "comment": "The child\u2019s name is Kite. She is not a pink little girl, nor a glitter little girl. Not a soccer little girl, nor a stars little girl. Kite is a rainbow little girl, and in her power she had fashioned you to be the same.\n\nKite tips an empty tea pot over the bulb of your teacup. She makes shushing sounds as the tea pours. No living person can see the tea, except for Kite, and since no one besides Kite can see you either, you can see the tea. It is berry red and steaming.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you say. Your is voice deeper than it had been when you were alive. You love your new voice. It sounds the way you always thought your voice should. In life, your old voice surprised you, so thin compared to what you sounded like in your head, and so forced when you lowered it. Your reflection used to startle you in the same way, a stranger looking back. You died on the sidewalk stories below an apartment without mirrors.\n\nKite sees you the way you always prayed yourself to be, and so you see yourself that way as well.\n\nKite serves you painted cookies made of wood, leaving enough to give to her sock monkeys who have a hard time putting bananas on the table. You can eat the cookies because she can taste them. She can smell how well their cinnamon swirls crisped in her toy oven, so you can too. You thank her once more because you are grateful, and to hear your voice again.\n\nYou are not allowed to follow Kite to school anymore. The two of you chat too often, laughing, echoing stories back and forth just to see how their rhythm would change. Mr. Kite\u2019s Dad sat you both down and explained that it was okay for Kite to have an imaginary friend, but that it wasn\u2019t fair to disrupt the other students\u2019 learning. Now you stay at home all day and chat politics with Kite\u2019s porcelain horses. She can hear them so you can too. \n\nWhen Kite gets home from school, she does her rounds. She greets and listens, and changes the bandages on the piggy bank\u2019s cracks before getting out her tea set. \n\nFour o\u2019clock teatime is sacred. The plushies and the hard-dolls know not to come knocking until you both are caught up on each other\u2019s day. They know that you and Kite will fix everything, together, after four o\u2019clock teatime. This is the best job you\u2019ve ever had.\n\nBy drawing the pain out from your memories, Death has made you childlike. Wisdom without fear. You do not mind. You quite like it.\n\nKite traces the border of her cookie\u2019s frosting with her finger, preoccupied. You start the flow of the conversation.\n\n\u201cQuartz Heart is telling anyone that will listen that Professor Redcliff isn\u2019t who he says he is. She says she saw him without his eye-patch, and he looked exactly like Sweet Valentine did the day he disappeared, but I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d \n\nYou sip your tea. Kite doesn\u2019t sip hers.\n\n\u201cVal would never suggest any of the cruel laws Redcliff has brought to the Council, but I have heard tell of something called a \u2018mind control brain cap\u2019 somewhere in Underbed, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s just a rumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t found Val yet?\u201d Kite asks. She is concerned, but also a little distant.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say, solemnly, \u201cHigh Hopes is still searching from the sky,\u201d you point up to a plastic Pegasus tied to the paddle of the ceiling fan, circling, circling.  Kite looks worried. \n\n\u201cValentine is resourceful,\" you say, \"I wouldn\u2019t lose hope yet.\u201d\n\nKite notes your intel. You are her confidant, her adviser, and her vizier. Together you keep the peace. Kite loves to keep the peace.\n\nThere is more you could say about what happened today. A school day is a lifetime to a playroom. There was famine, fire, and a brief plague of flowers. You will tell her all about it soon. \n\n\u201cDid you have a nice trip to Sophie Sea today?\u201d you ask.\n\nSophia had a rainbow pin on her backpack on her first day in Kite's class. Kite complimented it, and they became inseparable. You are happy to hold down the fort when Kite's on play-dates, especially since she brings home stories of mermaid treasure, mermaid magic, mermaid regicide. Sophie was a mermaid little girl.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be at Drew\u2019s birthday party tonight,\u201d Kite says.\n\nYou nod. You\u2019re going to be attending as well. You and Kite picked out your suit and bow tie yesterday by nightlight. You are excited to met the mermaid queen from all Kite's stories.\n\n\u201cExcept I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a girl.\u201d Kite says.\n\nYou don\u2019t nod. You hold your sip of tea in your mouth.\n\n\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what everyone\u2019s saying.\u201d Kite swirls her cookie in her tea. It doesn\u2019t get soggy.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cI heard she used to be a boy at her old school,\u201d Kite says from behind her finger, \u201cI heard she changed her name, and that her hair\u2019s short because it\u2019s only getting long for the first time, not because she cut it short. Levi said his cousin used to go to school with her and saw it happen. His cousin saw her used to be a boy.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say anything.\n\nKite starts to cry.\n\n\u201cI thought she and I were being friends,\u201d Kite drips, \u201cBest friends. But I can\u2019t be friends with her. Nobody likes her. They won't like me if I\u2019m friends with her. She used to be a boy.\u201d\n\nKite sobs. You scoop her up in your arms. She presses herself against the buttons of your shirt. You hold her, but your mind is elsewhere, sinking, falling. \n\nA tick of time trips by.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you ask, when you feel there again.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kite asks, just as concerned. Her spymaster does not usually go silent when she brings him evidence of deceit, and he absolutely never leaves her to cry alone.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re okay.\n\n\u201cWho won\u2019t like you anymore if you are friends with Sophie?\u201d you start, slowly.\n\nKite scrubs her cheeks, \u201cLevi says no one should be her friend.  Everyone agreed.  Drew is the only other kid who talks to me besides for Sophie, and he says he\u2019ll stop if I keep hanging out with her.\u201d\n\nYou want let Kite know you\u2019re on her side. You'll always be on Kite's side. But when you go to speak, ready to remind Kite that she doesn\u2019t need Sophie if she doesn\u2019t want Sophie, ready to remind Kite she has you, you remember how your voice will sound as you say it.\n\nIt will sound the way you always prayed your voice would sound in life. Deep and warm as a dive in July. Kite sees you the way you always knew yourself to be, and so that is how you are now. \n\n\u201cAnd why shouldn't people be Sophie's friend?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cHow are you allowed to change who you are?  That\u2019s not allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho says?\u201d you ask.\n\nKite thinks.\n\n\u201cEveryone is acting like she broke a rule.  Like she\u2019s a liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think Sophie\u2019s lying? Do you think Sophie\u2019s not really a girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Sophie\u2019s a girl. But she used to be a boy,\u201d Kite presses.\n\n\u201cWhat if she was never a boy?\u201d you ask, gently. \u201cAnd even if she was, you say she\u2019s a girl now. Is she hurting anyone by being a girl?\u201d\n\nKite sniffs, \u201cno.\u201d\n\nSaying that Sophie\u2019s not hurting anyone that makes Kite cry again.\n\nYou are so proud to be Kite\u2019s imaginary friend. Kite is kind. Kite is a leader. You wouldn\u2019t trade Kite for a second chance at life. But, right now, you wonder why you weren\u2019t given to Sophie instead.\n\nYou cradle Kite. You ask her what you wish someone had asked on your behalf long before Kite was born, \u201cDon\u2019t we owe it to a friend to stand with them when the world is against them?\u201d\n\nBy taking away the pain from your memories, Death has made you childlike, but Death did not make you naive.\n\nChildhood is when you don\u2019t know the world is watching. Adolescence is when you try to change yourself to protect yourself against the world. Adulthood is when you start trying to change the world to protect the child you once were.\n\n\u201cThe title of \u2018golden\u2019 is give to the wrong rule,\u201d you whisper to Kite, \u201cThe golden rule should be \u2018Accept others how you\u2019d want to be accepted,\u2019 because if you do that, treating them how you\u2019d want to be treated will follow.\u201d\n\nKite looks up at you, understanding what she must do. Mr. Kite\u2019s Dad calls up the stairs that it is time to go to Drew\u2019s party at the park. Kite takes your hand. She sees you as being in your party outfit, so you see it too.\n\nAt the corner of a picnic table, alone, you see Kite\u2019s best friend. Sophie is a mermaid little girl. She wears a sea green headband over her growing hair, and a purple shell around her neck.\n\nThere are dogs and first fireflies. The grill smokes, the hotdogs snap, the cake melts under a shade-tree. The kids are cluster off and on like clouds, some alone, some together, groups flowing between each other, but never staying as one.\n\nKite runs up to Sophie and hugs her for a long time. Together, they are two. Sophie follows as Kite does rounds through the party. Kite invites a boy who was sitting alone to walk beside them. The three become five as they wave a pair of little sisters into their group.  Kite brings over Drew to make six.  Drew brings over Neveah and Jonah, and, before long, they have all made a game out of whose love can be given with the least conditions.\n\nLevi doesn\u2019t join, but he does take notice that Sophie is part of a larger group than he is.\n\nSomeday Kite will outgrow you.  It will happen around the time when the price of being herself grows higher than the price of not being herself.  She will sacrifice her happiness to her happiness in hopes of being happy. \n\nYou pray that the price of being kind to others never charges more than she can pay.  You pray for her that someday the price of not being herself will grow higher than the price of being herself, just not in the way it did for you. Let Kite shatter outward, not inward. You died on the sidewalk stories below an apartment without mirrors and one open window. Let Kite fly.\n\nThe children run circles. The dogs do too. The moths circle the streetlamps\u2019 halo, and because Kite is joyful, and brave, and hopeful, and loving, you are too.",

            "comment": "I woke up too find myself facing a cute little girl playing with a tea set.\n\nI looked around confused,I had just been crossing an intersection and then...then it got hazy.\n\nI tried too recall and suddenly remembered a speeding car passing a red light.I remembered the pain as a pool of blood gathered on the asphalt.\n\nSo what am I doing here?\n\nI looked at my surrounding and found myself in a pastel pink room.I was sitting at a table facing a girl playing with a tea set.\n\nI was dressed in a complete suit with a top hat,cane,the full 9 yards.\n\n\u201cMr Charles would you like some tea?\u201d\n\nI jumped as I realized the girl was talking too me while flashing a big toothy smile.\n\nI stumbled too utter a response,\n\n\u201cAh yes of course and who might you be?\u201d\n\nThe little girl giggled,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Samantha, Nice too meet you Mr.Fred told me that someone else would be joining me for tea today!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh in that case I\u2019ll have some tea\u201d\n\nI smiled while I pieced together my situation and could only think that I must be an imaginary friend of some sort.To think that everybody had it wrong,that religion wasn\u2019t real but the imaginary friends some had as kids were.\n\nI laughed at the irony before I continued too play my part.Soon,Tea time ended and Samantha told me with a smile that she had too go too sleep so she could grow big and strong.\n\nI smiled and said goodbye.\n\nThen I realized that I had no idea what too do but I remembered her mentioning a Fred so I figured I would stay till he showed up.\n\nAnd so I sat through the night pondering all sorts of things while getting used too my situation.\n\nI sat in my tea chair before being awoken from my stupor by a creeping sound,Samantha\u2019s closet began too slowly creep open.\n\nI looked over and saw a bloodshot eye staring at Samantha.The hair stood up on my neck as a 10 foot tall monster of darkness with two bloodshot beady eyes creeped out of the closet.\n\nIt had an unnaturally long neck that bent at weird painful looking angles as it moved at surprisingly fast speed towards the sleeping Samantha.I left too my feet and grabbed the only object I could find,my cane and jumped at the \u201cthing\u201d.\n\nI was rushed and couldn\u2019t process the situation well but figured I was already dead so I might risk my self for this cute little girl.\n\nI intercepted the monster with my cane and smacked it  on it\u2019s terrifying neck.The tip of my cane fell of in the impact revealing a shining blade.The monster stopped too look at me before smiling,showing off horrifying needle like teeth.\n\nIt leapt at me and all I could see were it\u2019s bloodshot eyes as he pounced on me.\n\n-Thanks for reading just thought this would be fun :)",

How dare I crash her tea party and not be an exquisite guest!\n\nThe little girl began to cry loudly.\n\nSuddenly there where rumbles of thunder from outside the room.\n\nMy uncomfort would not subside, a feeling in my gut that began to move to my head. In fact it began to grow. Like a rumbling in the tummy when hungry, but with spasms and pain.\n\nThe girl's crying grew exponentially to wailing. She had disinvited me - asked me to leave.\n\nI felt lost. How did I get here, where was I to go?\n\nThen, a blinding flash. Like a thermonuclear blast. Except there was no heat, no sound.\n\nEverything went black. The blackest dark of the vacuum of outer space. And now it was cold. Cold as the hand of death himself.\n\nThen it was all red. The red of hellfire! I had pissed off the gods indeed, and was in Hell!\n\nYes, I have now been transported instead to the Republican Tea Party!",

            "comment": "I wish I hadn't run that mile for PE. The extreme fatigue wasn't even the worst part. As I got done, and began walking to the drinking fountain, I took too big of a breath, and began to choke on my own saliva. I guess it had a lot of mucas, because no amount of coughing or swallowing could fix it. I tried to talk, but I was out of air. I began to panic, so I went to the fountain and attempted to drink water, but that only made it worse, and caused more fluids forcing their way down my lungs, if everyone around me cared to look out of the palms for two seconds, maybe I could get out of this.\n\nBefore long, I passed out, I guess nobody cares to see if I were okay, and that's why I am here telling you this. Make sure not to choke on your tea okay? I'll try, she replied. She grabbed my hand, and led me into her room, with her dad sitting on one of the six chairs around the table, 3 of which, were occupied by some of her stuffed animals. Leaving two empty for me and my new friend. \n\nHer father looked detached, like he either didn't want to be here, or he was preoccupied with something else. After we sat down, she poured all of us a cup of invisible tea (really addictive). After about 10 minutes of conversing, and learning the proper edicate for drinking tea, the dad began to look at his phone. At first, it was a glance, or two, then, a peek, interrupting conversation, followed by a few actions, taking no longer than a second. Eventually, he stopped playing, and just sat on his phone, ignoring us. \n\nEach glance at the phone infuriated me, but now, he would rather spend time on his phone, than with his own daughter?! I couldn't take it. She and I had planned for this. \"Ready to wrestle with Daddy?\" I asked her. Eagerly, she knoded. I pointed at the knife, she grabbed it, and jumped onto the table. \n\nI watched proudly as she leaped onto him, stabbing him in the chest and face. He must have been caught extremely off guard, not knowing how to react, she stabbed until he lay there. Motionless. She must have thought that her dad was playing dead, and that the knife was fake. I pointed at the chest in the corner of her room. She moved it, revealing a large space, that soon was taken up by her father. I pitied her. Her \"father\" is awful.\n\nAfter she washed up, I told her to tell her mom that \"father\" had left on a surprise business trip, and didn't have time to say goodbye. \n\nWeeks later, the mom had stopped being worried, and assumed her husband had left her for another women. As her mom kissed her goodnight, almost vomiting from the stench. She began to bolt to the door to avoid throwing up, when she noticed the dog, who stopped being allowed in her room since it would claw up the carpet around the chest. \n\nThe mom decided to see what the dog was up to, and after looking in, around, the chest in every way possible, she decided to move it, revealing the source to the stench.\n\nHer mom grabbed her arm, forcing her outside into the car I made sure that she grabbed the knife on the way out. While inside the car, I told her my plan. \n\nNot too long into the drive, the mom pulled out her phone. That made me experience an anger unlike any I've felt before. I told her to do it now. \"What about the plan?\" She asked. I told her it's too late for that now, and to do it now! She stood up on the floor of the car, and put her mom in a headlock, and before she could do anything she stabbed her in the chest. She hesitated for a second stab, but I knoded, and she stabbed her again and again until she lay static. \n\nSoon after, the car lost control and went into the on coming lane of traffic colliding head on with a semi.",

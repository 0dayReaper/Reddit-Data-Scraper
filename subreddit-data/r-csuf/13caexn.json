I started hearing someone yelling louder than \u201cthe Preacher\u201d and lo and behold there\u2019s a knight in shining armor wearing a blue flannel shirt with a skateboard ripping the man a new asshole.\n\n\u201cThe Preacher\u201d looked stunned in silence as our hero walked off into the sunset, but quickly resumed his rant, except louder. I got tired of it and called our lovely UPD and they showed up in a timely manner and have been patrolling around since\ud83e\udd70",

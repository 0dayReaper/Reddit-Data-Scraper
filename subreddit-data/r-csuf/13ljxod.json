I\u2019m in the sciences looking into entry level laboratory work and got my first job offer at ~43,000/year. Idk if its normal to start off this low or not, but obviously I\u2019m still looking for better offers.\n\nI wanna know (if you don\u2019t mind sharing) what major were you, the position you\u2019re in, and your salary. :)",

If you want to wear a suit and have the glamorous name attached to you then go for the big boys like jp, gs, ms, ubs and the likes. If you like the possibility of cashing in the next 5-10 years on the next IPO wave then go Fintech, a lot of VC funds early stage start ups like Quid in Santa Monica will give you a large chunk of equity. Be prepared to learn everything and break things. If you want a CX facing job in finance go fidelity or TD. Obviously everyone wants a hedge fund, BB or IB job but the truth is that the cards are stacked against us for those jobs since we went to a state school.  Use the chip on your shoulder and go the scrappy route. I am playing the  fintech route, trying to climb the ladder maybe 3-4 ahead of me before c-suite. My plan is two get 2 more promotions in the next 3-5 years get to a good title and then jump into a young start up that will hopefully be a unicorn and retire young.",

I work at a company that has its HQ in Japan, so I have to keep things in mind when communicating certain topics and presenting ideas.\n\ngoing straight in-house is okay if you network or really ace your interviews. personally, I recommend doing agency internships before making the jump in-house so you have a good sense of how comms/marketing works in a client-to-agency context. my route was 2 years of jumping between internships into an FT role before landing my current role in-house.",

The work is likely behind a desk, and you'll likely have to deal with the corporate environment (e.g. chain of command, deadlines, working to appease the investor). This likely not a very exciting job, but it does ensure you will have a middle-class lifestyle ...whatever that means in California. Examples of industries might be biomedical, petroleum, utilities, and construction (most of these are looking for environmental impacts experts which you could learn to do)\n\nOn the other hand, if you are looking for a more interesting job, in a lab, out in the field, etc. These will not pay as well. But you will have a pretty fulfilling lifestyle doing what you like. I'm sure after some time in these positions, you will be able to make a decent wage, but if you're chasing money, this might not be it.",

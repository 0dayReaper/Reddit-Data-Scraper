    "postText": "So I was driving down and I wasn\u2019t sure if there was a car backing up. But I should have the right of way since \u2018flow of traffic\u2019 I drove as usual. But when at the light by Nutwood. I saw the guy behind taking a picture of my license plate. I think it was a gray Honda sedan? Not sure. But I am the Toyota CHR. But I do see a scratch on the front side of my car. So I am not sure if he is here but. I like to figure this out and trade insurance. :) trying to figure out if it did happen or me being dumb and had scratch prior in an accident while back.",

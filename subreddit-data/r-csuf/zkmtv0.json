Because I\u2019ve tried on multiple occasions whether it be dealing with an unethical professor or having to beg for accommodations with a now deceased immunocompromised father who was fighting stage 4 cancer. No one gets that the dean at csuf rarely does shit to fix this god awful department. I feel like I\u2019m writing to heartless people who use automated messages to respond to personal things I\u2019m dealing with so yeah I\u2019ve tried it but I\u2019m making this post bc contacting the dean has never done anything useful for me or other students.",

It says on the schools website literally that if you have Covid DO NOT SHOW UP or Covid symptoms. You professor legally has to make reasonable accommodations for you to get the points. I would suggest you find the schools website information on this (the Covid policy page) and show her where it says this along with the cdc guild-lines and try to reason with her before going to the dean.",

Upon me saying that this has nothing to do with grading, he said that \"Since COVID began, some people take it seriously, others do not\", and then continued to insist he would try to resolve the matter, with no action being taken. I had to alert my whole class about this, a mini revolution took place, and we all had to spam the entire department just to plead our case. 99% of us received canned responses, many of them just being clear cut and pastes or talking about completely irrelevant matters.

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a transfer student who wants to major in the BFA of Entertainment Art/Animation Concentration in Fall 2023.\n\nFor context: I got admitted into both CSUF and CSULA, but I'm still having trouble deciding which one I should choose. I couldn't go to the in-person event that CSUF had earlier in the month because I went to a preview day from CSULA since they had no virtual tour. I thought the Animation program for CSULA was decent based on first impressions, but I kept hearing from others that I shouldn't go there. \n\nI was hoping that maybe the virtual events that CSUF had last week would help me learn more about the art college and the major I want, but I didn't seem to see any mention of it on the schedule. Maybe it was under another name and I didn't know about it. Because of that, I'm still confused about the animation program for CSUF and what it's like. \n\nI do know that there is a portfolio requirement and that you only get two chances, but is it true that you dedicate one semester to building your portfolio? If I do get the chance to get into the program, are there any specific classes or professors I should look out for or avoid/ones I should take a class with? What did you guys do if you didn't get into the program at all? Did you just choose another major or attend another university? \n\nI would ask more about clubs and internships, but my main priority is the environment of it all. I also want to know if there are any pre-recorded presentations about the Animation program or at least a website they have.\n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read this and have a great day! :D",

I will say the program here is a bit messy as of late (lots of staff changes etc) but still a worthwhile place to go if you have the drive and know what you want to get out of it. I'm not sure how we stack against CSUFLA, but I will say I haven't heard of their program like I've heard of other CSUs. \n\nAs for the portfolio, it's competitive but not impossible. You aren't required to apply right when you transfer so you can take a semester or two if needed. Our clubs here are amazing and most of them have portfolios you can look at. \n\nThis school doesn't do a great job of informing students in our major, so you can DM me if needed. Good luck!!",

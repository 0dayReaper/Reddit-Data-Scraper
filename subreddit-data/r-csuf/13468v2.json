With which professor would I have a better chance of passing? Given that having more homework usually helps me, and I also plan to put in time and effort by going to tutoring and SI sessions.",

            "comment": "I had Encarnacion. I assume her name is Mayra? She is nice and sweet but isn\u2019t the best teacher. She is old school so as long as you participate in class and go to her office hours, you\u2019ll be on her good side and she may consider passing you if you show you are trying your best and you are the hardest student. I honestly recommend go to SI. Hoffman isn\u2019t the best teacher, but like @xcinnerx said, he tends to be more lenient toward the end of the semester. Regardless go to SI and get tutoring to better your chances since you will major in accounting.\nI\u2019m an accounting major as well so if I were you I would try to find a CC that will still make you study hard, but the teachers is better at teaching than the teachers you\u2019ve mention above and I recommend taking 201b with Chen over the summer. Way better than Hoffman. Hope this helps and please let me know if you need insight what professors to take for your required business classes and/or GE",

For ISDS 361A, it is easy to go to SI since all professor have to teach it according to the departments standards whereas isds 361b is according to the professor. So say if you are taking professor B for 361B but he has no SI instruction but others do, if you go to SI for that different structure it may it be helpful because every instructor has there own direction of teaching it unlike 361A. Hope this helps!",

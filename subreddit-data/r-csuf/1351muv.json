Ali, the owner, is a bit tough to understand because of his accent, but he fixed my car within an hour of calling and even followed me to an Autozone to help pick out a new battery. He told me the diagnostic charge ($65) up front and everything else price-wise was reasonable.",

Prices are fair and John is knowledgeable and so very kind. \n\nBeen using them for 15 years and they\u2019ve never steered me wrong. Once something gets fixed, it\u2019s stayed fixed. Along with regular maintenance on my cars, they have replaced the sway bar, front struts, rear shocks, spark plugs, and driver and passenger axels. All has gone well.",

    "postText": "Hello fellow peeps! I was wondering about what happens to your GPA if you got an F? Does your GPA go down or does it just mean you fail. What about if you repeat the course and pass? Does it replace the F? I am more asking about the science GPA. If you guys can help me understand this please do let me know!",

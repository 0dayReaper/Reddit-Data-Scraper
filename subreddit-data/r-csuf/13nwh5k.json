It\u2019s a bureaucracy, not a school. So much fucking pointless bloat sucking up money, so little support for students in an overcrowded environment. They just see us as dollar signs to feed their salaries. So many people in college park effectively do nothing at all besides justify their own position. \n\nNothing is about learning anymore or true academic achievement, it\u2019s about shuffling people in and out as fast as possible and forcing professors to drop standards so the school doesn\u2019t miss out on money. The CSUs are a joke. And I suspect this is true of many colleges outside of our system too. \n\nRuthless college capitalism as a huge profit maker and society as a whole requiring degrees for any decent non-trade job have worked in tandem to erode universities as institutions of learning. There\u2019s a facade but it fades quickly. It didn\u2019t used to be this way, Reagan began the attack on the education system in the early 70s as governor, it used to be free to attend California universities. \n\nProfessors are not happy at all, that\u2019s a universal I\u2019ve gotten from all of them I\u2019ve talked with. The school doesn\u2019t even hardly fucking hire full time professors anymore, it\u2019s all about exploiting adjuncts.",

There was a racist faculty affairs (Kirsty Fleming and Rick von Kolen) to intimidate, retaliate, and fire faculty/staff who didn't speak english properly, despite doing their job well. They would mock their emails, block attempts to get the CSU to investigate, and even got the president to sign off on them firing people.  Even when the administration was harassing the faculty/staff, they tried to get rid of them (not the administrators). What happened? Both those idiots left within like 2 months of each other when the staff started fighting back. But the damage was done and the president is still there attempting to retaliate and intimidate everyone who was connected to them.\n\nIt might be everywhere, but no where have I seen in any other university or state entity, this level of incompetence and sheer malice.",

At least in private industry, I can go after them or report that. Here in the state, they cite qualified immunity or some other stupid thing and bury you in policies and what not.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, posting here because I got a tip that a lot of CSUF students don\u2019t have dental insurance.\n\nI'm a dental hygiene student in Garden Grove, California and I'm in need of patients that have not had a cleaning in a really long time. Everything is done under the supervision of a dentist and registered dental hygienists. An exam, xrays, and cleanings are all included for a one-time fee of $20 (deep cleanings can range from $200+ at a regular dental office). This $20 fee covers 6 months, so all the appointments you would have with me. I will be doing X-rays and an initial assessment of your teeth and gums at your first appointment to determine what type of cleaning you need. Please keep in mind that there must be multiple appointments to finish a full mouth cleaning. All ages are welcome and insurance is NOT needed. This will help me with my graduation requirements and further my education and experience with patient care. Please feel free to DM me or let me know if you are interested and would like additional information, thank you!\n\nNOTE: this is my last term before I graduate so I\u2019m limited with appointments, if I can\u2019t see you I\u2019ll be glad to refer you to my classmates and the next cohort. Thank you!",

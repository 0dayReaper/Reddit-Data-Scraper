    "postText": "Hello! I and a couple of homies are looking for a 4th roommate for a house we currently have in Orange right by the circle. We live 12 minutes from the CSUF campus and have an amazing setup. Overall we are a chill vibe of a house! Move-in will be in July. We got a beer-dye table in the backyard and a great setup in this house. We are super friendly and open to newcomers. You will be filling a single bedroom as I have the master and the 2 other rooms are filled. We have amazing ac and heating and are looking for a chiller. I'm currently a senior in the Liberal Studies department and my 2 other roommates already graduated. Reach out if this is something in your interest! Also, lots of driveway parking if you have a car and an outlet if you have an electric setup.",

    "postText": "I failed the last lower division class I needed to graduate on time. They\u2019re not offering the course over the summer, and the class in the fall is full. I\u2019ve looked through multiple community colleges nearby and none offer a class that is equivalent to this one. I\u2019ve looked at open university options and nothing still. I was supposed to graduate spring 2024 but what now if I can\u2019t even take this class until then??? I\u2019m probably just gonna drop out because I can\u2019t anymore. Worst part is nobody understands what I\u2019m going through. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who have been providing positive feedback! I really appreciate it all. But to everyone who have been telling me I should\u2019ve studied better or that I should\u2019ve just passed, you do not know my circumstances. I did the best I could with studying even with the constant sleepless nights where I would study until 5am when I had work at 7am the next morning and still managed to not pass the exams. I\u2019ve read the book word for word and even asked multiple classmates what methods they used to study and tried to replicate to no avail. I\u2019ve done everything for this class except be able to attend the SI sessions as the times were weird and I wasn\u2019t able to attend due to my work schedule. I tried looking for a private tutor because the NSMCC tutor was only there for a certain time when I would be in class for another course, but there still wasn\u2019t anyone who would be able to help me. \n\nDon\u2019t assume that just because someone failed that they are lazy.",

It\u2019s hard when you\u2019ve been conditioned to keep digging every semester with the hope that it will be worth it. I can\u2019t tell it if it will be, but I can tell you that there is very much still a future where you can feel fulfilled and accomplished. If I were in your situation the next best thing I would look into is any internships or job opportunities, and even if that tree doesn\u2019t look too pretty, then I would look into any \u2018wildcard\u2019 options, like doing volunteering for something I love, or even just working part time for something I\u2019ve had interest in, like Disney.",

I think they want your ass out of here as much as anybody else and would probably try to find a resolution to your situation. Don't panic though, but definitely go and talk to somebody in your department/major - because they can't fix something that they aren't aware of.",

One day far in the future when you look back, it won't matter  whether it took an extra year or three or whatever. I think you made a very smart decision earlier to take a break to work &amp; save up money before transferring, as you mentioned in one of the replies. \"Pay as you go\" is a very GOOD way to do it and to avoid debt! That method is very much under-utilized by students! We wouldn't have a problem with students being crushed by debt if everyone just did what they could actually afford -- smart! Graduating as debt-free as possible is a wonderful gift to give yourself and a great mindset to have. You could take breaks or go part-time to put less pressure on yourself. Everything will be ok! &lt;3",

Not to mention the bullshit concept of basic administrative processes costing money (like a major change) and the overall lack of care for students by professors and departments that runs all the way up through the administration chain. \n\nAn example of what I\u2019m talking about: \nI was in a serious accident during one of my terms. I provided extensive, EXTENSIVE, medical information, medical tests, police reports, photos of the accident, my injuries etc all with time stamps to show why I could not be present for the exam. I was and still am an excellent student. However, it was one of those BS classes with 2 tests and 1 paper that make up your entire grade. I was told I either take a zero on the exam, and fail the course, or I could take a W in the course. I was ticked that there is no emergency/medical exemption for the exam. Again let me clarify: I wasn\u2019t feigning being sick or some shit, I was physically hospitalized with a head injury. Something I demonstrated through CT scans and multiple doctor\u2019s notes. Both the professor and department head denied my requests for an exemption to allow me to take the exam late. \n\nI then petitioned for a medical withdrawal (as I was physically hospitalized when the exam was being given and I again provided documentation to prove this) and after being denied, I had to PAY for an additional review and was denied again. If my situation didn\u2019t qualify for a medical withdrawal, what in the everliving fuck does? \n\nI took a W and had to spend an ungodly amount of money retaking the course over the summer to prevent the exact situation OP is in as the course was a prerequisite for my next semester. \n\nThis was years ago but being absolutely thrown to shit by my university after I\u2019d been an excellent student, royally sucked.  Not to mention I was having a very hard time recovering from the accident, and not a single person in that chain of people who had power ever said \u201chey this is a case for a reasonable single exception, the world is not made of black and white decision making.\u201d\n\nThis is ONE example of some of the bs that went on during the 4 years I was there. I\u2019m now done with my MA from another university and have never encountered any place even remotely like CSUF policy or campus-culture wise. I have some friends who loved the place but I definitely have plenty of peers who had similar experiences to mine. \n\nMy own brother did not even apply to CSUF after watching everything I went through there and opted for a UC instead. \n\nI genuinely hope your experience is much better.",

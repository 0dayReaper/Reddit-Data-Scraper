Do I need to log in onto fafas with my account and make corrections to it? Or what I'm supposed to do?",

            "comment": "the paper is just a \"random\" (by random, they mean *unusual* or in your case, tax break circumstances such as your mom filing single, probably helping your case with FAFSA) way to confirm that your mom filed single with a signature from her that kinda like, extra verifies it.\n\nidk if it helps to make it make more sense but for me every year, i usually have to do the verification forms because my maternial grandmother lives at home and recieves 100% monetary support from my parents. bc of that, im not just an only child with two parents, my parents have two whole dependents (or did, i file single now). the university is just raising their eyebrows at you and putting you through extra BS for the sake of their own financial interest really",

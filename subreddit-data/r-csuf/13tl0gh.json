If you run your own little side hustle training people and helping them become fit/giving them dieting and exercise advice on top of working at a gym or PT clinic (or whatever your passion through kinesiology is) you could probably take home a nice chunk of change.",

After I got put into a local school district in the IE and was doing all things related to COVID until we transitioned out. All of these were contact based. I am currently a health educator for a non profit in Riverside and am pursuing my masters in public health. All of this fits into my original plan of trying to get into corporate health and wellness from when I was doing undergrad and my internship",

            "comment": "I graduated with a kinesiology degree 2021, most corporate fitness jobs want Masters or higher. But I don\u2019t find it\u2019s worth time or money to go back to school and have loans just to be making 60k max at those companies. Personal training doesn\u2019t seem stable due to your pay being dependent on clients which at that point you have to be an influencer to market. Working for a gym or similar they\u2019re severely underpaying you in comparison to what they\u2019re pocketing. PT school you get into as much debt as a med school student but never make nearly as much unless you open your own practice. Even with a really good network of people in my corner I have not been able to get a solid job offer. I also have my own side business of personal training and work as a dental assistant. Currently looking into other career fields",

    "postText": "Hello! I was thinking of going to this school for Social Work, I\u2019ve been thinking on it for a while. I toured on Sunday, (4/23) and liked the school. The only thing is, the fact that I also am considering CSUDH or CC due to the fact that CSUDH is more closer to me and CC is a lot more cheaper. Furthermore, CC is a more tempting option for me due to me not getting any financial aid other then loans.",

Have to get a grad degree \n2.Have to get internship experience (undergrad / grad) which tend to be unpaid\n3.Have to get 2/3 years worth of experience(it\u2019s based on hours worked in which you get supervised by a licensed SW) before you can even sit for the LCSW exam. \n\nBased on the few factors stated so far, I\u2019d try to save as much money / spend the  least amount of money where you possibly can.\n\nSo: CC \u2014&gt; transfer to a 4 year that provides the most aid and/or scholarship \u2014&gt; and then go to Grad School, where you\u2019ll be spending quiet a bit in $$ in tuition. \n\nDepending on how well you do, you\u2019ll be eligible for several scholarships which may subsidize your tuition &amp; school expenses. \n\n\nsource: gf is a lcsw who got their grad degree @ CSUF",

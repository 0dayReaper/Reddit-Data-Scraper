Is it 3? Also if it is 3, I would be owing around $1k right? \n\nLast question: if I do pay out of pocket and expect financial aid, how will the reimbursement process work? I\u2019m enrolled in the direct deposit thing so would they just deposit that amount into my account? I wouldn\u2019t have to do anything right?...\n\nExcuse me for all of the questions but I figure this situation is new for a lot of us so hopefully others can get their questions answered here too.",

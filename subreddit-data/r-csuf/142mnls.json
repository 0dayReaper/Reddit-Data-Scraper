    "postText": "Hi I recently got accepted to CSUF, however because of one of the classes that I took that weren\u2019t transferable I was short by 2 credits (58 credits) even though I do have initial 60 at my CC. \n\nI have already submitted an appeal in regards to it, but I was wondering if there is any chance for this decision to be reinstated somehow or if there was anything I could do on my part? It\u2019s just very upsetting since I have a lease signed out there and already paid the $250 fee",

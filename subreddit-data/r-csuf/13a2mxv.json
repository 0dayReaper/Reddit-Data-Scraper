    "postText": "So I was reading the other Reddit post here about the origins of why someone got the name of the Nutwood nutter or whatever and realized that the original story was something similar that happened to a friend and I at the beginning of this spring semester. \n\nAfter getting out it the SRC we had to drop her car off at the Firestone the street over from campus. The wait was about an hour so we decided to walk back to Alight. As we were walking back a red car pulls up to the side of us on the side walk and it\u2019s a man in his late 20s-30 with a longer unkempt beard and hair playing with himself fully exposed??! My friend and I are 21 but without makeup we look pretty young &amp; there were younger children and girls walking the same route as us\ud83d\ude2d. We didn\u2019t report it bc we were honestly in shock and thought it was a random person but now I\u2019m wondering if this dude is a repeat offender who\u2019s never been caught lol.",

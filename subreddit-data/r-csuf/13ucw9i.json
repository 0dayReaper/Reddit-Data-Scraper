Nope. Worst case scenario I\u2019ll just pay the ticket and resort to purchasing a daily parking permit.",

I parked in the morning, at night, and sometimes even the whole day. I prefer this to Chapman park because it\u2019s a tiny bit closer, better lit with more security, and there are always spaces. Don\u2019t park at the larger Smart &amp; Final lot though because there are tow signs and you may be towed (I never tried it).",

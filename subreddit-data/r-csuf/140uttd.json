    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm a Business major looking to take MKTG 351 on this Fall semester but confused by its pre- and corequisites. On the catalog from CSUF website, the prerequisite is ECON 202 and corequisites are BUAD 301 &amp; ISDS 361A. However, under the Enrollment Information in Class Search and Enroll, it only shows the BUAD 301 corequisite but nothing else (I've attached screenshots of those).\n\n[What's showed on CSUF's catalog](https://preview.redd.it/pyhvfzt3834b1.png?width=1516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1edeaa8dfa7c81dcce5b9195fc39c13cc8c70a5d)\n\n[What's showed on Enrollment Information in Class Search &amp; Enroll](https://preview.redd.it/k6ecaxu5834b1.png?width=1486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7ba24d7040cde7c87eb66cf3abdae5d244b4401e)\n\nI'm taking ECON 202 and BUAD 301 next semester, so according to the catalog, that would not meet the ECON 202 prerequisite and ISDS 361A corequisite, but I was able to waitlist for the class on the system (not sure if it would stay there on the schedule if I actually got in though).\n\nI remember seeing some comments about students being removed from classes in the middle of semesters when they turned out to not yet meet the pre- and/or corequisites for the classes and would not want it to happen to me. Hence, please let me know if anyone knows the correct pre- and/or corequisites for the course. Thank you so much!",

You can register for classes you're not qualified for, and the college will manually go through to drop unqualified students.",

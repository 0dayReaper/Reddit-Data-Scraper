I'm leaning more toward the info systems route, but from what I'm reading on this sub, it's not as good as the accounting program here. I've also heard that taking the IS route is harder in terms of finding jobs. Thanks for any help!",

This means you will have to do 150 credit hours (150 units) instead of the traditional 120 units. Some students do a masters which fulfills the 150 but some just do more semesters of undergrad. \n\nGPA is incredibly important when it comes to landing jobs with top and mid level firms. 3.0 GPA is the minimum requirement, but most firms like to see 3.3 and above. Unfortunately I have a 2.9 so it\u2019s been very difficult for me to hear back from firms. \n\nNetworking is also very important. There are many events and clubs that you can and should look into such as Accounting Society and Beta Alpha Psi. Each club has their own events, but they also share events such as \u201cMeet The Firms\u201d which happens once every semester and is basically THE event you want to go to if you want to network with top level and mid level accounting firms.  \n\nIf any other accounting majors want to add or make comments about my notes, please feel free. \n\nGood luck, with your education and I hope the best for you OP.",

            "comment": "The switch to Accounting from CS is very drastic in terms of subject matter - I\u2019d look into the major / work involved to see if you\u2019d enjoy the work.\n\nBut I can confidently say Accounting has one of if not the best fleshed out department (there\u2019s still bad apples in terms of instructors / professors) in the business college with Finance in second. \n\nIf you keep your grades up + involve yourself in Accounting Society or BAP, you\u2019ll be in good standing for a job before or right after graduating. That was my experience - had 3 internships plus a job offer a year before graduating due to the amount of recruitment there is for Accounting students. \n\nAs far as ISDS goes, I ultimately graduated with a ISDS concentration (originally an ISDS / Accounting double concentration) I personally felt that the content and curriculum was lackluster. I learned everything on the job via internships / FT positions / self study then in class unfortunately. This was my experience and I\u2019m sure I could have applied myself.\n\nWith that said, I had no issue getting a job with my ISDS degree - the job I had lined up was closer associated with said degree then strictly accounting. Since then, I have had no issue getting jobs either - I would just focus learning hard technical skills (learning software such as alteryx, tableau, salesforce, excel or programming languages) and get some certifications associated with the career path your aiming for upon graduation.\n\nLike others have said ISDS is very broad, so you should have an idea on what you want to do and take the courses correspondent to that goal - as you can \u201cfocus\u201d within the concentration. I personally did the general InfoSys track as it gave me the flexibility on the courses I wanted to take. \n\nHope this helps!",

The way the accounting landscape is become more digitized/ automated, getting exposed to Software / Tech principles thru Info Sys is a good mix and something employers will definitely like (this is based on my previous convos with recruiters for Accounting Firms).\n\nI\u2019d definitely give it a go if your end goal is to be a CPA - it\u2019ll give you an \u201cedge\u201d in the recruitment process for sure.

Teaching shit that is not relevant to the real life. Imagine coding class which most of the stuff was theory. What u gotta do is just to REMEMBER everything textbook says.  I'd rather sign up on udemy or something. \n\nThe next thing is ISDS courses are out of date and does not reflect to our current technology.  No AI/ML classes.. Nothing. Nada.\n\nPlus ISDS doesn't have something like AS like MTF, etc. Yes there is a club, but they just barely revitalized it. There's no chance to network unless like what AS and BAP always does.\n\n I truly regret choosing ISDS here at Fullerton. I should've chose UCB or UCI instead.",

Do you know for sure you want to work on a career in tech or do you want to work in a career in cash flows or managing assets and liabilities? If it\u2019s the first one then major in ISDS and minor in computer science because I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t hurt (if you can afford it and are okay with taking extra classes). If it is money weather that is focusing on cash flows or how to manage assets and liabilities then major in accounting. You\u2019ll learn the cash flows than managing assets or liabilities like finance. The reason why I say major Accounting than finance is because accounting is more transferable than finance. There have been some accounting majors who transferred into a career in finance once they started working, but not vice versus. Regardless of the major. Get a 3.33 GPA or above so you can work for well known companies/firms and you are exposed to internship opportunities. Also, network a lot. Focus on building relationships with your peers. That is the key to get an internship. Not networking with the intent to get an offer. Things take time, so build relationships with recruiters and your peers!",

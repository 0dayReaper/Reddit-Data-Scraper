Women tend to \"hover\" over toilets because they believe you'll get the mythical \"toilet aids\" from sitting on the seat. Many women don't want to press any buttons to flush for the same reason. Some women think the \"automatic sensors\" will take care of the mess they left behind; akin to \"the help\" or \"the custodian\" will do the dirty work for me. That isn't feminism, that's a relic of the old guard. Also, if you associate cleanliness with political movements, then you clearly don't know what feminism means or you have an agenda.\n\nWhat we live in is a very individualist and capitalistic society which knows no bounds of gender or person; it only knows the \"ME\" in all of it. What do *I* get; what am *I* owed; that's not *my* problem; *I* don't have to touch or clean anything, *I'll* have the help do it. (If you hadn't heard, that's a form of privilege.) We don't \"collectively\" think of the others who will use the toilet after us; we only think of our discomfort in the process; and if we as individuals can get away with not doing something, we absolutely will. It's the most American of traits... *passing the buck.*\n\nSince women sit down 100% of the time and men sit approximately 30% of the time (possibly less depending on how you care for your body), men's toilets get less action. I hear horror stories about the urinals though, but generally speaking, men don't care... because once again, \"it's someone *else's* problem.\"\n\nBless the souls that see those devastated toilets and flush for that previous person who left the mess behind. \n\nAt the same time, fuck everyone who leaves the room without washing their hands.\n\nIn other words, miss me with that shit, kid.",

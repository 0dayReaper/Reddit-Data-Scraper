My other buddy made 120K in software engineering in 18 months. We are environmental engineering. It's more humble. We help clean up the earth and feel good about it. Petroleum engineering is another field to explore.  \n\nMost environmental jobs average 60K entry-level so I'd say 85K is competitive for entry into this humble field.\n\nI don't understand why mechanical engineers are still so aggressive...both on and.off campus....",

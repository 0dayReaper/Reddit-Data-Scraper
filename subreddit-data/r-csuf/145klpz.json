There\u2019s also University Village which isn\u2019t that bad either. Also make a Facebook account and check out the CSUF Roommate community page- there\u2019s hella people putting listings on there. \nGood Luck :))",

Alight and UV are most likely full and hard to get into this close to the school year. I found roommates through Facebook groups. Me and my roommate live at an apartment complex about 10 minutes away called Aspect. It\u2019s super nice we love it. We are actually looking for a roommate for next year to share a room. Rent is $838 a month +utilities. If anyone is interested, please dm me through instagram @nataliedirks &lt;3",

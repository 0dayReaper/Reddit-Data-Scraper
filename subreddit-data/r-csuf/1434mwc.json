My second year I had the worst roommate experience was like a nightmare . definitely be confrontational from the start if you don\u2019t like something that\u2019s happening. I had some friends who were indifferent from there roommates were not friends didn\u2019t really talk much and they said it was a fine experience",

We even lived in a apartment together the following year. The key is to be honest in your preference application and setting rules when you first room together so you don\u2019t have to worry about crossing boundaries with one another :)",

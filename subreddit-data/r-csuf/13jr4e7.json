I\u2019m a HUSR minor so also teacher recommendations for HUSR as well :) \n\nSo far I\u2019ve had negative/lackluster experiences w dr mori (sweet prof but god damn abnormal psych should not be that hard and the average grade for exams was around a 60 or lower\u2026.) and James neuse (bitter boomer, exams actually weren\u2019t awful tho but quizzes were confusing\u2026didn\u2019t really get much out of psych 302) \n\nAnd pretty good experiences with prof Shimazu and Prof Royston (human services prof)! \n\nWho do y\u2019all recommend or not recommend?",

Some other departments instructor assignments are subject to change nearly all the way up until the start of the semester. \n\nSome departments do this on purpose to prevent students from piling on to just 1 or 2 teachers. You end up with Dr. Goodteacher who has 200 students and has to find time to mentor and grade for that, and Mr. Badteacher who has 50 students and has a significantly lighter workload. Punishes instructors for doing a good job.",

    "postText": "Okay i know this is sooooo silly and delusional of me but I know double majoring is possible but what if I want to triple major, or possibly 4 bachelor's degree. A bit of background, i am a transfer student and dont mind finishing in 3 or 4 years. I want to get a degree in accounting and business (specifically entertainment) but im also a math nerd and want to major in pure math. I was also looking and The Pure math and teaching math have a few differences so why not add that one as well. I can't find anywhere on their websites about double majoring so does anyone have experience with either double, triple or quad majoring at fullerton and what the process was like? \n*also we are ignoring external factors, on paper is it possible? That's all I need to know and if it's a yes in running with it. \nTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE!!",

I\u2019d do accounting emphasis for business and either teaching or pure math for the math major. Finish your 2 bachelors degrees. Then do one of the following: masters or PhD in math, an MBA, or CPA. These post-baccalaureate programs/degrees will help you more in the long run. \n\nGenerally a bachelor\u2019s degree is meant to show employers/schools that you are capable of dedicating yourself to something for years, shows you are disciplined enough to come to campus enough to pass your classes, and to get pre-requisite knowledge/experience for your field. Multiple bachelor\u2019s degrees aren\u2019t really necessary unless you have a specific goal in mind where those degrees will help you. \n\nTo answer your question. Yes, on paper, it is possible.\n\nBest of luck on your decision.",

You need to get a major declaration form (or something called similar to that, should be on the Records website) approved. Can\u2019t say I necessarily recommend it since it may take away your time for internships/licensure/the like which are more attractive to employers in certain fields.",

From what I know triple majoring is possible, I just had to get it approved by an advisor first. I would talk to the advisors for your current degree program and have them help get you in touch with ones in the programs you want to add. There are a lot of nuances in the system that advisors would know and they might even suggest a different program that aligns more with what you want. I would also suggest reaching out to professors you know well in your current program to get their advice on adding more degrees. Make sure to not overload yourself and push more than you know you can handle. I wish you the best of luck.",

A math and business combo sets you up well for a career in consulting or finance. Around the time I started there was a student who graduated with a triple major who went on to Harvard Law School (I believe all three were humanities majors). Pursue your passions but be cognizant of time commitments &amp; diminishing returns. Best of luck :)",

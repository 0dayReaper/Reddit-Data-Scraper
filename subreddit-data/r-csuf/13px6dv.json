However, if you\u2019ve taken a lot of courses at the other school, they might go to waste because you can only transfer in 9 units because there\u2019s a residency requirement. You have to take 21 units at CSUF. Basically you apply to the program and if you\u2019re accepted, you talk to your advisor to see what classes they can put on your study plan.\n\nNo clue if the same applies to transferring out of CSUF. Depends on what school you\u2019d be going into as each school/department/program may have their own policies.",

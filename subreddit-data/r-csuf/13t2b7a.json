I\u2019m an incoming freshman and have paid my $100 orientation fee, but find my link currently isn\u2019t working, does anyone know if the contact number/ email is currently still active? I attempted several times to call earlier today as well as sent an email however find i was sent to voicemail and am just curious if the office was closed currently or something? Is anyone else having similar issues?",

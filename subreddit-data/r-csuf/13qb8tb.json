    "postText": "A bit of background, I was writing two essays around the same time and the one I started later had an essay prompt that could fit some of the points I made in the first essay I started writing. However I didn't just copy and paste my points, I reworded them but they still sound familiar to one another. I'll be honest, I'm not proud of what I did and I honestly think my brain was on overload with everything I needed to do so the idea of \"self-plagiarism\" didn't even come up. I just thought it was a way for me to kill two birds with one stone.\n\nThe class I'm getting marks with the plagiarism for is actually the first essay I wrote but the only problem is that that essay was submitted after the second essay. I'm currently writing down points of discussion when I do talk to whoever it is I talk to but I was wondering if this could lead to expulsion and if nothing that bad, if it will affect my financial aid.\n\nThis is also my first offense so does anyone know what the repercussions could be?",

I would defend this case by saying both works were being created at the same time. That's why the work couldn't be cited. Nothing was copied or plagiarized. They were being made concurrently.",

Plus, the academic dishonesty code is written rather vaguely and broadly. I actually knew someone who got in trouble for cheating (they didn\u2019t cheat but were aware of it on a discord channel) and got punished for not reporting it. The same could be true for plagarism",

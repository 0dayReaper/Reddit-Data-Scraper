You basically learn about children\u2019s literature while learning to bring books to life through body gestures, facial gestures, voice choices, etc. I honestly dreaded going to that class because of the amount of participation and performances we had to do in front of the class. But I will say I did gain the most skills that I honestly will use in the future in my future classroom.  The professor is awesome, very strict on some rules but she\u2019s fair and sweet.",

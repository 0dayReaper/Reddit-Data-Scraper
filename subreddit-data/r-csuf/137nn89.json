    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI just joined the subreddit, I'm planning on transferring over to Fuller from a school on the east coast, and I had some questions I'd like to ask you guys:\n\n\\-What's student life like? Are there parties throughout the semesters? Not that I'm looking to party all the time, just would like to have the potentiality too.\n\n\\-Have you heard about others in the CompSci program? What are they like? What are the professors like?\n\n\\-How is the dorm situation? Are we talking livable, non-existent, or would I be better off getting an apartment?\n\n\\-Overall what do you think of Fuller?\n\n\\-Food on campus? good or bad?\n\n\\-Things to do outside of Campus?\n\n\\-Career advisement? Good/bad?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other information/advice you'd like to mention is also welcome. Looking forward to joining!",

            "comment": "Dorms are okay. The dining hall is bad but constantly being improved each semester, so if u want access to a kitchen stay in the suites or apartments which have access to a kitchen. Ur gonna have a Roomie in the suites/dorms. Honestly a bit expensive I prefer off campus. Social life is what u choose to make of it, so u can get really into it or just casually chill. Mostly a commuter school we don\u2019t have a lot of parties. Campus is close to Disney land, and multiple beaches if u have a car. Food on campus is good Ig: Panda Express, pieology, Jamba Juice, Baja Fresh, decent food court. Within. A block of campus there\u2019s the habit and 85 C among other stuff. I think Fullerton is good overall. Cheap, and it\u2019s in a p cool area of SoCal. Comp sci professors are hit or miss but so far my experience has been p okay. Message me if u have more questions",

            "comment": "Student Life is ok. There\u2019s stuff to do but you have to actively search for it, as this is largely a commuter campus. \n\nI\u2019m in CS, most of it is Okay. The administration and College (compsci) itself is very disoriented at times and jarring. Some professors are amazing and really have made me like CS, others have been pretty bad to the point where I was even considering changing my major. \n\nI\u2019ve only been to my friends\u2019 dorms but they seem pretty no-thrills standard. Mostly grouped by sex &amp; major, altho apparently there are co-ed floors. \n\nFood here, there\u2019s actually a decent selection of options, and outside vendors will show up every Thursday and sometimes Wednesday and Friday. \n\nPlenty of things to do outside of campus, the location itself is definitely a strong-suit and you can go to Disneyland, Orange, the beach, Irvine Amphitheater, Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, etc pretty easily since the freeway is right next to campus and it\u2019s center-OC. Plenty of things to go to of all budgets. \n\nCareer advisement is kinda lackluster, there are resources that the College (cs) will give you and send you emails about, but thats it. There\u2019s not a lot of handholding and its really ultimately up to you to seek it out. Occasionally a large companies\u2019 outreach team will visit and talk about their experience, but that does not mean they\u2019re handing out jobs or internships.",

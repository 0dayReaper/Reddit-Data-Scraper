    "postText": "I\u2019m a community college transfer and my takeaway from my first 2 semesters are that professors at this school couldn\u2019t give 2 shits about you. No matter how much work you put in they won\u2019t give you the benefit of the doubt with grading. It feels like no professors have your back or care if you succeed in life. Like they\u2019re just here to collect a paycheck. Not only that the math program is awful. I failed business calculus because the professor selection and class structure is really bad and brought my GPA down a lot because I failed it twice and therefore I am going to stay an extra semester at this school.",

In all the semester I went here, only 3 professor actually makes me interested into the subject because you can see their passion. Hope you better luck on finding those good professor or you might need to transfer for a school that fits you better!",

Some profs really like what they do, some do it for the money. That\u2019s just college. The university system is set up to make money, not make us happy. Get over it, transfer, or drop. Or bitch about it to your friends. But it\u2019s really not a CSUF problem it\u2019s just an everywhere problem.",

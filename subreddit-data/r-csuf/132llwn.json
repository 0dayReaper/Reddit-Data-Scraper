Also there\u2019s a church parking lot around there i think. Maybe try those places, but please reach out to the school and see what they can do for you. My heart breaks for you man. I hope you find a place soon.\n\nEdit: Dorothy Ln. also has some dead end streets where there is usually a lot of parking available.",

Also although tuffy's basic needs isnt giving temp emergency housing rn you can apply for an emergency grant to help you through a crisis or tough time! They respond fast I've had experience with them, its just a little money to help u get off ur feet.

Also if you dial 211 its a basic needs hotline, they can direct you to any resources you may need, and if you wanna save money on food to use for housing I suggest applying for cal fresh and picking up the card at your county office!

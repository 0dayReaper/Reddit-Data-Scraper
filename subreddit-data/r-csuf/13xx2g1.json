I plan to major in Business Admin, interested in management, HR, or anything in that field.\n\nFor the business program, I heard CPP is better, but I've also heard CSUF is better. So now, it's down to which one has the better vibes lol. Also, the housing situation and people. I can't do on campus housing because I have a cat, so I plan on either commuting (preferably not) or moving out and dorming with people.\n\nSO! Thoughts on CSUF?",

I recently graduated with Accounting and IS degree, and I would say that the school has a ton of resources for you to succeed, but it is a commuter school so you might find yourself without a new social circle if you don't join some sort of club. The only thing I would complaint about this school is the cost of the parking permit, it is absurd...",

Just make sure to prioritize school work, if you can apply to jobs when you can to be an student worker. If you do just know you\u2019ll have to apply like 60jobs then eventually one of the student jobs will reply. Talk and connect with your professors they\u2019re all pretty cool but you gotta make it your priority to bond with them a little. But yeah if you have specific questions ask away, but other than parking, I love csuf",

Students here aren't really interested in making friends (which kind of blows tbh), professors are hit/miss (though ME department has some pretty good professors), and the library is super nice with usually good seating availability. The campus is nice, but the buildings are honestly not the best-looking. Though, the Business buildings are the newest on campus, AND, has its own starbucks and study space. I really think you'll do just fine for Business at csuf. From what I hear, csuf is better than cpp for business.",

I've been here for a few semesters and haven't really made friends.\n\nThe Titan Student Union is pretty nice. One of the nicer buildings. Be sure to check out all the resources that are available to you and use them.. best of luck!",

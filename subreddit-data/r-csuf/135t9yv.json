    "postText": "Hi! Do you guys know if I can apply for CSUF\u2019s Research Career Preparatory (RCP) Program? I am a sophomore right now at CC and will transfer next semester. I looked at their website but see no info if I am eligible to apply right now, unfortunately.\n\nEdit: If anyone\u2019s on the same boat as I am, I sent an email to Dr. Arce (program head), and she said we can apply! She sent me a list of the courses that she recommended taking before applying though.",

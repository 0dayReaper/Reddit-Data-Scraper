            "comment": "The enrollment deposit is just part of your registration fees. If you pay 250 dollars, your classes will be 250 dollars less the first semester. CSUF probably only has the enrollment fee to prevent students from accepting admissions without a firm commitment.\n\nEdit to add: I recommend deferring your fees if you're still not 100 percent sure if you're going to attend. The enrollment fee is non refundable",

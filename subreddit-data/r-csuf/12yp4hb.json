    "postText": "Hi! Recently, ASI has launched the Student Wellness Initiative. On Tuesday, April 18th, the ASI Board of Directors passed a resolution in support of the ASI Wellness Initiative, expressing support to implement the program starting in Fall 2024, authorizing gradually increased ASI TSC fees from $155.99 per semester to $596 by Fall 2027 in exchange for the expansion of the TSU &amp; SRC, construction of Wellness Center, and centralized basic needs space, increased funding to ASI programs and services, etc. Let us know your thoughts on this plan by filling out this short form below.\n\nhttps://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bI4TsoVfyB9cCO2",

That $500 spent could\u2019ve been used for more water availability at spring concert, or even just to the pantry! \n\nCollege isn\u2019t for arts and crafts. This is some K-12 kinda filler. \n\nHave they ever reported how many UNIQUE STUDENTS actually attend these events versus how much money is spent? I\u2019d be interested to see the cost per person. Especially since 40,000 students all contribute to this fee.\n\n\nAlso why are they creating a wellness center? We already have a Health and WELLNESS center which actually needs more money to help provide more counselors and this fee won\u2019t contribute to that. \ud83e\udd2c",

(include the student workers being paid to support the events like the TSU staff, and professional staff we pay who have to process the paperwork that goes into these, and sit in the multiple meetings that they probably had to plan this\u2026. Waste of time and money)\n\nNot to mention it takes away rooms that could be used for other clubs or students who need to study. Which I bet more people would be in favor of than Yarn Turtles\u2026\n\nASI Student leaders and staff are supposed to be responsible stewards with state funds/ AKA student money. \n\nThis is an abuse of trust we put in them to make sure money is spent in a way that benefits ALL students not just the few.",

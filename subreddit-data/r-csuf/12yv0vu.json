Iirc the homeworks he assigned us were basically note-taking to his lecture videos and mcgrawhill assignments for each chapter that would be due together on the exam date. His lectures usually go over the math portion of the class and do the in class exercises. For conceptual information, he posts the videos on canvas and you have to watch it on your own time and take notes\n\nOther than that, I don't think he assigned us projects if I remember and his tests are fine if you attend class everyday and understand the math. The math portion of the exam was very similar to the in class exercises but it would be different numbers. Good luck!",

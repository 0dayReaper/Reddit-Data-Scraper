Also, what questions will be asked during the interview and how can I prepare for it? Any responses would be greatly appreciated!",

They\u2019ll ask basic questions about work experience, nothing crazy. You don\u2019t need any IT background to get the job! It\u2019s a lot of customer service so what they\u2019re looking for is someone who is able to problem solve, detail oriented, and open to learning! Good luck :)",

Questions like navigating Windows and Mac OS, connecting to wifi, and some questions about Office file extensions (.docx, .xlsx, etc.). Then they ask you about your experience, customer service is important to have. \n\nThis was like four years ago, but I hope it helps!",

I know people got places to be, but come on, we just worked 4 years for this and people don\u2019t want to wait 30 more minutes for the ceremony to end. \n\nJust after hearing about how CSUF was transformed to \u201cmore than a transactional event\u201d, yet almost everyone left  immediately after getting their name called. I ended up leaving too once I realized 80% of my peers were gone, no chance to throw up your cap, no moving the tassel to the left, even if you don\u2019t care I just think it\u2019s disrespectful to those who get called after you. Like damn I know CSUF isn\u2019t known for school pride but that was a sad way to end it.",

            "comment": "It is an unpopular opinion but graduation ceremonies do need some decorum. As a guest and someone who organized ceremonies before, I did see the ushers trying to have students sit back down but you can\u2019t force anyone and certainly not tackle students into obeying lol\u2026. There was an attempt. But it did look really bad from up top to basically have a sea of students walking off the field after their name was called. \n\nI think there\u2019s a lot to consider tho as well:\n\n1.). CSUF has a lot of first -gen students that are going through this for the first time and I don\u2019t know if the college communicated expectations for the ceremony ( or if it was done very well)\n\n2) even if the college sent it we don\u2019t know if students took the time or had the time to read it. There\u2019s a lot of e-mail that goes out. \n\n3). CSUF is still a commuter campus so there\u2019s an engagement issue when commuter students don\u2019t make the time or have time to connect with the campus because of family/ work/ or other competing obligations. \n\n4) there\u2019s some interesting dynamics with the administration of the school where you have changes in the senior leadership and recently this:  \n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-21/csu-didnt-investigate-claims-that-a-president-inappropriately-touched-students#:~:text=The%20Cal%20State%20Fullerton%20campus,President%20Framroze%20\u201cFram\u201d%20Virjee.\n\nThese things don\u2019t help with having pride in your school, unfortunately. \n\n\nThe full picture considered, each student will make individual choice for there situation when it comes to staying or going and my take on life also is that there are a lot of rules that are made up by people and carry a tradition, but it doesn\u2019t always meet the needs of more recent generations.",

I do hope everyone would have an amazing college experience and that they feel connected to the school they chose since you are choosing to pay your tuition dollars there. But, I also know that it can be a complicated experience that requires the student to do their part and the university to offer opportunities for those connections to happen. Ideally all students find something that sparks that connection and sometimes at a minimum a student literally takes their \u201cdegree\u201d at commencement and runs as they breathe a sigh of relief for making it through their time there. We don\u2019t always know the challenges each person went through just to make it to that commencement stage.",

On another note: It seems like the emcee dropped the ball if they didn't speak into the mic at the beginning of the ceremony and and ask everyone to remain seated for all the names to be read. That has been done at pretty much every type of recognition event I've ever attended including recently. But I've never attended one at CSUF so idk what they actually said. ... At athletic events it's well known that sportsmanship means team members stay to support their own team even if their event is over. Should be same for graduation. Just wish the administration was more respectful of the attendees' time and comfort levels. As someone mentioned earlier, they had coverings over themselves but not the guests.",

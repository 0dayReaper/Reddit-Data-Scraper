    "postText": "For context I'm a transfer student from CSUCI. It sounds like a definite no right, but I'm looking at a class right now where there's only two waitlisted spots left and I'm thinking to myself \"What's the thought process of all the people waitlisting past like the first five spots being taken\". Cause I imagine once you get past the first five spots maybe 6 spots there's like no likelihood of getting into the class right but idk maybe all these people know something I don't? Maybe there is a decent likelihood? 14 people dropping the class is pretty steep though, maybe they all bank on the professor saying \"screw it everyone on the waitlist can be in the class\". Does that happen often? They only gave 5 waitlist spots per class at CSUCI so I'm not accustomed to 15 spots. Just looking for some perspective on this and whether I should even bother going on the waitlist.",

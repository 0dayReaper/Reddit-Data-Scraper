Anyone from any college can sign up for this discount as long as you have an active .edu email and  provide a screenshot of your current school schedule. I believe UCSD snow team does this as well, but I haven\u2019t used them before. \n\nHere is a link to CSULB snow teams Ikon discount (google form not open yet): [link](https://csulbsnowteam.weebly.com/ikon-pass.html)\n\nGetting a discount code from a snow team is a larger discount than going with Ikon\u2019s own student discount :)",

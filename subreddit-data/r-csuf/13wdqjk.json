Similar to this post from CSULB ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CSULB/comments/13w9hfw/csulb\\_financial\\_aid\\_help/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSULB/comments/13w9hfw/csulb_financial_aid_help/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). Will the grants be enough to cover for cost of attendance? I'm also not really familiar with money being returned to me after I pay for the costs? I really liked how the top reply of the CSULB post explained it if someone can kindly explain it in the same or similar way (:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/br0uodidb53b1.png?width=2879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5c0b3a57888c40ed634cc0e9db9d6f6c19eb13e9",

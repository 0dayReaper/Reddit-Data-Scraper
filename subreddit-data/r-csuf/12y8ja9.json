I'm assuming they don't actually mean anything in terms of progress? It would be kinda nuts to have them all reach 70 I think right?](https://preview.redd.it/68m8jrysnyva1.png?width=1844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=32419e06abed08087e665ae22ac06bf616f3a3b3)",

            "comment": "They\u2019re just a way to see your progress visually. Each bar shows how many units you\u2019ve completed for each section.  Usually, if you use the Titan degree planner, the bars are either, blue, orange or yellow to show progress of completing the degree. Light blue means the units are in progress, orange means the units are unfulfilled, yellow are the units you\u2019ve planned on your Titan planner, and dark blue bars mean that the units are completed. They\u2019re just a way to keep track of what you\u2019ve done or plan to do, hope this helps :)",

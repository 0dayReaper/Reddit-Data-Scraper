    "postText": "So I transferred here from a cc in spring 2019. I did really well there so I didn\u2019t think the transition would be difficult. Man was I so wrong about that. I was really struggling and failing all my classes. I got put on academic probation for that semester and then got disqualified after performing terribly again in fall 2019. I was dealing with a lot mentally from personal issues to a job that was becoming very shitty for me to handle, and so much more. These things affected my ability to concentrate in school and I just could not continue, but I promised myself I would return to csuf and finished what I started when I felt ready to do so. \n\nSo I was not in school from spring 2020 through spring 2021 (3 semesters). This time was a huge mental break for me but also a time for me to handle the issues I was dealing with. This was also a time where I really learned a lot about myself. So being disqualified was truly a blessing in disguise to be honest. \n\nSo I came back and took classes through Open University in fall 2021 and spring 2022, got readmitted this past fall and took off. I\u2019ve done very well ever since and I\u2019m now finally graduating, and I can\u2019t be happier about it. So I just want to use this post as an opportunity to give hope to students who are struggling in similar ways that I did a few years ago. I know things can get really tough and one thing I\u2019ve learned is that everyone is going through something. Always have hope, stay strong, and believe in yourself. If you\u2019re struggling now, just know I love you and I am here for you. I got through my struggles, and I know you can get through yours too. You got this.\n\n\nSo as I am leaving, I just want to say best of luck to all of you and I hope you all realize your dreams!!",

It was difficult but that led to me being in a better headspace mentally and it also motivated me to put more effort into my classes. Not saying I didn\u2019t put in effort before because I always have, but I don\u2019t think it was maximized. For example, I started to read textbooks more. I wasn\u2019t really doing that before. I started asking my professors more questions instead of keeping my thoughts and doubts to myself. \n\nSo I just think if you are in the right mental headspace, you believe in yourself, and you maximize your effort, trust me, the results will show and it will feel all worth it in the end, just like I\u2019m feeling right now. I hope this helps and good luck to you!",

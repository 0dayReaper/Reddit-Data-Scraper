            "comment": "In regards to getting involved with Biomechanics you can try contacting Dr. Noffal, his contact information is found in the link below (the page also includes some information about the biomechanics lab):\n\nhttp://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/researchlabs/bm/index.php\n\nAsk how you can get involved in volunteering and helping with some of the research done in the lab. If you have to reach out to specific professors that mainly conduct research in the biomechanics field, there is also Dr. Scott Lynn. \n\nGraduate students can also take in some form of help with their research, you'd have to get their contact information somehow (maybe can be provided by one of the biomechanics professors, if not, the graduate program coordinator might be able to help, not sure though)\n\nSpeaking of the graduate program coordinator, they might be able to help you with questions in regards to the graduate program or direct you the person that can be best of help to you. When I attended CSUF, Dr. Lee was the graduate program coordinator, her contact info can be found in the link below.\n\nhttp://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/facultystaff/DoKyeongLee.php\n\nHope this helps you in finding the information you need. Just keep reaching out and contacting those involved in the program and area of your interest, current grad students also have useful information because they are where you hope to be one day.",

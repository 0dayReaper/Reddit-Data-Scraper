If you haven\u2019t, create a LinkedIn with a great headshot, fill out your experience and use chat gpt to come up with a clever line to attract your dream role. Once your profile is setup, search for people with your desired role. (Ex: Business Analyst). Then, filter by people who have attended CSUF. Once you have people, start requesting to connect and send a message to them. \n\nThis is where you play your student card. I used chat gpt and sent something like this: \n\nGood evening ____,\n\nI hope your week has been great so far!

I\u2019m getting my degree in Business Analytics tmrw, so you know we\u2019re on the same boat. What worked out for me is (ofc saying this as I\u2019m graduating and having a job lined up right after graduation, lucky me): \n- polish your resume with only professional details: no need to add irrelevant info that won\u2019t help you getting a chance to be interviewed \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014&gt; by this I mean internship(s): which you can find on LinkedIn, Handshake, Indeed, etc.\n- polish your LinkedIn\n- start walking out of your comfort zone: even if your concentration is in mgmt, be ready to be opened for more than 1 job title\n- be random: I was driving outside and saw an airplane flew up there, went home and look up positions in their company, I got a chance then got a job\n\u2014\u2014-&gt; even if you see different brands and companies, nail down different metropolitan areas outside of CA (it\u2019s damn harsh to squeeze in, unless you have 5-7 years of experience in the field)\n\nI hope you\u2019re gonna be easy on yourself. Your mental health is holding on its dear life, so be patient and don\u2019t give up. I was in your shoes in the past year. Things are tough right now. Do your best. And most importantly, quantity over quality (as of now); start applying as many as you can. \n\nHope these help! And congrats on your graduation \ud83e\udd73 that\u2019s a huge milestone, and I\u2019m proud of you no matter who you are. Great job!",

Make sure your previous job or volunteer experience is listed as professionally as possible and highlight any relevant skill sets that might be transferable to the jobs you\u2019re thinking of applying for. And just start forming connections. I believe you\u2019re only afforded like 100 connections a week but you can categorize it by both business, school attended, etc. Smash that connect button and max it out every week. The more connections you have, the more you\u2019re putting your name out there to potential employers. \n\nFor management positions as well, get knowledgeable in data analytics tools like SQL, Tableau, Power BI, etc. There\u2019s various courses you can do online that once completed, you can highlight on your profile. Highlight the courses you\u2019ve taken at CSUF as well and list the skill set you\u2019ve gained from passing those classes.",

    "postText": "Im a transfer student and i spent a solid 4 years at community college. Half of my courses were paid for and the other half i paid out of pocket so i never thought to apply to financial aid due to my parents making \u201ctoo much\u201d (middle class issue). So now its time for university and i applied to fasfa, but do i have to apply to the grants separately? I am also turning 24 next year and i make absolutely no money so i was wondering if i can still get cal grants or pell grants or any grants or aid. I don\u2019t start until this coming fall, i have also heard some people don\u2019t pay and wait till they are 24 so fasfa can cover their past expenses. i don\u2019t know if that is true, but if anyone has advice please help because i am #poor. \n\n(I fully financially support myself and live alone, 23 yrs old but not independent according to fasfa until 24)",

If you are independent, which it sounds like you are, then you should be able to get some aid. I have never heard about past expenses being paid off after becoming 24 but what I do know is that once you take over 150 of total course units, you won\u2019t be able to receive aid anymore cuz its their policy. So make sure you graduate on time before it cuts off",

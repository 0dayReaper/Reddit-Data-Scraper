    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nIt's me again, a Business Administration major looking to take ISDS 361A in this Fall semester.\n\nAccording to the TDA, **ISDS 361A** is listed as one of the courses that can be taken to fulfill the *B.5 - IMPLICATIONS AND EXPLORATIONS IN MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL SCIENCES* section of GE.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59ifbo802w4b1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=67a788aa97935ff6ca16796b11b6e5a35c587f4d\n\nMeanwhile, ISDS 361A is also one of the *Upper-Division Core Courses* of the Business Administration Major.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifjonjy12w4b1.png?width=830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=52d7445ca4e3b80fa4ae5df02a75c1051faa64c3\n\nSo, does that mean I can just take **ISDS 361A** and it **will be counted for both the B.5 section and the upper-division?** Please let me know if you know or you have taken the course and had it counted for both before. Thank you so much!",

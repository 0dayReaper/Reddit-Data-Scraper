I\u2019m considering transferring this fall and hoping to major in studio arts, and was hoping to get some feedback from those in the major or anyone who knows anything about it. \n\nHow was the program/classes/professors? How does the program hold up against other schools (my other csu option is CSULB)? Has the construction severely impacted the experience? Anything would help, thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "First off, Congratulations and it\u2019s great that you are  considering to transferring to CSUF. I do have to ask, what exactly are you trying to get out from a studio arts degree? All art students by default are Studio Arts majors, but have a certain concentration they wish to pursue. \n\nIn my opinion, I do think all construction and such is the least of the worries (but still, it should not affect your experience, if anything it is very is minute)\n\nA studio art degree covers a wide range of fields and the many professors that teaches the many mediums ranging from Life Drawing, 3D art, ceramics, sculpture, glasswork, etc all have their good and bad in terms of the classes you will take for the degree. I, personally, am graduating as a Studio Arts major, but have a more illustrative/game art background and choose to graduate to transfer elsewhere. \n\nMy advice for you is to know what exactly you are going to do with your degree and the position you will be taking as the education you are receiving as a general studio arts major is just a mixed medium of art.",

An equitable initiative would strive to equalize struggles along class, not something as useless as race/ethnicity. We\u2019re not living in 1960.\n\nUnless you also are a racist you will acknowledge there is far more in group variance than between group variance.\n\nWith the current AA system, an affluent Nigerian immigrant student whose parents are high earning enjoys the same privileges in college admissions and a wide variety of the same ethnicity-based scholarship opportunity as an inner-city child of a single mother struggling to make rent.\n\nAnd on the other end you have an Asian first generation immigrant students of lower socioeconomic class parents who will be penalized for simply being the wrong ethnicity. In many cases having GPAs and SAT scores far beyond their counterparts and still being fucked over.\n\nIts really sick and backwards, and completely unnecessary when the alternative of just having class based admission is on the table and easily stratified via IRS databases.\n\nThe discourse in America is so fuckin childish and braindead that we can\u2019t have a real, substantive discussion on the merits of this without people resorting to idiotic things like this bakery sale etc.. both sides are equally stupid and outdated. Left largely seems to believe the only way to remedy a race-based past is to have a race-based future, while the right dismisses historical discrimination and the very real contemporary struggles that resulted from the past.",

    "postText": "Did anyone got denied for the internship class before? What did u do to persuade them to grant u approval? I tried emailing a bunch of people but all they ever do is direct me to other department or straight up like not answering my question. And yes, i did try emailing the dean, the cice department and waiting for a couple of other email. This is so frustrating tbh and it feels like i pay thousands of dollar every year to get like no support or help. If u wanna know why i got denied, simply bc they think it is not complex enough for the class. And tbh i dont even know what the internship class teach u about. This is a required for me so i can\u2019t just do the internship if i want to since i\u2019m on F-1 visa",

Look at the ISS website and schedule an appointment with the ISS advisor. You\u2019ll still have time to figure this out, lmk if you have any questions !",

My internship should be starting on June 6th and I need the internship class to be approved but like i said they denied me. But thank you for ur advice! I\u2019m a finance major so not sure if i can even do volunteer lol",

It's a pretty easy A class that's primarily about career and professionalism development, open for all majors.",

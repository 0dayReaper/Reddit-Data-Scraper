It\u2019s doable but definitely not easy - I\u2019m double majoring but it\u2019s gonna take me 5 years (3 in cc, 2 at csuf). \n\nI definitely think the fact that CSUF doesn\u2019t charge by units enrolled incentivizes you to take as many classes as possible to get more bang for your buck, but I also would say that I\u2019m not double majoring in any stem fields so the workload per class might be different for you\n\nAs for forensics, I highly recommend it! I did it at cc and my experiences in it are actually what motivated me to double major in the first place",

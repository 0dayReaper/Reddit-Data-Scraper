They take their lack of moral integrity with them as they become employed, whether it be in business or government. I\u2019m amazed how willing people are to cheat rather than be honest with themselves. If you have to cheat to reach your goals, you\u2019re probably not following the path that\u2019s right for you anyways.\n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re someone struggling with mental health issues, stuff like proctorio drives down your performance on tests. It becomes difficult to remain calm and focus on the test you\u2019re taking when you\u2019re paranoid of being accused of cheating, because you know professors are looking at everything you do because they know how many people cheat.",

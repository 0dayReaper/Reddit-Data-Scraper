I'm interested in the Exchange and Study Abroad Programs offered by CSUF, particularly the opportunity to attend Peking University in China. \n\nHas anyone applied for these programs before and can share their experience? What are the qualifications required to be eligible? Do you need to be an outstanding student? I have been learning Mandarin for six months and would love to explore Chinese culture further through this program \ud83c\udf37",

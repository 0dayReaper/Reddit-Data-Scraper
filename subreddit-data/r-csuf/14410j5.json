If there is space or other people don't show up the professor might add you.\n\nUsually you'll climb some waitlist spots after payment is due and other classes might end up having openings so be on the lookout during that time. I've gotten into classes taught by popular professors by waking up early the day payment is due and snagging an opening.",

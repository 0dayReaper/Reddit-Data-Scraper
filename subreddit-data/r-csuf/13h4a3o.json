Or do we line up, walk across the stage, then take our seats? \n\nAlso, can we go to the bathroom during the ceremony if we have to? My ceremony is at titan stadium\n\nThank uuu \ud83d\ude03",

They can\u2019t stop you from going to use the restroom but last year it was a bit of a hassle especially after I walked so I waited until we were done. \n\nMy department posted on instagram a bunch of tips and run throughs to make it easier for everyone. The best thing I did though was talked to the people in front of me once I lined up. Just a simple \u201cam I in the right line?\u201d Broke the ice and we were able to talk about our nerves and it made the experience so much nicer.",

I can\u2019t remember when exactly I got there but I think it was somewhere between 1 hour before and 1.5 hours before. You take pictures a bit before and checked in and I remember it got backed up as we got closer to the time so they probably want to make sure you have enough time for that. You do stand around for a while after check in though so be prepared. They do explain the procedure for everything but you\u2019ll mostly just be standing until go time.",

It\u2019s like you in front of a screen, then they take another before you walk across the stage, then one as you walk. Then you have the option to purchase them later.",

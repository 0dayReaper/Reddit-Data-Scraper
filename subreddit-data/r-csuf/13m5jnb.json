However, if you want the extra guidance (which not many people go to), you can do Math 115 with workshop.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't recommend Math 115A and B because that requires you to take two semesters of math. However, just go with where you think your math capabilities are. Math 115 is basically high school algebra.",

You will get credit for the class also but your gpa will be impacted since it will take the average. I retook calc 1 at community since I failed at community college. I didn\u2019t have to take it at csuf anymore but my gpa was impacted since my grades were averaged. I got an F at Csuf and a B at Community College",

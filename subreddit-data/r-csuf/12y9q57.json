Was also planning on adding another elective course as well. Does anyone have anyone recommendation for easier/manageable upper division courses and elective courses?",

If you get a good professor for those harder classes you should be fine. But if you don\u2019t then maybe drop one and keep one of the easy ones. But if you\u2019re pretty good at school then you should be fine since it\u2019s only 2 fairly difficult courses.",

    "postText": "So i\u2019m currently making a list of the classes I\u2019d want to take for the fall 2023 semester to send to an advisor, and I was just wondering if it\u2019s normal for transfer students to get the leftovers of classes/professors? Because I was trying to get make some sort of schedule but any type of required class and even electives that i need to take are either taken, have terrible professors, or are at inconvenient times. Thanks in advance",

And no I do not think my major is impacted(Business administration w/concentration in marketing). But yeah i was just mainly wondering if for other previous transfer students had to go through the same situation for their first semester. Thanks for the input tho",

After this Fall semester you'll be fine, but the advice I would give you for your first semester is to have lots of backup and expect that you will definitely have to just take what you can get. totally normal, just the way it is.",

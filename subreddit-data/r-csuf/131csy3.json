He drops your lowest grade for labs and homeworks. He is extremely funny and actually cares about his students. Plus, he offers extra credit opportunities.",

However, his class is specifically for people that are not great with math (he even said this at the beginning of the semester). He does SO MANY practice problems before the exams and makes sure that we actually understand the material. He even gives us videos on how to do the homeworks/labs. You just have to pay attention to what he says.",

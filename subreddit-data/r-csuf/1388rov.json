If it's any help, you can try to get in and if you don't, go to community college. I really wish I went to cc instead of straight into a university. It would've really saved me a lot of money due to only being able to get loans for finanacial aide. That's one of my biggest regrets. Please reach out to me if you need anymore guidance",

One thing I warn students of is that the smartest professors aren\u2019t always the best at teaching. You have to be able to bridge the intelligence gap vs taking student learning for granted. I find that especially true for those heavily engaged (biased) in research, since that\u2019s what brings in grant money, notoriety. Teaching can become a lower priority. Keep that in mind. If you would like to chat about it, I\u2019m in my office late mornings Monday through Thursday",

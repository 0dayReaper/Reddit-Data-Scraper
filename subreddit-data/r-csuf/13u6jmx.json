    "postText": "Are there anyone else that can\u2019t enroll for summer courses because of the prepayment hold? I just did mine yesterday and my account is still on hold. I followed the chart where I paid $320 per unit with the campus fees. Since the course I\u2019m planning to take is 3 units, it came to be about $1.3k which I did for the prepayment. However my hold hasn\u2019t been removed yet and the course is about to start on Tuesday.",

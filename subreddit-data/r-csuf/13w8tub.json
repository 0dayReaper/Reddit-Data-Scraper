I took Shepard and for his class, reading was very important if you want to pass the exams. Some of the terms  and court cases were pretty hard to memorize and some processes. Some of the chapters were pretty interesting but majority of it was hard and kinda boring. I got a C as my overall grade. Don't take this class if it's optional.",

It\u2019s primarily how to use the first amendment to your advantage, some stuff about copyright and trademark laws, and pacs &amp; super pacs. \n\nIt\u2019s def a challenge but it\u2019s also super interesting!!",

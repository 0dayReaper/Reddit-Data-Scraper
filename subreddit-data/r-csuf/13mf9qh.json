    "postText": "i got accepted into the university honors program when i first applied, and now finishing my freshman year i realize its defintely something i am not interested in doing. im not sure how to formally drop out, or if i stay in the program but don't take the courses. the priority registration is amazing and i'd hate to lose that, but i don't want to stay in the program if not taking the classes will prevent me from graduating. \n\nanyone know how this stuff works?",

I have a handful of friends in the program who never formally left and they\u2019re all graduating too. My suggestion is to ride it out a bit longer (but don\u2019t take any Honors classes if you don\u2019t want) until you have enough credits for more priority registration. \n\nI will add too though that I really enjoyed my upper division Honors GE\u2019s in the smaller classes. And in my experience, that my friends have echoed too, the professors grade a lot more leniently so that might be something you want to consider.",

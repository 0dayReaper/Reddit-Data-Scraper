    "postText": "So I enrolled in Art 107B with Professor Andrew Dickson for Fall 2023 since Art 107B is the last of the prerequisite courses I need to take for a BFA. I\u2019m going to try and make a portfolio to be accepted into Entertainment Art &amp; Game Art. Does anyone have any art class recommendations to help build up my portfolio? I don\u2019t have much experience with digital drawing (I\u2019m used to traditional drawing) outside of graphic design, so maybe something dealing with that? Or on the other hand, should I just fill up my other units for the fall semester with upper division GE classes? Any suggestions would be appreciated! \u2764\ufe0f",

Meet up with the person on campus to make the sale. Most safest way to get it done. \n\nIf the seller is making excuses to not meet up at school, offer to meet up at a public place near them and at a time that's works for them. If they still refuse, red flag \ud83d\udea9\n\n2. If you HAVE to buy without meeting up with them, dont.\n\n3. If you still have a need to buy the tickets not in person, DON'T USE ZELLE OR VENMO. They're meant for people you know and it will be difficult/impossible to dispute charges.\n\nI'd recommend only using PayPal. If they refuse to use anything else but PayPal, that's a red flag \ud83d\udea9\n\n4. If you STILL are going to buy even if they want to use something like Zelle or Vemmo, ask for their Instagram. Ask for a photo of the tickets or any kind of proof that it exists. Check if their Zelle email or Venmo user lines up with their IG user or their name.\n\nA lot of instances, the email or money app username the scammer is using includes a name (\"jjohnn425@aol.com\" \"@sunnshinee882\") but its way different from their instagram (\"@urCoffingirll\")",

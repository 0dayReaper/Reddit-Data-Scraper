I've emailed \"Emilia Gaskell\" (the event coordinator) 3 weeks ago asking about this and, since then, have not yet received a response. Does anyone know if I'm able to still pick up the medallion starting on this date and onwards? And/or, does anyone know who else I can contact to inquire about this?",

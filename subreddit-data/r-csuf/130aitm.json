    "postText": "Hey, im looking to go to either csuf (cs) or sjsu (swe), and have been doing research on the programs.\n\nive read alot about how bad csuf's cs program is, but also am reading about how every school complains abt their cs program. i have also read that they have been upping their game, like getting rid of those terrible professors that ppl were complaining abt . i have a few things i want to know about so here they are. the only thing keeping me from completely throwing csuf out the window is location which ik isnt the best reason\n\ni will be dorming at both, but i am from norcal, specifically the bay \n\ni am planning on trying to put 100% into either school to make the best of it, which includes a lot of self learning.\n\n1. how are the professors? ive heard there are really good ones in those upper classes, but rlly lazy and just terrible professors as well in general. it seems to me like the professors make or break the class, not the things that you learn\n2. how bad is signing up for classes? will it affect my time to graduate at csuf? i saw somewhere that they changed it recently so you can see which professor is teaching what, but ive only seen this once. is it true?\n3. do you feel like the classes are setting u up for the future? how much self learning do you have to end up doing?\n\nthx yall",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2020 so I'll share my experience.\n\n1. When registering for class the professor was hidden so it was difficult to get good ones. You kinda just roll the dice and get who you get. I would say I was satisfied with the professor about 70% of the time, the other 30% being grad student fillers or one of the bad or lazy ones.\n\n2. There was always enough classes back then but I'll let more recent student comment.\n\n3. Yes the classes definitely set me up well, my github was pretty broad and I had good linux experience by the time I graduated so it opened a lot of doors. Also I believe any CS program is gonna end up being heavy on self learning so this isn't unique to CSUF.",

Hope it works out for you wherever you go :)\nEdit: Also if I may, it\u2019s not an exact science but when deciding between CSUF, SFSU, and CPP, I took the average score of every Finance prof at both schools from rate my professor and I felt like it helped my decision a bit.\nSo if you have the time to do it, it might be worth.",

    "postText": "I submitted my family size certificate &amp; parent tax statements back in April before the due date and it\u2019s been initiating ever since (so like 2 months lol), I gave the financial aid office a call and asked about it just to make sure and they said that they aren\u2019t receiving some of the submitted files even though people submitted them through the student portal hold. You can\u2019t resubmit it online, and there\u2019s a way to resubmit it, but they don\u2019t know how to do it, so ur basically kinda fucked on that end? They said the alternative is to print out the forms and get them signed (with the additional required documents signed too) and then fax it to them, or give it to them in person (no emailing), and then you\u2019ll be set. If you\u2019ve initiated it back in April before the due date, ur good if you resubmit it now! Not everyone\u2019s having an issue with this but they said they already started working on documents from last week so if ur holds still say that they\u2019re initiated even tho u submitted ur stuff like 2 months ago, u might want to resubmit it thru fax or in person just to make sure \ud83d\udc4d Feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong idk but this is all the stuff the guy over the phone told me, and idk if anyones made a post abt this yet but I hope it helps someone \ud83d\ude4f",

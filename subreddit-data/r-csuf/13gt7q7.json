As for the scams, you can easily meet in person to get them guranteed with no risk. They are just trying to make their moneys worth after spending so much. It\u2019s really not that deep man.",

If you don\u2019t want to buy tickets, prioritize who you are taking to your graduation or have your friend give them to you if you are so worried of getting screwed. Crying about it on reddit isn\u2019t going to make people not sell their tickets. Again not that deep.",

Faculty salaries stagnate, tenure lines are cut, and the majority of teachers are designated \u2018part time temporary employees.\u2019  I have been teaching at CSUF for 25 years and that is my status.\nMeanwhile, administrators come and go, creating stupid programs to justify their salary, leveraging ever higher salaries then on to the next job.  Rinse and repeat.\nI don\u2019t need to tell you what students are going through now.\nThere have been student movements over the years that have slowed this.  One still around (I think) is Students for Quality Education SQE.  Check them out or organize yourself.  Go beyond Reddit outrage or the superficial wokeness of the twitterati.",

I searched the salary of other jobs and looks like tenured faculty make a good amount as well but what\u2019s concerning is why we can\u2019t get more employees for student services. Researched and actually felt sorry seeing what these coordinators or advisors make because it\u2019s definitely not a living based on cost around here.",

I actually have great time management skills and do well in school but thank you. \nIt\u2019s reasonable to ask why hiring or asking for more staff to support students is not being done. Larger budget in comparison to what they make doesn\u2019t justify pay. Larger budget should equate to prioritizing student demands and needs. I am not saying they don\u2019t deserve to make good money but if they aren\u2019t hiring nor making an effort to make budget to hire more faculty and staff like other institutions then the pay seems unjustifiable. All to say this conversation has much more nuance that can\u2019t be covered all on a Reddit post. You have to wonder though if several hundred people like the sentiment of this post (however it represents what they feel) then there is something wrong.",

OU is for all students ranging from those who just want some kind of certification to those who failed out of CSUF and want back in. if you flunked out your freshman or sophomore year, i suggest just taking the classes you failed at a CC and transferring in. if you flunked out in your upper divs, i would make an appt with an academic advisor in your major/college and talk to open university about where you stand academically (leaving for personal or mental health reasons bodes better than flunking out all your classes and can sometimes have an affect on re-enrollment). def talk to records and registration too because sometimes programs like this need your transcripts. just make sure to make an appt with your advisor before visiting R&amp;R, but i strongly suggest calling Open University first (or going in person) and asking your questions. best of luck to you!",

I am currently an open university student(was disqualified)and they have been helpful to making sure I can get back. You can only take 2 classes a semester maximum 24 units will count for your degree(was told exceptions can be made). Major/regular advising aren\u2019t helpful to students who aren\u2019t enrolled into CSUF so I wouldn\u2019t go down that rabbit hole. Once you\u2019re back in talk to them. Best of luck!",

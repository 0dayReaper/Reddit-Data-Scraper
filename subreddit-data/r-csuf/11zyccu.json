Mihaylo. Personally, can\u2019t think I\u2019d be too fond of SGM, but it is interesting to note that Mihaylo tried to sell a new phone system to the university, only for Virjee to shut down that idea, and then just last year, the university changed to be using entirely Zoom soft phones, which are rather inefficient.\n\nAlso, Mihaylo is a hyper conservative who wanted Virjee to hire as many conservative faculty and staff as there are liberal, like that\u2019s information that is taken into consideration when hiring people.\n\nEdit: fixed the link",

It's very unwise for public universities to name any buildings or schools after a person who's still living and who can still tarnish the reputation of the institution.\n\nHere's another case in which a university had to rename their sport arena after giving the naming rights to Walmart heirs, which they named after their daughter Paige Laurie.\n\n\"Paige Laurie, granddaughter of Wal-Mart co-founder Bud Walton, was given a bachelor\u2019s degree by the USC Annenberg School for Communication in May 2004.\"\n\nShe was reportedly caught cheating afterwards when her roommate admitted that she was paid to do Paige's school work.\n\n\"After the cheating allegations surfaced last November, the University of Missouri removed her name from a sports arena named for her. Her parents, billionaires Bill and Nancy Laurie, the daughter of Walton, had received naming rights for the building in exchange for donating $25 million toward its construction.\"\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-oct-20-me-heiress20-story.html",

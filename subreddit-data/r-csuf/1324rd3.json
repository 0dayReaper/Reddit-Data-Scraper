    "postText": "I went in person yesterday to the financial aid office and was told I did get the summer grant and a hold would be placed on my account so that I wouldn\u2019t be disenrolled. Called today and the lady told me that apparently no I did not get the summer grant and I had no holds etc. Tried to talk to someone else in the financial aid office but the lady who deals with summer grant isn\u2019t there until next week, which is well past the summer payment date. I\u2019m stressed bc I\u2019m a senior and need those 2 classes to finish my degree. Did anyone else get the grant? Or does anyone have an \u201canticipated financial aid\u201d hold on their account? Or can anyone help?",

    "postText": "Hello Everyone! \n\nI am looking into the chemistry masters program at csuf. I see the deadline for this is in October. My question is when does the application open in CSU apply? I have constantly been checking but doesn\u2019t appear. Another question is, for letters of recommendation, do I submit the letters or do the professors have to submit them through a link? \n\nSorry for the dumb questions, first generation student trying to be the first to do anything in my whole family.",

The email will ask you for all the necessary documentation, which you will send in for admissions approval. I hope this information helps. That was the process I went through when I was accepted into the Fall 2023 master's program at CSUF.",

I just know at CSUF for Masters in Computer, Software engineering it\u2019s October 1st and it\u2019s a cohort based program and competitive. So you can only apply in fall for fall admission. You need to reach out to the dept. your interested in and see if spring 24 is an option.",

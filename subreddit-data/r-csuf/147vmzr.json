Does it look good on my resume even just for a year? \n\nFor reference my GPA is a 3.5 so it\u2019s high enough to join",

Nice to have on your resume, great networking; but if you don\u2019t join, it won\u2019t hurt you or your resume.\n\nIf you are planning applying for grad school, and have time to commit, go for it.\n\nIf you are planning to work after graduation, what\u2019s most important is how much experience in the field you want to work post-grad at time of graduation.",

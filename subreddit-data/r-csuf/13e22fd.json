    "postText": "Hi All, \n\nI am currently registered for a fall class that requires a class that I am taking right now as a prereq. If I get a D in the prereq class will the system kick me out of the class that requires it automatically or will I be able to just stay quiet and take the next class after getting a D in the prereq?\n\nI really don't want to push my graduation back an entire semester if I can avoid doing so and plan to retake the prereq class next to the class that follows it in spring.. \n\nThanks",

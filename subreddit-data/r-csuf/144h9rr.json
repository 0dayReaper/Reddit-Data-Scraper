    "postText": "So I am transferring from Chaffey College. I am sending over my final posted grades from my Spring semester to CSUF today. I got an email saying that registration starts tomorrow. I\u2019m going over my audit results on my portal and it obviously shows that I haven\u2019t completed some GE yet but it\u2019s because I need to still send my final grades from Chaffey. I don\u2019t have orientation until next Friday the 16th. I read on here that we will get our classes at orientation but I\u2019m worried that if I don\u2019t register tomorrow I won\u2019t get the classes/schedule I want. I need to be full time but I can only take morning classes because I work from 3pm-11pm Sun-Thurs so I picked out classes that fit in that schedule. I\u2019m kind of lost\u2026.. do I register tomorrow or wait until orientation ??? Help!! \ud83d\ude2d",

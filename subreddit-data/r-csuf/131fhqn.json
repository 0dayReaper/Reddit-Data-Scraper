At the beginning of the semester, he specifically told us that his class is for people that do not like math/think that they are not that great with math. He does so many practice problems before exams and actually makes sure that you get the material. Plus, you basically finish his class early if you do well on his two exams and complete 4/5 homeworks and labs.",

He will make sure you understand the concepts before the exams. There are two exams are online, open note, and not timed\n\nThe other comment pretty much sums his class up perfectly",

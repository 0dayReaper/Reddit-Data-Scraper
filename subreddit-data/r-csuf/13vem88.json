    "postText": "For anyone who has taken a summer course over at CSUF, when would we know the final exam date for that specific class. I am taking Linear Algebra over the summer and wish to know if the final exam is just the last day of class or another date scheduled sometime after the class is finished. This is my first time taking a college summer class so any advice is welcome.",

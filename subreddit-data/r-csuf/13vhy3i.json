    "postText": "When calculating GPA for a grad program, does the admissions committee calculate CC classes into your GPA, or do they only look at the GPA from the institution where you received your degree? I\u2019m interested in the Psych MS program, but I\u2019m right under the GPA cutoff if it\u2019s only looking at where I received my BA.",

So I skimmed over the application for grad psych students and it looks like they look at overall gpa (2.5+), gpa from the last 60 semester units (2.5+), and gpa in psych classes (3.0+). If you\u2019re under the minimum, I would just apply anyway! There\u2019s a lot of other factors that go into the admissions process. Since there\u2019s less applicants than undergrad admissions, they take the time to look at applicants as a whole person.",

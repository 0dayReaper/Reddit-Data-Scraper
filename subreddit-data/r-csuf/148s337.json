    "postText": "What are the chances of getting out of the waitlist for the counseling program at CSUF? When I asked, I was informed the waitlist wasn't ranked and was random. They could notify me up until the first day of school, but I'm impatient. I tried to email the program to make my case but just get an auto-reply. I'm stressed if I can or can't get in. I really wanted to be part of this program since it 100% described what I wanted to do with my degree.",

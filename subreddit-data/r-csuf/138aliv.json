    "postText": "I am hoping to attend a Cal State. What are my odds ofgetting accepted into one of the Cal States in the LA area? Iam a California resident, and will graduate from high schoolhere, and I have a 2.8 GPA, but I expect to have at least a 2.9by the end of my senior year. I am very anxious about this,but my grades show a definite upward trend since freshmanyear, online school didn't treat me well that year. I amplanning to use the CalVet program to get free tuitionbecause my dad is disabled from the navy.\nI noticed that the cal state website says (basically) that anystudents from California with over a 2.5 will are \"elligible\"and students from California with a 2.0-2.49 will beconsidered.Does this mean that me, with a 2.8 and being aCalifornia high schooler will certainly get in? or does it justmake me able to be considered? I know this should be askedon a proper Cal State subreddit but I can't seem to find oneand I thought I would find the best results here. Thanks inadvance and sorry for any typos, I'm on a phone.",

Yes it\u2019ll be two years at a CC but if you\u2019re looking to get a degree from a more prestigious school, say USC or similar, there\u2019s that route also since the tuition will be covered. Just food for thought.",

Saves time/money/energy to take the exact same courses at a CC and transfer with a solid GPA to your ideal Cal state.\n\nYou can always apply to a Cal state and see what happens!",

Many students are commuters who are often working and going to school. Not to say you won't make friends but not in the same ways. CC to Name brand school.\n\n- Don't care: go to CSU \n\n\n\nDo you know what major you would like to do? \n\n-Yes: CSU\n\n-No: Community College to explore different majors\n\n\n\nDo you think you will succeed at the college level without further development?\n\n-Yes: CSU (study hard)\n\n-No: go to community College to develop your study skills. Get yoir GPA up and prove to yourself you can compete at a high level.\n\n\n\nWhat is important to you?",

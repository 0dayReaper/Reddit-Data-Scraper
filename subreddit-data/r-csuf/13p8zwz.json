I found out I'm going to be graduating 1 semester early cuz I had a lot of credit coming in from HS and was wondering if I should do minor in CS. I've heard ISDS dept is trash but don't know much about CS. \n\nAlso still on the fence abt doing joint emphasis in Fin/acct.\n\nWould love to hear your guys' experiences. Thanks all",

    "postText": "Hello!\nI am trying to do the Orientation for Online but it doesn\u2019t let me pay the 100 dollar fee or even continue on with it. The orientation also say it starts and ends on May 15 but i don\u2019t understand with the online orientation is supposed to go all through August. It is also not sending me any confirmation email though it states it is. What should I do? Could it be that the school portal is broken? I know I am supposed to do this i order to register but I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026? any answers could help!",

The financial aid tab in your portal may give you more information. \nAlso, I was told that confirmation emails could take 48 hours to send for orientation. You could always send an email to orientation to be sure that your request went through!",

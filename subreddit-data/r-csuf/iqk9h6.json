Sometimes it helps to follow a similar routine at home that you would on-campus: get your morning coffee/tea, the meal you'd normally eat, the ppl you'd normally talk to, etc. It might bring you into a different mindset that feels less like COVID school and more like your normal academic experiences.",

My boyfriend is currently in college algebra so that he can also progress through engineering. The problem is that algebra is the base of everything math. In calculus, you're less likely to make a calculus mistake than a simple algebra mistake. This class is SO IMPORTANT for the entire rest of his career and the professor can't even be bothered to teach in class twice a week. SMDH.\n\nThe professor did offer \"office hours \" or that you could \"email him\" and ask for help. But its useless when the initial discussion isn't there!",

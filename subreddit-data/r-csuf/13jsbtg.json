For example, I\u2019m Child and Adolescent Development, and they sent us an email a while ago saying they were going to add more sections because they are hearing about a lot of students being waitlisted. Besides that, you really have to wait until tuition is due because some students will be dropped from classes if they forget to pay. My best advice is to just check on classes once in a while because you never know when you find a class that might have 1-2 open seats all of a sudden.",

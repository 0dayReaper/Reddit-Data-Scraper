The biggest perk for me, aside from special honors classes (15 seats, basically everyone gets an A guaranteed) and the priority registration, was the project itself. I\u2019m working on getting mine published in a journal right now. It\u2019s a huuuge way to promote yourself in the industry if you do it right.\n\nBesides, there are no obligations. You can join the program and just use the priority until they realize and kick you out.",

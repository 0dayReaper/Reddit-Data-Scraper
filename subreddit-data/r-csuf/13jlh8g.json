    "postText": "I was about to enter the library when a guy came up to me. He was a relatively short (I\u2019m a 5\u201910\u201d woman for reference) African American man and stopped me to tell me I look nice. He spent a couple seconds  complimenting me but I couldn\u2019t pick up anything he was saying because he mumbled so much, and my ears are the WORST at audio processing T-T. \nHe wasn\u2019t super creepy, but after he mumbled his compliments he continued to keep walking as if we never talked, not even a goodbye.\nI was taken aback at how sudden the interaction stopped and how it ended, a surreal moment for sure.\nHas anyone encountered him before?",

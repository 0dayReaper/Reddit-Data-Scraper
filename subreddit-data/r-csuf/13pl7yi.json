Is financial aid/scholarship available?\n\nFinally, how's the location for future job prospects?",

            "comment": "I'm not a MS student, but I will give you my fully honest opinion as someone who's currently finishing their BS in CS and has met a lot of MS students.\n\nFirst and foremost, there are good professors at csuf, but there are also a lot of bad professors. We currently have a staffing issue at the school, so it is possible that you might even take a class being taught by a fellow grad student. Depending on that grad student at hand, you may or may not learn something. You will get priority registration as an MS student I believe, so you'll have the advantage of getting your classes earlier than everyone. But I don't want to sugarcoat it, it's very likely you could encounter mediocre professors and you'll be taking many of your classes alongside undergrad students, so maybe the content might not exactly feel like it's \"grad level\" per say.\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities to find work on campus from my experience, if you just ask around. There are TA (lab assistant) opportunities if you ask professors, but more often than not people I know end up getting positions as graders. A lot of the MS students are incentivized to teach classes as well, since again, we have a staffing issue.\n\nThe avg cost of living: HIGH, it's southern California. A lot of the places to rent, especially apartments near the campus, are around the 1300/month mark or higher.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure the location fully matters. There are defense companies here in OC, alongside local companies. Despite this, the competition right now is extremely high due to the state of the job market. Unless things start going back to normal, it is possible you'd have to branch out of the OC area to find internships/work. But again, there are companies based here locally or have local locations, so it's not a bad area to look for work.",

                            "comment": "There's been staffing issues since covid (when we were mainly online), basically there's too many students and not enough professors. As a result, the school resorts to grad students teaching classes, or appointing professors who are not interested in a specific subject to teach a class on that subject.\n\nFor example, I had a professor this semester who told us on the first day to our faces that she didn't want to teach the class (backend web development) and that her specialization is in AI/ML, but the school appointed her anyways despite the fact that she doesn't know much about web development.\n\n1300 was for a shared apartment. It is possible to get something cheaper in Fullerton, but that's about the average near campus (although others may know much more than me)",

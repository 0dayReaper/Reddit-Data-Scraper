    "postText": "There are people asking for money around campus, there is an African American going around campus saying this brother died from gun violence and I have seen him going around campus asking people for a donation. DONT do it, he\u2019s been asking for quite a long time. Just ignore people that ask for money or approach that requires you to do something like that. This needs to be upvoted. If you fall for this trick, ask nicely for the money back, I asked him because I didn\u2019t know where it was going to. I was also a victim",

So I assume they don't actually go to CSUF if they're asking around like that.",

If so, what was wrong with that one?\n\nDoes anyone ever ask CSUF/President\u2019s Office how they justify these expenditures? The university has a lot of debts and obligations to pay (especially to the City of Fullerton) and yet they choose to prioritize something like this.",

But for the fire marshal to do that, he also needs to check everything else in MH that it is up to code. Which things are definitely not.\n\nSo the universities solution is to just wait there, with the new elevator, slowly rusting away from disuse instead of using money to fixing things in MH so they can get the damn elevator working.",

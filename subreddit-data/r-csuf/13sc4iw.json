I think if you really take advantage of what they offer then it can really be beneficial for you. \nIf you haven\u2019t already, get an internship somewhere. Even better if you have more than one internship on your resume. \nCurrently, I\u2019m not working in marketing because it\u2019s been rough out here \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I could have continued to apply for marketing jobs and work a part time while doing so; however, I needed experience so I took an office job even though it\u2019s not related to marketing.

I honestly feel like jobs for marketing are highly competitive bc it\u2019s an oversaturated major, so I suggest looking into other career choices where you could apply what you learned!! There are hella business functions out there, and I honestly was just applying to random ones I saw that I was qualified for \ud83d\ude2d",

Then for GE you need to take A.1 (oral comm/Hcom 100), A.2 written comm (engl 101) and A.3 critical thinking (usually Phil 105) plus math. So 5 art classes and the 4 GE classes spread out your first year. You will have orientation over the summer that will explain this. Take the orientation as soon as possible since you can\u2019t register until you do. If you want to take a summer class, take one of the GE classes. You can also take at a community college. Good luck and don\u2019t stress.",

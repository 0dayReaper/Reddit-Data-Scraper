    "postText": "hey guys, just making this post to warn anyone who attends csuf of bible solicitors, specifically a group of young guys that belong to a church called city of angels (ICC). I ran into them on campus and was invited to do a bible study with them, as a proud christian and man of faith I agreed. I did a total of 5 bible studies back to back and soon realized they were basically picking and choosing verses and concepts to jump me into their church which seems more like a cult. Their main point is that they are the only right christians and everyone else is a pagan and therefore not saved. Not only that but they were pressuring me into going to their church and being baptized in order to be saved, but the thing that really raised red flags was the false doctrine that they were the only correct and saved christians. Guys, whether you believe in God or not, I urge anyone to stay away from these people, the doctrine they preach is false and their tactics are very aggressive. once you are in deep it will be hard to get out!!!!!!!! if anyone asks if you would like to do a bible study, ASK what church and denomination they belong to and what you are going to specifically study!!!! Do not be pressured into meeting with these guys, they are extremely persistent and will want to \"study\" the bible everyday in hopes of getting people to join their cult-like church!!!!!!!",

            "comment": "I had a similar experience with a group called Alpha Omega. They consider themselves part of The Church of Jesus Christ, which believes you have to be baptized through their church and denote yourself as a disciple to be saved. They were a super friendly and outgoing group, but through a personal Bible study I attended with them, I felt as though they were trying to indoctrinate me in a way and pressuring me to be baptized by them. I had a friend in another group warn me about them around that time and I soon got out of it. Now I only attend Cru, they\u2019re super welcoming to all types of Christians and follow very sound doctrine and scripture.",

After a quick google search I learned that the church they were from was directly linked to the international Christian church which is known for being super cultish and controlling. I personally really enjoy attending inter varsity meetings ! Those guys are also really welcoming!",

I can\u2019t speak for all of the Bible study solicitors but the guys that I was in contact with had no jobs and donated plasma to get by so they could go from campus to campus all day long trying to get people to join their cult by luring them in with a bible study.",

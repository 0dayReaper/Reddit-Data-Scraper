I also thought if I submitted they would disappear but they are still there. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "Hi, I would recommend you to either go in person and ask for the forms. If you can't, try calling multiple times throughout today to financial aid  (657) 278-3125 and asking them if someone from there team can send you the forms to your csu email. Also try filling out this form at this link down below, this is you sending a query to the financial aid office help desk, they do tend to reply 2-3 days, I know it doesn't help at all since the deadline for the verification is tomorrow, but the help desk query is where I got my verification documents sent to me in a email and i just printed them out. Hope this helps. Also to submit them I would recommend you dropping them at the csuf financial aid office dropbox  located to the right of there main door or faxing the doucemnts at csuf Financial aid fax  number 657-278-1595. I faxed mines through FedEx, it was quick and easy they received my documents. Good Luck!!\n\n[https://titans.service-now.com/service\\_desk/com.glideapp.servicecatalog\\_cat\\_item\\_view.do?sysparm\\_id=69036da01bf788100cd0ebd56e4bcbc3](https://titans.service-now.com/service_desk/com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do?sysparm_id=69036da01bf788100cd0ebd56e4bcbc3)",

Additionally, I plan to minor in Marketing, so any insights on how these majors could complement each other would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "I graduated with business analytics in 2020, so my experience needs to be contextualized with the full blown pandemic that ensued at that time. Also, things were probably a little different back then course-wise.\n\nThe ISDS courses themselves were alright, but I felt like they could\u2019ve done a better job with teaching us more of the softwares used in industry and maybe providing more opportunities to build a portfolio of analytics projects.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I struggled with finding internships and experience within analytics. For example, I went to career fairs and noticed a lot of emphasis on accounting and finance roles, hardly any ISDS roles. \n\nPost-grad was kind of a shit show. I felt like many of the job listings I saw were catered towards those with graduate level knowledge of analytics and the different softwares. There is a lot of emphasis on your ability to show you have the experience and the hard skills. I graduated with a basic knowledge of SQL, Tableau, SPSS, and a few other programs. Even with this knowledge, I still felt like it wasn\u2019t enough. I only just got my first analytics role a few months ago, 2 years after graduating. \n\nI would suggest this concentration if this is something you are passionate about. If you can take initiative, build an analytics portfolio on your own time, and pursue the exploration of data sets that you are genuinely interested in, then you will be ok. When I graduated, I felt very behind compared to other applicants. But like I said, my experience was probably heavily affected by the pandemic. Everyone\u2019s experience will be different. Good luck!",

Marketing is so competitive because so many people do it, resulting in less pay. I\u2019m not sure if marketing could assist you in Information systems, maybe in Business Analytics. A good minor concentration is computer science because its related to information systems and make understanding work easier. If you like marketing as a minor then go for it.",

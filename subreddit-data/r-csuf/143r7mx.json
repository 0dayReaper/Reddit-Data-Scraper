    "postText": "I'm an incoming transfer student majoring in computer science and I have some questions about registration. \n\nI've received an email this week stating that registration begins on June 9th and that I can see my specific time on the student portal. However, on the portal, the \"Enrollment Appointments\" tab under \"Manage Classes\" is missing.\n\nWill I have to wait until orientation to register? Also, do I have to meet with an academic advisor prior to orientation so I can get help with building my schedule or will that all be done in orientation?",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nSo for Fall 2023 I am enrolled in ACCT 201B (or Managerial Accounting), but I am also planning to take the same course during summer, which starts on June 20th to August 18th. \n\nWould it be a better idea to unenroll in the class if I'm already taking it this summer or stay in it until I finish and transfer the units from CC to here? \n\nThanks!",

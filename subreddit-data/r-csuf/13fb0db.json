    "postText": "My inital plan was to take a summer class at Fullerton/Cypress Community and transfer the credits over since I heard that it's cheaper to take classes at a community, but the only class option for the class I need is in-person (which I can't do). CSUF has the same class option open for fully online so I'm thinking about just taking it through CSUF instead but I'm not sure how much more expensive it is and if it's worth it. Does anyone know how much summer classes cost?",

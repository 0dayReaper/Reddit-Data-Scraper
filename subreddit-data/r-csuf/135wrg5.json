Although both departments might be equally unreachable at times. Maybe go directly to their service center in between your classes and be sure to have you have the number for the ticket you opened as reference then ask about it. Either they can address it, or it might need to be reviewed and initiated from the advising side. Good luck.",

If you need to talk to someone about your TDA, go to Registration and Records in person (first floor of Langsdorf) and let them know your problem. They can help!",

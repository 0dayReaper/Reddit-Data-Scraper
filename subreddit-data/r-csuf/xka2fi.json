Damn truck was essentially blocking an entire side (about a car link outside of the parking lines), which meant cars had to drive on the wrong side of the road. I by no means think a truck that giant is necessary, but it\u2019s not my truck so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Objectively, the issue here is that this person made a decision that was at the expense of other people, requiring unsafe and dangerous driving. If you have a truck that big, fine. But don\u2019t go compromising people\u2019s safety, especially when they were there early enough (prior to 9:30 with hundreds of spots open) to choose a spot that doesn\u2019t endanger others. Stop being selfish, careless, and maybe show that you actually care about people\u2019s lives.",

My truck wasn't this long but one time my truck stood out a bit and someone scraped the entire front bumber including riping apart my front license plate (I would park reversing in Nutwood). I felt more bad about their car because there was body parts all over and the steel front bumber only received a scratch. \n\nNow when its a crew cab (4-door) and a long bed, you just playing nasty.",

Also, regardless of if that is the story (which in itself is a judgement call, just not a negative one) it doesn\u2019t give the person the right to endanger people\u2019s safety. If the guy was parked like that sticking out into a street, it would be illegal and a ticketed offense at minimum.",

I\u2019d continue responding, but it seems like you\u2019re going to continue to cherry pick which parts you think you can refute and ignore the parts where you may have come up short. Good luck parking your truck next time tho!",

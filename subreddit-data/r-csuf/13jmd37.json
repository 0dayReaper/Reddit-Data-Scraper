    "postText": "In the past three weeks, primarily on Wednesdays and Saturdays, we received nine reports regarding vehicle burglaries and vandalism which occurred mostly in the Nutwood and Eastside parking structures and parking lot G between 8 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe suspect(s) shattered the driver or passenger side windows of the vehicles and removed electronics and personal items which were unsecured inside. \n\nWe have increased vehicle, bike, and foot patrols and are reviewing security camera footage in these areas. Please do not leave any valuable items in plain sight when leaving your vehicle. Additionally, if your vehicle contains an alarm system, please ensure it is activated before walking away.  \n\nIf you witnessed any of these crimes or have additional information, please contact CSUF Police Investigations at (657) 278-2903. If you see something, say something, and call our 24-hour non-emergency number at (657) 278-2515.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kmxorcifa0b1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=82e9df939e4934de290de8a2496cecf16996e9a8",

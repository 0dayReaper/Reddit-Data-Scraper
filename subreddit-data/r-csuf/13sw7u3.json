    "postText": "\nHi everyone! \n\nI'm a dental hygienist student at Concorde College and I'm looking for patients who has not have a dental cleaning for awhile to practice on for my clinic requirements. As part of my education, I'm required to complete a certain number of hands-on patient treatments, and I need your help to meet this requirement. \nI'm offering cleanings and exams to anyone who is interested for $20 ($200+ value at private dental offices). \nThese services will be performed under the supervision of a licensed dental hygienist and a dentist, so you can trust that you'll receive quality care.\nIf you or someone you know is in need of a dental cleaning or exam, please let me know! I'm available on Mondays, Wednesday and some Fridays \nThank you for reading!",

That little car had already passed that parking spot and reasonably should not have backed up or expected anyone else to back up and give them room. We know there\u2019s definitely a spatial awareness issue 1). Because your small car passed the parking spot and 2). You literally hit a parked car backing up. \n\nI\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t hit the Honda and even more shocked the driver seemed confused as to why there was a parked car that impeded his parking. \n\nYou literally backed into a parked car\u2026.. I just can\u2019t!! Lol",

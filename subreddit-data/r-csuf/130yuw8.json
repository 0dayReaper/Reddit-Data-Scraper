    "postText": "Hey guys so I\u2019m a senior graduating this year and I haven\u2019t done much on campus. I\u2019m a commuter from LA so I never had much time to explore or do fun things. Now that I\u2019m leaving in a few weeks I want to do some fun stuff before finals come around. So far I have:\n-visit the arboretum\n-try aloha java\n-go bowling in the TSU\n\nIf you guys have any other suggestions please let me know!",

I met some other students sitting near me, and the whole theater was laughing the entire night. You don\u2019t necessarily have to do that, but maybe check out some events that ASI hosts. Also, congrats on graduating!",

    "postText": "So just found this out myself but this fall 2020 semester CSUF is automatically opting you IN for their online e-textbook rental service through the titan bookstore. That means, if you get the textbook elsewhere and you do NOT opt out by 9/8/20, you will be billed for the automatic opt in. So be sure to check your my.fullerton.edu account! \n\nI made sure to opt out since I rent all my books on Chegg because it\u2019s a bit cheaper and I don\u2019t really trust Vital Source since I\u2019ve never used it before! \n\nAnyways just wanted to let everyone here know in case they didn\u2019t already!\n\nEDIT:\nLogin to your my.fullerton.edu portal. On the first page before student center you should see a list of your classes with links below saying \u201cview course material\u201d once you click the link it should lead you to the vital source website. If you\u2019re still opted-IN, it will have a green check mark. Please click opt-OUT. If successful you should receive an email confirming that you opted-OUT. You will need to do this for EACH textbook for EACH class.\n\nHope this helps!!",

There is \u201clecture\u201d and hrw on canvas but honestly showing up to class was enough for me to pass the weekly quizzes. If it\u2019s with Rebert I highly suggest. Only thing is with activity based classes (like running, swimming, yoga\u2026) attendance is mandatory (there\u2019s make ups but plan to be there or else no credit.",

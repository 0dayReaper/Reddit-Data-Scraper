I can't imagine CAD or other engineering software. \n\nAny laptop with 16+ gb of ram and a newer processor should do. I would suggest sticking with a windows operating system for compatibility sake.\n\nAnyone correct me if I'm wrong. \n\n(Alumni Engineer)",

I've had a MacBook Pro for physics research and math research. Don't know too much about laptops but I don't think you need anything fancy.\n\nEdit: 16 GBS of ram is nice. Storage matters but CSUF also gives you Dropbox.",

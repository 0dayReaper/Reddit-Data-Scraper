    "postText": "1st semester I bought a parking permit. The 2nd semester I decided to yolo it and not buy one. I managed to make it to almost the end of the semester without getting a ticket until now (I was convinced I found the secret parking area and time lol). 80$ and like 4 weeks in the semestee left\ud83d\ude2d.  If somehow I get another ticket after paying this one,  will it be even more or the same price?",

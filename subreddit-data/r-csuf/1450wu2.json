The place has to be approved for KNES 495 so I\u2019m not sure if all health care jobs count. Also, I did have to complete 120 hours before the end of semester. My Professor allowed us to count class hours as part of our hour sheet so that we could finish our hours. The place has to sign off your hours so make sure you get 120 hours done \u00a8\u032e",

            "comment": "I just called a bunch of PT clinics and asked if they were taking any interns. The big thing is no volunteer work. The professor is very specific about that. If your place of interest tells you they\u2019re accepting volunteers, then you have to keep looking. There also some leeway for getting the internship approved. It doesn\u2019t have to be by the first day, but you should get it approved within the first two weeks of school",

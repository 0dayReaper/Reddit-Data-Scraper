    "postText": "After my first full year going here I regret going to this school. Everyone keeps to themselves and no one is approachable at all everyone looks mean or extremely busy. It\u2019s hard to make actual friendships here. There\u2019s 0 school spirit at all it\u2019s practically a damn community college with more expensive tuition. It makes it even worse I got accepted to SDSU and I chose this shit ass school only reason I chose it is because I moved into a house with friends near here. Not only that the professor I got last semester for business calculus was horrible and I failed it so I got set behind a semester.",

Do you only talk to your friend house group? Maybe that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t met anyone new. So I suggest talking to people instead of waiting for them to talk to you. Out with the old and in with the new.\n4. Always aim higher with your education if you have the opportunity. Don\u2019t settle for less because you\u2019ll find friends anywhere if you genuinely try.\n5. Consider transferring if you don\u2019t like it here. Still very possible to do. I transferred into CSUF alone from another CSU. I personally like it here a lot more and I still made friends!",

It sounds like you had a choice so you should have thought out your decision. It\u2019s very well known it\u2019s a commuter school that doesn\u2019t have a party scene. You have to join clubs to really create friendships. However, it\u2019s still a reputable and well respected school to attend. Everyone looks extremely busy because they are trying to pass their classes and get their degree. If you only care about making friends and partying I would transfer.",

I honestly understand and get it because I also struggled when I first transferred here the beginning of this school year. I was shy and it was hard making friends at first. But for me joining clubs and kind of in class like group work helped me make some friends. While I still don\u2019t have too many friends at Csuf I\u2019m confident I can make more next year. What I\u2019ve learn is you have to find clubs or organizations you like on campus. It is a commuter school which I know the vibe and community but it\u2019s honestly not to bad of a school. It all depends what a person is looking for also like if you like the party scene then maybe another university would be best for what you want. Me I just wanted to get into a university in the end after transferring from community college. I\u2019m originally from the Bay Area. Another thing that helps me make friends down here in So Cal besides in school is working and also volunteering. But like I tell myself in the end I\u2019m here for one thing which is achieving my goals and dreams of getting a degree and living that college life. \n\nAlso I know it\u2019s hard finding nice cool people you can vibe with. Cause there are a lot of rude, immature, and fake people out there. But they are out there. Just have to find them.",

It was unnecessary stress and anxiety being recorded on zoom. She kept alerting me to turn on my camera and mic. Im just trying to take the fucking exam and be done with my day. On top of that, she made the exam so much harder because of online transition. I got an 90 on my first exam in person but got a 77 on proctored exam on zoom. If I could get a good grade without internet access or cheating, then just let us be. Thankfully she curved. We already have enough stress from everything else. No financial support and our resources are limited. UGHHH",

This semester I had my gallbladder removed and it was a rough surgery, and last Spring semester, I had an ectopic pregnancy that required emergency surgery. This semester, I missed  two quizzes (1 each in 2 of my classes), and despite me providing paperwork and explaining my situation, my professors basically told me it was MY fault and that I should have done better planning.",

My dad was hospitalized this week, and it\u2019s been tough as is transition from in-person to online because of COVID. Yet, my professor made me get a written letter from the hospital to show proof that my dad was actually in there. It\u2019s sad that some teachers are actually like this.

I hope you weren't this way with the DSS students.\n\nIn normal situations yes, you should be wary. But in a pandemic show some goddamn compassion. Coming from someone who is constantly surrounded by people who are: going into the medical field, in the medical field, immunocompromised, 'essential workers' and etc.\n\nWhy is, 'may i have extra time because this pandemic is literally making me wonder how I will live in the summer months' a not legitimate enough reason to allow some leeway?",

In my experience, professors are simply opting to record lectures and then call it a wrap for the rest of the week. Out of 6 classes I\u2019m currently taking, only two are live zoom lectures. If I have any questions? That\u2019s my problem and I have to go to their revised office hours of their own choosing that may be inconvenient to many, who knows. \n\nI think what most students are wanting to see is leniency in one form or the other. They(professors) expect us to give it our 100% yet for *some*, we don\u2019t see that effort being put in by the professors. \n\nSo your anecdote there definitely applies to 99%+ of the time but here we are during an unforeseen pandemic, which I would put under that 1%",

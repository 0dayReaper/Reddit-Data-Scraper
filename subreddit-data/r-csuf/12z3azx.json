    "postText": "If you're an upcoming computer science student who's okay with taking 90% of the work yourself, then boy have I got the college for you.\n\nIf you're debating whether, or not, you should attend CSU Fullerton as a Computer Science student, I would avoid it like the plague - if you can help it.\n\nMy grandparents died. I have sooo many exams this week. I have two jobs. My girlfriend/boyfriend broke up with me. I'm just not feeling well. I have anxiety. I've been busy.\n\nGod help you if you're assigned to a group project with these kids. Nearly every project assigned to me, me and one other person, or me alone, have had to take on the workload for the group project while the rest of my colleagues have excuse after excuse for why they're not doing their allotted tasks. It's absolutely pathetic. And the professors don't give a single shit. They're just looking to pass as many kids as they can to get their next paycheck. Christ.\n\nI am in two group projects (with a combined total of 8 students) where 5 students haven't put any effort into their work. One student has been at this college for years as a CS student and had no experience coding at all. His words to me as I told him why he wasn't able to do his part: \"I just do the minimal amount of work to get a passing grade.\"\n\nHalf of me is frustrated that I'm forced to work with these free-loading assholes and half of me is delighted to see these are the people I'm competing with during the job search. I'm looking forward to cutting each and every one of these students out of my Github Repository once the project is over. Fuck this program.\n\nSorry for the rant. I'm letting off some steam before I finish up these projects.",

What are you even trying to argue? Not, in a million years, will a competent lead *blame* you for your coworker's laziness. That doesn't happen. Ever. I don't know how I can get that across to you.\n\nSure, maybe in a terribly-led project, you might be held accountable for whatever, but that's just a product of bad management. Just like how the college's accountability system is a product of bad management.\n\nYour second argument is objectively false. Being a project manager can absolutely be a technical role. I've been a Project Manager and a Software Developer myself.\n\nRole titles are just about meaningless and nobody will know what your actual responsibilities are unless you specifically state them. I said Project Manager, as an example, but if that hurts your head, then you can pretend I said Software Developer Lead, or whatever.\n\nWhether or not we agree on the definition of a Project Manager does not take away from my initial point. \n\nIf a coworker does not do their work in their allotted time, then you have a proper paper trail, whether it's through standups, Slack, story points, or whatever to get them promptly removed. There is a proper history of certain tasks not being done, and sure, you will be required to do them, or the tasks will be offloaded to the rest of the group, but you *will not be financially punished* for such a situation. \n\nThat does not exist in CSUF. If a group member does not do their work. There is little to no accountability for lazy group members in CSUF, because *professors. don't. care.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And if incompetent workers are placed on projects you lead, they are your and your managers headache until they get fired \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nUntil they get what?

I can bet you all those people who downvoted your responses are either CSUF dick riders or the very kind of students that youre complaining about. \n\nI lost my dad in the midst of finishing my last year of college and graduating and im still doing more work than most of these students in my classes. I went through something traumatic yet I\u2019m still studying my ass of and trying to get As in all of my courses. Ive been here long enough to realize all the CSUF cs kids do the bare minimum to pass and they get booty tickled if you snap on them for not being great partners. Ive been high strung on stress for the past year and a half between my fathers diagnosis and his actual passing so I was a little snappier than I used to be, I was sick of putting up with shitty partners and I went off on my group of 7 yelling at them that I was the only female, I was dealing with a sick dad, yet I was the only one doing anything for the project. My group ended up getting more into shape after hearing everything I was going through but it shouldn\u2019t had to have been that way.\n\nI made a post last semester about how a shitty professor at the school tried to make me come in after testing positive with covid and showing symptoms and a bunch of CSUF dick riders tried to get my post taken down because they refused to believe that there are people who attend this school and genuinely hate the department so much. \n\nI\u2019m someone who deals with personal mental health issues and all I can say is that my depression and anxiety has gotten severely worse ever since attending this school and my patience for the students I go to school with has run so thin. Many of them act like children and a lot of the times before a class starts, I feel like some of my professors have had to calm down these rowdy kids like they\u2019re a bunch of toddlers. Im also just venting at this point but I cant stress enough how excited I am to never come back to this school ever again after I graduate next month.",

            "comment": "This is pretty accurate based on my experience. I'm also graduating this semester - the worst experiences I've had with groups weren't with coding projects, but group homework. Our professor let's us form groups of 5 and it's been actually harder to do the homework as a group than as an individual. Basically we just divide up the questions, but my group basically half-assed the questions which leaves me having to clean their shit up. In the end, it's basically me proof reading everything and effectively doing the entire assignment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike anything else, it's best to avoid grouping up with randoms and figure out who will make a good groupmate",

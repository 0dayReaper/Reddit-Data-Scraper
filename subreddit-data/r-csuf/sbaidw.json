I don\u2019t want to be on campus either. It\u2019s nice not having to worry about getting covid. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy that people think being both an in person prof and online prof is no big deal. It\u2019s a massive amount of work to keep up with both. Professors shouldn\u2019t provide these types of accommodations because then students expect this to always be an option. If I have to show up so should the student. If students get the option to stay home for fear of getting covid then so should I. OR If teaching online AND in person is expected then I should get a massive pay raise.",

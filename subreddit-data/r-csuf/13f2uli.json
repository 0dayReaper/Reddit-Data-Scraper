By the time I called by husband and confirmed we could attend (about 2:50), filled out the RSVP, all of the \"slots\" were gone. \n\n1. why would you not put this event has a limited amount of event space?\n2. why would you not take into consideration the volume of TAPP eligible students on this campus? \n\nI am so unbelievably disappointed. I was excited to attend and now they want to \"raffle off\" a stool and pin for those who the RSVP closed on. \n\nGreat way to end the semester.",

First, I want to say thank you for all the feedback regarding our end of the year event selling out so quickly. You all are exactly right. That was my mistake. I underestimated the response for this event.  I apologize for that. We are a brand new program and this is the first end-of-the-year celebration that we have hosted, and we were honestly surprised that there was so much interest. We have sent out a lot of invites over the last year to the same student group and did not receive anything close to this level of response. Our events average about 150-200 people, so we based our plan on that. \n\nI am sorry lot of our transfer students were let down and disappointed. That is on me. I accept full responsibility for that. No excuses. We have a small staff and they work their tails off every day to support our transfer, adult, parenting, and pregnant students, so we do hope that you do not let this one mistake define the TAPP Center. One thing I can guarantee you is that this will not happen again in the future. We will learn and grow from your responses and feedback. We will be much more prepared for next year's event. We now know that we need to plan BIG!  We realize that does not help this year's graduates, so we encourage you to stop by Gordon Hall 205 to meet the team in person and we can see if there is anything we can do to assist you. We are here for you, despite this oversight. Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Thank you for your time patience and consideration.",

Hopefully, next year all that want to join can. I suggest getting something to offer for all TAPP students to wear on their grad day, not just a raffle or attendance at the event. Sometimes minute details mean a lot.",

I was excited to attend and now they want to \"raffle off\" a stool and pin for those who the RSVP closed on.Great way to end the semester.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;37 commentssharesave\n\nHAHA youre so right!

I have a feeling that a lot of the people complaining here have never bothered to step foot in the actual center. \n\nHad you gone to the TAPP center, you would have found a small group of people trying their best to make our experiences great. I have gone in for free coffee and snacks numerous times. They have provided me with free class materials, like scantrons and blue books and they have referred me to some great resources on campus. \n\nI have attended several of their events and always felt welcome. Some events were kid-friendly, and some were just for students, but I enjoyed them all. As an adult returning transfer student, I can't recommend them enough. \n\nDon't let the complaints of people who ignored the center all year shape your opinion. If everyone upset about not getting into the event showed up for other events throughout the year, they probably would have known to expect more people. Apathy has a price. In this case, the price is missing out on an event that nobody expected you to (finally) care about.",

I also work a full-time job, and a part-time job while going to school. There is no way they or any other group can offer events that everyone can fit into their schedule. It's a big school.",

I appreciate the TAPP graduation celebration event, but I feel that the school offers so many other graduation celebrations to attend to because I was also apart of other programs or organizations throughout my years here. Finding community in school is important, but only relying on the TAPP center is not the answer especially if students were not regularly attending their events. I did walk-in and check the social media a few times throughout the semester to see what was offered and if I could attend. The text message reminders help, but I was already busy with the other organizations and my classes I was committed to. Not to mention my life as a non-traditional student who is a parent, working part-time, and living on my own.",

As a undergrad not taking summer courses, this feels like a good moment to take the leap, but am worried the 5 month request is too heavy as it will interfere with the Fall semester.",

You will need to catch up with your cohort because certain courses can only be offered in certain order and semester. I would suggest you to connect with the program advisor. They are absolutely helpful and will tell you what is realistic :)",

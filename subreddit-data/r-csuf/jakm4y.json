I appreciate the fact that our instructors had to convert to online instruction under an impossible timeline, but there have to be other alternatives. \n\nI honestly don't think the university itself will walk back the purchase. It's likely they contracted with Proctorio for multiple years and someone has to vehemently justify that this was a \"valid\" expense.",

Proctorio is yet another thing we need to learn and handle amongst the many OTHER things we have had to adjust to while switching to online classes, Zoom, time management, Canvas, etc. \n\nWe want less stress, proctorio adds to the stress that we already have to deal with, as it is invasive and there are fears and accounts of people being failed or losing points on exams unreasonably and unfairly because of the nature of Proctorio. \n\nEverything from having to keep the camera on, not allowing us to get up, look around, or even have other people in the room while being constantly recorded is invasive and unreasonable, especially for college students.",

Even Zoom was invasive as fuck and people knew this but didn\u2019t really care much.\n\nWe lost much of our privacy a long time ago.

I opted out of using proctorio and just went with canvas classic quizzes, because F proctorio I don't want it on my computer either. The average score for my midterms was a C. That is the same as in person. Last spring and summer when we were on titanium, the average was a C on every exam.   \n\nBesides that there are other ways to curve cheating. Have each test be 1-1.5 minute per questions doesn't give students enough time to look EVERY question up. If you rewrite your questions, to be more analogy based that makes them unGoogleable. There's no need for proctorio.",

I don't feel compelled to cheat on tests but I will fail any test that requires me to use proctorio because I will downright refuse to put it on my computer.  Privacy concerns are more important than ever and we should be more concerned about that than we should be about someone that feels they need to cheat on an exam.  At some point they will have to apply the knowledge they learned in school and when the rubber meets the road, that is where it matters.",

But \u201cprotect our privacy\u201d sounds a lot better than \u201clet us cheat.\u201d \n\nOf course there are alternatives. Of course Proctorio is not the only solution.

There's a huge amount of people who are against proctorio because of anxiety issues. Especially in cases where Proctorio use is exessive students are having major test anxiety over failing for silly things. It also disproportionately affects students who rent, share spaces, etc. Students that are low SES. Sure I could also be underestimating, but based of of what I've heard from various professors who teach at CSUF and CCs, the grades weren't largely skewed if at all. That's a survey of over 200+ students.\n\nI mean your point is that students just want to cheat again. This all ties in to your point where cheating is less of an issue than all of the issues I brought up. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Again, in my experience and talking with professors and their students it seemed that that was not a huge issue at all. If there was a lot of cheating then it backfired on them because the averages were just the same. At least for our 200+ students, cheating wasn't a huge problem. For us it doesn't warrent using Proctorio. We are all more concerned with what it will do for student anxiety and how it is invasive. \n\nAgain, I never stated that you negated these factors, but putting them all on the table I do think that students and professors alike are considering the cons of using Proctorio bigger than the pro of using it to curve cheating. That's all really, I wasn't necessarily arguing a point simply stating what I've seen/experienced.",

Classes are required to have C average and that was still being met without Proctorio, meaning that even if students ARE cheating, it doesn't matter. The grade averages are staying the same. \n\nStudents didn't care AS much about Zoom because there was little option to use otherwise. We literally don't need Proctorio. Look at the article, the CEO literally says, \"Whether they\u2019re cheating or not, I don\u2019t really care\".   \n\n\nProfessors are failing students for shifty eye movement because they're nervous. There shouldn't ever be anything added to testing to make students even more nervous. Especially terrible for those with anxiety. The professors who use it provide no alternative. Students get told to drop the class. I shouldn't have to put my education on hold because a professor is so worried students are going to cheat.",

You\u2019re taking my statement beyond what I said by innacurately paraphrasing and then claiming that it\u2019s \u201ckinda\u201d what I said. For example, when did I use the word \u201cbigger\u201d? That completely changes my argument because it implies majority. However, I didn\u2019t use that word for a reason. Again:\n\n&gt; Keep in mind, \u201csignificant portion\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cmajority.\u201d If 10% of the American population got COVID, I\u2019d call that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d even though it isn\u2019t a majority.\n\nSo my statement \u201ca significant portion of you guys are just mad that you can\u2019t cheat,\u201d is not mutually exclusive to claims that more people may have other reasons for opposing Proctorio because it does not imply majority.",

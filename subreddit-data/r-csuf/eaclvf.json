Sorry for any confusion.** \n\nWith FullertonGrades, you can see grade distribution information for over 8,000 classes, including which instructor taught which course. All undergraduate departments and courses from the Fall and Spring semesters of 2018-2019 should be included.\n\nThere are no paywalls, just a simple design: choose a department (and optionally a course number), and click on the desired course.\n\nThere were quite a few challenges in making this website, from getting the data from CSU Fullerton to dealing with the sheer amount of data, but all in all I think it could serve as a very useful resource in determining which classes to enroll in and with what instructor, especially for those weed-out classes and for pre-med folks.\n\nLet me know what you think, and contact me if you find any issues - thanks!",

A class I\u2019m in right now showed no one got As last semester which I find crazy, since multiple people I know have over a 100 going into the final. \n\nInterested in knowing if it was a change in teaching style, poor performing class, etc. \n\nWebsite is super cool tho!!!! Good job I\u2019m sure that was no easy feat!",

When I try to place ads Google Adsense auto-rejects the websites with the message: \n\n# Your site isn\u2019t ready to show ads\n\nWe\u2019ve found some policy violations on your site which means your site isn\u2019t ready to show ads yet.\n\n1. **Valuable Inventory: No content**  \nAs stated in our Program policies, we may not show Google ads on pages or apps with little to no value and/or excessive advertising until changes are made. This includes hosted ad pages or pages or apps without content.  \n \n\nIt's honestly kind of a burn by Google. : (",

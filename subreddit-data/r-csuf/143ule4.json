Also, is it double or triple rooms? Was it a positive experience for you? I\u2019m hoping for the best, but don\u2019t know what to expect so anything would help!",

Mostly the dorms are set up with triple rooms in different places not a floor of just triple rooms. The experience was positive. Everyone was really kind and accepting!",

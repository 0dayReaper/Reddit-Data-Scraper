    "postText": "This is gonna sound a little ridiculous but seeing all the posts about graduation and how little prep is involved kinda made me nervous for mine, even though it\u2019s next spring lol. So I was wondering where they usually hold graduation? I know it depends on your college and major, but I wanted to get a sense of it cause I\u2019m so paranoid about accidentally missing mine lmao. Plus, I don\u2019t spend much time on campus like that to know where most things are located besides the library and TSU. Any answers to this would be cool hahahaha",

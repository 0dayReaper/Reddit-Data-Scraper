    "postText": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m currently a Studio Arts transfer student and I\u2019m about to finish up my first semester. I spent this semester mostly on required upper division general education since I haven\u2019t been able to submit a portfolio yet for both programs I\u2019m trying to get into: Entertainment Art/Animation &amp; Game Art. I\u2019m still not very confident in my work since I\u2019m not very used to digital drawing and still struggle with realism, shading, and lighting, but I really want to improve! As a result, I was wondering what clubs and/or resources will help me in this path? I\u2019ve heard of the Pencil Mileage Club and will definitely be joining that because I hear that they help with portfolio reviews! Are there any other clubs or resources I should look into as someone interested in animation? I also really like video games and have thought about animating for video games, but I was also wondering if the Game Art major focuses more on programming than art? (I\u2019m pretty worried about this as someone not very good at math.) This is also a reason why I\u2019m hesitant about joining a club like the Video Game Development Club. I would appreciate your advise and thank you so much for reading!",

            "comment": "Hello, I'm one of the officers from the VGDC. I'm studying computer science, so I can't really give you concrete advice about your major. However, I looked through the school catalog, and I only count two math class requirements for the entire major (most likely low-level). Definitely talk to your advisor about your concerns, tho. That said, our club has people from all disciplines, including art, animation, writing, music, programming, etc. You can ask questions or show your work there, I'm sure someone will pick it up. We are very casual but well organized. There are absolutely no requirements to join or stay. Let me know if you want to check it out, I will send you the link.",

    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a pre business freshman that it starting to enroll in classes for my sophomore fall 2023. I plan to be an accounting major with joint emphasis in finance. I was wondering if we have to take ACCT 201A and ACCT 201B in order of A to B. I waited two days to register and the professors left for 201A are eeeeehh. May I take 201B this semester and 201A next semester and be okay. Thank you!",

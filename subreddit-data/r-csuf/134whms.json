    "postText": "Hey titans ~ I am going to the spring concert this Saturday &amp; was wondering if anyone has been before. What\u2019s it like? ASI doesn\u2019t provide much information besides the artists. Is there activities, other things to do? Is there food and drinks? Is there alcohol sold/allowed? Can I smoke? What\u2019s security like? \n\nThanksssss much appreciated\n\nEDIT: just an update for anyone reading this in the future. There were no rides, but some games to play. There were photo booths and a bracelet making table. Free stickers and pins. Apparently shirts too but I got there an hr after it started and did not see any shirts. There\u2019s really no sneaking stuff in. I had a very small bag with a vape and gummies but no one\u2019s really dug through it, just peaked in. They metal detect ur body as well. No smoking allowed or vaping. Maybe could get away with smoking in the crowd. I did see people vaping later in the evening and in the crowd. Tons of security and no alcohol policy either, lots of people turned away. There is no in and outs either.",

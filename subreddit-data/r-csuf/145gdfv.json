    "postText": "Hey titans, I\u2019m a transfer student for this fall. My enrollment date was 10:30 today but I get error messages saying that I haven\u2019t completed the prerequisites or any GE courses. I called the office of admissions and they told me to send an email to see if my TDA can be updated. The automated response says it\u2019ll take up to three business days for a response. I\u2019m really worried that I basically won\u2019t get any classes that I need since the majority are already full. Anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it?\n\nEDIT (PROBLEM SOLVED): I got a response back from admissions and they were able to update my TDA on all GE requirements so I was able to enroll in classes a few hours later. For anyone else having the same problem, either email tda@fullerton.edu about your issue or ask for a permit through your major department as others below have stated. Thanks to everyone that chimed in!",

It really depends on the department though. I am still waiting on one to grant me a permit. It's so frustrating... Hopefully I'll be able to get in the class before it fills up!",

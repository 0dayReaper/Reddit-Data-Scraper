If you like the research programs of the profs at CSUF better then UCI, then make the choice. UCs aren\u2019t by default better than CSUs for any particular individual case.",

However, the psych department is highly expected at CSUF and you might not even have that 1-1 time anyway? Overall, I would also say UCI based on the things i have heard about the psych department at CSUF.",

I\u2019m sure there is one that would pique your interest! But again it really just depends on what you want to do to. If you want research do UCI, I\u2019m actually graduating this June and starting a masters program at CSUF.",

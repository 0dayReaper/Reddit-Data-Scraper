Attendance matters and a big part of your grade. Final exam is just a paper. Theres also 5-6 page paper that he makes you write based on in-class documentaries that you watch in-class a couple times throughout the semester.\n\nJust don\u2019t skip class and do good on those papers and should be an easy A",

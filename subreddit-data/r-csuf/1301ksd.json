They \u201clost\u201d my transcript three times and put a hold on my account. When I finally went in person to confront them, the girl at the office clearly opened my transcript and told me \u201coh we just processed it right now,\u201d and that I would need to wait a few business days before my hold was removed. I\u2019ve called them every single day for HOURS with no response and sent in digital messages. A few days have passed now and my hold still hasn\u2019t been lifted and all of my classes are now full and only have waitlisted options due to their laziness. What should I do?",

I got dropped from several classes my first semester and almost lost financial aid had some professors in my department had not been willing to advocate for me. We investigated it, went to the post office we sent my transcripts from, and they found that my transcripts HAD BEEN SIGNED FOR AT THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE. When we showed photo proof from the admissions office to them, they just shrugged at me",

Im having a hard time getting in contact with the admissions office, specifically the people in charge of the TDA. I tried calling last week multiple times and this week  about an issue with my TDA, they did not answer and reached  to the tda email and submitted an online form help desk, no response. Do you recommend going in person? Do I have to make an appointment or walks in are okay?",

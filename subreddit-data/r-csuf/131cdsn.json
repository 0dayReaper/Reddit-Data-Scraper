I think its cus we take our quizzes on our computers so sometimes there were people who werent prepared. \n\nHonestly no cons, shes super chill, her powerpoints are straight forward. \n\nHer quizzes reflect back on her powerpoints and she posts all of them. \n\nShe gives out extra credit when you answer and participate. \n\n3 summary papers, but she gives you a guideline on how she wants it done.",

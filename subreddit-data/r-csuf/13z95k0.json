            "comment": "hi! i took regular calculus in high school and got an 86 on the aleks placement test, which put me in math 150A (calculus 1) for the fall 2022 semester. \n\nfrom what i vaguely remember, i believe that if you don\u2019t perform well on the placement test you\u2019ll be placed in math 115 and 125 instead of math 150a for the fall 2023 semester no matter what. i\u2019m not sure if it varies between departments, but this is coming from me as a CEE major.\n\ni mainly remember thinking that doing calculus in high school was essentially pointless if i was just going to take a math placement test anyways. regardless, it\u2019s definitely still a good idea to take precalc beforehand to prepare. \n\ni think you should call or email the math department if you need a definitive answer. \nhope this is somewhat helpful! ^^",

                    "comment": "^ it's usually better to overprepare than underprepare. There's a generous threshold to which you would need to score on ALEKS before being placed in Math 150A (Calculus I) assuming you pass. If you choose to not take the ALEKS at all or end up failing, you'll be placed in either College Algebra or Pre Calculus, depending on the credits that are allowed to be transferred from your hs/cc transcript. \n\nI would recommend emailing the point of contact from the email you've received or anyone related to the placement exams regarding ALEKS to see where you would best fit based on your situation. They're usually very quick with replying. Tho if you have already taken Calculus I and II with passing grades/successful AP exam scores, you may not need to take ALEKS at all (speaking from experience).",

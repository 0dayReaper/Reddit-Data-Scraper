    "postText": "Hello Everyone! \n\nCongrats to those who are graduating during this time. As final grades are being inputted I noticed that I received a C in a class that I was almost 99% certain I was going to receive a B in. I am not really sure what went wrong. I emailed the professor several times and it does not seem like he wants to budge. I want to petition the grade but does anyone know what the chances are of getting it approved?  It seems like they almost NEVER get approved. I don't know who else to contact or what to do. I understand that a C is passing but I can not afford for my gpa to drop any lower.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

For example, the light turns green but it's so backed up that the drivers that have the green won't be able to fit and complete the turn. It's obvious they won't fit, they probably know they won't fit, but they do it anyway and then the line of cars that has the straight gets screwed over because the people turning just don't have common driving sense.",

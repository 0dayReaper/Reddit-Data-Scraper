What types of social features would enhance your experience when watching game streams?\n2. What factors or criteria do you consider when deciding which streaming games to explore?\n3. What are your primary expectations when it comes to streaming games? What do you hope to get out of the experience?\n4. Are there specific platforms or websites you turn to for discovering and exploring new streaming games? If so, which ones and why?\n5. Are there any specific challenges or frustrations you've encountered while using existing streaming feature gaming apps? How would you like to see them addressed?",

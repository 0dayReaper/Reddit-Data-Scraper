The goal is to get back up to a 2 something GPA wise.\n\nYou can always go to community college and take care of some GEs and then get reinstated the next year! \n\nI was academically disqualified from a different university when I was 19. Had developed anxiety and depression and it ruined my grades, but I didn\u2019t know what was wrong. Now I\u2019m 24, and I have two semesters left in my program! You\u2019ll be just fine! Take some time to see what you can do to improve without beating yourself up.",

Try just working, see if you can maybe land an internship in your field. \n\nIt does suck to go through it, but it\u2019s not the end at all! Sometimes burnout is real. Working helps you stock up on some savings, and you\u2019ll get into a consistent routine. Then when you come back to school, maybe you\u2019ll have a better sense of what to do differently",

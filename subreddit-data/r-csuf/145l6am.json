Last I heard was that they were hiring during the summer to train right before/when the semester starts.  I would guess late June or early July.  Watch the [csuf career center titan connect](https://www.fullerton.edu/career/students/jobs-internships/index.php) for when the listing comes up.  \n\nBTW ASC (campus dept that runs the food services) hires us, not Starbucks, so the jobs will not be listed on starbucks hiring sites.",

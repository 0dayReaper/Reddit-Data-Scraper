I meet deadlines, unlike some of those professors.\n\nAlso, be mindful. Not everyone going to college is some fresh-out-of-HS teenager. Some people are adults... and adults are held to the same standards at their places of employment. Miss deadlines? Reprimanded. Do it more than a few times? Most likely fired.\n\nProfessors don't have any \"sPeShUler\" circumstances to teach at a college. My SIL is a professor and she's often insulted FOR me at the way some of my professors handle themselves.\n\nWhen it comes to grading, primary school teachers have it way WAY worse.",

They still need to complete their assignments on time to achieve the grades that they want. They need to figure out how to balance work and school.\n\nThis is not comparable to the hundreds of assignments and students a professor needs to deal with. If you think professors struggle now, imagine if students were allowed to turn things in late. This issue would be even more common. \n\nYes, professors should be on time. I don\u2019t disagree.

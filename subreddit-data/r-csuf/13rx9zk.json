Teach, research and practice. Could also potentially lead to associate Dean and Dean positions way down the road.\n\nI personally can't stand parts of academia, so I stopped after M.A. (non psych). If you really love it, doctorate is the best investment.",

Prior to this, I worked in academia, non-profit orgs and public health also as a Data Analyst.\n\nIf you really love data, MA is the way to go. I love the program and my cohort, especially 520T (seminar) classes :) still keep in touch with a few cohort friends and professors post-graduation. But I have heard MS has stronger cohort relationship.",

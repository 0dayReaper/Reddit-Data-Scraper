I have visited both campus and liked both of them but I'm more interested about the actual MSW program. Can anyone share their experience at CSUF/CSULB as an MSW student or share thoughts about CSUF/CSULB?",

It just depends on whether you want to drive far to one campus/family commitments, etc. I love Fullerton and the environment. I went to a different program here years ago. If you have friends, who are going to the program - even better bonus. Now if you went to CSUF as an undergrad, and got accepted to CSULB, I\u2019d live the experience to attend another school. \n\nI can assure you the staff and faculty at CSUF are great. They will help you out and be as supportive. Everyone has their bias\u2019s and whatnot. \n\nI can answer any other questions you may have.",

I currently live in LB and travel to Fullerton, which is kind of a drag. I feel that both programs are pretty similar in the sense of concentrations. However, I have had only positive experiences with the professors and made really good friends in the cohort. Both are commuter schools so it just depends where you\u2019d rather travel to.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m already a graduate student in the Accounting program here at Fullerton but I want to switch to a business analytics program. I know Fullerton has an MS Info Systems with a business analytics track but I\u2019ve been looking at CPP\u2019s MS Business Analytics program too. \n\nI\u2019ve always heard that Fullerton is the best choice for business, and for Accounting &amp; Finance ppl there\u2019s no doubt. But what about for IS / Analytics? \n\nI\u2019ve been told CPP is a good choice for tech oriented stuff like analytics but idk how their resources, clubs, job fairs, etc compare to Fullerton. Would it be worth it to stay at Fullerton for the resources? \n\nThoughts?",

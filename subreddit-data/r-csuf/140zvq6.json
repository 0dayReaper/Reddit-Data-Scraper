They did struggle in the class simply because they didn\u2019t have the same background of bio labs as the other students but they gained so much experience and skills :) .",

Also write down notes of anything she says during class since it\u2019s always on the quiz &amp; make sure you don\u2019t fall behind on your notebook since it\u2019s easy points. She is super friendly &amp; really cares about each person since it\u2019s such a small cohort.",

    "postText": "Hi - I am a transfer student for Fall 2023 and was wondering if anyone happens to know which week orientation will be? I know the website says June, but I am concerned because I will be out of town in the beginning of June. Do you know if there are multiple days offered? And is it in person only or do they offer virtual orientation? Also, I have heard that you register for your classes at orientation. Is this true? If so how does that work if you have virtual orientation? I'm getting worried it will fall on the dates while I am out. Sorry for all the questions and thanks in advance for any responses!",

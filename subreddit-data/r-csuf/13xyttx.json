    "postText": "So in spring of 2021 I had a medical emergency right before finals so I had to postpone the date. I procrastinated and didn\u2019t take the exam until right before the due date a year later. I finished the exam and the professor told me I got an A. She told me she was going to input my grade and I took her word for it and never checked; I knew I had an A in the class already. This semester I tried to sign up for a class and that\u2019s when I noticed the IC on my transcript so I reached out to the professor. I sent two emails and two text messages. When I didn\u2019t get a reply I emailed CSUF(admissions I think?) abt the issue and it\u2019s been weeks since then with no response. I\u2019m passive; I\u2019m scared that it\u2019ll turn into a hearsay issue and that I won\u2019t get credit for my grade. I know I should I have caught it earlier but I\u2019m in this predicament now and ANY advice would help.",

Until then, just make sure the rest of your schedule is as sound as can be. \n\npatience is the key, as response times can be very slow while school is out",

Do you have any emails/records of them saying that you got and A and they\u2019d enter the grade? \n\nI\u2019m in a similar situation of replacing an IC from spring 2021 with a grade and I had to have the department head sign off on things to change it. So maybe contact them, depending on the situation.",

Depending on the field, many professors aren\u2019t checking email much during the summer, but dept chairs are. Resolving this will most likely involve the chair anyway.\n\nIn addition, you can try contacting the dept of the class you\u2019re trying to register for &amp; see if they\u2019ll waive the pre-req in this case. Depends on the dept, but it could save you from the stress of trying to get in the class at the beginning of the semester.",

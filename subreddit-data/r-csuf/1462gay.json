    "postText": "hello, i\u2019m currently studying outside the US in a four year university. Note that i was a US california Residence. I was looking forward to transferring to CSUF. I have a total of 80 credit units so far and my major is computer engineering. Recently my GPA dropped to 2.8 because of a course that i received an F in and now i\u2019m repeating it, my expected grade for it is C+, so that should help in the gpa. I wanted to see if i have a chance in getting in CSUF as a transfer or not. Also, for the golden four courses i didnt finish all of them because my university doesn\u2019t offer them in my study plan so i am not sure about that. Is there a possibility i can take them once i transfer to CSUF or they need them before transferring. However, i was thinking of also switching majors to business and finance, it depends if i would lose a lot of my credit units if i changed majors.",

            "comment": "Computer engineering at CSUF was struggling with enrollment (unlike computer science which is very packed). It\u2019s why they combined with the electrical engineering department. So maybe you have a shot at getting in if you complete the golden 4. Might want to wait to apply until you\u2019ve taken those at your current school or at a community college.\n\nWarning though. I was at a four-year university abroad (one of the top ones in my country) before transferring to CSUF. I lost a lot of credits and had to fight to get some to apply to my degree. They did weird stuff like reduce some of my credits from 3 units to 2.5 units, so I had to retake a lot of basic GEs like BIOL 101. This was a long time ago. Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re better about it now but I would definitely recommend talking to an international advisor before committing because you might be facing a lot of lost credits and wasted time.",

Weekly quizzes, a couple discussion posts, and I think two or three scavenger hunt assignments. You basically just fill out a document asking for government roles and officials. Expect to spend a couple hours on those. No final or midterm. He doesn\u2019t take attendance but he\u2019s so funny and chill that I always showed up.",

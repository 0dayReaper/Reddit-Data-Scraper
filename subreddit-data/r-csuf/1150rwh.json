    "postText": "I\u2019ve said this before and i\u2019ll say to again, this is my last year here but god damn i am in love with the manager lady at carls on campus. I\u2019m not tryna be weird about it but I go there almost twice a day everyday on campus and she\u2019s mostly there for the most part. She always gives me my food and smiles so eventually my feelings grew for her. If she is married and her husband reads this i\u2019m sorry i didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve gone throughout my 4 years at the school frequently and every time she brought a smile to my face:). she make the best french toast sticks :)&lt;3",

I\u2019m also not working much so I will be trying to double major in Accounting and Information Systems. What are your recommendations?",

My friend whose gpa was around 2.9 got into Grant Thornton.\n\nI think business recruiters also know that UCR is on the lower tier of UCs and that CSUF is known for their business program. I talked with a guy who went to UCR for undergraduate and now CSUF for graduate business degree. He said the academics and student quality at UCR is about the same as CSUF, perhaps even a bit worse.",

They have far more resources and kinder professors. I feel like UCR\u2019s professors for gen Ed are mostly mean but since going to CSUF I have not encountered a professor that\u2019s nearly as mean as UCR\u2019s. I kind of feel like UCR has a superiority complex but everything is so much more chiller here at CSUF and my commute is also similar to yours and I think it\u2019s very much worth it",

    "postText": "ISDS 474 is a prerequisite to ISDS 477. However, I can\u2019t get into 474 the next Fall because the class is already closed. And if I want to graduate on time, I have to take ISDS 477 in Spring 2024. I don\u2019t see they offer it in the summer. Does that mean I have to take that one class in Fall 2024 and graduate in December? Or do they allow taking both together? Has anybody been in the same situation?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a kinesiology graduate student conducting thesis research at CSUF. My research focuses on the effects of a week-long keto diet on mood, body composition, and time to exhaustion in recreationally trained female runners. If you participate in this study you would get free and accurate body fat percentage testing and a direct measurement of your cardiovascular (aerobic) fitness that usually costs several hundreds of dollars to have done elsewhere. Please direct message me if you are interested and would like more information! Thanks for reading! \ud83d\ude0a",

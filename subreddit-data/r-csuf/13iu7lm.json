    "postText": "I had applied to MS CS for Fall 2023 but I haven't received my decision yet. I keep checking my personal email but haven't received any mails from them. However, I just realized I had missed an email from them in February regarding how to set up my CSUF portal account and CSUF email ID. So I have activated this portal and email ID today. \n\nWill I get my admission decision on my personal email or the CSUF student portal or the CSUF email?",

It was an asynchronous class, so you complete everything on your own time. I have the syllabus if you want to see it. Is it possible to send attachments through a private chat?",

I did take Sociology 303 (Statistics for the Social Sciences) with Takahito Tanaka, which covers Upper GE of Category B. I did take it as a hybrid course, but I do know that he offered an asynch course this semester. You are only responsible for 4/5 labs and homeworks. There are 2 exams that are incredibly easy because he does so many example problems before an exam. There is a paper, but you only have to do that if you do bad on one of the exams because it replaces an exam score. The lab and homework are easy as well because he uploads videos of him doing it and what you should specifically write about. He also offers a lot of extra credit opportunities if you need it. He also told us at the beginning of the semester that his class is specifically for students that are not confident with their math skills, if you are worried about potentially taking a math class. The best part is that you can finish his class early, which definitely came in clutch for me.",

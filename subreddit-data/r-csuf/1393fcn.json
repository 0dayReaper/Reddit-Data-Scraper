    "postText": "This might be a long shot but I bought a Grad Cap Remix for my graduation cap, but it looks dumb on me. They're non refundable and it was 30 dollars so I don't want it to go to waste. I think they're best suited for people with curly, coily, or braided hair. If you don't know what they are here's their tiktok (where I heard of it)\n\n[GradCapRemix (@gradcapremix) | TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@gradcapremix)\n\nThis might be useful for someone who doesn't like they way their cap looks on them!!!\n\nI can meet on campus!",

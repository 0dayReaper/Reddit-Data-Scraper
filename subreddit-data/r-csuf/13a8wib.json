There are also insta events that promote csuf parties prior to covid it was popping. But since Covid it kinda died down. Downtown Fullerton is a great place to find the fun party people. I wouldn\u2019t even count on the school itself to be party going. Just go to underground raves or festivals for better luck, more fun, and make connections",

Don\u2019t go to college for parties, it\u2019s a complete waste of time. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t have a little fun with your friends at school, but your future and grades are on the line. A way people connect is through clubs and maybe through the gym.",

    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI wanted to ask if anyone here currently works or used to work for Disneyland? I applied to Disneyland for attractions on Tuesday 5/2 and then got an email to take a web based interview test on Wednesday 5/3. Im now scheduled for a zoom interview next Thursday 5/11. I wanted to ask what questions do they ask for interview? What is the process from getting hired to starting? I heard that they can waitlist you if there is no opening. If attractions did not have an opening would I be able to choose another positions just in case? I would like to start the job soon if offered. Also anyone currently or in the pass worked for Disneyland how was your experience as a college student? Do they work with your school schedule? Thank you in advance!",

If you have any experience. Honestly. Just lie. Something like yeah I operated rides at a local town street fair so you seem just the slightest bit more desirable. They teach you everything anyway. \n2. If no openings for attractions try for ticketing, entertainment host (what I do), guest relations..anything really. Just STAY AWAY FROM QSR Food &amp; Beverage. \n3. As long as you upload your schedule in advance, as well as your preference form, they\u2019ll accommodate you. Just be aware down shifts can go past 12am and they go by seniority. \n\nOverall I think the vibe is great and I love the community you build with friends bonding over stuff like crazy guests or things only CMs deal with. Plus they offer aspire through the school which, after about 90 days you can apply (auto accept basically) and they\u2019ll just put the money for your semester tuition/books costs into your paycheck that week. Only thing is some folks get an issue with the later shifts and the pay but you can come into the parks for free basically whenever you want. \n\nIf you have any questions lmk hope this was helpful!",

And even after you get GR you\u2019ll still have to work a few months earning your stripes as a reliable CM. And I can\u2019t speak on job fairs I would recommend just constantly checking the job portal",

The attendance policy got a lot more strict recently so you have a threshold of call outs/tardies you can hit before you trigger a discipline. You can also pay yourself to cancel out the call outs/tardies",

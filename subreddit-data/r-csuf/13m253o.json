            "comment": "Honestly it just depends on your priorities. A lot of people stay in University Honors for a couple of years so that they can get priority registration, take the honors classes for GEs and don't necessarily plan on staying in it until they graduate because they don't want to do the honors project as a senior. I personally enjoyed the lower level honors courses way more than the rest of my GEs, due to the quality of the professors and the smaller class size. I know some people that stayed in because the honors center allowed for free printing and more private areas to study. It really just depends on if the honors roadmap works for you.",

Then there\u2019s the senior honors project which you\u2019d have to do (it\u2019s not as hard as it sounds, it\u2019s more of a personal interest project). If you wanted to do all that you might need to take an extra semester or two, so probably not worth in my opinion.",

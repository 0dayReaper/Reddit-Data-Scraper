    "postText": "I usually borrow a long term laptop from the CEDA at csuf and normally the date it is due is the friday of finals week (19th). I believe they normally send a reminder to when the laptop is due. However, this morning I woke up to an email saying I am being charged a late fee $20/day. Anyone getting this??",

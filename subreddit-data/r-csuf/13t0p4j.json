Canvas defaults to 74% as a C, 84% as a B, 94% as an A. It\u2019s possible to switch the default (to say 73%, 83%, etc) but it requires an extra step which includes manually entering the percentages as you want them to match up with each letter and +/- \n\nSeems like your prof skipped this step or didn\u2019t realize it and doesn\u2019t want to go through and make a bunch of grade changes (possibly dozens depending). \n\nI would definitely ask them again and just reiterate that it\u2019s on their syllabus. Then reach out to the chair after that.",

They could bring your grade up to an A or you might get a moody email back saying why they gave you the A-.\n\nAlso I think most syllabus are subject to change so they could've adjusted the grading scale because they thought too many people got A's. Doesn't always happen but I've heard of teachers switching up grading half way through the semester.",

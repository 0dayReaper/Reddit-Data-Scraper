I\u2019d rather both of them told me ahead of time and I would\u2019ve done the fucking work for them. I have to get up early for work, and three out of the five days this week, I only got four hours of sleep thanks to them",

Would much rather prefer individual projects or at least extra homework. Having to rely on a random with your grade just sucks. Glad you got it done though",

She came straight from Vegas and said she lost her phone and asked us \u201cokay, what do I say\u201d right as we were called up. we let her present with us but I ratted her our end of class. Bullshit if you think you can take credit from other\u2019s hard work. Now I\u2019m living it all over again this semester, and professors aren\u2019t always so understanding. I yearn for a good group.",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone to take over my lease for June and July at Alight. It\u2019s super close to CSUF, abt a 5 min walk!! \n\nIt\u2019s a 4x4, so you will have your own bathroom which is directly across the hall from your personal bedroom. The rent is $1227/ a month, all utilities, wifi and amenities included &lt;33 You will be able to move in June (lmk what date so we can plan accordingly) but must move out by July 24th! Please contact me if you\u2019re interested.  \n\nThanks!!",

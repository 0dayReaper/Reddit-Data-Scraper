A lot of people complain about no social life/ friends (personally i think thats a skill issue) but ive net people through class that still keep in touch. And after being here and getting used to the area i decided to even get more involved for the beginning of FALL 2023 semester.\n\nI was nervous too but trust me everything falls into place and I\u2019m happy here. You\u2019ll do great &lt;3",

However, a lot of that was influenced by the fact that I transferred in 2021 so a lot of the classes were still online for my major. \n\nCSUF is what you make of it. A lot of people commute so they just come to class and have. Other people are able to stay on campus and have the opportunity to join clubs.\n\nI'm a commuter myself and work full-time so I didn't make friends while at CSUF. Whereas I always heard classmates talking about their plans to hang out. \n\nThings you can expect:\nTrouble with parking. It's a bit of a mess so arrive at school early. Parking is also expensive. \nClasses can fill up before your time to register comes up so keep backups for electives and non core classes. Try to get your core classes out of the way as quickly as you can. \nUse rate my professor when picking classes. \nYou're going to need to make sure you're studying and can write well. Use the library and student resources available to make sure you're able to keep up with the higher level of academic standards. \n\nGood luck!",

Not only will it automatically give you a group to hang out with but you can also try to line up your schedules and take classes together. It beats not knowing anyone and feeling like an outsider. Plus some people say they learn more from the clubs than they do their actual classes so there's that, lol.",

Its my first year here (i also transferred) and my first semester i mostly kept to myself but this semester i made a handful of good friends. Just beware of petitioners and religious recruiters asking for you to join their prayer group if youre not interested you have to be firm in telling them no or just completely ignore them they are VERY persistent \ud83d\ude43 oh and of course\u2026 the nutwood nutter",

    "postText": "Hello!\ud83d\ude42\n\nI\u2019m a upcoming freshman and I got accepted but I have a question on my grades. Currently I have all A\u2019s and B\u2019s for my classes but two they are both a C. Would my acceptance get rescinded if I don\u2019t raise them up? Or if I only raise one of the C\u2019s up will my acceptance still get rescinded? \n\nThank you!",

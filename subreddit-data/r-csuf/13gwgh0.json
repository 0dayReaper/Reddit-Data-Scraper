So I\u2019m assuming she wasn\u2019t really hurt and it was in some way a joke. Jokes are ment to be morbid or fucked up in some way to be considered funny. For example what\u2019s the difference between a Mexican and a elevator? One can raise a family. Another example what does a black person and a apple have in common? They both look good hanging from trees. What did one Arab say to the other Arab? You\u2019re the bomb!",

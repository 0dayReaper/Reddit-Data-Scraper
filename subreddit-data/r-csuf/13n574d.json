Is it purely because of size?  I get that 16's weight might be inconvenient but isn't it more bang for bucks (for people who want to max out the spec)?",

If that\u2019s the case, then I suggest you take a deep look at what you need it for. The airs are plenty powerful for most tasks and roughly half the price of the 16\u201d pro. For most people the performance of the pros is overkill so you\u2019d really be paying a 1k difference for the extra 3 inches",

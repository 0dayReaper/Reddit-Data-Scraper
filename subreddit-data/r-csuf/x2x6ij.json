You can even see that possible scenario in this photo. Like if that car on the far right was just a few inches to the right, another car could squeeze in there but they\u2019d be forced to park over the line. \n\nThen those cars that force you to park over the line leave, and all people see is your car and think you\u2019re the asshole. Just last week I saw a student take a picture of an aggressive note on their car complaining about their parking, but they were in the exact scenario I just described.\n\nAs I said, you can\u2019t know for sure unless you witnessed it. That\u2019s why damaging someone car in this scenario (as someone suggested) is not a good idea. See the bigger picture.",

    "postText": "I am asking on behalf of the Communications majors and graduates. At CSUF, I graduated with a Communications degree, and my concentration was Public Relations. I know I should've gained knowledge at CSUF about jobs for people with Communications degrees. Please help me again as I go apply to jobs online. Aside from Public Relations jobs, what job positions can I work with my Communications degree with a concentration in PR?",

Event planning, marketing, project management, EA, product specialist, and a bunch of other things. You just have to get creative and fine tune other skills for the particular role.",

What industry do you want to do PR in? There are a ton of industries where PR is hiring, mostly from the agency side. Of course, there are in-house roles too but those are more hard to come by if you don't have the experience from agency life (unless if you network and get lucky).",

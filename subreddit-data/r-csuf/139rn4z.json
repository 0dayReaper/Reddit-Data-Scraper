What are my options? Is there some alternative like meeting on a different date, or is it possible to complete this session over Zoom?\n\nI had emailed HSS and was simply told that there were \u201cmakeup requirements.\u201d",

He says that it changes every year, so what you'll hear from people here is not going to be the same for you, also he says \"If you've already emailed HSS, the deadline to accept was just 5 days ago and they're still working out the details. They'll tell you how the makeup works when its finalized. Email again closer to the actual orientation, too early now. Good luck!\"",

It\u2019s difficult to be paid your worth and get a good position without having x amount of years in the field. I currently work for county it pays more but sometimes I barely even get a break. I\u2019m just getting my experience in order to get my msw",

Politics are bad and God forbid you\u2019re bilingual you get double the work and maybe a dollar more an hour and it pretty much depends on who you know if you promote it\u2019s just a mess\u2026 city and state jobs tend to pay more But I myself am planning on going to a nonprofit for sure. I\u2019m supposed to graduate this year, but one of my professors decided to not pass me after making me jump through hoops, so here I am an emotional mess. Has anyone else had a problem passing a class.\u2639\ufe0f I am trying to take it again in the summer but I already have two classes and I don\u2019t see the option of taking it for any other sessions. It literally only gives you session a as the only choice.",

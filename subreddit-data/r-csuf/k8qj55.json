They don\u2019t prioritize solving thiefs or breakins Bc they\u2019re not the ones who are losing any stuff. It\u2019s us that\u2019d be losing our own shits",

One time I didn\u2019t want to drive my car over there and walk back because I was just going to nap. I park in the structure and 5 min later I gotta go bc I don\u2019t have a pass. I know it\u2019s the rules but like damn. I was going to be there like 30 min tops.",

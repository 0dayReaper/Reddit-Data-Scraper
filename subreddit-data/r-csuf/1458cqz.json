    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m looking for a way to calculate the total cost of Fall 2023. I don\u2019t want to take more financial aid than I need. I called the financial aid office and they told me to contact the student business services. Big surprise that for the last two weeks the student business services people either put me on hold for a long time then drop my call or just don\u2019t even answer the phone. \n\nAnyone else have a way to calculate the cost or another method of contact for the student business center? Driving down there is my last resort because I can\u2019t confirm if they\u2019re even open/taking walk-one and because of the distance.\n\nThank you!",

Basically almost no people on campus except employees and the few students taking classes. If you are in DBH it\u2019s a bit more active. Occasionally the campus will be a ghost town. For one or two days during summer there is orientation for new students and campus is packed those days. \n\nMost places are closed on campus. Starbucks is open. Togos is open. Carls Jr is open. I think that\u2019s it. I may be wrong, can\u2019t remember. Typically it\u2019s all under limited hours so they close by 1 ish.",

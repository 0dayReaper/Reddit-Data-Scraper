I wanted to use how helpful a masters will be when I apply for senior roles in accounting in government. I heard the classes for masters is a challenge at csuf. Are there better schools that are more reputable but the class schedule is more reliable than csuf? Also how is your guys experience at csuf do far in MSA? How are the classes?",

She told me that it is better and much cheaper just to take the thirty extra credits using the local community college. Make sure you have completed the basic requirements: A bachelor\u2019s degree; 24 semester units in accounting-related subjects; 24 semester units in business-related subjects; 150 semester units (or 225 quarter units) of education; Passing the Uniform CPA Exam; Passing the Professional Ethics Exam for CPAs; and One year of general accounting experience supervised by a CPA with an active license. Even if you don't work for a CPA you will be able to get a senior job in government with the right experience.",

In other words, once you have a CPA license, no one really cares about your MSA anymore. In your case, an MBA might benefit you more. And CSUF has a great MBA program. Many professors here are from UCI as well.",

    "postText": "I took chemistry honors in high school with a bunch of high level math. Would it be ok for me to enter CHEM 200 without CHEM 100? It says in the CSUF page that 1 year of chem in highschool with math is enough, but my friend told me I am required to take CHEM 100 prior to it. Thanks!",

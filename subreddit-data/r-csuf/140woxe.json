A close friend of mine is getting her B.S. in Public Health and she completed all her nursing prerequisites so she can apply for an accelerated nursing program after her undergrad (this is a very popular route!). Talk to the Health Professions advisor or even contact the nursing program and ask how to prep if you\u2019re still interested in that route.\n\nI also got rejected as a freshman and I changed to public health. I just graduated with my B.S. and plan on getting a masters in public health to be an Epidemiologist because I fell in love with the major!",

Def talk with the Health Professions advisor because they can talk to you about what requirements you need for an accelerated or masters!",

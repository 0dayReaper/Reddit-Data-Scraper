My Econ 320 class on the schedule say 10-2pm the fin 321 is online asynchronous no time slot but now I\u2019ve got my finals schedule the same time block. Has anybody had this happen before.

I emailed both and the online professor refused to reschedule while the Saturday class professor says that the online professor needs to reschedule. The saturday professor ended up asking the online professor to let me take the final at another time",

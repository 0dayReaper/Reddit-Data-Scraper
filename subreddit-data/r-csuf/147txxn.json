Review that, check your portal for the link to select classes, put them in your cart then reach out to an academic advisor. I\u2019d start with the course catalog https://catalog.fullerton.edu/index.php",

For example, if you're studying psychology, look up csuf psychology catalog, then you will find all the classes you need for the degree. If you have taken classes at your cc, be mindful to not do them again at CSUF.",

From there I suggest taking at the minimum five courses each semester. Preferably six, but I understand not everyone can or has the time. If you have the time also take summer as they have two sessions where you can complete some courses. This may assist you in completing in time or even ahead of time. Good luck!",

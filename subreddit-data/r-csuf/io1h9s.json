Your use of proper grammar and syntax juxtaposes her initial tweet in order to subvert the expectation of the viewer and imply that she is both thoughtfully analyzing and providing social commentary on discussion boards, rather than simply using a meme format popularized from Spongebob Squarepants in a sarcastic method to express her own annoyance with the curriculum. \n\nLooking forward to your future posts!",

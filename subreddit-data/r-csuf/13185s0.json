    "postText": "I need help picking which English class. I am a psych major, and planning on going to grad school. I was told during orientation that if you're going to go to grad school, to pick 363. Is this true? I am not planning on staying in psych, but I want to pursue my master's in social work. Would I still be able to get into the program, or would picking 363 look better on my transcripts?\n\nThey have engl301 over the summer, if that's the better option, would it be better to just get it out of the way? I only want to take one class over the summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you in advance!",

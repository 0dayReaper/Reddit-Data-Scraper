            "comment": "In the past - the SUG was added to our financial aid packages later than the initial federal aid given. For context, I am a current graduate student. Last year (for the 22-23 year), the State University Grant (SUG) didn\u2019t appear in my financial aid package until the end of July, 2022 while I received my initial federal aid offers in May of 2022. \n\nWhen speaking to the financial aid office in the past, they mentioned that most often federal aid will appear first with state aid following later on once the state determines who will actually receive the allocated funds. I did send a message to their online system about when to potential expect word about the SUG for 23-24, so hopefully I hear back soon \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",

In the meantime, please monitor your email for further updates. Hope this helps!\u201d",

            "comment": "I was in a similar situation where my SUG was not showing for Spring 2023. For some background, I am a graduate student in my final semester. I had accumulated over the cap units that the SUG covers; therefore, I was no longer eligible to receive the SUG. I did my own research before I called the financial aid office to have them look into it. They basically confirmed what I had already discovered.\n\nThere could be various reasons why it\u2019s not showing up. It could even be delayed (hopefully that\u2019s the case). I would suggest checking out the school\u2019s site for more information:\nhttps://www.fullerton.edu/financialaid/award/sug.php\n\nIf you\u2019re still unsure, I would suggest calling the financial aid office for more information. Good luck with finals!",

Enjoyable lectures, specifically stories he shares from the industry. However we do have 3 exams including the final, all of which are non cumulative. I must say that his exams are a pain in the sense that he puts 5 multiple choice options per question which trip you out. The whole class feels prepared, I study for at least 3 days and the class average is a C. He curves like 5% each exam and will consider curving at the end of the course",

He goes through the powerpoints and would write the excel commands on the whiteboard but never showed an example of applying these commands. Unless you\u2019re comfortable with excel, you might struggle in this class but we were allowed a cheat sheet for the exams. For MKTG 351, I\u2019d agree with the other commenter",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nI posted here recently and thank you to those who answered my previous question. I have another question. I am a upcoming freshman and I was thinking of changing my major. I applied for electrical engineering and I want to change to criminal justice. How will I be able to change my major? Would it be a tedious \nprocess? And what would I need to do?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hello! I believe if you go on the admissions and records site at CSUF it will have the form for any major/concentration changes. If they haven\u2019t changed the policy the first change is at no cost (or it\u2019s $10). I would recommend waiting until the semester starts to speak to an advisor in the criminal justice department in case there are any limitations to getting into that major before submitting a request (&amp; they can also go over the coursework for that major with you as well).",

Last semester we were told to let all incoming freshman know that if you want to change your major, you have to wait until the first day of the semester. You\u2019ll go thru the whole orientation process under your current major (which you usually experience with other students of that same major), but there isn\u2019t anything different between each orientation! If you\u2019d like, do the online orientation and set up an advising appointment with an advisor for the major you want and then you can pick your classes before you even switch! Best of luck and congrats!",

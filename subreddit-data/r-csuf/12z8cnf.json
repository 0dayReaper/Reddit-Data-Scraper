    "postText": "Hi guys so I\u2019m currently a pre-business undergrad and calculus is a requirement class. I was wondering if calculus is needed for international business majors as well because I just dropped Calc one this semester it was too hard. And I saw the roadmap for international business and it didn\u2019t show any calculus on there. Please tell me you don\u2019t because im thinking of switching my major to international because of Calc.",

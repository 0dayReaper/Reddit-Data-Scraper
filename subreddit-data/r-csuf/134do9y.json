    "postText": "I transferred into the comms program (entertainment/tourism) here last semester and I\u2019m planning on doing my internship during the Spring \u201824 semester (hopefully my last semester). I will admit that it\u2019s a bit stressful that an internship is required for graduation because I\u2019m worried about what will happen if I won\u2019t be able to get one, but I\u2019m trying to get ahead of the game before time runs out. Does anyone have any tips or insight into the internship process for the Comms program specifically? Or any places I should look into interning at? Thanks!",

There are also other alternatives like using linkedin or the CSUF database. \n\nit really just depends on what you want to do and from there just start connecting with people from companies you would love to intern at ! good luck \u2728",

For example summer internships applications close during the end of winter. So try to get one as soon as possible as a failsafe. (AKA don't wait until your final semester to get the internship. Look to get that class cleared ASAP!)\n\nMake sure you get your resume cleared by the Comms department and attend the informational session. The class is flexible, so they let you add and drop it as needed if you find an internship.\n\nAs people mentioned, apply on LinkedIn and the CSUF Symplicity database.",

    "postText": "Has anyone else using Microsoft Office had a new Microsoft 365 app take its place? I  do not know what happened, but I can no longer access the desktop version of Excel and can no longer open up any of my old Excel files. The new app doesn't let me open up any application on a desktop version but sends me to a web browser version. I am wondering if this is happening to anyone else.",

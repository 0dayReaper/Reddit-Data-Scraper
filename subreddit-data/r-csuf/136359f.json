This girl straight up gives me a dirty look and rolls her eyes to her friend\n\nIf you want to be Christian and have a club, fine. Where in the hell do you get the audacity to disrespect my beliefs? I\u2019m not going up to them telling them they\u2019re bigots for hating gays and trans people. I very well could go up and harasses them about their bigoted beliefs. I\u2019m so tired of these patronizing Christians. If you want believe in Jesus, go ahead. You\u2019re not special or unique for it. No one cares.",

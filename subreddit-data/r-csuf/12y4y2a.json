    "postText": "Hey guys SO I messed up and did not save any past syllabi for my classes. I got accepted into graduate school (yay!) but now they are asking me for past syllabi of prerequisite courses.\n\nI found the names of my past professors and plan to contact them but I've heard that departments have held on to copies of syllabi over the last 10 years. I wanted to know if I should contact the department first or anyone else such to see if they have a copy of the syllabus. Would that work or am I better off individually e-mailing the professors? \n\n(I took these classes back in 2019 so I'm truly suffering right now LOL).\n\nAlso pro tip: please *save all your syllabi* even if you're sure you're not going to graduate school because things might change in the future and you never know when you might need it. Wish someone told me this before having to ask my professors from 3+ years ago.",

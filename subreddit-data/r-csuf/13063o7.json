            "comment": "You can, but I am not sure that this is necessarily worth it. I guess it depends on what you want to do post-grad. If you want to leave your options open to either go into software or hardware, I would recommend computer engineering, and making your electives computer science electives. However, double majoring would likely take 5-6 years since both of these majors are rather packed, especially computer engineering. If you already have a lot of cc or ap credits that you can transfer, or you are willing to cram classes into summer/winter, then you may be able to finish in 5 years or less. Also, CSUF's computer engineering program generally focuses on hardware.",

I have friends who work fulltime as electric engineers, software engineers and embedded software engineering\u2019s. But hardware is an option too. But sky\u2019s the limit with CE. Lol",

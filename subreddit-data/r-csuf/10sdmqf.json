I wasn't even the first person to mention the charging permit, which is probably the reason that he got a ticket (that or not charging, or being there more than the allotted time), and pointing that out is a wrong thing to do? \n\nIf he was displaying the charging permit like he was supposed to, they would have put the permit number on the ticket, but they didn't (there is only 1 number there, which is the regular permit number). If OP is right about everything he says, more power to him, he should appeal and get it dismissed and be done lol.\n\nStrange that he's never shown his charging permit (even though he's posted almost everything else). But shhhh, don't ask questions and just nod and accept whatever you're told at face value, right?",

A sweet self own is good for laughs, so thanks! Also, no way to dispute this ticket, because they know who did and did not apply for the charging permit. Lol another fail?\n\nHave a good rest of the semester!",

                            "comment": "I don't think the OP is entitled to special treatment, but I do believe that a warning before issuing a ticket would be fair. It's important for a university or organization to enforce their rules and regulations, but issuing a ticket without a warning could come across as harsh and not give individuals a chance to rectify their mistake. Additionally, the high cost of the permit is already a burden, and receiving a ticket on top of that only adds to the financial strain. A warning system could serve as a deterrent to those who may be breaking the rules and also provide a sense of fairness to those who are trying to follow the rules.  \n\n\nYour argument implies that individuals who are breaking the rules should automatically be punished without any consideration for their circumstances or understanding of the rules. This approach assumes that everyone is aware of the rules and has the means to follow them, which may not always be the case. Furthermore, the idea that those who follow the rules are entitled to be \"protected\" from individuals who break the rules is flawed. A fair and just system should aim to educate and assist individuals in following the rules, not just penalize them without consideration. Additionally, the assumption that paying for a permit automatically means that one is \"working hard\" and aware of the rules is also flawed. Circumstances and life events can impact an individual's ability to comply with rules and regulations, and a one-size-fits-all approach to enforcement may not be appropriate.",

If you exceeded your time limit or you weren\u2019t charging then they can ticket you. If you didn\u2019t violate those,then it was simply parking that made the mistake and you can go to parking and appeal the ticket. If it happens again after that then it\u2019s a problem you can bring to Parking and Transportation. Id recommend going in person because it could take a while to get ahold of someone if you call or just submit the appeal online. \n\nI heard from a professor once that each student gets 1 parking ticket appeal per semester so try and make sure the ticket it wiped from your record entirely.

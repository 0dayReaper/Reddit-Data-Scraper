Every non accounting class I\u2019ve taken doesn\u2019t really require any accounting knowledge other than small tidbits here and there, but nothing detrimental if you didn\u2019t know. Let\u2019s be real, we all forget most of the things we learn from one semester to the next unless it\u2019s our concentration. \n\nI agree it\u2019s probably beneficial to understand concepts when you get in the real world but those concepts will probably come as you progress into you profession.",

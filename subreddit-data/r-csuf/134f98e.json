Pick out your CC, register as a student over there, complete your orientation, get an enrollment date, and enroll in the class. You can make sure the class transfers by using the Assist website. Then when you\u2019re done you just order a transcript from the CC to go to CSUF. There might be an extra step or two in there, but that was generally my process my first year!",

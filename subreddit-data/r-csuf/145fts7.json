    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be a transfer student for fall 2023 semester (Civil Engineering). Just wondering if anyone here is a recent graduate (2020 till date) of this major. I would appreciate any advice I can get on how to navigate the classes. Also if anyone is comfortable sharing the current places they were hired or similar places as an entry level as well as salary range. If not any advice will do. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a",

I would highly recommend joining ASCE and participating in one of the competitions. I was hired by the City of LA starting at 83k (it's now starting at 88k) with no internships. Plenty of people I know here have internships so it shouldn't be too difficult to get one.",

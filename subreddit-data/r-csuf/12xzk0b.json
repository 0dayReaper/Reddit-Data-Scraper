    "postText": "There is this recent petition going around on campus that says on the petition that it is to remove the upper limit landlords can charge tenants. The people advertising the petitions literallysay the opposite claiming its to \"lower the rent costs\" don't believe a word these guys say. They get paid per signature. just the other month there was this guy with a petition and he said its to \"lower gas prices\" I read it and it proposes to remove the limit on what landlords can charge tenants. DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD THESE BLOODSUCKING PARASITES SAY. READ. \ud83d\udc4f THE. \ud83d\udc4fPETITION.\ud83d\udc4f",

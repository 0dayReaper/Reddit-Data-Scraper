The grade on your student homepage is gonna be the real deal. You can always email your prof and ask to talk about your final paper. A lot of profs don\u2019t put as much effort into writing feedback on finals because it\u2019s harder to pass them back once the class is done (and most students don\u2019t care at that point) but if you ask you at least have a better shot of knowing.",

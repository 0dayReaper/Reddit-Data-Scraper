There are a limited amount of jobs with work study so ask as soon as possible. If you do, make sure you mention you want your paycheck to go to your tuition, because some students will ask for a physical paycheck!",

Also hiring process can take a while depending on department it took me 2-3 months after my interview to official get my on campus job",

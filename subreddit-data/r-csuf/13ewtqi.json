    "postText": "I'm currently attending CSUF and I've had one of the worst years related to school in my life. I transferred after attending a community college online for 2 years because of COVID and just working a job while living at home. I was set on majoring in Business with a concentration in Information Systems. My first pick was SDSU but I didn't get in and I actually got into UCSB but they didn't have a undergraduate Business major with information systems and I convinced myself that I didn't want an economics degree because I wanted to go into something tech related. I forced myself to choose between Cal State Long Beach and Fullerton and I choose Fullerton because I thought they had a better-looking business school and were in a better area.\n\nMy first semester I was living in an off-campus house because I didn't get housing on-campus with 5 other roommates who I had no similarities with whatsoever who would stay in their rooms 90% of the time and never come out except to eat or occasionally watch TV. I was also unaware of such a lacking social environment at Fullerton. I commuted while living alone and although I joined clubs such as the Real Estate club, Tennis Club, and Intramural soccer. Although I had conversations with people in the clubs it seems as if everyone is living their own life outside of school with work, family, and other responsibilities and never had time to hang out other than meeting within the clubs as everyone is a commuter who go to school, activities and then leave.\n\nI spent 90% of my time completely alone that semester with the exception of going to the beach on occasional weekends with my friend from high school who happened to be commuting to CSUF and lives in Orange County. However, he got a girlfriend and pretty much stopped contacting me aside from the occasional text. Being so isolated started taking a toll on my mental health and my mom decided to move me out of the off-campus house and into on-campus living.\n\nI've now lived in the on-campus housing for the second semester which is coming to an end next week and although It's been more bearable, I'm still unhappy here. I attempted pledging a Fraternity to have a social life and got dropped the day before initiation for not cleaning a house after a party but I told them I had to go help my mom back home because she broke her shoulder. I also crashed my car and had to pay $1,800 to get it fixed around the same time. Even when I was in the fraternity I feel I was still out of place even though I've always been a social person. Although people at the school are nice, I haven't made a real connection with anyone, and even people who live on campus all go home on the weekends while I'm stuck living in a 4x4 cubicle on an empty campus. My major has been extremely disappointing as well as the department only has 1-3 classes available each semester with mostly mediocre professors with the exception of a couple of good ones. I can confidently say I don't feel I've learned anything of value after my first year of school and have no career prospects in my field lined up.\n\nI got into ASU and if I transfer I would delay my graduation from the spring of 2024 to fall of 2024, I would have to take 2 summer courses and 6 classes per semester until Fall of '24 but one class would be .5 units instead of 3. Only 5 out of 10 courses I took here transferred over to ASU for credit towards my major which is why I have to retake so many classes. I now am regretting my decision to not attend UCSB as I had a friend who went there and I visited one weekend and found a completely different environment to mine which I loved even though I've never been much of a partier.\n\nI'm now trying to make the decision to postpone my graduation a semester and go to ASU for the sake of my mental health, overall happiness, and social life assuming a family friend helps me out financially or solider it out for another year at Fullerton and get my degree. On one hand, I really just want my degree and don't want to have to retake a bunch of classes. On the other hand, I know I would dread another year at this school and I would be graduating with no real career prospects, new friendships or social connections, and no college experience whatsoever. I told myself my life would be completely different after transferring from community college and I'd be having a blast at college while getting my degree, however, nothing has really changed in my life and I experience periodic moments of extreme loneliness and sadness.\n\nAny suggestions on what I should do would be extremely helpful.",

Why not bury yourself in your actual studies and if you\u2019re not interested, you\u2019re in the wrong major. Ultimately the wisest choice is to follow your passions, you will have a greater will to learn and work harder. It may not result in the highest income, but you don\u2019t need to be a millionaire(ss) to be happy, which is truly what life is about. There are always jobs in any major as an educator (at minimum). I\u2019m speaking from experience (kinesiology professor).",

Like you said, CSUF is a commuter school therefore not many people are open to socializing. Put yourself out there, go to concerts, pick up a hobby, anything that you really loved doing. I can guarantee that you will find one friend this way. \n\nAs for transferring due to feeling lonely, you have to decide whether you are willing to delay your graduation and pay more money or stick it out and finish. Just remember, the way you are feeling is temporary and will change once you graduate. But if you believe transferring is best for you, then that\u2019s also definitely ok. Dont feel ashamed or give yourself a hard time for transferring. Enjoy life and good luck!",

Maybe you could join that and make some friends in there. CSUF social life is pretty bad so I chose to make close friends by joining other clubs in UCI. Some of the closest friends ive ever made there. \n\nAs others have said in the comments, the fact that you spent more money just because social life sucks here is kinda ridiculous. Thats life. I forced myself to block out my social life for 2 lonely years keeping my head in the books outside of CSUF for the sake of my career. I have no regrets now that I have a high paying job as a senior with more time to meet new people in the workplace",

Do what you love, find hobbies outside of class that you can do with others, put yourself out there, join an exercise club. Also, it sounds like you should consider therapy if you haven't already, even if you think you don't need it, just try it because sometimes all you need is someone to talk things out with.\n\nYou'll be okay and it will get better.",

At the end of the day though we\u2019re here for school, and your degree is what should make you feel accomplished about all of this! You also can just pick a grad school that has a bigger social atmosphere. Just keep going and good luck! You got this!!",

It\u2019s my first year at CSUF too and I somewhat regret going here, it\u2019s so hard to make any friends here it\u2019s insane. In my opinion either next semester rush more fraternities rush a lot and truly choose one that you feel like you fit in. I didn\u2019t rush the 2 previous semesters because I was in a relationship but now that I\u2019m not in one I definitely want to rush in fall. Or honestly transfer to ASU because the ASU environment is very social and it is way easier to make friends there. I have some friends that go there and they are happy there. I hope everything works out!",

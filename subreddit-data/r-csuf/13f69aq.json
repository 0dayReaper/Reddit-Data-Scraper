Does this mean I drop the class and re-register to actually be added into the class or should I just ignore this? Also I never requested a permit to register for this class as I already completed the pre-reqs to register for it.",

But if you try to add the class while you\u2019re still on the waitlist, the permit isn\u2019t gonna work, which is why you would need to drop the class and then add it.",

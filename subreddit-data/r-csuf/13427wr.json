I'm getting max pell grant and a 5000 \"scholarship\" from CSUF but my cal grant still hasn't come in yet. How much would I be expected to pay? How much in cal grant would I get? I'm very worried about my cost for next year.",

Get another 1-2 outside scholarships or plan on taking out a small subsidized loan and you\u2019re good. And don\u2019t worry about some nominal debt - dealing with debt is an adulting thing to get used to",

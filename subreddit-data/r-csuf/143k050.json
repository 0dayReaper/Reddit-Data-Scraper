            "comment": "I personally wouldn't recommend taking the train because it's a long train ride and then you'd still be a fair distance away from the school when you get to Fullerton. If you're trying to minimize costs, then your best bet is taking the bus from the train station to the school and that adds another 30 minutes to your commute, even longer if you decide to walk. Unfortunately, public transportation here isn't reliable either, so you would need to leave really early and potentially deal with late or canceled trains and buses. It might be nice if you only have like one or two classes a day and you can afford to leave early, but as a fellow Riverside county student I prefer to schedule most of my classes for two days of the week and just drive.\n\nIf you don't have access to a car and can't afford a daily Uber, you can always look for a carpool chain and just take the train on days when carpool isn't an option.",

UCR wouldnt have been special to me",

However, there are buses that take you straight to campus from the Fullerton station! If you do drive, I found that the heaviest traffic was from 6am-9:30am and from 2pm-7pm. Although it\u2019s way worse on fridays and traffic starts around 12! average commute time was about 75 minutes for me if i had to drive in traffic but usually around 45-55 min since i planned my classes at non-traffic times. i also think the train takes way longer than that plus the time it takes the bus!",

I finished early during orientation and it allowed me to get the classes I wanted without stressing about not having the right schedule and all that :) It doesn\u2019t have to be absolute but have an idea so you can go in. (Which means you\u2019ll have to have some idea of what you need to graduate of course) \n\nIdk what major you are but that\u2019s easier said than done for others. I\u2019m an anth major so I can just take whatever, but if you\u2019re bio or business it\u2019s a little more difficult. They didn\u2019t really help me figure out what classes to take honestly at mine but maybe other people had better advising in other majors???",

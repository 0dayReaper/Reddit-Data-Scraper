I believe that you just have to fill out the [excess unit form](http://records.fullerton.edu/resources/) and then they approve it for you. My brother\u2019s was approved (most likely because he was going to graduate). I think the only tough part about it is that it may be overwhelming with the amount of classes you have to take (especially if they are upper division). I would also recommend speaking with a [CAS advisor](http://hhd.fullerton.edu/cas/_documents/advisement/flyers/Spring%20%202023%20%20Drop%20In%20Advising%20Flyer%204.3.23%20-5.19%20Updated.pdf) because they can definitely give you better input about this.",

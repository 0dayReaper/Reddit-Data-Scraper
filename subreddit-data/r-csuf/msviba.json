Too many teachers are being proactive towards cheating with Lockdown, Proct, etc, adding to the pressure and stress of test taking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot just that, but you have to trouble shoot any issues you have with any of these proctoring softwares, so if your internet disconnects for 1 second or something, you are at fault. How dare you have rolling black outs in your area, during a wildfire season???!",

Taking Japanese 101 right now and I can tell some of my classmates are using fucking google translate. Don't know why they think they can get by when it's hella wrong on what we're learning.",

I learned this in my junior year and ended the rest of my semesters with Dean's list. Books and study time are your friends now. My major was in mechanical engineering for what it's worth. I just finished last semester",

Some stuff like not worrying about driving, parking, no looking and acting dead, etc. because it's online is actually helpful. I can still join class and learn something with the click of a button, even if I can barely get out of bed for no reason. I don't have to tell my professors about my mental health when I'm not feeling ready or trust them just yet (or don't want to have a breakdown/cry in front of them), because they'll assume I'm lazy or something otherwise. I'm able to build a decent exercise pattern (though I miss the gym and pool a lot, gained some weight). No more tempting unhealthy food. I have what I need at all times. Can take naps. More I can't think of right now. My grades are doing good. \n\nIt seems like our society doesn't let you have room for mental health, though it's changing, and I was on the verge of a real bad fall before covid shut things down. I may have had some sort of breakdown otherwise. Not pleased at all about covid for other reasons, but it did kinda save me. \n\nI do miss people and outside and quiet places to study, though.",

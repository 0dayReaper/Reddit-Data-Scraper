I was lowkey thinking it won't fit on the desk but I can always just bring one depending on the size of the table and such. But are we permitted to bring them in the first place?",

The desks in the suites however aren\u2019t very big and have no extra shelves so if someone managed It in the suites I\u2019d imagine the RHs would be fine?? But yeah everyone else probably has more specific info",

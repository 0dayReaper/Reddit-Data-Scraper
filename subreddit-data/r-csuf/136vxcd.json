    "postText": "I was on my way to the library and was stopped by 2 of the girls who constantly try to recruit people for their \"bible study\" I politely told them no but they persisted and this random guy walking past yelled out \"SHE SAID NO MOVE ON\" and kept walking and I took that as my opportunity to walk away too. I always get stopped by these petitioners and bible people and I just want to yell at them to leave me the FUCK alone when they keep persisting but I can't. So thank you for doing what I can't!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",

I got a WU grade on a class that I admittedly missed a lot for personal reasons, BUT:\n\n- I did eventually start coming again\n\n- I was still on the roster when I came back (I was still being called on when checking attendance)\n\n- I had a number grade all the way until the end of the semester\n\nI did end up getting an F in that class, but I don't think that should matter?",

I had a class where my professor told a student who was on pace to get an F to not show up for the final so that they could give the student a WU. \n\nIn their eyes, they thought they were doing the student a favor since that WU, assuming it was their first one, would turn into a W. Still not great to have on their transcript, but slightly better than having an F.",

They can issue a WU (unauthorized withdrawal) and it\u2019ll convert to a W if it\u2019s your first time getting that grade. A WU basically means you stopped showing up to class and/or doing the work. Some professors used to be super lenient and give an I (incomplete) the school became more strict about incompletes so it\u2019s less common now.",

Someone just offered me $30 a ticket \ud83e\udd21 I\u2019d rather have my family watch for free outside the stadium. These tickets are like trying to see Drake &amp; 21 (which I\u2019d be willing to pay more for). Be careful, some aren\u2019t willing to be reasonable. I\u2019d personally sell them for $5/ticket bc it\u2019s more of a intimate experience than a rap concert.",

As an incentive for your participation, we are automatically entering all participants into a raffle to win wood engraved goods!\n\nThe survey focuses on your engagement with r/premed, and how it affects your identity as a pre-med student and your future aspirations as a doctor. It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and asks questions about your demographic and academic background.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate your participation in our study, as it will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of social media on mental health and well-being. It will also help us develop more effective support resources for pre-medical students.\n\nYour participation is entirely voluntary, and all responses will be kept confidential.

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently trying to remove myself from a very toxic household(parent physically abusive such as hitting ,throwing things at me, destruction of my property) and I am trying to do both my work(both my jobs require me to work from home) as well as school assignments from home. I\u2019m a 22 female and I am just waiting to hear back from renters near my area to see if they accept me as a good enough tenant for an apartment I applied for. \n\nDoes anyone near Los Angeles area (Whittier,La Habra, Norwalk ) or OC area have or know of a place I can stay temporarily that I may also use WiFi in for work and school? Basically this is a plea for help. I feel unsafe in my home and I\u2019m just trying to do my work and school things comfortably. Thank you guys in advance",

I think the dorms are at greatly reduced occupancy right now, so I hope that getting temporary / emergency housing would be easier this semester than in the past. Fingers crossed for you. Good luck! \n\n[http://www.fullerton.edu/deanofstudents/basic\\_needs/](http://www.fullerton.edu/deanofstudents/basic_needs/)",

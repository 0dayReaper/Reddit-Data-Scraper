Here's the official Cal State Fullerton Office of the President guidelines on free speech\n\nhttp://president.fullerton.edu/directives/directive5.aspx\n\nSection B indicates that \"freedom of expression and expressive conduct\" is subject to reasonable restrictions when they \"impede or are disruptive to the regular or essential operations of the University\", such as \"teaching, study, research, administration\". This is important bc \"activities are not permitted inside any building or parking structure or lot\". Outside of the buildings and the quads are the designated public spaces those activities may occur. \n All students, staff, faculty, guests and visitors are subject to following these or risk removal from the campus. \n\nThe email listed for questions is: freespeech@fullerton.edu\n\nI would email them (from your student account) a brief summary of when, where, and what was said to you by whom. Or as much as you remember. Then ask if their actions are a violation of this or similar directive(s).\n\nIf they respond with yes, proceed with whatever complaint system they are able to give you. \n\nIf they respond with no, ask why. It is possible that sections of the TSU can be argued to be a grey area (the courtyard?), but it is quite clear in the directive that buildings are off-limits. It is also possible that there are a more specific set of rules for religious proselytizing, and if so please ask for them and for them to explain how it compares to Directive 5. \n\nIf they do not help you, escalate by forwarding the email exchange to the Office of the President of csuf, and ask them to review the incident. This may seem extreme, but it's the Office of the President's directive, they should care about it being followed. \n\n\nMay your indoor lunches be as peaceful as you'd like them.",

So they aren't allowed to solicit you in any part of the TSU including the courtyard. If they solicit you again I recommend finding a building manager and reporting them! They're the ppl with the black polos and wire headsets who walk around the building.",

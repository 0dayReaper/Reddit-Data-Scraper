    "postText": "What is going on with CTVA courses being basically non-existent? I'm going to enter my first senior semester, and need to take a class to be able to enroll for upper-division courses in my last semester, and they are only offering one course and it's already closed despite my senior enrollment date not having opened yet. I haven't been keeping up with the complaints made to the department on behalf of CTVA students, and even other arts majors. It's really screwing people over.",

If the course you waitlisted yourself in is a course that is a major requirement most likely people won't drop the course unless it doesn't align with there schedule. If its a major elective or a general upper division elective then you have a chance of getting in, won't happen quickly but can happen either during the term semester and getting added later like mid semester, or before the school term starts or now or summer etc. \n\nCheck at least once a week for progress, because I waitlisted myself in a course since April for a major elective was the 5th, and the class was 40 people, and yesterday got added into the course. I would say it all depends on you if you want to wait, or just enroll for now to the class you need that has space, and if you get into the course you got waitlisted, then you can always drop the course that had space.",

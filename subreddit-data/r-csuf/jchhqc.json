So if you fail that one question don't bother trying on the other ones.\" My teacher didnt warn us about that btw. I literally just took the exam and it showed me that the last question was 50 points out of the 100. I studied alot for the other material and a little bit for the 50 point question. Would of been good to know what to study beforehand. I did perfect on the 4 questions but did horribly on the last. Got an F on that exam lmfao apparently I prioritized wrong. The exam was curved tho so idk I guess I'm lazy Idk \ud83d\ude43",

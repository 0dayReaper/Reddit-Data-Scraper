I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who has/is currently double majoring. \n\nIs it even doable to balance the workload and still have a good GPA? How is managing time and the motivation like? Would I need to take summer classes??\n\nAny advice or insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)\n\nadditional context: Incoming freshman, current major listed as pre-business, wanting to double major Business Finance and Philosophy Professional Concentration (both are bachelor\u2019s of arts) in hopes to be a lawyer.",

It was kinda tricky since I had conflicting class times and I would have to request special permission to enroll in two classes at the same time that had a small overlap. If I waited, my time could have extended by a year or more.\n \nMy mentality was someone taking 7 units is paying the same as someone taking 22 units. Might as well enroll in as much classes as possible, and then drop the ones that you feel you might not be able to manage. You WILL take more than 15+ units otherwise you\u2019d be stuck here for a long time. Your time management needs to be really good, there is NO time to procrastinate or leave assignments to the last minute. Your weekends will be limited. Having study groups will help a lot!\n\nSummer &amp; winter classes might be good to take if it takes a semester or more off your timeline, just be aware of the costs.",

            "comment": "definitely possible to double or even triple major, just depends on what classes you want to take. I have a close friend that double majored and double minored (almost triple majored). I'm currently double majoring and was originally planning to also have a minor but lost interest in that subject over the pandemic. \n\nBasically, go into it with a really clear idea of what the requirements and prerequisites are for both majors, and email the major advisors for information about when classes are given (a lot are spring or fall only, and some are not even every year). Your advisors will *only* know about their department, and they might not even know much (but for business they definitely will know about business), so do your research going in. try to \"double dip\" where you can but be aware that if you minor, some of those credits cannot be double dipped. look for roadmaps from the departments, and make a list of requirements for each major and for your GEs. \n\nhere's a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqQjtssyRKwUaAjInyOVt2giT6avxuZz8Rfrc6rfuAU/edit) I made for myself, if it helps",

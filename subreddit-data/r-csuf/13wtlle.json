    "postText": "Hi, I am a transfer student and new to paying for college.\n\nIf I was to stay on campus, I think I would have to accept the loans since financial aid is only enough for the tuition? Is this right? On the cost of attendance page, it shows that my \"Room and Board\" is only $9k, is this the amount I have to pay for housing? Do I need to pay for both semesters of housing? or could I pay for 1 semester at a time?",

As a transfer you\u2019d be moving into the Suites, so that\u2019s going to be about $19k for the whole academic year. They have a payment calculator where you can input all of your financial aid and see the remaining cost.",

    "postText": "Kind of says it all. I am a first time incoming freshman, who applied and was accepted as an English major but wants to change majors preferably to business administration. Although I heard this is impacted, so should I try and switch to a similar major? And how do I do that? Sorry lots of questions and the website just confuses me even more. I don\u2019t even know how to register for classes for any major. Or what classes I should take based on my major.",

            "comment": "There are Business Administration roadmaps on the website that show you the sequence of recommended classes to do each year. However, they are all dependent on your concentration which is something you declare your Junior year.\n\nThankfully, the first two years for every concentration are similar in the sense you just focus on mostly GE. Business students are highly encouraged to complete ENGL 101 and MATH 135 by the end of their first year if that helps.\n\nIf you were looking for business, there are roadmaps on the website [https://business.fullerton.edu/Programs/Undergraduate/Advising/BA\\_BusinessAdministration](https://business.fullerton.edu/Programs/Undergraduate/Advising/BA_BusinessAdministration)\n\nMake sure you look at Fall 2023-24 since you said you are an incoming freshman.\n\nThe business college also has majors in Economics and International Business too. You can find those roadmaps on their website as well.\n\nIf you are ever unsure of your major, there is the Academic Advising Center as well.",

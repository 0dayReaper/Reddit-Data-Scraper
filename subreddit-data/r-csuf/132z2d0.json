The class was asynchronous, but pretty boring, somewhat interesting, but boring, but easy doable class that doesn't require a lot. 4 mini quizzes (either 10-15 questions all M/C) you can find the quizzes/final exam on quizlet, or the lectures, one final exam no midterm, she has a optional zoom review for the mini quizzes and final exam (she gives out the answers), 1 paper (easy to do not long, she doesnt grade harsh, just watch out for grammar and proper APA citation), and 9 discussion forums (talk about the reading, you can just skim the reading, talk about it then easy points)",

There's also 1 attendance question that u have to answer after each class.\n\nHaven't taken exam yet, but for this class you need a textbook, I didn't have to buy it since someone shared pictures of it over discord, but most of the time I didn't read the book because it was what she taught in lectures.\n\nCurrently have an A, I don't pay much attention and I'm still fine with just the notes. But it is kinda boring cause she talks slow, gets distracted from the lecture, like drags on the same topic for like 15+ minutes. She also talks like she's talking to a little kid which is a little annoying, but easy class.",

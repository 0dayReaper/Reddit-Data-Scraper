They\u2019re more easier to fit on a majority of cars and plus more ppl have those three cars. But the chances of someone stealing your car is low. People are smarter than that these days..some. If anything buy a kill switch install it into your car it\u2019ll help for now. I know a lot about this stuff \ud83d\ude02",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm thinking of applying for an SI Leader position next semester because my professor recommended it to me, but I don't know much about it. If possible, I would like to know your experiences!\n\n1. What is it like being an SI leader? What tasks do you have to complete? Is it hard?\n2. Does this position create time conflicts? or have time-consuming tasks? How much time would I have to dedicate (on weekends or wtv)?\n3. How many units do you take a semester (or recommend) while balancing SI?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hello! I was an SI leader for 3 years in 2 different departments! I loved my time there and feel like all the skills I learned helped me transition to my full time career. \n1. It kept me busy and also challenged me to find new things to give my students. I was someone who was more into activities vs. worksheets. So, I would really plan lessons (which you got paid to do) and figure out how to explain/ go about it in a way that is retainable to other people.\n2. I never had to cancel or postpone plans because of SI. What\u2019s great is that I can plan AS I\u2019m in the lecture. I\u2019ve learned all this material already, so while I\u2019m in the associated class, I just think of how the professor is explaining it and how I could do it in a beginner friendly way. If I had to estimate, planning wise- 1.5 hours of planning for each session. Never planned on weekends. It also gets easier as you become more experienced. In my last semester, I would say 20 mins. \n3. I always did 12-15 units every semester. I also supported 2 sessions at one point whereas other SI leaders do one, which turned out to be 20 hours a week for SI alone, on top of being a full time student. Again, I was extremely experienced by then and it didn\u2019t inconvenience me significantly. If I didn\u2019t have SI I would probably not be as proud of my Titan pride/ go to campus often or talk proudly of my job. \n\nTLDR; do it. It\u2019s fun and makes you become an expert at your subject. Referenced it a lot during my job search after graduating and landed a job in 2 months. \n\nIf you have more questions feel free to PM me!",

            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Your tasks include going to training, weekly meetings, attending associated lecture and then most significant, planning/hosting two sessions a week. Your first semester will be tough because you (probably) have not had to plan learning activities for students.\n2. Does it create conflicts? Kinda depends how busy your schedule will be next semester or whenever. For context, you aren't supposed to log more than 10 hours in a week (bar some special event like training).\n3. Again, depends on what you're used to. I don't think taking 5 courses and working part time is a stretch, but you will be busy! Some people are crazy and take 20+ units while working... just imagine your current schedule with 10 more hours of work.\n\nIt's a fun, challenging, and very rewarding. You'll probably get a lot better as a public speaker and gain confidence too!",

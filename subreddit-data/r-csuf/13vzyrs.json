Employers must follow the steps to register with CICE as outlined in the PSYC 495 Instruction Card. If you have been employed for more than a few months at a site, you should arrange with your supervisor to participate in work that expands your use of psychological theory or methods.\u201d\n\n\nSource: [Here](https://psychology.fullerton.edu/students/intern.aspx)",

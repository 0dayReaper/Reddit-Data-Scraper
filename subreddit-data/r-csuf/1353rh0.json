    "postText": "I got a C+ in 150A. I can't repeat the class because I should have a lower grade than C-. If I try transferring it after taking it in community college, the old grade still won\u2019t be replaced. I am really stressed because of this, is there anything that I can do to in this situation?\n(I also will be applying to internships later)",

However, if CSUF is not allowing you to retake the course due to your passing grade (C+), I'm not sure if that policy also applies to transferred community college courses.\n\nIn my case, there was a lower-division course I got a D in at CSUF. I decided to retake the course at a CC, and I got an A. Once the credits transferred, the grade was averaged at CSUF. While D is a passing grade in most instances, for my particular major it was not. I needed to have gotten a C or better. So I would double-check with a counselor to make sure you can retake a course at a CC, that way you don't waste time or money",

            "comment": "I took CS 118 at West LA College in Fall 2022 with Ashok Patil and it actually wasn\u2019t too bad. Completely remote and never actually set foot on campus. Class was a breeze, video lectures each week, discussions on canvas, and a couple of programming assignments. If your program ran and did the thing, you got full credit. Same with the midterm and final projects. The only caveat is that you might need to do some independent learning\u2026but Bradley Sward on YouTube came thru clutch with expanding on concepts that I didn\u2019t fully understand. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "This is a hard question. I had Wu for 240 and he was VERY understanding and that class was definitely doable, I\u2019m usually laughably bad at code. I would only take 240 at a CC if there are only tougher professors offering the class here. Usually, I\u2019m a big advocate for taking classes at CC but 240 is (for me) required by major and also tough, so I would avoid any chance for transferring credits to go poorly. Also, there is most likely more resources (like SI) here at CSUF than there are at a CC.",

    "postText": "Ready for the dumbest question of all questions?...\n\nDo you have to transfer your undergrad transcripts _FROM_ CSUF _TO_ CSUF when applying for the masters program? Crazy question, I know. But here's why I'm asking...\n\nCSUF instructions say to transfer transcripts from all institutions after high school. It doesn't list its own institution as an exception to the rule. And we all know that the DMV actually does make you provide information that they already have on file and could look up. CSUF isn't the DMV but both are state-run entities by California. So, crazier things have happened. \n\nIf anyone has already been through this, please let me know how this went for you. Thanks.",

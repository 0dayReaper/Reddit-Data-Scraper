    "postText": "I got admitted and paid for admission but I am about to get a D in physics. Since I don't need physics to get my comp sci degree since I can take other science courses, will I get rescinded?  Even with a D, I have a GPA above the requirements and enough credits to transfer along with the golden 4 fulfilled.",

Talk to TAPP (Transfer, Adult Re-Entry, Parenting and Pregnant Students) center about it. You can also talk to Academic Advising if you can\u2019t get ahold of TAPP since they help students with their A-G requirements and any transferred/AP units!",

As long as your GPA is good, you have minimum credits transferable(60 units), and the 4 main courses taken, then you should be ok. I've gotten a D on my Econ class right before transferring as well, I still got accepted. You will have to retake that class after the transfer that's all.",

They usually show how much they pay on their fliers and on the application page.\n\n15 hours minimum of week, each shift is 3-5 hours long but you can pick which days you wanna work. Up to 20hrs if you're a student.\n\nA really nice benefit is that you can sign up for the SchoolsFirst federal credit union which is kickass and limited to school employees.",

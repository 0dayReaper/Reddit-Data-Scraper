    "postText": "i was academically disqualified and was sent the email about open university. im confused about some things and was wondering if anyone could answer a few questions.\n\n1. im currently taking summer classes at a community college. will these classes still count for university if i pass them?\n\n2. in open university how many classes are we able to take?\n\n3. how much are classes exactly? i read they might be around $300 but i\u2019m not sure.\n\n4. when can i reroll into university?\n\n5. i heard open university doesn\u2019t give financial aid, if i applied to fall 2023 classes at the community college, would i still have to let them know about university? or not anymore since im no longer a student.\n\n+ any advice for those in open university, i\u2019m not worried since i\u2019ve been taking classes at comminty college but im just stressing a little about how long it would take for me to get back into university.",

            "comment": "A class is $1,130.87 for each course. Summer classes at a CC won\u2019t help your CSUF gpa, the reason why you\u2019re disqualified. You can take 2 classes a semester at CSUF with Open university. You\u2019ll be last priority and the teacher will have to accept you into their course, it\u2019s a hell of a time. Your CC advisor should guide you. You can enroll back to csuf when your gpa will be at 2.0+. So if it\u2019s fall 2024, you can apply if you believe you\u2019ll be in good standing by that term. Good luck. It\u2019s a tough route and it took me 3 semesters to get back",

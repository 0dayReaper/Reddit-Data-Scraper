Who exactly is this person? Is there evidence to prove the existence of this person or are they just a campus legend? What first inspired the story of the Nutwood Nutter?",

If I had just parked at a different lot this wouldn't happen to me. The 4th floor is something I can't reach in parking structures anymore. Just the anticipation of someone walking between cars popping out like turning a crank on a box with a jack hanging out. The nutwood nutter is also the reason why your parking space counter is off. He steals the souls of every car passing by.",

It\u2019s pretty serious tbh and probably traumatic for the victims. I believe he was caught but can\u2019t remember. There have been a few exposition and harassment issues throughout the years all around campus and they arise occasionally. Everything from unwanted photos, unwanted romantic solicitations from non-students coming on campus hoping for something, classic expositionists, and a variety straight up physical assaults. It fuckin sucks to be a girl smh.",

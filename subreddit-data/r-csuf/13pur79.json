    "postText": "Today, the president sent out an email to students, which basically is an email attacking the articles credibility and trying to downplay the situation by attempting to \"provide (us) with some factual clarity.\" He firmly places himself as a victim, and no doubt hired a team of lawyers to craft some version of the story that makes him appear like a living, breathing saint.\n\nThis guy's self-absorbed victimized rant is just even more indicitive of who he is and how he operates, and I still cannot get over how this guy hasn't gotten fired yet.\n\nThe guy hardly even mentions the students who accused him, and does his best to make it appear like he is just as much a victim-or more so- than they are.\n\nWe need to band together and force this guy to step down before he is able to collect his nice, cushy pension at the end of the year: which, by the way, from what I understand, is for LIFE. \n\nHe's poisoned this college, and is seeking to profit off it while it rots from his gangrenous touch.\n\nFeel free to read his \"official statement\" if you can stomache it.",

The only way to even get them to look at this is to get this out to social media, get people talking about it, and maybe, just maybe, they might classify this as fired with cause.\n\nI mean, it's not like you [can come back,](https://edsource.org/updates/ex-csu-chancellor-starts-new-position-at-cal-poly-slo) right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT \" Had I been made aware of the reports and their inaccurate descriptions   \nat the time or had any of the students involved filed a complaint\"\n\nAlso false. Title IX requires that you inform all the parties involved. Sue him.",

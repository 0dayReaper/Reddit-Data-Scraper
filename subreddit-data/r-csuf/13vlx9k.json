    "postText": "I am going to join as an international graduate student this fall(MSCS). I am trying to register for courses but some of the courses which I want are full already(even the waitlist). I received my admit just a week ago(which is too late, imo) and recently came to know that we need to clear the health insurance hold on the student portal in order to register for classes(which I haven't, yet). My question is, will there be more seats for the already closed courses? Whom should I contact if the course of my choice is already full?",

Also, try to contact your course advisor too. Another option is to check to see if there\u2019re any other professors teaching the same class, so you can register them instead.",

I got to know from a friend that Titan A is usually for students in second semester or later and Titan B is for new students, which begins from July 1.",

I doubt you'll need to be an outstanding student and if the process is anything similar, you'll likely be interviewed/assessed of your ability to succeed before you're accepted. \n\nEither way, I think there's a study abroad coordinator so you should make an appointment to learn more about the process. \n\nStudy abroad was incredibly fun and I would move to the country I lived in if I could. I definitely recommend it if you can afford it.",

Im doing the CTVA 360 and HCOM 320 Barcelona trip through the College of Communications. There are many other CSUF study abroad opportunities. I also just finished up my first year:)",

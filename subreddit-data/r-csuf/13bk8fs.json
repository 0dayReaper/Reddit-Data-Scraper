    "postText": "It feels like I am back in high school. Got ambushed by a group member in the group chat to \"talk to her directly if I have anything to say to her\" and that I was ignoring her and that is making her feel \"uncomfortable\". I have never been confronted this way in my entire college career. Group then proceeded to speculate what is going on between us in the chat. All during last day of deadline. I contacted another person more often due to that person's work that is related to mine. I checked back our interaction in the group chat. She ignored my question and comment which I replied directly to her. I am not sure before or after she decided that there is apparently something between us. I just thought we didn't vibe that much but I never in good conscience avoided her. I would say I treated everyone in that group the same, always sounding out questions to all, not really tagging anyone.  \nMaybe closer to one particular person. I am sensitive. And I dread going to class now. When the other group member called me about this, I just broke down. I don't know. It feels humiliating to be called out like this. And I thought I carried a lot in this project. Any advice welcome.",

Do what you need to do to pass, you're going to forget these people later! If it were me I'd be asking her to clarify specifically what she means and give examples and sorry if I inadvertently made her feel some way but keep it professional. If you're pulling your weight in the project that's all that matters.",

I grouped with 3 girls for the final project. 1 of them was a 40 years old house wife who decided to try school again. Long story short, the 3 finish up the project without me and when I look at it. The whole thing was wrong. None of them understood cost allocation. \n\nI brought this up and the housewife accused me of \u201cplaying the leader\u201d.  I tried to explain what they did was wrong and she wouldn\u2019t listen. Behind the scene, I worked overnight to correct it and all they have to do, is putting their name on my revised project. \n\nAt the end, I told the professor in front of the whole class that I\u2019m dropping out of my group. \n\nThat housewife didn\u2019t show up for the final exam",

And when she finally opened the access 1 day later, I told her that she didn't follow the given report outline, and she sent back the same thing.  So I just revised it myself.... that apparently set her off somehow... I guess she felt I shouldn't be telling her what to do.",

You can let her know you have absolutely no bad intentions towards her, you're not sure where this is coming from and are honestly caught off guard by this message. Maybe offer to meet up in person to sort things out or else call her. Tell her it's important to you that you guys leave this semester on a good note. Maybe she'll realize that she reacted too strongly.",

You wouldn't want this person spinning out of control and going to the professor (even if it's unfair) or any problems to pop back up if you have to be in the same class together again. Never know if you're going to run into each other again. If you want to just keep it short and to the point, you could simply say, \"Um. Didn't you get my message on [X date] at [X time]? I'm not ignoring you. I reached out and didn't hear back. Is everything ok?\" (Referring to the chat history you have. Provide screenshot.) ... at the end of the day, nothing we say here is going to help unless you use the advice. It's best to go directly to that person and work it out between you. Nobody enjoys confrontation except for psychos. Just keep the tone polite and professional. If it's easier for you to put your thoughts in writing then do that. Don't get emotional even if she does. Just stick to the facts. This is good practice for life. Sorry you're having this drama. Everyone is probably just on edge because it's the end of the term.",

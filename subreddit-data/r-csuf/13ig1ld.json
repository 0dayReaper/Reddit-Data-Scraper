            "comment": "Hi! I used to work in Outreach and Recruitment and we handle orientation! I even worked orientation last year so im familiar with the process! So i\u2019m not too sure about why dates for orientation haven\u2019t opened yet, but expect your dates to be in June if you\u2019re a transfer and July if you\u2019re a freshman! Typically we do transfer orientation and then freshman orientation. You\u2019ll be registering for a day based on your major (or if you\u2019re undeclared) so you\u2019ll prob have a couple dates as an option. \n\nYou\u2019ll spend the first half of the day receiving presentations from Financial Aid, Career Center and some other small videos. Then, there\u2019s a break for an activity, lunch from 12-1, then from 1-5 you break off into your colleges! In your colleges they TYPICALLY help you with what classes you can take and what you should sign up for, as well as talk about resources for you. Whether or not you actually sit there and pick your classes is a grey area. Last year, they didn\u2019t, but since they recommend you bring a computer, just ask your orientation leader how to sign up! We have orientation leaders from many majors and you can talk to them and ask questions (they\u2019re students). This year, we weren\u2019t informed if you\u2019d be picking your classes or not - my freshman year (2019) we did, but again last year they didn\u2019t. Management is changing all the time so you never know (which might be why youve heard both yes and no). \n\nI suggest reviewing your class catalog on the Fullerton website and looking at classes you might take and ask questions at orientation. Just search CSUF (major)(concentration) classes and the course catalog for 2022/2023 will pop up as reference.\n\nHere\u2019s the public health general concentration page as an example: \n\nhttps://catalog.fullerton.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=75&amp;poid=35746&amp;hl=%22Public+Health%22&amp;returnto=search \n\nBusiness majors specifically, meet with an advisor from your Student Success Center because some classes can be notoriously hard to get or offered only once a year. Best to meet with someone and map out your upper divisions (for transfers) or all your years (freshman). \n\nFor those who take online orientation, you can take it anytime as long as u finish before the deadline (friday before fall semester begins). Your orientation link will be emailed to you or appear in your student portal within 48 hours (if not, email orientation@fullerton.edu). HOWEVER, have to complete all the modules to register for your classes if you take the online route! Then you make an appointment on your own with an academic AND/OR major advisor.\n\nWelcome to CSUF :)\n\nEdit: if orientation doesn\u2019t open for you by the end of the week, email orientation@fullerton.edu with your CWID.",

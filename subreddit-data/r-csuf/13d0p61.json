    "postText": "So I\u2019m picking my classes and while some are full I have a decent idea of what I\u2019m doing. However I\u2019m still taking physic 211 and want to apply for the next physics course however it says I don\u2019t have the prerequisite. When would a class count towards that? \n\nAlso being stupid I forgot to do my ALEKs when I started. Is there a way to do them again so I don\u2019t have to take 125? Any help would be nice.\n\nEdit: one thing I almost forgot I need a prerequisite for chem 190? I thought it was a basic course?",

They usually have you email a screenshot of your canvas grade at the end of the sem to verify. \n\nYou cant take ALEKs unless you are an incoming freshman- I was in the same boat. Just verify with a GE advisor which math you need to take to get into the math you want ( for me it was math 130, I had to take math 115)\n\nChem 190 idk but call the chem dept \n\nAll their phone numbers are googleable",

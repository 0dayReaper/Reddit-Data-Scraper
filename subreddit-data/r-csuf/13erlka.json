    "postText": "Hello I think i am going to transfer to csuf. id like to get into the computer animation and game art major. Can anyone who takes these classes tell me about the class environment? Do students work together and give good feedback? Are students focused on creating their best work? Is it a good learning environment? Are you pushed past your limits and learning new things?",

            "comment": " Im in the major.  Most classes students work individually but on the same assignment. For rigging we had to follow the professor to recreate the same rig (unless you chose to do your own game character). I believe one of the classes when you\u2019re about to graduate is a group project. There really is no group work besides that. We provide feedback in canvas discussions and you can see the development of your classmates projects. You can choose to do additional work for certain classes (rigging and 3D environment class for example). I feel the program is okay, I learned a lot but some teachers I would avoid.",

They've made sure that the US is always the first to receive their services. The UK, AU and NZ come next, then Canada and 7 other countries after. This was the case with Google Pay, YouTube Premium (formerly Red, which EVEN NOW I was lied to about, since I was told as a GPM subscriber I'd be automatically upgraded at no cost), Google Voice, Fi, and a few others.

You can't point to specific examples where Canada wasn't first and use that as evidence that Canada is never first; that's a very poor argument.  Your argument essentially is that Google doesn't favour Canada, which is just an argument to prove my statement.\n\nSince this thread is about Local Guides, let's look at the history of Maps editing.  The program/tool that proceed Local Guides, Google Map Maker, was at first specifically intended to collect data for third world countries where other sources of data were not available; but when Google decided that they wanted to become their own data supplier for all countries possible then Canada was the initial first world country it opened in; a good year and half before the US.  Similarly when that tool was shut down due to the famous peeing Android incident, it reopened in just a few test countries, Canada included, long before countries like the US.   The result of Canada being one of the first is that of the worldwide Top Contributors chosen by Google for Map Maker, four out of six were from Canada.\n\nMany other things you won't have noticed were released first in Canada in Map Maker, and that continues in Maps; for example right now the initial and only three countries in which a Local Guide (or any user) can request an address be added to the map are Canada, India and the US (it's done via the Android app).\n\nThere are hundreds of countries in the world, therefore if Google is not favouring specific countries then it's going to be rare that Canada is among the first countries for anything; so your observation that Canada is rarely first doesn't show what you think it does.",

You won't get any mass-produced pixel cases though.\n\nOSM has an open license and is used in a lot of commercial and noncommercial products. In helping OSM you'll help smaller businesses compete with Google Maps and will subsequently make *all* maps better :)",

I've been a local guide for a long time, didn't know they gave out perks anymore after they removed the Google drive perk.\n\nTo be honest, the removal of the Google drive perk bugged me, and I almost felt like it was a bait and switch.\n\n I almost started to delete my reviews and photos once my storage had run up, as I felt in principle if I got to use their services for free, and they got to use my services for free. Once it was no longer free I felt it only fair to remove my work. I didn't go this route as I put a lot of work into my reviews, and instead now support Yelp, Apple Maps, HereWeGo, etc.\n\nI feel for Google to shine it needs competition.",

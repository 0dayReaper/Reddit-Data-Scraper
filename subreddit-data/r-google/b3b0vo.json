The only actual privacy Issue I've been aware of with Chrome was the one time they included the voice recognition library (proprietary) in the FOSS build. (It wasn't enabled by default, and it was just a compile time flag that was an easy fix, and seemed by all means to just be a pretty harmless mistake.) Firefox had that issue with the Mr. Robot promo, the inclusion of the Pocket extension by default, and for a time, the whole issue with Tradmarks that led to Iceweasel. Although Google does keep Chrome and Chromium separate, they have worked actively with the FOSS community to ensure that Chromium is treated with as much care as Chrome, and is always up-to-date with Chrome. They treat Chrome as a fork of Chromium, not the other way around.",

The problem is that through an ad, these companies themselves can get a lot of info about you just by being on your screen, but that is another topic.\n\nNo, the advertiser can't get any information about you.\n\nAll reporting provided by Google back to advertisers is obfuscated so that any demographic information provided to the advertiser cannot be tied back to any individual account.\n\nYou have no idea how Google's ad business works, so here's a suggestion: Stop spouting off about it?",

Selling it is killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Why is this so hard to understand?\n\nAlso, everyone keep talking about Facebook. It's a totally valid argument tactic to keep applying everything I'm saying to a company I'm not saying it about.\n\nYour comment about the least ethical employee is idiotic. I could make the same empty statement about the governments and the EU trying to punish Google for political purposes.

It's why commercials suck so fucking much. Google says \"more relevant advertising\" because they know that you'll just hear that and think \"oh good, no more tampon ads for guys\". But companies aren't paying Google more than anyone else to not show you tampon ads, they're paying Google that much so they can hit you with a fear of being alone ad right after a breakup, or a fear of death ad right after a loved one passes. \n\nMore relevant ads, just means \"more able to fuck with your emotions\". They are in themselves a huge problem, let alone the inherent problem with any entity becoming big brother-ish / anti-competitive from controlling such an absurd amount of personal information about everyone.",

I watched basically no ads for like 5 or 6 years between going to university and shortly afterwards. All my media came from the internet and 99% of it was ad free. \n\nBut then I started getting back into basketball and watching games on tv complete with commercials and noticed that I'd feel sad afterwards and I couldn't really explain why. Eventually I streamed some games from Game Pass that don't have advertising and realized that it was just having to watch commercials that was doing it. \n\nI honestly think advertising is a much bigger detriment to people's mental health than they realize.",

Sure, that's technically true. Everything in the universe is unique. But a lot of cars still share many common features and functions. Just like our brains. \n\nNeither one of our stories has evidence to back it up.

Even if they do log the encrypted packets, they'll never be able to decrypt them.\n\n&gt;A 256bit encryption is the mathematical equivalent of 2256 key possibilities. To put that into perspective, 232 is about 4.3 billion, and it keeps growing exponentially after that. What does this mean though? Well simply put, let\u2019s say hypothetically all the super computers in the world (the ultimate brute force attack) decided to group up and tasked themselves to decrypt your AES-256 key so they could access your data.\n\n&gt;Assume they could look at 250 keys per second (which is approximately one quadrillion keys/second \u2013 a very generous assumption). A year is approximately 31,557,600 seconds. This means that by using the one billion super computers required to do this, they could check about 275 keys per year. At this rate it would take these computers 234 years (the age of our universe) to look at less than .01% of the entire key possibilities. **The bottom line? No one will be breaking your encrypted data.**\n\n[Source](https://blog.v-comply.com/256-bit-encryption/)",

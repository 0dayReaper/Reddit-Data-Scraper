I open the app today it asks if I want to use an account, I said no thank you and then all of my MFA codes gone. I noticed this just now (28 May 2023).\n\nDoes anyone have any updates on this? Seriously Google how do you want us to use your products if you can't be reliable on something SO SERIOUS as MFA codes! I need these for work this is not a joke.\n\nI saw someone comment that it might just be a UI bug and an update could fix it - I bloody well hope so!",

Do they sync?\n\nMost of my 2FAs have to do with financial stuff, so being able to regain access is essential, and having once lost my GAuth codes I managed to eventually get back in thanks to Google's support and ID verification. What happens if I lose the codes in one of the other apps?",

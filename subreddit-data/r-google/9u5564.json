It was a very common issue where every time you turned the camera app on the stabilizer would go nuts for like 5 seconds before it finally figured itself out and worked as normal lol. Until it corrected itself the entire screen would be shaking like mad trying to compensate for what it perceives to be you taking a picture in a paint mixer. It was actually physically loud it shook so much. I used the warranty on my phone to get a brand new one and the same exact thing began happening a month later. I didn't bother to RMA again because the issue always resolved itself on the phone so I decided to just deal with it, although my one RMA was much smoother than yours as they overnighted a phone to me",

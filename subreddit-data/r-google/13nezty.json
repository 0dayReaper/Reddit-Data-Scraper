That's just inconceivable. \n\nThis is proof that Google is censoring the information that's available to internet users. \n\nIt's time to get rid of this internet and come up with internet 2.0 that has no corporate control.\n\nBut if somebody can find the answer to what I searched for, that'd be great. I honestly would like to know. Thanks",

I'm not an idiot. \n\nAnd it is inconceivable that the ENTIRE internet has nothing that matches those exact words in that exact order. Think about it. Covid began 2020ish. So if I put by year, that means more than one year so any posts past 2021 could potentially have those words. Meaning for the past 2 years, no one anywhere has posted those exact words according to Google. I don't buy it.",

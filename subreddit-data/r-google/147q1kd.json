    "postText": "Okay, so I am leaving a Google Workspace school as as teacher.\n\nTo be clear, this post is about the Google Transfer process where Google copies your files/folders over to another Google Drive. It's not about the Takeout where you download them yourself. I initially was going to use Takeout, but then saw Google Workspace had the option to transfer my files over directly instead of me going through and manually uploading my Takeout files. So, I decided to try that instead of using Takeout. NOTE: I MADE SURE I ONLY SELECTED GOOGLE DRIVE TO TRANSFER. IT'S NOT TRANSFERRING PHOTOS OR EMAIL ETC. \n\nWell, this was a mistake. Yesterday, I had 120 Gigs of files in my personal Drive (not all Google platforms, just Drive). It was in the process of moving my files, so the drive space was increasing as expected. I assumed it would finish soon to match the 140G I had in my Workspace Drive. Today, I checked, and I have 250G now in my personal Google account, and will be double by the end of today. It's still adding more files and is not done. Who knows how much more it will add since there is no actual progress bar to see? I had only about 10GB in there before that was just my personal account files, so I am taking that into account. It is ballooning storage well beyond what I had in my Workspace Drive.\n\nWhat the heck is going on?!\n\nIt should only be copying the amount I have over, not doubling or tripling that.\n\nAlso, this tool was supposed to create a neat little folder with everything in it. It made that folder, but it's also putting files everywhere. It will take months to straighten up this mess.\n\nDo not ever use Google transfer! Just use Takeout.\n\nLearn from my mistake.",

This increased my google photo data from 200 GB to 350 GB. May be something like that is going on for you and well. If that is the case, then you'll see many duplicate files after you uncompress zip files.",

I didn't see that much of a difference because the Android ecosystem would still exist without Nexus/Pixel phones, so one would've hoped that WearOS would do as well as Android. Unfortunately it did not. :/\n\nAlso, for history buffs, when I said that Microsoft was working on smartphones from the start, I was referencing Windows CE and its successors. [This model](http://phonedb.net/index.php?m=device&amp;id=116&amp;c=t-mobile_mda__htc_wallaby) is from the first half of 2002 and [this one](http://phonedb.net/index.php?m=device&amp;id=432&amp;c=cyberbank_pc-ephone) is from March of 2001. To me, the HTC Wallaby from the first link (2002) doesn't look that different from a [first-gen iPhone](https://storage.googleapis.com/a1comms-blog-buymobiles/1/2014/09/iPhone-1st-Generation.png).\n\nIf those could be described as \"Microsoft doing smartphones\" (which I think people would agree with, since Microsoft is a platforms/services company and doesn't actually need to produce hardware for them to have \"done\" something) then I think it's fair to describe WearOS as Google having done smartwatches, since they are a platforms/services company too and it's not required for them to build hardware.",

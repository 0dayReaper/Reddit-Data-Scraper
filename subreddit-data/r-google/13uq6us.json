Hacker locks you out of your Google account, or Google bans you for some reason: **only Mirror will help**\n3. Ransomware corrupts your files: if the virus accessed the files in such a way that the encrypted copies are uploaded to Drive, then **neither will help you if you don\u2019t notice the problem within 30 days**, since I understand that\u2019s how long Drive will store versions. https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2409045 You\u2019ll have a tedious job restoring everything.  Also, since the virus has access to your Google Drive account through your computer, if it\u2019s smart, it\u2019s possible it could do more damage that you can\u2019t recover.\n\nTL;DR: use Mirror, and also consider other dedicated backup services that will keep file versions longer.  There are lots of Cloud services with cheap/free tiers, or you could use an external hard drive that you plug in once a week, for example.\n\nAlso, use 2FA and keep your account recovery keys in a safe place.",

Do I want to be able to access my drive if my internet connection goes down?\n3. Do I want to have access to a local copy of my drive in the case that I get locked out of my Google account?\n\n\n\nIf your answer is \"yes\" to any of these questions you should pick Mirror, otherwise Stream will suffice.",

It'll download all of your documents (once) and you'll be able to access them whenever, since you'll have a local copy of them.  Any changes you make will be uploaded and synced to the cloud copy when possible.  This option will eat up some storage space on your local device, but will also potentially require less bandwidth.  \n\nWith the Streaming option, every time you access one of your files, you're downloading it from the Drive server.

On mobile, given less available storage, and I selectively keep copies of current working documents only.  The option to keep everything local will need to be revisited when my cloud storage exceeds the space available locally. I will also need to rethink my current backup strategy at that time.\n\nJust remember - if your only complete copy of your information is on the cloud, long term backups aren't usually part of the deal and the limits for recovering from user error are short.  Evaluate the backups provided, and supplement them if needed.",

So an OTP Code was sent to the recovery email account I added  but I don't have access to it  too.    please who can help me.",

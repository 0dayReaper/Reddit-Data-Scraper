So when someone tries to ring me on my Pixel 7 Pro , it rings perfectly on my end but the caller is saying \"I dialled your number but it wasn't ringing or making a dial tone noise and then you picked up the phone\" this is feedback I'm getting predominantly from callers with iPhones . Anyone else ever heard of this",

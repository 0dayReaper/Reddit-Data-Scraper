I seriously think this is the next evolution of search. It's sort of like the internet got so complicated in the recent years that we now need an AI to go through it when searching stuff or else it takes a long time.\n\nI've used it a few times with stuff I specialize in and I have yet to see it hallucinate something. It's surprisingly accurate and detailed.\n\nWhat do you think about it?",

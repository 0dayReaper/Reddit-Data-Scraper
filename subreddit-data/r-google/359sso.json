But to use an extreme example (but probably one that has spurred Google's recent design rebirth attempts), Apple fundamentally *cares* about design. \n\nYou take an X-ray of an Apple device and the internals will actually be aesthetically pleasing (on top of being highly functional). That's true design obsession, and while it does seem psychopathic, it's what has allowed Apple to reap incredible profit margins. \n\nGoogle is trying to half-ass the same thing and it's like a teenager hitting puberty. I wish them the best of luck, but HoloUI was the same awkward coming of age, with an even simpler concept and a more limited range of applications. ",

I think from the few pieces of hardware Google has let out, the design is very slick as well, at least for the price.  \n   \nBut in terms of UI design, Google is far ahead in terms of usability at the moment. Apple's current flat design is just plain not intuitive. At this point I'm not sure why we are comparing the two though. Apple has talented designers, Google has talented designers. I think they both put positive pressure on each other to continue improving.",

Their love of hiding menus under abstract symbols baffles me. If they picked one symbol and methodology and stuck to it, that would be OK. For a menu, is it a cog, three nameless horizontal lines, or vertical ellipses? Do they go on the top left or the top right, or somewhere random? Does the Back symbol go on the left or the right? How do you know where find features of a Material Design app? You click random things (that may or may no be clickable) to find out which ones are hiding what you are looking for.",

The fact that it reroutes depending on traffic conditions is nice and all, but I don't always want to drive down back roads and through strange neighborhoods when I'm on a road trip. Google Maps is my preferred choice for this because it sticks to the best, and most trusted route. It also has lane assist and makes life easier when I am unsure what lane to get in.",

In most cases, cell tower info and wi-fi points do the bulk of the heavy lifting, which is why location resolution improves dramatically when wi-fi is enabled.\n\nThe obvious exception to this is when cell towers and wi-fi points aren't available, such as mountain roads (in which case, GPS data will do the heavy lifting). \n\nIf you have a pure GPS receiver (without the benefit of cellular towers/wifi), you'll notice it takes much longer to get a fix from GPS satellites. So practicality is why cell/wi-fi info gets pulled in for smartphones. ",

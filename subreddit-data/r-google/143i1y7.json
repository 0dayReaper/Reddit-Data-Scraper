Back when Google would build products for fun and really were innovating to find the next \"big thing\". With advancements in tech, with society more comfortable with outwardly interacting with technology (speaking to your phone, paying with it, dancing like an absolute idiot for likes... Etc), and with Ai reaching the points it's at... It feels like the perfect time for a Google Glass 2.0",

Google is run by hired CEO who has his salary tied to stock price after next earnings call. \n\nJust recent news - mandatory 3 day at the office policy announced. Book keepers are running Google",

I remember the biggest issue with glass was people recording and it not displaying a light to indicate it lol\n\nI still think it was decades ahead of its time and a shame Google didn't continue to support the tech",

Twitter doesnt use any sort of advanced AI or anything, the Missing and Exploited Children place maintains a GIGANTIC database of all known/reported abuse images (I believe its over 32 million at this point) in a hashed format. All twitter or any other social media network does is hash uploaded images and compare the hash to the database. Bare minimum.",

You'd make topics of things you were interested in, invite friends who shared that interest, and then shared articles, left comments, etc. \n\nHere's why it worked so well:. Let's say i had ten friends. Nine are interested in baseball and 8 are interested in soccer etc etc. Even if there's overlap, the spaces were useful because someone may not want to read about soccer NOW. There were topics that I only cared about once a month, or when I reached the end of the internet. And when I got to that point I could jump right in.\n\nI'm old so my most used form of communication is email. Friends also text random stuff for me to read. That all gets lost very quickly.

They'll use this in negotiations for renewals, cancellations, etc. \n\nThis isn't unusual. \n\nThe only thing different is that it's Google, Elon and Twitter which is almost always going to be in the news.",

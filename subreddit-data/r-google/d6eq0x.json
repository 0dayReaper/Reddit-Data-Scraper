The device start leaking a few weeks before release, which is when they have to ship out the finished devices to the stores, to prepare inventory so they can start selling the day it's announced. Similarly, they have to send out promo images/videos to mobile carriers so they can prepare their websites on the day of announcement. Any employee at these stores/mobile carriers can leak it unless there's very strict safety procedures.",

Otherwise it's not gonna work unfortunately :/\nI would try contacting customer service, or seeing if it wants you to turn on 2-step verification. I had the problem for the longest time of Google wanting me to turn on 2-step verification, but since I didn't have a phone I was literally unable to sign in on any other device other than my home laptop. It sucked. Lo siento si es el caso, amigo :/",

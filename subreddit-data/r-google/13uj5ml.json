While it might generate some clicks, but it never be good in long term.\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on sharing daily news within the right subs. It also a good idea to start a Twitter account and push AI news there.\n\nBecause it's obvious to everyone who sees the link under your post that you're engaged in link farming. So Instead, you could declare that is your blog and provide a good reason to click on the link.\n\nKeep sources in the main post and do something else to collect clicks maybe offering a free ChatGPT course or selling something your good at. And since people thinks you\u2019re an AI expert, conversion rates will be higher.\n\nGood luck",

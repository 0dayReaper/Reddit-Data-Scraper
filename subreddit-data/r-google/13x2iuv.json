            "comment": "Google Maps/Local Guide: A  week ago I noticed I was getting closer and closer to nearing a high  threshold cap on data. So google was recommending me to use the storage  saver. Nothing on it says that it would affect google maps/contribution.  So I clicked it.\n\nI was with a friend recently and was  trying to show him pictures of other spots I'd been to. I thought it odd  I didn't see anything from a recent restaurant on the app itself. I  then got a sinking feeling. Everything I've done for the past 8 years,  gone. My reviews and stats are still there but when I swipe to the left  to the end where it would usually show \"My photos\" when I had selected a  place, nothing. The pictures are still in the storage device but  there's no way I could think about trying to re-upload 8 years worth of  stuff. Plus it would feel like semi cheating with the points.\n\nI  did write down my view numbers down to compare them after a day and  they only went up because I had looked at them manually. So they aren't  available to see when one would scroll through pictures about a place.\n\nI've  been lvl 10 for many years now so points don't mean much to me and I  was mostly trying to aim for 1 Billion views. With this issue now I no  longer have that drive, just defeatism. Is there anyway of UN-storage  saver? Would my photos even go back up on the contributions?\n\nI  tried looking up google help numbers but there doesn't seem to be  anything to call. Just the help/feedback settings. The two numbers I did  call were to google and as soon as I asked about Maps, they just said  wrong number and hung up on me.",

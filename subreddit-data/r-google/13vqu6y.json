Google has been an AI first company since 2017 and the biggest breakthrough in AI in the last decade or longer and what makes LLMs possible.  Transformers with attention.   That is totally in Google's wheelhouse.  Google was already using a LLM for Search with BERT and now have added PaLM2 to Search.   Clearly core to Google.\n\nBut it is not the only example.  There are tons and tons and tons of others.   Look at what Google did with running infrastructure with Borg and containers.   Google is who literally added the code to the Linux kernel to make containers possible.  \n\nGoogle did this allowing everyone to do what they do.   Another perfect example is Borg.  That was worth so much money.  But Google just shares it to everyone through K8S.\n\nThere is example after example.\n\nGoogle does NOT go after companies that use their IP.\n\nBTW, you also might look up who invented GANs.   Another incredible breakthrough by Google that they just let everyone use for free.",

AI research supports it but they won\u2019t open source all of it, there will be aspects of it that must remain closed for the reasons of maintaining a competitive advantage. The only way Google attracts the top AI researches is if it lets them publish their research and get credit for it, so it\u2019s a delicate balance. \n\nKubernetes container orchestration is a great way for a customer to move away their workload from AWS (who has the biggest market share by far) over to GCP.",

That means that things that are alike should be the same, but it also implies that things that are *not* alike should *not* be the same.\n\nThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like these new icons: they all use the same colors, so at a glance it\u2019s difficult to discern them from one another. That would be fine if they were alike, but they\u2019re all completely different apps.",

They all had the same play icon background shape to keep them tethered to the Play Store icon. From there, they applied an overlay icon unique to the apps purpose, and used varying colors to further distinguish them. All uniform, consistent, and unique, but does Google do? Throw away the whole design philosophy, and either rebrand or phase out half of the apps. I can't wrap my head around it.",

Fluent design is still new and unique enough, but also the Office icons have a unified style and are differentiated by a unique color and letter for each one.",

Like easily catch a Chromebook in the middle of a computer store full of various laptops. But it make each individuals products less unique.\n\nAlso, I loved how Google kept on having a product for a function, and connections between products. Like Agenda, gmail, Keep, Tasks... vs a all-in-one overkill MS Outlook that is one app for all that stuff. I don't need to open the whole app just to check a mail.",

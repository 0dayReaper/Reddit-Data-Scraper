Yes it's easy to access chat, but there's something that keeps pulling me toward the website over Bing and it's, earn coins for checking in every day and play games like a sketchy asian app that's only trying to collect ad revenue (which I do.) They're clearly trying to collect more data with things like scan your receipt as well.\nI know their usage has gone up exponentially and will continue to do so.\nHopefully, Google's PaLM2 AI does a better job.",

This is a huge blow to Google, as it means that ChatGPT will now be able to provide more accurate and up-to-date information to users.\n\nChatGPT is a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and it can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\n\nBing is a search engine developed by Microsoft. It is the second most popular search engine in the world, behind Google.\n\nThe integration of ChatGPT with Bing will allow users to ask ChatGPT questions about current events and get real-time answers. This will be a huge advantage for ChatGPT, as it will allow it to provide more accurate and up-to-date information than Google.\n\nThis is a major blow to Google, as it will make it more difficult for Google to compete with ChatGPT. Google is still the most popular search engine in the world, but ChatGPT is quickly gaining popularity. With the integration of Bing, ChatGPT is now a major threat to Google's dominance in the search engine market.",

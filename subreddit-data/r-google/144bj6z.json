    "postText": "I signed up for Google Workspace Labs a few days ago and was accepted the same day. Now within Gmail I have the Help Me Write icon down the bottom section when composing an email and works fine.\n\nBut it is also supposed to be in Google Docs, looking soem articles about it, I should have a pill-shaped box with 'Help Me Write' inside it. Which like Gmail will then help with the writing.\n\nBut I have never received or get this, tried to make sure I am full screen, on different browsers, restarted my machine and made sure the browsers are upto date. I am logged into Google Drive and can start new documents fine, but do not receive this option for help via the 'Help Me Write' box.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn suggestions on resolving this.",

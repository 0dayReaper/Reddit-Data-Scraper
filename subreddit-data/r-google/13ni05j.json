            "comment": "Google Play Points have not disappeared. However, Google has made some changes to the program. As of May 1, 2023, you can no longer earn points for making in-app purchases. You can still earn points for other activities, such as:\n\n* **Loyalty:** Earn points for making eligible purchases on Google Play.\n* **Quests:** Complete challenges to earn bonus points.\n* **Promotions:** Earn points for participating in special promotions.\n\nTo see how many points you have and how to redeem them, open the Google Play Store app and tap on your profile picture. Then, tap on **Play Points**.\n\nIf you are still having trouble earning points, you can try the following:\n\n* Make sure that you are signed in to the same Google account on all of your devices.\n* Make sure that you have the latest version of the Google Play Store app installed.\n* Clear the cache and data for the Google Play Store app.\n* Uninstall and reinstall the Google Play Store app.\n\nIf you are still having trouble, you can contact Google Play support for help.\n\nHere are some additional tips for earning Google Play Points:\n\n* **Set up automatic payments:** You can earn bonus points for setting up automatic payments for your Google Play subscription.\n* **Subscribe to Google One:** You can earn bonus points for subscribing to Google One, which gives you more storage space for your photos, videos, and files.\n* **Participate in promotions:** Google often runs promotions that give you bonus points for making purchases or completing challenges.\n\nBy following these tips, you can earn more Google Play Points and redeem them for rewards, such as:\n\n* **Google Play credit:** You can use Google Play credit to buy apps, games, movies, books, and more from the Google Play Store.\n* **Gift cards:** You can use gift cards to buy products from a variety of retailers.\n* **Hardware:** You can use points to redeem discounts on Google hardware, such as the Pixel phone or the Google Nest Wifi.",

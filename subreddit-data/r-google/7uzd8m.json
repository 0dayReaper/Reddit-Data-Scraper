Jfc that's irritating. The address says 123 MAIN ST, why dies Google have me go to the alley with a different name behind the person's house?",

It turned out to be a one lane gravel road probably on someone's private land, as it went through an open road gate. I was going to turn back but there were a number of other vehicles going down this route, so I figured it was probably a legitimate shortcut. After a couple miles the gravel turned to mud, and I was fortunate to have a vehicle that could handle that, but I could easily have gotten stuck in another car. I saw an exit that a few cars headed towards, and decided I'd had enough of this and followed. It turned out that this exit also had a gate, and this one was locked. As there were tightly packed loblolly pines all around the roads, there was no way around it either. Myself and the other cars made tight 10+ point turns and sauntered off back to the original path. \n\nAfter another mile down, we came across vehicles in the other direction. They had made it to the end, and found no glorious shortcut to avoid the 4 mile 45 minute delay, but more gates, all of them locked. We made more tight turns, and returned, defeated, back to the original gate, back to where we all got off the highway, to find that all of the congestion had cleared, as this ordeal had taken about an hour.",

About thirty minutes in Waze suddenly tells me to take the next exit. It was so random and middle of nowhere that I obeyed the directions without question and ended up driving for over two hours with scenic views and vistas of farming country I thought only existed in Kansas. It was glorious.\n\nThe most amusing part though was Waze brought me back to the highway hours and at least a hundred miles later and as I rolled down the onramp there were two overturned big rigs holding up miles of stopped traffic.

Round a bend and the road ends at the shore of an actual fucking pond. Fortunately I was going slow over the bumpy road or Carl might have been pretty pissed off at me for poisoning his pond.\n \nI want to find my way back there someday in late summer or fall to see if the pond disappears and reveals an actually road through it.

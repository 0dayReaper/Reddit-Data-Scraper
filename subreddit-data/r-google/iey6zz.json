Everything for Apple revolves around that iPhone, and having iPhone functionality spread to their other devices. But for Google, it's about their cross-platform unity. So having Duo and Meet is an added layer of confusion.\n\nAdding to that, Google isn't competing with Facetime with Meet and Duo, they're competing with Zoom and with Teams.

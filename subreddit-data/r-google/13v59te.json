The company where I work sends all off its internet traffic out through a small number of addresses. If any computer is sending unusual traffic, all may get that pop up if a site uses that protection system.  It is very common when tickets go on sale for popular events in the area - if 50 people in the office try to sign up at the same tile it looks like a program trying to get into the site from a few machines machine.\n\nUsually nothing to worry about",

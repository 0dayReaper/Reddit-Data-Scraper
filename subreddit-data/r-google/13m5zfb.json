You need people using your search engine so you have data coming in to learn from.\n\nMobile search is different from desktop.   Google owns mobile search.\n\nhttps://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/worldwide",

This is going to be the most incredible thing.\n\nIt will work with your own documents that you have on Google Drive.  So for example I keep a journal and have for over 30 years now.  I can load that in and then ask questions.\n\nBut it will also work over all your documents including sheets, docs, etc.\n\nhttps://tailwind.withgoogle.com/about",

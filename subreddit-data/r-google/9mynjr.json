And they included a chin. It's seems they realise this by adding the option for a virtual bezel.\n\nThe reason for this is that major design decision need to be finalised in advance. Last year, this time Google probably felt that a notch was a good idea, but as they began to see the poor reception it was too late to change it. \n\nSo yes, notches are a trend and I wouldn't be surprised if slim bezels don't come back.",

Your options at this point are to either give the space on either side of the sensors a small bit of utility by putting the system icons up there, which may or may not be useful in practice; or you can leave it as dead space, which may or may not make the phone more aesthetically pleasing.  \n\nMy point is that the overall impact of half an inch of space at the very top of the phone is so minuscule that I don\u2019t see why it matters at all.

Today it\u2019s the same story with the 3rd gen Pixel, now with HTC as part of the Google design team. They just aren\u2019t good at hardware. \n\nTo be honest, I like some chin on the bottom. The one on Poxel 3 is not too bad. It gives lots of room to hold onto the phone with a few fingers in uneasy angles, and most importantly, it\u2019s more ergonomic because the thumb doesn\u2019t have to travel longer distance while navigating. \n\nThat notch, tho... \n",

I get the compromise of the notch so I don't have a full notification bar and they don't get a proper bezelless screen, so what's the point?",

Other phones have proven that non front facing, stereo speakers can be both loud and clear, and more than enough for personal use. While front facing speakers are better, they're not better by a large enough margin to be a suitable replacement for a \"proper\" speaker, or even a laptop with decent quality speakers. It simply isn't loud enough for medium-large groups/parties/events/etc. \n\nGoogle has made some design choices with this phone that I'm not sure I agree with. I think side speakers and a slimmer notch would both have been better received. Nice front facing audio quality is nice, but realistically I almost never play music through my phone's speakers anyways and when I do the side speakers have always been more than enough. ",

One other minor positive of this is that it will be easier to hold the phone in landscape mode without obstructing the screen or supporting the phone's weight on your pinky. Obviously this would muffle the speakers, but personally I almost always use my headphones anyways so that wouldn't be an issue. This makes watching movies, playing landscape mode games, and things like that easier and more ergonomic.\n",

So I just want something that actually looks great. The Pixel line (to me at least) just looks boring and uninspired.\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not \"anti notch\", some phones have a notch and still look great. The Pixel3 though is not one of them.\n\n",

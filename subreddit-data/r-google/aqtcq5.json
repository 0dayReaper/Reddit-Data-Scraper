Can find it on either XDA or Aptoide. \n\nEDIT: I normally don't make these kinds of edits saying EDIT (it doesn't show you edited the comment so, what's the point of saying edit...?) but I did want to clarify a few things...\n\nIf you're sick of seeing ads throughout other apps such as Snapchat, get Blokada.  This is a free and open source app that can be found on their website.  This app also blocks 3rd party trackers as well AND it supports Cloudflares 1.1.1.1.  Did I mention it's free?  USING THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH YT VANCED CAN TRIGGER YT VANCED TO TURN ON RESTRICTED MODE. Whitelisting this app for a day or two and then unwhitelisting it does the trick.\n\nTo install YT Vanced and/ or Blokada you'll need to enable allow permissions from unknown sources (as much as I wanna assume people know this, someone out there didn't know that so, yee)\n\nIf you want to use YT Vanced while signed into your YT account, you'll need to install MicroG.  It's a small little plugin found on the XDA forum page.  It's a 1 time download, will never need an update (as far as I can tell) and it doesn't show up as an app.  Only time you'll see it is if you go to settings-&gt; accounts and you'll see an outdated Google logo.  That's microG.  \nYT Vanced DOES NOT save your watch history (someone else already pointed that out. Personally, I love this.  You might not) HOWEVER, YT Vanced does save your likes videos to your playlists, etc., do with that as you will.\nOn the XDA page, you can install different themes for YT Vanced such as black (best for OLED and AMOLED screens) as well as pink, blue, and a bunch of colors.  These are only found on the XDA forum page.  The only color that is found on Aptoide is black (coincidentally, this version is newer than any of the other XDA versions).\n\nHope this clears up a few things and questions some or many of you might have.  Have fun out there! :). I'll be sticking around to answer questions!\n",

Day/night switching happens when the system is selecting resources to use based on whatever the app has set - this happens before the activity is rendered and can therefore be used to specify dark backgrounds or a dark style inside styles.xml when night mode is on. After looking it up, night mode was added in API level 8 so there's no real reason for any of Google's apps to not be using it.\nSee here: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources#AlternativeResources",

And nothing, would represent the associated gps coordinates.",

As I mentioned before, coordinates are derived information, not a definition of a place.\n\nGDPR doesn\u2019t say they have to export all internal or derived metadata about the place you saved. It just needs to be enough info to represent your data (the entity you saved) into an exportable format. The place name is that info.\n\nThe word \u201cLondon\u201d is enough to paste into OpenStreetMap to pull up that entity (where, incidentally, you can find its [complex entity-based definition](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/175342) - not a single coordinate).\n\nWhat you\u2019re trying to do is *geocode* places. You should use a different approach for that, like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap APIs.",

For Google, at least, we're all customers from searching, so we should all be concerned that the end of Net Neutrality will affect our search results.\n\nThese software giants are global so people across the world can start to pressure these companies to join in. Having large companies join in would be a large boon to the Net Neutrality movement, and having people from around the world pressuring them to support Net Neutrality would be very important and helpful, if not critical.\n\nConsider contacting your local reporters to have them look into companies stances on Net Neutrality to help put pressure on the companies to support it.\n\nThanks for helping!\n",

ISPs can't only deliver contents for 1 or 2 particular websites. Of course both Netflix and ISPs are being greedy here but ISPs have limited network infrastructures and other physical resources. \nMy understanding of all this is that it is to \"punish\" (for the lack of a better word) websites like netflix, youtube and facebook and that ISPs want to change this (charge those websites in someway). And yes I can understand that ultimately consumers are being affected, whether by getting slower speed or by having to pay lots of money for a decent connection.  ",

(I may be simplifying some details for the sake of brevity and it has been a little while since I have done a bunch of research on it.)\n\nAnother scenario involves one's power in the market to nudge consumers towards their alternative. As an example, you may be aware that Netflix produces its own shows. This is, at the moment only hypothetical (because they can't legally), however not completely unlikely.\n\nSay Comcast comes out with their new movie streaming service. Because streaming requires a relatively stable connection, there is an incentive for Comcast to throttle Hulu or throttle Netflix in order to boost the sales of their own streaming service.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, this is less of an issue (although still one), but as it stands, many places in the United States see either almost or full monopolies on access to the internet.\n\nI hope that explains it well enough.",

This is about a company deciding they don't want to serve up data for a plethora of reasons. It can be Comcast wants you to use their streaming service so they throttle Netflix. It could be Time Warner want you to see their news source and obstruct access to competing sites.\n\nThis is done in the wake of ISPs lobbying to limit competition in challenging markets, effectively creating many micro-monopolies.

The govt is stating ISPs have to provide fair access through the utility provided to your house.\n\nIf GE owned the power lines to your house, and wanted to only use that power to enable GE branded appliances in your house. But the government stated the power lines are a regulated utility, and GE had to power any appliance in your house, you would be all for the government mandating a fair and equitable delivery of power to your house. Because in the end you can't just disconnect GE and use some other power company.\n\nHere, the government \"intrusion\" is them demanding all sites are treated equally by the ISP.\n\nListen, if we consumers had access to a dozen providers and this was a method to free up bandwidth and provide us with better service, I'd be all for it. But it's not. We have been limited to one or two providers because of their lobbying power. They are now using their consolidated and heavy handed power grab to initiate phase 2 - and start controlling the content you can receive from their lines.\n\nIt is nothing short of big business using your fears to get their way.

You need to dig deeper to understand. They aren't trying to stop censorship. They are censorship. They already censor all over the web. They already censor media from trending on social media. They tell us some links are fake news. Hell, they censor us on this website right now. The hypocrisy is overwhelming. The censorship is here. What people don't get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN? It's real simple. They will selectively enforce. They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents. Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses. Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse. Don't give me some bs link about some isp in Canada. Also, all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections. Right now we need to get rid of the title 2 regulations so people can get more service provider options. Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch.\n\nThere is an end game here. It is not just what you see right now on the front page. Remove NN, remove title 2, allow more ISPs to compete, if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic. That is the real plan, not reddit's bullshit. And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say it's better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office. We aren't going to let them control everything. Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN.",

IE when Net Neutrality is repealed all of the large ISPs are off the hook for not upgrading it with that money. Maybe if Google wasn't aware of this they can start the process of bringing people to court and or asking the government for these funds to deploy their fiber? It shouldn't take much effort from Google to look at what they spent deploying their fiber and to be able to say to these people in the government, \"Hey if you gave us $500 billion dollars the internet would be a million times better than it is today\". As it is the FCC is leaning on the statement that the internet cannot be sustained as it is today, maybe because $500 billion dollars have been spent fraudulently.",

NN has actually helped stop google from expanding google fiber (ask Louisville, Ky)  because under title 2, ISP's are allowed to operate as utilities (read monopolies) and are allowed to not cooperate or share their service lines to maximize their ability to service their existing base. (their excuse) the FCC allows utilities to do this.\n\nGoogle Fiber will probably expand more freely when this is gone.  Because the ISP will lose their ability to keep out competition.  However they wil have more flexibility over their own products.  \n\nGood and Bad.      ",

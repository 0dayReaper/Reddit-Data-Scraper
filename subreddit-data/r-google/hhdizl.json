For example, they made their \"grinning face\" emoji (which is the official Unicode name) look like a grimacing face, which was the source of endless headaches for me with an Android phone and my family who all have iPhones. I would try to send a grinning face to tell them I was excited about something, and they would all ask what was wrong. Similarly, they made their dizzy face emoji have Xed out eyes like a dead person, which they still haven't changed, and they made the \"woman with bunny ears\" emoji two people instead of one.\n\nThe other issue is that they made a handful of emoji too specific, so \"dancing person\" became a woman in a dress dress doing a flamenco dance, but only on Apple devices, so other people would send their generic dancing person emoji, but on an Apple device it would show up as a very specific woman in a red dress doing a flamenco dance. Another example is how they made the ghost emoji winking with its tongue sticking out, or the poop emoji with a face that's smiling, or the gun emoji as a squirt gun, or the \"milky way\" emoji, which for some reason they decided to show as a framed picture of the milky way instead of just the milky way itself. While these representations aren't necessarily bad, they are bad for compatibility reasons, and unfortunately the only solution has been for the other companies to all cave and adopt the Apple emoji, forcing Unicode to actually change the descriptions on some of the characters.",

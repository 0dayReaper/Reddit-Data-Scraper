    "postText": "Hello,\n\nAs you may know we linked everyone who had a technical question to the MegaThread or r/Google Discord server.\n\nIt may came to your attention that the Discord server is no longer available and on this moment I am not able to give information about when the server will come back to the public. Behind the scenes we are working hard on a rebuild and new branding, for now you'll need to use the Support MegaThread.\n\nI'll try to answer the questions where I can, since I am limited in information I can share not every question might be answered.\n\nThank you.\n\nSince there is a limit of two pinned posts, the [Google Employee Layoff MegaThread](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/10iby8p/google_employee_layoff_megathread/) has been unpinned.  \n\n\n**Update as per 30 April:**  \nWe are no longer linked to r/Google on Discord, but if you want to join the Discord server and say hi to me: [https://discord.gg/techcollective](https://discord.gg/techcollective)",

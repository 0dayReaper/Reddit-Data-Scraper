Sounds, images, video, etc.\n\nSo ideally if an \"AI\" calls you then there would be something on the phone that makes you aware that it is an AI.\n\nYou are on Reddit and there is an AI image that it indicates as such.\n\nI prefer it did it for me.  Some people would have an issue with that so it would be good if it gave you the option to turn off.",

Later this year, you\u2019ll also be able to use it by right-clicking or long-pressing on an image in Chrome on desktop and mobile. \u201d\n\n\nNot enough to stop the problem imo. Many people won't bother to use an optional feature and instead take the image at face value. I hate to say we need watermarks that can't be ignored :(",

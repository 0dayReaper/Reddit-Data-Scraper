We now get pics of pretty girls and cats - but not what we really wanted to find out in the first place ...\n\nAdd to this horrible UI decisions such as in-pop-ups like \"other people also searched for xyz\". I never understood why it would matter to me what OTHER people searched for. It's a UI downgrade.",

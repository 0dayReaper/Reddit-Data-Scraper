My TV, a TCL brand Roku TV, won't turn on/off if I just tell Google to \"turn on TV\", etc. It has to be \"Turn on *the* TV\" or \"Turn on *the* Living Room TV\" for some reason. It's maddening!\n\n(And yeah, I could fix this with a routine, but meh... I shouldn't *have* to)",

Without the \u2018the\u2019, TV is related to \u2018on\u2019 as an object of preposition - the thing a preposition is pointing to. Including \u2018the\u2019 makes it so that \u2018the TV\u2019 is related to \u2018turn\u2019 as a direct object - something related to a verb phrase. So the \u2018the\u2019 makes it so that to a computer those are completely different sentences structurally. \n  \nObviously google probably has their own sentence parser but if spacy is tripped up by it, then I can see how others can be too. \n  \nYou can play with spacy parser here: https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy",

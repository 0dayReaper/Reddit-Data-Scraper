Its a job, regardless of how much you love it, it's just work, and you get a paycheck for your labor and skill that's it.... This isn't the 1950s where you work for a corporation for 30-40 years and retire with a gold watch... You were labor back then too, but there was a tad more of an unwritten social contract about loyalty.",

And they have scammers in every single country. The system you dislike is the system of money. The entire concept of money automatically creates poverty. It is impossible to have a currency without having people who do not have enough of it. It\u2019s literally impossible. Because if everybody had it, nobody would need it, and therefore would have no motivation to accept it as currency. Money is arbitrary and the idea of it at its core is primitive.\n\nThe US is in trillions of dollars of debt. But like\u2026 who cares? They can just keep going into debt and there\u2019s no limit because money doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s just a way to exchange goods. Without it, everyone would need to trade their specific skills for other people\u2019s skills. \u201cI fix your plumbing if you fix my deck.\u201d \u201cI cook you food if you change the oil in my car.\u201d In that world, the poor people are the people with zero useful skills. And even in that system, you can\u2019t get rid of poverty. So yeah, everyone agrees with you. Poverty sucks. But if we had the answer, it wouldn\u2019t exist. The fact is, it does, and it always will as long as society continues in the way that it does. Every country has their own system, and they\u2019re simply just trying to make as many people happy as possible. But no system that has ever existed has ever successfully eliminated poverty. Which\u2026 that will never change here on earth. \n\nThe only time I can genuinely think of an instance where we might finally solve poverty is if we started experimenting with different constructs of society on other planets when we do start to expand in the universe. But never here on earth. We\u2019re in way too deep to want to change the very core value of our society. It won\u2019t happen.\n\nHowever, none of that excuses scamming. Billions of people make a living wage and are not in poverty without ever having to scam.",

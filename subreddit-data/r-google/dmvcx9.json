It's this nagging feeling that some thing's not quite right in the UI, it's your fingers reaching for something in muscle memory that seems like it should be there but isn't always there. It's your eyes darting all around the screen to find things, it's those little hesitations and uncertainties that add up over time. \n\nIt all starts with seemingly insignificant crap like inconsistent icons, and it extends into everything Google does. You're never 100% certain that things are going to work like you expect with Android. I say all this, and I love Android. I heartily dislike Apple products. But sometimes Google drives me abso-frickin-lutely insane.",

The concept is borrowed from Polymer (then Paper) design. Ink gets to ripple on certain surfaces. From the perspective of a graphic designer's workbench with real physical objects (as in this [2015 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrT6v5sOwJg)) you have different surfaces (sheets of paper) and different inks. The idea is your pick your palette color-set and work with that: pick your surfaces and pick your inks.\n\nSo imagine working with a stack of different colored pieces of paper (surfaces), and different colored markers and pens (inks). The 50-900 are meant to be the color of your surfaces. The A100-A700 are the color of your pen inks. You can see examples of this in the old guidelines for [Text Fields](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-states). The label colors and error colors are all Ax00 colors. Black and White are also ink colors.\n\nOnce you start seeing the concept like this, other things start making sense. Raised elements, like Cards represent the paper. They get x00 colors. Even slightly raised objects like Switch are not inked, so they get x00 colors. You use slight opacity (`87%`) because ink tends to mix its color into the color of the surface. Shadows are representing the paper element being raised. The color of the ripple **should** be the color of the ink (and I've seen frameworks get that wrong). With darker environments (black paper), you'd probably want to use more vibrate inks. That's where A100 colors come in. It's how you would do it on real paper.\n\nTL;DR: 50-900 for surfaces, Ax00 colors for ink.",

                    "comment": "One infamous incident of that is the Ford Fiesta/Focus DCT issue, where the engineers were still working on making the new dry clutch transmission reliable enough to put in a car, but their bosses told the people working on the 2nd-gen C-Platform program \"it's ready, put it in!\" without bothering to ask the engineers. The DCT engineers found out their unfinished transmission made it into the wild only after the 2012 Focus was ready to start rolling off the assembly line, so it was too late to do anything but say \"OSHIT OSHIT OSHIT just make sure they knows this wasn't our decision.\"\n\nThe warranty claims on a transmission that blows up at as little as 5k miles, but almost never lasts much beyond 40k, have forced Ford to cancel their entire compact lineup in automatic-heavy markets like the USA, because they were barely making any money on those cars to begin with. Plus the NHTSA's on their ass, because the Powershift DCTs are unpredictable and dangerous even when they are working \"right.\" Ford continued with the unfinished, dangerous transmissions for as long as they did because they thought a series of software bandaids could improve reliability and predictability enough to push the problem out of warranty, but ultimately none of their dozen or so attempts to patch the TCM firmware resulted in real improvement to what was always a hardware issue.\n\nMy question is, did that end up being a bit of a wakeup call in the industry? Did the big 3 or others car companies change their QA processes, and improve communication between drivetrain engineering teams and product planning teams, after that incident? If not, are there plans to do those things? Other companies have had similar issues: for example, Chrysler's Plymouth team, right up to the day the brand was cancelled, building retro cars that had to be hastily rebadged to a Chrysler brand where they didn't really fit, thereby often cannibalizing existing models. Or Cadillac investing hundreds of millions into the CT6 refresh, CT6-V, and Blackwing programs when it had already been decided as high as the GM Board they weren't long for this world, and nobody in what was always the CT6's main market (China) will buy a V8. However, Ford's experience with their DCTs seems to be the worst by far, a perfect reform moment that ought to do for bureaucratic inefficiency what VW's dieselgate scandal did for hybrids and electrification.",

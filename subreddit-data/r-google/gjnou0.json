Google needs to simplify there amount of apps with the same purpose like that have been doing. Yes, it's upsetting to lose that favorite app, but when you have less apps you have a more unified dev team. Google's consistency is not great in that regard but despite what others think, there is evidence now to suggest Google is getting or attempting to get better at that.",

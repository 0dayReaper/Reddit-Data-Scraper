The videos are totally ad friendly but the youtuber is not big enough to get ad revenue for their content so Google keeps all the money. Thus the video is monetized, but not for the creator only for google.\n\nThen there are videos where no ads are shown because the content may be objectionable for some reason, and Google doesn't want to risk losing advertisers. Thus no ads are shown and nobody makes money. However google continues to host the videos because it doesn't break their overall content policies and they *generally* try not to be overzealous with censoring.",

I think they might miss-understand how demonitiaztion on YouTube works, probably in part because many content creators either don't fully understand what it means or miss-represent it to their fans because it sounds more sympathetic it way.  \n\nThere are lots of way to for videos on youtube to not produce revenue for the creator.\n\n1. If the channel never makes $100 the money doesn't get paid out, see above.\n2. If the channel doesn't set up monetization setting like provide an address / bank account google can't send them money.\n3. You have a video with copyrighted content in it which gets flagged.  In this case the copyright holder can elect to allow such videos to stay and run adds against them, so they actually make money and the video stays up.  Professional channels try to avoid having this happen, but personal channels often don't care (it's not like they were making money anyways).\n4. If you video has something that advertisers object to but is not against Youtube terms of service.  Examples could be reporting on tragedies like school shootings, conspiracies like flat earth, or some hate speech that just barely avoids violating the Terms of Service.  These videos continue be served by YouTube but because advertisers don't want to look like they are sponsoring school shootings, or anything controversial, YouTube has a blanket policy of not allowing ads on these videos, this is much more about making advertisers happy than anything else, and is called demonetization because the video is not removed but it can't make any money.\n\nHope this helps",

I didnt know if you guys saw any of that when I watcy since I don't get ads other than the ones you guys put on yourselves. Glad to know you do.",

Remove the advertisers from the equation and now all they have to manage are viewers and creators (copyright holders are another story) but I don't imagine a lot of people will pay for it. \n\nI think the way to go is a decentralized system similar to podcasts. In fact, some podcast players already play video. It's a feed fully controlled by the users but then it also won't have YouTube's recommendation system which, while shit most of the time, work well enough for discovery purposes",

As it turns out having an incentive (i.e. money) for figuring out an efficient and cost effective way to source materials, build a product and distribute it is a good thing. Having government employees that get paid regardless of if the product gets made in great condition, poor condition or gets produced historically has not worked. \n\nAll that being said, things like workers and consumers rights definitely need to exist.",

I dont mind if they show ads in demonetized channels, but the issue is that they're demonetizing based on political beliefs. A career should not be ruined if they're speaking scientifically accurate statments while their competition on the other side is allowed to spread their political messages. They're creating new protected classes such as transgender individuals, which prohibits the political opinion from conservatives. You can be banned and demonetized for saying biologically accurate statments. A male only has XY chromosomes, a female has XX chromosomes. Transgenders MTF have kidney problems due to their treatment of injecting hormones in a Male's body. Saying these scientifically accurate statments is against YouTube policies for harassing a new protected class that's does not exist. A conservative has an opinion about child abuse within the transgender community. Is that worth a ban or demonetization? I can talk about the negatives of eating like a 600 pound man, but start to talk about the negatives of transitioning sexes and watch the fireworks start to go off. They're using their ad money as a way to push their political speech and limit their opponents from expressing their political speech. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I'm probably the most friendly trans ally you can find. I'm just describing how all social media companies artificially create policies that are literally banning people for saying scientifically accurate statments. They're creating politically motivated rules that everyone has to follow.",

They are aware that the video is hateful, they are aware that it breaks their own ToU, yet they still allow it on the platform because it is giving them money... they will just take 100% of the cut opposed to whatever percent they would have paid out to the content creator.",

Again because companies don't want ads shown alongside this sort of content. Google fully demonitizes these sorts of videos meaning neither the content creator nor google get any money. However what the OP is talking about is smaller channels without objectionable content where Ads are shown and Google pockets all the money. Google is monetizing the video but the creator receives nothing. \n\nIt could be argued that this is unfair to the creator, but Google is giving them a platform to have their channel scene and on a small channel the ad revenue would be so small anyway that it wouldn't really matter in my opinion. Nobody is going to quit their day job because their 100 view video generated them $0.50 in gross ad revenue.",

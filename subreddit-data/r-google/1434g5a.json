    "postText": "Because Google did not like my last review I was punished by the Google team and they deleted the last 15 reviews and blocked me from further posting. The review in question was just that I gave 5 stars for a company that I have not visited but that shows a great deal of corporate social responsibility.\n\nAnyways, I will not fight for that review but it was a good reminder that if one relies on one of the big techs with all of his or her data, access to that can be blocked at any time for any reason. They can destroy business and create personal chaos if you no longer have access to your data.\n\nSo, thanks Google team for reminding me that you have the power to do what you want with people. I think it is highly recommended to maintain offline backup solutions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73f12pu58j4b1.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0f9a070219059d73a3e06a05910142aeb8768277",

In that one case I saw something that the company made public and commended them. What I worry is how they judge you and how they prosecute you as a private entity. In my case a small thing but given the power they have they basically bypass the normal legal system and everybody has to obey their rules or suffer.",

When monopoly is promoted, this happens. You get a few individual or a company that has extreme power, influence and wealth. Enough to buy-off or influence the management.",

    "postText": "#The scam should now be resolved, good job on the speedy resolution Google!#\n\n## Official statement:\n\n&gt; We realize people are concerned about their Google accounts, and we\u2019re now able to give a fuller explanation after further investigation. We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1 percent of Gmail users. We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems. We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour. While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed. There\u2019s no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit [Google Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/secureaccount). *([source](https://thenextweb.com/security/2017/05/03/massive-google-docs-phishing-attack-currently-sweeping-internet/))*\n\n---\n\nI received a phishing email today, and very nearly fell for it. I'll go through the steps here:\n\n1. I [received an email](https://i.imgur.com/3NRq1yD.png) that a Google Doc had been shared with me. Looked reasonably legit, and I recognized the sender.\n2. The [button's URL](https://i.imgur.com/r56QsM9.png) was somewhat suspicious, but still reasonably Google based.\n3. I then got taken to [a *real* Google account selection screen](https://i.imgur.com/HNt0yMa.png). It already knew about my 4 accounts, so it's really signing me into Google.\n4. Upon selecting an account, no password was needed, I just needed to [allow \"Google Docs\" to access my account](https://i.imgur.com/JGvHa4H.png).\n5. If I click \"Google Docs\", it shows me it's *actually* published by [a random gmail account](https://i.imgur.com/tf02z1R.png), so that user would receive full access to my emails (and could presumably therefore perform password resets etc).\n6. Shortly afterwards I received [a followup real email from my contact] (https://i.imgur.com/DGSyy1L.png), informing me: \"Delete this is a spam email that spreads to your contacts.\"\n\nTo summarise, this spam email:\n\n* Uses the existing Google login system\n* Uses the name \"Google Docs\"\n* Is only detectable as fake if you happen to click \"Google Docs\" whilst granting permission\n* Replicates itself by sending itself to all your contacts\n* Bypasses any 2 factor authentication / login alerts\n* Will send scam emails to everyone you have ever emailed\n\nGoogle are [investigating this](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/692cr4/new_google_docs_phishing_scam_almost_undetectable/dh36pv2/) as we speak.\n\n---\n\n#FAQ\n\n## How do I know if I've been affected?\n\nIf you clicked \"Allow\", you've been hit. If you didn't click the link, closed the tab first, or pressed deny, you're okay! The app may have removed itself from your account, and may have deleted the sent emails.\n\n## What do I do if I've been affected?\n\n1. [Revoke access to \"Google Docs\"](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) immediately. It may now have a name ending in `apps.googleusercontent.com` since Google removed it. The real one doesn't need access.\n2. Try and see if your account has sent any spam emails, and send a followup email linking to this post / with your own advice if so.\n3. Inform whoever sent you the email about the spam emails, and that their account is compromised.\n\n## What are the effects?\n\nAll emails have been accessed, and the spam forwarded to all of your contacts. This means they could have all been extracted for reading later. Additionally, password reset emails could have been sent for other services using the infected email address.\n\n[This](https://pastebin.com/EKdKamFq) *may* be the payload, so it *may* just self replicate, and not do anything nastier. This is not at all confirmed, however, so assume the worst until an official Google statement.\n\n## I'm a G Suite sysadmin, what do I do?\n\n*The following steps [by/u/banden](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/692cr4/new_google_docs_phishing_scam_almost_undetectable/dh37uz3/) may help, but I can't verify they'll prevent it.*\n\n1. Block messages containing the hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com address from inbound and outbound mail gateway/spamav service.\n\n2. Locate Accounts in Google Admin console and revoke access to Google Doc app. It may now have a name ending in `apps.googleusercontent.com` since Google removed it. \n",

There is actually no bug, it was just a clever way of using functionality that already exists (ie: the same permissions that gmail plugins use). All they did so far was revoke the attacker's account that attained the permissions.",

Trying to block them all would be a logistical nightmare. That said, there are definetly ways to minimize attack vectors but no solid engineering answer.\n\nEdit: The 'To' address in the email was \"hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com\" and if you got the email you were BCC'ed. A dead giveaway and actually fairly poor execution by the attacker.",

It seems like it should definitely not be possible for an OAuth prompt asking users to grant some permissions to \"Google Docs\" to grant those permissions to some random scammer instead when the user clicks \"Allow\". At the very least that \"Developer Info\" shouldn't be hidden behind an extra click.\n\nAre there any plans to address this in future updates to Google's OAuth system?\n\nEdit: According to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/692cr4/new_google_docs_phishing_scam_almost_undetectable/dh39k3u/) by /u/the_mighty_skeetadon it is indeed very likely that _something_ will be done to prevent this from happening in the future.",

It could even be opened up to popular services, so people can avoid being phished on those, too - though that's obviously more work, since Google would have to approve those verifications.\n\nThough I'm not sure what the best way to mark fakes would be, permission requests pop up pretty rarely, and they rarely visit the app permissions page, so it's not like people would learn to keep an eye out for the verified tag like they do on Twitter - Maybe an infobox on the permissions page/popup to tell people to look out for the verified tag?",

                    "comment": "&gt; So the actual url they're throwing you to is:\n&gt; googledocs.g-docs.pro\n\nI'm pretty sure, since that is in the `redirect_uri` param, that it's just the URL google sends you to after having gone through the oauth process. It's the oauth process that gives this program access to your email account, not simply visiting `googledocs.g-docs.pro` at the end.\n\n&gt; But only after throwing you through Google's login page, which makes it appear that it's actually all hosted by Google, which it ultimately is not.\n\nI believe the problem is precisely because it *really* is being done by google to your account that makes it a problem. You're *really* using Google's oauth system to give access to your email account to a third-party calling itself \"Google docs\".\n\n&gt; That domain is down now but was hosted via Cloudflare, who are usually terrible at shutting down phishing sites on their hosting and CDN systems.\n\nJust shutting down that domain name likely won't help. I'm guessing it's just that:\n\n    client_id=1024674817942-fstip2shineo1lsego38uvsg8n2d3421.apps.googleusercontent.com\n\nHas their \"name\" set to \"Google Docs\". And apparently Google just shows you the name when asking to grant access to third-parties and doesn't do any sort of verification of that name. Google just needs to shut down this developer account (I think someone said they already did) and fix they way the third-party name is presented to the user.\n\nEdit: Based on some pastebins posted in the comments it looks like visiting that page *after having already granted oauth access* triggers the code that then sends out emails from your account to others to get them to do the same thing. So disabling those domains will help stop it from spreading, but the author already has access to your email account by then and could do whatever they wanted (had Google not shut down that developer ID) including sending out email from your account another way.",

And now the union representing those working at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is pushing back.\n\n\u201cThe real issue is the fact that we do not have meaningful agency regarding our working conditions,\u201d Chris Schmidt, a Google software engineer and recording chair of the Alphabet Workers Union said in a statement Thursday posted on Twitter.",

What the OS *should* do, is not constantly balloon in size, and provide a halfway sensible solution for storing apps on external solution.

Android still can't manage that. \n\nThere is serious fault with Android for the space issues, but it's not because Android deletes too few user files. ",

The phone itself is good and I've used it for over a year, but the apps on it SUCK.  It won't even sync the calendar to ANYTHING, which is especially frustrating once I realized it's running f\\*cking Android, just heavily dumbed down to replicate the exact app selection you would've got 15 years ago.",

There's a fundamental difference between the operating system / kernel and user space applications. The phone app is an app, and the clock that you see is an app and the android system UI that you see is an app, but that UI doesnt get the time that it displays from the clock app, it gets it from the kernel. The clock app is another app that also gets the time that it displays from the kernel. There is nothing fundamental requiring Samsung's clock to be present for anything, you can disable it using the Knox security API and use any other clock app in it's, place. But Samsung forces you to use an API, rather than a setting which requires someone to write an app to do it.",

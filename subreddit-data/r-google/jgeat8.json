I remember when Instagram did their redesign. I t changed a lot, and nobody I knew (including me) liked it. Now I look back at the old one, and think that i just looks old, and not as good.\n\nWe'll get over it, I'm really sure. \n\nAlso, I have a theory as to why they did this. Maybe it's part of a rebranding of the whole company. I pretty sure we all on this subreddit know that google isn't just a search engine. But not everyone knows that, especially older people I guess. This may be a way of really pointing out that the company makes other stuff too.\n\nThis also works out with the pixel phone line getting simpler, and seemingly targeting a general audience rather than enthusiasts like it has before. This makes them more attractive to buy for people that don't really care what phone they have, as long it works well and doesn't cost too much. If those people start using the pixels, they'll probably use these exact services as well, making it more apparent that google does indeed have quite a variety of services and products.",

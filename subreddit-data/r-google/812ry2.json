Its meant to provide a way for people to have conversations about the video but its nearly impossible to do so in a convenient way. Usernames are the same color as the actual comment which gets worse with people who have entire sentences as their username, spaces and all. Sometimes you can reply to a specific person and other times you have to type out the username you want to reply to yourself, its luck of the draw. You only have a single comment thread per top comment making the branching conversations that inevitably form to make reading these threads brain puzzles.\n\nThe comments section is a dumpster fire on a design level. I can ignore or debate hate speech but those functional barriers i can't do anything about. ",

They're like controversial celebs desperately trying to stay relevant. But most of those celebs are dumb but you'd imagine massive companies are sophisticated, but no, they're keep doing pointless shit and ignore issues for years. Obviously not all of them and not everything they do is shit, but close to it.",

There are teams of very smart people that want to get promoted, so they make a new product with MACHINE LEARNING and refuse to integrate with the existing messaging teams so that they don't share the credit, and we get Allo. The google execs also decide they want to transition to business tools so another team of very smart people fork hangouts and turn it into chat but refuse to play nice with the old team so that they don't share the credit.

It was first dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming. It states that\n\n\n\n\"organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\"\n\n\n\nThe law is based on the reasoning that in order for a software module to function, multiple authors must communicate frequently with each other.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/google/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

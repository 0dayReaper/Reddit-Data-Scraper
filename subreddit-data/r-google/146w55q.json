They take the content from the creator's site, put it on the search results page, and steal the traffic that would have gone to the site, thereby starving the site of traffic.  \n\nGoogle even turned off its news service in Spain because Spain forced them to pay for the content they were stealing.  I guess if they can't get the content for free, they don't want it. \n\nhttps://digiday.com/media/google-news-spain/",

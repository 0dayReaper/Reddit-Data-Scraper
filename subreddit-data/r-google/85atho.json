    "postText": "Hi Googlers\n\nI'm searching for a specific piece of technical hardware and I get 100k results from Pinterest. Everyone of these results requires a signup and log into Pinterest to be able to see it.\n\nThis is not in accordance with Google's rules, as those are not open results.  Basically Google is working as a Pinterest expansion tool.\n\nPinterest needs to be removed from Google IMO. They clutter the images results and do not allow users to obtain what they search for.\n\nJust 2 cents about that. Thanks.",

Honestly I'm kind of surprised it still exists at all in its current form.  \n\nThe main reason they are allowed to display images they don't own on their site in the first place is that courts have found thumbnails to be \"sufficiently transformative\" to qualify as fair use.\n\nHonestly I'm kind of surprised the \"enlarge\" feature when you click on the image hasn't been legally challenged either.  I suspect that a proper lawsuit by a major organization could take out that functionality too.\n\nThis is one of those situations where everyone just assumes what Google is doing is normal and fine because they're used to in and like the functionality.

We'd buy the boxed set dvds of a show if it wasn't stupidly priced or just not watch the show. \n\nWhen streaming became reasonably useful we started using that, but still with no commercials. We'd pay for Amazon Prime and watch things there, then added Netflix. We don't watch on Amazon anymore since they added commercials. The Amazon ones are at least for other shows and we did give it a try, but they are still louder than the volume of what we are trying to watch and the shows in the ads are always completely unrelated to the types of things we would be interested in watching. \n\nWe've been moving back to DVD/BR sets for many things so we don't have to worry about making it through a series before it gets removed from the site or having our ISP decide we only need usable internet some days.",

It's also the fact that the majority of Pins are BROKEN- they don't lead back to the original source.  (Whether because the pins are old, content has been moved, etc.)  So as opposed to a search engine like Google that continuously updates its index, the Pinterest model will only lead to more and more broken links as time goes by.  It is a broken model, and incredibly frustrating.",

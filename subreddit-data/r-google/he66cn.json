It has, for example, handled notifications much better than iOS has, despite iOS finally grouping notifications as of iOS 13. \n\nBut the fact that an iPhone from late 2015 was supported by iOS 13\u2014unlike Android-based flagships that often only get 1 or 2 new major updates\u2014is pretty neat to me. I also like the fact that I needn\u2019t worry about apps I download from the App Store secretly spying on me (without breaking the Play Store\u2019s rules) and bombarding me with ads. \n\nThat said, I miss watching YouTube without ads and having slightly better swipe keyboards.",

A messaging app is only useful if people are *already using it*. \n\nI don't want to have to convince someone to use a particular app; if that were what I was asking for, I could use literally anything. I'm not going to get my parents friends to message me on one of those apps.",

My GF uses my old One Plus 2 and it has the same kernel as my Pixel 3 XL",

There's a reason the Pixel 4 has been blasted by so many - it's not the device itself, but the cost you pay for it. There's been plenty of discussions here and on /r/pixel about how it's a  good device, but just not for that cost.\n\nWhat about Face unlock? What about the issues with that, with Google having to patch in later to check that your eyes are open? Apple had that from the start. At least they eventually patched it, though. \n\nWant another gripe? Battery life. There's just no comparison between Pixels and iPhones. Google is always touting OS improvements to battery life (anyone remember project Volta?) but compare a Pixel 4 to an iPhone 11 and...yeah, battery life sucks by comparison. Part of that is Android, but part of that is that Google consistently hobbles pixels with smaller batteries. \n\nThen there's the whole debacle over 4k video recording. Apple has had it for years, Google has been working like molasses to bring that to pixels.\n\nKeep in mind, I say all of this as a die-hard Android user and I hate Apple, with all their stupid vendor lock-in and overpriced...everything. But at least with Apple, as much as it's overpriced, it's usually reasonable in quality and comes with a level of customer service Google only dreams of. Google has copied Apple's tendency for charging a premium, but not backing it up.",

Believe me they are a pain to work with.\n\n&gt;Not sure what qualifies as a few, but there's about 50 interfaces listed above\n\nYou are mistakenly thinking that everything under the \"android.widget\" package is usable in launcher widgets. I don't blame you cause they use the term \"widget\" both for standard UI elements like buttons and spinners seen inside the apps, but also for the _launcher widget_ which is what we're talking about in this thread. It's confusing. The list of components allowed in _launcher widgets_ is [much smaller](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets#CreatingLayout) . This also means fully custom ui widgets are not allowed either - back to the point about limited animation. If I wanted a pulsating red circle to draw attention to something on the _launcher widget_, I couldn't make one. \n\n&gt;Are you sure? Just googled and found an SO post describing how to get widget updates every minute.\n\nActually that's pretty cool. I didn't know of this approach. So thank you, I'm bookmarking this! \n\nYou might think that custom views, animations and ~30~ 1 minute update limitation aren't a big deal, but I can promise you you would have seen a lot more cooler widgets, and serious apps investing in widgets, if this restraint jacket wasn't there.",

The big one has been the new power button menu you get on the Pixel when using Android 11.  I have been really, really, wanting Apple to copy and it now sounds like that is what they will do.\n\nI actually dislike PiP and almost never use on my Pixel.   Can't imagine Apple able to do translation like Google.  But like to see their best effort.\n\nThe one I wish Apple would now copy is the Live Closed Caption.  But also Siri on device versus needing the cloud.  Google NLP on device opens up all kinds of cool stuff.  Hope Apple can figure out how to do the same.",

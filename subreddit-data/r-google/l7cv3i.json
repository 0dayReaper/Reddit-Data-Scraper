The next mental leap that we're seeing people take in the comment section is that Google is complicit in censoring everyone's displeasure with with Robinhood. They might be, but they also have protocols in place to prevent review spamming. That's the context that's missing with the tweet. Everyone might be right about Google in this case, but no one has enough factual information from this event to make that judgement.\n\nThis whole fiasco is just another example of divide and conquer.

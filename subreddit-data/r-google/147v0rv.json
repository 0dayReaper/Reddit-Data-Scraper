However, an IP address is often not as useful as you would think it would be.  Most people doing this kind of crap would be using a VPN service, so all an IP address gives you is that service.  \n\nThen you need to serve the service with a court order to produce their records, and depending on where the service is located they may not be required to keep those records. \n\nI know that seems like a more advanced technique but these days it's as simple as filling out an internet forum.",

My job was to review suspicious orders placed on the online store. Most fraudsters are about brute force, getting as many orders or whatever as possible in a short time to overload a company's anti-fraud resources.   \n\n\nThe reason they will not give you IP or identifying information is because if they give you that and you go to the fraudsters place and get in a fight, the company is liable because they gave you the information. Only a proper police or FBI investigation is going to get that information.",

With a public WHOIS search you'd get, at best, the street address of the ISP's head office. Practically, your IP can be used to narrow your location down to the country level.\n\nThe only way to correlate an IP address to a physical location is to check the internal ISP logs to find out what customer ID was assigned what IP at that time\\*. That would require either a court order or a lot of money and knowing the right people, definitely not something any average Joe could pull off.\n\n\\\\\\* even that's not always possible",

You would need to serve legal docs on the ISP with a specific date and time because of dynamic ip allocation to get a name and address. Even then you only have the bill payer. For law enforcement for things like serious fraud, pedo stuff etc the next step is obtaining a warrant and seizing electronic devices to get actual evidence.\n\nIn OPs case an IP could point to a region where the person pretending to be them lives, and op can claim that it cant be them because they dont live there and have never been there. Google could confirm that and take appropriate action without disclosing the ip.",

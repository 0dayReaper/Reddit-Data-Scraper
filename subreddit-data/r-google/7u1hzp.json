I like the pacific ocean mainly because of its diversity, space, and hunting grounds, but there are some problems with it that keep me from giving it five stars. The first reason is that the water is generally cold. It's better than the Atlantic and Arctic oceans in most places, but still very cold for my liking. I personally live on Canada's coast under a rock. I have a nice view, and good neighbors, but I know people whose entire clutch of eggs have been eaten by predatory animals less than a few miles away from here. Sometimes, the tide goes up very high, and sometimes very low. That is another thing I don't like about it: The waters are unpredictable. One time, I was scuttling down a beach when the tide swept me over and dragged me into the water. It was an experience I never want to have again. Most other things (including the mating season) of the Pacific Ocean are well-rounded. Don't let my review discourage you from living here, though. It is an amazing and beautiful place to live.*](https://i.imgur.com/JjV1aTL.png)",

    "postText": "Is anyone else getting a ton of spam in their Gmail primary inbox these days? I get like 5 per day of things like this. Obvious fake-looking email with an embedded picture link, sometimes with Best Buy, Yeti, etc, other times with no-name companies. Either way, one would think Google would be good enough at auto-detecting spam, considering their nearly two decades of experience, and doing a great job at it for the majority of that time span. The past \\~3-6 months have been terrible. I always report spam, thinking I'm doing my small part, but nothing has changed.\n\nGooglers, what's up with this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wetspo7bsp1b1.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cd345fda6501f82624766baf83d44b9fa4ec3669",

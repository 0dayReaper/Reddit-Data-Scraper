Lol imagine getting pulled over by the police and insisting they can't arrest you as the handcuffs are actually yours and not theirs, so they are handling stolen property!  Yep it's a farce until someone can prove who's handcuffs they are.\n\nAlso if the police or Sainsbury's were using or selling the items without the knowledge (not someone just saying it, but proof) that's not against the law as at the point of sale or use they were not aware.",

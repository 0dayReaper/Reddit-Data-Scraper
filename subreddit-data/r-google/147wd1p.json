    "postText": "Hi,\nThis question is for a Googler that works in the Nyc office:\nI visited the Google NYC office a couple of months ago. At the front desk, you could grab some stickers (NYC campus stickers, in the subway theme). However, I forgot to take them with me because I was in a hurry to visit another meeting at the Pier. So my question is: Is there any Google Employee here on Reddit that is able to grab 1/2 (or 3\ud83d\ude43) of those stickers and send it to me (abroad). Of course I will pay for the shipping and a small thank you fee. Feel free to DM me.",

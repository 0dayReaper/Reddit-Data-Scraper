    "postText": "My teacher uploaded some PP presentations on our classes google classroom, we did a test and got bad grades she agreed that we retake it but when I got back home she deleted all of the presentations. Now I don't know what to do I don't take notes as its not necessary but if I fail this test one more time I will fail the class. Can I somehow get these presentations back? Thanks in advance\n\nEdit: I got no response on mail and in school she pulled me out of history class took me to the principal now my parents have to come to school to defend me because I was disturbing and attacking her on social media???? I am switching classes.",

If they delete it without returning it to you then there's no trace of it in your Google Drive unless you made a copy beforehand. I don't think you can get it back unless the teacher takes it out of their Drive Trash and returns it to you in the Class unfortunately.",

The Teacher may be able to recover them but if she deleted them on purpose then she's unlikely to. \n\nShe likely deleted them because a number of students weren't actually learning anything and weren't taking notes. \n\nSend her an email and appeal to her. Let her know that you understand why she deleted them and that it was fair on her part. Add something like, \"As you know, if I fail this test I will fail the class. If I fail, I understand that it's my own fault. However this has been an awakening to me and I'd like to do everything I can to ensure I can pass it. Thank you for teaching me the importance of taking notes and focusing on studying.\"\n\nAsk politely(without begging or demanding) for the source material she used for the presentations. That indicates that you are willing to work extra to ensure you pass as you'd have to go through a lot more literature on the topic.",

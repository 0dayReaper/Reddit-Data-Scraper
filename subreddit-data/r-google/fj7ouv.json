Net Neutrality is gone and we fought for that basically as hard as is possible. \n\nIt feels like they\u2019re gonna do whatever they want to do and there\u2019s really no way to stop it. \n\nSure, we can vote people out, but it\u2019s just a matter of time before ignorant boomers (emphasis on the ignorant part), trolls, and the like get the right people in office. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be pessimistic, but our Congress has shown time and time again to not give a single fuck about what the people want because we don\u2019t line their pockets.",

So you upload something, and it will be checked 3 days or more before getting public (if). Because the is no infrastructure that could controll all of that content. from the passing of the law a year ago. These us company's now have 3 years time until it's final and will be used.

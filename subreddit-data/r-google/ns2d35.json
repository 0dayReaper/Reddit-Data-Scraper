Some roads should really be categorized as non-thru traffic in that it should only be used if it is the only way to your final destination, it could be done if the road was given a very low score. Google does that categorization better.",

I'm no longer on iPhone but apple maps was pretty good but overall, use any system you like but familiarise yourself with roughly where you're going before you set off and only use any nav for reference. \nBefore all this tech I'd look up my route in a map book, make note of the major cities on route and follow signs for each city until I saw a sign for the next city along the way until I got where I was going, that never failed me.",

We stopped in Somewhere South Missouri to rest up for the night. Because I was pulling the trailer and was driving slower than everyone I left at 4am using Waze to get to our destination while my family slept in for an additional 2 hours. \n\nNot sure what setting my wife and son set using Google Maps, but the short of is that they got there two hours earlier than I did.\n\nThe worst part of  the drive was the route selection Waze sent me on. It was the scariest shit ever. By the time I finally caught up to my family I was completely stressed out. \n\nI found that during short in town drives Waze work better for me, but on long drives I\u2019m 100% all in on Google Maps. I have not tried Apple Maps.",

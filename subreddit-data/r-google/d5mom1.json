It's a bit like how it was watching rabid Windows Phone enthusiasts talk about how \"they have all the apps they need\".\n\nI really do wish Sony would get their act together though - the builds are still pretty tight (the XZ's have been better than any Pixel to date in terms of fit &amp; finish), skins are lightweight (though at the same time not that value-add, I actually use the bloatware on my Samsungs) and they can pull in a signal like a mf (when my P3 goes to voicemail, I can still sometimes pull in even an LTE signal with the Sony).\n\nEDIT: And they're the only major company making a one-handable phone, which is what I want as my main phone.",

Something so seemingly simple they still don't get: product names.  You don't help your consumers with these alphanumeric codes.  Even the most technically sophisticated vehicles usually have easy to remember names with maybe a package designator and a year.  With Sony, man, I have been looking at buying a 4K UHD player and felt like I needed to get out a notepad to keep the models and features sorted.  Even their own sales reps on Amazon seem frustrated cause they have to keep explaining the minor differences between models justifying minor price differences.  \"Hi, So glad you asked, no this product does not have WiFi and it only has 4 built in Apps, but you do need it connected to Ethernet, though many consumers appreciae its region free playing capability.\"  KISS   Keep It Simple Sony (I won't call them Stupid, they've done a lot in tech over the years from the Walkman to recorders for lectures to phones and the PlayStation and cameras and audio).",

I think Ferrari does it best, having numeric designations + name. So internally and maybe for enthusiasts you can use the numbers, but use emphasize the name for marketing. Most people who are into cars, but not all that much probably won't immediately know how the Ferrari 550 looks. Or the 360. But you talk of the Maranello or the Modena, they'll more likely have connection in their mind.",

Even the best lens in the world is going to create crap if it's only a couple mm across.  It's simple physics.\n\nAnd fyi, lenses are nor rated in MP.  That refers to the CCD element that records the image.  So you described a decent to excellent quality lens that is recording 21mp of crap because it's simply not possible to do otherwise.  21 mp, in fact more than 4 or 5 mp is pointless using a tiny lens and only viewing it at cellphone resolution.  Image processing can help, but even a perfect image is wasted when you're looking at a 6 x 2\" screen.",

The \"21MP\" touted was around the end of the phone megapixel race to the top, and no doubt connected to the processing software, but it was definitely sold as \"[21MP](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/09/04/sony-xperia-z1/)\"\n\nCurious as to why anything over 4-5 is a waste.. The Google devices are all touting 12MP lenses and their post processing is top of class.\n\nAnd yes, a smaller screen might not show it well, but also consider that most phone screens have higher pixel density and resolution than computer displays, so might actually show it better than on a laptop or desktop with anything less than a 4k panel",

Yes, it's cute to think of Alexa as an Orwellian surveillance device that we buy each other as presents, but if it was really just streaming everything it hears, somebody would notice the extra traffic. It would be really obvious.\n\nWell, now, it's less obvious. If device-side voice recognition is just as good as in a Google datacenter, then what stops the phone from just running it on anything said nearby? And a text transcript is way easier to hide than a voice recording.",

It will never reach the privacy of Apple simply because Google makes money by breaking your privacy.\n\nI honestly see no reason besides price to take an android, it\u2019s like going back to 2009. No iMessage so no full sized photo\u2019s or videos, no live photo\u2019s, no animoji, no baked in gif support, actually Android still doesn\u2019t have an decent internet messenger everyone is still forced to use whatsapp by Facebook so goodbye privacy. \n\nBesides all of that I try samsung in the store when buying a new iPhone and they still lag like crazy. So idunno If you like 2009 join Android, if not, get an iPhone. Also Android lacks integration with your pc, but with iphone you only benefit if you have a mac :). \n\nPoint is iPhone is so much more than a phone. Android is well, still a bad copy from ios. Look at the pixel 4 straight up copy and a bad one at that \ud83d\ude02.",

The download manager is for the folks who don\u2019t know how to download stuff already idunno who its for really but it may prove handy. With download history and all. Atm i can download files, images, videos, anything, even apps :). Obviously the company needs to have some certificate to be able to do so, facebook\u2019s got revoked, same for google cause they thirsty data companies.\n\n\nIn the old days where you could not download you had something called airdrop, now really it\u2019s basic technology but since android still doesn\u2019t have something similar it\u2019s hard to understand. \n\nYour comment just shows your ignorance. As i said before, there is really nothing android can do better other than stealing people\u2019s work aka piracy. And you know being cheaper and more options to change looks and all that stuff.\n\nThe list of basic stuff missing from android grows:\nNo internet messenger\n\nNo live photos\n\nNo full sized photos through whatsapp*\n\nNo full sized videos through whatsapp*\n\nNo privacy\n\nNo airdrop\n\nNo airplay\n\nNo harmony with other devices\n\nNo monthly updates for years\n\nNo iCloud or iCloud like protection\n\nNo apps are made FOR ANDROID, always ported, snapchat really shows it.\n\nNo appstore, i mean you got google mallware, i mean google play but it lack the most basic of apps.\n\n*since android lacks the most basic of features you\u2019re forced to use 3rd party crap to make your device somewhat modern. Like whatsapp. Limitations are the quality in which you send your files and of course all your data going to big brother. You get whay you pay for I guess.",

I loved the software experience on the Pixel but the hardware always seemed to have a problem. I figured with the software pretty mature now I would rather have reliable hardware.\n\nAnd I regret it.\n\nThe pictures on the S10 suck compared to the gen 1 Pixel. Totally washed out, blown out, just look like trash by comparison. The phone is several generations ahead hardware wise, but I still need to reboot it every couple of days. This happens most often when I'm trying to cast something from my Samsung phone to my Google Home Group. It often won't see the group at all until I reboot the phone. Sometimes launching apps they just hang. I have to close them and relaunch them and then they start fine. I never had any of these problems with my Pixel phone with way less RAM and an old processor. IMO, Pixel is the only way to go on Android. I'm literally considering eating the $1000+ investment I made 3 months ago and buying the Pixel 4.",

Currently, I have an iPhone X, but I am getting ready to pay it off. I have been apart of the \u201cApple Ecosystem\u201d since about 2009-2010, and one thing I\u2019ve notice for the past 3-4 years now is that Android is taking risks that Apple is not, when it comes to new tech on phones, and I really respect that. Been thinking about switching to the Samsung Galaxy S10, Galaxy Note 10+ or the new Google Pixel 4 here in a couple months, and I just wanted your opinions on what you like or dislike about each phone.

The least biased sub would probably be r/androidquestions or something similar.\n\nTo answer your question, depends on what features and design you're looking for, as well as how much you're willing to spend. \n\nUpdates/UI. With a Google phone you will get immediate Android updates, however with Samsung it could be 6 months to a year before you get major updates. On the other hand, I prefer OneUI to native Android, however again this is completely personal preference. Otherwise they're basically the same. \n\nDesign. Personally I hate the design of the Pixel 4, however that is of course subjective. It is believed to have a square camera setup, similar to the iPhone 11, however the cameras will probably actually line up and be flush. Galaxy phones have 3 cameras lined up horizontally in the middle of the body. \n\nFeatures. It's hard to say obviously how feature rich the Pixel 4 will be, since not all details are released yet. Rumors say it will probably not have a headphone jack or wide angle lense, while the S10 does. There is no obvious finger print sensor in renders either, however it's entirely possible they put it under the screen. Google is often pretty adventurous and experimental, so they could come out of nowhere with some crazy new feature as well. \n\nCamera. You'll get so many different opinions on this. For me it's hard to tell the difference between the two, however some people say they can tell the difference, and I have yet to find a consensus on which one is \"better\". If camera matters to you then I encourage you to look at comparisons (without knowing which phone is which, if possible, to remove bias) and see which picture you like better. \n\nPrice. If these phones end up not being the same price then the Pixel will almost certainly be cheaper. \n\nDisclaimer, I do own a Galaxy S10+. I must say I think it's Samsung's best phone in a really long time, maybe ever, however I tried to be pretty objective in this post. It ultimately depends on what is important to you. I wouldn't make any decisions until the Pixel 4 is released, and see what it's got.\n\nEdit: Oh, and don't switch to the Note. If you're thinking about the Note, get the S10+ instead. They're basically the same phone as far as I'm aware, except the Note has a stylus and higher price tag.",

I couldn't believe hownnotjing on it worked with anything else, monsoon seems to share any user info or experience, and from what I'm still experiencing, the situation hasn't changed.  As a phone maybe an Android is fine, as a spotify user hooked to bandwidth, again mayb3 android is great, but step outside that constant connection and desire a broadly connected environment that covers almost all you want to do on a phone (including outside google) and you are struggling with any android phone, but iOS manages all quite neatly, notboerfect for sure, but for the most, it simply just works.  I'm still using an Android and still feel it's lame compared to my ancient iPhone 6, but it has a battery, something that iPhone have always struggled with sadly.  So much so that I usually go out carrying a backup battery charger pack!  I'm not concerned at all about the x mm 5hin phones, I am concerned by multi day capable battery life for those busy days.  One day they see the reality and get back to selling phone with decent battery life that exist in a broad ecosystem, for apple iOS it's a cinch, for Android, wow it's possibly an impossible leap.",

The actual results in daily use versus photos with a lot of prep.",

It\u2019s been more than a decade since Apple released iOS, everyone saw how great it was, secure, pretty &amp; smooth functioning. Google made Android, but why has nobody else stepped in with another great option? I\u2019m not a computer pro, so I have no idea of the complexities of creating an OS, from the ground up, but surely some other large company with massive resources could have created another great operating system to compete with iOS &amp; Android, by now. And now I\u2019m thinking of OS X &amp; windows too. Why are we so limited for choice in operating systems?",

Microsoft phones had pretty good reviews, but the app store was basically empty so no one bought their phones.",

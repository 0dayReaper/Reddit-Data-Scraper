But now that I am continuously using it I am beginning to like it more than regular search. \n\nGranted I have to confirm that what bard says is true because it definitely likes to hallucinate a lot. Simple addition and other mathematic operations are sometimes done wrongly by bard. However, once I point it out it corrects itself. \n\nI have to say though it can definitely take some skill to actually get bard to answer your question in a specific way  as it tends to answer it in the most general sense.",

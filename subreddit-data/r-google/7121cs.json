If their job is to funnel along tickets and respond to users, it's not feasible for them to know the product inside-out in a way that they can identify whether something is actually wrong all the time.  As others have said, users are pretty bad at knowing when things are wrong, so most of the tickets they're getting aren't anything (and that's not a \"non-tech people are stupid blah blah blah.\"  I do PD/PM stuff and have submitted some dumb tickets because I didn't take 4 seconds to try to figure it out).  It can often take engineers a while to figure out if something actually is wrong, even when they get a ticket where they know something is off.\n\nThis isn't also to say that companies can't do a better job everywhere: product design, customer service, etc., but I think it's easy to see a company like Google as a monolith which doesn't care about its customers when it's actually, on a team-level at the very least, mostly made up of people who want you to have a good experience with their product and the work they do.\n\nI'm personally pretty impressed OP not only got a follow-up response from an engineer, but that they acknowledged the miscommunication.  It'd have been very easy to fix it and pretend it didn't happen.",

Recognising that the end result IS wrong does not. And this is the part companies keep fucking up on.\n\nWhen I was working in customer service like this we had the same problem. It's a minimum wage job from people who don't particularly care about what they're doing. There's pressure to get calls done and get things moving quickly and the result is that nobody really pays attention to the issues in front of them. They have a set of roughly templated responses that they can fire back at customers and, 90% of the time, they're accurate to what the customer needs to be told.\n\nBut then the other 10% you generally end up in a holding pattern in which your problem specific enough that it is an ACTUAL problem, and you need to hit an employee who is actually paying attention to what you're asking for in order for them to recognise that something has gone wrong, rather than going right in a way the customer doesn't like.\n\nYou're right to say that customer service doesn't need to know how the thing works to respond to the vast majority of tickets. A really good rep will have at least some idea, but given the cost-squashing measurements finding that sort of rep is like gold dust.\n\nBut the SHOULD know what the end result for the user looks like. They should understand what the user experience is MEANT to be, so they can recognise when it's not meeting that experience. Because when it's not is when there's an actual problem.",

Supporting just those who are uploading is such a monumental task, but then throw in all the users and it becomes almost impossible.\n\nEvery timezone, every country, every device, every platform, OS version, browser, language, internet speed, option, etc...\n\nAt their scale, spending an extra minute per ticket could mean an ever-increasing stack of tickets that can never be cut down.  At their scale, you need 24/7 staffing of many CS employees that can speak all of the supported languages.\n\nAnd just hiring more people isn't  the answer either, if they need to hire too many customer service people, the platform might not make financial sense any more. And unless you think a company is going to spend more than the GDP of some countries on a charity service, that means that most of us are worse off, not just the few that have problems (i'm using \"few\" in the loosest possible terms...)",

The fact that this ad was shown was a bug, and to me it looks like the system is working (bug was reported, bug was fixed within short amount of time). I don't really want to get into an argument about how perfect they can make their software, so I'm going to just ignore that part. I was talking about tradeoffs made in terms of customer support, and there isn't really an answer that does all of the following at the same time:\n\nA) Keeps everyone happy  \nB) Doesn't increase the cost to the users by at least a magnitude (You'd pay $100 a month instead of $10 a month for red, or you'd see 10X more ads without red)  \nC) Keeps the company in business.  \n\nEdit: also, the downvote was because the comment was low quality. \"They shouldn't be greedy\" isn't a conversation, it's a demand that was completely out off topic from the discussion.",

He said I was the only one, but that seemed unrealistic. Unless of course, my second theory was correct: English was not his first language. While I don't care about that as long as they provide good service, his language skills were obviously holding this person back. And mind you, the second rep I contacted (the same way, on chat) was AMAZING, which had the side effect of pointing out how poorly the first rep was.

But in the way you make that statement, you're also violating Google's policy.\n\nSo nice work.",

In Inbox the Bundles are separated from regular unbundled emails with padding and if there are any new emails in a bundle, the bundle is enlarged quite a bit. That alone helps keeps things easily manageable and organized. Inbox also automatically bundles purchases and has Google Trips integration so all your flight details(boarding pass, ETA, round trip, one way, departure time, seat number, confirmation number) are all displayed in the header of the Flight Bundle. It also automatically sets reminders for appointments and even displays reminders from Google Calendar.\n\nGmail is none of that with a UI that looks stale and bland, its bundles are barely distinguishable from the rest of the emails and rely on you labeling emails to bundle them.",

And it's states: You can find your favourite Inbox features in the Gmail app.\n\nSo let's count:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Clean interface \u274c\n\nI can't find my letters \u2014 there are billions of labels, buttons etc. You CAN'T just overview from single screen everything you've got in primary, purchases, finance and updates categories.\n\nCan you spot &lt;open bug&gt; button? Where you can do it faster?\n\nGmail [https://nyazo.jp/rFK9o6-.png](https://nyazo.jp/rFK9o6-.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInbox  [https://nyazo.jp/pED7Y6Z.png](https://nyazo.jp/pED7Y6Z.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Snooze letters  \u2705\n\nIt's a great feature to postpone some actions with letters. Okay, Gmail, you have this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Bundles \u274c\n\nEvery mail you got just hides in some labels, tab, etc. It's not aggregated at all. It's 2019, AI era, and you should manually open specific label wait it for load to find your favorite subscription.\n\nOpen Inbox and your mail is sorted and exposed to you. Open Gmail \u2014 your mail is probably sorted but it's hidden in drawers somewhere on the Post Office, you should open sidebar and click each label to find it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Cards \u274c\n\nSo okay. You've finally found your letter. You open it. Oh, and there is a lot of text you should read. Unnecessary text.  If you're using inbox you're already into a primary data of this letter. You have cards for bills, orders, bookings for cinema tickets, plane tickets, hotel rooms etc. [https://nyazo.jp/jgZLg8x.png](https://nyazo.jp/jgZLg8x.png) Everything is gathered for you, just open and tell your confirmation number at the desk, no need to scroll, scan entire letter etc. [https://nyazo.jp/a9yJ6Cm.png](https://nyazo.jp/a9yJ6Cm.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Trips aggregator \u274c\n\nEverything you need is where it's supposed to be \u2014 in your inbox, so you can easily find everything related and recover in case you would need this in future [https://nyazo.jp/htCCHuz.png](https://nyazo.jp/htCCHuz.png) You don't have to open separate Trips app and you can attach ANY letter related to this bundle like place suggestions from your friend or link to mixtape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Smart categories \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nGmail has only Social, Promotions, Updates and Forums and leaks of such important categories like Purchases or Finance. You have to manually create billion of rules to autolabel them and... they still will be lost somewhere in sidebar because gmail hates bundles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it's only my personal daily driver Inbox features. What about yours?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nupd. sorry for this heavy headers \u2014 i'm not a very experienced with markdown/FPE.

It was super helpful for me because it automatically did that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also had nudges, which brought back old emails which might need to be responded to or checked over again/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheres smart reply, which I think is in gmail app, but it gave quick/generic responses to an email so you could easily click it and send it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of more features that I can't remember on the top of my head, but it was a great service and ill miss it :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

But the setup is what is so cool.   We just purchased, plugged in and logged in and that was it.   She already used Google Photos on her iPhone.\n\nWe did purchase a 4k Chromecast and a Google Home but any Google Assistant speaker will work.\n\nJust can not do this with anything but Google Photos that I am aware of.   Give it a try it is very cool.  It is also the tech thing we show off when people come over.\n\nJust blurting out any detail in a photo you have taken and it appears.\n\nBTW, you can upload all your old photos also onto Google Photos and it is free.  If you want uncompressed they do give you 15 GB for free.   Or if you buy a CB they give you and additional 100 GB.\n\nI also have a Pixel that I carry as well as an iPhone so get mine for free.",

Google eventually discontinued this \u201cservice\u201d, basically deeming the card useless, maybe around 2012 (give or take 2 years). From reading these comments it seems like people liked this card, but I have no idea why, maybe it\u2019s safer than a debit card. I probably used the card less than 10 times total; I like using credit cards bc they give cash back and are safer.",

                    "comment": "At the time the Google Wallet card got cancelled, it essentially was a 'proxy' card. \n\nYou added a credit card to your Google account, and then linked that credit card on your Google account with Google Wallet card. The Google Wallet card then acted like a debit card where the funds were provided from the linked credit card on file. Whenever you made a purchase, the merchant saw the money coming from Google, but Google funded the transaction by, behind the scenes, charging your credit card.\n\nIt died around the same time that Android Pay came out. With Android Pay, Google actually talks to your bank directly, gets some limited-use credit card numbers (that periodically replenish), and then during a transaction the issuer sees the limited-use number and map it back to the credit card to charge.\n\nBenefits of Google Wallet? Google had all the transaction data, so they could do things like send you an email/SMS/notification every time your Google Wallet card was used, even if it was a physical card-present transaction (hence, people saying it is great for anti-fraud). It also had generic support to be backed by any credit card, because it was Google charging the card behind the scenes.\n\nThe downside? Besides it being complicated to explain and people not understanding it, there was the problem that people wouldn't get the primary benefits from the credit cards. If you get 5% back on gas with your Freedom credit card, but use the Google Wallet card that is backed by the Freedom card, it means that your Google settlement will show 'gas station' and that your Freedom statement will show 'Google Play purchase'.",

I was asking for Credit/Bank auto-funding for the longest time. But the Wallet Card was only ever able to draw money from your Wallet balance.\n\nIt was nice that it was instant to load.. but you still had to take out your phone, add funds, and then use the physical card. \n\nThis limitation was one of the reasons it didn't really take off.",

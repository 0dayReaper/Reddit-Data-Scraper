I don't know if I should say too much but I'm sure clever people can figure it out!\n\nEdit: I wasn't looking to make this a guessing game guys! \n\nJust want to say that these products are incredible and I'm looking forward to the future of Google products especially their phones and computers (Pixelbook is the fastest computer I've ever used!). If you have the means or find a good deal, take advantage of these products where you can!",

That means, the more people create Tiktok, the less each creator makes. \n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/tiktok-stars-creator-fund-payouts-222006327.html\n\nTiktok made 4 billion last year.",

I'm sure Tiktok is raking in money hand over fist even more than they say they are.\n\nI have a hard time seeing TikTok, or any streaming platform, ever being as generous as YouTube is with ad revenue. Even YouTube uses a limited creator fund for Shorts rather than the standard revenue split for normal videos.\n\nThe biggest people on TikTok will be fine because they can get sponsorships but we'll see how much the small to medium sized creators can suffer with their not large enough audiences and tiny revenue from the company. Another app will come along and those smaller creators will jump ship to become the whales on the new one and the cycle will continue again.",

I've been using it ever since for about a year now. \n\nI haven't had a single problem with it minus the fact that there is a mild yet noticable audio/video desync for YouTube. But I very much recommend.\n\nI use it for YouTube stream VODs or podcasts and simply googling anything else, primarily cooking recipes, since those websites are AWFUL with ads.\n\nHope this helps.

It's either every single youtuber held accountable directly by DMCA, or youtube give copyright holder a tool to strike and let youtube then handle internally. Go watch game theory analysis in this for more.\n\nAnd youtube premium does pay creators, a lot actually. Go watch LTT revenue video.

But prior to this, a dmca notice could be appealed and while it was being appealed, whoever issued the notice got ALL of the revenue. Meaning that even in cases where there was no copyright infringement, they get the revenue. YouTube straight up allowed anyone who submitted a dmca to take money from content creators.\n\nNow the system freezes the money earned from being paid out until the dispute is resolved. I'm aware that premium pays out a lot to creators. I'd use it and pay for it if they made a fair platform.",

I also don\u2019t use Youtube Music.\n\nPersonally, between uBlock for desktop/mac and using the vinegar safari extension for iPad and iPhone I\u2019m getting things done. The only disadvantage is that navigation in a mobile browser is shittier than in-app, but using the desktop version in the iPad is totally worth it IMO.",

I had YT music for a year or two and, after that, Pandora\u2019s was a breath of fresh air. YouTube sucks as a paid service and, as with everything else, will jump in price or fragment features into tiers, nerf sharing without paying significantly more and so on\u2026 Dropped YouTube TV this month after nearly doubling in price, within less than a year.",

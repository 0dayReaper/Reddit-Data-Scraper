    "postText": "I've noticed that most YouTube channels these days have started to misuse the power YouTube has handed them in moderating their comments section. I understand the trolling they face, but now criticisms are being put in the same category as well. However, the creators don't want others to think that their comments are being deleted, so they \"hide the user\" from their channel permanently.\n\nI always try to be respectful in my criticisms, avoiding personal attacks, yet I'm being hidden from too many channels. This creates the perception that everyone thinks positively about the video's content, which is a deliberately created perception to mislead the masses.\n\nCertainly, YouTube has made the comments section \"safe,\" but is it still useful? What's the difference between a comments section full of bots versus one full of people who only think one way about the video?\n\nMy suggestion is to remove the \"hide the user from the channel\" option and replace it with \"hide the comment.\" Additionally, YouTube should automatically hide a user from a channel if their comments are being hidden or deleted too frequently (perhaps three times in three months). This would keep the comments section useful, allowing people to express themselves freely while still giving creators the power to moderate it.\n\nFurthermore, YouTube could inform the user that their comment has been hidden, similar to how Reddit does it. This would provide people with the opportunity to consider what led the creator to make such a decision.",

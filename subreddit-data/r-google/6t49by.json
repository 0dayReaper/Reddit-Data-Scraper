He absolutely deserved to be fired, and Google had to do so to continue to comply with California law.\n\nI can't speak to the rest of the memo, but as a medical doctor, the section focusing on biology, gender, etc. is absolute horseshit and betrays a lack of understanding of how multifactorial those subjects are. It's an issue I see a lot when engineers or coders talk about genetics or medicine, and I am sure I sound equally as foolish discussing their areas of expertise. ",

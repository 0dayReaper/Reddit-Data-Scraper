Yes, Chrome uses Chromium, not sure why you brought that up like it's uncommon knowledge given the name of each project.\n\nAnd yes, it's Google's software. You don't have to look past a single Google search to find this out. And the extreme majority of the codebase is written by Google as well. Open-sourcing it under the BSD license doesn't change either of these facts.",

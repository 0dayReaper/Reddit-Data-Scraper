Or moving features closed off by Play Services to AOSP. Or getting rid of SafetyNet, and stop fighting against custom ROMS, so we can add what's missing ourselves.",

It's ridiculous it's not a thing yet and a per app volume mixer would be handy.\n\nBut I am against putting stuff from Google Play Services into AOSP. Stuff that simply requires a Google Play Update would suddenly require manufacturers to make a full blown OTA update. Which would make features very late on non Google devices (as was the case in the past).\n\nI am also against getting rid of SafetyNet. Also, no one is fighting against custom ROMs. There are still countless options and Google phones are literally the easiest phones to unlock.\n\nLook, riding the hate train might be convenient for you, but I advise you to actually use a bit of logic and reasoning.",

It's great and all that we use the Android Open Source Project, it's not so much when you find out half of it's features come in a closed down proprietary vendor locked module. And you have to use it, otherwise apps built around it don't work well or don't work at all.\n\nNot to mention if everyone collaborated, everyone including the HW makers, there wouldn't be a need for such modules, we could be updating software the same way we do on the PC, no matter the HW. But that brings less money to the table, so the perfectly working HW becomes E-waste after 2 years.\n\nThere's no reason a McDonalds app should care about if I have root or not. It's my device, let me do what I want with it. What I find funny is that a lot of banking apps don't allow root, but at the same time, they allow logging in through the web on an old unsupported Windows machine, that's way more likely to be an issue. Windows security in general is horrible compared to Android.",

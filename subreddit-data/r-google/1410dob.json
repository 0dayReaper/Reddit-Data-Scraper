I hate this.\n\nWhen I use advanced tools to set the search time period to \"the last week\" or whatever, I'm getting traditional text results.\n\nBut if I set it to \"Anytime\", it's showing image previews in non-image searches.\n\nThis just started a few hours ago for me. This is on the iPhone, Chrome browser.",

I have to attach reddit or \"site:\" to get the good stuff.\n\nThe sad thing is, Google knows they're collectively fucking it up, but investors are happy with YoY gains so no one corrects this mess. Sundar gets his bonus, some google engineer gets a good performance review for 2% gain in ad sales, and everyone claps while disintegrating this product.",

Videos and images bug me unless I can't get information any other way and I generally prefer to watch streams after they've broadcast so I can increase the speed and skip ahead.\n\nI feel more like this whole \"GenZ prefers images\" thing is probably cooked data designed to justify slowing people down and boost site retention and ad engagement by wasting people's time and that seems to be a consensus view of young millennials I know IRL and on socials, who really hate whenever sites shift to video.\n\nGen Z was raised on listicles, not images.",

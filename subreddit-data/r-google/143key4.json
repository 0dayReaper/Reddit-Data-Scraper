Small fluctuations are expected on month to month and nothing from that page indicates any outliers or shift.\n\nThey're all basically flat and any slight change in those numbers at that scale are likely to be just normal usage fluctuations.",

Meaning that they're refining these models by using user feedback (the prompts that appear post search) and actions (what the user did). It's why the models improve overtime.\n\nA training group and engineering team can only correct so much in the development phase. It's why virtually all of the major model improvements across various AI projects don't start seeing real quality improvements until they release to a larger set of users. It's also why they usually launch to growing sets of users (beta phases) and are free at first -- you're providing free data work for them in exchange for free use.",

If they have to show me a loading animation, they have already failed.  Especially so, for a text-based communication medium.\n\nThe amount of information that Google needs to send me, for the email web interface, would literally fit in a single Ethernet packet, and could be formatted by a modern computer processor in the blink of an eye, but it takes thousands of Ethernet packets and billions of processor instructions for\u2026 the loading animation.  Actually displaying the email animation takes far more.\n\nMeanwhile, Chromebooks have nearly the same Intel processor architecture that they did five years ago, but Google's web interfaces run at a fraction of the speed.",

If that is, let's say less than 5%, I would call it a unpopular opinion. \n\nWell, I looked at the comments and I saw quite a lot of comments similar to yours. Hence, not unpopular. Especially considering the fact that negative feedback is given more readily. \n\nBut Anyway, I could ask the same to you? Why do you say that it IS unpopular? If I had to guess why you think it is unpopular, is the fact that you have learned that if a company changes something, it will always be challenged with criticism. This is due to the fact that human like stability and order (statistically speaking). So at first, more people will dislike the new icons than like them.\n\nWhat you might have done is recognize that and thought that if you said you liked the icon, that would make you look smarter. Now, to be clear, I am not saying that is what is happening, but it is a possibility. I definitely was guilty of doing that at some point in my life. Ego is funny sometimes.",

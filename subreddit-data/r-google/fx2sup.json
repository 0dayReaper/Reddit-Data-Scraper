A search for\u00a0site:nytimes.com\u00a0will work, but\u00a0site: nytimes.com\u00a0won\u2019t.\n\nRefine image searches\n\nOverall Advanced Search\n\nGo to\u00a0Advanced Image Search.\n\nUse filters like region or file type\u00a0to narrow your results.\n\nAt the bottom, click\u00a0Advanced Search.\n\n#Search for an exact image size\n\nRight after the word you're looking for, add the text\u00a0imagesize:widthxheight. Make sure to add the\u00a0dimensions in pixels.\n\nExample:\u00a0imagesize:500x400\n\n##Common search techniques\n\n#Search social media\n\nPut\u00a0@\u00a0in front of a word to search social media. For example:\u00a0@twitter.\n\n#Search for a price\n\nPut\u00a0$\u00a0in front of a number. For example:\u00a0camera $400.\n\n#Search hashtags\n\nPut\u00a0#\u00a0in front of a word. For example:\u00a0#throwbackthursday\n\n\n#Exclude words from your search\n\nPut\u00a0-\u00a0in front of a word you want to leave out. For example,\u00a0jaguar speed -car\n\n#Search for an exact match\n\nPut a word or phrase inside quotes. For example,\u00a0\"tallest building\".\n\n#Search within a range of numbers\n\nPut\u00a0..\u00a0between two numbers. For example,\u00a0camera $50..$100.\n\n#Combine searches\n\nPut \"OR\" between each search query.

For example,\u00a0site:youtube.com\u00a0or\u00a0site:.gov.\n\n#Search for related sites\n\nPut \"related:\" in front of a web address you already know. For example,\u00a0related:time.com.\n\n#See Google\u2019s cached version of a site\n\nPut \"cache:\" in front of the site address.\n\nImportant:\u00a0Not all search operators return exhaustive results.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

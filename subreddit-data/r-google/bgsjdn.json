It would take my entire Monday to finish it, and I would even stay an hour or more extra to finish it if needed.\n\nThen one time after working on it all day, I've emailed everyone without attaching it. 2 days later for some reason I opened my sent email. When I saw I didn't actually attach anything my first reaction was panic, only to be quickly replaced with sadness/disappointment when I realized that none of my 30 recipients had noticed it. 8-9 hours of my life every Monday, creating a report that no-one read :(  \n\nIf only the email client told me that I didn't attach anything. I would still be blissfully thinking that what I did all day at work mattered",

I did a contract 10+ years ago for a small company that made a ton of websites, wedding planning, cooking, hunting, golf, hockey, tech, the works. You had to be a member and create an account, some fields where mandatory, name, age, sex, email, others were optional, income, occupation, kids, marital status. You would not believe how many people would fill this optional stuff out.\n\nBeing the team lead and working on a few sites over a few months, I realized what the true nature of the business was, selling your info. There was nothing showing these sites were all owned by the same company, when you signed up for more than one site, it would correlate your info, gathering more and more detail about you, male, 34, likes golf, hockey, married, has kids, all sold to whomever would pay. Huge Morel, existential crisis, great job, great people, great money, but I realized I am just a spammer, I am part of the problem, I did not renew the contract when it was over. Found out they went bankrupt as they screwed over Google for advertising, something about \"double dipping\".\n\nBut again nothing new, my first job out of college in the very early 90's was for a direct marketing company, read, junk mail. We didn't do the mailing, we just read in the massive, reel to reel, tapes that were sent to us, did a merge and purge, kick out the duplicates, did address correction, and wrote the software for the high speed laser printers to print out the mail and envelopes. The mailing companies, especially the charities, bought, sold and rented these lists like crazy, you give money to one charity and boom, you were on every charity mailing list.\n\nBesides Reddit, I keep a low social profile, no FB, no LinkedIn, no twitter, my own server for web hosting, email and cloud. Not paranoid per se, but from actually seeing and, I guess, coding for this stuff, not worth it IMHO.",

I have contracted for banks that made it impossible to do end to end testing, they refused to set up a development database, so we set up a service that pretend to act like a database for testing, but the real testing was in production, a \"soft\" launch, can't see any problems there... \ud83d\ude44\n\nOn the other side, I contracted for a huge, unnamed, ISP/cell phone company. I contacted the DBA for a data extract for our development database, these are normally scrubbed of sensitive data. The dude emails me a million customer records, names, address, contact info, credit card info, the works, no scrubbing done. I contact him, saying, you really giving a contractor this kind of data? He was just like, meh, don't have time for scrubbing...\n\nAny developer and/or DBA with the right access can get, keep, sell, a fuck ton of company data and release/sell it, with relative ease.\n\nDon't even get me started on key loggers on internal keyboards... A person gets a job as a cleaner for the company cleaning service, they note the keyboard make/model of specific employees. They swap out the keyboard with one that has a hardwired keylogger and transmits usernames, passwords etc. Boom, data stolen from inside...",

When investigating, that is when they find the loggers.\n\nThen... Every company I have ever worked/contracted for, requires you to lock your computer when you leave your desk, if you have a laptop, they also require you to use the Kingston lock. There is a reason why you can't \"badge tailgate\", time after time we would hear\n of a guy in a suit and a sachet had just walked in a stole laptops and/or had just sat down at an unlocked computer and did their business. One company, they owned the whole building, you needed to badge in to the outside door, badge the elevator before pressing the floor button, then badge in the door on the floor. When checking surveillance cameras, people just let them in... When asked, they would say, because they were in a suit, they thought they were supposed to be there... \n\nBefore the 2005 laws came into effect, it was quite common for a developer to have a production computer under their desk. A major international bank I contracted for, had someone walk out with a production computer \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. These weren't server style systems, just powerful desktops turned into a server.\n\nIn my experience, more data breaches happen inside than a hacker from outside.",

It is only about storing cookies used for *personalization*.  \n\nA cookie could be a string that identifies(see note) the user and thus ads to be personalized to the user, or it could be a Boolean (true, false) that controls a setting on a website.  The former is a personalization cookie and covered by the EU policy, that latter cannot be used for personaliztion because it has only two values many people will have the same value and thus can\u2019t be destinguished by that cookie.  EU law only applies to the first type of cookie, and many people (prehaps including people that are responsible for creating the policy in the first place) don\u2019t even understand that the second type of cookie exists.\n\nNOTE: For cookies that identify the user they need to store any thing that is unique to each user this in princible could be a government identifier like your social security number, driver\u2019s license or something else unique to each indvidual like the precise date and time to the millisecond of their birth or death, their bank account, phone number, or an image of their finger prints.  However, all of these things first cause massive privacy issues and many aren\u2019t universal (for example not everyone has a driverlicisens or fingers), furthermore none of these are actually known by the website so it would require the user to input them to use the website (and in the case of time of death isn\u2019t known by anyone on Earth, making it impossible to enter).\n\nGiven all that what every website does do is generate a large random number for each user and store that.  This is good because the cookie can\u2019t be used to derive any of the above information.  (Techinally if somehow you had a list of cookie\u2019s to bank accounts you could use the cookie to discover a person\u2019s bank account, in this case I consider the list to be the privacy violation not the cookie it self.)\n\nHope that is helpful to someone.",

When you install the app in the first place, you don't know \"what's in it.\" Don't act like an update is going to add something different than what's already there - most of the time companies like Facebook try to update the app a couple times a week.\n\n2.) When you get an update, there is no way they're sneaking in something harmful - Android security is still in place, and you will still need to grant access for important things.\n\n3.) Whenever you log on to Facebook on the web, even within the same day, odds are, you're not viewing the same version of Facebook you were last time. But since you don't see a download, you don't think about it.\n\nSo what do you think is actually going on here? Take off the tin foil hat. Odds are, it's a breaking bugfix that affected a small number of users, or maintenance on the back end service to make things faster and/or more secure. They don't need to give a changelog for stuff that we wouldn't understand in the first place.",

I don't even use FB, but with auto-updates enabled I barely notice when the apps I do use update, it just doesn't matter, they're services that run (or don't) and how we get there isn't important.\n\nIf app updates were completely invisible, not very many people would care at all, and there would be less whining over release notes that matter even less.",

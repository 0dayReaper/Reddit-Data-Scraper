I didn't want to spoil his fun so I kept quiet, but every single feature that he was excited about are features that installed on my phone after I bought it, and my phone is over 2 years old.\n\nIn my eyes the software is not only completely separate from the phone, but it's also completely free and usually just involves installing an apk. Android is very good at making these sort of extra features integrate with the rest of the OS, so it feels like those features are just part of the phone. \n\nIf I put the Google assistant on my Nexus 6P can I sell it to you for $700?",

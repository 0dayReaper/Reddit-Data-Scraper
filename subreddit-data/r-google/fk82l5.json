When Samsung switched to a non-removable battery, on the Note 5, they also made the battery smaller, not larger, and they switched to a slower processor, to keep the battery life in line.  The camera size in the Note 4 is 1/2.6\", and it shrunk slightly to 1/2.5\" on the Note 5, so the camera was also smaller and lower quality.",

Telegram and even WhatsApp now surpass it by a lot from all the features that iMessage provides these days. Only feature iMessage has going for it is to be able to react to messages. Apart from that I don't see myself using iMessage at all these days.\n\nEdit: Anyone care to provide actual arguments instead of mindlessly downvoting what is honestly true? Thanks",

That\u2019s a big deal when doing business or other adult things. RCS is much better than SMS and MMS in practically every way. You can watch videos, play games, work on PDFs back and forth, send high res video, and a load of other things you just can\u2019t do without having to coordinate which third party app to use, it literally does it all the corky things to like built in GIF search engine, Animoji( where you can make yourself a cartoon), and you can stamp anywhere in the chat with costume stickers. Also not using third party apps cuts down security risks, risks that Apple do not have very much of. Especially compared to the competition. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m an Android fan, but pretending that iMessage is not top of class is just silly. \ud83d\ude42",

In addition I would also like a worse user interface that lacks elements such as a segmented switch and worse haptic feedback/precision on my touchscreen.\n\nAndroid does have some phones with better cameras but I don\u2019t see how you can outperform Apple who makes the hardware and the software - the advantage is so big it can\u2019t be understated. I don\u2019t see any reason to own an android over iPhone other than price really. Apple is getting very greedy with their prices so if people decide to get android over iPhone for that reason it\u2019s totally understandable but the two can\u2019t really be compared.",

(Yeah, I get it, it's a North American thing. China uses WeChat, and everyone else uses WhatsApp.)  \nNeed to transfer video and pictures to and from my phone? Gotta upload them to Google Drive, then download them. iPhone users walk into my office and airdrop the files.  \nWant to send large media files to another person, well you can't. Maybe they have an iPhone, and can use iMessage between each other. I'm on AT&amp;T, so their damned version of RCS ONLY works between AT&amp;T phones.  \nHonestly it pisses me off that Android is actually getting in the way, instead of being the answer.  \n  \nLet's add to that that the Android OS gets locked down a little tighter each version. Sure I can still use other app stores, for now.  \nAnd the Pixel, that thing looks and acts more and more like an iPhone each generation.  \nI'm honestly just frustrated with Google's decisions on Android.",

Completely crushing netscape and other competitors. They used their monopoly of one market (Operating Systems) to gain in another market (Web Browsers). At the time, browsers were not free.\n\nMicrosofts actions had terrible consequences on the web (web standards),  and it took over a decade for their unfair dominance to fall again. The US and the EU vowed to never let that shit happen again.\n\nGoogle bundling their online market with search is no different,  they are using their monopoly (Search) to promote their entrance into another Market (online shopping). It may seem annoying but they are trying to stop another Internet Explorer situation.\n\nGoogle knew exactly what they were doing. They just gambled they wouldn't get called on it.",

For white labels, the CTM must include the partner\nsupplier\u2019s tariffs, but not the tariffs of the supplier\u2019s other white labels.\n\nBecause that sounds like you *must* put cheaper tariffs from competitors on but you *don't have to* put cheaper tariffs from your own other branded groups.\n\nThis document from ofgem:\n\nhttps://www.ofgem.gov.uk/ofgem-publications/97298/inclusionofcollectiveswitchtariffsinthectm-pdf\n\nSuggests that they *want* you to add it\n\n&gt; The CTM acts as a one-stop-shop for consumers to find a better deal with their current\nsupplier.

Completely crushing netscape and other competitors. They used their monopoly of one market (Operating Systems) to gain in another market (Web Browsers). At the time, browsers were not free.\n\nMicrosofts actions had terrible consequences on the web (web standards),  and it took over a decade for their unfair dominance to fall again. The US and the EU vowed to never let that shit happen again.\n\nGoogle bundling their online market with search is no different,  they are using their monopoly (Search) to promote their entrance into another Market (online shopping).

They won't trigger alarms unless they're already open and/or the developer jumps through loopholes to basically escalate the app to the foreground (not easy) on a push notification (because background processing is limited; this also means your alarm won't work if your internet goes down). \n\n[The Rock Clock had a good writeup about this](https://blog.goposse.com/why-the-rock-clock-ios-app-must-stay-on-all-night-b4cb6eba1448).",

If you manually stand up and go up to one of those, turn the light off, wait about 1-2 seconds, then turn it on most smart lights (e.g. Philips Hue, Tradfri) will turn on then. It's important to be in the right ballpark for timing though, as being too quick or too slow will not work.\n\nIf all is lost, you can also rapidly turn it on and off about 6 times which resets most smart lights. Note: this will also unpair the light, so caution is advised before choosing this option.\n\nIf you have a local app on your phone, that will also likely work without having to involve Google at all; many of these even work if there is an ISP outage as they only need to communicate through your local WiFi network, or Bluetooth.\n\nThese are about all the options that I can think of.",

            "comment": "Are some youtube employees  in cahoots with other platforms? Google should be more involved in the whole review and complaints process, because youtube employees are just doing what they please and don't give two fucks they taking livelihoods away....\n         \n Hi I think this is probably not the right place to put this but here goes, I cannot put it in YouTube  subreddit as my problem lies with the very first internal team that appeals go to... The problem I have is I had my  whole channel taken off the partnership program,  put back on took back off, put back on again after many many months and all this started after I had a dispute with Rumble Viral... over payments... they deleted my whole channel after I asked questions they did not want to answer it seems and they will not reply to any of my requests asking for a breakdown of all payments recieved from youtube and third parties and I only ever recieved 0.005 per cpm for every thousand views, I have finally got my solicitor involved as what youtube states they did this for is utter nonsense  here is my story...\n\n\n. The  first reason they gave me was  misleading thumbnails ...which was not true as all my thumbnails where from the actual videos they  continued to insist this and a few days later  went as far as removing me from the partnership program without reasons again I contacted creator support they told me that It may not be the thumbnails but I must look at my whole channel go through all comments ...remove any videos that may impact my channel .  I went through all of my videos , removed all bad or rude comments .. Then appealed this decision. But the whole time I was talking to creator support and got absolutely no answers and no help whatsoever, I was talking to creator support the whole time I waited for me to be able to appeal...I got an email saying I was back on the partnership program. \n        Less than 6 weeks later they removed me again ... No reasons given just put my whole channel on Limited ads on night while I was going through my whole channel I saw every video go onto the yellow icon  then a couple of days later took me off the partnership program again no reasons given, no emails either. I tried and tried to get someone to tell me why this had happened yet again . No-one ever told me at that time then after many many tweets to youtube on twitter I finally got a response saying that they can confirm \"I had reused content and I could reapply after 30 days if I added Commentry\"  ...  This was simply not true either. I was confused but I had given my videos to a third party Rumble viral  to manage but we had a dispute and they decided they could not answer my questions and they felt It would be better If they gave me back ALL my videos. They even hinted at buying my channel off me  not that I would have ever contemplated this as I love doing youtube and I know it's forbidden aswell, so I was quiet shocked when they put that on their community forums for all to see.   .  ..AAfter they said I could have my videos back ((even though It was supposed to be perpetual) I agreed to this obviously as I had lost all confidence in this platform .The thing that actually did it for me was,  when I asked to see what one of my videos had earned they would not show me but sent a screenshot of a different videos earnings ...which confuse\u010f me If they could sent me that one, why not the one I asked about. and then found out they had not actually given me back my videos even though everything they said and did  I was even  sent emails stating my videos had been release\u010f by them from youtube... saying congratulations your video has been released...\n       It took me 8 months of trying to tell youtube I had not got any reused content  and all videos where mine, but I was constantly ignored. \n    I finally found savannah at ritual network, she helped me and was the only person who said she would, she proved to youtube the content was mine . YouTube put me back on the program instantly.... but to our shock they kept every single video of my channel as limited ads... they then refused to tell her why. I kept sending tweets  to youtube and I was again ignored  for over a year they did not tell savannah either we where again left guessing and now on the third reason youtube had given. \n     Two years  have now passed and I  have just  been given a reason again from YouTube Twitter.  Sexualised themes and misleading signals on my channel. This is not true My channel is of my pets and  all videos surround my family,  dogs, and  horses  they show how my dogs have a personality each one being very different from the other all my videos are very short. They show the bonds my dogs and horses have with family members, they show how a tiny Chihuahua called  Poppy has no concept of being small and will tell off  a huge Geman Shepherd, but only if her owners there to hide behind. They show horses can love their owner and and how naughty they can be and how intelligent also,  they show that horse can have tantrums and be ignorant too . They  show how intelligent all our Animals are. They show how a chihuahua can get jelous of the other dogs and how they seem to know if they have done something naughty. They show guilt, they show love excitement and also just how much they will actually put up with a tiny annoying little chihuahua. They all  just how much we love our pets and how much we see them as family members and how much they love us too. Each video shows a side to our animal that some people feel cannot be... they think they are not capable of all these emotions,  but they are and can feel and they can love we have quite a funny channel which educates people who don't have pets and who don't see them like we do. We had many comments on a our horse that hugs our daughter , they all thought she had treats in her pocket but she didnt she just loves to hug her. This channel was our only hope of hav\u00e8ing a decent life and earning enough money to carry on we are a very large family of 9 not  including our 6 dogs 2 horses, a bird,  3 cats and a chinchilla.. It is of great importance t9 all of us and  I have never gone against youtube guidelines, I never had any strikes or warnings on my channel )....UNTILL....I was took off the partnership program.  I then got a warning,  this video has been seen by everyone and no-one at all sees any sexual or nudity in this video , but that is what youtube deemed it as .  I would never  ever have anything like that on my channel and I don't see how YouTube came up with that one .. it even states action taken ...video removed .... it had not been removed....(FINALLY THE WARNING GOT IT REMOVED...2 YEARS DOWN THE LINE!) So I dont have a warning   ......\n      Ritual network have also looked though every single video and deemed every single video  fit for all advertisers. She and the whole crew cannot see what YouTube sees. It seems I have been punished for something  that is not true . I have now been given 4 different reasons for all of this . All untrue all proved false ... but will youtube put me back monetised. NO they just give a different excuse as to why this is the another and another. Please can you see that something is not quite right here. I don't know what's going on. Can anyone get me the help I need ...after many many appeals they all state the same ...  It s a joke my channel is a pet channel ...",

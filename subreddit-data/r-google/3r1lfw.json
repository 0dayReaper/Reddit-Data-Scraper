            "comment": "I've recently developed a deep hatred of Comcast despite being a customer for some time. My cable had issues and they sent out a technician. The technician realized that the issue was with the entire network in the neighborhood and send out network technicians to fix it. The following month I got charged by Comcast for the technician. I was so mad that they would charge ME to fix something that is wrong with THEIR service. Who does that? When I spoke to a rep on the phone, they told me that for $4.99/month I can get a Service Protection Plan so I don't have to pay for repairs. I was livid. I've tried several times to get them to remove the charge and so far it's been unsuccessful. The reps keep telling me that the charge has been removed and I've been refunded and I never get the refund. I wish there were better alternatives here in the Bay Area.",

Incredible that a company would have the audacity to provide poor services, then charge customers to have it fixed, and THEN act like they're doing a favor by offering a $5/mo SUBSCRIPTION (not one-time fee) to cover the repairs.",

It's telling that it takes a company the size of Google to advance the only real large competitive success, and even then it's facing incredible push-back from governments in many jurisdictions.\n\nI can't wait until Google Fiber comes to my area. I'm also rooting for them to ease some of the regulations in the industry: lowering the barrier to entry and allowing more local/regional companies to follow in Google's footsteps in markets that are too small for Google Fiber.",

They would not match it nor give me an offer that they were advertising online for a similar price (which went up by $5 over the night, btw). The best they'd offer was already double the price or they wanted to add services that I didn't care about at the same price. Right after I tried to negotiate with them my next bill increased by another $10, making it three times the WOW price. I just switched to WOW. Now they spam me with junk snail mail with offers asking, \"Did your WOW bill just increase?\"\n\nNo Comcast, no it didn't increase and your offers are still shit.",

If somebody bothers you, you pay them a small bribe and they get off your back. My Internet provider was at one point literally 4 guys in an attic a couple buildings over, and they were serving maybe 1000 people by the time someone bought them. If you called their \"support\" line, you got through to the admin/owner of the company.\n\nIn the developed world, if you try laying cable without getting through all of the red tape possible, you're going to jail, so nobody does it. And doing it officially is probably impossible due to regulations and heavy-duty lobbying by big players in the field.",

Innocent people have been in jail simply because google told the police they were nearby. That is not OK, that is something they should be fighting but aren't.  The police can get a flimsy warrant (that google should fight in court) asking for location info of everyone who was near x location on x date, and google finds everyone who was and gives them that data. Even if we have no idea whether the true criminal even had a cell phone... in the end citizen John Doe who was buying a pizza next door has his phone and is now prime suspect since google pointed the finger at him. The whole system is fucked and they are skimming money to participate.\n\n\nAnd the motto was completely removed.

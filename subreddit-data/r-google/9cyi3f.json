I recorded a short try in the game using the GIPHY capture tool.  I then placed the video file into after effects to add the type and \u201csmear\u201d effect. The aesthetic categories I investigated for this gif include meta, relateable, and narrative.  This gif is interesting because of the over-simplified nature of it, and relateable \u201cmeme-ness\u201d of it.",

They had an amazingly popular music platform, and it wasn't the platform they built for music.\n\nI've been a big Google fan for years, but honestly, I'm tired of platforms I use daily get canceled. GChat was created because GMail needed to compete with YahooMail. Hangouts was born because GooglePlus needed to compete with Facebook. Neither exist any more because YahooMail doesn't matter and GooglePlus doesn't exit. Hangouts is now part of their business suite offering as a competitor to Microsoft Teams and Slack. PlayMusic was created because Android needed an ~~Apple Music~~ iTunes competitor. So many of Google's free offering are tools to make another product successful. YouTube doesn't need YouTube Music for YouTube to be successful.\n\nSpotify needs Spotify to be successful for Spotify to be successful. That's *literally* their only job. I have zero trust that Google won't cancel YouTube Music in the next 2 years. I trust that Spotify's continued success is directly tied to their ability to offer an excellent product.",

I've long held that, once your earning half decent money, the choice to pirate anything is no longer about money, it's purely about convenience.  That's why I now have a huge Steam collection and don't pirate games.  GPM was that pinnacle of convenience for me, integrated into all of my Android devices and the price of entry also loses ads on YouTube, what's not to like?  Feel completely let down by this move and Google's indifference to user impact is now looking like the kind of arrogance I used to only see in Apple.\n\nThe one fortunate thing for me is that much of the music I like it's on Bandcamp, which offers streaming and MP3 download.  Free options to stream music from my NAS aren't great though, the QNAP Qmusic App is horrible... May have to consider Plex.",

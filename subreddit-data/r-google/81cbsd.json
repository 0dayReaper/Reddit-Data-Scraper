They probably weathered through so much between 1889 and 1983 (I don't even know what they did between making card games and video games), that the speed bump during the Wii U era was small peaches.\n\nEdit: so Nintendo's history is actually kinda interesting. It was a playing card company for the first 74 years of its existence, and it wasn't until '63 that Nintendo transitioned to other ventures after realizing playing cards were a limited market. These new ventures included taxi services, instant rice, and love hotels before shifting to toys in '73.",

Youtube is synonymous with streaming, user-uploaded video. As someone pointed out earlier in the thread, Youtube has *billions* of views per day in active users. And to top it off, it's free to upload to. If you want to make money, or even be popular, on the internet via video content, you have to upload to youtube (and/or Facebook, which makes *you pay* to have your followers view your content). To overtake Youtube, such a service would have to have a user experience that was not just better, but *overwhelmingly better*, than youtube in order to overtake the network effect. This is why G+ failed, even though the user experience was arguably so much better (\"circles\" were a fantastic feature). It simply could not overcome the massive network effect that Facebook had. In order to convince users to move in the first place, you would have to convince content creators to move; in order to convince content creators to move, they need to expect a userbase. The only possible way to break this catch-22 is to pay content-creators to move things exclusively to the new platform.\n\nAnd that's even assuming anyone could get the funding for something like that. Video bandwidth is expensive, and it remains expensive since resolution is expected to rise to match the available bandwidth (though this may finally start lessening in the coming decade since the benefit of resolutions above 4k, or arguably 1080, are negligible). As someone pointed out earlier in the thread, Youtube has *billions* of views per day in active users, has the full brunt of Google behind it to scale it and benefit from the economy of scale, and it's still not turning a profit. Anyone would have to be a moron to provide the kind of funding to someone who claims to be able to create a \"Youtube killer\" and turn a profit in this day and age.\n\nIt would take a cultural shift on the scale of the popularization of the internet or the creation of smartphones to topple youtube, and that's assuming that youtube misses the ball on that shift.",

When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.\n\nThe classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/google/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Same with their banner ad inventory which they recently opened to exchanges.\n\n1. Yes, they make their money on  advertising. However...while that traditionally was Adsense AND AdWords...search traffic is massively down (which extends the dollars that follow). This has lead Google to shift importance over to Adsense.... things like banner ads, preroll and AMP ads. More importantly they are allowing 3rd parties to play in a once locked off sandboxed like AMP.\n\n     The massive publisher I run direct sold ad solutions for just activated direct sold preroll on our YouTube pages. A quarter in and we've seen very health revenue as well as scale. We are not the only ones. So your 50% cut is more like a piss in the ocean. \n\nOh also pay for click is about as outdated as ctr. Engagement, tineaoent, viewabilit, etc. These are the success metrics of ads now-a-days. Pay for click is a waste of money for everyone involved. It wasn't when search was a thing, but like I said search traffic is massively down. \n\nBeyond that they make money through advertising via dfp and dbm. They make a healthy amount on the products as well. \n\nSo to reiterate .. Adsense and AdWords are not nearly as important to the rev stack as you think. Your article is from 2016. No one (especially Youtube) cares or felt you cutting your budget by 50%. \n\n",

Or just having all content screened by a massive network of humans, which is not feasible or realistic for obvious reasons. So YouTube is trying to make an algorithm that can do that, which is also very difficult.\n\nConclusion: now that people *expect* the money, because they are somehow able to make enough money just posting videos that its primary income... then it causes all sorts of drama when youtube gets in the way of their income. I don't see much reason for them to complain when its not like they are contractually obligated to this money, its all free bonus money that arrives due to the nature of youtube's monetiziation offering.

The thing about YouTube's subscription model is you get to pick and choose which creators you see. Pick non-shitty creators, you get a non-shitty YouTube. As long as there aren't any competitors, YouTube will be *the* platform for online videos and viewers and creators, good or bad, will keep coming. \n\nThe thing is, there has been good and bad content since before monetization has been a thing and there will continue to be good and bad content from people who have had their monetization pulled. I don't think the lack of monetization will mean the lack of good creators. It will mean they become less visible but they'll still be there. You even often hear creators talk about how people who are doing it for money are usually the ones with lower quality content while the side projects that people did because they're genuinely interested in it end up being of higher quality.  \n\nBesides, ads aren't the only way to make money on YouTube. People have brand deals, sponsorships, Patreon and merch. Even within YouTube itself there's Red money (which demonetized videos continue to receive) and they're even testing out their own sponsorship program where users can offer to pay creators directly through YouTube and YouTube doesn't even take a cut.

Granted iOS isn't in the best spot right now and Apple has pledged iOS 12 will be stability focused, but when there is effectively 2 mobile OSes, this is worth mentioning. It's also not even mentioning the flourishing of the Android One platform and Android Go, which will hopefully help resolve some of the update/fragmentation problems in Android, and bring smart mobile devices to the next billion, respectively.\n\nAndroid definitely does have issues. Their constant A/B testing does get old, but that's also how you iterate quicker. They definitely *do* need focus in the messaging space, as right now they have some options that have grown decent to excellent (Allo, Duo) but given their resources, they could *easily* dominate this space, but seem to lack focus.\n\nIn the end though these aren't huge things, and their core business of advertising is still huge and growing, they are leaps and bounds ahead of most other companies in neural networks/AI development, their smart assistant tech is probably the best, or at worst an extremely close second (although lacking market share currently), they offer excellent free other products (Gmail, Google Photos, etc.)\n\nGoogle, and Alphabet as a whole, are juuuust fine.",

Issues with copyright means you either need to do a lot of manual moderation or check each video through algorithms. Both options are very expensive, but not handling it means opening yourself up to the kind of lawsuits Youtube had to deal with years ago, before their acquisition by Google.",

YT and Google have spent 10+ years with tons of resources to make the platform what it is.  And make no mistake, it's fully engrained in our social fabric.\n\nWhere do we see new game announcements, movie trailers, news snippets, comedy sketches, entire cultural shifting forces? YouTube.  \n\nIt's kinda like how everyone calls it a Kleenex, no matter what the brand is.  Except way more complicated and powerful than a piece of tissue paper.\n\nHonestly, my biggest fear for YT is that it will become so ubiquitous that the Government will want to assume some sort of control over it similar to airwaves and content on broadcast channels, even if that's far fetched.",

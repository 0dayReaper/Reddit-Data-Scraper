    "postText": "I bought a Google nest hub 2 from Walmart today. \nThe biggest feature that I wanted was to see the calendar from the home screen. After trying it out for a couple of hours, I read online that the Google nest hub max has a customizable home screen. \nOkay fine, I returned my nest hub 2 and bought the nest hub max. \nI seriously still can't see my calendar? \nGranted, the speaker in the nest hub max is really nice, but it is otherwise disappointing.",

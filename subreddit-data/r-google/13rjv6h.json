    "postText": "Not sure why Google Maps doesn't have this already.\n\nI'm building a **mobile app** (like this chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/routora-google-maps-route/jdddfnfohdeaklgkpglonlofgapjgfbp) I built with 12k users) that takes my multi-stop route on Google Maps and rearranges it to give the fastest, most efficient route (*TSP Problem*). It basically tells me what stops I should go to in what order to ensure that I\u2019m spending the least amount of **time** and **gas** on the road.\n\nI'm looking for what kind of features you guys would like to see based on what you have experienced so far with Google Maps. Any feedback would be awesome! You can join the waitlist here: [App Waitlist:)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuZWly2YNaaxh4GDvOGJmv-OycnU1tF-KV9pAbEmmoNsG2TA/viewform)",

It comes in handy. I can audit, and even screen shot that data to my calendar/ accounting system for billing.\n\nOnt thing is does not do is say I want to see a list of dates I went to Client A's site. I  cannot. I can't export it either.\n\nI'd like to filter by addresses or my friendly names for a whole year. \n\nThis way I can audit all billable drive times for a client, and get that info from my employees. Missed appointment and travel times is serious $$$. \n\nNo, I have to start at Jan 1 and click through every day while watching the msp display that site. \n\nAs a plus, if I can export that information from that timeliness, to excel, or even Outlook (or any calendar, that too would be good. \n\nThat would be killer useful and worth paying for.",

One of the best most classic play lists ever, nothing else \u201cbeach\u201d, \u201ctropical\u201d, \u201csummer vibes\u201d or the like even comes close. \n\nSurely there is a track listing somewhere. I\u2019m not skilled enough to find it. I\u2019m this close to writing Google directly, but I humbly ask Reddit first \ud83d\ude42",

When they acquired Songza, it added that last bit of what they were missing. As /u/Ill_Location4524 pointed out, those incredibly curated playlists were a very solid start to a fantastic professional music discovery experience. The clean, simple UI, ability to integrate your own music library, and a great experience across platforms including PC made Play Music such a great product.\n\nYT Music has a UI that is often frustrating. Poorly curated playlists, poor search, poor desktop experience, poor integration of your own library, weird combination with YouTube content, and astonishingly slow development (how many years did it take to be able to Cast from the website?) have made YT Music feel like a prototype to Play Music.\n\nYes, YT Music does keep some of the good features, namely, the excellent ability to turn a playlist into a radio station. But that's the only standout feature anymore.\n\nI miss Play Music.",

Now Gmail dominates the market and Yahoo Mail is no longer a major competitor, so Talk doesn't exist. Hangouts existed because Google+ needed a Facebook Messenger competitor. Google Chat exists because Google Workspace needs a Teams competitor. Google Workspace is trying to fight for Office365's market share (which only are on the web now because Google Docs/etc took that market share from Microsoft) so they need to fill out their offerings.\n\nGoogle Music existed because Android needed an iTunes competitor. With Spotify and others, iTunes is no longer a major selling point of iPhones, so Google Music no longer server a purpose.\n\nGoogle doesn't actually care about these products. They are expensive to produce and maintain. They're often barely profitable or an active cost-sink. Or they canibalize other markets or product that Google care more about. Google cares about the products that these products prop up. \n\nGoogle had the absolute most popular music platform ever and it wasn't the platform they build for music; it was YouTube. With Spotify and Pandora, and others showing up on Android, Google didn't need an iTunes competitor any more, so closing Google Music and going all in on YouTube was the next logical choice. So even subscription products are on the chopping block against the face of Google's larger grand-strategy.\n\nSiri exists? Meet Google Assistant. Alexa? How about Google Home. ChatGPT? Bard time! You wouldn't be incorrect to believe that Google just doesn't innovate, they just copy.\n\nWhich is why I will never support a free Google product again. Even if there is a subscription. I'm subscribed to Spotify. Because Spotify's only goal is to make money with subscriptions. This product isn't going to go away because the parent company changed it's mind.\n\n(As I say that, I bought an Pixel Watch last month. And I love it. I'm a hypocrite. But I hope when Google drops it, there will be a really viable stand-alone replacement.)",

As for delisting, this has happened to me twice in a way that inconvenienced me, first time actually happened on Spotify, when [my favorite playlist at the time was suddenly removed from the platform for about a week](https://twitter.com/mitch_murder/status/1191745938957774855?s=20). The other time was a long mix I listened to frequently on Youtube, which was removed after like over a decade of being up, but then got reuploaded a day or two later with no problems. 99% of the time, with music on youtube, a video isn't struck down, instead, it is automatically claimed by the record label or the original creators, and they make money off the ads for that video. The delisting/deletion thing doesn't really happen very much if at all for me in general, and I have been using Newpipe for years. Generally, all the channels that upload music they like to youtube have a passion to archive songs and keep them up.",

NewPipe does not use your Google account, so they cant disable it (and I dont know of any cases where they have, even with apps like YT Vanced). And to get IP-banned you have to hammer YouTube's API with thousands of requests per minute.\n\nYouTube Vanced in comparison was illegal.

All the radio features are from Play Music. Playlists are worse, the personal library is worse, the desktop experience is worse, the TV App is actually non-existent (so, far worse), search is worse, music discovery is OK but not really *better* than Play Music, equalizer is hard to get to, there's space wasted in the app on content that isn't even music (like news shows on YouTube), and it shares the history setting with YouTube so I can't have YouTube history off without it also forgetting my listening history. Also, now it shoves music in my YouTube recommendations. The whole thing is a mess. If it weren't for the playlists to radio feature that came from Play Music, I'd probably just get rid of it at this point.",

My understanding is that what you're really doing is licensing it from them. \n\nIn American law there's something called the first sale doctrine, which basically says when you buy something you can then do what you want with that thing, e.g. you may lend it to someone, give it to someone, resell it, etc. In Capitol records v redigi (redigi was an online second market where people could resell their itunes \"*purchases*\") it was ruled that the first sale doctrine did not apply to digital goods.\n\nI \"*buy*\" movies from Google too. Usually I only buy them if they're discounted and, personally, I try to buy them physically first on eBay or something (RIP Second Spin) just because these companies (all of them) can delete it at any time. \n\nI'm not a lawyer so everything there could be wrong but I think the gist of it is right.",

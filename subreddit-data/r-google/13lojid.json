    "postText": "Had to quit using Google search yesterday, after what 15 years. Everything was fine up until a few weeks ago, something changed... . I am not savvy enough to analyze it but I couldn't do a search without doing multiple, monotonous captchas. Maybe Google AI has determined that it has all of the data they need from me, therefore no profit in providing search results..... . Google wins! Bing has not let made me do one yet. Will stick with this until something prompts me to try another search engine. May migrate away from Gmail and the rest as well as there are just so many options.",

This started 9 months ago, but the weirdness with the infuriating captchas every time i launch a search has only been for a few weeks. Hope you find a solution, its a pity but after a day of bing, it isnt so bad. Hope it stays this way.",

In the US they now have over 85% share of the market.\n\nI assume kids are going to pretty quickly start getting training on how to use Google AI tools.\n\nThis is also going to be so helpful for the kids.  The future is learning how to use these tools and how to apply them.\n\nI have a son that is soon to graduate with a Marketing degree and I sat him down and told him that he should be really spending time learning Bard.   That this is the future.",

Too many people see AI as a bad thing, but the future is knowing how to use it.\n\nCheck out the [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/@TwoMinutePapers) YouTube channel if you haven't already. It's a great way to see what the future of AI is going to look like.",

Kind of funny that in another window I am building up my YouTube play list for my long run.\n\nI have been mostly trying to find as much content as possible that speculate what things will be like socially/politically/business from the transformers and the key being the attention aspect.\n\nI am old and started on the Internet in 1986.  I spent a lot of time writing and talking with others on what things would look like in the future with the Internet.\n\nLots we got right.  But one thing we really missed was that the Internet was going to basically break capitalism.   Really did not for see that one company was going to have over 93% share of search.\n\nWe honestly thought that the Internet would make it so anyone could compete as you no longer had huge infrastructure cost to get started.  You could just build a web site.\n\nIt would greatly increase competition.\n\nI read just about everything I could find in the very early days of the Internet and not once did I see someone suggest this was going to happen.\n\nThe transformer breakthrough is so huge that it is going to cause all kinds of massive change.  I really enjoy reading speculation on what it will be like.   Like 10 years from today.",

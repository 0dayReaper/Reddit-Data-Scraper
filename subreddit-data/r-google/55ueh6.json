If a customer asks, you don't trash the competiton.  That makes you look bad.  You then tell the customer that you want to explain the differences.  And you better have compelling differences.",

That's always been the biggest headache for me with bluetooth.  I have a bluetooth enabled DAC so I can use my headphones across the room.  Sometimes I like to have it connect to my PC, sometimes I like to have it connect to my NP.  However, once I connect it to one device, I can't just easily switch to another.\n\nMy mouse handles this with a physical button for switching devices.  It's an OK solution to the problem but I'm limited to only 3 devices.  Furthermore, I dual boot on my machines and pairing with bluetooth in Windows counts as 1 device and pairing bluetooth in Linux counts as another.  ",

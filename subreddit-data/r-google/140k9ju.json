    "postText": "Hi everyone I want to share a recent experience I just had. Would like to know what you think. \n\nContext: I purchased two new Google nest doorbell battery models when they first launched. This was before the new Google nest doorbell wired was even a thing. I made sure to wire my battery doorbells to power so unless I have a power outage would be the only time the battery would kick in. I am also subscribed to the nest aware plus which allows for 24/7 recording. \n\nStory: one of my neighbors had their car stolen which was parked in front of my house. He asked me if I had any video footage of what happened. When I checked I thought I would be able to see the full recording.. But nope Google decided to only show a few seconds of what occurred. I saw the last time the car was parked and then I saw when the car drove off. I was unable to see who stole the car because for some reason Google doesn't allow my wired battery doorbell to capture all details. I shared what I had with my neighbor and the police. \n\nIssue: I called Google to see what can be done. Either 1. Give them back my battery doorbells for wired ones that record 24/7 or 2. Push out a software update that would allow battery doorbells that are hard wired and have the nest aware plus subscription to be able to get 24/7 recording. They pretty much told me \"yes I see you have the nest aware plus subscription but it's not compatible with your Google nest doorbell model\". \ud83d\ude11 Oh I see.. so I have been paying for something that I don't need because it not only isn't compatible it also doesn't work. Great... Then they said I need to ask Google Store if they do trade ins or refunds. If not then I would have to repurchase new set of nest doorbell wired models. This is horrible service imo. Not very happy with this outcome and I'm a huge Google fan.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Does anyone know of a way to get 24/7 recording on my setup? AITA here? \n\nIf anyone from Google is part of this community feel free to reach out if you can help me. Thanks.",

Today, we use \u201cLuddite\u201d as a pejorative referring to backwards, anti-technology reactionaries.\n&gt; \n&gt; This proves that history really is written by the winners.\n&gt; \n&gt; In truth, the Luddites\u2019 cause wasn\u2019t the destruction of technology \u2013 no more than the Boston Tea Party\u2019s cause was the elimination of tea, or Al Qaeda\u2019s cause was the end of civilian aviation. Smashing looms and stocking frames was the Luddites\u2019\u00a0tactic, not their\u00a0goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; In truth, their goal was something closely related to science fiction: to challenge not the technology itself, but rather the social relations that governed its use.\n&gt; \n&gt; The critique of Luddism as anti-technology is as shallow a reading of the Luddites as the critique of science fiction as nothing more than speculation about the design of gadgets of varying degrees of plausibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; In truth, Luddism and science fiction concern themselves with the same questions: not merely\u00a0what\u00a0the technology does, but who it does it\u00a0for\u00a0and who it does it\u00a0to.\n\nCory Doctorow on why Luddites were not anti-technology.\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2022/01/10/see-you-in-the-funny-papers/#ned-ludd",

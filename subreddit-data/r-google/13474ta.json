After searching for a solution online, I was advised to go to Google Pay to 'fix the payment method.' I followed the instructions and changed my payment method from an E-wallet to a debit card. I tried the payment again, and it was successful (the money was deducted from my debit card).\n\nHowever, my YouTube account status is still not premium, and when I clicked on \"manage subscription\" in Google Pay, it still doesn't show as a premium subscription. Nevertheless, the money has already been deducted, and Google Pay indicates that I have a YouTube Premium subscription, even though I don't actually have one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovn1zno7zm5b1.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bb3e823d41300ba0a5d27d360bae0da82d0ee1e5\n\nSo, I decided to try activating it on my PC, and it worked. Unfortunately, my money was deducted again for this attempt. Now, I have two YouTube Premium subscriptions (only one of which is working), and I am unable to cancel the first one.\n\nI need assistance!",

I have a question that quick googling only partly helped with, I'm not sure this is the place but if not could you point me to where I could ask this...\n\nBasically I was on my phone for reasons and got a security alert saying there had been a login from a Windows computer, which didn't seem possible (I do have a computer running Windows but I wasn't on it and it was sleeping) so I said it wasn't me and changed my password as indicated.\n\nMy question is, if an intruder did log into my account how much damage could we be talking in the few minutes it took to change the password? What are the most likely things they could have been after and are there specific things I should look out for or do to avoid further problems? (I saw one site saying to change all my passwords stored in my account, which... that's a lot. I changed the paypal one at least because there's money there but otherwise...)",

I am responsible for creating a new gmail account for every new hire, but we can\u2019t afford to make domain email addresses for everyone. So I make them a free gmail account. The issue I\u2019m facing is that when you make a google account it asks you to verify with a real phone # but you can only use each phone # a certain # of times. I\u2019ve used everyone\u2019s phone # in the company and am now resorting to family member\u2019s #s.

Need to be able to change phone # frequently and at any time\n2. Need to be able to receive Google verification codes\n3. It needs to be cheap, but it\u2019s probably going on my personal cell so nothing scammy\n\nI\u2019ve tried: google voice (have maxed out #s and verification codes) and text now didnt work with verification codes.\n\nPlease help.

Complete happenstance but I can't be the first one I would hope. So I activate the new card which deactivated the old one.\n\nI notice I have a failed charge for like $1800 on the account to some random address in Texas. I immediately log in to my account, change my password, and force log the account out of all signed in devices.\n\nGoogle sent me a notification shortly after about the charge and that they froze my Google pay account. To fix this, I need to go to their page, click the bell, click verify my account. No big deal.\n\nHowever, they don't tell you a couple things. A) when you click verify your account gets charged a random amount between like $1-$3. You then use this info to verify the amount charged - pretty standard practice. B) They're trying to charge my old card that was deactivated. So I never see the charge because it instantly gets declined from being an inactive card. C) you can't add a new card because the account is frozen until verified. I assume to stop your account being used as a proxy for stolen cards en masse. \n\nAfter repeatedly following their steps I get a phone call from my card issuer saying Google has like 9 different attempts to charge my account this random amount of money and they flagged that as potential fraud. I tell them no, it's me trying to verify the account and she says OK, but it won't ever post on this card because it's inactive.\n\nI've gone back and forth with the Google Pay support team, on the phone, on email, on their chat, and THEY KEEP SUGGESTING I CLICK THE VERIFY NOW button like I haven't done 50 times already. In my very first email I sent a screenshot of this failure (at the request of the rep I was speaking to on the phone) and they just don't seem to understand what is happening. I never get a chance to verify because they're charging a closed card. \n\nI call again, and after listening to my story I've laid out here, the rep literally asks me to try again now. Same issue. You never get a chance to verify. So I ask to talk to a supervisor. The rep says nobody is available, they'll call me \"within 24-48 hours.\" Low and behold they call me at 7pm while I'm in the shower. I get a generic email saying 'click this link to verify I'm talking to the right person.' and after clicking the page literally brings me to a \"there are no pending verification requests\" page.\n\nI don't know what to do. I've had this account since Gmail was started basically. All of my devices and services run through this account and it's like I'm dealing with idiots. I don't know how to convey it any easier to them.\n\nScreenshot 1 is the first issue - them trying and failing to charge the old card. They don't tell you you're charged every time you click verify. This is what I'm greeted with before I can submit any details.\n\nScreenshot 2 is the link the SUPERVISOR sent me saying I need to verify I'm the person they're trying to talk to.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/hyWHKYo\n\nEdit: I want to also mention, I have full control of the account, but cannot use any payments for literally anything. YouTube premium, Google drive. App store. Etc etc. I just can't change my situation with Google pay.",

The people that could help you would have to be an actual google support service, but there is ZERO support service in google, nothing. They'll go \"we lock your account to protect it from what we think could be a security issue but won't do anything to make sure you'll be able to recover it\" out of nowhere and be totally fine with you never being able to recover it because of how shit their soft is. These rats know that they don't need to pay money for having an actual support center because they know we are in a position where we're gonna use their products anyway.\n\n&gt;  it\u2019s not giving me any options to provide more info\n\nWhat you can actually try is using a different browser. Google wasn't letting me connect to my account using 3(!) different recovery techniques on Firefox. I tried with Edge on the exact same device and it provided me a 4th recovery option, just for using a different browser! And this one actually worked! And I'm STILL not able to use my account with Firefox on the same device!!! They claim that if I use Firefox on my device I have to be a hacker but if I use Edge on the same device it's all fine!!! THIS WHOLE THING IS A FCKING JOKE!!!\n\nEdit: I finally was able to recover it (actually without even having to do the recovery process!!) by clearing the cache on Firefox.\n\nGoogle security is a JOKE from A to Z. Detects a possible security problem on a (device, account, browser) triplet, blocks that triplet but is fine with the device if using a different account or a different browser or resetting that browser.\n\nHopefully you'll find a way to solve the problem too.",

It is doing UX experimentation at an abusive level.\n\nI'm sensitive to changes in websites and startling stuff because of post-concussion syndrome (disability).\n\nI experienced  5 CHANGES IN MY YOUTUBE UX IN ONE DAY:\n\n\\-the thing with the screenshot when hovering over parts of the video line thing if moving forward in video is new, used to just have the title of the section or time stamp\n\n\\-new pls subscribe thing after video is over on right-new pls subscribe thing is now on left\n\n\\-preview of next video is now smaller and rounded\n\n\\-download option moved from main page to dropdown menu\n\nThis is too much and it's sensitizing me to the internet in general. I'm having to leave YouTube and go to TikTok and Spotify for entertainment because I don't want to become so stressed by these YouTube changes that I start getting bothered by things online that I used to be able to handle.\n\nThis is treating your users abusively. Please rein in experimentation to a reasonable level. You need to use good judgment in addition to A/B testing. Don't run around like a headless chicken and say you are data driven just bc you are collecting feedback.\n\nYou still need people with some design sense and UX sense and concern for the user experience, including for disabled users. You can't always capture those things with A/B testing, but they do matter for your brand and company success.",

One day one of my gmail boxes started refreshing like crazy for 10s while I was just trying to scroll down. Google thus told me my laptop is probably infected and signed me out on this laptop (thanks guys). I'm still trying to get to recover that account on that laptop because Google sends me in a loop of \"use your recovery address\", \"no no, change your password with a different device\". Anyways, the part that proves how stupid Google can be is that I can use my other google account **on the exact same laptop that they say is infected** (it's not) without any problem. So what, they think it's infected for one account and not for the other?\n\nDon't expect Google to be smart, really. If your connection problem is solved, just be happy with that and pray for Google not to act stupid again.",

That is certainly a workaround but I cannot do the same in the actual Contacts app. \n\nHopefully someone has had the same experience and found a fix?",

            "comment": "Sorry for the length.\n Earlier this week I got signed out of my account on my YouTube app on my phone (iPhone 11). When I went to sign back in, my main account wasn\u2019t available. So I clicked Add Account, put in the email, and my password wasn\u2019t working. At one point I got the message on YouTube that there was malware on the account so they signed me out for security, and it seems like it signed me out on every device I was using. \nThis is an old google account that I\u2019ve been trying to phase out for a few years, so there are no active phone numbers or emails they can verify the account through. So when I click forgot password, it only gives me obsolete options. Is there any Google support option? \nMy main worry is that there was a lot of stuff on the Google drive I\u2019d wanted to keep, and the second is that I am still paying for YouTube Premium on that account. Any advice is appreciated",

            "comment": "Hello, sorry if this really simple but I just cant seem to do it, if it's even possible.\n\nBasically, I have moved from the UK to Australia for 2 months. On my google calendar I have alot of events with my days planned out, but these events are not dependent on time zone. For example, at 7am every tuesday I could have an event to remind me to exercise in the UK, but in Australia that has been shifted to 2pm due to its different time zone. But in this example I want the calendar to still say 7am in Australia, as obviously that is the time that I would do it on a day to day basis.\n\nIs there a way to make these events stay at the same time regardless of time zone? The only way I know how to make the event become right again is to  go through each event manually and select the same time zone in Australia, but the issue is that I have alot of repeating events in a week so it will take a considerable amount of time to go through each one. Not to mention I will have to do it again when I go back to the UK or if I travel to another time zone. \n\nWould really appreciate any help, cheers",

When I received my new card, I updated my google pay  profile and all seemed well. A few weeks later, I noticed some unusual  activity (payments made to the play store with my credit card that  weren't on my google account) associated with my card, so I reported it  to my bank as fraud and they closed the card and sent me another new one  (this one had a new number).\n\nI've  been trying to get both cards verified. I completed my new card's  verification over two months ago and haven't heard anything from Google  aside from the confirmation that they received my information.\n\nI have tried to verify my old card's information multiple times, however I don't have the card, so I attached an old statement.\n\nThen  today, they told me my account was indefinitely suspended, \"due to  violations of our Terms of Service\". They won't tell me what I did.\n\nI  suspect that it's either something to do with the verification (I just  found out today that while my current address is an address registered  to my account, my old address is the primary one) or...something else?\n\nHas  anyone ever appealed this or had a google pay suspension overturned?

[In this video](https://streamable.com/445yeg) when I type \"f\", it fills in \"facebook\". When I type \"r\", \"rolland garros\". \"w\", \"wetransfer\", \"v\" \"vinted\", \"n\" \"netflix\".\n\nIn my last search I typed \"which\", but it autofilled \"wetransfer\" from typing the \"w\" then I looked at the screen and I saw \"wetransferhich\"... Same with \"videos\" I get \"vintedideos\"\n\nBefore that I typed in \"an\", it auto filled with \"answer the public\". So I started erasing using backspace, it deleted the \"c\", but then instead of deleting the \"i\", it filled \"answer the public\" back in... And it kept doing that for a few seconds as I was holding backspace. After a few seconds it erased all the letters and it didn't fill it back in while typing \"an\".\n\nSometimes it triggers, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it triggers but stops triggering after a while.\n\nIs there a way to disable this? I  might be missing a setting somewhere in my google account or in my browser that I didn't disable.",

She is bawling her eyes out because all our family pictures are saved on there.",

Now I wanted to install it to streamline the process so I dont have to upload files manually on the website whenever I wanna store files. But I wonder, if for some reason I lost access to my google drive on desktop, will the drive on my PC gets removed too? Or will I just lose access to its online functionality?",

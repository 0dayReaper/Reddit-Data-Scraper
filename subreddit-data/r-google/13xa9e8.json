    "postText": "Is there is a way to have people RSVP for an event with a maximum capacity straight from my Google  calendar? The only way I can think of to do this is to use something like Eventbrite, and put the link for registration in the description in the Google Calendar.\n\nI find that Eventbrite is not so great at showing dates of events in this way. It allows me to either pick a range of back to back days, or have recurring dates, or choose multiple single day events. So what happens is that I end up with what looks like is everyday for 1-3 weeks.",

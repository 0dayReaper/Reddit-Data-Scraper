It provides a really easy video chat option.\n\nThe ONLY bad thing I can say about it is that it's group sms functionality has been really lacking.  I know it's slated for a fix eventually, but afaik it's still not working.\n\n--edit Woah, they actually must've just fixed this.  I checked a few months ago and they still hadn't.  So yeah, my only remaining complaint about hangouts has finally been resolved!",

Maybe when Hangouts first dropped this was not the case, but currently, the carriers should not give two shits whether Smartphone users are on SMS or not, and you could even argue that an alternative would be better for them since it would slightly eat away at their customers' data allowances.

They can have subtle reminders in place when users try to access certain exclusive features (like stickers, or enlarging or shrinking text).  Basically, if someone is in an SMS conversation, and they attempt to use one of these features, they can get a notification that says, \"This feature is only available within Allo conversations.  It appears [Contact] is not using Allo.  Would you like to invite them?\"  Then you can text them a link where they can download the app, and then explain why they should use it over sms. ",

You can largely thank iMessage for this as carriers did raise a stink when that first came out [when limited SMS was on the way out, but still around], but Apple told them to shove it. If anything, increasing the likelihood of messaging being done over data would be preferable to carriers now, as anything using data will put you that much closer to your data cap and thus overage charges.\n\nPhone makers on the other hand want you using *their* apps as much as possible, because anything that keeps you in their ecosystem increases the chance of them getting some money out of you for their specific services. Google forcing a specific SMS app as the default on Android will put them in a tizzy.\n\nBesides, even if what you posited was true, Apple has proven time and again they can and will force carriers to do things their way, they hold the power in their relationship with carriers because of their US market dominance. So whether the issue is Android phone makers or US carriers, the result ends up being the same.",

They aren't always looking for bigger and better - it sends messages to people in their circle and that meets their needs. The way Google staggers product releases in the same space ends up meaning that you have to convince everyone you know to leave one product for another so that you can continue to communicate without having to use multiple apps. I think this is why a lot of people use other products that have long-term support.\n\nPersonally, I look at these new technologies like a kid opening presents at Christmas, but I also realize I'm likely a minority of people who do that.",

Verizon hopes people will want the Verizon version of the phone because their apps are what they are used to. The reason the phones don't update as quickly if at all is because the carrier doesn't want to spend the money on the upgrade.\n\nI would eat a sock if Verizon pulled ALL android phones from their market if Google forced both those issues.",

This has nothing to do with carrier bloatware, it's just wondering why Google continues to put out apps that could be combined into a single app like iMessage is.",

                    "comment": "&gt; Also, it learned from integrating SMS into Hangouts that it was a feature desired only by a vocal minority, and only ended up confusing everyday users.\n\nI really do not think that is was a vocal minority wanting these features.  They were features that many assumed would have been baked in from the beginning to allow users of all types to be able to easily transition from whatever else they were using.  By not including them, many people simply said, \"Well, it's neat, but I only have a few contacts willing to use it... And I can chat with them using the services that we're already using, and I have more friends that also use these services.  So why switch?\" \n\nTo top it off, the app was clunky, a bit buggy, slow, and for awhile, pretty ugly since it did not adhere to the Material Design specs, well after they had been published.  So when Google FINALLY started baking these features in, people responded with, \"Cool, I can now text my friends using this app, whether they are using it or not, but it's kind of shitty,\" and so they played with it for bit, and then went back to what they were using before.  Then lo and behold, Google dropped Messenger on us with Lollipop, and everyone's SMS app became AWESOME, and the only real disadvantage it had under Hangouts was that you could not access your messages on you PC, which if you were using your Carrier number for SMS, this was always the case anyways, so when left with a choice of using a clunky, buggy, and kind of ugly app, or a sexy one that performed well, and had all the fancy Material Design goodness, it is no surprise that people went with the latter for their SMS needs. \n\nReally, the only people using SMS/MMS in Hangouts are Voice users such as myself.  I would love the option of using a different app, but right now, the only applications that can send and receive GV messages is the Google Voice app which has a UI that predates Holo, and Hangouts, which has gotten prettier, but still suffers from a lack of features (video messaging anyone?) and still has some design inconsistencies. \n\nUltimately, I agree with the people who suggest that it should all be merged into one or two apps.\n\n**Allo** - It can easily take the place of Messenger if they will simply build it to tap into the SMS Messaging API that has been in Android since KitKat, which Hangouts already does (did?) this.  That would effectively eliminate the need for Messenger.  If Carriers pitch a fit (which they really shouldn't since ALL of them offer unlimited SMS/MMS at the base packages, and they'd rather you use your data anyways), Google has the clout to tell them to get over it.  If OEMs want to have their own messaging app for SMS/MMS, then they still maintain the right to build and ship it with their devices as the default SMS, or they could just let Google take care of it with Allo. \n\nThe only thing Allo would need to adopt from Hangouts to make it obsolete is Google Voice SMS/MMS/Voicemail integration.  They do this, and then build a web app/chrome extension, that will pretty much cover the messaging aspect of Hangouts. \n\n**Duo** - Some argue that these two should not be separate, but I think splitting them is actually a good move on Google's part.  iMessage and Facetime are two separate apps that do two separate things, and so it makes sense to separate them out.  Duo is arguably a better offering than Facetime though since it (a) is platform agnostic (still waiting to see if it will be supported in browser) and (b) does not require an account to use; you simply have to register it using your phone number. \n\nThe only thing that has not been covered is the VOIP/Dialer feature that is available in Hangouts.  This could rolled into Duo, which would officially hammer the final nail into the Hangouts coffin. \n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nAll the pieces are there for Google to get it's Messaging shit together, they just have to start implementing them in a way that makes sense.  Their current plan at keeping things fragmented with applications with about 90% overlap with features is not working.  ",

Even MSN Messenger predates Google Talk (see also Yahoo!'s, Excite, and a few others from the later 90's).\n\nArguably IRC is an IM that predates all these (1988), but a little different to the format we're used to seeing in all those others above. Likewise BBS chat systems and local server/network IMs from the 70's, perhaps also out of scope...\n\nBut there is a much longer history going back before Google or 2005.",

I'd buy that if it wasn't the price of a good PC RIG I can do all I do on this phone but 60x better outside of the basic functions where a phone is the best like you know. Phone calls. The thing any phones does even sub 50$.\n\n1800 dollars is just way way way too expensive for what it is.\n\nWe're happy to keep our pixel 6 for now.",

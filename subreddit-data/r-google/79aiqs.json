They both knew it was an issue and did something to hold everyone over until the warranty was up. Now they just blame each other and want $156 to fix the battery but will only warranty the fix for 3 months. After the 3 months the battery to fail again and you are screwed. Also apparently the \"fix\" on Google Assistant is also broken. Very disappointed that a company like Google doesn't stand by their products. When it comes time to buy a new phone I will show them my displeasure.",

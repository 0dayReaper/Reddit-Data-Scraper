They're famous for it.\n\nI think the difference now is that inconsistency used to come from an engineering culture where engineers really led things by building what they want and what they thought would work. That culture caused a lot of headaches, sure, and I do want them to get better at seeing things through and being more consistent and integrated.\n\nThe flip side though is that I think what you're seeing at Google is MBAs ruling the day. I think there's less and less technical knowledge in the upper ranks and more people making decisions who just don't know anything about the products or the people building them.",

Jack in accounting gets his job done, can spend time with his kids, the company continues to grow (as we saw in the pandemic and currently) it also has the added benefit of cutting costs etc. etc.\n\nThe reason theyre forcing you back into the office is because nothing is ever enough. If you notice most RTO notices focus on greater collaboration, better teamwork etc. etc. what they actually mean is that in the other 4 hours you would've spent with your kids even though you did your job we're hoping that by forcing you together with colleagues you end up doing more work without noticing...whether its during lunch when you're having lunch with a colleague, when you go down for a cigarette break you end up talking about work, you run into someone in the bathroom you end up talking about work.\n\nMaybe you got what was expected of you done in 4 hours, thats great, now continue to stay here being only able to talk about work (because you're probably not going to talk about how shitfaced you were on the weekend with most colleagues) and possibly do even more work so that goal of %100 - even though its already good enough - may end up being %110\n\nI dont think its about babysitting and im pretty sure its not about the costs related to termination fees its google were talking about",

You're not hired to do *x* tasks. You're hired to do *whatever they want* for 40 hours. Now, there is some truth to that, but I don't think there should be.\n\nWe've gotten so accustomed to a 40 hour work week when so many people only actually work 10-15 hours because of automation, hold up from other groups, lack of proper management, etc. I couldn't tell you the last time I 'worked' over 25 hours in a week.\n\nFor many companies, the work week could be cut to 24 or 32 hours and the same amount of work would get done. I think that's actually a good thing. Pay hasn't gone up much over the last 40 years. The least they could do is give me back my free time since I get my job done in half the time. With WFH, that's essentially what I have. I can get my work done and then have Netflix on a screen, or play Diablo IV, or prepare dinner, or go see the wife and kids upstairs for 15 minutes at a time.\n\nIn a nation this prosperous and with companies ballooning in wealth, I think this just makes sense.",

Because in this day and age with how much technology has advanced especially in a white collar environment you're going to struggle to give people 40 hours of work per week, so it seems like they're paying for our time. \n\nThere's only so many reports, presentations, updates, roundtables, meetings etc. etc. etc. a team needs in any given week. Ive been in a managerial position in one of those WoRk HArD PlAY hARd companies and most of those reports/meetings lose impact after the first few either people sit with their cameras off, or just dont bother to read that weekly update youve been sending (along with the 42 other teams that have to as well) for the past 8 months. That leads to loss of productivity if you ask me because teams start to focus on what they need to be writing in those update emails, or slides for that weekly all hands as opposed to focusing on actual meaningful revenue generating work.\n\n&gt; didn\u2019t tell their hiring manager they could do a week\u2019s work in half a week\n\nCircling back to the initial point, is it really on the employee if the expected workload takes less time than expected? Will the company pay double salary if the employee produces double the output that is expected?\n\nBasically lets all cut the charade. There isn't 40 hours of work every single week for 52 weeks straight that needs to be done excluding lets say busy season pretty much all companies have. So let people live a little, companies continue to grow, they cut costs, employee morale increases..whats the issue?",

There's a few reasons, some people are just driven to work when it's time and can get into a flow state -- plus, not having to commute/get-ready saves them a lot of time. There's also the tendency that if you're really good at your job you get all of the junior staff bugging you with questions, derailing your flow state. Mr. Fluffles doesn't ask questions, he just dictates.",

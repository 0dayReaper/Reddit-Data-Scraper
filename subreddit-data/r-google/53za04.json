Incognito, assistant, I personally like the design, though I don't really like how it clashes with material design a little, it's very round.\n\nIf it had SMS capabilities and the ability to use it on a computer, it'd beat out most other messaging apps based on pure features and interface. Unfortunately, those are very important things that it lacks, making it pretty useless for most people.",

And I can give you that maybe voice should be integrated on hangouts (isn't it already?), but I see no reason to not give it also a stand-alone app if someone doesn't want to use hangouts. Then you'll have Hangouts for work stuff, Messenger for old school SMS, Allo for modern day instant messaging, and Duo for videocalls. I don't see the problem there. If you, as much of the people, don't do videocalls, you don't have to install Duo. And if you don't use Hangouts at work, you don't need that either. Seriously, I don't see the problem here.",

Take into account that Google's network is international. My ping to Google and GMail is 4-8 ms. In Romania. So the messages still have to travel from one server to another.\n\n3. Besides the fact that messages go through multiple servers where they are stored and processed, they also have to go to the recipients (this is the only thing like IMs).\n\n4. Emails have tons of headers. If you're using it for IM the headers are dozens of times longer than the message you're sending.\n\nThere's probably more to say, but when you compare IM to Gmail it's clear who wins by orders of magnitude like /u/thagthebarbarian said.",

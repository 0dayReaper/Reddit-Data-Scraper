On the whole Google assistant is much smarter for me to be more productive if I were to use an assistant. I've got a Google home for free with my pixel and if it were any other assistant I wouldn't use it. Mostly I use it as an alarm clock lol but when I do need it for other stuff or when I'm bored it is better... The best thing about Google assistant I find is that it remembers what I'm talking about and it'll actually reply with useful or fun information. Siri mostly gives me search results when I ask for math equations but Google gives me the equation found from the site.\n\nOther than that I like it more because of all the games you can play on it haha! Try asking your assistant to talk to Dustin from stranger things. Just a little bit of fun",

But as others have said, tablet apps are few and far between on android, and the build quality /performance trade offs were pretty apparent. \n\nSamsung has decent build quality, but I don't like their skinned version of android. \n\nI saved up for a macbook so I wouldn't have to deal with windows, but could still *easily* access applications designed for academia etc (trust me, I know Linux is an alternative, and I love it, but when you don't have the time to sort it all out, it's not the ideal option, imo).\n\nBut like Google's flagship tablets have been expensive for what you get. The nexus 9 had build quality issues, the pixel c/slate runs chrome os, so they're out of the question. \n\nThat's what pushed me to an iPad. Costly, but the build quality is apparent, and the app ecosystem (while definitely not perfect) is much more optimized for larger screens, and I have access to better quality apps for my use case.",

I didn't root these devices since fuck dealing with that when my parents are using them all day, but i often have to clean them up for them, and even installing an external SDCard didn't help because apps were moving just a few megabytes of data and cache kept piling up in the internal storage. This is just the storage issues, performance wise they're a mess, with taps not registering from time to time, the stock Samsung browser was slow as hell because it never got updated, Chrome was just too heavy for them when loading desktop websites so i opted for Brave browser since it filters a lot of bloat, not a great user experience for non-tech savvy users imho.",

I'm really into the slimmer even bezels all the way around with squared off edges. The design is also complimented well with the faceID from any orientation and new gesture controls which allows to to unlock and use your ipad from any direction. In terms of specs, it has the highest refresh rate, fastest processor, best stereo speakers, it doesn't lack in any department really. \n\nThe only thing is that size... Its a little bigger than what I'm used to but being able to connect a keyboard (Logitech slim folio pro) put the extra screen to good use for multi tasking media and typing. \n\nIf you can look past its size, I 100% recommend it, since it recently went down 100 and is now selling at $700 for the base model 11\".",

Safari, since it can use content blockers (to filter unwanted ads and gdpr prompts), and because third party browsers like Chrome are stuck using iOS webview with the slower javascript engine, but i got it installed to quickly access my bookmarks or device sync'd tabs. \n2. Stock iOS keyboard, since Gboard on iOS didn't have multilanguage support like it does on Android, but has the Flow gestures, and i had some issues in some apps where Search bars wouldn't trigger with the \"Enter\" button.\n3. Photos app, since it looks nice and its fast, but i do open Google Photos from time to time to backup my Photos.\n\nThe other iOS stock apps are a mix of Ok and Hot Garbage, like the Mail app, it looks fine at first until you find out that you missed 3 emails because it syncs whenever it wants. The Map app got a lot better, i used it for a while before Apple let other Map apps in CarPlay and it was fairly decent for general use, it also consistently recorded my parking location, while Google Maps at times it fails unless you keep the app open till your car stops.",

In my experience, in Android tablet, the experience is so much better because the way Android handling file. And there is SketchUp viewer on Android, this app is life saver because i dont need to bring laptop when I meet with clients.\n\nBut. Nothing can beat surface. Well, because the windows app",

Good luck, Architecture degrees can be brutal.\n\nFair warning there is unsolicited advice ahead. Plan your time well and walk away from working every now and then, you can get stuck down a rabbit hole, it helps to get some perspective. Also try not to get caught up in the little things otherwise you end up not seeing the woods for the trees. Don't forget as well the thought process is as (if not more) important than the finished design, if you can explain how you got to your finalised design you'll do better than just producing a bunch of flashy images. Again best of luck to you.",

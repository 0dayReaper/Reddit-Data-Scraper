It changes how it works based on hand movement, but it does not utilize it like the new zoom\n\n&gt; How Night Sight works\nNight Sight constantly adapts to you and the environment, whether you\u2019re holding Pixel or propping it on a steady surface. Before you press the shutter button, Night Sight measures your natural hand shake, as well as how much motion is in the scene. If Pixel is stable and the scene is still, Night Sight will spend more time capturing light to minimize noise; if Pixel is moving or there\u2019s significant scene motion, Night Sight will use shorter exposures, capturing less light to minimize motion blur.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.blog.google/products/pixel/see-light-night-sight/\n\nAs opposed to \n\n&gt; However, we turn this difficulty on its head, by using the hand-motion to our advantage. When we capture a burst of photos with a handheld camera or phone, there is always some movement present between the frames.\u00a0Optical Image Stabilization\u00a0(OIS) systems compensate for large camera motions - typically 5-20 pixels between successive frames spaced 1/30 second apart - but are unable to completely eliminate faster, lower magnitude, natural hand tremor, which occurs for everyone (even those with \u201csteady hands\u201d). When taking photos using mobile phones with a high resolution sensor, this hand tremor has a magnitude of just a few pixels.\n\nFrom https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html?m=1",

On Pixel 1 and 2 we use\u00a0HDR+'s merging algorithm, modified and re-tuned to strengthen its ability to detect and reject misaligned pieces of frames, even in very noisy scenes. On Pixel 3 we use\u00a0Super Res Zoom, similarly re-tuned, whether you zoom or not. While the latter was developed for super-resolution, it also works to reduce noise, since it averages multiple images together. Super Res Zoom produces better results for some nighttime scenes than HDR+, but it requires the faster processor of the Pixel 3.\n\"\"\"",

When we capture a burst of photos with a handheld camera or phone, there is always some movement present between the frames. ... To take advantage of hand tremor, we first need to align the pictures in a burst together. ... Of course, handshake is unlikely to move the image by exactly single pixels, so we need to interpolate between adjacent pixels in each newly captured frame before injecting the colors into the pixel grid of our base frame. \n\nAnd one of the examples images linked from the Night Sight blog confirms this further:\n\n&gt;by Florian Kainz, Googler. If you use Night Sight during the day, and are willing to hold still after shutter press, you'll get the denoising and resolution improvements of Super Res Zoom, as shown in this landscape shot in Marin County, California.\n\nBasically Super Res Zoom was designed specifically to improve noise and detail by utilizing handshake. It cannot work any other way. The fact that Night Sight produces better images than the normal mode in daylight, because it uses Super Res Zoom rather than HDR+ merge, confirms that it works this way. ",

That doesn't mean you directly get a \"perfect article-worthy picture\" after that though. If there is still a slight blur, a sharpening/high-pass filter can do wonders. If your black sky has a bit of noise, you can do the opposite on that area, use some denoise/blur/low-pass filter.\n\nEven with pictures taken without a phone that has NightShift you can take pretty good night pictures if you're trying your best when you take them and if you're ready to spend a bit of time editing them afterwards.",

Both reviews basically call it a wash, with superior detail in the S6 just because it had higher resolution. At the time that was a big win for Samsung, which had struggled with cameras that fell short of Apple's efforts. \n\nAs I previously stated, you can't chalk this up to monitor calibration - you're viewing it on the same device.\n\nMy parents have an iPhone 6, and my personal experience is that the S6 takes better or similar photos in most cases than the iPhone 6. The 6 Plus has OIS, as does the S6, which gave both devices a serious advantage in low light conditions. So that the regular 6 falls short isn't surprising.\n\nI'd actually forgotten how good the S6 did against the iPhone 6 Plus in low light without flash. It was closer than I was remembering, largely because that's something which has improved drastically since, while daytime performance hasn't gotten notably better. And of course it had a better flash, but I tend to avoid flash shots so it wasn't part of my decision to buy that phone. ",

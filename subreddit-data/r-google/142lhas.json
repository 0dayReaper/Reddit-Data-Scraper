            "comment": "**From reporter Adam Seesel:** \n\nNearly 20 years after Google came to town, there\u2019s no question that economically speaking, The Dalles, Oregon, is better off. The property-tax holiday on its initial data center has expired, and Google is the largest taxpayer in Wasco County, where The Dalles is located, by a factor of seven. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t come, I don\u2019t even know what would have happened,\u201d says Long, the city council member. \n\nIt\u2019s equally clear, however, that the city\u2019s civic life has materially degraded since Google arrived. Google\u2019s insular culture recently led to a series of events that people both in and out of town describe as \u201cweird,\u201d \u201ctroubling,\u201d and \u201cundemocratic.\u201d When a newspaper reporter asked The Dalles for data about Google\u2019s historical water usage, the city fought for more than a year to keep it secret. As for how much water this high-desert town has promised Google in the future, the city continues to refuse to make that information public.",

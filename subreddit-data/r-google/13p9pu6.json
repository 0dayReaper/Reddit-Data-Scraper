    "postText": "I'd like to give a big shout out to Google Play Services for letting my ancient Android tablet with android 4.1.1 come back to life with a Play Store update and framework that redirects me to legacy apps support  that work on my device in the Play Store app. I believe this is something fairly new because the last time a few ago I got an indication that my Android version was no longer supported and had no access to any new apps or support.\n\nI think this is a new approach Google has to sustainability and support of old devices that do still run and should not necessarily be adding to our landfills. Now I can use this old tablet for a multitude of things: a second device (often handy), news, email, web browser, video player on hotspot or Wi-Fi network, a webcam, a baby monitor, abc mouse, camping tablet... thanks Google!",

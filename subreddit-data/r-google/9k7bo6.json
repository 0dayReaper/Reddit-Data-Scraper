That means 64GB per bank, which comes out to 16 x 64GB = 1,024GB of total RAM. This image is actually a few years old, and servers with 1TB of RAM are increasingly more commonplace these days.\"\n\nSource: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/things-do-with-1tb-ram/",

A really common use of this phrase was when people would look at some sort of system monitor on Linux and ask \"Why is all my RAM used all the time?\"\n\nThe answer: Because Linux will use 100% of your \"free\" RAM for a filesystem cache. Because unused RAM is wasted RAM, and it's easy enough to drop this memory and make it available to an application. And some system monitors show buffers and cache as \"free\" or \"available\", and some show it as \"used\", thus the confusion. What people should care about is how much RAM *could* be made immediately available to an application that needs it, not how much memory is *actually* unused.\n\nIt's even more relevant to Android -- on Android, it's vastly more efficient to fill 100% of your RAM with a bunch of apps you only use once/day than to leave it \"free\", as that's a bunch of apps you don't need to boot from scratch every time. If that memory is needed, the OS is reasonably quick about killing off background apps that weren't doing anything important. There's even a way for an app to be notified of memory pressure so it can do things like run garbage collection, because keeping the smallest memory footprint possible can burn way more aggregate CPU (and thus battery) than periodic garbage collection.\n\nIt's true that most OSes (especially traditional desktop/server OSes) don't provide a good way to allow one application to use a bunch of unused memory, and drop it in response to memory pressure, but that's not the application's fault.\n\n(Also, it's not Chrome's fault if you run with a few hundred tabs and then complain about memory usage.)\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt; Virtual memory (A.K.A. swap) is SLOW\n\nVirtual memory is not automatically swapping. Virtual memory covers things like separate address spaces (so apps segfault instead of scribbling over each other's working memory) and memory-mapped files.\n\nSwap is slow when it's *thrashing,* but it's not just inherently slow. If you have particularly cold (infrequently accessed) sections of memory, pushing those to swap even if you're only making room for the filesystem cache can still improve performance. If you have a long-running system with plenty of RAM available, chances are you'll start to see a few megabytes of swap used anyway, even though your working set fits comfortably in RAM.\n\nSure, I tend to disable swap on my systems to avoid the nasty failure mode where I'd rather just OOM-kill something than thrash the swap, but it's not just automatically slower to use swap than not.",

I work for a rather large company myself and the specific product I support is a Linux VM appliance and we do keep swap on by default. I have seen plenty of them using a good amount of swap space and showing no signs of degraded performance. Believe me that our customers would notice a performance hit. Actually, for reference these appliances are mostly stock CentOS with our software slapped on top of it.\n\nOn top of that, I have been personally running Linux as my primary OS at home and have never had a problem with swap usage degrading what I am doing unless I have actually run out of free RAM.\n\nIf you are seeing problems with swap turned on then it sounds like the server is out of RAM. The swap in that case is just preventing the whole server from crashing until you can free up resources. But yes it would run slow in that state.",

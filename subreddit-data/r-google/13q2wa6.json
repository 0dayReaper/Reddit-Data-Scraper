So I don't agree with what the last guy said.\n\nBut you completely changed the topic. Content created by generative AI is completely different than storing and reproducing/showing images that the AI didn't create. That's like comparing drawing a picture of the Eifel tower from memory and printing a picture of the Eifel tower.",

They're being pulled by those websites directly\n\nBut I called out Google here because of what they showed off at Google I/O and the way they're introducing AI into their search engine.\n\nThe company is taking data, information and now images from websites they don't own so they can display them in search results. This is going to crush smaller publishers who are making unique content since they won't get any ad revenue from their content being stolen.\n\nIf allowed to continue the way it has been demonstrated, we're only going to be left with massive publishers who are being paid directly from product makers. And we've seen the way this plays out when YouTube tech reviews. People who get free devices and paid sponsorships are too biased to offer any true criticism for the consumer.\n\nAll while Google gets to display their own ads on these AI generated snippets so they can pocket even more money",

I called you out because the text generated is taken from sources often without citations in all language models amongst all LLM\u2019s. Generative ai does not generative out of thin air , it pieces together from training on the web of all places and manipulates text in various places to sound cogent without being copy paste . AT LEAST google cites the source right there on the image and it links to the source of the image . You would know this if you bothered to look at either of the 3 examples I posted",

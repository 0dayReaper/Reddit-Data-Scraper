                    "comment": "Ok, time to chime in on this. I am a google G-Suite user. My family runs on G-Suite enterprise. I\u2019ve migrated (personally) over 500 companies to G-Suite. A year ago my business partner and I \u201ctested\u201d Office Compatibility mode in Google docs by deleting Microsoft Office from all of our computers. No looking back. \n\nI\u2019m seriously invested in Google because Google makes my life better, and enables me to make my customers lives better and their businesses more successful.  Which is why the fact that Google Meet doesn\u2019t integrate well with Jamboard (and Google Classroom) makes my head simply explode. \n\nI had a call with Google support last week in which I asked them how Google Meet and Jamboard can work together. There is a support article that points out how the two apps work together perfectly if you use a Google Jamboard- the $$$ multi-thousand dollar touch display on wheels that Google sells to corporations and some schools.  \n\nBut if you try to do the same thing: just open a meet in Jamboard.... you can\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ve worked with a lot of product managers who are really good at one thing. They\u2019re single-taskers. Some super smart- PhDs, MIT grads, etc. but one thing I\u2019ve seen is that sometimes they can\u2019t see a business product or unit through the lens of a company vision. Does having a multi-thousand dollar touch screen accessory as a requirement to using Google Meet video conferencing with Jamboard\u2019s shared whiteboard make sense? Of course it doesn\u2019t. We have five Google PixelBook Go notebooks with beautiful, amazing touch screens. None of them can use Meet and Jamboard together and still show your own image to your class. \n\nThis is the fault of one manager who made a mistake. \n\nIt\u2019s our job to call Google on it. We need to tell them that this isn\u2019t consistent with their vision. \n\nGoogle will listen. They just need people calling in. Emailing. Making (constructive) YouTube videos. Etc.\n\nTell Sundar Pichai on Twitter. Be polite. Explain how badly we need integration right now. \n\nIn my support call, I was immediately transferred to a Chrome specialist. I explained what I was trying to do. I sent him the articles I had read, and explained the $$$$ missing link - a big Jamboard on casters. I shared my video so I could show him my PixelBook Go and it\u2019s awesome touchscreen. His answer? Just share your screen and launch Jamboard. I explained that I need my students (customers) to see me, and I need to see them. At first, he didn\u2019t understand. Then I turned my camera off and got quiet. I asked him how it felt. \n\nHe understood. Except he said he could only bring \u201cmy issue\u201d up in his staff meeting. No guarantees he said. \n\nThat call has been in my mind until now. \n\nThe irony of big businesses is that they often have deeper pockets and more resources to innovate. The problem is that they can\u2019t always make great hires, and someone will screen things up- like the Jamboard manager.\n\nLet\u2019s all tell Google. I think they\u2019ll listen. The guy at the top has a heart as big as his head.",

Teams and WebEx are good but you need organisational setup to get them working. Software from smaller organisations isn't robust enough.\n\nAlso, I've never used it on iOS.

Do you have any proof whatsoever that Zoom is \"hitting reddit and Facebook hard\" with paid bot accounts?\n\nI've worked as a sysadmin for a state University for the past 5 years and have had experience with several large video conferencing platforms over that time. Zoom has been by far the easiest for faculty and staff to use and the easiest to administer. \n\nHonestly, what issues are people experiencing that is driving this Zoom hate? I get the privacy concerns but lack of privacy is nearly inherent in video conferencing. Zoom has also promptly addresses these issues which is somewhat rare to see in the software world. \n\nIt seems all of the sudden the entire world is an expert on video conferencing apps while most people have had limited exposure to the entire industry until recently.\n\nEdit: Also, a lot of people seem to think Zoom came out of nowhere but it has been increasingly the most popular video conferencing solution for a few years now.

Everything else (skype/hangouts/meet/duo/messenger/blue jeans) taps out at less than 10.\n* Sensible price plan (ie not everyone on the call needs to pay)\n* The ability to turn off noise cancellation (it's for music)\n* Reasonable admin controls.\n\nAll I've found that can do this is zoom, and we are rapidly running out of seats in the price tier we're on. And going up to 500 is expensive. Anyone got anything else I can try?",

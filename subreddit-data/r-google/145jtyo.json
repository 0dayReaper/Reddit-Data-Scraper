No matter what, Hangouts was still on a decline globally and on the similar path to Skype. Remember Skype? They tried copying Whatsapp for Google Allo and failed. It seems they don't like Facebook Messenger's free storage feature for images like how Allo didn't have a cloud backup initially and the cloud backup consumed Google Drive storage instead of being free a la Google Photos. In the end, FB still won with Whatsapp and Messenger worldwide.",

The deal is to exempt whatsapp backups from your storage limits, not to enable the possibility of backups. Kind of like zero rating some things on your mobile data plan.

In fact, they thrive on this kind of blind worship and the blue bubble cult born out of it. \n\nI still don't understand what motivates people to worship a company to this extent. I have a hard-core Apple fan colleague. He is always looking to convert whoever he can find using non-apple products. One day, he tried to convert me, so I gave him a blind test for iph vs. Pixel photo picking. He picked almost all Pixel photos, believing they were from iph. So, if I take your bias out, you are picking Pixel, and yet you are preaching about your Lord Steve/Tim. Even then, he left after saying that iPhone photos were better. I couldn't wrap my head around how his brain works.",

They are trying to finally break into the consumer instant messaging space and possibly become one of the biggest players. \n\nThe real end goal from a consumer perspective should be true interoperability between services providers like the EU is looking to enforce with the Digital markets act.",

    "postText": "For a while now redeeming a google gift card has only been possible for a few countries that have google support. What about the people living in countries that also want to make use of google gift cards that they received as gifts or that they purchased themselves, but are not able to redeem. This due to them not living in a country that has Google gift cards or because they have a gift card of the same currency but due to not living in the country of purchase they are unable to redeem. This cannot continue on like this. Things need to change. We need to come together and try to make this change possible. So I ask of you please sign this petition and share it with others, so we can be the change.\nhttps://chng.it/ckHMwHKV",

It has water in it, beyond an expected amount, but its a different sort of wetness all together.\n\nI think at some point the philosophy of wetness might spiral into epistemological nonsense if we keep trying to define it. :) I still firmly hold that water is not wet, even if wetness is ambiguous.",

There is a huge difference between users that demand instant effect and wows with each release, and users who are given a set of tools having some learning curve and understanding how to utilize AI tools for different purposes. Both OpenAI and Adobe have understood the need to separate different patterns of usage, others try to give ultimate tool. Even MSFT despite appearing to offer one universal AI integration (copilot) does adjust it to different purposes, so the capabilities will differ between what you do in VS Code, PowerPoint or MS Viva. Google tries omnipotence where multitooling is more approachable and appealing. No wonder end users have no mercy.",

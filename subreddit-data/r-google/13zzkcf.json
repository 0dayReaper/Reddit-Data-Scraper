Learning is good. All for that. Just it is small thinking. \n\nI phrase things all like this because of how extensions work in chrome. Each extension is like a separate instance of the browser. Have only 1 web page open and have day 20 extensions vs 1 extension and you will have a massive difference in system resources being used. Hence it makes more sense to have an extension that can Target all websites instead of one.",

We have seen most of the other temples. What\u2019s a better place to go. Or is it possible to do both and return to hotel by 3ish pm? Would love to know your thoughts.",

            "comment": "I will disagree with most people here\n\nfushimi inari is a very prominent spot, but when all is done and said, it is a lot of walking up stairs, and then, walking them down again. with many people at the base clogging up the walk\n\nnow, its still well worth a visit. HOWEVER\n\nnot with a 6yo\n\nthere is NOTHING to engage them\n\nwith the option to go to nara instead, i think this is a much better choice.\n\nyeah, the train ride takes longer, but we are talking minutes, not hours.\n\nand nara is also not short of walking. at least its out in the open, and not too many steps. and you still can see temple stuff. in fact, try to see the big budda. and of course, the deer. I believe this will be the highlight for a kid. and there are options for shopping, and when its enough, you may be able to take a bus back and not need to walk all the way back. fushimi not so much\n\n5 hours is enough time to see nara. not all of it, but certainly enough for some shopping, a budda and some deer.",

            "comment": "We (30F/26M couple) did Nara yesterday as a day trip from Osaka. Left around noon and returned by 6 (this included the train travel, and a [fantastic lunch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vcKyjH4NWNt1XbVo6?g_st=ic) when we arrived in Nara before heading to the park) and it seemed like the perfect amount of time! Wandered the park, fed lots of adorable bowing deer and checked out the giant Buddha at T\u014ddai-ji. Didn\u2019t feel rushed at all. We did Fushimi Inari a few days before when we were still in Kyoto and went later in the late afternoon/evening. The crowds seemed to have majorly died down, it was raining, and the walk up the mountain was beautiful and eerie. We had the path to ourselves for much of the hike (until we ran into a family of wild boar! Luckily they left us alone and scampered away) we spent about 3 hours there from 4pm to 7pm. Could be an option for you if you have some time later in the afternoon/evening. \n\nTo answer your actual question though, I would recommend Nara for that timespan. I think any kid would be overjoyed with feeding the deer and there\u2019s more to do to fill that time in Nara.",

The gates are a good bit smaller, but they have virtually the same visual of the red tori gate trail without the crowds. I agree with others that Nara makes more sense for a 6 yro, but another alternative Kyoto day trip is Uji - it's a beautiful town that produces a lot of matcha and has the Byodioin temple. It's about 45 minutes from Kyoto but definitely worth a visit and has great desserts &amp; things to do.",

Only an hour away from Kyoto, straight out of the train station at Himeji and in 3 hours you can visit it",

If you love matcha, it's the place to visit and has other temples and gardens (Uji is also known for Tale of Genji).",

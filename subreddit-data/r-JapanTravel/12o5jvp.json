    "postText": "Hi all\n\nTo start off I want to clarify that this is of course entirely opinion based and I don\u2019t want to invalidate the other OPs experience, however it feels wrong of me to not make a counter post after my visit this afternoon while I have dinner. \n\nFirstly - the water smell? It\u2019s chlorine. It\u2019s to ensure you don\u2019t catch any germs or anything else from other visitors. It\u2019s a necessity and the smell goes shortly after you leave - they also provide fresh towels after every wet experience. I\u2019m gonna be real here, it\u2019s a silly complaint, better than hook worms and the rest eh??\n\nSecondly - the flooring is peeling up a bit, however it wasn\u2019t unsafe in any way. It might be a sensory issue for some, however given the nature of the experience one with sensory issues would be best avoiding this altogether. \n\n\nIt was exactly as I expected. It\u2019s a place you don\u2019t need to spend heaps of time at, maybe an hour, two if you\u2019ve got younger people that like to take pics. \n\n\nNow what I really want to stress and what made the trip less enjoyable for me was the other visitors. Nationality does not seem to matter, everyone was bloody rude as shit to the staff, disobeying the extremely simple rules - don\u2019t touch shit and don\u2019t use your flash. People running through the light room pushing the cables around, hurling balls at other visitors. Every single room had rubbish left in it as we left - masks, food wrappers and drink cans. People were bowling past me multiple times for very little reason at all, kids being let loose and people essentially ignoring advice from staff. \n\nThis country is built on respect for their fellow person and it absolutely disgusted me the way some visitors treated them. So as a really sincere ending note please guys do your research on the culture. Treat them how they treat you - respect and courtesy. It\u2019s really not hard. I\u2019m seriously disappointed in how tourists behaved today, please guys do some basic research about how to behave in the country before you visit. We are guests but we should behave appropriately. \n\nAll in all I highly recommend the visit. Please please please let\u2019s give this country and the people that live here the respect that they deserve, it seriously hurt my heart to observe today.",

Anywhere that you (as a tourist) have thought about vacationing, hundreds of thousands of other people have had the same thoughts, too. \n\nAlso, Tokyo is crowded. It was crowded when I lived there years ago. It's crowded now, today. It will always be crowded, at least for the foreseeable future. That's a big culture shock for a lot of people, even if you come from a major city or metro area yourself. \n\nI've lived in or near a couple major touristy spots in the US, and visited Iceland a couple times during some of its tourist booms (a different context/environment, but they're experiencing similar problems with crowds and impolite guests)- the best advice I can suggest is to 1) behave and be respectful yourself, and 2) embrace the chaos. Learn to move around in it and with it- same as if you were in a packed club or venue, really. You'll get used to heavy crowds after a while. \n\nAnd maybe, as a third piece of advice, weigh your options and prioritize accordingly. For example, the TeamLab stuff has absolutely zero appeal to me and I don't understand what the hype is for. I've nixed it from my plans on that alone, never mind the tourist crowds. Likewise with some other big stops- we're going for our honeymoon, so we're balancing our priorities accordingly to allow for some more low-key, less crowded activities and actually suit our interests. But that's just us. If you're interested in that TLP or that kind of thing, maybe plan for a weekday or early morning time (if available). Or allow for extra time for queues, be flexible with other plans, and don't overwhelm your daily plans. Don't try to hit up every single \"must do/must see\" thing and remember that your trip is for you and you alone- if it's not something you'd care to see or do in your home country, it's not likely to be much more enjoyable elsewhere.",

Was so offended by the behavior of a group of Eastern Europeans (maybe Russian?) that my husband and I left a line we were in for 45 min. In a tiny alley in Kyoto we were in line at 7 pm for a small sushi place. There were maybe 5-6 groups ahead so we decided to take our chances and wait. Line was going pretty quick, then the group of 4 Eastern Europeans in front of us gained 3 more seemingly teenage boys last min. I was annoyed by the line cutting but understood they were a large group initially and we still waited. But omg the audacity of this group. Smoking in the street, loud laughing, wearing sweatpants, and talking on such a quiet st, playing Instagram videos, and even ran after a geisha to take her picture (like seriously!?). Idk how the group of 7 thought they were going to get seated at a 15 seat restaurant and they had SO many bags of souvenirs with them too. Decided that our chances of being seated after then dwindled significantly after the line cut and sharing the small space with them would make it unpleasant anyway so left",

There's literal signs (mostly japanese, few english lines), saying please follow the rules, ask for permission before taking photos, don't make others uncomfortable, etc. Then come this one guy, a 30s looking foreigner (40s? he had grey hair), wearing one of those typical thailand tourist shirt. Skips the line, stands beside those currently taking photos and just snaps away. Those lining up near him, gestures him to piss off, and try to block his camera, but he just dances away while taking a few more shots.\n\nAnother thing that really piss me off is when, a group of ppl just stand right outside an entrance/exit and chat away. Zero fks given to all the people trying to move pass them.\n\nCommon courtesy and simple respect, is really not hard. Some people just really don't care and act like they own the place.",

Which itself isn't that different from Japan, just look outside Shinjuku Station on a Friday night, even if the ratios might be different.\n\nI'll accept in that case that there's a societal norm at play though, namely, how westerners react to there not being any bins in the first place.",

Other than the uncomfortable PDA, they were the epitome of inconsiderate. They had a bunch of bags and took up six seats. Had their big lugagges sprawled out in front of them, using it as a footrest. Not sure if it's rude in Japanese culture specifically, but it is in most Asian cultures rude to point your feet at others. Then, one of them went up between people on the other side to take pictures (ALSO of the train and the people inside). It probably bothered the obachan that was reading a book but Japanese are non-confrontational so nothing was said. It wasn't a crowded train and it was a Thomas train but STILL. \n\nPeople taking pictures of a Shinto priestess blessing people when they are not supposed to at Fushimi Inari. When told off, they just laugh it off. \n\nThe rudest shit is, I saw a (white) foreign tourist literally shove his phone into a train officer's face. I didn't know the context but the train officer was rightfully taken aback. He continued putting his screen to the poor guy's face as the train officer slid back into the office. And he did this all without saying a single word. I was like wtf??? \n\nBut foreign tourists aren't the only inconsiderate ones. I had difficulty falling asleep at two hostels because of some loud Japanese groups who continued talking until 1 or 2am. They seemed to be young and drunk. \n\nSorry for ranting but Japan has always been my dream trip, still is but other tourists have also definitely soured my experience a bit. I don't know if it's a post-covid thing or Japan just being over-touristed that you would encounter by probability, more inconsiderate people. Or if the average tourist who goes to Japan, who are perhaps on their first trip in their lives, are more likely to act this way. Not saying anything definitive but it's my general impression.",

One more example: Remember the walking pattern? Before you enter the flower room, you have to go again through the locker area. Problem is, you cross there barefoot when just 25 minutes ago everyone walked in there with shoes and took of the socks to walk to the first part in the locker room before the \u201echlorine bath\u201c. Thus, there is dirt and bacteria on the flooring there, which you involuntary pick up again because one has to pass to go to the flower room. (People with shoes, the next visitor group, were in there and walking while we passed through the locker area). Even if we assume for the moment that the first \u201echlorine bath\u201c would have been enough to clean the feet, once you have to walk through the locker area again to go to the flower room, latest by then sanitation is not sufficiently thorough anymore. One more question - how do you \u201eknow\u201c that the smearing on the floor in the flower room is just all from touched and falling flowers? Have you looked closely and considered the possibility it is not all that flower remains? And irrespective of what it is, the cleaning schedule between people needs to be increased in the flower room - the fact that the floor is smeared points to the necessity.",

The floors seemed clean enough but I was constantly aware of sharing it with a bunch of other sweaty tourists who had been walking around all day.

People running through the light room pushing the cables around, hurling balls at other visitors. Every single room had rubbish left in it as we left - masks, food wrappers and drink cans. People were bowling past me multiple times for very little reason at all, kids being let loose and people essentially ignoring advice from staff.\n\nGood review, though this must be group specific. I didn't experience any of this when I was there in November. People followed rules, were respectful, and aside from instagram photographers blocking things, for the most part people were respectful, no horseplay, and didn't leave any trash around.

Also for some reason, people keep hanging out and chatting at the towel rooms/drying area so some people can't even sit on the benches to do what you're supposed to do in that area.

As someone who has to extra care of my feet so they don't stink... That smell is not chlorine my friend. Also, there was never a room that wasn't a straight up line to get through. We felt like cattle the entire time. The projection room didn't even have any space to sit down, the garden room was super hot and gross, the water room... My wife just straight up ran through that room after what felt like a mask stuck to her toes. I say all of this before even mentioning the other guests...which felt tighter than a Tokyo subway car during rush hour. \n\nWe found it to be so bad that it became entertaining. It sucked so much that it became enjoyable. For anyone seeing this, if you have seen professional LED/Laser/Projection displays else where, I guarantee you they were better.",

But I am not here to argue with what you experienced, I am just saying that indisputably you are smelling chlorine thats all. \n\nBut I agree it was an hour or two of content at best, not a show stopper that a lot make it out to be, something id expect to go to as an excursion if I went to school in japan, rather than a touristy experience.",

I had my camera out too, but it was a normal fujifilm camera where I didn\u2019t have to look at the screen at all and just experience the art installation. We took photos at places where we could easily make room for other people as well, it honestly felt a bit dystopian.

When we were in the museum there was one couple that had their phone ringing loudly for 2 minutes before picking up and talking on speaker phone. Also before entering a group of 15 or so people decided to push into the line as their guide was getting close to the door, despite everyone explaining they don't need to line at all, their guide will purchase a group ticket and they will be called in so to not unnecessarily holding up the line. When called out by a Japanese lady (who only told them they didn't need to line up) one guy who had been pushing my bf away told her she was being rude. Same guy had his phone loud receiving messages the entire time he was in the museum.",

I think what helped was the museum opened at 8:30 and we were in line at 8:15. Sorry to hear you had a bad experience. I remember being annoyed at the museum more than any other tourist place because if there is one place to be respectful, it should be the museum. The other places definitely had rude tourist but it didn\u2019t bother me as much.",

We understand how crowded it will be, this is fine with us, we just want to make sure we time Takayama and Shirakawa-go correctly. I have checked Nouhibus website and it said they are closed from Aug 13-15 that is why we chose 16th to travel to Shirakawa-go. \n\nThen in Osaka, we would like to get feedbacks on which skyscraper to visit either Harukas 300 or Umeda Sky Building?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Is it mostly higher than usual crowds?\n\nEdit to update this comment: my partner and I spontaneously booked a week long trip to Tokyo which caught the end of Golden Week. It was definitely a lot busier, specifically in shops etc, but it wasn\u2019t unbearable. If Obon is anything like this - I\u2019m no longer concerned :)",

I think it helped that I overestimated how crowded it would be, so when I got there I was fine with it and I didn't have much problem. \n\n  \nI did Tokyo ( with day trips to Kamakura and Nikko), Nagoya, Kyoto (day trip to Nara) and Osaka. Kyoto was were I saw the most crowd, it wasn't in all parts. The crowded area for me was Kiyomizudera, Kinkaku-ji and Higashiyama district. Even through I saw the most crowd there, I was still able to move around comfortable without the need to say \"so sorry excuse me\" while moving around. \n\n  \nThe one main thing I wish I did back then was was use the luggage forward service. I actually didn't know it existed until a month ago. Having to go to the train stations with my large suitcase and carry on suitcase during such a high crowd traffic was very stressfully and tiring. \n\n  \nThe weather was very hot and humid, I am from a colder country so I was worried but honestly I was fine. I kept myself hydrated and never had any issues with the heat.",

We are going to Yokohama for a Pok\u00e9mon event, so I expected it to be busy anyway. \n\nOh yes, I\u2019ve been a little apprehensive about luggage, to the point where we are considering going very light and having a backpack each only. It\u2019ll be a nice test for us to see if we can! \n\nI have been worried about the heat, even though I\u2019m in Australia and their summers are similar to ours, I just don\u2019t enjoy the hot weather. It gives me a little hope that you were fine!",

I'm also going to be coming in August and plan on going from Tokyo to Osaka on the 16th, coming back to Tokyo the 21st. Did you book train tickets a month in advance or were you able to reserve them with the JR pass once you picked it up in Japan?",

I never had any problems, I was always able to reserve the seat I wanted. When I was there, on the 16th of August, I left Tokyo for Nagoya around 11am. I know you are going to Osaka then but for my travel, I remembered going around Tokyo station and having no troubles moving around the station with a large suitcase and a smaller suitcase. \n\nHowever for this trip with my sibling we have decided to purchase our tickets with the official website. When I was last there being myself I felt made it \u201ceasier\u201d to get the seats that I want but as there are two of us going this time, we would prefer to reserve our seats one month in advance.",

For Fushimi Inari try to hit it up early to beat crowds and heat. And for the Arashiyama area look into the scenic railway and river cruise. I am hearing more good reviews of Harukas 300 for ease of access, but have not been there myself yet.",

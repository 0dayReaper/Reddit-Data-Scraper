    "postText": "A friend and I have a cruise in November which departs from Yokohama on the 17th of November. We are planning to spend a few extra days in Japan before leaving. We will be landing at Narita and taking transit to Tokyo station, then a Shinkansen to Kyoto. \n\nWe initially planned to purchase a JR pass along with the Suica card. However, based on the low number of JR pass related transit we'd be taking, we're unsure if it would be better to simply purchase a ticket going to Kyoto and then returning to Tokyo as it could save us some $60-$80. Any suggestions on the amount we may want to fill our Suica cards would also be appreciated.\n\nWhen in Tokyo our hotel will also be providing electric bicycles as part of our costs. Something we'd like to know is if these typically come with a helmet and a lock or if we would need to purchase some. Any advice on navigating the areas we've listed for bike transit would be great.\n\nWe have also drafted an alternative itinerary for our time in Tokyo that leaves November 15th totally open. We'd be glad to hear any suggestions on what we might do if we go with this alternate option. We generally would want to see landmarks or cultural spots/buildings.\n\nAs for money, we will be bringing local currency with us as well as Wise cards.\n\n* **We will be staying in a hotel near the heart of Kyoto**\n\n**Kyoto - Arrive the 11th around 10PM - Eat/snack - Sleep**\n\n**November 12th**\n\n* Breakfast then transit to Kiyomizu-dera Temple \n* Optional based on time: Fushimi Inari Shrine \n* Lunch at Kichi Kichi Omurice \n* After lunch transit to Nara Park\n* Transit back to Kyoto for dinner around hotel\n* Leave for Tokyo via Shinkansen on November 13th in the morning\n\n**Tokyo -  November 13th to November 16th**\n\n* **We will then be staying at a hotel in Akihabara**\n\n**November 13th**\n\n* Arrive in Tokyo, drop off luggage, Lunch\n* Bike to Imperial palace\n* Dinner then Bar High Five\n\n**November 14th**\n\n* Breakfast, then bike to Senso-Ji\n* Bike from Senso-ji to Tokyo Skytree then lunch\n* Bike from Tokyo Skytree to Japanese Sword museum \n* Bike back to hotel\n* Transit to dinner at Usukifugu Yamada-ya\n\n**November 15th**\n\n* Breakfast at hotel\n* Transit to Shibuya Crossing\n* Transit from Shibuya Crossing to Ghibli Museum\n* Transit back to hotel then take an early peek into Akihabara\n* Go to dinner nearby\n* EARLY BEDTIME (If going to the Tsukimiji fish market)\n\n**November 16th**\n\n* ~Tentatively~ Tsukiji Outer Market in the morning for breakfast (Arrive 5:00 AM)\n* Then Akihabara the rest of the day\n\n**November 17th**\n\n* Breakfast, then Tokyo Tower\n* Return to hotel, checkout\n* Lunch(?) or board and have lunch on the ship\n\n**ALTERNATE TOKYO ITINERARY**\n\n**Alternate Tokyo -  November 13th to November 17th**\n\n**November 13th**\n\n* Arrive in Tokyo, drop off luggage, Lunch\n* Head to Imperial palace\n* Tea Ceremony\n* Peek into Akihabara\n* Dinner then Bar High Five\n\n**November 14th**\n\nBreakfast, then head to Ghibli Museum Tickets go on sale Oct 9th (Afternoon/Evening) for the month of November\nShibuya Crossing\n\n* Breakfast then transit to Ghibli museum\n\n*Transit from Ghibli museum to Shibuya Crossing\n\n* Eat Lunch, return to hotel\n\n* Take bike to Senso-Ji\n\n* Bike from Senso-ji to Tokyo Skytree / Official site then lunch\n\n* Bike from Tokyo Skytree to Japanese Sword museum \n\n* Bike back to hotel\n\n* Transit to dinner at Usukifugu Yamada-ya \n\n**November 15th**\n\nOpen to suggestions.

    "postText": "Hello! I have been lurking here for months and using all of your awesome advice to help with my family's upcoming bucket list Japan trip (June 7-21). \n\nJune 7-15-Tokyo (I have our itinerary pretty well mapped out for this part of the trip.)  \nJune 15-19-Kyoto (with partial day trip to Nara, and evening trip to Osaka)  \nJune 19-21-Tokyo Disneyland (partial day), Disney Sea, heading back to airport and then home on the 21st. \n\n**I'm having some trouble with the Kyoto part of our trip.** We had initially booked 2 nights in Kyoto and 2 nights in Osaka, but  ended up feeling like that was going to be a lot of hotel hopping. We were spending so much time in Tokyo, we wanted more time in a different kind of environment. So, we nixed staying in Osaka, and we are staying at the Ritz in Kyoto all 4 nights. Woo! But it's really only 3 1/2 days, and with Nara and Osaka, there really isn't that much time in Kyoto. \n\nWe know we want to take a half day trip to Nara to see the deer. And we want to go to Osaka one night to see Dontonbori. I am having temple/shrine overload from all of the guides. \n\n**June 15 (partial day) Maybe Gion at night?**\n\n**June 16-Fushimi Inari (everyone says do early or late)**\n\n**June 17-Half day trip to Nara,** \n\n**June 18-Arashiyama bamboo grove and monkey park, evening in Osaka in Dontonbori**\n\nI had a bunch of temples and shrines on my potential list, also Nishiki Market, Philosopher's Path, Higashiyama district. I have looked at so many guides, I'm overwhelmed. So, I'm asking the hive mind. With a timeline like this, what else would you recommend? Would you keep this order? I think we would most like to experience the atmosphere in Kyoto and not be running around to 15 different places in one day. I also know it's the rainy season, which could make getting around a little more difficult/yucky. I think we'd rather see fewer temples and have a good experience than try to pack so much in, it's not fun. And that's what is giving me trouble. \n\nWe also tend to like quirky things. Thanks so much if you have any suggestions.",

It is a great place to get food, but I don\u2019t think it is worth traveling that far just for that. If you around the Arashiyama area, check out the otagi nenbutsu-ji and tenryu-ji temple.  Gio ji temple and moss garden is also worth visiting.",

It actually seems easy to get from Fushimi Inari to Nara, but depending on how far we walk, we might already be tired before getting on the train. Also, our hotel puts us at close to an hour by train from Arishayama. I hadn't realized that. I don't really want to go to the bamboo grove because I've seen the real pictures of how crowded it is, but my husband wants to go. There is just so much to do and see, and there is no way to do anything close to it. I want some time to kind of bop around and just see what we see. \n\n**June 15-half day**  \nGion at night\n\n**June 16**  \nFushimi Inari  \nHalf day trip to Nara  \nNara Park  \nNakatani Dou-mochi making store  \nOkanomiyaki Parco  \nTodai-ji  \nIsui-en Garden and Neiraku Museum\n\n**June 17**  \nSomehow get over to Arishayama area (like 50 minute train ride)  \nOtagi Nenbutsu Temple  \nGio-Ji  \nArishiyama bamboo grove  \nTenru-ji  \nArishayama Monkey Park\n\n**June 18**  \nStart at Ritz Carlton  \nPontocho Park (cats)  \nNishiki Market  \nYasaka-jinja Shrine  \nKodai-ji Temple  \nKiyomizu  \nKennin-ji Temple  \nDaimaru department store on way back",

            "comment": "honestly, the top 5 \"must see temples\" lists in kyoto all have the same 4.5 temples on them, and that is for good reason. now I will admit you barely can do all 5 in 2 days and even 3 might require a little out of the box thinking, but I really really think it would be a shame to get to kyoto and not experience a few unique experiences.\n\nFirst, your choice of staying in Kyoto and not splitting with Osaka was smart.\n\nI am not sure you need NEED osaka when you have been in tokyo. I get it. Dotonbori. I might suggest adding that at the end if you end up with more time than we think. If you miss that, I dont think the world will end. I might even suggest that nishiki market is a more unique experience. but if you were staying in osaka near dotonbori I would probably recommend going there instead of nishiki. Its all about optimization and minimizing waiting and sitting in trains...\n\nsame goes for nara. I might consider not going there if it cuts in only 2-3 days in kyoto. yes there are deer. and a park. and temples (and yeah kinda one special one with the big budda inside)\n\nso here goes.\n\nKinkakuji - thats a must see. north kyoto. it is a quick visit, but, its a little isolated from most other things. sure there are other things to do there, but none from the top 5 list\n\narashiyama - also a must see, at least for most people. north west kyoto. a sensible area to combine with kinkakuji. arashiyama is huge and one could spend days there. most people will think bamboo grove. and for the live of me i will never know why, monkey park. skip the monkeys, maybe do tenryuji instead, which will lead into the bamboo grove. start with kinkakuji, then arashiyama, so you can stay there the rest of the day.\n\nfushimi inari can be indeed done very early or late, since it has no opening/closing time. but there are stalls and stores and restaurants which will be closed, so bring a snack and plenty of drink. there will be vending machines but you never know. you could do fushimi inari before kinkakuji and arashiyama. you could end that day in gion.\n\nit will be a packed and full day. you will be tired from all the walking. maybe dont do gion, go for an onsen instead. or go to dotonbori\n\nwhat you dont have on your list, you really should not miss higashiyama. that area (leading into gion or, to a lesser extend, along the philosophers path to ginkakuji) is kinda the quintessential kyoto experience. dont miss that. kiyomizudera is a must, and I personally would not miss Kodaiji. further explore the area, then head into gion to explore there at night if you so want to\n\nto cut the philosophers path out of time constraints makes sense. not seeing ginkakuji out of lack of time makes sense.\n\nso with these two packed but doable days, you might find time for nishiki market and nara after all.\n\ngood luck!",

                    "comment": "Thank you very much! Okay. I admit we are animal lovers, so the deer and the monkeys are very appealing. I really wanted to go to Rabbit Island, but that was too far. So, I don't know if I can give up the deer and the monkeys. :) \n\nIt looks like Gion is about a 20 minute walk and Higashiyama is about 35 minutes from our hotel. I thought we could go through Higashiyama on the way to some of the temples? I didn't really put them down on the itinerary because I just wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do there. I know there are lots of little stores, but I didn't want to get too specific in case things were crowded or closed. \n\nAre there any specific places you would suggest going to in Gion and Higashiyama? I have looked at a lot of suggestions and watched a bunch of tiktoks. :) I even considered a tea ceremony or a samurai lesson (mostly because I admit I wanted to dress up) but I don't think we have time, and I don't want to get bogged down with reservations. \n\nWe're going with my teenager, and she will not do an onsen. So none of those on this trip. But you are right that if the stars align and we have some extra energy, we could go to Dontonbori. I was making my itinerary by day, but I've changed that in Kyoto because we don't really need reservations. In Tokyo, some of the things we are doing like the Ghibli Museum (crossing fingers...I have my alarm set) require them. So, I think we can be a little more free to change things around in Kyoto. \n\nThank you very much for the help!",

                            "comment": "konban wa  \ngood evening\n\nI understand about loving animals and therefore wanting deer and monkeys. And with limited time, its always a process of deciding. I can not make the decisions for you.  \nIn nara park you will certainly see some deer and be able to feed them. since you want to go there anyway, and todaiji in nara is pretty impressive, it makes sense...\n\nMaybe I am biased about the monkeys since I can visit monkey parks without going to japan, and after spending 12-15hr in a plane and thousands of dollars, doing something I could be doing back home, I have yet to entertain that thought. But. in all honesty, it must be good, and if you wanna go, I think you could get that done in your arashiyama day, youll just have less time to explore arashiyama then...\n\n\nabout the other logistics and questions, if you can spring for a taxi, that can shave off travel times but will cost money. 20 minutes is just on the cusp of waiting and taking the bus might be faster, but it might not be. 35minutes is pretty much bus will be faster. except, in high traffic times and, you guessed it, high travelers volume, i.e. gion, higashiyama, ...  \nit might still be faster though, walking 35 minutes is a lot, and you will be walking plenty in japan, dont push further than you need. if you guys have blisters (on that note, take good shoes, one that have thoroughly been walked in, and maybe a second pair so the first can dry if wet. also, if you feel blisters, dont hesitate buying desinfection spray and blister plasters. you should be able to find compeed in a combini) you will bless any bus ride even if it takes just as long as walking and costs 230yen per person.  \nthen again, walking instead of driving will have a chance of you finding a special place all for yourself. and those experiences are truly worth it and special.   \njust maybe not, 2+ km\n\nso, all THAT said and questions unasked answered...\n\nhigashiyama is, higashi being east and yama being mountain, the eastern hill/mountain area of kyoto. it has a high density of POIs, so many tourists go there, so many things for tourists are there. as Ive said, kiyomizu dera is there, so is Kodaiji.  \nIts a big area, so dont be too hung up on the name of the area. just look at a map. look for kiyomizu dera. take that as a base.   \nthe road leading there, especially from ho(u)kanji goes up the hill and is littered with shops and stalls. sanneizaka is famous for the view of the old history style view and roads. the whole area is, in essence, what most people think of when thinking \"kyoto\" and \"gion\" old style look.  \nnow, going north, you should easily find Kodaiji, its a gorgeous temple designed by a women. close by is entokuin. both are, not officially, but in my book, absolute first time, must see POIs...  \ngoing north from there, you will soon find yasaka shrine, which is kinda where higashiyama goes into gion (west between the river and yasaka shrine)  \nif you were to head further north/east through the yasaka/Maruyama park, you would end up at the zoo, leading towards nanzen-ji and eikando, and then further north start to get into philosophers way territory, leading towards ginkakuji (silver temple)  \nNanzen-ji and eikando are pretty awesome but without time, lets forget them. same with the philosophers way and ginakuji...\n\ngion, in itself, well, it is a lively area when it gets dark, late. pretty. expensive restaurants. yasaka shrine is nice. the street leading there is the one with all the well known named shops. there is a lot of car and foot traffic. if you spend enough time in gion you can find good spots, and when you are there I would not recommend you skip walking through, and when its late, there is little other stuff you could be missing. so go ahead.  \nalso know, yasaka shrine can be viewed when dark, the lights are pretty. no need to hurry there before 5pm  \nand another thing, if you manage to walk all the way west through gion you are more or less near pontocho/close to nishiki\n\nso take all that information and use it for your perfect day\n\nanother thing. I dont know why your teenager wont want to go into an onsen. she realises its strictly split into genders, i.e. no mixed stuff? \nI will assume so, and I will assume she just does not want to be naked with other women. fine...  \nleave her at the hotel, or leave her to do something on her own. and enjoy the onsen. why do you need to have her with you?  \nthere is really little substitution to relax in a warm bath after a long hard day of walking. There is probably one in walking distance to your hotel, and its just, walk in, pay, enjoy, done. unless you have like massive tatoos you should not run into any issues or bad looks.  anyway, yeah, teenager wont want to join? then go alone. of course if you can. but there is no rule that you have to do everything as a group always...\n\noh and about the tea ceremony and samurai lessons. personally I can not recommend a specific service, so if you have one that interests you and you can pay and find the time for it, just go for it. and if you cant, dont beat yourself up. all the memories can be precious, not just the ones where a service tells you that it is so...",

                                    "comment": "Reddit is being so wonky for me today! I hope this goes through. Thank you for ALL of those details. I really dug in last night and looked at the various shrines and what people liked about various ones, and I identified the ones I thought were the most interesting. Honestly, I'm not sure why people like Kinkaku-ji so much, but I haven't seen it! So, we will try to go. I also put a few other smaller shrines on my list, like the bunny shrine, Okazaki-jinja. It just looked adorable and not far out of the way.\n\nOtagi Nenbutsu-ji seems REALLY cool, as does Gio-ji. I've certainly seen monkeys, but not close up. I feel like I have a better handle now on various areas, and I've made lists with things in those areas, and we will see what we can do without being cranky and tired.\n\nYes! I am currently breaking in shoes right now, and I plan to bring several kinds. I know it might be rainy too, so I am making sure to bring a light raincoat and umbrellas. I've also been collecting more modest clothing--and clothing that will fare well in high humidity. It is pretty humid where I am in the summer too, so that's not so strange.\n\nMy daughter is actually trans. So, that would make a public onsen impossible, and she would never be comfortable--even in a bathing suit. She really doesn't go swimming. We could rent a private onsen, but we are staying at a very nice hotel with what I presume is a very nice pool. I would probably be more interested in them if it wasn't June and if I hadn't been to Canada this past winter and gone to several nordic spas! BLISS!!!!!\n\nShe is actually a big reason I am so excited about Japan. She's been self-studying Japanese for a few years, so it's going to be really cool to see if she can actually converse with anyone. She is doubtful and says she speaks Japanese like a 5 year old. Hey. Better than me!!!! I just know a few phrases I keep forgetting!!! Sumimasen! \n\nI actually thought we might be in Tokyo during Pride, because it's exactly that time in the US. I thought that would be so cool! But apparently Japan does their Pride earlier.",

Gio ji is pretty nice, and that area has a few other \"while you there why not pop in\" temples.  \n\ndo not take an umbrella. you can buy them at every convenientstore for like 500-1000 yen, and you could even be given one when leaving an establishment when it started to rain while you are there.\n\nI understand about your daughter. So she cant go to an onsen. again, you could be going without her then. This is not about me trying to exclude her, this is about me recommending you visit an onsen. it is a great experience, and being with family that wont join you is not a reason not to go yourself... at least, not one where you dont have a choice too...\n\ni hope you will have a great time.

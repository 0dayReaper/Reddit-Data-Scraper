    "postText": "Hi I was wondering if anyone has bought a disability ticket for a teamlabs exhibit. When I emailed them about who can get disability ticket they just said look at the requirements. \n\nWhat exactly do they consider an intellectual disability? I\u2019m autistic and I\u2019m getting mixed information if it is or isn\u2019t an intellectual disability. So I wanted to be sure if I purchase a disability ticket I can actually use it.\n\nEdit: my therapist refuses to let me get a disability certificate (actually she just straight up told me I can\u2019t qualify when I asked her what it was). I\u2019m going to ask the therapist that gave me my evaluation if I can. But I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll affect my chances of getting one",

My advice is to email them back and ask they if they'll accept yours, if you have one).",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nTraveling with a small group of 6 and we have an onsen with meals included booked along the halfway point along the shimanami kaido on ikuchijima in a couple days. The only catch is - it will be raining the day we are supposed to bike there.\n\nUnfortunately for our group it doesn\u2019t seem like biking through the rain will be an option, so we are looking for alternative ways to spend our time before arriving at the onsen before dinner. \n\nWe will be leaving in the morning from Shin-Osaka and I noticed there is an infrequent but direct ferry from Onomichi to Ikuchijima (though open to other routes as well).\n\nCould anyone please recommend some nice indoor activities to do earlier in the day or somewhere interesting to stop along the way where we won\u2019t get stuck in the rain for too long?\n\nEdit: I see there is also a direct ferry to Setoda (area on Ikuchijima where we are staying) from Mihara. Is that area worth visiting?",

There is a covered shopping area, though the more interesting bit of the city is along the steep slopes. Setoda is also nice, we went for a walk around the area after taking the ferry. There is also an art museum there, but I haven't been there, so can't really say if it's good.",

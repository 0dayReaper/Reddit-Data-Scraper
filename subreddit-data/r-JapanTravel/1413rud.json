            "comment": "The plan is totally doable! \n\nHowever since you have 6 days and there is fair bit to see in Kyoto, why not split it 50/50 and stay overnight in Kyoto when you arrive in the area?  Kyoto attractions (Gion, Kiyomizu Dera) to Osaka is 1HR one way - remember, you are not going just from Osaka station to Kyoto station.  You are potentially traveling / walking needlessly and waste 2hr each day.\n\nYour Kyoto plan for day 1 and 2 are fairly similar. Do you have interest to check Kiyomizu Dera, Fushini Inari, Bamboo grove, Ginkakuji, Tenryu-ji, etc? \n\nOsaka is fairly doable in 2 days - the essential being Dotonbori. perhaps for the last day you may want to venture to Nara.\n\nIn terms of not wanting to walk too much - I hear you! My tips is avoid getting lost, know what are your must sees (specific POI/stores) and take frequent breaks.\n\nHave fun!",

I've changed my homebase to two places now, it is easier to plan this way since I don't need to arrange to return early before its dark out.\n\nThank you too for the Kyoto suggestions! However, I would be avoiding those areas as my focus will be to look around the market and Gion as I missed those when I was there the last time.",

On Day 3, do Osaka castle and then Okonomiyaki/Shinsaibashi.\n\nIn Kobe, there's also the Nunobiki herb gardens and cable car, Ikuta Shrine, Meriken Park/Harbourland, but I'd say the gardens are tough to walk. If you are interested in museums at all (they're absent from your itinerary but it could be there), Kobe has a number of sake museums, the Takenaka carpentary tools museum, and the Earthquake memorial.",

                            "comment": "For the gardens, I'd advise taking the cable car all the way to the top and then walking down to the midway station, as it's a steep hill between the two. Also, the site is a little odd in how it phrases the opening hours, but the garden itself (on the hill) closes at 5pm. The top observatory that's open 5-8pm in summer is very small and imo not worth going to on it's own.\n\nYour reasoning for visiting twice does make sense, ultimately Kobe and Osaka are not far apart (and if you take the Hankyu train instead of JR, it's also quite cheap), so it's not the end of the world if you go back and forth twice but it would be better to not have to.",

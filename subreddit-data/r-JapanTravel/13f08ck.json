Especially with, assumedly, 2 of those being big airport days.\n\nTraveling to Kyoto for a single nite and then Osaka for a single nite, just to go back to Tokyo seems like a waste. Especially with what looks like only 7 full days to work with. For that length of trip, I'd really recommend just sticking to the Tokyo area or the Kyoto/Osaka area and taking a couple day trips.\n\nEven if you stick with this very hectic schedule, not sure the JR Pass makes sense for you.",

I\u2019ve been referring to it as a 10 day trip to my family because I counted when we depart at 7am east on the 26th and when we leave on the 4th at 6:30pm. What\u2019s your opinion on just a day trip to Kyoto/Osaka instead? I know we\u2019re limited on time (my brother is an intern and a student so we had to go the week that he gets a break before classes start). Is there anything that I can do so so I can see more than just Tokyo. Maybe other places?",

You won't be able to enjoy what Tokyo had to offered.\n\nSuggested Plan A: Tokyo  \nSuggested Plan B: Tokyo and Kyoto  \nSuggested Plan C: Tokyo and Osaka\n\nIn addition, I dont think you can use the luggage forwarding services since you are overnight stay at Kyoto or Osaka. Luggage forwarding take about 1 day to reach cities that far, by the time you receive your luggage, you need to send it out again or even worse, waiting at the hotel for your luggage to arrive before going to next point of interest.",

If you pay as you go you can catch the faster Nozomi shrinkansen to / from Osaka/Kyoto which you cannot use with a JR Pass.\n\nOsaka and Kyoto are close together.  Consider using one as a base and travel back to the other at night ~20-30 mins rather than changing hotels.\n\nLuggage forwarding could be a problem for you as your plan indicates you need next day delivery, this may or may not happen.  Surely for a one week trip you will not be too loaded up to handle yourself on the shrinkansen.\n\nI would consider sticking to Tokyo this trip. More than enough to see and do in a week and some shorter trips available if want some out of city adventures. Kyoto and Osaka could be saved for another time.",

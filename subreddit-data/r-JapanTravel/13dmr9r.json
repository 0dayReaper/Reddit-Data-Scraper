    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nSorry for my bad English beforehand.\n\n I'll be going on a 15 days trip to Japan. I'm planning to walk the trail from Magome to Tsumago so I need some advice on this leg of the trip.\n\nThe trip will be in early October and the starting point will be Nagoya. i will most likely use JR pass for the train rides and bus for the rest. I plan to have my luggage delivered from Nagoya to Matsumoto so i'll only be carrying an overnight bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome issues/challenge i thought of:\n\n\\- Hardly find any room vacancy for an overnight stay in Tsumago though many people recommend to stay there. (From online booking platforms).\n\n\\- More reasons to walk from Magome to Tsumago instead of Tsumago to Magome.\n\n\\- Planning to continue onwards to Narai then Matsumoto. Won't it be inefficient if I do a daytrip from Nagoya.\n\n\\- Limited bus timings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the options i thought of:\n\n1. Depart Nagoya early in the morning straight to Magome. Drop off our overnight bag at an accommodation in Magome. Walk the trail to Tsumago. Take a bus ride back from Tsumago to Magome in the afternoon. Depart from Magome to Narai the next day. (2 days)\n\n2. Depart Nagoya early in the morning. Stop at Nakatsugawa to drop overnight bag. Proceed to Magome. Walk the trail to Tsumago. Take a bus ride back from Tsumago to Nakatsugawa in the afternoon. Depart from Nakatsugawa to Narai the next day. (2 days)\n\n3. Depart Nagoya early in the morning. Stop at Magome Tourist Office and send overnight bag onwards to Tsumago. Walk the trail to Tsumago. Pick up the bag at Tsumago and take a bus ride from Tsumago to Nagiso in the afternoon. Stay overnight in Nagiso. Depart from Nagiso to Narai the next day. (2 days)\n\n4. Take a day trip from Nagoya. Complete the trail from Magome to Tsumago and return back to Nagoya. Proceed to Narai the next day. (Day trip)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm having a hard time deciding on these options or if there is any better way. Any advice/input is greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers",

            "comment": "The direction depends on your walking preference. From Magome it's a fairly short, but steeper climb to the pass, and then a long downhill towards Tsumago. The other way around you spend almost all of the hike going gradually up, and then lose all the altitude in the last hour. Also, Magome is a higher elevation.",

It's not a \"hike\" hike in the sense that it's a well-made path, you're not going to cross any terrain, but if you're not accustomed to purposeful walking for a sustained period of time, closer to 3 hours would be more realistic.",

I first walked the Nakasendo 15 years ago and decided to walk it again as my wife is spending time with her family back in Tokyo allowing me a few days for a short trip. If you're looking for a place, Tsutamuraya is decent. Only issue is that it's a half hour walk outside of Tsumago.\n\nI notice that Tsumago has significantly less accommodation that what was the case 15 years ago. I spoke with one of the locals who proceed to tell me that of the 30+ Ryokan that were operating back then there's only about 9 now.\n\nIt's a case of the family lineage dying out or the younger generation not wanting to continue the family business. Subsequently the local government has extreme regulations and needs to approve any sale of buildings to new parties. In the end, the number of hoops that a person needs to jump through is too many and sees little interest from new parties. This slow death was made worse during the pandemic with no international visitors. It was easier for the old folk to simply close down the Ryokan. Very sad really as it was a much nicer place 15 years ago. These days there seem to be so many closed stores. It's a shadow of it's former self which is heartbreaking for me to see.",

It's been in the family for generations but as with others I think it might have only one generation left in it. In any case, I informed them that I had to leave early and wouldn't be able to accept breakfast. Upon leaving at 5am I see that they left me a small snack and a bottle of water next to my door. Really lovely people",

But the actual hike was super enjoyable, talked with two older men who were running(?) some sort of rest area about halfway down, they gave us tea and stuff. I could also have spent more time in Tsumago, pretty much just walked through, had lunch and left, but that was more our planning. Wish you luck with finding accommodation",

I arrived around 17, had dinner and slept, then me and my friend woke up pretty early and went out for the hike around 8 am. We arrived in Tsumago in good time for lunch and were probably back in Nakatsugawa around 15, although I don't remember the time exactly.",

I landed on going to Magome, chilling there for the day and staying overnight, next day sending our luggage to Tsumago in the morning and walking the trail to Tsumago, then staying overnight there. This may be a bit slower but it's our sort of rest/break period of our trip between Tokyo and Kyoto. We were lucky enough to find back to back nights available in Magome and Tsumago I suppose. If you keep looking I think you'll find something.",

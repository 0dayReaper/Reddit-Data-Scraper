Have 6 tees but would prefer 10 because I sometimes change tees in the day\n    P. S I brought deodorant but don\u2019t forget that\n    \n    2.\twhen you get to airport, fuck claiming the JR pass. Line was like 40 mins. Buy an IC card from a machine (KIX airport has ICOCA) or better yet have it delivered to your home with JR pass. Claim JR card from your local JR station\n\n3.\tmy thighs were chafing and it hurts :( if you have trouble with this do some preventative care. Talcum powder or something\n4.\tOh and I fucked up not ordering a SIM/pocket wifi online. Handle that shit. It\u2019s a hassle doing it after leaving the airport \n\n\nBut otherwise everything is dope. Had a killer okanomiyaki that I am still reliving",

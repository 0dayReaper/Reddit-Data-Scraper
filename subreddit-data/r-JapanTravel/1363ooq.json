    "postText": "# \ud83d\uddfe Hey there! \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\n\nWe spent three weeks on Japan for vacations (between **24th March** and **14th April -** group of four). We prepared a schedule with the things we wanted to do and incorporated (very good) suggestions from other redditors. You can find the advice request for the previous schedule [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/y8qnor/21_days_japan_trip_first_time_and_looking_for/). Now here is a **detailed** description of each day we spent in Japan *(additional commentaries at the end)*.\n\nI'll leave some photos [in this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xzWZy0ujZnBeGYMsK4swmwBDQS_e2T4l?usp=sharing) for reference. You can also [check out my Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/197575217@N06/).\n\n# \ud83d\uddfc Tokyo\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 1: Narita Airport, Tokyo.**\n\nAfter  about two days of traveling (Chile to Tokyo) we were destroyed. We  grabbed our JR pass, a IC card at the Airport and some food from a  FamilyMart and went straight to the Airbnb to rest.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 2: TeamLabs, Harajuku and Shibuya.**\n\nStraight  to TeamLabs, amazing experience. A must go. Wandered around the city a  little bit. Spent a few hours on Harajuku (very crowded). Had lunch at  McDonalds because every other decent-rated restaurant on Google Maps had  a line of about 45 minutes or more (Even so, it was a fun experience,  the menus in general are very different from what we find in our  country). Went to some malls with Nintendo and Sega stores. We walked  across Shibuya crossing and visited the Hachiko statue.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 3: Day-trip to Kawaguchiko (Replaced by Anime Japan 2023).**\n\nWe  saw a rain forecast for the day so we skipped Kawaguchiko and left it  for a later date (when we planned we left an \"empty\" day if this  happened). Instead, we went to Anime Japan 2023 event held at Tokyo Big  Sight. It was a massive event center and the event itself was very nice.  Lots of things to do, very nice cosplayers and free gifts (posters,  bags and stuff like that). \n\nAfter we wanderer around the area which was  full of cherry blossoms and went to lunch. We had tonkatsu at a random  store. It was pretty nice. The place didn't have an English menu, but  the staff was very nice and helped us a lot. Also, all the dishes were  displayed on the front of the store (it was usual on many stores and  what you got was almost exactly what you saw at the entrance). After we  wanderer around the city until it got very late.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 4: Inokashira Park, Cat cafe, Suga Shrine, Shinjuku Cross Vision, Kabuchiko, Omoide Yokocho.**\n\nWe  started the day at Inokarshira park. It was amazing, full of cherry  blossoms, some people doing picnics and a lake where you can rent boats.  It was probably one of the best parks we visited and it was very  fun/beautiful. After that, we went to a nearby cat cafe (Calico). It was  very chill and had a calm atmosphere, but cats were way too used to  people and not very playful, yet I would go again. \n\nLater we went to the  Suga shrine, which has the iconic stairs from Kimi no na wa (Your name).  There was few people so we lined up for the picture and left for  Shinjuku. We stayed a little bit at the Cross Vision screen and walked  around Kabuchiko. We ended the night with some food and drinks at a  random bar at Omoide Yokocho.\n\nFor this day we also had planned to  wander in the Yoyogi park and see the Mei-ji shrine, but we spent too  much time on other places and decided to skip that as it would take a  few hours to do.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 5: Senso-ji Temple, Art Aquarium, Tokyo Tower and Rainbow bridge.**\n\nAt  first we planned to rent some kimonos to wander that day, but  everything was fully booked, so if you really want to do it, book many  days in advance. We started with a walk at the Senso-ji temple. It was  as crowded as it gets, we grabbed lunch right after at a nearby market  (Ramen for about 1500 yen, not bad, not good, and we had to wait for 30  minutes in line). After that, we went to the art aquarium, which was  amazing. We ended up staying for a couple of hours. \n\nThen we went to the  Tokyo tower around sunset. We did the two decks of the tower, which I  really recommend. It was beautiful seeing the city going from day to  night. After that, we walked a little bit around the tower and headed to  Tokyo bay to watch the Rainbow bridge (which was actually only white  that day). We spent most of the night walking around the bay in the sand  and headed back on the last train.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 6: Nezu Shrine, Akihabara, Mandarake, GiGo, Yodobashi Akiba.**\n\nThe  day started at the Nezu shrine. It wasn't crowded at all. It is a small  but beautiful shrine. We then spent the rest of the day on Akihabara,  grabbed some cheap used (almost mint state) mangas from Mandarke. We  also spent a few hours playing games at GiGo. After that, we went to  Yodobashi to hunt for tech. We had planned to go to Ueno park but it  started to rain badly so we decided to go back home.\n\n# \ud83c\udfef Kyoto\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 7: Shinkansen (Tokyo - Kyoto), Hanami, Kamo river.**\n\nWe  got up early to take the Shinkansen to Kyoto but we missed it. We were  unable to make another booking through the web page and we didn't want  to test our luck on the unreserved cars, so we headed to the JR office  in Tokyo station and asked a girl from the JR staff to re-book us on the  next available Shinkansen. We just had to wait about 40 minutes and we  were on our way. We all grabbed bentos from the station, the heated  rice/beef bento was particularly good (as we are not used to having cold  lunch). \n\nThe trip was about 2 and a half hours and was very interesting,  being our first time on the Shinkansen. We were worried about where to  store our suitcases during the ride, but there was enough space on the  front of the seat or the top shelf. Then we headed to our Airbnb, which  was in a very nice place and the whole way was surrounded by sakura  trees. We left our stuff and went out for a walk. We walked along some  rivers and the Okazaki canal while watching the illuminated sakuras. We  grabbed gyozas at a Gyoza no Ohsho (cheap and tasty), some drinks at  7-eleven and headed to the skirts of the Kame river (as many other  people were doing).\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 8: Fushimi Inari-taisha, Keitan Sushi, Kiyomizu-temple, Yasaka Pagoda**\n\nTo  begin the day, we went directly to Fushimi Inari-taisha. We did the  whole trail up to the very top. It was not that long and it was very  beautiful. We stopped at the stores along the way and tried multiple ice  creams and sweets of macha flavour. \n\nAfter the hike, we went to a  conveyor-belt sushi restaurant nearby. The food wasn't amazing but the experience  itself was pretty fun, we all loved it. In the afternoon, we headed to  Kiyomizu temple. We spent a few hours there as it was pretty chill but  VERY crowded. We watched the sun settle on Kyoto's skyline and stayed a  little longer on the now illuminated temple. This and Fushimi  Inari-taisha were probably the two best templates we've been at and we  would gladly go again. We finished the day by walking throughout Kyoto  at night and going to Yasaka pagoda (which is a common landmark of the  city).\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 9: Nagoya day-trip (Castle, Osu shopping district, Nabana no Sato)**\n\nWe  took the train (using JR pass most of the time) to Nagoya. Once we  arrived, we went directly to the castle. It wasn't too crowded and it  was nice to see. You are able to walk through a replica of the interior,  which was nice. After seeing the castle, we walked through the Osu  shopping district. There are a lot of interesting stores and places to  grab food. We ended up buying some tapioca milk tea (awful) and some  burgers at Lotteria (awful as well). \n\nAfter that, we walked a little  around the city and then headed to Nabana no Sato which is an  illuminated garden. The place was AMAZING, it easily takes two or three  hours to do it and you can also hop on a UFO to get a high overview of  the garden. Sadly, we were on a rush to get back on the last train to  Kyoto so we could only spent about an hour. I'm hoping to go again and  take my time there. Also, we wanted to go to the museum and planetarium  on the afternoon but the schedule was too tight so we dropped it.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 10: Kinkaku-ji and Kyoto Castle**\n\nAt  morning we headed directly to Kinkaku-ji, we made it there around 11 am  and it wasn't too crowded (at this point we were already used to seeing  a lot of people everywhere). Since you can't get close to the structure  itself, it doesn't matter if there is a lot of people or no one at all.  The place is okay, I wouldn't go again. We then had lunch at a store  nearby. Some of my friends got soba and udon noodles. They said it was  pretty good. Me and another friend got Oyakodon, which we both agreed  was pretty awful (place was rated 4.7 on Google Maps with lots of  reviews). \n\nAt this point we knew we were not fans of local cuisine. After  that, we walked around the city a little bit. We ended up walking along  a river near Kyoto Castle, walk was nice. We then went to an event  called Naked Flowers that was held at night at Kyoto Castle. The castle  was pretty, the event was nothing special, just some lights on the trees  and projections on the walls of the castle. To end the day we went to  McDonalds and got a taste of the sakura specials of the season. My gf  said it was okay, but she didn't seem too confident.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 11: Arashiyama bamboo forest, Romantic train, Monkey park, Kimono forest.**\n\nRight  to Arashiyama bamboo forest, we got there around noon. The place was as  packed as it could get and to me (and most of my group) it was nothing  special. We spent about two hours close to it (the forest itself is  small, only about a 10-min walk but there are other relevant areas  nearby). After that, we tried to reserve tickets for the romantic train  and the return boat rides. The tickets for the train were sold out, but  the staff told us to reserve tickets in the return direction (which is  the same) and go to the other station by normal train. The boat rides  were out of order. \n\nWe had some spare time before taking the train, so we  headed to a nearby curry restaurant and had probably one of the best  food I had in Japan. The plate was simple; half curry, half rice and a  big pork cutlet. We then took the train to the end station of the  romantic train. We arrived early, so we walked around some rice  plantations nearby. We took the romantic train on it's return trip. The  ride was fun, but again, nothing special. We headed to the monkey park  but we arrived too late and it was already closed (I think it closed  around 4 pm). We then took our time and walked that part of the city to  finally end up in the kimono forest. The small station filled with  lights and kimono patterns was nothing but magical at dusk at night. We  spent a lot of time there taking pictures and admiring the place.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 12: Tetsugaku no Michi, Kimono purchase, Kyoto garden, Nishiki Market, Karaoke.**\n\nThe  day started at the philosopher's path. A nice little river in a  residential area of Kyoto that was surrounded by cherry blossom trees.  It was pretty nice, not many people and it was very scenic as you could  feel the traditional vibe of Kyoto. We took many pictures and walked  across it. \n\nClose to the end there was a small kimono and sourvenirs  store. We went in just to take a look and an old lady greeted us. She  barely spoke any English but we were able to communicate between  gestures, pointing stuff and Google translator. The place was nice, the  lady had the walls filled with photos of people that bought kimonos and  stuff from her. In the end, me and my gf both left with a Yukata. Prices  were okay, not as cheap as you could get 2nd hand in Tokyo and not as  expensive at some traditional stores in Kyoto, yet there were not many  options regarding color and sizes.\n\nAfter that, we went with our new  Yukatas to the Kyoto garden. It was pretty nice, the entrance was very  cheap, the place had a lot of nice plants and flowers, and it was pretty  big. We walked around for about two hours, we even went into a dome of  special plants which was pretty nice. There were different environments;  humid, desert, tropical, and so on. After the garden, we tried to go to  the Nishiki Market to grab some food, but it was already late so not  many stores were open. \n\nWe ended up grabbing some food at a local  restaurant, near the Nishiki Market. The food was decent, mostly Gyozas.  I asked for \"mashed potatoes with bacon\" and it ended up being  something like an ice cream. We were all like WTF?. To end the day, a  friend that has been living in Kyoto for over 4 years took us to Jankara  Karaoke. It was PRETTY fun. I highly recommend it. They even have  English options and translations for many songs.\n\n# \ud83c\udf07 Osaka\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 13: Shinkansen (Kyoto - Osaka), Kaiyukan Aquarium, Ferris wheel, Dotonbori.**\n\nBefore  noon, we took a Shinkansen from Kyoto to Osaka, just about 15 minutes  away. The host of the Airbnb picked us up at the station and drove us to  the house. We went to grab some groceries from a nearby store and then  headed for the Kaiyukan aquarium. We had an entrance ticket for 6 PM.  Probably one of the nicest aquariums I've seen. The entrance was a  panoramic tube fish tank, with many small fishes. We even got to see one  big fish destroying a smaller one. The whole aquarium was about a 1 KM  path they had layout for you. With many different species and some  themed tanks per ocean or geographic area. The main attraction was a  massive fish tank of about 5 floors where you start from the top and  walk you way down around it. It had a lot of different species and some  massive ones (I think they had a whale shark). It was all nice until  closing hour was close and some girl from the staff started to tell us  to move forward, so make your reservation with that in mind. \n\nAfter the  aquarium, we got a ride on the ferris wheel which is right outside it.  Ride was very nice, almost no people on the line at that time (it was a  little bit rainy). We got on a transparent car and spent about 20  minutes on the wheel with a nice view of the bay of Osaka. \n\nTo end the  day, a friend that lived over there took us on a tour through Dotonbori.  We tried all the common local snacks (takoyaki, the 10 yen coin thing  and stuff like that). Regarding the famous food, the consensus was that  some of it was okay and some was awful. We were completely lied by all  those instagram reels. We then took the traditional pictures and  wandered around a little bit more. Finally, we ended up at Izakaya  having some drinks and some chicken skewers.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 14: Universal Studios Japan**\n\nWe got up early  (for us) and headed right to USJ. Place was crowded but we didn't have  to make any line for the entrance at least. We got into about 7 rides,  including: Spiderman, Jurassic park, Hippogriff, Flying Dinosaur, Harry  Potter adventure. All rides were pretty decent but the wait queues were  TOO long. We couldn't get on the Super Mario world attractions as it  required an express pass (with access to any of the rides over there). \n\n**I  highly recommend paying extra for the express pass, even if it cost  more than the entrance itself**, it saves A LOT of time and also allows  you to not miss on the newest attractions. (If you're buying it, do it  in advance, hopefully as soon as the tickets are available because they  are gone in a blink of an eye). We also got to watch the Waterworld  show, which was next level. Be sure not to miss it.After the park we  headed to the nearby shopping mall and had some Italian food at  Saizeriya (an extremely cheap Italian fusion restaurant).\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 15: Kobe, Umeda Sky Building, Karaoke II**\n\nWe  headed right to Kobe to have lunch. It was a short trip. We took our  time to walk a little bit. We went to a Kobe restaurant and finally  grabbed ourselves a bit of Kobe beef. It was one of the best meals we  had at Japan TBH. After that, we went back to Osaka directly to the  Umeda Sky Building. It was a very nice panoramic view of the city, and a  good experience/view overall. No prior reservation was needed, however  we found the tickets were cheap if bought online. \n\nTo end the day, we  decided to go to karaoke again, as we had a lot of fun the first time.  We settled for a nearby Karaoke of the same brand we went the first time  (Jankara). We ended up staying way more than expected and had to take a  taxi back to the Airbnb (Some people tells you to better spend the  night at the karaoke, but we had plans for each day, so resting well was  a priority). The taxi wasn't that expensive (we divided the bill by 4)  and the taxi drivers were super nice, trying to understand us and find  our destination.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 16: Nara day-trip (Nara park, Todai-ji temple, Katsuga-taisha shrine)**\n\nWe  took a train from Osaka to Nara. It was a short ride. We arrived to  Nara and took a bus to Nara Park (it was a walking distance, but we  wanted to save energy). Once we arrived, the park was filled with deer.  It was really lovely. Most of them were very friendly (if you had  crackers). You are able to buy crackers nearby to feed the deer and they  bow if you bow with them while feeding them. I would say, just beware  of children as the deer sometimes \"attack\" you trying to steal the food  (they are wild animals after all). My girlfriend ended up being chased  for about one minute by 5 deer. She had to run until the deer gave up.  \n\nAfter that, we went to the nearby temple where they had the Buddha  statues. It was pretty nice as the statues were massive. We got a  bundled ticket with the museum, but the museum was not worth (a video, a  few pieces and no photos allowed). After that, we went to have food to  an Italian restaurant. It was pretty good. We then headed back near the  park and went to Katsuga-taisha temple. It was a pretty walk (about 20  minutes on a path surrounded by trees, deer and lanterns). We ended up  the day watching the sunset on the grass in Nara park. Back to the city,  we walked around a little bit on Dotonbori for our last day in Osaka.\n\n# \ud83c\udf03 Hiroshima\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 17: Shinkansen (Osaka - Hiroshima), Bomb dome, Peace monument.**\n\nWe had a train to Hiroshima at 1 PM, so we decided to grab lunch. We went to a pretty famous place (it had a Michelin star and that stuff) and had some Okonomiyaki. It was pretty nice and they prepared it on your table. I don't have the name but it is at a very famous street. We then took the Shinkansen to Hiroshima. It was close to an hour and a half. I love that traveling on shinkansen is so fast and easy (probably better than plane TBH). \n\nWe stayed at an hotel this time (though it was published on Airbnb). We left our stuff and headed directly to the peace monument and the bomb dome. We had to take the little trains that go on the street. It's pretty interesting. Once at the dome, it was magnificent. All the area around the dome, the peace monument and the museum is A M A Z I N G. It has a special vibe and it's so well taken care of. We spent most of the remaining day near the bomb dome, then we headed to have some burgers at \"Rider\", which was nearby, and they were pretty good. Finally, we headed back to our hotel to rest and wake up early the next day.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 18: Miyajima day-trip (JR Ferry, Itsukushima shrine, Ropeway), Sunrise-seto sleeper train.**\n\nSince we were only staying one night at the hotel, we grabbed our bags, headed to the JR station and stored our luggage in coin lockers (if you want to do it, be sure to arrive early, as it gets crowded and the big lockers get occupied very fast). We then headed to take the JR ferry that takes you to Miyajima island. It's a very short ride (about 15 minutes) but it is very scenic and fun. \n\nOnce we reached Miyajima, we walked around the coast until we reached Itsukushima shrine (the torii gate on the water thing). Since it was around 1 pm, there was high tide and the torii was in the middle of the water. It was a very nice view. After that, we wandered around and grabbed some food. We decided to go to the ropeway and it was very nice. It takes you on a 15 minute trip to the top of a mountain where you can see most of the island. A very nice view. Then we headed back and there was already low tide, so we had the chance to walk up to the Itsukishima torii gate and grab some nice pictures.\n\nWe then headed back to the JR station and grabbed the Shinkansen to Okayama. On Okayama, we took the Sunrise-seto sleeper train. We grabbed the seats that were free with the JR pass and they were good enough to be honest. The ride was pretty nice, we slept all our way back to Tokyo. In the morning, we opened our windows and we were still on the way. We had time to eat breakfast and take a shower on the train. I highly recommend experiencing it. It isn't as comfy as an hotel, but is pretty nice.\n\n# \ud83d\uddfc Tokyo\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 19: Kawaguchiko day-trip (Mt. Fuji)**\n\nWe arrived to Tokyo  after a nice ride on the Sunrise-seto. Check-in at Airbnb was pretty  late, so we stored our things yet again in coin lockers, but in Tokyo  station it was really easy to find available ones (especially on the  B1). We then took a train to Kawaguchiko. We realized there was an  \"express limited\" JR train that went all the way to Kawaguchiko, but it  required a mixed online-station reservation, since the JR pass only  covered part of the ride and also tickets on the same day were already  sold out. So we had to take the other local trains. It was slower and we  didn't have reserved seats, but we reached it in the end. As soon as we  arrived, we booked tickets for the return trip on the express train, as  it had some seats available.\n\nAt Kawaguchiko, we tried to grab  some bikes to go around the lake, but they were all sold out already. We  ended up walking. It wasn't much, but the bikes would've been better.  As soon as we reached Kawaguchiko and during the train ride, Mt. Fuji  was visible and I have to say that it is massive. We went to walk around  the lake and the views of Mt. Fuji were amazing. There were normal boat  rides at the lake, but we ended up choosing a speed boat. It took us on  a 15 min fast-speed trip around the lake, stopping at some spots to  take pictures of the lake and the mountain. I would say it was better  than the other boat rides as it was a more private experience, more  thrilling and not that much more expensive. \n\nAfter the boat, we grabbed  some snacks nearby and took the ropeway steps away from the boats. The  view at the top of the ropeway was pretty cool with a free view of the  mountain and the places nearby. Then we wandered around the stores  nearby and started to walk back to the station. We left after sunset and  the sunset scene on the lake was amazing.\n\nBack in Tokyo, we grabbed our stuff and headed to the Airbnb.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 20: Disneyland**\n\nThere  were Disneyland and Disneysea to choose from, but no one of us had been  at Disney before, so we decided on the former. We headed early. The  place was beautiful. As soon as we arrived, we grabbed a fast pass for  the Beautify and the beast ride, which was the only one with a long  queue (90+ minutes). All other queues were pretty much around 15 mins or  no queues at all, which was a huge difference from USJ. \n\nIn Disneyland  the food was pretty bad, but we only grabbed food from the 2000 yen  range restaurants. The parades were amazing, a lot of memorable  characters that brought so many memories. The rides for the most part  were family oriented. In that regard, rides at USJ were a lot more fun  in general (for those who like thrilling experiences). \n\nFrom Disney I  would highlight Space mountain, Splash mountain and Big Thunder  mountain. All the others were more kid-family oriented. Splash Mountain  especially, if you're traveling with a group, is a lot of fun to see the  picture of all of the group when the boat is falling. You can also buy a  physical copy. At the night, they illuminated the main castle and did  the fireworks stuff, pretty good as well. \n\nOverall, I have to say that  Disney is not nearly as enjoyable as USJ, so if you have to choose, I  would very much prefer USJ over Disneyland. We hope we get to see  Disneysea on our next trip.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 21: Shibuya-sky, Starbucks reserve, Shopping, Maid cafe, Sky tree.**\n\nThis  was our last full day at Japan, so we wanted to make the most of it. We  kicked the day enjoying the morning on the Shibuya sky rooftop. It was  pretty nice. We would've like to go at sunset, but it was all booked.  Anyways, we enjoyed our time up there, it was a nice view of the city  and out first time seeing it in daylight. After that, we headed to the  Starbucks reserve, a 4-story Starbucks store. It was pretty cool, they  had some unique sourvenirs to buy over there, a good selection of tea,  coffee and desserts. I highly recommend going there as you also get to  watch the process of preparation of the coffee grain over the 4 floors,  starting from the roasting up to the packaging in the last floor.\n\nIn  the afternoon, we went shopping, mostly in Akihabara, and made the time  to enter a Maid cafe. There was a lot to choose from but I found some  very bad comments about the top rated ones (on Google maps some people  said that they were mostly forced to provide a good rating and that  there were many traps to grab cash). I ended up finding a cafe that had  decent reviews and zero negative ones, so we headed to that. It was a  cool experience. We went there when it was mostly empty, so we ended up  chatting with the staff all the time. There were also two other  customers who were pretty friendly too, and we ended all having a group  chat. The girls were pretty nice, almost all of them had enough English  skills to have a good chat. The food was average, but it was expected.  As mentioned on the Google reviews, they explained everything and there  was no hidden cost at all. Me and my gf really enjoyed the time there.\n\nTo  end the day, we headed to the Sky tree at night. It was a nice  panoramic view of the city, and the highest you can get on a rooftop.  However, it was very similar to the Tokyo Tower experience and IMO, the  tower was way better in terms of \"the experience\" itself. If you are  short on budget, I would say Tokyo Tower is better than Sky Tree and  Shibuya Sky. Lastly, we headed back to the Airbnb and started packing  our things to return. We decided to go shopping at 4 AM since we had  forgotten a couple of sourvenirs and headed to a nearby mall that was  24/7.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Day 22: Back to Narita airport.**\n\nOur JR passes were  already done for, so we decided to skip the NEX train (which was  expensive) and took one of the other train lines that went to the  Airport. I was not as nice as the NEX, but it was a lot cheaper and  about the same time.We spent the rest of the day at the airport  thinking it could be crowded like when we arrived, but it was mostly  empty, so no queues or stuff like that. Finally, we made it to our gate  and started our 2-day trip back home.\n\n# \ud83d\udcac Additional commentaries\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 **Planning**\n\n* For a lot of days, we had more activies  planned but decided to skip the ones we didn't like at the moment or  that would take too long. We had some **must-do activities lined out from the beginning** so that helped the decisions at the moment.\n* For the planning, we did a slide presentation for each day. Minted it with the group and reddit which helped a lot. We also used a custom google map for marking landmarks and group them together to plan each day.\n* In  general, the **crowded places we tried to leave for weekdays** (Tuesday -  Thursday). You would also want to consider holidays and avoid those  days.\n* We tried to align the trip with the cherry blossom season, but  it was a little bit earlier this year. Even so, we got to see many  places filled with cherry blossoms.\n* In the end, we found that  **planning about 3 things per day was a pretty good option**, so you had  time left to wander and discover things along the way.\n* For  panoramic views or places like Mt. Fuji, **look at the forecast and try to  avoid cloudy days**. Clear skies after rainy days are probably the best  option.\n\n**\ud83c\udf63 Food**\n\n* We are not used to salty-sweet combinations of foods, and there were a lot of it. In my group, half loved the food  in most places and the other half not so much.\n* We all agreed that fried  food was usually pretty good, but other stuff was mostly personal  preference.\n* We also agreed that **instagram lied to us**, as all the reels showing very tasty street food were a lie. The food was usually okay or kinda bad. I would say keep your expectations low and you'll have a  better time.\n* **A lot of good places will have a line at peak hours. Be ready to wait.**\n* For food we would highlight the sushi, some combini products like the egg  salad and the tuna-mayo onigiri. The kobe beef and other fried stuff  from izakayas.\n* For all the places we visited, it was either  instagram recommended, a local friend recommendation or a well rated  place on Google maps. If you're using Google maps, be sure to check the  menu section for English menus or comments saying that the place is  English-friendly. It isn't needed as people will try to help you, but it  is always better to be sure what you're ordering.\n\n*Expenses on food were about 5000 Yen per person daily. (Almost no fancy food, expect on some recommended places like Kobe)*\n\n**\ud83d\ude85 Transportation**\n\n* We got the **21-day JR pass**, which  was a great deal. We didn't bother about choosing routes optimized for  JR pass, but you can do that if you want to save some extra bucks. We  always took the shortest route available on Google maps.\n* Google maps in  general was enough to go anywhere. Not a single time it gave us an  incorrect direction, yet sometimes you'll need to use your brain as  instructions (especially on big stations) can not be that clear for  everyone.\n* Besides the JR pass for the train, we used a lot of  subway and taxi a couple times. It was not that expensive, but if you're  willing to walk a little extra, you can avoid that and rely almost 100%  on the trains with the JR pass.\n* **Also, for the JR pass. There is  an official page**. It is usually more expensive there than on 3rd  parties, but they allow you to reserve online. **That's how we were able  to grab a Sunrise-seto seat.** (Booked 1 month in advance, tickets gone in  about an hour).\n* For country-side places, it could be a good option to **rent a car**, as transportation is not as good as it is in big cities.\n\n*Expenses on transportation, besides the JR pass were about 1000 Yen daily per person (for routes not covered by JR pass).*\n\n*With  the* ***upcoming changes in the price of the JR pass****, I would suggest  calculating if it is worth to you. With the new prices, maybe it would  have been better for us to just pay directly.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Personal note\n    \n    For me, my favorite place was Hiroshima. The vibe of the place, the architecture, the stores, the people and so on. It felt like Tokyo in some ways, but not nearly as crowded or chaotic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thanks for reading this far** \ud83d\udc96 .

Since it was a lot of text I tried to make it as readable as possible.  \n\n\nRegarding the Kyoto garden, I just looked at google and there is more than one, so I can understand the confusion. [Check if this link works for you](https://goo.gl/maps/oosWssMRgU1Yf99E9), if not, try searching for \"Kyoto botanical garden\".   \n\n\nThese are the reasons for **us** prefering Tokyo tower over the others: \n\n\\- The elevator on Sky tree and Shibuya had like animations and stuff, but the elevator at Tokyo tower had a trasparent view of the structure as you ascend. \n\n\\- On the second elevator between the two viewing decks, you are present with the story of the tower, there are some videos and narration involved.\n\n\\- There are multiple spots where you can get a photo taken by a pro photographer at Tokyo Tower and then buy the photo later at the photo stand if you like them.\n\n\\- The top deck is small but has a diamond-mirror pattern in all the walls, making the whole scene superb.\n\n\\- The red ilumination of the tower also adds to the whole vibe.\n\nIs not that Shibuya sky and Sky tree were worse, we just prefered Tokyo tower from the experience we got. I think for a sunset view, you can enjoy Shibuya sky more, as it has places to lay down and chill. \n\nSky tree, besides being the tallest, having some illuminated rooms and a nice deck, just didn't have anything particularly special for us. For again, this is just our opinion.",

I\u2019m curious about buying tickets in advance for Tokyo skytree &amp; Shibuya sky. I know which days I want to go but weather could mess it up so I don\u2019t want to get locked in for Shibuya sky at sunset by booking so early and then it rains that day! How in advance did you get tickets to this? I know sunset needs to be reserved beforehand but I can\u2019t tell how in advance. \nSame with osaka aquarium. I know what day I\u2019m going but it sounds like its timed entrance tickets and then can stay till whenever. But since I want to go to tempozan marketplace first, I just don\u2019t know how much time I\u2019ll need to book a timed entrance at the aquarium. \nAlso thanks for being honest and calling out all the Instagram food spots that aren\u2019t good. Sometimes the comment sections of those posts tells you the truth, but ya funny to call it out. Which ones specifically werent good? Oh and one more thing, is it difficult to make same day reservations on the jr trains? Should I be reserving all my major train rides in advance",

If there are a few, you'll have to take the chance. \n\nWe tried checking two days before for Shibuya sky and sunset time was already sold out. Also, keep in mind that rain isn't the only problem. A clouded sky also takes from the experience. \n\nFor the Osaka aquarium, we did it as soon as the tickets were available. You don't have a time to leave, just a time to enter, so if you go early you can stay as much as you want. I would say for the aquarium, if traveling with a small group and no children, try to at least have a couple hours. If having a big group and children, try to aim for 4 hours.\n\nRegarding instagram foods. Most of the macha or sakura flavoured stuff. The 10 yen coins, the old man cakes (things like that), they were OKAY, but just OKAY, they are not marvels as advertised. Actually the 10 yen coins were pretty bad for us, as we are not used to mix melted cheese with sweet things. But again, cuisine in our country is way too different. You might like them all, so always try it by yourself.\n\nFor the JR trains, it really depends where you're going. Some trains you are better booking a few days in advance, others you can book  on your way to the station. Most of the trains also have non-reserved cars, but you risk not having a seat or not seating with your group.  For example we found out that going to Kawaguchiko was mostly booked the same day, as well as the Tokyo - Kyoto shinkansen.\n\nIf you don't mind expending time, it is better to book as much as you can in advance for the JR tickets, you can just cancel them or rebook if you have a problem or want to change the schedule.",

Didn\u2019t know the 10yrs coins were salty sweet. I know everyone\u2019s tastebuds are different, i guess it\u2019s just the thing to try, but the line will be the indicator for me!",

(Let's say 1 hour because I don't remember the time frame). If you don't cancel it by that time and then you miss the train, the website doesn't allow you to book another trip until the other one finalizes. \n\nThe only way we had to book another tickets for that same time, was on a JR stand. They'll help you re-book, but it isn't possible to do from the website, meaning that you'll need to queue for the JR stand if you are on a big station.\n\nRegarding the food, yeah we meant the jiggly cakes. It wasn't bad, but not as good as expected. It is good that you're willing to try by yourself, just use my comments as reference, maybe even lowering your expectations could result in a better experience.",

You can buy the JR pass there or on 3rd parties. \n\nYou can find cheaper passes at 3rd parties but you won't have access to that site. On the oficial site you can make online reservations (so you don't need to find a machine on the stations to do so).\n\nOnce you've made a reservation online tho, you still need to go to a machine to grab the physical tickets.   \n\n\nRegarding the Sunrise-seto. The JR pass gives you free access to the nobi-nobi seats, which is a mat-like floor, with some covers and pillows. There is enough space for some carry-on baggage and a big  suitcase. It is a shared space, but it is enough to sleep properly.  \n\n\nThe reservation for those seats is always 1 month in advance at arround 9 or 10 am Japan time. If you reserved the JR pass on the official page, you can go to that page, choose your start and end city, and the Sunrise-seto will pop as an option. The tickets are sold fast for that train, so if you don't reserve arround the time they release, you are done for.\n\nYou'll also need to check the cities where the sleeper train stops at. It doesn't cover many.\n\nFinally, you can upgrade your seat at a Japan JR office from the nobi-nobi to the individual rooms, however you'll need to pay a fee and since it can only be done in person, the rooms probably would be already sold out once you arrive to Japan and get to the JR office.",

However you'll need to book in advance if you book on a busy day and since it only have a couple of departures a day, if you miss it then bad luck. \n\nI highly recomment aiming for this one, since it is faster and you have reserved seats. However beware that the JR pass only covers a part of the trip. So if you're reserving on the website, you'll need to book the Tokyo/Otsuki section and then on a ticket machine or JR counter book the other part.\n\nAlternatively, you can go directly to a JR counter and ask the staff memebers to book the whole ride, [you'll need to pay for the part that isn't covered by the JR pass](https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/fuji-excursion-train#Tickets_and_fares) (I would prefer this option as it seems easier).\n\nIn our case, the train was fully booked so we had to use local trains (the trains that you use to go to other parts of the city. We ended up using the JR Chuo Line up to Otsuki station. From there you need to take another local train; the Fujiyuku line, that takes you up to Kawaguchiko. It takes between 40 mins - 1 hour more with this method. Plus you don't have the chance to reserve seats.",

Usually if we didn't know if a place needed tickets, we would google something like \"PLACE NAME tickets\".\n\nIf something came up, we would check and see if mostly was booked or available. If mostly was available we woulld leave the booking for the last day or we would purschase the tickets at the door.\n\nYou can assume most museums, aquariums, gardens and stuff like that would require a ticket, however only very very famous places would need a reservation in advance to ensure your entrance.\n\nFor reservations itself, we used these:\n\n[Official JR pass site](https://www.japanrailpass-reservation.net): We bought the pass in the site, made all the reservations there in advance and headed to machines on the stations only to print the tickets (yes you need to print them anyways but you skip the line for the reservation).\n\n[teamLabs](https://planets.teamlab.art/tokyo/): Some days it gets full, so grab them in advance to avoid problems.\n\n[Tokyo Disney](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/index.html): We bought the tickets here. And then in the mobile app we purschased the express pass.\n\n[Klook - USJ](https://www.klook.com/activity/46604-universal-studios-japan-e-ticket-osaka-qr-code-direct-entry/?gclid=CjwKCAjwjMiiBhA4EiwAZe6jQxgGcQU2hBdTcGeClwTv6C-KYmNKuqpEthNR3L1uS60Nghh9SB_XzhoCID8QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds): For universal, the site was not accepting credit cards from outside Japan at that point so we had to use Klook. (If going to USJ, please grab a express pass, it will make your day WAY better).\n\n[Osaka Aquarium](https://www.kaiyukan.com/language/eng/ticket.html): If you're going to it, you can make the reservations online. Depending on the day, you might not need it as it doesn't get crowded all the time.\n\n[Sky Tree](https://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/ticket/): You'll need reservation for the best times (Sunset for example). Same for [Shibuya Sky](https://www.shibuya-scramble-square.com/sky/ticket/).\n\nFor other things like Tokyo tower or the Tokyo's art aquarium, we just bought the tickets at the door, but it is really about checking whether or not there are a lot of tickets sold at some point and decide based on that wether to reserve or not.\n\nAlso, on **Klook** there are some \"packages\" you can purschase that give you entrances to a lot of different places on a certain area, [for example this one](https://www.klook.com/activity/81037-have-fun-in-tokyo-pass-one-week-free-pass/?gclid=CjwKCAjwjMiiBhA4EiwAZe6jQ9ThZF676N_EkNVk830KKPx3kQCHAhSS7Nr74Qy0FRw4fsZWZcURGhoCBxwQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds). However I think that it needs a little bit extra planning to take advantage of that.  \n\n\nI would suggest to [check this](https://www.klook.com/experiences/city-mcate/28-2-tokyo-attractions/activity/?spm=City.BusinessEntry%3Aany%3A%3ACityBusinessEntry%3ACategory_LIST&amp;clickId=87948da6c4&amp;city_ids=28&amp;frontend_id_list=2) as well.",

The little details like needing to print the tickets are very handy too, thank you!",

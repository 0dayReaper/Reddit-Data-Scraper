    "postText": "Source: https://www.jreast.co.jp/press/2023/20230602_ho01.pdf (in Japanese)\n\nRegular Suica and PASMO card will be temporarily unavailable for purchase from June 8 onward due to chip shortage. This includes Monorail Suica and Rinkai Suica.\n\n\"Welcome Suica\" and \"PASMO PASSPORT\", designed for short term visitors, will continue to be available. Moreover, PASMO PASSPORT will have its 500 yen issuance fee waived. Mobile Suica will still continue to be available.\n\nThey will still be available for sale in Aomori, Morioka, and Akita area, because IC Card was just recently introduced there.\n\nNamed Suica and PASMO will still be available. I believe those can also be purchase at the machine, with you having to enter your name ~~in Katakana~~. Note that according to the rule, **named card can only be used by the person named on the card.**\n\n**EDIT:** u/2_Scoop_Rice mentioned that you can use English name and foreign phone number to get Named Suica card.\n\n**Can I still get ICOCA/SUGOKA/TOICA/Kitaca?**\n\nAs far as I know those should still be available, as there are no announcement by their respective company.\n\n**Can I use Mobile Suica/PASMO?**\n\nYes if you have an iPhone. See https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/#wiki_what_is_this_.22mobile_suica.22_and_.22mobile_pasmo.22_i.27ve_been_hearing_about.3F_you_can_use_them_on_your_phone_now.3F.3F\n\n**What is Welcome Suica/PASMO PASSPORT?**\n\nThose are cards made for tourist, which will expire after 28 days and no refund can be made. Welcome Suica has no fee, while PASMO PASSPORT has 500 yen fee but it will be waived from June 8th.\n\nWelcome Suica Information (including how to get one): https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html\n\nPASMO PASSPORT Information (including how to get one): https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/",

Just got my named Suica last week at Ueno Station.  \n\nYou do not have to enter your name in katakana, I'm a baka American and all I had to do was select the English option, enter my name in English, and also enter my US phone number.  My name is printed out in English on my card.",

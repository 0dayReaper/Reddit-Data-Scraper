            "comment": "Honestly the days seem a bit packed in general for me (as the parent of a young toddler/preschooler in Japan), but if you put your \u201cmust do\u201d or ticketed activity in the morning, then you can easily nix anything in the afternoon if it proves too much for your child or wife (being a tourist is exhausting and being pregnant is exhausting! Being both will no doubt be doubly so!). Make sure you have your stroller!\n\nFor example, Yokohama (which is where I live):  I\u2019d put my must do in the morning (for us, it would be Anpanman, may need tickets ahead of time), maybe hit lunch down the street at Mark IS shopping center (very popular with kids and parents), then chill on the cool rooftop garden or play in the fountains (bring extra clothes). \n\nIf it were my kid we\u2019d probably be a bit overstimulated, tired, and/or done for the day at that point, but since you\u2019re tourists you no doubt want to do more so you can then add in things like Cup Noodle and/or Red Brick Warehouse (often has awesome kid special stuff like a temporary beach, flower display, curry festival, etc). If not, then you can head back to Tokyo and call it a day. \n\nCan I ask what\u2019s the Motomachi Ramen Museum? Do you mean the one in Shin Yokohama? That\u2019s a different location, and a bit crowded and maybe not worth it, from what I hear. Lots of other great places to get ramen closer to where you\u2019ll be though!",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the thorough post, I really appreciate it. \n\nThe plan is definitely to put the \"must dos\" in the morning as I mentioned on another reply and then once we hit the wall/tired call it a day. Some of the days I've put multiple things in close proximity (at least map wise) to try keep us from travelling excessively. We're under no illusions that there is going to be things we have to miss out on due to exhaustion.  \n\nI think I have got the formatting messed up there, I've listed motomachi shopping street/district and Ramen museum as 2 separate places to visit in my list. We liked the idea of the Ramen museum due to being able to try multiple different styles of ramen in one place, but your advice is heeded and you're right that we can just grab ramen elsewhere. I did notice the distance but maps can obviously be misleading when you're looking top down and it seemed achievable. Neither of those places are must visits though.\n\nWe are bringing a stroller with us, and are expecting it'll get a fair bit of use \ud83d\ude05",

One toy store (not anything special), a few kids clothing stores (boring and fancy, imho). Not a fun thing for kids or even that much to see (except when it\u2019s Xmas). If you walk further to the gardens that\u2019s nice, but that\u2019s a lot of walking. \n\nLikewise with the ramen museum\u2014 I haven\u2019t been but I understand there\u2019s lots of waiting in line for food\u2014 which is not fun with my kid, lol.",

If it's going to be cumbersome after a long day out and about we'll probably give it a miss (especially if getting there is a drama too).\n\nWill strike motomachi off the list for sure based on your feedback.",

I'll have a look at the Botanical gardens though, thanks for the recommendation.\n\nThat shopping will likely be for things we will use while still travelling; clothes, snacks, etc as well as anything else we see and want. \n\nIt is plausible we could move it to the Tokyo dome day instead but the benefit of the Tokyo dome day as our second last day was that it was close to our accommodation and made it an easy day effort wise before we start the harder flight home day. \n\nWill have a think and maybe rearrange a bit.

Only walked past it on a way to another lovely big park / garden next to it but it looked awesome for kids",

I was completely exhausted most of the time I spent in Japan. I wish we had paced ourselves more, and focused on one or two things a day. I would maybe add Tokyo tower. The view is amazing.",

Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it \ud83d\ude42\n I probably should have put in the post that at any point we will just call it a day if we are too tired or toddler is cranky. Nothing here is set in stone except for the teamlabs and aquarium because of the tickets.  \n\nWe did Tokyo tower on our first trip and were not too far away where we are staying so if the feeling strikes us we can always head over to the tower and go up :)",

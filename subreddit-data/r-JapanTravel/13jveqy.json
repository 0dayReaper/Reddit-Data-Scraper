    "postText": "Hi folks,  \nWe are coming to Japan in a few days, and I still have some questions regarding the use of IC cards on regional trains (apologies if I'm using the wrong term for such trains).  \nWe will primarily be staying in the Kansai area and will be traveling quite a lot for short distances, such as from Osaka to Kobe or Kyoto to Uji. For example, when I search on Google Maps for the Osaka to Kobe route, it shows me two options (excluding the Shinkansen): the Kobe Line and the Tokaido-Sanyo Line. Similarly, for Kyoto to Uji, it suggests starting on the Keihan Main Line and later switching to the Nara Line. In both cases, the fare is around \u00a5400. Since it's a relatively small amount, am I correct in assuming that I can use an IC card for these lines?  \nIs there a guide available that explains if it's possible to pay with an IC card on a specific line? I have checked different websites, such as JR West, but I couldn't find a clear indication (or maybe I overlooked it). My assumption is that if a train only requires a basic fare, then I can use an IC card for it. Is this correct?  \nWe will also be using some Kintetsu trains like Blue Symphony or Aoniyoshi, and I have booked tickets for them online. In the confirmation email, it states that I will need to have both the online booked tickets and a base fare ticket. Do you know if it will be possible to pay the base fare with an IC card?",

            "comment": "You are right to assume those are covered by IC cards, but for the wrong reason. They are covered because the station/railway have IC card reader installed in the stations. Especially the more densely area like Kansai and Tokyo are really well covered, while regions like Kyushu and Shikoku only have little IC card coverage. You can also do quite a long distances with an IC card, assuming you use local lines only.\n\nAlso instead of \"regional train\", I think people would refer to Non-JR as private railway (even if technically JR is no longer a national railway). However, only if they are train company, subways are subways, tram are tram, etc.\n\nBut yeah, you are fine.",

This subreddit has been incredibly helpful in so many ways.  \nI just have one quick question that I couldn't find an answer to about the IC cards. I have not been able to confirm when they can be used for trains other than the Shinkansen, ie for nearby cities.  \nIn my case I am doing Osaka to Nara, Nara to Kyoto, and Kyoto to Kanazawa (this one for example is 15000 yen).\n\nAs far as I could see I would be using Rapid, Express, and Limited Express for these. Can I pay for these directly with the IC card or do I need to get a ticket at the machines?",

There is no extra fee as your fee will be determined when you tap your IC card as you exit the station. Unless you used luxury train/ shinkansen then thats a different story xDD",

                                    "comment": "Yes, definitely. You can use your IC card to get to those places. For example, from Osaka to Nara you may use the Kintetsu line and it accepts IC card when you tap in. You can use Local, Rapid express and Limited express trains to get to Nara. Local stops on every station. Rapid express skips some station and Limited express skips more stations than Rapid. So if you are planning to get to Nara station (assuming you wanna feed the deers/visit Todaiji temple), using Limited express will get you to your destination faster. There is no extra fee whatsoever as you will pay just the station you are going to exit to with your IC card you used when you enter. All trains will get to Nara station anyway. It applies to other places. It is just a matter of how fast you wanna go. Google maps will show you what kind of train arriving at what time if you adjust the time. \n\nHope this helps.",

    "postText": "Have had a nightmare few days but I fly out today and hope that I can get a medical assessment in the next country.\n\nI injured my neck a couple of weeks ago which was exacerbated by backpacking Japan with 14kg on me. I believe it was impacting the nerves in my neck and got so bad I had pain and tingles throughout my back, hands, neck, and jaw. I had to rest at the hostel during the day to manage the pain.\n\nA few days ago, I lost muscle control in my lower body. I immediately called a taxi for the local emergency department. I spoke to an English-speaking nurse who seemed very empathetic and understood the gravity of the situation. After leaving and coming back, she said there was nothing they could do because it was night time (it was 7pm) and I should come back in the morning. I tried to emphasise I needed help now or could have a permanent disability, clarified that I could pay for any help they gave me. She said she could call in the doctor but he isn\u2019t a specialist and could only give me pain relief (I wasn\u2019t in pain at that time). \n\nI asked if she could transfer me to a hospital that could help me, she said no. I asked if she could help me make a phone call to other hospitals to see if they could take me (I don\u2019t have a Japanese sim), she said no because they won\u2019t answer the phone. I said can we at least try, she said no. \n\nMy Japanese friend helped me call 3 other hospital emergency departments for me (and yes, they did answer the phone), all of which said that they couldn\u2019t get a specialist in to look at me and I should try again tomorrow morning or try a different hospital. After a few hours I gave up because I seemed to have full control of my body back and no hospital was helping me.\n\nThe next day I went to Kyoto university hospital, which is the largest hospital in Kyoto and the 4th biggest hospital in all of Japan. I explained the situation to reception who passed on the info to a doctor via phone. The doctor said he wouldn\u2019t see me because they were too busy. I broke down crying and so they gave me the number of a local doctor who speaks English. I called the doctors surgery and they said they wouldn\u2019t see me until Monday (it was Friday) because they don\u2019t do afternoon consultations. I tried to call the Australian embassy in Japan but the line was consistently busy. \n\nNow I still have nerve pain and some numbness but no other issues. I\u2019m horrified that no one would help me and have been in a state of high anxiety over the last few days knowing that if I lost muscle control again, no medical professional in Japan cares. In every instance I clarified I can pay out of pocket whatever it costs, but no one would help.\n\nIs this normal? What happens if someone has a life threatening illness? Is this treatment potentially because I\u2019m a foreigner and don\u2019t speak Japanese?\n\nUp until this point I loved Japan but now I\u2019m afraid about ever coming back.\n\nEdit to add: I hadn\u2019t realised ambulances were free or prioritised. In my country it costs $600 to call an ambulance and provision of healthcare is given regardless of how you enter the hospital. Obviously for anyone reading this and considering going to Japan - important to know that ambulances are free and given priority.",

They're not affiliated with any specific hospital and will call around until they find somewhere to take you.  Ambulances are free here.  Dial 119 and they'll do the rest.",

Lots of the time people who are very sick walk in and those who aren\u2019t sick come in by ambulance. It makes no difference how you got there.\n\nHowever, in this situation calling an ambulance would have gotten the injured person to an ED that was actually taking patients. Once they got there it would have been up to the triage professional to determine time to be seen.",

I have been in an emergency myself and the emts in an ambulance stated that at least in California, there's a policy between ambulance and hospitals that liability is transferred immediately when a patient is admitted so a hospital must make every effort to insure the patient is examined as a high priority.  When a hospital has a walk-in, the liability may be lessened based upon the severity of the patient.",

Specifically, a lack of it.\n\n&gt; but a proper system of healthcare\n\nI've lived in Japan for over 30 years. I've had in-laws deal with cancer treatment, my wife had orthopedic surgery, we've had multiple kids, I've had friends in hospitals here for various surgeries and procedures. I know people with long term disabilities and chronic illnesses. I assure you, Japan has a wonderful system of healthcare.\n\n&gt; involves hospitals that are willing to help you in an emergency regardless of whether you walk in or are driven in (why does that make a difference to how urgently you need help?)\n\nThat is not the way hospitals work in Japan. There *are* hospitals here with emergency rooms but not every hospital has them. You can walk into an emergency hospital but you will wait hours and hours, and there is no guarantee that they will have a specialist on hand who can deal with your specific problem. They might not even have a department that deals with your specific problem.\n\nWhen you have an emergency (not a stomach ache), you call an ambulance. That's how it works. It's puzzling that your Japanese friend didn't know this but some people don't adult very well, and Japan isn't an exception.\n\n&gt; Why aren\u2019t more Japanese people angry about this. \n\nBecause the system works well 99% of the time. Japan has pretty much the longest life expectancy in the world. There is a lot of preventative care done here (people get yearly physicals through their employers, paid for by their health insurance), and the medical system works extremely well.\n\n&gt; People above are commenting news articles where people have died after calling the ambulance and STILL being rejected by 20-30 different hospitals before passing away\n\nMost of those stories were from during the peak of the pandemic when there were hospitals in Japan that were beyond capacity. Japan never had a proper full lockdown, and a lot of people who were sick still went to work. This cause a partial breakdown in care and there were times when people who needed medical care were not able to get it. That is not the norm, and it is not the way it is now.\n\nIs Japan's medical system perfect? No. Is it fantastic? Yes. The failure you experienced was due to a lack of understanding on your part, nothing more.",

Actually probably 10s of thousands of hospitals. 99% or more of them do not have 24/7 emergency rooms. Those exist in designated hospitals.\n\nIf you happen to know the exact problem your passenger is having (maybe you're a doctor driving this person around?) and you know where the hospitals are, you could drive them there. Emergency rooms in Japan work similarly to emergency rooms elsewhere, if someone shows up dying they will get priority care. Of course if you show up at a hospital that cannot provide appropriate care for your friend, they're going to call an ambulance to transfer your friend somewhere that can care for them. (This is the same in most countries, including the US.)\n\nOr you could call 119 and tell them where you are, and an ambulance will be dispatched. Exactly like it would be for a traffic accident. You understand those happen right? And ambulances get dispatched. This is not a complex concept...\n\nThe biggest difference is that in Japan you can't just rock up to *any* hospital in Japan as 99% or more of them do not have emergency rooms.",

For example, you might find an orthopedic hospital that specializes in treating sports injuries. They're not going to have a 24/7 emergency room, and they're not going to be able to treat someone like OP. It's not what they do. Others may be more like clinics, even though they have \u75c5\u9662 (hospital) in their name.\n\nThis is why you can't just catch a taxi to some random local hospital, it's probably not going to be open outside their posted hours.\n\nIt is unwise to assume that a random foreign country will operate the same way that you expect from where you grew up. Japan has fantastic medical care (that's why people here live so damn long), it just doesn't operate in the same way you expect.",

This is the case in the US as well, not every medical facility has an ED. I think maybe you're just used to the idea that all major hospitals have a 24/7 ED, if that's the case in your country.\n\nSorry you had trouble finding healthcare though. Honestly this is a big fear of mine as well, and the reason I cut my recent trip to Japan super short (was worried about \"medium\" COVID since I had recovered the month prior but still had weird lingering systems).\n\nI had previously gotten an UTI over the new years in Japan and had no way of accessing healthcare due to the holiday. I was in pain and eventually a friend of a friend was kind enough to give me leftover antibiotics. If I were in your situation I wouldn't have any idea what to do either and wouldn't be familiar enough to navigate health care or find access on my own. It's a real issue that I'm surprised travelers don't prepare better for (including myself). I've even had a lot of trouble in the neighboring country of Canada. It's stressful.

Almost certainly to some random hospital without emergency services. If OP had called an ambulance, they would not have had this problem. You're not expected to get yourself to a hospital in the midst of an emergency, this isn't some backwards country that charges 1000s of dollars for ambulance service.\n\n&gt; Other commenters posted news articles of people dying in ambulances after getting refused from 20 hospitals.\n\nThose stories are almost certainly from the pandemic. Japan never had a proper lockdown and far too many people went in to work sick, spreading the virus as they went. The result was a partial breakdown in care as many hospitals were overwhelmed. This is obviously not the normal state of things.\n\n&gt; There are many problems with healthcare in the US but this isn\u2019t one of them\n\nMany Americans absolutely refuse to go to the hospital because they are terrified of bankrupting themselves and their families. It's an appalling system that should not exist in a developed country today.\n\n&gt; Of course, it would be nicer to be in Europe - free care and responsive treatment.\n\nYou should look into the European healthcare system more closely. Want to see a doctor in Germany? Wait a few days. A specialist? Much longer. Want something like an MRI? A month or more unless you're already an admitted patient, then it might be as \"quick\" as a 4-5 days. In Japan there are almost no wait times for treatment. Doctor visit? Same day. Specialist clinic? You don't even need a referral, just go. MRI? My wife needed one and there was effectively no wait time.\n\n&gt; But Japan is no paradise\n\nJapan's medical system is not perfect, but I would take it over any other I have experienced. It's certainly light years ahead of the US or Canada, far better than the UK, and better than others I have looked in to. It's no surprise that Japan has a life expectancy of 85 while the US is 77 and falling.\n\nIt's unfortunate that OP didn't understand how to deal with an emergency in Japan and as such did not receive the care they could have. It seems they just gave up and decided to complain on Reddit, too. Pretty odd way to go about things when apparently in need of care.",

There is a big issue with Japanese medical facilities not treating foreigners, or anyone without the national health insurance. \n\nRecently, civilians who work in Japan for the US government found they lost their medical benefits on base and have to find treatment (for everything including emergencies) at local medical facilities, only to be turned away or charged 200 percent more. Japanese officials say they were not notified of this change nor given notice to expect an influx of foreigners seeking medical care. It has resulted in [loss of life](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/asia_pacific/2023-02-08/civilian-health-care-japan-social-media-9082404.html). I know access to medical care here is treated differently than other parts of the world, yet I wonder if your situation is in someway related to this. \n\nI hope you are able to regain your normal sense of feeling soon and not experience any further health issues.",

This is is the way TMI works all over the world.\n\nIf you are going halfway across the world without TMI, then you are at least partially to blame for experience. While Japan does not explicitly state that you need TMI to enter Japan - immigration law specifically states that a person should not be a burden upon taxpayer, i.e. should have adequate insurance coverage.\n\nAs for:\n\n&gt; civilians who work in Japan for the US government \n\nThat's on US government. I'm sorry, but people can't have it both ways - you are either a SOFA contractor and are not bound by Japanese residency rules or you are a Japanese resident with obligation to fulfil residency/visa criteria, pay Japanese taxes, health contributions and the like.",

My experience even in countries with government/subsidized medical care, if you\u2019re a foreigner who is not a part of that, hospitals are hesitant to provide care unless they have some guarantee that you can pay for the entire care. \n\nI\u2019m not doubting you but if you show up at a hospital with no obvious wound and claim an ailment that they might need to run tests to confirm and they\u2019re not satisfied that you can pay, they can pull a \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d and try to get you to leave. Even if you can pay for the tests, if they run some tests and if those tests confirm the medical emergencies, they might be obligated to admit you when they don\u2019t know if you have the means to pay for the entire care. \n\nYes it sucks. As much as people pile on the US healthcare and rightly so, if you show up at an emergency room, unless it\u2019s patently obvious you\u2019re malingering, they\u2019ll provide care. You gonna be billed what you might need a lifetime to pay back, but you\u2019ll get care. \n\nSo we always travel with medical insurance including med evac. The primary purpose for the past few years have been the incidentals that might be incurred if we test positive for Covid before departure but it\u2019d cover your situation as well.",

Can't say good or bad things about them since I didn't have to call on them but it was nice knowing I had $500,000 med coverage with $1 million med evac in case I got dismembered by a sloth or something. $250,000 for the dismemberment on top of that, too. Nice.\n\nIt also covered more mundane stuff like trip delay/interruption, missed connection, even pet medical in case our cat somehow snuck into the luggage and was worse for wear. The cost was pretty reasonable too. Around $150 for a family of 4.",

Last time I was in Kyoto last summer, my child had an issue that required urgent attention, and was able to get seen by a specialist with Kyoto University the same day \u2014 something that likely would have taken weeks in the US.  And the bill was like $20.\n\nI think a key difference though is that I speak Japanese.  Having someone who speaks Japanese, and knows the Japanese culture, advocate for you probably makes the most sense.  The numbers the other posters put on this thread seem good to follow up on.

This is why you get travel insurance; just read the fine print because it might not cover some things like injury by riding a motorbike (for example).\n\nThough, as it turns out, the ambulance call out is free in Japan. I did not know this until reading this thread. \n\nI would have just called an ambulance in any serious situation (to answer your question: what if it's life threatening) and just taken onboard the cost and deal with travel insurance later. After all, if my health is at risk that's more important.\n\nIn Australia, for residents, health insurance covers Ambulance call-outs and, in Victoria, at least, you can just buy annual ambulance subscription if you don't want full health insurance. And, $600 for an ambulance call-out in Australia seems to be on the low side.",

Nishiki market within walking distance for those rainy days, lots and lots of good food close. Loved it.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/azddt0M.jpg \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1vkeywL.jpg \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Civ98kc.jpg",

Our room was spacious with a tatami floor and seating area. The attached bathroom had a large soaking tub and shower, as well. \n\nTheir rooftop terrace offers spectacular views of Kyoto and has a hot foot bath which we greatly enjoyed after walking all day. My spouse loved the onsite open air onsen and visited twice a day. (Note that it is a private onsen and they do not allow tattoos which cannot be covered by a bandage. I found a tattoo-friendly sento for myself.) \n\nThe location also can't be beat as it's right by Nishiki Market, Pontocho, tons of shopping, food, train stations &amp; bus stops.\n\nThe concierge was incredibly helpful and managed to book us a reservation at a fantastic yakiniku restaurant in Pontocho we otherwise would not have been able to get into.",

            "comment": "Location is wholly dependent on what you want to see the most. We chose Higashiyama because everything we planned to do was there, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat - everything was very walkable and being lazy enough to take a taxi instead of finding the nearest bus/train to get to and from Kyoto Station did not break the bank.\n\nWe stayed at the Wajun Kaikan, which is connected to Chion-in temple. Pricier, so while we enjoyed our stay immensely I can only really recommend it if it fits certain factors for the traveler: if you want a ryokan experience with or without meals (we went without because there is so much good food in the area), want to try Japanese-style rooms or mixed Japanese-Western, you like being on the doorstep of Maruyama Park/Yasaka Shrine, want to experience the buddhist services at Chion-in, want to be in/near Higashiyama/Gion for all the sights but not so close to Kiyomizudera that every day is wall-to-wall-crowds, and you can afford the splurge. It's a good fit for people wanting a traditional-ish experience in a modern and well-maintained hotel who are only staying in Kyoto 1-3 nights, I would imagine the cost would be prohibitive for a longer stay even if this is your one \"treat yourself\" splurge during the trip. And fair warning, while I did just fine my other half apparently did not sleep as well on their futons compared to the ones at other ryokan, your mileage may vary. I loved it, we even got to set them up ourselves since we weren't on a meal plan where the hotel will set them up for you while you're at dinner. A mixed room might be a better fit for people who aren't sure about their mattress helping or harming their sleep.",

The tatami rooms were simple but comfortable and well kept. Breakfast had these tasty tonkatsu sandwiches from a local bakery in addition to toast, fruit and miso soup. \n\nThere is a sento (free access for guests) across the street and one of the staff members actually took the time to walk me to the front desk and explain to me all the rules. \n\nOnly cons were that the washrooms/showers were ridiculously tiny (think airplane lavatory) and the dining options nearby were limited, unless you were ok walking 10-15 mins north to the area near Shijo Omiya station.",

Super sleek, modern, clean and in an amazing location in walking distance from lots of shops, food, and transportation. Had a nice lobby bar/restaurant where you can relax as well as a Blue Bottle Coffee downstairs. Rooms were relatively spacious and felt brand new - think higher end Hyatt in the US. I felt like it was really good value.",

It's quite a new hotel so the rooms are nice and shiny. \n\nIt had something I've never seen before: a washer dryer *inside the room.* As convenient as regular coin laundries are, it's nice to able to start a load and go off sightseeing without worrying about someone else wanting to use it. .",

    "postText": "My partner and I (Australian) have been here for almost a week of our three week stint now, and I have to say for the most part, other (obvious) tourists from most countries have been pretty good in respect to wearing a mask in indoor settings, abiding by the general Japanese mindset of being considerate and respectful of others around them etc.\n\nBut for those of you I've noticed on my travels being maskless or with it tucked firmly under your chin, why? The Japanese (especially older generations) were so hesitant to get tourism back to Japan after the pandemic and you are shining examples of why the older Japanese generally don't like western tourists!! Just wear the fucking mask and shut the fuck up! If you don't want to wear it, then don't come here until things ease up. The signs are literally everywhere at shops, trains, whatever. \n\nThe kicker was today my partner and I saw three Aussie tourists, young guys in Kyoto at a tourist destination and one of them was getting irritated because the facility staff were super hesitant to let him in without a mask. Like for fucks sakes mate, how hard can it be to wear it for the hour it took to walk through the castle?\n\nPlease, stop giving the Japanese reasons to dislike tourists and just abide by their requirements while you're here. Masks are like 350 yen for a 4 pack.",

Those masks most people wear are so thin, with relatively \"large\" holes in them that they don't have any effect at all on viruses. You can see through most of them because they are so thin.\n\nWe came to Japan wearing those European hardcore barely breathable FFP2 masks - that we were used to - but since everyone else was wearing the thin \"just for show\" mask, we switched to those as well.\n\nI am going to Japan again in January, and of course I will wear those masks, but... It is sort of a silly show. I respect Japanese culture and do wear the mask, but it is an excellent illustration of one of the not so great parts of Japanese culture.",

            "comment": "Welcome to America, friend. If you let us in, learn to adapt your rules. (And we aren\u2019t the only ones, other countries are like this)\n\nI don\u2019t say this for myself. I\u2019d respectfully wear a mask inside and even in crowded streets. However the demographic that largely travels to Japan from the US (largely, the wealthy and ostracized incels) largely deny COVID existed or ever was truly a problem even though it killed people (\u201cSo does the flu, snowflake!\u201d is a common thing heard).\n\nThey don\u2019t care if people are offended, they don\u2019t care if people die, and they don\u2019t care about the opinions of anybody, ESPECIALLY those who are not Americans. \n\nThat is where we are at over here. If you want it your government\u2019s way (completely reasonable) and you want to follow protocols and some idealistic approach to lower numbers, simply keep Americans out. \n\nWhat people aren\u2019t saying is that a majority of Americans didn\u2019t last 2 weeks in the pandemic actually following the protocols completely here before someone invented the idea that COVID wasn\u2019t an issue and essentially abandoned those who would die from the bug if they caught it.\n\nFortunately the vaccines are working so well (for now) that this charade can continue here with less damage than we might face otherwise.",

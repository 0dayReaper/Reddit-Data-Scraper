Either takyubin your luggage or store it in a locker and go to straight to nishiki for shopping and lunch.  \n\nFushimi doesn't close. I'd advise to go and watch the sunset and then the city light up.  It's also cooler. Bring a flashlight if you plan to walk to the top, there are lights but they cast shadows that make the uneven stairs hard to judge.",

Ryoan-ji is another popular choice on that same route.",

You can eat something before moving to afternoon shoppping in ginza.\n\n\nDay 6 is kinda wasted if you only do that. Go shopping around in Kyoto. It\u2019s lovely.\n\nDay 7 \nPersonally fushimi in afternoon is much better. I would switch it up but it\u2019s up to you.\n\nDay 8\nYou can try to use a bike for those locations. Biking in Kyoto is extremely fun. \n\nDay 12\nGo to the north eastern part of Kyoto. All the temples and philosopher path are great sights and you can get there with a bike. Better even ride up the Kamo river to botanical garden and afterwards eastward down making stops wherever u want. Next to the botanical garden on the north side is a big family restaurant where you can get a menu with all you can eat side dishes, called Volks. \n\nI would nit switch around the hotels from Kyoto to Osaka and Kyoto. Sticking to one place is much better especially with luggage\u2019s. Just something I experienced myself after couple months in Japan. \n\nHave fun and don\u2019t forget, weekends are days where you better reserve for restaurants.\n\nDay 9-10\nFeels like your abusing the Osaka amazing pass.",

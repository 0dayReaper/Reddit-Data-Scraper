    "postText": "Hello all, \n\nMy (M25) wife (F24) and I are going on a trip to Japan in early June. It will be our first time in Japan so we are very excited! I've been doing a bunch of research, and this sub has been exceedingly helpful. I've come up with the following itinerary for our trip, and I would really appreciate any tips, advice, comments, etc. \n\nA few notes/questions:\n\n* My biggest concern is trying to do too much, especially in Tokyo, so I would appreciate some insight. We're fairly young and want to get the most out of this trip so don't mind moving fast, but also flexible as long as we check off the big things and have fun.\n* I'd love some suggestions for night walks. I really want to see the cities light up at night so any cool places to walk at night would be appreciated.\n* I plan on really stretching the mornings out, eating snacks from 7/11 and places along the way, and eating lunch at like 2 PM or something when it's a lot less busy. I wrote down some places that had good reviews on Google Maps but we will just eat when we're hungry enough in the place with the shortest line.\n* Suggestions for which cuisines specifically to try in each area. Also would really appreciate suggestions for best places for coffee, tea, snacks since my wife is really into that.\n* Does anyone know if most hotels are okay with holding luggage after checkout, or are we better off forwarding it? \n\n \n\n### Day 1: (to Tokyo)\n\nFly to Tokyo\n\nArrival: 3:55 pm at Haneda\n\nActivate eSIM, withdraw yen from ATM (50,000 JPY?), exchange JRPass, get Suica Card\n\nTake metro to hotel\n\n### Night 1 (Tokyo) \n\nRest and recover from jet-lag\n\nExplore Akihabara and the area around hotel (hotel is short walk from Akihabara in Chiyoda)\n\nGrab dinner near hotel, Akihabara\n\n### Day 2/Night 2 (Tokyo) \n\n1.

            "comment": "Get dinner at the Gyukatsu in Akihabara! Out of the 5+ locations we tried to visit across Tokyo, that location easily had the shortest line. I wouldn\u2019t enter the line any later than 7:30 PM because there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll run out before you\u2019re able to get seated. Keep in mind that most restaurants stop seating an hour before they close. \n\nAs far as everything you have planned, it\u2019s nice to have an itinerary but make sure you allow yourself time to be present in the moment. You want to enjoy your trip, not look back and realize how you kept rushing from location to location. Mark down the absolute most-see places and then be okay with not being able to visit everything else.\n\nMost of the stations will have amazing food options. I picked up a wagyu bento box at Tokyo station for ~$9 USD. I would have eaten that bento every day if I could have. \n\nWhy not exchange cash now? With Japan\u2019s tourism on the rise, their yen is bound to get stronger. You would get more bang for your buck by exchanging now.",

It was exhausting, but I feel like I truly got to do everything I wanted to do. I fully expected my itinerary to be too packed, but I ended up doing everything I had planned and more. I only did Tokyo, and had a pretty different itinerary so I can\u2019t weigh in that much but I will make a note for day 4. The gardens are HUGE and you can spend a lot of time in them so keep that in mind if you are doing Yogogi and Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden and really want to enjoy them. For one of my days, I did Meiji shrine, Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (had a picnic and got engaged there!), a Swallows baseball game, and Shibuya Crossing sights and shopping and it was a lot, not to mention something like 10 miles of walking. But still really fun and manageable if you really set your mind to it!",

            "comment": "Just a quick one - Looks fun (and tiring). However, are you sure you want to buy a 14 day JR Pass... it seems to me that you might be better off getting a 7 day pass, given how much time you're spending in Tokyo (where you won't get as much value out of it) - in which case you can activate your JR Pass once you're about to leave for Kyoto (if you activate it at airport, the clock starts ticking immediately, and there's also typically a huge queue to do it at airport too). The other comment I would make is that for the first trip, you're most probably doing too much - including in Kyoto. If using buses to get around, there's a lot of waiting and it can be quite uncomfortable.\n\nI'd also say in general, I don't think you're leaving enough time per area... if you want to rush through to see as much as possible, you're going to be numb by the end. Better to see less, and enjoy more IMHO. I would at least give yourself some down-time where you don't expect to do anything. Places like Shinjuku or Shibuya are fun to explore. Edit - for info, I've been to Japan maybe 12 times on holiday, and lived there 3 years. However, nowadays we're sporting a family, so there's a lot more you can do when you're young and 'free?'.\n\nAlso - the thing that is missing from your post is - what is it that you want to get out of the trip most of all. What is big ticket items for you - and why? I love Kyoto - but most people tend to get templed out pretty damn quick.\n\nIn Tokyo - night-walks depend very much on where you're located (hotel-wise)... and whether you mean romantic, night-life, the darker-side, great views. You can't beat a trip to Tokyo Tower in my opinion... for a night view. There's also some nice walks around there - especially if you're up to going to Roppongi Hills.\n\nAlmost all hotels will happily hold luggage. It's easy - and beats lockers.\n\nIn general - Japan is not a country for coffee. Of course they do it, and there's a mix of quality - but it's not what it's famous for.",

I just won't activate it until we leave for Kyoto.\n\n\\&gt; you're most probably doing too much \r  \n\r  \nI had a feeling it was too much, I did organize by area so we will probably try to explore the area at a decent pace and see how much we can cover.",

Just always a good idea to prioritise based on interest... rather than just shortest path to see X, Y and Z... just in case you run out of steam to see Z (if this was your priority). It's definitely good to break up the traditional areas with more variety areas... it's easy as I said to get zoned out and feel like you're on a tourist travellator - especially in Kyoto. The one thing I'd recommend is to check local festivals before you go. These can be gold, and really add a different experience.\n\nEdit - Oh BTW, just check which stations can activate it - and importantly - when that desk will close. We've personal experience of running around half of Tokyo to find an station that still could activate it in the evening (though many years ago).",

There's a store lurking near the Mitsukoshimae metro station in Nihombashi -- Tokyo, that is -- that sells random products from throughout the country. The Ogasawara Islands coffee was one of them. Can't recall the name at all, but it was in the basement level of a modern shopping complex across the street from the Mitsukoshi department store.)",

Imagine at lunch it might get pretty busy! I guess worst case you go conbini lunch if needed! \n* Ginza - It\u2019s a bit on the $$ side but Henri Charpentier is a classic spot, they do amazing cakes and famous for the Crepe Suzettes made in front of you, it\u2019s a tiny space, but we went at around 3:20pm and were seated within about 15 minutes. However another couple arrived just after us and don\u2019t think they were seated until about 4pm.   \nYou can get the cakes takeaway too though :)\n* Senso-ji - Swing by Asakusa Kagetsudo, it\u2019s around the back of Senso-ji. They\u2019re well known for their \u2018melon-pan\u2019 - you can get them plain which are delicious as is, or filled with flavoured soft serve. I always get this when I\u2019m by Senso-ji, can\u2019t help myself!  \nFuglen is a cute coffee/waffle spot around the back of the temple too.\n* Shibuya - If you love seeing the city light up at night, I can\u2019t recommend Shibuya Sky enough. We went at 6pm (sunset) and even on a cloudy day it was absolutely magic at that time. If you\u2019re open to it, you could swap your Day 4 and start in Shinjuku, do the parks, and then make your way through Harajuku to finish in Shibuya. \n   * Lots of coffee in your day 4 spot. Koffee Mameya had a huge and slow line from opening, we went to Higuma Doughnuts x Coffee Wrights on the same street which moved pretty quickly even with a line. The doughnuts were SO GOOD, if your wife is into sweets maybe consider this? \n      * Blue Bottle for coffee in Aoyama or Shibuya are both very nice, I\u2019d skip the Shinjuku location, not as peaceful. \n      * My husband and I also like Cafe Kitsune, coffee was good, and I got a lovely earl grey sponge roll which was delish. \n      * Streamer Coffee Company also good coffee, more grungy vibe than the other locations",

    "postText": "Me and my partner arrived in Osaka 8 days ago and hired a car for the last 5 days.\n\nWe used [Times Car Rental](https://www.timescar-rental.com) as they were the only company that allowed a no deposit no credit card hire (we only had debit cards).\n\n*Edit: Comments have suggested Toyota and Orix also do no credit card no deposit.*\n\nWe drove from Osaka stopping at Nara deer park then onto Nagoya, a stop over at Lake Biwa then onto Kyoto. Kyoto to Awaji Island then onto Kobe and back to Osaka.\n\nWe had a hybrid Toyota Aqua which easily fit me and my partner plus two large pieces of luggage after we folded the back seats down. Cost us 29,282 yen for the 5 days.\n\nWe used an ETC card and took the tolls whenever we could.\n\nThings I learnt:\n\n- Get a smallish car as many side streets are absolutely tiny.\n\n- Google maps easily got us around Japan even though we understand little to no Japanese.\n\n- Toll costs add up as we spent all up over 25,000 yen for the whole trip.\n\n- Everyone speeds! Trucks, buses, cars all going easily 20km/h over the speed limit all the time.\n\n- City driving is can be challenging as the GPS lags when around tall buildings. \n\n- Highway driving is a breeze with clearly marked exits and well maintained roads.\n\n- Japanese drivers are extremely polite always letting me merge in front when needed and thanking you when letting them in.\n\n- There is surprisingly good food at highway stops. Clean toilets too.\n\n- Surprisingly little traffic on the highway.\n\n- Couldn't find a decent radio station to listen to Japanese music :( Though Spotify had us covered.\n\n- Parking bays are easy to use and were mostly cheap 300 yen per hour usually.\n\n- Regular petrol was 140 yen per litre we spent around 6,000 yen for the trip.\n\nI'd recommend it for those confident in their driving and wanting to explore off the beaten path.",

Radar detectors for cars rely on not only radar detection, but on GPS: all of the coordinates of the fixed systems in Japan are inputted into the memory of the radar detectors (along with other info), and the unit warns the driver when they are approaching a detection system. So this new movable type the cops are starting to use screws with this.",

I returned to Tokyo the next day amd drove through the city parked at UDX and wandered Akihabara for a bit before driving over to Daikoku PA. At midnight I swung by. Tatsumi before going to my hotel in Odaiba. The next day I dropped family off in Shinjuku before driving back to Narita to drop the car off.\n\nI had the car 3 days and drove just under 1km.\n\nI spent 416 USD on the car.\n120 USD on premium fuel.\n180 USD on tolls.\n40 dollars on parking. (Parking was difficult because of the size and how low the GTR was)\n\n\nYes it was expensive, bit it honestly hands down our favorite part of the trip. Driving in Japan and even Tokyo was so much better than driving in the US. Japanese drivers for the most part are polite and fully understand road laws. On the expressways I cruised at 120kph but it wasnt uncommon for me to get passed by someone doing 150+. I remember a Porsche passed me and it made me feel like I was barely moving.\n\nDriving is THE best way to explore a country. My wife and I stopped at places that definitely hadn't seen foreigners in quite some time.",

It was mine &amp; my groups dream to drive 90\u2019s Japanese sports cars there, friend rented a RX-7 FD and it was well worth it.\n\nWe did hit some traffic even on the expressways but overall the experience was great. Did take us about 15 mins to get used to driving on the opposite side(American here) but once we got used to it things were easy. \n\nWe went to the Daikoku PA and the Nissan heritage collection, among some other places. Took the C2 tunnel from west to east Tokyo which was amazing. Anybody know how far under is that tunnel? Feel like we passed under the Shinjuku station among others.",

I didnt think of it at first which generated some hearty laughs when we pulled out of the rental place and started or first turn. The wipers are also upside down, i.e. a short flip up triggers a single wipe and down starts the repeating ones.\n\nMake sure to get an ETC card, it's super convenient.\n\nEven though Google maps gets you everywhere the built in GPS has lists of Service Areas (S.A), which are basically roadside stops with toilets, restaurants, etc.\n\nEveryone speeds, which was a bit shocking at first, however we just followed the traffic flow and everything was fine.\n\nPeople back into almost every parking space unlike in Sweden where we drive in head first. When you find one available you pass it and switch on your emergency lights (the dual blinking ones, little red triangle) and back in when you're free. This way people know when you are about to back up.\n\nThe emergency lights are sometimes also used if someone parks on the side of the street to \"just pop into the store real quick\". Worth noting when driving in Tokyo.\n\nWe are in Japan every year and have biyt rented a car before but will definitely do it from now on. I am a bit disappointed that we put it off for so long, it was much easier than I expected.",

I rented with orix, great experience. For the tolls I counted them up before going to Japan and found that a Japan expressway pass + ETC card would turn out cheaper. Drove in both Osaka and Tokyo city centers and didn't find it challenging at all, largest city I drove in before that was Chicago and would say it was about the same experience :) \n\n(Was planning on a trip report too soon but haven't had time yet) :D",

Everybody cares a lot about how they are viewed and wouldn\u2019t want to stand out (as a thief etc). This also brings shame to the family... socialization here is pretty strong. No one wants to be an outcast. Everyone that is native to Japan has the same general understanding of what is socially acceptable and what is not, hence the benefit of the doubt is given to everybody based on the mutual understanding that everybody is raised/educated on the same principles. That\u2019s a generalized conclusion based on elementary/intermediate knowledge of Japanese society.",

So it can definitely be a case-by-case thing, but I still would feel more optimistic about recovering a lost item here than back home.",

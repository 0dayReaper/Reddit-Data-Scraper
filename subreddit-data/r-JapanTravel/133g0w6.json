                    "comment": "Sure, I was going to write-up a trip report, but that may be delayed so here's our feedback on food portion of the trip. Google reviews sorting by date and looking for halal tags (not Yelp) and Halal Gourmet Japan were super useful. Aside from the restaurants below, Google Translate was super helpful in finding options at the combenis (7/11 and Lawsons), such as egg sandwiches. I would definitely suggest having a sim card to make restaurant reservations yourself directly if you're hotel cannot make them for you.\n\n\n**Ramen**: we've had this a total of 5x times: once at Ayam-ya Tokyo and Ayam-ya Koyoto, and 3x times at Honolu Shinjukugyoenmae Halal Ramen. All were delicious, but be warned that the spicy options were spicy. My wife like the Ayam locations better (the taste), but I preferred the Honolu and their fried chicken. What I really enjoyed at Honolu were their chicken -- fried very good, and not batter-y like Ayam's. I believe there was ramen at Odaiba at SOJIBO, but we ended up just eating some desserts there instead (banana smoothie and crepes). Honolu was my favorite place from this whole list.\n\n\n**Seafood**: Asakusa Sushi Ken - We were able to walk-in during lunch time, dinner is open for reservations. We got two of the lunch sets. Both of us unfortunately did not enjoy this sushi's flavor as much -- felt that the texture was too dense/tough. I think we're too used to American style-sushi which comes in fried and saucy variations. We enjoyed the tuna sushi at Tsujiki outer market and black cod. On our train ride to Kyoto, I had unagi bento and I thought was okay; but then we also had a grilled makeral bento, which was really good.  We also had a takoyaki a couple of times, and made sure to avoid the options with toppings such as bacon.\n\n\n**Yakiniku**: we got lucky @ Wagyu Yakiniku Panga on a rainy afternoon, and was able to get a seat without reservation at store open - it was only an hour window, which was enough for one set of premium wagyu. My wife really enjoyed the wagyu beef she cooked and attested the how buttery the meat was. I may have cooked my beef well-done, and I thought it was just okay. I enjoyed the yakiniku @ GYUMON (walked in without reservation on a rainy night, but they also suggest making those) much more, which with cheaper cuts of meat, came out okay as I also ended up with well-done beef (I guess I'm not good at cooking). There was a third yakiniku place in Shinjuku / Koreatown area we had an option of dining in while walking around - I don't recall the name, but we opted out for a nearby Subway instead. \n\n**Okonomiyaki**: We tried getting some of the vegetarian options at Zen restaurant in Shinjuku, however we got there late to the point of when they were accepting reservations only and could not dine in.\n\n**MOS Burger** in Ginza after a Tendon Itsuka's line was too long: MCDonald's shrimp burger is fried in the same oil with beef fat, so we couldn't try that. But my wife tried MOS burger's shrimp burger instead, and she enjoyed it. I had a Green burger with terimayo sauce, and it was okay. The atmosphere was really nice and worth experience for a fast food restaurant.\n\n\n**Curry @ Yoshiya Arashiyama**: I had beef curry and my wife had chicken curry, along with splitting a shrimp tempura udon bowl. Beef curry had few pieces of meat, but the curry + rice was a good mix. The Chicken curry in comparison had a much larger piece of chicken katsu, and my wife enjoyed it. Overall, the curries were good, but I feel the japanese curry that my wife can make from the grocery store boxes comes out better by adding in more spice. Shrimp tempura udon was refreshing. We also had their honey lemon soda drink, and it was very refreshing and my favorite drink from the trip. I don't recall seeing any other halal curry options, although Odaiba might have had some.\n\n**Mabrur Halal @ Kyoto**: very good south Asian food in the middle of the trip that also has Mediterranean kebabs as an option. I had a set of South Asian curry and my wife had a set of Mediterranean kebabs\n\n**Kebabs (Turkish)**: we found many halal kebab places without needing to search too hard. We'd have kebabs a total of 3x times aside from Mabrur - Akibahara, near Shibuya crossing, and HND airport.",

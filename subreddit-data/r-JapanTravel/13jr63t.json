    "postText": "I am planning to visit Ginzan Onsen on December 31, 2023. I'm trying to figure out what my options are to get from Tokyo to Ginzan Onsen. I will take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Oishida Station. Based on what I can find for bus availability from Oishida Station to Ginzan Onsen, this route bus does not run between 12/31 to 1/3 (can anyone confirm otherwise?). Source: http://www.hanagasa-bus-taisei.co.jp/base.html.\n\nDoes anyone know if there are other options to go from Oishida Station (or somewhere nearby) to Ginzan Onsen?Will taxis be available and willing to drive to Ginzan Onsen at this time of the year?",

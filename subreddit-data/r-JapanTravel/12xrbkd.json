    "postText": "Hey friends, I'd like to get a sense check on this planned 10-day itinerary for my honeymoon trip with my wife. I've been to Japan a few times, but this would be her first time. Let me know if y'all have any suggestions (e.g. food or attractions) or concerns (e.g. not enough time or factors I failed to consider).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* 15 May - arrival in Tokyo\n* 16 May - Izu peninsula\n* 17-18 May - Fuji Five Lakes area\n* 19 May - Kusatsu Onsen\n* 20 May - Nikko\n* 21-24 May - Tokyo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1 (Monday, 15 May):**\n\n* Arrival at Haneda Airport at 2245.\n* Check in at Miyako City Tokyo Takinawa, Shinagawa.\n* No plans except maybe just walk around near Shinagawa if we have energy. Then rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2 (Tuesday, 16 May):**\n\n* Rise early at 0700. Have breakfast. Check-out.\n* Then take shinkansen at around 0830 to Atami.\n* Park luggage in coin lockers, and then make our way to MOA Museum of Art.\n* Have lunch.\n* Rent a car at around 1300 (decision not made yet, but we are only renting a car after lunch (and not before MOA) because we want to return the car within 24 hours to avoid a surcharge).\n* Head to Coeda House and ACAO Forest for some coffee and photos.\n* Drive by the coast down to Ito.\n* Walk around Jogasaki Coast.\n* Mt. Omuro.\n* Check in at K's House Ito.\n* Dinner and chill for the rest of the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3 (Wednesday, 17 May):**\n\n* Rise early to catch a glimpse of the sunrise by the beach.\n* Breakfast and check-out.\n* Drive to Gotemba through the Izu Skyline and Ashinoko Pass, where I'll return the rented car by 1300.\n* Have lunch.\n* Head to Fuji Five Lakes area.\n   * Here is where I'll need some suggestions on whether I should rent another car for another day, or just use a bus pass like the Fujigoko Passport.\n* Check in at Hostel Saruya, Shimoyoshida.\n* Head to the Shibazakura Festival near Lake Motosu.\n* Thinking of one (or maybe two) more attractions to visit before we call it a day, maybe the Mt. Fuji Ropeway or Kubota Itchiku museum.\n* Dinner and chill for the rest of the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4 (Thursday, 18 May):**\n\n* Breakfast and check-out.\n* Visit Arakura Sengen Shrine / Chureito Pagoda.\n* Hongu Sengen Shrine.\n* Lunch.\n* Walk around the streets of Shimoyoshida (e.g. Honcho Street) and take photos of Fuji-san.\n* Check in at Konansou Fujikawaguchiko, then enjoy its facilities + dinner + rest for the evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5 (Friday, 19 May):**\n\n* Rise early at around 0700.

Stroll around.\n* TeamLabs Planets at 1100.\n* Unko Museum (we can skip this if it's underwhelming) at \\~1200.\n* Head to Harajuku/Shibuya area for the rest of the day:\n   * Takeshita Street\n   * Omotesando\n   * Meiji Jingu Shrine and the park\n   * Shibuya Crossing\n   * Shibuya SKY for golden hour\n   * Miyashita Park\n   * Shibuya Yokocho\n* Rest for the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9 (Tuesday 23 May):**\n\n* DisneySea.\n* Once we're done (around dinner time), head to Shimokitazawa for dinner and some thrift shopping.\n* Rest for the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 10 (Wednesday 24 May):**\n\n* Breakfast, check out of hotel, but store our luggage there.\n* Shinjuku Gyoen Park.\n* Head to Kichijoji:\n   * Sunroad Shopping district for shopping\n   * Inokashira Park\n   * Petit Mura Cafe\n   * Eat street food.\n* Generally just relax and walk around until dinner.\n* Head back to the hotel to collect our luggage.\n* Arrive at Haneda airport by 10PM for our 1145 flight out of Japan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it!\n\nWe would especially appreciate food suggestions (better if the food options are located near our itinerary locations). We like sushi, sashimi, ramen, beef, karaage, matcha, and ice cream, to name a few.\n\nAs for day plans, we are not sure about Day 10. We initially included a visit to the Ghibli Museum when we planned for Kichijoji, but turns out it's not open on that day. So we're open to change the plan for the whole day.\n\nWe're also aware that there's quite a bit of commute between Days 5-7, but it still looks doable. Let me know if otherwise.\n\nIf these additional context help:\n\n* I am 31, and she is 28;\n* we're both relatively fit and able to walk;\n* our main interests in Japan are sights, food, and onsen.\n* we like variety in our travels, hence the side trips out of Tokyo; and\n* we're planning to complete this trip with a combined budget of around 450k yen.\n\nLooking forward to reading your comments, and thank you in advance!",

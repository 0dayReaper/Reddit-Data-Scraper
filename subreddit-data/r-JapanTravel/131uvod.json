    "postText": "Hello! My fiance and I are very lucky to have 36 days to spend on our honeymoon trip in Japan. We will be going in mid/late Dec and leaving in late Jan. It'll be our first time in Japan and we'd like to check whether the itinerary is doable. We are in our late 20s and mid 30s, so we want a mix of exciting and relaxing days without burning out. We'd also love to allow some time for spontaneous exploration.\n\nI have put specific questions down with the itinerary. It isn't super detailed, again for the purpose of spontaneous exploration, but should be enough for us to hit some of the must-see spots. My main concern is during the new year period so your suggestions and recommendations are appreciated.\n\nThank you for your help!\n\n# - Tokyo part 1 -\n\nDAY 1     Wednesday, 20 Dec 2023     Arrival at Narita Airport\n\nArriving in the early morning &gt; Drop our luggage at the hotel at Shinjuku &gt; Explore the surroundings until early check-in time &gt; Rest until late afternoon &gt; Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for sunset &gt; Explore Shinjuku (Omoide Yokocho, Godzilla statue, Kabukicho, Golden Gai, Suehirotei etc.)\n\n**DAY 2     Thursday, 21 Dec 2023     Shibuya**\n\nMeiji Jingu &amp; Yoyogi Park first &gt; Explore the rest of Shibuya (Scramble Square, Shibuya Sky, Nonbei Yokocho, Center-Gai, Hachiko Memorial statue etc.)\n\n**DAY 3     Friday, 22 Dec 2023     Odaiba, Tsukiji, Ginza, Shimbashi**\n\nToyosu Market tuna auction (will try the lottery-based application for a closer look) &gt; Tsukiji Market &gt; Art Aquarium Museum via Ginza &gt; Rest until late afternoon &gt;  Toranomon Kotohiragu, Tokyo Tower via Shibakoen, Shimbashi\n\n**DAY 4     Saturday, 23 Dec 2023     Gotokuji**\n\nGotokuji Temple &gt; Explore the surroundings\n\n# - Hakone - \n\n**DAY 5     Sunday, 24 Dec 2023 (Christmas Eve)     Hakone**\n\nFrom Shinjuku to Hakone &gt; Ropeway to Owakudani &gt; Lake Ashi pirate ship &gt; Hakone Checkpoint &gt; Hakone Shrine &gt; Amazaka tea house\n\n`If it is a lot for one day we'll have some time the next day to explore before the main activity.

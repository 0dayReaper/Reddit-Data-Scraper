    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nMy wife and I (early 30's) will be returning to Japan (4th time) and we have 4 days and 3 nights of our trip to spend at/around Nagano which will be the base. We have not been to this area before and are saving another trip for Kanazawa/Takayama/Shirakawa-go. We will be coming from and returning to Tokyo.\n\nThe dates will be June 28 - July 1st. Currently this is what we have in mind:\n\n**June 28th (Wed):** Arrive in Nagano in the morning(from Tokyo)\n\n- Have decided against visiting Jigokudani Yaen Koen given the season.\n- Considering a trip to Karuizawa Shiraito Falls +/- Usui pass observation platform if time, any idea whether this is feasible in the one day?\n\n**June 29th (Thur):** Day trip to Mt Tate.\n\n- Looks like most of the snow will be gone which is fine, has anyone been there around this time of year?\n\n**June 30th (Fri):** Matsumoto day trip. \n\n- Visiting Matsumoto castle, Kasamori Inari Shrine, Nawate St, Nakamachi St. \nWas thinking of making this a half-day trip and visiting either Taisho Ike Pond or Narai-juku (bit closer, 45min each way from Matsumoto)\n\n**July 1st (Sat):** Day trip to Hakuba/Happo pond (return to Tokyo at night)\n\n- Looks like the gondola opens on July 1st. Couldn't find much info on what it will be like during this time of year though. Pictures in summer seem nice though.\n\nUnfortunately the above plan requires decent travel time from Nagano. How would you organise these 4 days? Any other places in the area to recommend? Open to moving the base from Nagano for the 3 nights but seems convenient given proximity to Tokyo and I imagine will have the best night life in the region (as we will be spending the evenings here each day).\n\nThanks!",

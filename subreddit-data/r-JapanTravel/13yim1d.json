    "postText": "Traveling in mid July (It's probably going to be hot) for our honeymoon. My partner and I have a list of things to do but will mostly let the day take us wherever it may go. We kind of like self exploration but any suggestions and improvements to the given schedule are very welcome!\n\nOur interests include:\n\nFood\n\nAnime\n\nGames\n\nAnimals (Partner loves cats)\n\nWe split Tokyo into two stays. The first stay focuses on exploration and the return trip is chill/shopping. This is mainly to account for wanting to be in Kyoto during the Gion festival.\n\nWe were also thinking of just buying most of our clothes in Japan - Good/Bad idea? Would save room in the suitcase if we were already planning on buying\n\n|Hotel Stay|Planned Activities|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tokyo (Near Shibuya) \\[Tues - July 11\\]|Arrive around 2pm at Haneda, explore a bit around the hotel in Shibuya|Mostly free time to fight jet lag.

We aren't into things like Universal (a little too busy for us), reason we didn't book any big theme parks.\n\nDoes this List look viable, is it too full/not full enough?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\\*Fixed formatting",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI hope this is OK to post.  I just wanted to say, you don't have to go to Osaka at all if you don't think it will interest you, and it's OK if you don't!  Not everyone likes everywhere in Japan equally.  You can also get to most places in Osaka from most places in Kyoto in about 1 hour, so you can stay in Kyoto if you think that is more of your interest, or stay in Nara even.\n\nSo I would make sure the Monster Hunter Cafe is on.  I know that a lot of themed cafes are temporary and change out on a fairly regular basis.  I know the Capcom Cafe has had at least 3 different themes since I was in Japan in December.  There are Capcom stores as well.\n\nI like Hakone, but be prepared to not see Mt. Fuji.  June, July and August have the worst probability of seeing Mt. Fuji with all the humidity.  I personally still like Hakone, but make sure you are OK with not seeing it there.\n\nI think some of your days are empty, but generally you are also likely to find things while in Japan.\n\nKiyomizudera is South Kyoto.  What else you see sort of depends on interests.  There are a lot of temples just into the hills on the other side of the Kamo River.  \n\nIf you like easy hikes and nature, you can look into Enryakuji and Kurama.  Both are in the mountains surrounding Kyoto.\n\nI would think you could do more than the bamboo forest and the monkey park.  Arashiyama is a nice area though, so there is plenty to do there from Tenryuji to souvenir shops.\n\nIf your partner likes cats they should look into whether you can fit in a rescue cat cafe in Tokyo or Osaka.  Make sure you specifically look for a rescue one, as otherwise I think the cats do not necessarily live under the best conditions.\n\nIn terms of buying clothes, it sort of depends on your sizes?  If you're tall, heavier or have a large bust, you might find finding clothes in Japan a chore.  I tend to send my bags about via TaQbin.  So for my next trip I plan to send my bags from Tokyo to Kyoto and just take a small bag and my daughter's violin to Hakone.  I plan to arrive in Hakone early enough to use their same day transport to get my bags to my hotel, or just go there from the start.  \n\nI have been using TakQbin on  my trips to Japan over almost 2 decades.  I've yet to have my bags lost or even really delayed.  My last trip, my hotel in Tokyo accidentally sent my bags to the Park Hyatt in Kyoto when we were staying in the Hyatt Regency.  They called me up right away about the issue and the hotels sorted everything out without me having to do anything.  By the time I made it back to Hyatt after sightseeing my bag was there.  In that 2 decade period I have had the airlines misplace my suitcase for several days and then damage the bag so badly it was not useable anymore.  I've also had multiple luggage delays where it took a little while for my bags to arrive but they all arrived eventually.  So TakQbin has been overall more reliable than the airlines.\n\nI hope this helps!",

Also knowing that you've used the luggage transport is super reassuring. \n\nI wouldn't have thought of rescue specific cafes vs regular ones as well... That's a really good point!\n\nOsaka is a very food oriented place from what I hear... But I can't eat all day haha, that's why I feel as if I didn't have enough planned.\n\nThank you once again this is really valuable feedback :)",

                            "comment": "Osaka has a few rescue cat cafes.  \n\nI have not been to them but...\n\n[http://neu-catcafe.com/](http://neu-catcafe.com/)\n\nand\n\n[https://www.savecatcafe.net/](https://www.savecatcafe.net/)\n\nYou can generally tell if a cat cafe is also a rescue if the cats are not just kittens and they talk about fostering or adoption.  \n\nOr make it clear the cats have to want to come you, you can't just go bothering them.\n\nAgain, if you're just going to Osaka to eat, you can still stay somewhere else.  I tend to prefer staying in Kyoto.  I think Osaka has lower prices on 5 star hotels and lower prices for cheap hotels, but for that more medium level, I think you get a nicer room that is more convenient and larger in Kyoto than Osaka, does that make sense?\n\nI have a friend who lives/works in Osaka and I travel from Kyoto to Osaka to see them all the time.  I think we're going to spend one day seeing Osaka and that is mostly going to be shopping and an maybe a fancy afternoon tea.  We did one at the Ritz in December and we loved it.  They're sort of themed, but in general the food is better than at actual themed cafes.  If the Monster Hunter one is done, some of the leftover merch will be around at the Cafes.    My tween was meh on the aquarium.  She liked the local one near where we use to live better and I have to admit, I preferred the one in Long Beach.  \n\nI've had good luck with luggage delivery.  just make sure you check the dates so you know when it is actually arriving.  I had that problem in December.  I thought my luggage was delayed, but it came the date it was supposed.  I just expected it to come earlier.  Right now, it's generally taking 2 days.  There is same day luggage delivery in Hakone to most ryokan and hotels.  You just need to get there by noon.\n\n[https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/station/yumoto](https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/station/yumoto)\n\nI've never used the delivery back to the station.  My trains tend to leave too early.  I  think I stayed at the Hakone Kowakien in its previous life, because I remember staying super close to Yunessun one trip to Hakone.  I wouldn't want to have luggage going to that area unless you hop on one of the highway buses not included in the Free Pass, but you can just walk all down hill to Kowakidani Station.  At leas one bus from Moto-Hakone goes right past Yunessun I am 99% sure, so you won't have to go back to Hakone-Yumoto, if you do the loop.  I've gone in June, but it definitely cooled off enough at night (and in the morning) to use the onsen.  \n\nMy tween loves Yunessun, because she is now too shy to go in real onsen.  \n\nI'm sure you will have a great trip!",

A close friend and myself are taking our first trip to Japan / Taiwan this fall and will be in Japan for approximately a month.  We are both extremely well traveled and had never even heard of any service like this elsewhere\u2026until we started researching this trip.  \n\nIs there something unique or perhaps uniquely challenging about traveling in Japan that makes this an extra appealing option??   I guess it just strikes me as a solution looking for a problem, especially considering that train stations generally all have lockers to facilitate shorter stopovers etc.  Thanks in advance for any enlightenment!!",

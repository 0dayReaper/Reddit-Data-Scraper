    "postText": "Hey yall, thought I'd condense my thoughts in a single post rather than sprinkle information here and there all over this sub. My housemate and I did a massive 18 day all-Japan trip in March to satisfy my midlife crisis, and while I didn't post an itinerary or anything, I did ask a few questions and got good answers to help us with minor issues, so I'm going to try to pay it forward. Most of this will be recommendations and positives, with a few negatives, but I'm also aware that what worked or didn't work for us may be different for people with different interests, budgets, etc. We just went through our 1500 photos with an interested friend, so it's as good a time as any.\n\nFor reference, we started in Osaka, and then went to Hiroshima, Miyajima, Kumamoto, back to Kyoto, then Matsumoto, Nagano, Ueda, Bessho Onsen, Sendai, and ended in Tokyo. 18 days on a 14 day JR Pass, totally worth it. Primary interests were Sengoku-period history and food, with a side of very specific anime/manga die-hard fandoms (One Piece and Sailor Moon).\n\nRecommending:  \n\\- Dotonbori/Nanba area of Osaka. Totally worth it if you're a fan of good food and the real Osaka vibe. I found Osaka to be more laid-back and fun than Tokyo, and the Namba area generally easy to navigate, including to get connections to see the rest of Osaka. Our tiny room at the Vessel Inn Namba was a block from Dotonbori proper, absolutely do recommend. For food, try to hit the satellite locations of major Dotonbori brands that are just off the strip, the lines will be shorter and the food is just as good.\n\n\\- Miyajima. Just. GOD. It feels slightly touristy but in a good way, like everyone knows why they're here and no one is weird about it. Absolutely recommend staying on the island instead of day-tripping; if you're going to splurge on a ryokan experience, this is the place to do it. Props to Hotel Makoto for being an absolute delight, would stay there again in a heartbeat. Staying on the island leaves you with more time to explore the shrines and temples (for the historically-minded, Itsukushima is more than just a torii that sits in the water at high tide) as well as the omotesando, though you do want to leave room for your ryokan meal. Being able to hit the shops and cafes in the morning before the tourist hordes descend is also worth it. The highlight of my trip was overhearing a skilled obaasan telling her tour group the history of Itsukushima and the Taira clan in a classical sing-song lecturing manner, late at night, and then having a deer come up and sniff me while I walked the empty, silent streets in my hotel yukata.\n\n\\- being a little flexible. I know a small segment of people need to be rigidly scheduled but for the rest of us, playing things by ear and building a little padding into your schedule allows you to roll with the punches. It's raining? Great time to sight-see in Kyoto because the big tour groups that clog Sannenzaka will vanish! You didn't need 2 hours to tour a museum and can catch an earlier train? Great, now you have more time to explore the place you thought you could only cram in by being harsher with your schedule. Google \"coffee near me\" sure, Cafe Arrow is on the way to the castle, that sounds fine...wait what is this strange and magical little place run by an elderly man who has to be the embodiment of the owl who runs the cafe in Animal Crossing? WHAT IS THIS MAGIC? You will have unforgettable experiences of a lifetime if you're willing to do something that isn't literally dicated to you by someone's blog or youtube channel.\n\n\\- planning for YOU. Ask yourself: why am I going to Japan? What do I really want to do and see? What experiences am I craving? Plan your trip for YOU, not to check off some blog's checklist. My interest is Sengoku-period history, so I specifically chose temples, castles, and locations important to certain historical figures: the Sanada at Ueda, Date Masamune in Sendai, Toyotomi and Oda in Kyoto and Osaka, and the Hojo at Odawara. Completely worth it. In some cases, I found extremely hidden treasures - seeing Mori Ranmaru's actual blades at the museum next to Honnoji, experiencing the brief opening of Date's shrine at Zuihoden (in the snow, no less), strolling casually through the beautiful bamboo grove at Kodaiji (that is, I might say, better than Arashiyama), enjoying the vibe in Ueda where they really really love their Sanadas. Whatever your interests are, cater to them. Don't do what everyone else does just because everyone else does it, do what YOU want to do. Skip things that appear on every youtube \"top 20 things to do in Tokyo\" list because they don't appeal to you. This is YOUR trip, and you're the only one who's going to remember these experiences.\n\n\\- shinkansen. God, I love the train system in Japan and I will die mad that we don't have anything like it in the US. I can wax poetic about the shinkansen all day so ask me if you want specifics - we took JR trains from Osaka to Hiroshima to Kumamoto to Kyoto to Matsumoto to Nagano to Saitama to Sendai to Tokyo. We milked those JR Passes for all their worth and then some, our final day we used it to go out to Odawara to see the castle and the ocean (WORTH IT) and then back to shop Shibuya before heading back to our hotel.\n\n\\- luggage forwarding. We lived large thanks to takkyubin! Our first experience was stressful because we thought we had to do it through an office at a train station which was never open when we needed it, but then we checked online and decided to ask our hotel if they knew anything about it. Hotel clerk handed us the forms on the spot. From then on we checked at the hotel first, and every single time, they could do it, so we never had to do it at a konbini or train station. We had an enormous suitcase that was barely 3-5cm under the limit depending on how the person filling out the form measured it, so forwarding it from city to city, especially with 1-2 day flexibility during our onsen/ryokan stays, was totally worth the extra cost. We paid maybe $35 at most shipping 2 bags place to place, and even with our laundry day budget in Nagano we made the most of takkyubin. Highly recommend for long trips and multiple city stops, it's easier than trying to lug bags around, find coin lockers, etc.\n\n\\- konbini. Do it. Just. Do it. My favorite thing about Japan after the trains. Wish we had anything so fun. That, and IC cards in general. Thanks to the yen/dollar we were getting 100Y for about 78 dollars every day, and our Visa debit cards from our local credit union worked just fine at 7-11. I already miss melonpan.\n\n\\- THE FOOD. OH MY GOD THE FOOD. I don't have enough space to tell you about all the amazing food we had. The best non-ryokan kaiseki/set meal we had was at Calf in Kyoto, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves on a Sunday evening and it was worth every pretty penny. I have a weird soy allergy (a medication issue, pure soy protein is no but shoyu and soy lecithin is ok) and with allergy cards and limited Japanese, I was able to communicate my issue where needed and simply avoid trouble where I had control over ordering. That said, everything was amazing and I wanted to try all of it. I cook regularly at home and have cooked a lot of Japanese recipes, so I wanted to compare to the \"real thing\" while also having unique experiences for local specialties. The ramen in Kumamoto is to die for and gyutan in Sendai is everything they say it should be. Okonomiyaki, yes. Oden, yes. Early spring is strawberry season in Japan so I made sure to try every strawberry dessert I could find and would die happy if my last meal was that parfait I had on White Day in Kyoto. Also, Nagano/Ueda is apple country and I did not have a single disappointing apple-related food.\n\n\\- Do a onsen if you have the time and budget. I chose Bessho Onsen in Ueda thanks to location and our schedule and was honestly not disappointed - it's an under-sung location and March was their off-season between Nagano ski winters and regular summer, so it was very quiet and charming. Less pretty than, say, Kinosaki, but still everything you want out of an onsen - gorgeous ryokan (special shout-out to Tamaya Ryokan, AMAZING bath, amenties, and meal), quaint local restaurants and bars, incredible public baths and footbaths, and a little history and culture too.\n\nThings I do NOT recommend:  \n\\- Uncle Rikuro's cheesecake. there, I said it. It's not cheesecake. It's an egg souffle, and it tastes VERY eggy, like eating very aerated omelete. It wasn't even sugary! I'm from the midwest, I KNOW cheesecake, and there was zero cheese in this cake. I appreciate being able to taste-test the texture but I also know that this is one Japanese recipe I will never re-create. Ugh.\n\n\\- Kura sushi. Of the conveyor belt sushi chains, I found it pretty bad. Sushiro was better. I'm sure if I'd taken the time to look up non-chain options I'd have had even better but...eh. Sometimes you're just hungry for sushi and don't want to work for it. And then you regret it.\n\n\\- standing in line longer than 15-20 minutes for anything. That includes shops - we waited in a line to get into the Mugiwara flagship store at Magnet Shibuya and it was a waste of my entire life. So much disappointment, the merch was pathetic and jacked up in price, I found some of the same items for resale at Book-Off for 1/3 the cost. I stood in line for takoyaki and that was worth it, but I picked a place that had a short line versus a place with an hour-long-plus line a block over. A line doesn't necessarilly mean whatever is there is worth it, it just means it's been hyped, and we all know that hype isn't automatically worth it. In terms of attractions...I don't know, man, we had the most impeccable timing and never waited in line for a single castle or museum. Either we missed the crowds by mere minutes or we went places that didn't have lines. Lucky us?\n\n\\- Animate and Mandarake. For anime/manga shoppers, anything you do in Tokyo is not about the store so much as it's about the series you're into. Animate is great if you're into only whatever is hot, new, and now (and/or idol mobage), Mandarake is fine if you're into very specific niches like kaiju movies, sentai shows, or shojo pinups, but it's a lot harder to navigate for older, obscure shows and games. Even KBooks gave us trouble because of its utter lack of organization. We're into slightly older properties like Saiyuki and Kyou Kara Maou, so we had a hard time finding anything except in Book-Off. Book-Off was our saviour! That said, we stumbled into a Koei popup as well as an unexpected Final Fantasy anniversary store in Shibuya Parco, so if you're lucky you'll find exactly what you want when you want it without even trying. Better places for nerd shopping: literally any Book-Off and/or Hard-Off, Yodobashi Camera, Tokyu Hands.\n\n\\- Tokyo in general. Honestly, I did not like Tokyo. We had already done a million temples and shrines so Meiji wasn't interesting to us, so we really didn't find much to do there besides shop - which was why we scheduled it for last, but after the glorious, magical experiences we had from Kumamoto to Sendai, Tokyo was legit a let-down. We're not city people, so it was just A Big Loud City and thus, not that interesting. Ikebukuro catered to some of our interests but Sunshine City was boring, and Nakano Broadway was weird and off-putting aside from the basement-level kimono seller. That said, we did have a great day at Nippori Textile Town and bought way too much fabric and trim to fit in our suitcases. On the other hand, reports that Harajuku is a sad shell of what it used to be 20 years ago are correct. We couldn't make time to get to Shimokitazawa so that would be my only real regret.\n\nOverall, we had very few negative experiences (that weren't due to our lack of planning or just being a stupid hangry idiot) and I'll even say that the one day it snowed - on top of Aoba-yama in Sendai, but only on top of the mountain - wasn't that bad. We're from the midwest so March is usually pretty snowy, we were prepared with gloves, scarves, coats, and umbrellas. The main thing I had to keep telling myself, and is valuable for other travelers, is that: you're in a country very like your own. It may not feel like it sometimes, but it's more like home than not. You can go out to a drugstore or konbini if you run out of something or forgot something. A belt, an umbrella, more ibuprofin, etc. It wasn't like a resort vacation or a convention where I'm trapped in a hotel, this is a real place where people are living their lives. That said, speaking a little Japanese helped, as did google translate with the photo function as well as speaking into the mic - our server at Tamaya Ryokan LOVED being able to speak into my friend's phone and insta-translate. Speaking enough Japanese to order food, ask simple questions, and understand the answers got us a lot further than knowing nothing. Not saying it's a requirement, but it definitely helped me make a new friend in front of the Luffy statue in Kumamoto...\n\nOpen to offering specific hotel and restaurant recs in the cities we visited. I can't say enough about Calf in Kyoto, Tamaya Ryokan and Hotel Makoto, and Nakara in Nagano, oh and the Chion-in Wajun Kaikan in Kyoto that I booked because it had Japanese-style rooms only to show up and find out that it was a classy ryokan connected to Chion-in Temple that was way too good for a couple of wisconsinites who live in jeans and t-shirts...",

I plan to go to the Kura in Asakusa after we land in Tokyo because I think we'll be exhausted but unable to get into our hotel, so it seems like a spacious and low-stress option. I could be horribly wrong!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;planning for YOU. Ask yourself: why am I going to Japan? What do I really want to do and see? What experiences am I craving?

I've made so many revisions to my itinerary because I realised I was planning things I thought I *should* do rather than the things I wanted to do. It seems so obvious, but I think it's definitely a mistake many people will make.",

Tokyo, to me, was the kind of city where yeah, I can see people spending a lot of time there just looking around and eating food, or if you're a hardcore shopper. If you're like us and aren't that into department stores and luxury goods, definitely pick out specific sights to see - e.g. an observaton deck (Skytree is $$$ but the Metropolitan building is free, there's a new one in Shinjuku too), the imperial garden, pop-up cafes, concerts, etc. That way, you can still get something out of Tokyo without being all omg it's so big and there's so much. Having specific places to go helped a lot, because we could then say, oh, those three are all close together so we can do that one morning/afternoon and then it's done.",

One day to explore Akihabara for the nerd stuff like window shopping and FFXIV caf\u00e9 etc. Other than that the only things we want to do in Tokyo is things we can\u2019t do elsewere like explore Shibuya, Shinjuku, Odaiba and Sensouji plus a day trip to Hakone. We have a few specific places to go to and they are mainly in these areas. Food and bars we\u2019ll probably focus on in Osaka and Kyoto so maybe we wont have as many items left on our massive must eat list once we are in Tokyo. But parks and gardens will probably take quite alot of that time both for picknicks and to escape crowds/summer heat.\n\nIt will be at the end of our trip too so we can leave the rest of our trip for Kyoto/Osaka and Kinosaki. We have almost 15 days in Japan (excluding arrival day since it is 7 pm), currently we are shifting between 4.5-5.5 days in Tokyo with the day trip. How many days did you spend there and how many would you go if you could redo it?",

I think, if we weren't spreading out our shopping and tried to jam it all into fuller days in Tokyo, 16 would have been a more perfect amount. I don't regret the extra time, but we both sort of agreed that it was maybe 1-2 days too much. That said, I was super burnt out on shopping after Ikebukuro, possibly because it was spring equinox and thus a lot of people were off from school - the place was full of teenagers and there was even an ita-bag trinket trading party going on in the park where the Animate Cafe is. So if I did anything different it would have been noting that a holiday is just as bad as a weekend for crowds.",

There was an entire shop for super retro stuff from the 60s and earlier, but we had a hard time finding much for the \"older\" 90s shonen animes we cut our teeth on. That went for almost everywhere - if it wasn't as massively popular as Sailor Moon or One Piece, and is older than last year, it was pretty tough to find good merch even in hubs like Jump stores and Capcom. Not impossible, but the selection was a lot smaller and less cool.\n\nSo yeah, super old school? Mandarake's retro shop on the um. 4th? 5th? floor? It was way up there. That'll serve you well. 90's/early 00s, you probably want to pivot to Book Off, which is like Goodwill for books/CDs/character goods.\n\nAnyway the off-putting part was that the mall is this weird, claustrophobic labyrinth of low-ceilinged hallways where the 800 Mandarake separate specialty stores are mixed with a disturbing amount of luxury watch retailers. The basement was pretty cool though, there was a whole grocery store, a tea seller with excellent authentic tools, and a used kimono dealer that could have bankrupted us if I didn't already own 12 kimonos at home. I guess it depends on what you're really looking for.",

I wanted to see the castle as well, because the city really relies on tourism and is going to have to foot a large bill to restore it (even after Oda's donation), and they have One Piece souveniers commemorating Oda's promotion for the castle restoration too, so bonus!\n\nI wanted to see more than just Luffy but most of the crew are way far out, Jinbei's at the sea coast and Zoro's up by the historical sites related to Miyamoto Musashi (naturally) but most of them definitely require a car to get to. The next closest was Chopper at the zoo but we were so tired thanks to the heat that we decided to skip it. I'd say, if you're a super hardcore OP fan, you'll kick yourself if you don't spend at least one day in Kumamoto - and if you're going to anywhere like Hiroshima, the shinkansen ride is only like 90 minutes from there I think. Since the closing of the OP museum at Tokyo Tower, there really isn't anything else OP-related to see besides Kumamoto.",

                    "comment": "In larger cities you almost can't go wrong, though you want to balance reviews against what amenites you actually need/want - always check room size and not just number/type of beds. I booked everything through JapanICan (which is Agoda) and most listings have square footage, and photos are pretty accurate for when it's just one tiny twin bed crammed into a 400sqft closet. We had a good time at Vessel Inn in Osaka, even though the room was tiny (our two beds formed a giant bed alcove and it amused us) and the Sotetsu Fresa chain, primarily around Nagano and the Tohoku region, was really good. We had no bad experiences, mainly because I was very careful about room size and bed sizes before pulling any triggers. Double/triple check those, as well as location compared to the sites you most want to see, and you won't have problems. Don't be surprised when many of them have their actual front desk/lobby on another floor - Vessel Inn was 2nd floor, I think the Sotetsu Fresa was 5th floor. Elevators go all the way up so your elderly father won't have problems. Location may matter for him, if he doesn't want to walk a block every time a taxi drops him off because they can't find a hotel on a side alley with a barely-marked entrance.\n\nThe other thing you want to double/triple-check is, if you want to experience more traditional lodging, whether any of the places that look nice have unusual bathroom/shower situations. We never ran into that but I also was less diligent about double-checking so we might have just lucked out. Most ryokans have absolutely luxurious bathrooms as well as their private baths, but I did see a few minshuku and much older places pop up as having communal bathrooms in smaller towns, remote neighborhoods, etc.\n\nWe had perfectly decent experiences everywhere from a Comfort Hotel in Kumamoto (aside from a bar across the street that played the same three Journey songs all night) to the Kadoya Hotel in Shinjuku, Tokyo, amenities are pretty much the same across the board and all of them did takkyubin luggage forwarding if you need that service. Of the three ryokan we stayed in, we ranked them Tamaya in Bessho Onsen #1 for the experience, Hotel Makoto on Miyajima #2 (amazing, just couldn't beat an onsen for the top spot), and the Chion-in Wajun Kaikan in Kyoto #3, it wasn't bad at all but my other half did not sleep as well on the futons they had compared to the onsens. Japanese-style room might be rough on your father but the girls might love it, so if you find places like Wajun Kaikan that have both Japanese and Western rooms next to each other, or even mixed rooms, that allows people to have the experience they want. Given that I've stayed in A LOT of American hotels due to my work/hobby life as a cosplayer going to conventions, I have experienced a ton of mediocre, passable hotels. Every hotel in Japan was just better overall. You won't have problems at a Comfort, a Vessel, a Fresa, etc. I would only personally avoid APA hotels just because of moral reasons, the owner is a religious cultist so I didn't want any of my tourist money going to her interest.",

We wanted to get to at least three statues but only managed one, they're a lot further apart than I had expected. Oh well.\n\nI definitely adored the magical experience of finding Cafe Arrow a few blocks from our hotel, it was an unexpected stop. We just wanted coffee and a moment to get out of the heat (it was 70+ that day) and stumbled into a teensy tiny coffee parlor run by an elderly man who will sell you bags of coffee beans at the drop of a hat. No menu, just him making pour-over coffee from a delicious amber roast, we definitely bought a bag of beans and got them home safely. For ramen, you can't go wrong with almost anywhere touting \"Kumamoto ramen\" but we ended up at the Ajisen flagship location next to the prefectural office (and uh, the Luffy statue) and it was incredible. Do take time to visit the castle and the touristy castle-town shopping area next to it, if only because Kumamoto is working hard to recover from the earthquake and the damage to the castle is going to take 20 years to fully restore - they can use the tourist dollars. There are some cute shops to get trinkets and unusual snacks in the shopping area, but also some super delicious ice cream places. On a slightly-warm day, they're a godsend.\n\nFor transportation I suggest the bus lines over the tram; we had troubles getting the tram to accept our IC cards and it only goes on a loop, while the buses are more consistent (although the depot underneath the Sakura mall is kind of...weird? If you're not used to public transportation).",

Or, hit up a dessert cafe - I could have packed on an extra 20 lbs just grabbing one of everything in some of the dessert places that were open late. Cakes, parfaits, tarts, etc. We lucked into some unique baked goods in Sendai that had actual sakura cherries inside the chocolate!",

Tokyo is full of small, quiet cafes of all different types\u2014 retro \u201ckissaten,\u201d chic little garden cafes, hipster coffee houses, etc. Grab a drink, bring a book, sit and people watch. \n\nI also love smaller museums to get away from the hustle and bustle. Nezu Museum (and it\u2019s gardens) is a lovely little spot, and the Idemitsu has a great view of the palace grounds. I also love Ota Memorial Museum when you need a break from Harajuku\u2019s noise. \n\nMy other recommendation is browsing for books in Jinbocho. Full of old, second hand and specialty bookstores. Pair it with a small cafe (such as Milonga), and I\u2019m in my happy place!",

Between the two of us we had a total of 4 suitcases, so we forwarded/cross-packed 2 or 3 and only traveled on trains with one mid-sized carryon that held 2-3 days of clothes for both of us. Almost all luggage I saw fit easily on shinkansens and Japanese people are in love with wheeled carryons instead of backpacks, so you'll be in good company.",

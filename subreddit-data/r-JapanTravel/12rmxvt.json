    "postText": "Planning my upcoming mid-May trip to Tokyo, I would like to run my ideas through you. I have a few extra days in between two appointments in Tokyo and want to go camping. I will be relying on public transport and hitchhiking. I have all gear and won't need to rent anything. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n1. Day 1: take train to Kawakuchiko, then bus onto Lake Motosu, then hitchhike to Koan Camping Ground (I believe Mt Fuji is visible from the camp)\n2. Day 2: rest at camp\n3. Day 3: hitchhike to Kofu, then take train to Okutama, walk to Hikawa Camp Site\n4. Day 4: rest at camp, visit nearby onsen\n5. Day 5: take the train back to Tokyo\n\n* Does this sound feasible to you?\n* Are these places I picked quiet? I heard camping in Japan can be quite a social crowd, but I'm looking for peace and quiet in nature only. Happy to chat with a couple of friendly neighbors, but I'm not looking to join the same crowds I'm escaping from in Tokyo.\n* Is there any other nice campsite I should consider that's also accessible on my route?\n* Will I be able to recharge my phone etc?\n* Should I bring all food from Tokyo or will there be places nearby to restock? Or a restaurant? I don't plan on cooking, just mostly readymade stuff.\n* I usually prefer wild camping if possible in other countries. It seems wild camping isn't a typical thing in Japan. Is there any obvious wild camping possibility I'm missing? \n* Anything else I should consider?\n\nTIA!",

Not sure about the Fuji-san area though.\n\nHitchhikers only ask to share the same journey as the ride, not be chaffered around. If no ride is offered then tough luck, Japan wouldn't be the first country where that happens. It's not the end of the world.",

I'm concerned about available spots on the road to catch a ride, which would be a challenge if there are not a lot of places to stop. I usually don't mind it since I could easily pop my tent and sleep anywhere if I can't find a ride. However, wild camping doesn't seem to be a normal thing in JP.",

If you are near public access or if the landowners spot you, you would likely get reported to the police or asked to move instead. This is alongside the usual risk of Japan's wildlife where most of the country is bear country.\n\nHitchhiking is imposing upon the charity of the country you are visiting. The locals are nice, but if your primary plan of transport is to rely on other people, then that's selfish. As with most things in Japan, if you can't follow the rules or pay for services, then at the very least, don't cause trouble. The last thing we need is more signs around random roads saying No Camping and ruining the views because some people can't think beyond themselves.\n\nIf you know you are heading somewhere remote where public transport doesnt reach, then rent a bike or rent a car.",

My main problem is the primary plan of hitchhiking. Going to campsites and camping there is no problem and perfectly fine. The distance of his travels are not near either, so what if he doesnt actually get charity from someone? hike 43 KM with his gear from Lake Motosu to Kofu? Abandon his plans to visit Kofu? \n\nBecause of how yamanashi's public transport is allocated, one can also strongly consider renting a bike or a small car. He's going in spring weather, and the elevation of the places he's going to is not a problem for even the smallest of kei cars. It will be faster in time, he can get to wherever he needs if plans change, and it's safer for all parties.",

What you're saying about wild camping is explicitly what I'm planning to not do.\n\nHitchhiking is a very normal mean of transport in many different places in the world for both locals and tourists, especially outside of the US. In fact, on the Koan Camp Ground website, they give instructions on getting there by public transit requiring either walking or hitchhiking the last part, no other choice. It's also not that far to walk, may just an hour and a half. The real concern is the longer stretch is between Motosuko and Kofu, and yes if no ride is found then I'd pivot to Plan B. Indeed, it's very normal to change plans on the go when you hitchhike.\n\nThanks for the bear warning and advice to rent a vehicle, it's an option too but lower on the list of preferences.",

There are people who will do it regardless, and the worst that can happen is people will tell you to leave and go camp at proper campsites instead. Campsites are the designated sites made for the safety of the users and to keep random people from disturbing the nature of Japan as well as other landowners and the public.\n\nWhich is to say, wild camping is frowned upon by both local ordinance and the locals. Unfortunately depending on season and holiday it may get very packed in campsites.\n\nI have a negative stance on hitchhiking as a tourist as a primary plan anyways but that's just my view. Begpackers and people who don't contribute to the local economy is another topic I would rather not discuss here.",

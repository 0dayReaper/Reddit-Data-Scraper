You can take the Shinkansen to Osaka, so no need to stay there overnight. Or take four days in one other area, like Kanazawa or Kurashiki or Onomichi. Shimanami Kaido could be done in 3 days.",

An Instagrammer recommended getting a vpn now and booking hotels as if you're doing it from Japan, I didn't do that but did cancel my bookings when I was already there and it did seem quite a bit cheaper.   \nRyokans are cute, but if you're above 5'10'', it just starts to feel a bit cramped after the first night. You will share toilets, showers, most of them have curfews (at least in Kyoto), I felt watched as the Ryokan owner greeted us every time we entered and left. My gf didn't like sleeping on the tatami mats, I didn't mind. Overall didn't regret it, but wouldn't do it again. Don't book one for over 3 nights imo.",

It's basically one giant mall/arcade, feels like the Vegas Strip in Japan, but there isn't much else to do after a few passes.  The Ghibli Store in Daimaru Dept Store is really great, as are the other similar stores (my wife and I didn't buy anything, but it's still fun to see).  Most of the happening parts of Osaka are covered, so I'd recommend finding your rainiest day in Kyoto and spending that one on an Osaka day trip.  Not much to do in Kyoto in the rain--the shrines are still crowded, only now with umbrellas taking up even more room.",

Definitely worth going for us since we planned to see the Monkey Park that was 15 min walk away. It was also lovely because the walk around this area is generally lovely (bridge view of a dam, shops and markets with yummy foods).\n\nIf there was a place overcrowded (in the first half mile or so) for social media it was Fushimi Inari shrine. But that\u2019s definitely worth walking through towards the top for views of Kyoto. 10,000 arches/gates!! Maybe the first 100 arches, it was so crowded with people taking photos. If you hike even further up, there\u2019s much less people because the hike is a bit more tedious (just steps and steps).\n\nIf there is one place that I\u2019d certainly avoid is paying to see the Garden (\u00a5200) at the Osaka Castle. It was basically a flat park with no actual garden. \n\nThe other must sees on my list was Tenryu-ji temple in Arashiyama. That had a beautiful garden and traditional temple house you could pay admission to go through.",

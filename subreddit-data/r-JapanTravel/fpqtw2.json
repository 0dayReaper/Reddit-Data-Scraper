    "postText": "Through all the recent events of cancelled flights, uncertain travel terms and people world wide needing to cancel or update plans - many who have been unsuccessful in obtaining full refunds or credits, I just wanted to praise ANA for their response during these times. \n\nWe were booked via an agent on the cheapest airfare possible, ANA rather than deflecting us to the travel agent we couldn't get in touch with offered an upfront full refund (not credit), however at the time we still decided to fly out. Once in Japan we had 6 amazing nights before our home country demanded people return home immediately, again after failing to get in touch with our travel agent we were able to talk to ANA at Haneda and they were able to change our return flights with no issues or hassles for no extra charge - they even asked which seats we would prefer!\n\nI hope that when the world returns to normal and we are all traveling again, that we make an effort to choose airlines that put the customer first and go above and beyond. I just wish my own countries major carrier (Qantas) had done similar, but my friends were not so lucky dealing with them.",

Waited on hold for 2.5 hours and finally got them on the phone and they refused to refund because it was after 24 hours. They even acknowledged they could see when the call was placed and that I attempted to contact them within the 24 hours but said their policy is that you have to complete the cancellation transaction within 24 hours. They said they would escalate it and contact me within 72 hours. A week later no contact, the flight has been cancelled, and there isn\u2019t even a record that it existed on the website.\n\nWorking with my credit card to reverse the charge, but they said it can take 30 days.",

My issue was the day I bought the ticket Japan issued a statement they would quarantine anyone coming from Korea. I\u2019m in Korea so it meant I couldn\u2019t go to Japan. When I explained this to the airline they stood by their no refund policy. \n\nKorea just issued policy to quarantine anyone coming in from America, I\u2019m betting Japan will, too.\n\nOverall, I\u2019ve elected to ride it out in Korea rather than go anywhere else.\n\nIt also means I will never fly Singapore Airlines and will actively advocate against them for life.

The customer service was outstanding, one of the women there translated in real time a phone call I had to make to another airline which was Japanese only!\n\nI will always fly with ANA whenever possible since then.",

I had no trouble getting a refund for my trip (03/29) and also had to cancel a domestic flight on 04/11 which at the time I cancelled wasn't included in the dates for free refund. I wrote a short mail asking them if they could refund the fee for that flight as well, since I had to cancel my earlier international flight, and they immediately agreed.\n\nThe confirmation email mentioned that the refund might take 1-2 months (paid by credit card) but the money was there less than a week later.\n\nWhen this whole thing is over and I can visit Japan I will defintely choose ANA again. It's also my 3rd time flying with them and the onboard experience so far has always been amazing.",

This was one of the first times in a while that I was planning on going to Japan on my own dime and booked with ANA even though it wasn\u2019t the cheapest because of their fantastic service was worth a little more. Turns out I had to cancel because of the virus. I cancelled on the 17th and got a full refund on the 20th in my account. My parents had a trip around this time as well on Emirates which they fly quite frequently, and the tickets were even business class as they usually fly that way. They have had a hell of a time getting a refund after calling Emirates everyday for over a week. They have now been promised a refund finally, not a credit, but are two weeks on and still haven\u2019t gotten their money I don\u2019t think. \n\nWhen I do get to re-schedule my flight, it\u2019ll definitely be with ANA, even though one leg needs to be with United which I despise. Still worth it to support the great service ANA has",

ANA delayed our middle flight by 11 hours which means we would miss the next one, also with ANA so they would know it is a connecting flight. They offered no solution or alternative. We also paid to choose our seats on top of the price of the tickets, the seats was done through their website. The travel agency and myself have both contacted them for a refund and have not heard back. So angry with their service and ignoring of the messages regarding a refund so they don't have to give our money back!",

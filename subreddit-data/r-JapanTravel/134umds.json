            "comment": "Hi!\n\nSince no one has answered your theme park questions...\n\nUSJ and Disney each have their own different skip the line system.\n\nDisney has what is called Premier Pass.  You must have the TDR app installed on your phone.   Premier Passes can be purchased as soon as you enter the park, but can not be purchased until you are through the admission gates.  They're first come first serve and you can not buy a second Premier Pass until enough time has passed, I want to say 120 minutes.  So if you enter the park at 8:00 am, you can not buy another one until 10:00 am.  I am not quite sure how it works with 9, you might have to buy 3+6 and try to get times as close together as possible and I would recommend more than one person purchase as they can sell out if the park is crowded.  I know foreign (or at least US) cards do work for it.  I couldn't get my card to work to purchase tickets, Internationally, but had no problem purchasing Premier Passes.\n\nPremier Passes range in price based on ride and how crowded the park is supposed to be.  Soaring and Toy Story Mania are the two most expensive rides in Sea and have the longest lines in general.  \n\nUSJ sells express passes, it could have changed but when I bought mine they were physical booklets of tickets.  I expect now they are digital, but they are generally bought ahead of time as they are quite popular and do sell out.  There are lots of threads about trying to purchase them Internationally in this subreddit.  Some people have been able to purchase them directly which lets you preselect from available times for popular attractions.  People also use Klook, but you tend to be given a random time (often late in the day.)  You can also just try to get a free timed entry ticket via the app to enter Nintendo World, upon entering the park, but it will not help you skip the line on rides.  I guess if you get to a park early enough it's a non-issue and you can just walk in but from what I read that is really early like 7:00 am arrival at the park early.\n\nIf Express Passes are not sold out you can buy them at the park (or if staying at a USJ hotel, at the hotel) but that is a really big if since the passes tend to sell out in advance, at least going by reports on this subreddit.\n\nThe Pokemon Cafe needs advance reservations and your group might need to be broken up.  There is no way they are going to take a group of 9 as a walk in.\n\nMost restaurants in Kyoto tend to close relatively early.  I don't remember a lot still serving food at 9:00 pm.  I think you need to plan to eat dinner earlier.\n\nFor dessert if you really want to eat a lot of it look for Sweets Paradise.  I've not been, but it is timed dessert buffet and seems to have a ton of dessert.",

            "comment": "Shinkansen you can get an unreserved seat ticket or a reserved seat ticket. You can buy it in advance, getting it last minute you might not get on the exact train you want if it is a busy day. You can buy from ticket office of any station or at some vending machines, those you are sure to find close to the Shinkansen gate at the station.\n\nAsakusa, you are close to skytree and kappabashi. Yes there is a lot of restaurants around but I tend to just go anywhere and not take note of the place.\n\nAkihabara it depends on what you want, video games, manga, figured, anime merch, electronics, card games\u2026\n\nShibuya is mostly a shopping area, the main attraction is Shibuya Sky, Shibuya crossing and the statue of hachiko. Otherwise, lot of shopping.\n\nSuica you can get it on iPhone only, either the card or phone version work about the same (appart from recharging).\n\nYou won\u2019t exchange money at 7eleven, you will withdraw.\n\nI do not understand why you would not bring your toothbrush and toothpaste\u2026 lot of foreigners living in Japan complain about the r toothpaste options available. Shampoo and soap is available in all hotel or hostel. If your Airbnb does not include it, that would be a reason to not book Airbnb for me.\n\nKyoto to Osaka, check the route from where you want to go, going by Shinkansen is often not the best way.\n\nI saw you noted some late lunch, like 3pm. That can be tricky as there is many restaurants that are open for lunch time, the. Close early, then you have less choice until places open for dinner, usually from 5pm. Yes, there is places open at any roof the day, but selection will be different.",

            "comment": "Despite my countless reading of Japan planning, I don't recall ever seeing this mentioned until I stumbled upon it myself.  When reserving the shinkansen, some trains have a special fare called the \"Hayatoku-Family KODAMA\" which was about $75 cheaper for a family of four (this was specifically to take the Tokaido btw Tokyo-&gt;Kyoto).  You will see this as a 3rd row when purchasing tickets online.\n\nI believe the rules were you had to purchase at least 3 days in advance (up to 1 month).  If you know the day/time that you want to take the shinkansen, it can be a good money saver.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nJust reposting something from Japanese Twitter. Someone apparently stayed at the APA Hotel at Kabukicho Tower and got bedbug bites all over them when they woke up.\n\nOne of the replies mentioned about receiving bedbug bites in late 2021 when they stayed at an Internet Cafe in the same area as well.\n\nJust a friendly heads up. Be careful if you plan to stay in hotels in the area.\n\n[Click on me for the hotel tweet.](https://twitter.com/MameoKunO9/status/1653227580970143744?s=20)\n\n[Click on me for the net cafe tweet.](https://twitter.com/poyo_____t/status/1653230880033480704)",

            "comment": "Just a note that this is just how travel works.\n\nI don't think it's right to say Kabukicho specific. Ideally you should be checking no matter if you're at the Ritz or in a hostel/capsule hotel. I'm sure the places mentioned have already DNR'd the rooms and took proper precautions to remove them once they were notified. Especially the one from 2021. They would NOT still be in business if they had nonstop bedbugs for 2 years. Hotels don't want them either. Staff has to worry about bringing them home and they DO NOT want that. Most hotels don't allow personal items on cleaning carts for this reason.\n\nEvery hotel on the planet has had bedbugs at some point during it's run. Every. Hotel. It's just life in the hotel industry. They don't care about location or how \"upscale\" the place is. The bugs are just  simple hitch hikers.  Granted most nicer hotels probably catch it quicker, just know they're not immune.\n\n\nOh and you can get them on planes too.\n\nSafe travels",

Especially APA seems to be quite particular about cleaning in my experience so I wouldn't worry too much; Their cleaning crews are thorough and organised with multiple people for a single room. You can never be 100% certain there won't be any, but with APA I'd give you good chances of avoiding them. If you spot their bites, take precautions with your luggage when taking it home. If you can somehow, try and take measures before moving the stuff inside your house. This way you can make sure the little bastards can never even establish themselves.",

No need to freak out.\n\nI would guess the Twitter victim was bitten due to the high turnover rates of hotels during Japanese (and Chinese) Golden Week, and especially in a extremely touristy area like Kabukicho, things like this are bound to happen. \n\nIf you're going at the end of May, then I would guess there's going to be people staying in your room prior to your arrival, so people are likely to notice such infestations before you.\n\nTry to do what other redditors have said above (check mattress, luggage rack, etc...) and pay attention to any itchiness and/or feelings of being bitten you feel during the night. Should help reduce the chances of this happening.\n\nCalm down, stay safe and happy travelling!",

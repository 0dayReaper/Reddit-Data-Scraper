    "postText": "Hello! I have a trip planned with my friends in August this year but I have 3 days \"free\" for myself as I'll be heading over early.\n\nMy interests includes photography. diving and surfing.\n\nI generally prefer outdoor/scenic locations such as beaches/mountains/waterfalls/parks/cultural places/heritage sites.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe general plan is that I'll be meeting my friends on the 4th day, at night in Tokyo and we will be hiking Mt Fuji on the 6th day.- I thought of going for a dive but I wouldn't want to risk any injuries prior to the Fuji hike.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*My original plan was that:\n\n***Day 1***: Arrive at Kansai Airport (KIX) in the morning. Spend half a day making my way to Koyasan, and explore the area for the rest of the day. Visit Okunoin Cemetery at night and sleep in the shrine.\n\n***Day 2***: Leave Koyasan in the morning and make my way to Nachi Falls (where google says it will take \\~10h). Sleep at some hotel in the area.\n\n***Day 3:*** Leave Kii-Katsuura in the morning and head towards Yunomine Onsen (google says it will take about 3.5h). After snapping some photos (and trying out the onsen if there's time), I'll make my way to a hotel in Tokyo (google says it will take about 8h). I'll rest for the day and meet my friends on Day 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, this seems too packed/rushed and there are still some other places in the Wakayama region like the Sandanbeki Cliffs/Caves and Senjojiki Rock Plateau that I want to visit. I'm considering skipping Yunomine Onsen for these. Please also advise if Yunomine Onsen is worth a trip.\n\nAs Japan is a fairly large country, I don't think I will want to visit any of the same prefectures again in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich is why I would love it if you guys can suggest a prefecture with nice scenic places that can be easily covered in 3 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any advice/help here.",

Be well prepared: know the time tables, options to get places(both will depend on day of the week) and change your itinerary in case of emergency (begging of the typhoon season + Wakayama pref is infamous for landslides). Also some big firework festivals are happening around August, it might be difficult to book hotel with little advance. \n\nAs for rec on other prefectures: check out Yamagata, easy connections to Tokyo and good bus coverage.",

Google maps makes it look shorter but does not factor in walking around the Osaka stations to change, or the fact that the Nankai express trains don\u2019t run very frequently so you may spend time waiting. It is not realistic to do that trip on a 3 day itinerary.\n\nYou should stay in Tokyo - lots to do and see there for 3 days! You could consider a day trip to one of the surrounding areas. Or spend 3 days in Kyoto.",

But yeah I get your point on the time spent on changing/waiting for trains. \n\nWould my plan of cutting out Yunomine Onsen make it feasible (if slightly)?\n\nI considered Kyoto too, but the region\u2019s really big and seem like it\u2019d be nicer to visit in the Spring/Autumn seasons. Hmm but is there any particular prefecture with scenic places that I can \u201ccomplete\u201d in 3 days?\n\nI left out Tokyo because that\u2019s where my friends and I will be checking out after our Mt Fuji hike. \n\nAppreciate your write up!",

The bus from Kyoto to Koyasan would have been quicker in hindsight (2h 40 each way) but only runs twice per day. \n\nYou could consider Hiroshima maybe",

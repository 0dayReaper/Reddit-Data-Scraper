            "comment": "Regarding 7.7, Akihabara really comes to life starting midday-night. In the morning you'd be losing some of it's unique vibes. Also it's not worth going into the casino buildings, but otherwise I had a lot of fun there. Plenty of figurine sales, card trades, arcade games etc. It sounds cheesy, but going to one of those fun themed cafes is actually hilarious, you might even find a Pok\u00e9mon themed one.\n\nThe Skytree is nice to visit briefly, going up there can be a challenge with long lines, so really look at the opening times &amp; perhaps try to beat the crowd there or reserve a moment in advance. In the evening the tree gets lit up and the area around it is nice to walk around in. Asakusa is a really fun area to walk around in in general, plenty of affordable and very nice sushi places too",

By any chance are you into Nintendo, too? If so, note that there is a Nintendo Tokyo store here on the 6th floor, perfect for your \"19 July\" date.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/pi8UnYjkmVQi2Eip7\n\nA Pokemon store is next to this as well. Both are often crowded with lines formed, so go there on a weekday if possible.\n\nOther fun souvenir shops in the same neighborhood of the Nintendo shop:\n\nVillage Vanguard:\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/H3gJqPXyk31yHP9y9\n\nMEGA Don Quijote (this one is the largest 'Donki' store):\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/DCtsggqBeZW2KcS8A\n\nYou can consider going to Universal Studios, Osaka for the new Nintendo World if you're into Mario. This might be a whole-day thing, so plan in advance to maximize your time here.",

We decided to don\u2019t go into any Disney or Usj lands because of the waiting time.\n\nDo you know if they have final fantasy pixel remaster for switch in that store?\nAnd can I play Japanese games in German or English?",

            "comment": "Totally subjective, but since you're going to Kyoto a whole day after you fly in, you could consider flying from HND &gt; Osaka and getting a local train to Kyoto, have your first day there, then take the Shinkansen back to Tokyo after. You'll cut out a little travel &amp; repacking time since the flight is shorter (and generally cheaper).  \nOther things: if you're going Nishiki you can probably skip Tsukiji, they are decently similar and most of what is sold at Tsukiji is fish not streetfood. I'm fairly certain the imperial palace is closed Mondays, and it also has weird hours. The gardens themselves also close quite early and are also closed on Monday. Your Fushimi Inari day has you all over Kyoto, Nijo is quite far away from the Philosopher's path and Fushimi Inari",

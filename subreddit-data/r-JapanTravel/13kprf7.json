    "postText": "Hey All,\n\nBeen lurking on here for the past couple months which has been very helpful and also a bit intimidating!  My partner and I have been traveling Southeast Asia for the past 7 months and decided to end our time abroad with a trip to Japan.  I've put our current itinerary below along with a couple of questions and open to any and all feedback.  For a bit more context, we aren't interested in doing any amusement parks or team labs we are more interested in just taking in a bit of everything (landscapes, some shrines, food!, some culture).\n\n**5/25:** Arrive NRT airport in Tokyo 8:35 PM and check in to Hotel Monterey Hanzomon\n\n* Attempt to purchase 7 day JR Pass in airport? We looked into buying in advance but it seems they need to mail a voucher and already being abroad and in transit this doesn't seem feasible for us.\n* Our phones are unlocked and we've been using local sims while abroad so we are thinking of doing that/eSIM vs pocket WiFi since we can't bundle and buy in advance with JR Pass.  Thoughts?\n\n**5/26:** Tokyo\n\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Meiji Shrine &amp; Yoyogi Park\n* Accepting any lunch recommendations\n* Explore Harajuku &amp; Takeshita Street\n* Find conveyor belt sushi place for dinner\n* Golden Gai after dinner\n\n**5/27:** Tokyo\n\n* Sensoji Temple\n* Explore Akihabar\n* Imperial Palace\n* Open afternoon\n\n**5/28:** Tokyo\n\n* Street Kart Tokyo Bay (I know it looks like a tourist trap but can't help it looks fun)\n* Toyosu Fish Market for lunch (is this a good idea? We decided against going there early for the tuna auction but thought we could do lunch since we would be in area for Tokyo Bay)\n* Gundam Store\n* Open afternoon\n\n**5/29:** Transfer to Hakone\n\n* Train to Odawara - purchase 2 day Hakone Free Pass\n* Drop bags off at Onsen Hotel Gorakan\n* Part of Hakone Loop (return to hotel by 5PM for dinner)\n* We need to think more about best way to tackle the Hakone Loop over the 2 days we have there\n\n**5/30:** Transfer to Kyoto\n\n* Finish anything we missed on Hakone Loop yesterday\n* Transfer to Kyoto via Odawara and check in at The OneFive Kyoto Shijo\n* Anything else TBD based on when we arrive and check in\n\n**5/31:** Kyoto\n\n* Kiyomizu-dera temple early morning\n* Higashiyama district and stroll through Nineizaka and Sanneizaka\n* Maruyama Park\n* Hanamikoji dori area in Gion district for dinner and drinks\n\n**6/1:** Kyoto\n\n* Fushimi Inari Taisha \n* Sake in Fushimi Sake District\n* Tofukuji temple for lunch\n* Tofukuji Sando shopping street\r\n\n**6/2:** Kyoto\n\n* Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (early)\n* Tenryuji Temple\n* Togetsukyo Bridge\n\n**6/3:** Day trip to Nara\r  \n\r\n\n* Nara Park\n* Todaiji Temple\n* Kasuga Taisha Shrine\n* Naramachi district for lunch\n* Horyuji Temple Complex\n\n**6/4:** Transfer to Tokyo and fly out\n\n* Check out of Kyoto hotel and take train to Tokyo\n* Flight out of NRT at 8PM\n\nThank you in advance for any and all help! We have been trying to plan this rather quickly while traveling so feeling a bit overwhelmed currently and hoping this will help with some of that haha :).",

The only downside is that it is a bit more expensive than buying a voucher from a third party, but the benefit is that you can reserve train seats before arriving in Japan.",

I went to the JR East Travel Service Center in Shinjuku on 5/13, and exchanged it using my email with the reservation number and my passport. They also printed out my seat reservation tickets as well. I actually didn't receive any exchange order with the official website, the exchange order is only for third party sellers.\n\nStill though it's a valid option to just buy it in the country, but I would avoid buying it at the airport or at a popular JR station because lines are 1 hour + long, especially at airports. Get a suica at the airport, and then use that to get to your hotel and go to a JR East Travel Service Center in a less popular station on your first day, assuming you will be arriving in Tokyo\n\nEdit: On second thought you should probably save the JR Pass exchanging or buying to the second day, seeing as you're arriving pretty late",

Depending on how long you need the pass i would do math and try to do a 7 day ( maybe activate day you leave tokyo and then you can use it for return).  That would probably be most bang for buck.  If you can't make your leave and return in the same 7 day window, i'd skip the pass, it only makes fiscal sense if you are getting both trips to from tokyo(inc hakone) to kansai and back.  For tokyo you are better off just using the suica/passmo and only the jr if you have already activated it ( it does cover NEX so you can do that math too).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few other things.  For Hakone start by bussing to the Pirate ship and then make your way around its the one with the most limited access times and closes earliest.  The cablecar/train down is way more flexible to work around.  I also think if the day is clear the views of Fuji are better from the little town ( i don't recall the name) to where the ropeway starts.  IMO the extra 400 yen for vip is worth it if it looks busy.  If you get there early enough you can finish the loop in a day and then do anything else the next morning, maybe open air museum, we really enjoyed it.  It sounds like you have  dinner at the hotel/ryokan which is good options seem really limited at night otherwise.  i assume you are doing 1 night in Hakone.  If so pack a small carryon/backpack and ship your bag from your hotel in tokyo direct to kyoto.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKyoto - We enjoyed the Ginkakuji -&gt;philosophers path -&gt; Eikando-&gt;nanzenji-&gt;keage incline, but we were there Sakura season.  not sure if still worth it on normal times.",

Not sure it\u2019s a must see, but you\u2019ll be close and it\u2019s out of the way otherwise. \n\nDefinitely do Kiyomizu early, we had the place to ourselves. \n\nWe enjoyed Philosopher\u2019s path and the garden at Ginkakuju a lot. We had a enjoyable and affordable sushi set lunch at Sushi Isimatu. \n\nWe listened to Sightseeing Japan podcast for the places we planned to go. Helpful because so tired of researching after traveling SEA for so long. \n\nStep count was back up to 30k a day (spent 1mo in Japan) after being a little lower at the the end of SEA. We got tired, so allow for downtime. Also rented bikes for a day in KY\u014cTO give our feet a break. \n\nWe did not do fish market in Toyko. Kept reading it was crowded and $$. \n\nHave fun.",

I do appreciate that you caught that though. I figured if I laid out the things of the city I could then find an order that made the most sense. Plus some of this depends on getting reservations. \n\n\n&gt;July 13 assuming you are using the JR Pass, plan on three hours tokyo-kyoto, one hour kyoto-nara, and some time faffing around with check-in. Since the Nara sights close at 5, this will require a very early wakeup time in Tokyo to pull off.\n\nYeah we discussed this. We are considering doing something different with that timing. Plus I have that empty day that allows some flexibility to this too.  \n\n\n\n&gt;July 14 is illogically ordered and most likely not possible. I suggest to delete philosophers path (too out of the way from everything else + most famous for cherry blossoms which are obviously irrelevant in July), start early at Arashiyama bamboo, be at the doors of the monkey park at 9am opening, then Kinkakuji -&gt; Nishiki Market/tea ceremony -&gt; Fushimi Inari in the evening as this is 24/7 and the days are long in July.\n\n\nIt felt like that day was heavy. &amp; with the open day I thought about splitting this one into two. \n\n&gt;Onsen - I would deconflict this from July 11 (takes too much time to pull off during a very packed Tokyo day) and consider doing a night at a proper onsen ryokan at Hakone/Atami/Yugawara (or anywhere else close to the Tokaido Shinkansen line) on the night of July 18.\n\nI appreciate this feedback. My goal of putting on 11th is that is the night before my bday. The onsen is my personal gift to me. But so is the trip. Perhaps I can get over the timing so long as I get a good night there. I think the harder part is trying to find one &amp; book online. So confusing. \n\n\n\n&gt;Possibly controversial but I also think that one or at most two of Nishiki, Kuromon, and Tsukiji (if not watching tuna auction) are sufficient - there are only so many \"crowded tourist oriented food markets\" I can tolerate in one trip.\n\nGoogle point.

Yes it's psychological, but what is the point of going to Japan just to soak in a glorified hot tub, I would want the real stuff.\n\nMy previous comment about how to search for and book onsen (or ryokan): https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/13sb9f8/comment/jml1jw1/",

Id probably rebalance some other day/things to get more in kyoto",

    "postText": "I was looking up prices for sim cards and I saw this video ([https://youtu.be/0QF0jwzCzds](https://youtu.be/0QF0jwzCzds)) which showed much cheaper prices (6.000 yen for Unlimited/31 days data) in comparassion to the recommended Mobal and Sakura (7.920 and 9.000 yen, respectively). I searched the company name and it seems the prices are still the same ([https://www.gpa-net.co.jp/en/passenger-service/rental-store/sim.html](https://www.gpa-net.co.jp/en/passenger-service/rental-store/sim.html))\n\nIs there any reason not to buy a sim card from these vending machines? They seem pretty convinient and cheaper than the competition.\n\nEDIT: FYI my phone doesn't support e-sim, so my only options are a sim card or wi-fi router. Between the two , I'm leaning towards the former.",

Once you touch down, whip out your phone, switch the SIM to active, open the app and purchase a plan.\n\nI'd go through these steps at home but not the final purchase to make sure you are good. It might have used PayPal, I don't recall, sorry.\n\nI used it in SK and Japan last month with no issues (got a separate plan for each country was cheaper than the one that covered both).",

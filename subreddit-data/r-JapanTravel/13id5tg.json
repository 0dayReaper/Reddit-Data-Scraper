You definitely want that (as it will be cheaper to use it) and ask the ticket counter to activate it on 30-05-23\n\n*Don't forget to buy icoca (there is a counter there where you need to pay 3K yen, 500 yen for deposit and 2500 will be in your card)\n\n31-05 : yes you can put it in the station, look for coin locker, it will cost you 700-800 yen for each big bag. \n\n*Tips: I usually put my cabin bag into my baggage when I travel around and only taking it out until I need it (usually when I go home and have a lot of souvenirs and snacks, esp fragile ones).\n\n31-05: if you start at 7, you basically can take down many shrines. And even arashiyana bamboo forest (it is not that good, but up to you).\n\nI would definitely add kiyomizu dera in the afternoon and their surrounding area (full of shops and a beautiful pagoda).\n\n\n01-06: near harajuku station is meiji jingu temple, and the surrounding was very beautiful\n\n04-06: teamlab botanical only opens after 19.00\n\n05-06: you already go to kuromon, I suggest to change it to something else, maybe osaka castle?",

You will eat around 1-2K yen anyway, so 10K is acceptable. \n\nOr you can even trade your 10K yen at arcade (at their money conversion machine) and the return will be 9K yen in bill and 100 yen \u00d7 10 in coins.\n\nConvenience store also definitely gonna accept it. \n\nOr you can refill your ic card for 1K and put 10K in (and it will give out 9K as change)",

            "comment": "My general comment is that you seem to underestimate travel time, since you listed sites where you didn\u2019t seem to account enough time for walking or transit. If it was baked into the time slots, these seemed too short for the visit of the sites themselves.\n\nFor May 31: if your Osaka hotel is closer to Yodoyabashi than Umeda, it might be worth considering going via Keihan line (Yodoyabashi&gt;Tambabashi&gt; Fushimi Inari) as it will take around an hour and is cheaper than JR. Going via JR will take also an hour but you have to transfer at Shin Osaka and Kyoto. The JR route is free though if you will use a JR pass.  The advantage of going through Kyoto station is that there are more luggage lockers in that station, and I don\u2019t even know if there are any at the JR/Keihan stations near Fushimi Inari. But, having to backtrack to Kyoto Station to collect luggage also seems like a waste of time which leads to my next point\u2026\n\nLike another commenter mentioned, the one night in Kyoto seems like such a big effort to transfer and carry your luggage when you are leaving again the next day. Given the time of your Kyoto activities, why not go back to your Osaka hotel for the night?\n\nNishiki Market itself won\u2019t take you three hours but it\u2019s a good neighborhood to explore. You can wander to some nice coffee shops around there: Weekenders Coffee, Inoda Coffee, Blue Bottle Rokkoku and Cafe Kitsune ShinPuhKan, and my favorite Kurasu Ebisugawa nearer to the Imperial Palace.\n\n6/1: Kyoto to Tokyo or Osaka to Tokyo will take you at least 2.5-3 hours plus maybe 15-30 mins both ends on the subway or Yamanote line. Be mindful that you might finish late or need to drop some of your activities as you are going to serval places in just one day. One or two hours exploring a place will go by so fast, unless you intend to just breeze through then it\u2019s more likely that you will linger longer than an hour.\n\n6/4: Kuromon-Dotonbori-Shinsaibashi (it\u2019s in this order as Shinsaibashisuji is north of Dotonbori) can be explored for the 5.5 hours you allotted, but pay mind that Namba to Botanical is a 15-min subway +10-15 min walk.",

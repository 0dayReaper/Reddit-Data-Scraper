    "postText": "# Basics\n\nMy wife and I spent 14 days in Japan in May 2023, our first time in Japan (or anywhere in Asia). We usually got between 8-12 miles daily, though some of that was somewhat by choice, as in places like Hiroshima the transit within the city takes nearly as long as walking, and walking is preferrable to see and experience the city.\n\nAll the tips on here and those answering questions on Discord really helped plan things.\n\n# What I learned\n\n**Pay attention to the square footage of your room.** We got a room at an APA in Osaka where it was literally impossible for both of us to stand up simultaneously. Luckily all of our subsequent hotels had room for us both to get dressed at the same time.\n\n**Get hotels with onsens/spas.** We booked exclusively hotels with onsens/spas. This was crucial. It\u2019s such a great day-ender to go up there for a soak in the hot/cold pools and sauna. They give you robes/lounge clothes and slippers to wear up there. It\u2019s just incredibly cozy. Made me wish it was winter.\n\n**Japan is super easy to travel,** the easiest country I\u2019ve been to. It seems the country as a whole and everyone in it is extremely detail oriented and considers every possible issue. I\u2019ve never seen workers tasked with holding up a screen for pedestrian protection around a man trimming the lawn until Japan. I\u2019ve never seen a tour bus driver feather-dusting his bus until Japan. Everyone is so calm. I think I heard one person yell in two weeks. Everybody was super patient with our lack of Japanese and general lack of knowledge of their culture.\n\n**Note:** We\u2019re not really foodies. When traveling we usually just eat whenever we get so hungry that we must, plus the Japanese cuisine doesn\u2019t mesh with our tastes, so this will be light on food. \n\n# Day by day\n\n**Day 0:** Arrived at Haneda in the afternoon, got PASMO cards and caught train to Shinagawa. Then we took the Nozomi to Osaka, purchasing tickets in advance via Smart-Ex. All went smoothly despite the jet lag.\n\n**Day 1:** Osaka. Mini-pig caf\u00e9, Don Quijote, wandered the neighborhood to the northeast of Umeda Station checking out shops, finished the day in a small bar in Dotonbori.\n\n**Day 2:** Osaka area. In the morning, we rode out to Nara to see Todai-Ji and the bowing deer. The temple was stunning. In the afternoon, we went to a Hanshin Tigers game, which was great, though we were baking in the sun. It\u2019s crazy how many beer vendors Japanese baseball games have. I didn\u2019t go 30 seconds without a beer girl passing by. We ended the day with dinner at [Snow Lion] (https://goo.gl/maps/Gpt5vhJW6rprGYG97), a Nepali restaurant that was extremely tasty.\n\n**Day 3:** We activated our JR West Sanyo-San-in Area passes and headed west on the bullet train then a slow Sanyo Line train, bound for Onomichi. I rented a bike from Trek, took the ferry to Setoda and rode the Shimanami Kaido. I rode a bit south after I got off the ferry in Setoda, across the next big bridge. Then I turned around and biked back to Onomichi. It was a beautiful ride, but the parts near the Onomichi end could be skipped. Too much traffic and development. While I did this, my wife wandered around Onomichi, visiting Cat Alley and taking a ropeway ride. After that, we met up and headed for \u014ckunoshima, aka Rabbit Island. This was a cool little side trip, but not sure it was worth the time expenditure. Finally, we ended the long day traveling to Hiroshima to check into our hotel. Family Mart was our main meal, because the restaurants in Tadano-Umi were all closed on Monday, and we had time to kill before the next train back to Mihara.\n\n**Day 4:** We took a train and ferry trip to Miyajima and took the ropeway to the top, then walked the rest of the way to the top. It\u2019s a beautiful island, but pretty tourist trap-ish. Later in the day we picked up Carp tickets for a future date, then checked out the Atomic Bomb Dome at night. The main meal, at  Okonomiyaki Teppan-yaki Momiji-Tei, was extremely good Okonomiyaki.\n\n**Day 5:** Day trip to Hakata, with a stop for the Hello Kitty exhibition at a hall near Shin-Yamaguchi Station. After Hello Kitty, we headed to Nanzoin, the reclining buddha statue and temple. It\u2019s a wonderful place, the nice ladies at the train station will loan you some cover-up cloth if you have tattoos or your shorts are too short. After Nanzoin, we got some Hakata ramen at Ramen Stadium in the giant mall, then wandered the streets of Hakata a bit, stopping at Kushida-jinja Shrine. Back in Hiroshima that evening, we visited Sam\u2019s Caf\u00e9, an American-themed bar with more memorabilia than you\u2019d think possible. The proprietor is a wonderful older gentleman who loves America.\n\n**Day 6:** We started the day at the Peace Museum. This is an extremely moving visit. A late breakfast [here] (https://goo.gl/maps/3C97G5pcr692YmGv6) featured the fluffiest egg souffle I\u2019ve ever seen. Later, we went to the Carp game.\n\n**Day 7:** Shinkansen to Himeji Castle. We scheduled ourselves a four-hour layover, which was just about perfect to walk up there, see the castle and walk through it, check out the garden, and walk back without feeling rushed and with time to grab train snacks. Then we caught the Super Hakuto to Kurayoshi where we met a friend and ended the day with some onsen time at Izanro Iwasaki in Misasa Onsen.\n\n**Day 8:** Tottori Sand Dunes, Sand Museum and a trip to Refresh park Yumura, which is a very nice onsen with the standard indoor, gender-separated areas, plus some cool outdoor spots for all genders, including a little cave. You wear a swimsuit for the outdoor parts.\n\n**Day 9:** I wasn\u2019t feeling great, so I did nothing while my wife and friends went to Lake Togo area near Kurayoshi for a waterfall hike. Then we boarded the Super Hakuto for Kyoto, where we stayed.\n\n**Day 10:** We got an early start to see as many temples as possible in Kyoto before our 1pm train to Tokyo. We were able to get to Kiyomizu-dera, Ginkakuji and Shimogamo-jinja before time ran out. We used the city bus, which wasn\u2019t that bad. They weren\u2019t quite on time and we had to let a couple pass by at the very start of our day because they were too crowded. We added our PASMO card numbers into the Smart-Ex app so boarding the Shinkansen was super easy. In Tokyo, we stayed in Ueno, which was a great spot with good accessibility to the rest of the city and lots of action and places to eat and drink.\n\n**Day 11:** We started with a trip to Sanrio Puroland, which took even longer than planned due to some train delays. Our train went out of service at some point on the trip. Puroland is kind of odd. But it wasn\u2019t too expensive and my wife loved it. On the way back we stopped at Gotokuji Temple, the waving cat temple and later caught a glimpse of the waving cat train at the nearby Miyanosaka Station. For a nightcap, we checked out Asakusa Rockza.\n\n**Day 12:** Shopping/sightseeing in Akihabara. Yodobashi Camera is absolutely massive. I preferred it over Bic Camera. After some other miscellaneous shopping near Tokyo Station, we later walked from our hotel over to [this cat-themed bar] (https://goo.gl/maps/zcZCMVtrXGxtyxNf9).\n\n**Day 13:** Near Nippori Station there\u2019s a cat-centric neighborhood, Yanaka Cat Town. We stopped at a cat store or two as well as a cat art gallery. I got a great foot massage in this area, as well. This area was so cool we skipped out on our tickets to TeamLabs. For a nightcap, we went to one place in Golden Gai. That area is absolutely overrun with tourists.\n\n**Day 14:** It was super rainy, and we didn\u2019t have all that much time to kill before our flight, so we checked out the Tobu train museum. Definitely worth a visit if you like trains. Though kind of hard to figure out how to drive the trains if you don\u2019t speak Japanese. Then we proceeded to Narita on the Skyliner. Note, there\u2019s a slight discount for foreigners if you buy online.",

There weren't many tickets left at the time I bought six weeks before the game. \n\nFor Hiroshima, I'd read about how difficult it was to get tickets, so I went to the box office two days in advance of the game. We got tickets just a few rows off the field by third base.\n\nHiroshima did not accept credit cards.\n\nWe went to a weeknight game and the upper deck was not half full, so I'd think maybe you can buy closer to the game than we did.\n\nYou can also buy them at various combinis if you can figure out the machines.\n\n[Their site] (https://www.carp.co.jp/en/) has more info on tickets.",

The outfield part doesn't feel historic, like Wrigley or Fenway. Maybe the main grandstand is better?\n\nThere wasn't a whole lot of availability for our game when I bought six weeks out. It was a 2pm Sunday game. A night game would be far preferable no matter where you sit.\n\nOther than that, things went as expected. Easy train trip to/from Osaka. Even after the game all the crowds got on the first train with no waiting.\n\nThere's a machine at Gate 9 where you can scan your QR code that you'll be emailed after buying online and get physical tickets. I'm still unclear on whether the QR code can be directly scanned at the gate. I've seen conflicting reports.\n\nThe fans were amped up and there was plentiful and affordable food and drink. You can bring in beer to NPB games. Hiroshima had a station with cups for you to pour your cans in outside the gate (no cans allowed). I'm not sure if Hanshin had one. But there's a combini right outside the Hanshin gates by the train station for food/drink to bring in.",

I try to avoid any place that's overrun with tourists, so that led me to schedule only half a day, but I should've given it at least 1.5 days.\n\nI didn't really enjoy Tokyo enough to warrant the days spent there. It's possible I could've found more to do with some deeper research. Most of the stuff mentioned on this sub (anime, theme parks, seafood) is not my cup of tea, so I kind of ran out of things to do.",

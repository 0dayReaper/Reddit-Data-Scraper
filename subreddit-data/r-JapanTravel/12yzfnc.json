    "postText": "Japan Airport Customs\n\nHi\nCan someone explain why I cannot unbox items bought in Japan when leaving?  I am planning on buying a rice cooker and to carry it in a small duffle in the plane cabin and was told by the shop staff that I cannot take it out of the box.\n\nAm also going to buy Zojirushi thermos for my family as souvenirs. \n\nAppreciate if you can explain to me like a child to understand.\n\nThank you!",

Even if OP bought the rice cooker tax-free, it can still be unboxed.",

If you buy a mix of consumables and non-consumables, some shops annoyingly seal them together. \n\nAs to whether you are checked as you leave, it's all luck.

            "comment": "you must have bought it tax free.\n\nwhich tax does that even mean? I understand it as VAT - its not income tax or anything else\n\nso, that VAT is being waived for tourists at certain places and for certain items and or price ranges.\n\nit is not uncommon the waive this tax if the item is being sold outside of the country asking for that tax in the first place.\n\nthe why and who and where gets muddy. maybe because its tax or finance or because its just a mess. it does not really matter. at the core however is the idea that there is a \"loophole\" even if it is intentional, and rarely applies, that the tax need not be paid if you can prove that the item is not being used inside the country. \n\nthat is the basis of tax free shopping. you get it cheaper, but you do not get to use the item. or else people could just buy anything tax free and eat all the kit kats and wear all the kimonos.\n\nthe shop just seals it in a way that customs can determine if the item was used. as in, put everything in a bag and seal it, or tape the box closed or what have you. then they make a note in the passport (staple the receipt in it or similar)\n\ncustoms sees the receipt and will check for the item. they may even open the bag or box. see if was unopened, unused, all the kit kats on the receipt still there. and then you are good to go\n\nso use all the tax free shopping for gifts, just, dont open sht up, take it back home, and be happy",

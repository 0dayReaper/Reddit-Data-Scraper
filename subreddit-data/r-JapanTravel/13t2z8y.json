    "postText": "I will be visiting Japan this fall and winter with my brother. We will be staying for 90 days, with 1-month rentals in Osaka and Tokyo and another month of travel. I am a photographer and hope to capture beautiful architecture, landscapes, and wildlife during my stay. I am hoping to capture both fall foliage and winter landscapes. I understand that this schedule doesn't account for all of our travel times between destinations. I will probably have to cut some things out in order to avoid being too rushed.

Your day trips to Osaka are pretty spaced out, so you need to figure out what your preferences are; going from Osaka to Himeji can take more than 2 hours by local train unless you get a shinkansen from Osaka to Himeji JR Station your commute time will be long. It will take about 20 minutes to walk from Himeji Station to the Castle. There are tourist, taxi, and local bus options, but you will miss the charming streets on the way to the castle. I can tell you that because Himeji was my home for 10 years.r Tokyo offers fantastic autumn views, especially along Lake Ashi and in Hakone Gora Park. Enjoy the contrasting colors of the foliage against the iconic Mt. Fuji.\r  \n\r  \nHokkaido: Head north to Hokkaido for stunning winter landscapes. The picturesque town of Biei is known for its rolling hills covered in snow, while the ice floes of the Shiretoko Peninsula provide a unique winter photography experience.\r  \n\r  \nShirakawa-go: This UNESCO World Heritage site in Gifu Prefecture is famous for its traditional thatched-roof houses. The surrounding mountains are blanketed in vibrant colors in fall, creating a breathtaking scene.\r  \n\r  \nTakayama: The historic streets of Takayama, particularly the beautifully preserved Sanmachi Suji district, offer charming autumn scenery. Visit Hida Folk Village for a glimpse of traditional rural life against a backdrop of colorful foliage.\r  \n\r  \nAomori: In Hirosaki Park, you'll find over 2,500 cherry trees that explode in a riot of colors during autumn. The park's ancient castle adds to the picturesque setting.\r  \n\r  \nKamikochi: Located in the Japanese Alps, Kamikochi is a popular destination for autumn foliage. The serene landscapes, including the famous Kappa Bridge, provide ample opportunities for stunning photography.\r  \n\r  \nGinzan Onsen: This charming hot spring town in Yamagata is known for its traditional wooden ryokans and atmospheric streets. In winter, the snow-covered buildings create a fairytale-like setting.\n\nIf you go to Nagano and want some beautiful fall foliage and winter pictures, I would advise you to go to Karuizawa, my top place to visit whenever I am there.

If you are thinking train, it's going to be most of a day from either.  If you're thinking flying, it will be faster but is still going to eat into your time.  I don't really see how you are going to make your Nagano day work at all, ignoring trying to add in Karuizawa.\n\nThere are innumerable day trips from Tokyo and Osaka, but a lot of places mentioned are NOT day trips from either Tokyo or Osaka.  I think if you want to add some of the day trips mentioned previously you will need to add on days elsewhere.\n\nMake sure you spend some time really looking at distances and actual train times.  Like on paper, it's only 2 hours by train from Kanazawa to Takayama, except what you lose with that, is there are only 8 trains per day between Toyama and Takayama and 4 of those are locals.",

As someone with an art background, you would be missing out of a hell of a lot of opportunities by not staying on Miyajima for the night. While the JR ferry does run pretty late, I found that it was infinitely more satisfying to stay on the island vs in Hiroshima not just for the ryokan experience (A+ food do recommend) but for the ability to experience Miyajima after nightfall. Itsukushima is gorgeous at night, as is the torii, but there are also top-notch night photography opportunities at all the other shrines and temples, especially in autumn. You don't need to GO anywhere to see deer, they're everywhere and if you want photography subjects, seeing them lounging at a back-street shrine at 6pm on an average day is more interesting than hauling ass to the ropeway/natural park just to do so. The omotesando is top notch though, do stay late enough to sample all the freshly-grilled oysters and deep-fried momiji after the lines clear out. A lot can be done as a day-tripper but I seriously think you have no idea how many excellent photography situations you'd be missing out on by not staying on Miyajima itself. The late night dark after the tourists have left, with fall illuminations planned, as well as early morning the next day before the tourists arrive, are a photographer's dream.",

They got rid of most of them as the shinkansen expanded its routes. You can take early trains, but that still isn't going to help with just the amount of time a trip takes.\n\nGoogle Maps is sometimes helpful, it does not give a good sense of how long some long distance trips take because it isn't always good about frequency and transfers.  Google Maps will tell you it's only 90 minutes between Toyama and Takayama.  It will not tell you there are only 4 limited express trains a day that do that route in 90 minutes. (and only 4 local trains, which are not always timed to cover times when the limited expresses are not running.)\n\nYou still haven't said how you are getting from Nagano to Sapporo.  It doesn't matter the order you put them in, you are losing 5+ hours in travel going between the two and that is assuming you are flying from Haneda.  The same is true for Yamagata to Sapporo.  You can go to Shonai Airport and look for flights to Sapporo, but if you are going by train I'm honestly not sure if it is faster to backtrack to Fukushima and then go up to Sendai (and fly) or to take a local from Yamagata to Sendai (and again fly) and neither is going to get you anywhere that fast.  Heck, it would take you a long time to get between Nagano and Yamagata, because you would need to back track to Omiya and then catch a Tsubasa for Yamagata.  \n\nYou just have very large distances, and I get you want to see as much as possible, but having limited travel days because you are spending a month in Tokyo (or Osaka) does hurt you because you really need more time to get between these locations.  You need to cut some days from Tokyo and Osaka.  I will also say you need to be careful about running up against New Years.  It will affect travel and while there are certainly things open, there are things closed like restaurants and grocery stores.\n\nRenting a car will not help.  Speed limits in Japan tend to be low, even on expressways and shinkansen often go faster.  You also will run into tolls and issues with drop off fees and the fact you can not take a car from Honshu to Hokkaido and vice versa (and this is all assuming you are fine driving in potential snow.)  Driving can be scenic and can get you to places that are not accessible by trains, and can be much faster than local trains or even some limited expresses, but it's not faster than shinkansen.  I'm doing a road trip in Tohoku and I am going to rent a car in Fukushima-ken, return it there and then rent a second car in Aomori-ken, and return it there because it is considerably faster to take the shinkansen from Fukushima to Hachinohoe, even having to change in Sendai, than driving on the expressway and I am eligible for a TEP Pass since I am staying in Tohoku.\n\nYou can get a JR Nagano Pass and so day trips to Nagano from Tokyo (as well as Matsumoto and Karuizawa)   I've done day trips from Tokyo to Nagano 2 days in a row because I didn't want to change hotels back in '09.\n\nGood luck!",

There have not been any announcements on an increase to regional passes though.\n\nBTW assuming your concern with a visa is just the 90 days and not a financial or work based issue, it's pretty popular to travel to somewhere like Seoul for a few days and then go back to Japan and reset your 90 day visa.  I've never personally done this or needed to do so however in '09 I went to Japan for like a week, came back to the US for 2 weeks and then went back to Japan again.  I got a brand new temporary visitor stamp and a whole new 90 days.  You can't keep doing it for like a year, but you could get yourself some more days that way if your only concern was the 90 days.",

Most people who get passes get them issued about a month before they go to Japan, so they never run up agains the 90 day  validity issue.  You will.\n\nIf you have to get a 2 week pass, because of start dates, by then it will make more sense to just do a Niigata-Nagano 5 days pass for I believe 16,000 yen and the separate JR East Hokkaido for 27,000 yen.  In that case, you can actually split the time you spend in the Nagano area away from the Sapporo trip and start from Tokyo for your Hokkaido trip and use the nights you were going to use in Nagano to try to make the 7 day pass actually work.  Even if you can use a Nationwide, that still might make the most sense.\n\nAnother idea would be to do Matsumoto to Takayama to Kanazawa via bus and then go to Osaka out of pocket and then pay out of pocket and buy a 5 day JR West pass and do two days to Hiroshima  (one for Hiroshima and one for Miyajima) during your 1 month sojourn in Osaka.  You could use the remaining days to day trip to Okayama or Takamatsu, or both.  It also helps give you more days to play with since you have those 1 month periods locked in.\n\nFor getting back between Osaka and Tokyo, you can either: 1) take a bus (the cheapest option) or  2) fly on a discount airline\n\nI am sure you think I am being kind of a jerk, but I am really trying not to be,   I just want to help.",

We might get our initial passes in September and buy new ones at the increased rate if we run up against the 90 days.

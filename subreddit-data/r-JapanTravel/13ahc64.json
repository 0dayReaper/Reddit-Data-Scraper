    "postText": "We are a couple in our late 20s/early 30s from an English speaking country. We have travelled a bit but have not been to Asia very much. It will be our first time in Japan. Our proposed itinerary is below and we\u2019d really appreciate some feedback and advice. Some days are a lot busier than others but I\u2019ve tried to factor in some downtime. Osaka is looking a little empty so any recommendations would be great. \n\nA few questions:\nWe have one night in Hakone and one night in Kyoto between our time in Tokyo and Osaka. Is it possible to get our big suitcase sent to Osaka? How do we do this? We are staying in hotels the whole time if that helps. \n\nI\u2019ve heard the second-hand luxury vintage market is amazing. I\u2019m interested in a prada purse, where would you recommend I go about looking for this? \n\n\nDay 1 - Tokyo \n\nMonday 15 May \n\nFlight lands at Narita at 5pm. Get to the accommodation in the city and sleep. About 16 hours travel time. \n\n.\nDay 2 - Tokyo \n\nTuesday 16 May\n\nDisneyland \n\n.\nDay 3 - Tokyo \n\nWednesday 17 May\n\nDisneysea \n\n.\nDay 4 - Tokyo \n\nThursday 18 May \n\nPok\u00e9mon cafe, Akihabara, Odaiba, rainbow bridge and Tokyo tower (not planning on going inside) \n\n.\nDay 5 - Tokyo \n\nFriday 19 May \n\nSumo tournament, Shibuya scramble, Meiji shrine, Harajuku, Takeshita street, shiba cafe \n\n.\nDay 6 - Tokyo\n\nSaturday 20 May\n\nMonkey Kart, back to Shibuya and Harajuku to do anything we didn\u2019t have time to do there yesterday \n\n.\nDay 7 - Tokyo\n\nSunday 21 May\n\nTeamlab planets, oedo antique market\n\n.\nDay 8 - Hakone \n\nMonday 22 May\n\nTravel to Hakone in the morning, utilise the Hakone free pass. \n\n.\nDay 9 - Kyoto \n\nTuesday 23 May \n\nTravel to Kyoto, Fushimi Inari Shrine \n\n.\nDay 10 - Osaka \n\nWednesday 24 May \n\nArashiyama bamboo grove, monkey park. Travel to Osaka in the afternoon / evening. \n\n.\nDay 11 - Osaka \n\nThursday 25 May \n\nDotonbori, aquarium and Ferris wheel \n\n.\nDay 12 - Nara \n\nFriday 26 May\n\nDay trip to Nara. No specific plans here except feeding the deer and exploring the town. \n\n.\nDay 13 - Osaka \n\nSaturday 27 May \n\nOsaka castle and shitenno-ji temple \n\n.\nDay 14 - Osaka \n\nSunday 28 May \n\nUniversal Studios. Yes I know going on the weekend is a bad idea but it was the only day with express passes available. We figured the express pass on a weekend was better than no express pass on a week day. We got the 7 attraction express pass. \n\n.\nDay 15 - Tokyo \n\nMonday 29 May\n\nTravel back to Tokyo. No specific plans for this day as we\u2019ll probably go back to places we\u2019ve been that we liked. Maybe check out Shimokitazawa because I love second hand shopping. \n\n.\nDay 16 - Tokyo \n\nTuesday 30 May\n\nLast minute shopping and exploring before leaving the city by 2pm to get to Narita airport. \n\n\nThank you for reading!",

Most activities that require bookings have been booked and can\u2019t be changed. \n\nI completely understand what you\u2019re saying about efficiency and grouping local activities on the same day. From my initial research it seemed like travel time between locations can vary and I didn\u2019t know how long we were going to spend at each activity so I have purposefully booked only one thing each day - typically in the mornings and have other activities that don\u2019t require bookings afterwards. Unfortunately this will mean that a bit of backtracking will be required.",

            "comment": "I recently came back from a trip where we went from Tokyo \u2014&gt; Hakone \u2014&gt; Kyoto and sent our luggage straight to Kyoto from Tokyo.\n\nAs someone mentioned before, it is super easy to send your luggage! I contacted my hotels beforehand to confirm that they were able to send my luggage for me (they used yamato luggage delivery). When you\u2019re at the hotel, the front desk will gather information, when you check into the next hotel, when you want it delivered etc. they take care of the paperwork and you just pay the fee depending on your luggage size. It was super easy and convenient! Usually it can take around 1-2 days to arrive at the next location.\n\nWhen going to Hakone, I highly recommend getting tickets to sit in the observation car on the   Odakyu Romance train that leaves from Shinjuku Station and arrives at Hakone-yumoto station. It was such a relaxing train ride with beautiful views. \n\nAnother tip, we arrived at Hakone-yumoto in the morning and wanted to get some sight seeing done before heading to our hotel. We only had backpacks but there\u2019s a counter at the yumoto station that will also send your bags/luggage to your hotel in Hakone the same day. We were able to sight see hands free and when we checked into our Hakone ryokan our backpacks were already there. \n\nHope you have an amazing trip! Hakone was one of my favorite parts of our Japan trip.",

This frees up the 11th for more time in Kyoto where there's a huge amount for you to see and do, including Gion, Nishiki Market, Pontocho Alley. It'll also be faster for you to make the day trip to Nara from Kyoto as opposed to Osaka, make sure you take the express and not local train.",

I would consider doing 2-3 nights at Kyoto as there is probably more to see there than Osaka on a first time visit. You can do Nara as a day trip from Kyoto as well.",

Easily got a Nintendo timed entry. The longest I waited for a ride was probably about 30 - 40 minutes all day, with most waits being under 20 minutes. I rode all the popular rides. \nThe longest wait I had was actually the food lines, they were absolutely horrible. It felt impossible at times to get anything to eat or drink.",

            "comment": "You can easily ship your luggage from one hotel to another, the front desk will help you. I just sent mine today from Kagoshima to Tokyo, one stupid large bag and one medium bag for ~40. It's also super easy to take it on the Shinkansen, if it's normal carry on size, or you book an oversized luggage seat. But medium size luggage fits above your seat no problem. \n\nMy favorite side quest from Osaka is the Himeji castle, and get the garden add-on. The castle is beautiful and you can walk through the whole thing and there's tons of great historic information. And the view from the top can't be beat. The garden add-on is cheap and it's something like 10 individual themed gardens which are gorgeous. They're located right next to the entrance to the castle. It's only like an hour outside Osaka and definitely worth it IMO.\n\nA couple other suggestions, get Google translate and download Japanese for offline use. It can instant translate through the camera everything, even hand written signs and menus work most of the time. Buy a passmo card for easy access to 99% of the public transportation you'll encounter all over the country. If you want data while you're here download an eSim such as Ubigi, it's $17 for 10 gigs of data for 30 days, I've used my phone constantly for maps, social media, translations, web browsing, etc. and still ended up with 3 gigs left over. Finally Google maps is pretty amazing for navigating public transportation.\n\nHave fun, Japan is awesome!",

            "comment": "Here to help with second hand luxury vintage - in Tokyo it's everywhere. I had a few stores saved down that I'd frequented before, but just keep an eye out as you wander around, found myself popping into many other stores anytime I spotted a Louis/Chanel/Hermes in the window. \n\nSave 'Ragtag' locations in your Google Maps - there's a big one in Harajuku, and ones in Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and a few other areas. 'Kindal' is another secondhand 'chain' I went to (got an LV scarf at one for about a quarter of the RRP) - generally close to RagTag stores, with locations in Shinjuku, Shibuya, Harajuku, Ginza. \n\nBoth RagTag and Kindal have a mix of clothes, bags, accessories from a broad range of luxury designers. \n\n'Brand Off' in Ginza only had bags, and a great mix of brands (got a cute Loewe bag from here). 'Brand Collect' have a few outlets too, and mostly bags with some clothes. \n\nGinza has the most store that have secondhand luxury handbags, quite a lot of stores dedicated to Hermes/Louis Vuitton/Chanel in particular. I would just pull up google maps and search for \"Second Hand stores\" and that's a super easy way to find places to check out. \n\nFor novelty, check out 'Vintage QOO' and 'AMORE vintage' in Harajuku/Omotesando. The latter have one store dedicated to LV and one store dedicated to Chanel. The range is just so incredibly impressive! And everything is in amazing condition.",

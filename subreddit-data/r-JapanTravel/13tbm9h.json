I totally understand that some of my plans won\u2019t end up happening but it\u2019s how I roll. My husband is the one who will convince me to go off script when necessary lol.\n\nANYWAY that being said I could use some help determining if this makes sense for the Kyoto portion of my trip. I\u2019m about 99% sure that there are more shrines than are feasible here, but I\u2019m having trouble figuring out which ones will take how long and which I should prioritize so I\u2019d appreciate insight. (By the way, I am not holding myself to the exact amount of time spent at each but it helps me to estimate lol) Also whether my walking paths make any sense or not and thoughts on Option 1 and Option 2 (or something else, lol) on day 3.\n\n**Day** 1\n\nCheckout Tokyo, Head to Kyoto Shinkansen\n\n* Check in at Sotetsu Fresa Inn Kyoto-Kiyomizu Gojo\n* ~~Wander through historic &amp; shopping areas in central Kyoto Gion Geisha district, visit Yakata Antiques Hanami-koji Street &amp; side alleys Shirakawa Area along the canal Shijo Avenue~~\n* Yasaka Shrine (20 min)\n* Gion wandering/shopping\n* Kodaiji Temple Lightscape (600Y/$5-6) at night (5-9:30 PM)\n\n**Day 2**\n\n* 6  AM, depart for Fushimi Inari Shrine (free)  (**spend about 3 hours?)**\n* On the way out, check out vendor stalls and get some street food.\n\nGo to Philosopher's pathish area\n\n* ~~Yasaka Shrine (Free)~~ **~~(15-20 min)~~**\n* ~~Heian Temple (Free)~~ **~~(time?)~~**\n* ~~Kurodani Temple or Konkaikomyo-ji Temple (Free) (45-1 hour)~~\n* Eikan-do Zenrin-ji Temple **(1-1.5 hrs)**\n* Kumano-Nyakuoji Shrine **(quick stop)**\n* ~~Okazaki-jinja Shrine (Free)~~ **~~(might skip)~~**\n* Otoya-Jinja (Free) **Quick stop**, mouse guardians\n* Stop for shaved ice at Komichi\n* Shinsh\u014d Gokuraku-ji (Shinnyo-d\u014d) Temple **(2ish hrs??)**\n* Honen-in Temple (Free) Small, **quick stop**\n* Higashiyama Jisho-ji (Silver Pavilion) (500Y/$4-5) **(1 hr)**\n\n**Day 3**\n\n***Option 1***\n\n* ~~Take Karasuma line to below Kyoto Botanical Gardens (200y $1-2)~~ **~~(1-2 hours)~~**\n   * Walk to nearby Kamigano-Jinja Shrine (free) (**Time**?)\n* 30ish minute walk to Shoden-ji Temple ($400Y/$3-4) (**Time**?)\n   * Beloved by David Bowie\n   * Bamboo\n* Back to Hotel\n* 8:30 PM, 20-30 min walk to Kiyumizu-Dera shrine (400Y/$3) to see it lit up at night\n   * (may need to check the time for this closer to the date).\n   * Arriving closer to closing time is better for less people\n\n***Option 2***\n\n* Kyoto Imperial Palace &amp; Gardens (free) (**1hr**)\n   * One of the few imperial palaces that don\u2019t require an application for admission\n* Seimei Shrine (free) (Quick stop)\n* Nijo Castle (800 yen/$6, additional 500/$4 to go inside\\* (**Possibly skip**) (**Time**?)\n* Explore Nagayo Ward (lots of shopping and eating and drinking) Kawaramachi Dori and Shijo Dori and Teramachi and Shin-kyogoku covered shopping arcades\n\nDay 4 Arashiyama\n\n* About 1 hr to Saga Arashiyama Station \n* Tenryuji Temple (**20 min**)\n* Nonomiya-jinja Shrine &amp; Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (Free) (**1-1.5 hrs**)\n* Okochi Sanso Garden (1000 yen/$7-8) to train station **(1 - 1 \u00bd  hour)**\n   * Okochi-Sanso Villa is the former estate of actor Okochi Denjiro (1898-1962)\n   * Admission fee includes a cup of matcha and a sweet Hilltop view of entire city\n* Take the Sagano Romantic Train Get off train at Kameoka Station and take to Saga Arashiyama Station\n\nThese 3 Dependent on Time/Energy\n\n* Gioji Temple (300Y/$2-3)  (**Time**?)\n* Adashino Nenbutsu-ji Temple (500Y/$4-5) **(Time?)**\n   * Bamboo grove\n* Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple (300Y/$2-3)  (**Time?)**\n   * 1200 statues\n\n**Day 5**\n\n* Check out Kyoto\n* Train to Daigo-ji Temple (1500 yen to see whole thing) **(time??2 hours??)**\n   * Bentendo Hall, especially beautiful in Nov, most photographed building\n   * Landscape garden\n* Nara Park DEER.\n* Kasuga Taisha Shrine &amp; Garden (Free grounds, 500Y/4-$5 inner area) **(1 hour)**\n   * Famous for its many stone lanterns\n* Get some Sake at Harushika Sake Brewery\n* Train to Osaka",

Also Todai-ji in Nara and Byodo-in in Uji (between Kyoto and Nara).\n\nIn Arashiyama there is a fun monkey park on the south side of the river - lots of small monkeys running around freely. You can feed them, but watch your possessions as they are not shy about grabbing stuff.\n\nThe shopping arcades near Kawaramachi dori are fun - a little touristy but lots of eclectic goods to look through, and there are a bunch of restaurants nearby.",

From there you get nice views out over Kyoto on one side, and Lake Biwa on the other. Plus there's a pretty garden you can stroll around. On the far side of the mountain is Enryaku-ji, which is a temple, yes, but unlike the hustle bustle of central Kyoto this one is quite serene and surrounded by tall trees. (it wasn't serene in the 16th century - the forces of Oda Nobunaga slaughtered the monks and burned down the buildings). But I think you would need to take a bus to get there.\n\nToei Kyoto Studio Park - western Kyoto: Half movie set and half amusement park. I've never been there, but if you like samurai movies/TV then you can walk around the outdoor sets where many such things have been filmed, and also I think see some live performances. A little bit of anime-themed attractions as well. I would not expect to be amazed, but it might be a interesting for a change of pace.\n\nKyoto Railway Museum - southern Kyoto: I haven't been here either, but should appeal to any train enthusiasts.\n\nThat's all that comes to mind for the immediate Kyoto area, but there's a wide range of day trips you could take to Nara, Osaka, Kobe, etc.",

This transfer will take you longer that you expect, consider if it's worth it. (haven't been to that temple, speaking from general exp.). You also need to make sure you get into a train that stops there (express trains might not, I am not sure)\n\nYou see deer as soon as you walk into the part (everything in green on Google Maps on the eastern side of Nara is basically one sprawling park). There's most deer in that area (Kofuku-ji, Nara national Museum area broadly speaking), but that's also where everyone wants to take a photo. But there's more deer! They are EVERYWHERE! My best deer experience was a little deeper into the park where people spread out between the temples, but the interactions are just as fun. You can always get some deer cookies on the way back.\n\nImportant to know about Nara (also Kyoto largely speaking) it's ALL uphill from the station. Not in a major way, but you keep walking uphill until you reach Kasuga Taisha (or even further if you want to). I had a slightly different schedule (Kyoto -&gt; Osaka for a nights in a capsule -&gt; Tokyo) and I forwarded my main luggage straight to Tokyo. Consider doing that or at least leave it in a locker in the train station. You don't want to be dragging it on an unpaved path all the way to Kasuga Taisha.",

They won't bow as much, will gang up on you and eat everything you're holding including bags. It's an amazing experience. Also, most shops seem to close by 5pm or 5:30pm.",

I\u2019d honestly recommend taking a look at Japan-guides suggested day trip itineraries. A lot of things you\u2019re doing are super spread out with your plan, when they\u2019re a 10-15 min walk from other temples you\u2019re doing on other days!  For example philosophers path and ginkaku-ji are right next to each other but super far from Inari. Also Inari is not too far from kiyomizu dera. Don\u2019t underestimate how long it takes to catch a train + the added time of trying to figure out where the entrance is / what platform to use. That alone added 10-15 minutes to every train trip I took lol. If there\u2019s things you can just walk to instead, try to set the days up that way! I didn\u2019t follow Japan guide 100%- but I did just split the 8 hour itineraries in half to make 4 hour days so I could make time for other reservations / events (tea ceremony, special cafes, sento etc). The website also has ratings / rankings for attractions so you can figure out what to prioritize. Hope that helps!",

You can take the train to get closer to it, but you\u2019ll have to take a bus or a taxi to get to it (or take a very long walk). I would recommend going to Ginkakuji if you are there as it is the highlight of the Philosopher\u2019s Path area. \n\nRegarding Nijo Castle, it is currently undergoing renovation, so the outside is covered with a tarp, but I believe you can still go inside. If you want to skip that, I recommend moving Daigo Temple here, which would allow you to devote a whole day to Nara.\n\nIn Nara, you should definitely add Todaiji. It is quite impressive.\n\nI really admire your plan. You include a lot of places that are lesser known to overseas tourists. That means you\u2019ll have a unique experience in Kyoto. One last recommendation is to perhaps prepare a non-temple activity or two in case you get temple burnout, which is a real thing. Perhaps a museum or a craft activity or cultural experience could break up the parade of temples in a way that would help you avoid that burnout.",

Heian is not a short distance from Yasaka, and giving yourself only 20 minutes to soak in Yasaka is...rushing it tbh. There could be some really cool festival or performance there and lingering to watch or wait in line for some takoyaki would throw your whole schedule off. Taking taxis between all of these locations can add up even if it cuts time a little, and that's if you can find one quickly.\n\nOn the one hand, I found that maps were hard to gauge actual distances between sights, especially in Osaka and Tokyo, but on the other hand some of them \\*aren't\\* in easy strolling distance, and with hills and stairs you're adding time to every walk, never minding the fact you'd have to tell yourself not to stop and glance into a cute shop or a delicious-smelling food stall. Strongly suggest you decide which sights are the most interesting to you (be it for history, beauty, or other personal reasons) and then map based on location. The imperial palace and Nijo are very close by so those make sense, but trying to hit Fushimi Inari AND upper Higashiyama (Yasaka, Philosopher's Path, etc) is already a lot without 6 additional stops. With high tourist traffic it can take upwards of half an hour to walk from Kiyomizudera to Yasaka, and that's if you blitz through without looking at any shops. Now you're tired and annoyed and have you really actually SEEN Kyoto?",

You'll be able to see the terrain for yourself and also gauge by the length of the video how much time is actually consumed between points A and B. I don't use youtube much but those videos honestly prepared me for Kyoto and Osaka like no blog or photo ever could. It also showed a vast difference between walking through a tourist area or shotengai (shopping arcade) versus just walking on regular residential streets, how you can enjoy the experience without just zooming to a destination.",

It\u2019s close to the Togetsukyo Bridge. The other side of the river is where the Monkey Park is located. It\u2019s an uphill hike, about 20 minutes or so. This side of the river where most boat rentals are docked is very zen like. \n\nI walked further down the river and saw this sign saying great view up ahead. I followed the sign and hiked uphill. There was a small shrine at the top of the mountain overlooking the city. The view, to say the least, is breathtaking. All I can hear are the birds chirping and the flow of the water coming from the nearby waterfalls.\n\nBy the time I came back to the Bamboo Grove at around 1pm, it\u2019s already crowded. I also saw a line up at Arabica. I was thinking of going there to grab coffee earlier in the day but they don\u2019t open until 9am.

Trying to visit too many places may dilute the experience.\n\nWe visited 3-4 temples and shrines each day on average and didn\u2019t get temple burnout. Each of them has unique characteristics and many have beautiful gardens. It may also be because we\u2019re Asian, we can make the connection quite naturally. I don\u2019t know if you have a budget for this, but a private walking tour with a professional local guide, even for half a day, can enhance the experience if you enjoy temples and shrines. For example, our guide talked about the differences between Buddhism and Shinto, how they co-exist, Zen Buddhism vs Pure land Buddhism, how to walk through torii gates and pray in Japanese manners, etc.\n\nDay 2 looks super busy. 2-3 hours is decent amount of time at Fushimi Inari. I highly recommend planning proper time to enjoy Kyoto cuisine. Proper meals may take 1-2 hours. We love food so can\u2019t imagine a trip to Kyoto without trying local cuisine such as kaiseki, herring soba, mackerel sushi, tofu set meal, Kansai-style unagi and sukiyaki.\n\n\nI don\u2019t see Kinkaku-ji in your itinerary. I personally think it\u2019s worth visiting though some may say what you\u2019ll see will be the same as many photos on the internet. I enjoy seeing it in person, viewing from different angles and analyzing the architecture. Initially, I thought it would potentially be a disappointment when planning but I was glad to visit it. Try to come early morning or late afternoon to avoid big crowds.\n\nDay 4 looks packed too. Otagi Nenbutsu-ji and Adashino Nenbutsu-ji took us 45-60 minutes each. After visiting Adashino, we walked past the crowded and touristy bamboo forest and felt no need to linger there. The serene atmosphere at Adashino bamboo grove was way better.",

            "comment": "I can chime in on day 2 as I am in Kyoto right now, and have literally just done a version of your day! We got up at 5am, and arrived at Fushimi Inari at 6:15am. It was perfectly quiet, we had a super, but very tiring walk up! We left about 8:30, arrived back to our accommodation near Kiyomizudera at 9:15ish, and had a cup of tea, a shower, and a rest. \n\nWe left for Philosophers Path at 11:30, and stopping for lunch on the way started the walk at the top at Ginkajuji at 1pm. We walked down the path, spent time in a couple of nice shops, had a coffee, and saw Honen-in and Otoya-jinja By 3:30pm we had only just left the latter, and decided to make our way home having done 20,000 steps already! \n\nThe three temples we saw this afternoon were all lovely, and I would recommend them all. Otoya has a super cute mouse goshuin design if you collect those (and as a shrine/temple lover, if you don't, you should look in to it on this sub!).\n\nI think you have a lot planned, so I'd build in a little rest into your morning, and start at Ginkakuji when you're ready and work your way down, because that's a 'not to be missed' IMHO. The walking map lies about the time it will take you, because you're not on a mission walking from A to B, you're strolling and admiring and taking side routes into temples! \n\nIt's also worth me saying that we're on day 13 of the trip, and fatigue is setting in, so if it's earlier in the trip for you, you may find more energy!",

            "comment": "okay, I may have some input here.\n\nfirst thought, first paragraph in\n\nplaning early is not bad, and being very detailed on paper can be a great thing, but I caution you, plans might not work, and or being too rigid may actually prevent you from experiencing great things\n\nnow, a lot of temples in kyoto. there is a thing called temple fatigue. not everybody gets it though. you seem aware so I will not lose another word about it\n\nokay next thoughts, going into your actual plan\n\nday 1, you come from tokyo. exploring the area, you know about nighttime illumination at kodaiji, plan on going, great.  \nbe aware, it could be FULL, as in 2-3h long wait until you get in. you might want to also see entokuin while you are there...\n\nday 2, 6am start.\nyou know, it sounds so easy. \"start early\" \"you can do fushimi 24/7\" getting up to depart at 6am is a lot harder than it sounds, especially when you have been doing 10k+ steps, and when you have been doing full days since you arrived.  \nits hard to estimate how long you will need for a shrine. it depends on how fast you walk, how long you sit down, if you will eat something on the hike, but 3h seems a reasonable estimation for rough planning  \nyasaka btw you can also visit in the evening if you dont need the food stalls. pretty lights. \noh boy, time estimation for heian... you know, it depends, will you see the garden? you can hop in, and leave in 15min, or spend over an hour going through the garden...\nnow I will admit, even though I know a lot of temples, i dont know the others by name on your list.  \nit sounds overly ambitious. but I know if you walk along the route and are able to duck in and see some temple/shine you can actually see a good number in a day, so I wont say its not possible.  but I would advise you to have a backup plan, even if that is just \"well then i wont see them\"\n\nday 3: \neverytime I went to the imperial palace it was closed for the public. nijojo was good. and option 2 would still allow for the kiyomizudera at 8:30 pm . you might still find some time for exploring some more of kyoto with imperial palace and nijojo. \noption1. botanical gardens may be great but in october, november... thats possibly very disappointing... \n\nday 4:\nwhen you exit tenryji garden you will stand at the entry of the bamboo grove. and you will need to go through it to get to the entry of okochi sanso garden, so no \"will skip if too busy\".\nand while adashino has a prettier bamboo piece, if you lack time and stand at tenryuji and you want to see okochi, I am not sure its neccesary or even too practical to rush up to adashino.  \nthe rest of your day very ambitious, I think you probably wont make it to adashino, or nenbutsuji. and when you start walking up there you might find other POIs. I advise to follow those and find some maybe hidden gems, even if it means you wont see it all.\nseeing all of arashiyama is not possible in 1 day. i am not sure 3 days will suffice\n\nday 5 looks okay, but, even though it looks simple, its still plenty to juggle\nchecking out, what about the luggage?  \nthen heading to daigoji, sure. it is a bit out of the way though. but after, going to nara. now, its okay, makes sense, you are already in south-ish kyoto, but, you probably need to spend time and effort to get back to a place where the train to nara can get you.  \nso you make it to nara. you get to the park, good. to get to kasuga taisha, you have to walk through a lot of the park.  \nwalking back to the brewery, and from there you need to get to a train station which connects to osaka.\nbring good shoes.\n\nhope that helps. sorry that i cant give you \"that will take 67minutes\" estimations.",

                            "comment": "Just chiming in a bit! I agree with most everything catwiesel said as it\u2019s pretty much spot on, except with the imperial palace, I\u2019ve never had issues getting in during opening hours. I\u2019m not sure if you were here during/post-Covid times? I believe it\u2019s closed on Mondays, but otherwise open. The opening times are here:\n\nhttps://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/multilingual/lang/en/information.html\n\nAlso with the botanical gardens, it\u2019s pretty flexible year round. I went in December last year and the rose garden and autumn momiji were beautiful, but when I went again in March the rose garden was dead but the camellia section and the cherry blossoms were really pretty. There\u2019s also a greenhouse there with tropical plants which (I assume - I\u2019m no plant expert!) is good all year round. In October/November, if the autumn momiji is still going on, it might be really pretty there, but I do agree that it\u2019s worth checking online in advance to avoid disappointment.\n\nFor the Kiyomizudera night illumination, I would be cautious as well. I\u2019ve tried to go multiple times in my time here and it is always absolutely rammed haha, and we got there just after sundown at around 5pm-ish last November. The crowd was so big we couldn\u2019t even see the queue, so we ended up giving up and heading back down. Some of my friends have made it in though, so I guess it is possible!\n\nAs a quick note on your Yasaka Shrine visit, it\u2019s very close to Gion/Kiyomizudera and almost forms part of the route down through Higashiyama, so it may be worth moving it to your first day if you\u2019re in Gion anyway. It\u2019s quite a trek from philosophers path in my opinion! OtherwiseI I echo what catwiesel said, it\u2019s probably worth making sure you won\u2019t be too tired before/after fushimi inari as it\u2019s an exhausting trek haha.\n\nHope you have a great trip here, you seem super organised!",

I'm in no way an expert but also a massive planner so v happy to chat if there's anything I can help with, it wasn't our first trip there and I love the city.

Kinkakuji also fab in my opinion. Loved Toji + its Sunday market. Shosei-en is my favourite garden, it's a bit small but an absolute oasis, Kyoto railway museum was worth the trip for something a bit different. \n\nDepending on your food preferences, I'd recommend a trip to Pontocho. It's very touristy but we really enjoyed the experience/novelty. Otherwise, had some great (a bit more veggie-based) meals at Mimiko and Kitchen Bonasai. Actually enjoyed more cafes than restaurants to be honest.

            "comment": "As someone in Kyoto right now, the temples start to look the same after a while. We ended up doing 2-4 must-see temples a day along a route with other things to mix it up. Unless you are a huge fan of temples/shrines/history, I would pick a few standouts that you absolutely can't miss and explore other parts of the city in between. You will undoubtedly stumble across more unexpected temples in your exploring. \n\nI am also a big planner and my itinerary was incredibly overcommitted. I narrowed it down the closer we got to our trip when I realized how much transit time (and walking) it was going to take just to get to all of them.",

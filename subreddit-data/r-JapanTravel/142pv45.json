    "postText": "Hi there! \n\nLooking for itinerary suggestions for a 14 day trip in Okinawa in late September to early October. \nI've been to the main Japan archipelago multiple times but this will be my first time in Okinawa hence I'm looking for any and all suggestions on what to do. \n\nTravelling with 2 friends and we're planning to rent a car for the entirety of the trip. \n\nWe're from Malaysia so we'll first be arriving in Taipei (Taiwan) for a short layover then flying to Naha via Peach airline. \n\nFirst off, some locations we've bookmarked:\nChuraumi Aquarium\nOkinawa World\nKouri Island \nUmikaji Terrace\nZamami Island\nIshigaki island (if possible....Peach doesn't seem to service Okinawa to and fro Ishigaki...)\n\nThere are other miscellaneous places but we're currently overwhelmed on how we should start our journey in Okinawa...ie. should we head northwards on the first day then make our way back south to Naha? Or should we go from Naha slowly exploring north then just drive back down....\n\nAny and all input is appreciated!!!",

            "comment": "Okinawa is wonderful. Just keep in mind that it will still be the typhoon season so there may be flight/ferry cancellations. I particularly love Kerama Islands - Zamami (already included in your list) and Tokashiki Islands. Both have wonderful swimming beaches, snorkeling opportunities and kayak tours are also a lot of fun. If you make it out to Ishigaki, I would also suggest an overnight or at least a day trip to nearby Iriomote Island which is home to beautiful mangrove forests that you can kayak through, waterfalls and beaches. I think two weeks is a good amount of time to explore the many wonders of Okinawa. For a flight from Naha to Ishigaki, you can also look up Visit Japan Airfare of ANA, which offers discounted tickets to visitors to Japan as long as you can show your return ticket out of the country.",

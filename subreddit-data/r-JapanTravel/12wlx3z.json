    "postText": "Hi Everyone, \n\nI made a plan for my first trip to Japan next Saturday (29 Apr - 7 May). Really appreciate to have some  feedback on my itinerary! It's fast-paced but \"probably\" do-able using the information on the Internet. I choose Hokkaido to avoid the Golden Week crowd and hope to catch the last glimpse of Cherry Blossom.  Please let me know if I still miss something!\n\nDay 1 (29 Apr): Arrived at 20:00 in CTS. Rush to Sapporo for a quick Ramen to kick start the trip.\n\nDay 2 (30 April):\n\n\\- Morning: Travel around a bit and get back to CTS and catch the flight to Hakodate. Arrive by noon.\n\n\\- Afternoon/Evening: Visit the area around Hakodate bay (Red brick house, Hachimanzaka slope, Mt. Hakodate at night).\n\nDay 3 (1 May):\n\n\\- Morning: Visit Goryokaku Park and Hakodate morning market.\n\n\\- Afternoon/Evening: Move to Noboribetsu for a Ryokan experience and spend the night.\n\nDay 4 (2 May):\n\n\\- Morning/Afternoon: Visit Jigokudani and Lake Shikotsu/ Mt. Tarumae (Lake Toya was considered but the route to Shikotsu is more convenient).\n\n\\- Evening: Move to Biei and spend the night.\n\nDay 5 (3 May):\n\n\\- Morning: Take the early bus to blue pond and get back. Then take the 2 courses of cycling around Biei (Patchwork and roller coaster)\n\n\\- Afternoon/Evening: Move to Ashahidake and spend the night.\n\nDay 6 (4 May):\n\n\\- Morning/Afternoon: Visit Daisetsuzan national park (Mt. Asahidake loop).\n\n\\- Evening: Move back to Sapporo.\n\nDay 7 (5 May): Otaru day trip (including Shimamui and Cape Kamui).\n\nDay 8 (6 May): Visit points of interest in Sapporo (Nijo market, Makomanai Takino, Mt. Moiwa, shrines).\n\nDay 9 (7 May):\n\n\\- Morning: Unplanned.\n\n\\- Afternoon: Move to the airport and get back home.\n\nThank you all in advance!!!",

            "comment": "I just came back from a 10 days trip to Hokkaido with Sapporo (3 nights), Noboribetsu + Lake Toya (1 night), Hakodate (2 nights), Niseko (1 night) and  Cape Kamui/Shakotan + Otaru (2 nights). \nI rented a car upon leaving Sapporo and drop it off at Otaru. \n\nFor day 1, it makes more sense for you to just get a  hotel around New Chitose Airport as you\u2019re landing at 8pm. Going from airport to Sapporo is not that cheap if you take the train but takes 1 hour 15 mins give or take if you go with the cheaper bus option. For next day, if you plan to reach Hakodate by noon, you\u2019ll be leaving Sapporo very early. Not worth the cost and hassle at all to commute back and forth. \n\nI really enjoyed my stay at Lake Toya, very scenic and prefer it over Noboribetsu. Renting a car makes it easy to get from Noboribetsu to Toya in less than an hour. \n\nFor your Otaru day, I have to tell you that it\u2019s quite impossible or very rushing if you\u2019re relying on public transport. Cape Kamui is very scenic but only form of public transport is bus which can be very infrequent. I used a car so it was a really nice stopover there before ending the night at Otaru from Niseko. Most of the shops at Otaru at Sakaimachi Street also closes by around 6pm. It\u2019s super quiet at Otaru by 6pm. \n\nNijo Market is quite a waste of time. There is barely any stalls there and quite pricey. If you\u2019re going to Hakodate morning market, that\u2019s a way way better morning market experience already so you can skip Nijo. I left Nijo within 5 mins of arrival.",

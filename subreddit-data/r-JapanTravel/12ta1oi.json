I would have the jr pass activated on your fourth day since you wont be using it while in shinjuku/Tokyo. Have it start on the day you leave tokyo. I would even maybe have it activate on day 6 so it is valid for your return trip to tokyo as that is the most expensive leg of the trip. assuming your doing a 7 day jr pass.  this is a really good site to caluclate the cost of your trip to see if its worth a jr pass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/",

We didnt go yet but i have my ticket for April 23- not sure why you wouldnt be able to do this",

If you purchase pass from unofficial 3rd party vendors, you have to wait until you get to japan and exchange the voucher for the actual pass before you can book the train tickets. But there definitely is a JR train from Shin-Osaka to Hiroshima station and can even use JR pass for the ferry to Miyajima",

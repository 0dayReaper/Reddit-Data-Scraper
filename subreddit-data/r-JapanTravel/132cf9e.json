Misen, let alone the other sights on the island. It took us 3 hours to do just the omotesando and Itsukushima, we never even got to the mountain. If you want to actually do any hiking or take the ropeway, it'll be at least half a day. OTOH it takes less than an hour to go through the Atomic Bomb museum unless you really like to linger thoughtfully over every artifact, and the castle about the same. The park is a fine sight and better for lingering if you want to be thoughtful but you may still be wildly overestimating the time you would be capable of spending on site.\n\nAlso consider that it actually takes 25-30 minutes to get from the main Hiroshima train station to the Miyajima-guchi station, from which you have a short walk to get to the ferry, to and from.\n\nI would consider what you're going to Hiroshima/Miyajima to see, specifically, before expending that much time trying to time your transportation to the minute in order to cram in a side trip.",

So say:\n\n\n* 8:50 - Super Jet Ferry Matsuyama -&gt; Hiroshima arrive at 10:10\n* 11:00 - Ferry from Hiroshima to Miyajima\n* Faf around on the Island, check out Mt. Misen\n* 17:10 - Ferry from Miyajima to Hiroshima\n* 18:00 - Dinner / Check out the Atom Bomb Dome and Peace Park\n* 20:00 - Shinkansen from Hiroshima to Tokyo",

The train and ferry schedules may be tight and on point but a lot of people don't make allowances for where you have to walk to/from locations, and Miyajima is a good example. The best part of travel is doing what you want to do the most, so deciding you really want to make the most of Miyajima is a valuable choice.",

            "comment": "Just to confirm, will you not be using a JR Pass, right? The reason I ask is because the Nozomi train is not covered by the JR Pass, and the train you mentioned from Hiroshima to Tokyo is the Nozomi. However, if you are traveling after October, there is a new JR Pass that does allow you to take the Nozomi.\n\nAs for the train to Matsuyama, you can take the Shiokaze rapid train from Okayama. BTW, the Shiokaze has special Anpanman-themed trains running, which I happened to take before.\n\nEx Kyoto 9:25-&gt; Okayama 10:25 by Nozomi, Okayama 10:35 -&gt; Matsuyama 13:15 by Shiokaza\n\nRoute search web  \nhttps://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/",

If you have a JR Pass, you won't have to pay for most JR trains, but there are a few exceptions like the Shinkansen Nozomi. Google Maps is fine for navigating, but I recommend the website I shared above for checking the last train times.\n\nAs for the last train from Hiroshima to Tokyo you can take with your JR Pass on weekdays, I believe the following itinerary would work:\n\nHiroshima 18:52 -&gt; Shin-Osaka 20:21 by Sakura 568  \nShin-Osaka 20:45 -&gt; Tokyo 23:29 by Hikari 668\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t take Nozomi or Mizuho with a JR pass, which would be much faster than Hikari or Sakura.",

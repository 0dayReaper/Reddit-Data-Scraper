            "comment": "Other commenters were more polite so let me spell it out. This schedule is insane. Just travelling between all those points will take you 2 hours MINIMUM. Probably 3 hours.\n\nSkip Arashimaya and since you are at Sannenzaka go to Shoren-in which is close. It's a smaller temple, with few visitors, but you get to walk on tatami floors and appreciate a zen garden, there's also a bit of a bamboo grove if you're dead set on that (nothing special, bamboo grown like a weed all over Japan). Shoren-in will give you a moment to catch your breath between the crowds of Sannenzaka and the golden pagoda.\n\nAlso, unless you LOVE crowds, Sannenzaka isn't that special, but it's absolutely overrun with people. I've been there on a Monday and there were just two streams of people, one going up and one down, taking up the whole street.",

Kinkaku-ji was worth seeing imo, and the layout of the grounds means you can get some good photos that don't look crowded, even if the crowds are heaving.\n\nBut agreed with what the other commenter said - public transport is a little shitty. I recommend to buy a 1 day bus ticket from Kyoto Station, which let's you get any JR bus or city bus. Buses will be your main transport around the city.",

We also had the same dilemma as you but we decided to just explore one side of Kyoto and save the other side (i.e., Arashiyama and Kinkakuji) for another trip. \n\nWe swapped Kinkakuji for Ginkakuji and don't regret it all. It was a beautiful walk and relatively peaceful despite the crowds. And instead of Arashiyama, we went to Kiyomizu-dera since it's easily accessible from Sannenzaka. So our day was Fushimi Inari (we didn't go the whole way because of how packed the day was but honestly I've seen photos and don't think it would've been worth it anyways),  Ginkakuji, Sannenzaka, and Kiyomizu-dera. We left Osaka at 6:30 and didn't get back until around 8, and we only had one proper meal that day before we got back to the hotel. It was a huge day and honestly idk if I would pack a travel day like that ever again lol.",

Hope there are no kids / elderly / mobility limited people / phototaking enthusiasts in your travel party.\n\nShinkansen doesn't help much since all of these places require further onward transportation from Kyoto station. I also doubt the van is worth it, it's probably more expensive than a few strategic taxi rides.\n\nI would do some variant of the following. You can swap around the order of Fushimi Inari or Sannenzaka depending on how much you care about shops being open. Kinkakuji has the most restrictive hours so watch the clock as you plan.\n\n* WAKE UP EARLY\n\n* Train to Kyoto, transfer to local train to Fushimi Inari \n\n* Walk up a bit for vibes, I don't think the view from the top is anything to shout about especially considering how much more you want to do on this day, but going early + walking up for 15-30 minutes more will let you experience the torii gates in peace \n\n* Train back to Kyoto station, taxi or bus to Sannenzaka, walk up Ninenzaka and visit Kiyomizudera. All the shops should be open by this time and window shopping is fun, but watch the clock to make sure you depart for Kinkakuji well before closing time \n\n* Taxi to Kinkakuji\n\n* Taxi or bus to Arashiyama bamboo grove, which is tiny and only takes 15 minutes\n\n* Train to Kyoto station\n\nAvoid wasting time on cafes or sit down lunches, gulp down something from a convenience store to maximize touristing time.",

I'd save Arashiyama for another trip and concentrate on seeing the big 3 Kiyozumidera, Kinkakuji, and Fushimi Inari. seeing these 3 in a day is quite doable if you plan for a long day. If you're looking into a taxi service just book a day tour via Klook or JTB Sunrise that a full day tour of Kyoto. It'll include bus transportation to the sites and you can choose pickup in Osaka or Kyoto. \n\n[https://www.sunrise-tours.jp/en/plan/detail/260SUWTA001NG009S/](https://www.sunrise-tours.jp/en/plan/detail/260SUWTA001NG009S/)",

After that you could move to the other temples that are bunched together near Ninenzaka. \n\nRemember that most of the temples close by 5pm, so you can be on your way back between 6-7 pm.",

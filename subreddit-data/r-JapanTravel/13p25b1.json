    "postText": "Hi. This will be my first solo travelling experience and the first time I\u2019ve had to plan a trip myself. For context I am 18 male, loves anime and Japanese culture. More nerdy and interested in technology and more modern cities but I feel I still want to spend some time in rural areas and more traditional areas. Also want to see some shrines but not hundred so I feel. Went to Japan before but for the rugby world cup so didn\u2019t see many places in Japan. have been fortunate enough due to circumstances to have enough money to visit Japan. Will be going in august. Have had trouble with itinerary and what to do as there is a lot in Japan I have found out. Here is my itinerary atm but is flexible as atm nothing is booked. My budget is \u00a33500 max not including flights but flights in these days will be about \u00a31000 so have \u00a32500 for stuff when there.\n\n\nPlan \n1st august - arrive in Tokyo 12:50 pm\nGet to accommodation and explore a bit around accommodation(find food and stuff)\n\n2nd august - visit shinjuku first half of day and then shibuya in the second half of the day\n\n3rd august - visit senso ji and the area around it. Then visit akhihabara for most of day\n\n4th august - harajuku, ginza second half of day\n\n5th august - ikebukuro first half and then in second half anything I missed and wanted to do\n\n6th august- get to Kyoto visit fushimi inari shrine\n\n7th august - visit Arashiyama and Sagano\n\n8th august - Nara day trip return back to Kyoto evening\n\n9th august - visit higanshiyama and then some free time\n\n10th august - gion and then train to Osaka \n\n11th august - visit dotombori and Shinsekai\n\n12th august - njigen no mori day trip(Naruto) then take a train to Nachi kasura \n\n13th august - bus to start of Daimonzaka trail do hike to nachi falls and surrounding area then take bus back and either trian to osaka and go to nagayo in morning or go straight to nagayo in morning from nachi kasura\n\n14th august - train to nagayo, nagashika spa land. Evening train to nagano\n\n15th august - visit snow monkey park and Nagano broadway, train back to tokyo\n\n16th august - visit odaiba and then spare time\n\n17th august - spare day in Tokyo to complete anything else\n\n19th august - come back \n\nHave a spare day to fit in anywhere if needed. Haven\u2019t decided what to do with it yet. Have decided to keep it fairly loose as want to see what I like when I get there and explore more instead of booking a bunch of stuff in advance that I have to do.\n\nIf you have any advice or criticisms of my itinerary or recommendations for other stuff I should do in the time please let me know. Also if you have any advice on things like jr pass, how to find good cheap acommodation, where can I store luggage between places and luggage holds maybe, icoca card please as am quite confused atm with it all\ud83d\ude02.\nThank you for your help.",

We just went earlier this month and spent around that on food and lodging, staying in Ryokans &amp; business hotels (think travelodge), some michelin starred meals in there too.    \nWith your budget I'd recommend trying out some 3000-5000 yen quality wagyu yakiniku (self grilled meat). It would cost 5x more in London.   \nI stayed in Ueno, nice, close to Akihabara &amp; Tokyo station, convenient yet not pricey. Ameyokocho for izakaya needs.",

The city is worth a visit just for that alone, I live here and I love it.   \n\nIt's not that food is bad here, it's just not cheap and I don't think British cuisine is that great.  \n\nUnlike East Asia there's also not a prevalent 'cheap eats' culture. Even a very average fish &amp; chips costs \u00a310-20 per portion nowadays, which translates to 1700 to 3400 yen. For that price you could literally be sat down having a much more delicious katsudon meal for 2, or wagyu yakiniku in Kyoto/Osaka.  \n\nIn fact Michelin Bib Gourmand has a couple of decent restaurants. I'd recommend Kiln, but it's kinda silly as it's South East Asian food that you could get for much cheaper in SEA or EA.",

Leave space in your suitcase to make it easy to travel, but also so you can do a shopping spree on your final days in Tokyo. \n\nI\u2019d almost recommend changing your schedule around and saving Tokyo for last if you like shopping. I\u2019m not a huge fan, but I\u2019ve occasionally picked up trinkets here and there that caught my eye and not having to carry them around for multiple weeks is pretty nice. \n\nI like that you\u2019ve got some flexibility in your schedule, sometimes it\u2019s nice to unwind and just explore local parks rather than constantly being on the move.",

The train ride is nice because you get to see a rural part of Japan. The rice fields surrounded by mountains is beautiful. Be sure to check the website of the ninja museum to make sure that they are doing a ninja show on the day that you visit.",

First cabin has very big capsule room, it is basically a hotel room with no lock and private bathroom, and it costs like 4K yen? Very comfy and recommended.

It is pretty much osaka's akibabara (and cheaper merchandise too if you want to buy anime related).\n\nIf you like technology, try bic camera. Biggest one in yurakucho (near ginza), but the one on akihabara also very big. I spent almost an entire day in akihabara one. Mostly looking for model kit, toys, and headphone. They have like 50+ headphones you can try, and that felt good, trying headphones with no worries\n\nSome optional suggestions:\n\nHow about kobe day trip? Go to kobe herb garden then to kobe harborland to eat kobe beef and anpanman museum (not sure if you know anpanman, that thing is old).\n\nHakone is near tokyo and it is inspiration for tokyo 3 in evangelion\n\nUniversal studio?

Check Expedia, booking.com, etc\u2026 and you can find ample options.\n\nI strongly suggest that you plot everything on a map so you know how far things are from one another and from train stations.\n\nFor JR pass - google JR pass calculator. You can plug in your trip and it will tell you if the pass is worth it or not. \n\nLuggage storage - you can use lockers at train stations. Assuming luggage is normal size. There is also luggage forwarding services available at hotels. \n\nGet a IC Card. You can lick it up in Tokyo and use it in Kansas region. You will need a IC card in addition to JR pass (should you get one). If you have an iPhone, you can add suica to your wallet. Google it. As far as I know, if you add too much , you cannot get the money back. Please do confirm this. You can also use your IC card for payment in various stores, vending machines etc\u2026",

This will be my first solo travelling experience and the first time I\u2019ve had to plan a trip myself.\n\nI don't want to be rude, but if you want to travel alone and it's your first big trip.\n\nConsider maybe taking someone with you. And delay it for next year perhaps.\n\nTraveling with someone is less stressful. Maybe there is Facebook or something for that idk. Or ask your closers friends.\n\nAlso if you have any advice on things like jr pass, how to find good cheap acommodation, where can I store luggage between places and luggage holds maybe, icoca card please as am quite confused atm with it all\ud83d\ude02. Thank you for your help.\n\nJR PASS-Solves problems at JR stations. You just enter ticket to get in and to get out. You make reservation on Trains with that.\n\nNavitime app is must have.\n\nYou can store luggage in coin lockers. But most hotels unofficial allows to hold luggage before your check in. But ask hotel in booking app.\n\nYou can buy pasmo/suica cards but there is max limit that you can charge it its around \u00a3100. But its not needed. You check Navitime app to your destination. And buy tickets that are listed here.\n\nAnd my advice is only neccesary things to make space for buying alot souvenirs.\n\nBut as i told early. My honest opinion is. Chillout for this year. And plan it for early april when sakura will be blooming in Tokyo with any friend you can get.",

I've written. \"Traveling with someone is less stressful\" idk how you translate into that.\n\nIn my case i would not like the trip. Sometimes its very nice to communicate and exchange thoughts and cover your back. Yes traveling alone have own benefits but i would recommend it for experience travelers.",

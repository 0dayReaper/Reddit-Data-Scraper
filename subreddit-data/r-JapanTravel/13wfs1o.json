    "postText": "Hi guys, as per title, I got the basic studio pass for me and my partner online from the official website and received the ticket with the QR code beforehand. I have also downloaded the USJ app for purpose such as the map of the park, getting the timed entry ticket, observing the wait time etc.\n\nWe went to the entrance at 7.40am and it is already full of people queuing at the entrance. There were a lot of school kids and I am wondering if that weekend is like a school trip week which will cause more crowd in the park. The gate opened at 8am as opposed to the opening time stated which is 9am, so it is true that the park will open earlier that the stated opening time most of the time.\n\nWhen inside, I tried to grab the timed entry ticket for Mario World/Harry Potter but it seems not possible. So we just walk in the Mario World and looks like we are in without the time entry ticket! We proceed to the KoopaChallenge and we were one of the first. It was a fun ride and definitely the better of the two from Mario World. At this point of time the timed entry ticket are starting for grab in the USJ app starting from 8am and 9am. We went to  YoshiChallenge after and it was around a 30 mins wait by that time. After that we had our stop at Toads Cafe which got handed a ticket which state the time for us to come back for our turn to queue. \n\nHarry Potter did not need a timed entry ticket at all the whole day. However the wait time for the  rides seems longer than Mario World when compared at the same time. Seems like HP still hold its popularity or it is because no timed entry ticket needed. Hippo wait time was 80 mins and the other one was 90 mins. We had our lunch at the restaurant in HP which have a good view of the castle if sitting outdoor.\n\nWhat surprise me is the wait time for the Hollywood Dream ride is even longer than NMW and HP! No one mentioned about this online and the average wait time shown is always longer than NMW and HP in the USJ app. The queue time is 95 mins for the ride and that was our last ride. When we are done, the line is already close for the day except the single rider which still shows a 95 mins wait time lol.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nRides in sequence\n\nKoopa Challange - Almost no wait time\n\nYoshi - 30 mins\n\nBreakfast at Toads Cafe\n\nHippo - 80 mins\n\nThe other HP ride - 90 mins\n\nLunch at HP restaurant\n\nHollywood Dream - 95 mins\n\nShopping and taking pictures in between without rushing\n\n**Best ride:** The other HP ride\n\n**Worst ride:** Yoshi\n\nFor travelers on a budget, it is possible to do all NMW and HP rides and one or two other rides depends on how eager you are. I think express pass is definitely needed and justifiable on weekends and public holidays. Enjoy USJ!",

Maybe I went after dark and had a nice view, or in fact I\u2019m pregnant so it\u2019s one of the few rides I could enjoy. I didn\u2019t really play the game looking for eggs on the ride though. Just looked around and enjoyed the scenery.",

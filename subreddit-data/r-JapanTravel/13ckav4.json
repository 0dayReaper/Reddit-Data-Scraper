We aim to focus on a split between just experiencing the cities, visiting shrines, museums, japanese fashion stores and eating as much sushi as possible. Trip is from 16th of October to 2nd of November. We're splitting Tokyo up with a two-day trip to Hakone to not get too overwhelmed by the city all at once. Also, we want to finish in Tokyo on the last day so the trip to Haneda is not too long before our 16-hour flight home.\n\nAre we stretching ourselves too thin over the 18 days? We have a hard time weighing the wish to see as much as possible with avoiding spending most of our time in a train or station.

Plus, you dont have to waste precious hours switching hotel midway in Tokyo and the travel time. That is easily adding 1 day back to do something else.",

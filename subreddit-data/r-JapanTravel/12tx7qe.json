    "postText": "Hello!\n\nSo I got a non traditional question to throw out there. I currently live in Japan and am planning a trip in a month or so to Okayama to photograph the trains on the Hakubi Line, specifically the EF64s and 381 Series. The goal is to spend 3 full days along the line from Okayama to Yonago. I will have my own car for transport. Through trains are the goal, I wouldn't mind a quick detour or two to see some new sights. Does anyone have any recommended places within a few km of the line, between the two cities, that are worth a visit? Thank you!",

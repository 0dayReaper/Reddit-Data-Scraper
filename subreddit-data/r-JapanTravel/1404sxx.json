    "postText": "Hello! So I'm set on going to Kamakura for 1 day from Shinjuku.\n\nI plan to leave Shinjuku at 7:30AM, and am expecting to arrive in Kamakura Station at 9AM? I also saw there are hiking trails, but maybe I prefer just the ones you can easily walk nearby so the day won't be too tiring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are the temples I saw from research:**\n\n* Kita-Kamakura - Engakuji, Tokeiji, Jochiji, Meigetsuin!, Kenchoji\n* Kamakura - Tsurugaoka!, Hokokuji!, Jufukuji\\*, Myohonji, Ankokuronji\\*, Zeniarai!, Sasuke Inari\\*\n* Hase - Kotokuin\\*, Hase!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ones with \"!\" are the ones I hear are must sees, while the \"\\*\" are those I often see suggested. I understand I can't visit all in 1 day if I want to take time with each one. Need help narrowing down the highlights and also the most convenient (next to each other).\n\nI'm leaning towards most of Kita-Kamakura and Tsurugaoka in the morning, Komachi for lunch, then Hase from 1-4PM. Would I still have time for Enoshima after too?\n\nThanks!",

For me - Hasedera and Kenchoji are the defining places to visit in Kamakura, Meiegtsuin is definitely a must in hydrangea blooming season.\n\nTsurugaoka Hachimangu is a very big temple, but otherwise very generic and Hokokuji is too far out to be realistically done during one day trip.",

I used to go to Kamakura all the time when I lived in Tokyo and took friends round \u201cthe sights\u201d numerous occasions and we always went to Hokokuji because the bamboo forest and match tea house are so lovely.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to walk up there just get the bus, it\u2019s really not as far as people make out.\n\nI would do a hike on a separate day personally as if you\u2019re not familiar with the area it can be easy to take the wrong path and take much longer than anticipated. It\u2019s not as popular a hiking area as Mt Takao for example.",

Not very convenient location, but rather special.\n\nSasuke Inari - worth to visit if you go to Zeniarai as it's very close. Sort of mini Fushimi Inari.\n\nKotoku - it's mostly about the bronze Buddha rather than the shrine itself. If you're not interested in massive ancient sculptures, OK to skip (but the Buddha surely is impressive given the age of it).\n\nHaven't been to others you mentioned. \n\nKamakura has some cool cafes, workshops, galleries and the beach is pretty nice too.

Unless you're cycling/driving or taking taxis everywhere and not doing anything else. Probably I would choose either more inland area (Kita + central Kamakura) or more seaside area (Hase + central Kamakura), but not try to cover everything. Kamakura has plenty things to do for a day, even a full weekend.\n\nAs for connecting other places to a Kamakura trip - Enoshima, Zushi (for beach), Jogashima + Misaki. These are near, but hard to do in combination with Kamakura on the same day. Other more significant locations for tourism not that far are Hakone, Atami, Kawaguchiko.",

Here's a link to the Wanderlog itinerary, scroll to the bottom for the day trip to Kamakura: https://wanderlog.com/view/jpkcmhizdt/a-thematic-guide-to-tokyo/shared\n\nAlso side note my favourite place in Kamakura/Hase was the Goryo Shrine, followed closely by Kamakura Hasedera. They're right next to each other so you can go to both. \n\nGoryo is a little shrine, secluded and unlike the others doesn't ask for an entrance fee, so it feels more authentic. They have a resident cat and the Enoden train goes right past the shrine so you can wait for it to take some nice photos. I also bought my goshuincho from them as the embroidered cover featured the shrine, the cat and the train. You need less than half an hour here.\n\nKamakura Hasedera has beautiful grounds that have little lakes, gardens and an area with small ancient Buddhist caves. If you go there make sure you go all around the temple complex as I almost missed the caves when I walked by too quickly. The hydrangeas there are currently at 50% bloom and look beautiful. 1 to 1.5 hours here is more than enough.",

I wish I'd done that too!\n\nWith the buddha you pay a larger than normal entrance fee, walk in and see a huge outdoors buddha. There's no other shrine or cool architecture to see. When I went, it was surrounded by tourists getting their pictures taken with it. I thought the whole thing was geared towards tourists more than anything.",

I'm not sure how many temples you want you to see but after two (Engakuji and another one I can't remember which was much smaller), I no longer wanted to see any other temples as temples aren't really my thing. \n\nWhat I did was get off at Kita-Kamakura, go to Engakuji which was right next to the station, walk to Kamakura station and went to another temple on the way. Near Kamakura station is Komachi street which I thought was a nice street with a lot food/shopping vendors. From there I walked to Yuigahama beach which was good.",

Then Zeniarai and finally walked my way to Tsurugaoka. From there, I would actually say walk back to Kamakura. You want to use a specific street, when you exit Tsurugaoka, there is the main big street, this one is ok, but the best is to cross the street, turn right and continue to the next street on the left (the main street in front of the shrine will turn right). That street is full of stores and restaurant where you can buy food and eat it outside (you usually want to eat standing next to the place where you buy the food as many places have sign asking to not eat in from of their store, plus you usually have trashcan at the restaurant or return trash to them). You might not have time for either Kita-Kamakura or Enoshima. If you want to do those, plan 2 days for Kamakura.",

It was really cool and not really on my radar before we got there. . We stayed about a 10 minute walk from the bridge over and spent a couple hours making our way to the top. \n\nIn Kamakura we ended up only going to Hasedera and Kotoku-in. Kotoku-in was really cool just with the age and size of it. We had just come from several days in Kyoto and Nara so we were a bit Templed out at that point but really enjoyed just walking around Kamkura and checking out some of the cafes, shops etc. It was really cool  as it has such a different vibe than anywhere else we had been with the beach and surfers.",

Then walk back, take the tram to base. Visit the big Buddha and maybe hasedera if you have time. Go back to the tram and continue to enoshima. Walk to the island and explore. Then take a train back to Tokyo from enoshima. Have lunch wherever you like and looks good to you. There\u2019s lots of good places around. Feel free to ask for more suggestions if you\u2019re looking for something specific.",

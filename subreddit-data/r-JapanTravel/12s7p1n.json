    "postText": "Hi! I'm going to Tokyo and Kyoto for a week and would love some advice on if there are any must-sees I'm missing, and if there are days that feel too heavy or light. I may have overbooked, and if so will definitely trim down \u2013 I'd really like to allow time for discovery and wandering.\n\nAlso would love recs for a cooking class in Kyoto (restaurant recs always welcome as well!)\n\nAbout me:\n\nI usually try to avoid tourist traps (but I definitely made some exceptions) and I'm not big on Instagram photos, etc. I'm into immersive / cultural experiences, and I'd love to learn more about customs, philosophy, meditation and the language while I'm there. Really into film, folk / ghost stories, and matcha. Also Spirited Away, Animal Crossing, Sailor Moon, and One-Punch Man.\n\nIt's also worth noting that I'm athletic and hike frequently. Thanks so much for reading.\n\n# TOKYO\n\n**DAY 1 \u2013 (Shinjuku)**\n\n* Flight lands in the afternoon\n* Check in to hotel\n* Shinjuku area / Golden Gai for dinner\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**DAY 2 \u2013 (TeamLab, Joypolis, Sumida City, Shibuya)**\n\n* TeamLab Planets\n* Tokyo Joypolis\n* Meeting a friend around the southern Sumida City area in the early evening\n* Shibuya nightlife / dinner\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**DAY 3 \u2013 (Ueno Park, Tokyo Station, Shinkansen to Kyoto)**\n\n* Ueno Park / Tokyo National Museum\n* Tokyo Station / Explore &amp; lunch\n   * *Is there anything in this general area that's worth seeing before I hop on the train to Kyoto, if I'm able to?*\n* Shinkansen to Kyoto\n\n# KYOTO\n\n* Pontocho Alley / dinner\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**DAY 4 \u2013 (Northern Kyoto) \u2013** *I haven't been able to crack this day.

Also the areas of Akihabara and Nakano Broadway will be great for merch. Alternatively keep an eye out for any Suragaya stores or Hard Off/Book Offs for good quality second hand goods\n\n- Sailor Moon - Aside from the shops above there\u2019s a literal Sailor Moon store in Laforret Harajuku. You might see about a restaurant or cafe that are Sailor Moon-themed but unfortunately both are permanently closed\n\nHope this helps!",

I'm bummed but I don't think I'll be able to make it to the Ghibli Theme Park or Museum \u2013 both are just a little too far out of the way with my short time frame. I have heard there's a Ghibli store on Character Street in Tokyo Station though!",

    "postText": "Hi all, currently in Tokyo after the first few days of my trip (best vacation of my life already) \n\nI have booked a hotel in Gora in Hakone for tomorrow (payment has now been taken so no longer refundable) and I had already booked the Romancecar so I am now locked in to visit. \nUnfortunately the forecast as the week has gone on has switched to showers and for significant portions of the day. \n\nIf I had the ability to switch my plan, I would have based on other visitors suggestions,  however because I am now committed, can I get an itinerary or at least some ideas for a plan B so I can try to enjoy my time there in the off and on rain? Appreciate its not ideal however I have to do my best with it. \n\nAlso, the original plan was to get the Free Pass on the assumption I'd be doing the loop. I havent bought this yet. Should I still do so? I wanted to do the loop and Amazake Tea house.\n\nAny help appreciated!",

Plus I dont know if parts of the loop become very muddy and difficult to walk if its rained? Im sorry I have never visited and don't know what to expect the terrain to be (i.e. Is it all paths and so it doesn't matter, or is it on the other end of the scale and itll be like a muddy mess!)",

I love an onsen in the rain and at a nice place with several baths, lounging space, etc I can easily kill a couple hours.",

The saison was my favorite and the staff was incredibly friendly, who I made fast friends with! I ended up meeting a ton of foreign travellers as well. \n\nBut yeah, as others have said, definitely try to find an outdoor bath where you can enjoy the rain. Not sure about this, but you might be able to find an outdoor supply store to pick up a trustworthy rain jacket if umbrellas aren't your thing. I'm sure you would have a much better opportunity for a clear picture of the torii gate on lake ashi on a rainy day when less tourists are out. Enjoy! Not a day goes by that I'm not daydreaming about being back in Hakone.",

The naked ones are mostly outside, but I actually find sitting in an onsen in the rain sort of nice.  It helps balance the heat of the water.  (Though sitting in the snow in an onsen is even better!)\n\nI've been to Hakone in the rain, We didn't do the route between Gora and Moto Hakone, because my daughter is deathly afraid of heights and I didn't think could manage the ropeway.  (Owakudani was also closed for volcanic activity, so it seemed pointless and I hate the pirate ship.)  We took a bus to get to Moto Hakone from our hotel and the fog coming in off the lake was splendid.  It made everything looks very mysterious.  We did go to Hakone jinja, which I thought looked nice in the rain, and since this was June all the hydrangea were in bloom and looked stunning.\n\nIt was a quiet day, but sometimes those are nice.\n\nGood luck!",

I have also been to the bathing suit and naked zones.\n\nIt's fun.  It's not \"authentic\" and yet it really is because it reflects a more modern Japan.  I love the random extra themed onsen.  My first visit was themed on Keroro Gunsou and I swear looked like (and smelled like) an onsen full of Palmolive dish soap.  In February 2020, it was the much more normal chocolate. lol\n\nBut yeah in general theme parks rock in the rain.  I've done Disney Sea and USJ in the rain, and would highly recommend the experience.  I do mostly go to Japan in June now, so rain is mostly to be expected.

For example the cable car was just surrounded by mist (literally could not see more than 10 metres so it felt a little silly). The Old Tokaido Road was also pretty nerve racking as the wet cobbles made it really easy to slip.\n\nThe big positives for me was the boat ride and going up on deck (even in the rain there is covered sections, and the weather meant less people). What happened with my cruise was that everyone took their seats on the lower section and gradually filtered up to the deck to have a better view. It was lovely with the mist. \n\nAnother highlight was Amazake Tea House which felt like a really authentic experience. I sat up by the burning fire with my drink and food. Quick tip though, the place gets really smoky with the open fire, so if you want to avoid getting smokey smell in your clothes and hair, id go take a look at that part and maybe take a seat closer to the door.\n\nThirdly, the onsen was incredible and I would highly recommend it if you have already been doing the typical heavy-walking Japan itinerary as a way to reset your body for any future travels. \n\nTo be honest, although the plan wasnt ideal because of the horrible weather, it has actually worked out as a really good 'rest' day and I would treat it such when you go. I feel relaxed and recharged for the next leg of my trip and Im getting a fairly early night tonight to catch up on sleep for more heavier itinerary days coming up.",

I booked it for its convenience as it was simple to drop bag off during the Gora leg of the loop (this was back when I was really planning out the itinerary however I unfortunately couldn't predict the weather)\n\nIts been a great stay",

I still enjoyed the visit because the main reasons I went there were the nice ryokan that I stayed at and the onsen. If you\u2019re doing both of those things, I think you\u2019ll still have a great time. If not, maybe skip it. The romance car ticket was like $10 when I bought it so not much of a sunk cost there.",

Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* For travelers entering the country on or after April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)). The COVID/quarantine section of Visit Japan Web has been removed.\n* Tourists entering Japan should still have their Immigration process and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration and a QR code for Customs, which can smooth your entry procedures.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

I'm interested in visiting the (physical) Nintendo store in Tokyo but I checked their Twitter and it seems they're implementing some sort of ticketing system if they anticipate busy days. Given the new Zelda game is coming out next week, does anyone have any tips or can share their experience about how this usually works? It looks like there are separate lines for when the building itself is open vs after? We have limited time (~3days or so) in Tokyo so I don't mind waking up too early to line up, but not if it takes me until midday to get in-- might just order online if that's the case, but it seems a pity not to go when my timing is perfect for TotK. \ud83d\ude02 I'd also appreciate any heads up about collabs for the game (I know Lawson has one already)!",

We certainly going to talk with our agent for this, but there's this idea from one of my family member that we could book an earlier flight/bullet train from Osaka to Haneda/Tokyo, and just continue from there (Haneda -&gt; Jakarta). However I\u2019ve tried to do research that it _doesn't_ work like that\n\nThe answers I found, although I'm not fully sure, suggest that if you don't use the 1st leg on a connecting flight, the entire flight will be invalid\n\nAgain, we will definitely hit up our travel agent for this, but what do you guys think about that?\n\nDoes the airline going to cover you if you can't make it to the other flight due to the previous one? (Fine as is) \n\nOr\n\nShould I reschedule the flight back even though it (potentially) has a rescheduled fee and a price hike?\n\nWould appreciate any kinds of thoughts, would be nice to have more informations :) thanks!",

Broadly, our travel plans are:\r  \n\r  \nLand at Narita, spend 1 night in Tokyo\r  \n\r  \nTokyo to Kawaguchiko, spend 2 nights in Kawaguchiko\r  \n\r  \nKawaguchiko to Kyoto, spend 3 nights in Kyoto\r  \n\r  \nKyoto to Osaka, spend spend 3 nights in Osaka\r  \n\r  \nWe were wondering if the JR Pass is still the most economical option to bring us from place to place, especially since it appears that the JR Pass does not exactly cover transport to and from Kawaguchiko -Tokyo/Kyoto.\r  \n\r  \nFor travel from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko, is the Fuji Excursion Express train or highway bus from Shinjuku a better option? If we get the JR Pass, I know that part of the train trip would be covered (Shinjuku to Otsuki), while we have to pay for Otsuki to Kawaguchiko.\r  \n\r  \nFor travel within Kawaguchiko, I know that there is a 1,500 yen 2 day pass for the sightseeing buses. I can\u2019t seem to be able to purchase this pass online - is it only available physically at Kawaguchiko station at the ticket booth?\r  \n\r  \nFor travel from Kawaguchiko station to Kyoto, is my best option to take a Fujikyu bus (not covered by JR Pass) to Mishima station and take the Shinkansen (covered by JR Pass) to Kyoto? This is the part of the journey I\u2019m most unsure about in terms of making advance reservations and being able to make the connection in time.\r  \n\r  \nFor travel within Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, we are intending to just use the SUICA card on public transport. Still considering whether the Osaka Amazing Pass would be a good option.\r  \n\r  \nMuch thanks in advance!",

Go to Akihabara for dinner and wander around, then head to Skytree before it closes to see some night views. \n\nIf you can get up super early you can see Senso-ji before going to the airport.",

I'm sorry if it's a dumb question..\n\nSo, it's my first time to buy limited express tickets and reserved/bought them online. Without knowing first the ticket types, I bought both basic fare and reserved seat tickets for the limited express. Though, I already have an IC card and have been using it for local train lines. I could have bought the reserved ticket only and use my IC card for the basic fare instead, is this correct?\n\nBut anyway, I will be coming from local train lines to Tokyo station, using my IC card. Then I will be transferring to the limited express JR train. Do I then have to exit the gate first at Tokyo station to complete the fare charge on my IC, then enter again using the basic fare ticket?\n\nAlso, where is the reserved ticket inserted? Is it also inserted as I enter (again) or is there another gate for it?",

If both origin and destination stations are in the same IC card zone, then you can use IC card as basic fare. Otherwise, no, you need paper basic fare ticket.\n\n&gt; Do I then have to exit the gate first at Tokyo station to complete the fare charge on my IC, then enter again using the basic fare ticket?\n\nIf you basic fare ticket say \"Tokyo\" as origin, then, yes you need to go out and go in again. If it say \"Tokyo Yamanote Zone\" then you can use that ticket from any stations on or within the Yamanote Line. If it say \"Tokyo Ward Zone\" then you can use that ticket from any stations within the Tokyo 23 wards.\n\n&gt; Also, where is the reserved ticket inserted? Is it also inserted as I enter (again) or is there another gate for it?\n\nWhen in doubt, insert everything. The wicket will automatically sort and only pinch hole in relavent ticket(s). But you don't actually need to insert the reserved seat limited express ticket at all.",

My group and I are planning to be based in Kyoto and making a day trip to Osaka for the park - any recommendations for assuring that we will get a good Timed Entry Ticket for Nintendo World? Currently thinking about leaving the hotel by 6:30am, arriving to USJ at ~8am (1 hour before it opens), and trying to get the Timed Entry Tickets via app as soon as we enter the park. Does this sound alright? Should we leave earlier, or am I overstressing on this?",

The town itself is pretty small and you can see it in 1 day (has some nice Hida beef and some sake breweries). This would give you 2 days to explore the area. This could be a day trip to Shirakawago, a day trip to Kamikochi (maybe an overnight stay at an onsen nearby), or hiring a bike and exploring the countryside.\n\nIf I had to pick I would go for Takayama but it's only if you like that vibe. If you prefer cities and nightlife then you are probably better doing a short trip to Koya and putting the rest of your time to Tokyo/Osaka.",

I intend to go to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima and maybe Nara). I have a lot of places on my mind and Im afraid that time (or money) won't be enough.\r  \n\r  \nFirst of all, my budget is around 7000 - 8000 USD, including the ticket, which cost aprox. 1500 USD from my country (Chile). so my real budget in Japan will be around 5500 - 6500 USD, which must be paid for accomodation (hotel or airbnb), mobilization, tickets to attractions, food, nightlife and souvenirs.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe 'must visit' Im thinking are:\r  \n\r  \n'Geek' must visit places:\r  \n\r  \nTokyo: Gundam Base, Gundam Factory, Lego Land, DisneyLand/DisneySea, Akihabara.\r  \n\r  \nKyoto: Universal/Super Nintendo World, Toei Kyoto Studio Park.\r  \n\r  \nFukuoka: Gundam Park.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nNatural must visit places:\r  \n\r  \nAokigahara Forest, Mount Fuji (I dont know if the trekking yet), Shukkein Garden, Arashiyama Bamboo, Forest.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nContemporary attractions must visit places:\r  \n\r  \nTokyo Radio Tower, Tokyo Skytree, Hachiko statue (lol).\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nObviously I also want to visit as many museums, temples and shrines as possible (mainly in Tokyo and Kyoto). I also intend to do as much nightrlife as possible. (hopefully go out drinking/dancing every night). Considering the above, here are my questions.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\\- Will 21 days be enough?\r  \n\r  \n\\- Will my budget be enough?\r  \n\r  \n\\- Will it be worth buying the JR Pass? (considering the price increase)\r  \n\r  \n**- Considering my preferences, is there any interesting place that I am overlooking/forgetting?**\r  \n\r  \n\\- One day in Hiroshima is enough?\r  \n\r  \n\\- How many days should I distribute for each city?\r  \n\r  \n\\- In which city is the best nightlife for Gaijins?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy native language is spanish, and altought my english is far from being A1, I think I can communicate without problems, but I dont speak Japanase at all (except from some basic words). Considering the above.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\\- How difficult can daily life be if I dont know any Japanese at all?\r  \n\r  \n\\- How difficult can nightlifge be if I dont know any Japanese at all?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI would greatly appreciate any advice, info or opinion about my itinerary. The truth is that I have never traveled outside of my country and I am a little (a lot) nervous, scared and anxious about the complications that I may have in a country as different from mine as Japan is.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**I thank you in advance for reading my post.**",

Obviously in the US, we see tip signs or jars in pretty much any service industry, but I understand tipping isn't typically accepted in Japan (or it could even be considered rude).\n\nDoes this only apply to restaurants? Or does this apply to any service (e.g., shuttle services, private tours, etc.)?\n\nI'm taking a private tour in the Kyushu area and want to make sure I am a considerate guest and show my appreciation correctly. The driver most likely will not speak English, and I do not want to make the situation awkward or come off rude by tipping or not tipping according to the custom for this type of service.\n\nEdited for clarification.",

I understand customs are different everywhere and I just want to show my appreciation correctly. Google was not too helpful and getting first hand experience or knowledge is always appreciated. Now I know I can bring some meaningful souvenirs from home to show my appreciation. \n\nI'm not sure why this was down voted so much, but thank you to those who answered.",

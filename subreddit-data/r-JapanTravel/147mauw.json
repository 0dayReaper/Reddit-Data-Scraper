            "comment": "Treatment resistent UTI that is getting worse and worse is alarming as UTIs can turn into pyelonephritis. If you have a fever, I suggest going straight away to a hospital rather than a clinic.\n\nIf you've had previous treatment for it before and failed, you should ask them to culture and test the resistance. \n\nHope you get help soon!",

You can also try the Tokyo Midtown Clinic or the Tokyo Medical and Surgical Clinic (which are expensive but are designed for English-speaking expats who have private insurance). You'll need to pay OOP for treatment from wherever you go and can get reimbursed later if you do have insurance. Hospitals will be much cheaper.",

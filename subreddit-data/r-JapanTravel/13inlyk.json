            "comment": "Shinjuko Goen after 5pm looks unreasonable on day 1 as 1/ it us enormous and 2/ sunset will be at 5.08.   There are many temples open at night that are well lit plus night observation points instead perhaps.\n\nThe Metro Govt Building is free but does not have as spectacular views as the other observation decks.  I thought it was just OK but ymmv.\n\nIf you have a JR Pass the train journey will be longer than 2.15hrs as you cannot use the faster Nozomi but only by an extra ~20mins\n\nYour Alpine route plan looks sound as your aim is to hike rather than see the dam.  From Toyama will allow a faster start.\n\nConsider swapping Oct 19 and 21.  You could then go to Takayama at end of day rather than return to Kyoto.  You would then wake up in Takayama on Oct 22 rather than head there via Nagoya (again) in the morning saving you travel time overall.\n\nOn the JR Pass front prices will increase a lot before you arrive but there is a theory if you buy one in September you will still be covered in October as there is a period of validity. No idea if in fact this will turn out to be accurate\n\nI like your planning.  Should be a great trip.",

Would you recommend leaving them at lockers in Nagoya or forwarding them the day before? I know luggage transfer service can be quicker to big cities, but unsure about Takayama.\n\nAnd we\u2019re hoping that we\u2019ll be able to buy the JR pass in September before the price increase in October. We\u2019ll keep an eye on the situation.",

Queues here can be daunting, so unless you want to eat fast food for your whole trip I'd try to slot at least 90 mins for lunch and dinners.\nAlso, check the opening times of everywhere you plan to go.\nI'm pretty sure you won't be able to visit Shinjuku gyoen, as it closes by 18.",

            "comment": "I think lockers at Nagoya would be safe for empty lockers.  Have not been (going in November) but Google says it is the fourth biggest city in Japan.  I have read for smaller stations the staff will direct you to an overflow service if lockers all taken (costs more).  Perhaps do some Google searches on locker availability at Nagoya station to get a degree of comfort. \n\nI use luggage forwarding but would also be worried about getting it to Takayama in time.  I usually send it to a future city rather than the next one to be safe and travel light or send it days before I depart my current city.  Toyama may be a good bet as you have two nights there.\n\nTakayama is smallish in size but an extra 3 hours would not go astray as sunset will be just after 5pm.  Your current plan would be doable if leaving from Kyoto.",

    "postText": "I am planning a trip to Japan in the first half of November to see the autumn leaves. I was hoping to get a sense check for the Japanese alps part of the trip. I really enjoy hiking / nature and exploring  countryside areas. I plan to rent a car for that part of the trip - I know this will be more expensive than public transportation but value the flexibility and am okay with that budget wise. Welcome all recommendations, thoughts, suggestions! Thank you in advance!!\n\n***- Worth visiting all the locations listed in first week of November?*** Understand some of the destinations listed below will be past peak autumn or nearing the end. Any thing you would change about the itinerary? I'm not 100% convinced on Shibu Onsen given there will likely be no monkeys and it will probably be past peak autumn in Shiga Kogen, but thought it might still be worth a visit. \n\n***- Has anyone driven around the Japanese alps in early November?*** How was your experience? Was there any snow and do you need snow tyres? I'm used to driving on the left side of the road and am comfortable on mountain roads but don't have as much experience driving in snowy conditions. I've researched the scenic roads I plan to take and some close towards the end of the first week or mid-November, pending weather, so it should be okay (otherwise have made plans for alternate routing). \n\n***- Kinosaki Onsen - with my itinerary in mind, is it still worth going to as a side trip?*** For those who have gone, did you enjoy it?  \n\n**Tentative Itinerary** \n\n* **10/30 - Tokyo** \n   * Arrive in Tokyo in the evening \n* **10/31 - Tokyo**  \n   * Rest day / explore \n* **11/1 - Tokyo -&gt; Karuizawa -&gt; Kusatsu Onsen**\n   * Early morning train to Karuizawa\n   * Explore Karuizawa and pick up rental car \n   * Drive to Kusatsu Onsen in the early afternoon\n   * Stay overnight in Kusatsu Onsen\n* **11/2 - Kusatsu -&gt; Shiga Kogen -&gt; Shibu Onsen**\n   * Drive to Shibu Onsen via Shiga Kogen Kusatsu route\n   * Sora terrace / snow monkey park in the afternoon (only if there are monkeys) \n   * Onsen hopping in the evening \n   * Stay overnight in Shibu Onsen\n* **11/3 - Shibu Onsen -&gt; Obuse -&gt; Matsumoto**\n   * Drive to Matsumoto via Obuse\n   * Stop for apple picking / wasabi farm\n      * Alternative option: drive via Hakuba if autumn leaves still out / weather is good    \n   * Explore Matsumoto in the evening / stay overnight\n* **11/4 - Matsumoto -&gt; Kamikochi -&gt; Shirahone Onsen**\n   * Explore Matsumoto castle in the morning \n   * Drive to Kamikochi / take shuttle bus into park   \n   * Stay overnight in Shirahone Onsen\n* **11/5 - Shirahone Onsen -&gt; Takayama**\n   * Stop by Okuhida Onsen and/or Shin Hotaka (pending weather and if not onsen'd out)\n   * Drive to Takayama / explore (Hida Villlage)\n   * Stay overnight in Takayama \n* **11/6 - Takayama**\n   * Explore Kiso Valley (option 1) \n   * Relax day / rent bike and ride to Hida Furukawa (option 2)  \n   * Stay overnight in Takayama\n* **11/7 - Takayama -&gt; Shirakawa-go -&gt; Kanazawa** \n   * Drive to Shirakawa-go \n   * Drive to Kanazawa via Shirakawa-go White road\n   * Drop off rental car in Kanazawa \n   * Stay overnight in Kanazawa \n* **11/8 - Kanazawa -&gt; Kyoto** \n   * Visit Kenroku-en Garden in the morning \n   * Afternoon train to Kyoto \n* **11/9 - 11/12 - Kyoto** \n   * Bike rental / explore Arashiyama\n   * Nara day trip\n   * Osaka day trip\n* **11/13 - Kinosaki Onsen \\[TBD\\]** \n* **11/14-11/18 - Tokyo** \n* **11/19 - Fly back home!**",

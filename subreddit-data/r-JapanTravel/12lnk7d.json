(It was back when the Hokuriku line ended in Nagano.)  \n\nI flew to Hakodate and then slowly made my way south and then used the extra day to visit Nagano.\n\nThere was also once a 3 day JR East Pass priced the same as the Tokyo Wide except it covered Nagano itself and i want to say Sendai.",

It seems that we can\u2019t have nice things all the time. We could no longer do daily Shinkansen runs in our itineraries if that happens. On the flip side, hotels in smaller tourist towns and cities (like Gifu or Takayama) will have improved occupancies because of less rail kilometers traveled by tourists, decongesting the more crowded hotels in big cities like Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto.",

But the exchange location for JR Pass is getting more limited, and even when it's provided, it's limited to like 2 counter leading to very long line. *Unless you pay more to get the official version.*\n\nAs a side note, I was shocked when I buy JR West Kansai Wide Area Excursion Pass (basically Kansai Wide Area Pass, but only 3 days and foreign resident can use them too), and I was told that I can only reserve seats at manned ticket counter. I know JR West has technology to limit  the number of reservations on those pass even with automatic ticket machine, but they weren't using that technology on tourist pass.",

We were just using the Ise-Kumano-Wakayama Pass a few weeks ago, which also limits the number of seat reservations (4) and we could reserve at the automated ticket machines.

Some people sign up for these tours because they don't want to plan, or deal with challenges (navigating, language barriers). Others do it because it's an efficient way to see the top tourist spots. \n\nI'll admit to having rushed through places in the past. Usually because I'm more interested in seeing the sites of those places than experiencing the culture.",

However, what this will do is have fewer foreign tourists in places like Sendai, Gifu, Kobe, or any place that a foreigner wouldn't go out of their way to go to if they didn't already have a rail pass. Means tourism will be even more concentrated into places like Tokyo and Kyoto as tourists will just buy regular tickets to make the trip.\n\nCurious of how this will affect the Japanese government's tourism policies. Will they embrace it and try to concentrate foreign tourist into the usual areas and rely on their strong domestic tourism for everywhere else?",

Not sure if they'll eventually be affected by the price increase, but they're generally a little cheaper since they only cover, well, a specific region. You could either stack of few of those during travel heavy times, of get a shorter national pass and time it's start date for when you'll expect to travel most.",

So the price for purchasing the pass *after reaching Japan* between 2023.10.01 and 2024.03.31 remains the same as today's price (the non-exchange order version).

It made sense more than a decade ago, when Japan was attempting to draw international tourists in, but they\u2019ve come a long way since then. They basically don\u2019t need to offer discounted rates\u2014people will still come.\n\nThey have access to a lot of data on this too (number of JR Passes sold, number of JR Passes by country, what routes those JR Passes are being used for, etc.), so I can only assume they are acting on some solid info based on what they feel is best for profits.\n\nEven with the boom in international tourism this year, it\u2019s still a fraction of domestic tourism and regular business/leisure travel from Japanese people. I think from an outside perspective, it\u2019s upsetting, but to them, it\u2019s probably a tiny blip they are correcting in the revenue margins.",

First is the Smart-EX app. This is entirely in English, and you can get advance purchase and group (starting at 2 people) discounts on e-tickets for the Shinkansen between Tokyo and Kagoshima-Chuo. There are 3 day and 21 day advance purchase discounts. \n\nSecond is discount ticket shops. These are usually located in or near train stations. Look for the words \u201c\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u201d or \u201c\u91d1\u5238\u201d. They\u2019ll have a list of city pairs and how much they\u2019re selling tickets for. It\u2019s usually a bit less than 1000 yen off regular price for Tokyo to Osaka on a Nozomi train, and these can be bought day of departure except for holiday periods (Obon or New Year). There are also shareholder discount vouchers (\u682a\u4e3b\u512a\u5f85\u5238) for sale, around 1200 yen each for 10% off a ticket, but these only make sense for green car (where you save more than you pay for the voucher) and you can\u2019t use these across operating company boundaries (Shin-Osaka is the dividing line between JR Central and JR West and Hakata is the dividing line between JR West and JR Kyushu). Those shops also have discount tickets for local and short haul intercity tickets, including on non-JR operators.\n\nLast is Platt Kodama. You have to buy these at a JR Central Tours office (located in Shinkansen stations between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka) at least the day before departure or earlier and they provide a EDIT: 30% or so discount and a free drink on Kodama trains (the slowest ones). Tokyo to Osaka will take four and a half hours on a Kodama train so you\u2019re trading away time for money saved.",

At most, they'll start using the Nozomi a bit more rather than concentrating on the Hikari\n\nHowever, a lot if people that acquire the pass tend to go \"well, since I have this I might as well go and do...\" and choose somewhere outside the basic loop to go to. That's going to be cut short. So now those people will concentrate on the basic loop instead of branching out due to the jrpass\n\nAnd planes aren't easy as an alternative to trains\n\nEven if the airfare is cheaper, going to the airport involves more logistics and time waste than going to a train station. Even the cost to the airport is more than to a Trai station. You have to arrive much earlier to catch a flight. You waste more time going to and from the airport. There's the whole chore of check-in and the x-ray etc... trains aren't better just because they're cheaper. \n\nMost will still likely choose to take the train over a plane, they'll just cut down on places they'll go and concentrate on the basic loop",

I\u2019m using 2019 numbers here, but there were 35 million foreign tourists to Japan that year. Whereas there were nearly 700 million domestic trips made. And of those 35 million foreign tourists, a large portion of them aren\u2019t even getting a JR Pass. And of the ones that do, you can probably assume at least a decent portion are first-timers who were unlikely to do much more than Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka anyhow. So are they losing some opportunity to push people to new places? Sure. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much.\n\nUltimately, international tourism is very, very low compared to their domestic tourism industry. This is obviously a move to adjust revenue a bit for the rail companies in a tiny sector of their business.",

Some going as far north as Sapporo and far south as Kagoshima. This massively disrupts Japan's plan to move tourism outside of the traditional tourist centers. \n\nNo international travelers on a first time trip is going to go to Sendai, Kanazawa, Himeji, Okayama, or Hiroshima on a whim without the rail pass. I'm not saying this should be their only priority, but a massive driver in international tourism outside of Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka was the rail pass so increasing it's price will decrease tourism in other cities. \n\n700 million domestic trips has to include business travel to make any sort of sense, there's only 125 million people in Japan and not every man, woman, and child is taking 5.6+ trips a year, my wife's Japanese coworkers never travel that many times in a year. Business travel doesn't have the same economic impacts to each city as you get with tourists.\n\nI see this as Japan Rail trying to squeeze out more profit but at great expense to the parts of the country the Japanese government supposedly cares about helping build up. It'll take years of data to get a totally clear picture, but I can't imagine this being good for places within 3 hours or so of the Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka route. I could see tourism to more remote places like Hokkaido and Okinawa increasing if it's more expensive to get to Sendai than it is to get to CTS or OKA, but many people just will travel to fewer places in general.",

I\u2019ve been visiting Japan several times a year for the past decade, and I\u2019ve only gotten the nation-wide pass twice. My friends who are currently on their fifth trip have it for the first time right now. I know another friend who\u2019s gone twice and never gotten it. And we see tons of itineraries on here where it doesn\u2019t make sense to get it.\n\nSo certainly there are a large number of tourists who don\u2019t get it. Not to mention, 75% of the 35 million international travelers I mentioned above are Asian tourists, who might be taking shorter trips because they are close by. My point is that this subreddit is skewed toward thinking the nation-wide JR Pass is important to rail companies or a big impact on general travel in Japan, and it probably isn\u2019t.\n\nMaybe this will push people toward regional passes, which do tend to be good deals.",

We hopped on really early shinkansen from Tokyo -&gt; Shin-Takaoka station where we only had a short break before the bus came (the stop is right in from of the train station)  from there it was about 1-1.5h bus ride and we arrived around 10:30am...we stayed there till the last bus for Kanazawa departed...I think it was around 5pm...once there you will reach everything by foot...the heritage site isn't really all that big but there are also cool places 'outside' of it...like the pretty steep forest stairs that lead you down from the Observation deck...and then there is the whole 'normal' side of the village that isn't part of the heritage site that still include cool stuff if u are pilgrimaging Higurashi by any chance. Once you cross the bridge to the normal side of village you will find Daily Yamazaki convenience store that was super cheap (food stands were full of tourist so we found this really helpful since no one was there)...also public toilets that uses cold water from mountains. For my last tip, don't underestimate the weather...we went in Nov. too and it was really hot to the point I was walking around in just t-shirt still sweating pretty bad around noon but in second the sun went down the temperature went with it and it was pretty crazy how fast it went from sweating in t-shirt to shaking from cold in 3 layers of clothing...this one is general stuff for being in mountains but it was my first and I didn't really expect the swing to be that wild....anyway, sorry for essay, just dm me if u have any more questions.",

            "comment": "Unless they plan on increasing the single use tickets dramatically, I could see this backfire for them. Let me explain:\r  \n\r  \nA long time ago, Disney World (Florida) had a problem on it's hand. You see while tourists were flocking and filling up it's theme parks and hotels, they tended to stay away from the sit down restaurants located inside the parks. They found that families would prefer to save their money and eat at the fast food style restaurants instead. If they did eat at one of the sit down restaurants, they would usually order just a main entr\u00e9e and nothing else to save on cost. So one year the higher up's at Disney thought of a great promotion. They came out with a dining plan that for one flat fee per person per day, allowed you to go to the sit down restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Appetizers, entrees and a dessert were always included. There were other dining plans that were offered, but the most popular one was the one that included the full service restaurants for three meals.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAt first it was a win-win for everybody. Disney filled up their restaurants that most of the time sat empty during this slower parts of the day, and guest satisfaction for food service  was at an al time high. (A side note. The food at Disney used to be amazing !!! I\u2019m talking about imported butter from France, desserts that would match a  Michelin star restaurant.  sadly that is not the case now with all the budget cuts) But something happened a few years later. Disney being Disney became greedy and started  to increase the cost of the dining plan.  At first it was only $5 or $10 a year per person per day, but  once Disney saw how  hugely popular the program was they started to increase it by $15-20 every year. Not only that, but as the  Dining Plan increased in price, the cost per meal  relatively remained the same  except for very small increases throughout the years. \r  \n\r  \n This caused a negative effect for the dining plan. You see people's mindset changed after the prices started to increase for the dining plan and not so much for the meals. While before someone would normally just order only a single entree at the restaurant, now they wanted a full three course meal so that they could  justify  paying the high cost of the dining plan. To them, \rin order to get the full value of their dining plan, they would  purposely order entrees and  desserts just because. This caused a major problem for Disney. Not only was there  restaurants packed throughout the entire day  upsetting guests that were not on the Dining Plan, but servers were also upset as most of the people on the dining plan tipped less then those who were paying cash. Year after year the  problem became so bad that in 2020 when the parks were closed due to covid, they  eliminated the dining plan altogether.  While there are  rumors that it will come back one of these days,  nothing  concrete has come about. \r  \n\r  \nI could see the same thing  happening to the  Shinkansen. I could just see some  tourists want to make the most value of their  higher priced pass and justify taking the bullet train sometimes when a local train could get you to the  destination as well. Or you might see more people taking day trips on the Shinkansen instead of remaining in one city just to justify to themselves that they needed to make the most value of their pass. For me, I don\u2019t care for the 20k yen increase. There is something pure magic that the Shinkansen offers that a plane can never do. For one, I  absolutely love the feeling of  going straight from the street to the train in just a few minutes without the  headache of going  through security or needing to be at the  airport two hours before the flight takes off. Picking up a freshly made Ekiben and sitting down while the  countryside flies by is simply  priceless to me !",

I worked for airlines most of my working life.\n\nHowever the extra cost of the pass is significant. We've used the Shinkansen quite a bit when we've traveled and if we are stung with the extra expense, you can bet we'll wring every bit of value out of it we can. You wont get me off it.",

Six months is very short notice for international travelers, a lot of which have already booked/decided on flights/hotels/etc. This really sucks.\n\nPersonally, I really wish JR had increased the price in stages, rather than a massive amount all at once. Phasing something like this in over the course of 1-2 years would have allowed for less of a shock. It feels like really poor timing, since we've had less than a year of Japan's borders being fully open. Sorry for such an upset post, but this all just feels bad.",

In my last trip I almost got the Tohoku East pass but switched to JR National pass since some people in my group wanted to go to Kyoto as well.\n\nHopefully they maybe just wanted to reduce the number of Hikari trains and have more Nozomi trains for the Tokaido Shinkansen? I noticed the Noxomi is always packed with local travelers.",

My plan had been to purchase online directly from JR so I could book seats for our travels since we will be starting over the New Year holidays.\n\nI need some advice here, is it still possible to purchase the pass directly from JR and use it beginning 28 Dec and booking seats in advance? Or do I need to go through third party if I want to pay the lower price and then lose the ability to pre-book seats?\n\nIf the latter, can I purchase seats individually in advance for cash? Or will I have to wait until we get there to book them?",

Consecutive travel is sometimes too tight of a plan for me, especially when half a day is usually needed to travel larger distances.",

No idea what that ultimately means yet, but if that includes say discounts on hotel reservations or attractions then that would absolutely affect the value of the pass at its announced price. They've already put work into incorporating online reservations into the pass, so extending that to stuff like hotels doesn't seem like a huge reach.\nI think the hand-wringing is a touch premature, the topic makes it sound like it's remaining a transit-only pass which doesn't seem to be accurate to the official statement.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nFor the past few weeks, I've been learning about Japan's history to prepare for my trip. \n\nI would like to visit history museums to enrich my knowledge. I'm more interested in the Early Japan to the Edo Period. I would like to know which museum you would recommend me! If possible in Tokyo, but I will also go to Nagoya, Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Kyoto and Osaka so anything around there is good for me too. I can't read in Japanese, so if possible museums that are English-friendly.\n\nI've found online these three museums:\n\n* Kokuritsu Rekishi Minzoku Hakubutsukan \n* Tokyo National Museum \n*  Kokugakuin University Museum  \n\nAre they good for what I'm looking for? How long does it take to visit them? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!",

It's huge, it's got a lot of archaeological ruins and re-creations.  Not too much in English but it's still a fun place.  And, one of the best museum cafe/cafeterias around!\n\n\nThe Kyushu National Musuem is fantastic as well.  It's a new building and has a great display of samurai swords.  It's in Dazaifu, and you can pair that with a visit to Tenmangu Shrine.",

These volunteers will explain the museum exhibits, which mostly comprise the houses and shops of Tokyo in the 1920s and earlier. On a larger scale, there is the Edo Tokyo museum that is similar to the Shitamachi but it covers a much longer scope of time. \n\nAnother pair of museums to see are the Yushukan, a war museum and the Showa Memorial museum, a museum about Japanese daily life during and after World War II. These last two should be seen as a pair because they offer a really interesting contrast. The Yushukan is somewhat controversial because it whitewashes the military exploits of Japan throughout the early 20th century. Even so, it is still interesting.",

The reenactors in Yoshinogari usually just speak Japanese, but the older man at the handcraft exhibit at some point suddenly switched to English and gave me a pretty thorough explanation. Many museums also have the possibility to scan QR codes next to the exhibits for multilingual descriptions.\n\nIf you're interested in Japanese history, Fukuoka City Museum shows regional history through the ages. For Kumamoto, you'll probably visit the castle, so there'll be a few things within walking distance:\n\n* The pseudo-historical \"castle town\" Josaien also contains the interactive Wakuwakuza Castle Museum (I heard you can even rent traditional clothing, but I didn't try it). Generally a great place to pick up food from the many small stalls and buy souvenirs, and you might even catch a bushi reenactment performance.\n* Kumamoto City Museum also focuses a lot on regional history, from the earliest ages to modernity.\n* A bit of a niche tip and most useful as a unique souvenir shop, but the \"Kumamoto Prefectural Traditional Crafts Center\" has a small exhibit on local crafts on the top floor. When I was walking around, a staff member came up to me and handed me an English language pamphlet with thorough explanations of the different art and craft styles.",

            "comment": "As Tokyo is a newly developed city by the Edo Shogunate, there are few museums about pre-Edo period history.  \nUntil Sengoku period, the political centre was in the Kinki region. So, many temples and shrines in Kyoto and Nara have a political background. Also, the Mozu Tombs in the south of Osaka would be like an outdoor museum of the Kofun period.  \nKyushu also has a long history, especially Fukuoka, as a gateway to the Korean Peninsula and China.  \nI therefore recommend the following historical sites.\n - Nijo-jo Castle (Meiji Restoration), and other temples and shrines in Kyoto (Heian - Sengoku period)\n - Uji Byodoin (Heian period: Fujiwara clan)\n - Horyu-ji temple (Nara period)\n - Daisenryo Kofun (Kofun period)\n - Dazaifu Tenmangu and Dazaifu headquarters (Heian period), and Kyushu National Museum",

Each section have over 50 audio clip of about a minute each to explain the display. So yes, get there early ne you can spend most of the day there if you listen to the whole audio guide.\n\nIt start with prehistoric Japan and up to recent time, it does not especially focus on samurai and conflict, so if that is the part of history you like, then maybe not the one that would have the most focus on that.\n\nFukuoka City Museum is also great and of course Tokyo National Museum in Ueno.",

Most of the exhibits are replicas, but they are effectively arranged to give an overview of Japanese cultural and social history. With a lot of dioramas and architectural models, it\u2019s enjoyable for people without much knowledge of Japanese history. The place is huge and you can easily spend a whole day.\n\nThe Tokyo National Museum is also worth a visit, but in an opposite way. It houses a lot of historically significant authentic artifacts, but they are collected purely from the experts\u2019 point of view and displayed without much context, just sorted by period and genre. The Regular Exhibition may take up half a day, depending on your level of interest.\n\nThe Kokugakuin University Museum is much smaller than the other two. It has a nice display of archaeological objects, but I think it\u2019s smaller than the archaeology sections of the TNM. You don\u2019t need more than an hour there. Admission is free, so it\u2019s great for local residents and students, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a destination for a first-time tourist.",

Sakura City, castle site, lunch at anywhere in the historic district\n\nDay 2 p.m.  samurai quarters, Tsukamoto sword museum, and Hota Tei/Sakura Garden.",

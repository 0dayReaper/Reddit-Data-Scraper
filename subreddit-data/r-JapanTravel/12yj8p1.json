And why would you ever travel to a new city to only spend 2 hours there ?\n\nHonestly at this point I'm hoping it's a parody of super packed itineraries",

And unfortunately, I can\u2019t do cancellation without a refund so I just have to go there.",

I would send you the link to the [timetable](https://www.seibubus.co.jp/docs/rosen/karuizawa/eki.pdf) but the website is down right now and it is fully in Japanese so I could send the link after the website is up again. I think the only interesting part of the hotel is the Onsen. Would you suggest cancelling the booking for a better trip?",

Are you potentially confusing Nagoya with Nagano City? \n\nUnless spending a whole day to go to a secluded part of the mountains sounds good with you, I would call this a mistake and cancel it. If you're not cancelling it, you would need to move things around, probably include an evening in Karuizawa after, then Karuizawa -&gt; Ashikaga -&gt; Narita the next day. For a first-time visit to Japan I personally wouldn't find it worth it.",

I feel you won\u2019t be able to enjoy each sight thoroughly. Why not skip Nagoya this trip if you don\u2019t have anything planned and you can only spend two hours there? Seems to be a better use of time if you can spend an extra day in Kyoto or Tokyo. As it stands right now, over half your trip is gonna be spent on trains and busses. Hope this helps!",

Lots of food stalls and food related shopping to do there. It\u2019s near Ginza so those could be done in a morning/noon timeframe. TeamLabs is also popular and pretty nifty IMO despite the recent mixed reviews on this subreddit. Shinjuku area is lovely as well and Meguro has a bunch of good food. \n\nWhile Tokyo is more city, Kyoto is more cultural with the various temples to visit. Kyoto has a lot more to do and see and would be worth spending an extra day. You have Arashiyama area which is a half day/full day itself and you have all the various temples which could take multiple days to see. Fushimi inari and Nara will probably take up most of a day to visit. Definitely worth doing a bit more research here!",

No point in wasting a day or two to save money. You either waste money or time and in this instance I would value time more. Everyone is different so give it some thought. I definitely did some dumb shit and wasted money but I still had a great time.\n\nAs others mentioned, getting around is time consuming. Japan\u2019s public transportation is great but expect to still spend time. Me and my wife would wake up around 6:30 and wouldn\u2019t be at our first spot until 8:30 or so. Buses usually run late so they may cause delays. The subway and trains are a lot better.",

You might wanna add more days to your trip or cut some areas out.\n\nPersonally, with 7 days, I would just chill at Tokyo or do just Osaka/Kyoto/Nara (with Osaka being my base and using a JR pass for bullet trains to get to Kyoto in under 25 min). Way more doable.",

            "comment": "I guess my question is do you normally pack your vacation schedules wall to wall and if so, do you enjoy that? Even if you do I think this schedule is ambitious. If you normally don\u2019t enjoy a hectic schedule, this vacation schedule will run you ragged and you won\u2019t have time to enjoy anything. For multi-city vacations I recommend three to four nights in a city. Two nights is an absolute minimum. Even with bullet trains you will be spending half of each day traveling. I understand wanting to pack in as much of Japan as possible on a first trip but vacations should be a little relaxing too. I just did my first Japan trip and I ran myself a bit ragged doing two night stays in several cities. For this trip I would just do Tokyo and Kyoto. Get a hotel either in the area you want to explore or at a train station that will get you where you want quickly. Remember to check restaurants and events that require advance reservations. You can\u2019t roll up to Kyoto and book a same day tea ceremony, I saw many other tourists begging for a time slot. \n\nOften many restaurants that receive notoriety will be packed and need reservations. That\u2019s not a problem, there is plenty of great food everywhere. I think I had only one mediocre meal while in Japan.\n\nThings like the Torii gates at the Inari shrine and the temple at kymizudera are best enjoyed early in the morning (like 6 AM early) as other tourists will flood the place in short order. \n\nGood luck!",

I have secured a spot at the tea ceremony but I will also look for reservations at restaurants. If you don\u2019t find it troublesome, do you have any must try restaurants in Kyoto and Tokyo? \n\nI will definitely visit these places earlier! Thanks for the tips!",

                            "comment": "Gosh there was just so much good food. My wife did a lot of the restaurant finding, some had tourists others had seemed like they received no tourists at all. Google Translate photo is surprisingly good with even handwritten menus (it does have more trouble). Expect more of the general idea of the item being ordered, but that was good enough. I would say there are really no \"must eat at this particular restaurant\". A good place to start is [Tabelog.com](https://Tabelog.com) , basically Yelp but with an entire focus on Japan. It has an english interface but it is not quite as user friendly but there is a map feature.  Anything with like a 3.0 rating and up will be very good to excellent. 4.0 and above ratings are much more rarer on this site than 4.0 ratings on Yelp. I would look for stuff around places you are visiting rather than go out of your way for a particular meal. Everything we had was excellent. I recommend trying to find restaurants that specialize in foods from different prefectures, which would be easier to find in Tokyo. Street food at Nishiki market in Kyoto is about the only thing I'd say is a can't miss. Just go and graze up and down the market.",

And it\u2019s most certainly an all-day activity - I do certainly recommend that if you\u2019ve got your heart set on it, but don\u2019t try to start at Fukui. Toyama is the starting point at the Western end. I did it myself in April back in 2018 (unfortunately before they opened up the Snow Wall walk to pedestrians - it was buses only the week I went).\n\nAs for leaving Narita at 8am, I\u2019ve never done that myself, but I did leave from Haneda at 8:40 earlier this month. At Haneda, the check-in counters don\u2019t open until 6am, and all the restaurants don\u2019t open until 8am (though there was a cafe and a 7-Eleven open on the air side). Whether that\u2019s also applicable to Narita, I have no idea.",

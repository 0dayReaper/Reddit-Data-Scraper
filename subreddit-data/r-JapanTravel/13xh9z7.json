    "postText": "Hi all, i have a month trip to Japan and i am going in August I wanted to see the Nagaoka firework festival on the 2nd but I have no idea how to go about getting seats. I tried to do it online but I need a Japanese phone number; when I searched a bit more I found out I need to get them at the convenience stores around May. Is there anything I can do to secure a paid seating; if not are there locations where I can still see them without being by the river bank? Thanks!",

As for the Shinkansen I have the Jr pass already and if I were to scratch my idea of driving I would be using that to do it (i know I\u2019m not guaranteed a spot on the Shinkansen and I still need to reserve it tho!)I did try to look into the English tours but i couldn\u2019t find one that was a reasonable price. But I\u2019ll try to look at more locally run websites other than trip advisor thanks though!",

I do know they asked for people to not do street parking since it could interfere with locals. So I\u2019ll also keep that mind thanks for the help!",

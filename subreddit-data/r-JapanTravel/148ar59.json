    "postText": "Hi, me and my friend would be going to Japan for 2 weeks in October. I have been to Japan before (Osaka and Tokyo) but it is the first time my friend is going. We aim to see most of the things Japan have before the JR pass increase in price :). My friend is into anime and gundam which is reflected in our Tokyo trip. The itinerary feels ambitious, but because we both young we thought why not make the most out of it lol. Do you guys think any of the route doesnt make sense or any place should be removed? \n\nFor the sunrise overnight train, we plan to get the cabin. So my understanding, I book through the JR west website 1 month before for just the cabin (non-base fare) and then when we reach Japan we go to JR west counter and show our reservation +our JR pass. Do let me know if I missed any step!\n\nDay 1-7 based in Osaka, day 8-10 based in Fukuoka, day 11-14 Tokyo\r  \n\r  \nDay 1 - Reach Osaka 9am -&gt; Osaka Castle, Nishinomaru Garden, Osaka Museum of History -&gt; Denden Town -&gt; Namba\r  \n\r  \nDay 2 - Nara (park and temples) -&gt; Fushimi Inari Shrine (climb and see sunset) -&gt; Umeda\r  \n\r  \nDay 3 - Kyoto: Kinkakuji, Genbu Shrine -&gt; Kyoto Imperial Palace -&gt; Nijo Castle -&gt; Kyoto Manga Museum -&gt; Kyoto National Museum -&gt; Kiyomizudera temple, Higashiyama -&gt; Gion\r  \n\r  \nDay 4 - Osamu Tezuka Museum -&gt; Universal Studio\r  \n\r  \nDay 5 - Ise (outer, inner shrine, meoto iwa) -&gt; Nagoya (atsuta shrine, nagoya castle)\r  \n\r  \nActivate JR pass\r  \n\r  \nDay 6 - Himeji (castle, kokoen garden) -&gt; Kobe (chinatown, Great Kobe Bridge &amp; Kazamidori no Yakata, Port Town) \r  \n\r  \nDay 7 - Amanohashidate (walk along the sandbar, cablecar)\r  \n\r  \nDay 8 - depart to Fukuoka (Ohori park, Fukuoka castle ruin, Shofukiji temple, Canal city) -&gt; Dazaifu (temples etc, is it worth?)\r  \n\r  \nDay 9 - Hiroshima (castle, Shukkeien garden) -&gt; Miyajima (try to catch both low and high tides to see the torii) -&gt; Hiroshima (Peace park, Atomic bomb dome)\r  \n\r  \nDay 10 - Nagasaki peace park -&gt; Atomic Bomb Museum -&gt; Meganebashi Bridge -&gt; Sofukuji Temple -&gt; Glover garden -&gt; Oura Church -&gt; Dejima -&gt; chinatown -&gt; go to Okayama to take the sunrise train \r  \n\r  \nDay 11 - reach tokyo at 7am -&gt; drop luggage at asakusa hotel -&gt; nikko (shinkyo bridge, shoyoen garden, rinnoji temple, toshugu shrine, taiyuinbiyo temple, tamozawa villa, botanical garden, kanmagauchi abyss) -&gt; akihabara\r  \n\r  \nDay 12 - Inagi Naganuma station -&gt; Fujiko F Fujio museum -&gt; yokohama (chinatown, cup nodle museum) -&gt; shibuya shopping -&gt; odaiba to see giant gundam\r  \n\r  \nDay 13 - asakusa (kaminatimon, sensoji temple, asakusa shrine) -&gt; shinjuku -&gt; nakano broadway -&gt; tokyo skytree -&gt; Seikado Bunko Museum -&gt; Sumida Hokusai Museum\r  \n\r  \nDay 14 - free day, flight at night\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA :))",

Just your Day 8 you have a couple hour trip from somewhere to Fukuoka then seeing 5 things.   And you are missing the Gundam at LaLaPort mall here in Fukuoka for your friend...\n\n&gt; Day 8 - depart to Fukuoka (Ohori park, Fukuoka castle ruin, Shofukiji temple, Canal city) -&gt; Dazaifu (temples etc, is it worth?)  \nDay 9 - Hiroshima (castle, Shukkeien garden) -&gt; Miyajima (try to catch both low and high tides to see the torii) -&gt; Hiroshima (Peace park, Atomic bomb dome)  \nDay 10 - Nagasaki peace park -&gt; Atomic Bomb Museum -&gt; Meganebashi Bridge -&gt; Sofukuji Temple -&gt; Glover garden -&gt; Oura Church -&gt; Dejima -&gt; chinatown -&gt; go to Okayama to take the sunrise train\n\nThis section makes no sense.  2 days before this you are in Himeji.  Then you go down to Fukuoka, back up to Hiroshima then back down to Nagasaki.  The order should be Hiroshima to Fukuoka to Nagasaki so you are not wasting hours on the train.",

I mean... it's not impossible, but you wouldn't!\n\nTo OP:  No giant Gundam in Fukuoka? Might as well compare to the Odaiba one. It's just a short bus ride from Hakata station.",

The constant go-go-go gets old really quick. Day 11, for example, sounds pretty brutal, especially after getting off a morning train. There\u2019s a lot of walking there. Just be careful, because everything might not be as close to each other as it seems, so I\u2019d highly recommend making a map on Google Earth or something so you can me easily prioritize your adventure.",

            "comment": "&gt; general comment The days are very packed and seem to not consider operating hours. For instance on Day 3, Kinkakuji opens at 9am and Kiyomizudera closes at 6pm. So you want to see 7 attractions + eat lunch within 9 hours, not even considering travel time (intra-city transport in Kyoto is very slow due to buses + congestion).\n\n&gt; day 5\n\nOsaka -&gt; Ise takes forever on JR, you'll want the Kintetsu train. In any case, Ise Jingu is culturally very significant but visually average, so you can decide if you want to spend the time on it or not.\n\n&gt; day 9\n\nFriendly reminder to check the tide tables for the day that you are going to ensure you can see both high/low tide and also achieve the gazillion other things you want to do in Hiroshima proper\n\n&gt; Castles\n\nYou are going to way too many castles (Osaka, Himeji, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Nagoya) - one is more than enough unless you are collecting stamps or super into their history.\n\n&gt; Chinatowns\n\nIs two Chinatowns (Kobe, Yokohama) really necessary...tbh I am of chinese ancestry but I would think one is more than enough, they're pretty much all the same",

But hey it's my partners dream to go see this stuff...\n\nI love ghibli too, thinking of just searching and hiring some expensive tour package to secure our tickets for all 3 just to have peace of mind and not panic over this.\n\nIt made more sense to me when I realized the grounds are kinda huge and open to all visitors, but each of the three places is an enclosed exhibits, two open air and the warehouse being totally enclosed and fine to see even on rainy days.\n\nThen you ALSO have the totally Seperate Ghibli museam in Tokyo, but that's also hard to get too.",

Easiest to get on the international website.\n* Dondoko forest - famous gibli houses/buildings walking on a forest/clearing paths, my neighbor Totoro settings are heavily featured. Usually easier on the Japanese language website\n* Hill of Youth - minute houses that you can look inside the windows but can't go inside much. Must see if you are into Whisper of the Heart. If you are busy or tired probably the easiest thing to skip. \n\n*As it stands, a full day is enough to check out the park's Ghibli activities. The Hill of Youth and Donboko's Forest normally take less than an hour each, even if you take your time. Grand Warehouse will depend on the queues, but set your mind on a half a day. If possible, schedule the fastest zones first so you don't have to leave the Warehouse in a hurry for another activity. In a few years, there will be five zones in the park, which may require a two-day visit. In the meantime, it is also possible to do it in two days (perhaps even inevitable depending on availability when buying tickets) with time to explore Moricoro Park too.*\n\n*Two areas of the park have not yet opened: Mononoke's Village and Valley of Witches (focused on Kiki and Howl's Moving Castle). There is no doubt that these will include more immersive constructions.*\n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/we-visited-ghibli-park-and-this-is-what-we-saw\n\nThe forest seems cool as you can wander outside to some beautiful buildings themed after and attempted to look  like 1x1 replicas. The other hill of youth seems more like miniature houses that you can't go inside. I have not been there, just watched youtube videos to get a better understanding.\n\nIt seems like if you can only pick one other than the warehouse, you should pick the forest, but you can still see some of the most famous buildings from a distance. You will struggle to acquire the Dondoko forest ticket.",

The inside also feels more themed/cozy. I enjoyed the displays more too. The cafe is also much better at the museum. The gift shop was also better at the museum. They had so much more sticker choices and such. Also the theater is so much cooler at the Museum than the one at the Park. The one at the museum has the rotating sun/moon thing like in Spirited Away. The tickets are so much cooler at the museum as well. The warehouse felt super crowded and I couldn't really enjoy it.",

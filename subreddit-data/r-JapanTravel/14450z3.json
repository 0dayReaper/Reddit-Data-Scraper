    "postText": "As we all know the coming changes to JR Pass will likely make the nationwide pass obsolete for all, but the most cunning (or very niche) visitors - we foresee changes to the way people approach to Japan with increasing focus on staying in the cities, which enable them to make a full use of regional passes, or to take advantage of many day trips.\n\nWe'd like you to share your ideas for using those hubs to the fullest for short-term and medium-term tourism-related stays, including your ideas for itineraries, day trips, eating out, entertainment and just having a general fun all around.\n\nToday we'd like to discuss Tokyo, which is the largest city in Japan, the place connecting all the shinkansen lines, as well as having the two largest airport serving international visitors (**Haneda Airport** and **Narita Airport**). It's also a host to numerous downtown districts and the largest concentration of restaurants on the planet.\n \n|**Info Panel**|**Tokyo**|\n|:--|:--|\n| Main transport hubs | Tokyo, Shinjuku, Shinagawa, Ikebukuro, Shibuya, Ueno |\n| Airports | Haneda Airport (train, limousine buses), Narita Airport (direct train, limousine buses) |\n| Entertainment districts | Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, Roppongi, Shimbashi, Akihabara |\n| IC card | Pasmo (major), Suica (major) |\n| Peak season | Hanami season, Late July to Early September | \n| Day trip destinations | Yokohama, Kamakura, Enoshima, Hakone, Kawaguchiko, Karuizawa, Nikko |\n\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

            "comment": "My list of possible day trips out of Tokyo is immense (and note that some of those are better served by an overnight stay):\n\n* Ibaraki's coastal area gives you: Mito with Kairakuen, Hitachi Seaside Park, Oarai\n* Mt. Tsukuba is I feel fairly underrated hiking and autumn foliage destination\n* Tsukuba (city) itself can be interesting for space buffs with JAXA exhibition there\n* petrolheads will probably find their way to Motegi (best via rental car) and Honda collection there or Nissan Factory Tour in Kamiamo\n* Oya History Museum (subterrenean cave/quarry) is on my shame list\n* Nikko area contains multiple destinations from the standard historical/nature ones (Nikko, Lake Chuzenji) to somewhat dated onsen resort (Kinugawa Onsen) and Edo-themed amusement park (Edo Wonderland)\n* Echigo-Yuzawa (and via connecting buses some hikes and Triennale destinations) is seriously underrated outside Gala Yuzawa's skiing season\n* Minakami area, Kusatsu, Ikeho Onsen are some of possible onsen day trips that are especially popular during summer\n* Tomioka silk mills are on UNESCO's list of World Heritage as an industrial era site\n* Karuizawa is both good for quick ski trip in winter and for multiple nature sights (Onioshidashi Volcanic Park, Usui Pass)\n* a trip to Nagano (Zenko-ji, Togakushi-jinja) or notorious monkey park with nearby onsen is also not out of the question\n* Matsumoto has one of the original classical Japanese castles and in summer you could combine it with a visit to Suwa Taisha, or you could do a Lake Suwa fishing trip\n* Fuji Five Lakes and Hakone are famous areas of natural beauty and Mt. Fuji views\n* Chichibu is great for hikes, a rural area almost touching Tokyo and a place with significant number of anime-relate sights\n* Atami, Ito are another pair of easily reachable onsen destinations\n* Odawara has a nice reconstructed castle and multiple nice festivals throughout the year\n* Numazu, Zushi, Enoshima contain easily reachable beaches (and Enoshima is much more than beach resort)\n* Kamakura contains great many temples from when it was a political centre of Japan\n* Yokosuka (Battleship Mikasa) is a great for military history buffs\n* Yokohama is the second biggest city in Japan that contains something for animal lovers (Zoorasia), garden lovers (Sankei-en), aquarium lovers (Hakkeijima), foodies (Chinatown, Motomachi)\n* Sawara does good examples of showing you an Edo era town\n* Omiya is a must visit location for railway (Railway Museum) and bonsai tree lovers\n* Kawagoe is a nice historical town good for a day out\n\nNot too mention even more amuseument parks (Fuji-Q Highland, Moomin Valley) or sights in actual Tokyo Prefecture.",

Gyu tan goea without saying.\n\nOsaka should be obvious for several reasons, but it's fast enough for a day trip.\n\nJust managed Nagoya the other day, which included Kishimen, miso Katsu, and a trip into Iga for some Ninja culture.\n\nthere is a lot that can be done even with the 6 changes to the JR pass assuming youre willing to make a lot of day trips.",

            "comment": "The best things about Osaka (from a tourist perspective) are it\u2019s shopping, food and nightlife. I\u2019m getting the feeling from your post that the latter two aren\u2019t necessarily huge priorities but you specifically mention shopping and included specific areas for that so it might be worth making that the focus of your time in Osaka and just pick whatever sightseeing spots are of interest to you and nearby (you don\u2019t mention which area you\u2019re staying in but I\u2019m gonna assume it\u2019s at least somewhere inside the loop line). Getting around in Osaka is very easy and most of the attractions on your list are not too out of the way. \n\nIn my opinion the only can\u2019t miss place in Osaka is the Dotombori. Especially at night. Even if you have no interest in nightlife or drinking or whatever it\u2019s a great and fun atmosphere to just go for a little while and take it in. Everything else in the city is completely optional as far as sightseeing goes. The castle, the aquarium, Sumiyoshi Taisha, even USJ are all basically fine but not spectacular. I lived in Osaka for ten years and it\u2019s my favourite city in the world but as a sightseeing destination it\u2019s honestly not that great. You\u2019ll be seeing more interesting things in Kyoto and Nara. I\u2019d recommend using your time in Osaka to focus on shopping, eating, doing fun big city things like going to game centers or maid cafes, people watching and seeing whichever sights are of particular interest to you. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth my favourite place on your list is actually Abeno Harukas which is pretty near Tsutenkaku and the Tennoji area is in general just kind of fun with good Kushi Katsu.",

I couldn\u2019t put places to eat yet because my companions and I don\u2019t like waiting for hours to just to get a seat at a popular restaurant. We can\u2019t also go out to drink because my mom is joining.\n\nWe were thinking of taking photos but will take note of that. We are staying near Shin-Imamiya station.",

If you are planning to go for the history or the view from the top then by all means, but if you're only interesting in the castle aesthetic it's better to just take a photo outside and leave.",

                            "comment": "The park isn't \"nearby\" is IS the castle grounds. The castle keep is lovely, I made a point to go in because I do like history and the view from the top of the keep is incredible. But the rest of the grounds is the castle park, and there's no charge to just stroll around and take pics. If you don't care about history, the one reason to still make it a destination is if you've done a lot of city stuff and need a breather, just an hour or two being outside somewhere pretty with no schedule to keep and no real worries about crowds (early enough in the day, esp on a hot day, you can avoid the tour groups and school field trips just by finding a less popular yagara turret or site-of-old-stuff area to hang out by).\n\nOn the one hand, due to proximity you can do the castle and Umeda Sky/everything in Umeda in one day, or even half a day if you're not one to linger anywhere. Everything Dotonbori, Nanba, and Shinsekai are close by so group those. If you really want to shop, then yeah, rolling down Shinsaibashi, popping a block over to the large Donki, and then checking out the food and shopping options down Dotonbori to Ebisubashi is a great bet. We spent our \"dead day\" on arrival doing just that, super casual and even found an excellent okonomiyaki place that had no lines or reservations.",

Super Mario World got busy by 10 and there was almost no room to move around. So, I'd suggest getting there at least an hour early to try and beat at least some of the crowd.",

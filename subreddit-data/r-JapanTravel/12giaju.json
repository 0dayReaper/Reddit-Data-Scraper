    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first time visiting Japan and I started making plans just over a month ago based on the leave allowance I had at my workplace. \n\nBelow is the breakdown. I am interested in photography so would really like to be in certain places in the mornings and evenings; hence I have mostly planned that. I need guidance on what I can do apart from that. Also please suggest places to eat.\n\nArrival in the evening of April 15 at Osaka Airport and then head over to Kyoto.\n\n**Day 1** \nMorning/Afternoon: Visit Arashiyama Bamboo Forest early morning to beat the crowds and take pictures. Later visit the Kameyama Park, Kimono Forest and Tenryui-ji.\nEvening: Visit Kiyomizu-dera temple for pictures and then go to Nishiki Market.\n\n**Day 2**\nMorning: Visit Kinkaku-ji temple in the morning for pictures. Visit Nijo Castle after that and then go to see Kyoto Manga Museum.\nAfternoon/Evening: Explore Gion area and then spend evening taking pictures of Yasaka Pagoda.\n\n**Day 3**\nDay trip to Nara to see Todai-ji temple, Nara Deer park and Naramachi area.\n\n**Day 4**\nDay trip to Hiroshima to see Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, Hiroshima Castle and spend evening taking pictures of Itsukushima Shrine.\n\n**Day 5**\nVisit Fushimi Inari Shrine early morning.

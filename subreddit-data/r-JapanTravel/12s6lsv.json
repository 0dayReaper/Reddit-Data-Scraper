    "postText": "**Dates and accomodation:** Oct 22nd \u2013 Nov 3rd. The dates aren\u2019t really flexible due to work reasons, which unfortunately means missing out on some pretty cool matsuri and holidays. We\u2019re thinking about staying at APA Hotels in each city, any experiences with them? Our day itineraries are flexible and we can shuffle them around according to the weather and how we\u2019re feeling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:** we\u2019re a Finnish couple in our 30s and decided to go to Japan for our honeymoon! I\u2019ve been to Japan once before, my fiance hasn\u2019t. My last trip over ten years ago was very much a check-all-the-boxes kind of a guided tour where we rushed from one place to another. This time, we want to take our time and wander around, get lost and peoplewatch. We\u2019re interested in everyday life, history and culture as well as gaming. We\u2019re fine with eating at random restaurants and cafes. I\u2019m allergic to peanuts and can\u2019t eat too much eggs/dairy products per day but otherwise no food restrictions. I\u2019ve studied Japanese and can read kana and basic kanji as well as speak very basic conversational Japanese, my fiance can\u2019t. We\u2019re working on him knowing some very basic survival stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 0 \u2013 Finland to Osaka**\n\n* Fly from Finland to Osaka KIX\n* Get ICOCA at the airport?\n* Get to our hotel in Osaka and check in\n* The name of the game is to survive the worst of the jetlag and then crash for the night\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1 \u2013 Osaka**\n\n* Get to know the neighborhood\n* Doutonbori\n* Shinsaibashi\n* Umeda Sky Building observatory\n* Pok\u00e9mon Center?\n* Tenman-guu?\n* Vegan okonomiyaki! Last time I had to skip eating okonomiyaki due to allergies, but vegan choices make this now a possibility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2 \u2013 day trip to Kyoto**\n\n* Fushimi Inari Taisha all the way to the top\n* Philosopher\u2019s path or some other somewhat low-effort thing depending how our feet are feeling\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3 \u2013 day trip to Kyoto**\n\n* Nijo-jo\n* Philosopher\u2019s path?\n* Gion/Pontocho?\n* Nishiki market?\n* Heian/Yasaka-jinja?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4 \u2013 day trip to Himeji**\n\n* Himeji castle\n* Koko-en\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5 \u2013 Osaka to Hiroshima**\n\n* Check out and maybe forward our luggage to Tokyo?\n* Train to Hiroshima and check in\n* Hiroshima Peace Memorial museum\n* Peace Park and Dome\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6 \u2013 Hiroshima/Miyajima**\n\n* Miyajima and Itsukushima-jinja\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 7 \u2013 Hiroshima to Tokyo**\n\n* Check out and take a shinkansen to Tokyo\n* Get Pasmo/Suica?\n* Check in and wander around the neighborhood, see the sights around our hotel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 8 \u2013 Tokyo** (I\u2019ve dumped everything here but we can totally split these for several days depending on how we\u2019re feeling. Most of these aren\u2019t set in stone in any case so any recommendations are welcome! Also, please let me know if I misplaced anything in the wrong ward/part of the city)\n\n* Shibuya\n   * Hachiko\n   * Shibuya crossing\n   * Sailor Moon store?\n   * Nintendo Tokyo\n   * Meiji-jinja\n   * Yoyogi-koen?\n* Taito\n   * Senso-ji\n   * Skytree?\n   * Nakamise-dori?\n   * Ueno-koen? (either this or Yoyogi perhaps?)\n* Shinjuku\n   * Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for the view\n* Pok\u00e9mon Center Mega Tokyo? (if we didn't go to the Osaka one)\n* Koishikawa Koraguen-koen\n* Kappabashi?\n* An arcade\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9 \u2013 day trip to Takao-san**\n\n* Hike on Mt Takao\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 10 \u2013 Tokyo**\n\n* Wandering and getting lost, checking out anything we missed or want to go back to\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 11 \u2013 Tokyo to Finland**\n\n* Check out, cry and get to Narita airport for our flight back\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was looking at getting us JR Rail Passes, but it looks like the price hike won\u2019t do us any good so we might have to drop those. At the moment I\u2019m thinking about getting us ICOCA due to the trip\u2019s first half being in Kansai, then switching to Suica/Pasmo when we move over to the Kanto region. Does that make sense or should we stick with only ICOCA? Should we be looking at something else completely? \n\nIs there something obvious we\u2019re missing out on? We\u2019ve been reading the sub and taking notes and feel pretty good about our rough itinerary so far. Thanks for the help!",

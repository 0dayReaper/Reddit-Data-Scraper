    "postText": "Hi everyone! I've been planning a trip to Japan for a while now, and I am happy to say that I will be going in about a week! Below is my itinerary, I'd appreciate it if anyone had any critiques and/or recommendations, as well as any things that I may have missed. I didn't plan out every day to the dot; I'd rather go around and explore and find new things.\n\nI've got a few questions, as well:\n\n* Does anyone know any nice seaside-view resturants in Odaiba?\n* I missed the reservation for Kichi Kichi Omurice; is there any way I can still go?\n* Am I able to cover up my tattoos and go into an onsen?\n* How badly does it rain in June?

I will be using the 7-day JR pass for this trip, activating it on June 15 for when I leave to Kyoto. I was stupid and forgot that I'm actually leaving Osaka on the 8th day, so I'm unable to use my JR pass on the way back to Tokyo. It's fine, I'll just buy a one-way shinkansen pass.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI don't mean to be rude, but yes, if a place has up a big sign in multiple foreign languages or says on their website or both anything along the lines of what you posted:\n\n*\"Admission is strictly prohibited to persons having, regardless of the size, tattoos, body art (tattoo, paint, seal, etc.), as well as to drunk persons. If by any chance they were able to receive admission then we would ask them to leave.\"*\n\nThen yeah, even covered up they don't want anyone with tattoos.  Usually when they accept people with their tattoos covered they will state that.  \n\nI do not know how accurate this list is, as it has no date but here is a list of places near Osaka that accept people with tattoos\n\n[https://osakahacks.com/blog/6-tattoo-friendly-onsen-osaka](https://osakahacks.com/blog/6-tattoo-friendly-onsen-osaka)\n\nAnd here is a definitely out of date list for Kyoto-Osaka \n\n[https://sugoii-japan.com/tattoo-friendly-onsen-kyoto-osaka](https://sugoii-japan.com/tattoo-friendly-onsen-kyoto-osaka)\n\n(Kurama onsen closed during the pandemic and has not reopened.)\n\nI can't get the website for Funaoka onsen to work, but it seems to still be open since there are reviews of it on Google from the last month.  It's more sento than onsen, but still looks like it could be a great experience and you won't have to worry about being asked to leave, since multiple people with tattoos have posted reviews of it.  \n\nUnlike a lot of people here on this subreddit, I enjoyed Osaka Castle.  But, you have to see Osaka Castle as a museum that has the veneer of a castle vs. a castle that has a small museum inside.  If you're interested in Japanese history, particularly the end of the Sengoku period and the Siege of Osaka Castle, it's a great place to go.",

Most onsen seem to at least allow 1 small tattoo per group if it's covered by a bandage. If you have large tattoos, multiple tattoos, or multiple people with tattoos be prepared to be turned away from public onsen pools if you don't research before you go. You'll have better luck at an onsen facility that has private pools, which many of them do.",

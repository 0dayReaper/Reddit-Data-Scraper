    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m traveling to japan this summer and was wondering if there are any places to just walk in and play volleyball with people. Where I\u2019m from, there are places where you can just walk in, pay a small $10 fee and then play pickup volleyball. Anything similar to that in Tokyo area? (Preferably near chiyoda but anywhere in Tokyo is also fine)\n\nThank you",

Sorry it took a while to post back\n\nMeetup is definitely a viable option but I also found places that are open almost everyday for those that are more spontaneous.\n\nApparently its called a sports center (\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc) and there are usually a few in each of the major prefectures as far as I know. I think theres one in Shinjuku called \u65b0\u5bbf\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc where you pay for a ticket in-person and you can choose to play basketball, volleyball, badminton, etc.\n\nOnce again, sorry for taking a long time to present my research but I want to thank everyone for helping me discover some options and at least giving my question some attention",

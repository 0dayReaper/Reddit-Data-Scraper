    "postText": "**This discussion thread has been set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel. Please stay civil, abide by the rules, and be helpful. Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* For travelers entering the country on or after April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)). The COVID/quarantine section of Visit Japan Web has been removed.\n* Tourists entering Japan should still have their Immigration process and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration and a QR code for Customs, which can smooth your entry procedures.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

If you can\u2019t lift it overhead and don\u2019t have the last row of seats reserved you\u2019ll have to store it in front of your feet; making for a less comfortable Shinkansen ride. \n\nWith large suitcases I always try to reserve the last/back row of seats in one of the many (usually upwards of 15) train cars that make up a single Shinkansen.  There are multiple trains departing each hour so if there\u2019s no luggage seat on your first choice train look for a slightly later/earlier departure.  Note that there are only 5 seats in each row, so if traveling with a group of 6 or more you can\u2019t all get baggage seats in the same train car.  You could reserve 3 baggage seats and have your other travelers reserve seats in the row in front.  If you reserve all 3 baggage seats on one side of the last row you can all pile up your large luggage behind those seats.  \n\nThis website has photos of the overhead storage racks so you can see what fits. \n\n- [Reservations for Baggage Seats](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/info/oversized-baggage/)\n\nIf you\u2019re using a JR Pass ask for seat reservations on the day and at the approximate time you plan to take the Shinkansen when you pick up your pass at the Travel Service Center.  You can also use the ticket vending machines to make seat reservations with your pass at any time or head to any Midori no Madoguchi ticket office to ask the agents there to reserve your seats if you already have your pass. [Scroll down on the official JR Pass website for info on how to reserve seats.](https://japanrailpass.net/en/purchase.html)\n\nIf just buying regular tickets, use the official JR [Smart EX app.](https://smart-ex.jp/en/lp/app/) You can buy tickets there up to 30 days in advance. \n\nOr, easiest option, use the [baggage delivery service](https://trulytokyo.com/luggage-shipping-the-smart-way-to-travel-in-japan/) to ship your large luggage from the hotel front desk of your departure city to the hotel you\u2019ll be traveling to.  Easy Peasy.  Just pack a backpack with essentials for 1 - 2 nights as delivery is only guaranteed within 2 days though bags typically do arrive within 1 day. Great option if you\u2019re stopping off along the way for a day trip or overnight somewhere like Hakone.\n\nIf you\u2019re not staying in a hotel, you can seek out the baggage delivery counters you can find at many large stations.  Note, in Kyoto Station there is a Sagawa counter but not a Yamato Transport (Black Cat) counter.  Sagawa is the #2 baggage delivery company in Japan.  You can also just search Google Maps for a nearby Yamato Transport or Sagawa office and take/ship your luggage there but the counters in major stations are more likely to have English speaking staff available. When you ship your luggage you pay and get a receipt with a tracking number you can use to track the delivery status online.  \n\n- [Yamato Transport (Black Cat): Find a Counter](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/facilities/)\n- [Sagawa Express Counters](https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/servicecenter/)",

Supplemental source is to read the trip reports here by vegetarians / vegans and note what restaurants they ate at. \n\nMost importantly, have the vegetarians take responsibility for meal planning and decide in advance what you will do if their chosen restaurant is out of the way or has a long queue (i.e., does everyone wait with them or will the omnivores split off to eat somewhere else that is quicker so as to maximize sightseeing time). \n\nI'm being serious here. There are a lot of 'hidden' things in Japanese cuisine like dashi (fish-based soup stock) or situations where both meat and vegetables are fried in the same vat of oil or cooked on the same grill, which some people are okay with and others are not. The last thing you need on a vacation is to have a major argument because one of the non-vegetarians made a mistake.",

I know it's not enough time but at the same time I'm not too eager to go everywhere, basically something minimum to feel the vibe of the country (if that's even possible).",

It is closer (1h30min - this makes a huge difference on a day trip), cheaper (covered by the 20k/5 days JR East pass; you can also use the pass for regular JR trips within Tokyo, to Nikko, or for the Narita Express), and has plenty to do. \n\nIf you get up early for the first train then you could do either morning market + Yamadera + Zuihoden / Aoba Castle Ruins or Yamadera + Matsushima / Entsuin / Zuiganji (both methods would satisfy a temple fix), then eat gyutan for dinner before heading back to Tokyo.",

We also bought an Universal Express Pass 7 : Doraemon XR Ride for the second day (tomorrow).\n\nHowever, we did not realize we need one of these per person. \n\nAny idea how we could get our hands on a second express ticket of the same type?",

I\u2019ll be going to Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, and Kawaguchiko. What\u2019s the vibe surrounding tattoos and what can I expect as a person who\u2019s entire body is covered in them? Are there certain cities/towns where I should be fine wearing shirts and shorts and others where I should cover up?

I had a 12pm slot for Dondoko Forest and a 3pm slot for Hill of Youth (Grand Warehouse was not timed entry with the Hill of Youth combo ticket). I walked between Dondoko Forest and Grand Warehouse/Hill of Youth (\\~15min walk), and it was the day of the typhoon, so things may change on a nicer weather day. Luckily for you I have timestamps on all the pictures I took.\n\nI arrived at Dondoko Forest around 12pm, there was a 20ish minute queue for Satsuke and Mei's house. I spent around 10 min in the house and a further 5 min outside the house (according to my phone the last thing I took a pic of here was at 12;37pm). I did not go up the stairs to the actual forest bit due to the weather.\n\nI arrived at Ghibli's Warehouse at around 12;50 and entered the warehouse at 1pm (again according to the timestamps on the phone). The queue outside looked long, it snaked all the way to the ice rink on the other side but it moved fast. I spent about an hour exploring the Warehouse (and also attempting to dry out my shoes, lol) and then I queued for the main \"take pictures with the figurines\" bit for about 45 mins. At about 3pm, I decided to skip the cinema bit and went into the gift shop.\n\nI left the gift shop at 3;27pm and consulted with a staff member who advised I could probably run and just about make my timed entry for Hill of Youth, which I did! I left that section about 20 minutes later, but again the typhoon weather meant I spent less time looking at the outside bit than I might have done otherwise.\n\nIf I could've gone again I would have definitely budgeted an extra hour for the Grand Warehouse, definitely. I think if you do Dondoko at 11am, Grand Warehouse at 12, and then Hill of Youth at 3pm, then it's all doable!",

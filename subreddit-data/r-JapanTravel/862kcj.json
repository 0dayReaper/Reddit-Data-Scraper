    "postText": "Itinerary: Tokyo, Osaka, Koyasan, Hiroshima (including Miyajima island), Kyoto, Hakone, Tokyo again.\n\nBackground: Wow. What a trip. What a country. I'm from the US and have lived here my whole life and have only been to Europe, Mexico and Canada a few times. This was my first trip to Asia.\n\nThoughts: The food and service are amazing almost everywhere you go in Japan. Everything seems to be fresh and made with care. The public transit is the best I've ever used anywhere in all my travels. Trains and buses are very clean and punctual. The people are very nice and helpful if you have any questions. Everyone seems to respect each other and look out for one another. It rubbed off on me in a very positive way. The sites and popular tourist destinations are nice, but the little places off the beaten path are what made a lasting impact on me. Going down little alley ways or getting lost in a small neighborhood in Tokyo is a good way to find neat restaurants or shops or houses. The architecture is beautiful and far different from anything I've seen in the west. Also, the Japanese characters on buildings and signs and neon lights is majestic and incredibly delicately styled. The culture and society seem to really embrace a certain order, cleanliness, and structure to things. It's very different from some of the more multicultural, liberal cities I'm used to in the west. It's different but wildly impressive and something that I don't think you'll see anywhere else.\n\nRecommendations: Travel to Koyasan and live with the buddhist monks. It's worth the money and time and detour. See Hiroshima's amazing museum dedicated to the 1945 atomic bombings. Also in Hiroshima, do a day trip to the island of Miyajima and make sure to hike Mt. Misen. If you're going to Tokyo, give yourself a few days and do plenty of research prior on things to do. It's a massive city but it's all reachable by public transit. Make sure to see Shinjuku and Shibuya at night. Try and talk to locals if you can, they're very friendly and seemed to want to learn about tourists / foreigners.\n\nConclusion: I'd highly recommend going to Japan. March was a good time to go weather wise and tourist wise (low amounts of people, season is just starting). Try and do at least 10 days, anything less would be tough. Make sure to master the head nod / bow, it's a nice way to interact and show you're acknowledgement and respect for and of others.\n\nArigatou gozaimasu! \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059",

My travel partner wants to go back to Yoyogi, and I'm debating looking at other parks we haven't been to yet.  Note you should have a week or so from peak to get in your viewing, so if something holds you up a few days you may want to grab a train to prefectures further north and catch their slightly later full bloom.

But I'm Japanese AND my upper body is covered in koi fish and dragon tattoos so most places most likely said Sorry if I tried to enter the public hot springs. So instead I got a room with a private outdoor hot springs. Man it was awesome. Son loved it. It overlooked the ocean. And the price wasn't too bad at about $300. Comes with breakfast. After that we went to Noboribetsu and stayed at a hotel that had multiple baths. Each one, supposedly, helps with ailments you have. Lol This one allowed people with tattoos. About 10 min walk from the hotel there was a place that an active volcano. The place was surreal. It totally smelled like sulfur and you see smokes coming out of all these places...very cool experience. Apologies if it's hard to understand. Tried to explain a lot without writing too much....",

Shibuya is awesome for the famous crossing and shopping. If you want the best view of Tokyo go to Mori Tower in Roppongi Hills. Tokyo skytree was FULL of tourists I had to fight for window space but Mori tower had a better view, was quiet AND you can go to the rooftop which was one of the best times of my life. I also highly recommend the whole mario kart/go karting tour. I did a 3 hour tour and drove through so much of Tokyo. Tsukiji Market is a MUST if you like seafood. Tokyo Disneyland/DisneySea was amazing. There is so much to see in Tokyo, iv spent 2 weeks there and it wasnt enough. Harajuku was great, going to Asakusa to see the temple amongst modern Tokyo was worth seeing.\n\nHiroshima: highly highly highly recommend you spend two days. One day to see the a dome, peace park, museum, inner hiroshima. One other day to see Miyajima Island. It's a 10min ferry to it and it's so beautiful.\n\nKyoto: Kinkakuji/golden temple, Nijo Castle, Arashiyama(bamboo forest) were my fav places.\n\nOsaka: Universal Studios was awesome especially Harry Potter world. Dotonburi for all the awesome food. I recommend Osaka castle.\n\nMt Fuji: i went to one of the lakes on my first trip where it's popular to see Mt Fuji from but it was so cloudy we didn't see anything so make sure to check the weather. This recent trip we went to FujiQ Highland which is an awesome theme park in front of Mt Fuji with world famous rollercoasters.\n\nHakone: this is a really lovely day trip from Tokyo. Highly recommend going to one of their onsens.\n\nI have also flown up to Sapporo fo the snow but we went straight to the slopes, didnt get to spend any time in the city.",

One day my brother calls me up and say he wants to go to Japan with me and will pay for all flights, accommodation, rail passes, ect; I'd only have to pay for some food and general spending. I spoke to my wife and she said go for it, so I did \n\nIt took me 1.5 years to save up the spending money. And thanks to my amazing brother and kind wife I had the best 3 weeks of my life. \n\n",

I'm feeling 17 days was a bit long for the first time, but definitely would not have fit in as much in a shorter time. I'm also traveling alone, so there's that too haha. Bit lonely and isolating when people can't speak English as well as you'd hoped. Or at least everyone I've come across. But they are still as helpful and delightful as they can be given.

I haven't been to my home area in around 2 years and to just smell beach air again was amazing. On top of that, it is a very quaint and cute town with lots of shrines and character. It also had a studio Ghibli store. I ended up getting interviewed after going to one of the shrines too haha. It was awkward.\n\n----\n\nAs for anime stuff. I did go to Nakano. It was on the list, since Digimon PS4 game has it lmao. It looks a lot like it in the game too. Just when I went was poorly timed, I forgot things didn't open til like midday. So a lot was closed. Still good though! I think I missed radio kaiken, but I'm ok with that because walking around Akihabara, I found a lotof smaller shops with super cheap statues. I personally don't care if they have a box or its damaged, they get opened at home anyhow and put on a shelf. I think all up Ive spent at most 150 aud on them and got almost a full suitcase just for them. \n\nAnother good store that's in a lot of the town's is Book Off too. That's where I also found quality cheap statues. So good. I knew I'd have to pay baggage on the way back anyhow and always intended on just buying a suitcase here. But man, it's been... Considering I work at a pop culture shop back home, eye opening at the amount of variety and prices.",

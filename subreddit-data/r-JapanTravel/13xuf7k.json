Instead no pass and use the Nozomi and whatever train make most sense like use Kintetsu to Nara as the station is closer to the park.\n\nVisa is known to not play nicely with the Suica, you can still try, but should work better with mastercard or american express.\n\nAt least 10 00 yen on you at all time. Like figure you have to be able to spend the full day without being able to pay cashless.",

Give yourself the time and space to fuck around and let the day lead you.\n\nJapan is a haven for cheap, delicious food options. It doesn't have to be a sit down, either. The number of to-go, bento, and snack places in Tokyo is endless. They're everywhere. You've scheduled three(!) 7-11 meals on the first 2 days alone, including dinner. Japan conbinis are awesome for what they are, but I think outside of your first try, should be left to days where you have absolutely no time and have to grab something quick or for snacks.",

I was looking at it a week or so ago for around the time you will be in Japan because I was thinking of going with my tween, but a lot of days were booked out already.  Make sure you pre-book.\n\nTsukuji Outer Market is closed by 2:00 pm and probably some sellers close even earlier.  It's not someplace to go at night.  It's a place to go when you have terrible jet lag and are up at 6 am in Tokyo.\n\nhttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3021.html",

We might just go during the day or go twice. lol\n\nI'm also debating the evening the yukata festival in Himeji.\n\nKyoto also has a Lush Spa, which is how I found out they existed. :)",

I didn't buy anything at Lush in December and we mostly went into the one in Kyoto to see if they had a toilet (they do not.) And outside of learning about the spa, we then had to look for a toilet.\n\nIf you're not going soon I can let you know after we go again in June.  Our dates are very similar to the OP's\n\nSorry!",

It really depends on the item - but sometimes significantly.  \n\nAnd weirdly, the Lush Japan prices are also cheaper than the UK.  For many, many years, I used to buy their stuff from the UK and despite the trans-Atlantic shipping fees, there was still a significant savings - but sadly, they stopped shipping to the US.  :(",

We're going to have more time this next trip and I am hopefully not going to do a number on my feet again, making walking around a nightmare.\n\nWe also won't be running into New Years, which while fun in Japan, does affect shopping.\n\nI discovered Lush when I was in the UK on a vacation and was super excited when they first came to the US.  My tween daughter mostly hates shopping, but Lush is one of the few places she will happily go with me.  \n\nBTW if it's still hot in September, or if you live somewhere hot now, I was told by the Kanazawa Lush that if you keep your Shower Jelly in the fridge it is super refreshing and nice when you shower after being hot and sweaty.\n\nUnited once lost my suitcase for multiple days.  The bag mostly contained gifts for friends, books, spare shoes, and nothing super important, but I did want it back.  They gave me 10,000 yen to spend on clothes/toiletries and I spent it all on Lush lol.  (They eventually found the bag in SFO where it was ripped up and I also got a new suitcase out of them.)",

It was pretty late at night and we had just visited Spa World. So... I think October is less humid but it's still warm.  Think like 70s?  But it varies by where you are.  It's definitely cooler if you are planning trips more into the mountains or in more northern areas.\n\nI get the thing about age, sometimes I am just dying in the heat, though I also go to Japan in June so...  A couple of my December days were really really cold which did not help with my achy feet.  It was my fault, I think between several flights and an impending surf on the crimson wave, I was just bloated.  Moleskins wouldn't have helped me, it was my toes being squished together.  Switching to sneakers and taking a few baths and then visiting an onsen solved the issue, so that by the time I got to Tokyo I was fine.  The issue was more it meant I didn't sightsee as much as I had hoped in Kyoto.  We'd been before but there were a few things I had wanted to do again.  This time I am thinking of just wearing some compression socks.\n\nIf you have any other questions or want any other help, feel free to message me and I will do my best to help in any way I can.  I've never lived in Japan, but over the years I've been in Japan for a couple of days every single month of the year lol",

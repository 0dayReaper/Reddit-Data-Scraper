    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m going to Japan this June for my birthday. It\u2019s my third time visiting Japan and my second time traveling solo to Japan. Main reason I'm going to Japan is just to eat good food. hahaha. I know weather in June is kinda unpredictable but I still want to include sightseeing in my itinerary.\n\n**June 15**\n\n* Arrival at Narita Airport at around 8pm. (Still no Hotel for the night)\n\n**June 16 - Tokyo**\n\n* Starbucks Reserve at Nakameguro\n* Asakusa (Many restos and cafes around the area)\n\n**June 17 - Hakone**\n\n* Go to Hakone using the Hakone Pass (Romancecar)\n* Open Air Museum\n* Owakudani\n* Overnight at Hakone\n\n**June 18 - Hakone; Kawaguchiko**\n\n* Go to Hakone Shrine (early as possible)\n* Go to lake Ashi\n* Ride the Pirate Ship\n* Ride a bus from Togendai to Gotemba to Kawaguchiko\n\n**June 19 - Kawaguchiko**\n\n* Chureito Pagoda (early morning)\n* Oshino Hakkai\n* Oishi Park\n* Go back to Tokyo\n\n**June 20 - Tokyo**\n\n* Cafe hopping\n* Shibuya Sky\n* Pokemon Center\n\n**June 21 - Yokohama - Tokyo**\n\n* Nissin Cup Noodle Museum\n* Shin Ramen Museum\n* Gundam Factory\n* Red Brick Warehouse\n* Harajuku\n* Meiji\n\n**June 22 - Kyoto**\n\n* Shinkansen to Kyoto (or should I go by plane?)\n* Kifune Jinja Shrine\n* Nishiki Market\n\n**June 23 - Kyoto**\n\n* Kiyomizudera Temple\n* Higashiyama\n* Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka\n* Gion District\n\n**June 24 - Kyoto**\n\n* Arashiyama\n\n**June 25 - Kyoto; Osaka**\n\n* Aquarium?\n* Kurumon Market\n* Teamlab Botanical Garden\n\n**June 26 - Osaka**\n\n* Osaka Castle\n* Cafe Hopping\n* Dotonbori\n\n**June 27 - Itami-Narita-Home**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concern is the Hakone-Kawaguchiko trip. Weather in June is very unpredictable. Should I just skip it? For Hakone, I'm fine with a little drizzle but for Kawaguchiko, I really want to be able to walk and stroll around the area.",

I can just skip Asakusa or just move it on another day. Maybe I\u2019ll stroll around Shibuya after starbucks. Then shibuya sky. Go around Harajuku.",

There are a great deal of guides on the internet for that area - no shortage of cool &amp; interesting stuff there. Tons of cool shops, cafes, restaurants, the river, etc. Daikanyama T-Site is a popular spot.",

It might actually be a bit faster, so it depend if you can find cheap airplane ticket, still would be up to you if speed/convenience is worth the cost difference.",

    "postText": "Hello! My partner and I will be travelling to Japan (first time for both of us) for 12 days in October. We are super excited, but also a bit overwhelmed in trying to figure out what we all should/can realistically do in the time that we have. I would love some input on our proposed timelines and itinerary.\n\nA few priorities for us/our travel style:\n\n* we are okay with busy days, but don't want every second to be planned (some spontaneity/flexibility is appreciated and wanted)\n* we would like to spend some amount of time exploring the cities/night-life, but I would also like to balance that with seeing some less \"big city/touristy\" things when possible\n* we would like to see a variety of temples, gardens, etc; also enjoy hiking, outdoorsy things\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1: Tokyo - arrive Narita 6:30am\n\n* activate JR pass, travel to hotel (Shinjuku) \n* drop off bags, explore Shinjuku area \n* Ramen tour at 6:30 pm, through Tokyo Ramen Tours (we thought this might be a nice/less intimidating way to be able to chat with someone about recommendations in Tokyo and get acquainted with the area on our first night!) \n* wander the streets that evening \n\nDay 2: Tokyo - Shibuya and Harajuku \n\n* Meiji shrine\n* Shibuya crossing\n* Ninja restaurant for dinner\n\nDay 3: Day Trip to Nikko\n\n* explore the shrines, falls, bridges\n* be back to Tokyo for dinner \n\nDay 4: Tokyo - Asakusa\n\n* Tsukiji fish market in the morning \n* Sensoji temple\n* Nakamise street shopping \n* Tokyo sky tree \n\nDay 5: Tokyo - Ueno\n\n* Ameyoko market \n* Ueno Park\n* Kappabachi (knives!)\n\nDay 6: Kyoto \n\n* get up early and get on JR shinkansen Tokyo to Kyoto\n* drop bags off at hotel (or pay for luggage transfer) \n* explore area around hotel (Solaria Nishitetsu) \n\nDay 7: Kyoto - Gion\n\n* Kodai-Ji temple and area \n* Shimbashi street \n* Tea ceremony - not booked yet, would love recommendations if anybody has any\n\nDay 8: Kyoto - Arashiyama\n\n* Bamboo grove \n* Iwatayama Monkey park \n* Gio-Ji temple and moss garden \n\nDay 9: Day trip to Kinosaki \n\n* hit up the onsens, relax and unwind \n* maybe Kaiseki dinner in either Kinosaki or Kyoto (still looking for options - any recommendations? Considering Sakuragawa, Kikunoi Honten, Kiyama at the moment.)\n* back to Kyoto for the evening \n\nDay 10: Hiroshima/Miyajima\n\n* get up early and take JR shinkansen Kyoto to Hiroshima\n* see atomic bomb dome and peace memorial \n* drop off bags at hotel (or luggage transfer)\n* ferry over to Miyajima for early afternoon\n* Itsukushima Shrine and Daiganji Temple \n* back to Hiroshima for the evening \n\nDay 11: Osaka \n\n* get up early, travel from Hiroshima to Himeji castle \n* continue on to Osaka, check into hotel \n* walking street food tour booked for that evening at 5:30pm\n\nDay 12: Day trip to Nara \n\n* explore Nara for the morning and afternoon \n* back to Osaka for evening \n\nDay 13: leaving :'( \n\n* do any last minute exploring in Osaka \n* shinkansen back to Tokyo \n* any last minute exploring in Tokyo \n* be back to Narita airport for 6:30pm departure \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any \"can't miss\" experiences that I need to add in? We aren't interested in Disney/Universal Studios/teamLab planets/etc. Thanks so much in advance for your input :)",

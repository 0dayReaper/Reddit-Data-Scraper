    "postText": "Hi all! My husband and I are traveling to Japan at the end of July. We\u2019re planning on hiking Mt. Fuji. Any tips? Trail recommendations? Best time to start? What to expect? We live at 4,200 elevation so I\u2019m not worried about elevation sickness. We\u2019ll be doing some hikes around our city to prep before we go. I lived in Japan 10 years ago for over a year and I\u2019ve been back several times since but I\u2019ve never taken on the Mount Fuji challenge and it seems super daunting for some reason.",

Bought the climbing stick and headed up at noon. By late afternoon I had made it up to station 8. Remember you will want to make stops and enjoy the scenery so give yourself ample time. Around sunset I had dinner at station 8 and had booked a sleeping area which is basically a mat and a sleeping bag. I woke up at midnight 12am and climbed up to the top. Wind was notoriously strong as it was the very last day of the season to climb Fuji. Hid among rocks at the top until the shelter opened up and we could hunker inside. Sunrise was around 5am and after exploring the rim I headed down the back way which is much wider and easier to descent. \nHere is a map you can reference and good luck\n\nhttps://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/kjhqgg0000005set-att/Yoshida2022_en.pdf",

At each stations you can buy water and oxygen but it get increasingly expensive the higher up you go. I dont recall any location to refill there might be an area you can do that. There are paid bathrooms at least at some stations. \nThe stick you can pay a little money and get a stamp burned in it as you reach each station. The stamps have meaning for the year and time. It is subjective but I think it is extremely cool and I brought it back to USA without cutting it.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention the reason I climbed at midnight to the summit which can be more dangerous if the weather is bad is because I wanted to experience fist sunrise while I was at the top of Fuji. Yes it is magical. I probably could have started at 2am and still made it up there before sunrise. Others choose to climb the mountain in one day or to climb the last leg during the day. I wanted to see the sunrise.\n\nEdit2: I keep remembering in pieces, I recall booking our sleeping accommodations which included an awesome Japanese meal, hot soup, hot tea, desert! Probably at station 8 could have been 7. Plan your restroom breaks before you depart and ask the info desk about them as well as weather conditions. There is a post office at the top and you can mail a post card which is cool. You can also walk around the rim which takes an hour. Wind / weather is gonna dictate what you can and cant do while you are at the summit",

A few takeaways: we realized it was getting really cloudy and we wouldn\u2019t be able to see much at the summit, so we just took our time and enjoyed it. We stayed overnight in 8th station, but I had my travel guide call and reserve it for me. They gave us dinner which was included in the fee. The sleeping accommodation is very public, so bring ear plugs and an eye mask if you plan on staying and think you\u2019ll need it. The toilets are non-flush around that portion, so waste is thrown into the bin in the stall. And at the top there was a hose to \u201cflush\u201d. Bring sanitizing hand wipes, and anything you may need to combat bathroom smell. I keep a tiny menthol stick in my pocket to smell if I get nauseous just because I get that way easily.

            "comment": "I did my hike back in August 2019!\n\nThere are a few trails that leads up to Mt. Fuji, but the easiest (and most popular) would be the Yoshida trail - which starts at the 5th Station. If you're doing the Yoshida trail, you can start from Tokyo and take a bus up to 5th station and make your way up to Mt. Fuji. Buses run frequently during the hiking season.\n\n[**I booked my bus through here**](https://highway-buses.jp/course/fuji-5th.php)\n\nThere are 2 options if you're planning to hike Mt. Fuji on the Yoshida trail which I considered.\n\n# 2 Days 1 Night Hike\n\nThis was the option that I went with.\n\nI started my journey from Tokyo and took the earliest bus up to 5th station. Acclimatized for 1 hour at the 5th station before starting the hike.\n\nAbout 1/3 through the trail there will be a security hut passing out safety helmets - TAKE IT! There were cases of stray rocks hitting hikers.\n\nTook me about 5.5 hours to hike up to the 8.5 Station hut. [**This was the hut I stayed (which I belive was the highest hut)**](https://www.goraikoukan.jp/).\n\nAfter reaching the hut I just rested for the sunrise hike (Be prepared to be SANDWICHED between other hikers. Bring some earplugs!). There are 2 options for the sunrise hike, you can either wait at the hut for the sunrise then go up the peak or hike up to the peak for the sunrise.\n\n*My advice: The view outside the hut (at the 8.5 station hut) for the sunrise was just as incredible! So just view the sunrise at the comfort of the hut and after that make your way up. And you get the bonus of extra sleep. While everyone is heading out.*\n\nIf you're taking the peak-for-sunrise, it takes about an hour to reach the peak (from the 8.5 station hut). Do note that there will be a snake of people doing the hike, there will be human traffic and it'll be FREEZING before sunrise, so bring some heatpacks (The windchills are CRAZY cold)\n\n# Day Hike (a.k.a Bullet Climbing)\n\nIf you're a really quick hiker you can do the entire trail (both up and down Mt. Fuji) in the morning and head back down by afternoon, reaching back to 5th station and back to Tokyo. I highly advice against it, there were notices throughout the trail informing hikers against this (fatique, etc.)\n\n----\n\nTLDR;\n\n* Book the huts early, the other option is use a tour agency (they have reserved hut slots)\n* I brought a large water bag with me, refilled by buying bottled water from the hut I was staying at\n* Do note that you're supposed to bring your thrash down, unless you're staying at the hut, in which case you can just pass it back to them.\n* To preserve water, the huts usually don't flush toilets. So... Just keep an open mind of the smell. I heard they only flush when it rains.\n* There are 2 type of sticks, the long and short versions. The long stick has an added bonus of a hiking stick, the short means you'll have to pack it in your bag. Bring some coins for the stick stamping!\n* Bring a headlamp for the sunrise hike\n\nEDIT: Adding some pictures! [**Album**](https://imgur.com/a/ogmgq9O)",

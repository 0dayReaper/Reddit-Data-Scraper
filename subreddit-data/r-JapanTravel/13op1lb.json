    "postText": "This time almost exclusively in Okinawa as I missed the Islands in November. Question is are scooters/motorcycles viable there? I'll be renting for a week. I have my M class US DL and heavy machinery class IDP, 1949 approved. Being a bunch of islands, is it worth it? Can I ferry to some of the islands? Plan is to do the night trips, and snorkeling, other water sports and just lazing around for once. Rented a scoot and a 650 in Taiwan last week and the 650 was useless due to lack of mobility vs 30 scooters in line with me at all times.",

            "comment": "Renting a scooter or motorcycle in Okinawa can be a great way to explore the islands. The traffic is generally less congested than in larger cities, and the roads are well-maintained. Plus, the scenery is beautiful, and traveling by scooter can give you a more intimate experience with the landscape.\r  \n\r  \nYour US driver's license and International Driving Permit (IDP) should be sufficient for you to rent and drive a scooter or motorcycle in Japan. However, you should always check with the rental company to make sure there are no additional requirements.\r  \n\r  \nAs for ferrying between islands, yes, there are several ferry services available that can take you and your scooter or motorcycle to different islands in the Okinawa Prefecture. The Kerama Islands, for example, are a popular destination and can be reached by ferry from Naha, the capital of Okinawa.\r  \n\r  \nRegarding the choice between a scooter and a motorcycle, it really depends on your personal preference and comfort level. A scooter might be more maneuverable in traffic and easier to handle for short trips, while a motorcycle could be more comfortable for longer rides.\r  \n\r  \nRemember to always wear a helmet and follow local traffic laws. Enjoy your trip!",

We rode all day north and south along the coastal roads and also interisland across the bridges. Lots of fun but I missed drinking beer at the stopovers. Made up for it after we returned, however. You can ferry just about anywhere including the mainland. Have fun and be safe.",

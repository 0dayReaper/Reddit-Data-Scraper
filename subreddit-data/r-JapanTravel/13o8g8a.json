    "postText": "Hello everyone! I need to fly to China in June to deal with some super last minute family business, so I figured I\u2019d visit Japan for the first time before heading there. I have to meet up with an uncle for a day in Tokyo on the 6th, so I had to split my Tokyo stay in half. Apologies if this itinerary isn\u2019t the best, I\u2019ve gone through dozens of posts here and a ton of articles, but I\u2019ve never traveled solo before and am admittedly stressed and overwhelmed planning everything so close to the travel date. Trying to just make sure I'm on the right track so I stop freaking out about a trip that I'm sure will be enjoyable.\n\nI've only had about a week to do my research and plan these things out, so I still have nothing really planned for Osaka and Tokyo, but I figure since Kyoto and Hakone are both going to be pretty crazy, it might be alright to just have general lists of things to consider doing in Tokyo and Osaka.\n\n**Monday, May 29 - Tokyo arrival + getting settled**  \n2pm Arrive in Tokyo  \n~2pm-3pm? Get my JR Pass, Welcome Suica card (Tokyo Monorail 2F Ticket Gate/Arrival lobby)  \n3-4pm Head to hostel (&amp;AND Hostel Asakusa Kappabashi), withdraw ~80-100K JPY at a 7-11?  \nCheck into hostel and stop by Suzukien Asakusa for matcha ice cream   \nWalk to Ueno Park  \nDinner at Asakusa Gyukatsu(?), get some rest  \n\n**Tuesday, May 30 - Tokyo - Akihabara**  \nAkihabara stuff ??  \n\nFood Possibilities:  \nRoast Beef Ohno Akihabara  \n\n**Wednesday, May 31 - Tokyo to Kyoto**  \n6am Grab some breakfast at nearby 7-Eleven, head to Tokyo Station  \n7am Arrive at Tokyo Station, catch 7:30 Shinkansen to Kyoto  \n~10am Arrive in Kyoto, walk to K\u2019s House to drop off luggage  \n11am Lunch in Downtown Kyoto and check out Nishiki Market \n3-4pm Head to Fushimi Inari Taisha\n\n**Thursday, June 1 - Kyoto (Arashiyama)**  \n8am Head to Tenryu-ji (take the walking tour https://www.insidekyoto.com/arashiyama-bamboo-grove-guide-walking-tour)  \nArashiyama Bamboo Garden  \nOkochi Sanso Garden  \n\nCheck out Togetsukyo Bridge too  \n12:30pm Lunch somewhere \n2pm-5pm Ginkakuji -&gt; Philosopher\u2019s Path -&gt; Eikan-do Temple -&gt; Nanzen-ji -&gt; Pontocho for dinner and wandering Gion at night  \n7pm Get dinner and hang out somewhere or go to bed early  \n\n**Friday, June 2 - Kyoto to Nara to Osaka (Nara Day Trip, spend night in Osaka)**  \n6am Leave for Kiyomizu-dera  \n10:30am Return to hostel to check out and head to Kyoto Station (Platform 8, Kyoto -&gt; Nara via Nara Line)  \n11:30ish Train to Nara, leave luggage at Nara Station locker on arrival  \n1pm Nara Park / Todaiji  \n5pm Train to Osaka (Nara -&gt; Tennoji via Kansai Line, Tennoji -&gt; Osaka via Haruka 42)  \nTake Midosuji Line (Red Line) to Namba Station, then walk 10 min to Osaka Namba Hostel Miyabi  \n8pm Dinner + nightlife stuff?  \n\n**Saturday, June 3 - Osaka**  \nNOT SURE YET  \n\nDotonburi for food  \n\n**Sunday, June 4 - Osaka**  \nNOT SURE YET  \n\nFood possibilities:  \nFukutaro for okonomiyaki  \nTakoyaki anywhere  \n\n**Sunday, June 5 - Osaka to Hakone**  \nCatch 8:06 Shinkansen to Odawara  \n10:38 Arrive in Odawara, drop off with Baggage Service at Hakone-Yumoto station  \n11:00 Hakone Loop until 5pm at the latest (might need to hurry, focus time in Owakudani)  \n5pm Go from Hakone Yumoto station to Senkyoro Ryokan  \nCheck in by 6pm to eat provided dinner  \nNighttime activities: Senkyoro\u2019s onsen, walk around the area, relax for the night  \n\n**Monday, June 6**  \nHakone to Tokyo  \nLeave 7am for Odawara Station, catch 8:20 Shinkansen to Tokyo (Kodama 818)  \n~9:30am arrive at hostel (K\u2019s House Tokyo Oasis), leave luggage at reception  \nCheck out Nakamise-dori  \nStop by Taiyaki Sharaku later in the day  \n\n**No clue what to do this day \u2014 meeting up with an uncle and have nothing planned**  \n\n5:30pm Mantensushi Omakase (Nihonbashi)  \n\n**Tuesday, June 7 - Tokyo (Ginza / Chuo)**  \n7:30am Leave for Tsukiji Outer Market   \nHamarikyu Gardens  \nShop around in Ginza, including Uniqlo Flagship store  \n\nFood/Snack Possibilities:  \nTempura Tsujimura  \nTaimeiken (omurice)  \n\nGinza Music Bar at night?  \n\n**Wednesday June 8 - Tokyo (Shinjuku / Shibuya)**  \nShinjuku/Shibuya/Harajuku stuff?  \nCheck out some bars (or other listening bars like Grandfather\u2019s)   \n\nFood/Snack Possibilities:  \nHarajuku Gyozaro  \nFlippers Shibuya  \n\n**Thursday June 9**  \nFlight out of Haneda Airport",

I assume you booked your accommodations already so its something you can consider for your next trip.\n\nAshikaga flower park in the Tochigi prefecture is worth a half day visit since wisteria is in season (might have to check multiple sources tho as sakura bloomed pretty early this year). However, its 4 hours round trip from Tokyo. Another option is Hitachi seaside park.\n\nThere are a few shrines near Tokyo in the Kanagawa prefecture, namely Kotoku-in, Sasuke Inari and Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu shrines. \n\nYokohama is also a nice place to visit. There's the Gundam factory and the bay. Also the Yokohama Rose Week is currently on.\n\nDon't forget to download the Japan Navitime app so you can plan your day accordingly!",

            "comment": "I like the detail and thought you put into this. \n\nYour list for June 1 (Kyoto) sounds like a very tiring amount of walking. It also takes an hour to get from the Togetsukyo Bridge to Ginkakuji so you'll have to keep to a very strict schedule. Not to mention it might be pretty humid too.\n\nWith that in mind, your Osaka days directly afterwards might honestly be best spent resting for at least part of them. (sorry to any Osaka fans \ud83d\ude05)\n\nThe Hakone loop is a good default if you have no idea at all what to visit, but I personally found the museums and galleries nicer and I felt that checking in at 6pm did not give me enough time to relax and enjoy the ryokan I was paying good money for. When I was doing the Hakone loop I felt like I spent more time on buses and trains than actually seeing things.\n\nOn top of that, your ryokan is in Sengokuhara which is 30 mins from Hakone-Yumoto. If you must do the loop I recommend going anti-clockwise (from Yumoto to the Amazake Tea House, Checkpoint, Lake etc) and stopping at Gora, then hitting a museum or two (or my favourite temple Choanji) if you have time, then heading to your ryokan. Then you can take the cable car down to Yumoto in the morning (it's slower than bus but you might be able to see the lovely hydrangeas).\n\nOne more thing, perhaps consider organising takkyubin from your Osaka hotel directly to your Tokyo hotel and taking a day pack to Hakone.\n\nMonday June 6 - Asakusa has plenty to do around the Senso-ji area and it's generally a nice place to just walk around. Try Hoppy Street in the evening for outdoor sit-down dining/drinking, which was somewhat rare for me to find in Tokyo.\n\nGood luck!",

When you say the cable car to Yumoto in the morning, do you mean taking a bus to Gora and taking the cable car from there? And I\u2019ll definitely reach out to my Tokyo hostel to see if they can receive luggage delivery!",

Last month I stayed for a month, and I guess I had a bit of travel fatigue but didn\u2019t do anything in Osaka. City is enormous but did not have the same charm or \u201calien\u201d aspect like Tokyo imo. After the classic dotonburi and Osaka castle I didn\u2019t see or experience anything else. So from my very limited experience I would suggest to spend another day in Kyoto instead or in Tokyo as there\u2019s tons of stuff to do (obviously also Osaka but again, it was my least favorite)\n\nEdit: for Kyoto arashiyama is beautiful but the bamboo forest is overhyped and jam packed with people. So you don\u2019t miss much if you skip it (but do visit the rest of the area)",

Also, Kintetsu has a direct train from Nara to Namba. If you didn\u2019t want to take Kintetsu, at least use the subway from Tennoji to Namba. Both Tennoji and Namba are is the southern part of Osaka. Osaka station is in the northern part, so it\u2019s really inefficient to go to the northern part of Osaka to get to another location in the southern part.",

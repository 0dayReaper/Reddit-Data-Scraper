    "postText": "30 year old queer woman from Canada, first solo trip to Japan this July! (I know, it'll be brutally hot \ud83e\udd75). I've been checking out this sub a lot while planning my trip and have found it really helpful.Posting my itinerary here to see if anyone has any advice/recommendations (or in case it can help someone else plan their own trip!). I like hiking, good food, nature, exploring, history/museums, and anything quirky/unexpected. Trying to strike a good balance between rest and adventure.\n\nSpecifically, I'd appreciate any advice on: hidden gems that I'm missing from my itinerary, recommendations for good food/tea/unique shops, and-- especially-- ways I can rest &amp; relax, whether that's adding or removing things from my itinerary.More specific questions are beneath each section. Thank you all in advance!\n\n**July 15-20 : Tokyo**\n\nDay one: arrive in Shinjuku, wander in a jet lagged daze + crash early\n\nDay two: Meiji Shrine, explore Harajuku, Ebisu, Daikanayama, &amp; Nagameguro\n\nDay three: wander Asakusa, Ueno, Yanaka. Go to the National museum\n\nDay four: day trip to Kamakura (any hiking suggestions?)\n\nDay five: Kichijoji, Koenji\n\nDay six: Nishiki Market, Imperial Palace, Kagurazaka, Shinjuku Gyoen, Shinjuku gay bars/cafes\n\n*Questions*: Where can I get good tea in the early morning (i.e. before 7-8am)? Other than Nishiki Market, Meiji Shrine, and Shinjuku Gyoen, any advice on what I can do early mornings more generally?I'd also really love to immerse myself in some queer culture, if possible! Any recommendations for drag shows or queer dance parties that are foreigner-friendly?\n\n**July 21-22: Sendai area**\n\nDay one: travel to Sendai, spend day in Matsushima\n\nDay two: Yamadera in the morning, then travel to Nikko (really wanted to do Dewa Sanzen but couldn't figure out reliable bus schedules, so scrapped it unfortunately)\n\n*Questions*: I'll only be spending a few hours in Sendai, in the evening. Any can't miss places to see or eat, ideally close to the JR station? I don't drink, so not keen to just go to bars or izakayas. Live music venues or dance clubs could be fun though.\n\n**July 23-24: Nikko**\n\nNo real plans for here, just to go to some of the major temples, catch up on some rest, and hike around. Any suggestions, ideally not temple-related? I know I'll be seeing a lot in Kyoto, so want to avoid temple fatigue.\n\n**July 25-28: Japanese Alps**\n\nDay one: Matsumoto (stop by castle, then bus to Norikura where I will stay at Raicho Onsen Inn)  \nDay two: bus to Kamikochi, hike for the day  \nDays three + four: hike around Norikura\n\n*Questions*: any advice on places to hike around Norikura? I've read there are some good onsens in the area. Any recommendations for some near Norikura? I won't have a car and ideally want to use the bus as little as possible, so I can spend more time resting and enjoying the hotel).\n\n**July 29-30: Takayama and Kanazawa**\n\nNo set plans for here either. Morning market in Takayama, seafood + the major tourist sites in Kanazawa. Any recommendations? I'm mainly looking to eat good food, chill, and enjoy myself.\n\n**July 31-August 5: Kyoto**\n\nDay one: Southern Higashiyama\n\n\\-Fushimi Inari at break of dawn (like 4:30am, if I can manage it)  \n\\-walk to Kiyomizu-dera, get there for 8am ish  \n\\-Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka (ancient pedestrian road)  \n\\-Kodai-ji (temple)  \n\\-Kennin-ji (temple)  \n\\-Ishibei Koji (lane)  \n\\-Maruyama park + Shogun-zuka (observation deck)  \n\\-wander Gion + Pontocho\n\nDay two: Northern Higashiyama\n\n\\-bike to Ginkaku-ji at break of dawn (but more like, 6am this time)  \n\\-Philosopher\u2019s path (connects to Ginkaku-ji)  \n\\-Nanzen-ji (temple)  \n\\-bike along Kamo river\n\n\\*\\*any advice for this day in particular? I know I want to see Ginkaku early in the morning, but am unsure about the rest. Should I move Philosopher's path to the day before? Replace the afternoon temples with a hike from Kurama to Kibune?\n\nDay three: day trip to Nara\n\n\\-Todai Ji Temple (get there by 7:30am)  \n\\-Isuien garden and/or Yoshikien garden (which one is better?)  \n\\-Kasuga Shrine + Botanical Garden-Kasugayama Primeval Forest (\\*\\*\\*looking to do a good afternoon hike here. any suggestions?)  \n\\-wander Naramachi\n\nDay four: day trip to Koya\n\n\\*\\*how doable is a solo hike along the Choishi Michi trail? I'm fit, lowkey distressed by large insects, but very drawn to type 2 fun.\n\nDay five: Arashiyama\n\n\\-taxi from station to Otagi Nenbatsu-ji, then walk down the hill stopping by whatever catches my eye on the way\n\nDay six\n\n\\-bike to Kinkaku-ji (another early start to the day)  \n\\-Ryoan-ji (temple with rock garden)  \n\\-Ninna-ji (temple, 10min walk away from above)  \n\\-Ichijo dori Street (monster statue street)-imperial palace   \n\\-downtown shopping + food + relaxing\n\n*Questions*: how can I streamline my time in Kyoto, especially days two and six? Any recommendations for \"hipster\" cafes/places to hang out and read in the afternoon?\n\n**August 6-10: Kumano Kodo Nakahechi route**\n\n\\-Accommodations all booked except for one night in Koguchi! Any suggestions? I can bus back to Yunomine Onsen at the end of the day, but really want to avoid that if possible.\n\n\\-Also, is it crazy that I won't be using luggage transfer? All I'll have with me is a backpack, but I suspect I'll buy more that I plan to in Kyoto and Tokyo and know it'll be very hot.\n\n**August 11-13: Osaka**\n\n\\-day trips to USJ + Himeji (is HImeji worth it, or should I go for Kobe or somewhere less tourist-filled instead?\n\n\\-Dotonbori + street food \n\n**August 14-16: Shimanami Kaido**\n\nbike from Onomichi to Imabari over two days!\n\nQuestions: any hidden gems along the route? I've done big cycling trips before and am keen to add more km to the route. Most importantly, do you have any advice on how to get back from Imabari to Onomichi? Guidebooks mention a bus, but I haven't been able to find any timetables online..\n\n(post continued)",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI am not into hiking, so I am not able to make any suggestions about it.\n\nSo a few comments on things I can comment on:\n\nNishiki Market is in Kyoto and is not open particularly early.  I'm not sure why you put it in Tokyo.  Do you possibly mean Tsukuji fish market?\n\nI usually get my tea or coffee from my hotel's breakfast buffet or just use whatever is in the room.  There are very limited places open for breakfast in the morning.  Japan is set up so that you tend to eat in your hotel for breakfast or you make something in your home.  Breakfast out is not really a thing.  If you're not staying in a hotel you can always buy tea and make it in your accommodations?  There are lots of places to buy tea of various types from green and black to oolong, genmaicha, and barley.  I believe iced barley teas are particularly traditional in the Summer.\n\nShinjuku Gyoen doesn't open until 9.   \n\nSo on the 29th are you staying Takayama or Kanazawa?  Do be aware if you plan to go between the two via train that there are very limited (8) trains between them every day.  4 are expresses and 4 are locals and the locals are not timed to cover the periods the expresses are not running necessarily.\n\nSo I am confused with your Kyoto days.\n\nJuly 31st is day 1\n\nAugust 1 day 2\n\nAugust 2 day 3\n\nAugust 3 day 4\n\nAugust 4 day 5\n\nAugust 5 is day 6th, but how can you start you day 1 itinerary at 4:30 am if the 29th and 30th are in Takayama or Kanazawa.  Or are you just staying there the night of the 29th and then heading for Kyoto late on the 30th?  That's going to make it hard to be up and out before 4:30 am\n\nYou can bike to Ginkakuji at 6:00 am, but the temple isn't going to open until 8:30 am.\n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3907.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3907.html)\n\nMake sure you know where you are parking your bike and that it is a legal place to park.  Bikes do get ticketed.\n\nMake sure you give yourself enough time to get wherever you are first staying on the Kumano Kaido on the 6th.  It's a good 3 or so hours to Tanabe from which most of the buses leave for the actual trails.  \n\nI guess if you have too much stuff you can rent a locker or look into another luggage storage option rather than using a transfer service,   I would do that in Osaka since that is where you go to after the Kumano Kaido.\n\nIf you rent a car near Takeo onsen in Saga-ken and return it in near Kurokawa onsen in Kumamoto-ken you are going to have substantial, like 10,000 yen or more drop-off fees.  Rental cars in Japan cost more if not returned to the same location your rented from.  Heck, I was looking at a 4000 yen drop off fee for wanting to leave my car in Fukushima City and not Koriyama City, and they're both in Fukushima-ken!  \n\nIt probably makes more sense to backtrack to Nagasaki from Takeo onsen and rent a car there or closer to Shimbara and return it before getting on the ferry.  Then once you get to Kumamto, rent a car there and return it there when done.\n\nGood luck!",

                    "comment": "Hi, thank you so much for your detailed comment!\n\nYou're correct, I was initially planning on spending one night in Kanazawa, exploring the city, then travelling to Kyoto in the evening, the night before a jam-packed day 1 in Kyoto that starts at 4:30am. Writing this, I see how this is absurd and the opposite of restful (as well indicative of how I got to be so burnt out and in need of rest in the first place). I've decided to add an extra night in Kanazawa so that I'm less rushed. I'll also go over the list of temples I have planned in Kyoto and really find a handful of must-do's, and give myself permission to skip any of the others, depending on weather/how I feel that day.\n\nThank you *so* much for the locker idea for Kumano Kodo! That would be an ideal solution. I'll confirm that I can leave my stuff in a locker at Osaka station for 6 days, and if I can, then that is definitely what I'll do.\n\nHmm tricky about the car rental.. I'll have to iron out that section of my itinerary and maybe look into other transport options. \n\nThank you again for your help, I appreciate it!",

            "comment": "Hello, I\u2019m Japanese living in Canada! Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Day 1 in Kyoto looks a bit too much to me. Spread the places out between day 1 and 2. You might want to add Sanjusangen-do if you are visiting the area. And you also want to try yuka dining along Kamo River. You, however, need to book a table asap as that\u2019s quite popular among Japanese locals. One thing you want to remember about Kyoto is that it gets extremely hot and humid during summer because of its geographical location. It sure is hotter than its surrounding areas such as Osaka and Nara. You want to take it easy while staying there. Don\u2019t put too much in one day.\n\n2. In terms of Kumano, have you checked Airbnb? Is there anything?\n\n3. From August 13 to 16, it\u2019s Obon holiday in Japan, and people go out. It becomes quite busy everywhere. Be prepared. If you ever need to take any kind of transportation, book them asap. You want to book your accommodations during the period asap as well.\n\n4. Even though the rainy season will have been probably over by the time you visit Japan, typhoons come from time to time until the end of September. Okinawa, Kyushu, Southern Kansai and Tokai area are usually affected more than the others, but sometimes, the entire country gets messed up. While you are in Japan, pay attention to weather forecasts, and just know that there is a chance that you need to change or cancel part of your itinerary at some point. (I feel like you will.) Typhoons hitting Japan are not funny. Don\u2019t push your plans too hard.\n\n5. The summer in Japan will probably be super uncomfortable and almost intolerable for you. The high temperatures and humidity are unlike anything you have experienced in Canada. On top of that, you will be jet lagged. Take it easy. Hydrate yourself really well every day. What saves you more than anything else are convenience stores. And then, have a thin long sleeve hoodie or something with you. Japan uses ACs aggressively inside buildings. You may start feeling cold as your sweat goes away. I would carry one all the time in Japan, and it helped me a lot.\n\nEnjoy your trip!!",

Yuka also dining along Kamo River looks amazing, I'll definitely try to reserve a spot. \n\nAnd thank you for the advice about heat and typhoons! Based on yours and a few other responses, I've decided to cut out a few sections of my trip (Sendai/Yamadera, Kagoshima) so that I'm travelling around less and have a bit more flexibility. There's just so much I want to see! I guess I'll just have to plan a second trip someday.\n\nHope you're having a good start to the summer!",

In terms of Himeji, you don\u2019t have to have a day trip; you just stop by there on your way to Onomichi.\n\nFor Nara, Koyasan and Kumano, I would put all together if I were you. There is no point of you going back and forth between Kyoto and those places. And then, I guess you can go to the places more quickly from Osaka than from Kyoto. I\u2019m not 100 % sure, but I feel like so.\n\nI, too, hope you are enjoying the beginning of the summer. Here in Vancouver, the weather has been pretty good so far!",

One of the nearby islands?Day three: rent care, drive to Unzen to hike, then on to Shimabara to explore + sleep\n\n*Questions*: what should I do on day two? Any recommended day trips? I think at this point in the trip I'd probably love to hang out by the ocean, but the idea of a crowded beach seems awful. I can rent the car a day early though, if there's a worthwhile place to get away to for a few hours. I'm especially looking for help planning this day.\n\n**August 20-21: Central/southern Kyushu**\n\nDay one: ferry over from Shimabara, but skip Kumamoto and drive right to Aso. Hike around, then drive to Kurakawa Onsen and spend the night\n\nDay two: JR from Kumamoto to Kagoshima, explore for the afternoon.\n\n*Questions*: what are the best places to stop by while driving around Aso, and from Kumamoto to Kurakawa? I don't want to go too out of my way, but would love to find some beautiful spots to explore. Not a big fan of lookout points only accessible by car, I find working for a good view makes it more beautiful.\n\n**August 22-24: Yakushima**\n\nNo plans here either, but am really excited for this end to the trip. I plan to rent a car and do as much hiking (and snorkelling?) as possible.\n\n*Questions*: do you have any hikes that you'd recommend? I like a good physical challenge, but don't want to wander off any well established trails. Any good food worth travelling to?\n\nThank you for reading and I appreciate any feedback!

But you should have a good rain gear because it rains quite a lot on Yakushima.\n\nMaybe you will also be able to see the turtle hatching on the beaches! I think this happens in August, you should ask one of the locals.\nThere are also some nice natural outdoor onsens at the beach in the south for free. We really enjoyed that in the end of the day .\n\nIf you haven't got a place to stay yet, you should definitely book at Pension Blue Drop if it's still available! Yuki is a gem of a host and will help you with everything she can (car, ferry etc. Recommendations) and her meals were so delicious. She is such a lovely person!",

            "comment": "Some of your logistics look difficult. You are going to spend more time moving between hotels than enjoying yourself.  Busses and trains often run late. Missed connections are costly as busses run very infrequently. Renting a car and returning it takes time. Sometimes, buying a ticket at the train station involves waiting in line for 30-40 minutes. Checking in and out of hotels takes time. All these things can be stressful. \n\nFor example, getting from Nagasaki to Kurokawa Onsen will take most of the day and not leave much time for sightseeing or hiking. Maybe spend two nights in Kurokawa Onsen (I did). The town is beautiful, and it is wonderful to spend a whole day relaxing in an onsen and hiking around the area.\nMaybe skip Kagoshima instead as it will be ridiculous hot there, and IMO, it is not as nice.  It was too hot when I was there in April for me.\n\nThere are lots of places you are passing by that are worth visiting that will take less transit time.\nSendai is a vibrant city with lovely temples like Rinnoji that are worth visiting. I was there last week and loved it. All the food was great, but they are especially known for beef tongue restaurants (there is a highly rated one in the train station). \n\nAlso, can you really do all that biking and hiking in the heat? I would die, lol! \n\nAnd what if it rains. Japan is super rainy. You need extra days in a lot of places, or you will be stuck no seeing them at all if it rains a day or 2.\n\nI would seriously cut down on the amount you are doing and see fewer places more thoroughly. And if hiking in 90% humidity and 90+ degrees isn't something you do all the time, maybe go to Hokkaido instead of some of the southern destinations.",

I tend to take on too much, so it's helped give me some perspective and much needed encouragement to do less. \n\nI've (reluctantly) decided to cut out Sendai/Matsushima/Yamadera from my itinerary, and give myself more time in the Japanese Alps, but more importantly, to not spread myself so thin. I've added one night in Kanazawa, decreased my time in Norikura from three to two nights, and added a night in Kamikochi.\n\nI think you're absolutely correct about needing an extra night in Kurokawa Onsen too. Thinking through it, it seems way too rushed to try to squeeze everything (driving, hiking, exploring, hot springs) into one night, especially when the point of Kurokawa is to slow down and relax! I decided to follow your advice and replace my night in Kagoshima with a second night in Kurokawa. I feel drawn to Kagoshima for some reason though, so I'm still playing around trying to find a way to spend some time there.\n\nThank you again for your insight!!",

However you'll have to transfer at Hirayu to get there.\n\n[Japan Alps](https://thejapanalps.com/en/climb/route/) is a decent resource for looking up hiking trails.

            "comment": "[Snow Monkey Park](https://en.jigokudani-yaenkoen.co.jp/) is worth a little detour when your in the Japanese Alps area.\n\nDespite how famous the place is its not very crowded especially in summer time when monkeys dont bathe in the pool. When we were there a week ago there was maybe 20 people and over 100 monkeys there. But going there is risky because they are wild monkeys and might not show up at the park at all if they find enough food outside it or just dont feel like going. If you want to play it safe you can check the park webcam before so you know if they are there but if you want to take the risk its a way cooler experience being there before the monkeys show up and watch them come down from the mountains. We were in the hotel eating soba and drinking sake while waiting for the monkeys. When the first few monkeys walked past the hotel we quickly rushed to the park. It was my favorite experience in the entire trip.\n\nEdit. And beware of google maps bus routes! Theres less busses in summer time but google shows winter timetables so you need to check official websites before you go.",

I was planning on arriving around noon and exploring, then checking out the morning markets in the morning. \n\nI've added a night to Kanazawa, so am no longer in a rush to get there the following day. I'm thinking of travelling from Takayama -&gt; Shirakawago -&gt; Kanazawa. Tbh though, I don't feel a huge draw to Shirakawago, though everyone seems to agree it's not to be missed.\n\nIya valley looks absolutely amazing and somewhere I'd definitely love to spend some time, but maybe not on this trip unfortunately. I'll look into some of your other suggestions too, Narai seems particularly interesting. Thank you again!",

I have a JR pass and am looking to get to Kanazawa tomorrow from Tokyo. Is there anyway for this to be possible? It seems all the Shinkansen options are taken. Any advice would be great, stressing out a bit at the moment. Thank you!",

Will have to be a Hakutaka Shinkansen, should be platform 21. You cannot ride the Kagayaki, it is reserved only (platform 20). Worst case you stand all the way to Kanazawa. But Tokyo station is the first station, so you have a bit more chance to sit than taking it at Ueno.\n\nThe Hakutaka is also slower as it stops at more stations, but you have no choice.\n\nFYI, usually it is kind of possible to book the same day, but not during peak domestic travel period like golden week.",

I got to the platform 20 minutes before it departed, there was no lines for carriage 2 and 3, it was just everyone standing wherever they want (absolutely packed) So I stood directly in line with the door, at the back of all the people. This is a better strategy than standing to the side, as the people to the side get stuck and can\u2019t push in the line. Sure enough, the people in front of me managed to get on quickly and the people to the side were stuck trying to squeeze on. I hope that makes sense without a diagram!",

You might do better than me during the day, as I have very pale skin, but in the evening I definitely recommend going to Higashi Chaya District before sunset, then head towards the Kenrokuen garden area (everything is near each other)",

There are usually at least 3 cars of non reserved seats and usually they are cars 1-3.  (on some trains it is cars 1-6)  I would start in Tokyo over Ueno, even if you are staying closer to Tokyo, because getting on at the starting station will increase your chances of getting a seat.  Non-reserved cars are marked and the overhead lighted up signs will say which are the non-reserved cars for sure, so you can go there.\n\nHakutakas are slower, but not a lot slower and I want to say there are more of them than Kagayakis.\n\nIf you get there early and line up at the first station for a non-reserved seat and you are not part of a group of 5 or 6 people who all want to sit together, you should be fine.  I would not dink with waiting in line at a ticket counter, since if there were no seats yesterday, chances are high there are no seats today.  I would only wait in line if the line is very short, as otherwise you are just wasting time and it is better to wait on the platform for a non-reserved car.\n\nI got 2 non reserved seats that way on 1/2/23 on a Yamabiko. from Morioka to Tokyo.  I was traveling around New Years and there were not reserved seats from Sendai to Tokyo on anything.\n\nThese seem to be then times for the Hakutaka\n\n[https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/timetable/00006668/00000177?direction=down&amp;type=Hakutaka](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/timetable/00006668/00000177?direction=down&amp;type=Hakutaka)\n\nI would not take the last one or even the second to last one, just to be extra safe.\n\nAnd this webpage about Kanazawa Station:\n\n[https://www.kanazawastation.com/the-hokuriku-shinkansen-for-kanazawa-toyama-nagano-tokyo/](https://www.kanazawastation.com/the-hokuriku-shinkansen-for-kanazawa-toyama-nagano-tokyo/)\n\nshows what I meant about the lighted up signs if you go to the 2nd image.  It will clearly tell you which are the non-reserved cars.  But get there 20 or so minutes before the train departs!  There will be other people lining up.\n\nDoin't stress too much!",

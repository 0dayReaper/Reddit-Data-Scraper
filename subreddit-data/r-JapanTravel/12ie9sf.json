And under each area there a few things we may or may not be able to see depending on circumstances / how we feel.\n\nI accept that probably things won\u2019t always go to plan and we won\u2019t see everything we want :)\n\nDay 1 - arrive in Tokyo , staying near Tokyo train station \n\n- taking it easy \n\nMorning / afternoon :\n\n- around Tokyo station area /imperial palace gardens \n\n- Ginza / art aquarium museum \n\nEvening (if we aren\u2019t too tired )\n\n- dinner at odaiba and look at rainbow bridge \n\n- team lab planets \n\nDay 2 (north Tokyo)\n\n- Senso Ji Temple / Nakamise street\n\n- Ueno Park / walk around Ueno \n\n- Riguki En garden \n\nDay 3 (West Tokyo)\n\n-Shinjuku : shinjuku national garden\n\n-Harajuku :Meiji jingu, yoyogi park ,  takeshita Dorita street .\n\n-Shibuya : Shibuya scramble square to catch sunset \n\nDay 4 (transfer to south Kyoto)\n\n-Morning Shinkansen to Kyoto - staying near Kyoto train station .\n\n-Fushimi inari shrine \n\n-Tofuku Ji temple (if we aren\u2019t too tired )\n\nDay 5 (north / central Kyoto):\n\n-Kinkakuji golden pavilion \n\n- Kyoto imperial palace\n\n- Nijo castle \n\n- Nishiki market / pontocho street \n\nDay 6 (west Kyoto/ arashiyama)\n\n- Togetsu Kyo Bridge \n\n- Tenryu Ji temple \n\n- Arashiyama bamboo forest \n\n- adashino nebutsuji temple \n\n- Sagano scenic train \n\nDay 7 (Gion / Hirashiyama ): \n\nNanzenji Temple \n\nKeage incline \n\nKodak-Ji temple \n\nKiyomizu dera temple \n\nDay 8 (transfer to Osaka ):\n\nMorning transfer to Osaka (staying near Osaka castle area )\n\nOsaka castle \n\nDotonbori \n\nDay 9 ( USJ)\n\nWhole day at universal studios Japan \n\nDay 10 (Nara)\n\nWhole day trip to Nara  - Nara park , Todai Ji Temple )\n\nDay 11 (downtown/central Osaka)\n\nShinsekai neighbourhood\n\nTestenkaku tower\n\nKuromon market \n\nHi zen Ji temple \n\nDotonbori \n\nDay 12 ( transfer to hakone )\n\nTransfer from Osaka to odawara .\n\nLuggage has been transferred to Tokyo via courier service.\n\nShuttle bus from odawara to ryokan by lake aishi \n\nStay in ryokan and relax .\n\nDay 13 (hakone )\n\nPirate ship to south of lake aishi/motohakone port.\n\nWalk around shore to Hakone shrine .\n\nBus back to odawara .\n\nTrain back to Tokyo.\n\nDay 14 (Tokyo)\n\nStaying at Tokyo shiodome.\n\nFree day / souvenir shopping.\n\nFlying back in evening.\n\nQuestions :\n\n1.

This way you\u2019ll have easy access to the trains subways and buses and Nishiki market and even Gion is walking distance and there\u2019s heaps of department stores and food options nearby. \nWe bought Shinkansen tickets from Tokyo station the day before so we are guaranteed a seat (paid extra for the reserved seat) as we traveled during the recent sakura season.",

I've been a little anxious about the transport around Kyoto.\n\nI'm still mixing and matching my itinerary from the base around Shijo station. Do you still have your itinerary from that base by any chance I could take inspiration from please?",

We stayed at Hotel Grand Bach for 3 nights. \n\nNext day we bought the one-day bus/subway pass from a kiosk and took the local bus to Higashiyama area/Philosopher's path. Walked south to Keage Incline and then took the subway  to Kyoto station to pick up pre-booked Sagano train passes.\n\nThen we took the local bus to Kinkakuji temple, made it an hour before it closed. Took the bus back to our hotel for a quick rest. Then at night took a bus to Kiyomizudera where we walked through Sannenzaka, past Kodaiji park, through Maruyama Park, through Gion and back to our hotel. Roughly a 3km walk according to Google maps.\n\nNext day we went to Arashiyama, took the Sagano train but unfortunately the boat ride back to Arashiyama had been cancelled that day, so we took the train back to our hotel instead to rest. Night time spent in Fushimi Inari.\n\nNext morning after checkout we had our luggages shipped to Tokyo, bought stuff in Nishiki market, then took the shinkansen to Hakone for an overnight trip.",

Favourite areas were around Gion / Pontocho /  Tatsumi Bashi,  down to Dera for sunset. \n\nArashiyama - I wouldn't skip the money park personally. Also for the scenic train it's probably similar to the one you'll be doing in Hakone to Gora. (actaully just saw you're not doing that so nevermind)  \n\nNara took us a whole day at a leisurely pace. \n\nHakone could add a walk down the old road to Amazake Tea House after the temple (get to the shrine early) then bus back to the boat and the checkpoint. If the visibility is Ok consider the ropeway up to Mt Hakone after the shrine. The volcanic black egg area on the ropeway to Gora was cool.",

I did this about a month or so in advance. \n\nNot saying it needs to be done this way at all. I just did it for my peace of mind",

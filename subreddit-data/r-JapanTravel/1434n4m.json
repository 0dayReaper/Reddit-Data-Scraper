    "postText": "We are a family of 4 with two young kids, a toddler who\u2019s nearing 3 years old and an infant who is 9 months old.  We visited Japan in May of 2023 for 18 nights. We stayed in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka, and took day trips to Nara and Kobe.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nSome people might call us crazy for taking an international trip with two small children.  But my wife and I, who were avid travelers before we had kids, hadn\u2019t been out of the country since 2019 due to 1) having kids and 2) Covid.  We were itching for a trip, so we took the chance.  Were there some crazy times?  Of course.  Was it worth it?  Definitely.\r  \n\r  \n\rI did a lot of research and prep before the trip, but there are always surprises that come up when you have kids.  I\u2019ll try to share some of the lessons I learned on the trip.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n\u2014Flights\u2014\r  \n\r  \n\rThis was our first time on an airplane with the kids.  I was a bit worried beforehand and in retrospect the flights were the worst parts of the trip.  The main advice I\u2019d give is do as much as you can to make your flight more tolerable, which no doubt means spending more money on tickets and gear.  But it\u2019s worth it.\r  \n\r  \n\rI considered a few different airlines for this trip: ZipAir, Singapore, ANA, and Japan Airlines.  JAL was too expensive.  ZipAir was interesting because they provide car seats, you don\u2019t have to take your own.  We didn\u2019t rent a car in Japan so we didn\u2019t need our own car seats.  I was just worried about racking up extra fees on ZipAir.  Singapore and ANA were similar, they both provide bassinets and the price was similar.  I ended up going with ANA for two reasons: 1) I had flown ANA on a previous trip and been happy with them and 2) they fly to Haneda instead of Narita, which saves you time getting from the airport to your hotel.\r  \n\r  \n\rWe opted for 3 seats and a bassinet.  My infant is big for her age so she barely fit in the bassinet (she\u2019s 21 pounds).  But we were glad to have it.  I had to call in to ANA customer service which had an hour+ wait time to get the bassinet, but other than that it was no trouble.\r  \n\r  \n\rWhich leads me into probably the most important part of flying with kids on a lengthy flight:  get your kids to sleep on the plane.  The more they sleep the less likely you are to run into a tantrum or meltdown.  \r  \n\r  \n\rTo encourage sleeping we did a few things:  1) Take an overnight flight  2) Get a bassinet for our infant 3) Get a JetKids bed box for our toddler.  Our ANA flight from LAX left at 5pm, which allowed time for the dinner service to show up before we put our kids to bed.  They set the bassinet up right after you get to cruising altitude, so it\u2019s there the majority of the flight.  Our infant rejected it at first but eventually fell asleep.\r  \n\r  \n\rAs far as our toddler sleeping, the JetKids worked well.  There was a bit of trouble with it staying in place since we had bulkhead seats, but overall I was happy with it as a bed.  I absolutely hate the JetKids a piece of luggage though, it\u2019s not easy to lug around and holds nearly nothing.  But it helped our toddler stay asleep most of the flight.  You don\u2019t necessarily need a JetKids though, other airline seat bed solutions may work just as well.  Just bring something that will help your toddler sleep.  If we had to do it again, I think I\u2019d prefer having car seats over both the bassinet and JetKids.  That\u2019s  probably what we\u2019ll do on the next trip.\r  \n\r  \n\rThere were a few unexpected problems we ran into on the flights.  On the first flight, our infant got motion sickness and spit up multiple times.  She ruined one of my shirts and my wife\u2019s pants.  Not to mention my wife got motion sickness as well so I had to do most of the heavy lifting with the kids alone.  It was a sleepless and messy flight.\r  \n\r  \n\rOn our flight home, there was a mechanical issue with the plane.  They said we were losing oil.  So on a Tokyo to Los Angeles flight we somehow ended up landing In Anchorage, Alaska.  It goes without saying this was horrible and the flight home from Anchorage on Alaska Airlines was horrible too.  But that\u2019s not really relevant to flying to/from Japan so I\u2019ll leave the details out.  We won\u2019t be flying with ANA ever again.\r  \n\r  \n\rTo reiterate, do what you can to make your flight easier.  Get the non-stop flight.  Get the extra seat.  This isn\u2019t the area to be frugal.\r  \n\r  \n\r\u2014Stroller\u2014\r  \n\r  \n\r\rSo you survived the flight.  How do you get your kids around once you\u2019ve landed?  We have two kids so we need a twin stroller right?  Wrong.  Taking a twin stroller to Japan is a huge mistake, don\u2019t do it.\r  \n\r  \n\rMost guides will tell you to use a carrier, and if you only have one small infant then that\u2019s likely the way to go.  But with two kids we used a travel stroller and carrier combo.  At first I expected to only use the carrier and carry the stroller around until we needed it, but I quickly realized that carrying the stroller around all day is a huge pain.  We have the Cybex Libelle which is small at 13lbs, but 13lbs is still heavy enough that you don\u2019t want to carry it all day.\r  \n\r  \n\rSo our stroller remained deployed basically all the time.  My infant sat in the stroller most of the day, until it was my toddler\u2019s nap time.  Then the infant went in the carrier and toddler in the stroller to sleep.  It worked well for us.\r  \n\r  \n\rHow did we keep the stroller deployed the whole time?  Elevators.  Lots of elevators.  And occasionally carrying it up and down stairs.  The availability of elevators depends on where you are.  Of the cities we visited, I\u2019d say Tokyo is the best and Kyoto is the worst for elevator availability.  \r  \n\r  \n\rThe wide majority of metro and train stations are going to have elevators.  It can be hard to find the right entrance to use to find an elevator, but there is always signage and almost always a map.  You may need to walk an extra 5 minutes, or wait in line, or get lost, so always give yourself extra time when catching a train if you are using your stroller.  We spent a LOT of time looking for elevators on this trip.\r  \n\r  \n\rWe only found two stations our whole trip that had no elevator at all, one was the JR Kobe station and the other was a JR station in Tokyo (I forget which one).  When this happened, I picked up the stroller and carried it with our infant in it on the stairs.  If our toddler was in it I made her get up and walk, then carried the stroller.\r  \n\r  \n\rThe other problem at metro / train stations with a stroller is the gap between the train and the platform.  There\u2019s always either a gap or the train and platform are at different elevations.  You don\u2019t have a lot of time to get on / off the train so this was a constant source of anxiety.  Once our stroller wheel got stuck in between the train and the platform.  It took some effort to pop it out.  Another time my toddler stepped in the gap, but luckily I was holding her hand and stopped her from falling in.  Always be mindful of the gap when you have kids.  It\u2019s probably one of the least safe situations you\u2019ll constantly run into in Japan.\r  \n\r  \n\rMalls and shopping centers almost always have elevators.  You may need to wait a while to get one though.  In the malls with 10+ floors, you might need to wait 5 minutes for an elevator.  Sometimes they have \u201cpriority\u201d elevators for the handicapped and strollers but often times perfectly abled people rudely take up all the space in those elevators.\r  \n\r  \n\rWe thought we would have trouble taking our stroller into restaurants but it was actually much less trouble than expected.  There was only one restaurant that flat out turned us away, Sushi Tokyo Ten in Roppongi.  Other establishments will usually move a chair so you can put your stroller at the table or counter where the chair was.\r  \n\r  \n\rSo overall the stroller was annoying to use but I don\u2019t think we could have done the trip without it.  It was a necessary evil with two young kids.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n\u2014Shinkansen\u2014\r  \n\r  \n\rWe used the Shinkansen to get between cities.  We had two trips, Tokyo to Kyoto and Osaka to Tokyo.  We did not bother with the JR Pass, it wasn\u2019t worth it.  Mostly because our trips were 8 days apart so we would\u2019ve needed the 14 days pass which wasn\u2019t worth it for two Shinkansen trips.\r  \n\r  \n\rOne thing that caught us off-guard about the Shinkansen is how quickly it leaves a station when it makes a stop.  We were expecting to have some time to get on when the train arrived, but it\u2019s basically the same as a Metro stop.  You have to get on right away.  We made the mistake of buying a reserved seat for a train leaving in less than 15 minutes, without knowing where the elevator was.  So we scrambled to get to where we needed to go on the platform and were the last ones on the train.  We jumped on the train at the last second, we wanted to get to our specific car from the platform but we weren\u2019t going to make it. It\u2019s a miracle we didn\u2019t lose a piece of luggage or a kid on the way.  On the second trip I reserved a seat on a train that was 40 minutes out.\r  \n\r  \n\rAs far as seating we only needed to buy two seats.  We would have put our toddler on our lap if needed, but we didn\u2019t need to.  Basically, one side of the train has 2 seats and the other 3.  If you find a row that has the window seat open on the 3 seat side, then it is very unlikely anyone will sit in the aisle seat if you reserve the window and middle seat.  We basically got a free seat for our toddler this way on both trips.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n\u2014Baby supplies\u2014\r  \n\r  \n\rWe had more trouble than expected finding baby supplies.  A lot of guides online tell you to go to drugstores, and maybe we were going to the wrong drugstores but that wasn\u2019t working out for us.  We were distraught until we by chance came across Babies R Us.  Yes, the Babies R Us that went out of business in the USA.   We happened to be browsing the malls in Odaiba when we came across this gem.  It\u2019s a treasure trove of western style baby food and supplies.  \r  \n\r  \n\rOur infant is in the \u201cpur\u00e9e\u201d food stage and we didn\u2019t find any in drugstores.  Most of the baby food is juice or rice porridge.  Babies R Us has aisles worth of pur\u00e9ed food.  It has diapers, wet wipes, formula, nose cleaners, and basically anything else you\u2019d ever want for your baby.  We stocked up on everything when we found this place.  There are several locations but we went to the Odaiba location in Tokyo and the Harborland location in Kobe.\r  \n\r  \n\rAnother smaller store we found in the mall below Tokyo Skytree is Dadway.  They don\u2019t have as much as Babies R Us but we did pick up some pur\u00e9e here.\r  \n\r  \n\rThe other place we picked up diapers and a few others things is Don Quijote, which has locations all over the place.  Their baby food collection is basically as limited as drugstores, but it\u2019s fine in a pinch.\r  \n\r  \n  \n\u2014Eating\u2014\r  \n\r  \n\rI\u2019ve spoken a lot about logistics, but I had one primary reason for going to Japan: to eat tasty food.  I had been to Japan once before I had kids and fell in love with the food.\r  \n\r  \n\r\rMost guides will tell you families should go to family restaurants.  Nope.  Not happening.  We did not go to a single Saizeriya or Bikkuri Donkey.  And I definitely did not go through all of this trouble to eat at Denny\u2019s.  We went to a total of ZERO family restaurants.  \r  \n\r  \n\rI\u2019m here to tell you there are plenty of good restaurants you can go to with kids.  Even with a baby.  Even with a baby and a toddler.  \r  \n\r  \n\rI\u2019ll tell you my main approach to finding restaurants that will allow kids to dine with you.  Your main tools are: Tablelog, Google Maps, and the individual restaurant websites.  Tablelog is a great tool and their \u201cwith children\u201d section on the restaurant info page is very accurate.  If a restaurant is listed as \u201cBabies are welcome\u201d or \u201cBaby Strollers accepted\u201d, then you can very likely eat there with a baby.  If a place does not have such a listing, it isn\u2019t necessarily a no, it\u2019s a maybe.  That\u2019s when you need to search Google Maps reviews for \u201ckids\u201d, \u201cchildren\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d to see if anyone mentions the restaurant\u2019s stance on such things.  If you can\u2019t find anything on Google Maps, go to the restaurant\u2019s website.  If they have an online reservation system, it is likely to list their stance on kids on the reservation page.\r  \n\r  \n\r\rI did a lot of research beforehand and pinned all the relevant restaurants on Google Maps.  That way, no matter where I was, I could find some good kid tolerant restaurants.  I say \u201ckid-tolerant\u201d instead of \u201ckid friendly\u201d because I consider \u201ckid-tolerant\u201d to mean that they let kids in the restaurant, while \u201ckid-friendly\u201d means they have a kid\u2019s menu, high chairs, etc.\r  \n\r  \n\rWe were able to eat at a wide variety of restaurants, from overpriced Michelin starred places to budget Omakase places.    There are a lot of restaurants in Japan.  If a restaurant doesn\u2019t let you in because you have kids, it\u2019s fine because there\u2019s another similar one that will.\r  \n\r  \n\rThis is a list of good restaurants we ate at with our infant and toddler.  These are just the places we made it to, there were plenty more I had on my list we didn\u2019t make it to:\r  \n\r  \n\rGion Maruyama, Gion, Kyoto\r  \n\rSushi Wakon, Four Seasons, Kyoto\r  \n\rThe Oak Door, Grand Hyatt, Tokyo\r  \n\rKobe Plaisir, Kobe\r  \n\rRoku Roku, Grand Hyatt, Tokyo\r  \n\rDaiwa Sushi, Toyosu Market, Tokyo\r  \n\rInshotei, Ueno Park, Tokyo\r  \n\rSushidan, Eat Play Works, Tokyo\r  \n\rNishiya, Shinsaibashi, Osaka\r  \n\rTonkatsu Wako, JR Isetan, Kyoto\r  \n\rSoju Dining, Tokyo Midtown, Tokyo\r  \n\rImakatsu, Roppongi, Tokyo\r  \n\rMizuno, Dotonbori, Osaka\r  \n\rRokurinsha, Tokyo Station, Tokyo\r  \n\rTsumigi, Tsukiji, Tokyo\r  \n\rLots of different food stalls in Tsukiji Market, Tokyo\r  \n\r  \n\rOther times we ate at conveyor belt sushi places, department store basements, or ramen places.  The basements are a good place to get something for everyone.  My toddler ate a lot of gyoza and noodles on this trip, she didn\u2019t take a liking to much else.  But Ichiran and Ippudo were right down her alley.\r  \n\r  \n\rTsukiji market was our go to breakfast place when we stayed in Tokyo.  There\u2019s plenty of different choices there and it opens early enough for jet-lagged families.\r  \n\r\r  \nOverall I had a great time eating.  If my toddler is eating she\u2019s usually not having a tantrum, and we tried as best as possible to put our infant to sleep before we went to any higher end restaurants.  There were some awkward tantrum moments but for the most part it was fine.\r  \n\r  \n\r\u2014City by City Report\u2014\r  \n\r  \n\r\rTokyo\r  \n\r\r  \nWe had two different stays in Tokyo, the first after landing in Japan and the second  right before departing Japan.  We stayed a total of 10 nights in Tokyo, but we wish we had even more.  \r  \n\r  \n\rWe could have come to Tokyo alone the whole trip and been perfectly content.  It has the best food, the most kid friendly facilities, and there\u2019s plenty to see and do.\r  \n\r  \n\r\rHere\u2019s a few choice things we did with the kids:\r  \n\r  \n\rDisneySea:  My toddler loved this one.  We\u2019ve been to Disneyland in SoCal but this is completely different.  Even I was excited since it\u2019s been a long while since I\u2019ve been to an unexplored Disney park.  A lot of people will say DisneySea is for older kids but there were plenty of rides my toddler could get on.  It\u2019s a great place for toddlers.  A must visit with kids.\r  \n\r  \n\rUeno park: We spent a whole day in Ueno Park.  There\u2019s a great zoo, a fun Natural History Museum, and good restaurants.  We picked up bento boxes from Inshotei and ate them at a picnic table in the zoo.  I think this park is also a must do with kids.\r  \n\r  \n\rOne of the city views: you have a few choices here but we went to Tokyo Skytree and Shibuya Sky.  Shibuya sky is a little less kid friendly, because they don\u2019t allow strollers on the roof and they have some weird rules about holding your baby on the roof.  I think they\u2019re scared of a wind gust pulling your baby off the roof?  I like the mall at Tokyo Skytree, and there\u2019s a Rokurinsha there too (very good dipping ramen).\r  \n\r  \n\rSmall Worlds:  This is a miniature museum on one of the man-made islands in the bay.  It\u2019s a little out of the way, but we made a day out of Toyosu Market, Small Worlds, and Odaiba.  My toddler liked this one, the exhibits are interactive and fun to look at.  It was better than expected.\r  \n\r  \n\rOther than that we did a lot of eating and shopping in Tokyo for us adults.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nKyoto\r  \n\r  \n\rKyoto was probably our least favorite city to do with kids.  In general it\u2019s just hard to get around.  There\u2019s a lot of stroller unfriendly places.  Streets without sidewalks.  Rough cobblestone-like roads.  Temples are not stroller friendly.  Hills everywhere.  Good luck getting to the top of the monkey park with a stroller.  It\u2019s definitely a trend in this city.  \r  \n\r  \n\rMaybe if you have older kids it\u2019s fine.  But if you have younger than elementary school kids it\u2019s probably skippable.  There\u2019s not that many kid friendly activities here either.  Temples aren\u2019t interesting for kids.  The best kid activity here is probably the Arashiyama Monkey Park.  My toddler got a real kick out of feeding the monkeys.  Just be aware there is a significant hike to get to the top of the hill where the monkeys are.  My toddler is a pretty good walker, she made it all the way without crying or complaining.  But I saw some other kids that didn\u2019t fare as well.\r  \n\r  \n\rThe other thing you might try near the monkey park is the Arashiyama bamboo forest.  I think it\u2019s one of the most overrated sights in Japan though.  It\u2019s just mobbed with tourists all day.  It\u2019s not enjoyable with the crowds.  I\u2019ve been here twice and I\u2019ve been disappointed both times.\r  \n\r  \n\rI doubt we will be back to Kyoto any time soon.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\rOsaka\r  \n\r  \n\rOsaka was nice.  It was a bit refreshing to have many of the Tokyo conveniences again.  Elevators everywhere, well paved and flat roads, and plenty of baby rooms.\r  \n\r  \n\rOsaka is a good base for taking nearby day trips as well.  We went to both Kobe and Nara without needing to take the Shinkansen.\r  \n\r  \n\rThe best kid experience in Osaka is the Kaiyukan aquarium.  It\u2019s big.  The central tank with the whale sharks is impressive.  They have lots of different animals from all over the world.  It\u2019s bigger and better than any aquarium we have in California.  \r  \n\r  \n\rThe one thing I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the lines.  You need to pre-book your timed entry tickets online.  We didn\u2019t, and ended up getting tickets that were for entry two hours later.  And we were there right when they opened.  If I go to the aquarium at opening time on a weekday where we are from we can walk right in.  Lesson learned.\r  \n\r  \n\rWe stayed in Shinsaibashi and it\u2019s a very walkable area.  There\u2019s a covered shopping street that goes all the way down to Dotonbori.  Namba is walkable from there.  And America-mura is between Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori.  \r  \n\r  \n\rThe Daimaru mall in Shinsaibashi is good for kids.  There\u2019s a Bornelund in there with a small indoor playground, a Pok\u00e9mon Center, and good food.  \r  \n\r  \n\rI liked Osaka overall.  The only thing I thought was a let down was okonomiyaki.  \r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nNara\r  \n\r\r  \nNara was worth the trip.  It\u2019s about 45 minutes from Namba on the train, so not too out of the way.  \r  \n\r\r  \nThere\u2019s deer all over.  Deer that bow to you.  In the park, on the sidewalk, in the street.  It\u2019s a unique experience you should see at least once.\r  \n\r  \n\rThe deer are rather aggressive when you have food for them.  It\u2019s not a place where you want your kids feeding the deer.  As soon as you buy the food from the street vendor, they mob you.  They try to snatch the food out of your hand.  Make sure you watch someone else do it first before deciding to do it yourself.  If I let my toddler do it she probably would have been terrified.  \r  \n\r  \n\rThe other must see in Nara is Todai-ji.  It\u2019s impressive.  The giant Buddha is something.  This was probably the best temple we saw on this trip, it\u2019s visually stunning.  More than anything we saw in Kyoto.  I did have to carry the stroller up and down some steps, but there\u2019s not too many.\r  \n\r\r  \n\r  \nKobe\r  \n\r  \n\rKobe was great.  It exceeded my expectations.  The trip from Osaka is easy.   We spent a full day there.\r  \n\r  \n\rWe started our one day in Kobe at the Nunobiki Herb Gardens.  I wasn\u2019t expecting too much but this place is really nice.  It\u2019s big, with lots of different gardens and exhibits to see.  There\u2019s great views as well.  We took lots of pictures.  \r  \n\r  \n\rThere\u2019s a few different places to eat and drink in the gardens as well.  We had some sparkling rose at \u201cThe Veranda\u201d which had a great view of Kobe.  We didn\u2019t eat because we had a lunch reservation down the hill.\r  \n\r  \n\rThere\u2019s a few things to watch out for.  This place gets busy, so get there early.  There\u2019s no reservations, you just go early and wait in line.  When we left at midday the line was massive, so get there when they open.\r  \n\r  \n\rThe herb garden only takes up the top half the hill. At first I thought it extended to the bottom of the hill, but the bottom half of the hill is actually a hiking trail without gardens.  So I bought a one way gondola ticket to the top expecting to walk down all the way, but after I realized the garden ended at the middle I bought another ticket to go down (instead of getting the round trip ticket like I should have).\r  \n\r  \n\rAfter the gardens we went to eat Kobe beef.  Kobe Plaisir was the restaurant I chose, which was both high end and had a kids menu.  The beef was great and everyone had a good time.\r  \n\r  \n\rAfterwards we went to Harborland.  It\u2019s a nice area on the harbor that has a big boat you can go out on, and a couple of shopping malls.  The Anpanman museum is here too but by the time we got there tickets were sold out for the day.  This is also where you can find a Babies R Us.\r  \n\r  \n\rOur Kobe day was one of the best days of our trip.  I\u2019d suggest a day trip here for anyone.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n\u2014Closing\u2014\r  \n\r  \n\rIt\u2019s hard to travel with kids this age.  No doubt.  Everything will take more time and be more expensive than when you used to travel alone.  But I do not regret taking this trip at all.  As a matter of fact I want to go back right now.  My wife loved the trip, and my toddler might even remember it when she grows up.  She still talks about feeding the monkeys and how dad ate a \u201creal fish\u201d  (A Japanese sweetfish they grilled in front of us at Gion Maruyama).  Japan is a great place for a first family trip.",

We\u2019re headed to Japan for the first time since before children, with our now almost three year old, and this trip report was great to read.\n\nWhat did you do for breakfast for your toddler? We\u2019ve never been breakfast people, but it\u2019s essential for our toddler. We\u2019re thinking pikelets from 7-11 or similar?",

Usually we don\u2019t let her have more than an hour or so of screen time a day but on the flight you have to do whatever you need to to keep them happy.  Bring their favorite toy, their favorite show, whatever it is that makes them happy.  We also brought along some of her favorite snacks.  She did sleep rather well on the plane though, out of a 12 hour flight she slept 7-8 hours.\n\n2) Turbulence wasn\u2019t much of an issue for us.  We didn\u2019t run into any serious turbulence.  We were a bit worried that we would need to wake up our kids if there was turbulence, which would no doubt trigger a tantrum, but it didn\u2019t happen.  While my toddler was asleep we just kind of buckled the seat belt over top of her and it was fine.\n\n3) My toddler had the sniffles the first few days, but nothing serious.  We didn\u2019t need to find a doctor or anything like that.\n\n4) Ear pain was also a non-issue.  I guess we got lucky?",

Royal Park and The Flag were great, but I probably wouldn\u2019t stay at Candeo again.\n\nWe did not stay near DisneySea.  It was about an hour trip each way from Roppongi.  In my opinion changing hotels is harder than doing the commute.  My kids got used to riding the train and often fell asleep on the longer trips so it wasn\u2019t so bad.  I guess it kind of depends how long you are going to spend at Disney as well.  For one day I wouldn\u2019t bother with the extra hotel.  If you\u2019re spending a few days there it might be worth it.",

If you can\u2019t get an extra seat, then you\u2019re probably going to need to take turns holding your one year old.  One adult sleeps, the other holds the kid, then switch off.  Alternatively, there might be room for someone to sleep on the floor?  I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d allow it though.  It\u2019s definitely not the ideal situation.",

We just got back from a month in Japan with our 20-month old and everything you say here resonates. \n\nFood is a big part of why we travel too and so we were glad that there were definitely still good options. One thing we found helpful was that many restaurants have private rooms available, often without any extra cost. Especially if we were going somewhere that was going to take &gt;1hr to eat, having a private room where she could walk around a little bit and play without disturbing others was super helpful. That said, we also ended up eating without the baby a few times (either switching off and going alone, or later in the trip my mother-in-law joined and could watch her) and I'm glad we did that too!",

We did take our stroller with our infant in the restaurant and it took up a space for a seat.  Obviously we didn\u2019t get a bowl for my infant, so maybe they wouldn\u2019t have required it for my toddler as well.\n\nWe skipped the really popular ramen places just because they have massive lines, and I don\u2019t know of any ramen place that does reservations.  There was a highly rated ramen joint down the street from our hotel in Kyoto, Menya Inoichi.  The line there was incredible, they said it was a 2 hour wait.  My toddler definitely is not waiting in a line for two hours!  So we skipped it.\n\nSo I guess my answer to your question is: no one required us to buy a bowl for our toddler, but we didn\u2019t really make it to the most popular places.",

We didn\u2019t, and ended up getting tickets that were for entry two hours later.\n\nWe were also there in May and went to the aquarium. With their extended hours we arrived at 5:30pm and walked right in and could move around freely without crowding.\n\nIt's a cool setup being able to view the various tank from multiple levels, but lacks the impact of Churaumi's massive glass wall.  I wouldn't say it's significantly better than Monterey Bay Aquarium overall which seems to offer more activities and programs for kids.",

The only time he ever slept well was Frontier when we bought him a seat for his car seat, he slept the whole time straight through.\n\nJ bassinet was no help.  He wasn't going within 10 feet of that thing.\n\nInternational J was a waste of points because he basically just wanted to explore the cabin the whole time, giving us no rest.\n\nWould consider splurging for one of the \"room\" style seats so he can explore but be confined.  Otherwise I think Y with a car seat is the best.\n\nHad no idea that \"no kids allowed\" was a common thing in Japan - no wonder their population is shrinking.  Our first international trip was to Portugal where it was FEDERAL LAW that families with infants got to cut to the front of every line and businesses generally would bend over backwards for you.",

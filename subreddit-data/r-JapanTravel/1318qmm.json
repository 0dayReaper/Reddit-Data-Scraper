            "comment": "Ok, 1st thing I noticed is you have 5 Days of \"Hikes\".\nBeing an avid camper/hiker myself, I think this is too much IMHO, for a few reasons. 1) Sure Japan and World  Heritage Sites are nice, but you'll be missing a whole bunch of what \"Japan\" has to offer, and more than just their scenic trails. If you REALLY want to do a super cool trek, look up \"Nakasendo Trail\". The Magome\u2013Tsumago is the most popular section of the Nakasendo trail and it\u2019s easy to see why\u2014the path takes you through two of the most well-preserved historic post towns and lets you stroll through stretches of the Japanese countryside and a peaceful forest and waterfalls along the way entire a hike is about 3 hrs, not including sight seeing in towns. Basically this could be done in 1 Day all-in-all. I would insert this just BEFORE Kyoto, it would be a great change of pace from Tokyo, then Kyoto itself is arguably the Best City in the World. Maybe send your luggage to Kyoto from Tokyo and Stay a night along the trail. \nI'd eliminate the rest of the \"Day Hikes\" and save your real hiking for Mt. Fuji. I think 3 days of hiking would be perfect. This allows for the rest of the time to enjoy Japan. \n\n2) Even though you might be eliminating \"Day Hikes\" you will still do PLENTY of walking every day. Both times we were there we averaged anywhere from 8-13 miles in a day.\n\n3) Another thing I'm not sure you are quite aware of is how HOT Japan is. It's due to it's Humidity I'm from Florida and there were times in End of September that it was simply WAY TOO HOT. 5+ days of Hiking and in a row might be A LOT in the heat. \n\nWhile Nara is a good day trip to do, you may want to dedicate a Full Day and more importantly Night to Osaka. Dotonbori really comes alive at night and eating and drinking a long here is something to really try and do. There is in excellent place to stay really close \"[Dormy Inn Premium Namba Hotel &amp; Onsen](http://www.agoda.com/sl/03523cc71df). \nAs for restaurants [Izakaya Toyo](https://g.co/kgs/7UKnkE)(on Netflix) and Japan's famous [Jiggly Cheesecake @ Rikuro's ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N9WgroLLR6xBqi6p8) believe it or not, it makes an excellent breakfast with a cup of coffee. (BYOC). I THINK like a Day and a half you could cover most of what you would want out of Osaka. \n\nAs for your Tokyo Itinerary [Teamlab Planets](https://g.co/kgs/UzoW3k) was arguably my favorite thing to do in all of Japan. Make sure you don't miss that. [Kikanbo](https://g.co/kgs/8wmyXb) in Asakusa is the best Ramen I have ever had (Skip breakfast and go very hungry for lunch it's a lot). And [Tapas Molecular ](https://g.co/kgs/wbx2KP) (Molecular Gastronomy) sits at top as the best meal I've ever had in my life. \n\nI'm sorry I know that's a lot, but it's something I think you should digest and think about. Also make reservations for as many restaurants as you can, and DON'T BE LATE to reservations. If you find yourself with an extra day I'd add it to Kyoto. You'll understand when you get there, there's such a large variety of stuff to do from Hiking, Nature, Shrines, Kinkakuji, Gion, Nishiki Market, Pontocho Alley, Arashiyama, Fushimi Inari (another great Day Hike), Kiyomizu Dera (another \"hike\" if you start at the bottom near Yasaka Pagoda) try to time it for Sunset. Have a great time and GL to you.",

But I'd do research if you want to do it as I mentioned in the previous thread. The route I suggested can be done in about 3 hours not including sight seeing in the towns. With travel time it will probably take you all day, but from what I have heard it is well worth it, to get out of the city and see the real beauty of Japan.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the recommendations!\n\nI had looked into the Nakasendo trail but decided against it because of the travel time between the trail and the cities I'd like to stay in. Based on Google Maps it looks like it would be over 3 hours with multiple transfers on public transit from Tokyo, Kyoto or the Fuji area. I don't like the sound of that unless we were staying overnight in a town on the trail, which would mean devoting two days to it.\n\nIf there is a section of the Nakasendo trail that is worthwhile and under 2 hours from those areas I would definitely be interested!\n\nI wasn't expecting all three days in Fujikawakuchiko to be long hiking days. Depending on the weather and amenities in the hotel we book we may spend a lot of time indoors. I like the suggestion that someone else made to rent bikes and tour the lake. We went to Taiwan in August a few years ago and survived the heat and humidity there. Biking up hill into Taroko Gorge was one of the sweatiest days of my life and the best part of the trip. \n\nGiven the feedback I've gotten I'm considering adding a day in Osaka between Hiroshima and Kyoto and staying in Kyoto until the 18th, cutting one day in Fujikawakuchiko. I hadn't considered how many short hikes there are around the edges of Kyoto and was worried about being overwhelmed by Obon crowds in the city center, so thank you for those recommendations.\n\nUltimately I like slower travel than a lot of people. I don't want a ton of hotel changes or long travel and sightseeing planned for the same day. Hopefully this won't be my last trip to Japan and I'll be able to make to everything I miss another time!",

                            "comment": "So one idea to help with this would be that if you got baggage service from Tokyo to Kyoto and pulled out a day pack before you left Tokyo You could go to Osaka for an overnight stay and survive off of the day pack (as it's only 1nt) and then when you get to Kyoto the following day, your luggage should be waiting at the next hotel This makes transferring multiple cities MUCH easier. Also depending on which train you take from Osaka to Kyoto it's only 30min (regular train $5) 15min (Bullet Train $15). Luggage service DOES take about 24hrs, so keep this in mind whenever you use it.",

Are you sitting on the 1st base side (home team) or 3rd base (visitor)? Looks like they are playing the carps. \n\nI don't particularly find the Imperial palace that interesting. The grounds aren't as nice as some other parks. Consider the Hamarikyu gardens a little to the south. Also, the shotengai in Yanaka, south west of Nippori station is nice. \n\nI wouldn't bother visiting Nara from Kyoto. There is plenty to see in Kyoto without the long train ride. Osaka is an option. Also, I absolutely love Himeji which is between Hiroshima and Osaka on the shinkansen line. It's been under repair for nearly a decade and it's finally done. It's still made of wood compared to Hiroshima castle which is mostly concrete. If you can find the time in your itinerary it's a great place to visit and the only castle you need to visit during your trip.  You can probably visit on your way too or from Hiroshima if you leave early-ish, but Engyoji might be difficult to fit in.",

If you have any tips about getting tickets I'd appreciate it - booking things on Japanese websites has been confusing so far.\n\nAnd yeah, I'm iffy about Nara because most travel content I see about it focuses on the deer, which we'll be getting plenty of in Miyajima. Cutting it from the itinerary will allow more time in Kyoto or Osaka.\n\nIf its easy to store or forward our luggage I think stopping at Himeji between Hiroshima and Kyoto/Osaka sounds great, I'm just anxious about the train situation during Obon. I'll probably decide on that once we're able to purchase train tickets.\n\nThank you!",

The best seats maybe sold out, but you\u2019ll have a good time wherever you sit, and the outfield often has the biggest cheering section. \n\nhttps://www.yakult-swallows.co.jp/en/\n\nYou can probably also buy them from machines in the conbinis but you\u2019ll need a guide or staff help. I\u2019d get them early if you can. A weeknight game though, you can probably walk up and buy them if all else fails. \n\nSending luggage is pretty easy and you should be able to do it from your hotel. Trains will be most crowded the beginning or end of obon. From himeji to Osaka you can catch a normal express JR line for 1520 yen taking 62 minutes. Shinkansen is 41 minutes for 3280. At worst you might be standing for some of it or in separate seats, but I\u2019d probably just do the express train, Shinkansen if going to Kyoto probably. 44 minutes vs 90. The very last trains out of himeji to Osaka or Kyoto leave as late as 10 or 11pm, but you won\u2019t be staying there that late. Should be plenty of time to find a train, even if it\u2019s crowded.",

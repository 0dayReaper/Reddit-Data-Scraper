    "postText": "I've just arrived in Fukuoka, cycling from city to city. There's two days of bad weather upcoming Thurs-Fri, so I want to do a city break before setting off again. Is it worth spending three more days in Fukuoka, or cycling to Kitakyushu tomorrow ahead of it and waiting out the rain there? Which is a more unique stopover in your opinion? Fukuoka seems good for shopping, parks and food, but quite light on actual sightseeing/things to do. Kitakyushu has more museums/unique places, but from what I know it's mainly an industrial port. Which would you stay over in?",

And They love it.\nIf you want same level of Sushi, it will cost more than 5 times in Tokyo.  \n\nKarato ichiba is not in Fukuoka pref. It is in Yamaguchi (but very close).\n\nIf you google map, use \u5510\u6238\u5e02\u5834 for search.\nEnglish Karato ichiba lead you somewhere else.\n\nhttps://www.karatoichiba.com",

Those are two former coal mine towns that quickly became two of the poorest cities in Japan after coal mine shutdown. There's a museum in Tagawa on the history of mining.\n\nOtherwise, I think there's more to explore in Fukuoka than Kitakyushu.",

Not only the former coal mines that can be located throughout the cities, but also ancient burial mounds and edo era streets. \n\nIt also happens to be the hometown of former prime minister Aso, who referred to Iizuka as the ghetto, so I was curious to see what it's like. \n\nIn reality, I found such descriptions to be exaggerated after visiting, but I did catch some subtle hints like billboards for buraku liberation and communist sentiments. I also had a friend living there that drove me around and shared his experience, which made the trip eye-opening and educational.\n\nI'm not sure if coal miner cuisine is a thing to be honest.",

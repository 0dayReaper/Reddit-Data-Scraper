I am just guessing since I haven't been there myself, but the riverside (Sumida river, not Arakawa) on the south-west end of the bridge looks like it'd offer a clear view, and the distance isn't that huge. There will undoubtedly be people there, but it should be mostly people living relatively locally. Might be easiest to walk up from Machiya station. \n\nOtake Bridge: https://goo.gl/maps/ie3spiJ8XpLEJ88r6 \n\nMaybe you can also consider going to Adachi-Odai station or Ogi-Ohashi station on the Nippori-Toneri Liner and heading to the south or north banks of the Arakawa. At those points, the crowds should be much thinner. You can maybe just walk along towards the main area  and then stop when the crowding starts.",

Or a very long view - my toddler will probably lose interest after 15 minutes.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!",

    "postText": "Background: Indonesians here. me and my wife went for 2 weeks trip late April until 1st of may (I avoided golden week, whew!). This was basically first time my wife went out of the country for holiday. So I tried to take down as many attractions as possible even though this is my 3rd time (previously 2017 and 2018) going to Japan. \n\nAs trip report seems boring, I will do attractions report:\n\nAttractions (this is on timeline scale, first one was what I experienced first):\n\nUSJ, Osaka aquarium, Arashiyama bamboo forest, Nara park, Hakone loop trip (Owakudani, Lake Ashinoko), Teamlab planets, Madam tussauds, Unko museum, Disneysea, Disneyland, Sanrio Puroland, Gundam factory yokohama, Art arquarium museum, Skytree observatory deck.\n\n--+++--\n\n- USJ:\n\n*Note to self: 3 months weather prediction can be very inaccurate \n\nIt was raining :( but I pushed through, and it was fun. Very empty, maybe because it was raining and close to golden week, people tend not to go out. Harry potter and forbidden journey 30 mins, koopa challenge 60 mins, yoshi adventure 30 mins, the rest were below 20 mins. For some reasons flight of hippogriff 70 mins. I bought the fastpass as in my previous experience harry potter was like 2 hours, and it felt like a waste, I didn't use it except for koopa challenge and harry potter.\n\nMe and my wife had a blast, she love harry potter and it was her dream to visit one and we took our time to immerse in the area. Nintendo land was definitely the highlight of the theme park, it felt so unreal to see these characters in 3D. So cute. Koopa challenge felt like kinda meh for me, they limit how many shells you can shoot, not fun. Don't miss the yoshi adventure as it will bring you to see more areas and characters in the land.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Osaka Aquarium:\n\nWhale shark! You won't realise how big they are unless you meet one. The aquarium itself has some other enclosures such as penguin, dolphin, and sea lion. The most unexpected one was mola (sunfish). They also have large spider crab (or is it king crab?). I thought it will be like 1-2 hours attraction, but surprisingly we took 3 hours in it!\n\n--+++--\n\n- Arashiyama Bamboo Forest:\n\nIt was just.. bamboo forest? Not sure what was the hype with it, it didn't look good, very crowded (I saw around 5 tour companies). Not recommended, don't waste your time to this one. I do recommend you to try gio-ji and jakko-ji, which is a moss garden (and has some bamboo too) north of arashiyama bamboo forest.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Nara park:\n\nIf you are afraid of any big animal, you might be in trouble as they can smell your food and stalk you. My wife was so hyped about the deer, but once she met one, she was so afraid of it that she gave her remaining deer crackers to me. Market near the station has good selections of restaurants if you are hungry. \n\n--+++--\n\n- Hakone loop:\n\nIt was a loop that go from odawara station, to owakidani crater via sight seeing train and gondola, then gondola to sight seeing cruise that has pirate theme crossing lake Ashi (very beautiful but very cold). On clear day, you can see mount fuji too. We had fun but it was too cold.\n\nTip: buy the 2 days hakone pass even if you only use it for 1 day. It is cheaper. Even cheaper if you use all 2 days, for example to stay in ryokan or trying out onsen.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Teamlab Planets:\n\nIt was super fun! I get why people complained about the flooring. It was basically rubber flooring gave up as many people stepped on it, but it was not slimy and still rough. I went there around 10.30 and it was kinda empty? Took me like 10 mins to get in. \n\nMy most fav part was definitely the flower projector dome, take your time there, laying down, look at the flower, and you will feel falling down after awhile, it was very trippy. Oh, 2nd most fav is definitely the light show, I could stay there for 30 mins or so just to try different patterns.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Madam tussauds:\n\nDead attraction, very empty. A lot of japanese famous people which I never heard of, like 40-50% of it are japanese. We went in only like 30-40 mins and be done with it. The only reason I went there was because my wife never been to one before. It was my 4th madam tussauds, so it was not that exciting anymore (other 3 were singapore, london and beijing).\n\nNote: madam tussauds is in the decks odaiba, which is close to other attractions such as joypolis (a VR attraction), or life sized unicorn gundam at diver city. But what interest me the most is actually on their 4th or 5th floor, the have the whole floor for fun things, haunted house, old 80s-90s arcade, mystery box shop, old snacks and sweets shop, trick eye museum, etc. Recommended to go if you would like to see or buy some wacky stuffs.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Unko Museum:\n\nNeat little attractions, it was poop museum. At start, they will ask you to pose sitting on a toilet bowl and tried to poop, and a plastic poop will come out, and it will be you accompanion poop throughout the museum. It was a great place if you like taking selfie. Sone cute mini games esp the poop catching game. It was a 30 mins or so attractions. Neat if you just want to look for quick fun.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Disneysea:\n\nMy fav theme park in the whole world, doesn't feel like disney at all, but attention to detail is so awesome. Sadly, it was almost stormy that day, but me and my wife pushed through and got rewarded, the park was very empty most of attractions were below 40 mins. We finished everything (yes, everything except raging spirits) around 6PM (During my previous visits, I couldn't finish everything even until 9 lol). And then wait for the new night time show which was very very beautiful. \n\nHighlight of the day was soaring. I went to disneyland hongkong soarin and it was meh, but this one, amazing. The show scene was magical, the ride itself was amazing, they combine dome projector with wind and scent (yes scent! You can smell grass, ocean, even indian parfume).\n\nMy fav is still 20,000 leagues under the sea, rode it few times to see the details, it was a very well made ride. My wife also picked this one as her fav, going into the sea and see some wreckage and sea creatures!\n\n--+++--\n\n- Disneyland:\n\nIt was sunny! :) And very empty, I guess it is not because of the rain, but because people were waiting for the golden week and held back themselves from spending money elsewhere.\n\nBeauty and the beast was 50 mins, and the rest were below 30 mins.\n\nIt was a very fun day and we finished everything around 5PM. My wife said disneyland is definitely her fav out of USJ, disneysea and disneyland. She said it was much more magical \n\nThe highlight was pooh honey hunt, bouncing trackless ride. The beauty and the beast was good, but it was always spinning and made my wife dizzy.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Sanrio Puroland\n\nCute little theme park if you like sanrio characters. They have 2 dark rides and many shows. They were trying really really hard to sell photo to you, one of the dark ride has like 6-9 photo shoot *facepalm (the kuromi mydrive one).\n\nMy highlight definitely gudetama show if you understand japanese. It is basically interactive show where gudetama converse with the audience. 2nd fav is actually their small houses in the park, it has many fake shops, such as chocolate factory, candy shops, etc and you smell chocolate, candy and pudding in the fake shops! Very intriguing.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Gundam Factory Yokohama\n\nIt was far, the only reason I want to go is to buy limited gunpla that only sold here. To enter you need to pay 1650 yen, and the shop is inside of the paid area. The moving gundam was awesome, and they have this museum where they show robot that can build gunpla (albeit very simple, but it is jaw dropping). Worth going if you like gundam.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Art Aquarium Museum\n\nSmall neat art museum full of gold fish, it was beautiful, but you can pass it if you don't mind, very hard to locate, it is in a department store on 9th floor.\n\n--+++--\n\n- Skytree Observatory Deck\n\n350 meters high observatory deck, you can look tokyo from up high, you can even see tokyo disneysea and land (albeit very far and small). If you see photo area and it said it is free, DON'T do it! It was a scam, the free one has your pict like 3cm \u00d7 3cm and they will ask you whether you want to purchase the bigger version which is 1500 yen.\n\n--+++--\n\nAnd that's it, hopefully this helps people who wants to pick which attractions they wanna do. I actually also paid for teamlabs garden osaka, but didn't go, too tired.\n\nTips: if you can understand japanese even for a little bit, that will help a lot with the immersion. I can understand some words which enough for me to understand what's going on. My wife was very confused and bored during the gudetama or stitch encounter (they rely heavily on interaction with audiences) since she didn't understand a word. I was laughing, following signs, and clapping while she was yawning (I did tell her what's going on so she didn't feel left out). I guess watching a lot of anime and gaki no tsukai helped me in unexpected way lol",

I did go to some other attractions in 2017 and 2018 but I don't think it will reflect the current state as it was already 5-6 years ago. \n\nSome others attractions I went in 2017 and 2018:\n\nSunshine City Aquarium: amazing small aquarium, the highlights were the penguin and garden eel.\n\nSkytree Planetarium: amazing place to relax and see stars, it was like 30 mins or so? Where you basically on a chair but it faced up.\n\nToei Kyoto Studio Park: a park which used to film old samurai film. Good for selfie as they will throw you back into edo era with a lot of convincing props. They also have fun small attractions such as how they do stunt in a ninja / samurai movie, or ninja challenge. Neat if you don't mind spending a day there.\n\nKowakien Yunessun Onsen: an onsen where you don't need to be naked! They have 2 sections, naked and non naked one. The non naked one is more adventurous. They have many different type of onsen, such as coffee onsen, tea, wine, sake, etc. It was like swimming pool but hot. It smells like swimming pool too, aka a lot of chlorine smell.",

The promo photos make it look at lot more colorful and vibrant than it actually is. However, I would recommend the Monkey Park. The monkeys were fun obviously but my favorite part was the really nice view of Kyoto at the top of path.",

                    "comment": "Can you change friday to like monday - thursday? It will be less crowded vs on friday.\n\nThe queues getting into the park was insane, but moving really fast, japanese tend to wait like 30 mins - 1 hour earlier before the opening time (opening time right now is 8.30). So people will be arriving around 7.30 and wait.\n\nYou also need to pass the security check before going into the park. It is a very simple check to see if you bring food (water is fine) or selfie stick. It won't take long, but do take it into account when you plan the time\n\nYou need to buy your ticket in advance unless you stay in one of official disney resort hotel. There is no ticket booth in both disneysea and disneyland.\n\nThey also offer happy 15 mins (going into park 15 mins earlier) if you stay in their most expensive hotel, tokyo disneyland hotel, ambassador and miracosta. You can basically bypass the crowd this way.",

So that's odd.\n\nThanks for the heads up regarding the ticket booth and all the other stuff though! :)",

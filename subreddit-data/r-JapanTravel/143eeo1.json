I plan to go off the beaten path often so it allows me to do so.  \n\nI had to change my flights due to airline issues so I added two days with a different airline and rearranged the end of my trip to truly make this my dream vacation. \n\n***June 10th - June 20th: Main base - Tokyo***\n\n**June 10th**\r  \nLand in Narita around 4 pm.

I'm pretty sure June is already gone for the Pokemon Cafe as well.  It is generally easier to book the Pokemon Cafe in Osaka than Tokyo.  the food is super cute but not very tasty.  \n\nIf you want to splurge there is a limited time Pikachu Tea at the Strings.  It's expensive, but I suspect the food is better,  (I've not gone yet, just have reservations.) \n\nMake sure you know all your connecting times if you are going to Nabana no Sato to see fireflies.  You don't want to be stuck in Nagoya.  I would also check out bus times and just make sure you don't get stuck there, because it's sort of far from places and you can't walk easily to the nearest train station.",

I was thinking of just doing that and checking out the gift shop. \n\nI will check out the Pokemon caf\u00e9 in Osaka if possible. The themed restaurants are not a deal breaker for me so if I cannot go, then it is no harm done.",

It depends on what you want, though honestly, I can't imagine getting the food to go, because the experience of being int he cafe is part of the reason to eat the food.  As an example we got the pizzas, which are all available as take-out and compared to the Pokemon Cafe they're good, but are they actually good good like I would eat them without my kid?  Not so much.\n\nWe hung out in the tiny but chock a block gift shop while waiting for your reservation time lol\n\nJust make sure to check bus and train times with Nabana no Sato.  It's really awesome, and I am glad I went, but we went while we were staying at the Nagashima Hotel, so we got a free shuttle from the hotel (and I drove from Kuwana Station to the hotel.)\n\nIt's not a location a lot of people go to, we went for the Winter light up.",

It's a really nice walk from the gate to the shrine\n\n\\- Samurai Museum is closed\n\n\\- For Yokohama I'd recommend checking out the Minato Mirai area\n\n\\- Kobe and Osaka days are pretty packed. You might end up having to skip some stuff depending on how long you stay at some places\n\n\\- Main thing your Tokyo part was missing was a day where you do Odaiba (take the monorail across the rainbow bridge and try to sit in the front) and Tsukiji fish market",

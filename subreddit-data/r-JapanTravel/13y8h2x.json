    "postText": "As we all know the coming changes to JR Pass will likely make the nationwide pass obsolete for all, but the most cunning (or very niche) visitors - we foresee changes to the way people approach to Japan with increasing focus on staying in the cities, which enable them to make a full use of regional passes, or to take advantage of many day trips.\n\nWe'd like you to share your ideas for using those hubs to the fullest for short-term and medium-term tourism-related stays, including your ideas for itineraries, day trips, eating out, entertainment and just having a general fun all around.\n\nToday we'd like to discuss Sapporo, which is the largest city in Hokkaido and also a major transport hub that link the western and southwestern part of the island with its interior. While regional airports in Hokkaido exist, **New Chitose Airport** is still the most likely starting point for people entering Hokkaido.\n\n|**Info Panel**|**Sapporo**|\n|:--|:--|\n| Main transport hub | Sapporo (JR, subway, bus terminal) |\n| Airport | New Chitose Airport (direct train, limousine buses) |\n| Entertainment district | Susukino |\n| IC card | Kitaca (major) |\n| Peak season | Early February, late July to August | \n| Day trip destinations | Otaru, Biei/Furano, Noboribetsu, Asahikawa |\n\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

            "comment": "TL;DR: I think Asahikawa is the better hub than Sapporo for many travellers to Hokkaido.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the benefits of a bigger city (or maybe if you're new to traveling in Japan), you definitely want to make Sapporo your hub. If shopping and nightlife are your interests, it's definitely your spot (although in that case I question why you don't go to a bigger city on Honshu instead). Or I guess just in general, if you want to spend more than 1d in Sapporo for sightseeing or such.\n\nBut if you want to explore the interior parts (or really anything that isn't SW of Sapporo), I would strongly suggest you check out Asahikawa instead. Or maybe one of the other towns with an airport, depending on where exactly in Hokkaido you plan on going.\n\nAsahikawa is the better base for a lot of day trips and activities (incl. Biei and Furano which OP mentioned) - and the 2nd largest city of Hokkaido, so you still have many city benefits. Plenty of onsen towns around as well. It has more of a countryside feeling and is very close to the Daisetsuzan National Park too.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like Sapporo and can absolutely understand anyone who wants to go there - I just don't necessarily recommend it as the hub for Hokkaido.",

I'll probably end up in Hokkaido in Feb and I over estimated how long I would be in Sapporo aka 2 and a half weeks. \n\n\nAlso not sure about driving since it is winter time, and Japan roads being the exact opposite (I am from the US).\n\nI was thinking about doing 1 week in Sapporo, 1 week in Asahikawa and a couple of days eastward in Hokkaido then after I would go south to Noboribetsu then Hakodate. I guess this ends up becoming like 3-4 weeks in Hokkaido in the winter time.",

If need be it has an airport, otherwise it's where two train lines meet so you can go east/west as well as north. It connects to the places that aren't easy to reach from Asahikawa reasonably well. Just keep in mind that public transportation (particularly frequency of services) gets worse rather rapidly in the Japanese countryside.\n\nBut I guess calling Kushiro a \"hub\" might be a bit of a stretch, so I said base instead :)",

The Hokkaido leg of our trip is still my favorite.  We spent 4 days in Hokkaido in 2019.  It's a good length to not need a car and we really enjoyed that part of the trip.  \n\nDuring that time we went to Moiwa Ropeway, Otaru, Noboribetsu/Jigokudani, Shiroikoibito, Maruyama, Sapporo Beer Garden/Genghis Khan, and walked around Sapporo. \n\nThe day trips to Otaru and Noboribetsu were amazing and we used public transit.  \n\nAccording to my Google history, the train from Sapporo to Otaru was around 50 minutes.  The bus ride to Noboribetsu was 1.5 hours.  In this situation, there wasn't much time being saved if we had gotten a car.  The public transit route was very direct.\n\nI also really enjoyed our simple hotel location right near Sapporo Station.  It was centrally located to public transit and we enjoyed everything around us (we're not night life people tho).  We stayed at the JR Inn Sapporo-eki Minami-guchi.  \n\nI only mention this because they had a wall of different types of pillows you could use (one per person, per day, must be returned the next day).  There had to be like 30+ different pillows with different stuffings.  It was so fun and interesting.  We still think about that hotel lol.   There's even a little Spa/Public bathing area included.  The staff was super nice and helped us book our reservation to dinner at Genghis Khan.",

A lot of roads will be closed, and for the mountain passes that are open you will probably want to put on snow chains for the passing (practice putting them on in a parking lot first if you've never done this before).  If you stick to the flatlands things should be a lot more reasonable.\n\n4 wheel drive and modern traction control/assist in the car help a lot, but they also easily give an inexperienced driver a false sense of security - you get too isolated from the road, and don't feel as easily when the traction starts to get loose,  and the automated aids can only do so much. You have \"grip\", until you suddenly have absolutley no grip, and by then it is already too late and you're on the way to the nearest ditch or sidewall.\n\n  If you see the traction control symbol flash in your dash while driving, take it as a clear sign you should probably take it easier - it doesn't light up unless you're already trying to fight the laws of physics.",

I know it's pretty expensive but Conrad hotels in Japan have children stay for free policy, if they can use the existing bedding. All in all in June, I got 14 nights at various Conrads in Korea and Japan for my family of 4 (wife, me, and 2 minor children). Booking most other hotels for 4 occupants came out more expensive since I had to either book 2 rooms or a suite. I usually get a complimentary upgrade due to hotel status so I don't typically book a suite. So it was the most economical option for that tier of hotels.\n\nAnd Conrad is running a promotion currently where if you book at least 3 nights, the third night is free... Together with the Hilton promotion where if you pay for 4 nights with points, you get a free fifth night, and a free night certificate, I didn't spend as much as I feared for all those nights. Plus, I'll end up with a boatload of points afterward, since I'm paying for my bother and parents' rooms (so 20 nights at Conrad, 4 nights at Hilton).",

            "comment": "If you're visiting USJ and want to spend some time at Dotonbori and also interested in jaunts to Kyoto and Nara, Hilton Osaka is very centrally located. Not the best hotel for any one of those places, but maybe the best one if you want to go to all of them. And it is an excellent hotel and the price is not that bad. Also, if you're a Hilton Honors member (free to join), you get 25% off food at the hotel restaurant.",

            "comment": "I'm sure that there are hidden gem type locations all around the city but for most people, you want easy access to the trains and the plausbility of walking to some of your preferred destinations. So the most popular locations with lots of hotel choices are Umeda and Nanba. I'm here to put in a vote for Nanba just because it's stupid close to get on a major train station and get anywhere fast, and if you're planning to walk Dotonbori, Shinsaibashi/Ebisubashi, etc, then you might as well be staying somewhere within walking distance of those anyway. \n\nWe stayed at the Vessel Inn Namba, it was very very very nice and a relief to have everything so easy to deal with at the start of our trip. Only drawback if you consider it one was that it defined \"small\" for the room size - our two beds were smooshed together to make one big bed alcove with no central aisle. I thought it was fun, though it did make it hard to store our luggage. But the free drink lounge downstairs was nice when we didn't want to go back outside to hit up 7-11, the staff walked us through takkyubin so we didn't have to panic, and literally just rolling out and being half a block from Dotonbori proper (and across the street from Sex Machine, a bar I wish I had gone to) was a dream. There are a lot of hotels in that area, including the Dotonbori Hotel with its bizarre head-pillars out front. We loved being so close to everything (including a Donki) and being able to sit with the windows open and enjoy watching the activity below, and then close them at night and not hear a single sound. Staying near any popular walking area with nightlife means making sure the windows are soundproof; I anticipated this being a bigger problem across the country than it turned out to be.",

It's the cleanest budget hotel I've been to in the area, and single rooms cost 3000-4000 yen per night. They're very small, so it's not ideal if you have lots of luggage.",

    "postText": "My (30F) husband (31M) and I are taking our first trip to Japan this May. Many thanks to this community for your itinerary ideas and trip reports that have helped us form our itinerary. We are taking a bit of a food tour through the big cities and have therefore reserved many of our dinners ahead of time.\n\nI'm a chronic overplanner, but tried to make up for that by making much of our itinerary optional. Optional things will be in *italics.*\n\nMy main questions are:\n\n\\-Are there things that we should remove from our itinerary altogether?\n\n\\-Are there any big logistical issues in our plans?\n\n# Sun, May 14: Tokyo\n\n1420 Land in Tokyo\n\nBuy a SIM card to last 2 weeks\n\n* SIM: Ubigi: download eSIM prior to leaving. Activate upon arrival.\n\nThings to take care of at the airport:\n\n* Limosine bus\n* Tokyo subway pass 72h\n* SUICA card: Load with 2000jpy x2\n* JR passes: 2F. If the line is too long we can do this at Shinjuku station.\n\nCheck into hotel. Stop at 7-eleven to withdraw 20,000jpy and print our sumo tickets.\n\n1900 Dinner: All you can eat sukiyaki/shabu shabu at Nabezo Shinjuku-Sanchome\n\n*Check out the view from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building*\n\n*Drinks at Bar Benfiddich*\n\n# Mon, May 15: Tokyo\n\nShinjuku\n\n* Isetan Shinjuku: explore the basement\n* *Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden*\n\n1130 Lunch at Kobe Beef Kaiseki 511 B1F DIA PLAZA AKASAKA, 4-3-28 AKASAKA, MINATO-KU, TOKYO\n\nHarujuku\n\n* Takeshita Street\n   * Purikura Land\n* Omotesando\n\nShibuya\n\n* Meiji Jingu (can do this in the early morning to avoid the crowds if we wake up early)\n\n1800 Dinner at Usukifugu Yamadaya\n\n*After 9pm: Bar-hop along the Shinjuku Golden Gai, Omoide Yokoch\u014d*\n\n# Tues, May 16: Tokyo\n\n0800 Tsukiji fish market\n\n* *Namiyoke Inari*\n* *Matcha stand maruni*\n* *Okame*\n\n1200 TeamLab Planets\n\n1500 Check out the Sumo wrestling tournament\n\n1730 Dinner at Sushi Yuu\n\n*Roppongi Hills, Mori garden*\n\n# Wed, May 17: Tokyo\n\nIkebukero\n\nSunshine City\n\n* Sunshine 60 Street (shopping)\n* Pok\u00e9mon Center Mega Tokyo\n* Namco Namja Town\n\nNakano Broadway\n\n* Mandarake\n* Capsule Toy Specialty Shops\n* Sun Mall Shopping Street\n\n1820 Shibuya Sky to watch the sunset, booked.\n\n# Thurs, May 18 Tokyo to Hakone\n\n0700 Take the Odakyu line to Hakone Yumoto station\n\n0900 Drop off our bags at the luggage service / lockers\n\nSightsee in Hakone with the Hakone free pass\n\n1600 Check into ryokan\n\n# Fri, May 19 Hakone / Kyoto\n\nLeisurely morning.

It kills your day and places that have been popular on instagram tend to get ridiculous long queues. Especially during peak hours. 12-13 &amp; 18-20. So avoid them as best as you can.\n\nBeing more flexible with food means less wait times and the chance to discover something new.",

I find i also get a little templed out in kyoto/nara, so it might be good to cut it down to a few very distinct temples and a few very distinct shrines. i personally think seeing the mossy stone lanterns at kasuga taisha in nara are more interesting than some of the buddhist temples but that might just be me.  I didn't think the red bricks or chinatown in yokohama were really something to write home about, but the parks around the waterfront were really lovely and was a huge highlight for my husband. We were pretty underwhelmed by hoppy st tbh if you are planning on stopping by there for supper on the night you're around asakusa, ueno is a short train ride away, and its ameyoko/market area around the train station is significantly larger. i also noticed you wrote down 7:30 -8 as early morning - just a heads up that things tend to open and close relatively early, which works well if you're coming in from north america with jetlag lol.",

And in retrospect, we did spend a lot of times at parks, and checking out temples without entering, so that might be why the 10am opening time didn't bother us!  ooh if you have time, the walk along the river is pretty nice in arashiyama, we ended up enjoying this more than the bamboo forest itself lol. If you are a chronic overplanner, take a look at how to order ramen from a vending machine and how to eat tsukemen! We struggled hard on our first night with both of those haha, but it was fun lol. I dont know if it matters for you, but we dont like the smell of smoking, so we had a hard time finding izakayas that were non-smoking in osaka, so we ended up getting some delicious chinese food instead lol and saved the izakayas for tokyo where smoking is less common.",

It would probably be a more enjoyable day if there are spaces for coffee breaks to rest up a bit!\n\nKiyomizudera is also huge and has a bit of climbing up hills and stairs, and has a cute street filled with gift shops right in front of it. It took us 3h (7h30-10h30) between the shrine and the shopping.\n\nWould it be possible to do Fushimi Inari and Kiyomizudera in separate days?",

The bikes were fine but by time we got them and then learned we couldn't just park them wherever.. It was sort of a pain. The Nara JR station had really nicely free maps with rhe bus route and a helpful visitor center too. Not sure what the other station in Nara has but the yellow city bus stops there too. There are several busses in Nara but the yellow city loop bus was easiest and takes Suica cards. As a (not creepy) bonus, we got on it once and about a dozen school children got on and it was just about the cutest thing too.",

Using your phone is an option too. \n\nA LOT of bars in Golden gai have charges just to sit down from 500 up to 2000 yen or higher. Bar hopping can get expensive, check for charges before entering and chalk up an expensive bills to experience. \n\nIt seems like you are missing a lot of the sumo matches arriving so late. They can be kind of interesting and the arena is a lot more empty/relaxed. \n\nYou are looking at 3 hours from Hakone to Kyoto, then another 40 minutes by bus to get to Kinkaku-ji. It's really out of the way, and you might have to wait for a bus. If I recall, there isn't an easy way to get from Kinkaku-ji to Nijo, I'd recommend a taxi and probably switching the order with the market as Nijo is between the two. Maybe bus 204 for Nijo or 12 for the market. \n\nI'd probably skip the trip to Nara. It's just more temples and there are plenty in Kyoto. They'll all start look the same at some point. You already have a pile in Kyoto. Consider the zen temples for something along the same lines, but different. Rock gardens, moss gardens bamboo etc. Have some alternative things on your list or consider a trip down to Osaka (about 30-40 minutes)\n\nI'd highly recommend Himeji, and if you get there early consider Engyoji.

We'll be bringing two backpacking backpacks there. I do worry that if we accumulate more luggage for souvenirs in Tokyo it'll become a problem.

You\u2019ll probably have better luck at shinyokohama station where the Shinkansen stops rather than Yokohama station. More likely to have a luggage service. \n\nYeah. They are on opposite sides. Gundan factory is near Chinatown, so you can probably see some of it before catching the train back. You can walk to the red warehouse district too, but it\u2019s fairly large, and minomirai walkable from there. As long as you aren\u2019t spending too much time at a location you might be able to make all of them. I generally spend more time in areas so I don\u2019t hit all of them when I go to Yokohama.

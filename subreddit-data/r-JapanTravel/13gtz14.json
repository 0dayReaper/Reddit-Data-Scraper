    "postText": "We were in Japan in March for about three weeks. And we loved it.\n\nJapan is a stunning country with incredible food, breathtaking nature, and top-notch infrastructure. \n\nThe Japanese people are incredibly hospitable and kind, and their custom of expressing gratitude with numerous thank-yous and bowing is contagious - you will find yourself doing the same before you know it. I lost count of how often I found myself smiling because people were so welcoming and warm-hearted.\n\nJapan is a land of amenities at unexpected turns that make life so much easier - from those toasty toilet seats to exceptional hospitality. You will be spoiled rotten, and leaving the country will break your heart. \n\nAnd the food - oh, the food! Japanese chefs are true artists, and their cuisine is simply divine. It is no surprise that Japanese food is now my absolute favorite. I still crave the food I have tried there and cannot wait to go back for more.\n\nTrust me on this: when you are in Japan, make time for the food! \nI have met someone who skipped out on Japanese food while in Japan, and it is such a missed opportunity. Unless you have allergies or truly dislike the flavors, you have got to give it a try. Do not leave Japan without trying food - you will regret it!\n\nAnyway, I compiled a list of things I hope will be valuable to you.\n\n\n# Connectivity/internet\n\nLet us start with this because you will need a good internet connection during your trip, especially if your itinerary is busy. You can find public hotspots easily, but having data on your phone can be more beneficial.\n\n1. Tourist SIM card that you can buy in Japan \n\n    If you are in Japan as a tourist, you can buy a SIM card specifically designed for tourists. These SIMs can be pricey, and while they offer calling capabilities, you will likely find it not worth it unless you speak some Japanese. It may be a waste of money because you cannot talk to anyone due to language barrier. It may be worth it if the price is comparable to other options. Although, there are usually cheaper alternatives available.\n\n2. eSIM \n\n    These are usually more affordable and hassle-free options than tourist cards. Most phones do support them nowadays. And there are many different providers out there, but according to recommendations on this subreddit, Ubigi, and Airalo are two of the best. They are also easy to set up.\n\n    We decided to try out both Airalo and Ubigi. While their prices are similar, Ubigi was the clear winner when it came to speed.\n\n    Airalo was frustratingly slow - we had trouble loading photos on Google Maps, and basic web browsing was challenging. Since we relied heavily on maps, translation, and other online tools, we preferred Ubigi.\n\n    With Ubigi, we experienced no latency and everything was seamless - it felt like we were using our phone in our home country.\n\n    Both providers had some connection issues in Arashiyama (Kyoto) and Takayama, but aside from that, they were generally stable.\n\n3. Pocket WIFI \n\n    If you are not sold on the eSIM idea, another option is to rent a pocket WiFi device. Some people swear by them, but I'm not a fan because you have to carry them around and keep an eye on the battery life, which can be a hassle.\n\n    That being said, I have a friend who managed to get an unlimited data plan for only $10 for the whole month! It might be worth looking into it.\n\n4. Roaming packages from your provider \n\n    Another option is buying roaming packages from your own SIM provider. They are usually more expensive, or your provider might not have such an option. But it is worth a try to find out.\n\n\n# Apps\n\n1. Maps \n\n    I would recommend downloading offline maps if you are using Google Maps or apps such as Maps.me, since maps will be one of the apps you often use.\n\n    Google Maps proved to be necessity for us. The offline Maps.me mode was nice to have for walking directions to preserve battery life.\n\n2. Toilet finder \n\n    Check Toilet Finder apps which show where the nearest toilet is. Japan has a lot of spotlessly clean public restrooms, so you eventually find one, but these apps can be helpful if you are in a hurry. \n\n    My favorite toilets are mid-range to luxury department store toilets since they can be a little bit more advanced, providing better comfort :)\n\n3. Translation apps \n\n    Communication can be challenging in Japan, as many people speak hardly any English. Learning enough Japanese to have daily topics of conversations may not be realistic for a short trip, but learn at least few basics to help your trip easier.\n    \n    Keep a translation app with a conversation mode app ready. We found Google Translate reliable, but its photo mode can be a hit or miss. If you are not getting results, try zooming in or translating smaller sections. \n\n    u/OnePunkArmy recommended Papago, that I have no experience with. But it can be good to keep multiple apps.\n\n    Asking for directions can be tricky, even if you show someone a map or destination. If you are stuck, try to find an information desk or look for JR ticket officers - they usually speak excellent English.\n\n    Most hotel staff have at least a basic level of English. If you need more help, ask if someone who speaks better English is available.\n    English proficiency tends to be better in larger cities like Kyoto and Tokyo, but do not expect everyone to understand you.\n\n4. JapanTravel\n\n    With u/gosell1's reminder: This app is really helpful. See their comment for how the app helps with transportation needs. It also helps locating a public hotspot. And provides information on variety of things such as food, art&amp;culture, nightlife, shopping, etc.\n\n\n# Restaurants - where to eat\n\n## Avoid peak hours\n\nWaiting in line for most restaurants may not be worth it, especially if the wait time is more than an hour. Instead, try going there before it opens or at odd hours, such as 3:00 PM for lunch if it is open. However, note that most restaurants have breaks between lunch and dinner.\n\nFor example, only a few people were in line when we visited Gyukatsu Motomura at 5:00 PM. When we left at 6:00 PM, the line had already grown to more than 20 people.\n\n12:30 and 18:30 are peak lunch and dinner times. Do not be offended if a restaurant cannot have you. Many tables may appear empty, but they are often fully booked. In 99% of cases, this is the reality and has nothing to do with racism. So, be respectful and leave to try other restaurants instead.\n\n## Don't linger\n\nAlso good to keep in mind is that restaurants in Japan are simply for eating and not lingering around. Owners like to say they are closed even 30 minutes before closing time to tourists because tourists overstay their welcome. \n\nThis is not true for some restaurants such as Izakaya style, or family restaurants. But that means you should go earlier there to make sure there is an empty spot.\n\n## Be adventurous\n\nBe adventurous and willing to explore different areas and restaurants. While you might have a list of recommended places to try, do not be afraid to wander off the beaten path and discover hidden gems. We found a cheap and extremely delicious katsu restaurant near Shibuya Crossing, and there was no line. \n\n## Reservations\n\nIt is also worth noting that some restaurants may use the Line messaging app for reservations, so you can create an account and use translation apps to request reservations this way. You can also ask your hotel to help you make a reservation.\n\n## Lunch sets\n\nLunch sets are usually way cheaper than dinner. The portions might be smaller sometimes, but usually it's actually the same portion and up to 50% cheaper. We had great time in yakiniku restaurants at lunch, of which the good ones are usually notoriously expensive!\n\n## Searching for restaurants\n\nBe specific to find the best restaurants near you. Searching directly for dishes like ramen or soba will yield more accurate results than searching for just \"restaurants\".\n\nAnother approach is to translate the type of food into Japanese and search for it. You will find local eateries that are often of higher quality and cater to locals than restaurants that cater solely to tourists.\n\n## Department stores\n\nDepartment stores often have basement floors dedicated to street food-style options, which can be great for any time of the day. These food courts are usually crowded but the lines are shorter. You usually wait only a few minutes, and the prices are reasonable. \n\nAdditionally, many food courts offer discounts near closing time, making it a great way to enjoy cheap and delicious food. Surprisingly, fewer tourists are in the food courts, so you will usually find shorter lines or none at all. \n\n# People are helpful\n\nIn Japan, people are generally welcoming and helpful towards tourists. They often go out of their way to offer assistance, even if you do not ask for it. For instance, a woman once helped us find an open restaurant in Himeji, accompanying us from one restaurant to another for half an hour. It is important to remember that most people have good intentions, but it is always wise to be cautious and not fall for potential scams.\n\n\n# Transportation\n\n1. Local transportation\n\n    Suica/Icoca cards are great options for local transportation, as you can use them in almost every local bus, tram, and train. If you have an iPhone, you can directly add the card to your Apple Wallet and use Apple Pay to top up. (not sure about Google Wallet) \n\n    However, if you often have a low battery, it might be better to go for the physical card. You can easily top the physical card up at any metro station or 7-Eleven, so you will not have difficulties finding the machines.\n\n    u/gdore15 reminded that Suica card may not be valid in local transport options in smaller towns (I have experienced in Takayama as well). Keep cash and coins with you. You can also pay with cash in most buses if your Suica balance is not enough.\n\n2. Shinkansen and JR lines\n\n    You can use JR Pass calculator to see whether it is worth to buy one for your itinerary on JR website. \n\n    Buy it online if you decide to get one since it is cheaper. You can even make reservations online, although you will still need to receive a physical ticket at the JR offices  for individual rides. \n\n    We bought a 5-day JR West Pass and JR Pass 7 days after a few days because it was better for our itinerary.\n\n\n3. Taxi\n\n    Taxis are generally expensive, but they can be worth it for short distances if you are tired or need to go up a steep hill. Since you will be doing a lot of walking, plan your transportation options ahead of time. Check the train and bus schedules. \n\n    You don't need to open the door in most taxis, because they are automatic.\n\n4. Google Maps\n\n    Google Maps can be unreliable when it comes to transportation options because it does not always show all options at the same time. Check for alternative routes by adjusting the departure time by 10 minutes before or after to see if there is a better option available. This is especially important for the Shinkansen, as not all trains travel at the same speed. You might be able to arrive earlier by taking the train at a different time.\n\n    Check u/Rheddit45's comment below for tiers of trains that can be helpful with planning your trip.\n\n\n# Payments and Cash\n\nSmall shops, convencience stores, tax-free stores generally accept Suica card for payments. You can use it for easy checkout.\n\nMost places do not accept Apple Pay but might accept Visa or Mastercard. Bring some cash with you since they don't always accept card payments.\n\nATMs are readily available throughout Japan, but the ones at 7-Eleven banks are the most convenient as they offer English language options and have low commission rates. Be aware that your bank may charge commissions for international transactions.\n\nThankfully, my debit card offers commissionless payments and withdrawals, so it was great to have it.\n\nMake sure to bring your passport because it's required to carry it with you at all times, but also so that you can get tax-free stuff. Tax-free shopping is surprisingly easy in Japan, so totally go for it!\n\n# Time management\n\n1. Rest days \n\n    Make sure to schedule rest days, or at least days with less strenuous activities, especially if you are not used to walking long distances. If you are an avid exerciser, you may be able to handle more activity.\n\n2. Weather \n\n    Allow extra time in case of bad weather for your activity. Rain or snow can easily derail your plans. We had to stay in our hotel one day due to heavy rain and wind. We changed our itinerary to visit museums instead of outdoor activities in other rainy days.\n\n3. Easier Onsen access \n\n    Some hotels offer onsens, so take advantage of the in-house onsens. It can be a great way to relax after a long day of walking. And you can save time by not commuting.\n\n4. Catching transportation \n\n    Train and metro stations can be confusing, and complex. The apps assume you know how to transfer properly. So, be sure to allow ample time between connections or leave earlier if you are trying to catch a train or bus, especially if it's your first time.\n\n    Google Maps is a helpful tool for finding metro entrances and exits, but it can be tricky to find the correct location.\n\n5. Luggage forwarding\n\n    If you have multiple luggage, consider using a luggage forwarding service to/from your hotel, especially since many stations can be complex and have limited accessibility options. \n\n    They usually deliver your luggage in one day, so send it one day before your check-in date. I am not sure how this service works from/to the airport, but that could also be an option for you.\n\n\n# \"Top 5 Things To Do\" lists\n\nThey are top five for a reason. But beware that those areas are crowded with tourists, especially the ones in big cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. \n\nGo early and avoid peak hours if you must go. Or try to find the secret spots. Smaller towns were our favorites because there were fewer tourists. \n\nDo not forget. Everyone goes to Shirakawa-go in winter and Ueno Park during cherry blossom season. Expect heaps of tourists in these locations and go to other alternatives if you do not like crowded areas.\n\nTsukiji market is jam-packed, and more expensive than similar markets in other cities. For example, we had the best maguro don in Kanazawa. If Tokyo is your only destination, it might be good to visit, but if you are going to other food cities, it can be good to skip it and go to fish markets in other cities. \n\nThis can be said for other top 5 locations. Again, they are in the top 5 for a reason, so visiting is recommended, but try to see if you could visit a similar location in other cities.\n\nTo avoid disappointment, book museums and other attractions online in advance. Highly sought-after attractions such as Ghibli Park/Museum are often fully booked, and some may require a Japanese phone number or have websites only in Japanese. Use apps like Klook, Traveloka, or Tiket.com to see if tickets are available.\n\n# Trash\n\nJapan is renowned for being one of the cleanest countries in the world, and this is apparent even in bustling areas like Shibuya where there is little to no rubbish on the streets. \n\nIt is worth noting that there are not many trash bins around, aside from some stores. It is also considered rude to dispose of your trash in another store's bin. To avoid this, it's a good idea to carry a bag with you to store your trash and dispose of it in your own accommodation's bin.\n\nAnother helpful tip is to eat your food directly in front of the store and dispose of the packaging in their trash bin or return the wooden skewer back to the seller to avoid carrying around trash. Eating while walking is generally viewed as impolite, although some locals do it too. By eating immediately after purchasing your food, you can avoid this potential faux pas altogether.\n\n\n# Walking shoes and socks\n\nNow, I believe this is quite important.\n\nSince you will walk a lot, invest in a good pair of shoes. Don't underestimate the amount of walking. My wife had problems and could not walk. After 3-4 days of walking, her feet gave up. We initially thought she had an injury, almost went to a clinic because she could not walk anymore. But actually, it was her shoes. \n\nHer usual sneakers gave her trouble even though it was a good pair. She was so tired after only five thousand steps. We got her new shoes approved by the American Podiatric Medical Association, and her pain disappeared. She could easily walk twenty thousand steps and had no issues after that. \n\nI would not recommend buying a new shoe right before the trip. Instead, make sure you are comfortable with your shoes, and you've already broken into it. We were lucky to find good shoes, but you might not be.\n\nWearing suitable socks is imperative, (as u/Corgi_Hunter reminded) as substandard socks can cause discomfort or even lead to blisters. Ensure that you choose socks that match the type of shoes you're wearing and opt for high-quality, comfortable ones. During colder weather, woolen socks can be a game-changer in terms of warmth.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nAlso check [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/) which is comprehensive and helpful.",

Many people go to family restaurants to study, so the staff don't really care. They may ask you to leave after 2 hours if they're full.",

Had a grilled tuna steak skewer that was cooked to order and probably some of the best fish I've had in my life. \n\nCan't really compare to the other markets you mentioned but I never felt the prices there were noticeably high. The skewer I mentioned was like 650 yen which I thought was pretty fairly priced.",

I've never been to the US, so don't really know that's like, but I've done quite a few European caitals &amp; I've been to Seoul, which I was expecting to be comparable.\n\nOf course, it depends also on what you're doing and how active you make your day, but if you don't mind sharing what do you think made your Tokyo trip worse in comparison to your New York trip? Is it a matter of the city being more spawled out or perhaps because you didn't use the Tokyo public transit as much as you expected? Thanks :)",

In nyc you can generally be within 3-5 minutes of a subway station in Manhattan at all times and the stations don\u2019t sprawl. In Tokyo? Twice that or more and the stations are hugez",

The app assumes you know how to transfer properly, you walk at a specific speed, etc. It's well done app if you're a local and will definitely give the fastest and most optimized option based on a specific time.\n\nChanging time is a potential recipe to board an express train on the same track that does not stop at the station you want to go or goes to a different direction.",

It will find restaurant that serve that specific dish. Works well most of the time and yes it can get more results if you type the dish in Japanese. \n\nMight had different experience, but the food section of department store, where they sell all the snacks, is often he most crowded place of the whole department store.\n\nTrue for IC card until you go deeper in the countryside where their use can be much more limited.\n\nThe electronic suica/pasmo only work on Japanese android phones. There is a function that even if your phone died, the IC card is still usable : just read this https://soranews24.com/2021/07/14/what-to-do-if-your-phone-battery-dies-when-using-a-mobile-transit-pass-on-a-japanese-train/\n\nIt is not cheaper to buy JR pass online.

Even though, it was relatively low season there, all the restaurants were full of people and we really had to look for an empty one for more than 45 minutes. We immediately made reservations for the next day.\n\nI guess it really depends where you are and what you want to eat as you\u2019ve mentioned.\n\nThe food sections in department stores are crowded indeed. But the lines are usually so short that you won\u2019t need to wait more than couple minutes. Which can be a great option instead of waiting, say an hour anywhere else in Dotonbori.\n\n\nThanks for the info about Google Pay. \n\nRegarding Suica. That is correct. I just remembered that we had to pay 100 yen for the bus fee in Takayama and their buses didn\u2019t accept Suica or other cards. I can imagine smaller towns are similar when Takayama is like that.\n\n\nIt is cheaper to buy JR pass online. Ours was 1000 yen more expensive at the JR ticket office.",

Also if you love pre-loved or vintage clothing, accessories, bags, watches and army surplus stuff, Japan has got something for everyone for the whole range of price spectrum.

The guy from the stall was literally trying to cool down the watch with his hands as it was sitting in an old case filled with old watches under the the basking sun! \n\nFor hydration needs, we carried our own water bottles in our daypack as we headed out each day. That can be quite heavy for a day out, the water will be gone by mid-day or so and you'd be carrying the deadweight of the bottles. So I really recommend just getting the water from the vending machine as they typically cost 110-120 yen. That way, you stay hydrated and there'll be a little less stress on your feet.",

So, learning enough Japanese is not always realistic. \n\nTranslation apps and pointing things were enough for us for most of the time. \n\nBut, hey. Knowing Japanese definitely helps.

Everyone can learn a few phrases sure, but that only really accomplishes etiquette and not actual useful beyond that. Even if you learn how to ask how to get somewhere, the answer will likely be too complicated for you.   \nAlmost all Japanese learn some English in their life, its just a matter if they continued to practice it and are comfortable speaking it a little. \n\nAlso, in my line of work I deal with tourists from Asia all the time and I can tell you that PLENTY come to America with zero English language skills and rely on translate apps.",

When I finally get in there, I sit down, and I eat my meal. The salaryman group who were seated after me were pros; they were done eating long before I finished. But I wasn't really taking my time.\n\nThen there was the table next to me.\n\nForeigners who had already been in there for at least 20 minutes before I got in, and who had basically finished their meal by the time I got my food. Just sitting there, talking and taking up a table. Very American-style (what with relaxing at the table long after the meal is complete). Honestly embarrassing. There's no way they didn't know how many people were waiting for a seat, and they were talking about going to a bar next so it's not like they couldn't have just...gone elsewhere. I was out of there before they were, and I don't know how long they sat there, wasting that small ramen shop and its customers' time. Seemed disrespectful.",

I wonder if people would change their behaviour if they are told that they should simply leave as soon as they finish eating.

But this was a tiny store that clearly depended on shearing through customer after customer as quickly as possible, and these people knew there was a line outside. They had to have stood in it. They just didn't care, or didn't notice that people ate, then gtfo when they were done eating. \n\nMaybe I'm just overly sensitive. I was trying to be a good guest the whole time I was in the country. I want to be welcomed back as a tourist, after all.",

We did activities near the restaurant, our whole day is within 5 miles of where we will have dinner. Breakfast and lunch are open, we decide when and where to do that when we see or smell something we want to try. Also my last trip was 2 weeks and I brought $7,000 for food alone and blew through every dime. So be prepared for some good food and some spending.",

Putting your jacket/sweater/purse in the plastic keeps them from absorbing the cooking smell while cooking at your table.  Other restaurants might have storage under your bench seating for the same reason. I typically don\u2019t see this in the states.",

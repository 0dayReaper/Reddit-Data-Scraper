Here is what we are thinking:\n\n**Day 1-5: Tokyo (May 2 - May 6, 2023)**\n\n* Hotel: Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo Otemachi (Splurging on this as my 30th is May 3rd!)\n* Explore Asakusa: Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise Shopping Street\n* Visit Meiji Shrine and Harajuku's Takeshita Street\n* Stroll around Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\n* Visit Tsukiji Outer Market for fresh seafood\n* Explore Akihabara's electronic stores and anime shops\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6-8: Hakone (May 7 - May 9, 2023)**\n\n* Hotel: Hakone Kowakien TEN-YU \n* Activities:\n   * Hakone Ropeway and Owakudani Valley\n   * Hakone Open Air Museum\n   * Lake Ashi sightseeing cruise\n   * Visit Hakone Shrine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9-13: Kyoto (May 10 - May 14, 2023)**\n\n* Hotel: Hotel Granvia Kyoto\n* Activities:\n   * Visit Kiyomizu-dera Temple and walk around Higashiyama District\n   * Explore Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and Tenryu-ji Temple\n   * Fushimi Inari Shrine\n   * Nijo Castle\n   * Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 14: Hiroshima (May 15, 2023)**\n\n* Hotel: RIHGA Royal Hotel Hiroshima \n* Activities:\n   * Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and A-Bomb Dome\n   * Hiroshima Castle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 15: Miyajima (May 16, 2023)**\n\n* Hotel: Hotel Kikunoya \n* Activities:\n   * Itsukushima Shrine and the Floating Torii Gate\n   * Mount Misen and ropeway\n   * Momijidani Park\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 16-18: Osaka (May 17 - May 19, 2023)**\n\n* Hotel: Hotel Monterey Grasmere Osaka \n* Activities:\n   * Osaka Castle and Park\n   * Dotonbori and Shinsaibashi Shopping Street\n   * Umeda Sky Building's Floating Garden Observatory\n   * Universal Studios (if we have time!)\n   * Sumiyoshi Taisha &amp; Shinsekai exploring\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 19-20: Tokyo (May 20 - May 21, 2023)**\n\n* Hotel: Aman Tokyo (Splurging out as it is our last leg!)\n* Activities:\n   * Shopping at Ginza or Shibuya\n   * Odaiba entertainment district\n   * Roppongi Hills Mori Tower and Mori Art Museum\n\n**Day 20: Departure (May 21, 2023)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been fortunate enough to have many years of savings, and I want to splurge for my 30th birthday trip. Some hotels are 4/5 stars, but if you have any recommendations, please let me know a hotel! I do not mind spending on hotels if it also means staying in prime locations. \n\nI would love to get some opinions on the most optimal travel routes. We will have two check-in luggage to carry around (don't ask why, lol), so I'm worried about getting them on the bullet trains, etc. I was told some hotels could mail your luggage to the next stop, but I must look into that.\n\n**Kyoto** and **Osaka** are close together, so we could group them up. And I'm dying to see **Kanazawa** for the amazing culture and samurai district. But it's high up north, so I need to figure out where to plug that area in for a night if it's worth it. So where would we take a night from to add in Kanazawa?\n\n**Golden Week** will suck, but my birthday lands on May 3, so there is no option other than staying in **Tokyo**.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts and feedback!",

If you are going from place A to place B (and will be at place B for more than a couple days) just have the luggage sent there. If you are going to place B for one or two nights only, then just have your big luggage shipped straight on to place C.\n\nI was kinda surprised to learn you can have your luggage sent some time in advance, like maybe a week. There were signs in one of my hotels saying that luggage to go to the airport MUST be sent at least 2 days in advance. So when I went to ask the front desk they seemed ready to tel me that it wouldn\u2019t be possible, but I had read the sign and was prepared! Success!!!! \ud83d\ude07",

On Hotel recommendation, I recommend Conrad Tokyo, since they have room that overlook the Tokyo Bay, as well as right next to Shimbashi, so it might fit your last day's schedule slightly easier (that's where I will be staying for my 40th in November).  The only things I would change on the travel schedule is the last day: Odaiba and Shibuya/Roppongi are kinda opposite each other, and it takes a while to get there (at least 30 minutes).  You might wanna do this change: group your Tsukiji and Odaiba trip together (do it before going to Kyoto), because you always wanna leave some time incase things go sideway on your last day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I don't now if you can still change your hotel plan, it MIGHT be viable to group your Kyoto and Osaka stay together, and pick ONE of the two city as your base of operation (They're about an hour apart on local train, so its not THAT bad, and you don't have to worry about sending luggage twice, but that's just me), and just move between Kyoto or Osaka via local train or short Shinkansen train ride.  Also, that way you can make a day trip into Nara on the side if you want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of luggage forwarding (which is an absolute GODSEND), remember this key: while most of the big hotels (hotel you stay at should have luggage forwarding service, double check just in case), have this service, it does take 2 -3 days to get to your next destination.  what you want to do is check with the hotel on your check in day (or before), and ask how long does it take for luggage to move from point A to B.  And I would recommend the following 3 things:\n\n1)Have a smaller carry on bag/suitcase that you can easily move around in, so when your big luggage is forwarding to next destination, you have a small case to hold your clothes and whatnot (especially for your Hakone and Hiroshima trip)\n\n2) Since luggage forwarding does take 2 days to move from point A to B, you might wanna do this luggage forwarding schedule: Tokyo -&gt;Kyoto -&gt;Osaka -&gt; Departing Airport. (hence my 1st point).  Also, if your luggage is too big, you can't bring in on the Shinkansen (even if you can bring it on, you might have to pay extra for it, and its more expensive then forwarding).\n\n3) don't try to carry your big luggage around the train stations, most of them don't have elevators and the amount of stairs you have to carry the luggage around is pretty insane (did that when I was at Shimbashi station back in 2019...never again).\n\nOtherwise, enjoy the trip, and have fun.",

A lot of the main attractions get mobbed with people by 9 am so you want to go early but obviously you need multiple days if you want to go early to more than one attraction.",

Just have a smaller overnight carry on or backpack you can use for a night or two while luggage is shipped. At nice hotels you can just tell them you need your luggage shipped and they will fill everything out for you and charge it to the room.\n\nOn miyajima I recommend checking out Daishoin if you have time. Anyone that says it isn\u2019t worth it to stay on the island hasn\u2019t done it. Walking around at night with just about nobody out is absolutely amazing. If you do a day trip you are packed with thousands of people and probably don\u2019t get to experience the torii at both high and low tides.",

If you are getting a JR pass, I would consider just staying in Osaka and day tripping Miyajima and Hiroshima via bullet train. This will minimize the amount of times you switch hotels and move your luggage between them.\n\nLuggage forwarding is pretty easy. I recommend asking your front desk how early you need to send it based on the destination and time you need it. The costs can add up though, so minimizing the number of hotels you check into will help reduce that cost. Your front desk staff should be able to fill out the paperwork for you.",

It might be better to save them for the next trip.  \n\nAlso might be better to lump Osaka and Kyoto together since they are less than 1 hour away from each other, so you have flexibility to adjust your itinerary on the fly (i.e. Kyoto temple run in the morning and then dinner in Osaka). \n\nI suggest you choose either Osaka or Kyoto as base so it\u2019s easier logistically as well. \n\nAlso Kanazawa and Takayama are really beautiful and definitely worth going but probably hard to squeeze into your current itinerary. \n\nI\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be the last time you will visit Japan, so don\u2019t feel pressured to squeeze everything into 1 trip. Constant travelling between cities will drain most of holiday energy.",

Just got back from my own 30th trip (still a bit jet lagged so sorry if this doesn\u2019t make total sense), here are some considerations :) \n\n- get a SIM card booked for when you land in Tokyo if not already, way easier than pocket WiFi. Then use google maps for everything train related - it will say what line and platform you need. Also, get a Suica card loaded on your phone wallet - you can use it to just tap on and off the metro and buses in all cities you\u2019re going to. \n\n- I only did Hakone as an afternoon from Kawaguchiko (had a car) - honestly found it underwhelming and a bit touristy. It has just one view of Fuji - https://imgur.com/a/M1EVaiW\n\nKawaguchiko has all of the views of fuji you could want if you get good visibility. We stayed in Mizno hotel and this was our view from the room - https://imgur.com/a/Z4q141V | https://imgur.com/a/sBGj3Xu\n\n- You can definitely take luggage on the Shinkansen (bullet trains), but you need to reserve a luggage seat. \n\n- Book as much as possible in advance - any restaurants, experiences etc all sell out fast. Universal requires a timed entry ticket add on if you want to do Nintendo land (and you should). Roppongi was sold out. Skytree felt like a waste of time - queue for ages to go up, walk around briefly, queue for ages to go down. \n\n- Klook is a decent app for booking experiences\n\n- Have you looked into watching a sumo training session in Tokyo? Was awesome! https://imgur.com/a/mEJ4lfh\n\n- For Kyoto, I can\u2019t recommend getting to both Fushimi Inari and Arashiyama early - 5/6am for Fushimi and maybe 6/7am for Arashiyama. Maybe I just hate people being around / in my photos! \n\n- In Kyoto, you will likely spot Geisha around 5.45pm on Hanamikoji street - https://imgur.com/a/GPSmNWc\n\n- Kiyomizudera is a beautiful sunset spot, but also consider walking around the surrounding area in the morning for a more peaceful experience. We did this after sunrise at Fushimi Inari, so 7/8am and it was stunning, a lot of couples having their wedding shoots!\n\n- Don\u2019t group up Kyoto and Osaka imo, they\u2019re both different and have so much to do in each.\n\n- We didn\u2019t do Hiroshima or Miyajima, but we did spend 3 days around Fuji, 2 nights in Fukushima-Juku which is in the Nakasendo valley and has loads of [traditional towns / bath houses](https://imgur.com/a/f7CKcLI), and Mt Koya, where we stayed at a [Buddhist lodging](https://imgur.com/a/GXkC2qg)\n\nWherever you go and whatever you do, the country and people are so beautiful, you\u2019ll have a blast!\n\nAlso do you speak any Japanese? A little can go a long way!",

We\u2019ll do Nagoya-Kanazawa-Tokyo.\n\nWe started booking hotels six weeks ago, in Nagoya and Tokyo, and we booked a Ryokan in Kanazawa for one night. \n\nThese were not Golden Week dates yet we still were running into issues of limited room options. So, if you haven\u2019t booked rooms yet you really need to get started. And if there are museums, etc., that you\u2019re hoping to get into, try now to see if you can buy tickets online, prior to departure.\n\nWe spent the decade of the 90s living there, and my wife is Japanese, so we\u2019ve been fortunate to have her doing the planning. However some of the most useful info we\u2019ve gotten have been from English speaking foreigners living in Japan who have published some YouTube videos about traveling in Japan, in the Covid era. One of the big changes is not being able to bring full sized suitcases onboard the Shinkansen. So, definitely brush up on those requirements, and take advantage of the luggage shipping services.\n\nBest of luck with your trip. My first trip to Japan was in the mid-80s, before we moved there, and that trip\u2019s memories are still as fresh in mind as they were almost 40 years ago!",

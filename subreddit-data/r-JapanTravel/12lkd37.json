    "postText": "So im going to japan for vecation to tokyo and the regular places with family, but have an extra week alone in japan. I want to photograph old japanese rural villages as becouse im making a game inspired by run down abandoned japanese architecture. \n\nWe will arrive in tokyo for the first 5 days the travel to sendai where they will leave in sendai airport, so any sendai locations first if you could. Realisticly i will only have time to go to like 4 to 5 places as trecking to locations like this will take the whole day so the more unique the better.\n\nI want to go specifically to:\n\n\\-Overgrown abadoned/mostly abandoned villages that are old architecture 30s-80s.\n\n\\-Any big temples that have been abandoned (similar to Yamadera Temple which im planning to go with family).\n\n\\-~~Any rural areas with many intresting supersticions.~~\n\nQuestions:\n\nWill i need someone to accompany me for safety?\n\nWhat emergency/comunication radio should i bring?\n\nAny dangerous wild animals to look after?",

            "comment": "1. Let's start with wild animals - if we are talking about outer edges of Kanto and Tohoku - Japanese black bears and wild boars may be of concern. The farther into Tohoku boondocks or mountains you go (Hachimantai, Tsugaru) - the higher likelihood of meeting them. Wild monkeys are also a possibility.\n\n2. It should be noted that abandoned property is still private or corporate property and entering premises can result in trespassing charges. For that reason - I would heavily discourage looking for photo opportunities on Sanriku Coast or in the former exclusion zone, unless you are being accompanied by a local guide. Sites like abandoned mines (Osarizawa, Matsuo, Taro) are better with regard to not having someone calling police on you. For temples, Kanjizaio-in Ato in Hiraizumi is a good spot (and Hiraizumi as a whole is a gorgeous little town) and there are temples in the area. I would encourage you to just look at the map around areas you will be visiting, because you will find a lot of spots near depopulated villages.\n\n3. The emergency communication: you will be not rescued from an abandoned town, period. Same as for closed hiking routes - the official policy is not to conduct rescue operations if you should have known better.",

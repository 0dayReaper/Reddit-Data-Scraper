But you won\u2019t be able to get cash. \n\nI would call your bank and see if they can express you a new card if you\u2019ll be here for a while. \n\nYou should also contact the police box near where you were to report your wallet missing. If you\u2019re lucky, someone has found it and returned it.",

Thankfully, I was able to Wi-Fi text my family to buy an international data plan from our carrier for my phone for me, from where I called my card company and explained.\n\nFeel like there must\u2019ve been an easier way though, like do the Wi-Fi rental places have phones with data you can borrow to make calls?",

I\u2019ve lost my wallet and AirPods and gotten them back on multiple occasions. \n\nIn the meantime, the suggestion of a digital suica or pasmo card on Apple Pay is your best bet. If you want to pay with suica, use this phrase: \n\n\u201cIC (pronounced like I-she) kaado de onegai shimasu\u201d - it means IC card please\n\n\u201cIC (again, pronounced like I-shee) kaado de iidesu ka\u201d - can I pay with IC card?

Sometimes there are many clustered within a dense area like shibuya or shinjuku. So, if you can, check with each of them. The police may offer to call them for you, but if not, just check the other nearest.",

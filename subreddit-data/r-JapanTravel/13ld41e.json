    "postText": "Hi y'all, after perusing a lot of the posts in here, I understand one of the most common advice I've seen is to not pack too much into the days. I've tried to come up with a reasonable 4.5 day itinerary for me and my parents (in their 50s). I'll be buying the JR Pass since that seems to be the best value for this itinerary. Please let me know your thoughts! Also, I haven't booked any hotels yet so please feel free to recommend any hotels (nothing fancy necessary) that may be good proximity to my points of interest. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuly 11\n\n* Los Angeles to Haneda - land 2PM\n* Check into Tokyo hotel\n* Dinner and relax from jetlag\n\nJuly 12\n\n* Check out of Tokyo hotel and take Shinkansen to Osaka\n* Check into Osaka hotel\n* Osaka Castle\n* Kuromon Ichiba Market\n* Zauo Fishing Restaurant - novelty I know but I think my parents will enjoy it\n* Dotombori Shopping\n\nJuly 13\n\n* Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens with Cable Car Ride\n* Chinatown (Nankinmachi) (if there's time)\n* Kobe Harborland\n* Looking for kobe beef lunch and dinner recommendations!

I think we were there in the park for four hours? \nAlso on July 14 - it will take you at least two and a half hours to get from Osaka to Tokyo (not including time for you to get from the hotel to the station and vice versa.)\n\nI would also recommend you get a Suica or pasmo card, you have a lot on and the JR doesn\u2019t always service as well locally.",

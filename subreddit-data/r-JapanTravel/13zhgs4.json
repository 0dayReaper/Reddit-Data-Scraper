            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI've actually rented a car twice in Koriyama.  My Japanese is not terribly good, but it's not been a huge issue.  It has always taken longer than I expect, like 20-30 minutes to pick up the car.\n\nIf you want to go to Niigata be aware all expressways will be out of pocket because Niigata is not in the TEP coverage area.  (Neither is Nagano.)  \n\nSee here:\n\n[https://en.driveplaza.com/drawari/tohoku\\_expass/](https://en.driveplaza.com/drawari/tohoku_expass/)\n\nYou are going to incur relatively large drop-off fees if you rent a car in Koriyama (Fukushima-ken) and drop it off in Nagano (Nagano-ken.)  Generally you need to return a car in at least the same prefecture you rented in.\n\nSo financially, it makes more sense to go to Sendai since you end in Koriyama and you can get a TEP Pass to take expressways.  I don't know what parking is like at any of the places you want to go.  We've always gone by train to Matsushima.  I would just run some times through google map and make sure you look at the parking situation everywhere.  I've always stayed overnight in Sendai proper, because again no car.\n\nI think even in good weather your Hakone day is too full.  I think trying to see everything on your list and make it back to Tokyo for Dinner is going to be a challenge.  I have actually been to Hakone in the rain, and while I didn't see all the sights that trip, I still sort of enjoyed it.  \n\nFor ryokan, some allow 3 person occupancy, it depends on the room and the ryokan.  \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "At last a quite \"original\" itinerary...\n\nAnyway, yes, there are quite a few things to see in and around Fukushima/Miyagi prefectures, and a car is clearly worth it.\n\nBoth of your plans are interesting, but both require quite some driving. Also, if you are going to Sendai, you could drop the car in Sendai rather than drive all the way back to Koriyama (bare the dropoff cost). If in Aizu, the \"white tiger corp\" (I am guessing Byakkotai) memorial should be a \"must see\", there is also a very original pagoda just nearby (Sazaedo). While you're there, you could drop by the former Takizawa Honjin, just a few meters away. It served as a base for the Aizu clan during the Boshin war, there are a few bullet impacts and sword slashes here and there still visible. The whole area is more \"authentic\" than the samurai houses, which are reproductions (but still interesting).\n\nIf you have a car, you could consider to drop by Ouchi Juku, a perfectly well restored stop dating Edo period. Roughly 20km South of Aizu, really worth it.\n\nI'll be blunt, you could clearly skip day 2, Hakone is \\*ok\\*, but way, way, way more \"tourist-trappish\" than the rest of your trip, and doing the whole return trip in a single day is doable, but very tiring. You could add one day in your Northern Japan trip and drive at a more leisurely pace, while stopping along the way to check out a couple spots (Zao, lake Inawashiro, or even Yamadera).",

I will also probably do Takizawa Honjin instead of the other samurai houses. \n\nAs for Hakone, we may skip it entirely or put it off until the end of the trip and delay our flight out of Tokyo a little bit. Jet-lag is gonna be a factor for sure.",

            "comment": "We stayed several nights in Aizu-Wakamatsu at Hotel New Palace and did nearly everything on your list.  The hotel was a great location and the morning buffet was good (they had agemanju every morning we were there).  We found the beds to be quite hard though.\n\nThe Suehiro Brewery tour is only in Japanese.  We knew we wouldn't understand much and were hoping to just sit in the back of a tour group picking up what we could and looking around.  Unfortunately we ended up being the only ones on the tour during our timeslot and the woman giving the tour ended up pretty dismayed since we clearly were not understanding much of what she was saying.  We ended up rushing through the tour and the tasting at the end was just a few really small sips of a few sake offerings, so overall I might recommend skipping it entirely unless you understand Japanese fluently.\n\nI highly recommend eating at [Kagota](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kagota/@37.4949522,139.9325344,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff554a14722df19:0x20e0f038d20322ee!8m2!3d37.4949522!4d139.9325344!16s%2Fg%2F1tfd6tqt?entry=ttu) izakaya in Aizu.  They have a menu consisting of almost only Aizu specialties and huge fridge full of Aizu only sake (including Suehiro).  The basashi and sansai tempura were especially delicious.  The owners are also super friendly and will do an omakase style sake offering.  I read it can get busy without a reservation but we just showed up 15 minutes after it opened and were the first ones in.\n\nWe had sauce kastudon at [Tontei](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tontei/@37.4880433,139.9456315,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff554bf29ae9ab9:0x2a8bb26547aed978!8m2!3d37.4880433!4d139.9456315!16s%2Fg%2F1tgc9bzq?entry=ttu) which was very good and also walking distance from Korakuen.  I also recommend not skipping out on Iimori hill and Sazaedo Temple if you like nature.  Very serene places (and somber in the case of Iimori Hill).\n\nWe did the Goshikinuma hike as well which was quite nice.  It took us about 2 hours at a very leisurely pace.  There is also a museum close by that had a pretty extensive Salvador Dali exhibit we enjoyed.  I would also echo the other comment saying Ouchi-juku is worth the detour.",

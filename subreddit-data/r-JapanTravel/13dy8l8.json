    "postText": "I (27F) got back from Japan 3 weeks ago and that post vacation blues are hitting me hard :(   \nThis was my first time going to Japan and I'm sad I hadn't gone sooner! I plan to hopefully go back next year but  in the fall.   \nI have a lot to say but I will try my best to summarize so none of you are too overwhelmed.  \nLets start off with \n\n**Tokyo airport**\\- The airport is huge! we went ahead and took a free bus from terminal 3 to terminal 1 and then took a bus to Tokyo sky tree and from there got to our hotel. The only problem I had was with the shipping of luggage it does take about a day or two to receive depending on the area you are staying at. I thought because my flight arrived so early this wouldn't be a problem and I would get it sooner but that wasn't the case which was fine since we didn't have issues with just dropping the luggage off at our hotel and going from there but just letting you guys know so you can pack accordingly if this is something you're interested in doing. \n\n**COVID TESTS, JAPAN WEBSITE**\\- Absolutely recommend you get on the Japan website before hand and get the QR codes! It made everything fast and smooth.   \nAs far as the COVID test honestly I was stressing about it a lot but the only people that looked at my test was the airline. For entry to Japan, I just uploaded the results to the Japan website and that was that. Nothing else asked or asked for. So don't even stress too much about it!   \nAlso I do not recommend Verifly that app is ridiculous dont use it ! \n\n**WIFI, SIM**\\- My husband and I opted out of the pocket Wi-Fi and SIM card. I just used my current phone plan and had no issues (T-Mobile) They really came through and I had no problems using google maps and everything else. Plus no additional expenses which was great! \n\n**JR PASS, SUICA**\\- We also opted out of the JR pass. The cost didn't make sense for us, plus not all lines are covered in the JR Pass so we decided against it and bought the shinkansen tickets on our own through the smartEX App. SmartEx was convenient easy to understand and Iphone friendly. I just added the passes on my wallet and that was that. We used Suica for the transportation in all three cities. I think we spent the most money on transportation! \n\n**Google maps-** Google maps is by far your best friend throughout the whole trip! Make sure to pay attention to the platforms!! There are two platforms for each line- obviously if you get on the wrong platform you will go the wrong way. If you pay attention to the platforms you will be fine. I've used public transportation in France and London so it was easy to understand I mastered Japans system in less than a day it definitely helps that they have one of the best public transportation systems in the world! So you got this!\n\n**Culture shock I experienced-** Japan is really clean the people are really respectful and considerate I think they respect you more when you attempt to speak the language and not just assume that everyone speaks English. Literally a handful of people speak English here, so don't be ignorant and assume everyone does but in all honestly we didn't really need much assistance other than ordering food. But it doesn't hurt to be friendly, So I strongly recommend you learn how to say good morning, thank you, excuse me ,please, your numbers. I learned it so you can too :D  THERE ARE SOOOO MANY PEOPLE!!!  People everywhere its crazyyyy! \n\n**Teamlab Borderless**\\- Absolutely enjoyed the experience! I recommend you reserve the early times as it does get very full throughout the day. Don't forget you will be barefoot so make sure your feet are presentable. You guys have to go to this place its hyped up for a reason! Don't miss out on it! \n\n**Tokyo Skytree**\\- It was really nice to go up top but its not necessary I say you guys go to Shibuya sky instead if you have to pick from one or the other.\n\n**Inoskashira Park-** I had a good time in the little river with the boat, we rented a swan boat ( although I dont think its made for taller people)  Its a bit uncomfortable - we rented it for an hour which cost us 1000 yen but honestly 30 min would've been just fine. \n\n**Shinkansen-** The shinkansen leaves right on time so don't be late! You have options for food at the station make sure you either get the self heat or already warm up your food before getting in the shinkansen because they cant warm up your food there. I only took a carry on with me in the shinkansen so I had no issues with my luggage. I did see a lot of people lugging huge luggage around and making their experience really uncomfortable in the Shinkansen to avoid this you can go ahead and ship your luggage to your next hotel or what I did since I knew I was going to go back to Tokyo  I just reserved my hotel in Tokyo for my whole duration of my trip and made Tokyo my home base per say and when I went back to Tokyo all my big luggage and stuff was there.\n\n**Universal Studios-**  I think this is a MUST  in Osaka! We went into the Nintendo world and it was amazing! I got our tickets through the Klook website and had no issues we were able to get on almost all the rides and we were there from open to close. So much fun we let our inner kid out and did it all ! Getting there was so easy because the line literally ends there ! \n\n**Osaka Castle**\\- Super cute but can get crowded depending on the time you get there we got to see some of the best sakura in the park around there it did start raining really really hard here so make sure to check the weather and go prepared!\n\n**KYOTO**\\- I have no idea why but Kyoto was a lot more expensive than the other two cities, if anyone knows  why please let me know. The transportation there was also a lot more spaced out or more like things were a lot further than I was used to in the other two cities. Maybe it was just me but this was my experience. I did have the best donut of my life here so I will give them that. If any of you want to try this delicious donut the place its called HITSUJI DOUGHNUT they sell out quick so make sure youre there before they open the line literally wrapped around before they opened!! Thats how good the doughnuts are!!! \n\n**Arashiyama Bamboo Grove**\\- Like every place I've mentioned if you want nice pictures get here early! we also went to the monkey area it was really nice and the view at the top was breathtaking \n\n**MT FUJI-** We reserved the one day trip to Mt Fuji through the Klook app as well. I checked the weather a ton of times to make sure it was a clear day and the day we got there there were clouds :( so we didn't see it the way I wanted us to. Maybe next time! But we had an amazing time anyways! Scenery in the little towns was amazing! \n\n**IKEBUKURO , SHIBUYA, AKIHABARA, SHINJUKU**\\- Ahh these places are dangerous if you're impulsive! The amount of shopping you want to do! Make sure if youre on a budget to not let yourself get too crazy I had my husband there to help control me and not go overboard I also made sure I knew what I allowed myself to spend that day and stuck with it because if I didnt do that I wouldve bought everything! \n\nFood in Tokyo- Ramen Tatsunoya, any food place in omoide Yokocho ( alot of locals eat here too so its delicious and cheap) , Happy Pancake, UOBEI Sushi (these were my must tries) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is all I have for now feel free to ask any questions :) I hope you found what I said a little helpful, If you're going I hope you have an amazing time in Japan!",

Plus what I did is drop it off to the hotel before check in went exploring and came back once check in time came. Hope this helps :D",

I saw many people with big luggage and they all looked miserable going up and down stairs with it. Honestly would do it this way again :)",

So I got them through klook and it tells you if there are no express passes available they will let you know it took about 2-3 hours to get the confirmation that I got them :)",

Just make sure the express train you get on has the correct stop you need, although most stop at Kyoto station. It\u2019s more about making sure you have minimal stops between Osaka and Kyoto so the trip is as short as possible :) overall I\u2019d say Shinkansen for that trip isn\u2019t worth it",

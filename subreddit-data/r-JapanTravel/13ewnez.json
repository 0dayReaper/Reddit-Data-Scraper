    "postText": "Hey Guys.\n\nI need your help. My wife had a disc prolapse in the past, but she was fine the last months. Yesterday after a 36 hr travel everything went down hill retty fast. In 5 days we wanted to travel Yakushima Island and hike the lands on our own. Now this seems impossible and i need recommendations for the best places which are easily accessible with a max of 3o min easy walking. We have a rented car and we will see the beaches, but i also need to see the ancient forests. So ive you have expierence on Yakushima island pls tell me your best forest spots. Only one i found was Yakusugi Land, which is fairly easy to reach.",

The only thing I can\u2019t remember clearly is if there was a fairly large rock to \u201cclimb\u201d over near the stream. \n\nAll in all it\u2019s hard to know whether you can say \u201ceasy to walk on\u201d. But the trail gets a lot harder deeper in after the bridge. \n\nIt\u2019s about a 20 minute drive up the mountain to a parking lot. I think you pay something like 500-1000 yen per person to enter the trail from here. \n\n\n\nP.S. also recommend the Ohko waterfall. Very accessible, drive up to the parking lot and walk on paved road to the waterfall.",

I\u2019ve only done the hike to see Jomonsugi, but a quick look online, it seems like it\u2019s as you thought, Yakusugi Land is probably the easiest thing for you guys. As a world heritage site, the island tries to preserve the condition of the land, so trails are often unpaved or the tree roots create an unstable trek.",

It will turn into a small road in the forest with lot of deer and monkey. Just be careful on the road, it is not a one way and you will have to park on wider parts of true road to let car coming from the other way pass.",

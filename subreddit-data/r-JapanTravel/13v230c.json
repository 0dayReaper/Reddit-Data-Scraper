    "postText": "Hello ! We're going to spend 2 weeks in Japan in the second half of August. We'll spend the first half in Tokyo / Kyoto but given that we also wanted to see some nature / escape from the super hot cities. This is my itinerary so far, but I'm not sure what it's worth, especially given that there's a lot of driving. \n\n*Monday August 28th*  \nArrival to Sapporo, relax in the city  \nMt Moiwa in the evening  \n*August 29th*  \nRent a car and go up the coast to Capui Kamui / Shimamui Coast and other potential things on the way in the area  \nThe coast looks really nice but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to drive there just for that. Either drive back to Sapporo or go sleep somewhere near Lake Toya.\n\n  \n*August 30th*  \nLeaving from Sapporo (or closer) , explore the Shikotsu-Toya area for the day  \nI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll have the time to do everything but I\u2019d like to see one of the two lakes (Toya or Shikotsu)  \nHike around Jigokudani (Hell Valey)  \nGo back to Sapporo. \n\n  \n*August 31st*  \nDrive to the Furano area  \nExplore Furano, Ningle Terrace, Tomita farm  \nBiei / Zerubu hill area  \nSleep in the area  \n*September 1st*  \nFinish exploring what we might not have been able to see the previous day  \nHike around Daisetsuzan park (not sure about this part because it looks like a long drive from Furano although it\u2019s not that far)  \nDrive back to Sapporo\n\n  \n*Saturday 2nd*  \nTake the train to Otaru and spend half a day there before leaving for the airport in the afternoon / evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have not reserved anything so if you have recommendations that are quite different from this plan, don't hesitate ! Open to anything.",

            "comment": "30th seems packed if you wana go hike Jigokudani too.  We went out to Jigokudani from Sapporo and it took most of our day.  We got back into Sapporo for dinner but there wasn't much time to do other things besides Noboribetsu.  I believe our bus ride was upwards of 2 hours.  Were you planning on taking busses to Shikotsu, then to Noboribetsu/Jigokudani?  Or are you renting a car?\n\nWe aren't even big hikers either but some of the trail was very steep and took a while to go through.  \n\nWe went to Noboribetsu.  We ate ramen there and had ice cream.  We enjoyed the River Oyunuma Natural Footbath on our hike too.  \n\nThings start winding down there pretty early, so I recommend catching really early transit out there.",

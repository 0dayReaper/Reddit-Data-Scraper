    "postText": "\nWe will be going on our first trip to Japan in a few months. We booked our hotels with Expedia (pay at location option). When booking with Expedia they wanted a card to hold the reservations so I used my debit card for that. \n\nWe will be paying in cash at check in so everyone can pay their part for the room. When we pay the total in cash will there still be a hold put on my debit card that I have to show when checking in? They like to do that here in the U.S. for \"accidentals\"\n\nUPDATE: I had reached out by the Expedia chat for both hotel locations. One in Kyoto advised that payment must be made in cash upon check in &amp; that I will not need to show my card. The other hotel in Tokyo they messaged me that since I picked the payment method as local I can pay in cash &amp; if so I won't need to bring my credit card at check in. They also advised that the card I used to make the reservation will not be charged.",

            "comment": "In regards to paying cash, keep in mind that some hotels, particularly newer chains, now only take card. At least three of the hotels I\u2019ve booked for an upcoming trip say on their Japanese website that they only take card. The description on hotel booking website didn\u2019t always mention this. It seems to mostly be new business hotels and hotels aimed at young travellers.",

            "comment": "My experience in Japan is you pay when you check out.\n\nAlso, just in general, USA or abroad, you should give them a credit card number for incidentals, rather than a debit card.\n\nCredit cards are always safer, but more so with this, it\u2019s easier to put a hold on a credit card. Otherwise they might withdraw x amount of the money on your checking account, and then refund it later of course. Just easier with a CC imo.",

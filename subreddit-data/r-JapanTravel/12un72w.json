    "postText": "For the first time in my life, I will visit Japan end of April for 3 weeks. I was supposed to go for the Olympics but COVID happened. I adapted my initial plan, lurking here helped a lot.\n\nI don't like changing accomodations so prefer to have a base in a region and move around (14 days Green Japan Rail Pass taken on the official website already so I can book trains online. I will maximize the hell out of it). So here is my itinerary :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* **KANAZAWA** \\*\\*\n\nI should arrive at Haneda April 26 in the afternoon and take the Shinkansen to Kanazawa.\n\n**April 27**: Kanazawa focus:  Kenrokuen, Higashi Chaya,  21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Myoryuji (depending on available time and how much I slept lol)\n\n**April 28**:  Shirakawago (maybe Takayama, thinking about the logistics still)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* **KANSAI** \\*\\*  (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, etc.)\n\n**Saturday, April 29**\n\n*Morning*: Hotel base in Osaka - visit Tennoji Park\n\n*Afternoon*: Namba / Osaka Aquarium / Dotonbori (at night if up for it)\n\n**Sunday, April 30**\n\n*Morning*: Osaka Castle &amp; Garden\n\n*Afternoon*: Kobe (going early afternoon and coming back in the evening)\n\n**Monday, May 1st (Kyoto)**\n\n*Morning*: Ginkaku-ji / Philosopher's Path / Nanzen-ji =&gt; Keage Incline =&gt; Heian-jing\u016b\n\n*Afternoon*: Higashiyama: Kiyomizu-dera, Sanneizaka, Gion &amp; Pontocho\n\n**Tuesday, May 2  (Kyoto)**\n\n*Morning*: Nij\u014d-j\u014d / Manga Museum\n\n*Afternoon*: Fushimi Inari-taisha\n\n**Wednesday, May 3**\n\nFull day: Arashiyama\n\n**Thursday, May 4**\n\n*Morning*: Uji\n\n*Afternoon*: Nara\n\n**Friday, May 5**\n\nHiroshima / Miyajima\n\n**Saturday, May 6**\n\n*Morning*: Kyoto: Kinkaku-ji / Ryoan-ji / Kyoto Botanical Gardens\n\n*Afternoon*: Osaka: Shinsaibashi / Nipponbashi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* **TOKYO** \\*\\*\n\n**Sunday, May 7**\n\n*Morning*: Arrive at hotel &amp; visit Harajuku\n\n*Afternoon*:  Shibuya / Shimokitazawa / Shibuya Sky (booking made for 1 hour before estimate sunset)\n\n**Monday, May 8**\n\nDisney Sea\n\n**Tuesday, May 9**\n\nHakone\n\n**Wednesday, May 10**\n\n*Morning*: Asakusa-jinja / Senso-ji / Nakamise Shopping Street\n\n*Afternoon*: Ueno: Park, zoo, the museums, etc.\n\n**Thursday, May 11**\n\n*Morning*: Ghibli Museum (booking made) / Inokashira Park\n\n*Afternoon*: Teamlab Planets (late afternoon)\n\n**Friday, May 12**\n\nKamakura: Great Buddha, Iwaya caves, etc.\n\n**Saturday, May 13**\n\n*Morning*: Ikebukuro (Pokemon Center, Sunshine City...)\n\n*Afternoon*: Shinjuku: Shinjuku Gyoen Park, Koenji, Kabukicho in the evening / Nakano Broadway\n\n**Saturday, May 14**\n\n*Morning*: Ginza:  Hamarikyu Garden, Ginza Art Aquarium Museum, some shopping\n\n*Afternoon*: Akihabara (hardcore manga/anime shopping)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll hotels have been booked 5 months ago (Kanazawa, Osaka &amp; Tokyo).\n\nI tried to include the must for my interest and the must see in Japan, been a long time coming for the Japan/anime/manga fan for 20+ years that I am (I'm not that old though, early 30s). I did my best to go to well known places on weekdays except maybe Shibuya Sky.\n\nWhat do you think of this plan ? Suggestions ?\n\nBTW I'm not an early bird. Is it a big issue ? (saw people saying to go to some places around 7:00am to avoid the crowd, not happening with me \\^\\^)\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI just want to note, it takes about 30 minutes from either Shin-Osaka Station or Osaka Station to Kyoto Station, and from there you still need to actually get to most sightseeing in Kyoto.  \n\nI have seen people use the 15-20 minute estimate of taking the shinkansen from Shin-Osaka Station to Kyoto Station, but they don't seem to realize that train is only usually 2x an hour and timing for it to make that transfer from another line is going to take some time, again it is easiest if staying in Shin-Osaka, but then you have to stay in Shin-Osaka. I think on May 1st it's going to take you a good hour or more to get to Ginkakuji from Osaka.\n\nUnless you get up in the morning, you're not going to get to Osaka in the morning from Kanazawa.  It's a 3 hour train trip between them.  You could leave the night before, but that is a very exhausting day if you plan to go to Shirakawa Go or Takayama.  For Takayama via JR, there are 8 roundtrips a day between Toyama and Takayama.  (Getting between Toyama and Kanazawa is much easier)  There are 4 Hida that run Toyama to Nagoya and 4 that fun Nagoya to Toyama.  Some of the locals involve long layovers and get in at similar times to the Hidas.  If you go that route make sure you know every one of the train times ahead of time, particularly when getting back.\n\nI think Uji and Nara on the same day is going to be hard.  You're going during Golden Week and unless the wisteria comes early and goes early, Byoudoin is a famous wisteria garden which is going to increase crowds.  It's also just going to take you a while to get there because Uji is much closer to Kyoto than Osaka.\n\nIf you don't get up early, I think May 5th is going to be very hard.\n\nIf you want to go to Disney Sea, I would move it a few days to get rid of the last GW stragglers and do it on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nGood luck!",

I've checked the time while taking the non-stop Shinkansen and from my hotel, I'm still around 30mn for Osaka-Kyoto (16mn from hotel to Shin-Osaka and 13/14mn for Shin-Osaka to Kyoto).\n\nI also take into account the time to get to my points of interest in Kyoto and changed some days program accordingly (like it takes around 40mn from Kyoto Station to Ginkaku-ji).\n\nI'll stay flexible anyway, won't do what my body can't, relax and fun first!\n\nGood idea for  Disney Sea, I'll swap it with Hakone",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nFirst, I want to say thank you to everyone who has posted and responded to the hundreds (thousands?) of itinerary checks that already exist in this forum. I have been reviewing them for weeks trying to glean as much info as I can, but ultimately, I am still feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed. So here I am, humbly asking for my own itinerary check and whatever kindness &amp; wisdom you wonderful internet strangers can offer today.\n\nQuick info: My partner and I are mid-30s, and this will be our time visiting Japan. We are hoping to split our time fairly evenly between big cities and quieter towns. We do not like to over plan our days, so although we\u2019ll definitely make a few reservations for must-do activities, we\u2019re mostly looking for support in the structure and timing of our route. That being said, of course I would appreciate feedback/suggestions on the few daily details we do have planned.\n\nHere is what we have so far:\n\nWed 5/31 - Arrive NRT\n\nThurs 6/1 - Tokyo\n\n* Visit fish market since we\u2019ll be jet lagged &amp; up early\n\nFri 6/2 - Tokyo\n\nSat 6/3 - Tokyo\n\n* Sumo? My understanding is there are no official tournaments in June, but it looks like there is a retirement ceremony that includes matches this day and the next (6/4).\n* Is [this website](https://www.buysumotickets.com/shop/special-events/2023-06-03-Tokyo) legit? If not, would love help on how to buy tickets.\n\nSun 6/4 - Tokyo to Takayama (\\~4 hrs by train)\n\nMon 6/5 - Takayama\n\nTues 6/6 - Takayama to Kamikochi (\\~1.5h by bus w/ transfer in Hirayu Onsen)\n\n* Myojin Ike Pond Loop\n\nWed 6/7 - Kamikochi\n\n* Mt. Yakedake\n* I\u2019ve read the conditions can be unpredictable this time of year (best case it\u2019s sunny and gorgeous, worst case there\u2019s a lot of residual snow/ice), but we are both experienced winter hikers, so I think we\u2019ll be ok but always welcome a hubris check.\n\nThurs 6/8 - Kamikochi to Magome OR Kamikochi to \u2026?\n\n* **This is where we could really use help!** We plan to hike Magome to Tsumago (forward luggage in Magome and stay in Tsumago), but I can\u2019t figure out what the Kamikochi-Magome route would look like in terms of timing. I think we\u2019d go Kamikochi &gt; Matsumoto (90m) &gt; Nakatsugawa (75m) &gt; Magome (25m)? But I\u2019ve read that connections can be tricky &amp; long, so my concern is that it would end up taking so long to get to Magome that we wouldn\u2019t have time to hike the same day. Also we don\u2019t want to be rushed and therefore stressed about getting there. So would it be better to make a stop somewhere else, like Matsumoto or Kanazawa (or somewhere else you recommend) for a night and then leave for Magome in the morning on 6/9? \n\nFrom here the remainder of the itinerary depends on what we decide to do on 6/8. After Tsumago, our plan is to go to Kyoto for a few days, then spend our last night (Wed 6/14) in Hakone, then depart NRT the night of Thurs 6/15.\n\n**One last thing:**\n\nI saw that there are several places to bungy throughout the country and would LOVE to do this. I\u2019m a big bungy fan and have had the thrill of doing it on 4 different continents so far and would love love love to add Asia to the list! Jumping in Gifu would be amazing since it is so high and I\u2019d get to try a squirrel suit, but I don\u2019t know if it would be possible to work that into the itinerary in a way that doesn\u2019t take us on too much of a detour. Thoughts?\n\nAgain, thank you very much for your time and insight you can offer.",

Unfortunately, [the official website](https://t.pia.jp/pia/event/event.do?eventBundleCd=b2341805) for buying tickets is only available in Japanese. Additionally, I wanted to clarify that the special ceremony will take place only on 6/4, not 6/3. Source: [the official website](https://www.sumo.or.jp/IrohaKyokaiInformation/detail?id=584).",

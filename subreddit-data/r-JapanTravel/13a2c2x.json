    "postText": "As the title suggests, I (24F) have come to realize just how much walking there is in Tokyo. As a woman who is over 5months pregnant, I knew this trip would be hard, but I didn\u2019t realize just how hard. I thought maybe a couple km per day would be enough, but was sorely mistaken. Originally husband and I had planned to do around 3-4 different activities or places each day of our trip but we\u2019ve had to limit to 2 most days, 3 on a good one. This normally equates to us being out walking around for around 6+ hours each day and then sometimes going out again for a couple hours at night to explore.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t realize when coming here was that I would finally start really feeling pregnant. I\u2019m talking the shortness of breath, extreme swelling in calves and feet, and just tiredness all the time. Before going on this trip I thought I was decently active but now looking back I was basically sedentary in my lifestyle compared to this. I thought we could mostly rely on trains to get us here and there, but even then some places we wanted to visit are a km or so from the train and I forgot to factor in how much we would be walking at those places. \n\nThe worst part of it all isn\u2019t even the walking though. I enjoy walking and exploring, but my pregnancy feet and cankles do not care much for it. Each day I come back to my feet swollen so big and in so much pain from my walking shoes restricting them. Sometimes the swelling barely goes down by the next morning and I have to fight to get them on and walk around in pain all day. Before this trip I didn\u2019t really notice the swelling because I guess I spent more time with my feet up, but it\u2019s been so frustrating that it manifested full-force all of a sudden. I was really looking forward to this trip but it\u2019s just been really hard and I feel like all I do is hold my husband back. Today I\u2019m going to go out and try to find a more breathable and loose pair of walking shoes at some point, but if anyone has any suggestions, they\u2019re much appreciated. Sorry for the rant, just feeling upset that I can\u2019t enjoy this trip to the fullest even though it was supposed to be a late honeymoon for us before the baby arrives.\n\n\nUpdate: Tried looking for compression socks in a few different places and they were out of stock where I could find them. Also tried to get some better shoes but unfortunately my feet are too big and they don\u2019t carry my size anywhere oof. However, I tried keeping my legs raised at a 90 degree angle for a while and this helped. Also made sure to take more regular breaks and sent husband out to do his thing without me a few times today. Definitely feeling a lot better, but I think it also has a lot to do with my body just getting used to this level of activity finally. Thanks for all the advice everyone!! You all are amazing :)",

Do this trip knowing that you\u2019ll be returning to visit again. My wife and I were doing 35K steps a day and by the 9th day both of our feet were feeling it. We decided to go in for a 30 minute foot massage when we were in Kyoto. I\u2019ll tell you boy was that a hack because it did wonders! She knew what she was doing. After the massage we kept at pace all the way to the end of our trip. Foot massages is something that I haven\u2019t heard mention on this subreddit\u2026 that brings you back to life in Japan.",

Around month 6 or 7 my ankles started swelling up just like you\u2019re experiencing, it was the worst! Compression socks, gentle massages in the evenings, and soaking my feet helped. \n\nMy baby is almost 3 now and my feet are still bigger than they were pre-baby too, so maybe your shoes are getting too small as well. Definitely look for something a bit bigger if you can find it. \n\nJust take it slow and soak in the atmosphere, you might not get to see as much as you planned but you\u2019ll just have to go back later on. And congratulations on the little one!",

I typically workout a smidge less on adventures since I don't want to tire myself out mid day. Your mileage helps a lot. How the hey did you do 10 miles a day? I don't even know if my brooks sneakers would feel good after that much mileage. \n\nAs for the OP it's simply time to readjust the plan and not feel like dead weight. I have a 10 yo. He will not want to do 10 miles a day. Heck, I'm fit and I don't want to do that on repeat for 2 weeks bc I know I'll be burned out by the end. My guess is 2 activities max for my family, with lots of food in between to get us from one thing to the next. We are lucky and will have a pool and hot tub waiting for us at the hotel so I definitely plan on using that nightly to wind down and end the day on a fun, relaxing note rather than an exhausted one. But if we don't even have energy for 2 activities, cool. Or if we need a mid day nap to feel recharged later, cool. \n\nI went to burning man when I was 6 weeks pregnant. We were supposed to stay the entire time and the day before the man burned I just had had enough. I was tired. When I told my husband he was like sure, let's drive home now and that was that. We had a great experience but I didn't need to do it all to have it. Over a decade later I had no regret leaving that adventure early. It's simply what I needed to do at that time. I'm not saying you should leave, but if you need to change the big plan to something that suits your new life go with it.",

Then 15 min to lunch because you got to leave the museum area and look for a place.\n\nThen 20 min to activity 2 which is a park so you're basically walking for 30 minutes. Then 20 min to metro. Then 15 min to hotel. And then you still need to go out for dinner and evening...\n\n10 mile is a lot but exploring a city just means being on your feet tons!",

My feet were dead every night I was there (sore muscles the next day). I tried to stretch before going out if I could. \n\nHonestly though give yourself a break. It's hard to incubate a life. Above all you and your health trumps all other concerns about the vacation. Your spouse would be more concerned about your pushing too hard and far. I offer preggo hugs because it's not easy knowing how you'll feel each day. I'd also revise the itinerary-choose the things you want to see the most that day and try to find else something close distance wise. Knock two birds one stone if you can.\n\nI didn't see alot of massage places being advertised when I was there or maybe I missed them. Worth a try? Or maybe icing your feet?",

The sole is like 1 1/2 even 2 times thicker than your avg sneakers. That helped a lot and reduce wounds in my feet by only 2. After using that shoes for 2 weeks, my crocs sandal sole felt really hard lol (even though it should be one of the most comfiest sandal).\n\n*They also have the sandal version which is equalizer 6.0\n\nI agree it was too much walking, I usually only do like 2-3K steps a day, and suddenly I did 20-27K a day. Total I did 280K steps in 15 days.

At least my legs did not hurt, but my feet did. The first week was a bit harder but it got better, I guess I am getting used to it.\n\nBut yeah, standing all day long and walking 7k to 37k steps daily (my average is 17k) is MUCH more than what I do back home. Yes, there is days I could have walked less and use a bit more subway, but still, when you want to see many things, you just end up walking a lot.\n\nSorry, I do not have any specific tips, can just say I understand your feeling.",

They are available at most 7/11 and stores such as Don Quijote. \n\n- unfortunately I injured my ankle, a brace helped a bit with compression. I bought mine at a pharmacy\n\n- Take mid day breaks. Do something small together in the morning, have breakfast together and then go back to rest. It kinda feels weird, but that way my husband could explore on his own, I would rest and we would venture out together again late afternoon/ evening. \n\n- Breathable walking shoes: I highly recommend Asics Gel Lyte III. \n\nHope this helps and that you are able to enjoy the remainder of the trip.

It was a lot of walking and I felt it a bit in the first couple days but it got a lot better and by the end we were walking further every day. I don\u2019t know how badly a pregnancy would affect that kind of recovery process but hopefully it gets better. :)",

Some chains are ReRaKu, Temomi Meijin, and Koritorun.\n\nThey make compression leggings to help with sore legs and ankles: https://www.mediqtto.jp/line-up/for-sleep/legcare/for-sleep-1/\n\nYou should be able to find these in any drug store, like Tomod\u2019s, Tsuruha, Yamazaki Kiyoshi, Kokokara Fine, etc.\n\nI hope you have a great time with the rest of your trip!",

Look for footbaths to soak your sore muscles in hot water, get feet and legs massages. Adidas ultraboost are very cushioned and have been a literal lifesaver on all my travels, they really protect your feet and joints through the massive cushioning. If you can, take an ibuprofen to thin your blood and help the swelling.",

Uber works well too, more expensive than other countries but very convenient to book &amp; pay all within the app (no language barrier)",

I took a day off today thanks to the rain and it\u2019s been so good. I would suggest not beating yourself for not keeping with a non pregnant male and focus on keeping yourself comfortable. Take breaks throughout the day, keep your self hydrated and mentally let go of any ideas of what you should be doing and focus on what your body can handle. It\u2019s much more fun if you give yourself permission to slow down and do less things but enjoy them.",

I finally realized when I did a video call with my daughter and she said \u201cyou look really puffy\u201d (thanks, sweetie) that it was more likely increased sodium consumption causing it.  Japanese consume more sodium than many western cultures.  So lay off broths like ramen and udon, and also watch the pickled veggies.  That might help.  Eating high potassium foods like sweet potatoes can help your body process the sodium.  I  tried to moderate my sodium consumption and the puffy feeling abated.",

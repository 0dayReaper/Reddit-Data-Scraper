    "postText": "Hello everyone, I know that US Android phones are not FeliCa compatible so they can't be used as a virtual Suica but I'm curious if anyone has been able to do it with a Samsung Watch.\n\nSamsung informed me that the only difference between the international and US versions of the watch are the chargers and that the US watch should be FeliCa compatible. That being said, if I can't add the Suica to my watch directly and need to do it from the phone, I'm sure it wouldn't work so I wanted to ask, has anyone been able to do so successfully?\n\nI haven't purchased the watch yet which is why I can't just test it out myself.",

The only ones that are compatible are all JP versions of SOME fitbit, SOME Garmin, Sony Wearables and pixel watch i believe. \n\nBasically for the same reasons only Japanese versions of android phones can use suica. The devices need Felica chip in it and most companies don't bother including besides their JP versions.",

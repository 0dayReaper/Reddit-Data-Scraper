But please remember, you are an example of what \"foreign tourists\" are like and people will remember you.",

And even still, the phrasing she used described the local people referred to them as though SHE wasn't a foreign tourist in THEIR country.  And it's not like Japanese doesn't have the word for \"Americans\".\n\nAgain, if a Canadian or American went to France, looked at a bunch of French people and referred to the local people as \"foreigners\" rather than, I dunno, \"French people\", that person probably has some serious ethnocentric views of the world.",

But I see things like this literally everyday and on every bus and canada line train. That's no exaggeration. I live literally next to a canada line station so I take the canada line very frequently, literally everyday actually. It sickens me.\n\nI take the 100, 410 (richmond), 41st UBC, 418 (burnaby to richmond), plus the canada line everyday. \n\nI have taken the downtown buses regularly before and those were definitely not any better. Kind of worse actually. \n\nYesterday actually I saw something so disgusted I wanted to say something but I already had a fight happen over something like this, sick of it. I was on a crowded bus and this lady in front of me had her bag on a chair, and there was this girl who walked all the way to the back of the bus because she thought there was a free seat, but then realized another lady's bag was on it, so she just stood the whole time in front of that seat with the bag on it. The lady just looked at the girl and just didn't care. And then when the lady with the bag saw that there were two seats available near the middle of the bus, she took her bag and did the same fucking shit on those two seats. She sat on the aisle seat and left her bag on the window seat area. \n\nI see this stuff happen more than once. I would call it out, but I am diagnosed with high blood pressure problems, and am prone to starting arguments and yelling like it's nothing uncontrollably, so it's not worth it for me.\n\nIt's absolutely ridiculous on the canada line, like everyday I go in EXPECTING young men or women, or teens, sitting on the priority seats and every time i'm right. I always check just to see which douchebags are gonna be sitting on them. ",

To fear that the Japanese, in general, are going to judge all foreigners on the basis of a bad experience with a few of us, especially in a big city, is really not to have very much faith in their good sense is it? You have no responsibility for anyone but yourself. Just be aware and do the best you can. That's good enough. The Japanese don't expect you to be Japanese; they know that there are cultural differences. They also know that some people are just assholes. I'm sorry, but I'm personally far more tired of other busybody westerners trying to correct the perceived indiscretions of others. In fact, the only time most other westerners I've met have even talked to me at all is when they are trying to tell me the degree to which I'm not behaving according to the dictates of their, normally racist and/or simplistic, caricaturization of local culture. The rest of the time they're too busy trying to pretend to be Japanese. Just do you and trust others to do the same. Japanese people aren't simple-minded. They aren't judging all of us any more than you would (hopefully) judge all Japanese on the basis of a bad experience with some dickhead on the subway back home.",

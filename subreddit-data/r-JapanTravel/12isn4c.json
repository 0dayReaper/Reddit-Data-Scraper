The cheepo places like Kura and Sushiro have non sushi stuff like hamburger, fried chicken, ramen etc, but the sushi there is of a totally different lower quality, so I never force my partner to eat there. For 1 night I can sacrifice myself and eat cucumber and egg rolls so they can enjoy themselves",

Odaiba (giant Gundam and Gundam Base store).\n\nMany of your days are very sparse. If you grouped your activities more, you should be able to take a day trip to somewhere nearby like Hakone, Nikko or Kamakura. \n\nFor omakase, you guys may be out of luck. In my experience, omakase restaurants tend to be specialised and any non-seafood dishes will be very limited. You might be better off at an izakaya.",

            "comment": "Currently pregnant (4 months) and in Japan right now! I've had a really harsh first trimester ( I'm still on medication for nausea but this is our babymoon).So I think you're itinerary is good event wise but also be flexible.\n\nI had a direct 14 hour flight and was so exhausted by the time we checked in (early check in at 1pm). I didn't leave the hotel till the next day. I flew in Haneda and it took 2+ hrs to get through everything. I was cranky and stressed. Make sure you bring any meds pain/sick as your OB allows. Japan generally doesn't have accessible medications you'd normally find ( ex walgreens). \n\nI do want to mention once you leave your hotel- the only sitting you will do is on the train/bus (if you get a seat), eating( assumings theres seating) or pachinko. Hours of walking. There are little to zero areas to just sit and rest even at department stores. So far at the end of every day for me is flat out exhaustion (so be mindful of this since your working also). Even places to eat you may wait longer to wait for a spot as many places are very small ( side shops).\n\nI tried to get a tag/Keychain at a train station that said I'm pregnant, they asked for proof but I couldn't access my medical records and I didnt have any pics on my phone. However on crowded trains all the priority seats were already taken regardless. \n\nAlot of anime stores have narrow and cramped aisles so sometimes I just waited while my spouse dived in (shrines/castles generally the same). Your energy levels will shift and fluctuate through the day. \n\nLeave extra waddle time. Not every platform has an escalator so basically every train stop we got off at we let the crowds thin out so I can take my time walking down stairs. \n\nAlso remember every day is different. Some days I felt amazing and others I thought I couldn't make it past getting lunch. Be kind to yourself. For food, we just try to look at menus that offer non seafood/sushi though cooked eel is safe and really good! I'm allergic to shellfish and while my OB said I can have some sushi (watch mercury levels) I'm still doing it sparingly. There's tons of good food everywhere so I'd try to compromise if possible. \n\nHope it helps :).",

                    "comment": "This honestly helps me feel so much better! I also had a really rough first trimester, and even the first few weeks of my second trimester were pretty rough. I\u2019m just now starting to feel better and I\u2019m a few days past the 18 week mark, so I\u2019ll be around 21 weeks when we go. \n\nI\u2019ve definitely heard that it\u2019s a lot of walking, so I tried to make sure we weren\u2019t overdoing it too much since I\u2019ve been taking it easy the last couple months. Our flight has a layover in Canada for a few hours but then it will be a straight shot to Haneda. I figured I probably won\u2019t be in the best mood after we arrive so the only plan that night was to just get ourselves checked in and settled - and maybe grab a meal close to the hotel. I\u2019ve been told customs and immigration take forever now, so not looking forward to that. I didn\u2019t realize there weren\u2019t a lot of places to sit when we\u2019re out and about. I\u2019ll have to make sure that we schedule regular meal times so that I\u2019m not overdoing it.\n\nThank you so much for the advice and perspective as another pregnant person! I feel like people who haven\u2019t been pregnant just don\u2019t understand the difference in energy levels. If you think of anything else, please feel free to reach out. I\u2019ll take all the guidance I can get!",

I'm happy to help!\n\nImmigration-there is no seats at all! One giant standing line. Customs was quick since we did the online registration. \n\nFor the Pok\u00e9mon Cafe -make sure you stay about an hour in (so you can see the head honcho come out!). The food is mediocre but the atmosphere is nice (2 entrees and two drinks was 70ish yen). Some Ltd edition dolls/ plates/cutlery. Overpriced but hey vacation!\n\nMy spouse and I loved Nakano Broadway but it's super hot/cramped. No seating inside the mall (we didn't visit the basement though). But super close to the train station. Many places only take cash here so keep that in mind (or have a cc upcharge fee). Even with the language barrier everyone is super nice! \n\nAnimate Ikebukuro wasn't a hit with us. I watch anime but love more the classics. If you're into more newer stuff you may like it more. Good to stop by but less than 30 mins for us.\n\nWe went to Mandarake in Nakano and Akihabara. In Nakano it's a bunch of different stores broken up all over the floors. In Akihabara its one big store. Both cramped and narrow but you can find treasures if you dig. No seating at all.\n\nI noticed some posts were caught off by scanning of passports. Hotels and duty free (over 55 yen) does this-its normal. My spouse made sure to double check room size as it seems many ppl overlook it. We wanted room to flop out (mostly me). We both brought an extra duffel bag for souvenirs (does the cargo I'm carrying need this plush? Prb not but i like it).\n\nEverywhere will be crowded but since your going golden week expect even more. Times squares level but more imo. Many things don't open till 10am or later ( stores/malls) and restaurants even later. So if jet lag keeps you up with nothing to do! \n\nTrain platforms have almost zero seating also while you wait. There are very little trash cans - some recycle for bottles only bc lots of vending machines. Bring snacks but prepare to keep the trash. Bathrooms at every station.\n\nI'll edit more if I think of anymore!",

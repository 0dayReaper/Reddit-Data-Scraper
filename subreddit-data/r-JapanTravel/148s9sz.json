    "postText": "Hi everyone, hopefully this will save you some tears!   \nSOLUTION: Try using the ATMs at LAWSON convenience stores to withdraw cash!   \nMy issue: ATMs at major airports and train stations WOULD NOT accept my Wells Fargo card. Neither would 7 eleven. I cried my heart out because my boyfriend unfortunately was paying for everything and we lost our booking to a Ryokan.   \nI called my bank several times in tears as they told me nothing was wrong with my card. And that maybe it was a chip malfunction or the ATM.   \nWe even traveled an hour out of the way to visit the Wells Fargo in Tokyo (DO NOT DO THIS). It was a waste of time. They can't help anyone with an overseas Wells Fargo issue! They can only assist Japanese customers.  \nWhat finally worked was withdrawing cash from a LAWSON ATM. I don't know why this worked.   \nI hope this helps someone!",

My fault for not confirming the restaurant did not accept cards, but that restaurant and one other were the only merchants we used that didn\u2019t accept cards or Suica. My preferred method of payment was Suica.  loaded my Suica card onto my phone and I was able to add more funds as needed using my Apple Card. I was surprised at how many places accept Suica as payment. It was very convenient and no exchange or transaction fees.",

Because she'd called Discover and the representative assured her it was accepted everywhere (even though it's not even accepted at half the stores in her small town) and she was worried about her other cards getting stolen (because it's not like fraud protection exists). She didn't even bring a debit card, because who needs cash? Nor did she exchange currency before the trip. She did not seek advice from anyone who had ever been to China, even though my brother's wife and in-laws she was meeting there are Chinese and would have been happy to answer her questions. She did not go on any forums or blogs about Chinese travel. She did not even contact her hotel and ask if they accepted Discover.\n\nWhat she *did* do was wait until she got to the hotel and found out they didn't accept Discover. Then she embarrassedly accepted my brother's FIL's offer to pay for everything. It was not the dumbest thing she's ever done, but it was close.",

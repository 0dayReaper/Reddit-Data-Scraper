Many cat cafes are awful, as well.\n\nAs for owl cafes - as you can imagine, keeping 20 nocturnal birds in a tiny room together all day, with their feet chained to a pole, for the amusement of tourists is not the most humane way to spend your vacation. Especially considering owls are not generally tolerant of human interaction in the first place.",

There\u2019s one in Akihabara and Shibuya and Shinjuku also but Ikebukuro is the big boi.\n\nAdditionally, K-BOOKS and lashingbang is really where it\u2019s at for resale goods to the point a ton moved out of Nakano Broadway into Ikebukuro instead. I never see new Japan travelers who are animes mention them but definitely don\u2019t miss out!",

For the most part the itinerary looks good from what I can tell, nothing too crazy. For conveyer belt sushi, I tried 2 places on my last trip and I can vouch for Kura Sushi. Very cheap and delicious. I still think about the tempura squid and seared salmon with cheese.",

If your in Shibuya and want sushi, this is my rec.\n\nAlso, don't forget to see the Hachiko statue in Shibuya!",

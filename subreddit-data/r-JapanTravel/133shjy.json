Would recommend to focus on just 2-3 places per day so that you'll get to enjoy the area. \nAlso, add a rest day period in the middle of your itinerary because it will really be tiring I promise!! By rest day I mean, a relaxed itinerary for 1 day (1-2 places max) so that you'll be able to recharge for the remaining half of your trip",

    "postText": "Hi all, I'm on a solo trip this July (I know summer weather is bad etc I've been to Japan more than a dozen times, live in a tropical climate etc so not looking for comments on humidity and rain) and will be making my way through Tohoku on a two week trip using the JR East Tohoku pass which I'll be buying twice.\n\nI booked Akita just for the dogs but just realized that Odate is is pretty far from Akita city itself, actually closer to Hirosaki and Aomori which I'd go to in the days after. Where do you recommend I see the doggos? Seems a shame to go to Akita and not see dogs.\n\nOr can anyone recommend places to go to around Akita city itself? I'm a casual traveler, not too fussed about missing sights because that gives me a reason to head back, and am interested in more laidback things like hanging out at a park or museum or cafe. It'll be my birthday week and I don't want to be too stressed out over traveling. I plan to come back in the future during spring as well to see the cherry blossoms.\n\nThis is part of my itinerary:\n\n**11th July**  \nSendai to Akita, reach 12.30pm  \nNo plans; chill day - originally wanted to see doggos until I realized how far they were. Open to still traveling (must see dogs) or can just sit at a cafe all day.\n\n**12th July**  \nKakunodate  \nLake Tazawa (maybe if not too taxing)\n\n**13th July**  \nResort Shirakami to Hirosaki 3.49pm arrival  \nNo plans; chill day\n\n**14th July**  \nInakadate Rice Paddy Art  \nHirosaki Park/Castle  \nTsugaru Neputa Village if time permits  \nHead to Aomori\n\n**15th July**  \nHachinohe\n\n**16th July**  \nFurukawa Fish Market  \nNebuta Museum  \nA-Factory  \nHead to Tokyo",

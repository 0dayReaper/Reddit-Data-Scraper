Akiba Cultures Zone is an outlier (11pm).\n\nThus said, since dinner offerings in Akihabara are mediocre, you generally tend to move out to Ochanomizu, Kanda, or wherever the better food is around 7-8pm.\n\nAlso note that Animate Ikebukuro is now the flagship store of the chain.\n\nAlso: Unless you have very specific interests, Tokyo National Museum gets quickly very tiring and in comparison with Mori Art Museum, TEIEN Art Museum, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Nezu Museum is just plainly boring.",

I\u2019m interested in artifacts and ancient history/archeology, like the Victoria and Albert Museum in England. I will look at those other museums though and see what kind of collections they have. Not interested in modern art",

    "postText": "**EDIT:** A huge thank you to everyone for responding! The feedback here is invaluable. I'm certain my trip will be better for it. I can't tell you how grateful I am. I am going to look at what is most important to us and prioritize. My wife got a great laugh from some of the comments here, especially the ones about me expecting her to do all of that while pregnant. \n\nMy wife and I are taking our honeymoon/babymoon and our first trip to Japan. We are excited!\n\nI understand that I could be overbooking days \u2014 please tell me! In case of this happening, we will just prioritize the most important places to us. Also, if there\u2019s something you think I should absolutely add, or I\u2019m leaving way too much free time, I\u2019d love to hear it too.\n\nWe\u2019re starting our trip in Kyoto because I wanted to save Tokyo for last. Funny, now that I\u2019ve planned everything I might have done it in reserve. Ah well, exciting all the same!\n\nA little about us: We aren\u2019t huge shoppers, love food and drinking (although my wife can\u2019t now \ud83d\ude1b), enjoy parks, historical places (temples, shrines, museums). When I was younger I was really into anime and all things Japanese culture.\n\n**Day 1 Tuesday, May 9th**\n\n* 5:00 am: Arrive at Haneda\n* Travel to Kyoto\n* Check-in to hotel (Higashiyama)\n* If we\u2019re not totally wiped (we\u2019ve been on trips where we didn\u2019t get much sleep and were able to hang just on the adrenaline, hoping for some more of that here)\n   * Kiyomizudera Temple\n   * Yasaka Shrine\n   * Maruyama Park\n   * End the night hanging around Gion, may check out Spring Valley Brewery and Pontocho Alley\n\n**Day 2 - West Kyoto**\n\n* Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\n* Sagano Scenic Railway\n* Tenryuji\n* Togetsukyo Bridge and stop for a snack\n* Monkey Park Iwatayama\n* If there\u2019s free time I\u2019m looking for something cool in West Kyoto! Open to suggestions.\n\n**Day 3 - Nara (Day Trip)**\n\n* Nara Park\n* Harushika Brewery\n* Todaiji\n* I haven\u2019t quite filled out this day, but we\u2019re planning to be in Nara for the majority of it. Open to suggestions\n\n**Day 4 - Kyoto**\n\n* Fushimi Inari (early)\n* Vermillion Cafe for breakfast\n* T\u014dfuku-ji Temple\n* Kyoto Station for lunch and shopping\n* Toji temple\n* Kyoto Brewing Co.\n* McDonalds (curious to see their food in Japan)\n* Nintendo HQ (I know you can\u2019t go in, but would be cool to see and we\u2019d be close by)\n* Walk around Higashiyama\n* Sanneizaka (Sannenzaka)\n* Nineizaka (Ninenzaka) \u2014 if it\u2019s still open checkout that cool looking Starbucks\n\n**Day 5 - Osaka (Day Trip)**\n\n* Osaka Castle\n* Osaka Castle Park\n* Namba Yasaka Shrine\n* Shinsekai\n* Dotonbori to end the night, dinner\n* (Would I be able to make it to the Cup Noodle Museum? It looks like it\u2019s 1 hour away by train)\n\n**Day 6 - North Kyoto**\n\n* Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion)\n* Kyoto Imperial Palace\n* Nijo Castle (Nijojo)\n* Nishiki Market\n* Kodaiji Temple\n* Muruyama Park (if I couldn\u2019t see it that first day)\n\n**Day 7 - Kyoto (last full day in Kyoto)**\n\n* This last day is for anything I couldn\u2019t do in previous days because I overbooked/planned\n* Philosopher\u2019s Path\n* Ginkakuji (Silver Pavilion)\n* Keage Incline\n\n**Day 8 - Kyoto \u2192 Tokyo**\n\n* Head for Tokyo after checkout, thinking we should arrive around 3-3:30\n* Check in to hotel (Shibuya)\n* Shibuya Sky: I\u2019m pretty close to it and I\u2019d like to see the sunset, don\u2019t mind the fee\n* Shibuya crossing\n* Ichiran Shibuya for dinner and planning to call it a night, or might walk around some more if we have the energy. We\u2019ve heard about it being overrated, but also there for the experience.\n\n**Day 9 - Shibuya**\n\n* Center-Gai\n* Yoyogi Park\n* Shibuya Parco\n* Nintendo Tokyo\n* Pokemon Center Shibuya\n* Miyashita Park\n* Shibuya Stream\n* Mandarake Shibuya\n\n**Day 10**\n\n* Disney Sea. I figure a Thursday should be good to go, although I do expect it to still be busy.\n* I\u2019m planning to try and make reservations for the restaurants soon!\n\n**Day 11 - Harajuku and Shinjuku**\n\n* Hachiko statue\n* Harajuku: I realize it\u2019s different for everyone, but can you spend a lot of time in Harajuku? From what I\u2019m reading/seeing on YouTube it\u2019s cool to see, but not what it once was.\n* Meiji Shrine\n* Gyoen National Garden\n* Kabukicho\n* Nakano Broadway\n* Golden Gai\n* Omoide Broadway\n\n**Day 12**\n\n* Asakusa\n* Akihabara\n* Pokemon Cafe - If I can get reservations for this day, else I will try for another date\n* Edo Tokyo Museum\n* Imperial Palace\n* Ueno Park\n* Tsukiji Outer Market\n* Senso-Ji Template\n\n**Day 13 - Yokohama (Day Trip)**\n\n* Cup Noodle Museum - I\u2019ll skip this one if I somehow made it to the CNM in Osaka\n* Sankeien Garden\n* Gundam Factory\n* Chinatown\n* If you have any other must sees I\u2019d love to hear them!\n\n**Day 14 (last full day in Tokyo)**\n\n* Anything we might not have been able to see, but really want to see/do will be left for this day\n* Starbucks Reserve Roastery (somewhat nearby to our place in Shibuya)\n\n**Day 15 - Departure day**\n\n* Our flight leaves at 6:25 pm, so we have plenty of time, but will most likely take it pretty easy this day and enjoy some good food, wander around and enjoy our last day without too much stress.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time. Cheers to you!\n\n**Some questions, comments:**\n\n* Do you think I should get a JR pass? From using some of the online JR pass calculators I do not need a JR pass. I should pay less overall if just pay for the shinkansen trips and trains straight up.\n* My wife is pregnant, are there any places on this list we should avoid?\n* Do you have any suggestions for a geisha dinner/entertainment while in Kyoto?\n* We are thinking about doing a Tokyo Swallows game, anyone have any thoughts about the experience?",

Then died when you said your wife is pregnant. \n\n\nI\u2019m going to assume she\u2019s in her first trimester maybe second. Hopefully not in her third trying to knock out this list. My recommendation is to cut it in half. Your itinerary is to look and check off the box rather then enjoy and appreciate. There is so much to see and explore at each place, your plan seems to show up take photos and move on. \n\nYour easily looking at 10-15 miles of walking a day for 14 days. 140-200 miles possibly , non stop. It\u2019s not easy on a pregnant lady who probably has to take a piss pretty often.\n\nIdk if this is your first trip or 100th but are you familiar with getting around Japan? If not add In time for getting around public transportation. It eats into your time.\n\nYou also don\u2019t have anytime for exploring,there\u2019s so many cool thing you\u2019ll see that you\u2019ll want to go see and do. Some of our best times have been doing things that we didn\u2019t have planned to do. I think you guys would get so much more out of your trip if you had time to be able to do that. One of our best day on our last trip was going to a park and having a picnic under the cherry blossoms. It wasn\u2019t on our itinerary but was great.  Another great day was spending a 2nd day trip to a small town near Tokyo because we enjoyed it so much. We went back to do more exploring, we bumped other things off our list to make space, but that\u2019s ok.\n\nI personally recommend to make a list of all the things that you want to do in priority. Knock them out at your pace and enjoy your trip. Understand that you will not do everything you want to do. Know new things will pop up that you will do. Save what you can\u2019t do for a future trip. I can tell you that in 17 days I was not able to knock out 1/2 of this list you have nor would I recommend or try it with a pregnant wife in tow. \n\nSource: just returned from a 17 day trip with my pregnant wife as well. We\u2019re a very experienced traveler\u2019s who have been to Japan multiple times.\n\nEdit: the only day that looks realistic to me was Disney Sea. Also the wife would like me to add that your wife should bring extra comfortable shoes. I bought her a pair of Nike zoom X\u2019s day 4 into our trip.",

We left so many things to do for next time. This was our 7th trip and I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve done everything on your list so don\u2019t stress it. My wife also entered her 2nd while we were in Japan. I\u2019m not going to give you any advice on travel that you can\u2019t find here but I will give you some advice I learned this time around traveling with a pregnant wife. \n\nShoes, find the most comfortable ones possible for her, ultraboost, reacts or zoom x. It\u2019s honestly not the walking that kills you it\u2019s the standing. Standing in line for everything , it kills you after a 10 mile day. It\u2019ll make a huge difference.\n\nTokyo sea vs Tokyo Disney, we found that Tokyo Disney had SIGNIFICANTLY less wait times then Sea did. Lines at Sea were 70-120 mins per ride. Disney was 5-25 mins for most rides with the exception of Bells castle that we bought a access pass for. Plus she got to ride most of the rides at Disney. \n\nAt train stations platforms learn to read the platform information [signs](https://www.google.com/search?q=train+platform+info+board+jr+train&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjeiImdoaz-AhUEN0QIHQddAbsQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=train+platform+info+board+jr+train&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEMgUIABCiBDoHCCMQsAIQJ1CtD1iVUWCkXWgDcAB4AIABkgKIAfIckgEGMy4xNi42mAEAoAEBwAEB&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=c8o6ZJ6DBITukPIPh7qF2As&amp;bih=740&amp;biw=430&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us#imgrc=W7yNvyK1qo9fOM) this was super important. Not because it tells you where to exit but because it shows you where the escalator and elevators are located. Your wife will thank you for making her life easier in avoiding stairs. You have no idea the amount of stairs in Japan. She\u2019ll thank you. \n\nSomething to think about when splitting your time between Kyoto and Tokyo, Kyoto is older. It\u2019s super beautiful and amazing but it lacks in its infrastructure compared to Tokyo. What that means for you and your wife is significantly more walking and standing. In Kyoto everything is so far from each other and then you have to walk like 1/2 mile to it or wait 20-30 minutes for a bus. Or it might be full and skip your station and now your waiting another 15 minutes for the next bus. I think they also have the deepest metro lines in Japan. That means your going to be dragging your wife into the mines of Moria every time you take the metro. So many damn stairs and significantly less escalators. In Tokyo your never far from a station entrance and we rarely took a bus anywhere. The days we spent in Kyoto were significantly more tiring then the days in Tokyo. We averaged 3-5 miles more a day in Kyoto then Tokyo. Just something to think about. \n\nAfter a close call we worked out a system for the bathroom. Something we didn\u2019t even think about but damn do pregnant wife\u2019s have to piss a lot. Know where the nearest bathroom is \ud83d\ude02.  We worked out that she would tell me when she was think about the bathroom rather when she started to need the bathroom, that way we had ample time to find a bathroom. \n\nExpected to eat the same food multiple times until she gets over it. \n\nGU or Uniqlo is a great place to pick up extra cloth if hers starts to feel a bit tight because of the pregnancy. And you can get tax free. \n\nI\u2019ll ask her if she can think of anything else and update this if she does.",

Are you only going for the deer or do you have other plans? \n\n-I think 5/5/2 is a decent split between kyoto/Tokyo/Hakone. You can adjust it based on what your list ends up being. \n\nFor Kyoto add in significant more time for traveling between places. The infrastructure is lacking compared to Tokyo. That\u2019s what always slows us down in Kyoto, but it\u2019s so beautiful. In Tokyo it always seems like your only a 5 min walk from a station, it makes getting around very easy. \n\nHakone is super beautiful in the fall and a great place to spend a couple days to get away. I highly recommend it, in the fall theirs also a lot less people. I personally prefer fall to visit then any other season. \n\nIf you can also take some time to look up the rail lines near where you plan to stay it can make getting around significantly easier and save you tons of time. Google maps is great for helping you get around but sometimes it gives you the stupidest routes. We stayed in Ikebukuro this time around and I know I can get to Shinjuku in 6 mins one stop but google would recommend the line that has 9 stops and takes 25 mins 1/2 the time. Stuff like that adds up when your visiting multiple places a day.",

I want to have a little easier. \n\nAside from rails/trains, are cabs, buses or uber type car service easy to get outside of Tokyo?",

The day-trips you listed are possible, but I might also consider spending the night in some places other than Kyoto instead of just being on the go all day.\n\nEven after your first few days, I would consider this pace too hectic to keep up for 14 days.

I'm rarely \"jet-lagged\" just tired.  Either way, I need more than 8 hours of sleep to make up for one or two travel days.\n\nAnyway, my comment is that the itinerary looks too hectic for me.  Obviously, OP can try it if that's what they prefer.  I don't disagree with your opinion either, but it's not how I prefer to travel.",

Otherwise, expect to wait as you will do many more times in the land of the rising sun. Oh by the way. Doing Bamboo and after that monkey park was a climb! Even we as frequent hikers were exhausted when reaching the top with all those small japanse stairs haha so please be prepared with the baby on its way ;) \n\nWe did 4days in Osaka (started our trip there for the chronological travel reason..) and did a bit more than you list for a day trip. Remember Osaka is a big city on its own with lots of side streets and explorable places.\n\nAlso others have said it but be careful walking that damn much with your wife ;)\n\nI didn't read Tokyo fully because of the packed schedule. But Yokohama is a good place to be at night (ferris wheel and light exhibition (if... It's still there then).\n\nOh last thing, fix a suica card for the whole trip (travelconvience, u can pay everywhere with this) or a metropass 72h for Tokyo. Stay off the JR pass and if you travel by Shinkansen, book in advance ;)",

Thankfully, we took that opportunity to eat at Ichiran since they closed at 6am (no wait times at least)\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it a lot already with the other commenters, but your itinerary really is a lot. I would just say to use this itinerary as more of a general idea of what you\u2019d like to aim to do that day and then adjust your schedule as you see fit and toss out ones that you\u2019re fine skipping out on. For our last full day in Japan, we were so exhausted that we scrapped our entire plan for the day and just ended up walking around and exploring. Which was perfectly fine and I don\u2019t regret it. \n\nBut yeah, our schedule was probably half as busy as yours and we averaged 25-30k steps a day. Also, speaking as a woman who was pregnant, it\u2019s probably going to be tough on your wife. A woman\u2019s body is already going through so much physical changes and adding a hectic schedule to that will certainly not be fun. Personally, I would\u2019ve ripped my husband\u2019s head off if he showed me this itinerary while knowing I would be pregnant during the trip lol",

I think there is a risk trying to do kiyomizudera and chasing breweries and all that is trying to push too hard. a stroll through yasaka + park may be more conservative.\n\n(that being said, it will depend on how long you travel, how much sleep you got. another thing, babymoon? you going alone or with kids? if you have kids or a baby with you, take any activity and assume it takes twice as long and drains double the energy)\n\nday 2: if you find free time just explore more arashiyama. I dont think you will though, that plan is ambitious already\n\nday 3: nara park and todaiji is, all things that you will find walking there, plenty for a day. and while the brewery is nice, it is a good bit away from the park. \n\nday 4: not sure this day can be done like that. it sounds so easy, just grab lunch at the station, 30mins, continue. but thats not what will be happening. what will happen is, you need to find a bus. and that will bring you to the station, and then 40 min are gone. now you look for food, that or that one, and then you wait, and finally food, another 40min gone, and then eat, 25min, ok what next, walk, okay and now, ok, wait for the bus, lets go to nintendo. which one, lets wait, an hour later you are back on your itinerary...\n\nday 5: that could be over ambitious. and are you sleeping in osaka? if not make sure you know when you need to head back. dont assume trains will run at night, they mostly dont. you will need to head back at a surprisingly early time\n\nday 6: you are all over the map with this one. not possible. and not north kyoto. nijojo and nishiki would be enough for one day.\n\nday 7: that day is light, but you know.\n\n\nill stop here because you are leaving my area of expertise. I would recommend you put all those POIs into a map and try to plan you days, especially 4,6,7, according to what is close to each other. maybe you can find some better fits, like, when you are at kinkakuji, next to it is ryoanji. I would much rather see that than trying to catch a bus to [anywhere way south]    \nanother thing, your plan sometimes tries to go to the same area twice. like, one day you wanna see the spring brewery, another day you want to go to nishiki. the brewery is, if you would shove it two houses over, right in nishiki.  \ntry to go to an area once, or rahter, try to spend as little time waiting for the bus or in the bus as possible\n\nthat being said, dont miss Kodaiji, but when your hotel is near Higashiyama, you can walk there. same with nishiki and pontocho and gion. stuff very close (walking distance) to the hotel can be more easily done/squeeze in.\n\nall in all, I dont think you put together a feasible plan. it is (and I can only judge Kansai) probably too full, and not optimized, and is ignoring time to rest, recharge, and running the risk of becoming a checkbox and not enjoyable.\n\nwhen you revised your plan ill gladly look at it again\n\nah at the end, pregnant. so no baby yet. but, japan requires lots of walking, dont underestimate that. and dont push too far.",

I just want to give you a planning tip to visualize your time and maybe see where you can \"cut the fat\".\n\nThe last time we went to Japan I was 3 months pregnant and we took our 18 month old with us. We were hitting 20k - 30k steps a day and it went just fine. I also had a relatively easy pregnancy, my biggest problem was retaining water.\n\nAnyway for your planning sit down with an hourly planner(or make a spreadsheet) and Google maps. Use the planner to add in travel time and plan out how much time to spend where. You can use the public transportation setting on Google maps to estimate leaving place A and arrive at place B. Maybe color code travel vs. site seeing vs. eating. \n\nBefore we had kids we traveled loose, fast, and hard. This is the way I do our trips now to make sure I'm adding in rest time and buffers for the kids needing a break and also planning for travel time when we're at the mercy of public transportation. It really helps to be asleep to visualize and think about how the day will really go and how much(or little) wiggle room you're giving yourselves to stop and breathe, pee, rest your feet, or investigate something cool you came across, but didn't plan for.",

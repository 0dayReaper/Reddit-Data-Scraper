    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nPlanning a Shimanami Kaido cycling trip as part of my wider trip to Japan in early September and just wanted to check I'm not missing anything/it's all doable in the time. I will be doing it on a weekday.\n\nI will be traveling to it from Osaka and will be heading onto Hiroshima after. I would have preferred to start/stay the night in Onomichi but as far as I can tell starting at Imabari will make the onward journey easier. Also just wanted to check that there was no disadvantage to doing the Shimanami Kaido the reverse way to most people.\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n\\- Take the train from Osaka to Imabari\n\n\\- Stay the night at Imabari\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n\\- Send luggage ahead to Hiroshima hotel\n\n\\- Start the Shimanami Kaido from Imabari after picking up bikes\n\n\\- Cycle to Omishima and stay the night\n\n**Day 3:**\n\n\\- Take the ferry to Okunoshima (bunny island) in the morning\n\n\\- Return from Okunoshima around 12 and continue the cycle ride\n\n\\- Finish the Shimanami Kaido and travel onto Hiroshima\n\nThanks!",

For a bit more money I save time on staying a night in imabari and travel time.  As far as I know, starting in imabari is a little bit easier since the wind will be to your back and you get to enjoy onomichi at the end of the bike session.",

I went the other way over 3 days a few weeks back and that way you get the longest and most impressive bridge at the end. But I am sure it would be pretty much as lovely the other way. \nYou will need to press on once off Okunoshima to get to Hiroshima that night but as long as you don\u2019t mind not having the time to take in more sights you should be fine to get back to Onimichi and take the train.",

            "comment": "I think the ride is probably similar either way, but as long as you have a small carrypack to store what you need for day 2/3, the right move is definitely shipping your luggage the first day to wherever you're staying after you're done with the Shimanami Kaido. I didn't do that, and picking up my luggage at my midpoint accommodations after finishing in Imabari was an annoying detour to make on my way back to Kyoto, given how the Shimanami Liner bus functions (the bus may stop to allow boarding at certain places but you may not be able to get off at all of them).",

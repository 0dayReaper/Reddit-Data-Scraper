My boyfriend will arrive on day 4 and leave on day 12. Thus, I will be alone the beginning and end of the trip. I am getting a 14 day JR pass starting day 8 for Kyoto while he will be getting a 7 day pass. We are both really into music so are trying to get a concert and/or music bar in.\n\nI know some days are pretty busy, haha. But I work in healthcare and walk all day every day and both of us love to pack things in to get the most of our experiences. We are both young and in good shape.

            "comment": "It mostly looks fine, but there are a few things that look a little off to me. You include \"Muromon\" market on day 12 and Kuromon market on day 15. I'm going to assume that these are both the same place, as I can't find anywhere called Muromon market. I don't know why you'd want to go there a second time as it isn't very big, but it's not going to be a great place to spend the evening unless there's a specific restaurant you want to visit. The stalls and most of the shops close by 6 pm at the latest. There are some restaurants that are open until later, but most of them close at 9 pm, with a handfull closing at 10 pm or later.\n\nMost people wouldn't want to do Disney Sea solo, but I'm going to assume that your boyfriend isn't interested as you scheduled it before he arrives.",

Do you have any suggestions for solo evening activities in Osaka to do instead that I haven\u2019t listed?\n\nYes I would rather not go alone haha but since he is only in Japan for 1/3 the amount of time that I will be he decided he\u2019d rather do more Tokyo sight seeing. So I will go alone! \n\nThank you for your input :)",

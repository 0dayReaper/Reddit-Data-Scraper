    "postText": "Note: this is just my personal experience; does not necessarily mean that everyone will have the same situation, but want to ease a bit of the anxiety I had regarding customs and immigration during this time.\n\nI arrived in Tokyo Haneda yesterday, fully anticipating and preparing for customs and immigration to be horror stories. I had come across series of posts online of other people\u2019s experience saying that it took them anywhere from 3-6h to pass through during Golden Week or during the past few weeks. All of this had me convinced that I would be unable to make it into downtown Tokyo before midnight.\n\nAnyways, long story short, things were okay. The process was definitely quicker because I had done my immigration and customs declarations of VisitJapanWeb ahead of arrival, but the entire process took 10-15m max. The line into immigration was just over 1 row and at least 8-10 booths were open on both the domestic and international sides.\n\nThis could have been for a multitude of reasons (later afternoon flight arrival, a few days into Golden Week etc.) Nevertheless, if you\u2019re arriving in the next few days, I wouldn\u2019t stress yourself out more than necessary about wait times \u2014 the employees at the airport were all very kind, helpful and organized which made what could\u2019ve been a stressful situation a calm one!\n\nHope this provides a bit of reassurance to anyone else who is worrying about the process.",

The longest line we encountered at USJ was 1.5 hours and the rest about 45 min-1 hour. I\u2019m not doubting that some horror stories on this sub are real and have happened but in my experience in the past two weeks we have found that a lot of stuff read on here is more of a perception than fact. We are both anxious people and rarely found ourselves out of sorts or anything.",

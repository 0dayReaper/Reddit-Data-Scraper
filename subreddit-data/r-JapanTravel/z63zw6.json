    "postText": "I am currently in Japan and just did the most idiotic thing of my life. \n\nYesterday I lost my Japan Rail Pass (very easy to do since it is just a small paper ticket) and needed to go on a bullet train today from Osaka to Tokyo. The passes are not able to be recreated so I was told I would need to by my ticket at full price, which is around $100 (the whole 7 day pass was less than $300). \n\nI was very upset and didn\u2019t want to pay for the new ticket so I decided to only pay for 1 stop ($10) and would tell the  the security officer in Tokyo that I left my rail pass on the train and convince him to let me through. Well, foreshadow, that didn\u2019t work at all.\n\nI boarded the train and got all the way to Tokyo, but when I tried to get out of the station, the security officer didn\u2019t care that I lost my pass and said I would need to pay for the full price of the fare. At this point, I kept digging the hole of lies deeper and told the officer that I only got on at the last stop so that I would only have to pay another $10 instead of the full $100. \n\nThe officer asked for proof I came from that station, but I didn\u2019t have any to offer. He said if I was lying and entered at a different station he would call the police, but I thought there would be no way for them to know and called their bluff.\n\nWell as it turns out, the Japanese are very high tech and were able to use facial recognition from security footage to track me and showed me the video of me boarding at the Osaka station. They said they were calling the police and I apologized. In the end, they never called the police but made me pay a $200 fine in addition to the full $100 fare. \n\nIt\u2019s actually very impressive how they were able to track me down, but I was scared shitless. Honestly, I feel like I got off lucky because I really thought I was going to jail.\n\nTL;DR I lost my rail pass, then lied about having a ticket to Tokyo to the security officer. I then got caught with facial recognition tech and had to pay a fine. Don\u2019t lose your rail pass and be an idiot like me.\n\nP.S throwaway account obv",

You could leave your bag in a locker at the station.\n\nI'd get an IC card, you can use it on the bus and local trains and charge it as you go, or just do everything with cash. Re: train system, download the Navitime app, it's really helpful\n\nThe number of temples makes sense I think but it's so fast, where are you flying from that 2 days looks worth the trip?",

I honestly find Dotonbori boring, everyone crowded around to just to take a picture with the Glico man. \n\nYou might not find 2 days is enough but it's a good start. \n\nDo not buy the Kansai pass with this itinerary, you won't get your money's worth. Just a regular Suica/Pasmo card will be good. I don't see a lot of train travel so you could probably get away with just paying by coins at the stations but would highly recommend getting Suica/Pasmo and just tapping in and out.",

Just make sure you have the right gear because you will walk alot and so you wont suffer like I did xDD  PS: I do hiking a lot so this was a big oof for me xDD\n\nFor travel, I would say take the bus unlimited for 1 day for 600 yen. I find it more worth with the price and it stops at the places you need to go.",

I thought it might be good to ponder about when you visit the shrine. Because of my poor feet, I took the bus to Nanzenji Temple, it took about 5 minutes to get to the next stop instead of walking 15 minutes.  \nYou can then take the bus to Kiyomizu-dera it stops you at Sannenzaka and then you walk up, the area there is good for shops and food xDD Then walk down to Yasaka Shrine/Gion for the night since I find Kyoto stores close early unless it is in Gion so it is better to visit before dusk.",

(Or ask the hotel if they can hold the bag for me, although I don't think that would be a smart idea)",

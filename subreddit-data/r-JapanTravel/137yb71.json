            "comment": "Day 1: Expect to be jetlagged, depending ln where you're coming from and the time you arrive. If you aren't traveling a long distance and expect to arrive early in the day, this is hitting the ground running, but doable. Otherwise, I would advise against it. Focus instead on getting your transit cards in order, getting to your hotel and finding a good meal. \n\nDay 2: Ok. Some might prefer a slower pace to linger in these areas but this would suit me just fine.it depends on what you want to do, though- if you have things like kimono rentals, maid cafes, etc. on your agenda, you probably don't want to cram everything into one day because it will simply cost too much time. Its ambitious but not undoable, depending on your activity lists. If you're simply visiting the shrines, sightseeing and grabbing the occasional meal you should be fine. \n\nDay 3: same as above. You could spend *days* in Ueno Park, just with all the museums and things to do or see. Ginza and Roppongi have a lot of popular cafes and restaurants, museums, shopping areas and points of interest that may take more time than others. \n\nI'm skipping over Osaka because I'm not as familiar with it. But I will warn you- USJ is always packed, most particularly on weekends. I recommend going EARLY and dedicating a good chunk of your day to it. You might not get to the rest of the stuff scheduled.\n\nDay 7: seems ok to me\n\nDay 8: Lol good luck. I mean that as gently as possible. But it's very ambitious. Fushimi Inari (southeast) is one some people just stop at quickly for a few photos, but if you plan to go up through at least the halfway point , you will need an hour or two. And then another hour-ish to get to Kinkakuji (north), on the opposite end of Kyoto, where transportation is limited. And then to Arashiyama, on the other part of Kyoto, is somewhere between 35ish-1 hr again (I'm being a bit broad, but it depends a lot on where you leave from exactly, how crowded it is, and how you get there). And you can expect it to be crowded at all of these places- the nature of crowds means everyone is forced to move more slowly, too. And queue up for ages, which you'll need to account for as well. \n\nMy advice would be to try grouping some of your Kyoto spots by proximity a little more carefully. For example, you have Gion and Pontocho on separate days, but these are easy to group because they're fairly close. I don't want to suggest you cut anything yet, because I don't know what specifically you want to see in these areas, or in Higashiyama. Kinkakuji is a little out of the way but not impossible to work in, but it depends on your priorities. \n\nAlternatively,  I don't know if your schedule would allow for any early morning sight seeing before you leave, but if you have your departure scheduled for midday/late afternoon you could try making the trip first thing in the morning. \n\nBack to Tokyo:\n\nYou must like Asakusa ! (I do too lol- I wasn't sure if you listed this twice on purpose though). Likewise with Shibuya.\n\nDay 14: I'd also spread these out and explore Shinjuku separately. There is a lot to do and enjoy there, but unless you're just going there for the nightlifeyou might not get to do or see much of it along with all of the stuff you have planned in Shibuya. \n\nIf you like anime, you might enjoy Ikebukuro. It has a lot of similarities to Akihabara, as there's a lot of gaming, anime, and manga merch. And also a Nintendo store, a pokemon cafe (or maybe the Kirby one. I don't recall. Theme cafes at any rate) and a shopping mall (Sunshine City). It's a cute little area I used to enjoy a lot. Odaiba also has the giant Gundam statue and Gundam base, along with the Diver City mall, red brick warehouse shopping, and a nice beach to walk on (or the Rainbow Bridge itself, if your up for the walk). \n\nFor your solo days, you could maybe fill in the gaps in from other parts of your itinerary, or plan a day trip for yourself. Yokohama, Mt. Takao, Kamakura, etc. are popular and quite nice (I have a particular fondness for Kamakura and Takao-san). Nikko, Hakone, Mt Fuji area (Kawaguchiko) are much further but doable with good planning and an early start. But you can also use the time to visit some museums, sightsee, or explore aything you missed in the first half of your trip. Tokyo always has something to do, and it's always pretty crowded. It's best to leave some wiggle room in your schedule for anything you simply run out of time for.",

                    "comment": "Hey, Thank you for your insight !\n\nFirst part of the Tokyo we are probably just gonna sight see and grab some meals along the way. We might actually just cut down some activities on day 1 and get things sorted out and settle down like you said.\n\nI also realized that USJ is gonna be really crowded that day and might have to change it.\n\nGreat point on the Kyoto spots ! We will revise this one for sure and yes our group activity should allow some morning activities ! Do you have any recommendations for Kyoto ?\n\nAnd yeah we are going back to Asakusa and Shibuya on our second time to Tokyo! Do you think it's not a good idea ?  Also thank you for the anime and solo trip recommendations ! Maybe i'll just go with your recommendations on my solo trip :D.",

                            "comment": "For Kyoto, I think you've hit all the biggest points of interest,it's just a matter of scheduling and distance. Arashiyama has Tenryuji near the bamboo forest, Kinkakuji has Ryoanji close by, and Fushimi Inari has Tofukuji nearby if you're not yet sick of temples/shrines and have some time left in those areas. But don't get too overwhelmed- just a few temples will suit most travelers, though you can't choose wrong with any you visit. I also recommend visiting Fushimi Inari and the bamboo forest early in the morning, but it's not strictly necessary- it just helps to avoid the crowds. \n\nIt's perfectly fine to visit those Tokyo locations again! There's plenty to enjoy and keep you busy. Like I said before, the crowds slow things down a bit, so it might give you a chance to revisit some places you might have missed or had to queue up for.",

Next to the toilets in the building adjacent to the market there's an unassuming shop that sells tuna sushi. They're actually a wholesaler and the point is this is the best sushi I've tried in Tokyo/ever, at 600 yen for 2 Otoro nigiris. I think they're a seafood wholesaler so I totally believe the stuff they carry is legit.  \nBTW Teamlabs provides you with shorts so no need to wear shorts. \nTl;Dr-naps, tsukiji toilet toro",

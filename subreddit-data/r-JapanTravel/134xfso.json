    "postText": "EDIT: Several folks pointed out the distillery is now closed until fall for renovations. Maybe this will be useful to someone traveling later in the year.\n\n==========\n\nI was looking for something recent like this before my trip to the distillery and couldn\u2019t find it \u2013 hopefully it\u2019s useful to someone else.\n\ntl;dr: Book your tickets on the Yamazaki website in your home country when the window opens (at least a month in advance). You need a ticket for the tour, the gift shop, and the tasting room, so don\u2019t show up without one. The tour info is basic, but I enjoyed the visit. The paid tasting room offered legendary whisky at a relatively affordable price, the gift shop was pretty slim pickings but did have a limit 1 300ml bottle that may or may not be something special \u2013 haven\u2019t had a chance to taste it yet.\n\nHere\u2019s the full write up:\n\nI went to the Yamazaki distillery on April 27, 2023. I booked the ticket on March 7th from my home in Oregon, loading the page right at 5PM PST. Yamazaki releases all tickets for the next month on the same day, and it\u2019s a lot like trying to get hot concert tickets. Have a browser or two ready. I think my position in line was something like 2000, my wife came in a few seconds after and was about 1500 higher. I was able to get tickets on the day I wanted, and all time slots were available. I checked again with my wife\u2019s when it went through (just for kicks) and verified that she also could have booked anything. Two hours later everything was gone.\n\nWe arrived at the distillery about five minutes before the tour. I think I put in a credit card when I booked, but payment was due at the door (1k yen per person). We definitely cut it too close; Japan is punctual, and the tour started right at 1:30. They talked for maybe five minutes at reception then started walking. I think if you\u2019re not there on time, the tour may go without you.\n\nThe tour was all in Japanese, and the guide spoke only limited English. There are iOS/Android apps to get an audio tour in other languages, but it definitely has less content than the Japanese; I\u2019d finish hearing my little description for a landmark, and the tour guide would still be talking for minutes. If you know anything about distilling you\u2019re not going to learn anything from the audio guide, but I found the tour itself enjoyable. The smell of the distillation room was awesome, as was the barrel house.\n\nAfter touring the facilities you go to an auditorium for a guided tasting. Again, the English content is a little lacking, but it\u2019s clear enough what to do. They had us taste two components of the Yamazaki blend \u2013 a white oak aged distillate and a \u201cwine barrel\u201d aged distillate that might have been sherry cask (?). Both were excellent. Then we tasted the NAS Yamazaki (fine), and finally were told to \u201cenjoy a pour however you like,\u201d which in practice meant 100% of the people of the room made highballs. There were some nice rice cracker snacks and a couple pieces of ho-hum chocolate to go with your highball.\n\nThat was the end of the paid tour, at which point we were able to go to the gift shop and paid tasting room. Both of these were by reservation only, so if you don\u2019t have a ticket, don\u2019t bother showing up. The paid tasting was awesome; they had a flight of Yamazaki 18, Hakushu 18, and Hibiki 21 for \\~1800 yen (\\~$14). They also sold a la carte pours of Yamazaki 25, Hakushu 25, Hibiki 30, and some other less legendary stuff (though they did have a 12 year mizunara cask that also seems pretty special). The old pours were \\~3700 yen each (\\~$27). The prices are from my fuzzy memory, but they\u2019re in the ballpark. All pours are 15ml (about half an ounce), and the sign says 3 pours per person. My wife and I got the 18/21 flight, plus pours of the Yamazaki 25, Hakushu 25, and mizunara cask 12 year. I was really hoping the older stuff wouldn't blow me away, but the Yama 25 was the best by a country mile, and likely the best whisky I've had, period. In retrospect, the only change I would have made was swapping the Hibiki 21 for the 30.\n\nAfter tasting through all that with my wife, I was tipsy enough that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d appreciate more, though I\u2019ve read reports of other people going back for a second round and being served.\n\nThe gift shop had minimal whisky, which I expected after reading other people\u2019s reports. Their only interesting Japanese stuff was a small bottle (200ml?) of regular NAS Yamazaki packaged with a small glass (limit 2 per person), and a 300ml bottle of \u201cDistillery Limited Edition Yamazaki\u201d packaged with a highball glass and a box of the mediocre chocolates for 3200 yen (\\~$24, limit 1 per person). The limited edition had literally zero other info; no age statement, no info on the blend. Just 300ml of mystery juice.  My tasting wrapped up around 4:00PM, but there were still plenty of the limited edition gift sets on the shelf when I reached the shop.\n\nI skipped the NAS Yamazaki, and only bought one of our two allocated distillery limited gift sets, since I couldn\u2019t figure out what was in the pretty bottle. Checking on Amazon Japan after the tour I found the distillery limited bottle by itself selling for 4x the price, so it\u2019s definitely something people care about enough to pay a premium on the Japanese secondary market. Live and learn.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: My take-home whisky buying experience at other stores\n\nI researched before I went and knew that all the premium Japanese stuff would not be available at retail prices. I saw plenty of NAS Hakushu and Yama for 10k yen (\\~$75), and 12 year age stated for about double that. These are not exciting prices for me, I still occasionally catch the age stated stuff at Costco periodically for less. Given that Japanese whisky is if anything more rare in Japan, I focused on bourbon. I picked up 3 bottles of 12 year old Wild Turkey 101 at Bic Camera in Shinjuku, on the advice of Reddit. It is exceptional stuff, at least for the current bourbon market. My palate is not good enough for tasting notes, but it reminds me strongly of the mid-range bottles I was picking up in 2010 back when I was first getting into whiskey. So +1 recommendation here. With the tax-free discount they worked out to just about $50/bottle. They still had a couple others left on the shelf, so it seems like there's still a decent amount of it around.\n\nI did not see any Blanton\u2019s variants or Evan Williams 12 year, but I wasn\u2019t looking very hard. This was an anniversary/tourist trip for me, not a bourbon hunting trip :) You might have better luck going to specialty stores. Wild Turkey 101 8 year was everywhere, but from what I read it\u2019s a pretty small step from the regular 101, and didn\u2019t seem worth devoting bag space to.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to come home with zero Japanese whisky, so I picked up a bottle each of Super Nikka and Nikka Session at Don Quijote. Super Nikka was \\~2400 yen ($18), the Session was 3800 ($28). Both of these are firmly in the \"highball whisky\" category for me. They pack enough flavor to handle the dilution, but read very \"hot\" if you have them neat; lots of alcohol burn.\n\nI also thought long and hard about picking up a bottle of Chartreuse at Bic Camera for \\~$40. In addition to whisk(e)y, I like cocktails, and the Chartreuse drought seems not to have reached Japan yet. Something to consider if you\u2019re struggling to fill up your suitcases, but be aware that Japan sells an 80 proof bottling in addition to the standard 110 proof, so make sure you're getting the right one.\n\nI did not see any Nikka From the Barrel, which I know can be a good value pickup. It seems like they do annual releases of it or something, and it\u2019s cheap when it comes out, then gets more expensive/harder to find as it dries up. I checked the price on [Amazon.co.jp](https://Amazon.jp), and it seemed like it was selling for \\~4.5k yen, which is \\~double MSRP (though still a decent price), and it was competing for bag space with things I can't pick up state-side. Plus I never actually saw it in a store. As an aside, checking on [Amazon.co.jp](https://Amazon.jp) for something you\u2019re interested in is a good way to get an idea of stock. Japan is a pretty efficient market when it comes to spirits, since I think individuals can sell whisky on consignment or something. Anyhow, if Amazon lists the price of the thing you want substantially above MSRP, I think you\u2019ll need to be lucky to find it on a shelf at normal price, especially in big cities. Also, if you're sticking in one place long enough, most hotels will let you get Amazon deliveries. Have the booze come to you!\n\nMy flight home had a layover in Vancouver, which pretty much nixed picking up duty free at Narita \u2013 you go through US customs in YVR, then go through regular security like a domestic flight. You never see your checked luggage, so there's no way to stash a 700ml bottle before security makes you pour it out. It's possible you can get it through with your carry-on if it's in a sealed duty free bag with recent receipt, but what limited reports I found online reported mixed success at this.\n\nI looked around the duty free shops in Narita for grins since I had a little time, but found nothing compelling anyhow. I did see the same Super Nikka I bought at Don Quijote for sale in a fancy box for more than 3 times the price. I would not recommend paying 8k JPY for it; it is not that good.\n\nHope this helps somebody. Happy drinking!",

It's free and also allows access to the tasting and gift shop, just not the tour of the distilling itself. I did the Yamazaki 18, Hakushu 18, and Hibiki 21flight and was really into both the Yamazaki and Hibiki. Came back to the states and looked up the bottle prices - I guess I won't have them again until I go back to Japan! I got that same 300ml limited edition thing - guess I should've gotten my friend to buy one too...",

                    "comment": "I did some cocktail drinking on the trip. It seems to be a mostly tourist and expat pursuit, at least at the higher end bars I was looking at.\n\nTokyo:\n\nGen Yamamoto was the most distinctive. It's one guy (Gen), in a small, austere bar, maybe eight seats? Reservation only, book by phone seven days in advance. He speaks English well. Cocktails are omakase style (bartenders choice), you just tell him \"how many.\" Drinks are small (&lt; 4 ounces) tend to be 3-4 ingredients, featuring seasonal produce, and finish at low proof \u2013 he says most are \\~5% abv. The glassware was beautiful, but not showy. The drinks are expensive given the size and ABV, but some of the best tasting drinks I've had. The bar regularly shows up on the \"top X bars in the world\" list. I think of it like \"if cocktails were ikebana.\" The bill for a six drink tasting was \\~8k yen.\n\nI also tried the SG Club (AKA Sip and Guzzle). I think you can walk in upstairs (\"Guzzle\"), though you'd probably want to do it close to open. The downstairs (\"Sip\") is also reservation only, and you can book online. The drinks here are more like standard American cocktail bar drinks, albeit with Japanese ingredients. My wife and I split four drinks between us here, which ranged from 1900 yen to 2400 yen each. Two I thought were unique and exceptional \u2013 forget the exact names, but one took inspiration from nigiri, and the other from trying to recreate the flavors of white wine without using any wine. They were both delicious and succeeded at their concepts. The other two we tried (their Pi\u00f1a Colada, and something with spirolina in it) were not as interesting and read a little sweet to me.\n\nI tried and failed to go to Ben Fidditch. They are also mostly phone reservation only, and I could not succeed in dialing their number with Skype. I tried showing up five minutes before opening (6PM), and there was one group in front of us without a reservation. That group got in, and I was offered an 8PM seat, but we had a dinner reservation so it was a no-go. I have heard fantastic things about them though.\n\nWe went downstairs to Bar B&amp;F (same group, same building). I liked the space a lot there. They're a no-menu place \u2013 the bartender will ask you a few questions about what you like and whip out some drinks. The technique was impressive, but our drinks were both pretty bland. I blame my American palate; I like big showy stuff like the Last Word, Penicillin, Jungle Bird, but flavors here were more refined/subdued (and IMO missing acid).\n\nI've also heard good things about Zoetrope as a whisky bar, but did not try it myself.\n\nWe only tried one bar in Osaka. Bar Nayuta seems to be the one everyone recommends, but we didn't plan ahead to try and reserve, and it was slammed the night we were looking. I went over to Hollow Bar, which is a new-ish spot by one of the former Nayuta bartenders. It was also one of the \"tell me what you like\" kind of places with no formal menu. I did like that I was able to walk in and get a spot at the very modern bar. Drinks were good, not great, and again tended sweet. I was excited by him offering an \"Oolong old fashioned,\" but puzzled that he added Monin apricot syrup to it. It added an oddly synthetic fruit note to the drink (think peach gummies), and made it notably too sweet. Drinks were a little under 2k each.\n\nIf you happen to be going to Kanazawa, I had a fun time at Furansu. It's a bar run by two  half-French/half-Japanese brothers. Both put drinks together, but it was clear one was the menu mastermind and the other was the hospitality guy. The division of labor worked well for them. I didn't have anything life changing, but the drinks were all solidly made, and high on showmanship \u2013 lots of quirky glassware, use of smoke, etc. They were big on doing their own infusions and a little fermentation \u2013 I tried their tepache and it was good enough that I asked the bartender for the recipe. Drinks around 1500 yen. I walked in just after open on Saturday and got seats at the bar, though the place filled up. Came back again on Sunday and it was pretty chill/I assume you could walk in at any point.\n\nI also went to Kohaku bar in Kanazawa, which was primarily a whisky place. They definitely won on their ice program; the rocks were perfectly clear and impeccably carved crystals. The bartender there was telling us that Suntory flies him out to US bars to teach our bartenders how to hand-cut ice. Drinks were served with little bites, but there was no cover charge, which was surprising. We had a pair of old fashioneds for 1500 JPY each.",

It\u2019s a great experience and the two main guys behind the bar are excellent at what they do both in drink quality and service. Another is called Bees Knees, which is a great bar which fills quick but a delicious menu. They have been in Asias top 50 the past while and the drinks show it. Neither of these are so much hidden gems however you wouldn\u2019t find them if you weren\u2019t looking for them/happened to randomly select them from a scan of Google maps bar pins.",

Yoichi is the birthplace of Nikka, and apart from the distillery the tour also talks about the founder and the early history of the company, and brings you to visit some of the buildings used at that point in time. I've been to both Yoichi and Miyagikyo and I thought the Yoichi one was a better experience overall. Plus, Yoichi's distillery is much more accessible from the nearest station so that's a plus as well",

The characteristic of each piece is created by overlapping their individuality, with a soft, glamorous scent and a sweet and smooth taste\n\nNot that it really clarifies anything (and who knows where it came from), though it kind of makes it sound like a blend. It also wouldn't surprise me if contents varied significantly by batch. I thought \"wine\" here might be a dumbed down translation of sherry, but it also looks like Yamazaki also uses Bordeaux barrels. Mysteries within mysteries.",

A few of the main stores like yamamaya (sp?) and liquor mountain had stuff like AA 8 year and EW12. At some specialty wine shops I saw Blantons Black and also the regular US stuff at pretty reasonable prices (70 and under). I even found a Father and Son 13 year. I found more vintage CGF and 90s 8/101 (albeit at full secondary) than I did blantons red/gold. The one highlight find for me was the 2022 Yama LE. It was only $300 which seems like a fair compromise between retail ($90) and secondary ($800).",

    "postText": "I bought 3 JR passes on 4/23/2023 on the official website ([japanrailpass-reservation.net](https://japanrailpass-reservation.net)) and made seat reservations for 5/23. I just logged onto my account today to make seat reservations for 5/25 and my account page says \" You do not have any JAPAN RAIL PASSes at this time. \" \n\nI received a confirmation email when I purchased the passes on 4/23 and have 3 separate reservation numbers in the email, and I also show a charge for the passes on my credit card. I sent an inquiry through their website but I thought I'd reach out here to see if anyone else experienced the same issue.",

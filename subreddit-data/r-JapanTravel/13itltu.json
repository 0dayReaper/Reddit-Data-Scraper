    "postText": "Hey all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a Tokyo resident planning a trip to Matsushima/Sendai in July. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for me? Here are my thoughts so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuly 14:\n\n\\- Take the shinkansen to Sendai, arrive in Sendai maybe around noon\n\n\\- Explore Sendai, Sendai Castle Ruins, Zuihoden\n\n\\- Go to hotel in Matsushima, chill along the bay\n\n\\- Maybe an evening boat tour\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuly 15th:\n\n\\- Ideally a hiking day: Geibiki Gorge or Okama Crater or Naruko Gorge are my thoughts\n\n\\- I'm probably gonna be a solo \u5916\u4eba female so I'm not sure how safe this is\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuly 16th:\n\n\\- Maybe that hot air balloon tour in the morning\n\n\\- Fukuurajima, Godaido of Zuiganji\n\n\\- Oshima Island\n\n\\- Zuiganji Temple\n\n\\- Take a night bus back to Tokyo that evening, arrive in Tokyo the next morning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI booked this trip on a total whim so I'm not sure how to make the most of my trip to the Matsushima area. I'd like to go on a hike to a really cool place as well as just explore the islands. No real goal, just to go see the northern parts of the main island. Are there any adjustments I need to make to this plan?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks all!",

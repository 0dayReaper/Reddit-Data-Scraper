    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI booked the Fuji-Excursion 7 from Shinjuku to Otsuki with my jrpass and want to get to Kawaguchiko so I bought the Fujikyu Express Pass and was wondering if that means I can stay on the Fuji-Excursion 7 and show them my pass or do I need to get off and back on.? Quite confused how it works aha\n\nAs I've read a ton of confusing/conflicting information online. \n\n\nThanks.",

There will be many other tourists just like you too so get ready for some waiting! \n\nFor fuji excursion train, there should not be any need to change trains. \n\nFor the rest who didn\u2019t book excursion trains and took azusa/kaji train, read below, if in doubt, double check with the train staff at platform or keep a lookout for the English announcements on the train) \n\nYou do not need to get off the train if you are on car1-3 which is heading to kawaguchiko. If you are not on car1-3,  cars 4 onwards will likely disconnect from cars1-3 at otsuki. As you don\u2019t have a reserved ticket heading to kawaguchiko from otsuki, u have to move to car1-3 before or when the train reaches otsuki. Likely you have to stand for the remaining 1h trip as all the seats in car1-3 will be taken. Many people will be standing. I recommend you move to these cars before the train reaches otsuki rather than trying to board the car1-3 by getting off at otsuki.\n\nThe reason why this is all so confusing is because kawaguchiko station is much shorter and can only accommodate up to 3 cars\u2026 when we took excursion back from kawaguchiko, there was only 3 cars. Subsequently at otsuki it became much longer.",

From otsuki to kawaguchiko, the line is operated by fujikyu express - a private operator. So the jr pass will not cover tbe otsuki leg to kawaguchiko. Dont worry they wont throw u out of the train because you dont have an available ticket from otsuki to kawaguchiko. Basically most of the times (with some exceptions) you can get onto most trains with just paying the minimum fare or value in your suica/pasmo/ic card/ a paper ticket and then top up when u get off the train either with the station staff at the exit counter or those top-up machines.",

To go back, we again had our reserved seats for Otsuki to Shinjuku, but I was able to pay for the remaining portion at the Kawaguchiko ticket desk for the return trip, and this could be paid with a credit card.",

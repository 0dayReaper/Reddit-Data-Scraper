    "postText": "Hello! I am planning a \\~20-day solo trip in early to mid-November with a focus on fall foliage and outdoor activities. I am most interested in seasonal sights, a few specific anime-related spots, and some hobby-specific activities. Huge fan of Japanese cuisine, but I don't drink alcohol.\n\nSome background: Early 20s (F), went to Japan several years ago for 1 week (Tokyo/Kyoto), functionally fluent in Japanese, limited budget but willing to splurge on key experiences (marked with **\\***). I would consider myself average/relatively fit, as in not likely to run any road races but could walk 30k steps per day without much trouble. I am also an early riser\u2014searching for things to do before shops/attractions open. I'd like to avoid crowds if possible, although I realize that this will be difficult in momiji-viewing spots.\n\nThings I would like advice on: Pacing, budget accommodation options, practical &amp; safety tips, transportation options. Thank you in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1: Arrival in Tokyo (NRT)**\n\n* Most likely flying Air Canada from Toronto\n* PM arrival: Free afternoon/evening to adjust\n* **(?)** Capsule hotel or hostel? Looking for safe and budget-friendly options!\n* **(?)** Are there any places to store a carry-on suitcase for the trip? I would like to leave it in Tokyo until the last few days (when I do all of my souvenir shopping) so that I can travel backpack-only.\n\n**Day 2: Tokyo -&gt; Onomichi**\n\n* Ginkgo trees at Meiji Jingu Gaien\n* Half-day trip to Iruma, Saitama (personal reason)\n* Travel to Onomichi, either by afternoon shinkansen or night bus\n* Onomichi: Is anything open/worth visiting after dark (sunset \\~17:00) **(?)**\n\n**Day 3: Onomichi &amp; Shimanami Kaido\\***\n\n* Spot cats\n* Senkoji\n* Onomichi Shotengai?\n* Rent a bicycle and start Shimanami Kaido\n* Stay in Ikuchijima or Omishima\u2014any accommodation recs **(?)**\n\n**Day 4: Shimanami Kaido -&gt; Matsuyama**\n\n* Finish cycling the Shimanami Kaido to Imabari\n* Take a look at Imabari Castle, time-permitting\n* Train to Matsuyama\n* Dogo Onsen\n* **(?)** Does Matsuyama feel safe at night?

Misen hike from Daishoin\n* Take the ropeway down\n* Momijidani Park\n* Travel to Akashi in the afternoon; not sure about timing here **(?)**\n   * **(?)** Is anything open in Akashi after 17:00?\n\n**Day 8: Akashi -&gt; Kyoto**\n\n* Akashi Park / just explore\n* Uo no Tana Market\n* Hello Kitty Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka, then continue to Kyoto\n* Gion Odori\n* Go bouldering in a local gym\n\n**Day 9: Kyoto**\n\n* Free exploration day: Philosopher's Path, Kiyomizudera, Kamogawa area, etc.\n   * Is the Kyoto Sento Imperial Palace worth visiting **(?)**\n* **(\\*)** Also interested in short classes/experiences i.e. wagashi-making, archery, etc.\n* Food recommendations much appreciated\n\n**Day 10: Kyoto**\n\n* Arashiyama\n   * Togetsu-kyo**\\***\n   * Kimono Forest?\n   * Consume large amounts of tofu products\n* Mt.

            "comment": "Hello, I\u2019m Japanese. Just letting you know that early to mid November is too early for fall foliage looking at the places you are visiting. For example, in Kyoto, the foliage season is usually between the end of November and the beginning of December. The only chance you might be able to see some is at Kawaguchiko. If your main focus in Japan is autumn foliage, you will need to go up north.",

In November, there is an autumn foliage festival around the lake. Leaves and trees are lightened up during the time.\n\nIf I were you, I would shuffle my itinerary like below:\n\nTokyo (Nov 10 put the majority of your Tokyo stay here) \u2192 Kawaguchiko (mid November) \u2192 Onomichi \u2192 Matsuyama \u2192 Hiroshima/Miyajima \u2192 Osaka \u2192 Nara/Uji/Kyoto (Late in November like 25-28 even until 29) \u2192 Tokyo (spend overnight and leave)\n\nThis way, there will be a chance that you can see some fall foliage in Nara and Kyoto. It may not be the peak, but you will be able to see its beginning.",

            "comment": "Assuming the carry-on suitcase you mentioned is empty (if you're only using it for four of your nineteen days), why not just buy a suitcase in Japan rather than worry about storing a suitcase for the whole trip? \n\nDisclaimer that I haven't been to Matsuyama in many years, but it's a pretty small city. After dark it'll probably just be quiet out away from any izakaya.\n\nI am usually a night bus advocate and it's my primary way of travelling Tokyo/Osaka, but I would not personally do a night bus and immediately go hiking. You'll arrive at 5-6am in Tokyo feeling gross, I doubt you'd feel hike-ready unless you got yourself a *really* good night bus.\n\nIf you're only spending the night in Tokyo before immediately leaving for Onomichi, then just do a capsule hotel. Capsule hotels are an excellent \"I just need to sleep before I go somewhere else\" option and their capsule nature does mean they're very safe. If you're still worried, the 9hours capsule chain do some branches that are women-only and otherwise the capsule floors will be separated by gender with locking doors so it's all fine for safety.\n\nFor Osaka castle - it's pretty busy, and it's very easy to get castle and temple fatigue in a single trip. Keep it pencilled in, but don't be afraid to drop it if you're just not feeling it on the day.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. First time in Japan for my husband and I's belated honeymoon (!). Will be brief below; just wanted to know if this was a reasonable pace for 21 days. Would love to hear any specific recommendations for some chill to intermediate hiking trails out of any of the below mentioned areas.  Thanks everyone! \n\nAugust 24: YYZ --&gt; HND \n\nAugust 25: Land in HND late afternoon. Keikyu line from HND to hotel in Asakusa. Rest. \n\nAugust 26: Asakusa and Ueno area (usual sights; mainly walking if possible). \n\nAugust 27: Akihibara and Shinjuku (Shopping/browsing, museums then Golden Gai at night) \n\nAugust 28: Tsujiki outer market (AM) then Ginza for the afternoon. Prepare for Mt Fuji trek. \n\nAugust 29-30: Mt Fuji Summit.\n\nAugust 31: Rest day OR Harajuku/Shibuya (alternatively, can move to end of trip). \n\nSept 1: Forward luggage to Osaka. Shinkansen to Kyoto; check into Ryokan and spend rest of the day exploring Gion, Kiyomizu-dera, Nishiki market. \n\nSept 2: Fushimi Inari (as early as we can, but planning on doing the hike up), then back to Kyoto for more castles/temples. \n\nSept 3: Arashiyama bamboo forest + Kinkaku-ji (originally planned to do it in this order, but if we do Kinkaku-ji first then maybe we can do Arashiyama for sunset - can anyone comment on crowds during sunset?). Transit to Osaka. \n\nSept 4: Osaka Bay, Kita, Osaka Castle. Minami area for dinner. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Sept 5: Day trip to Uji and Nara (feasible in a day? opinions are quite mixed on Reddit). \n\nSept 6: Minami area/Tennoji (not set in stone)\n\nSept 7: Northern Osaka; cup noodle museum, Suntory distillery, Minoh falls (not set) \n\nSept 8: Himeji castle (early AM), Kobe (PM)\n\nSept 9: Forward luggage to Tokyo. Shinkansen to Hiroshima and spend rest of day exploring locally. \n\nSept 10: Miyajima island day trip. \n\nSept 11: Shinkansen to Tokyo. Bar crawl in the evening.\n\nSept 12: Possible day trip out of Tokyo. \n\nSept 13: Last minute souvenir shopping. \n\nSept 14: HND --&gt; YYZ",

Assuming you depart Tokyo at 8am (arrive Kyoto 11am), by the time you finish dropping off luggage it is noon, then you have six hours to do Gion, Kiyomizudera / Ninenzaka / Sannenzaka, and Nishiki Market (which by the way is not a night market). Unless you are only planning to see Gion at night? \n\n&gt; Sep 3\n\nDo bamboo forest first (like 7am) if you want any semblance of peace, especially considering it is a weekend. \n\n&gt; Uji and Nara in a day\n\nIt depends on how much you want to see at each place. If it's just to eat matcha ice cream + Byodo-in + walking past some deer + Todaiji, then a day trip is possible. If you want to do a lot more, then it will not be enough. The big constraint is the opening hours of temples.\n\n&gt; Osaka castle\n\nA waste of time if you are also seeing Himeji Castle.",

I calculated my route using the JR rail fare calculator and even without accounting for the day trip from Tokyo on the 13th, I can still make the pass worth it. If you are planning on doing the usual sights from Kyoto (Arashiyama, Fushimi Inari, Uji, Nara) these can all utilize the JR pass. \n\nAdditionally, it seems that after the pandemic the JR Pass can now be used at ticket machines to reserve/scan at certain gates so its an extra layer of convenience.",

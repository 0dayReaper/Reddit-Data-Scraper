Ideally we have too much on here (feel free to add suggestions) and just play by ear what we get too.

            "comment": "I can answer the Hakone bits since I was there not that long ago.\n\nBasically with the Hakone Freepass you use the pass itself as your ticket.  You show it to the attendants at the various transportations (ie, to get on the pirate ship you go to the pirate ship entry area and line up for those with tickets, show your pass, and get on) and that's that.  Occasionally they will stamp the pass although I never did figure out exactly why on that one since you can still use the modes of transportation unlimited times.\n\nFor example, we had the pass stamped each day when we first used it on the ropeway and then after, as we used the ropeway some more, it wasn't stamped again.  There were no issues with it.\n\nFor buses:  same thing, get on the bus, show the pass, and you are good to go assuming you get on the correct bus. :)\n\nFor the Hakone Tozan Train - same thing.  Show the pass and off you go.\n\nIf you have an electronic version of the pass (I think that's a thing) then I'm guessing that you just have to show the eletronic code / qr / ticket whatever it is.  \n\nBasically, once you get to Hakone-Yumoto you use the freepass for basically everything.  Note: there are some bus companies that are not covered by the pass so just double check if you're going to take a bus.",

Like that the Ropeway/Gondola has two legs.\n\n* Sounzan to Odawara\n* Odawara to Togendai\n\nSimilarly, the train goes from Hakone-Yumoto to Gora.  The cable car goes from Gora to Sounzan.   It can all be a lot more obvious with the little tourist map they give you.\n\nThe one limitation to the Hakone Freepass is it only lets you go from Odawara -&gt; Hakone-Yumoto and then back once for each leg.  It is not supposed to be usable once you return to Odawara in case you were planning on zipping back to Odawara for some reason.  \n\n\nedit: I was just there about a week ago, and this is all very fresh",

So when you say things like one round trip I am not sure which method of transport you are describing. I'm also like totally confused at this \"cannot be used after retuning to departure station\" like, the point of the freepass is the unlimited travel? I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me but I want to make sure that we're on the same page with everything",

The train line from Hakone-Yumoto to Gora is a different line than the one to Odawara.

If Nunobiki, then you could probably do that and Himeji in one day with an early start. If you have the JR Pas or certain JR West passes, then you can take the shinkansen between Himeji Station and Shin-Kobe Station. I have only done Himeji with a late start (~10am), and it took up most of the day counting meals/transport/shopping. I\u2019ve done Nunobiki followed by shopping in Sannomiya Station area (main Kobe transit hub) or visiting Kitano. The arboretum is nice for a day of wandering and picnicking, but is far from central Kobe and involves taking a shuttle bus. I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing both the arboretum and Himeji in the same day due to transit time and hassle.",

For a first time tourist, I\u2019d start with Nunobiki Herb Garden, explore Kitano, get pastries somewhere along the way (Kobe is well know for bread/pastries, rec Patisserie Tooth Tooth for a nice afternoon tea set), walk down through Chinatown, and end in the Harborland/Meriken Park area for dinner on the water. You could do all this on foot or buy a Kobe Loop Bus (tourist shuttle-bus) pass. If you\u2019re interested in sake, you might consider reworking that itinerary to include touring one of the famous sake breweries in Nada-ku.",

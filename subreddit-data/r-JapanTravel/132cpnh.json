    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm after some help revising my itinerary for my trip later this year from 15 Nov - 25 Dec. I've trawled through hundreds of threads in this sub and hope I've planned enough to keep us busy, but not so much that we'll be too exhausted to get through the trip. I'm wanting to finalise at least my accommodation locations so I can start booking them next month. If we can't get through everything in the major cities like Tokyo, Kyoto &amp; Osaka, we're happy to save them for the next trip, but we definitely want to see &amp; do as much as possible in the other cities as there's a smaller likelihood of us going back to them in the future. If we do go back, it'll be in smaller 2 week trips, not like this 6 week trip.\n\nFor some background, I'm going with my partner, we are 29F &amp; 32M. We will be celebrating both of our birthdays while in Japan, which we are really looking forward to (turning 30 &amp; 33). His interests are cooking/food, knives, anime and history. My main interests are food, onsen and sightseeing. He has never been before, while I have been a few times, but I've always stuck to the standard Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka itineraries due to going with first timers each time. \n\nHere is my revised itinerary - note that we'll be arriving from Australia, so there won't be any jetlag, and the bolded headings are where we plan to base our accommodation (with the exception of Fukuoka, as you'll see):\n\n**Tokyo - 15-22 Nov (8 days)**\n\n* Day 1 (Wed) - Arrive at Haneda at 5:15pm.

Unsure what to do, but we are flying 3pm Hakata \u2192 Haneda, then 6:25pm Haneda \u2192 Australia\n\nI feel that the Fukuoka portion of the trip is a bit of a mess with nonstop changes to the accommodations, but I'm not sure how to tidy it up without removing too much - I am super keen to go to both Kurokawa Onsen and Yakushima if possible. I'm also not sure what to do with the luggage - maybe store it in Fukuoka somewhere during the time between Kurokawa Onsen to the end of Yakushima?\n\nPlease give me any advice, recommended changes, and any general constructive criticisms to the itinerary. Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "For Okayama-Setouchi leg, I would recommend either forwarding your big luggage from Okayama on day 27 to Hiroshima (they can delay arrival for up to 7 days), or ask the hotel to hold it for you until day 30 when you are back in town\n* day 27 Okayama+Kurashiki\n* day 28 naoshima and STAY ON naoshima (there are hostels/B&amp;B)\n* day 29 Teshima if you are into art installations then stay overnight at takamatsu\n* day 30 back to Okayama\n\n\nWill you be renting a car in Kyushu? Your itin look way too full for train travel, most of the trains are not as fast as the ones along the Kansai-Kanto route.\n\nAs for your luggage, you can ask either of your hotels in Fukuoka (arriving leg or departing leg) to hold, most will hold as long as it\u2019s not excessive in quantity nor time (I\u2019ve had luggage held at hotel for a week).\n\nYou could also ship it via Takkubin and postpone its arrival (up to 7 days iirc) so essentially the courier just hold your luggage for you.\n\n* Nagasaki itin is way too full for a single day, even with car tbh\n* Kurokawa Onsen is very out of the way in the heart of Aso which takes quite a bit of driving. Note that there are stretches of that drive which are snowy/ice in late Dec (lots of signage for chains) - any reason why specifically kurokawa onsen? I wasn\u2019t particularly impressed by it while I was there, though there were a few great pastry/snack shops there.\n* Kagoshima is a better option than Kumamoto to be close(r) to the ferry for Yakushima. You can consider going to Sakurajima or Sengan-en that day.\n\nSource: went to spring and fall seasons of Setouchi Triennale back in 2019 and did the surrounding area, spend two weeks in Kyushu Dec 2023.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your detailed response! I hadn\u2019t even considered staying on naoshima overnight, so it\u2019s something to look into for sure. Is Teshima more interesting than Ogijima? \n\nRE driving - we had only planned on driving in Yakushima. Being from Australia, neither of us have driven in icy/snowy conditions before, so we didn\u2019t want to take the risk in Kyushu (whereas I\u2019ve read that Yakushima roads may be wet but not icy/snowed over in winter). \n\nNagasaki - I think I\u2019ll be happy if we can get everything up to Dejima done \ud83d\ude05 worst case we can go back on day 40 if we really feel we\u2019ve missed out. \n\nGetting to Kurosawa onsen - I\u2019ve found a bus that takes you there from Hakata stn in about 2.5 hrs with the SunQ bus pass. The only problem with afterwards would be getting to Kagoshima (it\u2019s much longer to get there than to go back to Hakata). I picked it over Yufuin and Beppu just purely based on other people\u2019s reviews, photos, and what I\u2019ve seen on the internet. The Beppu hells and sand baths look cool and all, but I don\u2019t think they really excite us - we are just after a quiet onsen town with really good onsen. But if it means the flow of transport will be better overall, I would definitely consider the other onsen towns.\n\nAlso thank you for the tips regarding luggage :) handy to know that the hotel may store it for some time for us!",

Bear in mind that I was there for the festival so this speaks of the art more than the islands\u2019s nature.",

    "postText": "Hey, everyone!\n\nMy mom, dad, sister, and I are planning a trip to Japan from the dates of 30th May to 7th June. We spend a few days together, and then I go away on a solo leg of the journey to explore the more rural parts of Japan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is our rough itinerary as of now. I would love to have your thoughts and critiques regarding viability, expense, etc.\n\n**First 3 days (Tokyo) \u2013 30th May to 2nd June**:\n\n* 30th May: Landing in Narita at 2:30 PM. Reach hotel in Koto ward via train. Relax after the journey.\n* 31st May: Explore **Shinjuku**, **Shibuya Crossing**, **Shibuya Sky**. Break for lunch. **Sensoji Temple** in the evening.\n* 1st June: Day trip to **Hakone**. Go on the popular **Pirate Ship cruise**. May take the train out from Tokyo, or a cab if not too expensive.\n* 2nd June: visit **Odaiba**, **Rainbow Bridge,** and **teamLAB Planets** Museum\n\n**Next day (Transit to Kyoto via Mount Fuji) \u2013 3rd June**:\n\n* Morning to Afternoon \u2013 transit from Tokyo to Mount Fuji. Spend 4-5 hours exploring **Kawaguchi Lake**.\n* Afternoon onwards \u2013 resume journey to Kyoto by hailing the train and reach Kyoto by night-time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom here, I take a diversion for a short **solo leg of the trip** to explore the countryside prefectures of **Toyama** &amp; **Nagano**, while my mom, dad, and sister will spend the **next 2 days in Kyoto.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For parents &amp; sister \u2013 Next 2 days (Kyoto) \u2013 4th June &amp; 5th June**:\n\n* 4th June \u2013 visit **Fushimi-Inara Shrine** in the morning, stop at **Kamogawa River** for the afternoon, and visit the **Arashiyama Bamboo Grove** in the evening.\n* 5th June \u2013 visit **Kinkaku-ji (Golden Temple)** in the morning, and relax for the rest of the day.\n* 6th June \u2013 morning train back to Tokyo\n\n**For me \u2013 Next 1 day (Transit from Kyoto to Toyama) \u2013 4th June**:\n\n* Morning \u2013 take early Thunderbird / Shinkansen to Toyama station and check into lodging.\n* Afternoon \u2013 take a bus down south to the **Shirakawa-go Historic Villages** (Ogimachu, Ainokura).\n* Evening \u2013 after spending 4-5 hours, take the bus back to Toyama.\n\n**For me \u2013 Next 1 day (Transit from Toyama to Nagano) \u2013 5th June**:\n\n* Morning \u2013 take the morning train from **Toyama** to **Nagano**\n* Afternoon \u2013 from Nagano, take the Myoko-Haneuma Line to the **Tsubame Onsen** town.\n* Evening \u2013 explore the onsen &amp; adjacent **Sotaki Falls**. Then, return back to stay in Nagano.\n* Next day morning (6th June) \u2013 take the train back to Tokyo\n\n**Last 1 day (Tokyo) \u2013 6th June**:\n\n* Morning \u2013 all 4 of us meet in the accommodation\n* Afternoon \u2013 visit Sensoji temple, explore the Imperial Palace\n* Evening \u2013 shopping for souvenirs in Shibuya\n\n**Final day morning (7th June)**\n\n* Train to **Narita International Airport**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have some general queries:\n\n1. For the solo leg, will it be better to look for a **1-night Airbnb or explore Capsule Hotels**?\n2. For Kyoto, would you recommend a **2-night stay in a Ryokan**?\n3. How does luggage work on long-distance trains? **Should we travel light** or can we afford to keep some extra space (for shopping for instance)\n4. Any tips on **hiking** in the Tsubame Onsen / Sotaki Falls area (or the Japanese countryside in general) for a **first-time** hiker?\n5. We are Hindus from India, so my mother and sister are **vegetarians**. My father likes seafood while I can have poultry (barring beef). Any tips?\n6. Have kept some breathability in the Kyoto stretch for my parents since they are in their 50s and hence would **like some slow-paced travel** as well. Any other excursions or sights you would recommend?\n7. Any **Japanese phrases / Kanji basics** you would recommend learning prior? (have already memorized the Kanji for male and female haha)\n8. Any logistical knick-knacks you would recommend carrying that may be hard to come by? **Umbrellas? Power banks? Wall adapters?**\n9. Any recommendations for **buying good-quality art**? My primary preference would be the woodblock print style of Hokusai.\n\nANY FEEDBACK IS WELCOME! Thank you for reading!",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI think ryokan can be a challenge when you're a vegetarian (and I don't mean this as a slight, we're also vegetarian) and you just sometimes have to make compromises or go really in authentic where it's mostly just tatami floors and an old building vs. the meal part of it.  I would also say you need to decide the budget you want to spend.\n\nFor the Tsubame part of your trip, you might want to contact the Myoko tourist authority to get the bus schedule.\n\n[https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1436/#:\\~:text=Tsubame%20Onsen%20is%20accessible%20via,last%20stop%20at%20Tsubame%20Onsen](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1436/#:~:text=Tsubame%20Onsen%20is%20accessible%20via,last%20stop%20at%20Tsubame%20Onsen).\n\nThose are the general directions.\n\nI would split from your travel party when you leave Kawaguchiko, since it's not like you had plans to spend time in Kyoto.  It seems like a much longer trip to go all the way there from Kawaguchiko.  More than likely your parents and sister will take a bus from Kawaguchiko to Mishima and from there catch a shinkansen to Kyoto.  The buses and trains only run so frequent, so I would make sure you know when they run, if they do plan to stay in a ryokan, they will need to be at the ryokan for dinner, and I think that might be quite hard coming from Kawaguchiko.\n\nIn your case it makes more sense to either take a train from Otsuki up to Matsumoto and spend the night there or go back to Tokyo and take a train straight to Nagano.\n\nBTW if it doesn't have to be Tsubame, Shirahone onsen outside of Matsumoto is still quite rural and the bus schedule is more readily available.  You could also stay overnight at one of the ryokan in the Matsumoto area.\n\nSpeaking as someone who is older like your parents, your trip is not even close to slow paced at any point.  You are constantly moving from one location to another and I would either: cut Kyoto (and visit Kamakura instead) or cut Kawaguchiko since it's a much longer trip to Kyoto going to Kawaguchiko first.\n\nThe pirate ship, which I think personally sucks, is in Hakone on Ashiko (Lake Ashi)  It's a good 2 hours + from Kawaguchiko!  They're two completely separate and different areas.\n\nKawaguchiko is slightly closer to Mt. Fuji and tends to have more frequent views, but as you are going in June, all bets are off because the Summer months have some of the worst Mt Fuji viewing percentages.  Hakone has the pirate ship and the ropeway.  You can sometimes see Mt. Fuji from the pirate ship, I never have, but others have.  There are no guarantees and going in June makes it less likely, particularly if you're not going super early in the morning.\n\nIf you have been thinking of going to Hakone this whole time and not Kawaguchiko, that's a slightly easier stop off to Kyoto, jut be aware that all those sights are good 45 minutes+ from Odawara where the shinkansen stops.\n\nAnd for you, it makes even less sense to go all the way to Kyoto, since Odawara is much closer to Tokyo, and it makes more sense for you to backtrack and go onwards to Nagano directly.\n\nI am not sure why you would say in an AirBnB for 1 night in Nagano or Toyama or anywhere else in the Alps.  There are an awful lot of cleaning fees which are going to make it more expensive than a Business Class hotel.  Toyama and Nagano also don't really have a ton of capsule hotels because they're much smaller than Tokyo and Osaka.  You are much better off just staying in a cheap and convenient business hotel, which are plentiful.  As just an example, I've stayed in Nagano city multiple times.  With my daughter (who counts as an adult for booking purposes) I pay like $75-100 for a double and I am not picking the cheapest options either.  For a single, I would be surprised if you can't find something for under $50.\n\nGood luck!",

                    "comment": "Wow, thank you so much for your detailed input!\n\nA few points:\n\n1. We have planned for Hakone as a day trip while in Tokyo, and after spending the day at Ashiko in the Pirate Ship plan to return back to Tokyo. Do you think this is unwise? If so, what else would you suggest for a day trip outside of Tokyo city? Or perhaps other things in Hakone itself instead of the Pirate Ship?\n2. Your advice to continue towards Nagano from Kawaguchiko rather than going to Kyoto and continuing from there makes absolute sense. My original plan was to do what you have suggested, but I found the connectivity from Fuji area to Nagano a bit cumbersome as portrayed on Google Maps (backtracking to Tokyo, changing trains, being only partly covered by the JR Pass). Plus, the trip from Kyoto to Nagano via Toyama (on the Thunderbird + Shinkansen) seemed a bit more picturesque, straightforward and inexpensive (although admittedly a long detour). Would you still recommend I not go onward to Kyoto, and return through Tokyo toward Nagano?\n3. Shirahone Onsen, as suggested by you, seems quite enticing and I don't mind switching it up in place of Tsubame Onsen. With the latter, I was looking forward to getting in some hiking as well in the Northen Japanese Alps, and being off the beaten path (seeing as it was quite sequestered). Would you say I can find these things in Shirahone as well?\n4. Since I have also got Shirakawa-go Villages in my itinerary, then if I do opt for Shirahone, could I make it **Tokyo -&gt; Matsumoto (explore Shirahone Onsen) -&gt; Takayama / Toyama (explore Shirakawago)** over 2 days? For the first night, I could stay in a hotel in Matsumoto, and the second night in Toyama. Then, I could simply backtrack through Takayama -&gt; Matsumoto -&gt; Tokyo and regroup with my family. How does that sound?",

                            "comment": "Hmmm I thought I had responded to this but now I don't see my comment.  It was incredibly long and I am too tired to retype it all so I am going to try to summarize it as best I can.\n\nI would either cut out Kawaguchiko or cut Hakone.  You have 8 days, I think it is exhausting to try to do Tokyo, Hakone, Kawaguchiko and Kyoto in 8 days.  It's a lot of transit and traveling.  Even if I was 20 something, I would not want to do that much, just read some of the threads about all the people with aching feet.  It's also just exhausting spending days sitting on transit.  There are a lot of trains and buses you need to time for and, yes, there is a lot not covered by a rail pass.\n\nI am not sure you realize what is and what is not covered with a JR Pass.  For Hakone, anything past Odawara is not covered, for Kawaguchiko, anything past Otsuki.  Shirakawa Go is only accessible by not covered bus and the same is true for Tsubame or pretty much most rural areas you want to hike or visit an onsen.  The places where the bus is covered are the exception, not the rule.  \n\nThere is no reason to backtrack.  If you end at Toyama, you take the shinkansen from Toyama to Tokyo.  Please see the route of the Hokuriku shinkansen.\n\nNeither the Thunderbird or the Hokuriku shinkansen is particularly scenic.  They're great to get places, but they're not scenic.\n\nIf you want to hike, you need to give yourself time to hike.  Again, trains and buses in more rural areas run less often and tend to be slower.  I think your 2 day Alps trip sounds impossible.  Also Shirakawa Go is not a hiking destination at all.\n\nThere are 8 trains (4 locals and 4 expresses) between Toyama and Takayama.  They are all covered, but there are only 8 of them and sometimes they arrive close together.  It's a route you need to be 100% sure of the train time for, or you will be stuck somewhere.\n\nRural places tend to be accessible by non covered buses.  They also tend to have more limited public transit.  Unless you can find out the bus schedule ahead of time, I would not want to risk it.  Kamikochi and Shirahone have bus schedules in English and lots of hiking.  Just go to Japan Guide and look up Norikura Highlands or Kamikochi or visit the Kamikochi website.  Tsubame looks great, but I didn't see an English website, just Google translate translating a Japanese website.  Trying to go off the beaten path is a lot less fun when it means getting stuck somewhere.  \n\nIf you're using a rail pass, I don't know what you mean by inexpensive once a train is covered it doesn't matter what the cost is outside of time.\n\nGood luck!",

We actually can do only 8 days total and wanted to visit both Tokyo and Kyoto, hence the shorter durations. However, after Kyoto we return to Tokyo for one more day so that we have abt 4 days total here. Do you have any tips on how we can get the most out of Tokyo in 4 days?\n\n2. For which activities would you recommend getting tickets / bookings earlier? Does Pirate Ship need to be booked well in advance? A day, or a week??\n\n3.

    "postText": "Hi friends! Leaving tomorrow (ahh!!!) and can\u2019t thank this sub enough for all the helpful tips, suggestions and general knowledge provided. I\u2019ll be sure to post a report when I get back!!\n\nI had two last minute quick questions - \n\nThe bar at Shibuya Sky just opened like last week I think, so I\u2019m not sure if anyone knows the answer to this. I bought tickets to SS just before sunset and figured we\u2019d kill time at the bar while we waited. Didn\u2019t realize there was a separate ticket for the bar + admission\u2026 does anyone know if there\u2019s like standing options / take a drink not in the lounge area since I\u2019ve already purchased my ticket, or a way to add this on when there? It\u2019s most certainly not a deal breaker, I\u2019m just surprised it\u2019s not available to everyone who goes to the rooftop with admission? Since surely the real money maker is the super pricey drinks lol.\n\nSecond, my friend mentioned that years ago when he went to a baseball game in Japan it was customary to give \u201clittle gifts\u201d to people around you in the seats nearby? Is this true? I\u2019ve read a few \u201chow is Japanese baseball different than US\u201d sort of blog posts but saw no mention\u2026 just don\u2019t want to be rude. \n\nThanks again!",

They prioritise people that has the reservation but if there\u2019s availability they allow you to enter. The standing bar isn\u2019t timed at all. We went from sunset to sundown and it was nice. Beers were good but I liked the Magic Hour more. There are a lot of lines to take photos in the corner but in the drinking area there is one without much people and line which is great. There is also a selfie spot where you can do a timer if you wanted!",

Unfortunately the day we went there was a drizzle so when we arrived the roof was closed - they ended up actually reopening it right before we left, but the bar and seating area wasn\u2019t open so I\u2019m not sure how it is quite honestly. They won\u2019t refund you due to weather because there\u2019s still a panorama indoor area - although they did ask us before going up if we wanted to change our day free of charge (we didn\u2019t have another option to go, but that\u2019s nice of them I suppose.) \n\nIf the weather app says sunset is 7, I recommend booking for 6-6:15. The sky will begin to turn colors by 6:30-6:40. It does take some time in line to get up there. Even if it\u2019s cloudy like on a day we went, the city views from up there are jaw dropping at night so worth it no matter what!",

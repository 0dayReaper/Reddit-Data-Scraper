    "postText": "**Trip Report-  13 days Tokyo/Kyoto/Hakone/Nagoya (Ghibli Park) /Hiroshima with a 2 year-old toddler.   (plus day-trips to Nara and Osaka)**\r\n\nI love reading other peoples' trip reports and thought it might be useful  to share my experiences travelling with my wife and  toddler in Japan.     We used Shinkasens for most of our travel between cities but did rent a car  in the middle so that we could drive  to a rural Onsen and then to Shirakawa-Go from Nagoya.      (We also briefly rented a car to visit 3 plaaces around Hakone, too). \r  \nFirst of all, traveling with a toddler in japan is great. Our kid loves trains and busses and got tons of attention and shouts of \"KAWAI!!\"  from friendly people everywhere we went.  She even got a lullaby sung to her by a Japanese grandmother as she dozed on a city bus in Kyoto.   She never had to pay for any bus fares or train fares.  (technically she was a \"lap baby\" on the Shinkansens).  \n\n\r  \nWe read a book of etiquette before we went and it was very useful to know.  I am sure most of these tips are stickied elsewhere , but things like \"don't point with one finger,  always grasp cups with both hands, don't wipe your face/mouth with the hand-cloth, don't talk loudly in restaurants or on trains, keep yen bills neat and flat and use the trays provided when paying for things,\"  etc, were good to know before we went.  We brought and carried a \"point-and-say\"  translation book but only used it once; generally Google Translate worked great for images of menus and signs.  (and many restaurants have English versions of menus, or use digital menus on iPad that can switch to English. )     Google maps handled most of our navigation needs without issues too, both via train and car.   We parked the stroller outside most restaurants or folded it and brought it just inside the door if the weather was bad. \n\n\r  \n**Prep work -**\\-\r  \nThe only major prep work we did before leaving was to buy our JR pass and alert our banks  to the dates that we would be in Japan so that our credit and debit cards would work.  We had no problems getting cash from the ATM machines at 7-11 or at the Airport.    We reserved all hotels/AirBnB/Onsen/Car Rentals beforehand.   Also bought SkyTree tickets before departing. We stayed up until 4am to get a ticket to Ghibli's Grand Warehouse -- fortunately only one ticket was needed since our child was under 4 and my wife wasn't interested.     We rented a mobile hotspot  device from Sakura Mobile  before leaving America and it was waiting for us at our first hotel in Tokyo.  We dropped the hotspot and charger in a mailbox in a pre-paid envelope before leaving Kyoto.  \n\n  \r  \n**Major tips** \\-- no need to pack lots of snacks or water each day , since vending machines and 7-11 stores  and similar are ubiquitous.  Do pack paper towels/ Napkins and extra plastic bags for carrying wet diapers and trash, as public trash cans are almost non-existant. (and when they do exist, they are often just for aluminum and PET plastic bottles)   Throw away trash where you bought it, (for things like satay skewers) or bring it home to your hotel.   The \"pack-it-out\" mindset takes a little getting used to, but the results -- a society seemingly without litter-- are superb.     Having a lightweight , easily foldable stroller made this trip much easier.   Our child often slept in the stroller, and being able to quickly collapse and carry  it was key to getting up and down  the many sets of stairs in the train stations.   It also occasionally doubled as a luggage cart for us.  Packing light is key; we picked hotels and AirBnBs that had laundry options to allow us to carry a minimum of stuff.  (and no need to bring laundry soap; the washing machines dispense it automatically)   My wife wished she had a Japanese-style suitcase with 4 roller-wheels, but I think we did fine with our backpacks , etc. \n\n\r  \nIn general,  we didn't have much trouble finding things for my daughter to eat; she loves noodles and dumplings, and even got really into red snapper sushi one night.  (basically she loves anything she can dip in soy sauce).   Chicken Karage was usually an easy thing to find and feed to her, as were the egg salad Sandos,  fresh fruit, and various rice balls from 7-11.     Oddly, she also really loved the \"pickle-on-a-stick\" things that were pretty common in outdoor markets. (I think we got them in both Kyoto and  Osaka) \n\n\r  \n**Flights -** we flew JAL to from LAX to Narita outbound, and returned on JAL  (operated by AA) from Hiroshima to Haneda to  LAX.   The outbound flight was great; the JAL service was impeccable and they gave my child a model airplane which kept her occupied for hours.   We gate-checked our folding stroller on the outbound flight -- the gate clerk put into a plastic bag for us just before departure, \r  \nThe return flight (operated by American Airlines ) was a step down, but still fine.    Transferring planes at Haneda for the return was a little more of a hassle than we had expected becuase you have to exit one terminal, walk a while, exit the building and  then get on a free bus, and then go back  through security at another terminal.   On the plus side, the Haneda international terminal has a padded play area that my daughter liked near the duty free shops.   Becuase our return journey was two flights, gate-checking the stroller was not possible, but instead, after measuring its size, we were able to keep it as a carry-on for both legs.  (had it been larger,  JAL said they would have met us at  Haneda with an airport loaner stroller, something we saw other parents using in Hiroshinma and Haneda) \r  \nHighlights from each city (focusing on things that my child loved)\n\n\r  \n**Tokyo --** our first night in Japan was a little disorienting: the Tokyo metro station is like a gigantic multi-layer mall-labryinth, and since none of the maps seem to show the \"big picture\"  finding our way to the correct exit lugging luggage was a bit of a challenge the first time .  We went back down that night for our fist meal, and by the next day we were practically experts, and were even able to find our way to Ramen Street (on level B1)  for lunch and --after waiting in line for about 20 minutes-- slurp some great noodles.\n\n\r  \nOur first morning we wanted to visit the imperial Palace Gardens, but discovered it is closed on Mondays.  Stil, just seeing its moat and stone walls was impressive.   We walked to the Children's Science and Technology Museum near Budokan, and our duaghter loved operating cranes and turning cranks of giant Rube-Goldberg  machines.  (some with bowling-ball sized steel balls moving around).  Most of the exhibits were in Japanese, but the fact that this wasn't a common tourist destination made it interesting to visit.  On the way home for naps we ate at a random underground food court  under an office building and learned how to order a food ticket from a machine for eating at a restaraunt.  (a key skill!) \n\n\r  \nWe next headed up to the Owl Cafe in  Akihabara, mostly as an excuse to have a visit to Akhiabara, and found it was closed, but seeing the electronics stores  and nightlife of Akhihabara was fun.     As you might expect,    my daughter loved getting Gacha Balls from vending machines (both in Akihabara and everywhere else ) \n\n\r  \nOur second day we spent the morning hunting for the legendary \"Elephant Playground\" (worth the hunt!)  and then went to the nearby **Tokyo Childrens' Toy Museum**.  This was a fantastic combo, and I would recommend anyone with young kids in Tokyo do both.   From there we walked to  Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, which was a wonderful oaisis, full of picknicking families and couples.      We explored the tropical greenhouse and then  had a well-needed rest under a tree near a tea-house in the traditial japanese garden section   Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden also was conveniently close to the Shinjuku rail station, which was imporant because we had Sky-Tree tickets that evening, and we headed there directly.    We didn't have time to do any shopping or visit the two museums recommended to us near the skytree (Tobacco and Salt and the Tobu rail museum)  But we did have what I consider my favorite meal of the trip:  beers and gyoza and molten-lava hot takoyaki at a tiny( 6- seat) izakaya a few minutes south of the Skytree.  (i'd recommend it by name but it was completely in japanasese and I am not sure I can now accurately ID it)\n\n\r  \n\tThe third day we visted the Tusikiji outer fish market   -- we got there early and and it was  quickly full of tourists  and good food.  (many different kinds of grilled things on sticks, as well as raw oysters, etc) I was amazed that the public bathrooms there were sparkling clean -- as they were throughout almost the entire trip.      My daughter loved getting an  ice-cream drink at  John Lennon's favorite coffiee shop (Yonemoto).   On the way back thorugh Ginza we bought an enormous fig wrapped like the crown jewels from one of Japnan's famous fruit-gift stores.     It cost about $9, but was absoulutely delicious.   (it was crazy to see $200 watermelons  and $170 muskmellons in the same store) \r  \nWe also took this time in Ginza  to do one of the things on my bucket list -- buy an overpriced gift fruit from a fancy Japanese store.  We bought the second cheapest thing in there -   a single giant fig, and I think it cost about $9.  (totally worth it!) .  it was just fun to ogle $80 spherical watermelons,  and other beautiful, but incredibly expensive fruit. \r  \n\n\nLater that afternoon visited/saw Shibuya crossing, ate  decent and very inexpensive  sushi at a 3rd floor conveyor-belt restaurant, and went to Harjuku.  (not in that order)    Harajuku was chaotic fun,   but equally fun was the long peaceful forest walk to visit the **Meji Ginku** shrine that starts just outside Harjuki station .      By now we were experts at tossing coins, bowing, clapping, and praying in the appropriate cycle.  (something the 2 year old seemed to quite enjoy).    We also knew from our guidebook that we were supposed to walk only on the sides of the path at Meji Ginku -- the middle is reserved for the Gods.\n\n\r  \n**NAGOYA/GHIBLI**  \\- We took a direct bus from Nagoya station (cash accepted, Pasmo Cards also accepted) out to the sprawling expo grounds that surround the Ghibli exhibits.  Our 2.5 year old  loved  Studio Ghibli Parks Gand Warehouse,  particularly the miniature town where she could run around and pretend to drive  a train and serve beer at a drafthouse.  There was a furry Catbus to sit on, (of course) as well as another padded Catbus to jump around on for a few minutes with shoes off.   Totoro is the only Ghibli character she knows well, and she loved finding hidden Totoros and (and a giant  bar-tending one) around the Warehouse.   \r  \nArguably,  Ghibli park was a little disappointing for us  two adults , becuase it was pouring rain when we visited making the long walks between areas less than fun.  And despite having moved heaven and earth to get a timed ticket, there still were long lines  (\\~40 min) for areas inside the \"Grand Warehouse.\"   It was interesting for me to see the sketches and reference photos a used to make each cell of  Ghibli animation realisitic ... but it was annoying and crazy that most areas of the warehouse totally forbad taking  photographs.   Much of the rest of the Grand Warehouse was just lines for people to take selfies in front of recreated scenes from the movies for posting on social media. \n\n\r  \n We had  watched or re-watched  all the Ghibli movies prior to our trip,  so we were well prepared,  but overall I would say that if you can't get tickets to go to the Grand Warehouse, don't feel bad.   (There are many many more  magical and wonderful things everywhere else in Japan, and your 2 -year-old will love them just as much.  )\r  \n\r  \n**HAKONE/SHIRAKAWA-GO/ HIDA (Onsen)**\r  \nWe took a Shinkasen south from Tokyo to **Hakone,** and spent a day there with a family friend who showed us an ancient tea-house along the old imperial road,  a famous Shinto shrine, a deliicious meal, and of course, Mount Hakone with its black eggs, sulfurous fumes, and melty black ice cream.   The toddler loved the eggs and the ice cream, of course!  For me, sitting and eating tea and mochi in the deep forest  along the royal road was like being transported back into a historical Kurosawa film.   \n\n  If you visit Hakone,   I would encourage you to get into the woods and do some hiking.  It's a gorgeous area.  Apparently the japanese love to drink and tour Lake Ashi on a pair of pirate ships. which added a comic aspect to our visit to the much-photographed Hakone Shrine's Tori gate.\n\n\r  \nWe knew we wanted to visit the truly  rural areas of Honshu, so we  reserved a night at  a remote Onsen near Shirakawa-Go. The drive from Nagoya was stunningly beautiful,  traffic was light, and because we had rented a toll transponder along with the rental car, we could just breeze through the toll-booths (which are located at the off-ramps) .    Seeing the  untouched mountains coexisting with sleek new  road  tunnels and breathtaking shining bridges made me realize how  decrepit American infrastructure has become.   \n\n\r  \nIT was a bit stressful to drive on the left hand side of the road,  but conversely,    It was great to be able to pull over at will. For example, we could stop  at  at a small town outside of Nagoya  for a delicious prix fixe breakfast at \"cafe Pierrot\" and again later  to see and visit a beautiful riverside Shinto shrine along the road.  The car gave us the freedom  to and be able to just  stop and explore and  let our child play in the shallow water surrounded by green hills.       Driving in the rural areas wasn't too bad, and doing so let us see a whole other world that we would have missed had we stuck to the trains.   For example, we visited a delightful outdoor morning market in the village of  **Miyagawa** and bought fresh produce and some delightful snacks  (including fish-shaped custard-filled mini-donuts) from the vendors followed by an impromptu picnic along the riverbank.\n\n\r  \n  On this portion of the trip we also got to experience the Japan's wonderful rest-stop cuisine -- you use a ticket machine to select some items, hand them to a chef behind the counter, and in a few minutes  your number is  called . We had some delicious Japanese pizza  (shaped like a elongated, puffy taco ) fragrant beef curry, and a \"Miso Katsu\" dish too.\n\n\r  \nLater we would stop at another rest stop and discover that it had an absolutely epic set of slides and tunnels built into the hillside.  You borrow a plastic sled and then slide about 150 feet down a green carpet.   It was hearwarming to see  how kind and welcoming the japanese children were to our daughter, helping her to slide and showing her how to play and explore the tunnels.  Arguably this was my child's favorite part of the entire trip. \n\n\r  \n**Shirakawa Go** was great fun for the whole family --  it was definately touristy, but it was great to be able to stroll and relax and learn about Japan's past.  (Parking closes at 5pm, though!)     We had only a few hours there but I think we would have enjoyed an entire day of strolling and snacking and learning.  Interestingly all the parking attendents there seem to be senior citizens.   \r  \nOur Ondsen was in a small farming comunity outside Hida,   surrounded by orchards, mountains, and rice paddies.  We were the only non-japanese that we saw there,  and it was a little challenging to keep our toddler ccorralled during the formal meals (served in a common area, not in our  rooms).       As expected,  the  indoor slippers provided were a bit small for my size-11 feet,  but we had a great time in a beautiful, secluded place.   \n\n\r  \n Staying overnight got us a ticket to also visit the large and well-maintained municipal baths just up the road. (each side of which had about 7 pools of various temperatures and medicinal properties)   There was a wonderful hiking trail that looped through the deep forest around the town.  One of my biggest regrets of the trip is that we did not have more time to hike and explore these lush, pristine mountain woods --  I think I enjoyed our hikes here as much as I did the onsen baths.   \r  \nThe driving portion of our trip ended on the western coast of Honshu, at Kanazawa, but we didn't see much of that city other than a gas station and the rental car return before taking  the \"thunderbird\" train down to Kyoto.    (not quite as fast as some shinkasen, but very comfortable). \r  \n\r  \n**KYOTO and day-trips:**\r  \nWe had three delightful days in Kyoto, along including day trips by rail to **Osaka** (to see the market, eat okinomiyaki,  and climb Osaka Castle) and **Nara** (to walk aound and feed the deer in the park and then the  koi at a a beautiful botanical garden, stroll through another  temple, and  to eat the best Udon noodles of the trip while siting outdoors in the forest.  In Nara, we also stumbled upon a wonderful Beatles-only vintage record shop called \"B-Sels\"  on an upper floor just across from Nara station, and listened to a street performance of Shamisen music at the station itself.     Nara, like Shirakawa-Go, was full of busloads of  tourists, but that didn't make it any less of a great experience for us.   \r  \nKyoto itself  was wonderful to explore on foot -- I won't go into exhaustive detail, but our child loved walking and being pushed in the stroller  to various Temples and loved the view from Kyoto tower.  (and the Gatcha ball souvenir tower even more!) .  She liked  the path through the bamboo forest (crowded with tourists)  and loved \"hiking\" through the beautiful and less crowded gardens of **Tenryu-Ji** temple  -- part of which has remained unchanged since the 14th century.     We skipped the monkey park. \n\n\r  \nIn Kyoto proper,  we walked through **Chion-In** Buddhist temple , took our shoes off and bagged them,  and observed a ceremony -- it was interesting to see how similar it was to ceremonies in America,  with the same  incense, syllable recitation, and wood-block time-keeping interspersed with bowl-gong ringing .... but on a much grander scale. The size of the wooden  buildings is epic,  rivaling the stone cathedrals of Europe.  Because of the large numbers of steps to get from the massive Sanmon gate to the main building of the shrine,  my wife and I took turns exploring and let the toddler play along the paths of the temple's small tea-garden next door. \r  \n \r  \n**Hiroshima-** \r  \nFinally, we spent the last two days of our trip in Hiroshima.   It was shocking and surreal to get off the train underground and suddenly be hit with an overwhelming smell of burning -- there was construction work all around Hiroshima station  and I don't know if it was from digging pylons down into subterranean ashes, or just from some other more modern aspect of the construction  As someone whose worldview was shaped  by reading  Barefoot Gen as a child,  visiting Hiroshima was an important and somber part of our trip.\r  \n\n\nIt was interesting to see that the bulk of the visitors to the Peace Museum  visitors seemed to be Japanese school groups.    Of course, most of the photos and exhibits museum went \"over the head\" of our 2/yo child.  (she wasn't frightened, just not interested).      She did enjoy ringing the peace Bell outside and seeing the collections of paper cranes.  We bought books to help share the experience with her again once she is older. \n\n\r  \n In any event, Hiroshima is a charming city showing no outward signs of being  apocalyptically devastated (except at the Peace Memorial Dome) and there is an excellent restaurant district just around the corner from the main train  station, with many small restaurants that are open late.    \r  \nThe people and proprietors  of Hiroshima seemed particularly kind to us;  it's  more relaxed there  than any of the other cities we viisted.    Our chid loved was the \"Children's 5-day Science  Museum\" about a quater mile away from Peace Park that has  a lot of hands-on exhibits and two stories of climbing tunnels.  We did *not* do the planetarium there,  as it is in japanese-language  only  and we had limited time. \n\n\r  \nFor us, the highlight of our time in Hiroshima was taking the  long ferry to Miyajima directly from Peace Park and then wandering around the narrow streets of Miyajima in the afternoon and evening.    It was great to see the oyster beds being worked  from the ferry and then later dine on delicious grilled and fried Miyajima oysters. \n\n\r  \nOur child loved the ferry rides and wandering around  Miyajima  (there are deer there too)   but she also slept for much of our time on the island. The return ferry was part of the JR rail network and so we could use our JR passes for that.  (its a short, straighter route).    \n\n\r  \nAll in all,  Japan was very kid friendly, as long as  you can quickly and easily fold up your stroller, and we loved our time in every city we visited.  (and could have easily spent much more time in any of them). \r  \n\r  \n**Other Thoughts:**  We bought the Japan Rail Pass, but probably didn't save much money by doing so;  My wife estimates that we about broke even with the number of shinkansen, trains, and ferry-rides we used.   It was a nice security blanket, though, to know that if we missed a train it wouldn't cost us anything. (but we never missed any trains) .       For non JR-line trains, we used a pair of \"PASMO\" cards.   Pasmo cards can also be used at other random retail places as a stored-cash card.    When you go through the gates, you must look for ones that say \"IC\" if you are using a Pasmo card and tap against the NFC pad with it.  Using Pasmo is nice because the card is durable (unlike the paper JR Pass) and you can load up enough money for multiple trips on the card. \n\n\r  \nWe use T-mobile, and our plan included 5 GB of \"high speed data\" while in japan but we weren't sure we would have good service for our rural drive, so we gout a WiFi hotspot from Sakura Mobile.  This worked fine -- and its speeds was always faster than T-Mobile's coverage when tested.  The hotspot generally  would last about 20 hours on one charge.   But honestly T-Mobile's Japan coverage was probably good enough that the hotspot was an unnecessary expense; we often used it instead of the hotspot and  only came close to the 5GB limit on our last day.   If I were on a tighter budget,  a shorter trip, or knew I wouldn't be in remote areas, I would skip the Hotspot and just use T-mobile.\r  \n\r  \n**TLDR:**    Tokyo Toy Museum is fantastic for little ones.  Ghibli Park (Grand Warehouse) is fine, but  our kid probably had just as much fun on many other Japanese playgrounds.  If you do choose to drive, don't miss the Japanese rest stops which can be fantastic with fresh food and jungle gyms and slides.   Our kid may remember little from the trip except the toys she took home from GATCHA balls,  but we have a lifetime of memories gained.  Don't miss the Udon in Nara at \"Mizuya Chaya\",  just outside the beautiful Manyo Botanical Gardens. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n***links:***\r  \n**ELEPHANT PLAYGROUND:**\r  \nhttps://www.thetokyochapter.com/tokyos-retro-playgrounds/\r  \n**RAMEN STREET:**\r  \nhttps://tokyocheapo.com/food-and-drink/ramen/tokyo-ramen-street/\r  \n**Miyagawa Morning Market:**\r  \nhttps://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1255/\r  \n**Udon at Mizuya Chaya in Nara**:\r  \nhttps://www.visitnara.jp/venues/D01057/",

We tried to order enough different kinds of food that there was always stuff she would eat. (She doesn't love seafood, but weirdly went for red snapper sushi with gusto).   Fortunately she loves noodles and rice and gyoza, and she loves sipping soup,  and those 4 things are very easy to find.   And chicken karage is very common too. \n\n  We did have to make sure we got enough vegetables and fruits for her by specifically  shopping at stores and markets; there just typically wasn't a lot of fruit or salads on the menus in the cafes and restaurants/ tea houses  we went to.\n\nWe really  wanted to do hotpot or shabu shabu but never got the chance.   (I guess it might be a little hazardous, depending on the layout) but it would have been fun! \n\nWe did do okinomiyaki and she loved watching the food being prepared in front of us.\n\n\nRegarding the plane flight - we got lucky and she did really well both times.   JAL economy class feels like first class.   The big bathrooms made changing diapers easy.  Since she was over 2 she had to have her own seat, which gave the three of us plenty of room. We brought an ipad and some over the ear headphones for her and as a special treat  let her watch cartoons that we had downloaded.  (Note that some streaming services limit how long your downloads last offline, so you may need to re-download before going home)   we also had plenty of small  toys and lightweight  books, of course.  We were allowed to board early for all legs of the journey.\n\nThe return flight actually had a Raffi/kids music  channel on the built-in entertainment system, which we listened to together by starting the stream simultaneously. (She was laughing out loud listening to it)  I  might have been easier to get a headphone splitter jack beforehand to do the same thing.\n\nShe did have a ~10 min meltdown on one of the shinkasen legs, (she needed a nap) but we had food and toys, and eventually got her distracted. \n\nSpeaking of shinkasens, be sure you get up and  get all your stuff ready to hop off~ 3 min before your stop; they don't stop for long and it can definitely  be stressful to juggle baby, stroller, and luggage in that short timeframe. All went well for us, but it would be bad to be caught by surprise and have to race for the exit.",

(gardens are often much more stroll-able) \n\n Oh that reminds me -- she did have a big meltdown in Kyoto at dusk, halfway up Mount Inari (the Fox Shrine) , so I had to jog her miles down the  mountain as she screamed her head off.

She tends to cry just before she goes to sleep, ( we call it the \"storm before the calm\" ) -- and she in fact went to sleep when I got her back to her stroller and her comfort blanket.   So be sure to bring something like that that can be used to shade them in the sun and warm them at night and comfort them whenever.  (But don't lose it at the airport checkpoint like we did,.LOL) she actually doesn't  use a comfort item at home, but while traveling it became really important to her.\n\n\nI*m sure you can find food for your little one, even if they are picky.  Our Tokyo  hotel actually had chicken nuggets at breakfast, and the 7-11s that are in every corner have a huge variety of prepared foods, including various kinds of chicken-on-sticks, and really tasty egg salad sandwiches. \n\nHopefully the novelty of everything will keep him  entranced. (Actually that occasionally a problem for us: , sometimes our daughter would be so busy staring at the sights and sounds and the  people around us that she would be distracted from eating herself)\n\n \nOne final idea to Pass on: our child really liked having a fuzzy backpack of their own to carry small toys. We got her one from Amazon with a stuffed animal on the back, a giraffe that is itself a zippered pouch. She spent countless hours on the planes and trains putting toys from the animal into the giraffe, putting the giraffe itself  into the backpack, etc.  At age 2 it's all about \"doing things for themselves\" and having a backpack of their own is perfect for that.",

(Someone else may be more of an expert, but that is my understanding)   -- it has to do with FAA rules about emergency plane evacuations , I think.\n\nWe did not bring one with us on this trip.   You can put them in a carrier bag and check them for free (sometimes it comes out as \"oversized luggage\" -- at a separate carosel at baggage claim.).\n\n I would hate to lug one around and am very very glad we didn't have to.\n\n As I said, we did not bring one with us. Instead,  We made sure that when we reserved our cars,  the rental agency (\"Times\") said they would have one available for our use.  This worked perfectly for one rental, Unfortunately for the other car rental the agency had provided a infant-sized car seat, and when we realized it was too small, the only other option on hand was a booster seat.  So we used the booster seat for that one day.  (Not ideal).\n\nSo if you plan to rent a car, make sure they can provide a properly-sized car seat.\n\n\nEdit: looks likes JAL [can provide car seats for the plane  if you asked them in advance](https://www.jal.co.jp/jp/en/inter/support/baby/child-seat.html) , but   we just buckled our 2.5 year old in.",

(Both were similar types of places).  \n\nDefinitely park your stroller outside and carry your kid so they know you aren't trying to foolishly bring a big stroller into a crowded place.\n\n We tried to pick places that had booths or bench seats,  but where that wasn't possible she still did fine.  We got brought a high chair by our server  maybe 3 or 4 times over the course of the trip,  but mostly she just ate wherever we thought looked good, even if it meant holding her our laps. (Having two parents is key, so you can pass her back and forth)\n\nI forgot to mention: for  one of our meals in Tokyo we went randomly went into a  \"Johnathan's\" restaurant for breakfast (it's a chain like Denny's)  and were amazed when two \"cat-robots\" brought us our food. (Which she Loved!).  \n\n\n  At least twice she fell asleep during dinner,  so we just laid her down beside us  until we finished our meal and then poured her into the stroller once we got outside.  \n\n   Obviously with a toddler sometimes it isn't wise to wait in line too long for a table if you don't have snacks in your bag to placate them, so when we went to Ramen Street we picked one of the places with a relatively short (3 person ) line.  \n\n\nBut in general, at small restaurants of every genre  we felt very welcomed.  (Sushi , Ramen, Thai, Vietnamese, Crepes, Izakayas, diners, etc). We never went anyplace super fancy or expensive  but we ate amazingly well.    \n\n\nWe tried to teach her to use chopsticks before going with partial success and  she actually does well with Asian-style soup spoons. We always carried small plastic utensils (a fork and spoon) just in case, but we wound up only needing to use our own kids-sized utensils once or twice. Fortunately, most restaurants,-- even when  they didn't have a high chair--- did have an unbreakable plastic cup for her to drink from, and many brought out to us kids -sized forks \n\nOf course, we wound up feeding her from our chopsticks a lot of the time.",

                    "comment": "I would recommend all the hotels we stayed in.  Service was impeccable and rooms were very nice.    (honestly, most were larger than we expected, particularly the hotel in Kyoto above the train station).      We used points and found deals,  so that brought the cost down.   I think --if I am remembering correctly -- that every place we stayed had a giant bath tub, which was great for soaking after walking all those miles each day.   And the Japanese seem to generally use laminar-flow spigots that fill those giant tubs in seconds. \n\n **Hotel Metropolitan Tokyo Marunouchi**   \\-- this hotel is on the top 8 floors (starting at floor 27, I think) of an office building, right outside one of the many Tokyo Station\r  \n exits.  Has an epic breakfast buffet for guests at the hotel's restaurant on the 27th floor (half Japanese food, half other gourmet items) . We could see the Tokyo Skytree  a few miles away from our corner room.  Our kid loved looking down at all the excavators working next door, and also staring at the model train setup in the lobby.     Luxurious hotel,  with japanese-style pajamas provided each night.     Room seemed about the size of some hotels in NYC. (compact but with great views)  \n\n\r  \n**Daiwa Roynet Hotel Nagoya** (Taikodori Side in Nagoya)   -- this hotel was definitely less fancy, but we had no complaints.    It's part of  a Vietnamese chain so the breakfast \r  \nbuffet was actually mostly Vietnamese.   ( I could be wrong but that was my impression) \n\n\r  \n**Hotel Kikori in Hida**  \\- -this was the remote Onsen we stayed at.   No English was spoken there, so we relied on Google Translate.  We wanted a traditional but affordable experience and we got it; tatamis in every  room, multi-course dinner served on low tables,   There are are two onsens on site (one for men, one for women, swapped daily) but you get a ticket at the front desk for use of the municipal onsen up the street which has about 7 pools  (bring your own towels) This whole area is looped by a wonderful hiking trail through a forest that seems primeval.     Food was a set meal that included many local herbs and produce. We paid extra to get some additional items.  I didn't love all of the dishes of the two meals we had there , but it was all about the experience.     I would recommend this place,  but I suspect there are other even better options out there that are more family-friendly.  The meals here  were the only point on the trip where I was worried that my child might be getting close to disturbing the peace of other guests.  (there were at least few other children in the hotel but we didn't see any at the formal dinner or breakfast)    The hiking trail and municipal Onsen are both pretty great, though!\n\n**Hotel Granvia, Kyoto** \\-- this was a luxury hotel that is actually built into one end of Kyoto station itself.  (just walk past the JR Rail ticket office)     I would highly recommend it; the rooms were huge and the service was fantastic, and the views are either of the beautiful modern station or of the Tokyo Tower (depending which side you are on).   Weirdly it wasn't that expensive.   We wound up staying there last minute because we needed get an early start one morning and we wanted to have our luggage stored next to the train station all day so we would not have to bring it with us.  Because we had stayed at the hotel they held our luggage for us all that day.    The service is so good you will feel awkward not tipping, but that will just make everyone feel awkward. So don't tip!  \n\nWe also stayed in an Air BnB two nights in Kyoto -- it was fine but I wouldn't  wholeheartedly recommend because the laundry was awkward to use and there was a mold-smell in the hallway.  (not in the room itself, thankfully!). \n\n **The Royal Park Hotel Hiroshima Riverside. Hiroshima**   \\-- This was an easy walk from Hiroshima station, (just across the river)  and also was convenient to multiple restaurant districts.   Breakfast on-site was a low-key  Japanese buffet.   Fairly small room, (the kind with a window from the main area to the bathroom)  but,  as usual, a giant tub.   We walked from there to the peace memorial.    Not a fancy place, but I would recommend it without any caveats. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sleeping Arrangements:** \n\nOur child typically sleeps in a crib at home but for the trip we just made sure each room had either a king or queen sized bed and put her in the middle of it with us.  We were all so tired each day that we slept great. (but now that we are home it's hard to get  back on schedule, LOL)       \n\nThere definitely would *not* have been room for a pack-n-play at our room at the Tokyo hotel or at the Nagoya hotel or at the Hiroshima hotel, at least not in the rooms we were placed in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!",

If you wish to reserve a crib, please make a note on your reservation in the comments section when booking. Please understand in advance that we have a limited number of cribs at each facility.\u201d So definitely check with them beforehand.\n\nETA: I booked with booking.com and during checkout, there\u2019s an option to request a crib.",

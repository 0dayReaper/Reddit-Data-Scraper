Time permitting, you should also explore Omeide Yokocho on Day 2.\n\nAlso Day 3, to fit in morning possibly visiting Starbucks Reserve which is one of thr largest Starbucks in the world! \n\nI am a bit indifferent about Harajuku shopping. I heard what makes this street cool is long gone. What are you buying? Not sure if Uniqlo flagship store interest you more in Ginza or other shopping district.",

We checked out the bamboo forest area, then went to the Golden Pavilion. There are other things to do in the Arashiyama area - boat ride, monkey park etc.... But, not something we wanted to do. \n\nNara - again, depends on your interest. We did the Fushimi Inari early morning - as in, we were back down the loop by 830 AM. Then took the JR Train to the Nara, walked around and checked out the temple. Then back in Kyoto by 130 PM or so, which gave us time to hit up the Nishiki market and the stall. Personally, to me, Nara is well worth it...but then again, it is an individual choice.",

One of which is handwritten specifically.\n\nThe handwritten one can only be obtained between 8:30 - 16:00\n\nSo I think for goshuins starting a little later (but still early) is best, since lines may be longer as it gets more crowded.\n\nThere's a map on the official Inari site (second link), with the location of the shrines.\n\n***\n\nAs for a recommended route, sadly I don't. Since I never collected goshuins (and wondering if I should on my next visit) before, so I'm not sure which spots offered them",

Unless your Day 3 shopping isn't a lot and won't increase your luggage size.\n\nWe went there last month with almost similar itinerary but putting shopping at last section of the itinerary. We went from 1 luggage per person to 2 luggage per person.",

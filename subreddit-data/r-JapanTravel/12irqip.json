    "postText": "I am doing the Golden Route in Japan next month via Hakone and looking to see what I could realistically slot in to my first afternoon/evening in Kyoto. I'm concerned my Kyoto leg is already stacked (thoughts appreciated?) so it would be killing two birds with one stone if I was able to comfortably move something to do after arriving in Kyoto.\n\nI have both a JR pass and a Hakone Free Pass. I am also travelling with only a carry on back pack so moving around is pretty simple.\n\nMy hotels are:  \nHakone - Right by Gora station  \nKyoto - Right by Nishiki Market\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. What is my best option to get from Hakone to Kyoto?\n2. How much time do I realistically have after the train journey from Hakone and what could be added as a pleasant evening activity?\n3. Are there any suggestions on the rest of my Kyoto itinerary?\n\nAt the moment, my itinerary for that period of my journey is:\n\n**Monday**\n\n* Wake up at hotel right by Gora station\n* Travel to Kyoto\n* **Open plans for however long is realistically left of this day**\n\n**Tuesday**\n\n* Early morning to Nara for morning and lunch \n* Visit Uji on train back for afternoon \n\n**Wednesday:**\n\n* Kiyomizu-dera\n* Nishiki Market\n* Higashiyama\n* Hokan-ji\n* Kenninji\n* Kodaji\n* Walk around Gion\n\n**Thursday**\n\n* Arashiyama - Tenryuji and Togetsukyo Bridge\n* Kinkakuji\n* Ryoanji\n* Ninnaji\n\n**Friday**\n\n* Fushimi Inari\n* Travel on to Osaka\n* Osaka castle\n* Walk via Tsutsenkaku \n* Shinsekai for food",

            "comment": "1. train/bus to Odawara station, then Shinkansen to Kyoto. I would aim to catch the 10:07 Hikari (covered by JR Pass) which requires leaving the hotel at 9am - ryokan breakfast starts around 7/7:30 so this should be enough time.\n\n2. If you catch the aforementioned 10:07 train you'll arrive at Kyoto station at 12:12pm, probably 1pm by the time you get to hotel and drop off the bag (early check in is not really a thing in Japan) which leaves the entire afternoon and evening free.\n\n3. Shift Nishiki Market (= lunch), at least one of Kodaiji/Kenninji/Hokanji/\"Higashiyama\", and \"walk around Gion\" to Monday afternoon and evening.\n\n&gt; other suggestions\n\n* Doing both Nara and Uji in the same day is tight unless you get a very early start. May I suggest one of the two paired with Fushimi Inari instead (moved from Friday). The reason is because Fushimi Inari is 24/7 which facilitates getting an early start or late finish thus lengthening the available touring day, whereas the others are somewhat confined by temple opening hours (9-5). Then move whichever you didn't do to Friday.\n\n* Wednesday is also a prime day for an early start because Kiyomizudera opens very early and is vastly more peaceful before 8am. By the time you finish Kiyomizudera and walk down the streets the other temples should be open by 9.",

                    "comment": "Thanks so much for your clear response. I've plugged that 10:07 train into the Jorudan app and can see it now. It is so much shorter than I was expecting after testing trips on Google.\n\nI did originally have Fushimi Inari paired with one of the Nara/Uji visits, however I was told moving it to before the Osaka train would work as I could get a really early start for it and that means when I got to Osaka, I'd have time for Osaka Castle and the other things I've listed above.Is your suggestion to do (for example) Friday morning as a half day to Uji and then on to Osaka afterwards? If so, is there ample time still afterwards for the other things I've planned?",

                            "comment": "The reason for pairing Fushimi Inari/Nara rather than Uji/Nara is that I think Uji (and Nara) deserve more time, and both have the constraint that temples/shrines basically only operate 9-5pm which limits sightseeing time. They are also 45 minutes apart (after factoring in the bus from JR Nara to Nara Park). \n\nIn contrast, Fushimi Inari has a lot more flexibility in terms of when you can start and end, and you have a choice whether to hike to the top or turn around after a bit of walking in the torii gates. \n\nTsutenkaku and Shinsekai are as interesting at night as it is during the day, which gives you a lot of flexibility. For example: \n\n* 8-8:30am leave hotel\n\n* Arrive at Byodo-in in Uji an hour later\n\n* Wander around Uji (Byodo-in, walk along river, Uji shrine, eat matcha ice cream etc.) until 1 or 2pm\n\n* Take Keihan to Tenmabashi station (~1 hour), go inside castle if you like (closes at 5pm), castle grounds are 24/7\n\n* Go to Tsutenkaku (closes at 8pm)",

Based on where I'm based in Kyoto, I actually looked and thought that Kyoto Imperial Palace might be realistic after dropping my bags off on the Monday after the Hikari shinkansen you suggested.\n\nGoogle Maps suggests a 20 minute walk from Nishiki Market therefore I am thinking:\n\n* Arrive Kyoto Station 12:12\n* Travel to hotel by Nishiki Market and check-in (say 1pm)\n* Nishiki Market for lunch (until 2pm)\n* Kyoto Imperial Palace\n* Then onwards into evening potentially visiting Yasaka shrine (mentioned as nice at night time) and a loose Gion exploration\n\nAnd allows me to keep the rest of the itinerary as is?\n\nThe sites I haven't currently allowed for are Nijo Castle and doing the Philosophers Path in full. The latter I was interested in as I am hoping to collect stamps for a Goshuincho which I read this would be good for?\n\nRe the Uji suggestion - looks good, thank you. I have adjusted to have this on the Friday morning and then early afternoon travel on to Osaka - no rush as I can visit the grounds 24/7 as you say if the day has gone on longer than originally estimated.",

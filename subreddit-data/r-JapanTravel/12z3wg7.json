    "postText": "My wife and I (Malaysians) are currently in Tokyo and will be visiting Sado Island in 3 days time. We initially planned to drive around Sado island but have forgotten to request an international driving permit prior to leaving for Japan. \n\nIs it possible to drive in Japan/Sado Island without requiring an international driving license - we only have Malaysian driving license which has English and malay translations? I also have an Irish driving license but am not a current resident there. \n\nThank you!",

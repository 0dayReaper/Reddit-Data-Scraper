Either bring some lunch with you or an early lunch at Gora. \n\nTrust me, the bus back to Odawara station will take at least 1 hour. And the busses only go every maybe 30 minutes. Allowing time for all that, you looking at around 1.5hrs for the bus back to Odawara station. I know because we had to wait around for 45 minutes because we were standing at the wrong bloody stop and the bus just went past! So had to wait another 30 minutes to catch the next one. Also, there are two bus line, if you catch the wrong one, you\u2019ll end up somewhere else. Because of all this, be prepared to have dinner somewhere else. I\u2019m not sure what time your hotel will take the last order.\n\nIf you can, try going to Shibuya sky instead of Tokyo sky tree. It\u2019s a better experience in my opinion and you can book tickets in advance for a preferred time.\n\nOne last advice is be prepared for plans to change. We had to change plans last minute, because the day we were going to hakone (mainly to see Fuji) it was raining so had to change plans and go on a sunny day instead. \n\nRemember to Just relax and have fun. If you find some place you like, spend a bit more time there than you originally planned. You\u2019ll remember that experience more than just rushing to the next spot. \n\nHave fun!",

One of them serves ramen with the black eggs along with other standard dishes like tempura and cutlets I think. It's the 3rd building out. First is the station, second is the shop you can buy black eggs, and the last building has a restaurant in it. \n\nThe station also has a curry/udon restaurant in it as well.

Most should be sick of shrines/temples even with this anyways.\n\nBasically start at kita-kamakura, check out engaku-ji, take the hiking trail to the daibutsu, head down to the rail station and either walk on the beach or take the train back to kamakura station. you can check out the touristy shops there or just head to yokohama at that point. \n\nYou can basically start this route early in the morning at like 8AM. You should be done with Kamakura before noon which means you can eat in either Kamakura or somewhere in Yokohama (Chinatown is great). Yes you will miss things but if you you have limited time, fitting in parts of Yokohama might be more desirable. \n\nYou can make advance reservations for the Cup of noodles museum which is helpful. I don't think the shin-yokohama ramen museum is worth it as its out of the way and you can get good ramen just about anywhere. \n\nCan't comment on nightlife, I usually turn in early.",

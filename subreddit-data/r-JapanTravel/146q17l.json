    "postText": "As we all know the coming changes to JR Pass will likely make the nationwide pass obsolete for all, but the most cunning (or very niche) visitors - we foresee changes to the way people approach to Japan with increasing focus on staying in the cities, which enable them to make a full use of regional passes, or to take advantage of many day trips.\n\nWe'd like you to share your ideas for using those hubs to the fullest for short-term and medium-term tourism-related stays, including your ideas for itineraries, day trips, eating out, entertainment and just having a general fun all around.\n\nToday we'd like to discuss Nagoya, which is the largest city in Tokai region in Japan and also a major transport and industrial hub, connected with Tokyo and Kansai region by shinkansen. **Chubu Centrair International Airport** might be a way in for international visitors looking to jump straight in.\n\n|**Info Panel**|**Nagoya**|\n|:--|:--|\n| Main transport hub | Nagoya (JR, Kintetsu, Meitetsu subway, bus terminal) |\n| Airport | Chubu Centrair International Airport (direct train, limousine buses) |\n| Entertainment district | Sakae |\n| IC card | toica (major), manaca (major) |\n| Peak season | August, October | \n| Day trip destinations | Inuyama, Kiso Valley, Ise shrines, Gero Onsen |\n\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

            "comment": "I'm currently in Nagoya, leaving tomorrow. As a city itself, there's definitely less to do here in the way of big sightseeing things, compared to Osaka or Tokyo. It has a reputation as being 'the most boring city in Japan'. Its history as an important domain of the shoguns means there are some historical things to see, but not many. The reconstructed castle is currently off-limits, being demolished and rebuilt soon, and is perhaps less interesting than other castles to visit. There is a science museum with one of the world's largest planetariums, as well as a Toyota museum and a train museum. There's also a Lego theme park and a Ghibli theme park (half completed, requires reserving tickets far in advance). But apart from sightseeing, what Nagoya is really good for as a city is food, shopping and avoiding touristy crowds. It's probably a good city to visit as a family, considering the theme parks and generally quieter streets. Misokatsu is amazing, as is Ogura Toast, Hitsumabushi, Misonikomi udon and the karaage, and there are so many nice restaurants and malls to go to. It's a relaxing and convenient place, just a little dull.\n\nSide trips from Nagoya into Gifu and the Japanese alps are relatively easy, if you were looking for more historical sightseeing. It's about two hours into Magome and walking the Nakasendo trail, which is well worthwhile. It's about 2-3 hours to Takayama and Shirakawa-go as well. Sekigahara isn't far away either, and has an amazing museum with a 4D film about the battle.",

With that said, Nagoya isn\u2019t an ideal base for heavy users of the JR Pass (including regional ones) as most of the attractions in the Tokai and Chubu regions aren\u2019t covered by JR lines.",

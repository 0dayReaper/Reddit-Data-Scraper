    "postText": "Hello everybody! I've been reading everyone's posts on this subreddit, and it's given me invaluable info! It will be my 1st solo trip exploring Japan from late May to late June this year. I've never been to Hiroshima or Miyajima before so I have a quick question regarding luggage storage. I plan on being on the 1st shinkansen from Tokyo to Hiroshima to spend around 2 hours around the Peace Memorial Museum area before taking the direct ferry to Miyajima in time for low tide and staying the evening on the island. Unfortunately, I'm going to be one-bagging everything, but will have a day bag available. My plan is to leave the larger bag somewhere and only take essentials and a set of clean clothes with me to Miyajima for the evening and next day. Does anyone know the best way about this? I know it sounds inappropriate, but does Hiroshima station allow lockers to be rented overnight? Hopefully this post doesn't break Rule #4.",

I'd expect it to be busier than normal because of that.",

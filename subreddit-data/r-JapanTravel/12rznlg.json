    "postText": "Hello! Long time lurker of the sub, finally going to Japan in September!! Trip will be shorter than expected so I wanted to stay in Tokyo, and do day trips from there. The itinerary is not completely done, so bear that in mind. Also doesn't include many restaurants as I'm not a fan of lines so I thought it would be better to go with the flow when I'm there. Any recommendations would still be greatly appreciated though!:)\n\nI am not buying a JR pass and plan to use a virtual Suica card. Please let me know if the Suica card doesn't cover any trips listed. Transit is one of my bigger worries (especially for the Hakone trip) so any help is very much appreciated (more details on Day 6)\n\nLast note: I am on a slight budget, plan to splurge on certain things here and there but nothing crazy. After flight and accommodations, the estimated spending money for each person (2 of us) is \\~1,000 dollars for transit, food, and shopping\n\n**DAY 0**\n\n* 3pm arrive at Narita-&gt; Skyliner to Tokyo\n* Get cash from ATM or 7-11\n* Check-in at hotel in Asakusa\n* Explore if not tired (12 hour time difference so I expect some jet lag)\n\n**DAY 1**\n\n* Explore around neighbourhood\n* See Sensoji temple at day and night (my hotel is very close :)!!)\n* More to be added\n\n**DAY 2**\n\n* Akihabara\n* Shibuya\n   * Yoyogi park, Shibuya crossing, Takeshita street, Megura river?\n* Shinjuku\n   * Omoide Yokocho\n   * Kabukicho\n   * Tokyo Metropolitan building\n* Extra: Gotokuji temple\n\n**DAY 3: Day trip to KAMAKURA/ENOSHIMA ISLAND**\n\n* Ghibli shop\n* Buddhist statue/temple\n* Sasuke Inari Shrine\n* More to be added\n\n**DAY 4** \n\n* Tsukiji fish market in the morning\n* Kirby cafe\\*\\*need to book (merch@skytree) &amp; Donguri Kyowakoku\n* Side note: I love Kirby and if anyone knows where else to get official Kirby merch, or if Skytree is the only one!\n* More to be added\n\n**DAY 5: KAWAGOE**\n\n* Will probably just explore.. no specific restaurants or places in mind except for the Miffy bakery/store haha\n\n**DAY 6: HAKONE day 1**\n\n* I do not plan on buying the free pass.\n* ***Leave around 8am for Hakone***\n   * Okay this is my biggest concern. Originally I wanted to take the Romancecar but that's only accessible from Shinjuku, which is 30-40mins away. Google Maps give me an option that was 4,000yen but that is a bit expensive than what I expected. This is what Navitime recommends for around 2,000 yen:\n      * Asakusa -&gt; Ginza line to Ueno stn -&gt; Ueno-Tokyo line to Tokyo station(?) -&gt; JR Tokaido line to Odawara -&gt; Hakone Tazon bus to Hakone-Yumoto\n      * \\^ I had this result last night, but checking this morning it has now changed. Any reason for this? Please let me know if that works or if I need to change it based on the time, or if I need to buy any passes instead of just using suica.\n* Hopefully get to Hakone-Yumoto before noon, pick up some food at 7/11 and then head to ryokan and leave luggage (check-in won't be till 3pm)\n* Hakone Tozan Bus? to Hakone shrine (Hakonemachi)\n* Explore, have dinner @ nearby restaurant\n* Bus back to hotel\n   * I believe the last bus to my hotel is around 5pm\n   * On Google Maps it says to get on H Line -&gt; Motohakone Port bus (K Hakone old street line) -&gt; Okuyumoto entrance -&gt; small walk to hotel\n   * Getting here and back worries me lol. I am unable to read Japanese, will the buses also have English signage on them so I can differentiate the buses, or what is the best way to figure it out?\n* Onsen\n\n**DAY 7 - HAKONE day 2**\n\n* Breakfast at hotel\n* Explore Hakone / Yumoto Station \u2192 Odawara Station\n* Odawara Castle\n* Odawara Stn \u2192 Bus back to Tokyo\n* Check-in at hotel (haven't booked yet, plan to be around Shinagawa station)\n\n**DAY 8**\n\n* Buy souvenirs, do most of the shopping. Will visit Shibuya again\n   * Don Quijote\n   * Village Vanguard (Shibuya)\n   * More to be added\n* Shibuya Sky (need to reserve)\n\n**DAY 9**\n\n* Train to NARITA -Flight @ 10am\n\nThank you for reading:)",

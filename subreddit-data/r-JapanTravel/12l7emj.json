    "postText": "Hi all, my partner and I are taking our honeymoon this year after getting married this past Dec. I am a planner (thanks dad lol) when it comes to taking trips and I like to at least have a rough idea of what we are gonna do each day. Hopefully I didn't pack too much into our days? I tried to keep days separated by areas of things to do so we weren't backtracking or overlapping too much. Tell me what you think?\n\nAlso are there any cool festivals to go to in Oct? I saw Shuki Taisai Grand Autumn Festival on the 16th and 17th but I'm not sure how to change our schedule to go. Anything else that might be cool? I haven't added any festivals into our itinerary but I'm willing to adjust to go to one!\n\nMany of the days we're willing to just find food in the area to eat lunch and dinner at.

Japanese standards and expectations of animal welfare are orders of magnitude lower than the West; anything commercialised to do with animals will likely depress you. Owls are nocturnal animals. They\u2019re chained to posts and forced to stay awake. \n  \nWorth noting for the instagrammable places, lines can be several hours.",

You\u2019d spent probably two hours there. \n\nThat\u2019s 11AM.\n\n30 minutes transit back into the city, at least an hour at the owl cafe. \n\nNow it\u2019s 12:30PM. \n\nOne hour lunch, then it\u2019s 1:30PM. \n\nTwo shrines maybe 2 hours together, now it\u2019s 3:30PM. \n\nIt\u2019ll be around 4PM when you get to Akihabara. \n\nMost major businesses and stores closes at 8PM, and you\u2019d gotta add an hour for dinner too. \n\nThere isn\u2019t much time realistically left for you to visit Ikebukruo because they\u2019ll close around the same time, and it\u2019ll take another 25 minutes for you to go from Akihabara to Ikebukuro. \n\nYou have to pick and choose what you want to see there. .",

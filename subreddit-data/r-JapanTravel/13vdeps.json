            "comment": "I feel there's way too much time spent being on the transit commute here, and you're not placing certain places together. You're going to need some time to streamline everything. \n\nDay 10 suddenly becomes Akihabara, Skytree, Asahi building, Rikugien Gardens and Tokyo Dome...which are all opposite directions of each other if that is the order you're going by. You're spending an awful a lot of time travelling between places but you're only going to specific points without exploring what's around it. \n\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong, but the Kirby Cafe is located at Skytree...but you're placing this on Day 16...WITH Ikebukuro...which is again the opposite direction. Kirby Cafe should be swapped with Rikugien Gardens since it's literally between Ueno and Ikebukuro. \n\nFinal Fantasy Cafe is located in Akihabara, which you could've went on Day 10, but you placed this on Day 15. You can tackle Akihabara on Day 10, have lunch at the cafe...then move on to Asakusa/Skytree afterwards. \n\nDay 13, 14 and 15 all have stuff in Shibuya. Why not just spend 1-2 whole days in Shibuya and 1 whole day in Shinjuku/Ikebukuro? You can literally swap Tokyo Tower and Imperial Palace with the Meiji Shrine on Day 13. You would at least be \"on the way\" back to Shimbashi. \n\nYour itinerary on paper does not look hectic, but you can cut down so much travel time by spending more time in 1-2 locations rather than spend barely any time at 4-5 locations.",

If you try and do more, you\u2019ll end up just hustling and bustling through the destinations and not really making much of the trip overall. Have a good time while you\u2019re there and enjoy the fall foliage!",

We have a back up plan too for days when we can\u2019t get to everything same day especially in Tokyo since we seem to have 1-2 days before we leave where we might have some free time to just enjoy more and explore rather than have something set in stone :)",

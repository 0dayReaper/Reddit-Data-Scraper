    "postText": "hello,\n\nI really need help with my itineray. \nI already have a basic plan, but I'm not really sure whats best. \n\n It is my second time. Last time was 2014. 6 weeks through Japan (Tokyo, Takayama, Kanazawa, Kyoto+Nara+Osaka, Tanabe/Kumano Kodo+Hiroshima)\nIt was a solo travel. Now I plan to go with 2 other people, they are older. I want to show them the important places, while seeing new things, too. \nThis is my first plan. I can add up to 3 days if necessary, I guess. \n\nThe big questions are:\n\n1. Should I add a night in Nikko? I would like to do Chuzenji and Kegon Falls. It shouldn't be to stressfull, but I want to see as much as possible... But two hotel rooms at the same time? I don't want to move to much luggage around. \n2. Is Matsumoto worth it? I wonder wether I should chance my itinerary here. Is it possible with large luggage? Luggage Forwarding? I feel like I can do better things than Matsumoto, but the castle seems very interesting. \n3. How should i handle the travel to Beppu/Yufuin? There is a nice train to Yufuin. I would like to take this train, but not shure because of car rental and the large luggage. Should I use Yufuin as my base or should I make a \"road Trip\" start from Beppu to Yufuin?\n4. How do I travel the best way from Takachiho Gorge to Nagasaki? I thought to drive to Kumamoto, visit the castle and then go by train to Nagasaki. Or should i travel via ferry and Mt. unzen by car? What is better? Maybe add one day? Recommendation?\n5. Should I add one day in Fukuoka for Yoshinogari Historical Park? Maybe add one day for the travel form Takachiho Gorge to Nagasaki to visit Unzen or recommended road trip? \n6. Or should i add a day in Kyoto? I really like this city. \n\n\nWe will travel with large luggage cases, but any tips to maybe reduce it? \n\nthis plan is dated around the Karatsu Kunchi Festival an visiting it one evening. \n\nDate | Place | what to do\n---------|----------|----------\n21.10.2023 | Germany | Flight start from 8:10-9:00 o`clock, Fra 12:15 o`clock\n22.10.2023| Tokyo | Arrival Haneda 8:10 o`clock, Suica, Luggage transport, SIM, Driver licence translation, Eat,  Hamamatsucho, Zojo-ji, Tokyo Tower, Azabudai Hills (if open), Teamlab, if open), Mori Tower, Tsukishima Monja Street, go to Asakusa and hotel. \n23.10.2023 | Tokyo | boat to Teamlabs Planets, Shinjuku Gyoen, Olympic area, Meiji shrine, Harajuku, Shibuya Sky \n24.10.2023 | Tokyo | Daytrip to Nikko (Kegon waterfalls?) \n25.10.2023 | Tokyo | Tokyo Skytree, Asakusa, Ueno (Museums), Ameyoko, Akihabara \n26.10.2023 | Tokyo | Kamakura, Enoshima\n27.10.2023 | Magome| Travel form Tokyo to Magome, exploring Magome (Kisu Valley)\n28.10.2023 | Magome/Kyoto| Hiking to Tsumago and back by bus; Travel to Kyoto, Hotel in Eastern part. \n29.10.2023 | Kyoto| Higashiyama: Kiyomizudera, Kodaiji, Yasaka, Gion, Nishiki Market, Pontocho\n30.10.2023 | Kyoto| Burg Nijo, Kinkakuji, Arashiyama \n31.10.2023 | Kyoto| Daytrip: Uji, Nara\n01.11.2023 | Kyoto| not decided yet. maybe Daytrip Osaka?

However, if you just want to see an original castle and are not super interested in the precise history of this castle, a quick stop at Himeji on 02.11.23 will suffice and is much less out of the way.\n\n&gt; tips to reduce luggage\n\nUse Takkyubin (luggage delivery service) to ship from Tokyo-Kyoto (carry a change of clothes in a backpack for Magome). Send 1-2 suitcases from Fukuoka - Nagasaki and live out of the remaining suitcase while bouncing around Kyushu to increase mobility.",

            "comment": "While Unzen is a popular onsen destination in Nagasaki prefecture, I would not recommend it for your itinerary. The Unzen Hell, which is a famous attraction, is relatively smaller compared to those in Beppu or Hakone, and the ryokans in Kurokawa offer better quality. Additionally, the traffic in Kumamoto city makes driving to Nagasaki more time-consuming than taking the shinkansen, with added time required for boarding a ferry, even without stopping at Unzen. On the other hand, spending more time in Beppu would be more worthwhile, as it offers eight different onsen districts with various types of hot springs to explore.\n\nI recommend spending at least two nights in Beppu, including one day to visit Yufuin either by bus or rental car, and reducing your stay in Kurokawa to one night, as Kurokawa is a smaller town if you don\u2019t have enough time. On the way to Kurokawa, you could stop by Kokonoe Otsuribashi, which is the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in Japan. As an additional piece of information, there are many unique onsens in the Kokonoe area, such as cold temperature onsens or carbonated onsens for those who love onsens.\n\nAs for Yoshinogari Historical Park, if you're not a big history fan, I wouldn't recommend visiting it. Instead, it would be better to spend your time sightseeing in Kumamoto city, such as visiting Kumamoto Castle or Suizenji Jojuen Garden. Alternatively, you could consider taking a day trip from Kyoto to places such as Osaka, Kobe &amp; Himeji Castle, Mount Hiei or even Mount Koya (which has a direct bus service).\n\nThe Yufuin no Mori express train to Yufuin/Beppu allows for larger suitcases, but I agree with the previous post that it is better to send your suitcases in advance, as it will make it easier to move around. Additionally, since it will be the autumn leaf season in Japan, I highly recommend booking hotels/ryokans as soon as possible.",

It seems very time consuming. \nI tgought I bring back the rental car in Kumamoto, Visit the castle and then go by train to nagasaki. But maybe to much in one Day? \n\nYes I think about adding a Day in Kyoto for daytrips. \nHabe to see what I want to Do, because I saw a lot 8n 2014, but the other two not. \n\nThanks. It helped. \n\nI will take the two nights in Kurokawa, I want to do Onsen hopping and a very slow Day. But the other Information is good, but it make it even harder. \nDon't Sure how to Do the Beppu/Yufuin Part. Maybe add one Day?",

                            "comment": "It takes about 2 hours by car to travel from Takachiho to Kumamoto station, and another 2 hours by train from Kumamoto to Nagasaki, so your schedule on the day of traveling to Nagasaki should be fine.\n\nYes, I would recommend spending at least 2 days, or more if your schedule allows, in Beppu/Yufuin. Personally, I prefer to stay in Beppu for convenience, but you could reverse the itinerary and stay in Yufuin, then visit Beppu. Here is a sample 2-day schedule:\n\n1st day: Fukuoka 10:11-&gt; Beppu 13:27 by Yufuin no Mori (which is the only train that goes to Beppu)  \nRent a car, drive to Kannawa, Beppu Hell,  Hyotan onsen, stay in Beppu\n\n2nd day: Drive to Beppu Ropeway, walk around (1.5 hours)  \nDrive to Yufuin, Lake Kinrin, Yunotsubo Kaido, lunch (3 hours)  \nDrive to  Kokonoe bridge on Yamanami highway, quick walk on the bridge (1 hour)  \nDrive to Kurokawa (30 mins)\n\nI just noticed that 11/3 to 11/5 is a three-day weekend during the autumn leaf season, so you can expect everywhere to be quite crowded. This could potentially add some extra travel time to your schedule, especially on Yamanami Highway. If I were planning this for myself, I would stay in Fukuoka during this period.",

This is because you will already have the opportunity to see many shrines and temples in Kyoto, as well as experience nature in the Mount Aso and Takachiho areas. While Kamakura is a nice day trip destination from Tokyo, it's essentially a smaller version of Kyoto with the smaller outside Daibutsu. Good luck!",

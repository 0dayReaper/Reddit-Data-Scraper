But at the same time, I really want to make this trip work :( \n\n\n\n\nMy original itinerary is rather packed too:\n\n\nDay 1: Naha airport -&gt; Hotel in Nago\n\nDay 2: Hotel in Nago -&gt; Nago pineapple park/orion happy park\n\nDay 3: Hotel in Nago -&gt; Matayoshi Coffee Farm -&gt; Hotel in Nago -&gt; Hotel in Naha\n\nDay 4: Hotel in Naha -&gt; Kayaking at Kaneku seaside park -&gt; Snorkeling at Blue cave -&gt; Mihama American village\n\nDay 5: Hotel in Naha -&gt; Makishi market/Kokusai Dori Street -&gt; Okinawa City\n\n\n\nI understand that the public transport in Naha is still relatively decent, so my main concern is really the travelling for Days 3 and 4.\n\n\n\nHere to get some brutal feedback and advice on the feasibility of executing this itinerary via public transport... and in a worst case scenario, if we should just forgo our bookings for this trip and stick to mainland Japan...\n\nIf you're able to help, would really appreciate your honest input. Thank you very, very much in advance! :)",

The buses are infrequent sometimes and if no one is waiting at the stop then they will not stop even if they get there earlier than expected. That being said, there is sometimes bad traffic on the island so the buses also have a higher chance of being delayed.",

Also if you're coming soon, plan backup indoor plans (Aeon mall, aquarium etc) it's rain season and some days have torrential rain that will make outdoor activities impossible.",

You'd be backtracking if you went there at the end of Day 5. I can't speak to the public transportation since I only took the bus or monorail for short distances on the days I didn't drive.

There are Benihana-type restaurants all over where the chef cooks your dinner right in front of you on large griddles in the middle of the table. These are popular with the military and their families, because they\u2019re delicious and reasonably priced for beef in Japan..\n\nThe sushi is fresh. If you want the Japan experience, be sure to go to one of the conveyor belt sushi restaurants.\n\nIf your hotel can recommend something, you have to try a traditional course dinner (Kaiseki ry\u014dri). Many different little dishes which add up to a visual treat and taste very good as well.\n\nBlue Seal ice cream is famous and quite tasty. Try out the beni potato flavor if you can find it.\n\nIf you want to try something more western, taco rice (literally tacos on rice) is good, and Okinawa\u2019s regular tacos are pretty good, too.\n\nI\u2019m an American living in mainland Japan, so I tend to try to get tacos, etc, every time we go there to visit my SIL.",

            "comment": "The busses I have rode in Japan are generally not marked nearly as well as trains, and often don\u2019t display the bus line name or route in romaji, and so if you can\u2019t read Japanese it gets very confusing trying to figure out if the the kanji on your google maps navigation matches what\u2019s on the bus electronic display. When I got on the buses in Japan i always had to ask the driver to be sure I was on the right one. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s more English speaking in Okinawa, but I would make sure that you and everyone in your group can confidently, without second thought, ask the bus driver  \u201cIs this bus going to &lt;insert place&gt;\u201d in Japanese - \u201cKono busu wa &lt;insert place&gt; ikimasuka?\u201d",

Assuming you're at least 18, it should be pretty quick to get.\n\nAfter that, apply for the AAA international drivers license, which you'll need, and rent a car. You will be miserable if you're sticking to busses only, and will be limited in what you can see. \n\n Personally, I'd skip mainland and go to Okinawa. Okinawa has a lot to see and is very nice, you just need to plan accordingly.",

They'd also need to check whether or not they need an IDL, as that changes from country to county, and how Japan accepts their license.",

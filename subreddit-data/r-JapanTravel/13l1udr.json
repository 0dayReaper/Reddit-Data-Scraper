    "postText": "We're first-timers in Japan going in the last two weeks of October for 11 days (this includes two .5 days for arrival/departure days). We're mid-30s adults who don't drink and really excited to see all things nature/outdoors and major Japanese culture and history sights! I need help figuring out how much time we need in each location and if/how we can squeeze in Takayama before heading back to Tokyo for our flight back home.

If that's too difficult, we'll stay in Kyoto and do day trips out to Hiroshima/Miyajima island, Nara, maybe Osaka before heading back to Tokyo. We really want to do Takayama if we can but it depends on how feasible all the other Tokyo/Kyoto days are + the 2 days in Hakone.",

There seems to be great onsens there too. \n\n\nHm, what if we did Hakone as a day trip and do two days in Takayama before heading back to Tokyo? Of course we want to see all the things but not overburdening ourselves is a priority... we want to go and really enjoy each place!",

    "postText": "Hi\n\nMe and wifey have been backpacking across Japan for 3 weeks now and going for a photoshoot in Tokyo next week. Our clothes are wrinkled af. I wonder if there is any place in I can iron a suit and a dress. I have my travel steam iron with me, but it doesn't work with voltage of 100-110, so I either need a transformer (would it even work?) or a place that provides a service. \n\nThank you in advance!",

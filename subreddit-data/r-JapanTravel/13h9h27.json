    "postText": "#Hi everyone!\n\nThis is the second part of our itinerary check, the first part can be found here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/z095v8/itinerary_check_3_weeks_in_japan_for_first_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/z095v8/itinerary_check_3_weeks_in_japan_for_first_time/)\n\nWe got invaluable feedback  in the comments of the previous post. Unfortunately we could only get reasonably priced flight tickets to Narita (13 hours direct). \nWe also know that we will need breaks and free time during our trip, so the itinerary contains only things we would like to see, but not necessarily have the time for all of them. We will prioritize and reschedule on the spot if needed.\n\nSince the previous post a couple of things have changed. It seems like fate was on our side, because a couple of days after I have bought our flight tickets, a work opportunity came up to spend 5 weeks in Tokyo. I was lucky enough to be selected for the project and managed to schedule the work right after our honeymoon. So our 3 weeks long honeymoon was extended with another 5 weeks of staying in Tokyo  where we can stay in a company paid apartment. Because of this 5 weeks long project we figured that we can visit everything we wanted in Tokyo, so we have adjusted the honeymoon part of our itinerary to include some of the sights we would've missed and allocated more days for Kyoto for example.\n\nWe'd love any and all feedback and advice! We still have a bunch of questions at the end of the post and would also appreciate any recommendations, especially on the accommodation side. The headlines of the itinerary indicates where we are going to sleep on the given days.  We've yet to book any hotels or ryokans, but I plan to do it in the next couple of days, so if you have any hotels or ryokans in mind please feel free to share them with us!\n\nThe dates are fixed: we will land in Tokyo on the 16th of October and leave the country on the 15th of December. Let's dive into the itinerary!\n\n## Osaka\n\n- Day 1\n   - Arriving to Narita at 9 in the morning:\n      - We will get our IC cards, esim / mobile sim cards at the airport.\n      - We will travel to Osaka right away with our luggage and check in to our hotel.\n   - Afternoon: Osaka Castle\n   - Night: wander Dotonbori for some awesome street food, Hozenji Yokocho\n   - We don't plan to do much on this day because we don't know how tired are we going to be from jetlag.\n- Day 2\n   - Morning and afternoon: Himeji and Kobe day trip. Himeji Castle and Mount Rokko by either foot or with the Shin-Kobe Ropeway.\n   - Evening: enjoying the city night life some more either in Dotonbori or somewhere else.\n   - This is still going to be a buffer day for jetlag, if we don't feel like it we will skip (some part of) the day trip and just do some sightseeing in Osaka.\n- Day 3\n   - Morning: Shitenno-Ji temple, Shinsekai  for some more awesome street food, Tsutenkaku Tower\n   - Afternoon: Sumiyoshi Taisha and teamLab Botanical Garden Osaka\n- Day 4\n   - Morning and afternoon: Universal Studios Japan\n   - Evening: Umeda Sky Building (entrance until 22:00)\n- Day 5\n   - TODO: Koyasan or Mount Yoshino day trip? Extra day in Osaka? Move it to Kyoto and just wandering? What do you think?\n\n## Kyoto\n\n- Day 6\n   - Morning and afternoon: Check out from our hotel and send our luggage to our Kyoto stay. After that day trip to Nara. Todai-Ji, Isuien Garden, Kasuga-taisha, Nara Park (and maybe climbing Mount Wakakusayama if the time allows).\n   - Evening: arriving to our Kyoto hotel.\n- Day 7\n   - Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Arashiyama Monkey Park, Tenryu-Ji, Togetsukyo bridge, Saihoji/Kokedera\n- Day 8\n   - Kiyomizu-dera, Higashiyama district with Sanneizaka and Nineizaka, Hokan-ji, Yasaka-dori,Kodai-ji,Hanamikoji Street and the Gion district, Pontocho\n- Day 9\n   - Morning: Fushimi Inari Taisha with Senbon Torii pathway\n   - Afternoon: Toji temple, Nijo castle, Nishiki market, more wandering in Gion  and Higashiyama\n- Day 10\n   - Kinkaku-Ji, Philosopher's Path, Ginkakuji, Ruriko-in\n- Day 11\n   - TODO: Kibune River, Kifune-jinja Shrine is our plan for now, but maybe we will just wander in the city\n\n## Narai-juku\n\n- Day 12\n   - Check out of hotel in Kyoto, and head to Ghibli Park in Nagoya. After the Ghibli Park, we wouldn't spend any more time in Nagoya, but continue on our way to Narai-juku. Ghibli park closes at 5 pm, so hopefully we can travel on the scenic mountain route with train (or car, more on that in the Questions section) and still see some of it in the daylight. Narai-juku is also one of those beautiful sights we would like to visit. The travelling by train is a huge time-sink though. In the evening we check into a traditional inn.\n- Day 13\n   - Narai-juku and its surroundings, in the evening we get a good night's sleep.\n\n## Fujikawaguchiko\n\n- Day 14\n   - Morning: checking out of the inn, then heading to our next hotel/ryokan in Fujikawaguchiko. It will be around 4 hours to get there by train.\n   - Afternoon: chilling in the hotel\n- Day 15\n   - Arakura Fuji Sengen Jinja Shrine, Chureito Pagoda, Fujiyoshida Sengen Shrine\n- Day 16\n   - Morning: Tenku no torii\n   - Afternoon: Relaxing in the hotel/ryokan.\n\n## Hakone\n\n- Day 17\n   - Travel to Hakone, check into the ryokan (and return the rented car?). Bike trip around Lake Ashi, Hakone shrine, Heiwa no Tori, Hakone open air museum.\n- Day 18\n   - Morning: anything we couldn't do on Day 17.\n   - Afternoon: chilling in the ryokan.\n\n## Yamagata\n\n- Day 19\n   - Head to Yamadera, climb the stairs to the Risshakuji Temple, then some hiking in the area. In the evening head back to Yamagata.\n- Day 20\n   - Travel to Ginsan, see the town and have a bath. In the evening head back to Yamagata.\n\n## Tokyo\n\n- Day 21\n   - Arrive to Tokyo from Yamagata, spend the day somewhere then get the keys to our apartment.\n- Day 22-59\n   - 5 weeks of work mixed with sightseeing. Below is just the initial list of things we would like to visit, there are just too much stuff to do in Tokyo! It was created without any need for completeness whatsoever, so please feel free to share with us spots we should avoid or absolutely must visit.\n   - Central Tokyo\n      - Tokyo Station and Tokyo Ramen Street (Donguri Republic)\n      - Hamarikyu Gardens\n      - Akihabara\n   - Northern Tokyo\n      - Asakusa\n      - Sensoji Temple\n      - Ueno Park\n      - Rikugien Gardens\n      - Tokyo Skytree\n   - Western Tokyo\n      - Shinjuku\n      - Omoide Yokocho\n      - Meiji Shrine\n      - Shinjuku Gyoen\n      - Yoyogi Park\n      - Shibuya in the night, Shibuya sky\n      - Nakano Broadway\n      - Inokashira Park\n      - Ghibli Museum\n      - Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\n      - Shin-okubo aka Korea town\n      - Strolling and shopping in Shinjuku, Harajuku and Shibuya in the night\n   - Southern Tokyo\n      - Roppongi hills\n      - Tokyo Tower\n      - teamLab Planets\n   - Eastern Tokyo\n      - Disneyland\n   - Day trips (at least one, probably to Nikko)\n      - Nikko, Ryuzu Falls\n      - Nomizono Falls\n      - Kawasaki and Yokohama\n      - Sendai\n- Day 60:\n   - Packing our stuff, strolling the streets for one last time then going to the airport and fly back home.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Is it true that there are no COVID-19 related regulations anymore? Is the Visit Japan App still an option to get through the airport in a fast track?\n2. Any advice on which sim card/esim provider are the most reliable?\n3. Any hotels or ryokans you would recommend? At some point we would like to splash out for a couple of nights for a ryokan where we have a garden and an outside bath, so if you know a place like that please share it with us!\n4. Any tickets that are hard/tricky to get and we should be aware of? I know USJ, the Ghibli museum and the Ghibli Park are always sold out quickly and it's tricky to book tickets as a foreigner. I can ask a colleague to pick up our tickets for us. Any other we should be aware of?\n5. Are we missing out on anything that we should absolutely see and we will be close to it anyway?\n6. I'm a little afraid of renting a car for the Nagoya\u2192Narai-juku\u2192Fujikawaguchiko\u2192Hakone part of the trip, but I haven't entirely dismissed the idea. I'm driving for more than 10 years now, so I should be okay, it's just the left-hand side driving I'm not sure about. Any advice on this one? Is it even possible to rent a car in Nagoya and leave it in Hakone?\n7. If we stick to travelling only with train, the 3 weeks long JR pass seems like a good idea. Not necessarily from a budget, but from convenience perspective. The price will increase from October, but since we would buy the voucher before October, we should still pay the old price. Is this correct?\n\n## The End\n\nI'll do one more adjustment based on your recommendations and hopefully I can book the hotels in the coming days.  Thank you once again for helping us out!",

The charm requires 1) the sun to have set, and 2) snow. Otherwise it's a generic old town that takes too much hassle to get to, especially because you are constrained by the schedule and seating capacity of the last bus.",

We can still do other stuff in Osaka if we choose to stay.\n\nRegarding Ginzan Onsen we can probably do it as a day trip from Tokyo later anyway. In this case we'll probably change the Yamagata leg of the trip to Nikko, and visit Ginzan in December. Beside of Nikko can you recommend another 2 day-ish side trip we can do?",

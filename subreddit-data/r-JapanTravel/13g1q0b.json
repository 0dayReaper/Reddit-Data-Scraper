    "postText": "Bought tickets off the site when it was first released. Also purchased an express pass for Nintendo world, Harry Potter, despicable me, Spider-Man/Jurassic park. \n\nWas kind of tired so just went to the park at 930 when it opened even though I know it probably opened earlier. \n\nRides I went for with queue times : \n- Spider man (normal lane) (20 min expected queue; 15 min actual) \n- Nintendo world 11.30 entry\n- Koopa\u2019s (express; 85 min expected queue, 15-20 min actual) \n- Yoshi (queued; 45 min expected queue time, 25 min actual) \n- Jujutsu Kaisen 4D (15 min expected; 25 min actual???) \n- not a ride but attended a parade (very fun!) \n- Jaws (15 min expected; 0 min actual) \n- Jurassic park (5 min expected; 0 min actual) (Really bummed out because we had an express pass for this but didn\u2019t seem to use it at all :() \n- Minion\u2019s (85 min expected; 0 min actual)\n- Harry Potter: forbidden city (express; 45 min expected; 5 min actual) \n\nUnfortunately the flying dinosaur was closed today. \n\nRides that had super long queues so we decided to skip \n- Hollywood dream (both of them) &gt;100 min \n- Nobito\u2019s VR adventure &gt;75 min \n\nFood tried: \n- turkey leg Jurassic world 9/10 \u00a51000\n- minion curry bun 10/10 \u00a5700\n- hot dog (normal version from amity village) 7/10 \u00a5600 \n- Harry Potter meat pie 10/10 taste but very small :( \u00a5600 \n\nOther activities that I participated in\n- minion meet and greet LOL\n- kinopio meet and greet\n- Jurassic world dinosaur performance (actually don\u2019t know what the name of it was) \n- carnival games! Loads of people were successful at winning a snoopy/minion. Unfortunately we weren\u2019t one of them but the success rates seemed really high (1 out of 3 or 4. \u00a51200) \n\nWeather was 24\u00b0C at its peak but the sun in Japan is brutal so please bring sunblock and hydrate! Helps to bring a UV blocking umbrella too. \n\nOverall had loads of fun at all the rides. My favourites would be the Jurassic park one, minion and koopa\u2019s! Everything is generally well created and fun. The Harry Potter one did make me a little nauseous after because I ate a meat pie right before it. Also, the ride somehow broke down in the middle (???) and then they got it back up and running. It was a little sad though because the VR experience was interrupted. Can\u2019t imagine the disappointment from someone who actually queued to have an imperfect experience.\n\nThe crowd was 30% school children. Not sure where they\u2019re getting their money from but they were going crazy buying merch! It made the experience more fun seeing people wearing head gear :)",

Felt kinda sad because it almost costs as expensive a sthe ticket itself lol\n\nMy fav actually yoshi adventure. It is very cute and brought you to different areas of the world that cannot be seen.\n\nGood thing you didn't ride the nobita one. It was brutal, it will swung you around with a lot of Gs. I still hold grudge against it. Just like how I hold grudge against transformer ride at joypolis. Both are very rough and make me wanna puke. I thought it will be a very tame ride, but nopee.\n\nDid you miss the waterworld? It was next to nintendo world",

The worst part is that it seems like people here are willing to join the queue no matter how long the wait time is.. \n\nAnyway, popular rides will still have long wait times even during non peak seasons!",

Then you gotta chase kaiseki (that is very strict with booking time slot). \n\nDay 16 - USJ and osaka aquarium is also not a good combo, unless you plan to just shop some souvenirs / take photos inside. The queue will be inevitable at USJ, even with express pass and timed based entry. Plus, it\u2019s Friday.",

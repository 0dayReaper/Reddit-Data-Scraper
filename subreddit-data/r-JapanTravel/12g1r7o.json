    "postText": " \n\nWe are traveling as a family of three (including a child who will be 4.5 y/o by then) in mid-October.  This is definitely not our first vacation or destination as a family, but it WILL be our first time in Japan! \n\nOur first leg of the trip will be in the Kansai region. We are going for a slow-paced trip, focusing on only a handful of major sights/activity per day. \n\nWe would appreciate any advice and extra eyes on this rough draft. Each day is in no particular order unless specified. Any recommendations appreciated! We love ALL the things. :)\n\n\nOSAKA\n\nDAY 1 (Wednesday) \n- Osaka castle boat tour \n- Shinsaibashi\n- Dotonburi\n\nDay 2 (Thursday)\n- Osaka Aquarium (AM)\n- Bay Area shopping and eats \n- Pok\u00e9mon Center\n- HEP Ferris wheel?\n- Umeda Sky (PM)\n\nDay 3: KOBE\n- Rokkosan cable car (AM)\n- Harbourland\n\nNeed some recs here. Thinking Nankinmachi or Kobe Motomachi?\n\nDay 4 (Saturday) \n\nOpen to suggestions here. \n\n- Option 1: Flex day in case we need jet-lag recovery on previous day.\n- Option 2: Kuramon market, TeamLab botanical (PM), and maybe Tennoji area? \n- Option 3: Nara day trip.\n\n\nDay 5 (Sunday)\n\nKyoto travel day (probably would like to be in Kyoto by mid morning/noon?)\n\n- Imperial palace\n- Pok\u00e9mon center\n- Shopping at Kyoto station\n\nDay 6 (Monday)\n- Fushimi Imari Taisha (AM)\n- Gion \n- Kiyomizu (PM)\n\nDay 7 (Tuesday)\nArashiyama area\n- Monkey park\n- Tenryuji\n- General shopping \n\nShinkansen to Tokyo by 3pm\n\n\nFirst question- I am really wanting to squeeze a visit to Nishiki Market during our time in Kyoto. Is there a day that is possible? I was thinking maybe when we first arrive depending on what time we actually get in the city. \n\nSecond question- Any specific family activities, like cool museums, you recommend? Really not wanting to go to USJ this trip. \n\nThanks in advance for reading to the end :)",

Your child will like the deer and the adults will really enjoy the giant Buddha.\n\nKyoto from Osaka is 15-30 minutes depending on the type of train you use.  On day 5, you check out Nijo Castle.  It\u2019s close to the Imperial Palace.  Also, I\u2019m not sure you can actually enter the Imperial Palace.  There used to be a bunch of hoops you had to jump through to visit.  The garden/park is fun though.\n\nOn day 7 if you\u2019re doing the monkey park, you need to go early in the morning.  It\u2019s kinda far from Kyoto station and if you\u2019re leaving that day, you may want to give yourself a lot of time to get back to the station.  Also, the monkey park is a lot of fun.",

They're not that far away.  Nishiki Market is only so interesting and can be very crowded.  I honestly didn't know it was a tourist destination the first time I went until I started seeing it on everyone's itinerary.  It's a short shopping street.  There are many more shopping streets in the area.  I tend to enjoy them more.\n\nYou could also possibly fit it in on your Fushimi Inari day when you are in Gion, because depending on the part of Gion you are in, it's not so far away.  Do get your kid(s) use to walking now if they are not.  We were pretty lazy last trip but still did at least 3-5 miles every single day.\n\nI would also do Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizudera and then Gion.  \n\nIf your kids like Pokemon, there is a Shinsaibashi Pokemon Center as well (It's near the Osaka Pokemon Cafe.)  My tween liked the Umeda, Shinsaibashi and Kyoto branches of the Pokemon Center more than the branches we went to in Tokyo.\n\nMy tween liked Nara a lot.  The deer can be aggressive, so just be warned.  I would probably do that with my kids though.  My tween loved climbing through the pillar of enlightenment at Todaiji.\n\nI want to stress, it is super easy to commute from Osaka to Kyoto.  But unless you are literally just going from either Shin-Osaka Station or maybe JR Osaka Station and you just want to visit Kyoto Station, it's going to be more than 15-30 minutes between the two.  \n\nDepending on where in Osaka you are staying and where in Kyoto you are going it might take about an hour and it might make sense to use the Keihan or the Hankyu.\n\nGood luck!",

It\u2019s about a 5 mile total walk, and they seem to be holding up pretty well so far (with frequent snack breaks lol).",

We were living somewhere quite exurban before our first trip, so I did some practice with buses and trams on a mother-daughter trip to San Francisco.  (My husband usually stays home.)\n\nIf you dream of going to Nishiki, you should do it, just be careful not to build it up too much in your head.  It's a shopping street with many tiny shops selling food items and lots of foreigners.  It can get very crowded.  \n\nWe have been to both Pokemon Cafes, Pokemon Sweets, and a bunch of Pokemon Centers.  The centers all have slightly different merchandise in stock and if something sells out in one, they don't take stock from another branch.  Kyoto has exclusive merchandise.  If they're not sold out, I am sure there will be Halloween themed merch.  Oh!  If one of you has a birthday in October and you bring a switch with you, they will give you a in game gift.  I keep forgetting to redeem mine.  \n\nMy tween really likes Pokemon.  We buy cute Pokemon bento boxes to use for school lunches as well as pencils.  I like small things to make school more fun.\n\nJapan is great for frequent snack breaks.  That's how we survive going in the Summer, lots and lots of ice cream snack breaks.",

Explore some of the side shopping streets to get a feel for it without being in the mad crush of the crowds.  Early morning for Nishiki is better and since kids wake up early that might be a good time to wander there before the worst of the crowds arrive.  \n\nEven though your child probably isn\u2019t using a stroller now at home if consider bringing a lightweight umbrella stroller with.  There\u2019s a lot of walking in Japan and this gets super tiring for little legs.  Unless you want to carry a tired/sleeping 4 year old - an umbrella stroller you can fold up in trains/subways and at restaurants can be super helpful.  I think there\u2019s even kinds you can fold up and carry as a backpack when not needed now. \n\nCheck out these websites for lots of toddler friendly travel tips and restaurant recommendations.  If you search the first few links below for the city name or neighborhood/area name you\u2019ll find some great ideas and tips. Best to get your #1 thing to see/do done early in the day so anything wise after that is just a bonus since it\u2019s hard to know how the day will go with a 4 year old.

Do not put stamps, stickers, or write on the pages yourself. I keep a separate sheet of paper in the front of the book and make a running list of the places I got each Goshuin.  When the book is full, *then* you can go back and write the location of the Goshuin into your book or just a small number in the bottom corner to correspond with your table of contents sheet.  \n- Check out some of the gachapon (capsule toy) arcades. Be sure to take your toy out of the capsule and place it in the recycle bag/bin by the machine.  Capsules will quickly use up all the space in your luggage but the toys are quite small.  \n- [Paid: Tokyo Shop With Most Gachapon in the World](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/this-new-tokyo-shop-has-the-most-capsule-toy-machines-in-the-world-022521)\n- You\u2019ll also find travel themed gachapon in places like major train stations or sites like Arashiyama in Kyoto. These will be themed such as pandas to represent the zoo in Ueno or famous places in that city/region.\n- When you get home, super glue magnets to the toys to make fun mementos for your fridge.",

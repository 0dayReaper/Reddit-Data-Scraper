I was wondering what your opinions are for the best time to visit then. :) I've watched some videos on Youtube for when to go, and they all have varying degrees, but the basic gist I got was I would like to avoid Golden Week (end of April to beginning of May) as well as the heart of cherry blossom season (end of March to beginning of April). However, I know cherry blossom season can vary, so I'm wondering when prices will start to rise/fall again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe trip will be with my husband and I. And though we are coming from a cold place (northeast region of the US), I would rather it not be too, too cold when we go. It would be nice if we could go during plum blossom season, but I am not sure how crowded it will be then/if prices will be a lot higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the places we were considering doing during our two week trip (subject to change):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Tokyo (at least a week here) for various stores, food, anime nerd stuff\n\n\\-Osaka for food, aquarium, team labs\n\n\\-Kobe for food, onsen, chinatown\n\n\\-Kyoto for temples and gardens, deer park\n\n\\-Hiroshima for musuems and rabbit island",

We actually still saw Sakura in full bloom at Oshino Hakkai (Fuji Five Lakes) and it only rained one day our entire trip! I was seeing 300+ min wait times at USJ at the end of March, and wait times were pretty low when we went on April 18th. There were still long lines everywhere, but that\u2019s just Japan. I mainly saw locals and not as many tourists as I was expecting! I packed lots of long sleeves and regretted it because it was way warmer than we thought it would be (especially while we were walking everywhere). I think we hit the sweet spot between the Sakura peak crowds and golden week. I\u2019d recommend it for sure! Granted it\u2019ll be slightly different each year, so it\u2019s hard to plan for!",

We still saw plenty of blossom because it lingers on and yes it's quite busy, but certainly not impossible. The weather was good. Some warm days in the south and inevitably a bit of rain but perfect weather for sightseeing really.",

If you make your reservations we'll in advance for accommodations then that should be fine as well. \n\nI booked our accommodations in December/January for the end of March. \n\nIn terms of crowds:  I found tokyo crowded but, then again, for a city region of over 37 million the busy districts will never not be busy. \n\nI have no experience with Golden week but that one seems challenging - busy for accommodations and tourist-y destinations.",

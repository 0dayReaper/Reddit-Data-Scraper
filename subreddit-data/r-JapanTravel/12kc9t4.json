    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have been living for the past 6 months in Tokyo as part of my working-holiday visa. Everything is good here and I have been enjoying everything a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext month, my parents and brother are visiting me and staying in Tokyo for 10 days. Because of my Visa I am unable to purchase a JR Pass, so going as far as Kyoto/Osaka might be quite expensive and exhausting. I prefered we stick around Tokyo and explore the variety of things around here.\n\n  \nWhat is the best way for them to move around the city ? Should I just make them a Suica/Pasmo card and take DayPass for specific location (Enoshima/Kamakura, Odawara/Hakone) ? I have seen there are \"Tokyo Pass\" but these are super short in-time and are either only JR or only non-JR line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what I had scrateched in mind in terms of plan: (if you have any recommandation don't hesitate)  \n\n\n1 - Meiji-Jungu / Harajuku / Yoyogi-koen (show them around where I live) / Shibuya / Shinjuku  \n2 - Akihabara / Ueno (parc+museum) / Asakusa Senso-ji / Skytree  \n3 - Enoshima/Kamakura daytrip  \n4 - Tsukiji / Hama-Rikyu / Zojo-ji / Tokyo Tower/ Odaiba?Roppongi?  \n5 - Moutain daytrip Takao / Shiroyama / Sagamiko or maybe Mitake (less crowded)  \n6 -   \n7 - Odawara/Hakone daytrip  \n8 -  \n9 - Fujikawaguchiko daytrip\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think it will be cool or is it too bad not to go further to Osaka/Kyoto ? If my family pick up JR Pass won't it be useless for the different Odakyu daytrip ? They mostly want to see me and my environment but I also want them to get the best out of Japan.",

It\u2019s ok if you want to stay around Tokyo.\n\nYou lived in Tokyo and have not figured out the best way to move around? Yes, there is a subway ticket that can make sense for subway heavy days, otherwise, there is also a ticket with a discount for Mount Takao is you use the ropeway. Just check before buying any ticket/pass to see if they make sense for what you want to do.\n\nAkihabara is not a good starting destination, you should know shops don\u2019t open before 10-11 about anywhere.\n\nAnd no your family does not need JR Pass. You should know how much local train cost.",

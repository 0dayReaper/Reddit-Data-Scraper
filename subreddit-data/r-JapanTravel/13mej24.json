    "postText": "My family, partner, and I (64M, 64F, 33F, 31M, 28M, 27F) are traveling to Japan late January to early February 2024 (I know, this is super in advance). Our main itinerary is Osaka &gt; Kyoto &gt; Tokyo &gt; Sapporo &gt; Tokyo and we are a family that loves food/eating/drinking/cooking. I don't want to feel stressed getting around from place to place. None of us are keen on must-see things like sky buildings, Universal Studios, etc and prefer temples, walking around interesting neighborhoods, cafes and book stores.  We have no dietary or spice restrictions and we'll be trying our best to eat our meals a little bit off from peak hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main concerns/questions are: (thank you for your insights!)\n\n1. Is this itinerary feasible from a time and travel perspective? Is it too packed? Will we be spending too much time traveling in between places during the day?\n2. Are there any destinations, activities, or places to eat/drink that you would recommend? Looking for unique, quality, and intimate/down to earth experiences good for a family that likes all things food and drink. Family also has interests in pottery, woodworking, photography/cameras, games and books if that helps to spark any ideas.\n3. Of the options listed for meals below, do you have a favorite, any notes or reviews of the places I researched, or would you recommend a different place? Considerations are: a) we are a group of 6, b) tasty is important, c) budget friendly is good but doesn't need to be as long as it's worth it and not scammy. \n4. In the markets mentioned below, what foods must we try? What foods should we avoid/be warned of? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is our detailed itinerary:\n\n**Osaka - Day 1** (half day starting in afternoon)\n\n* Cheese tarts from Pablo, pick up an additional street food snack if hungry\n* Yakiniku @ (A) \u713c\u8089\u3054\u308a\u3061\u3083\u3093 in Doyamacho, (B) Yakiniku M Hozenjiyokocho, (C) Matsusakagyu Yakiniku M Hozenji Hanare, or (D) Tsurugyu\n* Walk around Doguyasuji street and go to Taito Station Namba\n* Lodging @ (A) Sotetsu Grand Fresa Osaka Namba, or (B) KAMON hotel\n\n**Osaka - Day 2**\n\n* Early morning, train to Endo Sushi for breakfast\n* Taxi to Osaka Castle\n* Walk+train to Kuromon Market, lunch at the market (Tako tamago, soy milk &amp; soy milk donuts, kuromon roll.

Beyond the fact that you don't know what the status of these places will be so far from now, you're kind of blocking off part of what makes Japan so amazing, especially in Tokyo. \n\nThe baseline for Japanese restaurants is high, and there are an absurd concentration of them. Walking around Tokyo, you are constantly walking by places that look amazing. Endless snack shops, izakayas, restaurants. And many are barely reviewed on Google Maps or Yelp. Give yourselves the freedom and flexibility to jump into any of them without worrying about ruining your reservation at Timeout's #7 hottest soba joint in Tokyo.\n\nMy personal opinion, of course. It will be difficult to fit 6 in certain places, though, so maybe reserve a handful of your top must-eats.",

So tsukiji is basically just market for tourists. Come early around 7, by 9 it will be overcrowded with people and people lining up for food everywhere \n\nNot sure about sapporo as I've never been to sapporo.",

Is same-day luggage forwarding an available option or will it still be costly? I tried looking up on Yamato website but couldn\u2019t find a price for same day from Osaka to Kyoto for luggage size 140 &amp; 160. Would appreciate any insight on available service providers. \n\nDay 6: Oh good to know! Had no idea it\u2019s not a fish market anymore.. thanks for the answer on the recommended time to go. Is there another market you would recommend that\u2019s more local, or does Tsukiji have good/fresh food even though it\u2019s touristy?\n\nThank you so much!",

Best bar there is death match in hell. Best bar in Sapporo is beer inn Mugishutei. Has a massive selection of craft beers from all over. If you like whiskey the nikka whiskey distillery is not that far from Sapporo. If someone likes gaming then when in Osaka they should hit up PC and retro bar space station. Pretty close to dotonbori. It\u2019s just a bar that has older consoles set up with things like Mario cart. Pretty close to dotonbo\nAs for interesting neighbourhoods Akihabara is a pretty interesting place. Takeshita street in harajuku is a cool place as well. Not too far from Shinjuku either. If you go there get a crepe they are good.",

It\u2019s tourist trap with overly priced ramen, average taste. There are literally hundreds of Ramen stores that are better than Ichiran IMO in term of both price and taste.",

I know it sounds low but unlike Google where average food gets 4 stars and above. Just add 1 star you\u2019ll get an equivalent rating for Google review. For this shop, 3.6 + 1 = google review equivalent of 4.6stars.\n\nAnd also, unfortunately for people who can\u2019t read Japanese, many solid ramen restaurants don\u2019t really give a damn about foreigners hence some~many of them don\u2019t have English menu. If you want to try, according to review, for Hokkaido :\n1. Menya Saimi \u9eba\u5c4b \u5f69\u672a 3.78/5, 900yen/bowl, (No English menu, non ticket vending machine)\n\n2. Sapporo Junren \u672d\u5e4c \u7d14\u9023 3.75/5, 900yen/bowl, (No English menu, ticket vending machine)\n\n3. (Shoyu ramen) Menya Nanabe \u9eba\u5c4b \u5948\u3005\u5175\u885b\u30003.75/5, 880yen/bowl, (No English menu, ticket vending machine)\n\nFor Osaka:\n1. Kadoya Shokudo \u30ab\u30c9\u30e4\u98df\u5802 3.81/5, 1080yen/bowl (No English menu, non ticket vending machine)\n\n2. Human Beings Everybody Noodles \u4eba\u985e\u307f\u306a\u9eba\u985e 3.78/5, 800yen/bowl, (No English menu, non ticket vending machine)\n\n3. Ramen Jinsei Jet, 3.78/5, 1100yen-ish/bowl, (No English menu, non ticket vending machine)\n\n&gt;&gt;Ichiran type ramen ( tonkotsu ) but with English menu: Ramen Kozo \u3089\u30fc\u3081\u3093\u5c0f\u50e7, 3.72/5 890yen/bowl, ( A board with picture and English name is placed outside the entrance, but vending machine is all Japanese. You may ask the staff for assistance or find the button with Japanese name that matches your ramen of choice from the English&amp;Japanese name written board)\n\nAlso, most probably the shops above are going to have a queue, the higher the rank, the longer the queue. So better arrive early when peak is low. Also, most people in the queue is going to be Japanese and this is how you know it\u2019s legit.\n\n*please note that, this is just a general review of all ramen. In japan, there are many types of ramens, for example : Shoyu(soy sauce), Shio(salt), Tonkotsu (pork broth) and miso being the most basic ramen types. To find you best ramen store, you first need to tell you your favorite ramen type because not all types are liked by all, and some of them are quite niche. \n\nFor me, in osaka, I\u2019ll always visit Konshinya in Namba. It\u2019s a iekei-type ramen, which is the combination of bone broth + Shoyu, a really flavor heavy ramen with a thick broth and thick noodle which doesn\u2019t really suit many people. You can give it a try if you want.\n\nIf you have any trouble about translation or need any general help, I\u2019ll be happy to give you a hand. Just message me and I\u2019ll try to reply asap.",

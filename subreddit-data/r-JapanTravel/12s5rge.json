    "postText": "Planning to go to USJ later this year. I am from the United States. I was testing out the entire purchase experience just to see what to expect. Before I get to the payment step, I get this notice pop up that says \"Please be noted that Apple Pay no longer supports VISA cards after March 31\"\n\n1. Anyone tried to book tickets after march 31 via USJ website and/or USJ app?\n2. Are you using Apple Pay?\n3. Which credit card has successfully worked? Visa/Mastercard/Discover/Amex?\n4. If it didn't work, did anyone contact their credit card company to see if that resolved the issue (bc the CC could be potentially blocking transaction since purchase is an overseas vendor)?",

This did take a few tries after declining payment a few times but eventually it does go through. Also the tickets do take a while to come through on email so I would suggest taking a screenshot of your order number for support in case there\u2019s any major delays.",

It failed 3x, succeeded on the 4th try after what seemed like a maintenance period on the site.\n\nTo add to the pain and annoyance, the Express pass and time slot I wanted had availability of only \"10\" - since I was trying to purchase \"4\" - every failed transaction actually reduced the quantity by 4, meaning I was only able to try twice per hour. Seems like every top of the hour whatever failed in the purchase process was thrown back into inventory. \n\nI knew this was a site issue so I did not contact the card company, you could see no attempt/charge was placed on each failure no matter the method.",

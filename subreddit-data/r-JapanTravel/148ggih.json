    "postText": "Hello! We like to bike and figured renting an E-bike from Kyoto Eco Trip (flagship at Kyoto Station) would be a fun way to spend the day. We would plan to pick up cycle around 7:30 and head toward Arashiyama. There looks to be a few good bike routes along the river.\n\nWe would spend some time in Arashiyama, quickly seeing the Bamboo Grove and then probably also seeing the Monkey Park and then Tenryu-ji. From there, we would head up to Kinkaku-ji.\n\nThose are our main priorities but there are a few places we could quickly stop at on our way back, including Kitano Tenmangu, The Imperial Palace (gardens, at least, via bike), and Nijo Castle. These are all not places we would imagine spending a ton of time. Primarily, just points of interest that I have included on the route to improve the return route.\n\nPrimarily, we are just looking to explore more of Kyoto and this would give us the freedom that a bus does not afford us. See link to trip.\n\nWe would hopefully aim to spend about 8-10 hours completing this, including for time spent at attractions and some food.\n\nAny tips / critiques are very welcome!\n\n[https://ridewithgps.com/routes/43274202](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/43274202)",

If we are in a small area like south of Kinkaku-ji on way up to the temple from Arashiyama, it isn't possible to park anywhere to grab lunch? It looks like the major attractions I have listed here should have parking with the exception of Kitano Tenmangu which we can definitely skip over?",

There are a number of places on the way to Kinkaku-ji but Google StreetView doesn\u2018t show much in the way of places to keep the bikes if you need to eat-in. This FamilyMart has a place to stick the bikes and there\u2018s outside seating: https://maps.app.goo.gl/HEYKmT6hEVHPcYm39. It\u2019s nothing glamorous but would do in a pinch.",

On the right side of the map, you seem to be cycling a lot in the downtown in the city, I would try to get away from downtown as much as possible.   There are tons of traffic lights. pedestrians and cars.  To be honest, it isn't very fun.   I would try to hug the mountains more closer.   I would try to cycle to Saga and beyond.  Be careful on your ebike downtown.. they can go a little faster than a moma-charli and pedestrians.",

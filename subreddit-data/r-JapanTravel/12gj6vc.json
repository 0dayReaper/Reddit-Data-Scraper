There isn\u2019t much to do at the mountain and the hike doesn\u2019t take long.\n\nAlso I would keep the car an extra day and do some more exploring in the middle of the island. Like go to yasui valley, see the vine bridges or oboke gorge etc.",

Most TV shows advertise it as you just kind of walk up, and find accommodations along the way, like Shacks maintained by grandpas and whatever for free",

The grandpas do it for fun and welcome folks.\n\nI can't speak for personal experience though as this was on TV. In my views, old folks usually want to stay busy, esp. (In personal experience) with foreigners, they are entertaining guests/people for them to hear from. They'll offer buy drinks and food for you in exchange for your time. I feel sorry for women who think the old men are trying to get jiggy with them and decline, they miss out on this stuff. But, Shikoku is great.",

There's a nice market on weekend mornings as well.\n\nI used to live in east Kochi which doesn't get as much love, but it is a lot quicker to get to and maybe more unique/rural. You can drive to Cape Muroto in 2 hours and there's a geological park and a big statue of yer man who made katakana. You could go up to Umaji which is probably the biggest yuzu town on Shikoku... beautiful river to drive up beside. Aki City has a few tourist sites including the home of the man who made Mitsubishi. There's a good few sake breweries as well. The drive from Nahari down to Muroto is one of the best. There's a recreated Monet museum as well... it's interesting.\n\nThere is a lot of natural scenery whether waterfalls, rivers, or beaches.",

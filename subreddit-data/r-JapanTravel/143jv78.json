There is one in Saitama near Tokyo too.\n\nRobot Restaurant is closed permanently, but there\u2019s lots to do around Kabukicho. Omoide Yokocho alley, for example.\n\nI really enjoyed TeamLab Planets. One of the few touristy things that lived up to the hype.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI believe the Himeji Yukata Festival is just in the late afternoon/early evening.  You should still go, but you probably want something else to do that day (like visiting Himeji).\n\nThe direct shinkansen from Kyoto to Hiroshima leaves sometime between 7:40 and 8:20.  I don't remember exactly, try to catch that one since it is faster and easier to Hiroshima.\n\nYou will need to Kawaguchiko Station on your own, but this tour seems to do the ice caves and the forest:\n\n[https://www.viator.com/tours/Fujikawaguchiko-machi/Mt-Fuji-Ice-Cave-spelunking-at-Aokigahara-Forest/d50515-56714P1](https://www.viator.com/tours/Fujikawaguchiko-machi/Mt-Fuji-Ice-Cave-spelunking-at-Aokigahara-Forest/d50515-56714P1)\n\nI suspect this tour is the same on Trip Advisor:\n\n[https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g1165976-d12968461-Explore\\_Mt\\_Fuji\\_Ice\\_Cave\\_in\\_Aokigahara\\_Forest-Fujikawaguchiko\\_machi\\_Minamitsuru\\_g.html](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g1165976-d12968461-Explore_Mt_Fuji_Ice_Cave_in_Aokigahara_Forest-Fujikawaguchiko_machi_Minamitsuru_g.html)\n\n(Though Trip Advisor seems to mention the touring company)\n\nI have not used any of these tours nor am I in any way affiliated with them.  I would specifically search for tours to Aokigahara though since most Kawaguchiko tours from Tokyo just do things closer to Kawaguchiko Station.",

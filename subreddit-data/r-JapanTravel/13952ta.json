I decided to take two cabin bags (one will check in) and one small backpack. I'll do this because of the shinkansen 160cm Shinkansen rules. Any advice regarding this?\n5. Also, I'm buying the Jr Pass throughout the official website. I've seen people saying its not worth but, the difference is not that much and I don't have to wait for anything to get to my house that can take up to three weeks. Why people talk bad about the official website?\n\nHope this isn't too much to ask, looking forward for you guys feedback and tips. I'm all hears to suggestions and some changes.

It's considered the most beautiful forest in Japan. It's worth the visit, and there are parts of the park that aren't visited as often by people that want to self harm. There's also a performative reason to visit the park; the more people visit it for normal reasons the less it becomes the suicide forest and the more it becomes just a forest. We have a very big habit these days of brushing self harm mentality under the carpet (for example, the word itself is enough to get censored on some social media platforms - how does that actually help people get help) so not going to the forest just because of it's reputation doesn't help either the people that want to self harm, the people that maintain the forest, or yourself.\n\nThere are guided tours that walk on curated paths that I could guarantee wouldn't encounter any NSFW stuff. That said, there are alternatives u/izznreddit can look at, like Owakudani or Koajiro-no-Mori. I personally think it's worth the visit, but I think you need to be aware, and anyone that goes just to hike around themselves off the trails is asking either to see something they wish they wouldn't or to meet a park authority who thinks they're there for that reason.",

Not only do I get good tips but I\u2019ve had genuine conversations (even through translations apps) and exchanged contacts with some really cool people.

In Shinjuku I was at a really cool blues bar and when one do the bartenders got off we went to Golden Gai together he bought me some ramen and then I bought him a few drinks for all the tips he gave me. \n\nIn Osaka I met a really sweet older couple from Hokkaido at a sake bar (the man spoke English well) and we talked about so much interesting stuff. \n\nThen last night in Kyoto I met a really nice younger couple at a sake bar, lots of good conversation and then the next thing they know they bought my drinks. Needless to say they have an open invitation to visit in the states whenever! \n\nJust put yourself out there. Your enthusiasm for Japanese culture will mean a lot to the locals.\n\nAlso my personal tip that wasn\u2019t on your list: the knife and ceramic shops are worth spending some\ntime around. Sakai just south of Osaka has a really cool history of craftsmanship- particularly around knife making but there\u2019s a textile, pastry and processing history as well. And in Asakusa you can go along Kappabashi street to see all cool knives and pots and stuff. But culinary is a big thing for me. Just another tip",

Jet lag is typically worse flying east than west, especially if you don't have much experience with it. I wouldn't really plan much for the day you land. By the time you get though immigration, collect your bags, exchange your JR pass, setup your SIM/collect your pocket WiFi, get out of the airport, check into your hotel etc etc you'll be fighting exhaustion.",

Usually it's just get the essentials sorted and then get out of the hotel and wander around for a few hours so you resist the temptation to sleep early. You want to try and remain awake until evening so you sleep through the night and can then try and normalise your sleeping pattern. Go to an arcade, look round some shops, and get some dinner. If you have the energy to do some sightseeing great, but it's better to assume you won't when it comes to planning.\n\nAnd yeah that's about average flight times from Europe, maybe a little higher as changing flights usually adds about an hour so you're looking at probably 18+ hours travel time from airport to airport.",

You don't have time to see everything of course but you can hit up Itskushima Jinja on Miyajima and have a good walk around before catching the ferry back and still have time to see the museum and not have to rush. I've never had an issue getting a train back in time, usually I have dinner in Hiroshima before heading back.

I've only been there a couple times, and always walked from the station. It isn't far, but still a walk, and then the walk up to the castle.  Himeji Castle is definitely worth seeing.  We live in Osaka part of the time though, just a couple blocks from the castle, so walk through the grounds often.",

This is our first time and to give you a clear idea of our itinerary, I planned 2-3 things for each day and for travel days, I kept it light and empty. Now to the reality of it being here, I honestly think you packed too much. You need to take into accord getting lost in the train system, weather, exhaustion, etc. Since it\u2019s our first time, we wanted to experience everything but it\u2019s just not doable. On some days, we skipped on some things and had to prioritize certain things. You have to remember that you\u2019ll be walking everywhere and that exhaustion is real if you\u2019re not used to it. That\u2019s coming from people who regally work out as well. Sometimes we have to have a mid day break and go back to the hotel to recuperate. I 100% agree with others that part of Japan is to just go with the flow. There\u2019s so many cool things around the corner that\u2019s not online that doing so really immerse you in the culture. We had times where we followed an itinerary and wanted to do an interesting trail we found and it was great! Not every night or day you should have something planned. I think it\u2019s better to creat balance between packed days and chill days to just explore or walk around :)",

You can connect it to your IC card to make it extra convenient. \n\nIf you bring one large roller you\u2019ll be fine too. We travel around with large luggage and a massive stroller and haven\u2019t had a problem. If you go that route, just book Shinkansen seats with oversized baggage seats.\n\nEdit: I see that you have a JR pass so nvm on the app!",

Don't make your travel another obligation.\n\nBe smart about it, prioritize the things you want to experience most and drop a bit of efficiency to have the best chance of maximizing the experiences you do undertake.\n\nI'll try to give an example in your itinerary of what i mean about being smart about it:\n\nTake your day 6 and 8.\nIt makes sense in your itinerary to do Osaka first and then Himeji if you're hellbent on doing both. You're already there so do that first. For all intents and purposes though, Himeji Castle is the better place to visit.\n\nDon\"t cut Osaka but instead turn it around. Go to Himeji first. The things you plan in the morning are the activities that virtually always succeed. You don't generally start running out of time or rushing at 10 in the morning. You start running out of time at 4 in the afternoon.\n\nPriorities means, go to Himeji in the morning. You did your must.\n.\nIt's a lot cooler than you thought? Stay longer. \nDid Himeji and you're tired? Don't go to Osaka and enjoy that lunch picnic.\nBored faster than you thought? Go to Osaka Castle.\nThink you've seen your fill of castles? Go on to Kobe anyway a day early. Saves you an entire day to do anything else.\nMet some awesome people and they are going somewhere? Skip Osaka Castle and join em.\n\nIf you keep your itenerary as is and both castles are a must and you don't put priorities? you set yourself up for a timesqueeze and that leads to disappointment.\nArrive at Himeji at 2pm and it turned out a lot cooler than you thought? Well, too bad. It closes at 5 so tough luck.\n\nBy doing it like i just gave an example of, you are tempering expectations for yourself and not putting more stress on you. Did both anyway? Great! Didn't do Osaka because you made a different choice? Well great! You probably had a great time doing what you were because you wouldn't have skipped Osaka otherwise.\n\nIf you feel you cannot prioritise, essentially your mistake was not planning enough time for your trip. And that's generally the hardest problem to fix or impossible to fix. So prioritise accordingly :) \n\nSet yourself up for options, not obligations.",

The park around Osaka-jo isn't bad, but Himeji and the nearby gardens are far better. Nagoya has a great cafe/kissaten culture. I'd suggest checking it out if you go there. \n\nYour day 4 looks kind of impossible to me. If it's possible, you aren't staying anywhere long enough to really enjoy it. Just check a box and move on. I'm not really sure Nara is needed. I'd just spend more time enjoying Kyoto rather than a couple hours on the train. \n\nI'm not really into Pokemon, but knowing Japan, I don't think you'll find much of interest going to the center in different cities. Trying to do the castle in Osaka and Himeji on the same day probably isn't reasonable. The shotengai in Himeji is nice, also consider Engyoji if you go. \n\nIs there anything in particular you want to see in Kobe? I enjoy going over there for a day or evening, but as far as tourism it's a bit of a questionable choice. \n\nTrying to do Hiroshima as a day trip might be rough. Get a very early start. Wait times for the museum can be an hour. There was a boat going from nearby down to Miyajima but I'm not sure how often it runs, otherwise you are probably looking at nearly 90 minutes getting to Miyajima from the museum. You won't have a lot of time to explore the island. Also be aware shop on the island close by 5 or 6pm. \n\nShibuya sky, Tokyo tower and sky tree are probably a bit too many observatories if you plan to visit all of them. The shops at the bottom of Tokyo tower can make it a bit disappointing. Sky tree is actually a bit too far from everything and too high and probably has the worse skyline view. \n\nYour last view days trying to fit in Sendai, Utsunomiya and Hakone seem unnecessary. Shinobi no Sato seems quite a way from Hakone.  \n\nAh, you just have two bags. I don't really think the size is that much of a concern on the Shinkansen, especially if it's soft sided. Personally I'd recommend a day bag you can put in your large bag when traveling rather than trying to carry both separately. If you don't have a rail pass, especially if traveling alone, I'd just by the Shinkansen tickets at the station.",

Time spent packing up, checking out, finding your next hotel, and checking in again is time that can be spent doing other things. Osaka and Kyoto are 15 minutes apart by Shinkansen, and not much longer by local trains. I'd seriously consider just picking one to spend your Kansai leg in. Same with Tokyo, you don't need to stay in Shibuya and Akihabara. Pick where you want to enjoy the nightlife, travelling to other parts of Tokyo during the day is trivial.\n\nI'd consider skipping the Pokemon Centers in Osaka and Nagoya and just hitting up the one in Ikebukero (Tokyo). It's the biggest in Japan after all.\n\nRegarding the daytrip to Hiroshima and Miyajima from Osaka, it's doable and I've done it a few times. But you have to be aware of a few things. Firstly it's going to be a long day. You need to leave quite early in the morning to get there early enough for it to be worthwhile. Two is that a lot of things close early, especially on Miyajima. Pretty much everything starts to shut around 5pm or earlier on the island. You need to prioritise what you want to see and schedule accordingly. It's definitely possible to see (without rushing) Itsukushima jinja and have a nice walk along the shopping arcade on Miyajima with enough time to go around the peace memorial museum in Hiroshima followed by a walk round the peace park and see the A-bomb dome. You likely won't have time for much other sightseeing but you can get dinner in Hiroshima before catching the shinkansen back to Osaka.",

Getting lost in train stations if it\u2019s your first trip etc. etc. \nYour itinerary looks so much more intense compared to mine, good luck!",

Hopefully you\u2019ll be going mid week like we did because I heard weekends are definitely worse. The only reason we got to go on any rides and have entry to Super Nintendo World was paying extra for a fast pass set on Klook. You can be looking at an hour wait at least for the restaurants, food carts and even many drink vending machines. The better rides were almost immediately at two hour wait times. \n\nThe rest of your itinerary looks fine but fairly packed. I would suggest picking one thing on the busier days that would be ok to miss if something happens. We had a long list of \u201cto do\u2019s \u201c and a shorter list of \u201cmust do\u201d. This worked in our favor because it was easy to get distracted by other events we came across or cool attractions we hadn\u2019t thought of. There\u2019s a lot we did not see, but not for lack of trying. And, it will be exhausting. Amazing but exhausting. Bring extra shoes and have a wonderful trip!!",

The shinobi show is good, but the place is just too small. Now I don\u2019t want to be a Karen and tell you, DONT GO THERE. If you want go, just be aware that you might feel disappointed. Is a good place for kids tou. From this shinobi place you can walk like 25-30 mins to oshino hakai. I recommend this place, is very beautiful and you can take some nice pictures.\n\nAbout aokigahara I have been there 3 times, it is not as scary as ppl thinks, just stay on the tracks, and if you have good timing you can easily go walking to Iyashinosato. Beautiful place that looks Like an old village. In aokigahara I have seen even school trips there, so is not empty like everyone thinks.\n\nNear aokigahara there are some ice / wind caves, again, they are very small, you can see them in around 10 mins, I think entrance is like 300\u00a5. If there is a huge line I would probably skip them. I\u2019m Just mentioning them so you can be aware.\n\nIf you still have time to wander around yamanakako walk around ashigaoka lakeside park so you can take some good pictures of Fuji and the lake.\n\nBring some good comfortable shoes for walking a lot and/or for doing hiking.\n\nGood luck mate!\n\nEdit: \nI just noted for yamanashi you have one single day and what you want to see are in opposite sides. I don\u2019t think it is feasible unless you go super early morning. To reach aokigahara/ice/wind/caves/iyashinosato will take you one hour by bus to get there from kawaguchiko. And shinobi place and yamanakako are in another direction around 30-40 mins from kawaguchiko.\n\nAnyway bests of lucks",

Its one of the largest theme parks in the world with ridiculous crowds. \n\nAlso, I would highly recommend looking into the themed cafes and restaurants in Tokyo. While not attractions per se, they are truly one of a kind and are what I'm looking forward to most! \n\nGood luck with your trip!",

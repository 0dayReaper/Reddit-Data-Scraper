    "postText": "I just returned today from a 6 day trip to Kyoto and Tokyo. It\u2019s a trip that changed me. I turned 30 while on the trip and spent part of it exploring on my own. This is my first foreign trip of my adult life and first ever alone. I was apprehensive and nervous due to the language and culture differences being from the US, but doing it on my own and then meeting up with a pre-planned work related trip to shibuya was helpful for my growth as a person. I found incredible apparel, food, and accommodations. Spent some time wander Kyoto\u2019s parks and shrines in the early morning, the tiny allies filled with vendors and stores, and then walked the drizzling neighborhoods of shibuya and harajuku during a night finding some of coolest dressed people I\u2019ve seen. \n\nI\u2019ve got a new appreciation for my own self and I owe it to this trip. Just wanted to write it down somewhere and sing the praises. \n\nI intend to return. ",

I think most people are like you, in that they consider the main point of travel to be discovering new places, and hence going somewhere you've already been is a wasted trip. I see leisure travel kind of like going out for dinner, in that the main reason I'm going out is to enjoy a meal, so I pick what I'm in the mood for at the time. Sometimes I'm in the mood to try something new but other times I just want to go to one of my favorite restaurants that I've been to a million times. Similarly, with travel, I value visiting new places, but I certainly don't consider it a waste to revisit somewhere that I had an amazing time.",

                                    "comment": "I'm not being a smartass here.... I don't really ever relax or recover. Weekends are too brief and end up occupied with obligations that can't be met on workdays, holidays are hit-and-miss (I work in IT and my role involves a fair bit of on-call availability), so basically I try to work through illnesses as much as I can and save up days off so that I can take my family on a decent 5-7 day vacation every few years.\n\nNow, it's possible to work your way up to more time off (at one job I got up to 15 days off per year), but then if you end up getting laid off or have to switch employers to make any career advancement, you basically get reset to the typical 10-day minimum with your new employer. And many of them don't increase that benefit until you have worked with them for 4-5 years.\n\nEmployers in the US have grown increasingly savvy about cutting or outright denying benefits to workers over the last few decades. The PR hit of laying off a few thousand workers is easy to deal with when they can save boatloads of money by just recreating those positions later at lower pay and benefits, or just outsourcing the jobs to another country for vastly lower wages.\n\nI've done what I can to migrate to more in-demand sectors over my career so at least I maintain some modicum of job security, but yeah... the drawback is that I have wound up with less vacation time overall than the \"average\" American worker in my lifetime. Life is stress and anxiety and scrambling to save in the probably-futile hope that I may be able to have enough saved to make ends meet when I'm older and too exhausted and in pain to work anymore (I have chronic health problems that will make working past my early sixties a very questionable proposition).\n\nEdit: On-topic, I have wanted to travel to Japan as long as I can remember, but have never had the time and money available at the same time to manage a trip over there. I have a passport, just waiting for the opportunity for a trip. If I have such a thing as a \"bucket list\", taking a solo trip to just explore Japan for a couple weeks would be the #1 thing on my list. If I'm lucky I'll settle for a 5-day visit someday. :(",

The personal shopping was also the best I\u2019ve been exposed to. The peaceful early morning walks in 50-60 degree weather was really enjoyable on my own. And I think I enjoyed navigating since I was most worried what train to take or sign to look for at a station but found it was easy once I slowed down, planned routes, and asked for help from station officials when needed. I found people were always willing to help and the really good people I met in stores, hotels, and stuff. \n\nGood length for me too. A few days solo and a few days with a work group including my spouse so I had familiar faces to see, explore with, and eat with. This was, however, a personal trip and so I took PTO and paid my own way. ",

I woke up early the next morning and took the metro and bullet train to Kyoto. I stayed in central Kyoto. I simply started walking. I had gotten a few temple recommendations from a friend who was familiar with the area. I googled them and walked toward, but never made it as I wander through parks and temples on the route. Shopping opened at 11 so I did a lot of that and then retired early due to fatigue. \n\nI then woke up the following day and trained back to Tokyo. Walked shibuya and shopped. I met my group, grabbed dinner. The next day we grabbed breakfast at *A Happy Pancake* which I would recommend. Good coffee and pancakes. Shopped shibuya and harajuku. We left the following day. Pretty quick couple of days in each focused on stores and shopping due to my line of work.   ",

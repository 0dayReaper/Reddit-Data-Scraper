    "postText": "Hi, \n\nThis might be an obvious question but would appreciate it if someone confirmed this with me. \n\nWe'll most likely be using Yamato luggage forwarding during our stay in Japan, but I'm confused why there's only a limited number of [counters available on the website](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/facilities/). While I found multiple Yamato Transport centers on Google Maps.  \n\nI'm assuming I can still forward luggage using any Yamato Centers that aren't listed on this [page](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/facilities/), but can someone please confirm this?\n\nAlso, can I store luggage at any Yamato Centre? If not, is there away to find out?",

            "comment": "The full list of Yamato service counters is here (in Japanese only, but you can translate the page using Google Translate): [Search for Directly Managed Stores and Dealers](https://www.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/ytc/files/redirect/search_office.html)\n\n  \nUsing the search, you can filter your results for places that have services you need. Keep in mind that not all are open on Saturdays or Sundays so you'll have to filter for that if you need it. I would also check the address on Google Maps Street View and make sure you can find it there. I tried to find one that was a Sales Office located in an office building and I couldn't find it since I couldn't read the Japanese and Google Translate had trouble translating the directory. Luckily there was another Yamato Transport nearby and that one was easy to find as it was visible from the street. \n\nThe office that I went to did not have an English speaking associate working the counter, so we used Google Translate to go back and forth asking questions regarding shipping times, the process, and filling out the paperwork. It was manageable, but the second time around we sent from a hotel to another hotel and it was super easy as the hotel took care of all of it. So, I recommend you do it through your hotel if possible, but if not, make sure you understand the forms at the very least. Also, I don't think shipping times are guaranteed - the associate recommended we give it an extra day just in case there's traffic that prevented our luggage from getting to Kyoto from Tokyo on time. We tracked our luggage and it was there on time, but just something to note if the things you're shipping are essential by a certain time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as storing luggage, they'll hold it for you if you ship to another office, but I'm not sure if most of them just hold luggage for you at the same site. This service may be limited to just the counters on this site ([Find A Counter](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/facilities/)), based on the text from this page ([Luggage Storage / Same day delivery FAQ](https://faq-en.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/app/answers/detail/a_id/4003/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNjgyMjc5MzY5L2dlbi8xNjgyMjc5MzY5L3NpZC9mVW9veVptZnZKel9MVlFsTzJUbkM2cWJpY1djc3FjYmd4U3lRT3pEVHBZX1NKaHM4Uk5pTE1mNmNkTGxFOWpPcngwNEk1Z21jR3FGSyU3RW9pc05TemFiM2hzdXJPZ25VMmFKYmRScHU2WGhOelg3Y0hRWHlJSlhzZyUyMSUyMQ%3D%3D)), but I'm not certain. Train stations often have coin lockers if you need storage for the day - I've found ones at the busiest part of the station can be full, but often times there are ones a few minutes walk out of the hubbub that aren't full.",

Both Yamato and Sugawa have partnerships with railways and some of the larger station locker areas (that have staff). Certainly airport areas as well\n\nCheck the YouTube for lots of advice, there are many good videos showing the ins and outs of forwarding luggage",

            "comment": "Yes, I can confirm this. I went to a Yamato Transport near Osaka station (which I also found searching on Google Maps) and they did all the forwarding procedures for me. Why the website is so short on information, that's a mystery.\n\nFor luggage storage, I remember reading that it depends, so you need to call them to confirm.",

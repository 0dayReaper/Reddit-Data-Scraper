            "comment": "Even if you're big anime fans not sure if there's 2 full days worth of stuff to do in each of Nakano/Akihabara, also bear in mind that merch is very aligned to what's out at the time and does just sell out. There's some anime stores in Shibuya Parco on the same floor as the Nintendo Store that might be of interest to you guys. Also shops open later than they do in the UK, so Akihabara isn't great in the morning as lots of things are closed. \nJoypolis in Odaiba often does anime collaborations, I did an Attack on Titan one a few years back and got some great merch there too, they sometimes do discount tickets for travellers if you show your passport.",

Really, you are just spending 3-4 days on everything else in Tokyo and Osaka. \n\nOsaka has much to offer - Tombori river, Dotonbori, DenDen Town (Arcade), Tokyo has so much more to offer too - Shinjuku, Shibuya area, Asakusa, etc.",

Even outside the main Gigos and Game Panic there's a ton of smaller arcades I loved",

            "comment": "Ikebukuro and sunshine city are further out, so this is going to make your travel time to other parts of tokyo longer.\n\nIve been twice now and I agree with other post that unless you just plan to comb through every store in Akihabara then one day is enough. \n\nI would suggest shinjuku and hakashita dori area for another day. Still lots of shopping and fun. (Akihabara is not the only place with anime stuff.)\n\nHave fun on your trip.",

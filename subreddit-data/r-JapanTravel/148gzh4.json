Maybe do Gion or something else on day 7.\n\nDay 8 - not sure if you wanted to do the Hakone Loop but you probably won\u2019t have time if you want to check into hotel first at 3pm. You could ship your luggage to Tokyo hotel and live off backpacks for one night in Hakone and complete the loop before checking in to hotel, or stay an extra night. \n\nFor DisneySea and Universal, I\u2019d personally try to rearrange schedules to try going on a different weekday instead of Friday to avoid crowds. I\u2019m not a local, but IMO amusement park experiences are heavily dependent on crowds, so I\u2019d rather optimize for that instead of say, Osaka Castle.",

But the morning view of the lake with Mt Fuji in the background is worth it.",

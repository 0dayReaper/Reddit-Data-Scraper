I am a diver and visited for the 2nd time recently.  \n\nAs for shops, I definitely recommend Aloha Divers Okinawa. Andrea and Pedro are a Brazilian couple that opened up the small shop 9 years ago and just the two of them run it. Had a great time with them.",

            "comment": "Having been to Hawaii a few times, I was well aware that the Japanese love to go to there.  But I would ask myself, \"Why don't they just go to Okinawa?  I mean they have their own subtropical island much closer to home.\"\n\nWhen I went to Okinawa in April, I was like \"Oh, this is why they go to Hawaii.\"   I don't know if I've ever been on a tropical or subtropical island whose architecture felt so non-tropical.  You fly into Naha, and the buildings are all utilitarian concrete devoid of any sense of style.  It's truly ugly.  I've heard explanations that it's because they needed to do that because of typhoons but most tropical islands have typhoons and hurricanes yet invoke certain aesthetics whether it be design elements, bright colors, whatever.\n\nWe traversed the island from south to north and back again.  I was part of a birding tour so aside from a wetlands park in the south, we generally stayed north. It was heavily forested and quite nice but wasn't a place where honeymooners would go to hang out at a beach.  There are probably some nice resorts I didn't see.  And perhaps Naha is skewing my view way too much (we did see a lot of it - you land and there is like a half hour shuttle ride to get to the rental car area).\n\nAnyway, my impression of it was that Okinawa was the one ugly place I saw while in Japan.",

The Japanese countryside is often quite beautiful, and the cities are great in a lot of ways \u2014 clean and convenient with lots to see, do and eat \u2014 but IMO they are not particularly attractive. There might be nice historic parts, but in the whole, when viewed from a distance even Kyoto looks like a giant concrete toilet bowl. The exceptions for me are Nara and Nagasaki, both quite pretty.",

Haven't booked flights yet but likely will fly out there a day or two after we land in Tokyo and then spend maybe 4-5 days there before flying back to the mainland. Looking for recommendations on nice beaches, anything in particular that's worth doing or seeing while we're out there, whether we should spend more time there, and any food or restaurants that are really worth trying.\n\nAlso I've heard we might need to rent a car as public transport there isn't as good as mainland Japan.",

Definitely recommend renting a car, especially since the tourist stuff are quite spread out and take some travelling time.",

                    "comment": "We were just there for our honeymoon. We were lucky enough to have a portion of our trip paid for so decided to spring for extreme luxury.\n\nWe stayed at Halekulani. After all the resort fees it was about $1000 USD per night. We were staying in the sunset wing and added Club Lounge access to our stay. It was worth it for us.\n\nThis is a 5 star resort at it's best. They provide super comfortable unisex beach coverups, luxury bath towels, a beach bag, flip flops, room slippers. Basically everything. There's staff at each pool and the beach area that will set up and deliver towels and waters to you. All the pools and the beach have lounge chairs with shade. Each room has a lovely patio with a lounge chair. Each room has a rainfall shower with enclosed bath (ours had a view of the ocean from the bath).\n\nI highly recommend the club lounge access. They have a breakfast buffet which is delicious. Midday snacks are probably the lightest and least delicious but totally fine. The cocktail hour buffet was more then enough food for dinner for us and also delicious. The biggest perk for this though is free unlimited alcoholic drinks at the club lounge which includes champagne all day and beer/wine/spirits/cocktails in the evening. We also got a free mini bar with beers, teas, and juices.\n\nThe hotel has plenty of activities you can book on site for snorkeling/standup paddle board/kayaking/etc. \n\nAll that said, this still was not a Hawaii beach. There's limited netted off swimming areas and locals strongly encourage you to stay in those. Our whole stay I only saw two small groups snorkeling independently outside the netted areas. \n\nWe had two dinner reservations during our stay, both at the hotel. House Without a Key was fine, but not worth the price. Kingdom was very expensive but also very delicious.\n\nWe had a rental car with the Nissan rental company at the airport which was very easy and had English instructions as well. We weren't too adventurous with the driving. Just to/from the hotel and a trip up to the aquarium and a few nearby areas. Google did a great job with navigation and express roads were easy to take. Overall, driving wasn't too bad but we didn't drive downtown in any city areas. \n\nBut, I'm not sure a rental car is 100% necessary. The airport limousine bus goes to the major hotels and there are tours you can book to other areas from the hotels.\n\nDefinitely go to the aquarium, eat some taco rice, check out an Okinawan glass shop (we really liked Glass Art AI), visit a castle ruin, drink a bunch of Orion and Awamori. But, we mostly lounged by the pool/beach with a good book. \n\nThis was also a luxury hotel stay, I can definitely see staying at a less resort-y place and focusing more on exploring the island. Take the vacation that speaks to you.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nNone of this is meant to be rude.\n\nI am going to discuss this particular itinerary up and not any potential changes to chase autumn leaf viewing because the can definitely change your experiences at various locations\n\nI think you will be hard pressed to sightsee in Kawaguchiko and go to Fuji Q Highland and then return to Tokyo in the evening.  \n\nFor Kyoto, when do you actually plan to arrive on your 5th day.  Unless you are taking a quite early train I think you really only 2.5 days at most.  I think you will find you have a decent amount of activities already for that time period\n\nFor Kanazawa, you might be able to get everything in, it's a 3 hour trip from JR Osaka Station to Kanazawa Station or are you planning to take a train from Nara to Kyoto Station and then go to Kanazawa that night?\n\nI think you will have a very hard time going to Jigokudani and Narai-juku in one day.  They're both more than hour from Nagano Station in opposite directions and you're not even starting in Nagano, you're starting in Kanazawa and need to get to Nagano to then transfer to start going to these other places and then you are ending in Nagano?  In Narai?  In Jigokudani?\n\nI would recommend you add some of your unused days for: Kyoto, and definitely in the Alps.  How you choose to divide them up will depend on your interests.  Matsumoto is a great castle and a lovely city, but I would go Kanazawa to Shirakawa Go to Takayama to Matsumoto to Nagano vs. going from Takayama to Nagano, since you're not going to get to Nagano with enough time to do much if you go directly from Takayama as I believe the first Hida doesn't leave Takayama for Toyama until 11:00 am.  (vs. you can look into a 3 Star bus pass that will go from Kanazawa to Takayama to Matsumoto)\n\nYou will likely want an IC card.  It doesn't matter if it is a Suica or Pasmo, but there will definitely be times you are not using JR to get around.\n\nHimeji Castle is much nicer than Osaka Castle unless you are really into the Siege of Osaka Castle, in which case there are lots of other sights in Osaka you will want to see.\n\nGood luck!",

                    "comment": "Hi! Thanks for the response.\n\nI will answer all of our questions.\n\nFirstly, I agree with what you said about Kawaguchiko and Fuji Q Highland. Since one of my days in Tokyo is relatively empty, I can move Fuji Q Highland to that day in order to get a full day at Fuji Five Lakes and Kawaguchiko. Would you still recommend visiting Fuji Q Highland though? I am perfectly okay with skipping Fuji Q Highland, as it is not a must for me.\n\nIn terms of Kyoto, Yes, I am taking an early train, as I would like 3 full days there at the least. Is that okay? If not, what do you recommend I do?\n\nAs for Kanazawa, I've decided to add an extra day there, so the 3 hour trip does not bother me. As I'm going from Osaka to Nara and THEN to Kanazawa, I might do as you've suggested (going back to Kyoto to catch a train from there), but like I said, I might just go from Nara station through to Kanazawa (hence the longer trip). Or I will change my route by going to Nara first from Tokyo, then Osaka &gt; Kyoto &gt; Kanazawa. What do you think?\n\nFurthermore, as for Nagano, I can start in Narai-juku/Jigokudani instead, spending the day there, and then get to Nagano in the afternoon to stay the night. Then the next day I will spend half a day at Narai-juku/Jigokudani (whichever one I didn't visit the day before) and then go on to my next destination. Does that sound good?\n\nI can definitely donate my unused days to Kyoto haha. However, I am also considering adding a day or two to Matsumoto or Takayama (as you and another person suggested), or maybe even Nagoya? What would you do? I've got some ideas for my route, but what would you suggest?   \nThose tips for my unused days are very helpful, thank you.\n\nAwesome! I will definitely get an IC Card then (most probably a Suica Card).\n\nFinally, the castles. Difficult to decide. Is Himeji a bit out of the way, or would you say that I should add it in? I want to go to some kind of castle in Japan haha.\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nI am excited to see your responses to my questions haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the weird-looking grammar, I typed my response out in Notepad and then copy pasted it here. Haha. Sorry about that\n\nEDIT 2: FIXED!",

                            "comment": "Hi!\n\nagain, none of this is meant to be rude.\n\nFuji Q Highland is probably worth visiting if you like roller coasters.  If you don't like roller coasters, then I wouldn't go.  I meant to go pre-kid, and then after I had a child I had to wait until she was over 10 and over all the height lines.  I'm  planning a trip in the future, though I admit, I like the looks of Nagashima SpaLand more.  We almost went in December, and I am determined to go this December.  I really liked Yuami Shima and my kid loved berry picking.\n\nYou don't have 3 full days in Kyoto unless you have added a day.\n\nYou arrive at some point on day 5.  The first shinkansen is 6:26 from Tokyo and unless you are literally staying at Tokyo Station (or shinagawa Station) you need to include getting to one of those two stations.  You won't get to Kyoto until 9.  Unless you are traveling with just a very lightweight bag, you then need to either find a locker or go to your hotel, which again if you are literally staying at Kyoto Station shouldn't take so long, but otherwise can take a little bit.  You then have  whatever time you finish handling your stuff until the end of day 5.  You the have all of day 6 and all of day 7.  It's a lot of that first day assuming you take that first shinkansen, but if you miss the 6:26 the next train is not until 7:03.\n\nDay 8 you are leaving for Osaka.  Personally, I would go from Kyoto directly to Nara on Day 8 and then when you finish go to Osaka.  You will then have an early evening and day 9 for Osaka and can decide if on day 10 if you finish in Osaka early if you want to head to Kanazawa.  However, I would also plan things around your USJ trip if you are going.  You don't want to go on a week end or a school holiday, aka 11/3 and 11/23\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\\_holidays\\_in\\_Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Japan)\n\nI am confused what you mean by start in Narai.  You mean on day 12 when you finish in Kanazawa leave for Narai?  From what I am seeing Narai only seems to have ryokan and Minshuku to stay in.  Neither is known for late check ins and you are generally expected to be there  by 4-5 pm.  The same will hold true for most of the places to stay in the Yudanaka area.  \n\nPersonally, if it were me and I wasn't looking for leaf viewing (since I've been to Japan for leaf viewing and while it is nice, I don't go out of my way for it because I lived in New England for almost a decade, so I went leaf viewing doing my regular errands..)\n\nDays 1-4 in Tokyo (night Tokyo)\n\nDay 5 Kawaguchiko via bus (night Kawaguchiko)\n\nDay 6 Kawaguchiko via bus to Mishima then train(night Kyoto)\n\nDays 7-9 Kyoto (night Kyoto)\n\nDay 10 Nara via Kintetsu private train from Kyoto and to Osaka(night Osaka)\n\nDay 11 Osaka (night Osaka)\n\nDay 12 Osaka (via train) (night Kanazawa)\n\nDay 13 Kanazawa (night Kanazawa)\n\nDay 14 take bus to Shirakawa go and then onwards to Takayama (night Takayama)\n\nDay 15 Takayama (night Takayama)\n\nDay 16 take first bus from Takayama to Matsumoto ([https://www.alpico.co.jp/en/timetable/matsumoto/r-takayama-matsumoto/](https://www.alpico.co.jp/en/timetable/matsumoto/r-takayama-matsumoto/))  (Night Matsumoto)\n\nDay 17 take train Narai (night Matsumoto)\n\nDay 18 either go to Yamanouchi and then back to Tokyo or straight to Tokyo (night Tokyo)\n\nDay 19+20 Tokyo\n\nIf you wanted more time in the Alps you could on the 13th go directly between Kanazawa and Takayama.  You would have to catch the 5:14 pm Hida from Toyama (about 20 minutes from Kanazawa) that gets to Takayama about 7 pm.  This would mean skipping Shirakawa Go but you could go to Hida no Sato instead, which I personally preferred.  \n\nYou could also cut down on Osaka.  I probably would .  I mostly go to Osaka to see a good friend and I've gone for USJ Pre-Covid.  I currently will not go with the lines the way they are.  I don't have the patience to fight to buy express passes or to wait in the actual lines.\n\nI am unsure there will be snow in jJgokudani in November and I am unsure the snow monkeys are worth seeing if there is no snow.  If you just want to see monkeys, you can do that in Kyoto.  The monkeys are not going to want to go in the onsen unless it is cold and even then, they only go in so much.  I went in February when there was snow and slush (and lots of snow in Shiga Kogen) but there were still not that many monkeys in the onsen, mostly they were just sitting around outside the water \n\nI would not necessarily get a rail pass.  The first potential itinerary your expensive train trips are: Mishima to Kyoto, Osaka to Kanazawa, Matsumoto to Narai (round trip), Matsumoto to Tokyo (an potentially Matsumoto to Nagano, Nagano to Tokyo instead of Matsumoto to Tokyo.)  I do not think it will pay off for a 2 week pass and you are not doing all your travel within 1 week.\n\nIf you change to: Mishima to Kyoto, Osaka to Kanazawa, Kanzawa to Toyama, Toyama to Takayama, Matsumoto to Narai (round trip), Matsumoto to Tokyo (an potentially Matsumoto to Nagano, Nagano to Tokyo instead of Matsumoto to Tokyo.)  I still don't think it will be worth a 2 week pass.  \n\nI would use something like Jourdan to just get the prices and then use something like Japan Guide or just google search to get bus or train schedules.\n\nYou would not easily have time for Himeji but would be able to see Matsumoto Castle which is really nice.",

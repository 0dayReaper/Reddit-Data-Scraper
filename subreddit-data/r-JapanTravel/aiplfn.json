    "postText": "I posted this as a comment on another subreddit, but thought it was worth sharing here.\n\nMy phone was stolen when I was visiting Japan last spring. I speak a little Japanese, but I was seriously relying on my phone for translation, as well as directions and booking hotels.\n\nAs I was walking around the train station hoping to find it and crying, a businessman saw me and with very limited English asked me to wait as he called one of his employees who was fluent in English to help. They were incredible. The lady helped me ask the \u99c5\u9577 and others if my phone had been turned in, directed me to the lost and found at another station, and, once I emailed her from my laptop to let her know I hadn\u2019t had any luck, she and her boss took me out for lunch and had me stay at their office (a fashion company!) for the rest of the day while I figured out hotels and transportation with my laptop. Two other employees treated me to (the best I\u2019ve ever had) ramen and showed me around Osaka that evening, as well as getting me to the hotel I had booked. The boss even lent me his pocket translator for the rest of my trip.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine encountering that much kindness and hospitality anywhere but Japan, but even there it was absolutely incredible. I got their address and sent them thank you gifts once I got back home, but there\u2019s no way I could repay them for all the ways they helped me and absolutely saved the rest of my trip from disaster.",

The businessman and I had fun having short lighthearted conversations with it, and it was really helpful for things like booking hotels that had some unfamiliar vocabulary to me. That particular model was somewhere around $250-$300, but I\u2019m sure there are cheaper options.",

People just seem a bit more at ease there. It's my go to city when visiting Japan. Tokyo, Kyoto etc are all cool but Osaka is accessible and manageable to visit. I've yet to not have an amazing time there. I find it odd that so many people on this sub tell people to stay away from Osaka. I feel like they're missing the point of the city and only look at the exterior of it (which I still think is super nice in its own way).\n\nLast year after the Typhoon that knocked out the airport and the bridge my flight ended up flying into Nagoya instead of Osaka about a week after and I traveled by train to Osaka. There were no tourists in the city. I swear I saw like two or three other people over the span of a few days in Namba. Everywhere I went people kept apologizing for the typhoon and thanking me for visiting. It was crazy and goes to show the level of care people in Japan give to tourists.  ",

I don\u2019t remember ever mentioning the exact name of my hotel in Kyoto to him, only that it was in Gion near  Shijo Dori station. He must\u2019ve called all the hotels nearby to figure out which one I was headed for - I just can\u2019t think of any other explanation. And all that for a phone charger I could\u2019ve easily replaced! Japan and its people are something else, and we could all learn from their example in hospitality.  ",

I caught the flu on my third day there back in November, accidentally locked my key in my hotel room (didnt realize this until I got back), and had had no idea what japanese flu meds looked like. Got directed to a pharmacy by the hotel staff, the pharmacy staff took one look at me and immediately hooked me up with some phenomenal meds that had be back to 100% inside of 24 hours, and the hotel staff had been kind enough to leave a bag on the door of my room wish fresh towels and extra tea while I was away. The hotel manager was super cool when I told him I'd locked my key in my room too, I feel super bad for him since later that night there were some particularly rowdy guests in the lobby. \n\nOsaka is absolutely a 'must hit' every time I go back to japan now, and that particular hotel will absolutely be my first choice, both for it's location and its outstanding service.

My mom always worries a lot about me (she flipped when I told her about the phone), but I just tell her what I\u2019m doing and where I\u2019m going and she kind of accepts it. Even if you do have to go with a group to appease your parents, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll still have an amazing time.\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure if you\u2019re going with a group, but if you do go alone it\u2019s definitely not too late to plan a trip. Most people say the cheapest time to buy your plane ticket is just six weeks out. I prefer to be spontaneous, but even if you\u2019re a planner you should still have lots of time to make an itinerary. Feel free to DM me if you want to know anything about my experiences!",

I really like to get lost in foreign cities and explore them.  \nAlso, being a loner in general, I really dont like to be shackled to a group, especially if it's strangers, and especially if that'd keep me from seeing the places I wanna see.  \nI know I'm missing on some group fun but I'll try to figure out something for the nightlife, I'm sure there is plenty of stuff to do, other than getting drunk with salarymen XD  \nI'm gonna start getting into serious research mode, this vacation is now a motivation to study japanese even harder  \nI'll DM you once I've looked through some stuff, right now I have lots of questions but I'm sure most of those will be answered by FAQ/research.  \nThank you for your help, have a good one",

Also, OP saying this wouldn\u2019t happen anywhere else but Japan shows he doesn\u2019t travel much as this behavior is common for lists of places I\u2019ve been to in the Middle East and even places like Western Africa. \n\nYou all sound incredibly silly. Not everywhere is America and West Europe, people around the world go out of their way for travelers. ",

Also, you realize reporting crimes is really corrupt in Japan as police will talk you out of reporting crimes they can\u2019t solve right? Sexual crimes chief among them. Had an American GF sexually assulted, attacked really, by a Japanese man and they had the same reaction \u201ceh really?! Japanese?!\u201d  They insisted it must have been a Chinese or Korean and she couldn\u2019t tell the difference. When she brought them a name because he lived in her area they said they would \u201clook into it\u201d. Never heard from them again and she lived there a year prior and a year after. It\u2019s also commonplace for police to tell women that they were attacked because of how they were dressed *as they file their report*. Those numbers don\u2019t mean shit to anyone whose been in Japan for more than a hot minute as a hysterical brat crying because she lost her phone getting the Japanese veneer treatment they give to tourists.

I know Japan still has a problem with institutionalized misogyny, probably worse than the US. And sexual assault, most people know train groping is still a big problem, and we\u2019re becoming increasingly aware of the level of unreported sexual assault worldwide, no doubt as much if not more so in Japan than anywhere, especially if police are resistant to recording it.\n\nI lived and worked in Kobe for a time, so I\u2019m not completely ignorant of non-tourist Japanese life. As a woman who has been assaulted myself, however, I can say I felt safer even alone in Tokyo than I have in any other city worldwide. Though I know \u201cbetter\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cgood.\u201d I\u2019m sure most tourists don\u2019t see these problems underneath. But I think the fact that even native (non-police) Japanese find it shocking for a Japanese person to commit a crime indicates the cultural averseness to transgression against a generally polite society. And it seems most Japanese trust in that society as well\u2014consider the concept of \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u304a\u4f7f\u3044.\n\nYou should make a post about this kind of thing. It\u2019s good for people to know there are definitely risks to traveling even in a place like Japan, which we all like to talk about so pleasantly.",

    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019ve been reading this sub for a while while planning our (married couple in 30s) trip. This is my second trip to Japan and will be my husband\u2019s first trip. I\u2019m normally pretty relaxed about traveling but since this is my husband\u2019s first trip, I want to make sure we have more of a plan to maximize our trip. We\u2019re big foodies and love city exploring. Unfortunately when we booked the trip, I was ignorant of Golden Week (and I also regrettably decided to stay in Osaka longer than Kyoto because when I first started planning I read it was better to stay in Osaka and travel to Kyoto.). We are staying one night in Kyoto at a ryokan but unfortunately can\u2019t extend it due to the demand. I did end up finding a room in Kyoto but wanted some insight on our plans before making changes to the Osaka hotel. \n\n**Thursday 4/27**\n\n\nArrive at Narita 3pm\n\n\nCheck into hotel near Ueno\n\n\nFlex: Asakusa/Ueno Park since they\u2019re close by \n\n\n**Friday 4/28**\n\n\nTsukuji outer market \n\n\nTeam lab planets 10am (booked this since it was hyped on this sub but recent posts seem to indicate it\u2019s not worth the hype! We\u2019ll still go and check it out)\n\n\nTosoyu market - depending on time \n\n\nPok\u00e9mon cafe reservation at 5pm (again may cancel in lieu of other activities)\n\n\nAkihabara/Ginza depending on time\n\n\n**Saturday 4/29**\n\n\nShibuya\n\n\nYoyogi park\n\n\nMeiji jingu \n\n\nHarajuku\n\n\nGolden gai \n\n\n**Sunday 4/30**\n\n\nWhatever we didn\u2019t get to do/flex day\n\n\n**Monday 5/1**\n\n\n6am train to Kyoto \n\n\nFushimi Inari\n\n\nIf time: Nishiki Market\n\n\nShuttle to ryokan 3-5pm window \n\n\nDinner/relax there for evening \n\n\n**Tuesday 5/2**\n\n\nCheck out of ryokan\n\n\nArashiyama (Bamboo/Tenryu-ji - would also like to head to monkey park and kimono forest)\n\n\nGion \n\n\nNishiki market if we couldn\u2019t do it the previous day \n\n\nThis day feels pretty packed to me - originally the plan was to check in Osaka tonight but I was able to book a Kyoto hotel - would you say this day is doable to go to Osaka in the evening or should we stay in Kyoto for the evening? (Both can be modified/cancelled!)\n\n\n**Wednesday 5/3**\n\n\nKobe Ishida reservation 11:30 lunch \n\n\nOsaka aquarium \n\n\nDotonburi \n\n\n**Thursday 5/4**\n\n\nIdeally Nara day trip but flexible\n\n\n\n**Friday 5/5**\n\n\nFly out of KIX 10am\n\n\nWe\u2019re definitely more fans of exploring/local flavor than hitting the big sights (there\u2019s of course some). I tried to group based on location but honestly it\u2019s been pretty exhausting. I also didn\u2019t reserve much to have flexibility. Thoughts and recommendations would be appreciated! I feel most regretful of the short time in Kyoto but unfortunately can\u2019t change the Tokyo dates.",

            "comment": "So I\u2019ve only been to Japan once, but I just spent this last Tuesday/Wednesday in Kyoto. Keep in mind Arashiyama and Gion/Nishiki are on opposite edges of the city. So after Arashiyama you will still have to travel a while, probably find a place to eat, wait for food (the longest lines I waited on my entire trip were for Kyoto meals, interestingly) and at least half the shops in Nishiki/Gion are closed by 6pm. You might not get as much exploration time as you want over there.\n\nWe opted to spend the morning shopping around Gion and Nishiki just as things were opening, then spent the afternoon and evening temple-hopping along the eastern edge, ending the night with the illuminations at Kodai-Ji. It was honestly the perfect day. I still got to see gorgeous bamboo forests this way, though we didn\u2019t go to Arashiyama at all so I can\u2019t compare and say if that would be worth it.\n\nEdit to add: I would also stay in Kyoto two nights based on my experience, but it\u2019s not a terribly long way to Osaka from there. Depends on whether you feel like that might be stressful to take a later train.",

It took me roughly 2.5 hours (I was there at peak times, from 12pm - 2:30pm), but let me tell you - the climb up is ROUGH. I'm relatively active, but I had to take so many stops/breaks along the way up, way more than I expected. Signs said it was 233m at its peak, so consider the ridiculous amount of stairs to climb if you do decide to head to the top.",

One thing to be aware of is, outside of the initial goshuin in their goshuincho (unless you bring your own), all of them were on loose sheets of paper to add yourself.\n\nEdit: All of them were situated along the way to the top (with the exception of the Fushimi Kandakara goshuin, which you can get to via a side path near the Okusha Houhaisho. There are a ton of smaller shrines along the way, but you'll be able to tell if they sell goshuin or not.",

Honestly I was easily exhausted on both half days and the crowds in these areas were a main factor. Plus traveling in between could take 30 minutes.\n\nIt also depends where exactly is your ryokan, you might still need to travel from there to Arashiyama.  Bamboo forest and Tenryuji are close but still a lot of walking in between, so it's not like you could visit both in an hour. Monkey Park is apparently a bit of effort to hike. But Kimono forest is just at the Randen station so it's easy to get to.",

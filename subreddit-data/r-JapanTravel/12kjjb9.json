From Sanja Matsuri in Tokyo to Kyoto's Gion Festival to Awa Odori in Tokushima - those festivals have all different flavors and inevitably draw huge crowds of visitors.\n\nSo tell us, what is your favorite spring or summer festival in Japan and what you enjoy about it.\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

The festival starts around 6 PM with a parade of the highest level dancers, lasting a couple hours. After that, the whole city becomes a giant dance floor and descends into chaos until 4 AM. Repeat that for 3 days.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M1OS_yHZ5aQ",

            "comment": "Last summer I used the JR East Tohoku Pass (\u00a520,000/5 days) to go up and basically speedrun almost all of the festivals that happen up there in late July/early August.\n\n- Sansa Odori (Morioka): Dancing and drumming groups, pretty close to what you have in your mind when you think of a 'traditional' festival. Very local vibe, super chill.\n\n- Kanto Matsuri (Akita): This is the one where they balance the bamboo poles w/ [dozens of hanging lanterns](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3627.html) on their hand/shoulder/head/ass/etc. There are demonstrations and competitive judging events during the day but at night is when everyone lines the street and all the lanterns get lit up. Very, very, very cool way to spend an evening.\n\n- Tachineputa (Goshogawara): What if nebuta (those gigantic lantern floats that they parade in Aomori) but \uff54\uff41\uff4c\uff4c? I mean, 25 meters tall, taller than most of the buildings in the city tall? These gigantic floats were a local tradition in the early 1900s, then revived in the 1990s and they are **incredible**, and accompanied throughout the parade by lots of awesome regular floats. Last year the parade route and number of floats were scaled down due to pandemic measures but I would expect things are going back to normal. The city has a [museum](https://www.tohokukanko.jp/en/attractions/detail_1753.html) to house the tachineputa that lets you admire the details from every angle, which I *strongly* recommend. Apparently between April and June you can actually watch them build the floats and participate.\n\n* Nebuta matsuri (Aomori): I only went on the last day which was the fireworks portion - they parade the best floats of the year around the harbor and then fireworks (which were kinda choppy - they kept pausing inbetween sequences because there was no wind and the smoke wasn't dissipating). I would imagine the parade route gets *super* packed as it's the most well-known nebuta-related festival, so you could also consider the neputa festival in Hirosaki as an alternative. Do check out [WA RASSE](https://www.nebuta.jp/warasse/foreign/english.html), the Nebuta Museum next to Aomori Station - it's basically just a warehouse with all of the previous year's floats lit up on display.\n\nDid I get to do any proper sightseeing? No, but they're all beautiful areas, food's fantastic, and there's plenty to do, so A+++ recommend getting out of Tokyo/Kansai and going up north for festival viewing.",

While most other festivals are pretty safe and orderly affairs, Kishiwada has the potential of (literal) death and destruction. Imagine a huge mob of people pulling multi-ton danjiris through narrow streets as fast as possible; danjiri drag racing, if you will. It's apparently much safer nowadays since they are forced to slow down for the turns. It's got great energy and vibe; one of my favourite memories from Japan (Fortunately there weren't any accidents when I was there.)",

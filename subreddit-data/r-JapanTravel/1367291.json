            "comment": "Hi!\n\nThe monkeys in Kyoto?  You will definitely see them, they feed them and they come down even in Summer.  I saw them in June 2016.  The monkeys near Nagano, they are going to be less interested in coming down because they are not fed as much and they definitely are not going to want to get into the onsen.  It's really hot and humid in August, even in Nagano. (And in Matsumoto and Takayama as well.  I went to all 3 in June.)\n\nUnless you can find an onsen to day trip in, there is no place to shower coming back from Jigokudani.  There are day onsen in Yudanaka and Shibu onsen, but they all have specific hours.\n\nYou have 2 full days in Kyoto, and a partial day, I think you will struggle to get everything in on the 2 days you have, but maybe on your first partial day you can visit Kinkakuji?  Do remember, it is likely going to be quite hot and humid.  We went to Fushimi Inari earlier in the day and did the full hike and it just got very warm.\n\nI mean a lot depends on what you want to do in Ikebukuro and how long you think shopping will take other days of your trip?\n\nThe Ghibli Museum doesn't open until 10 and I expect a Sunday during Summer break for the Japanese is likely to be in demand and quite crowded.\n\nI would say more Japanese school break (which is during your entire trip) on top of Obon is likely to affect crowds.",

I might go there instead of Kanazawa. Was it too hot to use the onsen when you went? Thank you for the comment on Obon and summer break! Ill be sure to get tickets to things asap.",

We went in February 2020, so it was snowy and slushy and I am glad we went, but I would not be as keen in the Summer.\n\nI don't know of any public baths near Nagano Station, the closest is probably the sento Kamenoyu, which I found via Google.  You are honestly better off looking in Shibu onsen or Yudanaka onsen, even if you can't then take the direct bus from Kanabayashi back to Nagano.  I think you will have a hard time actually seeing anything in Matsumoto regardless, since it's around 1 hour from Nagano Station in the opposite direction of Jigokudani, which is also about 1 hour from Nagano Station.\n\nI took a direct highway bus from Kanabayashi onsen back to Nagano Station.  I suspect there were more running at the time because Shiga Kogen was open for skiing.  I also took a direct bus to Shiga Kogen, before taking a small local bus between  Shiga Kogen and Kanabayashi onsen.  (I stayed overnight there.)\n\nA lot of people take the private train from Nagano to Yudanaka and take the bus from there though.  Our hotel assumed we were doing so.\n\nI really like onsen and I have limited times I can go to Japan now because I travel with a child in school.  I stayed in the Associa both times I visited Takayama and both times I picked it because of the two floors of onsen.  I went in at night and early in the morning in June.  It was still hot, but onsen!\n\nI like Takayama, Matsumoto, Nagano and Kanazawa, and all have pluses and minuses.  I just want to be clear that all 4 are going to be hot and you will not be escaping the heat in any of them.  (I think people who have not visited Japan in the Summer, think Nagano, Takayama and Matsumoto might be cooler, they are not.)  Kamikochi was considerably cooler than any of them, though we went in June and it rained non-stop.    It did make the heat in Matsumoto feel like a relief though.\n\nNone of them are particularly convenient for going onwards to Hiroshima.  With Kanazawa you take a limited express about 3 hours and then transfer at Shin-Osaka and from Takayama you take a limited express 2.5 hours to Nagoya and then (if using a rail pass) would take a shinkansen to Shin-Osaka and transfer for another shinkansen to Hiroshima.",

So I would save it for another trip.\n\nMaybe consider replacing the Nagano, Matsumoto and Kanazawa section with 3 days in Takayama. You have each access to Kamikochi and its a really nice county town.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nWe are heading to Tokyo from Kyoto tomorrow, and would like to leave some luggage at Tokyo station while we go to see one of the Sumo matches at the Ryogoku Kokugikan. \n\nAre the luggage lockers still available? I know lockers in Osaka / Hiroshima stations were closed off because of the G7 Summit but can't find any clear information if Tokyo is affected as well. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "For the duration of the G7 assume that lockers will be closed at all stations in Japan.  Best to use the luggage shipping/delivery service to send your luggage straight to your next hotel or the airport. \n\nIf you\u2019re not staying in a hotel, you can seek out the baggage delivery counters you can find at many large stations.  Note, in Kyoto Station there is a Sagawa counter but not a Yamato Transport (Black Cat) counter.  Sagawa is the #2 baggage delivery company in Japan.  You can also just search Google Maps for a nearby Yamato Transport or Sagawa office and take/ship your luggage there but the counters in major stations are more likely to have English speaking staff available. When you ship your luggage you pay and get a receipt with a tracking number you can use to track the delivery status online.  \n\n- [Yamato Transport (Black Cat): Find a Counter](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/facilities/)\n- [Sagawa Express Counters](https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/servicecenter/)",

            "comment": "I had to store some luggage for a couple of hours on my final day in Tokyo yesterday, and most of the coin lockers were not available for use in Tokyo Station.\n\nThey had a few temporary storage areas where you could pay 700-1000 yen for people to look over them inside the station, and that situation worked out just fine for us for the couple of hours we needed them stored.\n\nThere will also be a little slip you need to fill in with your name and estimated pickup time for your luggage, likely same day given it only had a time slot to fill in on the sheet.",

At Tokyo, Ueno, Omiya, Narita Airport, and Airport Terminal 2, the suspension will be from April 16 to 18, May 11 to 13, and May 19 to 21.",

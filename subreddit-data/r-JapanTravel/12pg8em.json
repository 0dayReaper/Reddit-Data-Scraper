    "postText": "Hi all! Planning my first trip to Japan this summer and want to just make sure I am being realistic here. Any feedback would be much appreciated!\n\nDay 1 - arrive at Narita around dinner time, get something easy for dinner and spend evening at hotel. Our hotel is in Shinjuku. \n\nDay 2 - \n- explore Shinjuku National garden in the morning \n- Dawn Avatar Robot Cafe for lunch (if we can get a reservation)\n- retro game shopping at Super Potato \n- head back to Shinjuku for dinner \n\nDay 3 -\n- head to Harajuku and Yoyogi Park. Ideally get some fun treats from Harajuku to eat in the park. \n- head to Shibuya for lunch and go check out the Poke Center and Nintendo Store \n- see the scramble crossing, Hatchiko statue and spend sunset at the Shibuya Sky \n\nDay 4 -\n- take train to Kyoto, arriving early afternoon\n- check into hotel (near Kyoto station) and spend some time walking around in the evening to Hokan-ji temple and Kiyomizu-dera \n\nDay 5 -\n- train to Arashiyama. Walk around and check out monkey park. \n- take randen to Ryoan-Ji and Kinkaku-ji\n- take bus back to Nishiki market area for dinner \n\nDay 6 -\n- Take the train to Uji to explore some tea houses\n- on the way back stop at Fushimi Inari\n\nDay 7-\n- train back to Tokyo \n- arrive at Tokyo station and put luggage in lockers \n- mid afternoon lunch at pokemon cafe if we can get a reservation \n- walk around imperial palace \n- train to hotel in Asakusa\n\nDay 8 -\n- check out Senso-ji\n- train to Narita for late afternoon flight home \n\n We\u2019d love to have a few more days but can\u2019t swing it. The one thing I really wanted to do was go to see Mt Fuji in the background of that beautiful pagoda but I just don\u2019t see a way to fit it in. Also I heard visibility can be very hit or miss. \n\nThank you for any feedback! This sub has been so helpful.",

Good luck!\n\nAlso, the cafe reservations you literally need to book like the second they become available if you didn't already know.",

            "comment": "This is a good and well-spaced itinerary. Just keep in mind to allot time to learn the train stations, especially the big ones like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Kyoto stations. We spent a total of 2 hours walking and resting around Shinjuku garden. Our arashiyama took around 3 hours of walking around (go to the kameyama river for stunning views of the river). You may enjoy more time if you\u2019re going to start your day early, like 8 am. Always check google maps and Weather apps for weather in Fuji. We were able to see the Mt Fuji inside the bullet train even though it was a cloudy day. Reserve your seats through the JR reservation ticket office and tell them to book the side that faces the mountain, but beware it might be a busy day and you may have to book for later sched (hikari departs every 30 minutes from shinagawa, unlike nozomi trains that are more frequent).",

Also Yoyogi park is just a park, not a garden, so yes good place to eat outside, but the appeal for me is mostly people watching during the weekend.\n\nDay 4, try to take the train earlier and be in Kyoto for lunch, like in Nishiki market, that I think is better for lunch than dinner.",

Super potato was great but I spent a max of maybe 30 minutes in there, I actually spent more time in the big electronics store in Akibahara, some of the prices on stuff killed the prices in my home country, Australia.",

That\u2019s just my opinion though - it was so calming to go into all that green after the overstimulation in Takeshita Dori.",

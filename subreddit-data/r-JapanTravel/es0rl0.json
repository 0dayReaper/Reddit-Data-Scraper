    "postText": "If you're young, energetic, know your body well, don't need much sleep or have traveled a lot already just ignore my post. I'm more concerned about people with no/little travel experience.\n\nI'm looking at this sub and see crazy itinaries where people just arrive after a 12 hours+ flight, already get busy before getting their first meal, then think they can just go to bed, get 8 hours of sleep, wake up fresh like a daisy and the next day do 5 Tokyo areas in the morning, climb Fuji in the afternoon and party in Osaka the evening.\n\nThere's a good chance you barely slept in a dry and noisy airplane, have 8 or more hours of jetlag, won't be able to sleep well the first few nights and won't be in the mood to get packed in the subway and walk all day counting the minutes because there's still 8 things to do in your daily checklist before you're allowed to go to bed.\n\nThere's no shame to have a first day where you hang around the place you sleep, see a bit the neighborhood, check the local restaurants, buy a take away meal and enjoy it at home before you get an early sleep. \n\nFor people coming from Europe it's also ok to sleep a bit late so you are rested. Wake up at 10 and skip the fish market breakfast, there's still plenty of time in the afternoon.\n\nIf you're old and lazy like me, give yourself 3+ light days and don't be afraid of going back to your place in the afternoon to get some rest or even a quick nap. \n\nAlso if you're more than 3/4 days in a city, having the last day here free so you can go back to your favourite ramen restaurant, improvise, chill in your neighborhood, rest or whatever else you feel like at this moment is a good idea. \n\nYou'll also be surprised how some places are different in the morning or evening, so going back to the one you liked the most at a different time will give you a new experience.",

            "comment": "Jet lag will really depend where you're coming from; traveling East is a lot harder than traveling West.  Flights from the Americas will travel West to get to Japan, and as long as you can keep yourself awake until evening on your first day you'll more or less be fine.  You'll be up early and down early for the first few days, but you won't feel traditionally jet-lagged, in my experience.  Basically what happens is your body perceives the travel day as one really long day and adjust accordingly because going West you gain time, and as a result sunlight, so your body basically perceives the day as \"I woke up in the morning and had a very long afternoon and went to bed at night.\"\n\nFlights from Europe, Africa, and Asia will travel East, and jetlag will be a much bigger concern.  You'll need to take measures against Jetlag and be prepared for a rougher adjustment.  Basically when you travel East you lose time and sunlight, and your body doesn't understand what is happening.  You wake up in the morning, then are awake at night, but then the night is too short and it's morning again, and your body feels like it's having the same day a second time, which you sort of are.  Your body perceives a day like this as \"waaah hgarghhhh what is happening am I time traveler the universe is broken and sleep is dead!\"\n\nBy contrast, you'll have the opposite experience going back.  I'm in the US, so going to Japan is pretty easy for me, but I get pretty bad jetlag when I come home.",

Going to a timezone 5 hours earlier (Europe) is actually much harder to adjust than going to a timezone 13 hours earlier (Japan).\n\n(Just as a reference, distance between New York and Tokyo is almost double the distance between New York and London.)\n\nI was comparing flying from the East Coast to Japan with flying from Japan BACK to the East Coast.",

I also don't sleep much on flights, and I'm sorry to say flights to Japan have not been an exception to that; I usually get about 2 hours of sleep broken up through the flight.  I've never left at 1 am though, so that definitely might help.  Which airline are you flying with?",

Should I do an all nighter to try and ensure I sleep on the plane? \n\nSo i think it depends partly on the time you fly - what time do you board? (For example if your flight is evening or night time for you then you should have much less trouble sleeping on the plane).\n\nUltimately you\u2019ll just have to weigh it up. In the end I decided to just try and get as much sleep as possible! I think I\u2019d recommend that to anyone honestly. Either way, \u2018write off\u2019 your first day don\u2019t really plan anything concrete just in case, but if when you get to your hotel you feel actually pretty fresh and ready to take on some of Tokyo then go for it!

You\u2019ll presumably fly out in the afternoon and land in the early evening. You\u2019ll have a couple hours of energy before passing out in your hotel. You will be up very early though, which is a blessing and a curse. \n\nIn my experience jet lag isn\u2019t as bad as people make it out to be. For me, my worst experience with it was flying to Iceland, which wasn\u2019t a long flight by any means. The first thing I did was go to the Blue Lagoon. That was probably a mistake but it sounded good after a long flight (and it was), but it made me super relaxed and more tired. I felt like I almost fell asleep on our long car ride further down the southern coast. \n\nI think one underestimated thing about long haul flights is blood circulation. I\u2019m a reasonably fit dude and on my flight from LA to China my foot swelled like crazy. I got up to stretch often but I could barely walk for three days after. I highly recommend compression socks and doing stretching on the plane very frequently.",

If your layover is in Beijing, there are apparently showers in Terminal 3 available for about $7 There are also a few lounges you can pay to access (check out the Beijing airport website) ,  but from what I've heard they might be crowded and the wifi might suck? I might give one a go anyway. Best of luck to you!",

I did cancel that flight route - AirChina is giving out pretty sweeping refunds so I talked to Expedia and had them lock it down for me (AirChina has you go through whoever booked your flight to get the refund). Was on the phone w Expedia for almost 2 hours Sat AM but the refund actually processed pretty swiftly after that. I\u2019m now flying AA/Japan Airlines and changing planes in Dallas. Flu or not I wasn\u2019t *super* looking forward to a 12 hr layover in Beijing anyway, so I\u2019m happy w how things turned out, despite the new flight route being more expensive than my AirChina flights. I\u2019m hopping on my first leg to Dallas in about 3 hrs. I hope all of this has settled down by the time you fly! If you\u2019re flying AirChina definitely look at their US website and see what they say about the refunds, in case you want to go ahead and switch things up.",

Japan is chaotic and there's a lot to absorb so feeling like a zombie in the street with luggage there is not the best. I had this experience twice in different countries in one year and it's always good if you have some refuge as soon as you get to the place.

So rhe last 2 times I skipped a day and a night to try and sleep on the plane.\n\nWhen that didn't work out I just went to bed before my flight. Wake up at like 7 in the morning. Go and fly. Then spend the day lightly in japan knowing the crash will come.\n\nFor me it worked out great. I think I crashed at like 9 or 10 pm and fell asleep. Woke up at 5-6.\nSo I took the opportunity to stay in that cycle. Stood up at 6 every morning. Ate 7-11 breakfast (not exactly healthy but it was like egg sandwhiches with yoghurt and maybe some bread or melon pan, and often 2 soft boiled eggs. I'll explain why so much eggs below)\nThis would pretty much keep me going for the whole day. If I didn't eat enough in the morning I would definitely feel it later in the day\nNow why so much eggs you ask and yoghurt? Basically to make sure my muscles recover faster in the morning. I learned from past mistakes rhat you walk a looooot more then your used to at home. \nIt went fine for the first week. Then even protein etc couldn't keep up and I had to plan a rest day or 2 to recover. It sucks but my body isn't that healthy.\n\nBut man is it a different world at 6-7 am in the morning. So quiet\n\nIf you don't care about the night life I highly suggest getting up early\n\nAnd well everyone's body reacts differently to jetlag or long flights. If people plan these crazy itenaries. Make sure you can handle it or suffer the effects after.\nThink blisters, muscle cramps, over extended muscles etc.\nEat the right energy sources(my breakfast wasn't healthy I know)\n\nAlso what a lot of people forget.. And I see it mentioned a lot.\nDrink....enough....water... Stay hydrated.\nI most of the time caught myself with dry lips knowing I didn't drink enough. Or feeling nauseous. \nOne day I had one of those \"oh crap\" moments where I didn't drink enough and didn't eat enough and started feeling dizzy.\n\nAnyway do not underestimate japan. They walk a lot.\nAverage commute is an hour for them to work. With a lot of stations in between. \nI took it easy but ended up with 17000 steps a day. Now mind you im fat and the most I ever walk at my job max is 10000 steps so I overextended myself everyday.\n\nOh..... Well after typing all that the coin dropped.. 2 years ago I had ichiran ramen for the first time and I finished the bowl and what felt like a food coma to me.. it was my body recovering... \n\nAnyway I'll end my big story here. Hope it's of use to someone",

If you don\u2019t have a direct flight across the Pacific, the single best piece of advice would be to use the business class lounge of your airline at your stopover to take a shower. I can guarantee you it\u2019ll be the best shower of your life. \n\nSleep when you can but don\u2019t sleep the whole trip there. It\u2019s pretty easy to adjust on the way out. Go to bed at a reasonable time when you get there. If you\u2019re like me you\u2019ll wake up at 5am your first night full of energy. Use that. Not much will be open but get ready for your day. Take a walk around a few blocks. Don\u2019t try to fall back asleep.\n\nThe jet lag on the way home is worse. My advice: sleep the whole way home. Hopefully your trip will knock you out on the flight home combined with the business class seat.",

Bring paracetamol (you should do this anyway) for in case you're feeling ill once you arrive. If you don't think you'll last until the evening, grab a meal at a konbini instead of forcing yourself to go to a restaurant and feeling terrible.",

This got me thinking more around sakura strategy because we are traveling (overnight flight from London on 27th March) having chosen this time for Sakura obviously but keep reading to \u201cget there early to beat the insane crowds\u201d. My husband and I are lazy on holidays unless we are doing a specific activity like a hike or walk, and we like our rest. I don\u2019t function super well with itineraries that start at the break of dawn but it sounds like, with our flight, we will be in a very good position to maximize our jet lag for the next few days to get to locations early? Did I estimate that right? Not because that\u2019s how jet lag would normally work going east but because if we manage to just push ourselves out and about in Tokyo on that first day during daylight hours and just crash really early, we should automatically be up and feel really fresh in the middle of the night basically. Which means can see cherry blossoms at dawn before the crowds descend. And if we can keep to a similar schedule for the next 4-5 mornings we can keep having early starts...\n\nDid I calculate this right?\nI\u2019m feeling new hope about having a good experience in our viewings!",

Total travel time from our front door to our hotel room was around 24hrs and I didn't sleep an wink on any of the flights. Surprisingly enough when we got there I spent about 5 minutes in bed before deciding to get up and find some ramen, just wasn't as tired as I thought (could have been the adrenaline from all the excitement). After another couple of hours of walking and eating we came back and crashed successfully for the night. Next time we will definitely get a direct flight instead of making multiple connection flights. While we were able to save a bunch of money it seems pretty worth a little extra cash to cut down on the total travel time.",

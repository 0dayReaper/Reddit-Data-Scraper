    "postText": "I've just spent my first 7 days in Tokyo but have done almost nothing. With another 3 weeks to go I'd like to change that. \n\nI've visited all the major locations like Akihabara, Ueno, Ikebukuro, Asakusa, Meguro, Shibuya, Harajuku and Shinjuku. However all I do is get there and walk around. Most of the time I don't even enter any shops because I don't need to buy anything. \n\nThe only things I've *done* are AirBnB experiences (which were great) and @home maid caf\u00e9. However AirBnB doesn't offer experiences in Japan outside Tokyo and I plan to travel to Kansai now.\n\nHow can I make the most out of the rest of my trip?",

Japan isn't the place for you.\n\nEDIT: It appears this thread has been linked elsewhere, because I keep getting notifications from men who don't seem to understand my comment and are regaling me (a woman) with stories of how they scored in Japan. Don't care. Locking.",

Having sex with the locals is an after thought that happens if you manage hit it off with a local when you are at a bar or some place. Don't plan your trip around the idea that you will pickup a local and get to fuck them, you more than likely don't have the money, charisma, or both to make that happen. If you really want to have sex, save your money a buy a hooker at home. Support your local sex worker.",

Something about the culture there seems to include a man moving from his parents house to his own house only after marriage, and a oddly patriarchal and also matriarchal deal all at once, like the guys are kind of useless except for working and the women handle everything else and make all non work related decisions.

The main reason I wouldn't want to be seen with a white guy is because Koreans, like most Asian societies, are extremely xenophobic--especially to Westerners. This is in part fueled by events such as the Opium Wars, Korean War, and Vietnam War, just to name some very few mistakes Americans/Westerners have made on Asian land by simply refusing to learn about our culture(s). As a matter of fact, much of the Korean population still hold a grudge against Americans, blaming them for causing the Korean War. This is in part true, but also a very oversimplified statement of the complicated West-East relationships that existed for much of the 20th century. \n\nEither way, Americans have a reputation in Korea for being abusive husbands who treat their wives as sex slaves in their perverted fantasies, as well a LOT of other negative connotations. So no, most Korean women would not date American/Western men--either because they believe in these stereotypes, or they simply don't want to deal with the stigma. ",

Things won't change until you act your age and not your shoe size, and treat women like the human beings they are. Showing up to hand out candy and expect attention in return is not the way the world works, and if that's what you've been expecting, well... clearly you're just starting to see how disappointing the world can be.\n\nBut hey, don't take my word for it. Try asking around the rest of /r/japantravel. I'm not the only woman here. In fact, there are tons of women-focused subreddits. Pick one. Ask around. Explain that you went to Japan to find a girlfriend without speaking the language or having anything actually planned beyond the first week. Mention how you're now \"wasting your time\" on a trip you planned because you planned it for the wrong reasons, and see what responses you get back.\n\nI'll wait.",

Even then they still have memories of WW2 decimating their homelands and now you have the huge Chinese / NK threats.\n\nIf you're a \"foreigner\" with an asian face, you'll probably get treated like shit. Like some Koreans will get the occasional \"oh, Anyonghaseyo!\" because some famous Jpop idols were Korean but after the novelty fades, you're just another lesser asian to them.\n\nIf you're white, normal people will still probably ignore you because they're scared of fucking up while talking to you in english but people who know a bit of english and have experience overseas will always try to talk to you.\n\nIf you're black, they'll basically just be scared of you unless they're kind of into the whole hip hop thing but they cant tell the difference between Obafemi and Tyrone.\n\nEither way, you're probably going to have a bad time if you just expected people to throw themselves at you just for being white. You have to have something going for you other than blonde hair blue eyes, for people to open up to you.",

A lot of people consider \"going to a place and walking around\" to be adequate for a vacation or for seeing a sight. But it sounds like that doesn't fulfill you. What *would* fulfill you? What do you *like*? Do you want to eat a specific food? Find a specific souvenir? Experience a specific thing (like a show or event)? \n\nFor instance, when traveling, I love food, temples/shrines, tea, shopping for cosmetics and home goods, seeing gardens, and seeing views from high up. So a lot of my activities involve those things. I poke around the areas I'm in for good or interesting restaurants, I visit nearby temples/shrines or ones that are famous in the area, I enjoy tea services, I like to go shopping, and I like having high up hotel rooms or visiting observation decks. Those things all make me happy and are fun and enjoyable ways to spend my time. \n\nIt sounds like you're a bit directionless, so perhaps some research wouldn't go amiss. Assuming you have consistent internet access, I often find it fun to plan my day over breakfast by looking stuff up and plotting a route (that I sometimes stick to, or sometimes don't). Do some really focused googling on the specific region, city, and sub-section of a city that you're in to see what's interesting in the area. Google regional specialties for food, seasonal events, or historical/world heritage sites. Whatever interests you, really.",

Didn't record any of B5 (B4?) because it was too dark for the camera https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5_Crf2OKVI\n\nLevel B1 was an underground shopping street near Shinjuku Station; everything beneath that was parking. I would find a stairwell, go down one floor, walk around until I found another stairwell and repeat. On B5 (B4?) around 12:00am, where it was already particularly dark, all the lights went off so I ran for an elevator where the only light bulb on remained on that floor. Called the elevator and went up to the ground floor, then trapped inside a locked lobby. After that followed several lit hallways, searching for unlocked doors, and ended up in a different wing of the B1 shopping street.\n\n[\"Underground parking lot\" in Japanese on Google if you'd like more pictures](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=japanese+parking+garage&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjimvPBw_TTAhWLgbwKHSVgCBYQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=948#tbm=isch&amp;q=%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%8B%E9%A7%90%E8%BB%8A%E5%A0%B4)\n\nalso /u/krzkrl",

Meet some other foreigners and with some luck you'll probably meet a group that has a Japanese-speaker in it. This can be your entry into meeting the locals you want to meet.\n\nAlso, stop drinking alcohol if you don't like it. They serve non-alcoholic things at bars, too. And no one really gives a fuck if you drink or not. ",

It has a games room, a small museum with big choppers and polished helmets, all-you-can-eat massage chairs, and built-in elevators. There is even a small cafe on the top floor with gachapon things. Don't forget to visit the gift shop on the way out! The views are great; one could command the entire Empire of Japan from such as strategic vantage point.\n\nIf that doesn't float your boat, then there is also the Sex Museum (the *only* sex museum in the whole of Atami) about 200 metres down the hill.\n",

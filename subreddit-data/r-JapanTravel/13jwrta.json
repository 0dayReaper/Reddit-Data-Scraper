After days of research, bewildering planning, trying to accommodate most of fam's interests our trip goes like this:\n\n|21-05-23 - Day 1: Tokyo to Osaka|\\&gt; Konnichiwa/Narita Airport Arrival &gt; JR activation and travel to Osaka stay &gt; Dotonbori Walk &gt; Tombori River Cruise &gt; Shinsaibashi-Suji and Don Quijote shopping|\n|:-|:-|\n|Day 2: Osaka|\\&gt; Universal Studios|\n|Day 3: Osaka|\\&gt; Osaka Castle &gt; Round One Stadium &gt; Sumiyoshi Tasisha Shrine &gt; Shinsekai night walk, shop &gt; Tsutenkaku Tower &gt; Biliken Shrine|\n|Day 4: Kyoto|\\&gt; Fushimi Inari Taisha &gt; Kiyomizu-dera &gt; Samurai Museum &gt; Nishiki market|\n|Day 5: Kyoto|\\&gt; Arashiyama Bamboo Forest &gt; Kinkaku-ji &gt; Nijo Castle &gt; Hanamikaji Street|\n|Day 6: Kobe|\\&gt; Mount Rokko &gt; Sannomiya &gt; Kobe Harbor land &gt; Nanking-machi|\n|Day 7: Osaka to Tokyo|\\&gt; Namba area shopping &gt; Train to Tokyo &gt; Check in hotel &gt; Exploring|\n|Day 8: Hakone|\\&gt; Day tour to Mount Fuji|\n|Day 9: Tokyo|\\&gt; Disney Sea|\n|Day 10: Tokyo|\\&gt;Scramble Crossing &gt; Shibuya Shopping &gt; Shibuya Sky Deck|\n|Day 11: Tokyo|\\&gt; Team Lab Planets &gt; Doremon Square &gt; Gundam statue &gt; Ginza district shopping &gt; Akihabara electronic street|\n|Day 12: Tokyo|\\&gt; Sensoji Temple &gt; Nakamise shopping street &gt; Dempo in Dotti &gt; Orange Street &gt; Sumida Park &gt; Tokyo Sky Tree &gt; Akihabara electronic street &gt; Pack-up/Sayonara to Japan next morning|\n\nAdditionally,\n\n\\&gt;We have purchased JR Green pass for 7 days.\n\n\\&gt; We have booked a homestay in Osaka close to Imazato subway for first 7 days  and a hotel in Tokyo close to Akasaka-mitsuke metro station for rest days.\n\n\\&gt; Food and eateries we plan to explore roughly include- [Food and Restaurants](https://manasrr.notion.site/a8308205ec9946be8dd9952c57b680ea?v=2e0ce0bf5e9e437d9cd47cbce049d3fc)\n\n\\&gt; Most of our main travel routes and prices are in this link - [Local Travels](https://manasrr.notion.site/78e30419e6e045a5bc758e94aef1e2f1?v=ae71ec398c29429bb876d84ee9790c7c)\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Its been most perplexing trying to plan the travel in especially in Kansai regions trying to evaluate multiple routes, costs, making most of JR, value of passes vs individual tickets. From looks of areas would taking any discount pass in any area/train be of value for our group?\n2. Would JR green pass be of any advantage for the Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe travels and that our group can be together most of the time? Rush hours timings to avoid?\n3. How many IC cards would be ideal for us to travel/shop? Would Kansai One Card be worthy?\n4. How is Pasmo commute IC pass different from regular IC pass and do every person need it?\n\nLastly any general advices, itinerary suggestions/changes or food/restaurant suggestions?\n\nGrateful for all the good work on the sub and all your views would be beneficial for us and others too we hope.\n\nThanks in advance for your time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nHakone and Kawaguchiko (Fuji Five Lakes) are two different places.  They are quite a distance apart by bus or rental car.  Which one are you visiting on Day 8 because I don't think you are doing both unless you paid for some sort of special tour.\n\nEveryone needs their own IC card.  Which one you get depends on where you get it from and if you plan to go back to Japan.  There are certain tourist attractions you either need to take a private line or subway from or walk some distance because they're just not near a JR Station (like Kinkakuji in Kyoto.)  Any sort of commuter pass you don't want because they are meant for people who regular commute a route.  If you get the card in Tokyo, it is likely to be a Suica or Pasmo, unless you get a Welcome Card and then make sure to just use it to 0 before you leave.\n\nI would not get a Kansai One Card because it is only good in Kansai and you will need to either save it for a future trip or refund it and then get a second card within Tokyo.  You can't get to Teamlab, Skytree or Asakusa via JR.  If you want a special card for tourists get a Welcome Suica since  it is valid in Kansai still.  The \"benefits\" of the Kansai One Card seem limited at best.  \n\nIt can be hard making various discount passes work.  They can be great deals but they are also restricting and you need to be sure it will work for you.  Unless I know a pass works with my trip ahead of time, I prefer just using an IC card.",

No one wants to travel with heavy baggage.. don quijote needs to be like around at the end because they offer cheap products in one place, it is like souvenir shopping. But I can see your tokyo day is like, crazy full, just be warned though, you will be overwhelmed by choices.\n\nDay 3, 6, 11 and 12 seems too full. Moving with 12 people will be slow, expect not to be able to hit everything and prioritize which one the group really want\n\nIf you land in tokyo, I suggest to buy suica or pasmo, both are good. If you didn't buy it in tokyo and wanna buy it in osaka, you need to look for icoca. They are all good. Icoca can give some discounts on attractions around osaka (and kyoto I think?)\n\nYou need 1 ic card (pasmo / suica / icoca) per person. When you go in, you will tap your ic card. When you go out, you will gonna tap it again. It will calculate the distance and pricing that way.\n\n\n*Remember, you can use jr pass for train from airport to tokyo station, it is called narita express.",

            "comment": "Day 1, unless you are arriving at the crack of dawn seems a lot.  Narita to Osaka is at least 4 hours by train.  It'll take you time to clear customs after arrival and get your bags as well.  Especially if you squeezing in USJ on your first full day I wouldn't schedule anything more than check in to the hotel and grab dinner on Day 1 after you arrive to be honest.  \n\n\nDay 6 (Kobe) is also a bit to squeeze in to one day since going up to Mt. Rokko will take awhile and is not super close to there other parts of Kobe.\n\nThe rest of it seems possible if you are an active group, but could be a bit much if there are older/slower/young kids in the group.\n\nOne thing to consider in a few of the places is splitting into smaller groups and doing different sub activities based on interest separately in a few locations.  \n\nAnd yeah, getting seating for 12 at most places is going to require reservations or splitting into smaller groups as well.",

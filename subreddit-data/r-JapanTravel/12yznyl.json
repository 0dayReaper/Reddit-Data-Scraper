    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy wife and I will be going on a 16 day trip to Japan soon. Likely travelling to smaller places as well so cash is going to be important to us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few questions as I'm still not quite clear on the answer yet despite reading through the posts.\n\nComing from Canada, I have a Scotiabank Passport Visa meaning no extra exchange fee. However the rate is for every 1000 CAD to 94,640 JPY wheras when I look on google the current rate is 1000 CAD to 98,160 JPY.\n\nI was wondering:\n\n1. How would a Wise card work? Would it be much cheaper? Is it just one card ie the Wise debit card or is there a credit version as well?\n2. Looking at the Wise thing- there's a Wise account and a Wise card? Are they different?\n3. How is the Wise card different from using my own Visa? Just better exchange rate? I see Wise debit for 1000 CAD is 97,664 JPY.\n4. What about withdrawal from ATMs or just paying with the card? Are there extra fees involved? I think if I use my CC then i'll be charged a cash advance fee?\n5. How is the actual exchange rate in Japan and where can I find that information? Is it better than the Wise card?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think ideally I would want to carry a debit card to hold some money, and then carry limited amount of cash on me? I don't mind just carrying all cash as I still find my bank exchange rate to be fairly high (so prefer to not use the cc, unless there are better reasons for using it)\n\nThoughts? Thanks everyone!",

            "comment": "Remember when you check the Internet, the official exchange rate is something that you will never get no matter how you exchange your money. That's how banks etc. make money. You get fewer yen than the official rate, and conversely people with yen get fewer Canadian dollars. \n\nGenerally speaking, you will receive a better exchange rate when you exchange your money in the country whose currency you want. So for you, it's better to exchange in Japan than in Canada. \n\nDoesn't your bank ATM card work in Japan? Is it part of the Plus system? That would be the best way to get a little bit of cash, however just use your credit card as much as possible, assuming it doesn't have any foreign transaction fees. \n\nPut a Suica card in your smartphone and add money to that. \n\nThere's a lot of BS about Japan being a cash country. Seriously I live here, and I can't remember the last time I used cash. Really",

I brought a little bit of yen with me, but for the most part used my Wise card for the entire trip.\n\nLooking at my transaction logs, it looks like I was charged around 3000 yen in ATM fees. For all the convenience, I am more then willing to pay for the fees. During previous trips I was always calling around trying to find out who had the best exchange rate and then would need to drive around town exchanging my money into yen. The fact that Wise offers mid market rates was a huge win for me. I also liked the fact that since it acts like a regular bank account, you can make regular transfers. In fact I set it up with my work that a small amount of my paycheck goes into my Wise account every week so that I can save up for my next trip. Whenever I did need yen, I just found a 7-11 ATM which seem to be everywhere in the big cities like Tokyo or Osaka. However I noticed more and more businesses accepting credit cards, so I always tried that first since Wise doesn't charge any fees when using it as a debit card.",

Exchanged 1500 cad to 149759 yen, that include a 8,20$ fee from wise, on April 18 if you want to compare to market rate.\n\nGetting cash costed 272 yen for wise fee plus the atm fee of 220 at 7eleven for getting 50 000 yen.\n\nYou open an account then order the card., you can also add it to your apple wallet. \n\nExchanging physical money won\u2019t get you a better rate, just check and exchange in Canada would be the same similar deal.\n\nNo difference between using my bank visa or wise visa\u2026 appart from the fact I have better rate and can decide to exchange when the rate is good.",

            "comment": "Wise has a funny thing where they start charging a higher fee if you exceed a small monthly amount of cash withdrawn. I ruled it out because that limit is impractically small for a country that still relies on cash payments like Japan. \n\nAre you able to get a card that charges no fee and uses the Visa or mastercard exchange rate? [Looking at their site](https://www.visa.com.au/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html) it looks like they currently give you 99.4 yen per 1 CAD.\n\nI recently got back from Japan, and when I double check the Visa site against my actual exchange rate, both match up. (I'm from Australia)",

            "comment": "There is a feature that Wise may be more advantageous than cc is that you can pre-fx and hold those JPY in your Wise wallet - this served me extremely well back in late 2022 when JPY was really weak. Once you have JPY in your wallet - your cc charges in JPY will deduce out of that JPY balance in your Wise wallet.\n\nOutside of that, the Wise rate typically is (marginally) better than normal cc rate.",

            "comment": "Why are you changing hotels mid stay In Tokyo? Is it a points thing or do these two hotels offer some specific aesthetic you want to experience? Your itinerary shows you are willing to travel some distance to get places on public transit. Seems like a wastes of time/energy to me packing up, checking out, transporting luggage, checking in again\u2026",

                    "comment": "its fairly new but its shit compared to the other daiwa establishments. prices are similar to the rest of their other hotels but you get so much lesser in return. you cant store your luggage at the reception area (usually useful on the last day for last minute shopping), you have to collect the amenities at the ground floor etc. quite far from the train station too, you have to figure out which exit from ikebukuro or else its a long trek. and trust me, packing and shifting to a new hotel is something you wouldnt want to do when you dont need to.",

Former obubu intern #142 here, glad to see you visiting Obubu for a tea tour! \n\nThis is currently the busiest time of the year for them, but also the most beautiful time of the year for the tea fields, hope you enjoy all the teas you'll get to taste on the day \ud83d\ude01\n\nMy one advice is, try to arrive in Wazuka earlier than expected, (by 30mins to 1hr), so unless if you plan on going by taxi, make sure you don't miss the 10am bus from Kamo to Wazuka! For your luggage if you're carrying any, you can either bring them to Obubu, or just keep them in the locker at Kamo station (if by bus)\n\nOther than that, if you need any further information after your tea tour, you can ask Obubu Instagram or ask me here \ud83d\ude01 (you can find me and my fellow co-interns on the top left of the wall of fame \ud83d\udc40)",

Also, feeding the monkeys at the top of Arashiyama monkey park &gt; bamboo forest (plus killer views of all of Kyoto!). Bamboo forest was a let down for me and my group because it feels more like a patch of bamboo than a full forest.\n\nFushimi Inari is incredible and totally worth the hike up and down. I will say that the experience changes depending on time of day. The mood and color of going early in the morning at sunrise is very different from late morning when people show up and the sun is really out. My photos are more muted because of going at 6am, but I got some really rare shots of a single gate being lit up by a break in the trees while the sun rose. Also had privacy being up early! No photobombers. Something to consider!",

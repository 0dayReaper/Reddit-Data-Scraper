    "postText": "Hello everyone! This will be my (M22) second time in the country and my friend\u2019s (M22) first. My first trip to Japan was a guided tour during high school, so obviously this one will be a lot more self-directed. This will start in mid-June going into early July. We plan to each bring a large, carry-on sized travel backpack for easier transport.\n\nDue to some scheduling conflicts, I\u2019ll spend the first five days of this trip on my own before my friend arrives for the remainder. Not the original plan but it leaves me with a good opportunity to use the first few days to travel solo for my first time.\n\nReally wanted to use a lot of trains.\n\n**DAY 1 - NARITA \u2192 TOKYO**\n\n4:15 pm \u2013 On my own at this point, arrive at NRT and retrieve a 1-week JR Pass with activation the next day. Arrive in Shibuya and get to the hotel.\n\n**DAY 2 - TOKYO**\n\nLikely just a rest day to adjust to the time zone and get familiar, using the JR Pass on the Yamanote Line to explore. No real definite plans. Staying another night in Shibuya.\n\n**DAY 3 - TOKYO \u2192 KUROBE GORGE \u2192 TOYAMA**\n\n7:52 am \u2013 Take the Hakutaka shinkansen from Tokyo to Kurobe.\n\n10:24 am \u2013 Arrive in Kurobe-Unazukionsen Station.\n\nHead east on the Toyama Main Rail Line to Kurobe Gorge and use the railway to tour through the gorge and back. Get back to the shinkansen station, then take the next available Hakutaka to Toyama Station where the next hotel will be. Will probably look out for nearby attractions like Toyama Castle or the Glass Art Museum.\n\n**DAY 4 - TOYAMA \u2192 NAGOYA \u2192 HAKONE**\n\n7:58 am \u2013 Catch the Hida train in Toyama Station for a long scenic ride to Nagoya with no transfers.\n\n12:04 pm \u2013 Once arrived in Nagoya Station, visit the observation deck on the Sky Promenade or Mirai Tower, but leave plenty of time to get back to the station.\n\n2:38 pm OR 3:31 pm \u2013 Leave on the more convenient eastbound shinkansen, either Kodama or Hikari, respectively.\n\nArrive at Odawara Station sometime in the late afternoon. From here, take the local Hakone Tozan Line up towards Hakone and find the booked accomodation.\n\n**DAY 5 - HAKONE**\n\nSightseeing day with no set times. Will do the \u201cHakone Loop\u201d, using the local cable cars and other transportation. Weather depending, go up the ropeway to Mototsumiya Shrine atop Mount Hakone. Might not be worth it if the view of Fuji is obstructed.\n\n**DAY 6 - HAKONE \u2192 KAMAKURA \u2192 NARITA (FRIEND ARRIVES)**\n\nLeave in the morning and head to Kamakura for the day. Will eventually end up at Ofuna Station and take the Narita Express back to the airport.\n\n4:15 pm \u2013 Friend arrives at NRT and I aim to be there by then waiting for him in the correct terminal. He won\u2019t be getting a JR Pass, we've worked out the potential costs and it won't be worth it for him. Will be staying close to Narita Station for the night.\n\n**DAY 7 - NARITA \u2192 CHIBA \u2192 TOKYO \u2192 SUNRISE EXPRESS**\n\nFrom Narita Station in the late morning, we\u2019ll go to Chiba Station. From here, we\u2019ll check out the hanging monorail and get lunch before using the Keiyo Line to get to Tokyo Station. We\u2019ll pick up our prepurchased tickets for the Sunirse Izumo and store our bags in coin lockers.\n\nTime and weather depending, we\u2019ll take a walk to the Imperial Palace and other surrounding areas while keeping close to the station. Might make a short trip to Akihabara for arcades, stores, etc. before returning.\n\n9:50 pm \u2013 The sleeper train, Sunrise Izumo, departs from Tokyo Station for an overnight trip.\n\n**DAY 8 - SUNRISE EXPRESS \u2192 YASUGI \u2192 MATSUE** \n\n9:13 am \u2013 Step off the train at Yasugi Station. With half of the day until check-in at our hotel, we will visit the Adachi Museum of Art using the free shuttle from the station.\n\nHead back to Yasugi Station and get to Matsue Station mid afternoon, where the hotel is nearby. Apparently as a foreigner, discounted bus tickets bound for Hiroshima can be bought with Ichibata Travel service in the station. Don\u2019t really want to leave buying tickets until this moment because I\u2019m not too sure if the bus(es) would be booked up, so it might be worth buying the regular price online then refunding it once the discounted ticket is bought, just for insurance.\n\nMy 1-week JR Pass expires at the end of the day.\n\n**DAY 9 - MATSUE**\n\nThis day is to rest and sightsee. We can take our time exploring Matsue using a tourist bus called the Lakeline Bus that goes to many points of interest around the city.\n\n**DAY 10 - MATSUE \u2192 HIROSHIMA**\n\nTBD am \u2013 The express bus from Matsue Station to Hiroshima Station will depart.\n\nTBD pm \u2013 Arrival in Hiroshima three hours later.\n\nPick up the discounted tickets for the Sanyo Shinkansen (likely bought through Klook) before heading to the hotel. After checking in, possibly visit the nearby Hijiyama Park and the museum in it.\n\n**DAY 11 - HIROSHIMA / MIYAJIMA**\n\nDay trip to Miyajima. Possibly explore the nightlife later on in Hiroshima in the Hondori/Nagarekawacho area. \n\n**DAY 12 - HIROSHIMA \u2192 OSAKA**\n\nAfter checking out of the hotel, head back to Hiroshima Station to store luggage in the coin lockers we take the shinkansen later. We\u2019ll then visit the Atomic Bomb Dome along with the nearby Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Hiroshima Castle if there\u2019s still time.\n\nTBD pm \u2013 Using the Sanyo Shinkansen one way ticket, take an early/mid afternoon ride to Osaka. Departure time depends on what tickets are picked up earlier using the voucher.\n\nUpon arriving in Shin-Osaka Station, get to the hotel first then explore the Dotonbori area as it is close by.\n\n**DAY 13 - OSAKA / NARA / KYOTO**\n\n9:15 am \u2013 Aoniyoshi train to Nara first, then Kyoto for a day trip. Probably the bullet train for the way back. \n\n**DAY 14 - OSAKA**\n\nMainly an Osaka exploration day. Osaka Castle, Umeda Sky Building, Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan are a few places we wanted to visit. Still considering just doing Universal Studios for the day instead.\n\n**DAY 15 - OSAKA \u2192 TOKYO**\n\nTBD am \u2013 From Osaka Station, board daytime bus enroute to Tokyo. Departure time unknown, will book once available. Approximately a 9 hour ride, though it\u2019s mucher cheaper than the shinkansen and it\u2019s a chance to rest.\n\nTBD pm \u2013 Arrive at Tokyo Station and use the Yamanote Line to get to our hotel. Near the Tokyo Tower.\n\n**DAY 16 \u2013 DAY 18 - TOKYO**\n\nNow that we\u2019re back in Tokyo at this point, we do have more activities planned though there\u2019s no more huge journeys ahead of us. \n\nI realize that this seems a bit barebones compared to other detailed itineraries I\u2019ve seen around this sub but we were mostly concerned with our transportation, we can find things to do once we\u2019re where we want to be. We\u2019ve tried to include a variety of different transport because it\u2019s something we find so fascinating about Japan and we need to get it right, though we can be very flexible. The Sunrise Express is the one thing we probably can\u2019t miss because it\u2019ll be difficult/expensive to get to Matsue otherwise. Looks like tickets are easy enough to get in advance online though. \n\nI\u2019d really like to know how doable this is, because I\u2019ve never planned something like this. For this trip, are there any forms of transportation that would be more convenient and/or cheap? Except for the Hida, I realize it\u2019s probably the longest route I could take to get to Hakone but I hear it\u2019s worth the time. And any recommendations for stuff to check out in each location would be awesome!",

            "comment": "Out of curiosity, why a daytime Osaka-Tokyo bus? The night buses might be a couple of thousand more than the daytime, but when you factor in the one night hotel savings it should come out ahead to do a night bus. It'd also give you an extra day in either Osaka (for USJ? or two day trips - one each for Kyoto and Nara, I don't think you can do them together) or Tokyo.",

    "postText": "**This discussion thread has been set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel. Please stay civil, abide by the rules, and be helpful. Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* For travelers entering the country on or after April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)). The COVID/quarantine section of Visit Japan Web has been removed.\n* Tourists entering Japan should still have their Immigration process and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration and a QR code for Customs, which can smooth your entry procedures.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

One of the reasons is that the models sold in Japan also tend to be made in Japan, whereas buying them outside the country, you may get a model made in Thailand or China.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in used cameras, that might be better for deals.",

Both regions have pros and cons for me:\n\nHakone pros: easier to get to, less travel time. Pirate ship. Views of Fuji. Open air museum. Close to Atami. Nice onsen. Quicker trip to takayama\n\nHakone cons: more touristy and crowded\n\nNagano pros: less touristy and crowded. Possibility of nice autumn colors. Mountains. Snow monkey park. Matsumoto castle. Nature, hikes, nice onsen. Trip to Takayama includes some travel on the Sea of Japan\n\nNagano cons: more travel time, monkey park and Matsumoto castle are kind of far, longer to takayama\n\nWho has been to both and what are your thoughts? Thanks so much!!!",

                    "comment": "Having been to both, I'd pick Nagano.  As u/tribekat said, you can take a direct bus from Matsumoto to Takayama.  And if you want to use a JR Pass and you have spent the time finding out when the trains from Toyama to Takama are running (there are 8 a day, 4 express and 4 locals, so you need to know the times ahead of time) it will get you there faster.  Heck you could even, go to Kanazawa and then take a bus via Shirakawa Go.  It's not the fastest route, but if you were planning to go to Shirakawa Go, kills two birds with one stone.\n\nThe bus is incredibly scenic, as it goes through the mountains.  The Shinkansen between Nagano and Kanazawa is not scenic at all.\n\nSo additional pluses and minuses. (and I want to stress now, I like Hakone.  I am planning to go back during my next trip, because I like Hakone.)\n\nThe pirate ship is boring.  I've been to Hakone several times with my tween and I don't do the pirate ship.  I did it before she was born and that was more than enough.  It's a boat that takes a long time to load up and a long time to unload.  It's not that interesting.  \n\nThere are no guarantees you will see Mt. Fuji.  I have never seen Mt. Fuji from Hakone.  You could see Mt. Fuji, plenty of people do, but it's not like a done deal.  \n\nUnless you are staying in Odawara or possibly Hakone-Yumoto, transit is going to take longer than you think.  It's 85 minutes by Odakyu line limited express to Hakone-Yumoto from Shinjuku.  From Odawara, you need to transfer and then catch an Odakyu line train to Odawara.\n\nIf you're not staying in Hakone-Yumoto, you then need to get to where you are staying.  This can take 30 more minutes or more easily.  \n\nAnd while you can take a Kodama or a Hikari to Odawara, taking a Kodama to Nagoya is a very long trip and there are fewer trains per hour going through Odawara.\n\nI would not go to the snow monkeys in late October, but there should be some nice colors and you could look at: Matsumoto Castle, Obuse, Ueda, Bessho onsen, Togakushi, Zenkoji, you could go by bus to Kamikochi before going onwards to Takayama.  There is a lot.\n\nAnother thing is staying in Nagano City (or even Matsumoto City) is much cheaper than Hakone.  There are a ton of onsen resorts just outside Matsumoto in the highlands or you can stay in the city.\n\nIf it were me, I might do 1 night in Nagano and 1 night in Matsumoto, but it would also depend on where I was going after Takayama..",

Plan as it stands is to travel from Tokyo to Atami to check out some of the fun and wacky stuff Atami has to offer before heading to Odawara for the night, then spend the next day exploring Hakone. We will be staying at a lovely onsen ryokan in Takayama, and probably also going to Gero, so I'm not worried about missing out on some onsen if we don't go to Hakone. From what I see online, lines for the big Hakone attractions are atrocious. I'm not standing in line for two hours to get a picture at a Torii. \n\nThank you for your advice. It would have been very disappointing to get to the snow monkey park and see no monkeys at all!\n\nI'm going to do some more research about Nagano with your suggestions of places to see. Thank you!",

You can get onsen in Takayama.\n\nAlso, Matsumoto - Takayama is three hours by bus, it's more annoying via JR Pass for sure since you have to detour via Nagoya.",

The Yamanote Line is just a normal short-distance transit line that has no assigned seats, much like many other JR lines.\n\nYou might be getting a little confused because the normal JR Pass allows you to get on shinkansen and other limited express trains without a seat reservation _as long as the train has unreserved seating_. Since there is no such thing as an unreserved Green Car, if you want to make use of the Green Car on shinkansen/limited express trains, you need to reserve seats ahead of time.",

It is my first time going to Japan (cancelled trip in April 2020 rip).\n\nI land on a Saturday night at 5pm at Haneda airport and will be travelling to Osaka the same night.\n\nOption 1 - I take a domestic flight to Osaka, using my airline points. Both flights are through JAL. The flight is at 7:15pm &amp; . Will I make it through customs in time, I will need to recheck luggage in, etc.\n\nOption 2 - I take the train.... what train do I take?!?\nIs the jr to Osaka covered by suica cards? Please help, I'm so lost when it comes to this. Im staying at a hotel near universal studios, so if someone could sceenshot the schedule that would be fantastic!!!\n\nThank you all for your help.",

I've had a lot of friends + family visit me in Tokyo over the past few months (+ couple international flights myself) and the immigration line is a complete crapshoot. sometimes it takes 5 minutes to get through passport control, other times 1+ hour. since you're using points (hopefully low / no change fee) maybe I would risk 8 PM, if you booked with cash I would say 9 PM or later departure.  \n\n2. just use google transit directions, it will literally hand feed you the options... local JR trains you can pay for with Suica will take something like 10 hours to go from Tokyo to Osaka (nobody does this). you have to take shinkansen which requires either buying a ticket or getting the JR pass. the other alternative is highway bus which probably takes like 7+ hours but is cheaper.",

Usually, they simply wave you through and don't really care to ask you questions or look at your purchases. I've never been stopped by Japanese Customs on the way out in more than a decade of traveling there. The exception might be if you're buying tons of luxury goods and jewelry. Japan basically just wants to know that you're taking any goods you bought tax-free out of the country.\n\nAs for the US, someone in another comment linked the CBP page which talks about duty-free limits. You basically have a monetary limit for _all_ purchases made in another country (tax-free or not), and if you exceed that, you'll need to pay duty on the amount that exceeds the limit. So if you buy a $2000 purse in Japan, that will exceed your limit, and you'll need to pay duty to the US.\n\nFor most people, they don't tend to exceed the limit, especially if traveling with others (since limits for multiple people in the same party are combined). If you don't exceed the limit, there's nothing to do. When you enter the US, the immigration officer or customs officer (depending on the airport) will ask you about your purchases, and that's where you either say \"no, I don't have that much with me\" or \"yes, I bought a bunch of stuff and need to pay duty.\"",

Both the cruise on Lake Ashinoko and a stop at the Yunessun hot springs is planned although I'm not sure which should be done first. If there is additional time in the day, a visit on the Hakone Ropeway is also a possibility. If anyone can provide advice on a single day Hakone itinerary that would be great, we want to be back in Tokyo likely by 8pm at the latest so we can get back to our hotel.",

I saw signs in Kyoto discouraging that, not sure about Tokyo but I would imagine moving around will be extremely difficult. Just take JR to your hotel. \n\nFor me and my wife our favorite restaurant is Mikawa Zezankyo. We go there every time we visit Tokyo ( if we are able to make a reservation). We will also try a different Kaiseki restaurant when visiting Kyoto. None of these restaurants serve pork.",

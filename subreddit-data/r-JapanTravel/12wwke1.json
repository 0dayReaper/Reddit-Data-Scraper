There should be a Tokyo-wide schedule at the very least, it was what I used to find the \"antique sale\" at Hanazono where we picked up some lovely secondhand kimono obis and cool lacquerware plates.\n\nGood luck with the heat in August!",

I'll check on that flea market, we're very fond of thrift shops and the only ones we've been to is Hard-Off!",

The flea markets/resale booths at temples are still outside, so you'll still be baking in the August heat, however it's not strenuous, and chances are good there'll be delicious street food vendors on the spot as well.\n\nI'm disappointed we didn't have a chance to get to Shimokitazawa, The Suburb For Thrifting, but I feel like Shimokita in August would be hotter and nastier than casually strolling through a temple. Shimokita is more for vintage clothing and maybe music, but you'll find art, dishware, kimono, trinkets, and a wide range of weird shit at flea markets.",

            "comment": "Honestly there are a million awesome parks in Tokyo that your kid will like and won\u2019t be crazy crowded. Just regular neighborhood parks all over the place. Some have really cool or funky playground equipment. Some have sand pits. Go to a park in the morning, then grab lunch, back to hotel for a nap and that\u2019s a good bit of your day! Maybe explore another park in the afternoon! [The Tokyo Chapter](https://www.thetokyochapter.com/) lists and reviews lots of parks. Be sure to stop by a Daiso or similar first and grab some bubble wands for an even better experience!\n\nYou could also go to someplace like [The Toy Museum](https://art-play.or.jp/ttm/), but on a weekend I\u2019d get there early as parents all of have the same issue on a weekend (what do we do to get kid out of the house??)\n\nI\u2019ll also say that we just did a rickshaw ride with our 4 year old and it was FANTASTIC, as kid got to be up high checking everything out and no one had to walk much. The company, [Ebisuya](https://www.ebisuya.com/), also operate in Asakusa. We plan on trying a ride with them in Asakusa some time.\n\nETA: I see you\u2019re traveling in August. Definitely look for fountains or similar in parks so kid can splash around. It\u2019s pretty hot. Or look for indoor playgrounds, but they\u2019ll get crowded as everyone else tries to escape the heat. We love Bornelund in Yokohama, and I see they have locations in Tokyo too.",

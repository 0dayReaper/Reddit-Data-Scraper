Most places open at around 11am for lunch, which could impact your entry to the Ghibli Park for 12pm admission since it\u2019s an hour journey from Nagoya station. If your hotel offers breakfast, you should be all set and pick up food at the park. Maybe grab the Histumabushi for dinner and find a place that does Morning Service in Nagoya if you do not have breakfast at your hotel - Tsubame Bread &amp; Milk was good but could have a long wait if you don\u2019t get there early.",

It looks really cute but it is only accessible by hiking to to top of a hill. Definitely a unique experience. https://s.yelp.com/1dyUhICHhD",

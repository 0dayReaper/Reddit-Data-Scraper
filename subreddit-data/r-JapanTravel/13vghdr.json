    "postText": "I just had my honeymoon (originally scheduled for Jun 2020). My wife and I are in our early thirties. It\u2019s my wife\u2019s first time in japan while it\u2019s my fourth. I\u2019ve benefitted immensely from stalking Tokyo travel reddit and would like to return the favour. I\u2019ll provide some of my tips and observations to the end (skip to the end if the itinerary doesn\u2019t interest you), some of which I think haven\u2019t been mentioned before.\n\nThank God pretty much everything went to plan, and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the trip. We spent 12 days in Japan, most of it in Tokyo and 2 nights in Kawaguchiko. Many people were surprised to know that we\u2019d be spending most of our trip in Tokyo, but I thought it was just fine because Tokyo had a lot to offer. My wife and I aren\u2019t big on visiting shrines or ticking tourist hotspots off a checklist. We don\u2019t shop much, but we did a lot of it simply because it\u2019s Japan and we bought lots of quality-of-life items (not fashion) for ourselves and others. Given how much my wife really enjoyed the trip, I think others with similar interests could find something helpful too.\n\n**Pre-trip planning**\n\n* It was out first leisure trip in years, and my wife's first trip to Japan. I wanted to show her my favourite parts of Japan, and took months trawling through reddit posts and trip reports, watching youtube videos, and just soaking in all the things before deciding on an itinerary that I thought my wife would enjoy. It was almost exclusively planned by me, and I would consult my wife along the way.\n* Other than the hotel &amp; flights, I booked the highway express bus to Kawaguchiko one week prior.\n* Decided on the airport limousine bus to bring us from the airport to the city a few days prior.\n* Studio Ghibli tickets booked one month in advance. There's a good guide available on reddit already. International tickets were quickly sold out, so we used a free VPN to get onto the Japanese site which had more tickets &amp; timings available. Simply Google translate the entire page.\n* Booked a cooking class on cookly months prior.\n* Did Visit Japan QR two days prior. It takes some time, so do it earlier rather than later.\n* Added all places of interests in a Google list, and all food places in another Google list. I tried the custom Google maps at first but didn\u2019t feel the UI was easy to navigate.\n* Planned itinerary based on location proximity, and also highlighted parts that were interchangeable in case we wanted to switch it up (which we did).\n\n**Planning during the trip**\n\n* The Google maps foods list was always just for consideration: if we had time or were craving something. We didn't hard-code food places into our daily plans. But when food was the primary activity (e.g. visiting Tsukiji market), we'd determine to visit particular food stalls. Otherwise, just needed to do a cursory Google review check on whether a random food place is worth eating it. As a principle, we didn't want to spend time queuing &gt;20m for food.\n* I'd plan the next day's itinerary the night before, considering fatigue, interest, and proximity. I would create a brand new Google maps list for the next day, including potential food places.\n\n**Day 0 (Wed) 17 May - Arrival at Haneda Airport to hotel in Shinjuku**\n\nArrived in Haneda late, about 11pm. Clearance was quick but baggage took 30mins. As I wouldn't make my stipulated airport limousine timing, I had no choice but to cancel my airport limousine and take the metro to our hotel in Shinjuku. I tried Apple wallet\u2019s Suica at first. It worked seamlessly but I felt that a physical metro card was just faster so I eventually switched over. We reached after midnight, so do let your hotel know in advance if you anticipate arriving at odd hours.\n\n**Day 1 (Thurs) - Shinjuku exploration**\n\nOriginally planned to visit Tsukiji on day 1, but given that we arrived late the previous night, agreed with my wife to change the plan and spend the first day doing the Shinjuku itinerary.\n\n* Walked to a popular Tsukumen place at 11. Queued for 20mins and it was an interesting experience as there were lines of people standing right behind watching you eat. Wife said it was her best Tsukumen ever!\n* *Sekaido for art &amp; stationery supplies*: My wife does art so it was a haven for her. We spent a few hours there!\n* *Tokyu Hands Shinjuku*: Wanted to look at more stationary/home/fashion stuff but two floors were under renovation.\n* *Omoide Yokocho*: A quick walkthrough of this famous street for salarymen which comes alive at night. Many tourists.\n\n**Day 2 (Fri) - Kappabashi St., Fabric Town, Akihabara**\n\n* *Kappabashi Dougu Street*: looked at kitchen supplies aimed to find a nice nakiri knife! (If you want to buy a knife, do research on what knife you need beforehand).\n* Fabric Town: My wife just passed a seamstress exam so she eagerly anticipated visiting fabric town, we spent a few hours in Tomato.\n* *Akihabara (Animate, Bic Camera, Gyukatsu Don)*: It was drizzling the entire day so it was not the most comfortable lugging that many bags around a wet Akihabara in the evening. Wife wasn\u2019t interested but I wanted to let her experience this unique culture. Had dinner at a popular gyukatsu don (beef cutlet that you\u2019d have to cook yourself). It was our first time eating gyukatsu. It was so tender and juicy and mmm. But it was a long one hour wait. It was after this episode that we decided we were not going to queue this long for food again.\n\n**Day 3 (Sat) - Cooking class in Shinjuku, Shibuya**\n\n* *Private cooking class in Shinjuku:* Our host was great! We were invited into his cosy house and he taught us how to make Okonomiyaki, Yakisoba, and a Japanese salad. I paid careful attention to the menu beforehand as I wanted to learn dishes I could easily recreate back home (i.e. not choose dishes that depended on seasonal Japanese ingredients). My wife absolutely loved the experience of getting to know a local and understanding his life story, Japanese culture, and hearing some of his horror stories of foreign guests. We got more food recs from him to understand where the locals really ate at.\n* *Shibuya 109:* Paid $5 for a drink to have a bird\u2019s eye view of the Shibuya crossing. It was Saturday so the crossing was at its full force. Even if you think this is touristy, it\u2019s amazing to see that many people like little ants crossing a street. There are several nice locations here to take some artsy shots.\n* *Ishibashi Music Shibuya:* absolutely loved the vibe in this music store. Back home, I\u2019d been thinking about getting a particular keyboard but never got a chance to try it. I was able to play this particular one undisturbed and feel like I could go on for hours without any pressure from staff. Bought a few Japan exclusive guitar picks as gifts.\n* *Shibuya Tokyu Hands:* This was amazing. I thought Shinjuku Tokyu Hands was the flagship store. So I only stumbled into this because I urgently needed to pee and someone said Tokyu hands had toilets. We were confused as its name was rebranded to simply \"Hands\" with a new logo. If you only have time to visit one Tokyu Hands, visit the Shibuya one. Each floor had 2 sub-floors so that\u2019s a ton of floors! Lots of quality-of-life improvements one could get from this store. My wife got a buckwheat pillow.\n* *Shibuya Loft:* After Sekaido and Tokyu Hands, I didn't think there was much daily life products/art/stationary to look at. But Loft was very different. Similar to Tokyu hands but seems more modern and fashionable. Worth visiting together with Tokyu hands! It also had packaged food available! It was late and my wife and I concluded that we didn\u2019t have to to explore all the floors and that we\u2019d return to Shibuya again.\n\n**Day 4 (Sun) - Komazawa Church, Harajuku, Shibuya**\n\n* *Church in Komazawa:* not a tourist activity, but we linked up with some partners from our home church and attended service at a little church held in a nursery. It was an amazing and encouraging experience to hear the gospel preached in a foreign language.\n* *Harajuku:* Way too crowded. I had anticipated this as it was a Sunday, but thought to just try. Takeshita street was so packed my wife feared there would be a stampede risk (it wasn\u2019t that bad). We did queue 20mins for pretty tasty crepe. After checking out all the recommended streets (e.g. cat street, uru-harajuku), my wife simply felt that she couldn\u2019t stand the Harajuku crowd and the vibes. So we decided to go back to Shibuya again!\n* *Shibuya JINS:* I didn\u2019t mention this but previously in Shinjuku and Shibuya, I had been checking out recommended optical shops in the vicinity for a particular style of glasses. Japanese-made glasses are highly-rated, but I couldn\u2019t find something at the right price-point. At JINS, I found a design I liked. Though not made in Japan, it cost me less than 5000 yen. Took them 1 hour to make it. For some reason I loved the vibes at Shibuya, and I earmarked it to return again later.\n\n**Day 5 (Mon) - Tsukiji Market, Ginza Muji/Uniqlo, Tokyo station**\n\n* *Tsukiji market*: wanted to arrive before 8 but arrived at 8.30am. Thankfully the crowds weren't that bad yet. Everything we tried was lovely. Potato/corn fishcakes, strawberry mochi, tamago, wagyu beef, uni inarisushi (my first time trying uni - wife loved it but I didn't like it), unagi. But the star was Masa burger (thanks to Paolo from Tokyo), which we waited till 11am to try. By then, the tourist buses had come and the streets were packed. But Masa burger was in a corner and we were their first customers. We tried fried codfish burger + homemade ginger ale. Both were so well done and the fried cod was so crispy yet fresh and tender. It was also nicely completed with very refreshing salads! It was soo good we had it twice.\n* *Ginza Uniqlo/Muji*: we wanted to take a look at some of Uniqlo\u2019s exclusive items. Apparently they do have exclusive t-shirts for each region (e.g. Harajuku, Shibuya, Ginza), which tend to be collaborations with well-known food places in the area. However, they were always white in colour (cheap to produce) and not made-in-Japan-quality. Muji @ Ginza was a disappointment, not a lot more than the usual.\n* *Tokyo Station Ghibli store &amp; Tenugui hunting:* Went to Tokyo station to check out the Ghibli store and to look for a particular traditional tenugui (Japanese towels) store as my wife were hunting these down to give as gifts.\n* *Shinjuku Ichiran &amp; Mister Donut:* We returned to Shinjuku for Ichiran ramen, specifically at 5+pm. No crowds at all. Yummy! We then saw a Mister Donut, and recalled news in our home country that when it had its first opening in my country, people queued 5 hours for it. We thought to try it to see what the fuss was all about. Cash only, but the donuts were wonderfully textured and not too sweet. My wife doesn\u2019t like sweet stuff, but mister donut really hit the sweet spot (no pun intended).\n\n**Day 6 (Tue) - Tokyo National Museum, Fabric town revisit, Akihabara revisit, Ochanomizu**\n\n* *Tokyo National Museum:* We had a good time learning about Japan\u2019s early history, and discovered that so much that we know of Japan resulted from Chinese/korean influence.\n* *Fabric town &amp; Akihabara revisit, Ochonomizu:* We decided that this was likely the right time to go back for items we missed out on or didn\u2019t have time to see. My wife went to fabric town again while I went to Akihabara\u2019s Yodaibashi camera, which I felt to be better and with more varied things than Bic Camera. I then went to nearby Ochanomizu to look at more music and sport shops. We met up again at Shinjuku for another Gyukatsu Don before heading to mister donuts again.\n\n**Day 7 (Wed) - Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, Mori Museum, Ginza Wakamatsu, Shinjuku**\n\n* *Shinjuku Gyoen Garden*: lovely large garden grounds. We spent almost an hour just lying under a tree and watching clouds float by. Wife was doing some rough sketches of the garden. We had mister donuts from last night for breakfast.\n* *Mori Museum:* Saw the exhibition of Heatherwick studios, which was inspiring and educational. Paid for the rooftop access to have a quick view of Tokyo from 50-ish floors up.\n* *Ginza Wakamatsu:* Because of one of the Uniqlo-ginza-exclusive t-shirts, my wife was curious about this traditional Japanese dessert. So we gave it a check and realised it\u2019s been around for more than a century. There was a short line (mainly Japanese elderly). The shop interior transported us back decades. It felt surreal eating a dessert that the Japanese ate centuries ago. Unlike modern desserts, this Japanese dessert certainly doesn\u2019t excite and overwhelm one\u2019s taste buds immediately. But there\u2019s an old charm to it.\n* *Shinjuku Okadaya fabric:* Returned to Shinjuku as my wife wanted to check out another of their famous fabric stores. Prices were more expensive than fabric town, but had somewhat different items.\n\n**Day 8 (Thurs) - Kawaguchiko**\n\n* *Bus to Kawaguchiko:* Packed light to Kawaguchiko, and forwarded our remaining luggage to our final hotel in Tamachi. The Shinjuku hotel staff were very helpful. I was merely inquiring on how luggage forwarding was done, but the staff picked up the phone, called my Tamachi hotel to confirm the booking, and prepared the documents for me. All I had to do was roll my luggage the next night to them and make payment. Took our 7:45am bus to Kawaguchiko and managed to catch a glimpse of Mount Fuji when we were on our way there!\n* *Cycling In Kawaguchiko:* We lugged our bags to our ryokan and headed out again. My wife was quite hesitant about cycling overseas and I was also worried it\u2019d tire her out too much. I debated between cycling or simply taking the sight-seeing bus. Eventually felt that it was worth trying to cycle. We unexpectedly walked by an e-bike place and decided, why not? Neither of us had tried an e-bike before and that could reduce the effort required for my wife. So we did and boy was it fun! It took a while to get used to the e-bike but it really reduced a lot of effort up the hills! I barely perspired at all thanks to the e-assist. Kawaguchiko had pretty narrow roads so it wasn\u2019t the easiest to cycle. But I had plenty of road-cycling experience back at home so I was not daunted. We borrowed helmets from the e-bike place but saw that we were the only tourists that wore them. Yes, I'd recommend wearing helmets when cycling.\n* *Kubota Itchiku Art Museum:* Cycled here knowing that this museum would interest my wife. It had a garden free for entry and it was really quaint, quiet, and charming! The pond had a singular vibrant-coloured Koi swimming in it. Museum entry requires tickets. On this trip, I realised that visiting museums tired me easily. It could be because I spent time reading each description. I told my wife to go ahead as I waited outside. She eventually took 45m in the museum and was so enthralled by it. She even bought a heavy hard-cover book of Itchiku Kubota\u2019s kimono art :/\n* *Momiji Corridor:* was just 50 meters away from the museum. Still beautiful with only green leaves, but I\u2019d imagine it would be majestic in Autumn/Spring.\n* *Oishi Park:* Many colourful flowers! It\u2019s a pity that it had been cloudy the entire day, and Mt Fuji was not visible. That would have made the cycle perfect. Had a peach/plum ice-cream. Park was crowded with tourists.\n\n**Day 9 (Fri) - Fuji Q Highland, Shimoyoshida Honcho St, Batting Cage**\n\n*Planning for Fuji Q &amp; Morning Jog:* I didn\u2019t plan to go to Fuji-Q highland before the trip. Always felt it a bit of a waste to visit amusement parks overseas. That\u2019s until I realised that Fuji Q had some of the most exciting (I mean world-record-holding) rollercoasters in the world. Maybe they don't hold the records anymore, but that intrigued me enough, because most amusement parks only had 1-2 coasters. Problem was that wife is terrified, and she said cycling on the streets of Kawaguchiko was already like a coaster ride for her. Still, I'm really thankful she encouraged me to go and said she was happy waiting and taking pictures for me. So I decided I would reach at opening time, and buy time by paying for the fast passes and try their top three coasters. The night before, we felt that we had to make decisions on our itinerary as it was our last day at Kawaguchiko. If Mt Fuji still wasn\u2019t visible the next day, we'd go to Oshino Hakkai, if it was, we could try going to Shimoyoshida to get a nice picture.\n\n* I went for a morning jog and as the path brought me along the river's perimeter, my jaw dropped when I saw Mount Fuji towering into view. I raced back to tell my wife (about 6am) and we both trekked up to a viewing spot to enjoy the view. This made it more urgent to not spend too much time at Fuji Q as we didn\u2019t know how long Mt. Fuji would be visible for.\n* *Fuji-Q Highland:* Was absolutely amazing. Yes, I blew a lot of cash here buying fast passes for the three available coasters. But they were some of the craziest coasters. Took Eejanaika, Fujiyama and Takabisha. Total time it took probably a little more than 1 hour with the express passes. It was so good, but so fast that I have little memory of it, except that there was a 90 degree climb to the top for Takabisha and I had a beautiful view of Mt. Fuji while climbing to the supposed world record of 79m for Fujiyama (this was 2 days before the news reported that Fujiyama got stuck in the middle of a ride and the people in the carts had to climb down :o). Had more time to take a few other rides, and enjoyed all the Naruto statues around for fun photo-taking. What I really enjoyed about the park was that it was mostly filled with Japanese tourists; in fact, there was a Japanese school having an outing there. It was nice to see excited students running about. If I could spend the day here, I'd take the three coasters multiple times to imprint the sensations in my head. But I'm still thankful I got to try some of the world's most thrilling coasters!\n* *Shomoyoshida Honcho St:* This destination was simply to take the famous street view of Mount Fuji with Japanese shops lined in the foreground. It\u2019s not easy to get to, and there was quite a walk. We noticed there weren\u2019t much people around, and most shops were closed. But when we reached the destination, there were many tourists right at the particular traffic light. So much so there was a grumpy Japanese traffic police person managing the crowd. We saw the worst of tourists that day. People were disobeying traffic laws and just running in the middle of the road just to get a shot. We then chanced upon a hidden udon shop and it felt like we were transported back to the 50\u2019s! It was super old school, people sat on raised platforms, and several elderly customers were watching the tele while eating. There was only one udon option available, with free cabbage top-ups. We learnt that the shop had been around for 73 years. We actually headed back to Fuji-Q Highlands to take a 4D 'plane ride' with Joe Hisashi music in the background. Since my wife actually wanted to ride something, I was happy to agree to her request. Ride was very ordinary but wife actually felt terrified at times lol. Rushed back to the hotel for a private onsen booking.\n* *Batting Cage:* I had never played baseball/softball and my home country doesn\u2019t have a baseball culture. Yet I had seen batting cages in Japanese drama and always wanted to try. Loved it! My technique was probably pretty bad! I did well at first but as I tried faster balls, I tired out and failed to hit any haha. Some teens beside me were knocking out 120km/h balls out of the park! We ended the day eating ramen outdoors with a view of Mount Fuji.\n\n**Day 10 (Sat) - Kichijoji, Ghibli Museum, Kichijoji Jazz bar**\n\nWoke up before sunrise for a run and to attempt to catch a sunrise picture of Mount Fuji. Streets were completely empty. Even ran to the famous Kawaguchiko Lawson for a picture. Headed back for an onsen bathe (note: we never used the room's shower, and always went for an onsen bath throughout our stay in Kawaguchiko as it was just too convenient). Took a 7am bus to return to Shinjuku.\n\n* *Kichijoji:* Arrived at Kichijoji at about 10am. Wife really loved the vibes there. We tried the Tsukuba suisan fish cakes which were really tasty, and my wife was intrigued that a line had formed at the adjacent store named Ozasa. Apparently they sell traditional Japanese desserts and locals would go there as early as 5am to get a ticket. So we queued 15m and managed to get three boxes worth of the snacks! Tried the Amane Taiyaki fish-shaped bean paste snacks, another traditional dessert. It was a small lovely old shop.\n* *Ghibli Museum:* Requires a long walk through Inokashira park. Ghibli was fantastic. Many people have been saying recently that it\u2019s over-rated, and that it doesn\u2019t cater to foreign crowds and most things are in Japanese. We similarly struggled with that at first. But we found out that if you asked the staff, they actually had English language exhibition booklets ready for every exhibition! That was a revelation. And we managed to understand almost all the exhibitions by asking the uniformed staff (except the short film, which had minimal dialogue anyway). I mentioned this to one foreign group and they were really grateful for that. But I saw that many other foreigners that probably came earlier were just bored or simply going crazy at the Ghibli shop. My wife bought the museum book (which also has English explanations of each exhibit), and we understood Miyazaki\u2019s vision for the museum - to make it suitable for kids and adults, with no pre-determined route, allowing for play, exploration, to help people be inspired by the artists\u2019 process. Through that, we saw that every thing in the museum was intentionally designed, all of the exhibitions, cafe, shop, and garden. Reading that helped me appreciate and enjoy the museum much more.\n* *Roaming Kichijoji and Some Time Jazz bar:* My wife and I split up to roam kichijoji. I checked out some sports shops and saw that their prices were lower than Ochanomizu. We reconvened for dinner at Sometime Jazz bar. I\u2019m picking up Jazz piano but had never been to a jazz bar. Booked it one day before, but was sad that our table position only allowed us to see some of the drummer and the pianist\u2019s expression. Still, it was a very hip place for jazz cats and we had a wonderful time. We only sat through the first half of the performance that night. Note that there are seating charges, so that + dinner added up to quite a lot. But we rationalised that this was akin to paying for a performance. Checked into our hotel in Tamachi.\n\n**Day 11 (Sun) - Tokyo Sky Tree, Shinjuku, Back to Kichijoji, Shibuya**\n\nIt was a crazy day where we simply hit the places we wanted to revisit regardless of proximity. Headed to Tokyo Skytree in the morning to check out another Ghibli store in hopes of getting another Ghibli shirt; reason was because I ended up buying one at the museum I really loved  (made in Japan, beautiful colour, perfect fit. I hesitated at first because I couldn't try it). If you\u2019re not going to the Ghibli museum, this is probably the best store available for Ghibli goods. Alas, the museum's items were really quite exclusive. Headed to Shinjuku to try curry udon, then to Kichijoji to try satou beef balls and dangos and to make some purchasing decisions on some sports equipment. Then we ended up at Shibuya (my favourite place!) to the mega Don Quijote and Tokyu Hands to shop for gifts for others. It was a lovely end to our trip!\n\n**Day 12 (Mon) - Back home**\n\nBest trip ever, says my wife.\n\n**Tips for travellers**\n\n* Spread out your itinerary: I originally planned to front-load all the must-see tourist stuff and leave the remaining days for shopping. But in May, Ghibli Museum was closed for two weeks so we had no choice but to schedule it at the end of the trip. That was a better arrangement. It felt that each day was distinctly different, and we could remember the highlight of each day. Also, be specific about where you want to go. Don\u2019t simply put locations, e.g., Visit Harajuku, or visit Shibuya crossing.\n* Plan your itinerary in consideration of weekend crowds: Places like Tsujiki market, Ghibli Museum, Fuji-Q Highlands and other stuff are likely going to be very crowded on weekends. If you want to shop in Harajuku or Shibuya, try to avoid weekends. I opted to put the cooking class and \u2018less-exciting\u2019 Museums on weekends.\n* Carry more cash than you think you need: In my experience, the cash-to-card ratio was about 40:60. Considering that all metro card top-ups require cash, you'll need quite a bit of cash! Sometimes even bigger restaurants are cash only.\n* Bring foldable tote bags, and use lockers where necessary: If you\u2019re buying stuff, packing them in tote bags makes it easier to lug around. Bigger shops will charge you for bags. If you just arrived from one area with bags and are going to explore another, use the lockers. Most metro stations likely have lockers and they are really affordable and convenient.\n* Travel light by planning to do laundry: I only brought four sets of clothing, and we did laundry every 3-4 days or so. It\u2019s really convenient, about 200 yen per 30m wash, and another 200 yen for a 1h dry. It\u2019s worthwhile to check if your hotel has coin laundry available.\n* Buy discriminately: Many people say the kind of things available at places like Don Quijote or Uniqlo are mind-blowing. Fact is, most of them are made in China or elsewhere. About 95% of the items we saw in Daiso were made in China. In fact, many items in Kappabashi street were made in China. You\u2019re more likely to get value for money by buying a made in Japan item. Sometimes the shop will highlight if a product is Japan made. But other times, you have to scrutinise the fine print. Learn to look out for these three words in Kanji: \u65e5\u672c\u88fd. This is where the camera function of Google translate is immensely helpful. This was not available or widely publicised when I last visited Japan years back in 2016, so use this tech to your advantage and scrutinise the fine print!\n* Plan your toilet trips if possible: If you know you\u2019re headed to low-rise areas like Tsujiki, Fabric town where it\u2019s just shop after shop, it\u2019s going to be hard to find a toilet. Make sure you relieve yourself beforehand at the train station. But if you still need to go, try to find a multi-storey building and chances are, there\u2019ll be toilets available there.\n* Avoid queuing for food by timing right: In general, I found that most popular food places that required queuing had queues mainly consisting of foreigners. I wonder if this is because of the reddit/youtube/google maps review effect (not a lot of Japanese review on Google I think). So if you have to queue, there's a good chance you're competing with other foreigners. Simply put, almost all food places open at 11am, so be there at 11, or have early dinner at 5pm and perhaps you may avoid the queuing.\n* Scrutinise Google maps to figure out the different train types: for daily travel, there could be local, rapid, and express trains. Local trains stop at every station. Rapid skips a few, and express trains likely only stops at key location. They make a big difference to travel time, and to your comfort. When Google maps recommends a route, scrutinise the detail to ensure what kind of train they are recommending. It gets confusing at the station as the platforms on your left and right may end up at the same location, but one could be a local train and the other an express train.\n* Learn just 2 essential phrases: It always felt weird for me to speak Japanese because I felt like a try-hard. But this time I did - just learn to say thank you in Japanese (arigato gozaimasu). The other essential word is - summimasen - excuse me/sorry. Useful for if you need to exit a crowded train, or if you need to get someone\u2019s attention. We survived with just these two phrases. As our cooking teacher told us - it\u2019s better to say something in Japanese than say nothing at all. For the rest, you can use Google translate app\u2019s picture function.\n* Other misc tips: as mentioned, bring trash bags. Some shops explicitly tell you not to walk around and eat their food. So the solution is to finish the snack in front of the shop, and say, \u201csummimasen, can you help me to throw this trash?\u201d That helped us avoid carrying trash around a lot. As a traveller, you\u2019re gonna get a lot of carbs (my curry udon meal included a bowl of udon + a bowl of rice...) and fried food. To get more fiber, try the basements of shopping centres and get yourself some fruits. Also, if you exercise regularly like me, you'd be concerned about getting some exercise. I did pre-trip research on pools/gyms/parks to visit. But visited none of them. With what little hotel room space I had, I settled with a daily morning routine of 100 squats and 100 pushups. That and walking an average of 18k steps daily helped. I actually lost some weight somehow.\n\n**Observations**\n\n* Drinking culture in Japan: we saw quite a few drunk people in the streets. Some of them at the parks. I had never really seen drunkards much in my home country (it could be because I don\u2019t stay out late). When we walked by a bar area with our cooking instructor at 10am, he told us some of the people in them had been there overnight. At Inokashira park, we saw a lady dressed in office wear face planted on the ground. Her friends tried to help carry here elsewhere but her entire body was limp and almost lifeless.\n* The Japanese sleep late: when we arrived, we were still on the train to our hotel at 11:50pm. But the train was still packed with salarymen in suits and many others. In fact, it seemed the later it was, the more crowded the trains.\n* Foreigner influx and how we stick out: there were way more foreigners this time than the last I visited Japan. I commented to my wife that I felt more immersed in Japan on the metro or at places like Tokyu hands as I could hear Japanese being spoken around me. But at tourist spots and some museums, I felt like I could have been in any other country. I tended to feel very uncomfortable when large groups of foreigners were around. I had to tell myself not to be hypocritical as I was a foreigner myself. But I suppose one reason is that there were many inconsiderate foreigners. Speaking loudly, making brash comments, and just not behaving like visitors. We saw a foreign couple locked in a head-to-toe embrace on a picnic mat in a park full of families. And they chose a spot right next to the footpath. Many foreigners also leave unkind Google reviews for places just because it\u2019s not up to their expectations. I get it, we worked for our holiday and are paying customers, and there is often an innate tendency to feel entitled or complain when something isn\u2019t up to our expectations. But I think it helps to remember that we are like visitors in someone\u2019s home. Be self-aware, don\u2019t speak loudly, note the traffic customs, where to stand on the escalators, how to behave etc.\n* Japanese men have great hair: the Japanese men\u2019s hairstyle feels frozen in time. I didn\u2019t see the typical Korean-inspired center-parted hairstyles in Asian guys nowadays. And balding men were a small minority somehow. As someone whose hairline is slowly receding, I was envious to see many Japanese men have wavy long hair deep into their 60-70s! My wife commented that the women's hairstyles were more or less the same - dyed, curled etc. But the men were rocking so many styles!\n* In-person shopping still matters: as the days went by and as my wife and I began to covet the \"made-in-Japan\" label, we realised that we hadn't done such shopping in years since online shopping became prevalent. I also recall people commenting that you could get these goods online anyway, so why bother shopping in Japan. Well, physical shopping makes comparison easy, it allows you to ask for recommendations, and enables you to know the items's size, feel, and look on you (if buying fashion items). It also makes discovery of new items possible. I'm not a huge shopper or a foodie, but in Japan, it's worth it to be one simply because the Japanese are thoughtful about their craft and tend to produce quality that's quite unmatched. I suppose it's a blessing in disguise that our honeymoon got delayed 3 years, as we are now well-aware of our post-wedding lifestyles and the items we'd need in the kitchen/around the house.\n* Reading culture is strong: in a week when I read reports that leisure reading had declined in my home country, I was pleasantly surprised to see many people reading hard-copy books on the train, many of them even had personalised leather book covers. Kinokuniya was also teeming with life. As a bookworm, this is a great encouragement. And I wish English language books came in such compact sizes too, although I think that's due to the limitations of the language. As Japanese characters can be read vertically, that allows for more play on possible book sizes.\n* No one culture is worth idealising: Japan remains my favourite country to visit as a tourist, but I've come to see that Japanese culture - like any other culture - has its flaws. That's simply because people are flawed. Yes, their service culture is impeccable, especially when you're served by middle-aged super helpful and super kind ladies. But on every Japanese trip so far, I've always had at least one unkind or impatient service encounter. On a day-to-day basis, people don't really apologise if they bump into you, and may not give up their seats for the elderly too. My cooking teacher says the Japanese are extremely polite in person but would rant and give very bad reviews anonymously at home. I've come to just enjoy their products, service, and their views of certain ways-of-life as a tourist, but stop short of idealising their culture. There are kind and unkind people in every culture. That said, I would still say on average, the Japanese may be more civic-minded than most. That doesn't mean they are innately kinder or warmer people, but simply that they are more self-aware of how their actions are perceived by others.\n\nI've decided not to mention the specific food places as far as possible because I think there's more than enough recommendations available elsewhere. I also think sometimes that we get a bit fomo if we build up too many must-go spots. Enjoy the process of discovering new places! But feel free to ask me more if you like.",

However, you don't have to stay right next to the Yamanote line. We picked Shinjuku simply because a lot of the places we want to visit were located central-west. So I'd say, pick a place most convenient for where your itinerary is heavily focused at. We stayed @ nishi-shijuku which is Shinjuku West. It was a 3min walk from a metro which was very convenient. We picked Tamachi for the last leg of the trip only because it's located central-south and thought it'd be faster to head to the airport. But yeah, it didn't feel like there was much going on @ Tamachi. And it made travelling East/West on our last day equally far since it was down in the south.",

I\u2019d be hesitant about the bikes, but I know the buses can be crowded and unreliable.\n\nAlso, definitely plan on using your tip for Studio Ghibli!!",

We did quite a lot of walking, especially at night as the bus system obviously isn\u2019t as elaborate as a city\u2019s. We did bikes just for sightseeing, not for transport. But there are plenty of wide footpaths, and people who aren\u2019t comfortable on roads ride on these footpaths.",

You\u2019ll notice it tells you the train direction, platform and mine indicates \u201clocal\u201d next to the platform. Click \u201cother departures\u201d and it\u2019ll show you the other train timings for the same destination but they vary between \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cexpress\u201d. Basically you want to wait for the train timing that makes sense for you! \n\nAs for Fuji-Q, i think the pre-requisite for express passes (they term it \u201cScreaming Priority Pass\u201d. Every ride as a separate queue for such pass users) is that you gotta have bought the one-day pass at the entrance, which allows you to take all rides. Otherwise, entry is free and you can pay-per-ride as my wife did. For express pass, there are ticketing machines within the park where you have to choose the rides to buy express tickets for (not sure if there are multiple machines, i simply went to a centrally located one near a donut store). Apparently they can run out. So make a beeline for it once you enter. I got express passes for 2/3 coasters because the first coaster was right at the entrance. But yeah, express passes for coasters cost about 2000 yen. It\u2019s cheaper for non-coasters. Do some research on the coasters you want express passes for so that when you use the machine, you\u2019d know the right ride to select.",

I am planning to buy the exact same style on my next trip in December, and was looking to assess whether it's cheaper to buy a Japanese made one back home.\n\nAlso, really interesting observations. I've been reading a few reports that have noted a larger influx of foreign visitors recently. It's likely a combination of people delaying trips that were originally planned during the plague times, and that May is a fairly popular month? Anecdotally, I have been to Tokyo previously in September and October, but observed greater numbers when I went in May 2018. \n\nRegarding idealisation of the culture. I feel that I did this a lot in my younger years, but I try not to look at things through rose-tinted glasses anymore. There are certainly aspects that I wish were more present where I live though; mainly a respect for public spaces and civic amenities (although I respect that this isn't uniquely Japanese!)",

The seller also recommended that to me over a cheaper one (I try to think that it's because he thinks it's better, rather than because it profits him more haha).\n\nRE foreigners: yes I think it's the covid-rebound effect. I personally know so many friends who are planning trips to Japan in the upcoming months. In a week's time, it'll be the summer holidays so I expect an incoming flood soon.\n\nRE culture: yes!

            "comment": "&gt; Scrutinise Google maps to figure out the different train types: for daily travel, there could be local, rapid, and express trains. Local trains stop at every station. Rapid skips a few, and express trains likely only stops at key location. They make a big difference to travel time, and to your comfort. When Google maps recommends a route, scrutinise the detail to ensure what kind of train they are recommending. It gets confusing at the station as the platforms on your left and right may end up at the same location, but one could be a local train and the other an express train.\n\nWanted to just second this. Wasn't typically a problem traveling within Tokyo, but hit us a few times when on more regional service trains where Google Maps would make it look like (at least at a glance) that the next train is the one you'd want, but one is actually in front of it and both will say the end destination (say Narita or Yokohama or whatever). You'll get there...but it will just take a hell of a lot longer than you think due to being on the local, or lower level limited service than Google Maps actually wants you on.\n\nReally good tip to just keep an eye out for that as you may be frazzled/busy/etc. Take the time to make sure the train line number/whatever Google Maps thinks is the next train is the actual train it wants you on.",

Yeah I think itinerary checks are most useful when you need someone else to tell you that you\u2019ve packed too much into a day (though i admit I felt a bit FOMO not doing a reddit itinerary check). But I think that\u2019s kinda common sense :p. Although I understand that there\u2019s limited time and people want to make the best use of it. We do have the luxury of more days in Tokyo so that gives us allowance. I still had a plan, just that it went by entire days. I.e. if we got enough rest that night, we\u2019d consider the Tsukiji intinerary, which would be followed with Ginza and Akihabara. But the days could be swapped around. Like i mentioned, if you\u2019re planning on excel, you can colour code parts of your itinerary that are located near to one another so that you can swap things around. E.g. Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku, Kichijoji are quite close to each other. Ginza, Akihabara, Tsukiji market are all in the East. But yeah, once you load everything into G maps, you can always plan the next day based on which pins congregate together in a particular region! Oh yes, take a look at the weather forecast too. For rainy days, we brought the museum itinerary up so we could be primarily indoors.",

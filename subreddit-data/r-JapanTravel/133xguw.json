    "postText": "Hello.\n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to visiting Kanazawa and taking in the Hyakumangoku festivities.\n\nWe\u2019ll be there from Friday to Monday morning with a family of 3 (one 6 year old). I have a rough idea of the events - most looking forward to watching the lanterns released on the river on Friday evening, the children\u2019s drum and lantern parade, and any folk performances.\n\nLooking for sage advice from any who has attended, the best way to approach the parade and navigate the crowds. Any advice on a good area to try to view from, how to manage logistics like bathroom visits, seating?\n\nWe\u2019re prepared to wing it, but would like to hear past experiences and dos/donts to make the best of this experience.",

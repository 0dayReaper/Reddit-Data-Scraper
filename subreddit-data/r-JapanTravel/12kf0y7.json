    "postText": "Dear /r/JapanTravel, looking for any inputs for this travel itinerary I modified from ChatGPT's initial suggestion: \n\nDay 1 (Friday):\n\n* Arrive at KIX at 1:30 pm\n* Take a train to Universal City station and check into a hotel near Universal Studios Japan and relax for the rest of the day.\n\nDay 2 (Saturday):\n\n* Spend the day exploring Universal Studios Japan\n\nDay 3 (Sunday):\n\n* Check out of the hotel and take a Shinkansen train to Hiroshima\n* Check into conference location hotel in Hiroshima and spend the rest of the day exploring the city.\n\nDay 4 (Monday):\n\n* Explore the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and Museum.\n* Visit Hiroshima Castle.\n\nDay 5 (Tuesday):\n\n* Visit Hiroshima Children's Museum\n* Explore Shukkei-en Garden\n\nDay 6 (Wednesday):\n\n* Take a day trip to Miyajima island (see Itsukushima Shrine and torii gate) \n\nDay 7 (Thursday):\n\n* Visit the Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park, a large zoo with a variety of animals and interactive exhibits for kids\n* Spend the rest of the day relaxing or exploring other areas of Hiroshima\n\nDay 8 (Friday):\n\n* Visit the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art\n* Explore Hiroshima's shopping and entertainment district in the evening\n\nDay 9 (Saturday):\n\n* Check out of conference hotel in Hiroshima\n* Day trip to Okayama and visit Korakuen Garden and Okayama Castle\n* Stay in Okayama\n\nDay 10 (Sunday):\n\n* Travel to Himeji \n* Visit Himeji Castle and Kokoen Garden\n* Stay in Himeiji\n\nDay 11 (Monday):\n\n* Check out of the hotel and travel back to KIX for the flight departure at 3pm (travel time: approximately 4 hours by Shinkansen train and airport express train)\n\nSome considerations I have for this trip:\n\n* I am travelling with my partner and our 3 children (all aged below 6)\n* I am debating between arrival at Fukuoka or Osaka. Current preference is for Osaka as partner and I had been there before we had children and we think it's more convenient, both in terms of flight paths from where we are (Singapore) and the location's infrastructure. Happy to hear any views on this.  \n* I have to stay in Hiroshima from Day 3 to Day 8 as my partner will be attending a conference there. Any suggested day trips within/out of Hiroshima, with 3 kids in tow?\n\nLet me know if the itinerary makes any sense? Also, any advice on the best combination of JR passes and train trips, or how to time the JR passes around the travel, would be very much appreciated. Looking forward to any advice at all!!",

The last thing you need is two hotel changes in two days (unpacking / packing) while being outnumbered by children at ages where they require close supervision. \n\nOkayama Castle is a waste of time if you are already going to Himeji Castle. In fact I would strongly consider just doing one garden/castle combination in-between Hiroshima and Osaka, to avoid a very long travel day on the last day.",

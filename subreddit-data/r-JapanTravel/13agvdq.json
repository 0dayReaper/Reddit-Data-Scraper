When you're trying to find it, know that it's on the 8th floor of Mitsukoshi department store (I  didnt realize this at first). However, the entrance itself is on the 9th floor, so you will have to take an elevator there either from the bottom or from the 8th floor like I did. \n\nAfter you're done, the department store has a lot of things to offer if you want to shop. My favourite was all the tea bowls, sake cups etc and especially one shop which had so many beautiful chopsticks.",

There's a sushi/sashimi store that is in the market building adjacent to the stalls. Just in front of the toilets. The otoro sushi there is amazingly cheap (600 yen for 2) and legit. Just 5 metres away the stalls &amp; restaurants will sell lower quality otoro for 2-3x more. You can then take a single bus down to Teamlabs (20mins incl walking). Do not arrive more than 15 mins early for Teamlabs, there is absolutely nothing else to do in the immediate surrounding area.  \n\nIf anything, I found Takeshita st/Harajuku to be more of a tourist trap, but I suppose you should go. Omote sando is next to it and pricey, but the architecture is quite interesting.  \nConsider planning naps in your day. We would wake up early to beat crowds for our first destination, walk 20k steps by 3pm, head back for a nap, then come out again at 6pm+ after rush hour to see the city at night. \nI've found good wagyu yakiniku to be easier to find and way cheaper in Osaka.",

Rainbow Bridge is also with a couple of hours and if you can get a tour of Sukiji Fush market do it it won\u2019t be there for long from what I hear. Might be worth it also to spend a day in Kamakura. IMHO people often spend too much time in Tokyo. It\u2019s not an easy city to navigate but seems like you have very specific things in mind. Would suggest Kyoto and Nara they are worth it. Would spend at least 2 days there. Although the food is amazing I don\u2019t think Osaka is that interesting.",

            "comment": "I just got back from a two week trip with my parents and we also spent 5/6 days in Tokyo, including two nights spent in a hotel overlooking Shibuya crossing. We also spent four nights in a hotel in Ueno.\n\nHot take, but I personally don\u2019t find Shibuya that interesting and I think you should do an evening in Shinjuku and then spend your time in a smaller, more interesting neighborhood. We loved Nakameguro and  Kichijoji and you might also try Daikanyama if you\u2019re into vintage designer consignment stores. Yanaka Ginza is a nice little street with interesting shops and it\u2019s about a 15 min walk from Nezu shrine. As someone who cooks a lot, I love Kappabashi St (you can do a fake food class at Ganso Shokuhin Sample-ya if you book in advance and I\u2019d highly recommend checking out the taiyaki making experience at Guraku)! We also had a great time doing the washi paper making class at Ozu Washi paper shop/museum.\n\nGoogle Maps has gotten MUCH better over the past few years and we used it very reliably to find restaurants (4.0+ rating is considered excellent and you may have to wait in line, but we had good meals at places in the 3.7-3.9 range too).\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, check out Airbnb experiences! Even if you don\u2019t want to book any activities, there are lots of walking tours offered that might inspire you to check out various neighborhoods.",

You can see it from everywhere and nothing there.\n\nInstead, goto Skytree on day 5.\nIt is 10 minutes from Sensoji by train or 15 minutes walk.\nSkytree is twice higher, easy to access, interesting shops under it.\n\nThe one Food display sample shop is my recommend.\n\nhttps://www.ganso-sample.com/en/",

(15 minutes walk from station. Meiji jingu is HUGE)\n\n\nThey have many entrance and each one a mile apart. Google map seems to direct you far side gate.\n\n\n2.Harajuku\n\n From center of Meiji jingu, you heading another gate to exit \u201cHarajuku guchi\u201d\nwhen you exit, Harajuku station is in front of you.\nSo you can easily go to Harajuku Takeshitadori.\n\n3.Shibuya\n\n  After walking Harajuku, go back to Harajuku station and ride Yamanote-line to Shibuya.\nit\u2019s one stop.\n  Enjoy Shibuya\n\n4.Shinjuku\n\n    After shibuya, go back to Shibuya station and take yamanote-line to Shinjuku\n     3rd stop only takes 7 minutes.\n\n\nSo this way you can go around in one day\n And you only riding Yamanote-line.\nSimple.\n\n\nWhen you plan always go shrine or temple 1st.\nThey opens around 6am so You can use day longer.",

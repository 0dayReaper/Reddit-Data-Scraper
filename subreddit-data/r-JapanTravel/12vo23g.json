            "comment": "Hi!\n\nNone of this is meant to be rude.\n\nI think going from Hakone to Kanazawa is going to take you longer than you think, since you have to backtrack to Tokyo.  And while Hakone-Yumoto itself isn't too far from Tokyo, most people tend to stay along the Tozan line or Gora.  I might move some of your plans in Kanazawa around, since I believe you need reservations ahead of time to visit ninjadera.\n\nIf you plan to go from Kanazawa to Takayama by train make sure you know the times for the trains from Toyama to Takayama in advance.  I am sure Toyama is a great place to visit iv you have a few hours, but the station itself is really boring if you have a 45 minute to 1 hour layover and you can't easily go elsewhere without risking missing your train.  It is very clean though.\n\nI've never heard of being able to go into the river or any of ponds in Kamikochi and I would check at my hotel before doing so.  I know there is at least one hotel with onsen though.  Make sure you include meals, because trying to find dinner within Kamikochi otherwise is really really hard.\n\nPrepare for the trip from Kamikochi to Kyoto to take a decent amount of time.  I believe the bus from Kamikochi to Hirayu is not timed for the bus from Hirayu to Takayama.  If you do want to spend a little extra time in Hirayu the day trip onsen at Hirayu no Mori are great.  I would be prepared though to maybe not do all the things you planned to do in Kyoto that day and maybe move some things around.  I personally really liked Ninnaji.  You might also want to move things around a bit just based on what is closer to the different Hyatt hotels you are using.\n\nGood luck!",

                            "comment": "Hi!\n\nDepending on the transfer, yes, some of these places have limited public transit.  There should be 1 express train an hour between Takayama and Nagoya, but there are only 4 express trains a day between Toyama and Takayama. (and Takayama to Toyama.  I missed mine, which is why I am painfully aware of the limited number of trains.)\n\nDespite what the other person suggested, I would not do Hakone to Takayama.  There is only one Hikari shinkansen every 2 hours between Odawara and Nagoya.  I think there are more frequent Kodama shinkansen, but they take so much longer that it often doesn't help much.  (vs. going back to Tokyo, taking a Kodama is less of an issue because the only stops are Shin Yokohama, Shinagawa and Tokyo, which pretty much every Tokaido shinkansen is going to stop at.)  Heck you can even take a rapid local between  Odawara and Tokyo and it will take less time than any shinkansen to Nagoya. \n\nI think it's just important to be aware your travel days are going to be long.\n\nWe really liked Hida no Sato in Takayama.  I liked it in some ways better than Shirakawa Go and I went to Shirakawa Go in February when it was covered in snow and Hida no Sato in late June.\n\nI stayed in the Associa in Takayama.  It's not as convenient as some, I picked it for the onsen.\n\nif you're not from the US or just really fond of squirrels, someone on the Japan Guide forum just adores the squirrel park in Takayama.",

Hakone to Nikko will take you 3-4 hours and Nikko to Kanazawa is going to run 4-5 hours.\n\nOne idea of a path you could take is Hakone to Nagano (it's closer than Kanazawa is to Hakone and is on the same train line as Kanazawa, the Hokuriku shinkansen)  you could then do either: Nagano to Kanazawa and could either day trip to Matsumoto or stop off at Toyama and do the Kurobe Gorge train ride\n\nOR\n\nNagano to Matsumoto, Matsumoto to Kamikochi to Takayama to Kanazawa\n\ngood luck!",

Once you travel there and then potentially have dinner/onsen (if you'll only be at the Ryokan to sleep, there truly is no reason to stay at a Ryokan IMO as that's just an expensive room for the night and you're not getting the culture/experience from it).\n\nWe spent 2 days (including travel) to/from and we easily could've spent another day just to have a bit more time to take it all in. I think 1 day - when you're traveling to/from - will fly by and you may miss out on some bits, so I'd consider adding at least 1 more day (if you're including travel). Just my 2p.",

            "comment": "Now that I've started reading... lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;May 18th - Tokyo (Stay in Ueno) - Land at 2:50PM, setup suica card, maybe visit Akihabara if extra time?\r  \n\r  \nMay 19th - Tokyo (Stay in Ueno) - Asakusa (Kaminarimon Gate, Sensoji Temple), Akihabara\r  \n\r  \nMay 20th - Tokyo (Stay in Ueno) - Ueno (Ueno Park, Tokyo National Museum), Akihabara (if extra time)\n\nComing at this from the perspective of somebody who visited Pre-covid (before some notable spots have since closed) and genuinely did enjoy Akiba (and will typically always set aside a few hours to pop in when visiting Japan - \"just because\"), I think 3 days is overkill. Our first trip we did 2 nights staying in Akiba before heading to Kansai. Akiba was actually a really great area for us to walk around while fighting jet lag (IMO) as there wasn't too much we had to be seriously invested in. We maybe spent half a day there the next day (maybe slightly more) solely because we fell into the time sink of the department stores where you can't see the outside and lose track of time before you know it...\n\nBut even with all that, I think you might be giving yourself a little bit too much time in Akiba. I can see you have mentioned \"if extra time\", so I just thought I'd throw it in there that the half day will probably be enough IMO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see you shuffle from one spot in Tokyo to another. Is there a reason why you're deciding to change from one spot of Tokyo to another? It seems like potentially a waste of time/admin doing this? (E.G. when you have to check out, sort out bags (assuming you're travelling with bags), then check back in to the new spot. I'm not sure what you would gain here tbh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;June 2nd- Koyasan (Stay in temple) - Explore temples\n\nIs there a reason you'll be doing Kyoto before and after this? Would it not make more sense to stay in Koyasan before settling into Kyoto? Or - judging by the looks of it - would the plan be to get a hotel for the whole period and go to spend the night in Koyasan while still having the other hotel room?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also suggest potentially going to Hiroshima first, spending your night or two there, *then* going to either Kyoto or Osaka vs moving between the two as you can move pretty easily between the both of them (so would suggest staying where you prefer based on your criteria (E.G. if you're going to spend most time in Kyoto, maybe stay there. If you're wanting to have a lot of nightlife in Osaka, maybe consider staying there). Just stay near the station that'll allow you to go between the two with the most ease - it's not a far trip between them. \n\nYou could rejig your time so it's like this\n\n* May 31st - Hiroshima\n* June 1st - Miyajima daytime - travel to Kyoto **or** Osaka in the early evening (to check into hotel room)\n* June 2nd - (assuming you leave your stuff in  Kyoto/Osaka and move to Koyasan for the night) Koyasan\n* June 3rd-7th - Back to the hotel room in Kyoto/Osaka (whichever you choose)\n* June 8th - Departure day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat should still fit what you're wanting within the same timeframe. Though I will say I think Hiroshima/Miyajima may feel rushed. Trying to put Himeji in there - while I definitely recommend it as it was lovely - is a mistake with the time you have. You will easily spend at least half a day in Himeji. You'll also want to check what time the museum closes (looks to be 7PM at the moment) as you'll need to be able to get back from Himeji, check in to wherever you're checking in in Hiroshima, then get to the memorial park/museum (which might be fine, but you might find you're pressed for time). Then you can easily spend the better part of a day on Miyajima IMO. But again - I guess it all depends on what you're trying to do. I would definitely give it the second night, personally (learning from my own mistake).",

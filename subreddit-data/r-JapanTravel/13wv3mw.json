    "postText": "Hi everyone!  I will be in Kyoto in mid November and am struggling to simplify my itinerary.  **I know I won't have enough time to do everything on the list**.  This will be first time visiting the area (and country), so I have no idea what is essential and what can be skipped.  I plan to be up around 5am every day to hit the busier spots that are open early.  Mostly interested in cultural heritage, old world architecture, natural beauty / Autumn foliage, and smaller crowds.  Am thinking of skipping Arashiyama as I will be exploring less busy bamboo groves elsewhere in the city, and I will be seeing snow monkeys in Nagano after leaving Kyoto.\n\n**Day 1: Arrival in Kyoto**  \n\\- Settle in &amp; explore area around accomodation  \n\\- Walk the 1000 torii gates at Fushimi Inari at night\n\n**Day 2: Kurama / Kyoto**  \n\\- Hike Mt. Kurama circuit / trail   \n\\- Shisendo temple  \n\\- Ginkaku-ji / Higashiyama Jisho-ji temple  \n\\- Honen-in temple  \n\\- Philosopher's Path  \n\\- Eikan-do / Zenrin-ji temple  \n\\- Nanzen-ji temple\n\n**Day 3: Nara / Uji**  \n\\- Hike through Mt. Kasuga Primeval Forest area  \n\\- Visit all the sites and deer at Nara Park  \n\\- Grab mochi at Nakatanidou  \n\\- Stop in Uji on the way back to Kyoto for tea shopping\n\n**Day 4: Kyoto**  \n\\- Fushimi Inari again in the morning and explore the back trails  \n\\- Daigo-Ji temple for some serene Autumn foliage  \n\\- Explore and shop around central Kyoto / Gion area  \n\\- Laundry day\n\n**Day 5: Kyoto**  \n\\- Tofuku-ji temple  \n\\- Sennyu-ji temple (less busy alternative to Tofuku-ji)  \n\\- Higashiyama Ward  \n\\- Kiyomizu-dera temple  \n\\- Kennin-ji temple  \n\\- Kodaiji temple  \n\\- Yasaka shrine  \n\\- Explore Gion again\n\nI think Day 2 and Day 5 are the most unrealistic, but please help me cut out anything from this list if it is unnecessary, or recommend anything essential that I don't know about.  I think the temples in particular probably don't all need to be visited.  THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!",

Instead of trying to speedrun the place and check everything off the list (be it Lonely Planet, travel blogs, recos from this sub) I just went my own place, veered off the beaten path a bit. I really enjoyed it.\n\nKyoto is super busy, moreso on the weekends, and it can be really overwhelming for anyone.\n\nFocus on the experiences you want to have, take it easy, listen to your body, make sure to have rest/slow days to recover from all the walking up the stairs.",

            "comment": "Assuming you are going in mid/late November (as this is the correct time for foliage in Kyoto), this is all over the place. You're in the Gion area twice (Days 4 and 5), Fushimi Inari twice (Day 1 and 4), have a super out of the day detour to Kurama...\n\nIdeas for what to cut:\n\n* You only need to do things once. I would keep Fushimi Inari on Day 4 and delete it from Day 1. You could consider a nighttime foliage illumination.\n\n* Cut Mt Kurama / Shisendo on Day 2 as it's so out of the way relative to everything else. Or, cut everything else, and make it a generic North Kyoto day with Kurama-Kibune, Shisendo, Shukaguin Villa (advanced ticket application required, free).\n\n* Day 3: Tea souvenirs are sold everywhere, if you just want to buy snacks there is no need to stop in Uji.\n\n* Day 4: You're already doing Gion on Day 5, cut Gion from this day. You could shift Tofukuji here if you like as it makes geographic sense. Otherwise do whatever you didn't do on Day 2 here.\n\n* Day 5: **Wake up very early** for Kiyomizudera. Arriving before 7 is a dramatically different and vastly more peaceful experience. Then do other Higashiyama stuff. Although by this time you'll likely be templed out and fully annoyed with humanity.\n\nI agree with /r/tdrr12 that Nishiki Market exists entirely for tourists, it's okay if you like that kind of experience but important that you go with the right expectations.",

Night time sounds less busy for the gates, and I gather that during the day the hiking trails further into the shrine are less busy.  I would hike the trails at night, but I suspect they're not illuminated?\n\nI really wanted to do Mt. Kurama, as hiking in nature and out of the city is appealing to me.  Would much rather cut out the other temples I have listed for that day instead. Kurama-Kibune, Shisendo, Shukaguin Villa sounds great to me.\n\nThank you so much for the advice!  Anything missing from the list that you'd recommend?",

The gates go all the way up, so if you hike the full way then by definition you will see them without large crowds. \n\nI don't understand the appeal of going at night tbh, you can barely see anything meaningful as the lighting is not super bright.",

There's a million temples to see, and my least fond memories are of Ginkakuji and Kinkakuji. Fushimi Inari, in terms of sights, is close behind. Your ideas to evade crowds are pretty decent but repeat visits to Fushimi Inari are at odds with the crowd evasion strategy.\n\nFor fewer crowds, make reservations for tours at either/both imperial villas. The gardens are incredibly gorgeous and visitor numbers are limited. Daisen-in also has a high beauty-to-crowd ratio, in my experience.\n\nYou can buy excellent Uji tea everywhere so I'm not sure I would make that stop, unless you have a deeper interest in tea/Uji.\n\nDoing Higashiyama in one day is more than doable time-wise, but you will eventually get templed-out, doing temple after temple after temple for several days. Get to Kyomizudera early.\n\nETA: I'm at odds with another commenter about Nishiki market. I've watched it become a crowded, touristy hellhole since our first visit a decade ago. (And some people claim it had already become a crowded, touristy hellhole then.) I was glad to not see it on your list. Street food is not really a Japanese -- and definitely not a Kyoto! -- thing to begin with, and Nishiki almost exclusively now caters to tourists.",

Wandering and enjoying it all along the way was just as impactful, personally, as many of the destinations I visited. \nI would cut this list by 1/3 or half and go at a more mellow pace like others recommended. Pick one site or area each day and go from there and don\u2019t think twice about what you missed.",

All the memories of temples in my head just blended together except for kinkakuji, but only because it's the only shiny one lol",

            "comment": "okay. good start. you know its not possible to do all. you want to start early. good\n\nso lets see\n\nday 1: okay\n\nday 2:  \nkurama, nope. yes, kifunejinja is nice, the hike is okay, the temple up there is okay, but the onsen is afaik closed, and november may not be the best time of year. and we gotta cut something  \nso what is left is upper east kyoto. lots of good choices. ginkakuji/philosophers path combined with nanzenji and eikando is a great and still full enough day. see if you can (re)visit eikando after dark in november for nighttime illumination\n\nday 3: \nvisit ALL the sites and deer in nara. hahaha  \nhonestly I am not sure I need nara in my first only few days trip to kyoto. if you need it, start with Kofukuji, walk towards todaiji through the park. feel free to explore a little. Kasuga Taisha may be worth to walk to as well.  \nwith a little luck and maybe not too much exploring you may be able to stop at uji on your way back and rush to Byoidin. after Byoidin is closed you can walk back to the train station and hop into the tea stores on your way.\n\nday 4: \nfushimi again? back trails?   \ndaigo ji, nice  \nwashing the laundry you can do more or less 24/7, shopping after 5pm  \nmaybe youll find something else to do? kinkakuji? nijojo?\nand you can also explore gion and yasaka when its dark. \n\nday 5:\ndo not miss higashiyama !\nkiyomizudera and the pagode on the way is good to see. Kodaiji is my favorite.\nboth may have night time illuminations. Entokuin (close to Kodaiji) may have nighttime illumination.\nKodaiji is worth to see in the daylight and at night (same goes for eikando on day 2) \n\n\n\narashiyama is much more than bamboo grove and monkeys. its a distinct area that looks entirely different than most of kyoto. but I understand, time is limited.",

                    "comment": "Day 2:  I would love to spend as much time in nature as I can, hence Kurama.  I hear it's not super busy, and the foliage in November will be lovely.  Do you think upper East Kyoto is more important that some of the other eastern temple areas?  I can cut away some other stuff, but I'm pretty set on Kurama (unless you can recommend a better hiking option).  \n\n\nDay 4: Anywhere else near Daigo-ji that would be worth visiting?  \n\n\nI would consider Arashiyama and the area north of there, what are some stand out things to see and do?\n\nThanks for your advice!",

    "postText": "Hi all! My fianc\u00e9 and I are travelling to Japan this November. It is my fourth time and his first. I'm hoping that you will be able to help me out with anything I have missed or that you really recommend - I am looking to have a mix of doing the 'must see' things for him and doing a few things that I haven't done before (I have previously been to Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Nara pre-pandemic). My partner would like to do some nature based things and I am definitely a \u2018visit as many shrines/temples as possible\u2019 person, so I am trying to build those in.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who reads this and helps me out!\n\nDay 1 (12 Nov) - Tokyo\nArrive at Haneda 10:25am.\nHead to hotel in Asakusa to drop off our bags and spend the day around Asakusa/Skytree.\n\n\nDay 2 (13 Nov) - Tokyo\nShibuya &gt; Harajuku &gt; Shinjuku\n\nShibuya Sky, Shibuya Scramble, Takeshita-dori, Meji Jingu, Shinjuku Gyoen\n\n\nDay 3 (14 Nov) \u2013 Kamakura\nDaibutsu, Kenchoji, Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, Hasedera, various other temples\n \n\nDay 4 (15 Nov) - Kanazawa\nKenrokuen, Ninjadera, Higashi Chaya, Nagamachi, 21st Century Museum?\n\n\nDay 5 (16 Nov) - Tokyo\nAkihabara &amp; Ikebukuro. Tokyo Station in the evening.\n\nI was thinking potentially a trip to the Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9 but we are vegetarian so wouldn\u2019t be able to eat any of the mains. Would I be able to just have a drink &amp; dessert or would I need to order a main also? If not, I\u2019ll just go to the Pok\u00e9mon Sweets Caf\u00e9.\n\n\nDay 6 (17 Nov) \u2013 Kyoto\nEarly train to Kyoto (6am-ish to arrive 9am-10am)\n\nKiyomizu-dera, Ginka-kuji, Eikando temple, Gion, Yasaka-jinja\n \n\nDay 7 (18 Nov) - Kyoto\nTakao to Hozukyo Hike\nArashiyama \u2013 Monkey Park, Bamboo Grove, Kinkakuji\n\n\nDay 8 (19 Nov) \u2013 Kyoto/Hiroshima\nMorning: Fushimi Inari\nAfternoon: Hiroshima Peace Park, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum\n \n\nDay 9 (20 Nov) \u2013 Hiroshima/Miyajima/Osaka\nFerry to Miyajima\nItukushima Shrine, Mount Misen\nLater train to Osaka \u2013 Check in to our hotel. Explore Dotonburi.\n\n\nDay 10 (21 Nov)- Osaka\nOsaka Castle, Shitteno-ji, Shinsekai, Namba Yasaka Shrine\n\n\nDay 11 (22 Nov) - Osaka\nUniversal Studios Japan\n\n\nDay 12 (23 Nov)- Osaka\nThis is a National holiday in Japan. I was originally thinking Koyasan but potentially that will be a faff and not worth it if we aren\u2019t staying overnight. Does anyone really recommend Koyasan or are we best doing an extra day in Osaka/more time in Kyoto/another day trip from Osaka?\n \n\nDay 13 (24 Nov) - Nara\nTodaiji, Horyuji, Nara Park, Nigatsudo, Kasugataisha Shrine, Imaicho town \n \n\nDay 14 (25 Nov) \u2013 Tokyo?\nWe have a hotel booked near Haneda, so need to be in Tokyo for then. We have a choice of spending the morning/day in Osaka, getting an early train back to Tokyo and spending the day there or a day trip to a location between Osaka and Tokyo \u2013 again, anything that people really recommend? We can probably just decide this closer to the time in any case.\n\nDay 15 (25 Nov)\nFly home from Haneda :(\n\nAny tips or suggestions are majorly appreciated! I've tried not to pack too much in but on some days I think I might not have achieved that! \n\nThanks again!",

I know that logically we should do a night in Kanazawa to make it worth it, but I was being lazy and trying to avoid moving hotels again \n\nHakone is definitely a good shout, especially if Fuji visibility is good!",

            "comment": "Your going during Autumn leaves time so allow for that in your plans both for viewing and crowds at some locations.  I will be there also :)\n\nKanazawa works as a day trip but as already mentioned may be rushed and you may have to prioritise.  Kanazawa Kenrokuen will be busy but  a lot of people do not go far in so it thins out. The Castle is across the road so check that out on YouTube to see if it appeals.\n\nThe Bamboo Grove can get jam packed with tourists.  It does not close and is best done early morning where you can almost have it to yourself.  \n\nFor an extra day trip from Osaka consider Okayama Kenrokuen and castle.  One of the top 3 gardens in  Japan, you will already have done one of the others at Kanazawa. You could actually do it on your way to Hiroshima and swap with Fushimi Inari in the morning.  In saying that I have no idea how a national holliday will impact the crowds at Fushimi Inari.  Kobe and Himeji are worth considering.\n\nExpect to be shrine / temple weary and be flexible.\n\nAllow for days to be short with sunset just after 5.",

Taking it as a good sign that quite a few people are also going in November\n\nYeah, I am definitely going to cut the itinerary down for a lot of the days and do some prioritisation.\n\nOkayama looks lovely and is definitely now on the itinerary- I never even would have considered it! Like you say, I think we'll do it on the way to Hiroshima and just try to get to Fushimi Inari early on the 23rd.",

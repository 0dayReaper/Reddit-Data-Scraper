    "postText": "Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and give advice. I made a previous post about my first week in Japan in tokyo. We will end off in Hakone. I\u2019m really just looking for advice on how realistic doing all these on their days are, and if theres any caveats about things I should know. FYI we are a group of 4. Also will our plan to sleep at the airport work or will they turn us away? Any ideas for Nara or Amanohashidate? Thank you!\n\nThu 6/15 - Kyoto\n- Leave from Mount View Hakone ryokan, ride train from Odawara to J\u016bj\u014d station.\n- Check into kyoto airbnb and drop off luggage (check in after 3pm)\n- Go to Kiyomizu-dera and explore the town around it\n- Return home\n\nFri 6/16 - Kyoto 2\n- as early as possible go to Arashiyama bamboo forest\n- Walk through forest to Tenryuji temple\n- Walk to the Monkey park\n- Depending on time after monkeys, hike to the Senk\u014dji temple\n- After those things, depending on time we may try to fit Fushimi Inari or Kinkakuji. If not, we\u2019ll do it on a spare day.\n\nSat 6/17 - Kyoto 3 spare day\n- Do any left over things such as fushimi inari or kinkakuji\n- Try one of those samurai experiences\n- We are considering a beach trip, Amanohashidate seems very beautiful but we aren\u2019t sure if itd be worth the 3hr train one way. \n- Also considering Lake Biwa for the views and beach\n\nSun 6/18 - Osaka\n- Leave kyoto Airbnb and go to our Osaka airbnb. They say we can drop off luggage before checkin (which is late at 4pm), but if we determine we dont want to leave our stuff unattended, we will take our luggage with us to the Kaiyukan Aquarium where we will purchase a coin locker.\n- After aquarium, Kuchu Teien observatory, at sunset if we can\n- Dotonbori and Shinsaibashisuji at night and enjoy the food, shopping, etc.\n\n6/19 - USJ\n- whole day will be saved for universal studios japan. We plan to get there early before they open. Our main goal is nintendo world.\n\n6/20 - extra Osaka day/last day\n- Chill and do any left over things, definitely want to go to Osaka Castle\n- Considering a day trip to Nara, any suggestions?\n- At end of the day, we will go to the Kansai airport and intend to stay the night here before our flight at 7am.",

            "comment": "hi!\n\nI'm not sure how much of Kiyomizudera you are going to be seeing if you are not leaving to go there until after 3:00 pm (Since that is your check in time at your AirBnB and if you don't check in there you will need to find a luggage place in Kyoto Station, and that late in the day I think finding a locker, let alone 4 will be a challenge.)  \n\nThough it is going to be hot and humid it might make sense to walk to Fushimi Inari (about 2 kms away and visit there on arrival since it is not likely to be any less crowded on the day you go to Arashiyama.  You could also take a cab, it shouldn't be so expensive (like 1000 yen.)  But it also partially depends on where your AirBnB is compared to Jujo Station (and which Jujo Station!) Just be aware it will be hot and humid since you are going in June (or possibly raining) and Fushimi Inari can get very crowded and be really hot.  \n\nI would even suggest though it is much further by bus, going to Kinkakuji on arrival, because it is easier to only spend  only 1 hour there, than have more limited time in the Kiyomizudera, though honestly I would probably try to go to Fushimi Inari since it has no closing time.\n\nAlso be aware there are two unconnected Jujo Stations in Kyoto.  One is on the Kintetsu line and the other is off the Karasuma subway line.  Your AirBnb could be between them both but you should know which one is closer to your AirBnB.\n\nAnd yeah, I think planning a day trip to Amanohashidate pretty much erases anything else you are considering for that day because it's just a long and only so frequent trip.  It also gives you the opportunity to see more of Kyoto, if you like it because you currently only have 1 full day there planned.\n\nOsaka Castle is mostly interesting if you're really into the history of the Siege of Osaka castle because it's a concrete reconstruction with a completely modern interior.  However, if you're interested in the Siege of Osaka Castle it's a great museum dedicated to that.\n\nGood luck!",

                    "comment": "Thank you this is super helpful! I had a feeling we wouldnt have enough time for kiyomizudera. I will probably take your suggestion and switch fushimi inari and kiyomizudera, especially cause I dont see us needing much time as fushimi inari, i doubt we\u2019ll hike the whole thing lol\n\nAlso i was looking at temperature averages for june and they seemed like nice 70\u00b0 maybe 80\u00b0? Maybe the humidity will make it feel worse. But living in Texas summers i think we\u2019ll be okay.\n\nOur airbnb is a few minutes walk for the J\u016bj\u014d station on the Kintetsu-Kyoto line\n\nI am very interested in the history so I will definitely plan to go to Osaka castle.\n\nAmanohashidate might have to be something for my next trip here! Seems great but not worth the whole the trip on an already packed schedule\n\nThank you so much for your time and response!",

I went to Japan June 2016-2019 and while I usually start my trips on the 19th or 20th (which is true for this year as well) I don't think being there several days earlier will make a big difference.\n\nMost places we visited would get into the 80s during the day with very high humidity, so it felt just really hot and humid.  Kyoto is particularly bad because it's sort of bowl shaped, so the humidity just gets trapped there and never goes away.  Some places, like Takayama, Matsumoto, Nagano, Tohoku, and Kanazawa, cooled off once the sunset and were fine in the early morning.  Kyoto and Osaka are just humid.  I don't remember it ever feeling it was 70 or 75,.  I know I have definitely been there when it hit 90+  and I tend to leave for the US around the 4th of July.\n\nI think it doesn't help that unlike heating in Winter, most places in Japan are not over air conditioned, so going inside will be cooler, but not  by much.  \n\nI spent a year living in Houston, and in the Summer you're never really outside and everything is so over air conditioned that I use to always wear a sweater.  Maybe that has changed, and now the AC isn't as high inside.  \n\nIt's more like visiting DisneyWorld and just spending hours slogging in the heat and humidity with no real relief by going inside.  It does feel different from a dry heat, though honestly once that gets above 95, it still really miserable to be out sightseeing in, it just means it cools off at night.  \n\nMaybe this year will be better, but I sort of doubt it since Spring came so early, but who knows?\n\nWe did the whole hike at Fushimi Inari June 2019.  (It was my 2nd or 3rd time, my tween's first.)  The plus of some of the back loop is there are more trees and some people don't continue onwards because they are tired, so it is a little less crowded.  The lower area can be a mob scene.\n\nIt's impossible to fit in everything you want to do.  It's one reason I keep going back. :D  I find it easier to do everything in smaller pieces so that it is not overwhelming.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of people don't like Osaka Castle and it tends to get a bad rap in this subreddit, but I think you have to look at it in the right light.  If you're thinking of it as a good museum in the shape of a castle, then it's a lot more enjoyable than if you think of it as a castle.",

I've been to TDR in rain in 2017, USJ in rain in 2018, and just had rain in general.  It makes the hydrangea look lovely and made the lines at the theme parks non-existent!  It took a while to get flying dinosaur up and we didn't go on it, because my daughter didn't make the heightline.  The only ride with crowds was the train back to Osaka and if I had known how bad it was going to be I honestly would have tried to get a cab, eaten and extra hotel night near USJ, or tried walking just to get somewhere with more train options.  We waited longer for a train than the 50 minutes it takes to walk to Nishikujo.  \n\nAs long as Puerto Rico doesn't go in over air conditioning things, then yes, it is probably more like Puerto Rico.  It is 100% mangeable, I mean I grew up some place hot and humid in the Summer without central air, it's just something to be prepared for.  My tween can get overwhelmed.  I try to limit how intense I plan sightseeing outside of theme park days.\n\nI don't know what was up, but in 2019 we had no rain until our very last day, when it was pouring.  We were in Japan for a good 2 weeks (first week in Kansai, 2nd week in Tohoku and Tokyo, Tohoku does tend to be less rainy, but we had no rain in Kansai and we were not happy about it!)  Every other year we had more rain.  \n\nI am sure you will have a great trip!",

There should be space available given that its a Thursday and the start of the commuter rush going home. From there take the JR train to Fushimi Inari as the station is literally right in front of the shrine complex. As for sightseeing Osaka Castle, I always tell folks to skip it and head to Himeji Castle instead. Its about 30 minutes away on either the JR or Sanyo/Hanshin rail lines. Himeji is considered the grandest of all the castles in Japan. Osaka Castle does have a bit more to do inside. For Day 3 I'd either stay in Kyoto or travel to Nara. Its easier to get to Nara from Kyoto than from Osaka as you have 2 direct train lines going there.",

            "comment": "I combined Kinkaku-ji and Arashiyama in one day - I went to Kinkaku-ji at opening (lined up beforehand) and it\u2019s a short bus to the JR train station that goes to Saga-Arashiyama. You\u2019ll have more crowds at the bamboo grove, but less at Kinkaku-ji, and they\u2019re geographically \u201cclose enough\u201d for Kyoto standards. There\u2019s also an amulet and goshuin station at the end, if the normal ones are too crowded.  I didn\u2019t spend all that long there, (I was staying ahead of the crowds for clear photos) but I was impressed and it was worth it.I was there on a Saturday and was glad I was lined up when it opened. The bamboo forest wasn\u2019t a crowd crush or anything, just popular and touristy. It\u2019s also fun to see all the shops and sweets and play tourist along the main drag.\n\nDo pay the extra fee to see the garden at Tenryuji - it\u2019s absolutely stunning. I went to the temple first, then went to the bamboo forest out the back, and I enjoyed doing it that way.\n\nI did my day trip to Nara from Kyoto - I stopped at Fushimi Inari since it\u2019s on the train line that ends at Nara - it was very convenient, even if the train was long. Not so much if you\u2019re coming from Osaka! Nara was a solid half-day trip, but the travel time added up. I enjoyed the temples and the general walking around, was underwhelmed by the deer tourism. Don\u2019t buy the crackers unless you want to be swarmed - we saw many teenagers swarmed.\n\nThe main downside of airbnb in Japan (besides the usual) is that hotels will let you drop your luggage no problem - I recommend dropping your stuff in a coin locker, as checking in at 3pm and /then/ going to kiyomizudera probably won\u2019t be optimal. I greatly enjoyed the temple and then walking down the shopping street and down the sannenzaka to Goin. You\u2019ll want the stores to be open. There\u2019s plenty of fun shopping - both souvenir and snacks, and I\u2019m not much of a shopper.",

So unless your tattoos show outside yukata (we went in February so we got overcoats I forgot the \n name of too and they helped dress us!) who knows! lol\n\nWe reserved the time at check-in, same with dinner, super easy! Yukata was just for borrowing, but it wasn't anything special and I can't remember if there was the option to buy some (but yukata are easy enough to get!)",

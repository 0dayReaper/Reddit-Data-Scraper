(It's next to Cookie Time, the dessert shop that is hard to miss.) There's also loads of other shops, Yoyogi park and Meiji Shrine are both nearby.\n\nIn Ikebukuro, even if you're not a woman or into doujinshi, there's Sunshine City with the Mega Tokyo Pokemon Center, the newer Grandscapes building with Capcom stuff in it, and the giant new Animate store. Plus the whole area is just fun to walk around, it's very busy and has arcades and stores all over the place. I usually stay pretty close to Ikebukuro when I visit Japan and it's just a fun area.\n\nUeno has a lot of museums, the zoo, but then you've also got the Asakusa and Yanaka areas nearby. What I like to go is to go on Google maps and check out an area, and see what's nearby. Pin a couple shops or restaurants you're interested in, anchor your visit to an area around one or two major things you want to see.",

            "comment": "Hello!\n\nNot sure if you will have any real jet lag coming from India but you might want to factor in that on your first few days. Just some general thoughts:\n\nDay 1:\n\n-\tGolden Gai is a cool place to get drinks (if a bit overrated) but it\u2019s not really somewhere I\u2019d rush to go to for food. A lot of good food options around Shinjuku I\u2019d go to first before there. Also for \u201caffordable drinks\u201d it can get expensive because of the table charges. If you are just popping in for one drink the table charge will make it more expensive than a normal bar.\n-\tHub is a pretty generic chain of western bars, in a area with so many novel and unique bars I\u2019d personally skip it.\n\n\nDay 2:\n\n-\tmost people make yokohama a day trip but you could probably do what you are planning here, it\u2019s just a lot of travelling around (unless your hotel is in/near Shibuya)\n-\tthe Gundam is a small walk from the station (maybe like 20min) and if you want to see it move you need to wait till the performance times (roughly once an hour?)\n\nDay 3:\n\n-\tthat\u2019s a lot of stuff in one day. You will likely want to spend some time in many of those places (small worlds is really cool, joyopolis is fun but you also need to wait in line for rides etc)\n-\tdoing the go karts is generally frowned upon because it is fairly annoying to the locals.\n\n\nSome general points for the remaining days:\n\n-\tthe fuji and Hakone area are separate and not very close to each other. Since it seems like you are also using this day as a transition day between Tokyo and Kyoto you won\u2019t have that much time to do stuff in the area.\n-\tday 5 is way too packed, a lot of these places are far away from each other and will rely on bus transfers. The next day seems pretty light so I\u2019d move some stuff over.\n-\tI personally would not buy that Tokyo Subway Ticket and just tap on/off at stations because it seems like a pain to have to show a station attendant that every time.\n-\tlike the other post said you should check out some other districts other than Shinjuku and Shibuya.\n\n\nFinally, as another brown dude don\u2019t sleep on Indian food in Japan, it\u2019s really good.",

You may want to add that to your Yokohama Trip.\nWhen you\u2019re in Kyoto, keep in mind that you\u2019ll be using the bus a lot. Riding the bus in Japan (especially Kyoto) is a bit different from riding in the US. There are Youtube videos that explain the process. \n\nYou can add Suica to your iPhone.

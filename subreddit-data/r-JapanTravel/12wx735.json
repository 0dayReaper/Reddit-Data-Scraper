    "postText": "Our trip is for 13 nights. When I started planning I tried to fit EVERYTHING in, and I did start booking places so I booked a place in Tokyo for 3 nights, one in Kyoto for 3 nights and then one for Koyasan for 1 night thinking that we\u2019d then go on to see Kanazawa and Hakuba and back to Tokyo but in the end I feel like it\u2019s too much I need more time in Tokyo and less time traveling by train and changing sleeping location specifically. So, part of the problem is my flight goes in to Tokyo and leaves there so I need to be there at the beginning of the trip and at the end\u2026 and the other issue is the place I booked in Kyoto isn\u2019t refundable so I have to be there those specific days. That said, I\u2019m thinking that after leaving Koyasan we should head to Osaka for one night to eat and see Dotonbori then the next morning head back to Tokyo for 5 nights, but I\u2019m having difficulty figuring out where to stay in Tokyo? \n\nItinerary is as follows:\n\nArrive May 30th\n\nTokyo (we are staying in Shibuya) 3 nights, plan to see Ueno Park, a museum, Akihabara, the Meiji Shrine, harajuku, and generally just fit as much sightseeing as possible our two full days there.\n\nThen we head to Kyoto and I plan to see Fushimi Inari Shrine, arashiyama bamboo grove, visit the Gion district, visit ninenzaka, and see other shrines if time allows.\n\nThen Koyasan one night, we are staying in a temple, and signed up for dinner and the cemetery tour. \n\nLeave Koyasan after lunch to get to Osaka, visit Dotonori, sleep then head to Tokyo the next day. \n\nOnce we get back to Tokyo I want to do a day trip to Hakone and hopefully do the hydrangea train, I want to do a day trip to Yokohama to see the Gundam statue and Sanrio place, do a day trip to DisneySea, and I\u2019m trying to figure out what will be a good place to stay to access these day trips? I will be traveling with a group of friends and they may choose to do different activities like day trip to Nikko or Kamakura, or Mount Takao\u2026 so which spot in Tokyo would make transportation the easiest for us?",

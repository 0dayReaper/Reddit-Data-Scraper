    "postText": "Hello! \n\nJust want feedback on this itinerary. We already booked all hotels and flights. Just the hotel in Asahikawa is not yet booked as we are still thinking if we should do it as a shared tour from Sapporo instead of basing in Asahikawa.\n\nSo, the part where we need feedback the most is whether it's worth it to stay in Asahikawa to visit the Farm Tomita + Shikisai no Oka by trains. Or if we should skip Asahikawa completely to stay longer in Sapporo then do a Klook shared tour from Sapporo.\n\nTypes of day tour that I am looking at:\nhttps://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/4160-sapporo-flower-farm-blue-pond-tour-hokkaido/\n\nPro of shared tour:\n- all transport arranged. Just sit in bus\n- can visit more places\n\nCon:\n- may be too rushed for Farm Tomita &amp; Shikisai no Oka\n- actually not super interested in Ningle terrace and blue pond. My biggest wishlist is just the flower field in Farm Tomita and Shikisai no Oka\n\n\nProfile: couple in mid-30s. No kids. Not driving. Will rely on public transport 100%. Likely not taking taxi either due to language barrier. Doesn't speak Japanese, will rely on Google translate.\n\nLikes: shopping, nature, sightseeing\n\n\n\nDay 1: land in Chitose 2 pm. Stay overnight in Sapporo to rest.\n\nDay 2: early morning to Noboribetsu. Visit Jigokudani. Check in at Ryokan at 3 pm to enjoy the onsen.\n\nDay 3: check out Noboribetsu. Will visit the Jigokudani bear park before heading to Lake Toya in afternoon/night by bus or train ( we prefer to take bus instead of train so less hassle )\n\nCheck in to Onsen in Lake Toya (stay 2 nights). May I ask what's the restaurant situations in Noboribetsu &amp; Toya? Do they serve dinners? Or do they all close early?\n\nDay 4: explore Lake Toya\n\nStill unsure how we can do this as we don't drive. We want to take the boat tour but unsure where the pier is. Is the pier near the Toyako bus terminal?\n\nIf have time, go for the Mt Usu ropeway\n\nDay 5: go to Hakodate from Lake Toya\n\nDay 6: Hakodate. South area attractions: Mt Hakodate observatory, Russian Orthodox Church, Cape Tachimachi\n\nDay 7: Hakodate. Goryokukaku then Mt Onuma Park\n\nDay 8: go to Asahikawa from Hakodate\n\nwe are unsure about whether to still go to Asahikawa. The only reason we go to Asahikawa is to visit Farm Tomita and Shikisai no Oka. Otherwise, there is nothing in Asahikawa that interest us. Going day trip to Sounkyo is out of question. If we don't stay in Asahikawa any more, then we will head to Sapporo from Hakodate. But we feel that we may run out of things to do in Sapporo if we stay so long there. Any recommendation what to do in Asahikawa? We are not interested in the zoo or the ramen village.\n\nNote that if we don't stay in Asahikawa, we are thinking about joining Farm Tomita day tour from Sapporo by Klook. But that means staying in Farm Tomita for only 1 hour. Is it enough?\n\nDay 9: From Asahikawa, visit Shikisai no Oka, Alpaca farm near Shikisai no Oka, Farm Tomita\n\nHow feasible is this by train and walking? I am thinking about going to Farm Tomita first by the normal JR train and then walk from Nakafurano. If we take the lavender farm special train ( https://www.farm-tomita.co.jp/en/sp/access/station.asp ), we will arrive only at Farm Tomita at 11 am ish, which is where all the tour bus arrive. \n\nHow feasible it is to go from Farm Tomita to Shikisai no Oka by train in the same day?\n\nDay 10: Go from Asahikawa early to Sapporo by train. Half a day sightseeing in Sapporo. Not sure where. Will wing it.\n\nDay 11: otaru day trip from Sapporo\n\nDay 12 : Sapporo. Clock tower. TV Tower, Hokkaido Shrine.\n\nDay 13: Sapporo. Mt Moiwa and Shiroi Koibito Park.\n\nDay 15: Sapporo. Shopping\n\nDay 16: 8 pm flight home. Will spend the half day souvenir shopping etc and just chill",

When we arrive at Sapporo on day 1 it will be after a long 13 hour overnight flight with transit (where we won't be sleeping on plane). Sleep deprivation with another train + bus combo to Noboribetsu is not what we want to do. If we go to Noboribetsu straight from airport, we just want the direct bus option so we can rest in bus. But when I checked there is only one bus timing a day from Chitose to Noboribetsu... And that bus departs before we land in Chitose.",

You need at least half a day to be able to appreciate the fields, and various activities there.\n\nYou can take Furano-Biei Norokko-go from Asahikawa station, this will stop at Lavender farm station (Lavender batake), which is only around 500m to Farm Tomita. You can use JP rail pass for this.\n\nThen you can go back to Shikisai no Oka. \n\nYou'll walk around 10 km on that day. So if you don't feel confidence about it, consider take a tour. Hokkaido is pretty much a car society anyway.",

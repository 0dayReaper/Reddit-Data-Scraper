I saw this very helpful [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/822o3n/michelin_star_map_of_tokyo/) made a year ago but I wanted more metadata (pricing, rating, amenities), so I ended up creating my own.\n\nI thought it was a good idea to share it with the community to help like-minded travelers.\n\n[Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Yh4wtLR-L7r2DLmJc_7HJH4QmV4e4rQjJlKybv-K_k/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WwcUA4UyztO77BdMVrtYHmcc7NGtRw5L&amp;usp=sharing)\n\nThis is the [source code](https://github.com/pjolayres/michelin-guide-crawler) for those of you who are interested.",

Also I'm not sure if they technically retained the Michelin star at the new location, but the food was certainly that good!",

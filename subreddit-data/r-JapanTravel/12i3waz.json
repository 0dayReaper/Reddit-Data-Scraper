I'd suggest moving Pokemon Center and Nintendo shops (or any other super popular shops in general) to the morning if you can. Lines can get crazy if you're not careful.\n3. Uhhh Maidreamin is not exactly somewhere you explore, more like you just kinda get a show along with your food really. I'd almost recommend moving Akiba down to the end of your trip? Just because it's really a place to spend money and buy stuff. Unless you're there to soak up the vibe of all the anime/manga stuff around.\n4. You're not going to dotonbori in Osaka? Bruh\n5. I honestly would move some stuff around to take more advantage of your JR Pass. Right now I think you only have like 3 days you're going around western Japan? You're not even going to a ryokan and an onsen!\n6. I know Japanese transit is known for being on time, but there's a lot of public transit options available. I think you can kind of chill on the exact timings unless it's the shinkansen and the more out of the way places.",

Is there any IC card at the airport that allows refunds?",

You can get either from the airport. \n\nThe regular versions can be refunded and lasts 10 years from its last use. I use this because I'm visiting every year or 2.\n\nOP mentioned getting the welcome suica, which is targeted at tourists. It has nicer designs but you can't get a refund and it expires after a month. The only reason you get this is if you want to keep it as a souvenir of your trip.",

I misplaced my Suica before my 2020 trip and didn't want to get another Suica, (as I have a 2nd one I misplaced, JR East use to have special limited edition cards like the ones from ICOCA) so I got a Welcome Suica.  I brought it down to 0 and left with my souvenir card.  \nIf you're not going back to Japan and are coming into say HND but leaving from KIX, you will not have an opportunity to get back your deposit on a regular Suica/Pasmo.  \nThe Passport Pasmo is much cuter than the Welcome Suica but does have a 500 yen issuing fee, so you're paying 500 yen for that cuter card.  It has the same restrictions as the Welcome Suica.  It's up to you whether you think the cuter card is worth 500 yen.",

Even for things like Starbucks, in the sakura season there were lines up to FIVE HOURS to enter. There were huge lines to get into many of the character stores too. Obviously that's the peak-of-the-peak, but you'll waste a lot of time if you're committing to doing stuff. If somewhere on the list is busy, just give up and go somewhere else, it'll be just as good.",

It looks to me that whatever site you are using to pull your routings only indicates the first train line, and does not show the transfers that are required.\n\nExample:  Take Yurikamome Line from Odaiba-kaihink\u014den Station to Asakusa Station.\n\nYurikamome does not travel this full route. It should say, take Yurikamome Line from Odaiba-kaihink\u014den to Shimbashi Station and then transfer to Tokyo Metro Ginza Line to Asakusa Station.\n\nI think if you are serious about the extensive plan you need to explicitly think through the transfers because as written you will get very confused.",

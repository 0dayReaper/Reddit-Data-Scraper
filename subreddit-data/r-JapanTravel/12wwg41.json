    "postText": "So after my initial itinerary post up and some suggestions on some things (primarily to cut some things down) in order to have actual fun on the trip and not act like a weird and bad tourist, I went back to the drawing board and been working on it since. I have created a big ol' spreadsheet which I am willing to share if people want to see that but I figure the sketch out of the general itinerary will be enough for most of ya'll. \n\nOh...things to note:\n\nWe will be going in 2024. I am aware that I am planning things waaaaay in advance but it helps make sure we will be prepared in full. \n\nWe will also be getting a 14 day JR Pass and, yes, I am aware of the hike in price going to happen. Very sad that we wont be going prior to the change over. I have gone over prices of current fares using google maps/Navitime Japan Travel and Hyperdia and worked out the math to be sure it is cost efficient. Heck, I even calculated the idea of getting an international drivers license and renting (that wound up be super expensive). \n\nThe reason the first day mentions milk and breakfast items to be picked up and stored in the hotel room is my husbands stomach produces too much acid and so he requires milk and some sort of cereal or granola to help him in the mornings, so at each hotel I made sure fridge in the room was a thing and so forth.\n\nOn the itinerary there will be things listed in bold, those are the things we absolutely want to do with the others around it as a: well, if we are able to. \n\n Tokyo Oct 12 (arrive pref 1-3 pm, get through quarantine/immigration/customs hopefully by 5pm and taxi/airport limo(?) to hotel byt 6. May have to grab dinner at the airport and then go. Get checked in and get things dropped off. Head out to a FamilyMart, 7-11, Lawsons or something like that for Milk, breakfast needs and other desired to have on hand snacks. Try to make sure bedtime is 9 pm. \n\n Tokyo October 13th - Senso-ji / **Walk to Tokyo Skytree / Walk to Pokemon Center Skytree and shop around Skytree Town** / Sumida Hokusai Museum (if time) / **Walk to Art Aquarium Ginza**  / **teamlab Planets!

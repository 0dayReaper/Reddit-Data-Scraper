    "postText": "Went during golden week, but not during the public holiday. Was expecting hordes of people so I arrived 30 minutes before opening. We bought rice balls from this shop at the station. There were already people queueing ahead of us but it didn\u2019t pose a problem. Let the staff know that you\u2019re a foreigner and they\u2019ll let you do a health declaration. Since I bought my tickets on klook, I just had to scan the QR code to enter. I found out that there\u2019s a cute physical ticket that you can get if you purchase on site though! \n\nI\u2019m an avid Sanrio lover and collector, while my partner is just alright with it. \n\nThe tip is to go straight for the boat ride to avoid a queue. There are 2 main rides, but the boat ride is way better and longer than my melody\u2019s drive. Go down the stairway and it\u2019ll be there on your left. They\u2019ll snap a picture during the boat ride, so if you want to get a cute headband before that, do it at your risk! My melody\u2019s drive also had multiple photo opportunities where they sell the picture to you. \n\nThere are many Sanrio shops located around, but the largest is the one on ground level when you enter the place on the right. There is also puroland exclusive merch, but those didn\u2019t really appeal to us haha. \n\nWe didn\u2019t eat there because the food looked cute, but a little unappetising (blue curry wasn\u2019t really enticing to us). There is reentry so we just headed out to eat. \n\nThere are multiple shows throughout the day, but they are in Japanese. The performers are SO energetic it was honestly such a good vibe. I didn\u2019t stay for the last 2 shows which I feel quite sad about because I believe the last show was like a disco rave. But each show has their own unique element to it and different parts of the park are illuminated. They also use Japanese at the level of a kindergartener so it\u2019s not impossible to follow along if you have a basic understanding of the language/watch loads of anime. \n\nIn the center, there are also \u201cactivities\u201d for you, like a gudetama love meter and a bell to ring for good luck. All of which were fun and highly enjoyable. \n\nThere was also a meet and greet event that I had to sign up in advance for. There are 4 characters or so throughout the day and you can head back with the QR code they give you. \n\nOverall had a super pleasant time being in a space with Sanrio lovers. There are hardcore fans who are very interesting to be around, there are also photographers during the concert events, as well as people who dance along. Felt a bit like a kpop concert actually. \n\nI\u2019ve read reviews on google where people were disappointed with the number of rides the place had to offer. I personally felt like it was quite little too, but the other rooms and experiences made up for it. So one should adjust their expectations that this isn\u2019t a typical theme park like USJ where it is ride-centric. But rather, it\u2019s more about just going around the park to enjoy the attractions and take pictures! So I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to people who are lukewarm about Sanrio, but people who are excited about it! Throughout the day I noticed the boat ride had a maximum waiting time of 1h-1h15min which is way shorter than what people on google reported: 2-3 hours of wait. \nWas genuinely surprised considering it was golden week.\n\nFeel free to read about the rest of my trip report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/13i98yx/trip_report_japan_golden_week_30_apr_14_may_2023/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1)\n\nAs well as my trip report on USJ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/13g1q0b/usj_trip_report_11_may_2023_thursday_with_queue/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1)",

The wait for the ride was 90 minutes when we went, with PuroPass it was like 15 minutes. With a kid in tow it was totally worth it!",

We left for lunch and watched 2 of their shows (30min each) We also didn\u2019t face a queue longer than 10-15 min for either rides. However I did spend a long time in each of the shops. \nHopefully you don\u2019t face much of a queue either! I think it\u2019s possible to complete the bulk of the park within that time frame without the puropass if the queues aren\u2019t too crazy. Have fun :)",

I'm still on the fence if we should just go somewhere else because we'd be there during summer vacation and on a Saturday at that. lol.   \n\n\nBased on your comment, it's possible that most of our time would be spent on queuing if we arrive there in the afternoon.",

    "postText": "Hello. I am traveling to Shirakawa-go this June 2023 for 2 days 1 night, staying at Bunroku. So far I have yet to see any post regarding tourists trying out the rafting activity (River Tour) organized by Shirakawago-Go Activity Center. May I know if anyone here has tried the activity and could you please share your experience? Is there a place to shower after the activity since I planned to go rafting after I check out from Bunroku on the 2nd day?\n\nAlso, since I am not driving so may I know how do I get around Shirakawa-go? Is there a local bus and what are the bus intervals?",

I will highlight to get to Shirakawa-ago you need to book bus tickets in advance, so I\u2019d recommend doing that whenever you get the chance (I say that as I sit in a city I\u2019m not staying at, waiting for the train to Kanazawa, cause all the buses back to Kanazawa were fully booked).",

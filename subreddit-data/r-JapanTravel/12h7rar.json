You still will have them around you and you can see them or pet them, but they are a lot less aggressive and no longer molest tourists or eat any scrap of paper.\n\nThe deer at Nara can still be fed.  They can be very aggressive. \n\nBTW it's Himeji not Hijemi or Hijeme.",

A nice garden?\n\n'I honestly see the deer as a negative, they're very aggressive, but my kid liked them.\n\nWe went to Miyajima in 2017, after the feeding ban, and there were still plenty of deer around if you wanted pictures with them, they just were no longer going into people's jacket pockets to eat napkins , eating cigarette butts, eating tourist maps, and eating rail passes.  I saw the 3 former happen and heard someone saw the latter back in the day.",

There was a large group of them all chilling in the shade near front of miyajima island entrance of the jetty. They were still pretty naughty. If you sat down and eat snacks or have your bag beside you, they will come up and try to steal what you have or stick their noses into your open bags.",

I did not find the deer aggressive, but if you held the crackers visibly they were contact seeking, which could be overwhelming if several grouped around you. \n\nOverall, the feeding deer-thing felt like a tourist gimmick, but the park with its several temples and all the deer was beautiful. The vibe in Nara city was nice as well.",

But what I really liked was Miyajima at night, when most crowds were gone.\nWe stayed at a ryokan with a really great dinner.\n\nActually I wished we stayed a bit longer in Miyajima, because we didn't any of the hiking!",

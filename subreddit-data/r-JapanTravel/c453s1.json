    "postText": "Hi all, this subreddit has been very useful for new and seasoned tourists alike. I have been to Japan twice and would be going back there again this year. As I was researching on things to buy for my upcoming trip, I decided why not compile a shopping list and post it on /r/JapanTravel? \n\nFeel free to add to the comments section below and I'll add them to the list accordingly. Hope that you find this useful!\n\n----\n**Food**\n\n1. Tea: Apart from Matcha, Japan is also known for their Gyokuro (One of the highest grade of Japanese tea available and is characterised by its fine green color, rich aroma and mellow sweet flavor), and Genmaicha (a Japanese brown rice green tea consisting of green tea mixed with roasted popped brown rice).\n2. KitKat: If you're visiting Japan for the first time, the number of flavours for KitKat can be overwhelming. They range from the regular matcha KitKat to the more interesting Sake and even Wasabi flavours!\n3. Tokyo Banana: This isn't a fruit, but a type of fluffy cake filled with banana custard cream. A must-buy when you're visiting Japan.\n4. Shiroi Koibito: Shiroi Koibito is a European-style cookie with chocolate sandwiched in between. Another famous item for gift giving.\n5. Baumkuchen: a German speciality that has been japanified. It's a sort of a cake. \n6. Furikake: Japanese rice seasoning to make rice taste so much better\n\n\n---\n**Clothing**\n\n1. Jeans: Japanese denim jeans are famous for their quality. Their unique fabrics which are designed by the companies themselves. Check out [/r/rawdenim](https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/) for more information. Some famous brands are Japan blue, Samurai jeans, Oni, Pure blue, Iron Heart.\n\n2. Sneakers: Japan is famous for its wide variety of sneakers. A good pair of sneakers can be practical and also may have designs not available back in your home country. The famous brands are Adidas, Nike, Onitsuka Tigers.\n3. Other clothing: Uniqlo and Gu have almost every clothing for all occasions. Most have exclusive designs only available in Japan. Not only are they fashionable, they are very affordable as well.\n\n---\n**Others**\n\n1. Knives: Japanese knives are famous for being incredibly strong and sharp. Of course, with high quality comes a higher price. Why not consider adding a Japanese knife to your kitchen? Some examples are Shun, Masamoto \n2. Cosmetics: This requires no introduction. There's just too many to choose from. Masks, cleansers, toners are also way cheaper in Japan than back home. I personally use brands from Hada Labo and DHC.\n3. Camera equipment: Photography is an expensive hobby. However, shutterbugs can rejoice as in Japan it's generally cheaper (of course depending on the lens you buy). If you're on a tight budget, you may even consider getting a second hand camera (or lens) in Map Camera. They are known for their quality control and are very transparent about the conditions of the item (even to the most miniscule issue about the product).\n4. Glasses: From as low as $50 USD, get a brand new pair of spectacles or sunglasses made in under an hour. Select from a list of trendy frames along with lenses that cater to a variety of needs (Astigmatism, PC lens, thin lens with high refractive index) and you're ready to go. These glasses can be found mainly from shops like Zoff and Jins.\n5. Watches: Adding to the list of must buys in Japan, watches (like Seiko) are a must have when you visit. Many are made only in the Japanese Market. \n6. Umbrellas: Grab a quality made in Japan umbrella when you're visiting. There's umbrellas that form a sakura pattern when it rains! \n7. Limited editions CDs: many artists have CDs only available in the country and unreleased to the rest of the world. \n8. Washlets: definitely do check them out if you've ever tried a Japanese toilet. \n9. Japanese stationery: for artists and tourists alike, Japan has no lack of variety of stationery and arts stuff.",

So much easier. Plus, if you're like me and have a lot of friends who are kind of 'meh' about traditional Japanese sweets, Hokkaido snacks are guaranteed to be a hit. \n\nSpecial recommendations: shiroi koibito, jaga pokkuru, and basically anything with Royce on the box.",

There is a huge array of flavors and available from smaller pastry shops as well as at Muji\n\nSakura - all of the cherry blossom flavored goods are worth a try if you like a light cherry taste. \n\nKappabashi kitchen goods - this is a great place to find stainless steel and ceramic goods that are made in Japan. \n\nLimited edition CDs / music - many artists have CDs that are only available in Japan with unreleased elsewhere songs or even full albums, like one of my favorites, Avicii.",

I\u2019m returning to Japan for a third time and I really love buying unique Japanese things, or products that are much cheaper in Japan. I hope to find more things to buy lol\n\nHere are my recommendations:\n\nFood\n1. Calbee Chips (specifically potato sticks/ \u3058\u3083\u304c\u308a)\nThey are really exceptionally crispy and unlike any other chip I\u2019ve had, have never been able to locate them outside of Japan either!\n2. Langue du Chat Matcha biscuits\nThese are thin, crispy wafer like biscuits that are really popular \n3. Pocky\nSimilar to kit kat, pocky flavours are so diverse and amazing. My favourite is the adult pocky with the extra crispy stick, coated with nuts and chocolate. I recently tried Cherry mega pocky from Sapporo and it was so good!\n\nClothing\n1. Ichizawa Shinzaburo Canvas Bags[ in Kyoto](https://www.ichizawa.co.jp/en/about/) \nThese bags are not sold anywhere else except their flagship store in Kyoto. They are quite pricey but excellent quality, minimal bags with many styles. They have tax exemption too over a certain amount. \n2. For women I recommend the brand PUNYUS which has a shop in Shibuya109. They are very Japan/quirky style clothing which goes from size s- 2xl. As a foreigner I can barely fit most one size Japanese fashion so I love this brand for the style and sizes. \n\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of right now \ud83e\udd23",

            "comment": "&gt;Tea: Apart from Matcha, Japan is also known for their Gyokuro (One of the highest grade of Japanese tea available and is characterised by its fine green color, rich aroma and mellow sweet flavor), and Genmaicha (a Japanese brown rice green tea consisting of green tea mixed with roasted popped brown rice).\n\nGood options, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Gyokuro is pretty expensive, but regular sencha is a good one to get also. One of my favorites, which I use for cold-brew iced tea, is hojicha. It doesn't even need sugar. Mugicha (barley tea) is another interesting choice for iced tea. It's popular in Japan and Korea, but not so much in the West.\n\nHaving said that, most of these teas can be purchased in the West, too, just not as cheaply in some cases.\n\n&gt;Shiroi Koibito: Shiroi Koibito is a European-style cookie with chocolate sandwiched in between. Another famous item for gift giving.\n\nI think this mainly an omiyage from Hokkaido. The style is pretty common and often called *langue de chat*. But, honestly, they're not that special. Most packaged omiyage foods aren't. Some people go nuts over Royce nama chocolates (basically just truffles), which are okay. But overall, unless you're buying for a Japanese person or you're buying something you've tried and know to be good, they tend to be a disappointment. One exception to this is nama yatsuhashi, or anything made from mochi, really. I've also seen some daifuku-like things that are packaged to bring home. But all of these tastier treats are pretty expensive relative to the usual omiyage stuff.\n\nSome other food/drink ideas are ramen kits (not to be confused with cup ramen) or other packaged noodles, sake, umeshu, shochu and whisky. \n\n&gt;Knives: Japanese knives are famous for being incredibly strong and sharp. Of course, with high quality comes a higher price. Why not consider adding a Japanese knife to your kitchen? Some examples are Shun, Masamoto\n\nThis is true, though a lot of the larger brands are widely available outside of Japan. For those on a budget, consider the brand Mac, which makes very good quality knives at a more reasonable price. And consider getting something made locally. For example, I went to Tower Knives in Osaka and got a high-carbon gyuto from a smaller maker in Sakai. It's been very nice to use. \n\n&gt;Camera equipment: Photography is an expensive hobby. However, shutterbugs can rejoice as in Japan it's generally cheaper (of course depending on the lens you buy). \n\nReally? I only look at Nikon gear, but whenever I do here, I always find it to be more expensive than what I was used to seeing in the US. I'm going to give Map Camera's used gear a look, though.\n\nAnother store to check out is Muji. There are some outside of Japan now, too, but just like Uniqlo, the selection is often best in Japan.\n\nSomething I've bought before for gifts are furoshiki. These can be given as-is, or you can use them to wrap another gift. You'll see them all over in touristy areas, though they can be overpriced there.\n\nAnd something I didn't realize was that Japan has a lot of quality stationary. Places like Loft have some cool stuff and there are dedicated stores, too. It's not really my thing, but I know a lot of people like it.\n\nAlso, there are all the Japanese character goods. So if you or a loved one is into Gudetama, Rilakkuma, Totoro, One Piece, etc. there are a ton of stores to check out. Plus you can always get something they may not have heard about like Usamaru or Cheburashka.\n\nLastly, keep an eye out for local specialities. For example, I live in Tokushima, which is famous for sudachi (a citrus fruit) and aizome (indigo dyed) clothes. So there are drinks and treats made with sudachi and clothing or fabric items made with the indigo dye. You can even do the dying yourself and bring that back.\n\nEDIT: Another thing that you can technically get outside of Japan, but is a little easier in Japan, is real wasabi. Either the paste or the rhizome itself, though I don't know if customs would give you trouble with that one.",

And they make good gifts, because in my experience most people aren't terribly into tea, so they probably don't know about all the different kinds they can get if they do a little looking. But perhaps the gift of tea from a trip to Japan will open them up to that.",

There were some other stainless steel knives I was considering that weren't as expensive, but the high carbon one was just so nice to use. The cool thing about a place like Tower Knives is that you can test all the different knives out before you buy. And they have a range of types and prices. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind if it's for a gift is that high carbon knives require extra care, because they can easily rust. Nothing major really, just wash and hand-dry thoroughly after each use. Also, it's recommended to periodically sharpen your knives. So keep that in mind when choosing a type of knife as some require it more frequently.",

I'm going to give Map Camera's used gear a look, though.\n\nObviously it depends on what specifically you're looking at, but for new-ish gear used shops in Japan are generally as cheap or cheaper than eBay or reputable used shops in the US--especially if you're shopping duty free.  For vintage gear Japan is generally not cheaper in my experience, but the selection and quality is amazing.  Most camera accessories (tripods, bags, etc.) from major brands are more expensive in Japan unless the brand is Japan-specific.  \n\nI say this as a Nikon shooter--I always shop for lenses when in Japan.",

Places like Jins have a system to make it easy even if there's a language barrier. Also, Japanese tests differ from those in the US in that there are no letters used, but rather broken circles. You tell them if the gap in the circle is on top, bottom, right or left. You can just point, too.\n\nIt's super easy. And Jins basically stocks all the most common prescriptions in each location, so you do the 5-10 min test, pick out a frame and they cut a pair of lenses to that shape. They can have it ready in an hour or two, usually. Now, these won't be as nice as a pair of glasses from a high-end retailer, but for the price, they are difficult to beat.",

Most camera accessories (tripods, bags, etc.) from major brands are more expensive in Japan unless the brand is Japan-specific.",

It's very difficult to find cheap Japanese books abroad. (You could also order online instead)\n\nAlso, puzzles: nanoblock and its spin-offs, paper craft models, puzzles (high quality and often inventive, like stained glass or with smaller pieces), crystal glass 3d puzzles etc. You can see a wide selection at BIC Camera, Tokyo Hands, Loft etc. but Amazon will typically be cheaper for buying them.

I never bought furikake when I was in Japan but at my local Daiso its only $1.50-2.",

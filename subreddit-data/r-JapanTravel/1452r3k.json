    "postText": "Hello, I would like to seek fellow redditors opinions, input and recommendation on how I could better finetune my itinerary better. There's only so much I can think of, and plan as an individual, but with everyone's input and comments I can further refine and enhance the travel experience before I set foot into Japan. Do forgive me in advance for the theorycrafting wall of text.\n\nI know it may be difficult to review the itinerary, so to make the review easier I have broken the itinerary down into specific sub-groups e.g. Shikoku, Kinki etc. Specific questions that I have are bolded.\n\nThank you in advance for taking your time to provide your opinions!\n\n\\-------------\n\nBaseline information\n\n* 32M, average fitness, solo traveller\n* Public transport only (challenge); I have a driver's license but I have not drove a car for god knows how long so I would prefer not to test it against the green hills of Shikoku\n* Interest: anime (select few), experience autumn/nature, visiting secluded spots, and just trying *random stuff*\n* JP language skill: rudimentary at best (N4), but I will not shy away from speaking in simple, broken japanese or use a translator to communicate. Reading/interpreting kanji is not a problem (in general).\n* Visit history: Visited twice (once to Hokkaido for \\~8 days, and once toKyoto and Osaka for 8 days\n* Will probably travel around with a (slightly) oversized luggage at \\~166cm (A+B+C), that\u2019s the only one I have with me. This will be a problem on the Shinkansen (but hopefully not so much on sightseeing trains/limited expresses).\n* Will be visiting during (almost) peak autumn at 11 November, and will depart on the 16th of December\n* Jet lag is unlikely to be a problem (1h time difference), but nevertheless I will maintain a low tempo on the first day to acclimatize to the environment\n* Only thing firmed as of now is the air ticket, everything else is up in the air.\n* I like planning/min-maxing to some degree, though I recognize that I may not fulfill all objectives during the trip and I am totally ok with that \\[its just a guideline or framework to give the holiday some structure, that\u2019s all.\\] FWIW, I personally like traveling at a high tempo pace like some japanese travel show do (e.g. \u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u8def\u7dda\u30d0\u30b9\u4e57\u308a\u7d99\u304e\u306e\u65c5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpecific goals/objective:\n\n1. Experience Shikoku in autumn (specifically the views at Iya Valley) and in other prefectures (thus making nature sightseeing more of a priority this time round)\n2. Experience Kanazawa for anime stuff\n3. Experience the Shimanami Kaido in full (including any sightseeing spots in between the 6 island chains)\n4. *Bonus - try as many sightseeing trains as possible.*\n5. *Bonus - if weather, time and schedule permits, try skiing as an option in Nagano.*\n6. *Bonus - stay in as many onsen ryokans as possible, without breaking the bank.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocked-in prefectures \\[i.e. I will definitely go to those prefectures no matter what\\]:\n\n1. Shikoku (as per above objective)\n2. Hiroshima (because its on the opposite end of the Shimanami Kaido)\n3. Kanazawa (for anime related reason)\n4. Tokyo (that is my starting and end point so it has to be included by default)\n\nAll other prefectures are basically *float* i.e. I am open to consider dropping said itinerary for something else based on your suggestion that aligns with my preferences/interest. Most of the other locations I added are prefectures that are often next to each other, or well-connected (apart from the initial Tokyo --&gt; Kagawa jump via Sunrise Seto/Shinkansen).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWait-list prefectures (prefectures that I want to go, but I don\u2019t think I can realistically fit in without dropping other locations):\n\n1. Snow skiing at Nagano (depending on how cooperative the weather is in early-ish December (would 2 days be sufficient?))\n2. Ehime, Kochi expansion \\[spend 1-3 more days\\]\n3. Izu Peninsula (\\~2 days, via *Saphir Odoriko*)\n4. Nagoya + lower Nagano (Kiso Valley) (\\~3 days)\n5. Ishikawa expansion \\[1 extra day at Kaga\\]\n\nI am open to dropping a few days in Tokyo/Osaka etc to make that trade off \\[currently kept 3 days free for further development\\]. Alternatively, if the planning can be better optimized based on your inputs I might be able to do one of those without compromising on the base set. I would like to hear your opinion on what locations you would drop in the itinerary to make time for one of the above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGeneral planning philosophy:\n\n1. My itineary adopts a breadth approach (cover as much area as I can humanely possible without rushing/touch-and-go) as opposed to depth (i.e. spending much more time within Shikoku than what I allocated); though I would be open to considering more days at selected locations if you have strong recommendations. My thought is to experience how different autumn is at various parts of the country (if possible), and maybe winter too (to a certain degree).\n2. Due to the nature of my travel, I note that luggage logistics is a critical consideration when moving between prefectures; my thought is to park that luggage at the next hotel as quickly as possible so that I can free myself for sightseeing within the vicinity, or leave the luggage at the hotel after I check out until I am ready to travel to the next location. I will need to send (quite a fair bit of) emails to the hotels to confirm on this prior to booking.\n3. I will attempt to minimize transit time between prefectures to no more than 2\\~3 hours a day to avoid having excessively long transport days (except the initial Tokyo --&gt; Kagawa jump).\n4. Because of the long trip, I will also need to factor a bit of downtime at night for administrative stuff (e.g. catching up a little bit on work, laundry etc).\n\n\\---------\n\n**Shikoku (\\~7 days)**\n\nSpecific thoughts while planning:\n\n1. I will need to exploit Limited Express trains as much as possible to minimize downtime between the 4 prefectures. Fortunately, for the most part these train frequencies are almost hourly, thus missing one train isnt too deadly consequence-wise.\n2. The transfer between Kochi and Ehime \\[Matsuyama\\] is oddly quicker via express bus as opposed to trains (!)\n3. For Kochi, my opinion is that it is best explored on car instead of public transport \\[it\u2019s a really wide prefecture\\]; I feel that 1 day may not do it justice, but it is probably adequate for exploring the city centre as a whole.\n4. There's a fair bit of uncertainties while planning this leg so I would deeply appreciate any advice you may have.\n5. This current iteration is unable to weave in the *Shikoku Mannaka Sennen Monogatari* sightseeing train *\\[\u56db\u56fd\u307e\u3093\u306a\u304b\u5343\u5e74\u3082\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a\\]* ; if you people think its something not to be missed do let me know and I will reshuffle my timetable as such.\n\nDay 0: Tokyo --&gt; Kagawa (Sunrise Seto) \\[Saturday, 11 Nov\\]\n\n* Touch down at Narita at 1720hours\n* Transfer to Tokyo Station via NEX or Skyliner\n* Settle administrative matters at the Midori-no-Maruguchi (e.g. get all the booked tickets etc from JR Pass, for Shinkansen and all other sightseeing trains) at Tokyo Station.\n* IF Sunrise Seto ticket is obtained via the JR West portal booking, chill till 2200 and take Sunrise Seto to reach Kagawa (Takamatsu) at 0700 the next day. Try to snag the ticket online (likely via the japanese portal since there's no option to buy Solo Deluxe through the english/international website. Otherwise, compromise and go for Single)\n* IF Sunrise Seto ticket is NOT obtained, proceed to take the furthest possible Shinkansen westwards (probably Okayama) and rest for the night.\n\nDay 1: Kagawa (Takamatsu) \\[Sunday, 12 Nov\\]\n\n* Chill around Takamatsu. Drop luggage at coin locker OR the hotel (near JR Takamatsu ideally)\n* Look at whats left of Takamatsu Castle en route to the port.\n* Day trip to Naoshima or Teshima to visit the art museums (Chichu Art Museum, Lee Ufan Museum etc).\n* Ritsuin Garden in the evening (closes 1830)\n* Find an eatery with Sanuki Udon for dinner if possible.\n\nDay 2: Kagawa (Kotohira) --&gt; Tokushima (Iya Valley) \\[Monday, 13 Nov\\]\n\n* Morning trip from Takamatsu to Kotohira (either via JR or Kotoden). Visit Kotohiragu \\[includes inner shrine\\] and Kanamaruza Theater\n* Return to Kotohira to pick up luggage, transit to Oboke via Limited Express Shimanto \\[Takamatsu --&gt; Tadotsu --&gt; Oboke\\]\n* Retire at a local hotel around Oboke. If time permits, take the chance to explore around Oboke Gorge itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 3: Tokushima (Iya Valley) \\[Tuesday, 14 Nov\\]\n\n**\\[Post-research note: I realized that there is NO public transport to Mount Tsurugi on a weekday. I will have to rent a taxi direct to Mount Tsurugi, make the 'climb', then thereafter take the taxi down to the other attractions. I am inclined to just go full hog on the private taxi and rent it (almost the whole day, probably 7\\~8 hours for 4300yen/hour) to save the trouble.**\n\n**Otherwise, I will need to hike downhill which can be rather rough since its just a single lane road (looking at nearly 10++ km) so I think it wise not to penny pinch in the interest of both time and safety.\\]**\n\nSpend the day at Iya Valley.\n\n* Take a taxi after breakfast to zip to Mount Tsurugi and speedrun it to the mountain peak (aka using the chairlift to speedrun a good chunk of the mountain) about 2.5 hours \\~ 3 hours as per the Iya Valley guide\n* Taxi from Mount Tsurugi chairlift down to Oku-Iya Niju Kazuraashi and cross it (\\~1 hour estimate)\n* Taxi down to visit the mannequins/scarecrows at Nagoro Village (\\~3km downhill from Oku-Iya). (\\~1 hour estimate)\n* Check out the Peeing Boy Statue (\\~0.5 hour estimate \\[its just looking at the statue that is overlooking the entire gorge is it not?\\])\n* Cross the outer vine bridge Iya-no-Kazurabashi (\\~1 hour estimate)\n* Taxi back to Oboke, and retire for the day (\\~0.5 hour estimate, thus looking at about \\~8 hours taxi rental total, with some leeway for lunch break)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 4: Tokushima (Iya Valley) --&gt; Kochi (Kochi) \\[Wednesday, 15 Nov\\]\n\n* Transit from Iya Valley \\[Oboke\\] to Kochi via Limited Express Shimanto (again) after breakfast.  (\\~1 hour transit)\n* Park luggage at hotel \\[ideally near JR Kochi Station\\], then proceed to mill around Kochi, visiting places such as Kochi Castle \\[\u9ad8\u77e5\u57ce\\] and Harimaya Bridge\\[\u306f\u308a\u307e\u3084\u6a4b\\]\n* Transit to Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum \\[\u9ad8\u77e5\u770c\u7acb\u5742\u672c\u9f8d\u99ac\u8a18\u5ff5\u9928\\] via local bus which is also near Katsumatsura Beach incidentally. Chill at Katsumatsura Beach in the evening\n* Return to JR Kochi, dinner/supper at Hirome Market (ideally to try out Kochi's speciality seared bonito). **\\[is visiting the market more preferable during lunch OR dinner?\\]**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 5: Kochi (Kochi) --&gt; Ehime (Imabari) \\[Thursday, 16 Nov\\]\n\n* Complete any remaining items in Kochi in the morning, then transit to Imabari via train (Kochi --&gt; Tadotsu --&gt; Imabari), via Limited Express Shimanto (yet again!) and Ishidzuchi\\*\\*\\[TBC: this might be better done via highway bus instead which is faster at \\~2-3 hours\\]\\*\\*\n* Drop luggage at Imabari for the next 2 days, either at Sunrise Itoyama OR Cycle no Ie. \\[both are well positioned for the Shimanami Kaido, and are also one of the selected hotels eligible for the Sagawa luggage transfer.\\] Ideally done just around lunch time, so that there's still the better half of the day to explore Imabari.\n* Spend the remainder of the day visiting Imabari Castle (closes 1700) and Towel Museum (slightly out of the way) (closes 1800) \\[TBC: I note this place is quite out of the way from Imabari itself, even the JP website suggests taking a taxi (!) there from the nearby train station. Might have to drop this).\n* Attempt to try some Ehime-related food specialties e.g. Taimeshi (Sea Bream), Ehime oranges, Champon for the next 2 days\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 6: Ehime (Matsuyama / Imabari) \\[Friday, 17 Nov\\]\n\n* Take the Limited express train Ishidzuchi to Matsuyama day tripping. (\\~1h one-way).\n* Explore Matsuyama Castle, and the nearby Matsuyama Ropeway Shopping Street\n* Visit Shiki Memorial Museum\n* Visit Dogo Onsen \\[and attempt to soak in the waters if possible\\].\n* Also consider looking at Ishiteji (\u77f3\u624b\u5bfa) beside Dogo Onsen.\n* Bonus: Subject to train schedule, if possible, attempt to secure tickets for the Iyonada Sightseeing Train (\u4f0a\u4e88\u7058\u7269\u8a9e), Futami leg \\[\u53cc\u6d77\u3075\u305f\u307f \u7de8\\] , and also visit JR Shimonada Station (JR\u4e0b\u7058\u99c5) at the same time.\n* Bonus: visit Yawatahama Port where the movie Suzume took reference from,\n* Return to Imabari via the same Limited express Ishidzuchi and retire for the night.\n\nDay 7: Ehime (Imabari) --&gt; Hiroshima (Shinamani Kaido) \\[Saturday, 18 Nov\\]\n\nI am of the opinion that 1 day in Shimanami Kaido is adequate if I attempt just the main route which is about 80km \\[as a test run, I did 70km and finished it within 6-7 hours with lunch breaks included\\]. For now I will plan for two full days, however should I truncate it down to one day later, I will add an extra day to either explore Matsuyama or Okayama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Start off at *Sunrise Itoyama* \\[watch the sunrise, have breakfast here, cafeteria opens at 0700, rental opens at 0800\\] OR *Cycle no Ie*. Do paperwork to send luggage over to the next accomodation via Sagawa.\n* I will (probably) follow the recommended 'extended' route on *Cycle no Ie'*s website and do the following:\n   * Take the west coast for Oshima (\\~13km) and cross to Hakatajima, with possible stop on:\n      * Mount Kiro Observatory Point \\[I am aware that there's a steep incline so this would be contingent on my physical/mental status by then\\].\n      * Nagahama Beach\n* Take the coastal route for Hakatajima (\\~17km) and cross to Omishima and enjoy the coastal scenery\n* Take the coastal route (again) for Omishima (\\~41km) (or lesser depending on how I'm feeling at that point) , with possible stop on:\n   * \\-TBC: Okunoshima (there is apparently a ferry route to the well-known rabbit island via Omishima port. Not sure if anyone else have tried this particular route and if this is a better approach than going through Tadano-umi (though I would acknowledge that there's historical stuff to visit in nearby Takehara), and I would not be able to buy rabbit food in advance).\\[Based on Google Earth estimate, its about 3km for the entire island loop - seems doable within 2 hours to tour the poison gas museum with a bike and pet some rabbits).\n   * Oyamazumi Shrine Treasure Museum\n* End the day at WAKKA (Omishima) OR Guesthouse NEST / Soil Setoda (Ikuchijima) just beside Kousanji / The Hill of Hope (closes 1700). If possible, visit before closing, otherwise defer to next day.\n* Try the ice cream at Dolce at Ikuchijima if possible.\n* Bonus: if for some reason I am still ahead of time at this juncture (&lt;1500), proceed to finish Innoshima and Mukaishima, then take a ferry to backtrack to Wakka/Soil Setoda or cycle back (last boat is \\~1700) and rest; however, the next day I will zip straight to Onomichi via ferry after breakfast.\n\n\\--------\n\n**Hiroshima + Yamaguchi (\\~4 days)**\n\nSpecific thoughts while planning:\n\n1. Onomichi is a pretty good base to jump to Okayama to explore Okayama, Kurashiki or Tomonoura with the Shinkansen accessibility, but it is impossible to cover them all within a single day. If I finish the Shimanami Kaido within a single day or finish it early on the second day, I will have that extra time to visit those.\n2. There's another sightseeing train etSETOra from Onomichi to Hiroshima but it only operates on Monday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday. For now the schedule could fit the train timetable pretty nicely.\n3. Would anyone suggest visiting Miyajima in the morning or in the evening? This would help me determine the order for the Kintaikyo Bridge/Miyajima day trip. Watching the sunset at either destination is pretty good in my books.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 8: Hiroshima (Shinamani Kaido --&gt; Onomichi) \\[Sunday, 19 Nov\\]\n\n* Continue from Ikuchijima towards Innoshima and Mukaishima (\\~18km) via the western coast route after breakfast, with possible stops on the following areas:\n   * Innoshima: Innoshima Flower Centre, Shimanami Beach \\[open to more suggestions\\]\n   * Mukaishima : there seems to be a lot of brunch places like Willows Nursery etc, soak the view at Mukaishima Rest Park \\[TBC: open to more suggestions\\]\n\nIdeally reach Onomichi just around lunch or earlier. Chill for the rest of the day, and if I'm still up for it, explore Onomichi, including but not limited to:\n\n* Exploring the cat alley\n* Visit the exhibits at Onomichi City Museum of Art\n* Consider walking to Senkoji and Onomichi Hondori Shopping Street\n* Look into trying Onomichi-style ramen.\n\nRetire at a guesthouse/hotel near JR Onomichi that I have forwarded the luggage to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 9: Hiroshima (Onomichi, Takehara+Kure OR Tomonoura OR Okayama) --&gt; Downtown Hiroshima) \\[Monday, 20 Nov\\]\n\n* Mill around Onomichi in the morning (if not done yesterday), with a side trip to EITHER Takehara/Kure OR Okayama/Kurashiki OR Tomonoura (choose one):\n   * Takehara: stroll along the historical townscape \\[and look if they have any Tamayura-related merch\\], Okunoshima (if not done during the Shimanami Kaido leg / Kure: look into trying Kure curry/Niku-jaga and visit the Yamato Museum\n   * Okayama: Okayama Castle (zip via Shinkansen) / Kurashiki : Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter\n   * Tomonoura: stroll along the townscape during the day (zip via Shinkansen, transfer to local bus)\n* Return to Onomichi (no later than 1400), board the etSETOra sightseeing train at 1437, and zip to Hiroshima. Enjoy the sunset along the coastline.\n* Retire for the night at Hiroshima proper, probably near JR Hiroshima OR the bus terminal. If time permits, take a gander along the streets and see what takes me from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 10: Hiroshima (Downtown Hiroshima) \\[Tuesday, 21 Nov\\]\n\nSpend the day surveying Hiroshima proper.\n\n* Peace Memorial Park (\u5e73\u548c\u8a18\u5ff5\u516c\u5712) and Atomic Bomb Dome\n* Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims (\u56fd\u7acb\u5e83\u5cf6\u539f\u7206\u6b7b\u6ca1\u8005\u8ffd\u60bc\u5e73\u548c\u7948\u5ff5\u9928)\n* Hiroshima Castle\n* Orizuru Tower (\u304a\u308a\u3065\u308b\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc)\n* Shukkeien (\u7e2e\u666f\u5712)\n* Optional: Mazda Museum / Kure (if not done the previous day)\n* Try to source for Hiroshima-specific food: Okonomiyaki, Dandan Noodles\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 11: Hiroshima (with a day trip to Yamaguchi) \\[Wednesday, 22 Nov\\]\n\n* Daytrip to Yamaguchi \\[Shin-Iwakuni\\] to visit Kintaikyo Bridge via Shinkansen. Also stop by the nearby Iwakuni Castle.\n* Try Tonosama Sushi at Iwakuni if possible.\n* Take the local train back to Miyajimaguchi and take the boat to Itsukushima.Take the time to stroll around the island and perhaps watch the sunset at the torii gate.\n* Exit back to Hiroshima via boat to Hiroshima Port direct, and transit back to hotel.\n\n\\--------\n\n**Shimane + Tottori (4 days)**\n\nSpecific thoughts while planning:\n\n1. Matsue becomes the main jump point for Shimane just because of the subsidized highway bus from Hiroshima, and ease of access towards Tottori later. There's no direct train between Hiroshima and Izumo/Matsue (!).\n2. Tottori is really wide size-wise, to the point that it feels more efficient to have two separate hotels in two nights (Kurayoshi/Misasa Onsen + downtown Tottori) rather than one hotel for two nights (i.e. downtown Tottori). Could be just me making excuses to get into an onsen ryokan however.\n3. Is there anything interesting at Yonago (Tottori) that I should take note of? Based on my initial survey nothing in particular pops up (other than the Tottori Prefectural Flower Park).\n4. Skipping Tottori Castle since it doesn\u2019t seem to be interesting at first glance. Any other interesting things to at Tottori downtown (or nearby)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 12: Hiroshima --&gt; Shimane (Matsue) \\[Thursday, 23 Nov\\]\n\n* Make good use of the 500yen highway bus from Hiroshima to Matsue. (3.5 hours transit). Fortunately the frequency is not too bad (7-8 buses per day, looking at 0800 departure or later); if there are still outstanding places to visit in Hiroshima I will visit them in the morning.\n* Check in at a hotel near JR Matsue, and proceed to trawl around Matsue with whatever daylight is left. **(TBC: am considering taking a few stops down to Tamatsukuri Onsen \u7389\u9020\u6e29\u6cc9 or Matsue-shinjoko Onsen instead of the typical hotel. Does anyone have any positive experiences there?)**\n* Attempt to spend the afternoon at the Adachi Museum of Art. Local train to Yasugi, transfer to free shuttle.\n* Chill off in downtown Matsue for the night. Prowl for Shimane-specific food such as Naniwa Zushi (\u6d6a\u82b1\u5bff\u53f8), Shijimi clams (\u3057\u3058\u307f), Izumo soba, Izumo Zenzai (\u51fa\u96f2\u305c\u3093\u3056\u3044).\n* Bonus: visit the Tottori Prefectural Flower Park for the winter Hanakairo Flower Illumination at Yonago at night \\[which is just beside Matsue. Free shuttle bus at Yonago bus terminal\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 13: Shimane (Izumo / Matsue) \\[Friday, 24 Nov\\]\n\n* Day trip from Matsue to Izumo. (JR Matsue --&gt; JR Izumo, swap to Ichibata local rail to Izumotaisha-mae)\n* Take a stop at Izumo Taisha, as well as the nearby Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo (\u5cf6\u6839\u770c\u7acb\u53e4\u4ee3\u51fa\u96f2\u6b74\u53f2\u535a\u7269\u9928)\n* After lunch, return to JR Matsue and proceed to Yushien Garden (\u7531\u5fd7\u5712) via bus. Enjoy the sunset over the garden.\n* Stop by Matsue Castle on the way back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 14: Shimane (Matsue) --&gt; Tottori (Kurayoshi) \\[Saturday, 25 Nov\\]\n\n* Transfer from Matsue to Kurayoshi in the morning via Super Matsukaze Limited Express (\\~1h).\n* Settle down luggage at Misasa Onsen, then proceed to hike up Mitokusan Sanbutsuji Temple (\u4e09\u4ecf\u5bfa). Cater extra time just in case I have to wait for another fellow to pop up to climb in pairs. Estimated climb time excluding wait is about 2-3 hours both ways?\n* Excess time to be spent sauntering Misasa Onsen and its nearby area such as the Nijisseiki Pear Museum  \\[\u4e8c\u5341\u4e16\u7d00\u68a8\u8a18\u5ff5\u9928\uff08\u306a\u3057\u3063\u3053\u9928)\\] and Kurayoshi Historical Quarter.\n* Retire at Misasa Onsen for the night. Bonus: watch the constellations at night at Misasa Onsen on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday, 2100JST. Current plan does not fall within those 3 weekdays\n* Bonus: take a short detour to Conan Town (postnote: not a big fan of the show).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 15: Tottori (Kurayoshi --&gt; Tottori) \\[Sunday, 26 Nov\\]\n\n* Transfer from Kurayoshi to Tottori (\\~35minutes transfer) in the morning, and proceed to tour around Tottori.\n* Drop luggage, take a local bus to Tottori Sand Dunes, and visit the nearby Sand Museum.\n* Transfer northwards to Uradome Coast via local bus and spend the remainder of the day there. Watch the sunset over the coast.\n* Return to downtown Tottori, stroll around and call it a night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------\n\n**Hyogo, Kyoto, Osaka , Nara, Mie (10 days)**\n\nSpecific thoughts while planning:\n\n1. Kinosaki Onsen is intentionally designed to be a slow-paced leg to recover \\[and also to make time to enjoy the onsens\\].\n2. The limited express train between Kinosaki Onsen and Osaka stops by Himeji thus I thought of resting a night there instead of doing day trips via Osaka.\n3. Osaka itinerary does look sparse but that is in large part because I have already visited most of them in the past. Nevertheless, I would like to experience how different it is in autumn compared to summer \\[based on those few destinations that I loved going previously\\].\n4. I have kept one float day to decompress, OR shift to any of the other prefectures (TBC).\n5. There are (multiple) special limited express train by Kintetsu; they're not covered by JR pass but nevertheless I would love to ride on those as an experience. The Kintetsu pass covers the basic fare only but based on my preliminary cost estimate, it is still worth getting it.\n6. Is it feasible to compress Himeji and Kobe to a single day?\n7. The itineraries for Osaka, Kyoto, Nara and Mie are flexible since they're literally beside one another - makes it particularly easy to shift around base on ground situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 16: Tottori (Tottori) --&gt; Hyogo (Kinosaki Onsen) \\[Monday, 27 Nov\\]\n\n* Settle any outstanding sightseeing spots in the morning if required in Tottori, then transfer to Kinosaki Onsen via the Sanin Line.\n* Make a pitstop at Amarube ('Sky Station') and marvel at the engineering work.\n* Deposit luggage at the ryokan (or put in the coin locker), and stroll around and enjoy Kinosaki Onsen \\[after all its an onsen town\\].\n* Try to hit as many of the 7 external onsens that are usable. Retire for the night here.\n* Optional: go up the ropeway and oversee Kinosaki Onsen in the evening (last ride up \\~1630)\n* Optional: take a short hike up to Onsenji Temple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 17: Hyogo (Kinosaki Onsen + Northern Kyoto (Amanohashidate) day trip) \\[Tuesday, 28 Nov\\]\n\n* Optional: take a (very) early start to the day to Takeda Castle Ruins and witness the 'floating castle' effect in the morning (&lt;0800).\n* Day trip to Amanohashidate via Toyooka--&gt;Kyotango Railway.

Would very much like to try skiing for fun, but am uncertain if the snow condition would be satisfactory by then. Some of the skiing website indicates that these two destinations are usually the first to open. I would like to seek advise on this if possible \\[never skiied before\\].**\n2. **As an additional question to point 1, is 2 days adequate just to get a flavor on skiing?**\n3. Kanazawa is a pretty solid jump point to Shirakawago/Takayama via express buses (\\~1 to 2 hour one way).\n4. My initial planning considered going to Kurobe Gorge (Toyama) but apparently the railways are closed from December onwards. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\n5. Another sightseeing train in Kanazawa that I can fit in nicely in my current plans (\u82b1\u5ac1\u306e\u308c\u3093), runs on Mon/Fri/Sat/Sun.\n\nDay 26: Osaka --&gt; Ishikawa (Kanazawa (Kanazawa cityside)) \\[Thursday, 7 Dec\\]\n\n* Zip from Osaka to Kanazawa via Limited Express Thunderbird in the early morning (\\~3hours; ideally the 0740 or 0810 service).

Suzuki Museum OR \n   * National Crafts Museum OR \n   * 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art\n* Optional: Head southwards to Myoryuji Temple + Nishi Chaya District.\n* Optional: Head northwards to Higashi Chaya District (if not done for lunch).\n\nAny outstanding spots not completed today, to be rolled over to the next 2 days (if possible).  \n\n\n* Retire in Kanazawa for the night. Be on the lookout for Kanazawa-specific food: Gold-leaf ice cream, oden, hanton rice\n* Optional: have a stay at Yuwaku Onsen for at least one night for anime-related reasons. (*Hanasaku Iroha*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 27: Ishikawa (Kanazawa cityside) / Gifu (Shirakawago, Takayama) \\[Friday, 8 Dec\\]\n\n* Day trip to Shiwakawago and Takayama via *Nohi* bus (non-JR, \\~1h).

Specific interest to target: anime/vtuber stuff, music (piano in particular), bookstores etc.\n2. This is the point in time I should go ham on souvenier purchase if I have not done so. I'll probably get an extra cardboard box or duffel bag to lug with me to the airport to store extra stuff.\n3. Would like to seek recommendation on where I should set my base for the 5\\~6 days here. For now I am planning to pit at Ginza, subject to availability and cost. My thought is that as long as its along the Yamanote line everything rolls I suppose.\n4. Hard pass on Golden Gai on the Shunjuku leg (I do not drink).\n5. There's way too many to list in terms of what I would like to do in Tokyo, but I have listed items that are of particular interest to me first within the available time frame. If you have strong opinions on specific locations do let me know.  \n\n\nDay 30: Ishikawa (Kanazawa) --&gt; Tokyo (Ginza) \\[Monday, 11 Dec\\]\n\n* Zip from Kanazawa to Tokyo via the Hoririku Shinkansen in the morning (just north of two hours). (TBC : If I can optimize my schedule better, I can try squeezing two days here for a stop at Nozawa Onsen / Shiga Kogen (Nagano) for a short ski experience).\n* Deposit luggage at one of the Ginza hotels (TBC: subject to cost; might swap for another location later on)\n* Explore ('south') Tokyo with the remainder of the day.\n* Marvel at the architecture that is the Tokyo Station and its surrounding.\n* Visit the Imperial Palace.\n* Head south towards the Mori Art Museum (closes 2200) \n* End the night with a stop at Tokyo Tower (closes 2230).  \n\n\nDay 31: Tokyo (Shibuya, Shinjuku and Nakano) \\[Tuesday, 12 Dec\\]\n\nExplore ('west') Tokyo, namely Shibuya, Shinjuku and Nakano.\n\n* Start off with an early day visit to Meji Shrine / Yoyogi Park.\n* Head up to Shinjuku. Spend the remainder of the morning and lunch exploring Kabukicho, Hanazono Shrine and Omoide Yokoch\u014d (ideally have lunch here). Also make a pit stop at Kinokuniya's flagship store at Shinjuku.\n* Head northwards to Nakano Broadway and trawl for anime goods for several hours (closes \\~1900)\n* Head south down back to Shibuya and experience the crossing in peak night condition. Walk around and soak in the atmosphere. Optional: stop by the Ishibashi music store at Shibuya (closes 2000).\n* Cap off the night and look at the night view at Shibuya Sky (closes 2230). Zip back to the hotel at Ginza.  \n\n\nDay 32: Tokyo (Akibahara, Asakusa and Sky Tree) \\[Wednesday, 13 Dec\\]\n\n* Kick off the day with a morning visit to Asakusa (i.e. Sensoji).\n* Transit over to Tokyo Skytree to watch the Tokyo cityscape in the day.\n* Trawl around Akibahara for the afternoon. (Animate, Sega claw machines, etc). \n* Also stop by Ochanomizu for sightseeing (*Suzume no Tojimari*)\n* Zip back to the hotel for the night. If time permits, stop by the two flagship music stores along Ginza: Yamaha Ginza and Yamano Ginza. Also, visit Itoya Ginza (stationary store).  \n\n\nDay 33: Tokyo (Kamakura day trip OR Ikebukuro) \\[Thursday, 14 Dec\\]\n\nEITHER take a day trip Kamakura, OR explore northern Tokyo (Ikebukuro)  \n\n\nKamakura leg:\n\n* Make a detour to Used Tyre Market Sagamihara Store to experience the retro vending machines. Then head southwards to Enoshima.\n* Look at the giant Buddha statue and stroll along Hasedera.\n* Take the Enoden to Enoshiima and explore the island.\n* Take the JR back to Ginza and retire for the night.\n\nTokyo (Ikebukuro leg): \n\n* Visit Otome Road for otaku related stuffs.\n* Trawl the usual suspects such as Bic Camera etc.\n* Make a stop at the Mejiro Gardens.\n* Visit the Waseda International House of Literature (*The Haruki Murakami Library*) at Waseda University.  \n\n\nDay 34: Tokyo (wildcard) \\[Friday, 15 Dec\\]\n\nSpare day to do whatever I feel like doing OR reallocate this to another prefecture. *Intentionally left blank for later planning*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 35: Tokyo --&gt; Home \\[Saturday, 16 Dec\\]\n\n* Contemplate life at the hotel, doing whatever I feel like for the morning and early afternoon. Bonus: have an early breakfast at Tsukiji Market in the morning if staying at Ginza.\n* Clear any last minute administrative matter (if any), or do (very) last minute sightseeing/buying. Most likely limited to Ginza and Akibahara.\n* Get a nice lunch omakase to cap it off if possible. (taking recommendations if anyone has one, ideally meat/beef centric instead of just sushi).\n* Head off to Narita from Tokyo Station via NEX just after lunch at 1430 --&gt; 1530 to Narita, flight at 1830.\n\n**END**\n\n\\---------------------\n\nIf you're still reading up to this point, here's my own personal ramblings/thoughts on JR pass usage:\n\nI have thought of two ways of doing this for the first 21 days:\t\t\t\n\na. easy-mode : just get 21 days JR global pass before the price hike at 60450 yen, OR\t\t\t\t  \nb. hard-mode: get a 7 day JR global pass (to cover the NEX fees, the basic fee on the Sunrise Seto to Shikoku, as well as limited express trains within Shikoku) (29650) + 5 days for JR Okayama Hiroshima Yamaguchi Area Pass (15000) + 4 days for JR Sanin Okayama Area Pass + 5 days for JR Kansai Wide Area Pass (10000) for a total of 59230.\t\t\t\t  \n\n\nThe initial conclusion was to go with option A since that reduces the administrative burden, but I realized the individual passes do have its own perk which truimphs over the global JR pass. For instance, the Sanin Okayama Area Pass provides a (minor) discount for the Adachi Museum of Art; the Kansai Wide Pass covers the Kyotango route between Kinosaki Onsen and Amanohashidate which the global JR pass does not cover, JR Okayama Hiroshima Yamaguchi Area Pass covers JR buses within Hiroshima for free, therefore I am inclined to go with the hell option (option B) as it stands.\t\t\t\t  \n  \nFor the remaining 14 days, I could also get the global 14 day JR pass at 47250 yen but it is not worth it at all, because I will be relying largely on Kintetsu for the Osaka/Kyoto/Nara/Mie leg which the JR pass most certainly does not cover.\t\n\n* For the Osaka/Nara/Mie/Kyoto leg, I intend to make good use of a mix of both local metro and the Kintetsu rail pass for 5 days (4900). If I do exploit Kintetsu's limited express train to its fullest, I should be able to save money by buying the pass. The Osaka Amazing Pass at 2600yen a day does not make financial sense for me this time round, given how little I am exploring within Osaka.\t\t\t\t\n* For the Osaka --&gt; Kanazawa, Shirakawago and Takayama leg, the preferred pass of choice is the Takayama-Hokuriku Area Tourist Pass over the global JR pass, in large part because this pass fully absorbs the Nohi highway bus fees (which can rack up quite a lot at \\~8000yen for a return trip between Kanazawa and Shirakawago/Takayama). Also this absorbs the Thunderbird fee. One major issue with my current plan is that it does not cover Wakura Onsen nor the sightseeing train.\t\t\t\t\n* For the final Kanazawa --&gt; Tokyo leg, the preferred choice is the Horuriku Arch Pass that covers the direct Shinkansen back to Tokyo, and the NEX fees to Narita when I depart from Tokyo. Will only break even with the pass at best unless I make a stop at Nagano.\t\t\t\t\n\nSo all in all, there's quite little incentive to get the global JR pass after I worked out my schedule, apart from the initial 7 days for the Sunrise Seto jump which the All Shikoku Pass will not cover.\t\t\t\t  \n  \nThrough the hodge-podge of multiple area passes, it works out to around 102890 yen for the whole trip of 35 days, contrast with 107700 yen for a 21 + 14 global JR pass. While there's a minor cost saving doing the hard way which sweetens the deal, the additional minor perks associated with the area passes sells it for me, as I would had to pay more out of pocket to cover non-JR pass buses/rails and such which would add up to much greater cost than I would had anticipated.\t\t\t\t  \nAlso, if I did this trip post-price hike in October, the calculus becomes a no-brainer: avoid the global JR pass like the plague.\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n\\-----\n\nThank you very much for your opinions, suggestions and advice in advance!",

            "comment": "Yay finally an itinerary where I, a Shikoku resident, can offer some guidance! I can only comment on the Shikoku leg and Shimanami kaido but here are my thoughts: \n\nFor Day 1 in Takamatsu - it will be REALLY hard to do the castle, an island, and Ritsurin in one day and do each thing justice. The islands are a day trip in itself so I recommend going to Naoshima or Teshima first thing in the AM. Definitely rent a bicycle while you\u2019re there! Then back to Tak and do Ritsurin if you still have time. If you\u2019re lucky, Ritsurin may be open late for their autumn leaves light up festival. In that case they\u2019re open until 8 or 9pm. The castle ruins are neat but can be skipped. Or see the castle ruins on the morning of Day 2. They\u2019re right next to the Kotoden station so it\u2019s convenient before heading to Kotohira. \n\nFor Day 3 - again, it will be super difficult to do all of these things. Scarecrow village is insanely interesting and you\u2019ll want to take your time there walking around the village and imagining a town that once was. If I were you, I\u2019d do Mt Tsurugi and scarecrow village as top priorities, and then a vine bridge if you can. This area of Shikoku is beautiful, so you\u2019ll want to take your time! Also recommend the bowl of curry udon from the tiny restaurant at the top of Tsurugi. \n\nDay 4 - I personally liked Hirome market for lunch better than dinner. Dinner time it gets a little rowdy. Kochi people LOVE to drink and you\u2019ll be wandering around looking for a chair to sit while younger people hog up the benches and drink for hours. Still a fun atmosphere though and I enjoyed walking around it at night, but we had to go somewhere else to eat since it was so full. \n\nDay 7 - I vote you do 2 days for Shimanami Kaido! It\u2019s such a beautiful journey and there\u2019s so much to enjoy. I took the ferry to rabbit island from Omishima and it was wonderful! And they sell bags of rabbit food next to the ticket window for 200 yen or something.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for bringing attention to the autumn illumination/light-up period for Ritsuin Garden. While I can't find the time period this year yet (its probably still early), I will keep that in mind when finalizing my plans. Also, I will keep in mind the time needed to explore Naoshima/Teshima in full. Might consider spending an extra day in Kagawa to do Shodoshima (which is also another nearby island of interest for me on my wait list).\n\nRegarding the Iya Valley visit, yeah it is going to be a rush to hit all of the attractions within a single day from Mount Tsurugi and downwards. I'll prioritize the inner attractions first on my third day, and leave the outer attractions e.g. Iya-no-Kazurabashi either on my second or fourth day when I enter or leave Oboke. Also, I'll keep the curry udon at the mountaintop in mind! \\[there isn't much eateries within inner Iya from what I can see anyway lol\\].\n\nFor the Hirome Market visit, understood, I will go for it during lunch after the Kochi Castle visit to avoid the crowd, thank you. I'll consider passing by the market again at night, just to soak in the atmosphere and get a feel of how the locals do before heading back to the hotel.\n\nGood to know that they sell rabbit food via Omishima, that gives me a solid option to visit Okunoshima this way instead of going through Tadano-umi which I presume majority of the other tourists would go through. \n\nThank you again for the detailed suggestions, I sincerely appreciate it! I feel that I should add in a few more days to do Shikoku better in my final planning. (e.g. Niyodo in Kochi and Uwajima/Yawatahama in Ehime).",

            "comment": "I'd be sad for you if you spent 35 days in Japan and couldn't manage to schedule in a festival, doubly so if you miss it by just a day.\n\nThe Ryoma festival (\u9f8d\u99ac\u307e\u3064\u308a) is in Kochi (Shikoku) near the start of your trip when you're already planning to be in Shikoku. I believe it starts on Nov 12 (the Sunday before his real birthday on Nov 15). You can learn more about [Sakamoto Ryoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakamoto_Ry\u014dma) beforehand too... a significant historical figure pushing for modernization immediately before the Meiji Restoration. He's also the main character in the Yakuza series spin-off [Ishin: Like a Dragon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805480/Like_a_Dragon_Ishin/) if you've played it. Anyway, the festival atmosphere in Japan is really fun and if you look deeper into it, there are probably a lot of events you'd like to hit.\n\nThis is the website, but **the information shown is 2022 AFAIK so you will need to watch for the date to be updated and confirmed..** [https://welcome-kochi.jp/event/ryoma/ryoma-matsuri.html](https://welcome-kochi.jp/event/ryoma/ryoma-matsuri.html) . You can make it to Kochi in time for the festival if you land on the 11th in Narita and take the first morning flight out of Haneda to Kochi on the 12th. (See my notes below)\n\nWhile you're in Kochi, the the castle there is one of the few original castles remaining. Thought I'd add since I didn't see it in your list.\n\n\\---\n\nFrom the rest of my Shikoku list, \n\nYou can get into Shikoku a number of interesting ways... my favourite was by ferry from Wakyama (south of the Osaka airport KIX), also have done an overnight bus direct from Tokyo to Kochi (was actually a small town nearby past Kochi). What might make the most sense for you from a time/price perspective is to take the direct flight to Kochi (&lt;$100 USD on your dates) run by ANA and JAL from Tokyo lol. You can also fly to Tokushima and Takamatsu for about the same price, but hopefully you read what I said about the festival in Kochi. Note all these prices are flying out of Haneda, so you will need to transfer from Narita yourself.\n\nI really liked the castle at Uwajima (Shikoku). Uwajima is literally the furthest corner on the train line from anywhere in Shikoku, but you've got this *original* cute-sized Japanese castle on top of a formidable hill.\n\nDogo Onsen charges for all the extras (soap, towel rental, etc.) so you may want to bring it with you. The red light district in Matsuyama is only a block or two NW of Dogo Onsen so watch what hotels you book (or don't).\n\nI screwed up once and ended up taking the train through the agricultural valley (e.g. through Awa) by accident . The journey on the one-car train through rural Japan was unexpectedly fun. \n\n\\---\n\nGeneral comments re JR Pass, etc.:\n\nI wouldn't bother with the pricey Japan-wide JR Pass, especially with the price increase. If you take a flight to Kochi, maximize the usage of overnight busses **and flights** for long-distance travel and use the localized train pass in lieu.",

                    "comment": "Can't believe I would had missed a major local event without knowing it existed (!), thank you. I think it is a mistake on my part to only rely on the English version of the tourism website(s) to identify potential attractions alone; I will trawl the Japanese version as well to sieve out such local festivities when firming up my final itinerary. Assuming that it will happen on 12 Nov this year, I will shake up my itinerary to put Kochi first instead so that I can soak in the atmosphere for that. \\[I only played *Yakuza 2*, but I'll happily go to any festival that *Yakuza* series draws reference from\\].\n\nKochi Castle's on my hit list, alongside the usual suspects nearby (Hirome Market, Harimaya Bridge etc).\n\nI'll keep the consideration for a flight to Kochi as an option if it is confirmed that the matsuri will fall on the 12th. Part of me would still like to try Sunrise Seto for the experience, but knowing the dangers of not securing a ticket on Sunrise Seto, I would consider a flight option to Kochi as a strong fallback option (instead of just taking the regular Shinkansen to Okayama). Noted that most of the domestic flights go through Haneda, which is a minor inconvenience but not a dealbreaker.\n\nAlso, I'll keep in mind southern Ehime (Uwajima/Yawatahama) since I have a few unplanned days in my itinerary. It would also tie in nicely with the sightseeing train *Iyonada Monogatari* which runs on the weekends. Also duly noted on the Dogo Onsen extra frills charge \\[I'll just bring the towels/amenities from the hotel, heh heh\\] and the red light district \\[will skirt away from that\\]. \n\nBy Awa you meant the one at Tokushima \\[\u963f\u6ce2\u5e02\\]? As I would be heading to Kochi via Tadotsu/Awa-Ikeda I probably wont be able to pass through Awa, but I'll keep that in mind when finalizing plans.\n\nYeah I will only get the 7 day nationwide JR before the price hike in end-Sept through my local JTB \\[even if I dont use Sunrise Seto, I can still use it within Shikoku so thats sort of helpful\\].\n\nThanks for the inputs!",

However, there is a limit to the number of seat reservations that can be made on those passes, so you have to manage that carefully (some trains are 100% reserved seating, so on others you will need to use unreserved seats to preserve the reserved seating quota).",

I do admit that when the website mentioned that the tour would start from the Awaji side I was a little apprehensive as I was not sure on the transport requirement, but I realized it was relatively easy to access the starting point, with frequent boat services between Akashi and Iwaya port. Bus timing from Iwaya port is a little spotty with 1 bus per hour, but its so close to the bridge/Awaji Michi-no-eki (\\~1km walk) it is not a major issue. The only issue I see for now is that the tour visit is limited on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday/Monday \\[I will reach Kobe on Thursday\\]. I will plan around it and see if I can make this work. \n\nMy thanks for the information!",

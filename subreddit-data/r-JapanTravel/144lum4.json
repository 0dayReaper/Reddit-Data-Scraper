    "postText": "I'm planning a last minute trip back to Japan! I've been there before and hit up Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe. It's been about six years since then and I'm looking to treat this as a practice run for future solo vacations in other countries. Keep in mind that I have been to a lot of the \"big spots\" in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka so if you don't see them here it means I've probably been to them! I'm also just listing days of the week to keep some privacy so to when I'll be going. It'll either be in late Summer or Fall. **I'm also a giant weeb (hence why I'm staying in Akihabara) but I also love historical sites and hiking! I'm much more active than last time so a big goal is to get in many steps!**\n\n**Thank you for all of your help!**\n\n***Tokyo***\n\n**Wednesday:**\n\nTake time getting from airport in the late afternoon\n\nCheck into hotel in Akihabara\n\nWalk around vibe / rest up, no serious plans\n\n**Thursday:**\n\nTsukiji Outer Market - For when I'm dead and jetlagged\n\nKirby Cafe - not registered yet, already know what to do to get my registration and have everything I need to slam in a registration when it opens in seconds.

Attractions such as the brand new Miyashita Park in Shibuya, Tokyo Kabukicho Tower, Shibuya Sky, TeamLabs probably were not there 6 years ago. Warner Bros Studio Tokyo recently opened too!.That on top off one time event throughout the city like the various festivities, pop up cafe...\n\nThese big cities aren't one of those: been there done that scenario. \n\nI think it is worth checking Time Out, Live Japan articles, Trip report from this subreddit to get the edge in your itinerary planning.",

    "postText": "Hi, I (27F) will be traveling with my mom and aunt (both 60F) for 6 days from Sunday (5/28) to Friday (6/3). My mom and I have been to Japan twice but the last time we visited was back in 2016 so our memory is a bit foggy. This is also the first time planning a trip so would love some insights. One thing I would like to note is that my mom has some mild foot problems but is pretty aware and prepared to walk. She is slow but she'll get there. My main question is: **is this itinerary too much on my older-aged mom with foot problems?**\n\nWith the exception of Day 0, I plan to start each day at roughly around 10:30/11AM and end my day by around 9PM.\n\n**Day 0 (Sunday) \\[Takayama\\]:**\n\n* Arrive at Kansai Airport in the morning at 9AM, pick up wifi/Hokuriku-Takayama tourist pass\n* Travel from Kansai Airport to Takayama\n   * take the Haruka line to Shin-Osaka then use the Hokuriku pass to get us to Takayama, looks like a 6 hr trip?\n* Check into hotel and crash for the night\n\n**Day 1 (Monday) \\[Takayama\\]:**\n\n* Take Nohi bus to Shirakawa-go\n   * this was a place that my mom and I visited back in Dec 2016 that we both loved, albeit it's no longer snowing in May/June but we still wanted to visit\n* Explore Shirakawa-go/Ogimachi\n* Go back and explore/eat dinner in Takayama\n\n**Day 2 (Tuesday) \\[Kyoto\\]:**\n\n* Leave Takayama and go to Kyoto, using the Hokuriku pass; get there by afternoon and check into hotel\n* Explore a bit near hotel area and eat dinner\n\n**Day 3 (Wednesday) \\[Kyoto\\]:**\n\n* Either go to Fushimi Inari or Kiyomizu-dera or both?\n   * I'm also open to other suggestions. Neither my mom nor I feel that strongly about these places since the last time we've visited both but are mostly considering this for my aunt who has never seen either before.\n* Explore and eat dinner in Gion\n   * I would like to visit Shirakawa and hopefully a teahouse and grab some dinner around that area\n\n**Day 4 (Thursday) \\[Osaka\\]:**\n\n* Leave Kyoto and go to Namba/Osaka then check into hotel\n* Explore and eat lunch at Kuromon Market\n* Explore and eat dinner in the Dotonbori area\n\n**Day 5 (Friday) \\[Osaka\\]:**\n\n* Shop at Takashimaya in Namba\n* For late afternoon/evening, explore and eat dinner in the Shinsaibashisuji/Amerikamura area or go back to Dotonbori again\n   * I would also reaaaalllly like to go the mipig cafe Osaka as well.\n   * Also open to any teppanyaki suggestions but not totally required.\n\n**Day 6 (Saturday) \\[Tokyo\\]:**\n\n* Fly first transfer from Osaka (KIX) to arrive in Tokyo (HND) at 3:30PM\n* My final flight back home at HND is at 12:30AM, which leaves me roughly 6-7 hours to explore Tokyo\n* My main priority is to eat omakase for dinner at Kyubey Ginza or some other nice restaurant (open to recs!) and maybe visit Shibuya Sky.\n\n**Some other questions I had:**\n\n* I got the Hokuriku-Takayama pass, instead of the JR pass and was planning on getting around locally with a Suica card and the occasional limited express ticket. Is this doable?\n* Is it possible to visit Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizu-dera, and Gion in one day?\n* How hot and humid does Japan get in May/June? Does it get cold at night?\n\nThanks in advance for reading!",

            "comment": "Your itinerary is unrealistic and you'll be rushing everywhere.  Do they love sitting on buses for multiple hours a day?\n\nYou can do Fushimi inari and kiyomizudera in one day if you start at 7 am.  Budget at least 3 hours at each location  if they're fast walkers.  Both involve inclines and after 10am, be prepared to move through crowds that will slow you down.  \n\nKuramon market is fun to grab a snack but if you're going after 10 am, it's packed with tourists.  Better to get food outside of the market in Nipponbashi or near namba station.  You can probably combine shinsaibashi with dotonburi unless you're heavy shoppers.\n\nFor your flight, your check in counter might not open until 3 hours before if you have to recheck.  If you already checked in, then you got a better shot.  Security lines took me 2 hours to get through but then again not sure if that was due to it being the Saturday before golden week.\n\nGood luck.  If I was you I would just stick to two cities.",

I ended up revising my Day 1 so we would make a stop in Kanazawa instead, my mom was pretty adamant that she would be fine with long transit rides so hopefully it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem. Based on what others say too, I think we\u2019ll do either Fushimi Inari or Kiyomizudera but not both.",

            "comment": "Do be aware, that the Hidas between Toyama and Takayama (while covered by your pass) do not run frequently.  There are 4 per day.  There are 4 locals per day that are not always well timed, and when those are done, they are done.\n\nI agree with the previous poster about doing day 0 in Kanazawa and then going by bus to Shirakawa Go from Kanazawa and then continuing onwards to Takayama.  You could also just go straight to Takayama from Kanazawa on day 1 and on day 2 go back via the Shirakawa Go stop off.\n\nHonestly, unless you have gotten a very good deal on an airfare I would just pay out of pocket for the shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo.  They're a lot more frequent than even flights and you can take the Nozomi which run several times an hour.\n\nIt is hot and humid in late May and early June and none of the places you are going cool off at night.  I've gone to all of them in mid-late June and while it is a month later, it has been getting warmer earlier and staying warm longer relatively consistently.\n\nTakayama was very hot when I was there.\n\nIt is possible to do Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizudera and Gion in one day but you will be exhausted if you want to do the full loop at Fushimi Inari and you will want to get there more like 8 am vs. 11 am.\n\nAgain, it gets quite hot and humid.",

Hmm, given my mom\u2019s condition with walking and hearing what others said about visiting Fushimi Inari or Kiyomizudera, most likely I think we\u2019ll stick with one to try taking it a little easy.\n\nThanks for the tip about the weather, will pack accordingly!",

            "comment": "Consider ending day 0 at Kanazawa.  The Nohi bus your currently planning to use to get to and back from Takayama on day 1 runs from Kanazawa to Takayama and allows you to break the journey and explore.  You could crash earlier and have pretty much the same time in Takayama on day 1 as Shirakawago is close to having the  same travel time for Kanazawa - Shirakawago - Takayama as Takayama - Shirakawago - Takayama.  The Shirakawago bus station has lockers and an overflow building for your luggage.",

Full bus on arrival so did not even try to hunt down empty lockers and went straight to the overflow building as someone had given me a tip to do.\n\nI have a friend who went at another time with husband and 3 children and associated suitcases and carry ons and were able to find lockers for all.\n\nWorse comes to worse there are always people leaving Shirakawago so I imagine locker turnover is high.  The people boarding your bus will have emptied their locker before doing so.",

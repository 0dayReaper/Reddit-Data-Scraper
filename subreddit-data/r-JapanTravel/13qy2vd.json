    "postText": "Okay so for anyone who has a uterus who is considering traveling to Japan and may start their cycle, this is for you. \n\nI did not expect to start mine at all and what do you know a week into a two week trip and  I start spotting \ud83d\ude43 I am a person who can have a very heavy flow (I have a copper IUD) so I typically have to use Super + tampons for one to two days of my cycle. \n\nI found out (again didn\u2019t do my research bc I didn\u2019t think I would be starting my cycle while on my trip) that tampons are not\u2026 really\u2026 a thing\u2026 JAPAN HAS THEM! But it\u2019s a tiny little section at the bottom of the shelf and I did not see any options for Super + \ud83d\ude2c\n\nSo here I am, two days later, cleaning some stained laundry. \n\nPoint is, I would recommend if you like to use tampons (and you have a preference on the kind you use) that you bring a few extra absorbent in your luggage just in case. Just a PSA for someone who didn\u2019t prepare! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nUPDATE: the day after I made this post, I found \u201cSuper +\u201d tampons at Life, a supermarket in the Fukushima district of Osaka and \n\nREVIEW: they were really not very absorbent, especially for someone with a heavy flow I bled through in about three hours \ud83d\ude2c I continued to change every three hours after that and it was okay.. for reference, a typical Super + tampon in the US lasts me at least five hours and I rarely bleed through, and when I do it\u2019s not nearly as much blood. \n\nAlso, so happy this post blew up! I had no idea how much other people needed this info!\n\nSummary: if you have a super heavy flow and like US absorbency levels, bring some! It seems like menstrual cups work great for a ton of people and I\u2019m also hearing that period underwear is sold at Uniqlo and they work pretty well. It seems like Diva cups are hard to come by in Japan stores and some said pads aren\u2019t as absorbent as they would like. \n\nLastly, doesn\u2019t hurt to have some spares for your fellow travelers and apparently meat tenderizers work for getting period stains out! Stay safe + dry out there y\u2019all \ud83e\udee1",

A lot of them also have a seat for a child and some even a needle bin.. for insulin needles I assume. \n\nI personally decided to skip my period when I was in Japan. Didn't want to go through the stress and hassle. This however might not be an option for you. \n\nPro tip: train stations, malls and multistory stores have public toilets too. Might need to go through a maze to find them but they're there somewhere.\nAlso bring your own toiletries.",

The breakthrough point is different for everyone but most people I know skip for only about three months, although I do know one girl who does four.\n\nI do 2-3 months \"skipping\" (depending on my schedule) and then have an off month where I take the placebo and allow a bleed.\n\nThe pill is actually more effective if you have less frequent placebo breaks - reduces the risk if you accidentally miss a day elsewhere in the month.",

It's safe to do so, the only reason they've historically recommended a break is to make women feel 'normal' by having 'a period'. In fact in terms of birth control it's better to skip the break because it gives you more leeway if you miss a pill and prevents you taking a break that's too long",

From what I can tell there is no hard science for this but the theory behind the reports of less cramps is the menstrual cup puts pressure on the uterine muscles, which prevents them from constricting as forceful or as much.\n\nFor me personally, I experience less cramps with a cup than period underwear. (I no longer use tampons/pads). But the cup has to be the right size for your body. There should be zero discomfort with it in. If there is that means it's too big or incorrectly placed. Also if it leaks it's not fully popped open which could create corners that hurt not help.\n\nThe flip side is, I had a cup that is too big and holy hell does it give me the worst cramps ever. I thought I could use it on very heavy flow days and be good for like all day+ but the pain was horrific.",

Either way I was very relieved and now haven't left the hotel without pockets filled with tampons like some kind of menstrual product hoarder expecting to hemorrhage in the streets.",

Due to my birth control being poorly timed for my trip, I had started a few days before leaving. It really helped on the flight when you can\u2019t always control when you can use the bathroom. The basic ones I got off Amazon also are pretty good on their own for the start and end days. If you\u2019re close to your cycle, it\u2019d be a good idea to pack some if you have space.\n\nIf you can wear Japanese sizes, [Uniqlo makes some](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/products/E458854-000/00?colorDisplayCode=72&amp;sizeDisplayCode=005). I imagine there are other companies that make them in Japan as well, but that\u2019s probably the most well-known and accessible brand. Especially if most tourists are around major cities.",

Even Uniqlo [has some](https://www.uniqlo.com/jp/ja/search?q=%E3%82%B5%E3%83%8B%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%84), and there are more [Period](https://period-tokyo.com/pages/store)\\-focused shops opening in larger cities, too. The Period shops also stock Western period underwear for heavy flow. The standard sanitary shorts here are great if you've got a heavy flow and don't trust whatever you've using, or if you have minor incontinence issues. And perfect for those in-between and light days, too! They're not quite period underwear, e.g. for complete free bleeding, but...you could try. There are some that have more capacity than others, you just need to check the signage.",

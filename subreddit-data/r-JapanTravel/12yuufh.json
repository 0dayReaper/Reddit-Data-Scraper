    "postText": "Hi! I would love some opinions on the feasibility of our itinerary. Also would like to precise that we plan on traveling with backpacks and packing light so I'm not too worried at the idea of switching hotels every 2 or 3 days. It also seems from the calculator that the JR pass wouldn't be worth it so I don't think we'll be getting it unless I got that wrong?\n\nDay 01 : Landing in Tokyo Narita, transfer to our hotel (near Ginza station) take a stroll in the area  \n\n\nDay 2 : Tsukiji outer market, stroll around different areas of Tokyo, not sure yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 03 : Train to Hakone, drop off bags at ryokan, explore the area, enjoy the onsen at our ryokan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 04 : Train to Shizuoka, drop off bags at hotel or bag lockers, visite the city\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 05: More activites in Shizuoka (to be planned) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 06 : Shinkansen from Shizuoka to Kyoto, bag drop off at hotel, activities to be planned\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 07 : I was thinking of getting up really early (like 3 or 4am) to visit Fushimi Inari by night with hope of seeing very few people around and experience the place almost empty but also seeing the sun rise and experience the place in daylight on the way back down. \n\nDay 08 : Either more time to visit Kyoto or a day trip to Amanohashidate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 09 : Train from Kyoto to Osaka, drop off bags at hostel. Walk around, visite Hozen-ji Yokocho, Dotonbori...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 10 : Visit Osaka temples, Kuromon Ichiba Market etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 11 :  Day trip to Nara\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 12 : Train from Osaka to Kii-Tanabe.

Walk the Kumano trail from Takijiri to Takahara \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 13 :  Walk from Takahara to Tsugizakura-oji. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 14 : Walk from  Tsugizakura-oji to Kumano Hongu Taisha. Sleep in Yunomine Onsen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 15 : Bus to Ukegawa, and from there walk to Koguchi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 16 : Walk from Koguchi to Kumano Nachi Taisha then bus to Katsuura. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 17 : Train from Katsuura to Shirahama. Stroll around, visit the Sandanbeki Cave\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 18 : Enjoy the beach, visit Shirahama\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 19 : Train from Shirahama to Osaka. Enjoy the city some more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 20 : Fly from Osaka to Naha, Okinawa, transfer to hotel and drop off bags, stroll around the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 would be spent exploring Okinawa and scuba diving, getting our PADI certification.\n\nHas anyone been diving in Okinawa and which were your favorite spots ? We don't plan on renting cars while being there, would it be a huge problem to enjoy the area ? What if we rented bicycles ? Is it easy to get around ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 26 : Fly from Naha to Tokyo, transfer to hotel. Enjoy the city some more\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 27 : Train from Tokyo to Nagano.

So I do recommend having them, alternatively pick up a good long hiking stick somewhere (sometimes people leave them behind at trailheads",

    "postText": "My fiance and I are getting married in Hakodate next week (we leave tomorrow!) and spending the rest of the trip on our honeymoon.  We love arcades, anime, all kinds of Japanese food, and unique experiences.  Please let us know if we missed anything important or if you have any other feedback to offer.  Also we are looking for creative ways to give our feet a break (bikes, rickshaws, etc.) so let us know if you have any recommendations for that!  EX: We wanted to book a rickshaw for bamboo grove but it's sold out online, what are our chances of finding one when we arrive?

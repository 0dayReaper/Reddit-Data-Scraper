Maybe check out Yamap, Hokkaido Wilds, or something like those to be sure of difficulty and timing for your routes.",

It's totally no joke. If you're advanced hiker I think it can be done in a day from Asahidake to Sounkyo if you start in the morning from Asahidake onsen. I started from Asahikawa but only got to Asahidake summit and going down again to Asahidake onsen.",

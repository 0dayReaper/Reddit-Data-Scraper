    "postText": "Hi guys and girls,\n\nI\u2019ll be heading to Japan with two friends in september. We\u2019ll be arriving in Japan on the 5th of september, and we\u2019ll be flying out on the 29th. This gives us a total of 24 days to spend in the land of the Rising Sun. Whilst we\u2019ve got our initeraty pretty much set out, I\u2019m still keen to hear if you\u2019ve got any tips or things we\u2019re missing along the way.\n\n-\t**About us**: Three Dutch guys, 6\u20195\u201d. Two of us have travelled intercontinentally before, 1 hasn\u2019t. We just want to go out and about and enjoy whatever Japan throws at us. Whilst there are certains things we will have to make reservations for (TeamLabs, certain restaurants, USJ/Disney) we want to keep our schedule at the locations as clutter-free as possible. Go with the flow and if we don\u2019t feel like doing something, that\u2019s just as cool.\t\n-\t**Mode of transportation**: We will be doing everything by train, using a JR Pass in Green Class\n-\t**Our holiday motto: The word *No* does not exist (as long as it\u2019s not excuberantly priced)\n-\t**Goals**: Just enjoy and get a first impression of Japan. Not just the culture in the cities, but also when out and about in nature.\n\n---\nOk, down to our itinerary:\n\n-\t**Tokyo** - 5 nights \u2013 Split in two hotels, 1 in Shibuya and 1 in Shinjuku. Basically we want to accomodate a bit in Shibuya, see heaps of stuff in Tokyo (Like TeamLabs, a baseball game, Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, Ueno Park, Owl Cafe Akiba and all the standard stuff). Oh, and a former housemate of mine is from Tokyo and wants to take us out 1 night.\n-\t**Sapporo** - 3 nights. You can\u2019t go to Sapporo withouth visiting the brewery. On the second day we\u2019re doing a daytrip to Shirogane Blue Pond to wind down a bit.\n-\t**Osaka** - 4 nights. Obviously we\u2019re contemplating visiting Universal Studio\u2019s, but we\u2019re all 6\u20195\u201d so we are afraid we won\u2019t fit properly in any ride. Besides USJ we\u2019ll go to Osaka Castle, Hozenji Yakamazu, Dotonbori, Kuromon. We\u2019ll be in Osaka during the Kishiwada Danjiri Matsuri Festival we\u2019ll be going here for sure. Might also put in a daytrip to Kobe or Nara.\n-\t**Hiroshima** - 1 night. The obvious. Go to the atomic bomb dome and the peace memorial park\n-\t**Iya Valley** - 3 nights. This is a place where we\u2019ll be staying in a Ryokan and just want to relax for three days. Go for walks, enjoy nature, enjoy Onsens and recharge for what is about to come.\n-\t**Nagoya** - 3 nights. Or should I say Formula 1. We\u2019ll be visiting the Grand Prix of Japan at Suzuka, and have booked our hotel in Nagoya.\n-\t**Kyoto** - 3 nights. Here we\u2019ve booked a Machiya. No stress, just enjoy the nature surrounding Kyoto, enjoy the culinary highlighs Kyoto has to offer (Did anybody say pizza from Yoshihiro Imai?)\n-\t**Tokyo** - 2 nights. These final days will be Do Or Die. We\u2019ve got a hotel in Akihabara and want to go out with a bang.\n\nWe\u2019ll be traveling on a budget of 100\u20ac per person per day, excluding travelling and F1-tickets. Fortunately we can split hotelrooms, so that should drive down our cost of accomodations a bit.\n\nSo, what do you people think of this trip? Are there any downsides in what we\u2019ve got planned out right now? We can think of one, which is travel-related\n-\tThe train ride from Tokyo to Sapporo, and Sapporo to Osaka is a loooong one. But it\u2019ll give us a view of the and cities across the island, something we won\u2019t experience when we\u2019re flying out.",

Shinkansen trips aren't great for scenery since it goes by in a blur, and even if you liked it one way, you're seeing it twice. Sightseeing trains around Shikoku or visiting the mountains or valley north of Nagoya would make more sense for a nature experience.  If you can't move that segment around, check out the Sendai thread that's on the front page. There's northern scenery and alcohol (Matsushima, Yamadera, Nikka Miyagikyo distillery) and it's way closer.  \n\nOther than that, all sounds nice!",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nYes, the train ride from Tokyo to Sapporo and Sapporo to Osaka is incredibly long.  \n\nI would write down your itinerary as days, because I think you are going to discover you might be in Sapporo for 2 nights but you only have 1 day to sightsee in Sapporo if you are coming by train.  I would do this for each location so you know how much time you really have someplace. \n\nI would personally fly.  The view from the air of Japan in good weather is really lovely and you get to see a lot of things you might not otherwise.  You will be seeing Kyoto back to Tokyo via train as is.  I don't find any of the scenery from the shinkansen particularly amazing outside of Mt. Fuji when it is visible.  The only shinkansens I don't have a lot of experience with is the Niigata branch and any of the ones in Kyushu.  \n\nIf you're only going to Nagoya to go to the Grand Prix, I would switch out the hotel with somewhere closer to Suzuka's Grand Prix.  If the hotel on site is too expensive, look for a something near Yokkaichi.  You're going to be traveling an hour plus each way, for each of those days, plus I am pretty sure you will be paying a supplement each way because you spend some time not on JR tracks.\n\nI'd re-examine whether a rail pass is worth it.\n\nGetting from Hiroshima to Okayama and transferring there for a train to Oboke near Iya is not so bad, but be aware that the buses from Oboke and within Iya run at very infrequent intervals, with 7 buses a day the most frequent.  Make sure you know how to get to wherever you are staying.\n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7826.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7826.html)\n\nGood luck!",

Why ask for advice when you are so quick to dismiss it?\n\nYour itinerary is very inefficiently organized. You do understand the Shinkansen doesn't run all the way to Sapporo, right? You have looked up how long the train takes from Tokyo to Sapporo, right?",

Anything with \\* you might be able to get something else done other than transit, but you need to spend time researching  transport (namely buses WHICH WILL NOT BE COVERED BY A JR PASS!  Not everything is covered by a pass, it doesn't completely erase all other transportation costs.)\n\nYou are right you have two full days in Sapporo, but you lose a complete day in Osaka and I would personally feel like crap after spending 12+ hours on a train (cause unless you are staying near Shin-Osaka or Osaka Station, you still need to get to your hotel.  I've noticed a lot of people stay near Namba or Shinsaibashi.  The former is much faster to reach by non covered subway vs. JR and the latter is only reachable by non-covered subway.)  even in the green car.  They're comfy but you are still sitting for hours, with your only breaks being layovers and train transfers.  Sitting on a plane 12 hours to get to Japan is enough sitting for hours for me!\n\nYou honestly might want to do Hiroshima as a day trip from Osaka.  I believe there are more trains a day between Shin-Osaka and Okayama than Hiroshima and Okayama if using a rail pass, and with a JR West Pass there are an equal number of trains, but why change hotels for 1 night.\n\nPersonally, if it was me, and I wanted to do the itinerary as is because there is something specific on a specific date in Suzuka which I needed to be there for, I would do:\n\nTokyo to Sapporo (fly)\n\nSapporo to Itami (fly)\n\nGet a JR West Kansai Hiroshima Pass [https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/kansai\\_hiroshima/](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/kansai_hiroshima/)\n\nIt will let you take a Nozomi to Hiroshima and to Okayama and will at least some of the trip to Shikoku\n\nDo Hiroshima as a day trip from Osaka\n\nI'd stay near Suzuka, if that is the purpose of your trip and take the Kintetsu line from  Osaka to that area.\n\nI'd take Kintetsu back to Kyoto with a transfer at Yamato-Yagi.  (I believe there is no transfer from Osaka)\n\nI'd then just pay out of pocket for a Nozomi from Kyoto to Tokyo.\n\nThough honestly, if there is no reason you need to be in Nagoya then, I would do Iya to Kyoto and then go from Kyoto to Nagoya and then Nagoya to Tokyo, rather than backtracking.\n\nA pass saves you money over individual tickets, it does not necessarily save you money if you are comparing  it to the changes I made to the itinerary by flying, getting a JR West Pass and then just paying out of pocket or using Kintetsu.  You are comparing apples to oranges.\n\nThere is also the issue of your time and what that is worth to you.  \n\nSince you are not going during a Japanese holiday time, getting airfares should not be eminently doable.",

While I feel like some days may be pretty empty, I worry that other days are too packed. \n\nWhile we're interested in doing everything on this list, I'd say the most important would be: Minoh park, Mount Fuji, DisneySEA, the ramen museum, staying in a Ryokan, and seeing the Thousand Gates.",

My only suggestion is that on day 3, you\u2019re criss crossing the city from Harajuku to get to the Studio Ghibli museum and then criss crossing back to Shinjuku. It would make more sense to do the Ghibli museum first as Harajuku and Shinjuku are closer to each other.",

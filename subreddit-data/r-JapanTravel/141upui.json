    "postText": "Hello,\n\nWe are planning a first time trip for myself and my brother this July and we\u2019d love some feedback on the planned itinerary. We are hoping to see Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Hiroshima, as well as make some day trips to Nikko, Hakone, Nara, Himeji and Kobe. We tried to keep some days more relaxed and allow for some free time to recharge after very intense days. We would have loved to spend a bit more time in Kyoto, so if you have any suggestions of trips that I can condense/remove from the plan so we could allow for some more free time in Kyoto to explore the local coffee scene would be great.\n\nBased on the plan we have so far and how much travel we want to do, we are thinking of getting the 14 day JR Pass, but would it be worth getting the 7 day pass and skipping some of the trips or potentially getting a local travel pass?\n\n**Day 1 Tokyo**\n* Arrival midday\n* Pick up JR Pass\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Shibuya Sky\n* Explore Shibuya\n\n**Day 2 Tokyo**\n* Meiji Jingu\n* Yoyogi Park\n* Lunch in Shinjuku &amp; shopping\n* Exploring Harajuku\n\n**Day 3 Tokyo**\n* Asakusa\n* Senso-ji Temple\n* Imperial Palace\n* Ueno Park\n\n**Day 4 Tokyo -&gt; Nikko -&gt; Tokyo**\n* Day trip to Nikko\n* Shinkyo Bridge\n* Toshogu Shrine\n* Taiyuin\n* Return to Tokyo for dinner\n\n**Day 5 Tokyo -&gt; Hakone**\n* Leave Tokyo for Hakone\n* Hakone Circuit\n* Evening in a Ryokan, relax in an Onsen\n\n**Day 6 Hakone -&gt; Kyoto**\n* Head to Kyoto via Tokyo\n* Nishiki Market\n* Pontocho\n* Gion\n* Tea ceremony (?)\n\n**Day 7 Kyoto**\n* Fushimi Inari\n* Nijo Castle\n* Eikan-do Zenrin-ji\n* Kinkaku-ji\n* Kiyomizu-dera\n\n**Day 8 Kyoto -&gt; Nara -&gt; Kyoto**\n* Half day trip to Nara\n* Todaiji Temple\n* Nara Park\n* Return to Kyoto\n* Relax, walk around Gion\n\n**Day 9 Kyoto -&gt; Osaka**\n* Leave Kyoto after breakfast\n* Osaka Castle\n* Dotonbori\n\n**Day 10 Osaka -&gt; Himeji -&gt; Osaka**\n* Day trip to Himeji, leave early morning\n* Engyoji Shrine\n* Himeji Castle\n* Kokoen Zen Garden\n* Return to Osaka for dinner\n\n**Day 11 Osaka -&gt; Kobe -&gt; Osaka**\n* Day trip to Kobe, eat lunch and explore\n* Return to Osaka\n* Umeda Sky Building\n* Return to Osaka for Dinner\n\n**Day 12 Osaka -&gt; Hiroshima**\n* Leave Osaka after breakfast\n* Atomic Bomb Dome\n* Peace Memorial and Park\n* Dinner and free time\n\n**Day 13 Hiroshima -&gt; Miyajima -&gt; Hiroshima**\n* Ferry to Miyajima\n* Itsukushima Shrine\n* Ropeway\n* Return to Hiroshima for dinner\n\n**Day 14 Hiroshima -&gt; Tokyo**\n* Return to Tokyo\n* TeamLabs Tokyo \n* Explore Roppongi\n\n**Day 15 Tokyo**\n* Yayoi Kusama Museum\n* Free time, souvenir shopping\n* Departure in the evening\n\n\nAny feedback on this is much appreciated!",

Not sure what day of the week your trip begins, but expect heavy crowds in Shibuya/Shinjuku from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon.\nDay 9, I would skip reconstructed Osaka Castle and move your Nara day trip to here which would give you more time in Kyoto. You can store your luggage in a coin locker or pack a day\u2019s change of clothes and use a luggage forwarding service for the rest.\nDay 14, if you start at Zojo-ji Temple it is possible to walk past Tokyo Tower to Roppongi. No reason to go up since you are doing Shibuya Sky but there is decent shopping/dining at its base.",

I think it makes sense to have a Nara trip on the way to Osaka, but I worry about not having enough time to explore Osaka itself since all other days in Osaka involve day trips. Although maybe it would make sense to combine Miyajima and Hiroshima on the same day and have an extra day in Osaka.\nThat\u2019s a great tip about Tokyo Tower, it would fit quite nicely looking at the map! Thanks a lot for the suggestions!",

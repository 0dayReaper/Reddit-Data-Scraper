I\u2019ve been to Tokyo twice and am the only one in the group who has been before and love planning vacations so I agreed to plan it out.\n\nNow my sisters husband is a country boy, but wants to visit Tokyo due to his love of anime and other Japanese cultural aspects. He requested we spend some time in \u201cthe country\u201d but I\u2019m aware that things like English are limited outside of major areas and my Japanese is elementary. I\u2019m thinking Hakone or Kawaguchiko could fill this requirement but I\u2019m wondering if one is better than the other! Onsens we\u2019re requested but I know both places have them. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Does he mean genuine countryside (= rural areas) or just \"cities which are not Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo\"?\n\nYou really do not need Japanese for normal touristing even in lesser traveled areas. Small talk is not a thing in Japan, customer service is very good, in the vast majority of cases it is very obvious what you want to do without a single word being spoken (check in to a hotel, showing up at a ticket counter, pointing at menu items) and with Google Maps/Navitime + Google Translate + body language you can do anything.",

Out in the countryside it's much more hit and miss.\n\nI remember going to a rice planting festival in the middle of nowhere on the east side of Lake Biwa and kind of struggling to find the train station after the festival was over, and then standing around baffled because the (non-JR) station was unattended. The one car train was just sort of sitting there with the doors open, nobody inside. Nobody living within line of sight. \n\nWe sat there for about half an hour wondering if we should try to find a taxi and how when a door opened and the conductor came out. We sorted out our tickets and a few stops later we were back in JR territory and on our way. \n\nNot scary at all, but it did feel a bit post apocalyptic. \n\n&gt;I\u2019m thinking Hakone or Kawaguchiko could fill this requirement but I\u2019m wondering if one is better than the other!

It's not scenic and fancy, but it is very real countryside Japan. Late March is the off-season in those parts, between winter ski season around Nagano and summer. We scored some amazing deals and had baths and ryokan amenities basically to ourselves. Sakura season varies thanks to climate change so as long as you're hitting Tokyo you'll probably have that covered, but do look into areas listed as Kinki - Gifu, Nagano/Matsumoto, and other regions on either side of the Japan Alps for the smaller towns and countryside areas that are still lovely without being wall to wall tourists like Kansai. If your fam is into samurai or ninja stuff, or special farming practices that give tours or experiences, that's worth looking into as well.\n\nFor getting around you can get a lot of good use out of Google translate, our wait staff at Tamaya Ryokan loooooooved being able to speak into my partner's phone and have it auto-translated. We were able to get around most of Japan with our limited Japanese, pointing, and apologizing like true midwesterners, but the translate features on the phone (especially the camera pointed at signs and menus) made everything so fast and smooth. Faster than me carefully puzzling out katakana, that's for sure.",

It takes a little bit of care to read the comments and make sure the listing is reliable and that the location is accessible to you, but it could be a fun one-off.\n\nI stayed in 2 airbnbs that might qualify as \u201cin the country\u201d, including a great experience with one involving a train to Toyama, 20 more minutes on a regional line, and then a 20 minute walk to a really nice guesthouse/private cabin with great views of the mountains and cherry blossoms. The older couple running it invited me to a home cooked dinner (for a fee, listed in the airbnb description) and even with the language barrier, the enthusiasm + google translate made it a really good time. My other stay in Matsushima was more \u201cno-frills\u201d older building that was an adequate basecamp for a day trip to Tashirojima, hosts didn\u2019t interact but left a local guidebook, I had 2 meals local and otherwise ate on my outings.\n\nI also stayed 1 night in Hakone via a hotel app, but that experience definitely leaned towards a resort onsen stay than in the country. Really nice resort, but the bit of Hakone I walked around  particularly more country than many other moderate sized towns with parks and nature nearby.\n\nI named specific cities but researching other areas those seem like common archetypes across Japan. In any case the language barrier shouldn\u2019t be a huge issue, there\u2019s usually somewhere with photo menus and/or helpful staff, and at worst case there\u2019s always cooking or convenience store food",

            "comment": "Still ryokan-territory but Shuzen-ji on the Izu penninsula is kind of countryside. It's one of the major wasabi-growing regions and the train out there goes single-track to give it that rural feel. A larger room at Kikuya ([http://www.kikuyaryokan.net/en/](http://www.kikuyaryokan.net/en/)) was great for 2 couples (there are multiple private baths that are first-come-first-served as opposed to reserved).",

            "comment": "I found learning the basics helped immensely - hello, goodbye, thank you, excuse me and sorry are the phrases I used the most, you really can get by with that and pointing, translation apps make it very easy to communicate with shop keepers what you want as well. That and understand the culture, little things like being quiet on the trains, handing over cash with two hands instead of one. It all makes a huge difference.\n\nI found it as a thing of respect to learn the basics, it definitely made a difference in my interaction with some of the locals I did speak to, they were a lot more lively and such. I even had a bunch of teenagers teach me their version of a drinking game, then we sung their friend happy birthday in English, it was super cute. It all started because I shouted kanpai(cheers) to them as I walked past them in a circle near the train station.",

It was an amazing tour. I only wish that it was longer. It was definitely the highlight of the trip and only cost $91 per person.",

Given the JR Pass will be increasing by 64% it's probably not worth going too far but there are plenty of places in Japan that are quite beautiful in the country side. I used to live in Northern Japan and the sakura blooms later in the year like end of April to early May.",

            "comment": "Some options:\n\nKumano Kodo hike - easy and suitable for that season. Really rural and authentic. Not as dramatic as hiking in Nagano, but peaks in Nagano will still have snow in sakura season.\n\nNakasendo trail - same as above, a bit less nature and more history and easier access \n\nShikoku - you could do a piece of Henro route or just drive around. Inland there are some really remote places, south of the island is beautiful and mostly rural. I love Shimanto river. Just that public transport is not great, so for better exploration you would need a car. Shimanami Kaido area is majestic, people usually cycle there, but you can drive or take public transport.\n\nKyushu - many volconoes (Aso is insane), lots of onsens and nature. Car would make it way easier to travel around, but there are good trains on the coasts. Some very nice cities like Nagasaki, Kagoshima, Beppu.",

    "postText": "We spent 8 days on Shikoku as part of a month long itinerary, mid-April.  Sharing my take since it\u2019s one of the areas that doesn\u2019t get much coverage here.  \n\nWe began in Imabari, where we completed the Shimanami Kaido and picked up our rental car.\n\nFrom Imabari, we checked out the castle and then drove to Matsuyama.  Matsuyama was enjoyable- good food, the castle was nice- good shopping.  Ride the chair lift up to the castle- so fun!  We didn\u2019t go to Dogo Onsen or the area immediately around it, so I\u2019m sure we missed something interesting.  The town itself doesn\u2019t have much architectural character- much was rebuilt following WW2 bombings.  We\u2019ve always got to hit up good craft beer spots and enjoyed Bokke.\n\nFrom Matsuyama, we headed toward Uwajima and stopped in Uchiko and Ozu on the way, but found them both a bit boring.\n\nUwajima- probably our favorite thing was going to Doi Pearl and learning about pearl cultivation.  You should email in advance for a reservation.  The owner\u2019s English was really good and he did an excellent job explaining and demonstrating steps of the process.  We got to harvest a pearl as part of the experience (and choose a simple setting for it) and you can shop in their store afterward, though I didn\u2019t find their pricing compelling.  About 3,000 yen each for the experience.\n\nChecked into our hotel and started walking around to find that the sidewalks of the town roll up by 5PM.  We were on a pearl hunt and had hoped that better pricing might be found at the source.  Ultimately that wasn\u2019t the case and I was glad I had found a great set for my daughter in Matsuyama.  If you go to Uwajima should should definitely go to the roadside station- good food vendors (and a conveyor belt sushi place behind it).  Also Matsumoto Pearl has a location here that didn\u2019t show up in google but was the best selection and pricing we found in town on pearls.  If you follow google to Matsumoto Pearl it will take you to the farm on the water where they do have some products but it\u2019s definitely not set up as a mainstream retail shop\u2026seemed like their home, with half retail set up downstairs.  Oops.\n\nAnyway, some restaurants were open, but even the next day we were surprised how few stores were open in the middle of the day.  We walked up to the Uwajima Castle and checked out the sex museum before leaving.  Sex museum was interesting- huge collection of everything you could imagine.  They didn\u2019t allow phone use so we weren\u2019t able to use google translate to read descriptions of some of the exhibits.\n\nIf we weren\u2019t interested in the pearls- Uwajima would have disappointed badly.\n\nFrom Uwajima, drove to Kochi.  I don\u2019t know what to say about Kochi but we were so bored and disappointed.  There was great food, but we didn\u2019t realize until we got there just how far away all of the \u201cattractions\u201d noted for Kochi were from downtown.  The beach was a 30+ min drive.  Transit options weren\u2019t any better.  Very little was reasonably walkable outside the downtown core.  Our rental car was stowed in one of those towers 2 blocks from our hotel, so it wasn\u2019t feasible to take it in and out for excursions.  There were some interesting sake and beer breweries within 45 mins or so but we didn\u2019t want to drink and drive.  There was minimal tourist infrastructure- could be a real opportunity in the future to have someone do sake brewery tours etc.  In addition the weather was gray or rainy while we were there which didn\u2019t add to the appeal.  We also weren\u2019t there on a Sunday for the Sunday market.  So, in hindsight I wish we had skipped Kochi.\n\nNext we were on to Iya Valley.  We stopped for white water rafting at Happy Raft and it was a great experience, such a beautiful river!  We stayed two nights at Iya Valley Onsen, I think our biggest splurge of the trip.  It was in a beautiful spot and the food was amazing.  We drove around one afternoon to see some of the sights around Iya Valley- scarecrow town, vine bridges, etc.  I will say that driving around there is pretty wild- lots of one lane windy roads and you have to watch mirrors placed at curves to see if another car is approaching and then figure out who will stop in a wider place to let the other pass.  The river valleys are stunningly beautiful and there are nice views around every curve.\n\nFinally, we drove to Takamatsu.  The Ritsui Garden was great though we caught it when not a lot was in bloom.  We enjoyed their covered market and had really good Udon.\n\nFrom there we caught the ferry to Naoshima.\n\nRental car was a Toyota Aqua (hybrid).  I don\u2019t think we reserved a hybrid, just a regular car but this is what they gave us. We drove 535 km- over 300 miles- and used less than a half tank of gas, 3300 yen to refill.  Very impressed with the car\u2019s fuel efficiency!",

            "comment": "Re: Kochi\n\nI feel the need to defend it because I've been there twice and enjoyed it both times.\n\nFirst, Kochi is far off the beaten path so of course its tourism infrastructure isn't as good. It is a city but it's still considered \"inaka\" by Japanese standards because it's relatively isolated and small-ish. In these areas of Japan, patience is key. You're not going to get anywhere fast and that's just how it is, so unfortunately, you have to consider that in your planning.\n\nHowever, the last time I was there, they had something called the \"MY-YU Bus\", which was a tourist-oriented bus loop that would have taken you to all of the major tourist sites in the city. Was this not running anymore?\n\nKochi has one of only 12 original castles in Japan. On Mt. Godai, it has a lovely botanical garden next to Chikurinji Temple, one of the temples of the Shikoku Pilgrimage. It has tons of history related to Sakamoto Ryoma, one of the most famous samurai in Japan. Their specialty food is katsuo no tataki and bread hats. One of my favourite things to do in Kochi was to go to Hirome Market and eat katsuo no tataki cafeteria-style next to other Japanese people who are there to relax, drink some beer, and have fun. If I had had the time, I would have liked to explore the nearby Ryugado Caves.\n\nKochi is also the place where I've always encountered friendly people, so I have great memories there. I remember visiting Chikurinji Temple and juuuust missed the bus to take me back into town. It was something like another 30 minutes before the next bus. It was warm and there was an ice cream stand nearby, so I went and bought some ice cream. The lady chatted me up a bit (as best as possible given the language barrier) and then gave me a little charm for free. I *could* have gotten upset about missing the bus, but it ended up being a lovely experience with an ice cream vendor.\n\nI think it has a lot to offer. You just have to do your research and have some patience.",

                    "comment": "Yes, food was good and Hirome market was enjoyable.  We also went to the castle, but that was like 30 mins.  That bus did run but just like a car, the time required to get to anything was long.  Want to go check out the beach on a gray day- that'll be 3-4 hours roundtrip.  Even the botanic garden and temple was also 30-40 mins by bus.  If there was a loop route that would have been more efficient, it wasn't obvious to me as I was looking up each location separately.  I just had not done the math on the distances when planning Kochi.  Was thinking it's a small town and the key attractions noted didn't look far on the map, but I was unprepared for each of those to basically not be walkable and require a half day on their own.  I don't think it's a bad place, but for this, our first trip to Japan, I would have much rather used those days in a place where I could get more from it in a 2 night stay.  The people were definitely friendly!",

For Japanese, aside from bonito, Kochi is famous for rivers like Shimanto. If you were coming from the West side, then actually you must have drive near by. But I\u2019m not sure if that was worth it if you booked hotel in the city on the day - there\u2019s just so much driving involved. There are a few other rivers I enjoy in the West side, but they don\u2019t have tourist accommodation in those area. My grandparents live around there so I drive there once in a while, but I can\u2019t help but noticing how many hours were spent driving and how much more I could\u2019ve done in many other prefectures. I guess it\u2019s just the way it is haha I\u2019m just happy that you visited there at all, and I hope you\u2019d enjoy the rest of the trip!",

I went there almost exactly a year ago as part of a mini Shikoku/Okayama trip (I was living in Osaka at the time) and I actually did not have a car and didn\u2019t try visiting anything outside the city itself. I spent about three days there and absolutely loved it. Basically I was just eating Katsuo and other local specialties, drinking sake, and chatting with the locals and loved every minute of it. I also liked the castle there though it\u2019s certainly not the best in Japan. I\u2019m not trying to say you\u2019re wrong or that your experience isn\u2019t accurate just wanted to share my own different experience. For me it was a great little way off the beaten path charming city.",

Got the ETC card (let\u2019s you drive on toll roads without having to manually pay at the toll booths). You pay tolls when you return your car to the rental office.\n\nDriving is strange at first but you get used to it (I\u2019m from America).  Didn\u2019t really encounter many aggressive drivers or anything like that. You end up on small roads sometimes but the cars are also smaller here. Just have to drive with a little more caution here and there. Highways are easy, google maps is your friend.\n\nOverall, driving in Japan (I\u2019ve done suburbs and rural) is not that bad. Not sure I\u2019d want to drive in Tokyo quite yet!",

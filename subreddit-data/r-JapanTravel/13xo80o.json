    "postText": "I wish I found this subreddit sooner so I could expand my research prior visiting Japan. I only found this subreddit after I returned from the trip so after reflecting upon the trip I will write my mistakes that I made and things that I have learned so I can perhaps help other first time travellers going to Japan. It will be also useful for me in the future. PS: forgive my grammar, English is not my first language. Also a late report + numerous trip fumbles ahead so please be kind xDD\n\nMe (30M) and my gf (25F) went on a trip to Japan April 24 - May 11, 2023. This was our first time travelling to Japan and our first time travelling in a different country by ourselves in general. We both had no experience travelling without family/experienced travellers with us so it was a bit stressful but we still had fun in general.\n\n**What we learned:**\n\n* Get a very good shoes for extensive walking/hiking. I cannot stress this enough. Man, I returned with bunch of callouses on my toes+heels and blisters on my pinky toes that turned into some sort of stage 2 pressure sore. It was not fun walking with pain that I feel bad for unable to keep up with my gf. I had to sit many times to give first aid and end up buying some products for my feet. Was still able to complete all itineraries but it could have been prevented. No more Sketchers for me.\n* 1 month prior to flight, my vegetarian gf attempted to become omnivore for the trip. She was sick for a couple of weeks for eating meat but she braved through it because she did not want to miss out on food while in Japan. She adapted in the end although she had nauseous from eating meat at times. In the end, there were actually numerous vegetarian options for her that she did not have to adapt in the first place.\n* We needed more time to prepare for the trip. Our trip was kind of spontaneous and we booked the flight ticket around late March so we have to pay hefty amount of money more. The itinerary was too much than we could have accounted for. We should have given ourselves free time in between destinations and not clump them like there is no tomorrow.\n* Check the weather forecast. Preparing for the itinerary while considering the weather can be very difficult as the weather in Japan fluctuates very easily. Good thing we group our itineraries that can be done indoors vs outdoors so would switch up the plan depending on the weather. I also did not know cherry blossom forecast was a thing. I visited places expecting some cherry blossoms and they turned out to be green when we get there. This is a good thing to consider while visiting during spring season.\n* Be flexible for the trip. Our trip was supposed to be Osaka -&gt; Kyoto -&gt; Nagoya -&gt; Kawaguchiko -&gt; Tokyo. Then we switched up Tokyo and Kawaguchiko due to price increasing during the Golden Week. We visited within the Golden week period (we did not know this event was a thing) and we realized the price of hotels skyrocket within this period. I wanted to experience some high end ryokans in Kawaguchiko with a view of Mount Fuji but then the price was like 3-4 times the price during the Golden week, hence, we switched up the places. We saved money for lodging because of that.\n* Popular restaurants + Tourist trap places can have long lines. If you have tighter schedule like we did, I highly suggest making reservations or come earlier to get into the lines. Even a lot of restaurants that open at 11am, I saw a line already around 9:30am. I did not have time for that that we end up visiting not so pupular places and yet still experience delicious food. Tourist trap places tend to be overrated and expensive. It is a good thing that we went to try other places. Our restaurant policy if there are more locals eating vs tourists eating, it is good and most likely cheap. Some restaurants also do not appear on google maps due to not adapting to the English language so you can usually find hidden gems here and there.\n* I think it is better to check in a hotel with breakfast services as most restaurants open around 11am. We had hotel with breakfast service and some have dont. We end up buying food at combini and also got lucky with Denny's near our first hotel as it opens at 6am.\n* Note for type of train traveling within your station. I only realized this during the middle of our trip. There is Local, Rapid, Express. Local stops station to station, rapid seemed to skip some stations, and express seemed to only stop at key stations. It is good that the stations have English translations and even the train pre recorded voice also had English parts.\n* Check exchange rate before withdrawing money from ATMs. The currency exchange fluctuates but it is not a huge difference. It is still good to win as much money in the exchange to have more cash in hand. The money I lost due to the exchange were minuscule at first but they accumulate since I did not check exchange rate until I returned.\n* I should not have been afraid to ask for help. I had this impression that Japanese people don't like to be bothered and they seemed resourceful themselves to not bother themselves asking. At least I learned this the second day of the trip. Hotel receptionists are good resource to ask.\n\n**What saved us the trip:**\n\n* Being an anime fan/hololive fan helped me with the language. I watched so many animes that it surprisingly helped improve my vocabulary and I was able to understand people speaking in Japanese. Although I cannot read their language(thank god google image translate), I was able to hold conversation even though I speak like a toddler/kindergartener. It is almost funny that some anime characters speak unnatural that I even used their kind of speech at times. I am ever so proud when some people told me \"Nihonggo Jouzu\"-d 4 times during this trip. Some people take that as an offense but I was so delighted when I received that.\n* Booking online for reservation. We avoided spending more for this trip since we did not go to theme parks and focused on temple visiting as we preferred. We only had few reservations to do without much competition.\n* Renting wifi device. I was about to use roaming but it was too expensive for a 17 day trip. Thank goodness for renting. Things would have been a disaster without my internet. Everyone should get their internet access as their priority.\n* Get a power bank device. Since I use my phone all the time, the device dies easily. There are charging stations around but if you want to keep moving, bring your own and charge them while you walk. I had my 20000mah power bank and it is more than enough for charging 2 phones, 1 tablet, 1 wifi device for the day. I just charge the power bank while I sleep.\n* Getting a Suica pass. This is self explanatory. I almost got into the hype of getting a JR pass too but I thought it was too expensive for me. I did not need a JR pass. With the help of google maps and Suica pass, I was able to go to my destination. I am amazed they put the price of the transport that I was able to choose which method of transport should I be getting. No taxis for me in this trip since I heard they tend to be expensive.\n* Buying unlimited day pass also saved us some money for transport during the trip. It is a good practise to calculate your itinerary beforehand before deciding whether an unlimited day pass is a good option. There were days we did not buy unlimited pass. \n* Putting Akihabara near end of trip than early. I would have ran out of money to spend for other places if I went there first.\n\n**Brief trip report:**\n\n* Day 0 (April 25) - Arrive to Osaka after Layover from Narita around 8pm. Checked in the hotel and ate combini food before turning in for the night.\n* Day 1 - Osaka Castle (entered with an entrance fee) -&gt; Izakaya Toyo (watched the episode on netflix and decided to visit) -&gt; Sumiyoshi Taisha -&gt; Nagai Park (it was at this part I realized about the Golden Week as we saw construction of stalls as preparation) -&gt; Team Labs Botanical. The botanical experience was underwhelming for me. I was only impressed with the blue lights on the foliage.\n* Day 2 - Yoshino. This is the part where I wished I knew about the Cherry blossom forecast. I checked google to see where in Japan has best place for cherry blossom and it recommended Yoshino. The cherry blossom was already over but the place was still very nice and visited some temples there. I will definitely come back for the actual cherry blossom viewing. At least the Blue Symphony train was a cool method of transport to Yoshino. Then spent the rest of the day/evening at Tsutenkaku.\n* Day 3 - Shittenoji Temple (they were building stalls for the festival? got few good pictures due to stalls within sights) -&gt; went to Kobe and tried their Kobe beef from a golden cow plate restaurant in Kobe -&gt; cable car to Nunobike Herb Garden -&gt; hang around BE KOBE sign -&gt; Dotonbori for the rest of the evening (VERY CROWDED).\n* Day 4 - Nara. Rented bike there and went to various places. Nara Deer Park -&gt; Sage Ike pond -&gt; Kasuga Taisha shrine. Feeding deers everywhere. -&gt; Todaiji temple (entrance fee) -&gt; Kofukuji temple -&gt; Higashimuku Shopping Street -&gt; returned bike then train back to Osaka-&gt;  going first time trying bath house in Solaniwa.\n* Day 5 - Checked out hotel. Used Kyo Train Garaku to Kyoto. Used a coinlocker since check in starts at 3pm. -&gt; Jonangu Shrine (entrance fee for garden) -&gt; Fushimi Inari Taisha. Attempted to climb up but my poor feet were screaming. We turned back after reaching the second station before Mount Inari. -&gt; Gion for the evening before checking in to the hotel.\n* Day 6 - Arashiyama Bamboo Forest (I was underwhelmed by this place as it was small. Make sure to come early as it gets crowded later on) -&gt; Nearby Temples (Nonomiya, Mikami, Jojakkoji, Nisonin) -&gt; Tenryuji Temple (entrance fee but most impressive garden I have visited this trip) -&gt; Tenryuji Shigetsu to experience their vegan cuisine -&gt; Sagano Romantic Train to Kameoka -&gt; train back to shop around Arashiyama -&gt; Kinkakuji Temple -&gt; Nishiki Market for the rest of evening.\n* Day 7 - Kiyomizu-dera (entrance fee) -&gt; Sannenzaka (they have Starbucks in tatami there, also my gf visited \"My Only Fragrance\" shop and made her own perfume there). -&gt; Yasaka Shrine (there were numerous food stalls everywhere I think this is how they celebrate Golden Week and I ate good) -&gt; Heian Temple (entrance to garden). They also had numerous food stalls and a concert stage and I ate good -&gt; Kodaiji Temple (entrance fee but they had a nice light show there during the evening).\n* Day 8 - Nijo Castle (Expensive entrance fee compared to other entrances. Imo, there are other better places that should be more worth the fee compared to this place). -&gt; Kyoto Imperial Palace (free entrance) -&gt; Rokusonno Shrine -&gt; Higashi Honganji Temple (free entrance. More stall constructions) -&gt; Gion for the rest of evening.\n* Day 9 - Check out Hotel. Used Hinotori express train to Nagoya. Always wanted to try capsule hotel and checked in to 9 hours hotel. -&gt; Visited Nagoya Castle (entrance fee but I was disappointed we could not enter the castle itself compared to Osaka Castle). There were also numerous food stalls inside and I ate good. -&gt; Visited their Malls -&gt; Slept at the capsule hotel. To be honest, I slept really well compared to other hotels we have booked. It was surprisingly comfortable despite the random fire alarm that woke me up during that night.\n* Day 10 - Checked out Hotel. Used Shinkansen to Tokyo. Checked in at the next hotel. -&gt; Teamlab Planets (way better than Teamlab Botanicals) -&gt; Dinner at Gonpachi (Kill Bill reference). The movie was old and it is the theme of the restaurant. Their food was mid though. It is just a nice ambiance where noise seemed to be welcome here.\n* Day 11 - Suga Jinja (Your Name reference). Still surprised there are still visitors there due to that movie. Did some cringe Your Name photos. -&gt; Meiji Jingu -&gt; Explored Harajuku (visited Aoyama flower market tea house) -&gt; Shibuya Crossing (ate good food there). Visited Tower Records + Don Quijote + Miyashita Park. Wanted to do Shibuya Sky but they sold out their tickets. End up getting lost among the crowds for the rest of evening.\n* Day 12 - Nezu Shrine -&gt; Sensoji Temple (It was raining too hard that day so we decided to come back another time. -&gt; Shopping at Asakusa ROX + tried their conveyor belt sushi -&gt; Akihabara (spent quite a lot of money here for anime merch). Anime store hopping + visited maid cafe for the first time.\n* Day 13 - Sensoji Temple (better weather) -&gt; Ate at Happy Pancake (I find it overrated but I still enjoyed their pancakes) -&gt; Visited a big Muji store in Ginza -&gt; Akihabara part 2 (more anime merch).\n* Day 14 - Check out hotel. Left all check in baggages in a coin locker for 3 days prior heading to Kawaguchiko. Used bus from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko station. Took shuttle bus to hotel. Check in at ryokan with a bath house + footbath on their rooftop with nice view of Mt. Fuji. Walked around the lake + view of Mount Fuji. Found myself a waifu Kawaguchiko-san seemed to be the mascot of the town since I see the character on various tourist spots. Had myself a mini scavenger hunt to find all of her cut outs around the town and I found them all!\n* Day 15 - Shopping for souvenirs around. -&gt; Took the boat going around the lake with nice view. Took car cable up to have a better view of Mount Fuji. Walked up more higher to have better vantage point. Proposed to my GF, now I have a fianc\u00e9e.\n* Day 16 - Check out Hotel. Bus back to Shinjuku. One more stop at Akihabara for merch. Retrieved coin locker baggages. Train to Narita Airport then flight back to Canada.\n\nEDIT: post formatting",

            "comment": "I think most of your issues could have been avoided by simply accepting that you can't do everything. Minus Golden Week, I personally would just avoid Japan on Golden Week entirely (or stay in if that's an option).\n\nWhen I was there in December, Nijo Castle still had an inexpensive (like 600 yen) entry option if you didn't want to go inside the building and only wanted to see the gardens. Looks like they've eliminated that option? (EDIT) Nevermind, it's still an option, it's just more than I remembered (800 yen).\n\nFood stalls were still there at Yasaka Jinja a couple weeks ago. We tried one and it was.. terrible. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSurprised you stopped by Mikami Jinja, it's sooo small \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 my friend wanted to go there to pray for more hair. Some of the ema are pretty funny.\n\nRe: international roaming cost, it really depends on your phone plan. My husband's plan was $10/day for unlimited roaming, mine was about $1/day plus $10/GB up to 6 GB for the month (then unlimited after). We both used our roaming for convenience sake. I was also able to buy an eSIM with 6 days of unlimited data on Klook for $18, eliminating the need to mail or pick up anything. (The unlimited data came in handy when our toddler wanted to stream shows to watch on the Shinkansen, the wifi was kinda spotty. \ud83d\ude02) Personally, I think these options are way easier than renting a hotspot, but that's just me.\n\nCongrats on the engagement!",

It is good to have free time in between itineraries to chill/relax and give more time on specific places if needed.\n\nNijo castle was 1300 yen each which includes inside visits. Still too expensive with what was presented though.\n\nI like food so even mid food were still delicious for me xDD yeah we still like to temple hop and pray even though we are Catholics.\n\nYes the roaming pricea depends on the phone provider. I just did not risk it since there was the info about roaming having limited to certain areas and I did not want to have hindrance so I just had my roaming service as back up that I can activate any time. Thankfully, I did not need it! :) Thank you!",

Took a full day holed up with some snacks and my friend's cats to heal up, then slapped a buncha blister plasters on and went on my way. If I had tried to power through it would have been a disaster. Health comes first! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAgree Nijo is kinda underwhelming for the entry fee but it was super close to my hotel and there were oddly nearly no tourists inside so it was a nice time for me when I was traveling solo. My husband opted not to go in on our recent trip. I think I'd go in again for 600 yen (there's a nice cafe and garden inside) but 800 yen is maybe meh. There's a 100 yen discount with a bus or subway pass, but I didn't know that when I went. \ud83d\ude02 But yeah Kyoto has a ton of entry-free attractions so Nijo probably doesn't need to be prioritized for most travelers (probably why it wasn't crowded? There were a lot of Japanese people and locals inside, though.)",

They opened at 1pm and we got there at 12:30pm. There were lines already and they appeared to close certain sections when raining. The line moves pretty fast imo. We lined up under the rain during their operation and when rain cleared up, we got more spaces for more customers. There were no chairs in the venue yet it was still fun sharing tables with other people outdoors. I find the price menu a little expensive but it includes his mini show with his flamethrower cooking. The waitresses also were very nice and speak very good English. My vegetarian gf started to appreciate eel(without skin) from this experience. His popular dish were the Tuna cheeks and runs out pretty quickly that he had to cook more. That is mostly the reason the wait time can be longer since he is still cooking the fish by himself. Overall, the food and experience were great I am glad it was featured on Netflix. He deserved it imo. I wish his space was bigger to accommodate more customers.",

Some people used to think they are X size when their feet actually need something bigger. If your feet hurts after like an hour walking, I suggest to go to store and try something bigger.\n\nAnother key for me is that to have mesh upper shoes material.

From Atre I only got 5 cards for buying stuff in the stores around the shopping center (and asking for the card, one by 500yen purchase).\n\nYou can see that I got a [bunch of things](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/13ll2gl/hololive_merch_haul/), and after that I bought even more, like one more Nene items, two stand, a badge from her 3D debut merch, two clear files and two more mini shikishi, a sticker (at least those are the thing I remember). Also got two more Lawson mini shikishi, Fubuki and Watame.\n\nThen I saw that Holoearth manga is on prebook at Animate and wanted to buy it, so I ordered it via a proxy and thought that I could check some merch to add to my order..... ended up buying for 130$ total (including the manga and the proxy fee), like 10 Nene item/set of items; bromide, postcard, card, coaster, stickers, clear file, stand and even a Nene pro employee ID with a husband number.",

Beautiful river + mountain forest scenery but it looks like its better when theres cherry blossom around. You can do round trip but we did one way and hang around Kameoka for a bit before taking the JR line back to Arashiyama. I think I should have written it in the post for reserving ticket online for the romantic train. At this time, there is only 1 machine to retrieve the ticket and the lines can be long. I barely made it for the scheduled departure. Make sure you remember your pin ticket and ready your credit card to confirm reservation. The lady in front of me wasted time because she does not remember the pin code and was taking time shuffling through her purse for her credit card.",

It is good that the stations have English translations and even the train pre recorded voice also had English parts.\n\nNot sure if it's still the case,  but when I was in Japan several years ago some of the local trains between Nara and Tokyo did not have toilet facilities on board.  The local stopped at stations frequently, but without being able to read or speak Japanese, I wasn't confident that I could make it to the bathroom and back at a stop without the train departing without me (and stranding me in some of the very rural area along the route).  Might be worth automatically upgrading to a rapid or express train....especially if you decide to have a few beers in Nara before departure like I did.",

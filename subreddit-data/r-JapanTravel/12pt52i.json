    "postText": "Hi all. I've got a couple of queries I wanted to clarify on my upcoming trip to Hakone. I will be staying overnight at Hakone Yutowa:\n\n1 - I have already purchased my Romancecar ticket (leaves Shinjuku at 8am on the Sunday). Even if after staying overnight in Hakone, I am travelling on to Kyoto (i.e. not coming back to Tokyo), I should still buy the Round Trip Hakone Free Pass as it includes the fare portion from Shinjuku? I want to leave nothing to chance (hence the intense planning here) as it's going to be a very early start on this day considering I'm coming from Ueno to Shinjuku first!\n\n2 - I'n following an itinerary which I'd guess others on here would've seen a million times before **however I'm trying to also slot in Hakone Open Air Museum, Amazake Tea House and doing a portion of the Old Tokaido trail.** Where would these slot into this schedule (maybe point 3 helps add more to this).\n\n1. Shinjuku to Hakone-Yumoto\n2. Hakone Tozen Railway to Gora\n3. Walk to drop off bags at hotel\n4. Hakone Tozan Cablecar to Sounzan\n5. Hakone Ropeway from Sounzan to Owakudani\n6. Food\n7. Hakone Ropeway from Owakudani to Togendai\n8. Lake Ashi Boat from Togendai - **which stop at this point (Hakone-Machi or Moto-Hakone) for what I have mentioned I want to add?**\n9. Walk to Hakone Shrine\n10. Walk to Hakone Tozan Bus back to Gora\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - The Old Tokaido trail portion I am following the instructions per [the Japan Guide.](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5205.html) After Amazake Tea House, it mentions to walk to Hatajuku and go no further as it is not very scenic afterwards. Is it obvious when this point is?\n\n4 - I am a fairly active traveller and haven't gauged how long the above would realistically take. As I am staying over in Gora, is there any more space in the itinerary to add some more walking/visits? I saw Gora Park and also Onshi Hakone Koen Park looked nice, or potentially more hiking?\n\nSorry for how obvious some of these questions may seem to others  - this is the first day trip of my overall trip to Japan and I want to be relaxed going into it and not stressing on the morning of (which will already be an early one!)\n\nThanks",

We basically couldn't do step 5 through 10 on your list because of this. But the Gora Park was surprising cool to visit. There's a craft house in the park where you can sign up for fun craft classes if the weather is bad.",

            "comment": "1. If you are starting in Ueno it is faster / cheaper to take the local JR train (~1h30min) from Ueno to Odawara and then pick up the Hakone Free Pass (the version starting in Odawara), than going via Shinjuku. The Romancecar is more comfortable seating, but even with the local train you should be able to get a seat at Ueno or Tokyo as most people disembark there in the morning.\n\n2. Moto-Hakone, but see my response to #4\n\n3. The section that is not along the road seems to end at \"\u65e7\u6771\u6d77\u9053\uff08\u7bb1\u6839\u65e7\u8857\u9053\uff09\u6a7f\u6728\u5742\" on Google Maps (name only shows up in kanji on my end).\n\n4. If you are staying at a ryokan you will need to return by 5:30/6pm for dinner. Look up the last bus from Moto-Hakone that you will need to catch to make this deadline, and do a time check around Steps 5 and 8 to rearrange as needed. If you find yourself having more time, get off the boat at Hakone-Machi and walk via the lakeshore back via Onshi-Hakone Park.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for this. Regarding point 1, I was able to reserve a front observation seat on the Romancecar on the recommendation from others online (I've been told it is a very nice trip in itself) however it only leaves from Shinjuku. It would get me to Hakone Yumoto at 09:34. I appreciate the journey from Ueno and changing at Odawara may be cheaper/faster, however this choice was specifically because I wanted to do the Romancecar observation seat and it's the only station option I could find.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy hotel is more of a buffet style for dinner - I have emailed them to confirm what time it is served (incase it is later than a ryokan-style) and will look to find a bus timetable to judge it as you suggested. I read that it might be possible to bus it back from Hatajuku (if you know of this?) therefore:\n\n**Hakone-machi &gt; Onshi-Hakone Park &gt;** Hakone Shrine via Moto-Hakone &gt; Amazake Tea House &gt; Hatajuku &gt; Hakone Tozan Bus to Gora\n\n\\*\\* Bold being the optional parts if time is an issue?\n\nWhich would allow for me to visit the tea house and do some of the trail?\n\nThanks again.",

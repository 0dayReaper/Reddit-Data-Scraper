Kyoto is on the Shinkansen line, but since it is close to Osaka, you wouldn\u2019t be saving that much time by taking the Shinkansen. I don\u2019t know what or where Katsuoji is.\n\nThe main reason I wouldn\u2019t recommend staying in Shin-Osaka is that it is a business district, so there is nothing interesting to do or see in the area. The restaurant options are geared toward businesspeople eating alone on a budget, so the choices are not exceptional. I might recommend Umeda instead. It\u2019s not far from Shin-Osaka and there are a lot more things to do and see if you have time to kill when you\u2019re around your hotel.",

I\u2019ll look around Umeda on Maps, check some routes for day trips in the JapanTravel app and maybe switch to a hotel in the area.

You can always head to Nara after going to Fushimi Inari. \n\n- JR pass - it might be worth getting the 3 week pass. Run your trip through the JR pass calculator, to make sure it is worth it. \n\n- agree with above. Do not stay in shin Osaka as it is too far from most places of interest. \n\n- in addition to JR pass, and IC cards, looks into regional metro passes - Osaka subway pass? Kyoto pass ? Tokyo subway pass for transit. If you plan it out right, and it works with your schedule, you can save some money. \n\nSounds like a fun trip. Hope you have a blast",

I guess since I\u2019m not really planning on spending time in museums, just strolling through the park and nearby temples, that would work? \n\n- As for the passes, definitely! I\u2019ll be getting Tokyo passes for days that are metro heavy and Osaka pass too. As well as the Hakone pass, and maybe the Kamakura pass (forgot the name) or the Enoden pass.\n\n- Indeed the 21 day JR Pass (old price) would be worth it! Hadn\u2019t checked with the recent Toyama addition. \n\nThank you! :)",

The park has a lots of interesting sights inside and nearby and just has a generally really chill atmosphere. You can easily spend a few hours wandering around, visiting temples, museums etc.",

We stayed 5 nights in Kyoto and wished we had stayed longer. Different strokes though? The vibe at sunset near the river was stunning. \n\nOsaka is pretty easy to navigate if you\u2019re on the JR loop. Groovy Jazz Bar near Shinsekai was a highlight. There are lots of vintage shops near Osaka Umeda station, Green Pepe was a highlight, lovely couple operating the shop. Osaka has a laid back vibe compared to Tokyo and Kyoto, wished we\u2019d spent more time there. \n\nTokyo - Golden Gai is a bit pricey but great if you want to connect with fellow foreign travelers. Piss alley or \u2018Memory Lane\u2019 has lots of good little food spots but sometimes hard to get a seat. The National Park and gardens are worth checking out and only 500 yen to enter. We also stayed near Akihabara for the arcades and overall sensory overload cartoon, anime, electronic feast for the eyes. The arcades are worth the trip if you\u2019re interested at all.",

            "comment": "I definitely recommend that you don't skip Himeji Castle. You can skip Osaka Castle (there really isn't much to do there besides look at the castle, while Himeji is a lot more interesting in that it's been fully refurbished/restored fairly recently and is only 1 of 3 still-intact castles in Japan - ie. it is not a recreation of the original).\n\nLeave Osaka early enough in the morning and just spend the morning and lunch at Himeji then make your way to Hiroshima after - you should have enough time for that. I personally usually pop into Himeji for a half day from Osaka. I've already been there 3 times and will be bringing another friend in November this year as well, and I'm still not bored of the castle, haha.\n\nYou might also want to look into getting back into Osaka or Kyoto on the night of Day 10 instead of staying in Hiroshima for the night, so that it's less of a rush to get to Toyama the next day. \n\nMiyajima and Hiroshima can be done as a day trip from Osaka/Kyoto, and looking at how your itinerary is going, you could do Hiroshima Peace Museum on the 2nd half of Day 9 and Miyajima for the first half of Day 10 (like you currently have in your plans) but I'm not sure if there'd be anything else for you to do for the rest of day 10, unless you are keen to check out the Mazda Museum. If you must have dinner at Okonomimura, maybe push that to Day 9 instead.\n\nAlso, assuming they don't change the rules for which trains JR Passes can or cannot use come November, you will likely be catching the Kagayaki from Toyama to Tokyo - just remember to reserve your seat prior to the trip you're planning to take. They're usually easy enough to book - the last time I was there in 2017, I booked a seat for my friend and I ~10 minutes before departure time, and there were plenty of available seats.",

Google maps was harder to navigate with all the transit options. Your JR pass won\u2019t cover subways. \nThe Shinkansen was incredibly easy to figure out. Don\u2019t bother with reserving seats, they all have non-reservable seats on cars 1-5\u2026if you reserve a seat you\u2019ll have to wait in line for a paper seat reserved ticket. Waste of time since you\u2019re traveling alone. Don\u2019t get on the Nozomi line - which I found out you can do by accident. It\u2019s not covered with JR passes. \nOsaka was a little easier to figure out than Tokyo. Luckily I was with a New Yorker who\u2019s keen on train transit.",

However note that it is only possible to buy tickets for Grand Warehouse on the webpage, the other two areas can only be purchased inside Japan (according to the site).\n\nFor the museum, it seems like they are only selling a fraction of the Ghibli Museum tickets to international visitors. We missed the ticket release with one day and it's already sold out. \n\nThere are still plenty of tickets available for June for example, checking the Japanese site, but you would need someone in Japan to buy them (and possibly join you, not sure how strict they are with checking the ID of everyone in the group). We fortunately have friends in Japan that could buy but not join as they have work, so we will see if they will let us in, otherwise it's not a big deal, we'll just figure something else to do.",

But so far, for November dates, I've found APA and Sosetsu Fresa options for $60\\~$70. Always the very tiny bedrooms though (I'm ok with that). I've been using Agoda and Booking.",

            "comment": "Day 5\n\nI would dedicate a whole day to Arashiyama and Higashiyama each. Otherwise it's a bit rushed as it still takes time to travel between them. Especially if you're not staying in Kyoto (which I recommend). In Arashiyama I wouldn't miss Arashiyama Park observation deck, it's surprisingly nice. And I prefer the small temples north from there compared to the big ones. \n\nHigashiyama has plenty of temples, the big ones are impressive, but very busy. In addition to 1-2 major ones I would visit some random temples, sometimes you're on your own there. I love Yasaka shrine at night, same with Gion, which is amazing after dark.\n\nDay 11\n\nIf you will go all the way to Toyama for the exhibition, I would suggest using the time there to see something else - options are Kanazawa, Takayama + Hida. If you like the mountains, Tateyama is one of the most spectacular mountains in Japan with easy access and plenty to see event without climbing it. \n\nIt seems you have enough time to stay somewhere else, you have dedicated lots of time to Tokyo, which gets tiring and repetetive eventually, visiting rural and wild Japan would bring a lot of variety to your trip.\n\nDay 13\n\nKusatsu is great, but it's pretty much only onsens there. So you should check their policy regarding tattoos if you have any. I wouldn't go there without the intention to take the baths. Other day trip options are Nikko, Miura, Okutama, etc.\n\nDay 15\n\nChureito and Kawaguchiko are really doable in a day, nice nature there. I would spend time walking or cycling around the lake. But adding Fuji Q will be a bit tight, the lines there are insane and definetely not worth for a theme restaurant in my opinion. Some of rides are world-class though.\n\nAs well - November will be autumn leaves (koyo) season, so check the places that have a lot of maples (momiji) and gingko trees. And then you can decide whether to go there or avoid it - it gets very busy.",

    "postText": "Hi there. We're super excited to finally get to go to Japan. It will be our (husband and myself) first trip. We're retired so not youngsters but are pretty fit but not big adventurers. We like to have a little more time to discover things and not be going from dawn to dusk every day. So we're planning a week in Tokyo, 2 nights in Hakone, a week in Kyoto, 5 nights in Osaka/Kobe, 2 nights in Koyasan, 2 nights in Hiroshima and 4 nights in Fukuoka. We'd like to see the highlights and find some gems that are off the beaten path, without being too difficult to get to. Thanks kind Reddit folks!\n\nHere's what I've planned so far by day.\n\n\\- I'd particularly love comments on if my plans seem reasonable or if days should be broken up bc of logistics.\n\n\\- I'd also love any suggestions on nearby places off the beaten path that we shouldn't miss. We have room in this itinerary to add a new place if it's truly special. I've done a lot of global travel but never been to Japan so I feel like this trip is to see the biggest hits and see if we can discover a few gems. We're hoping a month gives us time to do both.\n\n\\- Do you see any red flags with the itinerary? If you hate the hotel I've picked, pls let me know why.\n\n\\- I'm super excited about the food in Japan and you'll note I've planned to visit a lot of them. If you have suggestions for places that aren't too touristy but you loved your meal, please let me know. I'll be flying blind. Any gluten free suggestions are particularly helpful. We eat early so hopefully can avoid the crowds.\n\n\\- I'd love to ebike part of the Kurushima Kaiko route. My husband would not enjoy this so it would be solo so I just want to take the better part of a day and do part of it and then train or ferry back to Onomichi. Does anyone know if there is a train or ferry that leaves later in the day from the Innoshima or Ikuchi island that returns to the mainland so I can ride back to Onomichi? And are bikes allowed on trains or ferries?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Tokyo. Arrive 3 pm. Go to Hotel Metropolitan Tokyo Marounichi\n    \n    1\tTokyo Tower / VR Ctr / Shinjuku Gyoen Ntl Garden / Shibuya Ctr &amp; sky at night / Shinjuku Yokojo\n    \n    2\tSenso-Ji / Kabuchiko \n    \n    3\tMishima sky walk in Yokohama\n    \n    4\tUnclear if Teamlabs is open in Tokyo but if it is, we'll probably visit\n    \n    5\t\n    \n    6\t\n    \n    7\t\n    \n    Eat     Sushi Yajima (res-req)\n    \n    \tOmoide Yokocho area\n    \n    \tObei sushi- heard this was good local sushi.

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nSince no one has answered...\n\nI'm older, but not retiree age, but I do get not wanting to push yourself and some people's itineraries make it exhausted just reading them!\n\nHowever in terms of your itinerary:\n\nThe Mishima Skywalk isn't in Yokohama and is not all that close to Yokohama, it's in Mishima which is  past Atami and Odawara.  I don't think you are doing it the same day as Yokohama.  You could consider it as a stop off on your way from Hakone to Kyoto.\n\nI would look at a map.  It seems weird to do Shinjuku gyoen on day 1 and Kabukicho  on day 2.  You have the time but criss crossing Tokyo is exhausting and I recommend against doing it unless you have a very specific reason.\n\nI can't imagine making Eikando an entire day.  Move it to your Nanzenji day.  I would also move Kurama and Kibune around and come up with something else to do post Kinkakuji.  \n\nUnlike a lot of people I like Osaka Castle, but I think of it as a cool museum about the siege of Osaka Castle shaped like a Castle vs. a castle.\n\nI would move one of your Osaka nights to Hiroshima, maybe more.\n\nYou are not doing the loop bus, rabbit island and Onomichi all in one day.  Rabbit island is not that easy to get to.  You need to transfer to a local train line and then take a ferry to the island.  It's like a good portion of the day trip.\n\nI like Fukuoka, I'm not sure I would consider it an off the beaten path destination?  It's incredibly popular with Koreans because there is a ferry you can take  from Busan directly to Fukuoka and there are lots of flights, so it's not exactly off the beaten path?\n\nI'm honestly not sure what you would define as off the beaten path.  Do you meant places no one is going to?  Places few obvious foreigners go?\n\nGood luck!",

I think there are also a lot of younger people, which might be why I often see exhausting itineraries.\n\nI confess, I have probably done a few things people would look at me like I was crazy for doing, but I've also been to Japan multiple times, and have been known to get impatient and just... not really spend time doing something lol\n\nBut yeah, I would think of what you mean by off the beaten path.\n\nAgain, this is not to put Fukuoka down, but from my understanding Hagi, Akiyoshidai, Izumo and Matsue are much more off the beaten path than Fukuoka and you could use that as a route to slowly back track towards Osaka and your flight.\n\nShikoku might also give you that feeling.  I am specifically trying to think about places from whence you could slowly head back towards Osaka (which is why I am not recommending places in the Chubu or Tohoku regions.)\n\nAgain, I really like Fukuoka, but it's a major city and outside of Hakone, you're pretty much just staying in cities.\n\nIn terms of gluten-free the big thing you will need to watch for is soy sauce, since it often is produced with wheat.  \n\nGood luck!",

I'd like to not be completely crowded with tourists the whole time. I've gone to a lot of the big landmarks so to to avoid crowds, I visit adjacent places. Ie, Instead of Paris, we'll go to a charming town a few hours away. I can't do that in Japan since I haven't been there and am dying to some of the landmarks. But I'm still looking for a quiet experience for part of it and just want to enjoy their unspoiled nature.",

I would say the bigger issue is a lot of good natural and hiking destinations are not viable for when you are traveling or are closing down for the Winter as such.  Many of them are in the mountains, like Kamikochi.\n\nThere are still 100% places that rarely get foreign tourists, you're just less likely to find them in major cities.  \n\nI also was thinking about it and I think people didn't respond because you have many empty days.  People don't mind planning a day or two for someone, but multiple days will get people less interested, because then it feels like they are planning your trip.\n\nYou have a week's worth of empty days.\n\nIf you're looking for a quieter experience I would nix Fukuoka and go to Shikoku or along the Sea of Japan coast back to Osaka for your flight.",

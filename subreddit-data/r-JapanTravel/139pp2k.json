    "postText": "Thank you for reading the post. For the Chubu portion of our trip, we are staying at a Ryokan at Okuhida Onsen for two evenings. For our only full day in Chubu, I was wondering if the following itinerary is possible or advisable:\n\nDay in Chubu \n\n- from Okuhida Onsen, go to Kamikochi in early morning, arrive at 8 am.\n- arrive at Shirakawago, lunch at Irori at 2 pm.\n- explore Shirakawago.\n\nI have two main questions:\n\n1. Is it viable to see Kamikochi in this period of time? Would we be in a rush?\n2. We are planning to rent a car. I know that cars can't enter Kamikochi. Is driving to the entrance and then walking to Taisho pond and other locations viable? Or is it better to take the bus up and walk from the bus terminal?\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Hello!\n\nI've been to Kamikochi a few times. I do not recommend doing both of these the same day! Kamikochi is very beautiful and I do recommend going (especially if you're going during autumn).\n\nYou're correct, no cars can enter. You must take a bus to enter Kamikochi since there isn't any (good) acess from the parking lots. If I remember correctly, the bus ride from the public parking lot to the top (where you can hike from) is close to an hour. The hike to the lake might take anywhere from 2-4 hours (depending on endurance and crowds) round-trip. Then, the bus down is going to take about the same amount of time (if not longer) and usually driving out is a bit crowded as well. \n\nDriving to Shirakawa will take about 2 hours once you get off the mountain. That's a lot of driving/traveling in one day. And, you'll probably be very tired after Kamikochi. So, theoretically, you could visit Kamikochi during the time frame you suggested, but it's a very taxing schedule.\n\nIf you're looking for lunch spots, there are plenty in Kamikochi! Curry and rice (with an onsen egg) is my favorite lunch item there and it can be found near the top of the hike. There are also a few different places to get apple soft serve ice cream (and other apple products) around the area. Apples are famous in Nagano, so it's a special treat!\n\nAfter Kamikochi, if you're not too tired, I would recommend visiting Matsumoto. It's a very cool city! You can visit Matsumoto castle (I love having a picnic on the castle grounds) or the art museum. Also, there are quite a few places open late in the city if you want late night food/drinks.",

Maybe see Matsumoto afterwards. Return to Ryokan for dinner.\n\nDay 2:  check out ryokan. return car in Takayama. Visit Shirogawa-go. Travel to Kyoto in the afternoon. Arrive at Kyoto in the evening. \n\nOption 2\n\nDay 1: full day in area around shirogawa-go. \n\nDay 2: check out Ryokan. See Kamikochi. Leave in the afternoon, return rental car in Takayama. Depart for Kyoto in the late afternoon/early evening.\n\nWhich do you think is better? Or are both unviable and should I just pick one?",

I think either of these plans would work fine if you're up for it! \n\nI will say this: right now, I'm returning to Nagano (where I live) from Kyoto. Kyoto is a lot of walking!!!! I just did a week in Osaka/Kyoto and I am exhausted. I averaged about 23,000 steps a day. I haven't been to Shirogawa, so I'm not sure how taxing it is, but it might be worth it to take it easy on the second day to prepare for the next few days! I am just a touch out of shape, so if you hike/walk long distances regularly then you should be fine. After hiking, I highly recommend enjoying an onsen!",

            "comment": "People have already answered your main question, let me just say few more things:\n\n\\- if you are travelling as a family (or any group 3-4 ppl), consider taking taxi from the parking lot, you don't need to wait (the buses are not that frequent... and might get full if you don't buy ticket in advance, in which case you lose flexibility to stay longer and enjoy views where you like them) and it will be similar price. Taxi price is about 3500 to Taisho lake or 4200 to the bus station, bus ticket is 1000 per person I think. \n\n\\- people mention the \"round trip hike\", but I personally recommend getting of at Taisho lake, walking along the river to the bus station (where you can get snack/lunch) and then do the loop. The extra part between Taisho lake and bus station is very nice and lot of ppl skip it so it's not so crowded. It takes extra 60-80 minutes. \n\n\\- I find Shirakawago very underwhelming as it's so packed with tourists every time. Visiting Takayama and Hida no Sato will be much more enjoyable experience in my opinion.",

            "comment": "No.  You can not do Kamikochi and Shirakawa Go in one day.\n\nThere are no parking lots from whence you can walk into Kamikochi.  You have to take a shuttle bus, and all of them run only around twice an hour.  You need to drive from your ryokan to Hirayu and park there to take the shuttle.  When going back you will again need to take a shuttle bus to Hirayu.  There is no place to stop near the entrance of Kamikochi, let alone park.\n\nI really like Matsumoto.  I think trying to do Matsumoto and Kamikochi in one day is going to be very challenging.  In that case you would want to park in Sawando Parking, take their shuttle into the park and then take their shuttle out before driving to Matsumoto.\n\nHave you thought about Hida no Sato in Takayama?",

                            "comment": "So, I personally thought Shirakawa Go was overrated.  I know I am in the minority on this.  I also went to one of the other villages, I don't remember which because I did a paid 1/2 day tour out of Takayama.  It was in 2010, so bus information was less readily available in English and Google translate was not in the same place it is now.\n\nI went in February, so there was a lot of snow.  It looked pretty and I got some nice pictures, but Shirakawa Go itself.... it's a place where people live, so people there need to make money.  It's a lot of shops all selling the same souvenirs, a lot of restaurants or cafes serving the same food, and several minshuku, so people can stay there overnight.  I can't honestly imagine it being 1/2 as scenic or interesting in the Summer, which is presumably when you are going since you are also considering Kamikochi.  To go to Kyoto, you would be better off doing Takayama to Shirakawa Go to Kanazawa to Kyoto, as otherwise you need to back track to Takayama and then head to Nagoya and then Kyoto.  The trip will take longer than via Kanazawa unless you are taking a Nozomi between Nagoya and Kyoto, then they will be about the same.\n\nI think depending on when dinner is served you need to be careful about time going to  Matsumoto, because it is a good 1 hour from the Sawado Parking areai, and can be longer, and then you still have to get to the Hirayu area to drive to Okuhida.  Takayama is at least on the same side as Okuhida unless your definition of Okuhida is being fudged.  I'm suggested thinking about Kamikochi and maybe Hida no Sato and missing Matsumoto, unless you can fit it in before your arrival in Okuhida.\n\nI went to Hida no Sato in June 2017 and really enjoyed it.  I like how it has more about how life use to be in the Hida region and the crafts people use to do to survive.  It's more historical.\n\nWhere are you coming from before going to the Okuhida region?\n\nI would possibly try to fit something in depending on where you are arriving from.  So for example where are you staying the night before you go to the Okuhida region?",

You would then do Okuhida to Hirayu to Kamikochi on your first full day and on your second day either go onwards to Takayama and then to Nagoya to Kyoto or by bus to Shirakawa go and north to Kanazawa to Kyoto, it would depend on what you need to do in Kyoto.  If you end in Kanazawa you could get the 3 Star Bus Pass.\n\nYou could also just eat the 10,000 yen in drop off fees and go Tokyo to Matsumoto, see the castle, then rent the car and go to Okuhida, then go to Kamikochi and eventually drop off the car in Takayama (which will be 10,000 yen or drop off the car in Ishikawa-ken or Toyama-ken, unsure what the fee is, I know it's 10,000 yen for Takayama to Matsumoto since I thought about doing it in 2017.\n\nYou could try to do something in Takayama on arrival day, it's just a really long trip, about 2 hours to Nagoya and then 2.5 hours to Takayama, which makes it hard to get anything done that day when you still have to get to the Okuhida region which is going to run you like 1.5 hours+  from Takayama Station.   The roads just have a really low speed limit and are very twisty.  I also find renting a car in Japan always takes longer than I expect because they want to make sure you understand everything.\n\nI would also, depending on time of year, leave yourself some flexibility.  Our visit to Kamikochi was really heavy rain.  It was really empty and really a bummer lol  I would not recommend Kamikochi in the rain.\n\nIn our case when we visited Kamikochi in 2018 we did:\n\nMatsumoto to Nakanoyu (where we stayed the night and they had a free transfer from Matsumoto to their ryokan) 1 night in Nakanoyu\n\nNakanoyu to Kamikochi (they had free transfers to the park.)  It was pouring rain and we stayed in a cabin in Kamikochi (with hindsight, I should have eaten the cabin money and gone back to Matsumoto!) 1 night in Kamikochi\n\nKamikochi back to Matsumoto (more Matsumoto sightseeing before going back to Nagano and overnighting in Nagano.  We might have done Zenkoji then or the day before, I can't remember.  I've been to Nagano multiple times and really like it, so I want to stress I am in no way trying to put Nagano or Nagano-ken down, just trying to figure out what works for your actual travel.)",

    "postText": "Hi all, First time visiting Japan with my husband (28th April - 11th May) and doing 5 nights in Tokyo, 4 nights Kyoto, 4 nights Osaka. Didn't realise at the time of booking it would be Golden Week so know it will be busy! Would appreciate any feedback please :)\n\nDraft itinerary -\n\nDay 1: Arrive at hotel around 3pm, rest and then visit Akihabara\n\nDay 2: Kameido Tenjin shrine - Imperial Palace - Tokyo Skytree - Tokyo Character street - Shibuya and Shibuya \n\nDay 3: Hitachi Seaside Park\n\nDay 4: Ghibli Museum (booked) - Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building - Meiji Jingu - Yoyogi Park - Takeshita Street\n\nDay 5: Senso-ji - Ueno Park - Nezu Shrine - Teamlab Planets (booked)\n\nDay 6: Forward luggage to Kyoto hotel - Head for Mt Fuji views then make way to Kyoto\n\nDay 7: Free day - Kyoto tower for sunset\n\nDay 8: Sanjusangendo Temple - Kinkaku-ji - Fushimiinari Shrine around sunset\n\nDay 9: Byodoin - Kiyomuzidera - Gion and Kodai-ji\n\nDay 10: Head to Osaka\n\nDay 11: Osaka Castle - Umeda Sky\n\nDay 12: Nara Park - Todai-ji Temple - Byakugoji\n\nDay 13: Shinsaibashi Shopping street - Dotonbori\n\nDay 14: Flight home\n\nOther potential locations if we have time/fancy day trip: Hiroshima, Hakone, Shirai Oomachi Fuji Park / Ashikaga Flower Park\n\nWould appreciate thoughts on:\n\nCouldn't decide between Skytree and Tokyo Met Gov building for views of Tokyo. Which would you recommend?\n\nAfter seeing some Reddit posts, I swapped out Arashiyama for Kodai ji instead as it's more central and apparently less busy. Right move?\n\nFor Mt Fuji views, know we will need to check the weather in advance and it isn't guaranteed, but where does everyone find to be the best viewing spots?\n\nAny other recommendations welcome!!\n\nedit: changed days around slightly as actually managed to get tickets to Ghibli museum so added that in",

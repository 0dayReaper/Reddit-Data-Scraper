            "comment": "Is there a reason you're moving from a hotel in Shinjuku to a hotel in Koto on the 6th? Everything you're interested in seeing in Tokyo should be easily accessible from Shinjuku, and you save time and effort by staying based in one place.\n\nIf you don't drink, you might not get as much out of Golden Gai. I can't say for sure because I've never been there because I also don't drink.\n\nJune 8th _could_ be a bit of a cramped day, depending on how long you plan to spend at each area. If they're all short visits its probably fine, but you could easily skip a few of them and still have a full day with how much there is to do/see in those areas. Also, you can probably save some time by doing Asakusa and Skytree next to each other since they're walking distance apart, but If you intentionally want to do Senso-ji in the morning and Skytree at night, it's understandable.\n\n&gt; explore Haramurikya gardens (will this be closed?) and Tokyo tower\n\nAccording to google maps, the gardens close at 5PM and Tokyo Tower closes at 10:30PM. Considering you arrive at Narita at 6PM and still need time to travel to Tokyo and check into your hotel, you might be able to head over and check out Tokyo Tower for a couple hours before it closes, but that's it.\n\n23rd looks a little light. Might want to keep it that way in case you end up missing something earlier in the trip and want to fit it back in.\n\n&gt; 24th June (Last day in Japan) - Need to get to Haneda before flight at 10:30pm- nothing planned but likely revisit our favourite places in Tokyo\n\nThis is a great idea. I suggest keeping it open for exactly the reasons you specified.\n\nThis is just a personal opinion, but do you really need to visit the Metro Gov Building, Skytree, _and_ Tokyo Tower? Unless you have a hobby of seeing things from above, I would just visit the mall at Skytree, and then check out the observatory deck at Tokyo Tower and skip the Govt building. (Govt building is the only observatory deck I've personally visited, and while it was cool, I don't feel like it was essential sightseeing, and Skytree and Tokyo Tower have more going for them other than just the observation deck.)",

                    "comment": "We originally were planning to stay in Hakone for two days but due to logistics we decided to cancel that and do a day trip, which is much easier for us. Unfortunately due to the last min change, when we tried to extend our stay in the Shinjuku hotel by an extra 2 nights, it wasn't possible. The Koto hotel was the only decent and cheap place available for those timings.\n\nIn that case, we'll just stroll through Golden Gai and sightsee.\n\nThanks for the other advice, I'll have a think about whether we should keep the metropolitan gov building in. We thought the skytree would be best during the night.\n\nFor the Haramurikya gardens, I'm sure we can fit this in maybe in the morning of our last day.",

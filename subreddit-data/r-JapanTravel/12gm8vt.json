            "comment": "Hi\n\nThis is not meant to be rude, but hopefully a helpful critique.\n\nI would never do Harajuku or Shibuya on a week end unless you are really into crowds.\n\nGoing from Asakusa to Shinjuku Gyoen seems, weird.  They're not near one another at all.  Perhaps, you want to combine Asakusa with the National Museum, since it is closed on Monday.\n\n[**https://www.tnm.jp/modules/r\\_free\\_page/index.php?id=113&amp;lang=en**](https://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=113&amp;lang=en)\n\nI would move Hiroshima.  The G7 might end the 21st but I would not want to go to Hiroshima the day after it ends.  I expect there will still be closures, lots of security, and fewer trams/trains.  It's not just world leaders who go to the G7, it's all the support staff and newspeople and I would want to give them a little longer to clear out.\n\nYou have a lot of empty days in Osaka.  I am not sure why you are staying there.\n\nFor other places you can go, there is Okayama and Kurashiki, you could travel to Koya-san, you could visit Himeji or if you want somewhere even quieter go to Hikone.  You could go to Sekigahara Battlefield, you can use JR or the Kintetsu line to visit Ise.  You can go to Kanazawa.\n\nThere are so many options, but I would keep my distance from Hiroshima or passing through Hiroshima around the G7.",

            "comment": "I would recommend the JR and yes upgrade, you will have to book seats bf u ride generally at the train stations but it\u2019s so easy and to have a guaranteed seat is worth it imo, however not sure wya but you might need to order ur pass ASAP\u2026\nETA - DM me if you want any other tips etc, I freaking love Hiroshima as well as Tokyo etc favoring the \u201cless traveled\u201d bits. You got a lot of heavy hitters of spots to visit but I\u2019m not gonna lie my first trip I think the best advice I got was less planning more just exploring. \n\nOne neighborhood I would recommend is Shimokitazawa it\u2019s been described as the \u201cBrooklyn\u201d of Tokyo very cool and hip but it also feels authentic I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. \n\nTokyu Hands is also an incredible visit for shopping they have em all over Japan I recall the one in Osaka has a great record store. \n\nAlso haha, JBS jazz bar in Shibuya is AMAZING the owner has one of the most impressive record collections I\u2019ve ever seen!!!!!!! \n\nMEM Coffee Bar - in Hatagaya is real deal neighborhood shit this is the little 8 seater bar with top notch drinks and of course excellent music, feel like one of the locals ! \nI love sharing my faves !!!!!!\n\nDang apologies I keep adding but if Architecture is your thang the EDO TOKYO open air architecture museum is a MUST then, it\u2019s wee bit away from the city center but it\u2019s so beautiful and full of history!!!!",

Worth looking into bc the collection and set up will blow your mind !!! \nNEW MATANGO is another late night spot in the area that is a do not miss !!! \n\nBASEMENT BAR nearby ish will give you those mid-size dive bar feelings, Im from Chicago and it feels very like the empty bottle lol.\nKINGUU in Osaka is a very strange bar not for the faint of heart as it\u2019s filled with taxidermy and oddities but again if you like strange this is a great spot to start and I recommend just exploring the area as there are lots of interesting spots.\nIf you are in Osaka for a while why not hop over to Nara for a day trip ? So Beautiful!!! &amp; Shitennoji in Osaka is a temple with a big turtle pond it\u2019s pretty cool! \nI\u2019ve spent less time in Osaka unfortunately but I hope this is helpful! Really I try to kinda plan one thing a day and just kinda find stuff like lil festivals going on or similar:-) Have a GREAT TRiP !!!!!",

            "comment": "Based on your interest and my experience (15 day trip starting end of March) I would say cut out a day or two from Tokyo at the start and just get to Kyoto and spend more time there. It\u2019s awesome, there is so much to do and it\u2019s stuff that is best done in the morning before crowds, then you can spend the rest of the day walking around, eating, and possibly seeing a performance or doing a reserved tour/experience.\n\nI did Hiroshima, Bunny Island, Kyoto, Disney, and then ended in Tokyo because I wanted to be able to do my shopping last and not worry about dragging stuff around with me. If I did the trip again I would do 5-6 days in Kyoto and 3-4 in Tokyo. I will write a trip recap soon with more.",

Many people go out of their way to \u201cabuse\u201d the jr pass taking trips they would probably not have taken without it but in honesty if you aren\u2019t getting close to the value riding the shinkansen you should just pass on it.",

    "postText": "Hi,  \n\nI'm in charge of planning a trip to Japan in June with a group of friends (5 people). We'll stay for 18 days and I have some questions:  \n\n- We want to visit both Hiroshima and Miyajima as a day trip from Kyoto. That should be possible if we keep don't dawdle around, right? Furthermore I heard the Hiroshima Flower Festival is set for June 10/11, which is a possible date for us to go there. But is it worth to visit on the day of the festival, or does it make no sense with our tight schedule? (I fear it might be very crowded and \"normal\" sightseeing hardly possible).  \n- We would like to visit lake Biwa for bathing on a sunny day and also rent a bicycle there to explore the region. But lake Biwa is huge, do you have recommendations for specific spots? (Visiting from Kyoto; maybe Omimaiko beach, but are there bicycle rentals?)  \n- About Sanno Matsuri: I know the \"full\" version is only in even years, but I can't find any information on what the small version is. Just some street stalls I suppose? Is that worth it?  \n- Here is the planned itinerary for our whole stay. Is there anything that doesn't make sense? Any stuff that we should book in advance? Is there anything that is closed on those dates?\n\n**Osaka:**\n\n- Tue 06 Jun - Arrival in the evening, probably just grabbing some food next to the hotel in Dotonbori\n- Wed 07 Jun - Checking out the city (Umeda, Namba)  \n- Thu 08 Jun - Day trip to Nara\n- Fri 09 Jun - Not decided yet, maybe Osaka Aquarium + Minoo Park or Nintendo World\n\n**Kyoto:**\n\n- Sat 10 Jun - Kinkakuji, Nishijin Textile Center Kimono show, Imperial Palace\n- Sun 11 Jun - Day trip to Hiroshima/Miyajima (including Flower Festival)\n- Mon 12 Jun - Ginkakuji, Heian Shrine, Gion, Kiyomizudera, Fushimi Inari Shrine\n- Tue 13 Jun - Arashiyama (Monkey Park, Bamboo Forest, Sagano Scenic Railway, maybe Hozugawa River Cruise)\n- Wed 14 Jun - Day trip to lake Biwa if sunny (Bathing, cycling)\n\n**Tokyo:**\n\n- Thu 15 Jun - Skytree, Asakusa, Ueno Park (maybe Zoo), Ameyoko\n- Fri 16 Jun - Shibuya (Takeshita-dori, Shibuya crossing, Shibuya sky etc.)\n- Sat 17 Jun - Shinjuku (Metropolitan Government Building, Omoide Yokocho, Kabukicho etc.)\n- Sun 18 Jun - Day trip to Yokohama (Minato Mirai, Chinatown, Ramen Museum)\n- Mon 19 Jun - Akihabara\n- Tue 20 Jun - Odaiba, Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo Tower, Ginza\n- Wed 21 Jun - Day trip to Hakone\n- Thu 22 Jun - Takao-san hiking\n- Fri 23 Jun - Disney Land\n- Sat 24 Jun - Departure  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nEdit: Thank you for all the reponses, I'll adjust our plans accordingly! And we will also keep the heat in mind when we pack our bags.",

You end up spending the day running around instead of being in the place. \n\nAs someone who traveled around the same time heat in the afternoon can be brutal. When possible choose breathable clothing (linen, travel wool, technical fabrics) over items like cotton which can soak through with sweat. On the worst days +40c we would wake up early to get to our planned location at open. Do things until 11-1pm and find something in AC or rest up in our room till 3-5 when the worst of the heat of the day had passed.\n\nGion midday is just okay. It is better bright and early when there are few people around or around peak activity ~5-8 pm.\n\nWith 5 people be okay with some splitting up. It improved out trip of 4 people once we did not try to mesh everyones schedule. A bit of friction was removed. Meet up for lunch or dinner discuss your days.",

Spread out and hit up some more interesting neighborhoods. No need for a full day in Akihabara, I don't think.\n\nSeconding re: heat. The humidity is truly brutal. You'll be drenched in sweat 30 seconds after leaving your hotel. Just be prepared.",

(Plus great food!)\n\nI've done the hiking at Takao-san and really enjoyed it! It's not too crazy, and you do get a view of Mt Fuji at the top if it's a clear day.",

            "comment": "Kinkakuji and Fushimi Inari are on opposite sides of the city. That\u2019s going to waste a lot of time traveling between the two. Better to do the NW corner on the day you arrive in Kyoto, then work your way down the west side, then do Fushimi Inari and all the surrounding shrines and temples (and there are a lot!) on the second day.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend trying to do Hiroshima and Miyajima in a single day if there is a festival going on. It will be very crowded. The Peace Museum would be hard with such crowds. It\u2019s also about 2 hrs each way from Kyoto by Shinkansen (bullet train), and the ferry to Miyajima stops relatively early.\n\nYou could see the Dome and go to the island and back to Kyoto in a single day, but it would be like walking by and saying \u201cLook! There\u2019s a building! There are deer!\u201d with no time at all to actually sit down and appreciate what you are seeing.\n\nWhen elementary schools take excursions to Hiroshima, they see the dome and the Peace Park, then head over to Miyajima and spend the night on the island.\nMy sister did the same when she came to visit.",

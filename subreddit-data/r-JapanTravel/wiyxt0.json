    "postText": "* Some backstory.\n\nOkay I was born in Japan but live in America but at the time this was posted, I'm in Japan for vacation. This year has been super fun for me especially since I couldn't go to Japan for 2 summers (since we go to Japan yearly.) A lot of people who plan to come to Japan don't have a lot on their mind, so here are some places to visit to spice up your trip (which will be cut into chapters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# My way to Kamikochi\n\n* About Kamikochi\n\nKamikochi is a mountain range in Nagano prefecture. Many tourists come yearly from Spring-Fall to see and climb this glorious mountain. At the top of some select mountains can be found huts where you can buy gifts for family and friends, eat, and have fun. Gondolas are also an option to view the landscape via the Shin-Hotaka line. I'm not a professional on this mountain range so if you want more info on Kamikochi, go to their information site:  \n[https://www.kamikochi.org/](https://www.kamikochi.org/)\n\nI went to many places along the way and nearby that you should visit.\n\n* Apple and Roses\n\nNagano prefecture is widely known for its delicious apples. Located in Azumino, Nagano (with other locations that I will list soon) can be found a store with delicious pastries and beverages. Mostly known for their \"Rose-like Cake\" which as of the time this post has been uploaded, can only be bought via take-out. The owner, who I can't find the name of (probably for the best to keep her privacy safe) is a woman who serves you. She was very kind to me and her mother was even there eating as well. I had one of if not the best apple juice there and my mother and father had this rose soda (that had edible rose petals on the bottom which frankly is quite hilarious). Like I said the owner was very nice and even though most resturants/places in Japan don't want you to tip, you should if she allows.\n\nLocations to every \"Apple and Roses\" in Japan:\n\n8161-1 Hotakaariake, Azumino, Nagano 399-8301\n\n\u3012151-6101 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Shibuya, 2 Chome\u221224\u221212 \u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30a8\u30a2 \u6771\u6025\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30a8\u30c3\u30b8 1F Carat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Hotaka station (plus its surrounding area).\n\nHotaka, located in Azumino (inside Nagano prefecture) like every place in Japan, has a train station. But Hotaka station in my eyes was a special station we accidentally stumbled upon. Hotaka station is small but very unique. It was an old styled station. I don't have much to talk about Hotaka but if you want to get there, you get there by using the Azumino-Hotaka line but that is only if you are in a nearby area, so overall I recommend you just drive there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Villa Yoshino\n\nVilla Yoshino is an interesting type of hotel, but instead of it being a hotel it is actually renting out a cabin that acts like a hotel. It contains everyday necessities, such as a bath, cleaning products, a TV, beds. It is basically a house. It does not contain food but not to worry there are local supermarkets to get food from. There are many things to do in the cabin such as playing games with the family (if you brought any), watch Netflix for free all night, or have a barbecue. The owner is a very nice man who gives you free apple juice (probably the best I had in my life) and lettuce (the best lettuce in my life no doubt). It is small acts like these make Villa Yoshino very different. If you ever go, make sure to write down your experiences in a provided black cover book!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Shonan\n\n* What is \"Shonan\" and how do I get there?\n\nShonan has been described from Wikipedia as \"the region along the coast of the Sagami Bay\". Shonan is most well known for the scenery along the beach.\n\n If you are interested in going somewhere along the Shonan coast, there are many options to get there, well at least from the perspective of if you went to a plane going to Haneda and not Narita, so if you are a Narita user, I can't help in the situation. From Narita, take a bus, taxi, train, or subway to Tokyo station and switch to the Tokkaido line. Until you get anywhere between Yokohama (JT 05) or Oiso (JT 12). Another option if you are already in Japan or are a Japanese citizen is to go via the Sagami, or Enoshima electric Railway Line. The Sagami line goes from Hachioji to Chigasaki (Do not mistaken Chigaski for Kita-Chigasaki). Chigasaki is closest to the Sagami Bay via this line. If you want to get closer, the Enoshima Electric Railway Line is the best experience you can get with Shonan. It runs from Fujisawa to Kamakura. The entire line is close to the bay so you can get a great view. But after you get to see this spectacular bay, there may be other things you wanna do here. Since I have been going to Japan for about 90 days, I stay at my grandma's house (in Japanese it is named \"baba\") in Chigasaki (JT 10), I have many experiences to talk about in this section. So here are some places you should visit in the Shonan area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Terrace Mall\n\nTerrace Mall located in Tsujido (JT 09). It is connected with Tsujido station. So there is no trouble finding the mall. The mall has 4 floors of shopping and eating. There is a lot to do there and I have fun everytime I go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Fujisawa Station\n\nFujisawa station is connected with a huge mall like a lot of other stations but Fujisawa isn't super major but there is still a lot to do in and out the station.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Yokohama Station\n\nYokohama is the capital of where the city is located in, Kanagawa prefecture. But Yokohama station is just something of its own. The train station is connected to another mall. One of its most noticeable features is the Yokohama Pokemon Center. Many people come to Yokohama just for the Pokemon Center. But there are other wonders inside the station too. And don't worry there is a plentiful of ways to get to Yokohama such as the Yokosuka, Kehin-Tohoku, Keikyu, and Tokyu Toyoko lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Gundam Factory\n\nFor any Gundam fan out looking at this post right now, this place is for you! Located in Yokohama (methods of how to get there listed in the previous paragraph). The main attraction of the factory is the Gundam machine that moves at certain times.\n\nLocation of Gundam Factory:\n\n279-25 Yamashitacho, Naka Ward, Yokohama, Kanagawa 231-0023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Enoshima Aquarium\n\nI have been to this aquarium many times because of how fun it is. A wide variety of fish can be found in the aquarium and the dolphin show is very entertaining to watch.\n\nEnoshima Aquarium location:\n\n2 Chome-19-1 Katasekaigan, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-0035\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# My trip to Hakone\n\n* About Hakone\n\nHakone is similar to Kamikochi because both are mountain ranges. One major difference with Hakuba is that many people live on the mountain range. \n\nThe easiest way is to get to Odawara station before switching to the Hakone-Tozan line. This chapter is going to talk about every station using the gondola from Sounzan (OH 62) - Togendai (OH 65).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sounzan (OH 62)\n\nSounzan is connected to the cable car from it to Gora (OH 57). Sounzan is the first station using the gondola. The view from Sounzan is beautiful and you can do it while eating or drinking a small treat. The ku-mo (meaning cloud in Japanese because the station's elevation is 757 meters above sea level) has a cool drink that contains cotton candy on the rim of the cup to represent the clouds.\n\nSea Level:\n\n\\+757m\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Owakudani (OH 63)\n\nOwakudani is the second station using the gondola. Owakudani is one of the most unique stations in Japan. Owakudani station and its surroundings emit volcanic gases that are hazardous to breathe in. If you go to Hakuba, please avoid this station if you have medical problems, you are a senior, you have a young child, or have severe asthma. Owakudani is also known (besides for the volcanic gases) for their black colored eggs. A short summary of these black eggs is that they take normal eggs and dip them in some sort of liquid. I'm not a professional, so if you want to learn more, use this website: \n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5203.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5203.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSea Level:\n\n\\+1044m (The highest point in the entire OH line)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Ubako (OH 64)\n\nUbako is a normal station to stop by if you live nearby. Is the 3rd station using the gondola\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSea Level:  \n\\+878m\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Togendai\n\nThe 4th station to use the gondola, Togendai's outside of the station has Lake Ashi. Lake Ashi is used to transfer to the cruise line to Hakone-machi (OH 66). However I did not go any further than Togendai so I can't go further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# End\n\n* Conclusion\n\nI had a lot of fun with these experiences and it made going through the pandemic shenanigans less, well, annoying. I hope this post gives you things to do on your vacation to Japan (if you are going). If this helps with anything, that would make me so happy especially because of how long it took me to write this post. \n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "I will be staying in Osaka for a while, and I am looking at doing a day trip to Naruto to see the whirlpools while I am there.  I understand the best way to get there via public transport is through the highway bus, but I am finding it difficult to find the details for the bus I would need to book.\n\nFrom what I have researched, it sounds like the bus will make a stop at Naruto Park near the whirlpools on the way from Osaka, but on the return journey it does not stop there and I must go to  Kosoku Naruto to board the bus.\n\nHowever, the problem I am finding is that I cannot find a bus to book that stops at either stop.  Through a booking system for the bus I have found a bus that goes from Osaka to Tokushima via Naruto - the Takamatsu Express Bus 101 - but the stops listed are Kosoku Awaji Shichi (which is far too early to disembark) followed by Naruto-Nishi (which is far too late to disembark).  Is this the correct bus and it actually makes stops between these destinations that are not listed, or do I need a completely different bus?",

After selecting your bus, you should be able to choose your preferred starting and ending bus stops, I believe.  Also, if you're traveling on a day when the Otsuka Museum of Art is open, you can board a bus near the museum.",

    "postText": "Hi\n\nWe are going on a two weeks trip in Japan during August, since this trip is preceded by another two months long oversea stays we will have large quantities of luggage and suitcases. So with all these things considered, public transporation is simply too unrealistic and cumbersome for us to use. We are currently planning on going on a typical two weeks iteniery with a few days in Tokyo, then a day near Mt.Fuji, then Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, rounding it all out just under two weeks. Cost for this trip is of not much concern, what I am wondering is\n\n1. how was the adjustment and acclimation while driving in Japan coming from US (Right hand side traffic)? Road rule, traffic, signs, navigation, language barrier possibly?\n2. Parking availability at major tourist attractions? Are there enough parking lots available so that we don't spend an hour looking around? We probably would park our cars at hotel if its already close by, but we would still like a general gist of how parking is.\n3. Do most hotels have enough parking? I know some hotels say they have overnight parking but I am not sure if they are filled or not as we are going during the peak season.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnything else about driving in Japan we should know?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

I have no clue how easy or hard driving in Japan is, but I can say that Yamato was really easy to use with help from the front desks of the hotels my husband and I stayed in. The luggage forwarding service is pretty reasonably priced too.",

They will accept your luggage before arrival, and help you send it wherever you need to upon your exit.  This will also store it for you for the day you check out, if you need them to.\n\nNone of this will be out of the ordinary for them.\n\nThey do have weight limits, though, so prepare to remove things or rearrange them to get under the limit.  I even had one hotel make me remove things because my bags were just barely under the limit and they wanted some wiggle room.\n\nDriving just because you have luggage is crazy.  This country is built around people traveling with no car.  You'll waste so much time driving if you do this.  If you were here for two months, it might be a nice diversion, but two with two weeks, you have better ways to spend your time.",

Fuji is right outside of Kanto, so assuming you don't mean delivery to the actual mountain, they probably can.  To Kansai is maybe doable, too, but next day is more likely.  You'd be better off bringing a second, smaller bag to carry with one day worth of clothes and things.",

If you've never driven on the left, be careful, you will probably have a tendency to drive way too much on the left at first (because the barycenter of the car is opposite to what you are used to). You will probably use the wipers instead of the signals a couple times.\n\nDriving in cities is not overly complicated, traffic is quite smooth as most people will use public transportation to commute. There are urban highways in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, which are quite easy to navigate. \n\nSpeed limits are quite low, probably much lower than what you are used to, but most drivers actually don't respect them. As a tourist, be careful though. There are a couple rules you need to keep in mind (no turn on red signal, contrary to some areas in the US for instance).  The \"[stop](https://www.zurich.co.jp/-/Media/jpz/zrh/car/useful/guide/cc-stop-sign-roaddisplay/img_re/cc-stop-sign-roaddisplay_img_001.jpg)\" sign is sometimes in Japanese only, and also [on the road](https://kuruma-news.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/20200602_hyoshiki_001.jpg?v=1591089192). Note that a white line does not necessarily means \"stop\", just that there is an intersection. [This sign](https://img.bestcarweb.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/23112155/46dd8543d8ff19eb2d2ade3e0f460f8f16.jpg) is quite common and means there is an incoming pedestrian crossing.  Drive slowly and carefully, take a bit of slack in your timing, you should be fine.\n\nImho the situation you need to be extra careful is when you want to turn right, crossing the incoming traffic. \n\nParking is usually available at most tourist destinations. If you don't go during a peak touristic period, there should not be any issue (... so, when is it in August, because if during oBon you may have a problem there). Parking can get expensive, so will tolls. And yes, most hotels have parkings, and if cost is not an issue and you are staying in a upscale place, you should be fine.\n\nOutside of highways, driving on regular roads will be -very, very, very slow-. Roads don't go around cities or villages, they go trough them, and you'll get all the signals, etc. Going above 50 km/h on average is already quite good on Honshu.\n\nGet a car navigation system, and make sure you can set it up in English. Most direction signs will be in alphabet on top of Japanese, some warnings or side info sometimes not (info about closures, bad weather, accidents, etc.), but there is not much you can do and it's usually not \"critical\".\n\nAnd take the chance that you have a car to go a bit out of the way in less accessible areas....",

The luggage is handled with better care than the baggage handlers at the airport do.  Use your carry-on bag for your day items for the trip to fuji, take the bus, and enjoy the extra few hours to see the main tourist sights without needing to figure out road rules in a country with top quality public transportation.\n\nIf you're extra worried about moving your luggage from airport to hotel, be aware taxis are expensive but perfectly viable option for the convenience.\n\nThe only places/times I've chosen to rent and drive in Japan has been incredibly rural areas up north, and that's more because the logistics of transportation were incredibly inconvenient.

As others have mentioned, I would think you could store the bulk of your luggage in Tokyo for the duration of your trip and pick it up when you leave Japan.\n\nBut traveling by car will provide a very different experience, and that has some value in itself. If you get off the highway, you'll get to see a lot of Japan that is mostly invisible from the Shinkansen, and easily hit some out of the way tourist sites for which public transportation is quite complex or infrequent.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are near a big city finding parking will be a constant concern. If the navigation system can find garages then it may not be too big a problem, but I would not count on parking always being available right next to your destination. \n\nAlso, while you should be able to acclimate yourself to driving in Japan within a few hours, keep in mind that side streets/back roads and parking facilities are often much, much narrower/tighter than in western countries (especially U.S.). So this can require a much higher level of concentration/precision then driving elsewhere - not necessarily a problem, but can take extra time. I recall a couple times driving in the countryside on a two-way road with only one narrow lane, which means every time you meet another car (hopefully not often) one of you two will have to back up until there's a shoulder or driveway so you can get out of the way.",

But here's my thoughts based on my experience in driving in Hokkaido:  \n- traffic rules are straightforward. Traffic lights, stop signs. If turning, give way to pedestrians.  \n- the language barrier wasn't an issue except when entering toll roads. My rental car didn't come with a toll payment card so I had to stop at each toll gate to pay with a credit card and those operators didn't speak English. Plus you can't really use Google Translate in that situation as they're talking through a speaker thing, they're not actually in front of you. I still managed although that was probably more due to the toll gate operators' patience!  \n- no roundabouts which was a surprise to me! Atleast as far as I can tell. This should make it easier to acclimatise to driving on the left for you as one less thing to think about  \n- speed limits are so low! I was in the countryside and roads that would be 110 km/h in Australia were 50 km/h here! It was quite frustrating after the noveltywore off. Distances which seem small enough end up eating a major part of your day.   \n- on that note, everyone speeds. In the 50 zone everyone was doing 70, in the 100 km/hr expressways everyone was doing 120.\n- which must mean there's a lack of speed cameras, at least in Hokkaido. \n- it's easy enough to drive and navigate here due to the overall slow speeds. And they use this Mapcode system here where places and attractions have a unique code. You just have to google the code and punch that number into your GPS system if you don't know/can't read the road name of your destination.\n\nOverall I'm quite frustrated at the fact that it took me 7 hours to drive 259km with no traffic. Too slow.  I'm not sure if the attractions I visited were worth that time commitment. \n\nIf Tokyo to Osaka by train is doable for you with takkyubin, do that. It will likely be faster than driving if my experience in Hokkaido is anything to go by.",

Japan often has much narrower roads and spaces than typical US/North America - think city centre, not suburban, space (in equivalent North American terms).\n\nNavi should be fine because most cars are equipped with Bluetooth and you can connect your Google Map Navi to it (assuming you will have data connection). Bear in mind that if you do not read any Japanese characters or kanji (aka English only), reading the romanji may be slow and makes for exhausting Navi. If you are only planning your drive to be for the main artillery between Osaka and Tokyo, it should be fine, but Google Map also Navi through their idea of \u201coptimized\u201d route without taking into account of how narrow some \u201chighway\u201d is if you ever go further afield.\n\nOn the other hand, as many other have suggested, Takkubin is a great option. If you have A LOT of luggages, you can consider separating your belonging to \u201cday trip\u201d vs \u201cfew days\u201d vs \u201clong term\u201d - Takkubin can deliver between 1-7 days after shipping (the shortest is next day iirc, but they will hold the luggage up to 7 days before sending it to the destination). So you could also use Takkubin as a \u201cstorage\u201d. Further, if you are going Tokyo &gt; Osaka &gt; Tokyo, you can book the same hotel in Tokyo and many hotels would accommodate holding your luggages until your return (YMMV depending on how much luggage and your specific hotel).",

            "comment": "I just came back from Japan and did a 1-day drive from Hakone to Osaka. This was my first time driving on the other side of the road (US based too), and needless to say I was pretty worried before getting behind the wheel. We opted to drive because it was a group of four and we had luggage and we thought it would be cheaper than taking the train. I think it ended up only being slightly cheaper with all of the gas, tolls, etc. \n\nThe biggest learning curve for me was the turning signal lol. It\u2019s also on the right, so I spent the first couple of times turning on the wipers instead. I was very conscious of my turns and literally had to speak out loud that turning left meant turning closer and turning right meant turning wider. \n\nThe other thing I realized was that cars in Japan and roads felt narrower than US. You probably get used to it after awhile, but I was very conscious when there was another car to my right. I spent most of my drive on the highway (roads felt so smooth compared to when I drive in NYC) and that felt pretty much the same as driving in the US. Google Maps worked perfectly fine, but didn\u2019t say out the exit names, so you just have to pay attention as you\u2019re driving for exits. Speed limit was 80km/hr but folks were doing prob 15-20km/hr faster on the highway. \n\nGet a ETC card from your rental company; it\u2019s used to pay for toll roads. Also, I find American rental companies pretty lax with their pick-up/return rules (like when I need to extend for Avis in the US, they usually don\u2019t charge me for the extra hours), but the Japanese rental company I used was pretty strict about returning at the agreed upon time. \n\nGood luck if you decide to rent a car! Take a couple of practice turns to feel comfortable at the rental car site and you\u2019ll slowly get the hang of it!",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI have rented a car in Japan and I have used TakQbin frequently because I like to shop but have limited bags on the train.\n\nFor renting a car, the big thing is many Japanese cars are small and to get one larger enough to hold lots of suitcases is going to be a little expensive,. unless there is just 1 of you.  You are also looking at gas, toll way and drop off fees.  It can add up a lot, much more so than the train.  A lot of hotels in major cities have very limited parking and charge several thousand yen for overnight parking.  I think some activities it is easy to find a paid lot nearby and other not so much.  If you were looking to go somewhere with more limited public transport I would definitely support you on the rental car, but you're pretty much just doing the Tokaido line.\n\nTakQBin/Yamato Transport/luggage delivery is great.  It generally takes about 2 days at this time.  You just go to bell services in your hotel.  There might be a few smaller hotels that don't offer the service so just check when you book.  In your case, I would send my bags from Tokyo to either Kyoto or Osaka which ever one you plan to stay in and bring a small bag for Kawaguchiko and Nagoya.\n\nI would then send the bags onward to the airport, just make sure to ask how far in advance you can do that.\n\nI think the biggest problem with a lot of bags is depending on the room you stay in it can be tight.  There are large hotel rooms in Japan, you just need to be spending the money for them.\n\nIn general shinkansen are faster than driving.  I am planning a trip through Tohoku and while I can get a TEP to cover expressways, I plan to also use the shinkansen in between areas cause the train from Morioka to Shichinohoe-Towada is faster than by car even on the expressway.  (And I will rent a car there to drive to Osorezan which has terrible public transit, as an example.)\n\nGood luck!",

In that time without our large luggage we did a trip to hakone and then met up with the luggage in kyoto. \n\nFrom kyoto we sent our luggage to Tokyo while we went to a ryokan in Nagano. \n\nWe traveled using shinkansen and with our carry-on bags. That was plenty and it was easy. We traveled in the green cars. \n\nFor the logistics of how to send luggage: we went through the front desk service of our hotel. They filled out the forms and handled the details. We just paid and left. \n\nFor timing, from Tokyo to kyoto, it was at least two days. There was no one day option using yamato (black cat) service which was the one the hotel used. \n\nWe were very pleased with the results. The traveling with minimal luggage, meeting our checked suitcases, then sending them on again. It was efficient and simple. \n\nMost hotels offer the service. Many even have if they offer the service in a FAQ because it is quite common to do. \n\nFor same day delivery between cities it's probably a bit more involved to do since you would have to find a company willing to guarantee it then make arrangements with them. Assuming you are staying at a 5 star establishment the concierge service should be able to assist with that. \n\nFor driving if you have so much luggage that it is a concern for traveling on a train then keep in mind the size of vehicle you would be renting. Make sure all of your luggage would physically fit inside the vehicle. Some of those cars are tiny.",

ETC makes it easier to just keep driving without stopping and only paying for the exits you take and not the full length of the highways (tokyo). also there are HUGE rest stops on the main highway that you'll be on for a good 250KM out of the 350KM of your trip.. take advantage of them, it's like a minimall &amp; giant bathrooms &amp; food courts (if you see an \"ETC exit\" for the food/gas stops, that just means that IF you decides to leave the highway after the pit stop, then  you'll take a seperate road that leads to an ETC exit only to go to the off-highway road.. which doesn't apply to you, as you'll be getting back on the highway, no ETC exit needed.. so just dismiss that signage when you see it, when it comes to pit stops for gas and food.. also HAVE CASH, some of those gas stations don't take your card/visa/debti anything.. so stop at Lawsons/7-11 and have plenty of yen.. i usually carry about 30,000 on me at all times on vacation.\n\ntake care! i just came from Osaka last week (live in yokosuka) so our trip is pretty simular.",

Driving in Japan is a piece of piss, the speed limit on minor roads are so slow you basically crawl everywhere. All the signs are in English and are clear as day. The \"highway\" is a glorified duel carriageway and most drivers have little regard for the speed limit so its worth the cost if you want to make up some distance quickly. Parking is everywhere, you will never not be able to park within walking distance of your destination. The main benefit of a car is you can easily get to attractions that most tourists ignore because of location. You can drive into the mountains where no bus dares venture and go see the real Japan. \n\nDriving in Tokyo however can be a nightmare, the C1 and C2 roads are sometimes super confusing and its easy to take a wrong turn and end up driving 10km the wrong way. While the A-roads are busy, if you travel outside of rush-hour the traffic isn't too bad. You could get across the city in 1:30 or less. If youre going to mess around with Takkyubin I would just pay more for a bigger car where you can chuck your luggage in and be safe in the knowledge its always with you, as a tourist I would not fuck around with Takkyubin that much its gonna be hassle everytime you do it and something extra you have to keep planning again and again. Plus, if your plans suddenly change and you want to take a different route or someone recommends a nice village or shrine somewhere, you can just go there without worrying. If budget isn't an issue then the freedom of a car always outweighs travelling by train.",

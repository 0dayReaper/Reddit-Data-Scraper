            "comment": "If you're going to try and do Fushimi Inari and Nara in the same day, start very early. I feel strongly that Fushimi Inari is really worth budgeting 3-4 hours of time. Hike up to the top of the (small) mountain, explore all of the little shrine spaces up to the top. Fushimi Inari is a bit out of the way, so also use Google Maps to get a good sense of how long it will take you to get from where you're staying, to the shrine, then back to whatever station you will use to then travel to Nara, then back to Kyoto, then back to where you're staying. All of these little transits really add up, especially in Kyoto. I do think you can do both in the same day, but my advice would be to go to bed early the night before, then get up quite early to beat the crowds to Fushimi Inari.",

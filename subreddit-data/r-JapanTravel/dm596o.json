    "postText": "I was there for a month, I've been back for two weeks, I miss it.\n\n\nI've seen so many itineraries for review. They're all packed full of amazing activities and sights - so many things worth seeing.\n\n\nBut be sure to take some time and slow down and walk places. The public transportation is amazing and tempting to take - but if it is less than two miles away - walk to it. There are so many neighborhoods, nooks and crannies, and slices of life to be seen.\n\n\nWe saw a croquette league for seniors. We saw a group of children trying to catch butterflies with nets. We found an old supermarket that had neon sighs for each of its sections. We found hidden hiking trails and vending machines where you'd least expect them. We found stores that aren't on google maps. We stumbled upon a brewer\u2019s festival.\n\n\nThe highlights are great - but my best memories are of the little details that I stumbled on unexpectedly.\n\nEdit: welp, this got popular and my grammar was awful, so I'm just cleaning it up. Thank you for the gold - it is the first I've ever received, and it made my day.",

I have odd, flat-sort of feet that tend to pick up blisters easily if I walk more than half a mile. Then, miraculously, my girlfriend introduced me to proper hiking socks. She always bought hers from REI, but the important part is the principle of the cushion: typically you're looking for wool, and when you evert the sock, you find a carpet of small, soft loops all over the inner surface. (I have some very good ones that go by the brand name \"Smartwool.\")\n\nI certainly understand if you laugh at my obsession with hiking socks, but after discovering these things ten years ago I've become an avid hiker, both inside and outside cities, all over the world. I routinely take 5-mile weekend hikes, and I rarely if ever have even a hint of a blister.",

We thought we would end the day in Osaka and do more shopping but nope the shops, temples, and shrines took longer than we thought because we kept finding more stuff in town. But if that had failed we knew our plan was to go back to Shinsaibashi in Osaka and explore the shops.\n\nYou don't need everything planned but you should have a plan for everything. (aka, have some rough ideas in place instead of just being upset as you waste your vacation googling **WHAT** to go see and do instead of only **HOW** to get there)",

I also like having a flexible itinerary where it's more just a list of things that we could do so we can pick something that suits our mood on the day. Rather than meticulously planning a day outdoors that we have to do on Friday only to wake up to pouring rain.\n\nWhat I really don't like is when people's approach to accommodation is that they'll just wing it. Especially in Japan where in my experience stuff gets booked out really early. Trekking around an unfamiliar place with your bags searching for somewhere to sleep does not sound fun, or a good use of time. I'd rather pick the general areas I'm going to be in well in advance even if I plan nothing else I at least want a guaranteed bed at the end of the day.",

Be content in wherever you are rather than feeling like you have to seek something special out. \n\nThere\u2019s a damn good reason it\u2019s referred to as getting lost, because it\u2019s the idea of ignoring the obvious routes and directions and idea of going to a specific place. You don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going and there\u2019s a good chance it won\u2019t be obvious how to find your way back. And that\u2019s ok. \n\nI did this exact thing multiple times on my trip. One time in Sapporo it was especially relevant. Google and other Americanized transit maps and sites told me it wasn\u2019t possible to take public transportation in the direction I felt like going. So I found a map in Japanese that in turn brought me to a bus line that didn\u2019t have any English announcements. I don\u2019t speak or read Japanese. \n\nBut I used that opportunity to just go \u201cwherever the wind took me\u201d, got off the bus where it felt right, and then when I was done enjoying this random spot I navigated my way back to what I hoped was the correct stop for the bus and made my way back. \n\nIt\u2019s just about having an experience that doesn\u2019t feel set in stone. \n\nMaybe that doesn\u2019t work for everyone but it\u2019s a completely valid way to create an experience for yourself in a new place.",

I actually wanted to see the mundane.\n\nPro tip: Don't just wander *aimlessly* around, pick a random direction, find a konbini 10-20 minutes that way on google maps or whatever, use it as a checkpoint to grab a drink or snack, then choose another random direction/konbini. Repeat.\n\nThat way you both have a goal/rest stop and no goal at all. Best of both worlds.",

Maybe this is somewhat unique to Japan, but bars / izakayas / restaurants tend to be concentrated in certain areas of the cities, generally outside the major stations or in the business centers. Unless you're really in the middle of nowhere, \"meet me at XYZ Station and we'll find somewhere to go from there depending on our mood\" is *absolutely* a viable option",

And it was great, but I exhausted myself and was too tired to enjoy dinner or nightime.\n\nAfter that, I realised that it's not a sin to take a taxi or a bus. To have an hour in the hotel halfway through the day. My second week has been much more relaxed, and I find that with a better tempo comes a more mindful appreciation of what you're seeing.\n\nAlso, having walked tons in Kyoto, Osaka, Himeji, Kanazawa, Shinjuku, and now Takayama, I have to be honest - 95% of the walk between places is just boring urban environment that you could see anywhere, with a slight Japanese twist. Once you get used to that Japanese element, there's little interesting there anymore. You aren't going to be having conversations with people randomly on the street.\n\nAnd yes, especially in Kyoto, you'll stumble upon temples and shrines everywhere, but the truth is that the best ones really are the ones you'll find on the itineraries - that's why they're there.\n\nIf I could recommend one city that you walk around a ton, it would be Kyoto. And one that you use the transport - Tokyo.",

I hesitate to point this out on itinerary posts because for many people this may be something that they've waited years to do, probably won't get another chance to do for a few more years after that, and they want to hit all their big checklist items, which I totally understand. That said, when I was travelling to Japan some of my best memories are from \"off\" days where I just set out to go shopping or went out more or less aimlessly. Sometimes you turn a corner and see the most amazing things. Sometimes you just want to pass through some area on the way somewhere else but run into a festival or some other event that you didn't know about. Sometimes you get lost trying to change trains and end up finding the cutest caf\u00e9 or restaurant or club or little semiresidential district. Sometimes you're out for drinks and strike up a conversation and get invited to do x/y/z later that night or early next morning. And it's good to have a little bit of a buffer in your itinerary so you can take these chances when they present themselves. \n\nLater on I lived in Japan for a couple of years but I'd still find absolute gems in my own backyard. Japanese cities are big. And some of the most random spots I stumbled into by accident eventually became favorites that I would go back to for years. So yeah, I definitely think getting lost and having time to take opportunities is underappreciated. Chances are talking to that chatty barkeeper until closing and going to Karaoke with him and missing that one museum that was planned for tomorrow morning at 10:00 is going to make the trip much better. Or buying a towel at the conbini and joining that beach party that you didn't know was happening and missing the second temple of the day. And so on.",

One junk shop we found was loaded with American postwar memorabilia and old baseball cards etc. \n\nWe decided that when we go back we'll hire some bicycles next time so we can cover more ground while still having the freedom to turn up any interesting looking streets we find",

You can definitely squeeze those in for a day or two, but after a while there's nothing much to it.\n\nTo each their own, but if you're the \"tick-the-box\" tourist then by all means you can squeeze in the traditional Osaka-Kyoto-Tokyo circuit in a week, but I tell you one thing for sure, you'll be missing out a lot if you don't wander out.",

And cities in Japan are *full* of little gems, it's amazing! One of our hotels this year was in Sumida City district, Tokyo. Right across the street there was a little shrine/park nestled between two large buildings and proudly proclaimed its name in English as Dog Shit park. It was a hilarious but wonderful start to our two week trip to Japan. This isn't unusual, I think, because on our previous trip staying in Asakusa there was also a little shrine next door.\n\nSpeaking of, the trip when we stayed in Asakusa, I wandered around one evening and meandered past an open garage with a lift, 4 cars 2 wide by two tall, and saw some insane condition classic cars (Gen 2 Gtr, what I'm assuming is a replica of Speed Racers car, a mint condition old Mini, and something else.) Being a car guy, this tickled my fancy indeed, and I absolutely wouldn't have seen it had I taken a cab as it was on a smaller back alley off the main roads. \n\nEven still, walking gives you the chance to slow down and see these places, read about them, take a deep breath, step back from life, and be in the moment. You'll find the unexpected in the best of senses - cafes, cars, people, shops, gardens... That's one of the things I love about Japan. So many places and opportunities to stop and take the atmosphere in. Not even just small shrines, but parks, small gardens that are squeezed between modern buildings yet *meticulously* cared for. I've never seen another country take so much pride in the small things.\n\nFor reference, we walked 65 miles in 5 days in Tokyo the first time we were there. Since then, we always make it a point to walk as much as possible when there. And when I travel for work, I do the same thing in whatever city I happen to be in, provided it's not a sketchy location. It's always great to find the little things, but I haven't found cities in any other country that do the little things *this well.*",

I was on my way to a Pok\u00e9mon Store in Osaka when I passed by a park (saw it on my phone\u2019s maps) and thought it\u2019d be cool to peek in. To my surprise, there was a ramen festival going on that week, and I happened to stumble upon it on its last day! Worth all the extra time :-)\n\nAnother scenario was when I didn\u2019t really have an agenda while in Takayama. I roamed around, found a cute cafe, then a bike renting shop, and biked around town to a few shrines, mini rivers, and saw the sunset on the taller side of town. Near dinner time, I randomly asked our hotel\u2019s receptionist for a food recommendation, and she suggested going to the local family-owned sushi restaurant which was usually packed with locals. Per her instructions, I went 15 minutes before it opened and was able to grab the only walk-in seat. It was awesome.\n\nI can\u2019t say the same for other countries, since wandering around Bangkok, Thailand (am Thai) would definitely be 1) too hot 2) too crowded, but Japan...it\u2019s just so different.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to go for my second time and just spend a whole day wandering around with a camera.",

Did it again for Kiyo-Mitsudera temple to go back to our hostel, and walked ACTUAL residential areas, it was nice to see non-touristy areas too. \n\nOsaka as well, walked from Aquarium/Ferris wheel to Den-Den town and back up to the Market trying to get back to Shinbaishashi, and we tried to go to Shinsekai by foot because we were lost and my GPS was screwed up. great experiences.",

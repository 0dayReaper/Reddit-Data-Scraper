    "postText": "I stayed at four ryokans during my trip. They were all great and the expense was worth it. Each of them provided outstanding service in their own way and paid attention to details the others did not. This got longer than I expected so I will make it a four part series.\n\nThe first was Gora Kadan at Hakone. My suite was the Rindo. It was much bigger than the pictures suggested. There were two entrances for the suite because the suite actually comprises of two separate rooms.\n\nThe first room serves as public space. It contained a foyer/shoe closet, a full bath with shower and cypress tub, living/dining space, a sitting room, and sliding door to the deck and garden. The second room included a smaller foyer, full closet, half bath, giant vanity, bedroom, private onsen with attached shower, and also opens to the deck.\n\nThe highlight is the onsen enclosed within sliding glass doors that overlooks the garden. If soaking in the giant wooden tub of hot spring water wasn't relaxing enough, the view will do the trick.\n\nThere were no connecting doors between the two rooms so the options were to use the front entry doors or the deck in the back. I always chose the latter. It does get annoying at times but I understand their reasoning. For example, during dinner they refreshed and prepared the bedroom and I had absolutely no idea!\n\nThe kaiseki dinner was good as well as breakfast. I am not a foodie so my review of it won't carry much weight.\n\nA unique touch was a box of calligraphy tools including paper, envelope, brush, and ink. I can see how the garden could inspire one to write poetry.\n\nService is Gora's forte. My attendant was absolutely delightful. Not only did she cater to my every need with thoughtful precision, she identified gaps in my plans during casual conversation and had expertise to offer solutions. That's how I was able to rectify a shinkansen ticket issue without lifting a finger. Every staff I interacted with was as helpful as they were polite. I felt like a shogun walking around my castle.\n\nThe ryokan boasts many facilities unfortunately I did not get a chance to partake during my one night stay. The property is beautiful inside and out. It leans more modern than traditional so you won't get the full ryokan aesthetic. It's a short walk to the station or they can drive you to and from. The train tracks actually run just outside yet you barely notice it. In fact, I awoke to the sounds of birds chirping which was not like Tokyo the night before.\n\nGora Kadan fully deserves its five stars and it set a very high bar for the other ryokans after.\n\nEdit to add pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/MAyVU8m](https://imgur.com/a/MAyVU8m)\n\nPart 2 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/12v7pzd/ryokan_review_part_2_kagaya/).",

I never book for one night always two.",

My husband always makes fun of me not cleaning my plate \ud83d\ude05\n\nI am a bit scared of insulting my hosts at a ryokan by not finishing everything\u2026 i heard the food at some of the ryokan is very adventurous. Do you have any advice for me?",

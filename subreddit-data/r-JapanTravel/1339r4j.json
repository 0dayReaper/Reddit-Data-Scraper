But I also sometimes walk a stupid amount.\n\nVisually, Akihabara is amazing after the sun goes down. But most stores close at 8:00, so if you want to explore the shops, you'll want to be there with enough time to explore.",

Get there early 9am-ish or you have no slots or it\u2019s a 2pm slot.\n\nThe number of times I\u2019ve seen tourists turned away when I\u2019m happily eating inside is quite high",

Good luck tho \u2026. My legs hurt just thinking about all the station stairs! Disney Sea is a big day \u2026 especially from Asakusa !",

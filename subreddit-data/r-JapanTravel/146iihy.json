    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've spent a **ton** of time planning out my itinerary to Japan - reading through dozens of trip reports, articles, watching tons of social media videos, and more. I've really enjoyed doing so, but now I'd love to run my itinerary through you all to see if I'm missing anything amazing / I've packed too much together / etc!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NOTE:** Our top priorities are around: food, culture, interactive attractions, and really cool sights to see.\n\n**NOTE 2:** I know that a LOT of suggestions on here mention that you shouldn't plan things so tightly, and let yourself explore. We won't hold to this schedule too strictly, but I personally love to have a day outline so that we can fit in as much as possible. We love to move, and see as much as we can. This is our honeymoon and being active and seeing / exploring is our main goal!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much in advance for reading this!

For example, going to Kiyomizu-dera, you will either have to walk, take a bus or a taxi from Kyoto station. And you will need to reach Shin-Osaka station first, so in total, it will take more than 15 minutes, much more.\n\nNot using the shinkansen, you could get much closer to Kiyomizu-dera, like at Kiyomizu-gojo station. As for price, ... yeah, it's \"just\" 1450 yen fon non-reserved ticket, but you can do Osaka to Kyoto for 430 yen using Keihan (from Yodoyabashi station to Kiyomizu-gojo).",

Go to Meiji Jingu first, then Harajuku/Takeshita, then Yoyogi (just a recommendation, a park after a park seems like too much but also chill if you decide to do that). Are you staying near Ginza? Lunch at Esquisse seems quite out of the way if you\u2019re going to spend the day near Meiji Jingu/Harajuku/Shibuya. \n\nThe Don Quijote in Shibuya is better than the Shinjuku one. \n\n\nDay 13\n\nGoing from the lunch place, to Ueno, back down to TeamLabs is kind of not good. You need time to enjoy lunch and then going up to Ueno back down to TeamLabs (it\u2019s kind of far away). You most likely won\u2019t have time to enjoy Ueno park unless you rush lunch. I\u2019d probably just visit Ueno some other time but definitely not before TeamLabs.",

I wouldn\u2019t say to skip it, but if you\u2019re strapped for time and aren\u2019t into that stuff then it\u2019s probably not worth it.

If you\u2019re not sure, maybe you can make an alternative itinerary? A non-temple place I recommend is Kyoto station at night. \n\nFor day 9, I recommend adding Philosophers Path. Eikando and Heian are nice too. \n\nGion would place better in day 5, it\u2019s the same neighbourhood.\n\nAlso want to point out you have Ninenzaka/Nineizaka on the itinerary twice. (Unless you mean to go twice)\n\nFor food in Kyoto I recommend tofu cuisine and obanzai. There\u2019s also vegan sushi at AWOMB. \n\nSensoji, Nakamise, Kappabashi are all Asakusa. Ueno is 5 minutes by train from Asakusa so it doesn\u2019t make sense to put Odaiba in between. On Odaiba I recommend the Seaside Park, they also have a giant Gundam if you\u2019re interested in that. \n\nThe Yokohama Ramen Museum I don\u2019t think you can book in advance. Go there earlier because if they\u2019re busy they\u2019ll end ticket sales for the day. I liked the custom cup noodle activity, they also have a cool food court that sells all sorts of noodles.",

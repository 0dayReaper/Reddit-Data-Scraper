    "postText": "I just got back from a 3+ week trip from Japan and wanted to provide some quick reviews and thoughts on my experience. I heard being vegan in Japan was tough so I was a little bit nervous before my trip but I'm happy to say that it was not difficult at all (granted you're in the popular, touristy areas). I generally stuck around Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo. \n\nI pretty much used the HappyCow app 99% of the time and then cross referenced the hours on Google Maps since HappyCow may be out of date. Even Google Maps would ask if the hours are correct at fairly popular places. Sometimes I would just punch in \"vegan\" in Google Maps to see if there were any new results to add to HappyCow. I didn't find any on Google Maps :( but I found a cafe and my hostel both had vegan options from a menu written on a blackboard so keep an eye out for written options. \n\nRandom tips/thoughts:\n\n- ANA's in flight vegan options were pretty good. \n\n- If you have a late flight at Haneda, make sure to pick up something beforehand at the conbini before security as the food options past security will close.\n\n- Pick up some onigiri if you're heading to a HappyCow deserted area or just for a snack to have on hand. Between 7-Eleven and FamilyMart I think there were 4+ different kinds of vegan onigiri. On one exhausting day I had 3 for dinner. \n\n- I found a few chips and snacks at 7-Eleven but I got tired of Google Translating all the food. \n\n- In general I was very happy with all my meals. Vegan options rarely disappointed. \n\n- Food was very affordable at around $8-$20 a meal. That said it was sometimes counterproductive and I'd order more since I knew food was affordable. It's a vacation after all. \n\n- I did little planning. Before I left for my destination, I would check for options and hope for the best. At worst, some destinations would leave me with 1 option or a 15 minute walk to the closest option but YMMV. \n\n- In a couple of fail/lazy scenarios I would eat at the closest Coco Ichibanya. It's actually pretty good. \n\n- I started eating on the earlier or later side because touristy vegan restaurants would fill up fast. E.g. Kyoto Engine Ramen would have massive line of almost all tourists for its vegan and gluten free options. Go early. \n\n\nStandout options:\n\n- Tokyo - 2foods Shibuya Loft - All vegan restaurant. Went twice and got the butter chicken and omurice and would recommend both.\n \n- Tokyo - KOMEDA Is - All vegan restaurant. Also went twice and got the fried tofo, pasta, and burger. Looot of options. \n\n- Tokyo - Ain Soph Soar Ikebukuro - All vegan restaurant. Looks like there are three other locations but I was only able to visit this one but I really wish I went another time. Delicious mac and cheese and chili cheese burger. \n\n- Tokyo - Korinbo - Vegan/vegetarian restaurant run by one lady that serves one set menu for 1100 yen. Food was not something to write home about but her restaurant is incredibly homey. It felt like I was invited into a Taiwanese home and it made me quite nostalgic. Good option if you're shopping in Nakano Broadway. \n\n- Tokyo - T's Tantan - Vegan ramen restaurant. The one by Ueno park is suuuuper confusing to get to but will be worth it if you're in the area as there aren't too many options. Make sure to get the ramen with the peanut butter and sesame in it as the Yuzu ramen wasn't good in my opinion. \n\n- Tokyo - Ikea Shinjuku - I can't believe how many delicious vegan options there were. I went there once for dinner and would've gone again. Make sure to pick up a 50 yen ice cream like many others.\n \n- Osaka - Falafel Sababa - Small middle eastern restaurant. I came twice and met two of the people running the place and both were really friendly. Honestly had the best falafel platter I've had. Also has a HappyCow logoon their wall. \n\n- Osaka - Saijiki - Vegan dim sum. Great option if you haven't had dim sum in awhile as a vegan. \n\n- Kyoto - Whitely Kyoto - Vegan cafe. Good pasta, burger, and atmosphere. \n\nThe meh:\n\n- Tokyo - Vegan Ramen UZU (Teamlabs) - Interesting experience eating in. You eat in a dark room with a flashlight pointed over your ramen. The room is essentially an art piece. I thought the ramen itself was just okay. Decent option if you're doing Teamlabs but I would not go out of your way for it. \n\n- Tokyo - Soranoiro Nippon - I believe the only vegan option in Tokyo station's ramen street. It just tasted greasy as another reviewer pointed out.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention\n- Yokohama - Ramen Museum. Has two vegan options! And the downstairs town recreation is stunning. Make sure to bring enough cash as it's cash only via a kiosk. I had to leave and go to an ATM.",

I realized after I ordered it that it was basically there to be their allergy friendly AND strict buddhist vegetarian friendly option, and it didn\u2019t taste bad but it was bland and boring. Of the tantanmen options I liked the golden sesame the best.",

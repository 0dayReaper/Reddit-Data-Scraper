Also I would like to know the best way to fill the blank spaces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Date|Location|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|23.09.23|Tokyo|Arrival at Haneda Airport|Sensoji Temple|Explore Shinjuku &amp; spend time at Kabukicho Tower|\n|24.09.23|Tokyo||Kokugikan Sumo grand tournament|Sanrio Cafe Ikebukuro &amp; Fukuru Matsuri Ikebukuro|\n|25.09.23|Tokyo|Tokyo Sea Life Patk|TeamLab Planets||\n|26.09.23|Tokyo|Tokyo DisneySea|Tokyo DisneySea||\n|27.09.23|Tokyo|Explore Harajuku and Shibuya|Gotokuji Temple|Shopping at Ginza|\n|28.09.23|Hakone|Arrive to Mishima Station, rent a car, Mishima Skywalk|Hakone-jinja Shrine, Owakudani Valley|Check in hotel at Gotenba|\n|29.09.23|Fuji|Hike mt.fuji?||Hana no Miyako Park?|\n|30.09.23|Kyoto|Return the car at Mishima Station, take Shinkansen to Kyoto|Check in hotel|Night Walking Tour|\n|01.10.23|Kyoto||Nishiki Market||\n|02.10.23|Kyoto|Explore Uji|Explore Fushimi Inari||\n|03.10.23|Kyoto|Arashiyama Monkey Park|Explore Arashiyama||\n|04.10.23|Yokohama|Take the Shinkansen to Yokohama|Minato Mirai|ChinaTown|\n|05.10.23|Yokohama|Check out hotel &amp; go to Enoshima Aquarium|Explore Enoshima &amp; Take the train to Narita Station|Stay at the hotel in Narita|\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Does anyone know the time the Mikoshi festival in Ikebukuro on 24.09.23  will start?\n2. Can  you recommend any places to spend the evening near Tokyo Station?\n3. I understand that climbing on Fuji off season is prohibited and dangerous, so we won't try to reach the summit. I just wanted to know if going to the 5th station in 30.09 is Okay. I also read that you can Hike to Hoei Crater (which is near 6th station) on Fuji this time of year. Is hiking to Hoei Crater safe and doable? If not, are there any good hiking trails nearby?\n4. Is Nishiki Market in Kyoto open on Sundays? What else can we do on a Sunday in kyoto?\n5. Where can we spend the evening in Kyoto?\n6. Is a day trip to Enoshima from Yokohama doable? Is Enoshima Aquarium fun? If not, what else we can do in Yokohama?\n7. Can you recommend any affordable Matcha or Sushi workshops? We are both students so nothing fancy...\n8. Can you recommend on Pork-free Ramen and Gyoza? We do not eat Pork but would love to try.\n\nThank you for your help!",

            "comment": "If you love aquariums, the one in Osaka is famous. Osaka is very close to Kyoto so maybe that's what you do with the Nishiki Market day.\n\nYou can day trip to Enoshima from Yokohama easily. You even could have time to see some sights in Kamakura the same day, if you get up early.  \n\nHow early is your flight from Narita? I would consider going there straight from Yokohama in the morning instead of changing hotels. There are trains and limo buses.  \n\nEnjoy your trip!",

    "postText": "Hi all! Finalizing an 11 day trip to Japan and we are getting close, just a few weeks out!! I am going with my husband. I have my itinerary below but I also have a few questions:\n\n* Do I need to have JR train reservations in advance if I have a JR pass? Or do I just show up day of and hop on the train and show my pass? \n* Is the ***Ashikaga Flower Park*** worth it? We will be there during Wisteria season and I'd love to get to see them, but it is a 1.5 hour train ride from where we are staying in Shinjuku. I'd love to hear from people who have been there to know if it's worth the trek, in addition to the other treks we will be doing.\n* Is there anything that looks like we are missing that we *must* see, especially in Osaka? We only have one day trip there and I'd like to make the most of it :) \n* I have tickets to the major museums, our JR pass voucher, will be getting yen from my bank, got our stuff approved from Visit Japan website... is there anything else I am missing?\n* Lastly, we'd love to make it to the Cat shrine Gotokuji temple but not sure where to fit it in, or if there is other stuff out that way we could also try to see. \n\nItinerary is below if y'all are interested in reviewing and sharing your thoughts!

Additionally, when you reserve, add time to go to the station and print out your reservation tickets (not sure this is absolutely necessary, but the one time my dad didn't, it kept that trip in his account as a reservation and you're only allowed to make up to 6 reservations at a time)",

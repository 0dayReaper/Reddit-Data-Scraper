    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am having a hard time to decide where to go for my 7 days (short) trip to Kansai area during summer this year. Preliminary I came back with this plan:\n\n**20 July**\n\n* Reach Osaka in the evening. Check-in (stay in Osaka)\n\n**21 July**\n\n* Travel to Nara in the morning.\n* Explore Nara Park and feed deers.\n* Visit Todaiji Temple. Explore Naramachi and Gangoji\n* Stay overnight in Nara.\n\n**22 July**\n\n* Travel to Kyoto in the morning.\n* Hiking from Kibune to Kurama, and visit Kurama Temple.\n* Experience Nagashi Somen in Kibune\n* Stay overnight in Kibune (considering staying in a ryokan in Kibune?)\n\n**23 July**\n\n* Climb Fushimi Inari (visited before but didn\u2019t manage to climb to the top)\n* Afternoon: (some less known areas of kyoto?)\n* Attend the Gion Summer Festival in Kyoto in the evening\n* Stay overnight in Kyoto (downtown area?)\n\n**24 July**\n\n* Watch the Summer Festival float procession in the morning\n* Travel to Koyasan\n* Explore Koyasan, visit Okunoin Cemetery\n* Stay overnight in Koyasan (temple stay)\n\n**25 July**\n\n* Travel back to Osaka.\n* Activities: Osaka Castle, Dotonbori.\n* Stay overnight in Osaka.\n\n**26 July**: Depart from Osaka.\n\nSome background: I will be traveling solo (male) and it will be my second time visiting Japan. During my previous trip, I explored Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Tokyo. This time, I am looking for less-known areas/unique places to include in my itinerary. I am keen to attend the Gion Summer Festival in Kyoto since it falls within my travel period (but not sure of anything to take note?)\n\nInitially, I considered staying in a single location and traveling out from there, but I ultimately decided to travel and switch accommodations along the way to have a different range of experiences.\n\nI also considered these places, but due to time constraints, I had to omit them in this plan: Mt. Yoshino (not the best season to visit?), Kinosaki Onsen (out of the way), Ine boathouses (unable to fit in), Uji (considering after Nara since it's along the way.\n\nAny feedback or suggestions are welcome!",

Kyoto to Koyasan is a long journey, so after leaving at noon - you will be there late afternoon.. at best you have few hours of daylight. \n\nRecommendation is to focus on areas you want to explore - maybe skip Kibune, and add another night elsewhere.\n\nAlso, by checking out every day, you have to take your luggage with you each time, unless you store in locker or leave at hotel prior exploring p.",

Although I wouldn't mind going to other places in Kyoto too\n\nInitially wanted to go Koyasan then Nara, but i found out that they are not connected directly and I still had to travel via Osaka",

            "comment": "Hello, I\u2019m Japanese, and know Kyoto and Osaka well. Here are my suggestions:\n\n1. On July 21, go straight down to Nara, and fully enjoy the city. Nara has a lot to offer if you look into the city. You can put Uji on July 23.\n\n2. Kibune is a really beautiful place. It\u2019s much less crowded and more quiet. And it\u2019s cooler than the central part of Kyoto. Yes, you have got the right thing to do, which I mean is yuka dining as you have mentioned you would want to try nagashi somen. This is part of unique culture in Kyoto.\n\n3. You can visit Uji after you go to Fushimi Inari. There are some matcha places near Uji Byodoin, and my recommendation is Ito Kyuemon. I always grab some sweets from them every time I go back to Japan. Their restaurant also serves cold matcha soba. That\u2019s refreshing in a hot summer day. \n\n4. In terms of Gion Festival, be prepared. It\u2019s extremely busy, and streets are packed with tons of people. I hope you have booked your accommodation in Kyoto by now. You may want to book a restaurant asap if there\u2019s any place you want to try. Kyoto city also does yuka dining. You can have dinner outside looking at the Kamogawa River.\n\n5. Be prepared for the summer in Kyoto. It\u2019s hotter than anywhere else of its surrounding areas. You may find a bit cooler when you go to Nara and Osaka. Believe me. It\u2019s pretty bad. As someone who lived in Kyoto for 3 years, summer there was always hell. I lost appetite and weight every summer.\n\n6. If you need any recommendations for food in Osaka, let me know.\n\nEnjoy the trip!",

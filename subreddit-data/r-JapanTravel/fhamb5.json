PLEASE READ THE LINK ABOVE, OR OUR SUMMARY BELOW:**\n\n&gt;**\"The Cabinet on Tuesday approved a bill that would enable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency, if needed, as Japan scrambles to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Abe, who faced criticism for being too relaxed in his initial response to the outbreak, has sought the power to prepare for a \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d**\n\n&gt;**\"Moreover, the prime minister has extended a government request to event organizers nationwide to refrain from holding such gatherings by about 10 days. The request was initially until March 19.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"The legal change would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency lasting up to two years if coronavirus infections spread rapidly across the country and fears are raised of a grave impact on people\u2019s lives and the economy.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"Once an emergency is declared, prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for schools to close and events to be canceled.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"Local governments can also demand that essential supplies such as medicine and food be sold to them. They can temporarily take over private land and facilities to provide medical care.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"Abe has already requested that schools across the nation close and big sports and cultural events be canceled or postponed. But under the current law, the government does not have the legal power to enforce school closures or event cancellations.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and the Democratic Party for the People say the prime minister should seek prior parliamentary approval before any declaration of a state of emergency.\"**\n\n**Once again, *this bill does not enact a State of Emergency for the country*, it merely means to reflect and strengthen the laws put in place from previous viral outbreaks in Japan.**\n\n**Also of note is the [recommendation by a panel of experts to continue closures for another 10 days beyond what has already been noted](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/29c7cf7a3604-urgent-abe-extends-request-for-event-cancellations-amid-virus-spread.html) in the comments. We will be updating the closures thread as necessary as companies extend the break.**\n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 03/08**\n\n**Border control increase begins today in Japan.** [**NHK has an article on the general guidelines for border control at this time.**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200309_01/)  \n\n**We have reprinted the article in full below.**  \n\n&gt;Japan increased border control measures on Monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\n&gt;**The government is asking people arriving from China and South Korea, including Japanese nationals, to stay at home or other private accommodation for two weeks at their own expense.**\n\n&gt;**Officials are asking those travelers to refrain from using public transportation, including planes, trains, buses and taxis, and use private or rental cars from the airport of their entry to their homes or accommodation facilities.**\n\n&gt;Visitors are asked to declare to quarantine officials where they will stay during the first two weeks as well as their means of transportation from the airport. They will be asked to remain at the airport until arrangements are ready.\n\n&gt;During the two-week period they will be asked to check their health daily. If they develop a fever and other symptoms they are asked to call a consultation center and visit a designated hospital.\n\n&gt;The measures are expected to remain in effect until the end of this month. **They are not legally-binding, but the health ministry is asking for cooperation.**\n\n**Once again, we would advise if you have a stopover in any of the affected countries (China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau - named specifically.) that you contact your airline to change your flight as soon as possible. These measures will be in force until the end of this month at the very least.**\n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 03/06**\n\n&gt;[**\"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: \"We will ask people entering Japan from the two countries to stay at places designated by the quarantine chief for two weeks and not to use public transportation systems in the country.\"**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200306_02/)\n\n&gt;**A more in depth explanation of the restrictions is explained** [**here.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/05/national/japan-quarantine-arrivals-china-south-korea/#.XmHjSyhKiUk) \n\n&gt;**This appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus.** [**The NHK has posted an article on the other measures of the bill,**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200305_50/) **and how it will allow the Government to enact a State Of Emergency - giving them the power to \"control some businesses' operating hours, close schools and instruct people to stay indoors. Authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners' consent for medical purposes.\"**  \n\n**In short, if you are a Korean or Chinese National, you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine. Any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either Narita or Kansai Airport, starting March 9th, and lasting until March 31st. It will also include visitors from Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Japanese Nationals coming from these countries - we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas. Entry Visas are being cancelled, for China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border, and could be sent home after the 14 days are up.**\n\n**If you have a flight with a stopover in either country, you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct, or re-route through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine. We have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded OR included in this requirement, but it's better to be safe than sorry.**\n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/28**  \n\n&gt;[**The Japanese Government has rolled out requirements to help curb the spread of the virus, as the next two weeks are crucial for transmission within the country.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/25/national/science-health/japan-guidelines-covid19-coronavirus/#.XlaKGChKiUk)  \n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/04:**\n\n**The JNTO (Japan National Tourism Organization) is advising any and all tourists arriving in Japan to have travel health insurance in case they require treatment or hospitalization as a result of contracting the virus. The Government of Japan *will NOT cover the costs* associated with treatment during this time, and you *will* be required to pay out of pocket should an infection occur, and you have no insurance.**  \n\n[**More information can be found at the following link from the JNTO, along with links to companies that will provide travel health insurance IN Japan on arrival.**](https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/)  \n\n**We strongly recommend you add Trip Cancellation *and* Travel Health Insurance to your budget before you depart - for precisely this kind of occurrence.

We would not recommend contacting this number if you are not currently in the country, as this line is intended to assist with possible cases and have them directed to medical facilities for treatment.** [The article has been removed, but we have a link to the phone numbers here.](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200131_41/amp.html) There is also a link to the JNTO for further information, if needed.\n\n&gt;**\"The Japan National Tourism Organization is offering phone consultation services for foreign tourists who are concerned about the new strain of coronavirus.\"**\n\n&gt;\"The Japan Visitor Hotline offers 24-hour services in Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean.\"\n\n&gt;**\"The hotline can refer callers who may be infected with the virus to the nearest medical institution.** It also provides information on measures to prevent infection such as hand washing and gargling.\"\n\n&gt;\"The organization encourages foreign tourists to call if they have any concerns.\"\n\n&gt;**\"The hotline number is 050-3816-2787.**\"  \n\n**Calling from Overseas?

It\u2019s 5 PM here in Japan, and I landed less than 2 hours ago! I\u2019m on the Skyliner to Tokyo and just want to say if you\u2019re on the fence about going, evaluate your situation and try to stay away from all the crazy media sources/headlines. I\u2019ll try to walk you all through my thought process, but please remember I\u2019m making this decision for myself and while you may disagree, it\u2019s too late because I\u2019m already here LOL\n\nMy boyfriend and I are both 22, and from the kingdom of science. We have been religiously washing our hands for 20-30 seconds, hand sanitizing, baby wiping our face (because travel makes you icky), and disinfecting our phones and hydroflasks and whatever else we can regularly. I know masks are more for people who are sick, but I brought some to Japan to prevent me from touching my face. During the flight from SF to NRT (which was like 75% full), maybe like 50% of people were wearing masks? I wasn\u2019t one of them, HOWEVER when we landed and went through customs, EVERYONE had them on. This panicked me, so my boyfriend and I decided to put ours on. \n\nUltimately, we decided to go because we have no better time to than now. I\u2019m starting grad school in August and my boyfriend will be flying around for his own grad school interviews soon. We\u2019ve been actively monitoring COVID-19, and just recently saw how it accelerated in the US. Because of this, we kinda joked around and thought, If we even get COVID19, we might as well in Japan. Our family also trusted us and said they knew we\u2019d make a well informed decision (I think they\u2019re right and we did!) Additionally, we are confident in our ability to quarantine if necessary. Schools in California are slowly switching to online so that really reassured me since I have a class to finish before grad school. And we said bye to our families before leaving with a 2 week possible quarantine in mind. \n\nLastly, and most importantly, we knew we would still have a blast in Japan. If you think you won\u2019t have a good time and you\u2019ll be worried, just postpone. If you were like the old me, on the fence about cancelling and reading this thread religiously, STOP!!! Make your own informed decisions, and try not to indulge this thread too much because I feel like people like me are rare (the non cancellers). \n\nI\u2019m going to be here from 3/12-3/23 so let me know if you have questions. I\u2019m so excited and hope that if you guys go, you will be too!",

Japan will be there after all this is over, and it's better to rebook to reschedule if you can. \n\nI understand that not everyone would recover booking fees if they cancelled and for others it's a once in a lifetime experience to go - and that's where the sliver of grey area lies. It's hard to tell people \"too bad, you'll lose your money, you should have thought of this before\" because very few of us saw this coming when we booked flights and started planning.  \n\nI think the ultimate responsibility lies in your risk to others on return, and how you can cope with the fallout. If you can take the time off, isolate, and don't pose a risk to yourself I think you can take your trip without letting it weigh too heavily on your mind. But if you are putting everything at risk to go, take the hit and don't.",

My reasons: One parent with pre-existing conditions and colleagues with kids...\n\nI personally think it's a little bit selfish and irresponsible. It's officially a pandemic now and I guess every one has a civic duty to try to prevent it from spreading even more.\n\nIt doe not only concern yourself. The chance to be an asymptotic carrier is low but it is possible. It can not only potentially affect your loved ones back in your home country but also people in Japan. As I already mentioned in another comment here, tourists cover far more ground than the average common Japanese citizen. \n\nI live in Germany where the number of cases exploded over a few days. I try to keep my distance, to not go to crowded places, limit my exposure. I usually commute by public transportation, I will begin using my car from next week. Will not go to the gym and so on.\n\nOf course, it's easy to say cancel your long awaited dream trip. It isn't easy to do so, especially if it involves losing money. Lots of it. But in the end, it's just a vacation and Japan will be there. If you somehow can manage to reschedule with manageable losses, then please. Just think about it.",

After much thinking, in which I consulted my best friend, some of my coworkers, and my mom, I decided to cancel the entire thing. My mom put it this way in that I would not really be enjoying the trip because I would have been constantly worried about the whole epidemic and any potential repercussions. She also pointed out that Japan would always be there, and if I wouldn't be able to get a refund, money comes and goes but health doesn't. My friend also put it in terms of if I go despite the warnings, in the worst case that I got infected, would I be able to look at him in the eye that I was irresponsible for going on ahead and am now risking the health of others? He said just as there is a chance that I would not be infected and come back safe and sound, there is the other side, and I would have no way in knowing the outcome. That if I was justifying the trip despite warnings, then ultimately it was my pride and a personal tantrum that were pushing me.    \n\nI know it sucks having to cancel something you have been looking forward to but what I would do is make a list and write things down in separate pros and cons. If the cons outweigh the pros, then don't go. Talk to your family or friend and don't go in with an agenda/bias about the whole planning and costs, lay down the facts and try to express your real worries and concerns and have the person be as honest as possible. After that, make your choice.  \n\nThat is ultimately what I did, and I went ahead and cancelled everything. I was fortunate enough to get refunds from everything, but after weeks of being conflicted, I felt a huge burden off my shoulders after making my choice.",

I just came back to the states this afternoon from a 9-day trip with 3 friends, 2 of them flew out from and back to Egypt and 1 Canada. We\u2019re all healthy early 20s males. \n\nWe\u2019ve been planning this for almost 9 months now so it would\u2019ve taken a flat out travel ban to stop us, as selfish and irresponsible as it may sound, but we all had plans to seriously self quarantine when shit started getting hot last month. \n\nThe outbound flights for all of us was smooth as a butter. The Canadian and myself had an entire row in our international flights, the Egyptians stopped at Dubai first and the Dubai-Tokyo flight was rather crowded (tourists mostly)\n\nArrival;\nNarita wasn\u2019t busy at all but also not a ghost airport (I kinda expected that lol) and I, coming from the developing hot spot at the time Seattle, was the only one who got his body temperature measured (just standing in front of a camera like device for 2 seconds) \n\nTokyo-4 days\nAs a lot of people keep mentioning here, you notice the vast difference in the mask wearing culture from the US, the vast majority there are wearing one at all times. We had our own masks and we just followed through. We had researched all the closures well so we know what we we\u2019re gonna do/where we\u2019re gonna go and that really helped save time (9 days only in Japan is a crime but oh well that\u2019s all we got). I won\u2019t go into itinerary details but if you wanna chat about dm me. In short our Tokyo stay was about trying as much ramen and food stores as possible, day trip to Fuji on the best weather day, visiting a couple of shrines and areas like Akihabara, Ginza, Ueno and Golden Gai. \nAll restaurants we had researched were up and running and those that we were supposed to have long wait times never extended 30 minutes. Subways were not too crowded but not too empty either even during rush hour. Overall it felt like people knew what was going on in the world but not too stressed about it, in a sense that they took precautions like face masks and sanitizers everywhere and just went ahead with their usual day. Tourists were abundant in/around popular restaurants and areas.\n\nKyoto and Osaka-4 days \nEverything was just like Tokyo, expect that the mask wearing was less abundant. Again feel free to dm me to chat about the itinerary. \n\nFinal day and flights back;\nNarita departures was super relaxed, none of us waited in security we just jumped right in. No questions asked at border control except if you\u2019ve been to China last couple of weeks (none of us did). My Seattle flight was half empty and departed on time, same goes to the Dubai bound fellas, however the Canadian friend had a 3 hour delay (aircraft maintenance) and the flight was almost full. When I arrived at Seattle and put my mask on as I walked off the aircraft, I immediately noticed the stigma surrounding face masks here as the majority of passerbys gave me different kind of looks (not that I care though). I was asked when, why and with whom I travelled to japan and how long I stayed and if I was feeling any sort of sickness. The officer then asked how far ago was this trip planned and when I said 9 months he remarked \u201chmm and so you decided to go anyway\u201d I just nodded and half ass smiled. Cue to Seattle domestic terminal, crowded af, super rare face masks, I legit felt most at risk in those couple of hours than the whole trip in Japan. Flew back to Phoenix and that\u2019s it. My friends are supposedly on their second flights still, the Canadian said Chicago\u2019s airport was a shit show so I\u2019ll check on him later. \n\nOverall, I was the initiator of this trip and kind of a leader so I was going through a really hard anxiety phase the couple weeks before our trip, checking COVID-19 related news almost every 5 minutes and having to fend off any acquaintance that knew of this trip and was bashing hard me and tryin to guilt trip me for not cancelling. It was a nightmare so I feel for all of you in this situation rn. Literally the only people who weren\u2019t pressuring me where my travel mates (ily guys I swear). Every major news headline had me second guessing myself so a week before the trip we had a brief meetup and decided that only a travel ban would stop us and we ain\u2019t checking the news anymore (lol like I was gonna do that,  I obviously did all the time)\nIn the end though I feel like we prevailed, provided that hopefully we all pass our self quarantine period and turn out alright, and if we don\u2019t then it a risk we all knew we were taking. We had the time of our lives and if this is what a ghost japan looks like then I would seriously reconsider going again in peak season in normal times (I\u2019m allergic to traffic and crowded places). We checked the news only once a day briefly and decided to make the most out of our time and that really helped lighten the mood and induce good vibes. I\u2019m going through post vacay depression rn. Thankfully I got my instant ramen to help me go through this. \n\nStay safe everyone and good luck on deciding what\u2019s best for you and your travel companions! Feel free to ask or dm me as well",

Not because of the coronavirus itself... we felt like the situation in Japan is safer than here in the US at this point, and both of us are capable of self-quarantining and working from home immediately on returning.\n\nBut it's just too much unknown risk with the US now announcing that all travelers returning from areas deemed high risk must arrive through one of 13 airports, none of which are near where we need to get back to, and the increasing possibility of ended up quarantined or stranded overseas for an undetermined amount of time. Japan appears stable and hasn't been classified as a high-risk area yet, but a lot can change in 3 weeks... just look at how fast things changed in Europe.\n\nOn top of that, I just felt like I wouldn't be able to properly relax and enjoy the trip with all of the added stress and worry that this situation is causing. \n\nDoesn't change the fact that this situation really sucks. I'm out a lot of money that I may not get back, I worked unpaid overtime for a month to be able to make this trip possible, and due to life circumstances there won't be another chance to travel for at least a year.\n\nJust trying to focus on the big picture right now. We're not sick, out of a job, or worrying about how to pay our bills at the end of the month like so many other people. Japan will still be there someday in the future. Maybe we can try again some other year. The responsible thing to do right now is avoid unnecessary travel for the sake of other people's health and safety.\n\nTime to go drown my sorrows with cheap sake and green tea Kit-Kats.",

For travellers coming from the US, this may impact your travel insurance status -- either qualifying existing bookings for trip cancellation payment, or invalidating insurance on future bookings.\n\nIn the past few days, coronavirus containment measures have escalated rapidly in North America &amp; Europe. Personally, seeing how quickly other affected areas have gone from low risk to serious disruptions has made me pretty wary about the idea of travelling to Japan right now.",

By this logic, I would think they would cancel all international flights. \n\nOn hold with AC now to see if I can reschedule my flight.. can't wait to be on hold for 3+ hours....\n\nUgh sorry I just need to vent lol",

I'm not quite sure at this point, but it sounds like they put a blanket statement for the reason our flight in cancelled. Regardless, it is all rebooked and I feel much more relieved.\n\nThe agent also told me with regards to international flights returning that they will likely be re-routed to Toronto or worst case scenario Montreal if re-routing comes into play . I can't confirm that for sure, but it sounds like were not going to be stranded at some random airport when we come home which is good!\n\nI have to say the Air Canada agent I spoke to was incredibly helpful, kind and reassuring to this whole situation. Like he honestly sat on the phone with me for a hour reassuring me when he could've rebooked my flight in probably 10 minutes.\n\nOne thing I should mention is that I received NO warning with regards to any cancellations, so make sure if you have an upcoming flight to ensure you check the flight status on Air Canada's website (it will not tell you your flight is cancelled if you look up your reference number, just FYI). You have to go the the flight status tab and look up your flight from there.\n\nI hope this helps anyone still on the fence about their flights or is worried about cancellations.",

Admittedly, some of the questions are specific to my situation - to give context, I leave London on 20th March, land in Haneda Airport on 21st March and leave Japan on 4th April. Hopefully their response will be useful to some.\n\n**My Questions**\n\n1) If I entered Japan and CDC/UK Government issued a Level 3 on March 20th/21st (while I'm flying into the country - therefore I will not be able to receive news), will I still be able to purchase your insurance? Or would I be able to fly back even though I have not been insured?\n\n2) If the CDC/UK Government withdraws a Level 3, what would happen?\n\n3) If I get hospitalised with COVID-19 on/before April 4th (when we're leaving), would I still be insured after the leaving date?\n\n4) How does quarantine come into play - would I be covered for it? What if I have to be quarantined past April 4th - especially if this has been mandated by the UK?\n\n5) If I've been hospitalised for a reason that is not related to COVID-19, would I still be covered, even if it meant I had to stay beyond April 4th?\n\n6) How much do you cover for medical cost, and for quarantine? How much is a typical testing kit for COVID-19 in Japan?\n\n7) Does the insurance extend to my travel partner? What would happen if they are quarantined and we are separated - would my insurance account for this?\n\n8) Will insurance cover additional costs such as food, transport and accommodation if we end up being in a lockdown area/quarantine?\n\n**Their Response**\n\nPlease find the answer to your inquiry about the \"TOKIO OMOTENASHI POLICY\".\n\n\u25a0About Question 1\nOur [TOKIO OMOTENASHI POLICY] is an insurance that covers up to 10 million yen for the cost of injuries and illnesses treatment during the stay of foreigners visiting Japan and the cost of transportation to the home country.\n\nIn case you develop pneumonia related to new coronavirus and receive treatment by a doctor during your stay in Japan, the medical fees are covered by this insurance.\n\nBy principle, you can apply for this insurance after entering Japan.\nEven if there is a caution not to visit Japan after you enter the country, you can still apply for this insurance if you fulfil the application requirements.\n\nThe main requirements for application of this insurance are as below.\n\n\u25cfContractor\n\u30fbAt the time of application, has to be accessing within Japan or on a plane of Japanese airline company\n\u30fbHas to be an individual between 18 to 69 years old\u3000when applying\n\u30fbHas to be able to make an application via internet within Japan (The contractor has to have his/ her own and valid e-mail address)\n\n\u25cfInsured person (The person who will be covered by the insurance)\n\u30fbHas to be under 69 years old on the starting date\n\u30fbHas to have no injury or disease at the time of application\n\u30fbDoes not do \"dangerous activities\" while traveling\n\nRegarding the accident that happened before you made the payment of insurance fee, it is not covered by this insurance.\n\n\u25a0About Question 2\uff0cQuestion 3\nThe insurance period of this insurance is from the day after the application date or the day entering the country, whichever is later, to the day of departure procedures from Japan.\nHowever, this insurance covers accidents that occurred in the period between immigration procedures entering and leaving Japan.\n\nIn addition, if the arrival to the destination point is delayed due to the following reasons, the insurance period will be extended up to 72 hours.\n\u30fb The insured person (insurance target person) received treatment.\n\u30fb A traveler accompanying person (*) has been hospitalized\n\n(*)A traveler accompanying person is the person who has made a reservation for the same trip as the insured at the same time and accompanying the insured person.\n\nHowever, treatment costs after leaving Japan are not covered by this insurance.\n\n\u25a0 About question 4\nWith this insurance, if the arrival of the insured person to the destination is delayed due to restraint of government authority, the insurance period will be extended by that time that the insured person is released and able to return to the normal state of travel.\n\nWhether or not this is the case will be determined on a case-by-case basis, but it may apply if the UK government's quarantine obligations are based on UK laws.\n(Some cases do not apply, such as requests from the British government.)\n\n\u25a0 About question 5\nEven if the disease is not the type of the new coronavirus-related pneumonia, treatment costs for hospitalization for a disease that developed during your stay in Japan are covered by this insurance.\n\nAlso, as in Question 3, if the insured person is treated or if the accompanying person is hospitalized, the insurance period will be extended up to 72 hours.\n\n\u25a0 About question 6\nThe cost of treatment for illness or injury during your stay in Japan and the cost of transportation to your home country is covered up to 10 million yen.\nPlease note that our center does not know the cost of the test kits.\n\n\u25a0 About question 7\nExpenses for your travel partner are not covered by this insurance for the period that he/ she is isolated.\nSeparate applications for each person must be made when applying for this insurance.\n\n\u25a0 About question 8\nUnfortunately, this insurance does not cover any additional costs for meals, transportation, or accommodation due to quarantine or isolation.\n\n* Please note that in the event of an actual accident, the department in charge will ask you for details on the situation, etc., and you will be informed about the application of compensation and the applicable amount.",

It was EXTREMELY cold and damp and I wasn't prepared for it at all so we just walked inside Sunshine City and stayed inside a cafe. The mall started getting quite busy due to the snow. When it finally started to calm down, we made our way to Shibuya to Nabezo for dinner. It was filling up as we were enjoying our meal. The restaurant was about almost full by the time we finished our meal. We then walked around the mega Don Quixote in Shibuya. See quite a bit of tourists there and they were all looking for face masks. \n\nI have been contemplating about ending my trip early but at this point in time my flight back to Canada (which is a direct flight operated by AC) seems to be running, so I'm continuing to monitor the daily situation. I'll be working from home when I'm back anyways so the quarantine/ self isolation is fine by me.",

A lot of people are out and about, but compared to what i\u2019ve seen last year; then yes you can definitely notice the decreased number of tourists. I think all restaurants are still open; some are full, some aren\u2019t. Just a pretty chill day here in tokyo. We are very flexible with our itinerary. We just plan as we go.

We went to Harajuku and walked around in stores, got some yummy crepes, walked to Meiji Jingu shrine, found a yummy ramen place where a nice English speaking lady helped us (we had to order from a machine/put money in and get a ticket which had our order, then you give to staff, we are clueless). Later we walked around Shibuya at night, went to Nintendo store, PokeCenter. We walked 10 miles today total. \n\nWe are using JR rail passes/Yamanote line. It is our first time here so I cannot compare how full crowds are now vs. usually. It has been pretty busy so far, a lot of people out and about. Still people lined up to get into some restaurants. Maybe like 75% of people wearing masks. We are not. Still seeing tourists out as well. Getting around is really easy and most people we have needed to speak to have known enough English for us to communicate basic things. Or the shops have pictures to point to so there is no need to communicate. Been really impressed so far with their hospitality. We are going to Kyoto next week for 5 days. \n\nAlso, the lady at the JR East counter in the airport (where we exchanged our vouchers for passes) was really excited we were going to Kyoto. She said we will \"see the real Kyoto\" since it is less crowded.",

While I'm sure we could've found new things to do, it just didn't feel like it would be the trip we had planned and kind of ruined our spirits.\n* It didn't feel like the risk/reward for going at a time like this was really worth it, especially since there was the risk of getting a cancelled flight, getting quarantine, more things closing, and the possibility of getting covid-19 and spreading it to others.\n* We felt like it was our responsibility to help stop the spread and the best way to do that is to stay home.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCancelling the trip felt like a huge relief and after some time accepting/processing it, we're happy we chose to do it. We are currently in the process of canceling (or maybe postponing) our flights with Priceline (Singapore airlines) and have come to terms with the possibility of losing some money. \n\nThese events are definitely history in the making and it's something we don't wanna take lightly given the ever changing news. We will try to plan our trip for next year though and I'm excited for that!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBig thanks to /u/amyranthlovely for updating this thread and replying to so many comments.

With so many of the big event cancellations, people are losing their minds and buying god damn toilet paper (facepalm).  I am looking through the haze and not allowing myself to get too tied up in all these crazy news stories, but when it boils down to it...is the risk worth it? What is everyone's thoughts? We have no pre-existing conditions, elderly travelers, etc...I just want this experience to be incredible. From what I've read in this thread, once travelers get to Japan they seem to report everything is business as usual.",

We were set to go from April 9th to the 24th, but the recent bump to level 3 by the Canadian government, as well as the strong advisories and recommendations against non-essential travel have totally killed the hype for me. There comes a point where you sort of have to 'take the hint' from your government. Not to mention the tanking CDN dollar and the ongoing closures - ugh. I've been to Japan before, but as this trip was going to be with my girlfriend and it being her first time, I just couldn't help but feel that a large chunk of the 'magic' of the Japan experience would be lost, so we both agreed to pull the plug yesterday.\n\nIt only took a couple of hours to dismantle months and thousands of dollars worth of planning; I was actually pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to 'undo' everything. ANA's customer service was great - I was on hold for an hour with them, but the flights were instantly refunded without question. Same thing with Expedia, Veltra, Airbnb, TeamLab, and eConnect Pocket WiFi - full refunds all issued without a problem, either via a quick email or directly through the 'booking management' area on their respective websites. We hadn't yet purchased JR passes, so no worries there.\n\nStill waiting to hear on a non-refundable hotel booking from Agoda (\\~$400) - I called in and they requested a proof-of-cancellation from the airline (which ANA provided me), which they will forward on to the property. Fingers crossed!\n\nHoping to try again in November. I hear the colours are beautiful that time of year.",

But now with borders closing and such, I don't want to deal with the possible hassle. I'm sad about it, but I know in the long run it was the right choice to make.

You have to rebook and travel within 1 year of the *original ticketing date*. It seems their agents are currently able to offer the following additional remedies (probably only if your flights were cancelled by United, though): \n   * They can rebook you on later trips, and waive any increased fare as a result. They attempted to charge me more than double my original ticket cost but after complaining a bit they relented and adjusted the fare.\n   * They can extend the rebooking period by 3 months.\n\nFortunately we had trip insurance, so we're currently working on a claim with them to get back a non-refundable hotel.\n\nRebooked flights are Sep 11-27.

As much as I would love to get out of NYC, which is a strange, strange place right now, I can't help but feel the urge to lockdown and get through these challenging times in my own community. \n\nI have no concrete evidence to back this up, but with the way the infection/death rate has risen in the past few days, I think it is only a matter of time until the U.S. implements more sweeping restrictions on travel -- both internationally and domestically. I would urge other Americans still proceeding with international travel to prepare for situations similar to what travelers coming home from Europe have had to encounter in recent days. \n\nFor those mulling through this process, know that despite canceling a trip we've been planning/anticipating for months, it has been a huge sigh of relief for us. Worrying about traveling internationally was just another source of anxiety that we did not need to deal with given the current climate. \n\nMuch to my dismay, I've found the cancellation process surprisingly easy. AirBnB and our airline provider (ANA) is giving us full refunds. \n\nHoping to make our initial trip to Japan this Fall once this whole situation has (knock on wood) settled down.",

With what few days I have left I\u2019m going to try to enjoy. Good luck, take time to think things through, and don\u2019t be stupid. For everyone I hope you all make it safely back to wherever you want to go!\nPSA: let me be clear: I am not putting my loved ones in danger. I have already had this stuff planned out I will be driving by myself home to my apartment where my husband will have my stuff ready for me to seal myself off in the bedroom for two weeks while he stays in the rest of the apartment. I have already contacted my doctor and I will be contacting my state when I get back. If you have any other specific question about my quarantine please message me.",

I was absolutely devastated and spent a couple nights crying after cancelling of my Hakone ryokan and birthday kaiseki. I was sad whenever I saw the birthday dress I had brought to wear and seeing the beginnings of sakura blossoms, knowing I could not stay to admire their full blooms.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend finally got to see kansai (he absolutely loved Kyoto and hiroshima) and I got to relive my exchange student days with some old friends for a few nights of cheap izakaya. The refunds freed up a bit of money that I used to buy lots of quarantine food and snacks to try for the next two weeks, as well as lots of presents for my parents for putting them through this. Today was a national holiday weekend so there was free admission to Shinjuku Gyoen, which was to my surprise full of blooming trees! I almost cried. If any of you are still in Tokyo, go ASAP! \n\nMy parents are driving my boyfriend's car out to the airport tomorrow morning. I will keep my distance from them. My mum and aunties are super disappointed that they won't get her presents for two weeks. I filled up half a suitcase with just stuff they wanted! I'm not letting them touch my suitcases in case they're contaminated.\n\nThis trip was was a blast while it lasted and would do it again in a heartbeat. This was more than just a trip for me and I am so thankful that I made it back even just for a little while. This is the first time that I have felt happiness as an emotion in months. Japan will always have a special place in my heart.",

We are planning to work from home and to not visiting senior/nursing homes when we get back. \n\nArrived in Haneda, spent the night near Tokyo Station, took the Shinkansen to Kyoto, so far have been to northern Higashiyama and Arashiyama. We have another day and a half planned in Kyoto before we head back to Tokyo. \n\nThe noticeable changes from a tourism perspective compared to a previous visit to Kyoto is that stores and restaurants around Kyoto station close at 8pm instead of 10pm (I guess because of slow business?), we are occasionally asked to use the provided hand sanitizer, and there are more young Japanese people having a day out in traditional clothing in the preserved areas of the city (school closures, taking advantage of fewer tourists?) early spring was a heavy face mask season last year too. Maybe there are more but it\u2019s hard to say from my limited observation and there are definitely people without them as well. \n\nThere are still plenty of tourists, but I wouldn\u2019t call it crowded. We\u2019ve yet to go to a major attraction that was just us, though some places have just a few small groups of people scattered around. A couple times it was trickier finding our way around since there was no crowd to follow and Google Maps can get confused with English place names away from the big sightseeing spots. (Looking at you, Hoguzawa river boat thing) \n\nMy advice would be to limit the amount of news you read that indulges all the panicking and prioritize the information that has an actual impact on your plans, health, and finances. Like it doesn\u2019t do me any good to read what\u2019s going on with toilet paper in states on the opposite coast from me. If you do come these days, be open minded and flexible as places may have different hours or may extend their closure periods, but there is still plenty to enjoy and people are still accommodating and friendly.",

However, Taiwan  informed all incoming airlines from Japan will be quarantined for 14 days, including flight crews. \n\nJAL decided they didn't want their Japanese crews quarantined, so suspended all flights till they can get a Taiwanese crew or a crew willing/able to be quarantined in Taiwan. So they delayed my flight for the next morning. I luckily got transferred to a flight itinerary that should get me back to SFO on my originally planned date.\n\nThe moral of the story for ANY travelers, right now, is to prepare contingencies for if your flight gets cancelled or delayed. Try to get direct flights if possible. If not, prepare to have alternate itineraries noted down. **In the event of a delay/cancellation, you're going to be up against a highly stressed out airline staff and limited English communication. It'll make your life easier if you know the right questions to ask and did your own homework.**\n\nI just finished my ~10 day trip in Tokyo and had a great time despite attraction closures. I'm now heading back home to a self quarantine. If anyone has any questions, I can try to answer them with my limited perspective. \n\nLife is fucking weird right now.

I think you can work with whoever you booked with and see what your options are in terms of getting on an earlier flight.\n\nIt's definitely possible that most airlines operating Japan-NA routes will go as extreme as US carriers are (for example, AA now is only operating 3 flights a week to Asia and back). It's hard to say what actions the airlines will take now, but nothing is off the table. Anything up to what Delta has done for EU (no flights for 30 days) is possible. If it gets to that point, getting back will be increasingly hard, as you'd need to find other countries to transit through, and many are already putting restrictions on Japan. Since there's been advance warning via a State Department advisory, if you're stranded, then you're going to be on your own. The gov't might not charter a flight for people in your situation, and you might have to charter private to return.\n\nBTW, this all depends on your situation as well. If you can afford to stay in Japan for an extra 2-8 weeks as a worst case, then I would be a lot more relaxed about everything. If that happening would be detrimental to work or whatever, then I'm not sure I'd risk it. I would say definitely expect more flight cancellations, but with the situation in the US deteriorating so quickly, expect many foreign carriers to cut flights down to a bare minimum necessary, or even possibly suspending all flights.",

Going through customs and picking up baggage took less than 30-40 minutes. \n\nThat being said please take your time when getting on your train to wherever. Ahahah I had to go from Haneda to shin-okubo and it took me and my boyfriend about 2.5 hours bc we were freaking out and were not understanding anything. Almost 2 hours in and we finally got it right and now we\u2019re at our Airbnb. Showered. Ate some 7/11. \n\nMost people are definitely in masks but there are still a lot that aren\u2019t. It\u2019s still VERY busy on train during peak hours. And walking through any busy area with luggage sucks, but is necessary. \n\nI bought a pasmo card at Haneda airport. And I cannot imagine not having one. So definitely get a suica/pasmo",

I also wanted to chip in with an update of how it is here, as it was so helpful for me while I was still in my home country (the netherlands). A heads up that I\u2019m not advocating people to now decide to travel as that seems worse for the virus, but I do wanna help people that have booked already and have no choice but to go anyway, and give some reassurance.\n\nThe time we\u2019ve had here so far is (how weird it is with such a serious situation) absolutely fantastic. Japanese is the most beautiful country I\u2019ve ever been to and the people are so incredibly friendly. Like many have said, we only notice the virus through the many mouth caps people are wearing, lots of hand sanitizers and people not shaking hands but bowing instead. I was most worried that the atmosphere in the country would be bleak, but this isn\u2019t my experience at all. Most shop owners and restaurants are very happy to have customers as they are losing a lot of money due to the virus.\n\nA lot of tourist places have way less tourists, making it a lot calmer then what would usually be the case. Although sometimes the closures are frustrating (exciting plans for museums, big malls, VR halls, team labs etc) and disappointing, there is so much more to explore to Japan than those tourist attractions. Because our itinerary is less full we notice that we are a bit more at ease and are learning more about real Japanese culture rather than seeing it as a tourist. The weather also has been wonderful so far. We\u2019re usually just visiting the main tourists sites which still includes a lot of beautiful temples that we may not always be able to see from the inside, but are still gorgeous to see. In mount Koya (which I would definitely recommend), we were able to enter most Buddhist temples.\n\nIt\u2019s also very easy to book hostels and hotels on the go as all of them will have space, and sometimes they will give good discounts. This makes it quite easy to change your itinerary on the go. We also never have to stand in queue for tourists sites and so on.\n\nI have no knowledge of any restrictions for travelling back so I wouldn\u2019t be able to give any advice on whether it\u2019s still a good decision to go, I do wanna reassure people that if you already know for sure you\u2019re coming to Japan \u2014 it\u2019s still wonderful to be here and you\u2019ll have an amazing time. Possibly one of the only times you\u2019ll get to visit authentic Japan without a lot of tourists.",

Currently the situation in Japan is much better than in the US, but with level 4 travel warning from the US I could get stuck if I decide to stay here now, even after my study abroad semester were to end. I haven't heard anything from my school in America yet, as they haven't been communicating much about the situation, but they may make me come back soon on their own.\n\nWhat are your thoughts if I were to choose to stay in Japan, despite the situation being worse in the US? I would personally much rather stay in Japan, though, but I am quickly running out of time to decide what to do. Do you think it is a better decision for me to stay put, or to try going back now?",

In general, Kibune Shrine, Kuramadera Temple, Sanzenin Temple, Hosenji Temple, Atago Nenbutsuji Temple, Byodoin Temple, Ninnaji Temple, Nijo Castle, and Kyoto Gyoen may be on your list.\r  \nAlso, although we tend to focus on Kyoto and Nara, there are interesting temples and shrines on the east side of Kyoto, about 30 minutes by train from central Kyoto.\r  \nAre you interested in festivals?  Kyoto and Nara are places with many festivals.",

The one class I found at Kamata was fully booked out. The other \u2018experiences\u2019/tours seem to be sharpening through other methods. If anyone knows where to find a good whetstone know sharpening course/class in Tokyo, Kyoto or Osaka please let me know. Thanks!",

Some shops there provide knife sharpening or knife crafting classes, but I'm not sure if the classes are conducted in English. I found this one class offered by Wada Shoten that says you can have an English translator for an additional fee.\r  \n[https://www.sakai-tcb.or.jp/spot/detail/493](https://www.sakai-tcb.or.jp/spot/detail/493)\n\n\rThere is also an English page.\r  \n[https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/10925/](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/10925/)",

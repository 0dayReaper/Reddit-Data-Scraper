    "postText": "Hey all,\nLooking into potentially seeing Kabuki while we are in Tokyo early May. The tickets have just gone on sale today so I'm just wondering if anyone has been to see this and whether they felt it was worth the cost? Especially considering watching it I guess it could be difficult to understand as an English speaker maybe?\nI've checked and it looks really interesting but does look quite expensive so wondering it it's worthwhile!\n\nI was hoping there might be somewhere else we could experience it (like maybe as part of a festival since we are there golden week) but can't seem to find anything. \n\nThanks!",

If you have gone but didn\u2019t really care for it, what did you think of the experience, because it really is all about a rather alien experience? And if you do enjoy going out to the opera, well\u2026 Maybe think of comparing it to the ballet!\n\nI\u2019m the sort of guy who goes to an opera or two once every few years. I saw Kabuki when it came through Paris several years back. I enjoyed the first half but grew progressively bored due to my complete ignorance of the art. Still, I\u2019d recommend the experience to anyone interested. You will have a memorable evening, no doubt. But there are certainly alternatives that most people would find more enjoyable.",

You may already know, but Kabuki isn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d theater, it\u2019s also this intersecting point of many elements of Japanese culture and history. I encourage you to read more about it if you\u2019re interested! \n\nRegarding understanding what\u2019s going on, I suggest looking up a detailed synopsis beforehand and you\u2019ll be able to understand what\u2019s happening at least basically. Think of it like going to see some ballet like the Nutcracker, there might be no narration or dialogue that explains precisely what\u2019s happening but with enough of a basic understanding of the story you can follow along with the action based on the characters\u2019 movements and performances. \n\nNot sure how it is for Kabuki as I\u2019ve only seen Bunraku so far, but for Bunraku, the vocal performance of the narrators and the shamisen players were also highlights. There was such a great amount of vocal range and precision with the shamisen that even if I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening I was blown away enough by the music that I could just focus on that. \n\nAnd all in all, if you wind up hating it despite all that, you\u2019ve spent a comparatively very short amount of time witnessing a rare and storied performance of a pretty unique art form. I think it\u2019s well worth the time investment and price of admission.",

The one thing I remember is that it's mostly solemn, no clapping except for in between scenes the Japanese crowd like to shout out the name of their favourite actor.  I kind of joined in on that because I was bored.",

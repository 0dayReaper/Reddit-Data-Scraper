    "postText": "Heading to Japan on Sunday, 4 adults, 2 kids. Here's what we're thinking\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Day 1-4: Tokyo (April 17th - April 20, 2023)**\n\nDay 1:  Arrive in Haneda Airport, private transfer to Hilton Tokyo Bay. Nothing planned this evening to adjust to time zone\n\nDay 2: Disney all day, ***might explore the Bay area if time allows (suggestions?)***\n\nDay 3: Check out of hotel at 8 am, private guide for 10 hours\n\n* Tsukiji Fish Market - 8:30-10\n* TeamLab 10:30-12:15\n* ***lunch suggestions?***\n* Tokyo Tower/Red Tokyo Tower - 1:00-2:30\n* ***2:30-5:30 Looking for suggestions.  We're thinking of Akihabara for part of it, but not sure of what else.***\n* Drop off at hotel in Shibuya, which is a 5 minute walk to Shibuya Crossing. \n* Dinner in Shibuya\n* Shibuya crossing, **Shibuya Sky?**, Yoyogi Park, Miyashita Park. **Anything else in the area?**\n\nDay 4: Shinjuku Kart experience at 11:00-12:30, then find a way to get to Daikoku pier by 2:00.  Assuming trains will be the best route, but this would be our first experience with the trains.  \n\nDay 4-Day 13: Cruise\n\nDay 13: Private tour picking us up from cruise, Mt Fuji tour, dropping us off at a train station in Tokyo for the Bullet Train to Kyoto\n\n**Day 14-18: Kyoto** \n\nDay 14: Getting in late, dinner and bed\n\nDay 15: ***Open Day, looking for suggestions (Maybe day trip to Osaka or hitting things we didnt see on day 16 tour)***\n\nDay 16: All day Kyoto tour 8 hours\n\n* Arashiyama (***Not sure how much time we need hear to see the Togetsukyo bridge and Monkey park)***\n* Kinkakuji Temple\n* Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shrine\n* Kiyomizu-Dera Temple\n* Gion\n* Ginkakuji Temple\n* Nishiki Market\n* Nijo Castle\n* Yasaka Shrine\n\nDay 17: Train to Osaka, Universal Japan.  ***If we leave early, might try to do something else in Osaka***\n\nDay 18: Train back to Tokyo, and home\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice on any part of this would be greatly appreciated.  I put in bold and italics the parts that we're specifically trying to figure out, so any insight there would be great!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

This is simply a question of mathematics - you have eight hours for nine sights, plus transportation to/from the start and end locations, plus transportation in-between. I would split this day across Day 15 and 16 (maybe add a bit to Arashiyama, see a temple or two).",

I'll look up more info on Arashiyama, I initially thought it was just the bamboo garden with the monkeys at the top \n\nIn regards to day 3, I should have been more clear. It's basically just a private driver for the day. He doesn't speak much English at all so would just drop us off and wait\n\nWe were debating on just doing the trains/taxis, but we would be hauling our luggage around until check-in at the Shibuya hotel. We figured the price of the driver wouldn't be too much more than taking taxis everywhere. \n\nAlso, I don't know if you would know the answer, but when we look up taxis, it shows the largest is a 5 person, so if we have 6 people (2 kids aged 5 and 6), would they let them sit on our laps and drive or would we have to get 2 taxis?",

It's usually not a problem to leave luggage before check in. Also avoids the taxi size issue, especially because \"can fit 5 people\" is not the same as \"can fit 5 people and a suitcase for each\".",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nYou are unlikely to finish early from Tokyo Disney, but if you do, the obvious place is Ikspiari, the shopping area connected to Tokyo Disney.  Even on non-crowded days, amusement parks tend to have long lines.\n\nYou can list as many sights as you want to see in Kyoto with a tour guide, but you're not really going to spend any time seeing them if you pick too many.  Unlike what Google Maps looks like, the famous bamboo forest is about 15 minutes walk to the entrance to the monkey park.  (It's above Tenryuji)  A car is not going to get you there much faster because the roads are full of people walking and the speed limit is low.  It's then 20 minute to the top of the hill (which must be walked) where the monkeys are and another 20 minutes back down, so you are looking at an hour just in transport without including any time seeing the grove or the monkeys.\n\nA Guide saves you time in pointing out places to eat or making reservation, or driving you longer distances like from Arashiyama to Kinkakuji.  But they can't make the experience take less time.  You can go to Fushimi Inari and just stare at the entrance, but it took us 3 hours to hike the entire loop and take pictures.\n\nNo one who lives in Japan likes the Go Karts.  No one is going to be smiling or waving.  They're one of those things that the people in Japan resent tourists bringing back.  They also require all members of your party who are participating to have International Driver's Licenses.\n\nGood luck!",

It\u2019s so cool. \n\n[otagi Nenbutsuji](https://instagram.com/otagiji_official?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)\n\nThere is also Gioji - moss temple which is gorgeous. \n\nYou also have a myriad of cafes and restaurants such as:\n\n1.Pizzeria Lugara\n2. Saganoyu\n3. Cafe Cotorino\n4. Cafe Musubi\n5. Cafe Sagano ( a lovely retro cafe of the way to Adashino run by two elderly ladies) \n6. Arashiyama Nomura\n7. Kameyamaya \n\nAs well as a host of other places. If you go only for the bridge and main bamboo forest you will most likely be severely disappointed.",

    "postText": "Technically, I suppose we could make it up and down Mt Fuji with our kids - some 105-year-old made it, I suppose we could train... We like to hike, but 4-5 hours is the longest the family has ever done.  (The kids aren't old but they can easily outlast P2... and probably myself.)  But given tight timing, altitude sickness, weather at the top, gear we'd need, I don't think we will be ascending - this time.\n\nSo I'm looking for suggestions for nearby hikes, ideally ones that might yield a view of Mt Fuji if the view from below is blocked by clouds etc.  We'll be there in mid-August (just before Mountain Day), so rain / clouds looks like a significant possibility.  I think we will likely have a rental car for a few days, since the Fuji Marriott seems pretty isolated.\n\nI have run across mention of Mt. Ishiwari, Mt. Ohira, Mt Kintoki... for Mt Tenjo, we'd probably just take the ropeway to that one, if lines aren't crazy.   But I would love to hear from someone who did some hikes in the area, esp with kids.  Thanks!",

During off season if you want to gonup they have you fill out a paper and leave it at station 5 so they can identify your body when climbing seasons starts up again.\n\nBut you can hike from station 5 to the eastern peak, I don't remember the name off the top of my head, and it is mostly across although some up and down since you go down in to the crater before going back up. Decent hike, not too difficult except for very low vis for us due to low cloud cover.",

I took a quick Kaba bus tour around the lake which gives you a perfect view of the mountain. Afterwards I took a long, slow stroll on the beach, with a beautiful view of Fuji in the background. There was a local udon and soba spot about 1/4 mile from the bus station as well as a hammock cafe with Fuji in plain view. This might be too little activity but for someone older or injured it would be perfect.",

But even if we wore tennis shoes, it would require a bunch of warm clothing, maybe headlamps, that we would not otherwise need to bring along.  So that's strike one.  And I've read that children can be more susceptible to altitude sickness than adults, and of course there's always some danger involved with that... I experienced altitude sickness in Cuzco, Peru, and did not find it very enjoyable.  But if it involved our kids, that implicates a different set of fears.  So - we're not planning on going up.

This was their first time climbing a mountain, and my only experience was Mt. Vesuvius. We had no special gear, and we did not really have the correct clothing either. Sneakers and a warm sweater did the trick. Though from the 8th station or the 9th, we did see 2 children with air canisters, from seperate families, but there were also Japanese children who talked to us and said they climbed Mt. Fuji for the second time that week so if your children are used to heights because you climb often, it shouldn't be a problem, but be careful.",

From the lower station to the upper station was quite steep. At one point you start to follow the ridges which was super nice. It is mostly in the forest, but we were glad we were able to hike in the shadows, even though it was only about 17\u00b0C at the bottom. But there are always some areas with less forest where you can see fujisan or the side of the lake again. One part was a very steep descend, but there were ropes to help you get down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second hike was the \"Tokai Nature Trail\", we started at around the south west end of Lake Fujikawaguchiko up to Mt. Ashiwada (1355m) - Mt. Sankodai - Mt Koyodai and ended up around the south west end of Lake Saiko (near the batcave). It was also often in the forest, the Tokai Nature Trail part was sometimes ridges, sometimes kind of a plateau. Most of the altitude gain is at the beginning (lots of stairs, sometimes a bit of 'climbing' with the help of ropes) and then slowly descends back down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe used a hiking app, otherwise we probably would have gotten lost (google maps doesn't show those trails). We also had a map called \"Fuji Five Lakes 'covering all features' map\" at our apartment which was really nice, it showed many trails and also the approximate times and altitudes, and we used that to figure out where we wanted to go for our second hike.",

There are many trails that start at Mizugazuka Parking Lot, which can be accessed from Gotemba with a public bus. The trail was in most parts quite flat and on a sunny day offers - in certain sections - very close-up views of Mount Fuji. I personally found the hike very interesting and atmospheric - you can also visit a cave during the hike.  There are various trails that you can chose from - and although it is in Japanese, this [website](http://www.kyuyorin.jp/) includes an overview of the trail options.",

            "comment": "You could climb Echizendake south of Mt Fuji. It can be a 4 hour round trip according to guides and about 600 to 700 meters of elevation gain. It\u2019s a nice little hike but doesn\u2019t compare to Mt Fuji.\n\nAs for Mt. Fuji, I see lots of little kids hiking it all the time. If it was me and I wanted to maximize their chances of success I would take it super slow, arrive early if you can\u2019t stay the night at the 5th or 6th stations. Let your bodies acclimate for at least 30 minutes. I know the 5th station at Yoshida Trail has some some shops. So walk around and spend as much time as you want there before leaving. When you get to each  station stop and take a breather even if they don\u2019t need it. Have a look around, take some pictures, play a game, make them drink some something and eat a little bit then continue. \n\n\nHydration/Nutrition: I\u2019ve run up Mount Fuji from the ocean to the top faster then most people can climb from the 5th stations with zero altitude acclamation and have never had altitudes sickness, one aspect that I think has helped me is staying very hydrated the day before and during. Not just plain water but with electrolytes. I would also add some very salty food before, think ramen, dried meats, or adding extra salt to your liquids. There is a specific amount (it\u2019s a lot like 3-4 grams) that will increase your blood plasma volume which the decreasing of blood plasma volume occurs when you go up in elevation so I use this to counter when climbing quick. Obviously you probably don\u2019t care about performance and optimization so you don\u2019t need that much salt but I think just focusing on some extra salty foods before and during the trip could give a slight advantage. As for the day of, have a mixture of sweet and salty foods, a mixture of real foods and hiking snacks is great. I tend to lose my appetite when I climb but one thing that always sounds good are those jelly pouch drinks. Short hikes, just snacks tend to be great, but as the hikes get longer real food becomes more desirable. For liquids other then water, sports drink work best since they have electrolytes and sugar. It\u2019s best to sip or take a mouthful instead of chug. This will reduce urination and also prevent sloshing in the stomach which can lead to GI issues. \n\nGear: Next is helmets for kids, are they necessary? Not really but you never know when a rock could fall and it\u2019s a good idea to make them wear it. They can be rented. Headlamps, they can be bought super cheap off of Amazon. Probably good to have two, one for each parent, or for a backup and extra batteries. If they don\u2019t have a lock, take the batteries out bc there are very easy to get accidentally turned on in your pack. As far as warm clothes go, it\u2019s kinda subjective. I have always climbed Mt Fuji in running shorts and a T-shirt and felt fine. If you stop moving at the middle of night at the top in can get cold but if you keep moving some light layers are fine (rain jacket/shell, long sleeve, ect). If you bring warm clothes it shouldn\u2019t be for winter unless your plan at staying at the top and not moving.",

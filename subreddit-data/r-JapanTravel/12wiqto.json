            "comment": "Hi!\n\nThis is not meant to be rude.\n\nI am just going to throw out there July and August are very hot and humid in Japan.  I've noticed a lot of Europeans in particular seem to find it just stifling because of the heat and humidity.  It's totally survivable, I tend to go in June, just be aware of that because it could affect your energy levels while sightseeing if you're not prepared for it.\n\nI probably would not pick the Hokata Ropeway as my activity when in the Okuhida regions because of this:\n\n[https://shinhotaka-ropeway.jp/2022/11/30/%e3%80%902023%e5%b9%b45%e6%9c%888%e6%97%a5%ef%bc%88%e6%9c%88%ef%bc%89%ef%bd%9e8%e6%9c%889%e6%97%a5%ef%bc%88%e6%b0%b4%ef%bc%89%e3%80%91%e3%83%a1%e3%83%b3%e3%83%86%e3%83%8a%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b9%e5%b7%a5/](https://shinhotaka-ropeway.jp/2022/11/30/%e3%80%902023%e5%b9%b45%e6%9c%888%e6%97%a5%ef%bc%88%e6%9c%88%ef%bc%89%ef%bd%9e8%e6%9c%889%e6%97%a5%ef%bc%88%e6%b0%b4%ef%bc%89%e3%80%91%e3%83%a1%e3%83%b3%e3%83%86%e3%83%8a%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b9%e5%b7%a5/)\n\nI love onsen but Gero is going to be quite hot during the day.  If you want to go to an onsen look at Hirayu since it is further into the mountains and perhaps look into a day trip to Kamikochi.  You might be able to fit both since Hirayu is the transfer station for Kamikochi.\n\nI think trying to get from Takayama to Kawaguchiko is going to take a very long time because they're not very close to one another at all.  You could take a bus from Takayama to Matsumoto and then the train to Otsuki and then transfer or you can go via Takayama to Nagoya on a Hida and then the shinkansen to Mishima and then a bus to Kawaguchiko.\n\nYou would need to cut something out to really give yourself any time in Kawaguchiko.  Do be aware June, July and August are among the 3 worst months for viewing Mt. Fuji and it does tend to be snow free (as July and August are the main climbing season.)\n\nFrom Hiroshima to Kanazawa is going to take you like 5+ hours.  You can take a Sakura shinkansen between Hiroshima and Shin-Osaka and then change for a Thunderbird but that will be around a 5 hour trip.\n\nI get wanting to see the fireworks.  I personally found Kenrokuen disappointing in June and I am not sure it is that much better in July.  It will be quite green and ice cream of course tastes better when it is super hot and humid,   If you look at their flower/plant calendar you will see mid June to August is kind of a bummer compared to March-May.\n\n[https://www.pref.ishikawa.jp/siro-niwa/kenrokuen/e/season-koyomi.html](https://www.pref.ishikawa.jp/siro-niwa/kenrokuen/e/season-koyomi.html)\n\nI went in November in '09 or '08 and had a great time but despite loving Kanazawa in general, understood why my tween preferred other gardens when we went in late June..\n\nGood luck!",

I think clothes make less of a difference than giving yourself a chance to take breaks and eat or drink something cold.",

I didn't realize it was basically just a few rooms for people to take social media pictures in. That's about all it felt like to me, at least. The water room was definitely really cool though.",

If you want an early breakfast go to Cobakaba just around the corner from the station, really great traditional breakfast. \n\nAnd go to Enoshima via the Enoden (Enoshima Electric Railway) if you\u2019ve got the space for it! I only spent the last hour or so of my time in Kamakura there, it doesn\u2019t need much time but the train is charming if you\u2019re into that kinda thing.",

Italy and England v. France matches scheduled for Sat., Oct. 12 have been **CANCELLED**. Further information and the full statement from RWC can be found [here](https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/update). \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**This post will be updated as time allows as the storm approaches. Please also watch the comments section for distinguished (green) comments from other /r/JapanTravel moderators, as moderator /u/laika_cat is located in the typhoon zone and might not be able to update the post directly.**\n\nSuper Typhoon No. 19 (aka Typhoon Hagibis) a is currently making its way toward Central and Eastern Japan. Current predictions have the storm passing directly near the Kansai area around 10am JST on Saturday, Oct. 12. The storm is currently projected to pass directly over Tokyo and the Kanto region between the evening of Saturday, Oct. 12 and the early hours of Sunday, Oct. 13.\n\n**This storm is currently projected to have destructive winds as high as 60 m per second when making landfall.**\n\n**Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Yamanashi, Mie, Shizuoka and several other prefectures will be affected by this storm at varying degrees of intensity.** Please familiarize yourself with your location and which prefecture(s) you are currently in.\n\nThe outermost bands of the storm are projected to affect weather in cities such as Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe and Nagoya. Cities such as Tokyo and Yokohama, as well as towns on the Izu peninsula should brace for a direct hit from the storm.\n\nProjections show the storm may weaken as it reaches land \u2014 but please note that this storm will still be **extremely** powerful, even as it weakens slightly. Currently, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center is categorizing this as a Super Typhoon.\n\nAn [NHK World report](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20191009_29/) from 3pm JST this afternoon (Weds. Oct. 9) states Typhoon No. 19 was situated near the Ogasawara islands, boasting gusts of 270 kilometers per hour.\n\n**If you are near the water in the Kanto, Chubu or Kansai regions, please seek higher ground and stay indoors as the storm approaches.** Do not attempt to go near water during this storm, or you will risk severe injury or even death. Note that landslides are always a possibility during storms of this nature.\n\n**IMPORTANT!!** This is typhoon season, and storms like this are par for the course. However, projections indicate this storm will be much stronger than Typhoon Faixai, which severely damaged parts of Kanagawa and Chiba prefectures. Please take extra precaution this weekend.\n\n**[Here is the JMA page for Super Typhoon No. 19](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/1919l.html).** Clicking the map will zoom in.\n\n**[Here is the NHK Typhoon portal](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/weather/typhoon.html).**\n\nCurrent English-language information can be found via the [Joint Typhoon Warning Center](http://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html) and [NOAA](https://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/TROP/floaters/20W/20W_floater.html).\n\n[JMA maintains a nationwide map for typhoons](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/). This map denotes areas that will be affected by weather and is updated hourly. \n\nIf you are in or near the above mentioned areas it would be in your best interest to bookmark [this link](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/1919l.html) to your phone or other wi-fi enabled device. Any changes to the storm's path should be reviewed carefully. If the situation becomes dangerous, you should have a temporary plan in place to reach safety in the event of a storm.\n\n- [Advisories for Tokyo prefecture](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/warn/319_table.html)\n\n- [Advisories for Chiba prefecture](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/warn/318_table.html)\n\n- [Advisories for Kanagawa prefecture](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/warn/320_table.html)\n\n- [Advisories for Shizuoka prefecture](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/warn/327_table.html)\n\nPlease click [here](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/warn/) if your current prefecture is not listed above for the entire list.\n\nYou can find individualized advisories for your respective location in each prefecture by clicking the links above. This will require knowing which city or ward you're located in. (ie: Kobe-shi, Naoshima-cho.)\n\nPlease keep in mind that while typhoons are not uncommon in Japan, you should still take precautions while you make your way around as a tourist:\n\n- **Always follow the instructions of all emergency management officials and emergency responders.** You can use Google Picture translate for translating things you cannot get in English, such as signs and screenshots of emergency alerts.\n\n- **Stay away from beaches, lakes, rivers and other sources of inland water, to avoid being affected by flooding.** This is particularly important for areas of Chiba, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Mie and other areas near the ocean. See advisory links above.\n\n- **Be aware that Typhoons can cause damage to train lines, flight delays, and affect roadways.** If you have to leave Japan from an airport in Eastern Japan (ie: Narita, Haneda) Friday or Saturday, you may want to plan on arriving to the airport early to avoid being stranded. Review your flight information with your airline in case of cancellations. If you would prefer to stay in the city, make arrangements beforehand as last minute bookings could become unavailable as the typhoon presses into the country.\n\n- **Contact your embassy/consulate if you require consular services or emergency assistance.** If you are planning a trip abroad, remember to register with your consulate/embassy on arrival, if you haven't already done so.\n\n**How To Enable Emergency Alerts On Your Phone:**\n\n**Enabling Emergency Alerts (iPhone)**\n\n- Go to Settings    \n- Tap \"Notifications\"    \n- Scroll all the way down    \n- Enable \"Emergency Alerts\"    \n\n**Enabling Emergency Alerts (Android)**\n\n**Depending on the version:**\n\n- Go to Settings    \n- Go to Wireless &amp;amp;amp; Networks    \n- Go to Cell Broadcasts    \n- Check off all\n\nOR    \n\n- Go to settings    \n- Go to Apps &amp;amp;amp; Notifications    \n- Go to Emergency Alerts    \n- Enable all    \n\n**Common Questions**\n\n1. **I was contacted by my hotel and they are evacuating/evacuated. What should I do?** You should re-adjust your plan to avoid the evacuated areas. Always follow the recommendations of officials from the prefecture you are visiting.\n\n2. **Is my train canceled?** You will need to use one of the resources under \"Useful Links\" to determine if it is cancelled or not. If it is, find a safe place to stay until the trains are running \u2014 but be aware this may several hours or days, depending on the severity of the damage to the lines. Research alternate transportation now, and possibly look into cutting your trip short.\n\n3. **Should I cancel/alter my plans?** You'll have to determine this for yourself, but it's always recommended to err on the side of caution. Keep a close eye on the forecast at least, and set a firm line on when enough is enough.\n\n4. **Is there any way out of XYZ location?** If trains are not running, other options include buses and taxis. It is also recommended to contact your hotel as they may be able to provide assistance in getting out of certain areas. You can also contact your Embassy for assistance \u2014 but be aware that you will not be the only person attempting to do so. Coming up with a contingency plan now could make or break the rest of your trip.\n\n5. **What should I expect?** Conditions will vary by area, but generally, expect high winds and heavy rain. Serious conditions, such as landslides and flooding, are **very rare** in cities and are more likely to affect rural areas. These storms pass quickly, but the winds can knock down trees and scaffolding, damage umbrellas and shut down train lines. It's best to stay indoors until the storm passes.\n\n6. **Seems cool! I'm in the city, so can I go outside?** NO. Do NOT go out in a typhoon, if at all possible, under any circumstances \u2014 especially once the storm makes landfall in your area. People are regularly killed during major typhoons, even individuals in cities. Aside from the obvious fatal possibilities associated with landslides and floods in rural areas, individuals in cities can very easily be killed by flying or falling debris, such as scaffolding, signage and tree branches. During Typhoon Faixai in Sept. 2019, a woman in Tokyo was killed when a large gust of wind blew her into a brick wall. Being in a city is NOT a surefire way to avoid serious injury or death during a typhoon.\n\n##**USEFUL LINKS**\n\n- Live news coverage from NHK (Japanese only) can be streamed [here](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/live/index.html) when being broadcast.\n\n- [Japan Meteorological Association Typhoon portal](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/)\n\n- [Google Crisis Maps](https://www.google.org/crisismap/weather_and_events)\n\n- [Windy](http://windy.com) - live visualizations and time-based tracking\n\n- [JR East Shinkansen](http://traininfo.jreast.co.jp/train_info/e/shinkansen.aspx)\n\n- [JR West](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/)\n\n- [JR Central](http://traininfo.jr-central.co.jp/en/)\n\n- [JR Kyushu](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/)\n\n- [JR Shikoku](http://www.jr-shikoku.co.jp/info/index_en.html)\n\n- [NHK Typhoon information](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/weather/typhoon.html)\n\nMore links will be added as necessary.",

There is an imminent danger of landslides and flooding.**\n\n###**As the Typhoon has now moved out of Tokyo, we'd like to remind people that the rain and winds will have brought debris along the roads and streets in the city. Please continue to stay indoors as emergency crews and other city workers will be attempting to see the scale of any damage - that includes damage from debris that may still be flying, or perched perilously in the trees or on buildings.**\n\n###**Live Updates in English on the NHK English Site have ended, but please keep it bookmarked as it will be updated throughout the night and into the early morning: https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/live/**-\n\n###**SPOILER: You're not likely to go anywhere in, around, or out of Tokyo before 12pm on Sunday, or at all in some cases. As noted here (in Japanese, turn on your translator), rail lines will be closed until 12pm at the earliest while they are checked for damage and repaired:https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20191013/k10012127241000.html?utm_int=news_contents_news-main_006**\n\n###**If you had a flight today/Sunday, it's probably cancelled.

If they have a few planes that can't depart, they will just send you all off together later in the day when the storm has passed and the airport can receive passengers again.\n\nGiven what happened last time, with the trains to and from the airport being out of service for the better part of almost two days, they may delay you for up to 48 hours. \n\nThe downside is that they need the storm to hit before they can confirm a plan of action, so you're in a wait-and-see pattern like everyone else.",

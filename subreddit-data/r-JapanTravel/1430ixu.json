    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nOff to Japan in August for 2 weeks with my partner. I\u2019ve been before but she hasn\u2019t. I was pretty happy with this itinerary when I made it but now having second thoughts.  I\u2019m into photography and she\u2019s really into food. Ironically, none of us are into anime or museums despite loving art, architecture and history. \n\nDay 1: land at Haneda around 10pm. Make our way to the hotel in Roppongi. Late night food options in the area? \n\nDay 2: start off the day with a morning gym sesh to loosen up after the long flight and breakfast/coffee at a Showa era cafe. hit up places that have most of the main things to do in central Tokyo (Mori Tower, Ginza, Harajuku, Shibuya, Golden Gai). I\u2019ve already seen and had enough of these places but she hasn\u2019t so it\u2019d be good to tick them off the list. \n\nDay 3: hit up places that have most of the main things to do in outer Tokyo (Asakusa, Ueno, Koenji, Tsukiji fish market) \n\nDay 4: check out some photo galleries,catch up with acquaintances from my previous trip to Tokyo. \n\nDay 5: trip to Mt.Fuji. We\u2019re staying at Hotel Asafuji which was quite expensive to book so I am wondering if the Fuji view from room is worth it after all. \n\nPlan is to cycle a lot and take in the sights around Mt Fuji. Last time the bikes I hired were terrible. Any recommendations on a good place to hire bikes from in Fujikawaguchiko? \n\nDay 6: Fuji to Yokohama. How do we do this? Last time I took a bus but I remember it being hard to get a ticket for and there being only 1 bus a day for this route. Plan is to activate JR pass on this day so if there any train options from Fujikawagucjiko to Yokohama that would be preferable. \n\nNot sure what we\u2019ll do in Yokohama but it just seemed like a good place to stop over given we are going to Kyoto the next day on the Shinkansen. Any suggestions? \n\nDay 7: Kyoto. Staying near old district. I really really want to avoid the areas packed with tourists as Kyoto is notorious for it. I did not enjoy Fushimi Inari for this reason last time. Wondering if the Higashiyama district suffers from the same overcrowding. \n\nDay 8: Osaka. Staying near Dottonbori. Also want to stop by Shinsekai for the street food. \n\nDay 9: Daytrip to Kobe and Wakayama , then back to Osaka. Wondering if we can fit both on the same day without feeling rushed. \n\nDay 10: beachside resort in Tanabe. Stopover at Miyabe and Inami on the way. Only issue will be carrying luggage in between. \n\nDay 11: late checkout from Tanabe. Given we\u2019ve got all of the day time to kill I\u2019m wondering what we could do until catching the Sunset Izumo sleeper train from Osaka at midnight. \n\nDay 12-15: back to Tokyo (staying in Ebisu). Ticking off what we didn\u2019t get around to during our first few days in Tokyo. Also figured this would be a good time to do any shopping and fill up our bags since we won\u2019t have to lug them around anywhere else. \n\nDay 16: booked a stay in Shinagawa so it\u2019s easier to get to Haneda for our early morning flight.\n\nDay 17: fly back.",

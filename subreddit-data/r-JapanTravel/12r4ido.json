    "postText": "Quick itinerary question.  We have a full itinerary planned and can share that later, but I just want to know if it is actually feasible to just stay in Kyoto the whole time as opposed to traveling around, changing hotels, and hauling luggage around everywhere?\n\nDay 1 is landing in Narita\nDay2 and 3 will be spend at Ryokan in Hakone\n\nDay 4: 11/24 (Hakone \u2192 Kyoto)\n- staying at Gion Misen Furumonzen \n\nDay 5: 11/25 (Kyoto)\n- explore Kyoto\n\nDay 6: 11/26 (Kyoto\u2192 Osaka \u2192 Kobe \u2192 Kyoto)\n- universal studios\n- dinner in Kobe\n- night life in Kyoto\n\nDay 7: 11/27 (Kyoto\u2192 Osaka \u2192 Nara \u2192 Kyoto)\n- aquarium in Osaka\n- Nara Activities\n- explore hangout in Kyoto for the night\n\nDay 8: 11/28 (Kyoto\u2192 Hiroshima)\n- explore Hiroshima\n- don\u2019t check out of Kyoto hotel, leave luggage and check into cheap hotel in Hiroshima. \n\nDay 9: 11/29 (Hiroshima \u2192 Kyoto)\n- Okunoshima island (rabbit island)\n\nDay 10: 11/30 (Kyoto \u2192 Kawaguchiko/Mt. Fuji)\n- check out of Kyoto Hotel and head to Kawaguchiko in morning.\n\nDay 11-13 we will spend in Tokyo\n\nThis seems possible, but just based on travel times on Google Maps.  We feel the more we have to pack up, check in and out of hotels, and haul luggage around\u2026the more likely it will be that something will go wrong along the way.\n\nLet me know if all this back and forth business is just silly.",

The distance from Kyoto to Osaka is relatively short, but it really cuts out a lot of travel time getting to Hiroshima and even lining up early for USJ. Even with the fast passes it is going to take you a while to see the places you have listed, especially since it seems to be a Sunday that you are going on if I\u2019m reading the dates right!! \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about luggage you can have the hotel send it ahead to your new accommodations.",

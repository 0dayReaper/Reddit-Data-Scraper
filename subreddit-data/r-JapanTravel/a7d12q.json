Death Note was for me, content that sparked many thoughts and many contemplations of cultural perception, ethical perception, expectation and understanding in Japan. As I grew up, I noted many significant cultural aspects that were unique to Japan and yearned to experience it all for myself. Many books, documentaries and travel guides over the years have added to this intrigue!\n\nI have been back home in Australia a little over a month now and have had a little time to reflect, so would love to share with you the moments and the experiences that stood out to me most:\n\n\\- ***The trains are eerily quiet*** (particularly as an Australian who frequents public transport back home); very few people will talk on train rides. I realised during my train rides two things: 1. Japanese people really value peace and quiet and don't appreciate anything breaking this calm. 2. The loud and obnoxious were always tourists, always.\n\n\\- ***The streets are also surprisingly quiet!*** People don't walk down the streets talking loudly on their phones; those who needed to make phone calls would do so discretely while standing still in a corner away from walking traffic, only taking on their path again once they have ended their call.\n\n\\- ***Alcohol is so easy to buy*** that as someone who does not speak or read Japanese, I bought a can of Shochu alcohol at a convenience store thinking it was green tea. I realised my mistake when I felt a little buzzed on the 1.5hr bullet train trip.\n\n\\- ***It is out of character for trains to depart any later than their scheduled time;*** we had one train trip in our entire time there that was delayed, fancy it being the one that took us to the airport after already running half an hour later than we intended to leave...\n\n\\- ***People do not walk and eat, or walk and drink in public***, counter-intuitive to the plethora of vending machines that are available across the country (even in the most remote of towns)! People will finish eating standing next to the vending machine and dispose of their rubbish in the bins beside the vending machines respectfully. I once saw a man throw his cigarette butt on the floor and people behind him were quick to give a look of shock. Rubbish bins are also surprisingly hard to locate outside of vending machine areas..\n\n\\- ***People eat and drink on the train***, and this is so widely accepted that some trains will even have fold out tables with drink holders!\n\n***- The Tokyo train stations give me anxiety***, only because I travelled with 25kg of luggage and found myself in sticky situations of some stations being without escalators and elevators at many of the half-floors that would lead to the main floors and platforms, or escalators and elevators only at certain entrance/exit points that were not the ones I needed to travel through. Oh, and because I feel claustrophobic being squished into a train like a sardine in a tin. \n\n\\- ***Service and hospitality is really big in Japan, from the smallest of ways;*** baskets underneath dining tables at restaurants for you to put your bags and belongings in, service-men in front of car parks to direct incoming/out-going traffic from the car park and let pedestrians know when it is safe to cross, hooks on certain trains for coats/hats, traffic controllers who always nod you off as you drive past, bathrooms at all of the convenience stores (outside of the Tokyo city area), hot towels to wipe your hands with at restaurants, the \"I'll try my best\" attitude at all of your requests, instead of the eye-rolls and teeth grinds that you may get when you ask for something in some other parts of the world where you're made to feel like you are inconveniencing people to do their jobs...\n\n\\- ***There was a real contrast about Japan*** \\- so much of the old lives with the new; buzzing bright technology and proud and peaceful practices of centuries-old traditions.\n\n\\- ***Mountains, stunning, big, bold mountains, everywhere!*** I had no idea that volcanically active countries resulted in such picture-perfect, postcard-iconic landscapes! Holy dooly, the sights were a feast for my eyes! Waterfalls, mountains, valleys, molten lava-formed rock attractions, onsens, deep blue lakes, large gushing gorges, rich Autumnal foliage...\n\n\\- ***The array of healthy and home-made food options available at convenience stores and supermarkets*** gives me some insight into why obesity is definitely not an issue in Japan! Also, very delicious options that are rather guilt-free, coming from a fast-food laden country!\n\n\\- ***Driving was really easy***, being an Australian on the same side of the steering wheel and road, with an English-navigator GPS. The only time we ended up on the wrong lane/side of the road was when we were too busy pointing at the puppy that sat patiently with his owner to wait for the pedestrian light to go green.\n\n\\- ***Pedestrian crossings don't make sounds or need their buttons pushed to light green!*** I learned the clearly-a-tourist way that pressing the button at pedestrian crossings will result in loud tunes to signal to the visually-impaired that it is safe to cross the road..\n\n\\- ***Traditional homes have 'wet rooms' as bathrooms*** where the entire bathroom, including walls, are designed to get wet. The shower heads can always be removed from the holder so that you can shower and rinse down from the flat part of the wet room, outside of the bathtub! This was something I had to get used to, but by the end of my trip, so loved the practicality! Most wet rooms in Japanese homes also doubled as clothes dryers (there are options on the ventilation/aircon pad)\n\n\\- ***Japan is incredibly spiritual;*** shrines are scattered everywhere across cities, towns and villages, and death seems to be more 'visible' than what I'm used to - i.e. cemeteries are not hidden behind a wall of trees but presented in plain sight in most non-city areas.\n\n\\- ***Japan seem to have a really rapidly growing commitment to ethical and sustainable consumption*** \\- thrift and 'recycle' stores were in an abundance!\n\n\\- ***The Japanese preserve everything so well,*** from their culture to their belongings to their structures, I was left feeling impressed at how careful and considered they are!\n\n\\- ***There is an elegant simplicity about Japan;*** from the crisp and clean interiors of traditional homes, to the beautifully-presented variety-of-small-portioned-food at meal times, to the general visual merchandising of most retail stores, to the multi-functioning bathrooms/wet rooms, to the chopstick rest.. There was such a strong presence of artisanel and well-intended craftsmanship in so many aspects of living, from cuisine to building structures, art to hospitality, cars to roads, bedding to furniture...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go on and on really about how amazing the trip was, but I think I may have babbled some of you into boredom (if not, you are always welcomed to message me if you do have any curiousities that need quenching)! So I think I will end this with praise on how magnificent of a trip Japan was for me, and how wonderful of a place it would be to travel for anyone; from those who absolutely adore the buzzing sights and loud sounds of big cities, to those who dream about the way that the sunset paints the sky in warm ombre shades over natural backdrops in quiet and remote places (me)! There is a lot to discover, a lot to experience, a lot to indulge in, a lot to be humbled by, a lot to learn, a lot to appreciate, and a lot to be thankful for in this incredibly beautiful and distinctly unique country!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gahhh, would 11/10 go again!",

            "comment": "Awesome post.  \n\nThis is pretty wrong:   \n\n&gt;Japan is incredibly spiritual     \n\nunless you mean it feels like that for you because there are a lot of shrines and temples. It does have religious practices and influence in the culture (obviously).      \n\nI am going to write a bit about this. Maybe because I have a very heavy background in practicing  Buddhism, and know Japan pretty well.    \n\nMany US cities have churches all over - every few blocks. Like Japan, people don't go there much. No one would say \"The US is incredibly spiritual\" when they saw all these churches if they knew anything about the culture. Most Japanese are not spiritual or interested in religion or spiritual things. Most Japanese know little about Buddhism, for example - unless you count the new-age new Buddhist cults where you do things like pray for money.  They know more about the history of Buddhism and Shinto practices, but not as much about the spiritual sides.  \n\nModern cultures have spiritual roots. That's why God is a part of US culture and Shinto and Buddhism is a part of Japanese culture. In modern societies like Japan and the US few young people are interested in spirituality. Actually probably many more people in the US are interested in spirituality, and many more people (in some US states) are religious and Christian. But the US culture itself is not very religious or moral.   \n\nJapanese people have a stronger simple moral sense and respect others for the most part. Again, compared to the US - since I live in both countries (more in the US).  \n\nIf you want to be able to say \"this country is incredibly spiritual\" go to India or Nepal or Tibet (or spend time with overseas Tibetans). Their culture is incredibly spiritual.    \n\nI love your post, but just wanted to comment on that. Overall I would consider most Japanese people to be pretty kind and moral, but not spiritual. Young people in Japan are often not religious.  The temples and shrines in Japan are amazing though.   \n\nAlso, you write incredibly well. I really enjoyed reading your post. Thank you.",

                    "comment": "Hello :)\n\nYou're totally right, I wouldn't consider the US spiritual because there are churches dotted along every block.\n\nI actually interpret spirituality and religiousity fairly different to how you see it. I see religion as rather dogmatic and indoctrines in it a faith that tells of how every thing that one does now to carry consequences into one's position in the after-life.\n\nSpirituality, I find, is quite an inward journey of quiet reflections and an honest awareness of how what you learn about yourself and know about the world can be used to better yourself and the world around you. So, for example, I really admire that Shintoism is more so a spiritual tradition that you carry into your every day life; like understanding how to live in harmony with the natural world surrounding us and appreciating and respecting that the natural world has an energy and a spirit about it. \n\nI also find that the way people lead their lives in Japan to be very Zen-like, in that everything is very deliberate and careful and considered, so I guess spirituality in the context that I perceive it in, where one is honest with one's reflections and uses it to better the world, I see Japan as a nation that truly does this and implements many little conveniences for standard of living and lifestyle to be easy, unhurried and seamless.\n\nOn a side note, lucky you to be able to spend half your time living in Japan :) I hope it's been enlightening and fulfilling for you! I'd really like to live there in later years to study for projects of my own.",

                            "comment": "Hate to break it to you, but there's no deep spiritual inward journeys happening in the average Japanese person's lives. The culture drills it into them from a young age that they be respectful, and to obey all the norms within Japanese society. Cheerful service? Sure, most are happy to help, but some probably hate you on the inside for inconveniencing them, and some Japanese people don't even serve/do business with foreigners because they have grudges against them for the war OR because rude foreigners have entered their stores before. Easy, seamless living standards built into the system? That's because the people who work to make that happen spend YEARS to process any change. It's a slow and steady system which eventually becomes something pretty good, but if there's a social problem, it'll take the government and people of the country maybe a hundred years to fix it. Speaking of things which aren't fixed yet, the amount of unpaid overtime and overworking culture has yet to be fixed, despite them trying for a while now. People are still dying from overwork, and companies are using loopholes to continue overworking their employees. Their culture is different, and it affects the way the country runs, but they're definitely not spiritual, in your sense nor nonosam9's sense. As a Christian, this topic pops up whether my Japanese friends ask me about it or I ask them about it, but most Japanese people don't know why they do certain things at temples or shrines. Why do you hang up cranes? Why are there shrines within temple grounds? What do you pray about to Buddha statues? Why do you even pray to Buddha statues? (I thought you just chant mantras, not pray for things, but I'm not Buddhist so I actually don't know the answer haha)\n\nAll that said, I enjoy living in Japan and am happy you love it too. Convenience, respectful people, great scenery, architecture and garden designing which really looks awesome and has a lot of effort put in, there's a lot of great stuff. But just letting you know that Japanese people aren't very spiritual and are actually very boring people who just do what they're told or have been taught. Their actions are a reflection of society's expectations on them.",

I did grow up Buddhist though and still live amongst family who are practising Buddhists.\n\nI also have many close Japanese friends; their attitudes towards life always considers how they can do their best in everything that they commit to. Even from the smallest examples such as responses like \"I'll do my best\" instead of the \"I guess I'll give it a go,\" are what I interpret an introspective approach to wanting to better the self. You interpret this as a cultural expectation, I see it as a spiritual inclination that has been weaved into culture. We simply define spirituality from our own, very personal, experiences.\n\nWith that said, I am not without blinkers and recognise the many points you have made about cultural expectations on working hours and how that impacts on psychological and emotional well-being, and it's actually one of the things I find most intriguing about Japan as a nation of contrast. One of the reasons I'd like to live in Japan in years time is for this very reason, and build the first-hand research into my PhD about how culture impacts well-being and suicide there.\n\nIn regards to cheerful service, there is so much to commend about their hospitality - where I'm from, those in the service industry don't necessarily hold their tongue and lash out at customers and clients, which I don't feel gives much to have pride about.\n\nOn the note of you living there and enjoying your journey so far, I am glad :) I'm sure there's much more to explore in the country that will enhance your self experiences!\nIn regard to the gardens, architecture and designs that you enjoy about Japan... the concept of Ikigai is present in all of this; a sense of purpose in doing the best that we can in whatever we create and make, a very artisanal approach that I consider elegantly spiritual :) - also, it won't be of harm to you to reflect on your sweeping statement about Japanese people being boring people, it's definitely something many will beg to differ from :)",

Because when I was in Japan, I wasn't blown away by the food quality. It was good, true, but not much better than what I am used to in my home country. Especially the meat. I would wager a bet that the typical layman like me wouldn't taste a difference between a normal cut of beef from Japan and from my home country.",

That would be $60-100 in America. For a $22 meal in America, you would have to order something $17 pre-tax/tip. You could get one entree at a mediocre restaurant.\n\nEven a basement food court stall that serves a 800 JPY (7 USD!!!) bowl is amazing, from the rice quality to the soup broth (no MSG) and the fresh fish. The rice of a 800 yen restaurant is the same quality as a $$$$ restaurant in America. Where are you gonna find a quality meal for $5.50 pre-tax/tip in America?? Hint: nowhere.",

Photography is STRICTLY prohibited but lordy lord...the colors of the temple (gold and wood) and when we went to see the giant effigy of Fudo Myo, I just so wish I could have taken a photo due to the vibrant colors.\n\nYes the purple banners was one of the highlights of my trip.

If I fly Delta I get to have another layover in Tokyo and in some cases modify to extend the layover up to 2 days - a trick I learned from a friend.  \n\nFYI, your shots are really good.

Japan has a huge problem with this. While the cities are mostly clean, the trash has to go somewhere. Most of it goes into landfills but much of it finds its way into the forests (illegal dumping grounds) or the sea.\n\nThe food is good indeed, but I would stay clear from the convenience store food safe from the occational treat. As everywhere, they are filled with an overabundance of additives and salt. \n\nOther than that, great write-up! I am glad you enjoyed your stay and got everything out of it that you wished.",

Also, thrifting and 'recycle' shops are really quite abundant, so there really is a more ethical and sustainable approach to consumption.",

Plastic overconsumption alone is the perhaps the clearest indicator that all is not well in Japan. \n\nThe fact is that the government has only recently decided to examine policies aimed at reducing plastic rubbish \"after [mainland] China banned the import of such waste\" at the end of 2017. ^1 Prior to that the policy was essentially to offload the problem onto neighbouring countries and, thankfully, the mainland Chinese authorities chose to put a stop to that practice. I say thankfully only because being confronted with this dearth of plastic storage has finally pushed the Japanese government to propose serious measures to reducing single-use plastic consumption. \n\nBut at present, the situation is still quite bad. Aside from superfluous plastic wrapping (for foodstuffs but also non-consumable items like clothing), \"an average Japanese consumer uses as many as 300 to 400 [plastic] bags annually\" ^2 in addition to innumerable plastic bottles that are available from Japan's ubiquitous vending machines. It's unsurprising then that Japan has \"the second-largest per-capita consumption of single-use plastic products, trailing only the United States.\" ^2 \n\n&gt; Just from where I'm from, Japan is already a little ahead with their thrift and recycle culture.\n\nOf course, the situation in Japan may well be an improvement on where you're from. But honestly it could really be doing so much better than it is. And indeed for a country supposedly so \"advanced\" as Japan, reducing plastic consumption should be an attainable goal \u2014 unfortunately for now that hasn't proven to be the case. \n\n-----\n1.

In banning single use plastic bags, we now charge a small fee for thicker \"re-usable\" bags, which usually wear and tear within a handful of uses, then poses a greater risk of extended life in landfill with it being heavier plastics to break down.\n\nThe thrift and recycle culture that I mention is because back home, fast fashion is a grave concern; we are the second largest consumers of textiles in the world, three-quarters of us still toss our fashion away to landfill, and only 15% of the donated items ever make it back into a thrift store - the other 85% of materials that the quarter of the population donate, end up in landfill, anyway.\n\nSpeaking from that comparative perspective, it absolutely impresses me that there is a culture behind thrift stores for fashion and recycle stores for everything from kitchen appliances to lawn mowers, it's not really a very big thing here - the culture of thrift/recycle shopping is still stigmatised where people feel that second-hand is second best and reserved for the less well-off and financially struggling. From that perspective, I find Japan to be considerably ahead in terms of their commitment to a more ethical and sustainable approach in consumption.\n\nAs for plastics, I don't disagree with you that there are leaps and bounds that need to made to reduce the overall waste that ends up in landfall, I never did. There is a huge responsibility on the individual to minimise their carbon footprint and amount of waste we produce. The world needs more social and environmental education on the impact that we have on our planet and we are all responsible from that micro and individual level to do what we can. For that, I'm glad you use your voice to advocate for responsible plastic consumption and hope you are doing your bit in that regard.",

Hayama was the most overwhelmingly exceptional service we experienced on our trip! We booked a room with our own onsen and I'd highly encourage it because it truly topped the stay! The private dining package is a must, too, and we were able to really enjoy the local cuisine this way!",

Sendai is the capital of Miyagi, and most people know it because of the tsunami that struck after the Great East Japan Earthquake on 3/11/2011.  I'd say it's easily worth a couple of days, but many people spend only a day or two here and hit the main tourist spots, like Matsushima Bay, Zuihoden Mausoleum, Aoba Castle's site, and the shopping arcade.  There's plenty of other of things to do, as well, and many things that are convenient from Sendai, like Yamadera or the Nikka Miyagikyo Whiskey Distillery.",

We spent an evening enjoying a home-cooked set meal by the wife-owner of the B&amp;B in the in-house restaurant, when a pianist came to play, and a local jazz band joined her shortly after.

And also Kaminoyama, Hayamakan's Ryokan have a beautiful public onsen and in-room onsen in certain rooms, it was divine to wake up in the freezing cold to a hot spring bath in the mornings! The dining here was also out of this world.",

The place I stayed at in Hakone with open-air private onsen was about $350AUD per night so I wouldn't call that budget travel, either, sorry! \ud83d\ude16 But I did use this website: https://selected-ryokan.com/ryokan/location/tohoku-region\nIt helps with filtering through all of the onsens; which are part of ryokans, which you can hire by the hour privately, which are public only onsens, and it filters by region, so it should give you good selection to choose from.

                            "comment": "The first time I went to Japan was 5 years ago. I visited Tokyo for a week by myself. I was having a mid-life crisis, it was a now or never moment. Somehow I even managed a night at the Park Hyatt...a real Lost in Translation moment and that week was the best thing I ever did. Second time I went for a week to Osaka/Kyoto to meet a good friend that was mid-way through travelling the world. We had an amazing time. The third time I managed to convince my wife and children to make the trip! I was so worried if they would enjoy it or not, but everyone loved it (who wouldn't love Japan!?). We had a week in Tokyo and a week in Kyoto. Well, my next trip is another solo trip...a month during the Rugby World Cup!!! I have 3 tickets to Wales' group games in Toyota City, Oita, and Kumamoto. I'm particilarly excited about visiting Kyushu for a couple of weeks, a whole area of Japan that will be brand-new for me. I see your Australian...unfortunately I could not get a ticket to the Wales v Australia match, but I am thinking of heading to Tokyo anywa, if I don't get a ticket I will hopefully manage to drink a few cold beers with some Welsh/Aussie rugby fans. I can't wait. My only regret is that I waited until I was 40. If i'd gone at half that age there is no doubt that I too would have moved and lived there for a few years as you are thinking about. So on that front I would say DO IT, because once you are settled with kids and a partner then that is going to be much more difficult. Longer reply than I intended :D",

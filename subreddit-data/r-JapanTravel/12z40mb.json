            "comment": "The order seems a bit odd to me. Why go Kyoto -&gt; Takayama -&gt; Kanazawa -&gt; Tokyo? As far as I'm aware, there's no easy, direct route between Kyoto and Takayama. You'd need to go through Nagoya and the total time is over 3 hours. On the other hand, you can take a limited express directly from Kyoto to Kanazawa (JR Thunderbird) which takes only about 2 hours.\n\nNot only that, but Takayama is in between Kanazawa and Tokyo. There is a bus that goes between Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go and Takayama. So your best route would be: Kyoto -&gt; Kanazawa -&gt; Shirakawa-go -&gt; Takayama -&gt; Tokyo. I actually did this in reverse order several years ago. And I think it's still the most efficient route.\n\nAlso, your days are really packed with places to visit. I think this will be a problem especially in Kyoto as public transit isn't as pervasive as in Tokyo and Osaka. How do you intend to get around?\n\nI love going to temples and shrines, and there are certainly many beautiful and significant ones in Kyoto, but aren't you worried you might get burnt out on their appeal from going to several each day?\n\nSome more notes:\n\n* Why visit Kiyomizu-dera twice? I get that one time is for an event, so why not see the rest of the temple grounds on that day? Perhaps rearrange the schedule to put the other things that are nearby in Eastern Kyoto (Day 8) onto the same day?\n* On Day 8, I think you mean Maruyama Park, not Murayama park. They both exist, but the former is a big park in Higashiyama, while the second is a small park in Minami.\n* On Day 10, why go back to Gion at the end? It seems a bit out of order, since you'll be right nearby when you go to Kiyomizu-dera earlier in the day, not to mention that you'll be in that area on Day 8 as well.\n* Some of the places you've chosen, such as Philosopher's Path, are renowned for their cherry blossoms in spring or their autumn leaves. But as you'll be there in late summer/early autumn, you won't see those or the beautiful autumn leaves (they don't usually start changing in Kyoto until November). Since your days are quite packed, you might consider this is a criterion for eliminating some from your itinerary.",

I changed so many things while planning that it just became like this...  \nOriginally I planned to go to Niigata after Kanazawa so it made more sense to do Kyoto --&gt; Takayama --&gt; Shirakawa-go -&gt; Kanazawa --&gt; Niigata.  \nHow long is the bus ride from Takayama to Tokyo? From my search I found that the ride is about 5-6 hrs. By contrast the route from Kanazawa to Tokyo is about 3.5 hrs. I thought this made the most efficient route time-wise.  \nPlease tell me if there is a more time efficient route that I can do!\n\nMy days in Kyoto are indeed packed, I mostly just picked some destinations that I wanted to see and then added some other destinations that were nearby or on the way. I guess I can remove some to make it more doable. Although I do look at my itinerary as more of a general guideline and not something to religiously follow. So if we don't have enough time to do everything, that's fine.  \nWe plan to go around mostly by foot and public transport, and taxi if we have to. Is it doable? Any specific routes that would be more difficult for us to do like this?\n\nRegarding Kiyomizu-dera: The day of the event is probably going to be super packed so I'm worried we won't be able to explore the shrine grounds properly at that time, especially considering that this shrine is already pretty packed on regular days. So my thought was to have a separate day to have a proper visit and then another day just to see the event. \n\nYes, I probably did mean Maruyama Park. This is the park that's in the Yasaka shrine area, right?\n\nTbh I wasn't quite sure where to place Gion as day 8 already seemed pretty packed and I thought it would be late by the time we finished everything else. Day 10 is not as packed I think, so I just added it there, as it's also not that far from Nijo Castle IIRC. When would you suggest I visit it?\n\nPhilosopher's Path is another spot I added bc it was on the way but I can skip it. Are there any other spots that are not worth the visit at that time of year?\n\nThank you for your notes thus far, they're very helpful!",

When I went years ago, I had a stop in Matsumoto in between. Looking again and I see that there's no good way to go directly from Takayama to Tokyo. You either have to connect through Nagoya or do a long highway bus. So perhaps your original plan is better. My apologies.\n\n&gt;My days in Kyoto are indeed packed, I mostly just picked some destinations that I wanted to see and then added some other destinations that were nearby or on the way.

Any specific routes that would be more difficult for us to do like this?\n\nSome of the temples and shrines that are farther afield could be difficult. Taxis would be the fastest way, but bear in mind they can be pretty expensive. Since there are two in your group, splitting the cost, that might not be so bad. I've been to Kyoto a couple times and I've rented a bike to get around. It's still not ideal for some of the longer distances, but it beats walking everywhere.\n\n&gt;Regarding Kiyomizu-dera: The day of the event is probably going to be super packed so I'm worried we won't be able to explore the shrine grounds properly at that time, especially considering that this shrine is already pretty packed on regular days. So my thought was to have a separate day to have a proper visit and then another day just to see the event.\n\nThat might be true, but as you said, it's pretty packed on most days. I've not been to this event, so I can't say how packed it would be.\n\n&gt;Yes, I probably did mean Maruyama Park. This is the park that's in the Yasaka shrine area, right?\n\nIt's right next to Yasaka Shrine. It's most famous for being a hanami spot, but as you'll be there in late summer, there won't be any cherry blossoms. It should still be nice, though I don't think there's a lot to see and do. Just a nice park to hang out in.\n\n&gt;Tbh I wasn't quite sure where to place Gion as day 8 already seemed pretty packed and I thought it would be late by the time we finished everything else. Day 10 is not as packed I think, so I just added it there, as it's also not that far from Nijo Castle IIRC. When would you suggest I visit it?\n\nWhat do you want to do in Gion? If it's nothing special, just wandering around, I think you might get a sense from when you're sightseeing in the area on Day 8. It's not *that* far from Nijo Castle, but it's not exactly close either. According to Google, it's 25 minutes by bus or 45 minutes on foot. If you're looking for something specific to do, Gion Corner is a nice place for some culture. It's a bit commodified for tourists, but you are a tourist, so it's a good place for a sampler of some cultural arts (maiko performance, tea ceremony, etc.)\n\n&gt;Philosopher's Path is another spot I added bc it was on the way but I can skip it. Are there any other spots that are not worth the visit at that time of year?\n\nI'm not sure, as I haven't been to all the places you mentioned. Temples and shrines are of course more beautiful when coupled with blooming cherry blossoms or turning maple leaves, but they are still worth visiting in their own right. My point was that the main attraction of Philosopher's path is the beauty from the trees.\n\nWhat I usually do for these kinds of trips is to make a list of all the places you want to go, add them to your saved places in Google Maps, making note of any special opening hours (many restaurants, for example, have a weekday that they are closed, chosen seemingly at random). Then you can look at your saved places on a map, see which naturally group together and go from there. It seems you've done something similar as yours are generally well grouped by location. Then, when you are in the city, check the map, see what's nearby and what you feel like going to next. If you approach it from a perspective of checking things off a list, you might not enjoy your time as much as if you take things more slowly.",

From what I can see a 7 day pass produces a small saving, a 14 day pass does not but a 21 day pass produces a good saving.  You have a patch between day 9 and 16 where it will be not a lot of value.  I assume when you do the Alpine Route you will use the pass to go to Toyama and then to return from Nagano or Matsumoto.\n\nConsider moving one of your Tokyo days at the end to the start to settle in a bit more.\n\nConsider Tokyo - Osaka - Hiroshima - Kyoto instead of Tokyo - Hiroshima - Osaka - Kyoto.  Same travel distances but breaks up the long journey on day 3.  Osaka and Kyoto are very close.\n\nConsider stopping at Okayama when returning from Hiroshima.  Okayama has one of the top 3 gardens in Japan with a castle next to it.  It's a ten minute local bus from the station and you can leave your bags in lockers at the station.\n\nRather than returning to Kanazawa after the Alpine route consider forwarding your bags to Tokyo hotel and staying overnight at Matsumoto.   It's a popular day trip from Tokyo for the Castle, you could wake up there before going to Tokyo.  You could forward some luggage to the end of the Alpine route.\n\nIf you get a 21 day pass you mother can ride the NXT Express to Narita for free (3100 Yen).  As could you and return if you want.",

Is it actually longer than that? How much shorter would the ride to Osaka be? I feel like since my itinerary for Osaka is packed I need the whole day for it and arriving from Tokyo later in the day would not leave me with a lot of time? But maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlright, I will look into adding Okayma as a stop. How much time would you suggest we dedicate to it?\n\nConsidering that we'll visit Hiroshima castle, Osaka castle and Nijo castle, is it worth adding a visit to Matsumoto castle as well?\n\nThe whole trip comes up as just a little over 21 days, so if we start the JR pass on arrival, we wouldn't be able to use it at the end of the trip or for the ride back to the airport (I will be accompanying my mom to the airport for her departure so for me it'll be a round trip to and from the airport). So the alternative would be to wait a couple of days before activating the pass and pay regular fares for rides (including from the airport to Tokyo on the first day). When do you think we should activate it?",

Your looking at a little over 5 hours using the JR Pass including a change of trains at Osaka.  Not so bad I guess.  Kyoto and Osaka are so close you could easily switch between them.  If your going to Hiroshima from Osaka you could spend the morning there to make up time before you depart.\n\n3 to 4 hours in Okayama.  Check out the garden on YouTube to see if it's worthwhile for you \n\nGood call on the castles.  Matsumoto Castle is one of the few that has not been rebuilt but it's hard to appreciate that looking at it so give it a miss.\n\nYour mention of Nijo Castle jogged my memory.  Go to Nijojo Mai station instead of the one Google suggests.  The Google one puts you close to the place marker and a 15 minute walk.  NIjojo Mai station is close to the entrance, confirm on google maps.\n\nYou have 23 days in Japan so the 21 day pass will leave you 2 days short.  Starting on day 3 makes sense as you will get 3 narita express rides with you returning.  On day 2 you can choose to do things that would not involve the pass, I.e push them back to when you have the pass.",

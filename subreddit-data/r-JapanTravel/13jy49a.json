            "comment": "-Akhibara in Tokyo has lots of anime stores to check out and wander around, we found it was the best area for it. There also lots of arcades where you can win Anime pieces which is fun. \n- Some Onsens will allow you to put tape on your tattoo to cover it, worth checking beforehand. \n- Eko-in Temple was beautiful and up in Koyasan (world heritage site) it costs about \u20ac120 for one night but this includes dinner and breakfast, a meditation in the evening and fire ceremony with the monks in the morning. Took about 2 hours to get there from Osaka and was worth it. (Book through booking.com as the website was hard to use)\n- Fushimi Inari is only 20 mins on the train from Gion and is a beautiful hike up through the Torii gates so for sure worth it. Takes about 3 hours round trip\n- If your going in good weather, hiring a bike is a great idea for Kyoto, Higashiyama is a lovely old district to walk around and in Gion. \n-JR Pass is pricey but worth it travelling around and saving time, when you pick one up you can also buy a Suica card that\u2019s only valid for one month so you don\u2019t have to put down a deposit. \nAlso pocket WiFi was a must and easy to order and pick up in the airport.",

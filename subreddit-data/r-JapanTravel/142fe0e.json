    "postText": "Like others, I'd like to repay valuable advice and info gleaned from this sub. Unlike many on Reddit, we're getting up in years (M 73, F 70).   That didn't keep us from doing just about anything younger people might do. You might consider passing this report along to your parents or other older folks who might be hesitant about taking an independent trip to Japan. \n\nHere are a few highlights before getting to more detailed info in Part Two.\n\n**Biggest surprises**: The quiet.  We never had a noisy hotel experience. People on subways and trains are famously silent and when a car honked near us in Kamakura, a tourist town south of Tokyo, it was a shock.    \nThe pace of change.  For a country renowned for cutting-edge technology, it still clings to some traditional ways.  That goes for more modern habits, like masking (still around 90% in Tokyo subways on our last day), and the bottles of hand sanitizer in every shop doorway, restaurant and other public places.   \nCash isn't king but we definitely needed it, even in Tokyo. Fortunately, getting it was extremely easy.   \nFood was even better than advertised. We're not extreme foodies but we like a good meal; we never had a bad one in four weeks.  \nThe famously efficient transit system was even easier and better than imagined. Taking luggage on subways and trains was never a problem (though we were careful to avoid the worst of rush hour). We took fewer taxis than expected, though when we did they were lifesavers.\n\n**Especially for Geezers**: Our main concession to age was avoiding late nights out. \n\nWe're in reasonably good health, though one of us has minor knee issues.  Escalators and elevators eased our way, occasionally, in public transit, but there was no getting around the ubiquitous stairs. We logged up to 6-to-8 mile (or more) walking days, sometimes going non-stop from morning 'til evening.\n\nTwo pair of comfortable shoes are a good idea, though advice about wearing slip-ons or shoes that don't require tying the laces is perhaps overdone.  I wore my regular Nike jogging shoes and my partner chose On (for the elastic laces).  \n\nBefore leaving home, we took long walks. Don't forget to go up and down as many stairs as you can find.\n\nIf you do your homework, you can find your way around on your own.  The awesome power of the smartphone and the proliferation of signs in English or Romaji, especially in cities, has vastly eased  Japan travel for us gringos (and other gaijin). \n\n**Here's one tip I haven't seen here**: Arguably the best of the old Japan guidebooks in English, \"Gateway to Japan\" (last published in the 1990s), is now available in a digital edition. I downloaded it (for $10US) to the (free) Kindle app on my smartphone and my iPad.  It has all the usual guidebook stuff, including good, historical info and smart ratings on places to see, plus walking tours and shopping and eating advice. It has embedded links to Google Maps that ease navigation. But please note:  it isn't updated as frequently as other sources, so be sure to double-check with Japan Guide (or other online sites) on opening times, fees, etc.\n\n  \n**One other pre-trip tip**: If you're like me, you may be resistant to absorbing often mind-numbing background on the history, culture and traditions of another country.  Shogun, the 1986 bestselling novel by James Clavell (later a motion picture), is an easy way to fix that problem for Japan. Get a library copy or cheap used paperback online. It's very long, but a page turner.  And except for a plot device or two, it's a remarkably accurate portrayal of a key turning point in Japan's development.  If you take the time to read it--and you should--you'll be surprised to discover when you get to Japan that you have a useful understanding of the people and society of today's Japan. \n\n**Trip prep**: We're fairly experienced international travelers, less so in Asia.  I spent six months in the pre-trip phase--which paid dividends in cheaper hotel rooms and tickets to hard-to-get attractions.\n\n I did minimal language prep (about 10 half-hour lessons of Pimsleur's basic Japanese, borrowed from the library) and wish I'd done more.  But even that paid massive rewards. Don't be an Ugly American; learn and use the basic courtesy words and phrases frequently mentioned on this site.  It's easy and goes a long, long way.   My favorite party trick was *Gochis\u014dsamadeshita* (\"thank you for the meal\"), which never failed to elicit a polite response--sometimes a giggle--from restaurant staff.\n\n I'd also underscore three vital tips often found here: Keep your voice down, walk on the left and don't blow your nose in public. \n\nTo narrow our options, I browsed many recent, general guidebooks (from the library) and online sites like Japan Guide and this one. I used Google Docs to compile itinerary and background info (the main itinerary document was about 25 pages long). During the trip, Japan Guide was our go-to reference for up-to-date info and links to individual attractions.\n\n**What we brought or bought:** A sling bag and auxiliary smartphone battery (Anker MagGo for iPhone). I usually ran out of juice on my phone by midday, so the extra battery was a godsend. A stack of old-fashioned cotton handkerchiefs came in handy, since paper products like tissues are quite thin.  We bought tiny folding umbrellas at Family Mart and stashed them in our sling bags on rainy days, along with a plastic bag to protect them when wet; they never failed us.\n\n**What we brought or bought and didn't need:** Yes, it's hard to find places to toss your trash (heed the warnings on this sub) but advice about bringing plastic bags with you seems unnecessary.  You can get bags at konbinis and other stores (they may charge a few pennies); we ended up tossing excess plastic bags at the end of the trip. \n\nWe brought little cloth hand towels, widely used by Japanese people, since public toilets often don't have ways to dry your hands. But we never actually used them.\n\n **Best apps and websites for getting around:** *Japan Travel* from Navitime, loaded before leaving home.  Along with Google Maps and the built-in compass feature on the phone, it made getting around a breeze. We loaded the *Smart-Ex* app for booking bullet trains before leaving and got our first train tickets at a discount.  \n\nBest of all, an IC card. We put *Suica* in our Apple Wallet, loaded with some yen before leaving home, and loved it.  Be advised: *Suica* and *Smart-Ex* sometimes conflict in real life, requiring help from station personnel to get you through the gate.  If you want to avoid that, download and print the QR code for your train ticket.  \n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency website and Weather dot com offer very reliable, up-to-date forecast info.\n\n**Cellphones:** For various reasons, we used a combination of Verizon's fairly new $100 International Monthly Plan (250 minutes of phone, 250 messages and unlimited highspeed data for first 20GB) and Ubigi's $17 eSim.  The Verizon was a mixed bag; it did let me use my phone as a hotspot but the quality of the signal depended on the local partner; I counted at least three--SoftBank, au and Docomo. I switched between my cellular plans, depending on signal strength in a location. Using my phone exclusively for navigation and web searching, I never hit the Verizon limit and needed about half the Ubigi 10GB.\n\n**Getting there**: We chose to fly Premium Economy for the first time, mainly for comfort on the 13-hour flight, and found it worth the considerable extra expense. We're also glad we went non-stop (ANA), even though it meant spending the first night in Tokyo before zipping off to Kyoto. \n\n**Expenses:** About $15K (USD) for 28 nights, not including airfare to and from Japan.  This was our first overseas trip in more than 3.5 years, due to the pandemic, so we splurged a bit.\n\nWe spent almost a month and only scratched the surface. How we went about picking places to stay, see or eat, and some of the ones we especially liked, will be highlighted in Part II of this report, coming soon.",

Having a physical card certainly works, but that's one more thing you have to carry and fish out (many times a day).  And refilling it means going to a machine in the station.  That's a lost of time and trouble.\n\nIf you don't have a Mastercard or Amex account and can open one for free, it's worth it. You can reload the IC card (Suica or PASMO seem to be the most popular) anywhere you are, using your phone.\n\nI did experience some problems filling my Suica with my Ubigi eSim when I was out and about; having the Verizon account as a backup did the trick and never failed me.",

Only thing I would add which I haven\u2019t seen anyone else mention in this sub, to do a little less walking: \n\nUse a bike share app like Hello-cycling (available in almost all the major cities - you can use Pippa in Kyoto). All hello cycling bikes are e-bikes and you can use one account to rent multiple bikes (Pippa is regular bikes and you\u2019ll need one account per person).\n\nYou\u2019ll need a Japanese phone number to sign up for the bike share apps (to receive a text code). So the best option is to get the Mobal travel SIM - around $60 USD which gives you unlimited calling and texting and 7 GB of data per month (it resets at the beginning of each month so if your travel goes across a month like May-June, you\u2019ll get 14 GBs of data). Or if you have a friend in Japan, just use their number to receive the text code.\n\nMobal is obviously more expensive than Ubigi/Airalo eSIMs. But paying a little extra to save my feet was worth it IMO (and biking was sometimes faster than public transport to get to certain places). My favourite part of each day was biking through and discovering little neighbourhoods I otherwise never would\u2019ve seen.\n\nOP - You got me intrigued by the Shogun book. Gonna pick it up and give it a read!",

Shogun, the 1986 bestselling novel by James Clavell (later a motion picture), is an easy way to fix that problem for Japan. Get a library copy or cheap used paperback online. It's very long, but a page turner. And except for a plot device or two, it's a remarkably accurate portrayal of a key turning point in Japan's development. If you take the time to read it--and you should--you'll be surprised to discover when you get to Japan that you have a useful understanding of the people and society of today's Japan.\n\nNo, Shogun is -not- accurate by any means. Shogun is historical fiction inspired by some (important) historical figures and events, with good research background research to support it, but many stuff (the majority?) is completely invented, all names are changed, key events are randomized, ignored or invented, the motivations or power influence of the characters very deeply differ from the motivations of their historical counterparts.\n\nIt's a very good read, sure, just like Last Samurai is an entertaining movie. It's probably \"closer to reality\" than Last Samurai (debatable), but you need to be very careful and definitely not take it at face value.",

I didn't mean to imply that it is anything more than historical fiction.  The names are changed but my understanding is that most key figures in the book are based on easily identifiable historical figures. The novel also conveys a lot of information about Japanese history and culture.  The point I was trying to make is that reading \"Shogun\" is a useful way of learning about Japan for tourists who might otherwise know nothing about the place and people they are visiting.",

In the book, \"Ishido\" is a member of said council, plotting against \"Toranaga\". In reality, Ishida (=Ishido) was not a member of the council and was way, way, less influential than the book's Ishido. Tokugawa (=Toranaga) was by far the most powerful of the lot with little internal opposition (almost none after Maeda's death in 1599). If anything, Tokugawa was the \"plotter\" to usurp Toyotomi's power, and succeeded. Also, the castle of Hideyoshi was quite different from the way Osaka castle looks nowadays (this reproduction is based on a castle of a later period).\n\nThat's why this book is at the same time very good but requires a bit of caution, and it can be difficult to draw the line between fact and fiction as it's so well written.",

                    "comment": "Sorry for delay. I know there are other, cheaper ways to go. In fact, a Ubigi eSim plan (assuming your phone is compatible) is really all you need. (or, if need be, a physical SIM card). I wanted to try out the Verizon plan, in part, in case the two of us got separated, like in a busy train station, and a quick phone call would be needed to reconnect. We did text a few times when that happened but no call. Yes, again, I know there are other ways to do that (Skype, What\u2019s App and LINE\u2014which we did use to communicate with Japanese friends). I just figured the added cost ($200) was basically a rounding error in an expensive trip and opted for familiarity and convenience. Plus, contacts at home could call us as needed (in the end we only got one call).  Having two cellular plans was an unexpected bonus for two reasons: first, when one of the plans had poor connectivity\u2014a problem if you are navigating through a strange city\u2014I could switch to the other (this happened, though not too often) and, bingo, back online. Also, at a certain point,  my bank/credit cards didn\u2019t seem to want to accept my Suica topups when the signal came from Ubigi; switching to Verizon in those cases was a perfect fix.",

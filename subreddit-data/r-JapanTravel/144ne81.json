    "postText": "my friends and i are visiting japan in august (yes yes i know the heat the humidity, it's okay i'm used to that weather), and for one morning, i'm considering todoroki valley. wondering if the ravine and gotokuji temple are worth it- i have one day on the itinerary to go around a couple places towards west tokyo, but not too far out from shibuya as we're spending midday there. this is what i'm thinking so far for the day:\n\n\\-todoroki valley and Setsugetsuka teahouse in the morning before shops and everything open\n\n\\-head to gotokuji temple (is there anything else around there / is it worth walking around a bit? i know there are a couple shrines like shoin, but wondering if it'd be worth taking some time to walk around. i'm trying to make this temple worth it because its so cute lol)\n\n\\-head to shibuya and explore during the day (we have a different night for shibuya at night, so this time during the day will be more focused on the stores my friend wants to go to, the few shrines around, sitting inside for a cool meal, and then the nighttime visit will be more about seeing the lights and bar hopping and stuff)\n\n\\-head to kichijoji for the ghibli museum (assuming we can get afternoon tickets but i'm hopeful) and spend the evening exploring the area and harmonica alley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso thoughts on this day's itinerary? when things are often closed in the mornings, that's when i think it'd be good to head to a park and shrine. we're not huge on shopping, at least not for hours at a time, so i wasn't really considering Shimokitazawa here. but if the ravine and gotokuji arent worth the time, what else would you suggest, especially if this is when we wanna do ghibli museum + kichijoji evening? fyi this would be on a weekday",

It makes for a decent detour from the Ghibli museum but there\u2019s no other reason to go that far out in my opinion and a bit out of the way if you\u2019re not close by. If I remember correctly the cats are bought at the shrine as a good luck charm for something you want to do or achieve and once you achieve it you bring the cat statue back and display it.",

Not exactly close together.\n\nNot much of a suggestion, but Oyamadai station, near the ravine, has quite a few nice patisseries/bakeries that would do well for a late breakfast. [Vent de Lundo](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1317/A131715/13140110/) and [Au Bon Viewx Temps](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1317/A131715/13181654/) being a couple favourites.\n\n&gt; Setsugetsuka teahouse\n\nSmall correction, but I'm sure you mean Setsugekka teahouse",

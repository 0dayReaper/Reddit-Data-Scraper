    "postText": "Hello! Itinerary check for an October trip to Tokyo with 2 adults and a 10 year old. We are staying at an apartment hotel with a full kitchen and fridge in asakusa so all breakfasts and some other meals will primarily be in the room to provide a rest (and because my kid is a picky eater). The adults have been to Tokyo before and have done a lot in shinjuku/shibuya and have already seen lots of temples and historical sites there. This trip is more focused on family activities and brings the three of us will all enjoy. It\u2019s also my 10 year olds first international trip. We are interested in animals, pokemon, amusement/theme parks, fun and games, and history. My main questions are whether this is overly ambitious, or whether things may be arranged in a way that do not make sense transportation/efficiency wise. Thanks in advance for any input. \n\n\nFriday \n-Arrive at airport at 3:00PM\n-Get to Hotel, grocery store, walk around a bit and go to bed.\n \nSaturday\n-Visit Sensoji Temple, shops and area\n-MameShiba Caf\u00e9 Asakusa (I know reviews say the dogs only hang with the regulars but we would be happy just to watch them - we just love Shiba Inus)\n-Head back to hotel for lunch in room\n-Walk to Asakusa Rox for Arcades and batting cages\n-Dinner at Local restaurant or 7-11 meal in room \n \nSunday\n-Pokemon Caf\u00e9 Ginza Brunch (If I can get reservations) and Pokemon Center\n-Go straight to Akihabara\n-Akihabara Arcades and Owl Caf\u00e9\n-Back to hotel for dinner in room\n-Asakusa Hanyashiki amusement park at night\n \nMonday (Sports Day)\n-Hike Mount Takao (will it be too crowded on Sports day?)\n \nTuesday\n-Ikebukuro Sunshine City Pokemon Mega Store, Pokemon Go area, Gachapon store\n-Head back to Asakusa hotel for lunch/rest in room\n-Tokyo Skytree\n-Possibly back to Asakusa Rox Arcades\n-Dinner at Local restaurant or 7-11 meal in room\n \nWednesday\n-Send Luggage to Disneyland Hotel.\n-Pack daypacks with one change of clothes and toiletries for next day.\n-Go to Teamlab Planets in the morning \n-Check into TDL hotel at 4:30.\n-Buy TDL evening weeknight pass. \n-Eat in park and maybe see parade\n \nThursday\n-Disney Sea all day\n \nFriday\n-Early entry at TDL\n-Ride 3 rides we do not have in USA\n-Be on airport limo bus by 2PM at the latest to head to airport for 5PM flight home\n \nSome other things I\u2019d like to fit in if any of the above aren\u2019t a good idea include Toyosu fish market, ninja cafe, any parks or outdoor areas. I also wanted to go to the edo Tokyo museum to bring in some history but I know that it has closed. Is there anything similar we should check out?\n\nThank you in advance for your thoughts!",

As you can imagine, keeping 20 nocturnal birds in a tiny room together all day, with their feet chained to a pole, for the amusement of tourists, is not the most humane way to spend your vacation. Even more so considering owls are not generally tolerant of human interaction in the first place.",

I might in your case depending on how much stuff you have, just bring something carry on sized to Disney and send anything larger to the airport.\n\nI really liked the Disneyland Hotel.  It's an easy walk from Maihama.\n\nIf you can't get into the Pokemon Cafe and really want to eat something Pokemon themed, you can go to Pokemon Sweets in Ikebukuro.  It doesn't take reservations.  Be warned the food at the Pokemon Cafe is decidedly mediocre.  I am so glad my tween no longer requires us to eat there.  I'd also try to book for a non-week end/non-holiday day to up my chances of success, or if you can manage trying multiple times for ressies, try multiple times.  It's really hard to get in now!",

The food is just sort of OK and we're also both vegetarians and the Pokemon Cafe does not cater to dietary restrictions.  If your family is REALLY into Pokemon, it might still be worth it.  I've gone to the Tokyo one a good 2 or 3 times and once to the Osaka one.  My kid is now more fond of the Kirby Cafe (we went in January 2023) and we're going again in about a month (just booked.)  We're doing a Summer only Pokemon food event or I would recommend trying that, though it costs considerably more than the Pokemon Cafe.  Japan does get different food pop-ups sometimes.  \n\nI love museums.. my tween not so much.  I admit in Tokyo we tend to mostly shop and see friends.  We go to a lot of Pokemon Centers.  I generally take her to other locations for temple and shrines.  We did the Sailor Moon exhibit in December (it's now closed) and Team Lab Planets in December (she hated it.)  I think she would like the Edo Tokyo Museum but it is closed now.  I might see if there is a weirder or smaller museum she might enjoy more.\n\nWe have never done a ninja experience in Tokyo, but we did do one elsewhere.  Ours involved a lot of physical activities which I was horrible at and my daughter still gets to laugh at how much I sucked as a ninja and barely passed ninja school.  \n\nWe currently have 4 almost full days in Tokyo for our next trip (and 2 TDR days)   But we're going in the Summer, so I know it will be hot and humid.",

It is likely to have something, since it has a big shopping center (Lalaport) connected to it.\n\nI have to either drop our bags at Tokyo Station in a storage place or go to the Ambassador to leave bags, before a special tea in Tokyo, because I just don't want to have to find a storage place near our tea.  So I do get it.  \n\nIf you're willing to separate, one of you could go early and just drop everything off in Maihama at the Disney Resort Welcome Center (opening at 7:30 am) and they will deliver all items to your room for free.\n\n[https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/hotel/dh/service\\_deluxe.html#pbBlock4199106](https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/hotel/dh/service_deluxe.html#pbBlock4199106)\n\n(I can't use it because we travel with a violin and I am sure they will qualify it as \"breakable.\")",

I have heard that check in queues at the hotel can be 30 mins plus.\n\nWould we be able to go to the Welcome Centre at Maihama station and check in and get our Happy 15 passes for the next day there so we don\u2019t even need to go to our hotel reception at all? (Would just get a shuttle bus from there to Ambassador once finished at DisneySea that night).",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! This sub was so incredibly helpful to me in the planning process - I was deeply grateful for everything I learned, so I thought I'd post a trip report now that we're back!\n\n**About us:** We're a 30s couple from the Midwest US. We're pretty experienced travelers (South America, UK/Ireland, Europe, lots of places in the US), but this was our first visit to Asia and first visit to Japan. As travelers, we love getting out on foot, local food/drink (especially street food), live music, nerd shit, weird art/vending machines. Also, my partner is a cis guy, but I am a trans masc person who is visibly trans (post-op in a few ways, but not passing/not stealth).\n\n**Dates:** May 13 - May 29\n\n**What we did:** Tokyo | Kyoto | Osaka | Hakone | Back to Tokyo \n\n**Tips and tricks:**\n\n* Definitely get your walking training in ahead of time! We walked 10 miles a day on the trip. We're pretty avid backcountry camping/hiking fans who regularly put in 8 - 10 miles on the trail (not to mention taking our dog for multiple walks a day in the neighborhood), so I figured we'd be good - but it was A LOT, especially since you're also trying to translate and navigate at the same time. Japan is not generally a super accessible place from a disability perspective; benches and public seating areas are not common. I found myself wishing I'd packed a collapsible seat of some kind, tbh!\n* Good shoes a must! Merrell Moabs are my go-to for hiking, but for this trip I went with Nike Dunk 6 high-tops, which rocked. My partner went with Onitsukas and didn't do as well - he wound up buying inserts partway through the trip, which helped. \n* Work on a little Japanese ahead of time! We came in with about a dozen words/phrases, which was honestly truly helpful. So many people are so kind and thoughtful anyway, but it was an appreciated gesture that we had planned ahead and were trying our best. Google Translate's camera feature (Google Lens) was a life-saver for translating written words on signs!\n* We had a great experience with Ubigi for an eSIM. The days of purchasing an actual SIM card or even a burner device (like we used to do when backpacking in Europe) are long past. We hooked up our Ubigi eSIMs beforehand, flipped the switch when we got there, and we were golden. Just in case, we'd set up our Verizon coverage to include a Pay-As-You-Go international plan, but we didn't  end up using it. We also didn't use half as much data as we thought we would - we both came home with extra GB on our Ubigi plan still. We didn't do a PocketWifi and I don't think we needed it - Ubigi did most of the heavy lifting, and free WiFi at various places did the rest.\n* Fly into Haneda, not Narita - way closer to Tokyo city center.\n* Get your Suica right away at the airport - our beloved Suica got us through so many things! We also withdrew some cash and split it up between us - we withdrew a few more times on the trip and it worked like a charm. (Just make sure it's an international ATM that includes your card type - not all of them do. Also, notify your bank you'll be traveling, so your card doesn't throw a flag!) We used our credit card as well - the Chase card was accepted pretty much all places CCs are, but many places remain cash-only, especially bars and restaurants.\n* Had a great experience using the Friendly Limousine Airport Bus service straight from Haneda to our hotel area.\n* I booked shinkansen tix ahead of time, so I got nice discounts on weekday Green Car tix for two - but I really needn't have worried, there were plenty of seats available day-of.\n* Don't bother with shinkansen for Kyoto to Osaka - we wound up just hopping on a local with our Suicas and it was fine.\n* Don't bother with the Romancecar from Hakone back to Tokyo - it's faster/maybe a nicer seating experience, but just hopping on a local with your Suica is an order of magnitude cheaper.\n* Look things up in Japanese if using Google Translate; use Tabelog for restaurants if possible. Google Maps in English is more touristy reviews/reactions. \n* Tokyo Skytree was hit-or-miss - only real letdown of the trip.\n* Tokyo teamLab PLANETS was completely worth it - absolutely worth the hype in my opinion. \n* Queer and trans travelers - I felt completely safe, but as a plus-size trans masc nonbinary queerdo, I stuck out like a sore thumb. I didn't feel in danger, but I was absolutely aware that I did not fit in. Stares were common, especially from older men and young kids. (Weirdly, local women seemed more friendly and curious about me!) Just be prepared for it and remember you're not in any danger physically - it's all just curiosity. \n* I have to thank this subreddit for recommending Hakone, especially for the tip to book a ryokan with private onsen access. We had an absolutely beautiful experience at Yamanochaya in Hakone, which included both a private \"onsen\" soaking tub in our room and private 1:1 access to a larger, actual hot spring onsen on the property. I otherwise would not have been able to experience a real hot spring onsen at all, as they are gender-segregated.

There are ryokan with onsen that allow this. It\u2019s reserving the shared onsen for just your group. Usually for an hour with a small charge. We did this for 1000 yen as we couldn\u2019t find an affordable place with in-room access. \n\nMy partner is cis and neither of us are comfortable with being naked around strangers for our own reason. It made a big difference!\n\nMy own non-binary experience when I go to Japan is feeling the heavy weight of conformity. I found it especially hard in Tokyo because people are so uniform there, even in a huge metropolis. In contrast Kyuushuu folks felt much more laidback.\n\nBack when I lived there a long time ago, I wasn\u2019t even out about being queer and it was tough. Things are changing on that front a lot in Japan though, which has been heartening.",

We saw this option too later but decided to go with the all-inclusive ryokan vibe instead - but this can totally work too. \n\nAnd YES re: the conformity - that's exactly right, exactly the right word, especially in a really gender-segregated environment. It took me until probably the end of my trip to really start to pick up on the little signs and signals of non-conformity or gender-creativity around me. Kind of an isolating place to be a fat trans masc/nonbinary weirdo, but again at least I didn't feel in any danger physically.",

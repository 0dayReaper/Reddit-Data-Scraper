    "postText": "Two 26M went to Tokyo-Osaka-Kyoto-Nara-Tokyo. It was both of our first time in Japan. We had a fabulous time and the following are some things we noticed along the way.\n\n\n-MASKS. Check the rules before you depart for Japan and follow them. I\u2019m an American living in Europe so I haven\u2019t had to wear a mask in quite some time but it was an easy transition to get used to them again.\n\nAlso I noticed Tokyo and Kyoto had very strict mask policy adherence while I saw many foreigners and Japanese unmasked in Osaka and Nara. Just my experience on the days I was there.\n\n- ITINERARY. if it\u2019s your first time going like it was mine, be realistic with your itinerary and leave time to enjoy the areas you visit, not just check it off the list. \n\nI had a pretty detailed itinerary mapped out I shared on this sub, but I found planning multiple neighborhoods per day to be unrealistic and had to adjust. I like to take my time browsing every shelf of an entire 6 story Animate shop then wait in that hour long line for the best omurice in the neighborhood. Before you know it the day is gone and you\u2019ve only done maybe half your itinerary. Save the rest for next time and really soak in your surroundings.\n\nLastly in relation to planning, let life happen. My first day in Kyoto I met a Japanese girl and we hit it off instantly. Scheduled a date for that night and we didn\u2019t get back to her place until 5 in the morning which led me to sleep almost all day. That was 2 of my 4 kyoto days gone. I was originally worried about not getting to see everything on my list but decided it can all just wait for my next trip. She did take me to Kiyomizu for hot sake and the temple illuminations on my third day which is something I hadn\u2019t even heard of. So basically, let life happen and if you\u2019re a planner and worrier like me, just reassure yourself it\u2019s okay to deviate and go with the flow.\n\n\n-Japanese POSITIVE ENERGY we received. From the young arcade worker who took 45 minutes of his time to set us up accounts so we could play the gundam pilot sim game when it\u2019s clearly supposed to be a do-it-yourself process that we couldn\u2019t figure out , to the old shop keepers that would return the deep bows I gave them after asking many questions about their goods, everyone was super kind. The other mid-20s people we met out at night said mostly everybody they knew was thrilled to have foreigners back around. Hearing different languages, sharing energy. Everybody just seemed excited. I heard rumors the older folk were the most vocal about not wanting to reopen but the older folk I had chance encounters with were all super friendly. Probably a little selection bias. One time a old man was pushing his wife in a wheelchair and couldn\u2019t get it up over the edge of the sidewalk so my friend and I grabbed each side and lifted her up on real quick. Tons of bows and thank yous and smiles ensued it was very sweet moment.\n\n- NAVIGATION. Everywhere I read said Google maps is my best friend but Google maps led me to the wrong place twice. If you have iPhone, I used Apple Maps the entire time after Google let me down and Apple Maps was flawless and way more intuitive for me. As for translate I just used basic phrases and hand gestures and never needed it for human interaction but the camera function on Google translate for signs and menus is fabulous.\n\n-PHONES. Last thing I want to mention is phone service in Japan. I bought a Sakura mobile 15 day 4G SIM and couldn\u2019t get it to work the first few days. After re configuring the APN settings and restarting my iPhone it worked like a charm. If you opt to get a SIM in Japan, make sure you follow the directions to configure these setting exactly as described by your provider.\n\nMy first trip was a beautiful experience and I\u2019m already looking into booking my next one. Maybe for colder months since I was sweating walking around in November! If anybody planning to go soon has specific questions let me know.",

She worked in Australia at that time and was visiting her family. He went back to his life in New Jersey. They remained in constant communication , he was smitten! Anyway, it was not easy, there were continents between them but they are now married, living in Hawaii with a lovely baby girl :) Everyone's story is different but it's happened in my family and it was all from them meeting each other that night in tokyo.",

I also had a friend who was an old homeless guy. He lived in the Yokohama eki.   He was in World War II. I spoke little Japanese then and he spoke no English at all.  His Japanese was also something that the young people could barely translate because the language transformed quite a bit after the war.  He was my best friend and we didn't need to talk much.  We pointed and drew pictures and laughed like jackasses. I loved him so much.  Anyway, back to the girl.  She saw me with Gramps one day and asked me about it.  I said that he is my best friend. She gave me one of those sour looks and kind of said that she didn't want to be seen with him.  I politely hugged Megumi and said that I could not be friends with someone like her.  She was really very confused and mad.  I hopped on the bus to the eki, found Gramps and we ate ice cream at Ducks Do.  Seems like it was ice cream with mousse and corn flakes in it.    Anyway, it was good.  I really don't miss the girl, but Gramps passed away long ago and I think of him at least once a week still.",

He ended up being friendly and took photos for us. \n\nAnyway don't blame Megumi too much, it's a terrifying world for japanese women. Have you read the case of Junko Furuta and seen the women only carriages in Japan? \n\nWomen are usually treated like second class citizens too. My colleague said she was a developer (not a clerk or secretary) and was met with shock by the all male professional devs she was talking to. It was unthinkable that a woman could amount to much - to them, they are babymakers meant to stay at home or support men only. \n\nAlso in japan the old men are in power on the hierachy.

Keep in mind there\u2019s way more than just anime shops and there\u2019s tons of food all around. I definitely thought that was going to be more like a 2 hour experience.\n\nAlso you\u2019re in the right track. There were some things I wanted to see and buy I put off or said I\u2019d come back for, and ended up running out of time and couldn\u2019t go back for it. Carpe diem I suppose!",

I think generally speaking the stuff at Nakano Broadway also represents a different niche of retro that isn\u2019t as popular in the states. Tbh you\u2019re more likely finding cowboy bebop merchandise at American stores. I saw a hot topic selling bebop stuff lol\n\nAnd then stores like Animate in Akihabara/Ikebukuro pretty much only stock whatever is most popular at the moment, so you may even have difficulties finding merch for a series that was popular just a couple of years ago",

The arrival lines are long and staffed with a hundred people and stantions and snake around but have no actual purpose. Just flash your QR code so you gotta keep phone out a hundred times. They actually only scan it at immigration. QR code for customs also had massive lines, but paper was empty. I arrived at 10:30 AM T1 from Seoul.\n\nJust came back to Seoul today. 11 AM flight, arrived at airport at 9 AM.\n\nTHERE ARE NO SOUVENIR SNACKS OR FOOD OR CAFE to easily access. Only one of each of those types of places are open. The Family Mart by the gates had 50 people in line, and same for the only cafe open. \n\nLiterally only the side with gates 1-17 or so are open, so that also meant MASSIVE queues to board the shuttle. \n\nBuy all your goodies before you get to the airport. I\u2019ve been to Osaka af least oh 5-6 times over the years and THE AIRPORT definitely felt like when I visited America recently\u2026just a mess.",

But, I need to get this off my chest.\r  \n\r  \nThis is my 3rd time in Japan. I've been here for almost a month right now, visiting a bunch of different cities, and after the first few days I've almost completely stopped wearing a mask (the exception being packed trains).\r  \n\r  \nOut of the dozens and dozens of stations, shops, supermarkets and hotels I've been in, I have only been asked to wear a mask a total of 3 times. Two of them were at a game center, and one was at a caf\u00e9.\r  \n\r  \nAnd guess what? Besides those rare occurrences, nobody goddamn cares. Nobody avoids standing next to me or sitting next to me on the train. Nobody stares at me or gives me the stink eye. I speak Japanese well enough and frequent some of these places, so the \"oh they won't say anything because they're afraid he doesn't understand Japanese\" excuse doesn't work. And if you spend enough time here you'll know that when a rule really needs to be enforced, it *will* be, language barrier be damned.\r  \n\r  \nHow many of you have friends here, or know how this culture works? Besides a small subset of people, nobody I've spoken to is wearing their mask because of fear of COVID. It's literally only because they don't want to be seen sticking out and being judged by others around them (super no no in this society). They're waiting for the day when there's either solid guidance from a higher power (not the wishy washy guidance the government put out) or enough people have stopped wearing them to hit a critical mass. There's also a subset of people who wore masks anyways before COVID, either to hide their face (no makeup) or for other reasons. They'll keep masking no matter what.\r  \n\r  \nI get tourists trying to be respectful while they're here and don't fault them for wearing the masks if they want to, especially if they don't know the culture or language enough.\n\n\rHowever, this whole holier-than-thou \"you stupid other foreigners, stop being stupid or you'll anger my sacred Japan and we won't allowed here anymore!\" attitude on this sub needs to stop. It's unnecessarily toxic, and further perpetuates the whole idea that Japan is this super special place with no faults. Just enjoy your trip.  \n\r  \ntl;dr - \r  \nMask rules are hardly enforced, most Japanese people don't want to wear them but keep them on to save face, if you want to wear one when you're not sick that's fine but don't assume you're better than others or that Japanese people care that much about you over their own daily lives.",

Your average Hanako who's never set foot outside the country and worldview is shaped by Japanese media will still continue being fearful.\r  \n\r  \nI should have mentioned it in my original post, but I am not some antivaxxer nut by any means. I wore my mask all the time in 2020-2021, followed all health guidelines, and then lined up and got my shots as soon as I could in my country. I caught it twice as well.\r  \n\r  \nIt's 2022 and Japan had to be massively pressured to open up again. Despite no borders open and high mask compliance, there was that huge wave earlier in the summer. Presumably we're all triple (or double + test) vaccinated to even arrive into this country. \n\nSo what are we doing at this point? Our individual actions are hardly going to matter in the long run. Everything is theatre and the general populace just thinks *shouganai*.\n\nAgain, wear your mask if you want to and be respectful when you need to be. I've never told a single person to take off their mask here and don't plan to, I'm just making an individual choice. And just because I'm not wearing a mask most of the time (and I'm not the only one), doesn't mean I'm some Logan Paul wannabe.",

I live here, I know how this culture works. The people I talk to here more or less don't complain about the masking. In fact I can't recall anything outside of normal conversation as if you were asking someone about the brand of hat they wear or grabbing an umbrella before coming out the door.   \nSome people are just going through the motions for sure, but others are very conscientious of when and around whom they wear a mask or not. Wearing a mask outside or not is your choice and the government has said as much, but in enclosed spaces it is asked that you do. If you aren't doing that, you aren't being polite even if you legally don't have to and no one has said something to you about it.",

I kept telling him thank you and I\u2019d take it from here after every step and he insisted on seeing it through and then watched us play our first match lol. Just seemed like he really loved the games where he worked and was excited to share. \n\nI shit you not you need to charge the game card with 100 yen coins or a Suica and he asked if  we had coins. At that point I didn\u2019t have many and said no so he busted out his wallet and unzipped the coin pouch like he was going to load it for me. Luckily I saw the Suica symbol and showed him my card on my phone and he started laughing and used my phone to charge the game card for me. Like the most helpful sweet behavior you could imagine.",

I can\u2019t emphasize how much I underestimated the size of every city and how much time it would take to do everything. \n\nI\u2019m happy with how my trip turned out though. Make an itinerary with 1 neighborhood/district/ ward per day or so and then adapt it as you go. There where entire neighborhoods I had to miss because I wanted to really take my time and browse stores, sit around and people watch at temples and parks, etc and just didn\u2019t have enough time. BUT for a first trip 5 days per city besides ibaraki which I\u2019m unfamiliar with was a good amount to dip my toes in and poke around different parts of each city so now I can plan my next trip more targeted to the areas I enjoyed the most to get a deeper dive.\n\nI budgeted and used 130usd per night on hotels for a comfortable business hotels and about 1000/ week on spending money for food and souvenirs, and 300 dollars  total for Shinkansen round trip Tokyo-kyoto and trains within the cities for 2 weeks. Food was surprisingly cheap.",

It was quite nice for a one off experience. We paid a little extra to go into the feeding room of the whale sharks which lets you walk on scaffolding around the perimeter of the insanely large and deep tank the 2 whale sharks live in.

I think everyone your likely to come in contact with as a tourist (hotel workers, shop owners, bartenders) are happy to have people back and were way more outgoing than I anticipated. I always try to give positive vibes and be open to whatever and people can sense those things even through language barriers so it all came pretty natural. I spoke to one other tourist my entire time. Her and her friend sat next to me and mine at a sushi bar near Nakano and they chatted us up for a bit but other than that it was all interactions with Japanese.",

When I arrived in Narita I took the Narita Express to Shinjuku. Google Maps told me to exit early and transfer to the Marunouchi line. When I exited I tried to transfer and it gave me a bunch of red lights. Panicked, I tried going back to the NEX, but it already left so ended up using this fare adjusting machine I found and then used my Passmo card to board the Marunouchi line. Granted at the time I didn\u2019t know better but I found out when I got home I should\u2019ve just stayed on because the NEX train goes direct to Shinjuku. \nIt messed up a few other directions and walking directions were kind of confusing. \nOhh leaving was as bad too. It told me to take a local line from Shinjuku to Shibuya and then board the Narita Express to Narita. I get to Shibuya and it tells me to just board the Narita Express. No mention of tickets. Knowing there are tickets I exit and frantically find a machine to buy an NEX ticket and then go back in to the station and wait for the NEX. Also when I got home I found out I could\u2019ve just boarded at the Shinjuku station. \nNext time I go, I\u2019ll give Apple Maps a try.",

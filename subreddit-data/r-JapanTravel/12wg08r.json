    "postText": "The third ryokan is Asadaya in Kanazawa. This was the most traditional so far. The caveat being that they do not have an onsen. The property only has four rooms total. I stayed in Takao which was far smaller than my previous two rooms.\n\nA small foyer branches into two directions. Right goes to the bathroom with shower. Left is the living/sleeping space with sliding doors that open to a sitting area which offers views of a garden. The intimacy added to the ryokan feel which I welcomed.\n\nThere's a dedicated welcoming room where tea and wagashi is served. I say dedicated because I was invited to sit next to a special apparatus designed specifically to make tea and there's nothing else in the room.\n\nKaiseki dinner was served in a different room with great views of a much better garden. The owner also dropped in to greet me. I was introduced to ishiyaki which was cool. Breakfast next morning was served in yet another room with views of yet another garden.\n\nAfter my experience with Gora Kadan, I was curious if Asadaya would match their level of service so I made a request for them to retrieve a shinkansen ticket. They refused. I am not deducting points here because Kadan really went above and beyond.\n\nMore importantly, the service was excellent. The public bath (not hot spring water) is only big enough for one so guests have to schedule at checkin. I am only interested in hot springs and it didn't quite fit my schedule so I declined. They reiterated the offer throughout my stay without being pushy which is a delicate balance not everyone has mastered. I had mentioned that I get cold easily during booking. Upon my return from dinner, I found an extra blanket laid out and the heat cranked up. They also had a branded thermos as a welcoming gift.\n\nTwo things in particular stood out and both occurred after the stay. I had opted to walk to the station whose shortest path required me to pass through Omicho Market. If the reader is unfamiliar, it's an incredibly boisterous and crowded area. I got lost in it the day before. One of the staff escorted me through the quagmire so that I just have to walk straight thereafter. Saves a headache when you have a train to catch.\n\nThen the following day I receive an email. In addition to thanking me for my stay, it revealed that they will keep records of the food I liked/disliked, the pillow I preferred, and the size of my yukata so that I would feel at home on my next stay. Very impressed.\n\nYou can book it via their website and staff speaks enough English.\n\nPictures: https://imgur.com/a/fHyvj14",

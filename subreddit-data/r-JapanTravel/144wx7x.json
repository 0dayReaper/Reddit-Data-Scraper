    "postText": "Hello! So I'm going to be visiting Japan with my family (my parents and my younger sister) in late November this year. I've created a rough idea of what we'd like to do and would love to hear some suggestions, mainly help on whether this itinerary is going to be possible or not. This is my first time creating an itinerary and also our first time going to Japan.\n\nDay 1 (Tokyo - Arrival)\n\n* Arrival at 6pm\n* Go to hotel (not yet booked)\n* Since we arrived relatively late, we will just use this day to settle in and sort all the necessary things (pocket wi-fi, find local convenience store, money conversion etc.)\n\nDay 2 (Tokyo)\n\n* 9:00am - Tokyo Imperial Palace\n* 11:00am - Asakusa\n* 4:00pm - Ueno Park/Ameyoko Street\n* 6:00pm - Akihabara\n* 8:00/8:30pm - Go back to hotel\n\nDay 3 (Tokyo)\n\n* Disney Sea\n\nDay 4 (Tokyo)\n\n* 9:00am - Meiji Jingu\n* 10:30am - Yoyogi Park\n* 12:00pm - Explore Shibuya\n* 4:00pm - Explore Shinjuku\n* 8:00pm - Go back to hotel\n\nDay 5 (Tokyo to Kyoto)\n\n* 9:00am - Tsukiji Outer Market/Eat\n* 11:00am - Teamlabs\n* 1:30pm - Train from Tokyo to Kyoto\n* 4:30pm - Arrival in Kyoto/Settle in\n* 6:00pm - We're planning on doing one activity after we've settled in. But since we have not yet booked an accomodation, we have not decided on this yet.\n\nDay 6 (Kyoto)\n\n* 9:00am - Fushimi Inari Shrine\n* 11am - Kiyomizu Dera\n* 12:0pm - Sanneizaka\n* 2:30pm - Koda-ji Temple\n* 3:00pm - Gion\n* 5:30pm - Yasaka Jinja Shrine\n* 6:00pm - Maruyama Park/Relax\n\nDay 7 (Kyoto)\n\n* 9:00am - Otagi Nenbutsu-ji (we'll take a taxi from the station to here)\n* 11:00am - Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street\n* 12:30pm - Bamboo Groves\n* 2:00pm - Tenryu-ji\n* 3:30pm - Kimono Forest\n* 4:00pm - Togetsukyo Bridge\n* 4:30pm - Not yet decided on what to do from this point on\n\nDay 8 (Osaka)\n\n* 9:00am - Osaka Castle\n* 11:00am - Shinsekai\n* 12:30pm - Nipponbashi\n* 2:00pm - Kuromon Market\n* 2:30pm - Dotonbori\n* 8:30 - Go back to hotel\n\nDay 9 (Osaka)\n\n* Universal Studios\n\nDay 10 (Final day and flight home)\n\n* On this day our flight will be at 1:30pm, meaning we won't be able to do much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould really appreciate it if I can get some advice on whether or not these times are reasonable or not. I'm not sure if I've given enough/too little time for specific places. For day 7, I'm struggling a little as Arashiyama would most likely take us a full day, but I'm not really sure what else we would be able to do. My parents would love to go to the Sagano Scenic Railway, but I'm not sure on how to fit it in. It's also a little difficult for me for day 7, as I would have to choose between Arashiyama or Northern Kyoto (Philosopher's Walk, Kinkaku-ji etc.). Thank you guys in advance!",

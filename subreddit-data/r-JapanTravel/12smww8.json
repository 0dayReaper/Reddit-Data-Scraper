    "postText": "Hi, we are a couple traveling to Japan between May 6th and May 13th for the first time. We've put together an itinerary, and are hoping to get some specific guidance as well as any general things to look out for.  We're mostly interested in food, culture (- shrines), browsing around neighborhoods for small shops (but not as interested in department store shopping).\n\nBrowsing around the subreddit has been very helpful in planning, so we are looking forward to any tips.  Thank you!\n\n# May 6th, Saturday (Tokyo)\n\n* 4:30pm arrival, 1.5 hours to hotel from NRT.

Are there any other passes that could be helpful for us?\n* Are any of the days too packed?\n* Any recommendations for us that we may have missed, especially food recs?  We enjoy street vendors and sampling local restaurants/izakayas\n* For early May, we are seeing that the weather will still be somewhat brisk but hopefully not too rainy. Any sense of how warmly and prepared we should dress &amp; pack?\n\nThanks again!",

You're underestimating how much time you waste in transit and how large these cities are: once you account for that, you'll find you won't have as much time time as you think. \n\nEach of these regions will have enough stuff to occupy you for several weeks. Probably Tokyo, since I'm guessing you've already got plane tickets.",

            "comment": "Your days are way too packed in my opinion. We also had 7 days in Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka and there is no way we would have been able to fit another city in there even for half a day. In my opinion; select 2 to 4 \u201cpriority\u201d visits per day, and be ok with dropping anything else if you run out of time because of transit times, meal wait times, etc. \n\nAlso if you haven\u2019t ordered JR pass exchange orders yet, I would do so today. Mine took 10 days to arrive.\n\nEdit to add: you can walk around Gion area after dinner but be aware, most places are still closing at 6 pm, as they have been since COVID rules. It won\u2019t be in its full glory.",

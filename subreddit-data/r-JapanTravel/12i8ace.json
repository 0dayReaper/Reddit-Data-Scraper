    "postText": "First time visit to Japan, not first solo trip (love solo travel!) nor my first time abroad (but first time in an Asian country). \n\nTravel is for a combination of fun and work. I'm attending a conference in Japan and taking personal time to go to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. \n\nBeen trying to learn a handful of phrases to get by and will have a pocket wifi (iVideo, already in my possession) for Japan and use Google Translate as needed to help with getting around. \n\nA lot of my itinerary is a collection of starred locations on google maps, but here's the general plan.\n\n---\n\n**April 14th:**\u00a0\n\n* Arrive in the afternoon at Haneda. \n* Get through customs. \n* Get a Suica or Pasmo. \n* Hop on metro to hotel (50 min or so). \n* Meander around nearby Ginza and get food.\n\n**April 15th:**\u00a0\n\n* Breakfast at Tsukiji Market\n* Meet up at 10am\n* Stationery shopping in Ginza\n* reservation for event at 2pm near Akihibara\n* Akihibara\n* Owl cafe!!\n* Akihibara\n\n\n**April 16th:**\n\n* Debating between Hitachi Seaside Park first thing in the morning *or* Kameido Tenjin Shrine Wisteria Festival\n* Afternoon: a walk through the Chiyoda City park area\n* Tokyo Station exploration\n\n\n**April 17th:**\n\n* Nakameguro \n* Shibuya &amp; Harajuku\n* Gotokuji Temple\n* Shinjuku\n* Dinner at Harukor (Ainu food!) in Shinjuku\n\n**April 18th:**\n\n* Shinkansen to Kyoto\n* Nishiki Market &amp; Gion\n\n\n**April 19th:** \n\n* Fushimi Inari very early\n\nA variety of these places, depending on time and energy levels as the day progresses:  \n\n* Kyomizu-dera and surrounding area\n* Nanzen-ji\n* Heian Shrine\n\n\n**April 20th:**\n\n* Morning: Arashiyama\n* Afternoon: Kinkaku-ji and the Yokai Street *or* Nijo Castle and Imperial Palace\n* Evening: Kodai-ji light show\n\n**April 21st:**\n\n* train to Nara\n* Nara: see park, deer, eat famous mochi and meander \n* train to Osaka\n* Osaka: idk yet, depends when I get there, probably meander somewhere near the hotel \n* Teamlab Botanical Garden in evening\n\n**April 22 - 24th:** \n\nGoing to be in Osaka, not entirely sure how I'm spending the time yet. I was thinking of a morning trip to Himeji to see the castle and eat at Tamagoya, but my conference has an excursion planned to Himeji (but no meal time there) so now I'm not sure. I still kind of want to go and eat at Tamagoya, maybe with a stop in Kobe to see a few things.\u00a0\n\nOsaka ideas:\n\n* Osaka Castle\n* Dotonbori\n* Namba Yasaka shrine\n* Kuromon Market\n* River cruise\n* Osaka Tenmangu\n* Osaka Aquarium\n\n**April 24:**\u00a0\n\nI have to get to the conference location, which is about 30 min from Kobe. I don't have to be there until 7pm at the latest and want to arrive around 5pm to have time to chill,\u00a0clean up, and change for the introduction and dinner. So that gives me some  time in the Osaka/Kobe area. Not sure how I will spend it yet. \n\n**April 28th:**\n\n* Get to Shin-Kobe\n* Take Shinkansen to Tokyo\n* Stay in Asakusa\n* Explore Asakusa\u00a0\n\n\n**April 29th:**\n\n* Asakusa\n* Last min shopping or sightseeing in Tokyo?\n* Don Quijote to load up on snacks for people back home\n\n\n**April 30th:**\n\n* Breakfast TBD\n* Morning activity TBD\n* Lunch TBD\n* Haneda airport by 2:30pm (maybe 1:30pm because of holiday\u00a0crowds?)\n* Fly home to US\n\n\n---\n\nQuestions/advice seeking on the following -\u00a0\n\nHitachi Seaside Park is about 2.5 hours (train+bus) each way - wondering if it's really worth seeing the blue nemophila (they should be at peak when I'm there) and walk around or if my time might be better spent exploring and enjoying other places in Tokyo? (As an alternative, I kind of want to spend some time in Ueno and Ikebukuro) I realize it's a personal choice on priorities, but wondering if anyone who has been there can chime in on their experience to help me evaluate?\u00a0While I was considering this, I learned about the Kameido Tenjin Shrine Wisteria Festival and have been thinking that might be really fun, scratch the spring flower itch, and let me do more in Tokyo (as opposed to sit on a train). \n\nI've been hearing a lot about long customs lines at Narita. Does anyone know where I can find info about Haneda? \n\nAny recs on places to visit in Osaka?",

So if you just want to see the deer for a little bit and move on, your plan could work. But between Todaiji, Kofukuji, Kasuga-taisha, the museums, the gardens and parks, there's more than can even be seen in a single day unless you speed run everything.",

Maybe lunch somewhere there? idk yet, planning to play the details by ear.\n\nI was planning on leaving Kyoto early, like 7:30-8ish and my hotel check in isn't until after 3pm in Osaka. It's about 30-45 min between each place IIRC (Kyoto -&gt; Nara and Nara -&gt; Osaka). I feel like as long as I get to my hotel in Osaka by 6pm I'll have time to make it to the TeamLabs (~40 min transit) to enjoy.",

Given your intended highlights and leaving Nara around 5 to be in Osaka by 6, I think you'll be fine then to see what you want plus a few other attractions as they catch your eye. Hope you enjoy! I absolutely love visiting Nara and the friendly deer.",

            "comment": "I just got back home from this loop, and I would suggest Osaka Castle in the early morning if you end up going. We went early afternoon and waited 90 minutes to go in, and the English translations of the history were hard to follow. It has a nice view at the top and the grounds are pretty, but it was not worth 90 precious minutes waiting. \n\nThe aquarium is cool, just a pain to get to. Whale sharks were a highlight, definitely book a timed ticket in advance. There was a stated 90 minute line to get in mid afternoon, but it only took 30.\n\nSennichimae Doguyasuji Shopping Street around Namba was cool, there's a display sample food shop there with great souveniers.\n\nOsaka at night (basically after 6) is great, the place livens up a lot! Namba area (and it's cool tight streets) and America Town were fun, Dotonbori was fun but packed. I feel like the best way to enjoy Osaka is to eat and drink a little too much. We did that at a Yakiniku called Yakiniku Maru Shinsaibashi Honten, which has a few restaurants if I'm not mistaken. We did yakiniku a few times and this was the most relaxed and fun. \n\nKuromon market is great, we got some yummy tofu donuts, fried sweet potato chips, and sushi from a shop near the market entrance. It wasn't too packed and is more manageable than Nishiki market in Kyoto (which is also great). The first day we went in the mid afternoon and it was dead, so we came back mid morning when more was open the next day. \n\nWhen in Tokyo, TeamLab Planets was a great stop for us... Don't miss out if TeamLab stuff interests you!",

When I saw the Osaka Teamlab Botanical Garden I was instantly intrigued and that seems more my speed than Planets in Tokyo.",

But the IOCOA card works in all 3. \n\nSecondly to keep in mind, April 17th is a lot of cities. I'm not sure where you're staying but the trains all end around 12 and shops all close around 8. So I'd probably try to rethink some cities so you can get the full experience. In Shibuya we went up a tower to get a great view of the busiest district in the world - Shibuya Crossing and we're nerds so we went to Pokemon, Nintendo etc. That alone was a lot of our day so just a thought. \n\nThere's so many beautiful shrines in Kyoto but everything ends at 5pm so keep that in mind for your planning. It sounds good but I don't know how far each of those are from each other. \n\nShinkansen to Osaka from Kyoto is like 15mins- make sure to invest in a JR Pass so you can take advantage of other JR lines and get those bullet trains for free/save you time. Going to Nara I don't think there's a stop from the JR (or at least it didn't from the railway I took) but it's 40mins from Osaka so again but it sounds like a good day. \n\nWe didn't do much in Osaka either. We waited on line to see the Castle which is basically a museum and then they had a special night showing of the castle so we went back and saw it again lol. Sorry I don't have much recommendations for that. \n\nVery excited for your trip! I hope I helped!",

Also a bit slower than the Kintetsu, as it makes more stops. So it is an option if you want to maximize your JR pass; however, if you're prioritizing speed and don't care about dropping an extra ~1300 yen each way, the Kintetsu (especially the limited express) may be the better option.",

I'm glad you gave yourself more time :) \nOne of my favorite shrines I stumbled upon walking to my hotel from the station in Kyoto so having that flexibility is perfect :)",

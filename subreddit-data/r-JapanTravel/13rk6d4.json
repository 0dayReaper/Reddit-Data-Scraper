    "postText": "Thanks for reading. Our family of four is making a first trip to Japan from October 12 to October 25. Our kids are aged 7 and 9. I'm on my own planning this, so I appreciate any help. The top items in my group are: Nikko (me), Fuji (partner), and Nintendo World (kids).\r  \n\r  \n**Thu 12 Tokyo**\r  \nArrive at Haneda mid afternoon. Simple goal of making it to the hotel in Asakusa, grab IC cards (including kid's cards) and JR passes. Hope we can stay awake long enough to minimize jet lag the next day. Possibly buy tickets for Nikko daytrip the next day.\r  \n\r  \n**Fri 13 Tokyo --&gt; Nikko**\r  \nDay trip to Nikko. Hiking around Okunikko to start, with a drop-off at Yumoto Onsen, hike to Chuzenji Lake, and a boat across to Kegon Falls. Spend the second half of the day around Nikko National Park before returning to Tokyo.\r  \n\r  \n**Sat 14 Tokyo**\r  \nMeiji Shrine, Shibuya, and Shinjuku. Don't know much, other than these are popular areas. Worried this is more geared towards luxury shopping and adult fun that won't be enjoyable for kids.\r  \n\r  \n**Sun 15 Tokyo**\r  \nExplore Ueno and Asakusa. Considering the Tokyo National Museum. Feels like there's more we can pack into this day. Other poster mentioned Akihabara, so maybe we check that out as well? I understand it's pedestrian friendly on Sundays.\r  \n\r  \n**Mon 16 Tokyo**\r  \nDay trip to Kamakura. Chose this over Hakone because of our family's interest in history/culture over more \"touristy\" spots, although Hakone seems like a nice place to be with kids and possibly see Fuji.\r  \n\r  \n**Tue 17 Kanazawa**\r  \nEarly morning departure for Kanazawa. Hotel is near Omicho Market. Spend the day visiting the castle area and Kenrokuen. Possibly work in the market, but not sure how.\r  \n\r  \n**Wed 18 Kanazawa --&gt; Takayama**\r  \nDay trip to Takayama. Chance to enjoy an oldtown feel and maybe try some good beef. Including Shirakawa seems to much, so maybe Hida Folk Village is a good alternative. Return to hotel in Kanazawa.\r  \n\r  \n**Thu 19 Hiroshima/Miyajima**\r  \nDepart Kanazawa early for Hiroshima. Stop in Hiroshima to visit the Peace Park, Peace Memorial Museum, and A-Bomb Dome. Take afternoon ferry to Miyajima to check into hotel/ryokan (TBD) and do some light exploring.\r  \n\r  \n**Fri 20 Miyajima/Kyoto**\r  \nFinish up exploring Miyajima, then make our way to Kyoto hotel in Kawaramichi. On the way to Kyoto, it would be nice to stop at Himeji Castle. I'm not sure it makes sense given time constraints, as it feels like we've cut too much already around Kyoto.\r  \n\r  \n**Sat 21 Kyoto** \r  \nDay trip to Nara. I honestly don't expect Nara will fill a full day for us considering all that's left to see in/around Kyoto, so I anticipate turning back for Kyoto mid afternoon. If so, it could be a good time to stop at Fushimi Inari on the way back. Depending on how long we're at Fushimi, then check out parts of Gion/Higashiyama. \r  \n\r  \n**Sun 22 Kyoto**\r  \nArashyiama and monkey park in the morning. Back in Kyoto for Jidai Matsuri in the early afternoon. Finish off Higashiyama and possibly head to Northern Kyoto (Kinkauji and Ryoanji) afterwards. There's a fire festival in Kurama in the evening, but I'm not sure it's worth the crowds and effort.\r  \n\r  \n**Mon 23 Kyoto --&gt; Osaka**\r  \nDay trip to Osaka. Kids are very excited about Super Nintendo World, so we would start there. Feels like Monday is a good day for this. Don't expect we'll spend long in other areas of the park, so that leaves an afternoon/evening to explore Osaka, or else return to Kyoto. Kids aren't interested in the aquarium.\r  \n\r  \n**Tue 24 Hakone**\r  \nConsidering a last overnight in Hakone, but I'm torn between that and just staying in Kyoto. I want to do a Ryokan with a private onsen and Kaiseki, and I like the idea of relaxing towards the end of the trip. I wonder if I'm cutting out better experiences in Kyoto for this.\r  \n\r  \n**Wed 25 Tokyo**\r  \nMorning in Hakone (or Kyoto) before heading to Tokyo to depart Haneda late afternoon.\r  \n\r  \n**SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:**\r  \n\r  \n\u2022\tWhere to stay in Hiroshima/Miyajima? Leaning towards Miyajima to explore the island. If so, is it a given to stay in a Ryokan there?\n\n\u2022\tWhether to leave Kyoto for Hakone or just stay in Kyoto? If going to Hakone, then any recommendations on where to stay in Hakone? Need a private onsen, preferably attached to the room.\n\n\u2022\tGeneral feedback about my concern that we have too many daytrips from cities, mainly Tokyo and Kyoto, instead of staying in the city and seeing the good attractions already there.\n\n\u2022\tI'd like to see Matsushima Bay in Sendai, but I'm just not seeing how it works for this trip. \n\n\r\u2022\tLuggage forwarding might make this hectic trip a little easier, especially for travel between stays in Tokyo and Kyoto. I'm looking at shipping luggage ahead to our Kyoto hotel, but I wonder if there's too long of a time gap to make that doable. Also, if we add the last day in Hakone, would make sense to ship from Kyoto to Haneda? \n\n  \nAgain, thanks for reading and for any and all feedback.",

It's easy to plan that from the comforts of home, but harder the morning after international air travel and changing several time zones. \n\nOne thing about our kids that will make parts of this trip easier, including the Nikko daytrip, is that they're high energy and regularly take long hikes. Both are active in year-round youth sports. Most weekends they go on hikes of at least 5 miles / 8 km and longer. Okunikko seems to be around that same distance, which is doable...just maybe not so soon after arriving.\n\nI guess I'll ask what you would do? We could maybe swap Kamakura and Nikko. I'd put those outside the weekend due to crowds, but maybe it's not so much an issue - or at least less of an issue than being a jet-lagged zombie on a long hike as you point out.\n\nThis Nikko trip could be weather dependent as well, so maybe we check forecasts before departing.",

My thoughts:\n\nTokyo:\nYou can get your IC cards and JR Passes before you leave the airport. There is a JR office connected to to Haneda. If you have an iPhone I highly recommend that you just set up the Suica card in your Apple Wallet. You can reload with a credit card. (Make sure your card has $0 fee foreign transactions). \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for things for your kids to do, definitely go to Akihabara. Also there is the Taito Game Center in Shinjuku. They may also enjoy Aqua City in Odaiba or the Cup Noodle Museum in Yokohama. \n\nHiroshima:\nI don\u2019t think you need a second day of exploring Miyajima. It\u2019s nice but you can get the idea in a few hours: see the deer, see the shrine, take a picture in front of the torii, eat lunch, get back on the boat. Be sure to find a place to have Hiroshima style okonomiyaki for dinner. \n\nKyoto:\nAre you completely married to the idea of using Kyoto as your \u201chome base\u201d for that leg of your trip? Kyoto is great, but it can be VERY hard to maneuver around the city during certain times of day because they rely heavily on buses which get VERY crowded. Osaka, on the other hand, has a fully-integrated train system inside the city so it could be an easier daily jump off point. Just a thought. \n\nWhile in Kyoto, eat at Katsukura. Also, buy some yatsuhashi (a very traditional sweet found only in Kyoto). You\u2019ll be in Kyoto during the time when the leaves on the trees change color so the temples will look vey nice. If you have some time while in Kansai, check out Kobe. Nara doesn\u2019t deserve an entire day if you\u2019re pressed for time. \n\nFor luggage I usually pack a small suitcase and put it inside a large, empty suitcase. As I travel and buy things I end up with 2 full suitcases in the way back. The luggage transport is helpful, especially because you\u2019re technically not supposed to take a bunch of large suitcases on the bullet train. \n\nI think you\u2019ll be there during baseball season so you may want to check out a Japanese baseball game. The experience is completely different.",

                    "comment": "The IC card you need is called Suica and it has become a unified form of cashless payment throughout Japan. You can buy them at any train station and you can use them in place of a paper ticket on almost any train or bus in the country. You can also use it to pay for things at convenience stores and restaurants. There is a JR office right at the exit of Haneda airport. The same time you pick up your JR passes I think you should be able to get the child IC cards. It\u2019s reloadable so you only have to buy it once.  They also sell IC cards in the ticket machines at any train station, but I don\u2019t know if that includes kids cards. There are tons of YouTube videos on how to add Suica to your phone and buy/use the physical card. Look for a demonstration on how to use Suica together with a JR pass because there will be instances where one leg of your trip is via JR train and another part is non-JR so you\u2019ll need to put your JR ticket and wave your IC card at the gate at the same time to enter/exit. \n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about shipping luggage because I\u2019ve only done it once and it was from my friend\u2019s house to my in-laws house. But you may be able to choose a shipping option that puts your luggage on the \u201cslow boat\u201d to Kyoto and burns an extra day in transit.",

My wife couldn\u2019t get our BofA Visa credit card to do it, even after multiple phone calls to the card company. Our Amex Platinum and my Amex Gold cards both worked instantly with no issues. I topped up at least 15 time via the app while I was there last October. It\u2019s no mystery. You\u2019ll find out right away when you attempt to charge the card whether it works or not. \n\nI\u2019d recommend bringing multiple cards to Japan anyway. Even if you put a travel notice on your card ahead of time you could have issues. After many random card decline experiences and phone calls to the card company, I\u2019ve been able to piece together the following logic. Some merchant transactions in Japan trigger a message from the foreign card issuer (Visa, MC, Amex) to provide additional verification before the charge goes through (it could be a phone call or some other action required). BUT, on the side of the Japanese merchant processor, anything but a straight approval from the issuer will be automatically aborted. Basically, if the foreign issuer asks for verification, the Japan merchant says \u201cnever mind\u201d and just declines the purchase.",

I also have a travel rewards card with zero foreign transaction fees. A couple potential issues, at least from what I've read, are: 1) child IC cards must be bought in-person; and 2) Haneda only sells monorail IC cards, so we'd have to return at that station? Maybe not an issue since we also depart from Haneda? Kids are big-time into Nintendo, so maybe Akihabara is a good fit after all. Probably the grown-ups would enjoy as well.\n\nHiroshima - You put to words what I had in the back of my mind, at least in terms of more time than needed for Miyajima. We've also had family suggest that we do okonimiyaki in Hiroshima as well, which the kids would enjoy more than Kaiseki at a Miyajima Ryokan. Makes returning towards Kyoto easier as well.\n\nKyoto - Not completely married to Kyoto as a home base, but I do like the idea of minimizing check-in and check-out while there. Our group is keen on the Jidai Matsuri, which pushes us towards Kyoto over Osaka. I hadn't heard that about public transport, so thank you. We'll look at Kobe as well.\n\nFor luggage, everyone will have a lighter backpack and each of the adults will have an oversized duffel. We're all-in on carryon, even when airfare includes checked bags. Our hotel in Kyoto said not to send more than one day before check-in, so I'm not sure how to handle that. Maybe ask the Tokyo hotel to hold for a day before sending?",

I do worry about burnout on train travel, but I also know we'll do a fair bit of walking and could use that as recharging time. Kids might also catch up on sleep since we'll start early most days, and the scenery should be good from the train.\n\nFor Kanazawa/Takayama, my first thought was to do an overnight in Takyama on the way from Tokyo and before Kanazawa. Seemed like a good chance to do a Ryokan as well. The problem, at least when I looked, was a rough train ride from Tokyo that via Nagoya that takes around 5 hours. From Kanazawa and using Google Maps, it shows as a 2 hour trip out to Takayama via Toyama. Different story going back, as those routes are between 2h 30m and 2h 45m. Still under the 5 hour trip from Tokyo to Takyama, unless I'm missing something (very possible).",

The biggest issue is frequency vs. length of time the trip takes.  There are 8 trains a day between Toyama and Takayama (4 local and 4 express) and the  timing between when the trains run can be wonky and are not set up so that if you miss an express the local gets you in a good deal before the next express would.)  I've not done the bus, but I know there are also limited buses as well.\n\nOne idea would be to do:\n\nTokyo to Kanazawa (overnight)\n\nKanazawa to Takayama (overnight)\n\nTakayama to Hiroshima (overnight)\n\nThe trip from Takayama to Hiroshima (limited express and shinkansen) should only be about an hour longer than Kanazawa to Hiroshima, but takes away the additional back and forth the day before.\n\nI just have 1 child, but I took her to Japan when she was 7 and when she was 9.\n\nShe loved Hida no Sato village.  I've not taken her to Shirakawa Go because I do not think she would enjoy it (I went when I was pregnant with her.)\n\nMy tween likes staying in Kyoto.  We usually stay there over Osaka because I think unless you are staying in a luxury hotel, you get a larger room in Kyoto than you do in Osaka outside of the hotels near USJ.\n\nMy tween got hit by the shyness bug so likes Yunessun the cheezy bathing suit onsen.  It is not authentic at all (well the naked side is somewhat authentic) but it's great if you are traveling with someone who doesn't want to be naked.\n\nI think with Nikko you have to be worried about the time it takes to get from Nikko proper by bus to the OkuNikko and Chuzenji area ESPECIALLY, if it's during fall foliage.  Even during a week day that bus is going to go really slow and the traffic will make it quite unpleasant.  Nikko by itself is a fine day trip, it's the addition of Chuzenji and Keagon Falls which makes the whole trip iffy.\n\nWe did Matsushima as a day trip from Tokyo in 2019 or 2018.  I'd been previously.  The tween liked it,\n\nMine liked Miyajima a lot.\n\nGood luck.",

One would be to cut a night in Tokyo in favor of an overnight in Nikko (if I can find a place), and another would be to cut a night in Kanazawa in favor of Takayama.\n\nI think I mentioned elsewhere, but I'm trying to be efficient about checking in and out of accommodations. As I look at this, I'm realizing that comes at a cost of travel time and exhausting, two-way trains and buses. Time has it's own value, especially on trips like this.\n\nI had not read or heard about Yunessun. My oldest would not go nude, so I appreciate your tip. Meanwhile, my youngest has to be strongly reminded to put on underwear after showering...\n\nA couple questions for you, if you don't mind.\n\nFor Nikko if you were to do an overnight, would you stay in Nikko or try to stay near Chuzenji? Between the National Park and OkuNikko, we are more interested in OkuNikko. We're too early for peak fall colors elsewhere, so this is our prime opportunity during the trip.\n\nFor Hiroshima/Miyajima, would you stay in Hiroshima or Miyajima? Similar to OkuNikko, I could see most of the group preferring the outdoors aspect of the island over Hiroshima. On the other side, I understand Miyajima can get dull beyond a half day, there's limited food/accommodation options, and it's an added layer of difficulty if leaving the next day due to the ferry and greater distance from Kyoto.",

She has gotten better about it, and we're doing lots of 1 nights this next trip, so she is just going to have to deal.  A lot of those 1 nights are with a car though and most of our things will be waiting for us in Tokyo, so it's sort of a different situation.\n\nTime 100% has its own value.\n\nCan you do an open jaw?  (home destination to Tokyo and then Osaka to home destination?)  I know I've not been able to get it work my last few trips, but it is possible it works from your starting destination.  That can really change things.\n\nI've only done Nikko as a day trip.  It keeps getting cut from my itineraries for a second visit (like this next trip) and I feel really bad about that.  I'm not a hiker. I would honestly see what is available, if you are going at all during Fall Foliage.  I think what makes sense will be partially based on that.\n\nIf you're not going to Nikko though to see Nikko, (i.e. Toshogu and the other temple, but just for nature and hiking)  there are other hiking options a lot closer to Tokyo.  Have you looked into Chichubu?\n\nThere are also other destinations where you can hike that work better with your trip West.  When is Fall foliage in Matsumoto? You can change things up and go Tokyo to Matsumoto to Takayama to Kanazawa to Hiroshima.  You should be pretty peak for foliage for Takayama.\n\nFor Hiroshima and Miyajima, it partially depends on how much money you want to spend.  A lot of places on Miyajima are ryokan and can be inclusive of all meals.  Hiroshima is a big city so you can eat at your hotel or not.\n\nI've only stayed over night in Hiroshima (I've been to both multiple times, my daughter has not been to Hiroshima, because when she was younger, I wasn't sure she understood the reality and gravity of the Peace Park and museum.)  because I was on a tighter budget.  It was a long time ago, the place was not terribly good, and I would not stay there again.  I have a friend who stayed with her mother in a ryokan on Miyajima and loved it.\n\nThe ferry runs fairly often, like I want to say every 20 minutes.  This is not like trying to visit Okunoshima or Naoshima or Tashirojima.  There are also frequent trains from Miyajima to Hiroshima.  It adds about 45 minutes to maybe 1 hour to your trip to Kyoto.\n\nA few things I will add... check room sizes and make sure when booking hotels you enter the children's ages and that there are kids.  Some hotels once children are over 7 they count as adults for occupancy, some it's 12, some it's 13 and some it's 18.  It does really vary.\n\nI didn't do this originally, but now I regret it a lot, this past trip, I started booking more breakfast inclusive rates.  I don't know where you are coming from, but we have traveled from the US East Coast, the US West Coast, and Hawaii to Japan.  Jet lag turns my usually night owl child into a morning person, sometimes 4 or 5 am early morning, person for about a week.  By the end of the trip breakfast inclusive rates are less important.  I find getting a decent breakfast into my child helps make the day start off right.  (It also helps me do better!)  Outside of Combini, Starbucks, a few other chain coffee shops, and Mister Donuts, finding breakfast before 10 am can be a challenge.  All those pancake places people post about here on reddit don't start serving until 10 or 11 am usually.  If your kid(s) are like mine, getting up at 6 am by 7 am they are hungry.  Luckily, most hotel breakfast buffets are quite discounted for 12 and under.  The ones that dxon't discount are the exception.\n\nI don't pack light, but I pack judiciously and pay for luggage transport.  It's not that expensive.  I find trying to do laundry during trips can eat a lot of time out of your schedule.  I was up from 9 pm to midnight doing laundry in December and overslept getting to Tokyo Disney.  Unless you are going to an actual laundromat (which I have not done) or paying a service, Japanese washers tend to be small, dryers tend to be small, and compared to US ones, dry very poorly.",

            "comment": "My biggest concern is one you\u2019ve identified yourself - too many day trips.  Arriving at a city and then immediately leaving it for a day trip to some other city\u2026just seems like a way to stress yourself out.  I would heavily reduce the number of destinations in your trip.  You\u2019ve got a limited number of days and personally I\u2019d want to spend more time seeing and less time travelling.  (Even though riding the trains is fun and relaxing).\n\nOn our trip in March we considered going to Kamakura and Takayama, but decided it was simply too much when added to Tokyo/Kyoto/Hiroshima (and you\u2019re adding Nikko and Kanazawa?).  Of course everyone has their own travel styles\u2026\n\nQuestions I would pose back to you:  do you need to see Miyajima *and* Nara?  They both have deer and temples.  The kids will like it.  You don\u2019t need to see both.\n\nAnd if you choose Nara - do you still really really want to take the kids to Hiroshima?  You could gain a few days elsewhere by cutting that leg out of the trip.\n\nIf you\u2019re more interested in the quieter/older/outdoorsy parts of Japan, would you consider skipping Tokyo altogether?  You could spend a night in Nikko, head to Hakone, and keep going west\u2026\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t seen it, I\u2019ll link my post about our family trip this past March - it might give you some options of things to do with the kids (though mine are older).\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/12iee5k/family_trip_report_two_weeks_in_sakura_season/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1",

Hiroshima/Miyajima are well-above Nara and some other things, even though I worry about the potential mental and emotional weight of Hiroshima on our kids. Seems important nonetheless.\n\nYou make an interesting point about skipping Tokyo, or at least shortening it. It seems crazy to consider, but maybe not for us given where our interests lie. I do feel strongly about seeing and experiencing a country beyond its capital or leading city. Have you really seen France if you never left Paris? Did you actually visit America if you never left NY or LA? Probably I'm projecting and shouldn't tell others the \"right\" way to travel, but maybe you take my meaning regardless.\n\nAnd thanks for sharing that link to your trip. Good stuff!",

If you plan to be at Nintendo World and USJ just part of the day, definitely look into getting there super early (7am) since you need an area entry to get there within the park, if you don\u2019t get there early enough in the morning. If budget allows, get the express pass through USJ directly and pick the entry time for Nintendo World plus skip the line for some rides.",

At a basic level, I know SNW is within USJ and that it has timed admissions separate from basic park admission. Before we leave, I'll probably go into the mobile app and buy tickets. Budget does allow the express pass, and probably my sanity flat-out requires it!\n\nI've thought about your point regarding early arrival, and it's a bit of a worry since we'll likely be coming from Kyoto. It's seems reasonably quick to get to USJ from Kyoto/Kawaramachi? We are early risers and kids will no doubt be excited, so I don't worry about oversleeping.",

            "comment": "I studied abroad in Tokyo for a few months and lived/worked in Osaka for 3 years after college. I go back every year or so.  My thoughts:\n\nTokyo:\nYou can get your IC cards and JR Passes before you leave the airport. There is a JR office connected to to Haneda. If you have an iPhone I highly recommend that you just set up the Suica card in your Apple Wallet. You can reload with a credit card. (Make sure your card has $0 fee foreign transactions). \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for things for your kids to do, definitely go to Akihabara. Also there is the Taito Game Center in Shinjuku. They may also enjoy Aqua City in Odaiba or the Cup Noodle Museum in Yokohama. \n\nHiroshima:\nI don\u2019t think you need a second day of exploring Miyajima. It\u2019s nice but you can get the idea in a few hours: see the deer, see the shrine, take a picture in front of the torii, eat lunch, get back on the boat. Be sure to find a place to have Hiroshima style okonomiyaki for dinner. \n\nKyoto:\nAre you completely married to the idea of using Kyoto as your \u201chome base\u201d for that leg of your trip? Kyoto is great, but it can be VERY hard to maneuver around the city during certain times of day because they rely heavily on buses which get VERY crowded. Osaka, on the other hand, has a fully-integrated train system inside the city so it could be an easier daily jump off point. Just a thought. \n\nWhile in Kyoto, eat at Katsukura. Also, buy some yatsuhashi (a very traditional sweet found only in Kyoto). You\u2019ll be in Kyoto during the time when the leaves on the trees change color so the temples will look vey nice. If you have some time while in Kansai, check out Kobe. Nara doesn\u2019t deserve an entire day if you\u2019re pressed for time. \n\nFor luggage I usually pack a small suitcase and put it inside a large, empty suitcase. As I travel and buy things I end up with 2 full suitcases in the way back. The luggage transport is helpful, especially because you\u2019re technically not supposed to take a bunch of large suitcases on the bullet train. \n\nI think you\u2019ll be there during baseball season so you may want to check out a Japanese baseball game. The experience is completely different.",

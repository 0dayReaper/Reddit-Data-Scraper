    "postText": "I'd like to share my experience of travelling Japan by bicycle, and hopefully inspire others to travel the country on two wheels. Travelling like this isn\u2019t for everyone, but I'm hoping some people find this post useful/interesting.\n\n###Background \nI first did a bike trip in Europe in 2014. I then got a job in Tottori Prefecture, and stayed there for three years. I had an amazing time living in Japan, and decided that the best way to finish off my time in the country would be to cycle the length of it from north to south.   \n\n\n###My Route \nhttps://imgur.com/Qq5zJsD  \nThe idea for this trip was to cycle to the northern point of Hokkaido (Cape Soya), then all the down to the south point of Kyushu (Cape Sata). I then took a 26 hour ferry to Okinawa and spent a week there before flying home. \n\n###Why a bicycle? \nThere are so many great reasons to travel Japan by bike.  \n\n- You have to get out of the cities and experience all the towns, villages and countryside in between.  \n- The people are so friendly, especially in areas where they don\u2019t often see tourists.  \n- One of the main reasons I prefer to travel in this way is the flexibility - since you don\u2019t have to book any accommodation ahead of time. I don\u2019t enjoy planning each day in detail and searching ahead for things to do/see/eat in each place. By bicycle you can just draw a line, and see what you find along the way. If you wake up and change your mind, or get recommendations from a local, you can easily take a detour or stay another day. \n- There are also places that are hard to get to by public transport, and having your bike will solve this problem!\n- In Japan it is very easy to camp for free. There are a surprising amount of free campsites, and it\u2019s usually acceptable to camp in a quiet park or at a michi-no-eki (roadside station) if you are too far from a campsite. \n- Good roads, bike-friendly drivers, convenience stores, and the general safety of Japan also make it an easy place for your first bike trip.\n\n###Best Memory \nI was 20km from the campsite I was aiming for, and stopped at a rural michi-no-eki (roadside station) for some water. An old man stopped to ask where I was from, then asked if I like mochi (Japanese rice cake).  \nI said I did, so he told me to wait as he went to his car and gave me a bag of mochi and a bag of tomatoes.  \nHe (75) and his wife (80) then invited me to go to an onsen and restaurant across the road. They ordered so much food and drink, packed the leftovers for my breakfast, and they even paid for everything!  \n(I set up my tent on the grassy area outside the michi-no-eki and felt quite bad for the other cyclist making some instant ramen on his stove!)\n\n###Favourite Regions/Places\n\n- My number one tip is to visit Hokkaido. I can\u2019t recommend it enough. The national parks are amazing, the food is delicious, and I even saw a brown bear when cycling through Shiretoko National Park!  \nThis website has some good routes and information about cycling in Hokkaido - http://www.14degrees.org/hokkaido-cycle-touring-routes/\n\n- My other favourite region for cycling was Tottori to Shimonoseki, along the San\u2019in Coast. I highly recommend Tottori Sand Dunes and Uradome Coast near Tottori City. Mt Mitoku is an amazing hike, and Oki Islands are worth visiting.  \n- Towadako and Oirase Gorge in October - The Autumn leaves were amazing!  \n\n\n###When it doesn't go to plan. \nI found a box to take my bike home on the flight. But when it was packed, it was too big for the taxis in Okinawa to take it to the airport. I didn't have much time and was worried that I might miss my flight. But I finally found a solution.\nhttps://imgur.com/NjpgRA3  \n\n\n###Conclusion \nIt was the best trip I\u2019ve done yet! I\u2019ll definitely be back. For anyone who enjoys nature, and is interested in seeing more than just the touristy areas, I highly recommend getting on a bike and seeing Japan in this way - whether for a few days, or a few months!  \n\n###Some Stats: \n**Time:** 3 Months  \n**Cycling Days:** 69  \n**Distance Cycled:** Around 5000km  \n**Prefectures:** 28  \n**Highest Pass:** 1050m  \n**Number of Punctures:** 0!  \n**Nights camped:** 41 (Total Campsite Cost = \u00a52070)  \n**Coldest Night Camping:** -1\u00b0C    \n**Animals I saw:** \n \n- Brown Bear  (Probably the most exciting moment of the trip!)  \n- Monkey  \n- Chipmunk  \n- Snake \n- Tanuki (Raccoon Dog)  \n- Deer  \n- Fox  \n- Mukade (Big, dangerous centipede)   \n \n\n###Edit:  \nI originally included a video in this post but I had to remove it as video links aren't allowed in this subreddit. \nBut that has also removed some useful info. So here is an album with some photos of my bike and camping setup. Oh, and the bear I saw!\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DBotzl2\n\nI posted the video on a bike touring subreddit, so it's on my profile if you search my posts.  \nOr search \"7 Tips for Cycle Touring in Japan\" on Google/YouTube. \n\n\n###My Route in more detail:\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/S7SVFG54Mey\n\n###Gear:  \nSome people have been asking, so here is a list of the important stuff.\n\n- Bike - Schwinn Searcher 3\n\n- Tent - Eureka Midori Solo\n\n- Sleeping mat - Klymit Static V Sleeping Pad\n\n- Sleeping Bag \u2013 Montbell Downhugger 800 #3\n\n- Stove - Jetboil Minimo\n\n- Action Cam \u2013 GoPro HERO5 Session\n\n- Camera \u2013 Canon Powershot SX710 HS\n\n- Battery Pack \u2013 Anker Powercore 20100.",

As long as you check it well and make sure it's OK to ride, it would cost maximum 15k to change all the cables and chain and you'll probably not lose much by selling it. It depends more on your level of comfort and whether or not you prefer not having to go through the trouble of buying/selling it afterwards.",

But if you ever get the chance, do it! \nif you do it once, you'll make the time for it again. Check the bicycle touring subreddit to see how many people are addicted to bike travel!\n\nMy longest distance in one day was 160km/100 miles. From Utsunomiya to Tokyo. I'd also done this before in Italy. Both times were reasonable flat with the wind at my back. \n\nYeah, that sounds about right for average distance. I often did over 100km but also had some easy days. \n\nThe wind affects things a lot. More than hills or bad roads. In good conditions I could cover up to 25km an hour. Against a bad wind, sometimes less than 10km/hour. \n\nI usually just woke up and decided where to go. I used Google Maps and Maps.ME apps on my phone. If I didn't like the road, I'd just stop at a conbini and check for a more quiet one or something. Or sometimes I had a general route in my head - like around the coast of Hokkaido. \n\nAlthough I sometimes looked to avoid mountains (through laziness), they are actually the best parts. A hard climb up and then it's all downhill and you can enjoy the view. My favourite day might have been down through Daisetsuzan National Park in Hokkaido. I climbed up a 1050m pass, then entered the park and it was all down from there! \n(Search Youtube for \"Hokkaido Bike Trip\" if you want to see my video on this. My three weeks around the north half of Hokkaido was my favourite part of the trip.)\n\nNagoya wasn't too bad, except I had to cycle through it three times! I found a host to the north of the city. Then had to cycle south again to meet a friend the next day. Then north again to head towards Lake Biwa. But I didn't think it was worse than any other city in Japan. ",

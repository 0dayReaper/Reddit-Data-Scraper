    "postText": "Hello! I am planning my first Japan trip, and want to make sure this looks feasible.\n\nMy main concern is how I tried to stick Shimoda in between Tokyo and Hakone. I'm worried I won't be spending enough days in Tokyo as a result, and might have too much packed into the couple days I currently have there. Would I be better off forgetting Shimoda and just using that time to enjoy Tokyo more? It'd also be annoying changing hotels several nights in a row, probably.\n\nBut I put Shimoda in there as I really wanted to see a smaller coastal Japanese town instead of just the big cities, and it seems like a really cool place I'd love to see if possible. But is the rest of the time around Tokyo going to be too rushed with this as is?\n\nI feel more confident about having enough time in Kyoto, but open to suggestions concerning that plan as well!\n\n# Day 1 (Saturday June 24)\n\n* Fly out\n\n# Day 2 (Sunday June 25)\n\n* Arrive 3:30 pm Tokyo (Haneda)\n* Find hotel, explore nearby area and get dinner\n* Hotel in Shinjuku?\n* Shinjuku\n   * Omoide Yokocho - small street with restaurants\n   * Golden gai - Small streets with bars\n\n# Day 3 (Monday June 26)\n\n* Imperial palace east garden?\n* Shibuya area\n   * Meiji shrine\n   * Yoyogi park\n   * Cat street: old houses renovated into shops\n   * Harajuku?\n      * Nezu museum / garden\n   * Omotesando?\n   * Center-Gai: shopping\n   * MAGNET by SHIBUYA109: eat at foodcourt\n   * Underground mall\n   * Oreryu shio ramen - dinner\n\n# Day 4 (Tuesday June 27)\n\n* Asakusa\n   * Tokyo Skytree (view from Sumida park)\n   * Sensoji Buddhist temple\n   * Ueno park\n      * Tokyo national museum?\n* Akihabara\n   * Shop\n   * Eat at cafe\n\nIf more time (probably unlikely but ideas for more just in case):\n\n* Yanaka??\n   * Yanaka Ginza street - souvenirs\n   * Gyokurin-Ji temple\n* Kichijoji??\n   * Shop at sun road\n   * Inokashira Park: pond\n\n# Day 5 (Wednesday June 28)\n\n* Depart for Shimoda in morning\n   * Odoriko 3 Limited Express Izukyu-Shimoda\n   * Depart 9 am, arrive 11:41 am\n   * Walk around Perry road\n   * Museums\n\n# Day 6 (Thursday June 29)\n\n* Shimoda: beach town\n   * Shimoda ropeway\n   * Shrines at beach, explore beach area a bit\n* Return to Tokyo\n   * Odoriko 10 Limited Express\n   * Depart 1 pm, arrive 3:49 pm\n* Teamlab Planets/Borderless\n   * See art museum\n   * Explore bay area\n* Tsukiji (Toyosu?)\n   * Outer market: street food, sushi\n* Depart for Hakone either in evening....?\n   * Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen\n   * Depart 8:27 pm, arrive 9:32 pm\n\n# Day 7 (Friday June 30)\n\n* ....Or depart for Hakone in morning?\n   * Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen\n   * Depart 8:27 am, arrive 9:27 am\n* Hakone\n   * Hakone Shrine\n      * Lantern path through forest\n   * Hakone Checkpoint\n      * Lunch\n   * Pirate ship cruise across lake\n   * Hakone ropeway cable car\n   * Hakone open air museum\n\n# Day 8 (Saturday July 1)\n\n* Train to Kyoto - arrive around 12 pm\n* Get lunch\n* Kiyomizudera Temple\n* Kinkaku-ji Golden Temple\n   * Zen Garden nearby\n* Gion neighborhood\n   * Dinner\n\n# Day 9 (Sunday July 2)\n\n* Fushimi Inari Shrine\n* Nishiki Market - lunch\n* Some more temples (Nijo castle, Imperial palace)???\n* Pontocho Alley - dinner\n\n# Day 10 (Monday July 3)\n\n* Arashiyama\n   * Togetsuky\u014d Bridge\n   * Bamboo Grove\n   * Tenryuji Temple\n* Arashiyama Monkey Park\n* Other stuff we didn\u2019t have time for?\n\n# Day 11 (Tuesday July 4)\n\n* Train to Tokyo\n* Depart 3:50 pm Tokyo (Haneda)",

Compared to everywhere else in your list, it will be really going like back in time 10+ years. So I'm torn... I think it depends how strongly you're into the stuff you have planned in Tokyo &amp; Kyoto... how good are you with jet lag? What would you be devastated if you missed?  \n\nIf you want to go to Shimoda, on June 29th, instead of returning to Tokyo, I would head from Shimoda to Hakone directly (same Odoriko and transfer at Odawara). Shift all your other plans about a half day earlier. You'll have time to take an onsen bath in the evening at Hakone   \nand cutting out some back-and-forth will help you keep up your energy levels over the fast-paced trip.",

A big part of the problem here was the transport to and from Shimoda, as it's not exactly on the Shinkansen route from Tokyo - Hakone - Kyoto, and that Ororiko only comes a few times a day it seems (I did see there's some other local trains that go to Shimoda, but they involve some transfers and I'm worried I'd just get lost and miss something so I wanted to stick to the more straighforward Odoriko that takes me right there). \n\nI think with that knowledge I can take Day 5 as a full extra day in Tokyo, to do the Teamlab Planets and add in another area of the city for the rest of the day. Day 6 depart for Hakone, do the originally planned stuff there and spend the night in Hakone. Day 7 depart for Shimoda from Hakone on the Odoriko, arrive at 11:40 am as originally planned and do my thing there. Then Day 8 take Odoriko back to the Hakone station to then catch the Shinkansen to Kyoto. I'll be getting to Kyoto a little later in the afternoon than planned, but that is actually ok as I had extra time in Kyoto than I needed I think anyway. I'll just move some stuff from Day 8 to the end of Day 10 which was a little empty. \n\nSeems like a win-win here to me, with more time in Tokyo and slightly less train catching. Only negative is I get slightly less time in Shimodo. But it's still most of a day and I think it's plenty of time to walk around the town / Perry street, and hit the ropeway car and see the beach/mountain area a bit. \n\nThanks!",

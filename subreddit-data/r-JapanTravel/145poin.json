Any advice or recommendations are welcome!\n\nSome questions I have:\n\n* Are some of these days too empty? Too full? I'm not sure how our energy levels will keep up as we go on.\n* How much Japanese skill is necessary? I know the most basic phrases and I can form some sentences but we're not fluent by any means.\n* Recommendations for things to see/do? We don't have specific requests, but we all love good food and interesting sights (I'm a video games nerd so stuff relating to that would be good as well)\n\n**Day 0:** \n\n* Arrive in Tokyo, have dinner in Ginza \n\n**Day 1:**\n\n* Morning Hamarikyu Gardens, TeamLab Planets, Tsukiji Outer Market Lunch,\n* Afternoon/Evening Tokyo VR Red, Dinner in Ginza/Roppongi\n\n**Day 2:** \n\n* Morning: Akihabara, arcades\n* Afternoon/Evening: Shibuya/Harajuku (could be switched)\n   * Things we would like to see: Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park, Shibuya Sky\n\n**Day 3:**\n\n* Morning/Afternoon: Ghibli Museum (somehow got tickets...), Inokashira Park, Kichijoji Area,\n* Evening: tbd \n\nEvening: tbd\n\n**Day 4:**\n\n* Morning: Skytree, Senso-ji\n* Afternoon: Senso-ji, Ueno Park\n\n**Day 5:**\n\n* Morning: Imperial Palace\n* Afternoon: Shinjuku\n   * Yayoi Kusama Museum, Omoide Yokocho, etc\n\n**Day 6:**\n\n* Morning: Ginza\n* Departure to Kyoto in the afternoon, dinner in Downtown Kyoto/Nishiki Market\n\nDay 7: (is this too tight?)\n\n* Morning: eastern section (kiyomizu-dera and surrounding), \n* afternoon in Arashiyama, evening in Kinkakuji\n\nDay 8:\n\n* morning: fushimi inari shrine, \n* afternoon: travel to Osaka, evening Dotonbori/Shinsekai\n\nDay 9:\n\n* Morning: Osaka Bay Aquarium, Osaka Bay\n* Afternoon: Osaka Castle, Umeda Sky Building, \n* Evening: Kita/Umeda\n\nDay 10: \n\n* Universal Studios\n\nDay 11:\n\n* final shopping in Kita/Umeda, potentially going to back to Dotonbori \n\nDay 12: Departure\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know how this looks!

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nThe problem with visiting Akihabara and Harajuku is a lot of shops in both don't open until 11 or noon.  They really work best if you can put them with a morning activity you can do until they really open.\n\nNishiki Market pretty much closes between 5-6.  You can definitely eat in one of the shops in the covered shopping arcades surrounding Nishiki, but Nishiki itself closes early, so you will presumably be eating an earlyish dinner.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by evening at Kinkakuji.  It also closes at 5 and I want to say last admission is probably 4:30.    So I'm not sure that qualifies as \"evening\" and I think it makes day 7 a little tight depending on how much time you want to spend in Arashiyama and Kiyomizudera.  All 3 tend to be very popular and get quite crowded, so it can be a bit much.\n\nGood luck!",

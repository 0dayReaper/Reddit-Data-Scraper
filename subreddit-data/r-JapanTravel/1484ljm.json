    "postText": "Hey folks!\n\nI'm planning another trip to Jp for September. The plan was to have 2 weeks up north starting from Hakodate and working my way down to Sendai.. I was trying to book some accomodation for Hachinohe during the first week of September and it seems pretty much everything is booked out until Sunday..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was kinda hoping to be in Hachinohe for the Tatehana Morning Markets that Sunday and the only other option was to check out of my Aomori Hotel at like 5AM to catch the Shinkansen and be around Hachinohe around 7:30 to get to the Morning Markets that sunday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there actually any events on during that first week (ie.  4th till 9th of September) that's basically made it impossible to get bookings? xD",

They all need to check out on saturday (9th) OR check-in on 10th itself.. which i found incredibly odd hence my question above if something was on which would cause this..",

If you book an ekimae hotel (the Route Inn is $79 for two) you can sleep in until 6:30am, catch the 6:54am Shinkansen, and arrive at the market at 8am.",

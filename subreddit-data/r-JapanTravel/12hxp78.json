    "postText": "Hi everyone, will be the first time for us as a couple in Japan. Booked the plane tickets as non-refundable tickets in the Fall of last year. And come to find out, my wife is now pregnant! And so this will be our last trip before the baby is here. She will be 25-27 weeks pregnant while we are in Japan. And our OB has cleared us to travel, just not to overexert herself. So a lot of our itinerary will be sparse to allow plenty of time to relax and not feel rushed to see everything. And also allows plenty of time to rest.\n\nBut, if anyone has any recommendations on restaurants to visit or extra places to see, please by all means!\n\nTokyo 5d &gt; Kawaguchiko 2d &gt; Hiroshima 2d &gt; Kyoto 5d &gt; Osaka 2dWill not be buying the JR pass. I will be taking advantage of the Hayatoku 21 for the long travel of this trip (Kawaguchiko&gt;Tokyo Station&gt;Hiroshima) which will be at 15000 JPY/person. So based on my calculation, I will save about 4-6k JPY total by avoiding the pass.\n\n5/5 Friday Land in HND.

    "postText": "Below is our rough itinerary for my husband and I in November this year.We are super excited to go to one of our dream destinations! We like to figure things out when we get there so we have kept the itinerary as loose as possible, but it still seems to be quite packed! We'll be getting the 14 day JR pass just to keep things running smoothly, don't think it will 100% 'pay off' but will be worth it for convenience.\n\n**Sat 04\tTokyo**  \nArrive at Narita in evening - go to hotel, looking to stay in shinjuku areaGrab 7/11 food and rest for the evening.\n\n**Sun 05\tTokyo**  \nExplore surrounding areas: Shinjuku/shibuya/omotesando/takeshita\n\n**Mon 06\tTokyo**  \nExplore Ueno, Akihabara, Asakusa\n\n**Tue 07\tTokyo**  \nOdaiba, Toyosu Market and teamLabs (hopefully Bordeless is open by that time)\n\n**Wed 08\tTokyo**  \nFree day\n\n**Thu 09\tHakone**  \nTravel to Hakone early. Potentially do a tour in JDM cars. Stay at ryokan/onsen\n\n**Fri 10\tHakone**  \nHike and Hakone open air museum. Travel to Kyoto\n\n**Sat 11\tKyoto**  \nExplore\n\n**Sun 12\tKyoto**  \nFuhsimi Inari-taisha (red gate hike), Kinkakuji\n\n**Mon 13\tKyoto**  \nArashiyama (bamboo grove and monkeys), potentially a scenic Sagano train ride\n\n**Tue 14\tOsaka**  \nTravel to Osaka. Eat, look at food, buy food, eat some more, cooking class, eat more, finish the day with some lovely food.\n\n**Wed 15\tOsaka**  \nNara day trip. Also eat food.\n\n**Thu 16\tTokyo**  \nTravel to Tokyo in the morning. Free day to revisit things.\n\n**Fri 17\tTokyo**  \nFree day to revisit things. Potentially a day trip north of Tokyo somewhere?\n\n**Sat 18\tTokyo**  \nFree morning to revisit things  \nDepart Narita in evening\n\n**SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:**\n\n* Stay recommendations throughout please, Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, and Osaka. Interested in finding some out-of-the-ordinary places to stay!\n* I'm getting mixed messages about when we will see the leaves change colour, some say the end of October onwards, and some say the start of December... not a biggie but we booked in November specifically because autumn is our favourite season &lt;3\n* Cooking class recommendations for Osaka - please :) (or elsewhere if there's a better place to do it)\n* Any advice on splitting Tokyo into a few days at the start and a few at the end, or doing it all at the start?\n* Suggestions for day trips to the north of Tokyo? using JR lines if possible?",

It often just shoehorns people into thinking they must go to JR-serviced locations, rather than the freedom to go wherever they want. There are often long lines at JR offices if you need to book a ticket in person or if you run into any issues.\n\nIf you're saving significant money on shinkansen travel, sure, but with your schedule, neither a 7 or 14 day pass makes sense.\n\nhttps://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/",

Don\u2019t really understand how it works yet tho! Haha\n\nDo you book the Shinkansen online, with or without a pass? And do you have to book each train in advance? Or can you just turn up and book the next train? Tia",

            "comment": "I don't think this is a particularly packed trip at all, for a first-time trip I think you have a great sketched out plan. I think a day trip or two (like the one you penciled in for the 17th) to see some smaller places will round things out nicely. \n\nI don't have a ton of time today to write a longer bit, but I'll give a bit of general advice. For out-of-the-ordinary places to stay, as \"basic\" as this sounds I'd say do some hunting on Airbnb. Over my \\~9 weeks in Japan (over 2 trips) I stayed in \\~a dozen Airbnb accommodations, and a few of the ones where I was staying in a room in someone's house were some of the most fun and engaging experiences. The hosts always sought to make the experience a bit more interesting (obviously read reviews, I was specifically seeking out more \"interesting\" places). Outside of \"hosted\" spaces, I also have booked a few really cool private apartments that took me off the beaten path from the types of places where more typical hotels are located. \n\nFor a cooking class, I actually took one in Osaka that was delightful through Airbnb Experiences (I swear I'm not paid by Airbnb), I looked it up and sadly it was discontinued in 2018, but I actually did a small batch of different \"experiences\" in Osaka (I had a hard time finding things I wanted to do on the normal tourist track in Osaka) and really enjoyed all of them. They were a rare opportunity to spend time with actual locals in a setting that isn't like, a bar, or something. I took a cooking class, did a sort of \"bar crawl with an office worker\" a Hanami cherry blossom get together, and a \"make your own takoyaki\" event at a craft beer bar. So, I guess that's my recommendation. \n\nI think Kiyomizudera in Kyoto is a must-see (and worth a good 3-4 hours of time as it has a lot of different sights within the massive temple complex), and I like that you don't have a massive number of sights on the day you plan to see Fushimi Inari. My strong advice for Fushimi Inari is to budget 3-4 hours to give yourself time to hike up to the top of the \"mountain\" (it's really a big hill) and explore all of the little shrines that dot the hillside. The higher up you go the more sparse the crowds! And plan to either get there very early, *or* plan your visit to start late afternoon and end as the sun is setting.",

Bear in mind that Tokyo has the most expensive and the least\u2026 accomodating (smaller rooms, etc.) accomodation in all of Japan. You could potentially save some money and have a more well-rounded experience by choosing to stay a few nights in Kanazawa or Nagano and then loop your way back to Tokyo via Kansai. Alternatively, you could spend some extra days staying in either Kyoto or Osaka, and either spend your time there or taking some daytrips to places like Hiroshima or Nara. Doing this will absolutely make your JR Pass worth it!\n\nIf you absolutely have to stay in Tokyo, then I would strongly urge you to take day trips to Kamakura and Nikko. Both have a great vibe and are easily accessible from Tokyo. Since you were interested in exploring the North, I\u2019d consider Sendai as another possible destination, but be warned that many attractions may still be closed due to the recent earthquake. Be sure to check beforehand just in case.",

I\u2019m the same, I don\u2019t want to be rushed and just ticking boxes off like a checklist. If I\u2019m bored or overwhelmed Im going to have a list of 2-3 additional potential day trips. I think Kyoto has a good amount of antique and handicraft festivals happening in November as well, you should check them out if you\u2019re interested in those!",

Hakone (Get some black eggs, ride the gondala down to the pirate looking ship/ferry and ride that, then maybe the open air museum, also there was a small pizza place that also served HORSE SUSHI in Hakone) and Osaka will be fun (from the food, to slide in a huge building, Universal Studios, dress up as Samuri/Ninjas and learn the history, big China town there too, Kyoto to feed the monkeys is great, and the bamboo forest, also just so you know you can do a boat river tour down stream that lets you off right at the bamboo forest, it's pretty awesome.",

I planned to do \"TOKYO MYSTERY CIRCUS\" and a couple of their puzzle rooms (Which were absolutely fantastic for my family and kids) but man you're shoulder to shoulder with Japanese, and this is middle of the day on a damn Tuesday.. i can't stand it. lines for everything, over priced food and drinks (better off getting vending or find those hole in the wall places). overall, i just really dislike city culture. at least it's super friendly though, and what's up with the girls and guys all dressed up and standing on the sides of the road with signs saying 2000 Yen or 3000 yen? are they for hire or something?",

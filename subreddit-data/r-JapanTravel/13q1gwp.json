    "postText": "Hello! We are getting ready for our first international trip with our 1 year old and I would love feedback on our itinerary.  A few things to note:\n\n* Traveling late June. Flights and accommodations are already booked.\n* Pre-baby, we traveled extensively  internationally.  We know that we are very fast-paced travelers in general. (ie. We've done 6 countries in 4 weeks before.) Definitely is not everyone's style, but it's how we like to travel. We are trying to balance our fast paced travel with our little one's needs this trip.\n* Baby has already done 3 big trips (Hawaii to East coast) in her life.  \n* Baby currently takes 2 naps/day: 9:00 and 14:00, give or take totaling 2-3 hours/day. She can nap in the stroller or carrier but often for less time so we aim to have at least one hotel nap ever other day or so. Sleeps well overnight (11 hours) and we are bringing her pack and play and slumberpod to ensure she keeps that good sleep.\n* I am gluten intolerant so the food I have selected is to accommodate that however, stray bits of soy sauce and cross contamination don't bother me.\n* This itinerary has a ***ton*** of specifics, especially regarding food, because we learned that its hard to research spots we want to go to, on the go, with the baby. I wanted to have a plan with options already laid out but we are also ***very*** flexible knowing that we likely will not get to eat at a good amount of the spots. \n* I do know that some days are overly busy. Again, rather have too much planned and cut as needed and as we are tired than be out and unsure what to do next.\n\nOk thanks!! This is long, I apologize....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Arrival day -**\r\n\n* Land at 16:10 local time in Osaka\r  \nBook train to Kyoto \\*\\*( thinking of booking the 18:48 train, is this enough time?)\n* Arrive at lodging (staying 5 min walk from Goj\u014d Station, 10 min walk from Kyoto station)\r  \n\t\tDinner options:\r  \n\t\t\tGrab takeout in Osaka and eat on the train or in Kyoto station\r  \n\t\t\tRestaurant next door has take out\r  \n\t\t\tWill pass a Lawson\u2019s on walk (grab items)\r  \n\r  \n**Day 1- KYOTO** \r\n* Coffee @ Scene Factory on walk to \r\n* Breakfast @ Machikadoya Karasuma Gojo (kiosk ordering, Japanese breakfast), \r\n* Back for morning nap (9-10:30am)\r\n* Walk to get a treat @ ToShoan (opens at 10am- arrive around 11)\r\n* Nijo Castle (11:30-13:00)\r\n* Lunch @ Teuchi Toru Soba (open 11:30-3) after castle (13:30-14:30)  OR Kikyo Sushi closes 13:30\r\n* Imperial Palace - walk for afternoon nap on the go (free entry) (15:00- 16:00)\r\n   * \\*If time\\* shopping at Musubi-Kyoto for Yukata for Baby \n* Dinner at Soba 10 \u5341\u5272\u854e\u9ea6\u5c02\u9580\u5e97 10\u305d\u3070 (Soba and gf tempura) OR \u2026\u2026 (find alternative nearby\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\r\n\nSnack/Dessert @ IKARIYA BEIKA KYOTO (rice cracker shop open until 19:00)\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Day 2- KYOTO**\r  \n\r\n\n* Nishiki Market before crowds - get some food here\r\n* Back for morning nap\r\n* Lunch at \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* (TBD)\r\n* Kiyomizu-dera\r\n* Explore Gion/ Hanamikoji Street/Pontocho Alley\r\n* Dessert at choupette Kyoto Sentocho (grab these before dinner)\r\n* Stop at Nitta Bakery\r\n\nDinner at Ikkakuju - Shijo Shimmachi \\*make reservation\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Day 3- OSAKA** \n\n\r\n\n* Take train to Osaka (Kyoto station to Osaka Station about 30 minutes) \r\n* Pack some breakfast for Baby (7-11)\r\n* Coffee at SOT COFFEE ROASTER\r\n* Tour Osaka Castle (1.5/2 hours), Baby take nap in carrier/stroller\r\n* Visit Shitenno-ji\r\n* Dotonbori (eat here)\r\n   * Can switch around these 3 activities depending on hunger and nap- all about equidistant  \n* Dinner -TBD- street food grabbed or Uber eats or nearby hotel\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Day 4 - KYOTO** \r\n* Wake up and head straight to Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine (set alarm?)\r\n* Visit Fushimi Inari Taisha - hike loop 3 miles - Baby nap on hike\r\n* Inari to go at \u306f\u306a\u5bb6 \r\n* Grab additional street food\r\n\n***((TWO OPTIONS- depending on energy))***\r\n\n* Head back to hotel for nap/relax\r\n* Return to Gion/ Hanamikoji Street/Pontocho Alley for anything we did not see\r\n   * Dinner options: \r\n      * Kyoto Engine Ramen (opens 16:30, get in line at 16:15/16:30)\r\n      * Soy Milk ramen at Gluten-Free Restaurant \u304e\u3092\u3093\u8c46\u4e73\u3089\uff5e\u3081\u3093 \u3046\u306e\u3086\u304d\u3053\r\n      * Gluten free tonkatsu at Cafe &amp;

It\u2019s going to be a big pain and very time consuming to manage a stroller on the metro and navigate the labyrinthine stations.  I always put him in the front carrier and schlepped him around everywhere; we almost never used our little fold up stroller.  \n\nThat meant a looooot of stair climbing and walking with him.  I think there is also a much higher expectation that children will be quiet regardless of age in restaurants - much more so than in the US or Switzerland.  Any time he made a peep one of us would take him outside to walk around.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to discourage you from going - we loved these these early trips just as much as the more recent ones - but it might be more work than you expect.",

Our son is 9 months and the baby carrier days were such a killer on our backs. Depending on your spots, you can switch between stroller or baby carrier for the day. For example Arashiyama is stroller friendly, Fushimi Inari is not (especially if you wanna do the loop). Kiyomizudera has a stroller friendly path all the way to the top so also stroller friendly! I recommend taking the taxi all the way in too Kiyomizudeea and then exploring San/Ninenzaka area, Gion area by foot after.",

That'll give you a decent idea if people are using them.",

If baby doesn\u2019t walk this will be a lot easier.\n\nWe also struggled to get all the way back to our accommodation for nap time (very time consuming). We often did naps with ideas like: going into a museum and sitting on a bench in a quiet darker corner for 90 minutes (with baby in a Tula carrier).  We even did a nap by going to the uppermost empty seats when we were already inside the sumo arena in Tokyo.",

If we can avoid going back, we definitely will. We're just unsure if she'll need it some days so I wanted to account for it in case. Glad to know that naps on the go worked for you guys like that! We will definitely be trying it.",

We went when baby was 6mo and she was content to stay in the carrier most of time and just quietly look around as we walked wherever and whenever we wanted.\n\nActually we\u2019re headed back to Japan next week for the first time since my story, and the girls are 10 and 8 now so I\u2019m interested to try this new chapter.",

She doesn't like being constricted and loves to just crawl all over. I've tried to allot some crawling or play time most days but I do think I need to find more spots for it, so she can release some energy. I'm hoping that also the business of the cities will distract her because she LOVES watching people and things going on around her, hates calm quiet areas. Haha.\n\nGood luck on your trip! I look forward to traveling with kids at that age! I'm sure you will still face challenges but it also seems so fun and exciting for them to be more aware of what they are experiencing.",

We found it way easier to get around using the baby carrier rather than the stroller ad it was easier to walk and go on the trains with him in the baby carrier!",

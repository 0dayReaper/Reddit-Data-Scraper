    "postText": "**Hotel**: Near Shinjuku station and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\n\n**Locations**: Tokyo only with some day trips to Hakone, Nikko, and Kamakura\n\n**Dates**: 13 Days; Arriving May 21 and Leaving June 2 (both travel days are not booked for anything but travel so really 11 days)\n\n**Interests**: Food, Anime, History/Culture, Shopping, Nightlife\n\nTaking my first visit to Japan in a couple weeks and just wanted to check for any flaws in my plan before I go as well as get some suggestions for some gaps I have in my itinerary. A few things to note, I\u2019m not very well-versed in Japanese but I\u2019ve more than learned the necessary phrases, learned all hiragana and katakana, and have beginner understanding of grammar and a few Kanji but not enough to hold a conversation. I\u2019ll also be traveling solo but I\u2019m no stranger to big cities and I understand the usual do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of being somewhere you\u2019re not from. I\u2019m also looking for nightlife experiences (bars/clubs/live music) so if anybody has recommendations on that front, that would be greatly appreciated. I'm in my mid twenties, very active guy who doesn't mind doing lots of walking/hiking so days where I'll be walking from area to area won't bother me too much.\n\nI don't plan on scheduling each of these to any specific date, this way I can play it by ear on a day-to-day basis, but I do hope to use the pedestrian friendly days for Akihabara and Ginza, a day with nice weather for a trip to Kamakura, and fingers crossed that Mt Fuji will be visible on the Hakone visit. And I plan on revisiting Shinjuku and Shibuya on multiple nights for the bars/clubs. I also tried to organize these items in each day by the order I would go to them but willing to move things around if there is a quicker/easier/cheaper way to get things done.\n\n**Shibuya**\n\n- Breakfast at Eggslut in Shinjuku\n- Meiji Shrine and Yoyogi Park\n- Shopping (Mandarake, Nintendo, Donquijote, Animate, Tower Records, Miyashita Park)\n- Lunch and Dinner options I'm looking at are BeBu-Ya Yakiniku, Ichiran Ramen, and Uobei Sushi\n- Shibuya Crossing and Hachiko Statue\n- Shibuya Sky and Shibuya Scramble Square\n- Going back to hotel to drop things off, then back to Shibuya for Bars/Clubs/Arcades into late night\n- TAITO Station and Adores Shibuya\n- Ce La Vi Tokyo, Harlem, Womb, whichever seems to be the most foreigner friendly\n\n**Roppongi**\n\n- Breakfast in Shinjuku at Sarabeth's LUMINE 2\n- Zojoji Shrine\n- Tokyo Tower and RED Tokyo Tower\n- Honda Exhibit near Aoyama Station\n- Eat lunch at Tokyo Midtown (Open for suggestions)\n- If time permits, I'd love to visit one of the museums in the area, any common favorites?\\\n- Tokyo Midtown Shopping\n- Roppongi Hills and Tokyo City View at night\n- Dinner at Maruya-Honten Unagi\n\n**Odaiba**\n\n- Convenience Store breakfast\n- Hamarikyu Gardens\n- Tokyo Water Bus Cruise from Hinode Pier to Odaiba Seaside Park\n- Walk the beach/parks to National Museum of Emerging Science\n- Gundam Statue\n- Lunch at The Grill on 30th\n- DiverCity/Aquacity/Decks Shopping\n- See the view at Hachitama\n- TeamLab Planets\n- Dinner at Ichiran Ramen in Shinjuku\n\n**Ginza**\n\n- Grab something quick to eat in Shinjuku\n- Spending the morning walking the Imperial Palace and Royal Gardens\n- Eating at Fluffy Pancake in Ginza\n- Nissan Crossing Exhibit\n- Art Aquarium Museum\n- Ginza Six Mall\n- More food at Kyushu Jangara Ginza\n- Seiko Museum\n- Walk Chuo Dori street and pretend I can afford things\n- Dinner in Ginza (Any suggestions?)\n\n**Ueno**\n\n- Starbucks in Ueno Park\n- Ueno Zoo\n- Tokyo National Museum\n- National Museum of Nature and Science\n- Shinobazunoike Bentendo Temple\n- Toshogu Shrine\n- Hard Rock Cafe\n- Ameyoko Shopping District\n- Ending the night with a baseball game at Tokyo Dome\n- Any time leftover I will spend browsing through Akihabara\n\n**Asakusa + Akihabara**\n\nI don't plan on spending much time in Asakusa and wanted to split the day with shopping in Akihabara.\n\n- Breakfast at Kirby Cafe\n- Tokyo SkyTree\n- Sumida Aquarium\n- Tokyo Solomachi Mall\n- Sensoji Temple\n- Nakamise-dori Street\n- Hoping to find some good street food between Asakusa and Akihabara\n- Then mostly just shopping and exploring in Akihabara for the evening/night\n- Mandarake, Animate, Don Quijote, Super Potato, amiami, Sofmap, GiGO, Akihabara Radio Kaikan (and more)\n- Dinner at Gyukatsu Ichi Ni San Tonkatsu\n\n**Shinjuku**\n\nSince my hotel is so close to Shinjuku, I plan to spend multiple nights going around exploring for different restaurants, izakayas, stores, and just things to do. So this list will be vary vague but there's a lot of stuff to see here. More than likely, my first day will be spent in Shinjuku so I can get a bit more used to the city before getting on any public transport.\n\n* Golden Gai\n* Kabukicho\n* Omoide Yokocho\n* Shin-Okubo Koreatown\n* Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\n* Shinjuku Central Park\n* Shinjuku Gyoen\n* Your Name stairs location\n* Shopping Malls/Department Stores (Lumine, Mylord, Isetan, etc.)\n\n**Hakone**\n\n- Take the Tokaido line to Odawara Station\n- Up to Gora via Hakone Tozan Railway\n- Open Air Museum and Gora Park\n- Cable Car from Gora/Sounzan up to Owakudani for views and souvenirs\n- Ropeway down to Togendai and Pirate Ship Ferry back to Hakone-machi\n- Walk to the Hakone Checkpoint, Detached Palace Garden, and Ancient Cedar Ave\n- Hakone Shrine and Heiwa no Torii Shrine\n- Leave via bus from Moto-Hakone to Hakone-Yumoto\n- If time permits, I plan to use one of the hot springs in Yumoto (Any suggestions?)\n\n**Nikko**\n\n- Taking the Limited Express train from Asakusa to Tobu-Nikko Station via Nikko-Kinugawa line\n- Walk through Nikko to Shinkyo Bridge\n- Shoyoen Garden --&gt; Rinnoji Temple --&gt; Toshogu Shrine --&gt; Taiyu-in Temple Hall --&gt; Tamozawa Imperial Villa\n- Kanmangafuchi Abyss\n- Nikko Botanical Gardens\n- Nikkowanoshiro Onsen Hot Springs\n- Bus back down to Nikko and train back to Asakusa\n\n**Kamakura**\n\n- 1 hour train to Enoshima using the Romancecar\n- Breakfast at Eggs 'n Things\n- Enoshima Aquarium\n- Enoshima Station to Hase Station using Enoden line\n- Hasedera Temple and Kotoku-in Temple\n- Huge fan of the beach so I plan to spend some time enjoying the view\n- Lunch at Kua Aina Sandwich Shop\n- I would like to visit as many temples/shrines while I'm here, but being that they're so spread out, what are some of the favorites and what should I just skip altogether? I would at the very least like to visit Hokokuji Temple and the bamboo forest experience.\n- Explore Komachi-dori Street\n- Grab dinner at a local restaurant (Any suggestions?)\n- Take the train back via Yokosuka Line\n\n**Free day**\n\nLeaving myself an extra day in case things go wrong at places and I need to revisit on another day to actually experience them. In the case that everything goes well, I'm hoping to pick up on some things that are a little spread out throughout the city and explore some residential areas.\n\n- Ghibli Museum\n- Nakano Broadway\n- Sunshine City and Sunshine 60 Observatory\n- Spend some time in Ikebukuro\n- Street Karting\n- Tokyo Sea Life Park\n- Sumo Wrestling Match\n\n**Questions**\n\nWhat here is worth skipping?\n\nAre these days too overpacked?\n\nAnything I should add?",

A lot of interesting shops in nakano broadway too. There are a lot of food at B1 and one shop selling like 30cm tall ice cream. And oh, don't eat at ichiran shinjuku, you will be waiting forever. Eat at ichiran nakano broadway ;)",

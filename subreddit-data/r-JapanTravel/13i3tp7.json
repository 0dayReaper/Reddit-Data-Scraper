I don't mean this as a criticism as I loved the stay but it was quite shabby and the baths definitely have seen better days. It was very clean though. There are many options in Gora if you book in advance though.",

The hotel was good and comfortable.\n\nIt was not the best Onsen I have been to Japan, but it has nice indoor and outdoor baths.  \nThere are also some touristy shops in the area.  \n\nI think its a great option when you only have time for a quick layover when traveling on the Shinkansen.",

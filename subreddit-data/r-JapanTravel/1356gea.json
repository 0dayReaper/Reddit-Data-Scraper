    "postText": "My flight would land in Haneda on a Friday from JFK 135PM and I need to go directly to Kawaguchiko. \n\nWhat would be the best way to do this? It's seriously confusing as a lot of information is outdated.\n\n1/ I was trying to see if I can go to Shinjuki and then ride the Fuji Excursion train, but it seems to be only available in the morning.  Everytime I search for something on the JR website to book a ticket there's nothing available. Am I doing something wrong?\nhttps://www.eki-net.com/en/jreast-train-reservation/reserve/wb/RouteSearchConditionInputByStation/Index\n\n2/ I've seen online an airport bus/limousine from Haneda to Fujisan Railway Station/Kawaguchiko but it seems like they're now cancelled and it's only available on weekends (which wouldn't work for me since I'm landing Friday afternoon). https://hnd-bus.com/airport/h-kawaguchiko/\n\n3/ There is a bus from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko, using the Chuo Bus but my wife would like to avoid that since we have our luggage and she is uncomfortable on buses especially if we have to transfer from Haneda to Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko. \n\n4/ Is there a recommended taxi service that I could use to book ahead to pick us up from Haneda to Kawaguchiko? How much would that probably be? I tried to download the GO taxi app, but I don't have a Japan number so I can't even sign up. I'm afraid if I try to hail a cab the day I arrive they won't take me because of the distance. If this is not the case, please let me know.\n\nAny advice would help as this is all too hectic and it's becoming a bit overwhelming with some outdated information going on.",

That's not cheap, but up to you.\n\nLeaves us with 3, which is not that complicated honestly. Those are highway buses, not city buses, they are confortable enough. You can also take a bus from the airport to Shinjuku (there are shitloads). \n\nShould be maybe 3 hours, my guess is if you land at 135, you should be not too far your hotel at 630pm.",

It's even easier if you take the limousine bus from Haneda to Shinjuku, no transfers and luggage juggling on the train.",

Even with only one large suitcase I always go for the limo bus to my destination area from airport since it's so much better than taking the train.\n\nTo OP, those limo bus are like the tour buses you take when you're on a local trip, not the same public transit buses you're taking to go to work.",

Coming from the East Coast, the jetlag is brutal. \n\nKawaguchiko is not close to Tokyo and does require a bit of thinking to navigate to on a normal day. I would stay in Tokyo for at least a night before moving out that way but that's just me. If you can't switch up your plans then rip.",

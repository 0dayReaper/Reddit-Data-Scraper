    "postText": "**Overall planning**\n\nTokyo: March 27-April 2, leave for Takayama around 3 and arrive around 7\n\nTakayama: April 2-4, after Hida no Sato, 3 pm train to Kanazawa\n\nKanazawa: April 4-7, early departure\n\nMatsumoto: April 7-8, early departure\n\nTokyo: April 8-9, fly out @ 5\n\nWhile I'm not a stranger to the overall flow of traveling to and in Japan, I didn't have experience with smaller cities. It didn't seem like an issue to me, but I think only having experience with Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka with smaller cities being day trips (Nara, Kamakura) made my concept of time and scale a little off. For both Takayama and Kanazawa, I definitely was very generous with my time.\n\nIf I had to plan everything again, I'd keep the afternoon travel from Tokyo to Takayama as well as Takayama to Kanazawa, but I'd have left Kanazawa in the afternoon of the second day. I just ended up finishing up at Higashi Chaya around 1, poked around Omicho again, and then spent time at the mall next to the station before having dinner. I could have left for Matsumoto around 3 or 4 instead. Then I'd spend the morning in Matsumoto and head back to Tokyo in the afternoon. I could have maybe tightened things up a bit more an got Meiji-mura in, which I left out when I couldn't get my plan plus Meiji-mura into the 7 day window for a rail pass. It's just tough when you want to see as much as possible, but you want to be able to take your time and also not feel like you're hoping on 2 hour train rides almost every day.\n\n**General**\n\n* Don't worry about finding only 7 Bank or Post Office ATMs. You can now use Lawson and Family Mart ones as well. While there are 7 Bank ATMs all over, sometimes you just can't find one when you need it.\n\n* Money wise, I still stuck to mostly cash, maybe out of habit. Though I'd definitely make sure to have cash for restaurants and food vendors. I spent about $1300USD between cash and credit. I probably did about $500-600 of that in shopping, and the rest was food, some transportation (I put \u00a55000 on my Pasmo before arrival), and admissions. Hotels were $945 in total. My flight was paid with miles. I paid for a lot in advance, and it's definitely something I'll do in the future.\n\n* If you never use you smallest coins at home, you probably won't in Japan. I always had lots of pennies on me when cash was more common. I always have lots of \u00a51 coins, and I did start to feel more comfortable eyeballing what I had within a few days. There are periods where I had a lot of coins because I was always like \u00a5100 short of what I needed, then I'd have a ton of coins, use those, and start the cycle again.\n\n* 7-11 umbrellas are superior to Family Mart. When I woke up to leave Kanazawa, it was rainy, so I ran to Family Mart to get an umbrella. It was taken out by a single wind gust in Mastumoto. Thankfully, it was mostly just drizzling by then. A few hours later the rain picked up, and I popped into 7-11 to pick up a new umbrella. This one lasted through multiple wind gusts and stayed with me to Tokyo.\n\n* A lot of museums in Japan don't really have a permanent collection. I experienced this on my last trip when I went to 21_21 Design Site and only half of it was open. For some reason, I didn't check the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa to see there was only one gallery open. Also, wasn't super into the Buddhist ceremonial vessels exhibit at Nezu Museum, though the back garden was really cool.\n\n* I stayed in Uguisudani. This was my first time staying on the Yamanote line, and I finally get why it's so recommended. Actually it was really nice being at a quiet stop, especially headed towards Ueno/Akihabara/Tokyo, because the trains empty out by Nippori. My hotel (Landabout) was also 250m from the station, but Ueno was definitely close enough to walk if you want. The Iriya stop on the Hibiya line was 400m away, and there was a bus stop just outside with buses that could take you to Asakusa and Skytree in 10-15 minutes. The only pain was just the general pain of staying in the east and going west, and there wasn't a line very close that could be a shortcut, like taking the Chuo line from Kanda to Yoyogi/Shinjuku.\n\n* Don't fear the buses. If it's the best route on Google Maps, do it. If it's a shortcut to a train, do it. In central Tokyo, you tap in at the front, press the button for you stop, exit out the rear. Very simple. Once you're outside the 26 wards, it might change. I remember going to the Edo Tokyo Open Air Architecture Museum in Mitaka on my last trip. On that one you do enter on the side, which means you tap in and tap out. I've found that to be a pretty good way to distinguish when you pay. Enter in the front, just tap in. Enter in the middle, tap in and tap out (or get a ticket and pay at the end).\n\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Cherry blossoms in Aoyama and Yanaka Cemeteries. Both have small roads running through the cemetery which have cherry blossom trees planted down each side. The road in Yanaka Cemetery is a bit wider, so it doesn't quite have the tunnel of blossoms that you get in Aoyama. Obviously, since they're not really places most people will be hanging around, they're nice, peaceful places to walk through. The Meguro river is busy, but I found it to be pretty manageable. While they did have lights and food vendors, they roped off the little areas where you can sit along the river. Chidoridafuchi was okay. Renting a boat is definitely the ideal experience, which I did not do.\n\n* Yanaka and Jimbocho. Yanaka has an older feeling and Jimbocho is known for second hand books. I timed both these places a bit poorly. I went to Yanaka a bit early and Jimbocho late. I enjoyed the time I was in both, but for later trips, they're places I want to get into more.\n\n* Design Festa *Gallery and D47. Design Festa is a free gallery in Harajuku that features mostly young and student artists. D47 is in Shibuya Hikarie and has a small exhibit featuring designs and crafts from a specific prefecture. They're both small, but they're nice and central spots to pop into for a little bit of art and design. D47 has a shop with the exhibit as well as a separate food hall featuring local foods.\n\n* Shibuya Sky. I bought tickets for sunset, and it was overcast that day. If I did it again, I would do an evening ticket to get the city lights that I'd buy a couple days in advance on a day I'd know it's not raining. I'm sure seeing the sunset is great, but you have to get those tickets so far in advance that you're gambling on actually getting to see a sunset.\n\n* I was disappointed with Kawagoe. Coming in, I was really excited about the building and history of the buildings, but it was more about the shops. It was also pretty busy, or at least that there's just not that much space for all the visitors. I just wish that there was one building that you could tour and learn about the area. Or there is, and I just missed it. I should have gone to Omiya after for the bonsai trees, but I went back to Ikebukuro and Sunshine City. I did get to the huge gacha shop in the Bandai shop, which, as someone with a weakness for gacha, was really overwhelming. I liked it, but limiting myself was tough.\n\n* On the other hand, I really liked Takayama. Since I got there the night before, I was able to get out early and walk around Sanmachi district when there wasn't anyone on the streets. And even in the afternoon, there was still enough room to enjoy the area. I did run into a problem that I remember from Kyoto, and that is choosing what to pay to get into. While nothing what terribly expensive, it does add up. I wish I did a better job at prioritizing spots instead of starting to see them all, then just excluding later ones, because you're already \u00a52700 in.\n\n* Showa Museum in Takayama. The entrance fee is a bit steep (\u00a51000), but it was a cool, unique place. They had rooms set up with different aspects of daily life. There was also a room with games on old CRT monitors, another with old Pachinko machines, and a little theater with a movie playing. If you like old-fashioned things, I think it's worth checking out.\n\n* Hida Folk Village. I was stuck between this and going to Shirakawa-go. I was recommended it when I asked on this sub, and I was glad I went. My interest is in the buildings and their history, and I liked that the folk village is a museum. You can go into almost all the buildings, and read about them or what was going on in those buildings. There are also some artisans working in the buildings, a guy doing wood sculptures and a lady doing sachiko. I only took a bit over an hour to go through everything, and I went pretty slow.\n\n* Omicho Market is a great first stop in Kanazawa. It's not open super-early, more of a 9 or 10 am visit. There's also more than just fish as well. I had some good croquettes, a place with purin, and there was a pretty good local brewery.\n\n* Kanazawa castle park is nice, but the newly constructed gate you can visit wasn't really worth it. I did get a discount combo ticket with Kenrokuen, so it wasn't that much of a waste. The gate from the castle park to Kenrokuen is probably one of the best places for sakura. Kenrokuen its self was nice. I liked stumbling on the people doing wedding photos in the cherry blossoms. \n\n* I was kind of surprised at the size of Mastumoto castle. It was still great to see, but it was definitely a bit smaller than I was expecting. The weather that day was terrible, cold, rainy, and windy, otherwise I would have spent more time in the castle park, maybe have a little combini picnic.\n\n* Matsumoto Art Museum. Since it's Yayoi Kusama's home town, that's the focus of the museum, and it's definitely a highlight. I went to the stand-along museum in Shinjuku on my last trip in 2018, and I think this was better. There were more, larger, installations. There was also more of a focus on it as a retrospective, so there was older work in there as well.\n\nI'm definitely done with trying to go during cherry blossom season. Any future trips will probably be more late February/early March. It might also be fun to be there for Setsubun. I know that things are busy all the time in a place like Tokyo, but just less busy would be nice.",

Think could have sneaked in the Tateyama Alpine Route from Toyama to Matsumoto\n\nWere you able to try the premium Hida beef in Takayama? It was amazing.",

I wanted to keep my meals below \u00a54000, so yakiniku was hard at that price point. I had some sushi at Hida Kotte, and did hida beef ramen at Le Midi.",

    "postText": "I continued my journey out of Fukuoka heading north and passing through Kitakyushu, the last major city in Kyushu. There were very heavy rains on my way and I was completely soaked through most of the ride. I kept pushing through the rain since I'm so behind schedule.\r  \n\r  \nOnce in Kitakyushu, I stopped for a night at a hotel and continued my journey. I took a quick ferry (5 minutes) across to the main Island of Honshu. I decided to hug to coast for a flatter route. I've always been surprised to find obscure American brands along my ride. I found a YMCA and ToysRUS in the countryside. I even found a statue of Elvis Presley in a small town. \r  \n\r  \nThe many outdoor vending machines have helped me a lot throughout my Adventure. I was surprised at how sophisticated they can get, I found some for Ramen, Mochi, Cake, and more!\r As I stopped to get a water bottle at one machine a man noticed my bike and my luggage. He introduced himself as Ichiro and he was a teacher of Japanese Classics. He showed me a Tanaka poem he wrote and gave a short lesson. He offered to teach me more in the evening but sadly I was only passing through that town.  I hope to return to take him up on his lesson someday. \r  \n\r  \nAs I biked through the Yamaguchi coast I was blown away by the views. Deep bright blue waters, yellow beaches, and cool winds. \rAfter traveling through the countryside I decided to stay at a small family-run hotel in Hirao called the Hotel New Hirao. They were surprised since It was rare for a non-Japanese to come to such a remote town. When I checked in I told the staff about my adventure throughout Japan and they offered to give me a tour of their city and nearby castle. I accepted and decided to take a rest day!\n\nI was grateful that they drove us. I forgot how easy cars made everything. We explored Iwakuni Castle and the Kintaikyo bridge, a bridge older than the United States that was made without nails or screws. We also went to a local bazaar where we grabbed lunch. It was a very local place. I didn't notice any other foreigners there. The Onigiri was massive, I was used to the small ones from 711. I learned more about their lives and the hotel that had been in their family for 70 years. \r  \n\r  \nI thanked them for everything. Once again I was humbled by the kindness of the people of Japan and beauty of the this country.   \n\n\nPhotos are attached below!\n\n[Photo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kfO9by_5BbL9z7AWy_7I6dY63WfnM0x5?usp=share_link)",

It took me three months to cross America and 14 hours to go across Japan!  (I went from Nagoya to to the Japan Sea in Nigata, 340 KM)    I never did a multi week trip in Japan, but I did bicycle from Osaka to the the center of Shikoku for a few days.  I loved cycling in Shikoku, some incredible mountain passes.  I also cycled a bit in Nara, Wakayama and Tsu.  My advice is to avoid tunnels at all cost, they can be very dangerous.   Update us, if you have the time.  Stay safe!",

Don't be so full of yourself. People are people wherever you go and wherever they go. Meeting other foreigners in no way lessens the experience....unless you make it that way.",

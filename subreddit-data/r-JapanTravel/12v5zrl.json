I will be I will be travelling in the months of the 1st of October 30th. \n\nTokyo: I will stay 3 days in Tokyo exploring the akihabara district, Harajuku , Senso ji temple and the Roppongi District. I will be staying In a hostel. \n\nOkinawa: I would then take a flight from Tokyo directly to Okinawa, where I would stay for 3 days. I will stay in Naha, visit the aquarium and Peace memorial museum. \n\nNagasaki: I will stay 3 days in Nagasaki and visit Nagasaki's peace statue, Meganebashi, Tashirojima and  Mount Inasayama \n\nHiroshima: I will then travel up to Hiroshima for another 3 days for the Nuclear museum, Genbaku dome, Itsukushima Jinja.\n\nKyoto + Osaka+Nara: I will stay for 1 week. I would visit Fushimi Inari Taisha, Kiyomizu dera, Hanamikoji Street, Arashiyama, Kinkaku-ji, Higashi Hogan-ji temple. I would visit Nara then go north to Amanihashidate. In Osaka I'll explore the street and night life and visit Dotonbori.\n\nFuji: I'll visit the five fuji lakes, Mount Fuji, Hakone but I'm thinking of maybe doing it in the beginning with Tokyo. \n\nSapporo: I'll visit Hokkaido and stay in Sapporo for a 4 days taking in the ramem and autumn trees.\n\nTokyo: heading back to Tokyo via plane to do some final visits such the Ghibli and art museum. Then on the 30th heading back to Heathrow vai Narita. \n\nI just ask if this is a realistic way to do things or better way to visit Japan. I kind of want to absorb the best I can but not in a hastily manour. My estimates for this trip is around 2500-3000GBP. If you have any better itineraries and ideas please do suggest them or anything you wouldn't recommend to go or do. My budget is 5000GBP",

I'm currently in Tokyo on my last night of a 10-day trip, and the highlight has been collecting goshuin across Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. These are mementos that no souvenir could ever replace. This is my fourth time visiting Japan, but first time collecting goshuin, and MAN I wish I had done this for all of my previous trips.\n\n[Here's a good primer on goshuin if you need it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/6wyt0z/guide_temple_and_shrine_stamps_aka_what_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1)",

If you wanna see Fuji San, best to stay 1 night minimum just in case the weather got tricky. \n\nI suggest leaving Okinawa to another trip and just visit Hiroshima in this trip. It is also convenient to fly from Tokyo/ Osaka to Sapporo.",

So we've decided to cut Kyushu, Hiroshima and Hokaido (among many other regions). It's then up to you to make your own choices :)\n\nCheers !",

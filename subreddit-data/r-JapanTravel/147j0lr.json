Both places have an overwhelming number of cat-themed decorations.  There's also a cat themed bookstore called Anegawa Nyankodo in Jimbocho, Tokyo.  And Yanaka has a ton of little cat-themed shops and cafes.  You can get cat tail donuts and cat paw cakes.  If the main street is too busy, the resident cats are probably chilling in Yanaka Cemetery.  \n\nIn Kyoto, there's Nyan-nyan-ji Temple (a cat cafe/gift shop/temple with cats dressed in priest costumes).  Shonenji Temple honors a cat that helped save the temple, and you can get charms for the health and safety of pet cats.  \n\nNot sure when you'll be in Nara, but the whole month of June is the \"Nyaramachi Neko Art Festival.\"",

                    "comment": "I honestly wouldn't recommend going out of the way to ride on the Wakayama Dentetsu, especially from Kyoto. It would be a couple of hours and a couple of transfers just to get to Wakayama Station from Kyoto Station, and IMO, it's not really worth it. The themed trains themselves are essentially designed for children, and the two stations the cats are at (Idakiso and Kishi) have literally _nothing else_ at them except for a tiny gift shop and a tiny little glass window with a cat in it (and Kishi has a tiny cafe where you can get pretty boring \"themed\" food).\n\nOverall, it's very clearly an entire experience meant for kids, and the train is mostly packed with foreign tourists. Worth it, maybe, if you're already at Wakayama Station (like I was), but definitely not if you need to spend 2 hours and some decent money to get there.",

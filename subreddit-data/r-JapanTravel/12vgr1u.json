    "postText": "Yo yo!\n\nIf the flag is incorrect, my apologies \n\nSo I decided to take a 10 day solo trip to Japan in December. This is my first solo trip so I\u2019m watching videos, getting advice, and doing anything I can to prepare. I know the main cities I plan to visit is Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. I got my itinerary from a friend who had plans to go to Japan but unfortunately he couldn\u2019t go because he had a baby. I have to make some adjustments due to the weather (pretty sure I can\u2019t visit Mt. Funji in December). \n\nI was told to buy my plane tickets 3 to 6 months before the trip for the best price. I heard to use booking.com for the hotels/Ryokans. I also heard is cheaper to get hotel stay when I\u2019m actually over there (I don\u2019t really believe this, but I don\u2019t want to assume) I need to get the JR Pass for travel.\n\nThe plan is to spend 5 days in Tokyo, 2 days in Osaka, and 3 days in Kyoto. The plans isn\u2019t concrete, so I\u2019m definitely flexible with my itinerary. \n\nMind if I ask for feedback for the itinerary, plans on buying tickets, or just any feedback to help make this trip as smooth as possible?\n\nI appreciate everyone\u2019s time\n\nKyoto Day 1 \nNijo Castle\nNishiki Market Shopping District \nPontocho District \nMaruyama Park\nKodai-ji Temple\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\n\nKyoto Day 2\nRyoanji Temple \n\nKyoto Day 3\nPhilosophers Walk\nFushimi Inari-taisha Shrine\nKinkakuji Temple\n\nOsaka Day 1\nOsaka Castle\nKuromon Market\nUmeda Sky Building\nDotombori District \n\nOsaka Day 2\nOsaka Aquarium \nNipponbashi Denden Town \n\nTokyo Day 1\nTeamLab\nIntro\nUeno Park\nAkihabara\nTsukiji Jogai Market\nOdaiba District \n\nTokyo Day 2\nTokyo DisneySea\n\nTokyo Day 3\nMori Art Museum \nGhibli Museum Mitaka\nShibuya Crossing\nOmotesando \nMeiji Jingu Shrine\nOmoide Yokocho\nJazzBar Samurai \n\nTokyo Day 4\nYudaki Falls\nShinkyo Bridge\nNikko Tosho-gu \nSenjogahara Field\n\nTokyo Day 5\nMount Fuji\n\nSuggested Places People Recommend\nHot Springs in Kyoto \nGolden Gai \nRoppongi Strip",

            "comment": "so lets try to make your first trip a good one\n\nI cant tell you when the flights are cheapest, there are a lot of \"tricks\" out there, but I believe, while there may be statistical significance there, personally, it mostly boils down to luck. that being said, flying on the weekend usually is more expensive\n\nI like getting hotels via booking.com -  I know they take their cut, and in theory it can be cheaper. but for that you need to be able to find and communicate with the hotel, and kinda sorta hope nothing goes wrong. Additionally I feel like there are a number of places that dont really wanna deal with bookings outside of their chosen third party websites.\n\nthe jr ticket may be dead with the price increase. and with one kanto-kansai trip and back you would barely break even with the old price.\n\nmy advise for a first timer might be not to try to do too much, especially if you only have a week. stick with low time investment high return activities.\n\nSo... on to your plan. you start with kyoto. thats... logistically not smart. you either land in tokyo or osaka (usually, I mean you could land in sapporo, what do I know...)\n\nso your first day will be there\n\nso to the real plan\n\nKyoto day 1: that plan is not possible and at least 1.5 if not 2 days of stuff to do. Do not miss the higashiyama district, and you can enjoy pontocho in the evening, but nishiki (which is close by) is a daytime activity. nijo castle is nice, but with 3 days in kyoto maybe not the highes priority. I think you should do higashiyama and another day nishiki and in the evening pontocho.\n\nkyoto 2: that is very light. and the day you go ryoanji is the day you should be doing kinkakuji. if you start really early, that is the day you could add a nishiki afternoon\n\nkyoto 3: the walk in december will be... nice, not sure if its worth the time. start real early with fushimi inari, have a afternoon for arashiyama. not a perfect plan because you will be wasting a good hour in the bus, but... with the current day 1 and 2 this would make the most sense to me\n\nand you can find a lot of sentos (onsens with artificially heated water) in kyoto. they are not anime-pretty, but you can find one close to your hotel and go there in the evening. enjoy the hot water. a more pretty onsen will probably require a more dedicated time investment\n\nDo you want to see fish in aquarium, and spend time in disneysea? that would be quite a few hours you could use for something else, if you have similar experiences at home...  \njust food for though...",

They have a huge tank full of whale sharks, which was amazing and something I had never seen before.\n\n The other good thing about the aquarium is it is open til 8pm, so could be easy to fit in 2 hours or so in the evening as something to do before dinner and still have most of your day free to do other things.",

If you wait too much you risk the cheaper places tonne full.\n\nSeveral of your days are all over the place or in strange order. Just check on google maps where things are and how to move between them and how long it will take.\n\nNikko seeing the temple area and waterfalls is not impossible but you will need to be there as early as possible and it will be a quite full day, would be better over 2 days to have time to properly see things.",

            "comment": "For plane tickets, I suggest start looking for prices 6 months in advance (use Google Flights or Skyscanner), and when you had a rough idea of the avg price, start looking for deals. For hotels, it's recommended to book in advance (3-6 months), as you were said. Booking.com is a good option, and my recommended one. Keep looking in advance, but I suggest only booking after you have your itinerary mostly done, to get a good place and optimize your time.\n\nRegarding JR Pass, it's not needed at all. JR Pass will increase its price during this year, and it's worthy only if you do a lot of long travels, like shinkansens. City trains won't make the JR Pass worth from both economically and practically perspective. If you plan to go to KIX airport and departure from NRT, then it's only 1 shinkansen that would cost 15,000 JPY.\n\nFor the itinerary, in general it looks very crowded. What I recommend for initial planning is using Google Maps or Google My Maps: pin EVERYTHING that you want to check, and group them by how near are to each other.\n\nKyoto Day 1: Kodai-ji, Kiyomizu-dera and Maruyama Park can take an entire day by themselves. Plus you don't have much transportations options to one another, so you'll probably be walking between them. I suggest looking for places near them, like Yasaka Shrine, Kennin-ji and Shoren-in. Nijo Castle can make another day with Pontocho and Nishiki Market, since there is a train line between both.\n\nKyoto Day 2: You can group Kinkaku-ji and Ninna-ji with Ryoan-ji, because the day 3 is insane crowded.\n\nKyoto Day 3: For me it's the most challenging day, because both 3 are very far from each other. Kinkaku-ji really don't fit the rest, because it's way too far, almost in the opposite side of the city, so I suggested transferring to Day 2. Also, if you want to go to the top of Fushimi Inari-taisha, it takes a couple of hours and it's somewhat physically demanding, so double check if you want to take a bus to Philosopher's Path, which is also far. If you're there, check Ginkaku-ji (but not as good as Kinkaku-ji).\n\nOsaka Day 2: If you like anime stuff, the day is OK. If you're not that into anime, maybe you can also spend some time at the stores on Namba, which is neighboor to Nipponbashi.\n\nTokyo Day 1: Too busy, and you'll probably spend some time transferring to your hotel after the shinkansen, so I suggest going only to TeamLab + Odaiba + Tsukiji, or Ueno + Akihabara.\n\nTokyo Day 5: Day trip to Fujisan? Double check what exactly do you want to do in the region, because I think it's very challenging to do a day trip, and this being the last day of your trip.",

The train between cities are only 30min and you avoid hotel hopping (carrying luggage between cities can be a pain in the neck sometimes).\n\nIf you are an anime fan, definitely check Denden Town and Akihabara, and if possible, Nakano Broadway (Tokyo). Additionally, for second-hand stuff, BOOK-OFF is a VERY good option: they have good prices and have stores scattered around all the three cities.\n\nHope you have nice trip!",

December is a wonderful time, we had great weather.\n\nMy biggest issue with your itinerary is that I don't think you have accounted for travel time. E.g. on Tokyo day 1, travelling from Osaka to Tokyo takes 3 hours, plus the time getting to and from your accomodation. You have a lot of stuff booked on that day, it would be pretty hectic. Even stuff like the Ghibli museum takes time to get to. It is half an hour by train but then when we went it was a bit of a walk from the station and a long line to get in to the museum. Make sure you are accounting for time when you plan things.\n\nAlso keep in mind, Japan is amazing but a lot of people find it can be quite a tiring holiday. You are doing a lot of travelling and a lot of walking, so planning a day with a hundred different things to do is going to make you feel pretty burned out. Try to be realistic with your planning. We planned a couple of things we definitely wanted to do, and a few things we were open to but didnt see as essential. That way, if we were too tired we could always skip those. On top of that, during our trip there were so many unexpected things we found, that werent in our plan. So it was nice to have the flexibility to explore things as they came up.",

So if you can adjust which day you can go, it will be very helpful for getting a better deal.\n\nHotel, just book it beforehand, december is peak season, so don't wait. I used agoda, and so far so good. Book a hotel that is really close to station\n\nKyoto on day one is kinda time consuming. you will land on either osaka or tokyo.\n\nJr pass will be dead soon, on october they will increase the price from 29K to 50K yen per person. Just try to calculate it, for example, if it is cheaper to fly in to tokyo and fly out from osaka or vice versa (so you only need to buy one ticket)\n\nIMO, it should be:\n\nTokyo kyoto osaka\n\nOr osaka kyoto tokyo\n\n\nLastly: google map is your best friend, try to check how many minutes / hours needed from one place to another, and see if it is doable or not",

            "comment": "Others have already pointed out most of the problems of your plans. But on a few specific points:\n\nUnlike Tokyo or Osaka, you'll rely on buses a lot in Kyoto, so travel is much less efficient and predictable. \n\n&gt;I also heard is cheaper to get hotel stay when I\u2019m actually over there\n\nIt's possible to book last minute, but I don't recommend it. You'll end up paying more for the popular/convenient areas, or you'll end up staying in some awkward neighbourhood far away from the attractions. This has been especially true this year; lots of tourists are trying to make up for not being able to travel during the pandemic, and it definately feels busier than my last trips. That's despite Japan's biggest tourist group (China) not being back to normal yet. Accommodation usually start taking booking 3-6 months out. \n\n&gt;I need to get the JR Pass for travel.\n\nNo you don't. Even at the current, cheaper price; a 7 day pass only breaks even if you do a Tokyo to Kyoto/Osaka round trip. If your only Shinkansen travel is Osaka to Tokyo one way, (which I assume it is because no one can realistically arrive in Tokyo, take a train to Kyoto and do what you plan), the JR pass is very far from breaking even.\n\n&gt;Tokyo Day 5 Mount Fuji\n\nNot sure what you mean by this; Mt Fuji area is a huge area and will take days to explore. You can only climb it during summer. Most people are content with seeing it from afar (although that requires a bit of luck since it's often under clouds). The classic postcard view is from Kawaguchiko but Hakone is another popular place to see it from. On a good day, it's even visible from the observation platforms in Tokyo. \n\n&gt;Hot Springs in Kyoto\n\nKyoto isn't known as a hot springs destination. There are several small towns around Kyoto, but probably the most commonly recommend is Hakone because it's conveniently on the Shinkansen route between Kyoto/Osaka and Tokyo. I wouldn't add any of these towns though; they are best enjoyed as an overnight stay and your itinerary is already plenty full.",

If this is your first time in Japan why not cut out some of those trips so you can actually slow down and enjoy the places you're actually going to be in? You might think that you can get from place to place quickly but walking and navigating and getting on the train really is going to eat up a ton of your trip. You should pick like 1-2 areas you want to go to per day and a couple of top choices in each place, instead of trying to speedrun the entire island",

Don't go to the zoo only to see the red pandas. It's a very nice zoo and worth seeing all of it. It's one of my favorites. \n\nYou will only need one day to do the Disney parks. They are not as big as the ones in the US. Do Disney Sea during the day and then switch to Disneyland after 6pm. They don't do park hopping tickets but they do discounted prices after 6. Disney Sea is more for teens and adults and so is busier in the evening. So you do that one during the day and switch to Disneyland in the evening when it's not as busy.\n\nDepending on how big an anime fan you are, your shopping budget can easily be blown on one figure. Akihabara is a big area with shops on every floor of all the buildings.\n\nHave fun!",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know the level of comfort you demand when you travel but the green pass for Jr feels totally unnecessary to me as someone who just spent 3 weeks here\u2026 the regular cars have easily twice the leg room of your flight, chairs are comfy, there\u2019s overhead racks (don\u2019t carry your suitcases, mail them) tables, power outlets etc\n\nDay 4 is definitely where you could do the Tokyo metro building, it is a 45 minute train from day 3 that you wanted to then take back for ameyoyokocho at night / not ideal, but it is a single stop away from golden Gai. Definitely don\u2019t skip GG either - it is not beer heavy. Honestly most places aren\u2019t. At the most barren selection there was usually beer/lemon sours/whisky highballs. The latter of two were both delicious. But most places especially in GG offer full bars. You\u2019ll be able to get whatever you like. Places are TINY but all incredibly unique and will make it very apparent they are friendly to travelers. It was one of the only places we made friends during our trip :)\n\nPersonally - skip philosophers path, as you\u2019ve got a tight schedule. Maybe it\u2019s a bit prettier in autumn (though I think Sept might be early for that?) / I know it\u2019s popular for the cherry blossoms, but it was a quite sad stretch that wasn\u2019t nearly as scenic as quite anywhere else in Kyoto in my opinion. I walked the whole length and constantly encountered other tourists saying \u201cmy maps says it\u2019s right here! Where is it\u201d because it was really just a little path alongside a not very impressive canal.\nOn that day, if you get up early enough, do Sagano romantic train / or stroll around by the river there in Sagano/Arashiyama if you want a much more dramatic and beautiful walk. Also closer to Kinkakuji but that\u2019s a relative term since it\u2019s still 30-45 minutes by bus.\n\nYou don\u2019t have Fushimi Inari on the list which is arguably the most popular attraction in Kyoto - and well worth it especially if you climb a decent ways up it where the people are not. Especially if you go to Arashiyama/Sagano the first day rather than Philosophers Path, fill this on Day 7.\n\nThe fish market is in Toyosu now. I have no interest in sushi so we didn\u2019t go but from what I understand it is a VERY early day to go there 5/6am. Tokyo tower observatory isn\u2019t worth it (you\u2019re in 1 of the most iconic buildings so it\u2019s missing from the landscape) but there is a very cool arcade there called Tokyo Red which had a bunch of different AR/VR using your whole body type games. \n\nI\u2019m safely assuming when you say Asakusa you mean to include Sensoji here. It is one of the most stunning temples we saw. It is also close to the sky tree and I thought the view there was incredibly worth the price + there\u2019s so much in sky tree town! \n\nHakone -is- doable as a day trip if you can\u2019t find accommodation. We stayed at Enblem Flow which is categorized as a hostel but has private rooms and hot springs. Overall I felt like I didn\u2019t need to stay there and I saw many people doing the loop in one day from Tokyo. If hot springs are what you\u2019re looking for, you can find them in Tokyo or nearby on other day trips. There\u2019s a hot spring resort in Chiba? I believe that looks like an old edo style festival // the name is escaping me right now. \nIf you combine the Disney days, perhaps a day trip to Yokohama is up your alley for the cup of noodle museum and the Giant gundam since you mentioned anime as an interest. It moves and it is IMPRESSIVE. The whole site is dedicated to robotics and filled with interesting information too. Yokohama was another city I found just so refreshing and lovely - waterside, vibrant China town, Redbrick district was very \u201chip\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t think your itinerary sounds too cramped. For the most part I utilized the advise here and cut / slowed down my itinerary when I went and definitely felt like I could\u2019ve done more some days. That being said I had 3 weeks so I had the privilege of a slower pace also. Only you know what your body can upkeep. Get good shoes, you\u2019ll walk a lot and there are WAY more stairs and inclines than I feel like I expected. That being said, most things you don\u2019t need to book more than a day in advance ( besides trains ) so giving yourself the flexibility to swap days or things around is a life saver if you find yourself sore or tired.\n\nJust be mindful of closing times for temples (4-5pm) late opening times for stores (most don\u2019t open till 11am / not very many breakfast places at all) and just in general how long it can take to get from one place to the next. You don\u2019t have any crazy travel in Tokyo really except the Tokyo metro building i mentioned above, but I always estimated 30 minutes to get most places when you factored walking, finding the train, catching the train, walking again. Apple Maps IS your friend, google was hit or miss on the android. Get an ESIM or a pocket Wi-Fi. Couldn\u2019t imagine doing this trip without access to maps/translate.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great meal that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be Michelin but IS a very unique experience, stop in Kobe after Himeji and have a Kobe beef dinner. Best steak I\u2019ve ever eaten. They took it in front of you as well. Also the city of Kobe was just so wonderful.\n\nSafe &amp; fun travels!",

I don\u2019t know how or where it\u2019s going to go. \nI initially was going to go during Sakura season but Covid happened and the country shut down, so if philosophers path is just meh then maybe I\u2019ll swap things around. \nI only put green pass because either way I\u2019m saving money if green isn\u2019t worth it then I\u2019ll save even more.",

Also, as you seem to be on a budget, consider if you really need a green pass - the 'normal' cars are perfectly nice and serviceable.\n\nDelete Osaka castle as it vastly pales in comparison to Himeji castle. In fact, unless you're super into the history of specific castles or collecting stamps of all 100, I would say that once you've seen one you've seen them all. \n\nI also think Philosophers Path is a waste of time in September especially since you are not doing anything else nearby (Kinkakuji is on the other side of Kyoto). \n\nIf you are interested in Fushimi Inari, go there on the Tokyo-Kyoto travel day (it's one stop on the local train from Kyoto station).",

    "postText": "After a couple months of lurking I think my partner and I (both 31) have a framework done! This will be our long awaited Honeymoon (married in the midst of COVID in 2020). We've been to Tokyo and Osaka in the past and we both agreed that our main priority is food, Gundam(myself) and maintain leisure.\n\nWith that in mind, here's the itinerary we have so far!\n\nNov 8 - land in Tokyo (we'll be flying in from HK, so jet lag won't be a problem),\n\n* Ship our big luggage to Sapporo Hotel\n* Thinking of either staying in a hotel close by the airport or somewhere easily accessible to the airport\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 9 - Fly from HND to CTS\n\n* Train to Sapporo\n* Rest/Spend the day roaming around Susukino area\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 10 - Sapporo (we are planning to get a hotel in the Susukino area)\n\n* Nijo Market\n* Tanukikoji\n* Odori Park\n* Shiroikoibito Park\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 11 - Day trip to Otaru\n\n* Open to any suggestions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 12 - Decision between spending 1 more day in Sapporo or heading to Noboribetsu for Onsen (We would activate our 14day JR pass when we go to Noboribetsu)\n\n* Ship big luggage to Hakodate (if we are not spending another day in Sapporo)\n* Would we have more things to explore in Sapporo? we're both not heavy drinkers but can enjoy one or two drinks a night\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 13 - Travel Noboribetsu for Onsen + explore Jigokundani (again this can be on Nov 12 instead) / Travel to Hakodate\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 14 - Travel to Hakodate (if we didn't stay an extra night in Sapporo, we would spend it in Hakodate instead)\n\n* Ship luggage to Tokyo\n* Mount Hakodate\n* Open to any other suggestions especially if we're spending another day here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 15 - Travel to Tokyo (staying in Shinjuku)\n\n* Trying to keep the day light, unsure how we will feel after the long train ride\n* Shibuya Sky\n* Parco\n* Omoide Yokocho\n* Kabukicho\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 16 - Tokyo\n\n* Ship luggage to Osaka\n* Team Labs\n* Odaiba\n* Not much else planned for this day, we'll be flying out from Haneda so we can wait on the souvenirs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 17 - Travel to Hakone\n\n* Hakone private onsen (open to suggestion, we look at a few but nothing eye catching yet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 18 - Fuji lake day trip\n\n* Originally we wanted to stay at a ryokan with private onsen + view of Mt Fuji but the prices don't seem to justify it (unless anyone has a good recommendation)\n* Hope to see Mt Fuji\n* Relax back at onsen in hakone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 19 - Travel to Osaka\n\n* We decided to make our base in Osaka because we plan on going Universal and instead of hotel hopping we'll just make day trips to Kyoto\n* Dotonburi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 20 - Universal Studios\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 21 - Kobe day trip\n\n* Himeji Castle in the morning\n* Kobe Harborland area\n* Looking for recommendations for Kobe Beef\n* Travel back to Osaka\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 22 - Kyoto day trip\n\n* Nishiki Market\n* Samurai &amp; Ninja Museum (worth it?)\n* Tamba Kameyama Castle Ruins\n* Kinkaku-ji (by the time we get here, it'll be later in the afternoon, would it still be crowded?) \n* Nijo-jo Castle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 23 - Nara + Kyoto day trip\n\n* Deer park\n* To-ji Temple\n* Toei Kyoto Studio Park (I know it's quite far, but I would like to see the Evangelion) \n* Keeping this open for other suggestions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 24 - Hiroshima/Miyajima day trip\n\n* Is it doable in 1 day assuming we head back to Osaka at night?\n* Ship luggage to Tokyo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 25 - Travel back to Tokyo\n\n* Cup Noodle Museum\n* Gundam Factory Yokohama\n* Maybe Chinatown to find food open for suggestions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 26 - Tokyo\n\n* Nakano Broadway\n* Mandarake\n* Ikebukuro\n* Don Quijote\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNov 27 - Last Minute Shopping\n\n* Flight at 9:00pm so we have some time in the morning to spend, nothing too crazy and may just end up going to the airport early and use the ANA lounge!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note we're not big nature people so too many temples may become boring to us. We decided we didn't want to go to Fushimi Inari and Arashiyama bamboo forest/Monkey Park because of time constraint.\n\nWe both enjoyed Osaka more than Tokyo in our previous trips, we've been to Disney and Universal before and decided we want to go Universal more.\n\nIt will be our first time in Sapporo, Kobe, Hiroshima and Kyoto. Please give more suggestions on those areas! \n\nAfter reading about the luggage transport service, we're ok with spending the extra $ on shipping it to the different cities rather than lugging them on the trains, we haven't booked our flight from HND to CTS yet so if that flight allows for 1 checked bag we don't have to send it the first night.\n\nLastly, this is our honeymoon so we want to try to keep the stress level of traveling to a minimum and not overpack the trip. A couple of days that are intense is ok as long as we don't feel like we're rushing to everywhere and rushing out.\n\nThank you for everyone's time in reading our post and your input + criticisms!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: added in some more thoughts as I'm browsing other's itinerary",

Also, for efficiency purposes and given the places you want to visit, I would rearrange the trip:\n\nConnect from TYO to HKD, do the day in Hakodate, then move to Sapporo. From there, fly from CTS to HIJ or at least ITM/KIX. Then work your way back to Tokyo by train.\n\nOtherwise, you are putting a lot of unnecessary and lengthy train travel into this itinerary. The total time taking trains from Sapporo to Hiroshima is 12+ hours. CTS to HIJ is 2 hours by plane, and then it takes about an hour to get to Hiroshima. You can easily cut out 8 transit hours by flying, and domestic flights are super cheap.",

We just thought going through the train route would be a nice experience, but your point is very valid in that we save a lot of time by flying. Will try to reconstruct the itinerary! \n\nI'm not sure if we'll make the connection, we arrive in HND at 7:20pm and the latest flight from HND to CTS is 9pm. Just wanted to play it safe and fly out the next morning.\n\nIs there anything in Hakodate that is worth staying an extra day? or spending a day there is enough?",

    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m visiting Japan for the first time with my girlfriend in November. I\u2019ve been lurking on this sub for a while to try and get some tips, and I\u2019ve started putting a very rough itinerary together. The days are interchangeable in theory, aside from the Tokyo/Kyoto split (5 nights based in each).\n\nI realise there are a couple sparse days at the moment, but I\u2019m trying to not over-plan every detail, leaving a bit of space for relaxing and spontaneous exploration.\n\nWith that in mind, let me know if there are any days that still look a bit busy, or if you have any recommendations that can be slotted amongst what I\u2019ve already got planned.\n\nDay 1: Tokyo\n\nNothing planned specifically as we\u2019ll have been travelling for nearly 24 hours. We\u2019ll land early afternoon, get to the hotel in Ginza to check in and get our bearings, have some dinner and a drink and try to get an early night\n\nDay 2: Tokyo\n\nExplore Ginza, Asakusa (Nakamise and Senso-Ji) and maybe take a trip up Tokyo Skytree\n\nDay 3: Day-trip to Fuji\n\nExplore the Fuji Five Lakes area - currently considering visiting Yamanaka, Kawaguchi, Oshino Hakkai Springs and Akakurayama Sengen Park\n    \nDay 4: Tokyo\n\nExplore Shibuya (Crossing, Yoyogi Park, Takeshita Street, Shibuya Sky) and Shinjuku (Gyoen National Garden, Golden Gai)\n\nDay 5: Day-trip to Kamakura\n\nVisit the Great Buddha and explore Kamakura, maybe take a trip to Enoshima. Very open to suggestions here. Also probably the day-trip that I would consider cancelling for an extra day exploring Tokyo\n\nDay 6: Travel to Kyoto\n\nHave a fairly relaxed morning and then travel to Kyoto, check in early afternoon and then explore\n\nDay 7: Day Trip to Nara\n\nVisit Todai-Ji, Nara Park and Mt Wakakusa\n\nDay 8: Kyoto\n\nTry to get to Fushimi Inari at a quiet-ish time. Thinking sunrise but sunset is also an option - open to guidance. Other than that I\u2019m open to suggestions but also happy to use this day to explore freely\n\nDay 9: Day Trip to Osaka\n\nThe original intention was to go to Universal, specifically for Nintendo World, but I\u2019m going off that idea as I don\u2019t like the thought of wasting time and money standing in queues all day. Leaning towards exploring Dotonbori, visiting Osaka Castle, and seeing what else we stumble across\n\nDay 10: Kyoto\n\nVisit Arashiyama and see the bamboo forest, Tenryu-Ji and Sagano Railway. Have a chilled afternoon/evening and an early night, as we\u2019re up early in the morning to get to KIX airport.\n\nOther bits and pieces I\u2019ve considered but not sure when/where we\u2019d slot them in:\nRoppongi Hills, Team Lab Planets, Kyoto Golden Pavilion, Kyoto Imperial Palace\n\nIn terms of travel arrangements, we were planning on making use of the JR Pass, although with the price increase I need to look into the best way to get where we want to be. Again, very open to suggestions.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for any help, suggestions and feedback you can give.",

            "comment": "On Fushimi Inari - if you want totally empty pictures and to see the sunrise/sunset by all means do so! But if you're worried about the crowds I would say that it really does get more quiet the further up you go - not everyone goes all the way to the top so the crowds really thin out the higher you go. We were there 2 weeks ago and were there from 10am-12pm and we easily got some pictures of the gates without people in them nearer the top.\n\nIf you do go really early or late then take head torches - there's no lighting on the path and I could imagine the steps might be quite treacherous in the dark if you're not careful. Sorry if you already know that!\n\nI think the rest of your itinerary looks very doable and I hope you have an amazing time!",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI found people's itineraries and trip reports really useful so I thought I'd share mine. I had a fantastic trip and wouldn't change much about it, but I've collated a few of the tips I'd learned on the way.\n\n**About me and the trip:**\n\nThis trip had been booked years ago and was postponed multiple times, so it was huge relief to finally make it. We had researched a lot before going, and had plotted lots of things on the map and made lists of places to go in each district and it does feel like we barely scratched the surface.\n\nWe (2 x 30s M) decided to only stay in Tokyo for the duration because we knew that we\u2019d be returning later in the year and wanted to have a reasonably relaxed time. The focus was seeing the cherry blossoms, and having the chance to take nice pictures, so the trip was heavily geared towards gardens and different viewing platforms. I am into fashion and design, so we incorporated that a lot too. Neither of us are particularly into anime/manga or theme parks, so we skipped stuff related to that other than getting some gifts for people. One thing I always do whenever I go somewhere new is visit a unique museum that you wouldn\u2019t find anywhere else in the world.\n\nWhile we did a lot of research, we didn\u2019t book anything in advance of the journey other than a day trip to Mt Fuji which we ended up cancelling and rebooking a few days before due to poor weather. \n\nWe\u2019re not big partiers or night owls, so we spent the daytimes doing stuff and would generally relax back at the hotel after dinner with a few drinks and snacks. \n\n**Day 0**\n\nA very early start, flying from London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda on British Airways. The flight was comfortable and food was tasty with plenty of booze, and we were able to see Mount Fuji beautifully from the window. We dozed on and off during the flight so weren\u2019t massively exhausted on arrival. \n\n**TIP**: We\u2019d downloaded Pasmo to our phones before arriving which was a total breeze. We also had eSims from Ubigi which activated within a few minutes after landing. \n\n**Day 1**\n\nIt took around an hour and a half to get through security. It was a mammoth walk to immigration from the flight and there were dozens and dozens of people directing people to do Visit Japan Web. Unfortunately there were few immigration officers but multiple flights arriving at the same time. We were more or less the first people off the flight, and shortly after our flight landed another one did so those people probably had to wait for hours. \n\nBags were already there when we got through customs, so we went straight to the train to the Mimaru Aparthotel in Asakusa. To be honest I\u2019d probably get a taxi next time because I\u2019d rather not deal with the luggage and it\u2019s nice to just zone out in a car from door to door.\n\nWe\u2019d booked an extra night in the hotel so that we could check in immediately. By the time we got to the hotel it was 1pm, so it was a little overkill in the end, but I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to wait around. \n\nUnfortunately the bedding with goose feather which isn\u2019t great on top of seasonal allergies, so the very first stop was to get some new pillows! \n\nThe rest of the day was spent walking around, having conbini snacks and a quick Mos Burger before an early night. I wasn't really a fan (so much sauce compared to burger) but it was good that they had veggie options. We had wanted to get some sushi at Kura but the one next to Skytree had a two hour wait. \n\n**TIP**: Check with your hotel in advance if they offer hypoallergenic bedding. I don\u2019t think this is as common in Japan, but can be purchased quite cheaply at stores like Nittori.\n\n**Day 2**\n\nWoke up around 5am, but just dozed a little and grabbed coffee from the conbini. We took a walk to Ueno Park which was pretty, though extremely busy. There was a one-way system which worked out well. We had lunch at Coco Ichibanya then walked down to Akihabara and took the subway to the Meiji Shrine. \n\nThe pillows we got the previous night were pretty thin so we got some others. For dinner we had some Kura Sushi (a different location with no wait). A few snacks and drinks from the conbini and we called it a night. Honestly this day felt like a bit of a blur due to the jet lag.\n\n**TIP**: Coco Ichibanya is a really easy place to cater for all tastes and dietary requirements, with the exception of some which are branded Coco World, which do not have the wide range.\n\n**Day 3**\n\nWe wanted to do some window shopping so we headed to Shibuya. The clouds happened to let up so we went to Shibuya Sky. It was really quiet which was great. Most shops don\u2019t open til 11 or 12 so we did a little walking before then. We had some delicious pastries in a bakery under one of the skyscrapers for lunch. \n\nThe area surrounding Hachiko statue was so crowded I couldn\u2019t actually see it!\n\nWe went to a bar, above the shopping centre Magnet, overlooking Shibuya Crossing. The entrance fee is a drink, which was pretty reasonably priced all things considered (around 800 yen). We visited some designer stores then headed back to Asakusa for dinner. We did Saizeriya because I was already craving cheese. It\u2019s *ridiculously* cheap. \n\n**TIP**: A lot of chain restaurants like Saizeriya have a list at the front where you have to sign your name and say how many people are in your party, then you sit down and wait until your name is called. I filled it out using Google Translate and there was no issue with communication.\n\n**Day 4**\n\nWe went to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. There were so many great colours. We saw a huge crane and an older lady ran towards us to say to make sure to get a picture because it was very rare! It was really sweet of her. Although it was peak blossom time most of the park was gloriously quiet.\n\nNear Yoyogi station there was a street with lots of little bars. We had lunch in a Thai-style izakaya which was really tasty. Then we headed to the Tokyo Metropolitan building, which was sadly closed that day last-minute. We headed back to Shinjuku instead to see the sights there. We walked up to the Korean district which was very vibrant. So many teenagers! We had a few Korean snacks and drinks then went back to the hotel. \n\nThen for dinner we had sushi in a small place in Asakusa. There were lots of locals getting merry and enjoying their sushi while listening to country music! Very delicious. Afterwards we had a tayaki in the street then got fortunes from the temple. Fortunately we didn\u2019t need to cast away any bad luck :) \n\n**Day 5**\n\nNext morning we had breakfast at a family restaurant which served with one of those cat robots. Food was fine and fairly cheap. For my unique museum pick I chose the Tobacco and Salt Museum. The salt part of the museum was actually really fun and interesting. The tobacco part was unsurprisingly pro-smoking which felt a bit weird but I don\u2019t know why I was surprised! \n\nWe did a little bit more exploring of Asakusa then had matcha ice cream at Suzukien (cash only). The maximum level 7 was great!\n\nFor dinner we went to the oldest onigiri restaurant, Onigiri Asakusa Yadoroku. My favourite was pickled ginger. \n\nAnother early night, jet lag was still affecting us.\n\n**TIP:** For very popular restaurants it's best to arrive before they open. At Yadoroku we were seated immediately but with just a few tables a line formed within minutes.\n\n**Day 6**\n\nWe took the ferry to Himarikyu Gardens. The gardens felt like an oasis of calm in the middle of the city. \n\nFrom there we walked to the Miyazaki clock but sadly just missed the performance. I was in the mood for curry again but unfortunately I discovered on sitting down that the Coco Ichibanya location at the NTV Tower was a \u201cCoco World\u201d which didn\u2019t have any of the normal curries. It looks fun for those who are adventurous but there were no vegetarian options and most contained nuts (which I avoid) and pork. \n\nWe had lunch at an Indian restaurant under NTV Tower that was unfortunately pretty bland and also didn\u2019t serve alcohol at lunch, which was a little embarrassing when we asked. \n\nWe went to the Ad Museum in Tokyo which was great. I was a little disappointed however at the selection in the gift shop though given how fantastic the collection was.\n\nWe walked to Akihabara where we had a beer at the Hitachino Brewing Lab. \n\nAfter a short break back at the hotel we headed out for dinner. It was a little humid that day and I was really excited to try cold soba so we found a place in Asakusa which had it on the menu. I hate to say it but I was so disappointed! I really like soba noodles but for some reason my mind just couldn\u2019t take to it. This day was probably the only culinary lowlight of the trip but it was just bad luck that I didn't enjoy either lunch or dinner.\n\n**TIP**: The Himarikyu Ferry must be prebooked online. However, we did it about half an hour before the first ferry and it was fine. The snack bar onboard is still closed.\n\n**Day 7**\n\nWe had a relaxed start to the morning with a conbini breakfast, and decided to do a bit more shopping so we headed to Ginza. One of the truly unexpected highlights of the trip were the gachopon machines. There were so many fun and interesting figures and ornaments to collect. I got lots of cool souvenirs from these. \n\nThat night we had tempura-don at a place in Asakusa. It was a little pricy but the portions were huge, and it was tasty. It was the only place we ate where we had to take our shoes off, so that was a novelty.  It was a little funny to see the waiters constantly changing in and out of shoes when entering/leaving the room.\n\n**TIP**: If you can\u2019t find the size you\u2019re looking for in a store, it\u2019s possible the staff can order it for you and it will arrive in a day or two. In my case I had tried on some clothes that were too big, and I was able to order them online to be sent to my hotel directly. Payment was a little tricky to get right but eventually Amex worked well on Japanese online stores.\n\n**TIP**: There\u2019s a cost-benefit decision about tax free shopping. At the Muji flagship for example, the line for tax refunds was huge, maybe 40-50 people for a couple of registers. If you\u2019re making a purchase on the lower end of the tax-free boundary, you\u2019d be saving only a few dollars and it might not be worth waiting for it. The larger department stores were very efficient about tax-free purchases.\n\n**Day 8**\n\nIt was a *very* rainy day, so we decided to do a museum. We picked the Tobu train museum. It was fun, but almost entirely filled with kids! It\u2019s a little old-fashioned but they had some cool exhibits like being able to see under trains as they passed by. Still torrential rain, we went to a nearby Kura Sushi for a relaxed lunch. \n\nThat evening I was craving cheese again so we found an Italian called La Casa Asakusa. It was absolutely tiny, but the food was incredible and made right in front of us. I\u2019d definitely recommend. The chef was so nice too.\n\nWe took a walk along the river for the evening and got some ice cream. \n\n**TIP**: The Taito Riverside, north of Asakusa, is somewhere you will see some camps of homeless people. We didn\u2019t feel at all unsafe there, but I can understand how a solo traveller or single woman might feel uneasy so you might want to avoid this area late at night.\n\n**Day 9**\n\nHeaded to Ginza and had breakfast in a cafe under one of the skyscrapers. \n\nWe walked to the Imperial Palace. Interestingly, the Imperial Palace grounds itself was pretty underwhelming compared to the many beautiful gardens we\u2019d already seen. The East Gardens were very nice though. We had some dango there.\n\nWe made attempt number 2 at the Tokyo Metropolitan viewing platform and although it was open (yay!) the line was huge (boo!) so we decided to skip it, since the weather was getting worse. Instead we headed to Roppongi to try the Mori Art Museum which I hadn't realised doesn't have a permanent collection, and the temporary exhibit they had didn't appeal to me, so we went to their viewing platform instead. The building is really quite strange and hard to navigate, and we had to have a staff member take us from the ticket area to the elevators which initially seemed like overkill but by the time we arrived I understood why. \n\nWe headed back to Asakusa and ate dinner at a Gonpachi which was tasty and had a really fun and lively atmosphere. \n\n**Day 10**\n\nWe planned on spending the day in Odaiba so took the train out there over the rainbow bridge. We saw the Gundam show, which was really impressive technically but a lot shorter than I anticipated (maybe 60 seconds?).\n\nFor lunch we had some okonomiyaki which was delicious. At the Fuji TV building there is a little stall with tayaki made in the shape of different cartoon characters. They were very tasty and cute, although I had never seen any of them before that day. We went to the viewing platform and saw a morning show being filmed. The Fuji TV tower itself is an interesting shape, but I\u2019d recommend skipping it. It\u2019s not interesting inside or a particularly good view so it\u2019s not worth the money.\n\nOverall, Odaiba was a disappointment. The malls are a bit old-fashioned and skew towards western brands or Japanese ones that can be found all over the city anyway. If you\u2019re going to Joypolis maybe it\u2019s worth it, but we\u2019re not into theme parks at all. Daiba 1-Chome was interesting enough to walk through, but uncomfortably busy (one of the busiest places out of anywhere we were in Tokyo) and a little worn-down (even accounting for its retro theme!). Maybe if you get there early it\u2019d be better but it was so crowded we just left after doing a loop. I\u2019d have liked to go to the Emerging Technology Museum but it was closed that day. I might go back to Odaiba for that museum and give it another try.\n\nThe weather cleared up on our way back from Odaiba so we decided last-second to go to Shibuya Sky. It was really quiet, probably because of the forecast rain and wind, so we got some excellent pictures. Dinner was some conveyor belt sushi.\n\nThat evening, we went to the Asahi building for a beer. There was a bit of a wait, maybe 10 minutes or so. It\u2019s surprisingly small. Self-service and cash-only, it\u2019s pretty tired but the service and atmosphere were nice. It\u2019s quite pricy for what it is though. \n\nOn the way back to the hotel we had a look around one of the department store basements.\n\n**TIP**: the bathroom on top of the Asahi building has a great view, and doesn\u2019t require visiting the bar or restaurant. It\u2019s actually kind of better than the bar itself because it\u2019s unobstructed. Not necessarily worth going out of your way for but if you\u2019re passing it\u2019s a good bathroom!\n\n**Day 11**\n\nAfter a lazy morning we went to Harajuku. Unfortunately since we got there later in the day it was incredibly busy, to the point of not really being able to see anything. To be honest I\u2019m not actually sure what there is to see! I\u2019d try again on another trip and time it better. We ate at a Korean place down one of the alleyways, but it took close to 2 hours to get the food which was unfortunate. \n\nWe took a look around some of the vintage stores, which were really cool though unsurprisingly lacked choice in western sizes. Second hand clothes in Japan aren't considerably cheaper than brand new, so don't expect bargains.\n\nWe headed to the Meguro Cherry Blossom walk which was an unexpected highlight. It was very busy, but a fun atmosphere with lots of little stalls selling snacks and drinks. It was the only place I saw Japanese people eating and drinking while walking! \n\nFor dinner we went to the top floor of a mall in Ebisu and ate at Mr Farmer. I\u2019d recommend their food, it was really tasty and had lots of veg options. \n\n**TIP**: there\u2019s a section of the Meguro walk that\u2019s north of the highway, and a little convoluted to walk to due to bridges being in the way, but it\u2019s *so* much quieter than the rest of the walkway and much more suited for taking nice pictures. The Starbucks Reserve at Meguro had a five HOUR wait for entry. I knew it\u2019d be packed so we avoided it but I have seen it on people\u2019s itineraries so be aware of that.\n\n**Day 12**\n\nWe had booked a driver for a trip to Mt Fuji a few days before but we were able to cancel for free because of the rain. We rebooked a few days in advance after seeing the weather was going to be better this day.\n\nOur first stop was the 4th Station (the 5th station was closed) but there was fog, so you couldn\u2019t see anything whatsoever. It was kind of funny to see thousands of people just standing around trying to take pictures of\u2026 nothing? One highlight was a Japanese woman who took pity on us and give us local candies, took our rubbish and guided us to a bench. The candy was delicious. \n\nThen we headed to Oishi Park, where the weather still hadn\u2019t quite cleared so we couldn\u2019t see Mt Fuji yet. Then we drove to Arakura Sengen Park which was a real workout with all of its steps.\n\nAfterwards we headed to Oshino Hakkai for some food. It felt like a tourist-trap so I\u2019d advise skipping it personally. \n\nThen we drove to Hakone and did the ropeway as far as the volcano. We would have stayed a little longer but already we\u2019d been on the move for about 9 hours and we were keen to get back to the city.\n\nAs we were driving back towards Tokyo, success! The clouds shifted and we got some spectacular views of Mt Fuji. Our driver kept veering off the road and slamming on the brakes so we could see it. The danger was worth it!\n\nThe traffic getting back to Tokyo was *horrendous* so it took 3 and half hours to get to the hotel. We\u2019d been snacking all day rather than having meals so we went to a nearby Saizeriya for some incredibly cheap and fast Italian food. People rag on it online but for what it costs you really can\u2019t complain. \n\n**Day 13**\n\nWe were still recovering from the very long day yesterday, so spent the morning and afternoon doing some souvenir shopping for friends and family. It was a little harder than I expected to find nice Japanese-themed stationery in the department stores. Much of it was really pretty and made in Japan, but often was covered in French or English writing or Disney characters. We did find some nice gifts across a few department stores. We also bought ourselves some clothes then got even more gachapon for ourselves and as gifts.\n\nWe also went to Kappabashi-dori and got lots of little silicone foods like sushi and tamago sandos as gifts. They are incredible craftsmanship! They are available as magnets, earrings and keychains.\n\nOnce again, the clouds lifted in the late afternoon and we decided to go to the SkyTree. We got some breathtaking views of Mount Fuji during sunset. We had a drink from the bar and admired the city as the lights of the city started to come on. It was a perfect way to end the trip. The gift shop was also surprisingly nice so we got some things there.\n\nFor dinner, we headed back to the same Gonpachi as last week because the food was really good. On the way we passed by the \u201cMario\u201d karts and it did not look like fun at all. It was loud, smelly and seemed really dangerous. I feel like it\u2019s only a matter of time before one of them ends up under a truck. \n\n**TIP**: even if you\u2019re going to Skytree last-minute, you can order your tickets online for the next time slot. We did it while walking to the SkyTree and didn\u2019t have much of a line at all. The line to buy tickets was probably at least 30 minutes, and afterwards you had another line of 10-15 minutes to take the elevators, so people who arrived without tickets probably missed the sunset.\n\n**Day 14**\n\nSince we ended up with a lot more luggage than we started with, we decided to take a taxi to the airport that morning. It was really comfortable and had huge windows so it was a pleasant way to end things. \n\nThe Japan Airlines First Class Lounge is stunning, so if you get the chance to visit I\u2019d definitely recommend it. We had bento boxes and assorted sushi for lunch, with some sake and champagne tasting. It was hard to leave!\n\nWe did visit the gift shop in the terminal and once again I was surprised at the excellent quality of the items there. Often airport gifts can be a bit sad but we got a bunch more great souvenirs from there. Allow plenty of time, because the checkout process takes a while for each passenger and even though there were many checkouts open, we were still queueing for about 20 minutes and boarding had already started while we were waiting.\n\nWe had a very pleasant flight home though we got home close to midnight local time, meaning that the day had lasted about 31 hours.\n\n**General things that surprised me**\n\n* Animal welfare is a lot less of a priority compared to other countries I\u2019ve visited or lived in. I had read about this before coming but it was still sad to see. Quite often I saw conditions of animals that were depressing (a grade school in a residential area had a turtle in a small plastic box outside; Don Quijote had a huge eel in a tiny tank; pet stores having cats and dogs in small cages). I see a lot of people planning to visit animal cafes like micro pig (FYI there\u2019s no such thing) or owls (they\u2019re nocturnal and forced to stay awake). I have heard of some conservation-focused attractions and rehoming cat cafes which would be better to support. \n* Japan is one giant tripping hazard! I have never seen so many people falling over, I'm not kidding. Changes in elevation almost always aren\u2019t clearly marked out so you really need to pay attention when you\u2019re walking, especially in places like Omotesando which are pretty hilly with lots of random little steps.\n* It was a little harder than I thought to find souvenirs that were \u201cvisibly\u201d Japanese. A lot of the fancy department stores had pretty things but they would often have English or French writing on them, or even Disney characters. I\u2019ve also never seen so much Peanuts merchandise in my life! The items were cute and high quality, but not my kind of thing.\n* Restaurants played music not at all related to the cuisine. Country music at a sushi restaurant, and SO MUCH JAZZ. I\u2019ve never heard so much freestyle jazz music in my life. \n* If you\u2019re over 5\u201910 you\u2019ll need to worry about banging your head on stuff. Similarly, although I really love Japanese fashion it was quite tricky to get things that fit. The current style has a lot of oversize stuff, but oversize on someone who is 5\u20195 looks very different to someone who is 6\u20192! We did find some good stuff in the end, and it was a lot of fun to browse.\n* Japanese online reviewers tend to be very honest and only rate something as 5 stars if it\u2019s incredible, so if you\u2019re looking at Google reviews and a restaurant has 3.4/5 it\u2019s still above average.\n* I don\u2019t have a sweet tooth by any means, but I was still surprised at how subtle dessert flavours were for the most part. While the savoury cuisine is extremely flavourful, the desserts are often really quite\u2026 bland? We had a matcha cookie dango which looked beautiful but didn\u2019t taste like anything. \n* As a tourist normally used to US city prices Tokyo is very reasonably priced, from museums to restaurants to grocery stores. You could easily do Tokyo on a shoestring budget and still get fantastic experiences.\n\n**What I\u2019d do differently**\n\n* I\u2019d probably bring an extra pair of shoes on top of the two pairs I brought just to give my feet a bit of respite.\n* We had wanted to do some experiences/classes/tours, but because we needed to leave our plans fairly free in order to do Mt Fuji during clear weather it meant we couldn\u2019t pull the trigger on anything. By the time we had firmed up our plans (during the trip) everything we had earmarked was sold out. \n* Similarly, there were a few restaurants that I would have liked to try but they booked out a few weeks in advance so I didn\u2019t get to try them. What I will say is that while some restaurants appeared not to have space when trying to book online, they would still take walk-ins so it\u2019s worth a shot.\n* A few hole-in-the-wall places we\u2019d tried to go to had sold out of their food by the time we got there, so if there was anywhere I really want to try I\u2019d try to go when it opened.\n* We made it the whole trip without having any ramen! I know that sounds surprising but it\u2019s neither of our favourite foods so we didn\u2019t prioritise it. I\u2019d had some of the veggie-friendly places saved, but whenever we were nearby they were packed and I was too hungry to want to wait. \n\nI had a fantastic time on the trip, and really much of my highlights I can't really get across via text because it was so exciting to just *be* there. Some of my favourite things were trying new snacks from the convenience stores, and walking around residential areas that looked so different to anything I'd ever seen before. I can't wait to go back.",

Food labelling in stores is great as well. I don\u2019t eat meat but I wasn\u2019t being extremely strict with things like fish stock, and it did help travelling with someone who did eat meat because I could order something where there was meat and put it on his plate. But in general it was less of a problem than I had anticipated. \n  \nConveyor sushi places are a great option because there\u2019s always a few veggie choices. Coco Ichibanya which I visited a few times has a vegan hamburger steak which was really tasty.",

One thing that I forgot to mention is that often restaurants require you to pre-select a prix fixe if you\u2019re reserving online, even if they have an a la carte menu. We didn\u2019t have to navigate that issue on the trip, but I\u2019d do a bit more research on that aspect. The website Pocket Concierge has come recommended. \n  \nAlso worth reiterating that some restaurants which appeared online as fully-booked for weeks had some space for walkins, so it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask!",

Just let them get through it, don\u2019t worry about it. \n  \nMenus are often very visual with pictures, so it\u2019s not rude to point at what you want. Google Translate is excellent for scanning menus, so if there weren\u2019t pictures or English menus we used that with no issues. It\u2019s also worth checking Google reviews because sometimes there people will make recommendations.",

I\u2019ll take this all on board when I hopefully go back some day.\nDid you happen to see at Yoyogi Park - people dressed up as a mixture of Elvis wearing very pointed cowboy boots? It\u2019s hard to explain but the dance their asses off and it\u2019s such a strange core memory for me that I still have a little laugh about now.\nJapan is just so much fun if you do it your way.

I found that Mastercards works better than Visas, so be on the lookout. I found that I\u2019m always on my phone looking at the direction at the train station, so having to just tap my Suica for the gate is so much better. Suica also works for bus rides too and I found it better than taking out my JR passes. Top up is also so easy. Works in Kyoto system (bus and train) too. \n* **Download Google Translate** and use the picture capability to take a picture and get it translated. Works about 90% of the time and I love it. \n* **Follow the line**, even better if it\u2019s mostly Japanese folks. Even if the restaurant doesn\u2019t advertise that they have an English menu, most likely than not they have an English menu inside. If they don\u2019t, use tip #2 to help you out. \n* Most places are not open until 10 or 11, so be ready to **get breakfast from conbini** (7-11, Lawson, Family mart) unless you are ok to eat at westernized places like Starbucks or Tully\u2019s coffee. \n* **Google map everywhere** \\- it will tell you which train line to take, which train stop, even all the way to which station exit is the closest to your destination\n* I\u2019m glad I did **eSim via Ubigi** rather than bringing in pocket wifi. My/my husband\u2019s day pack is already full day-to-day, adding pocket wifi plus having to charge it overnight would be another thing to think about. Ubigi works great at most places. T-Mobile also works great in most places. \n* Drink your choices of drinks, I know most foreigners would prefer the familiar beers like Asahi, Sapporo, or Kirin Ichiban. But the young and hip Japanese are drinking this mixed drink of **shochu + oolong/green tea**. Sochu is a Japanese liquor typically made from potatoes, much like sake is a rice wine. If you see Japanese people drinking a tall glass of colored drinks (like ice tea) this is what it\u2019s made of, some young Japanese folks told us that this is what they\u2019re drinking. \n* Buy your souvenirs and snacks at **Don Quijote -** we got extra luggage for all of our souvenirs here too LOL \n* Bring coin purse - this is very true \n* Be ready to have cash at hand since most places can only accept cash\n* I didn\u2019t exchange cash ever, I just took out cash at the ATM machine at the conbini. I have Schwab Checking Account \n* Instead of going to Tokyo Skytree or Shibuya Sky, we went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Observatory for free entrance. We went twice at night and in the morning, no queue at all, and again it\u2019s free!\n* Trench coat among the ladies seems to be more common than any jacket style \n* Bring the most comfy shoes! We averaged 20-25k steps per day, my feet are tired in the afternoon typically and that\u2019s when we rest at some of the cafes listed above\n* There\u2019s not enough days to eat everything that we\u2019re looking for - wish we had more days!!!",

I had to get an Iocoa card because I was in Kyoto for 5 days prior to heading to Tokyo and that is the IC card brand they sell in Kyoto. But keep in mind that advice about returning the card and getting your money back won\u2019t work if you end your trip in Tokyo. (From their website: \u201cThe refund can be made at the \"JR-WEST Ticket office\" reservation ticket offices, in JR-WEST stations. (Refunds are not possible at stations for companies other than JR-WEST or at bus offices.) \u201c) I assume the reverse is true about refunding a Tokyo-issued IC card in Kyoto/Osaka.",

Although the cards are branded differently, they can be used everywhere.  It's true about the refund, but the best thing to do is just not top it up so much and just keep adding as you need to. You can clear it out at the end if you want by going to a convenience store. Of course you won't get the \u00a5500 back, but I guess a lot of tourists keep the card as a souvenir. You can always bring it back to Japan next time",

I tend to use a lot of data. In 2 days we used up over 5 gigs of data with 2 phones and an ipad and all was good. On a recent trip to Australia T-Mobile's free roaming crapped out and buying the extended data didn't improve things. With the portable wifi here it has been seamless and cheap.\n\nI have heard but not experienced that temporary esims without a plan are more of a roaming quality and often throttled as such. My portable wifi is a native 4g signal 24/7 so perhaps that also explains my positive experience. We rented from  https://globaladvancedcomm.com/ and pickup was easy and the ssid and password are written on the device and on the welcome screen.\n\nAs of now I'd recommend it for data heavy needs.",

We did our day trips from Kyoto and then one from Tokyo on the day the pass was activated.

We are in Japan right now doing the typical tour and because we can use the JR Pass on other trains beside Shinkansen, it's very much worth it :) Like we are in Kyoto now, the Nara Line runs with JR and you can take it to Nara but also Fushimi Inari. We also used it to get to Arashiyama from Kyoto Station. If you happen to go to Miyajima near Hiroshima, that's  another JR trip with the shinkansen to Hiroshima and then the ferry.",

Why choose the one restaurant (by restaurant I mean tiny spaces that seat 15 people maybe) next to a shrine with 30 people in line who are only there because other tourists gave it five stars. Every Japanese person who comments on this subreddit says not to do this: that most restaurants are high quality\u2014that there is no reason to wait to have ramen at the one ramen place that people are standing in front of when there are 20 others with room within 100 feet. \n\nYour time is precious. Why wait? And why assume tourists know better. Just ask your concierge, almost all places near busy areas have menus in English or will have a sign in English. \n\nAnother hot tip: it pays to go to the basement floors of department stores. They have 100s of food vendors all in one place. And you\u2019ll notice the same brands of desserts/confections/matcha purveyors (like a lot of the ones mentioned by op) are all in the same location! And hot and cold food and menus in English that will be handed to you. The options are unreal. You can take your food outside and have a picnic. \n\nThis is my opinion.",

Sometimes the cashier and tax-refund queues are separate and you will have to queue twice. Could depend on which outlet you go to. In the Shibuya and Ginza branch, it was always crowded! In one store in Nagoya, we had the place all to ourselves. \n\nPrice-wise, they are not always the best. I feel they used to be, years ago, but that seems to have changed since then but they are still attracting based on the discount image they have. Cannot speak for all products so here\u2019s a couple of examples. (1) 10 boxes of pocky at 1680 yen. It was 158 per box at a local supermarket. (2) A pack of Furikake advertised to be a great price! 200 yen. At the supermarket it was 210 for double the gram amount. But the packets looked exactly the same so it was easy to overlook. Not big amounts in the grand scheme of things, for sure, but overpaying plus overqueueing, I would just make one trip for the experience and shop elsewhere.",

Gave me the ick a little bit, so we went back after sunrise at Fushimi and it was bliss! 100% recommend people make the most of mornings here before the crowds arrive. Likewise with Chureito pagoda I got there at 5am and there was no queue for the observation deck (although packed with other photographers already) - saw someone say the queue was 1h + during the day. Also found Hakone a bit underwhelming compared to Fujiyoshida and Kawaguchiko. There\u2019s the floating torii gate but that\u2019s a \u201cqueue to take a photo\u201d affair. Luckily we had visibility of Fuji for 3 days straight!",

For reference, today is Thursday. \n\nWe arrived around 6:30am, and the markets were open, the food stalls were just barely beginning to open. Turns out it was perfect because we got into a chirashi-don place right away. Had a fantastic meal with no wait. \n\nAfter our meal, we walked around and things started to open up. It was fun walking around because every time we did a circle, a new place opened and we got to try them as they opened without wait. \n\nBy 7:15, lots of vendors were open and lines were beginning to form. \n\nBy 7:45, I would say most of the vendors were open (maybe 90%) and the lines got much longer. The stall vendor lines moved quick. I can\u2019t vouch for sit-down sushi places since we already had our meals, but the lines seemed long. \n\nWe left at 8:00, it was already starting to get crowded and most vendors would be open by 8 or 8:30. \n\nAll in all, it was more expensive than finding the dishes in other places. But everything we ate was fantastic, and it was great that it was all in one place and you can hop from stall to stall to try everything. I\u2019d say the surcharge is definitely for that convenience.\n\nI would definitely recommend coming at this time if you can do it (jet lag helps here since we\u2019re from North America). We got to try everything we wanted with very very little wait, and we weren\u2019t fighting through throngs of people to walk.",

I have tattoos on the back of my legs so I imagine it\u2019s probably best to walk around with them covered if possible? \n\nAlso, did you find any restaurants that turned you away due to being locals only? I\u2019m always so worried about that. \n\nWe\u2019ll be going to Japan for the first time in sept so I\u2019m super excited!",

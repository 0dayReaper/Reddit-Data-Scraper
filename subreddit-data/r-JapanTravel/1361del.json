If you can, I suggest you arrive at Takachiho Gorge earlier, parking spaces will fill up and you will have to spend a longer time walking down to the gorge from the furthest parking area.",

When I go it should be a non holiday weekday so hopefully I will check out the closest car park first then check the other two if it's full\n\nThanks again!",

Make sure you eat Nagashi Somen right beside the gorge, it's the restaurant where it was invented and it's good fun.  \n\nMake sure you reserve boats ahead of time and pray the water levels aren't too high on the day you go, some days rentals are cancelled because of it.",

    "postText": "This applies if you are planning to go to USJ about 45-60 days prior and planning to buy USJ Express pass. I also see many posts indicating they're unable to buy Express pass as it ran out even weeks before. \n\nI am posting this just as an act of giving back since most pages out there and Youtube tips refer you to book via Klook or USJ English page. These avenues will set you up to fail, let me explain why. \n\nKlook: Buying USJ via Klook randomize your time of entry. You may get lucky and get reasonably good pace/time, but law of probability works against you. Imagine scenario where you enter SMW one hour before park closure, or that you only have 2 hours in SMW before rushing to Harry Potter in afternoon, etc. Spending  $150pp, do you want to gamble your chance? Me don't think so. \n\nUSJ English Page: If you select English language to buy tickets, you will be automatically redirected to an external official agency that sells the ticket. For some reason, the availability for Express pass in this page is extremely poor. Availability 2 months out constantly marked as out of stock. This becomes source of confusion for manu Redditors. They are booking it so early yet no stock? I simply think that they just don't sync their inventory often enough with USJ Japanese page\n\nOk, now we have those two avenues out of the way - what is the best way to book USJ Express Pass? Yep, you guessed it, USJ Japanese Website. https://www.usj.co.jp/web/ja/jp\n\nHere are some tips to have a successful USJ Japanese Website experience: \n\nBefore booking tips:\n\n1. Register in advance USJ Club member (see the top page to register). You have to convert your name to Katakana / Hiragana. Just use Google translate or other name conversion website. \n\n2. Book as soon as inventory is released. Tickets seem to be currently released in batches 2.5 in advance. Currently up to July 31 is available. These tickets are booked very quickly - especially the preferred time slots. Booking in the morning EST (say 8AM) will get you fresh inventory (for any new release).\n\n3. Search for the Express Pass you want to book. I don't need to list the options as you can see them on website.\n\n Pro tip: Some attractions that you want to ride (eg Spiderman, Jujutsu Kaisen) may not have that bad of a wait time to justify Express Pass (1 hour or less typically) . Some rides like Doraemon, Mario Kart, Yoshi Adventure, Hollywood dream roller coaster absolutely require Express Pass (1-2 hour wait). So even say you want to see Spiderman, but may  want to ride Doraemon, you may want to get Doraemon instead. Data on ride wait times: https://www.thrill-data.com/waits/park/unit/usj/ \n\n4. Pick your time slot: USJ released all the possible combination of Express Pass entry time via table. You can look this up within the Express Pass page within the type you want. Each combination is marked with a number (1) to (120). Checking this table is crucial because when you book your Express pass, it only gives you schedule for Mario World and Harry Potter area entry, and you won't see the entrance time for the other rides timed entry (Doraemon, Spiderman, etc). You can pick say generally time you want to pick before booking. \n\nPro tip: When selecting your time slot. Understand which button to click after you translate to English and restore page back to Japanese. If the page is in English translation, the time slot simply will not appear.. This is the only page which translation doesn't work. \n\nPro Tip: Other than rides, consider other events you want to attend in the park. There is NO LIMIT parade that runs during the day. Unfortunately, this may be difficult to accommodate depending on your priority. Personally, I have to miss this to prioritize AM in Super Mario World. \n\n5. Delivery Method and Paying: Always pick QR code. I was not able to to pay via my Visa, but my Amex seems to work. Heard apple pay works too if you use iPhone (does not get triggered using iPad). \n\n6. Final tip: Arriving at the park early is a well known tips (1.5 hour before opening). This allows you to get to SMW early to do the mini challenges and toad cafe (no express pass for those!), so after youre done Mario Kart (say by 11-12PM), you are ready to explore other part of the parks. \n\nGood luck! Feel free to ask me any questions you may have.",

            "comment": "Just to throw in my 2 cents. I was at USJ yesterday (a weekday). The wife and I had purchased regular day passes through Klook.\n\nWe got to the park at about 7:15AM. There were already people waiting ahead of us but we were still early enough that we had a good spot in line. At about 8:30AM the staff came out to let in the people who had early access (they were waiting in a roped off area). At 8:45AM they opened the gates for us normal people.\n\nOnce we got in, we noticed everyone started running/jogging towards SNW. We did the same and we got in without any issues (no special tickets or anything needed). We stayed there until about 1PM.\n\nSomething to note - USJ offers \u201ctimed entry\u201d tickets to get in to SNW which you can get through the USJ app AFTER you have scanned your park entry ticket and entered the park. We tried to do that once we got in because we thought that was the only way to get to SNW. But it turns out if you get to the park early, you can just go to SNW immediately without any special ticket. The \u201ctimed entry\u201d tickets weren\u2019t even an available option in the app.\n\nI did notice that the \u201ctimed entry\u201d tickets kicked in later that morning (maybe around 10-11AM). Which means if you were not in SNW by then, you would have to register for one of those tickets and can only get into SNW at the time specified on the ticket.",

Question: do you think you need to be there in this case that eaely 715AM to make it to SMW, or say if youre there 830AM, you would still be OK?",

It\u2019s about a 5-7 minute walk from the park entry gates to SNW and the timed ticket entry didn\u2019t seem to kick in until 10-11AM.\n\nFor us, the way we looked at it was that we would rather sacrifice a little time on the front end (e.g. show up at 7:15AM and sit around) to greatly increase our chances of getting into SNW early in the morning without issues. And that\u2019s exactly what happened so we are happy with the result.",

We waited in line for maybe 30 minutes and then it was our turn to go up to the counter and order food. When you are finished ordering, they hand you a number and you walk towards the cafeteria and take a seat at a table. You put your number down on the table and maybe 10 minutes later our food came out. We finished eating and we noticed when we left the cafe that they started doing the \u201creturn at a certain time\u201d thing for the line outside.\n\nWe did the minimum number of minigames to get the 3 keys to fight the final boss (requires the interactive wristband that you buy in SNW). We also walked around and punched a lot of blocks and took pictures with Peach.\n\nWe also rode the Mario Kart ride right after getting into the park (before Toads cafe) and the wait was only 20 minutes or so.",

    "postText": "Has anyone tried these? Are they worth it? I found a caf\u00e9 that looks super cute and has the option to infuse your foods with CBD. I normally smoke medically prescribed cannabis but for obvious reasons will not be able to on my trip. When I went to Spain, I did not have access to this either so I visited a CBD store and the CBD helped open up my appetite a little due to the withdrawals. My plan is to just switch to CBD while I am in Tokyo. :)",

But I found that my appetite was not affected and I had zero withdrawal effects. Probably because I was walking so much all the time. So I ended up skipping on the CBD. But the vegan CBD cafes did look cute so I think these will work if you need.",

While they definitely help take the edge off the CCJ in Osaka gets you high. We tried chillaxy in harajuku (Tokyo) and lulus cbd in kyotot",

If you're also thinking of additional meals or things in Nagoya, Atsuta Jingu (which apparently has one of Japan's sacred items - susano-o's sword) is a good visit. It has a lot if mature trees and roosters walking about. You can also get a bowl of kishimen. I also enjoyed Nagoya's miso katsu at Yabaton. Uiro is also a fun wagashi to bring back home to share.",

They also have Capybaras now\n- Try a Wagyu buffet. They\u2019re very reasonably priced and delicious. We ate so much, we got tired of Wagyu\n- Try a tonkatsu restaurant. Pork cutlets in Japan are so good! Way juicer and tastier than what we get in the West. They also have special pigs that they use\n\nKyoto:\n- Suggest walking through the Geisha district (Gion) at night. Very cool experience and you can wander the small alleys. It\u2019s also very safe at night",

My advice is to get there earlier in the day when the Shiba\u2019s aren\u2019t tired yet.\n\nFor Wagyu buffet: I liked Rokkasen or their extension, Rokkasen annex in Shinjuku. Just so you know, eating Wagyu (which is high in fat content) will get you fuller faster!",

We decided that leaving the race and heading to Osaka was the way to pick up an extra day on the trip. Figure I'll just have my luggage sent from Nagoya to Osaka while were at the track on Sunday.",

    "postText": "We are traveling later this month May 2023. I wish I had gotten around to getting our itinerary checked earlier but here we are. I\u2019ve already booked anything that requires a ticketed entrance. I also reserved train and bus tour seats, but those can be modified. It will be our first time visiting Japan. I\u2019m into Japanese fashion and am looking for a way to squeeze in time to shop at Kapital, Ichi Antiquites, Beams, Issey Miyake, and any thrift shops. My mom likes art and nature. My husband likes knives, woodworking, and watches. And my son is into Pokemon, Ghibli, cute stuff, and all types of noodles, not limited to ramen, soba, and udon. My husband's been too busy with work and my mom isn't into travel planning so this itinerary was left up to me. I tried structuring the itinerary with main goals for the day and added options that can be nixed if we aren\u2019t feeling up to it or run out of time. Can someone review my itinerary? I would appreciate any feedback and am happy to take all the help and advice that I can get.\n\n# Sunday, May 28 (Traveling Day)\n\n* Depart from home!\n* Travelers: 3 adults (my mom, a spry 68 yo that walks 3-5 miles a day; my husband, a very fit 41 yo that exercises daily; and me, the weakest link of the party, 41 yo corporate worker that sits at a desk working 8-10 hour days &amp; bringing lots of Advil and Tylenol to get through this trip), plus 1 child (an active 10 yo that plays multiple sports)\n* Is $250 USD enough for emergency cash for the family?\n* We have a Google Fi plan so does it make sense to skip a pocket Wi-Fi?\n* We will try to pack as lightly as we can. Each person will have one carry-on luggage and a daypack. We are also bringing rain jackets and waterproof shoes to prepare for the monsoon weather.\n* Notes about meals and snacks\n   * Most of our lodging reservations include prepaid breakfast\n   * I have myriad restaurants bookmarked in Google Maps. We are flexible on meals. Open to trying the bookmarked destinations but not willing to queue up for more than 30 minutes for a meal so we will most likely take the gamble and explore random mom-and-pop shops if there\u2019s no long wait\n   * Lunch will be around 11:00 but again, if we\u2019re on the go or in a rush, we will pick up something quick at a combi shop, and will bring Soylent and other snacks as a backup\n   * Dinners will be early if possible, around 17:00\n\n# Monday, May 29 (Tokyo)\n\n* 18:00 - Arrive at NRT\n* Find an ATM at the airport &amp; withdraw JPY (prefer to use Schwab debit card and also bring Chase and BofA debit cards)\n* Purchase Suica cards\n* Take train to hotel (Keisei line: NRT terminal 2 to Asakusa station)\n* Asakusa Tobu Hotel 5/29-6/1\n\n# Tuesday, May 30 (Tokyo)\n\n* Walk by Kaminarimon Gate\n* 8:00 - Pick up 14-day JR passes at Ueno station (JR East Travel Service Center)\n* 9:30 - Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum (grandma wants to see the special Matisse exhibition and we have pre-paid tickets)\n* Optional \u2013 if grandma wants to stay at the Matisse exhibit, the family will split up and wander Ueno Park or check out the National Museum of Nature and Science\n* Explore Asakusa. Attraction goals: Nakamise Shopping Street, Asakusa Culture Tourist Info Center, Sumida River, Senso-ji, Asakusa-jinja Shrine\n* Optional \u2013 if we\u2019re all feeling up to it, we will visit Skytree, Tokyo Solamachi, or maybe the Sumida Aquarium; or we\u2019ll just call it a night after visiting Asakusa\n\n# Wednesday, May 31 (DisneySea)\n\n* DisneySea\n* Aim to get to the park around 8:00; queue up until the park opens at 9:00\n* We will purchase Premier Passes (any tips on how best to utilize the passes?)\n* Open to suggestions for attractions, sequence of rides, or snacks to try?\n* Departure time is open-ended. We will leave at any time at everybody\u2019s convenience. Potentially could leave after lunch or stay through the evening if we\u2019re into the park.\n\n# Thursday, June 1 (Yokohama) - Start of 14-Day JR Pass\n\n* 8:30 - Train: Tokyo to Shin-Yokohama (seats reserved)\n* Store luggage at Shin-Yokohama \n* Continue to day trip to Yokohama\n* Goals: Cup Noodle Museum, Gundam Factory\n* Optional - Chinatown, Minato Mirai, Red Brick Warehouse\n* 17:50 - Train: Shin-Yokohama to Kyoto (seats reserved)\n* Ala Hotel Kyoto 6/1-6/5\n\n# Friday, June 2 (Kyoto)\n\n* Goal: Fushimi Inari Taisha (will walk the entire trail loop if grandma requests it)\n* Optional: Tofukuji Temple, Nishiki Market, Nijo Castle\n\n# Saturday, June 3 (Kyoto)\n\n* Should we take public transportation or a taxi this morning?\n* Early morning goals: Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, Okochi Sanso Garden, Tenryu-ji Temple\n* Option 1: Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple, Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple\n* Option 2: Arashiyama Monkey Park (if we\u2019re up for that additional hike)\n* Afternoon or early evening goal: Gion Corner\n\n# Sunday, June 4 (Kyoto)\n\n* Early morning goal: Kinkaku-ji\n* Optional: Philosopher\u2019s Path, Higashiyama Jisho-ji, Kiyomizu-dera, Higashiyama Ward\n\n# Monday, June 5 (Kyoto)\n\n* 10:43 Trains (Kyoto to Kii-Tanabe) (seats reserved)\n* Stop by Tanabe Tourist Info Center and verify plans for Kumano Kodo Trek \u2013 Highlight Walks \u2013 4 days | Nakahechi, Hongu, Boat &amp;

            "comment": "250 usd for emergency cash is not a lot. A lot of places exclusively only use cash. Try something around 1000usd (around 100K yen) and divide it for 3 people (so around 30K yen each).\n\n68 y.o in japan can be very tough, if she feel tired, look for cafe / park / any bench / chair to sit.\n\nMay 29: you can get your jr pass in the airport if you want. It is a short walk\n\n*I suggest buying the tokyo skyliner ticket to reach asakusa as it is faster than narita express.\n\nMay 31: download tokyo disney app in playstore. It will show you waiting time and buying premier pass. No need to buy the pass unless it is very crowded. \n\n*When you enter the park, use your app to scan all of the tickets to get into lottery for big band beat, it is broadway style show and very cute + you sit.\n\nWhat people do usually go counter clock wise to soaring. But I am against it as sometimes soaring can be less crowded (less than 40 mins) if you wait until afternoon (if not then just buy premier pass).\n\nSnacks to try? Popcorn: Curry, milk chocolate, blackpepper, soy and butter, garlic shrimp, matcha white choco, and berry cheesecake.\n\nIf you  wanna see more: https://matcha-jp.com/en/5968\n\nI prefer going clock wise. If you like gondola, then gondola first. Then tower of terror (not recommended for the grandma and kids), aquatopia, nemo searider (kids love this). \n\nJourney to the center of the earth (not for grandma and kids), 20,000 leagues under the sea (my fav ride, and usually don't need to wait too, it is dark and a bit scary though), Ariel playground (for kids, very cute), if you can get triton concert, even better.\n\nThen to sinbad story book, alladin lamp theater, and lastly soaring (after that, wait for night time show). I skipped both indiana jones and raging spirits as it is rougher ride than not suitable for grandma and kids.\n\nJune 2: you need to take extra caution esp for the grandma and the kid. It is a very long walk (5 or so hours) with no turning back. Looking at your itinerary, just be careful when you are in kyoto in general, hold back your expectation and less walking, you still need to walk for another 2 weeks.\n\nJune 3-11: try to do less hiking / walking and expect some changes along the way.",

But I have seen way too many kids went into roller coaster or scary rides and came out crying lol.\n\n68 is definitely too old for roller coaster or a drop like tower of terror. Their bones are not as strong as before and if something goes wrong (such cracked bones, or popped hips / shoulder), their whole trip might be in jeopardy",

I\u2019m not too worried about the walking for her bc she regularly does 12-15 mile hikes in the mountains on the weekends. She walks like a champ. But I would not want to risk a heart attack or bone injury.

The other option is narita express. \n\nThey have different tracks and different companies managing it. \n\nNarita express is by JR. and you can use JR pass if you activate it during the same day that you arrive. but, since you will not activate it straight away, no need to force yourself to use narita express.\n\nTokyo skyliner last train actually leave much later than narita express (around 9.45 I think), so you can take your time in the airport if needed.\n\n\nI am not sure about google fi, but if you need internet, I recommend sim card. I bought sim card which is very cheap. For 30 days it will be 5K yen (50usd) per person (3 person means 15K yen). 1 pocket wifi costs 15K yen for 21 days, so it is about the same. But sim card is more reliable since you can split off and still ahve internet\n\n*You need your phone unlocked though, if not unlocked (locked to one provider), you cannot use it",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nFirst, I am on Google Fi as well and I have used it as is for 6 trips to Japan including one in December 2022.  We don't do Pocket WiFi, just Google, but we also only have 1 cell phone between us because my tween doesn't have one.  \n\nFor Disney Sea, you want to download the Disney app ahead of time on your phone and set up your account and make sure all members of your party are linked to your account.  That way when you enter the park, you can scan in everyone's tickets and can then book Premier Passes.  If you already have a Disney account, it will use the same username and password as your US account.  (I don't know if this holds true for Europe or China.)\n\nYou can also play with the app and see how long lines tend to be before you go.  I like to check it on a semi regular basis. lol\n\nThe two most popular rides at Sea are Soaring and Toy Story Mania.  My tween doesn't like free falls so usually skips Tower of Terror.  She has been on it before.  I think now that she is older she might enjoy it more (that and overall the Tower of Terror at Sea is wimpier than the ones in Florida and CA.  (and yes, I know the CA one is now Mission Breakout, it's still more intense than Sea's Tower of Terror.  I think Florida has the most intense Tower of Terror of the 3 parks.))  My tween loves Journey.  She started going on it as soon as she made the height line and it is her favorite ride in the park. \n\nOur first trip was a rainy visit and the park was dead.  It was great.  The negative is it canceled some of the parades and water shows, and the Japanese do an amazing jobs with parades and do a much better job of making sure lots of people can see the parade!  \n\nWe usually do a dinning reservation for the Italian restaurant, but we have dietary restrictions and the Japanese parks are not in the league of the US parks for dietary issues.  \n\nMickey ears are surprisingly cheaper in Sea than in the US.  We bought some pretty sparkly ones for 1800 yen which we plan to use next time we go to CA as well.\n\nKyoto has a really nice Pokemon Center, since you mentioned your child likes Pokemon.  My tween likes the Kyoto, Shinsaibashi and Umeda branches better than the ones in Tokyo.  I'm not a Pokemon expert so I will trust her judgement.\n\nMy tween didn't enjoy but I really enjoyed the Ninja temple in Kanazawa.\n\nMy tween really liked Hida no Sato and I have to say I enjoyed Hida no Sato more than Shirakawa Go.  I've not been but someone from Australia on Japan Guide loves the squirrel park in Takayama.\n\nMy tween did not like TeamLab at all, outside of the ramen shop.  (We went in December) she said that some of the rooms made her nauseous with the spinning projections (she does fine on actual rides that spin you around and loves those, like the teacups.)  I think the quick sand room is really hard to navigate unless you are young or very light.  It was my least favorite room.  My tween does like some modern style art, we did the Matsumoto Art Museum and a Yayoi Kusama special exhibit in the NY Botanical Gardens.\n\nI think the cookies are better than the cream puffs at Shirohige's but the cookies are so good!\n\nLast time we went to the Ghibli Museum it was disappointing.  (I've been 2x, tween has been once)  Make sure you manage expectations.  Our more recent trip it was very crowded and very loud.  Since there is only one cafe to get food and if you leave you can't re-enter, it gets very long lines very quickly (ignoring the fact there are like no options for people with dietary restrictions, I just always see the long line of people waiting to eat.)  There are lots of Ghibli shops outside of the one in the museum and the merch is completely different.  Depending on what you are interested in, the shops might have more of what you want.  The one in Skytree is better than some of the others in Tokyo and I want to say it is more elaborate since it's a small stand alone building. \n\nGood luck, it sounds like a great trip!",

                    "comment": "Hello! I really like that you shared the perspective of your tween. Love that she gave lots of feedback. I will look into those other Pokemon locations. My 10 yo is entering the tween zone so he says he's not too interested in the Pokemon cafe lunch but he does want to check out as many Pokemon stores as he can.\n\nI think he will very much enjoy your unique suggestions for the Ninja Temple and especially the squirrel park. \n\nYour comments about the sand room at TeamLab are interesting. I think I read somewhere else about someone with knee problems going there. It sounded like she got stuck in the sand and it was excruciatingly painful for her to navigate her way out of there. What a nightmare!\n\nAlso heard about the crowds at Ghibli and that's why I chose tickets for the opening slot. Hoping it won't be that bad! My hope was to try to go to Skytree the day after we land but I don't know if we will be too tired to make it that far. If we do, I did want to check out the Ghibli store.\n\nFinally - I was glad to see that your tween appreciates Yayoi Kusama. I booked that museum more for my mom and me. I'm hoping that my husband and our son will appreciate it as well!",

We've been a few times to the Tokyo branch and once to the Osaka branch.  I am glad she doesn't want to go again. lol  We are trying to do the limited time Oh My Disney Cafe, (which looks like it has legit vegan options!)  she is hoping we can get a July reservation for the Kirby Cafe (we went in January) and I need to make a reservation for the fancy limited edition Pokemon tea.  The tea is considerably more expensive than the Cafe but I am hoping the food is better.  We did a fancy Christmas themed tea buffet at the Ritz in Osaka in December and it was just so good.  The dessert were amazing.  She really enjoyed that so now I am always looking for more of those.\n\nI want to say we had a 10ish time when we went in 2018?  (or did we go 2017 lol  I went pre-kid when it first opened.) Just be careful, I thought we had more than enough time to take the shuttle bus from Mitaka, but there was a long line for it with lots of people going to the museum and several people with enormous suitcases.\n\nI'm just middle aged and fat, and that was enough for me to not enjoy that quick sand room.  Team Lab is really a mixed bag.  There are definitely people who love it but others who just don't.  I would do it again if there were new rooms, but I know my tween would balk.\n\nYeah, I definitely think your son can enjoy the museum.  I've thought about taking her, but I am unsure how much of it is things we haven't already experienced.  \n\nIf you have a little time in Tanabe, I really liked Tenjinzaki Park.  My friend use to live in Tanabe.  I've not done the Kumano Kodo, but I spent a lot of time in Tanabe itself (pre-kid.)",

I\u2019ll put the main rides in order of the longest waits to the shortest for you: \n1. Soarin\u2019. It\u2019s the newest attraction and people love it. It has, apparently, a great queue and a different ending than the US versions. I don\u2019t go on it because it makes me nauseous. \n2. Toy Story. Super long waits and it\u2019s a clone of the US attraction. The facade is really cool and worth seeing \n3. Journey to the center of the earth. Definitely a must do!! I usually try to go on it twice (during the day and at night) \n4. Tower of terror. Different theming but less thrills than all of the other versions. Still worth it. \n5. Finding Nemo. Cute simulator! \n6. Indiana Jones (you can do single rider). Just better upkeep and slightly different than California \n7. 20,000 leagues under the sea. Usually a 10 minute wait or no wait \n8. Sindbad. MUST do. It\u2019s always a walk on and it\u2019s so cool with a super catchy song by Alan Menken.\n\nFor snacks I\u2019d do the sea salt monaka found in the under the sea area and definitely the 40th anniversary Mickey bun. \n\nIf you get there at 8:00 there will be a ginormous line. Usually they let people in between 8:00-8:30, so if you really want to rope drop you should be there no later than 7:30. A lot of people go even earlier.",

I\u2019ll show up earlier if I can!\n\nI\u2019m going to try to prioritize Soarin\u2019, Journey to the Center of the Earth, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Sinbad (in any particular order that is clockwise). I\u2019m from SoCal and am familiar with Indiana Jones and Toy Story at D Land and Cal Adventure so I might pass. I\u2019m also curious about Big Band Beat.\n\nI think I also read that drinks at Magellan\u2019s and Teddy Rosevelt\u2019s Lounge are good. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve missed the chance to make reservations for either. \n\nHave you been checking the forecast? It might be a rainy day on our day! I think this could be positive in terms of crowd control. In SoCal, the theme parks tend to be less busy on rainy days. I hope that\u2019s how it is in Japan! We will be prepared with our rain gear!",

The others you can totally do anytime. They\u2019ll be a low wait all day!\n\nBig band beat is so fun!! Definitely go see it if you can. \n\nFor the teddy Roosevelt lounge you should be able to try for a reservation the day of at 9:00am (I would double check the time\u2026 can\u2019t remember if it\u2019s 9 or 7), but I\u2019m not sure about Magellans. \n\nOoh I haven\u2019t been but that\u2019s great!

First, it was heavily discounted when I booked and also I liked the proximity to the train station because the last thing I want is family members complaining about the walk back to the hotel after a long day. That being said, that part of town, is not fun for nightlife. Since I will be traveling with the family, we always wake up early and go to bed early. E.g., my son wakes up at 6:00 every morning without an alarm clock and my mother eats dinner (!) at 16:00. I would suggest another location if you are looking for a livelier scene.",

There are rumors they're booked out for the year since they take reservations by phone for any time.\n\nThe places considered to be at the very top are essentially members only - Saito explicitly so, Namba and Sugita effectively so. A bunch of other places unfortunately don't officially open their reservations (to us normies) up until a certain point.",

Nishizaki you can reserve online, but it's a bit of a crapshoot what's available when reservations come online since regulars get first crack at the slots before it opens to the public. Sushidokoro Yamato you have to call one(?) month out (you should double check this but I believe reservations opened up April 1 for May reservations), but they don't hold back seats for regulars. I've been told it's hard to get through but I outsourced the work to my hotel concierge and they were able to get me a lunch reservation. Yamato is up to 22000 JPY for the course now, and last I checked Nishizaki is around 20000. Tokyo Gourmet has blog posts on both I'd check out, but I'm on mobile rn so it's a bit hard for me to link.",

Every restaurant has its own atmosphere, style of fish/rice/seasoning/etc., theme, history, etc. If you don't have a specific place in mind, you're probably better off searching well-known lists of sushi restaurants (like [this one](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-places-for-sushi-in-tokyo)), the [Michelin guide](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en) for the cities you'll be in, and sites like [Pocket Concierge](https://pocket-concierge.jp/en/) for places that look good and are in your budget. And that's assuming you mean sushi omakase. If you simply mean \"set course\", there are additionally tons of good kaiseki places, tempura places, and so forth. From there, you'll have to figure out what's still available for your time frame, or you could use a booking site to do it for you.\n\nAnd frankly, I would lower your budget. You can get some really amazing places for $100-150/person, especially if you go at lunch time (when the prices are lower but the food is equally as good). If you don't know enough to already want to specifically pick your own restaurant or style of food, you'll have a pretty amazing meal at almost any fancy place with a decent reputation.",

I\u2019m Japanese, and have come across a lot of people here on Reddit who are asking about great/best omakase restaurants in Japan, which is quite confusing to me as there is no such a thing. From a cheap izakaya to a fancy French restaurant, they have their own omakase courses. People don\u2019t really have to talk about omakase; they just want to look into restaurants. I have to wonder where this whole misunderstanding of omakase is coming from.",

All my favorite sushi omakase are just from tiny hole-in-the-wall places that offer it as an option, and the pricing can be quite affordable. I've had amazing omakase experiences all across Japan in a variety of styles, food types, and restaurant types. \n\nI think the misunderstanding just comes from English-speaking blogs and articles that use the term and often apply it to high-end sushi places. There are a shocking number of people in the United States who don't know what \"prix fixe\" means, and I think it's a similar issue. People read it once or twice and don't know the nuances, but they still like the idea of what they saw and want to experience it themselves.",

It was about 1h 45 mins long and at $65 (drinks separate at about ~$7 a drink) we thought the value was pretty good! For groups larger than 3, you might end up at a booth (which can be a massive gripe for some if you are looking to watch the chefs in action). They take bookings via tablecheck, which will take an initial deposit that will be returned after you go for your reservation. I believe some locations have a lunch omakase, which is walk in only!",

The chef spoke English and made things fun. The sushi was really good, but maybe a bit different. When we went she made each one that was inspired by other regional cuisines, so India, Spain, NYC, Italy, etc.\n\nYou can book a reservation online easily enough. I think it was about $150/person.",

At the end after the miso soup, everyone sorta looked around and thought \"oh is it done\" and awkwardly made their way out.\n\nThe chef however was really skilled and spoke English well.

Otherwise I would stick to local sushi joints since what's considered \"average\" in Japan is probably very different to other places (speaking from US).\n\nI've done $300/per pair omakase in US (Seattle) and personally found the quality amazing for what you pay for. Not something I can make at home or get at a regular sushi joint. Also some of my most memorable meals where I was actually full afterwards / didn't feel ripped off. Not something you eat every month but definitely a special occasion moment. \n\nI'd be curious how far $500/per pair goes in Japan, but I'm also happy with experiencing the $50 omakase.",

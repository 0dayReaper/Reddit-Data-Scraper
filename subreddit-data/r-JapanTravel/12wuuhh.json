    "postText": "Hiya!\n\nI went to Japan for the first time in 2017 by myself when I was 20 years old: WWOOF-ing for 3 months in the Honshu area (Narita, Yamagata, Hirosaki, Appikogen (Ski resort near Morioka) with a few city trips scattered throughout (Sendai, Morioka, Yamagata, Tokyo). I was honestly pretty disappointed at the Japanese cities (I guess I'm more into older style cities), but maybe I just did something wrong. Ueno Park &amp; Science Museum was pretty cool though I guess. All the billboards, lights, traffic, and immense crowd of people just don't appeal to me at all is what I found out.\n\nCome around 2023 and I'm doing it differently. With my fianc\u00e9e I will be renting a car for 3 weeks, and then WWOOF another 17 days (but that's outside this itenerary) because it was actually mega fun the first time around.\n\n1. The trip is from November 7 to November 29 (after which we'll WWOOF through December 15)\n2. Naturally, I'll only list the biggest activities of the day, of course we'll always visit the surrounding area whenever we can as the evenings and morning are not really planned yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Day 1\n\n* Pick up Suica Welcome Pass &amp; Pocket WiFi\n   * As we don't need the Suica card for public transport right away, we might get this later as we'll need it more than 30 days\n* Stay at Narita Tobu Hotel after arriving at Narita Airport 7:30 P.M.\n\n# Day 2\n\n* Pick up car &amp; leave luggage\n* Visit Narita Ometesando &amp; Temples relatively early\n* Visit Narita Museum of Japanese History including their gardens &amp; Samurai Path nearby\n* Drive 2.5 hours to Nikko to check into AirBNB House #1 (3 nights)\n\n# Day 3\n\n* Visit Nikko Toushou-guu Temple Complex &amp; Shinkyo Bridge\n* Drive to Kirifuri falls and take a 10km hike.\n* Go to an Onsen in Kinugawa-onsen\n\n# Day 4\n\n* Edo wonderland\n* Hike if there's time left (we don't know how long Edo Wonderland will take)\n\n# Day 5\n\n* Check out\n* Drive up the Iroha Slope to Kegon Falls &amp; Lake Chuuzenji\n* Visit (souvenir) shops / restaurants\n* Hike around Senjogahara (north-west of the Lake)\n* Drive 4 hours to Yamanochi: an AirBNB right next to the Nagano Snow Monkeys\n* Check in (3 nights)\n\n# Day 6\n\n* Hike to the snow monkeys and back\n* Visit Yubatake-onsen to relax and eat (1 hour drive and back)\n\n# Day 7\n\n* Visit to Nagano city to see the Matsumoto Zozan War Tunnels, Matsushiro Castle, and the Zenkou-ji Temple\n* Drive to the mountains north-west of Nagano to hike past cedar trees leading to the [Togakushi Shrine Okusha](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Togakushi+Shrine+Okusha+(Main+Shrine)+Zuishinmon/@36.7563233,138.0638772,15.33z/data=!4m23!1m16!4m15!1m6!1m2!1s0x601d84d6e33c441b:0x6b82fd8e8aeba971!2zTWF0c3VzaGlyb2rFjSBDYXN0bGUgUnVpbnMg5p2-5Luj5Z-O6Leh!2m2!1d138.1959137!2d36.5654922!1m6!1m2!1s0x5ff7856ba4a846a9:0x2ab70333f870faea!2sTogakushi-Jinja,+Ch%C5%ABsha-3506+Togakushi,+Nagano,+381-4101,+Japan!2m2!1d138.0850242!2d36.7424115!3e0!3m5!1s0x5ff62e5badbbe687:0x1bd26c015e8f0efc!8m2!3d36.76105!4d138.0690306!16s%2Fg%2F113j8160s)\n\n# Day 8\n\n* Check out\n* Visit [Kamikochi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kamikochi/@36.2513203,137.6506547,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d0e9010f1c50b:0x9a6e421faf5c3807!8m2!3d36.2513203!4d137.653235!16s%2Fm%2F027qll0) basically the whole afternoon - this is the very last day it's opened to the public this year (November 15), so this is the only day it'd be possible.

            "comment": "I really want to comment because your Day 21 program in Sawara hits me personally. Definitely go for it! Sawara is the birth place of my husband and I go there every year, love it with all my heart. The rest of the town which is the biggest part is nothing special but the historical center is definitely a step back in time. Of course after Katori Jingu or before, I HIGHLY reccomend you to visit the small **Suwa Jingu shrine** that is in Sawara itself, just 10 min walk from the station. You have to climb a lot of steps but this place is my favorite there, there is hardly no one there (except during matsuri) and it is located in a mini forest, you just feel quiet and away from the time. Old and new Kitsune small statues, and a magnificent old and tall shinboku (surrounded by paper Shimanewa) sacred tree next to the shrine and Komainu statues. If you want a stamp for the shrine, you have to stop midway on the stairs and you'll see a small house, that's actually where the shrine maintenance-person live (passed it so many times without realizing, lol.). He is really nice. This is definitely not a well-known shrine but if you enjoy this type of places, I reccomend it by all means!",

But I just had an idea! My husband\u2019s parent\u2019s house is located near an amazing shrine in Inashiki called Osugi jinja. It\u2019s really close to Sawara (15 min by car or so, and I believe there is a bus going there). This shrine is especially impressive because of its magnificent colors, and the shrine venerates several different Kamis, it\u2019s really worth seeing!\n\nAlso, when you are in Narita, don\u2019t hesitate to walk around and discover the place. It actually has beautiful traditional houses, good street food and some shrines hidden here and there :)! Of course the big attraction in Narita is the Narita-San temple with its huge pagoda. But there is way more to it! Behind it there is a beautiful, extremely beautiful Japanese garden, with a very large pond and very quiet. There is also actually a Shinto shrine inside the temple, dedicated to Inari. It is full of Kitsune statues from all ages, it\u2019s worth seeing!\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I cannot be of big use, I really only usually go to Sawara-Inashiki and also Kashima as it was my husband\u2019s workplace. By the way that reminds me!!!!! From Sawara; you have a direct train to Kashima (maybe 15-20min max?) and there is the Kashima Jingu, a very famous shrine that equals the Katori one. It\u2019s located in a forest and it has a lot of secret small places, like a small pond holding a torii in the middle of the water. Really magical!!\n\nSorry if I cannot be of more help, I will come back and tell you if I have more ideas!! :)",

    "postText": "Hello! While browsing this subreddit I've seen several comments saying that Akihabara is pretty dead in the evening, and that one should visit before 8pm otherwise everything will be closed.\n\nThe way our schedule works right now, we only have time to visit Akihabara on the day we arrive in Tokyo. Our flight from Europe lands in Haneda at 1:50pm on Friday. Our hotel is in Ginza, so I'm roughly estimating that getting through security, to the hotel, and resting a bit, that we'll be ready to go out around \\~5:30pm or so, maybe even later. Then of course we need to get our Suica cards, figure out public transport, and actually get to Akihabara, so maybe it will be 6-7pm when we actually arrive. Which only leaves about 1-2 hours before supposed 8pm dead zone.\n\nRegarding Akihabara, we're not super big anime people nor into the geek culture (I watched Naruto and Bleach as a teenager but not much since then and my wife has literally no familiarity), so not trying to do any shopping. Just want to be a tourist and sightsee in this famous neighborhood. I do like arcade games so it would be fun to spend some time there. \n\nOur alternative plan would be to just walk around and explore the stuff nearby our hotel in Ginza that evening. I love parks and greenery, so I saw Kokyo Gaien Garden, Hibiya Park, and Kiriko Lounge of Tokyo Plaza are open 24/7. (Hamarikyu Gardens closes at 5pm so that's out of the question). Maybe check out Marunouchi Ekimae Square and the area near Tokyo station? We'll be spending an afternoon in Ginza anyway later in the trip to do some shopping and visiting temples and parks in Kyoto and Nara later, so that's why I'm not sure the parks near Ginza is worth visiting as opposed to Akihabara which has fewer \"substitutes\".\n\nWDYT, any suggestions or advice about Akihabara vs Ginza after we land? Thanks in advance!",

There is a different kind of establishments that open during those times on the side streets - not that they would let foreigners enter. But it kind of changes the vibe.\n\nOur hotel this year was in Akihabara, so we got to experience it at some odd times.",

Yea I don't think we'll mind passing by them, as long as there isn't any sketchy characters or something.

There were multiple shops that had people playing video games outside of them. \n\nThis time, a lot of the shops were arcades or those claw games (not sure what they are called). It just wasn't the same atmosphere. \n\nWith that said, i enjoyed Shinjuku much much better.\n\ni would say it's worth checking out because it may be better when you go.

The major anchors like Animate, Sofmap, AmiAmi etc. will open into the night as well as major electronics stores like Bic Camera and Yodobashi. But, these stores also have branches in other parts of the city as well, so they're not exactly a must-visit. (The only thing I think I should mention is that the same anime shops in Ikebukuro will most likely be more otome-oriented, that is catering to women).\n\nWhat I like about Akihabara at night though is its food scene, the little restaurants tucked into the streets away from the main road flanked with anime shops come alive with people coming out of work to eat and hang out.",

Lashinbang at 9, that is a second hand anim\u00e9 goods store.\n\nBic camera at 9, Donki open 24/24, but those are big chains that can be found everywhere and maybe not especially representative of Akihabara pop culture side. Ok, Bic Camera can fit in the electronic store category that is also a big part of Alihabara.\n\nPop life department m\u2019s that close at 11, that is the famous sex shop right next to the electric town exit.\n\nArcade close at 11:30.\n\nOther that that you would still have restaurants open after 8pm.\n\nSo if you are not that much into anime/manga but want to have a taste of Akihabara, having 1-2 hours to check most stores is fines, you can pick some like Radio Kaikan that have many stores on different floors, located just next to the station, plenty of figures and anime goods, then just go walk on the main street, just seeing the lights and the style/vibe of the city can be cool, can still check stores before 8, there is also electronic stores or video games stores. Then after go check arcade and the sex shop, even if you don\u2019t play/buy anything you can see what these places have to offer.",

I would do it once, but I wouldn't make it a priority. \n\nIf just want to bum around and do some light shopping/window shopping, I would go to Ginza. If you're a big foodie, the department stores (B1 and B2 levels( have an absurd amount of amazing cakes and pastries that are on-par if not better than what you get in France. On the same levels you'll find the nice supermarkets and omiyage that you can pick up snacks at the same time. Also in Ginza, designer stores (if you're into that), traditional fabric stores, an absolutely massive Uniqlo + GU, prefecture specific stores (Okinawa, Toyama, etc...), and more. \n\nThere's lots of food options if you get hungry. I can provide recs if needed, but a personal favorite is Oborodzuki (tsukemen) but in the same area there are a bunch of notable ramen, udon and sushi spots (Sushi no Midori!) within a block walking. Pro-tip, if you want to try Ginza Kagari Ramen, just go to their shop in Roppongi instead - more options, less wait. More food - if it gets late, Yurakucho is great. Lots of the izakayas are open late and its walkable to most of Ginza.\n\nCaveat is that these all pretty much close by 8:30PM as well, but at least you won't have to spend the 20 minutes getting to/from Akiba.",

Lots to do in all those places at night.\n\nFeel free to PM if you're looking for something specific, and don't forget to use tabelog!",

Arcades exist at all the larger stations, as do electronic stores. But if it's a specific thing you're looking for, Akiba (potentially) has niche/curated stores to find them. Maid cafes of course can easily be found there, but... again not something I'd reccommend. It's a very awkward experience unless you're really into it.",

    "postText": "Hi, so this will be my first time in Japan arriving on 27th August and returning on 25th September.\nI've written over 10 itineraries and am getting myself into overthinking territory now. I'm wanting to be sure that I'm getting the balance right and not missing any hidden gems!\n\nI'm a nature lover and probably slightly more interested in seeing traditional Japan over tech Japan but only marginally.\n\nAugust 27th: Arrive in Narita at 1.30pm. Relax and eat - Taito City.\n\nAugust 28th: Tokyo - Akihabara District, Tokyo Tower and Senso-ji. \n\nAugust 29th: Tokyo - teamLab Planets &amp; Imperial Palace\n\nAugust 30th: Fujinomiya - Leave Tokyo at 6am. Owakudani am - travel to Fujinomiya\n\nAugust 31st: Fujinomiya - get the first bus to Fuji 5th station and recover in the evening.\n\nSeptember 1st: Kyoto - Leave Fujinomiya at 10am. Visit Shino-Ito falls before moving on to Kyoto &amp; East Kyoto Attractions\n\nSeptember 2nd: Kyoto - West Kyoto attractions.\n\nSeptember 3rd: Kyoto - Samurai Experience\n\nSeptember 4th: Osaka - Leave Kyoto Midday. Osaka Castle &amp; Central Osaka attractions\n\nSeptember 5th: Osaka - Hiking Day by Iwahashiyama\n\nSeptember 6th: Osaka - Kobe day trip and hopefully get some really good beef for my birthday \ud83c\udf82 \n\nSeptember 7th: Osaka - Nara day trip. Feed deer.\n\nSeptember 8th: Osaka - Today is all about street food and beer. Maybe do Osaka pub crawl (or do this yesterday to avoid hangover on the train)\n\nSeptember 9th: Hiroshima - Leave Osaka at 10am. Arrive in Hiroshima and visit peace park, castle and dome and eat Okonomiyaki\n\nSeptember 10th: Hiroshima - Day trip to Itsukushima\n\nSeptember 11th: Nagasaki - Leave Hiroshima at 10am. Central Nagasaki, peace park and atomic bomb museum\n\nSeptember 12th: Nagasaki - Mt. Inasayama observatory and surrounding parks\n\nSeptember 13th: Okayama - Leave Nagasaki at 10am. Okayama Castle and surrounding city centre\n\nSeptember 14th: Okayama - visit Kurashiki in the morning and then on to Takamatsu in the afternoon. Return in the evening.\n\nSeptember 15th: Kanazawa - Leave Okayama at 10am. Relax and maybe catch up on sleep if needed. Eat food and drink\u00a0beer.\n\nSeptember 16th: Kanazawa - Kanazawa Castle, head to the coast going through all the parks\n\nSeptember 17th: Kanazawa - Day trip to Shirakawa-go\n\nSeptember 18th: Nagano - Leave Kanazawa at 10am. Arrive at Nagano and aim to see Snow Monkeys early-mid afternoon\n\nSeptember 19th: Tokyo - Leave Nagoya at 3.30pm. Visit Daio Wasabi Farm &amp; Maybe pop to Matsumoto. Head to Tokyo.\n\nSeptember 20th: Tokyo - Shinjuku Area, maybe some theme cafes and the muscle girl bar.\n\nSeptember 21st: Tokyo - Nikko Day Trip\n\nSeptember 22nd: Tokyo - Shibuya Area\n\nSeptember 23rd: Tokyo - Yokohama Day Trip &amp; Kamakura\n\nSeptember 24th: Tokyo - Free day to do anything I've missed\n\nSeptember 25th: Tokyo - Free morning and head back to Narita about 1pm\n\nPart of me is tempted to cut off another day from Tokyo to head from Nagasaki to Kumamoto and rent a car to walk around Mount Aso but this is risky due to the instability of the conditions so could be inaccessible.\nReading my itinerary I'm not even sure I've allowed enough time to see Tokyo given all the day trips!\n\nNot sure if I get both a 21 day followed by 7 day JR pass as I know it won't cover every bit of travel I'll be doing but I have a feeling it might be the least stressful option.\n\nMoney wise- for food, drink and activites/entrance fees - planning \u00a33500. Realistic?\n\nThank you if you've read any of this :)",

I think there definitely needs to be another rework to it but perhaps I'm trying to fit too many places into a single trip. I have been sort of lumping Osaka and Kyoto together into my head due to the 30min train between but I'd really rather spend more time in Kyoto. The time I've had in the plan for Toyko has been steadily reducing.",

Tokyo to Nagasaki is, what, 7 hours of train time? So you lose one of your 29 days to unnecessary travel. I love the shinkansen, but hate this inefficiency.\n\nNRT to Nagasaki doesn't have good flights, but you could easily connect to FUK or HIJ and cut at least one long train day out of your itinerary.\n\nFor anyone planning travel, just book the trip as a one-stop to the furthest point from Tokyo you want to visit, then work your way towards Tokyo.",

Nagasaki wasn't originally in my plans and the original plan was to do exactly that - fly into one airport and out of another.\nUnfortunately, the difference in cost was too large. The only other alternative was a different inbound and outbound airport in the UK - but any saving would have been cancelled out by the cost to travel from London to Manchester.\nI'm tempted to rewrite once more and scale the trip back down to its original scope which only had me going as far as Hiroshima to allow me to explore more areas in detail.",

I'd personally book the 325p, knowing that the same airline has another one at 545p. I've not flown with those carriers, so I would do some research there. But it puts you 90 minutes out from Nagasaki and Fukuoka is a great place to grab a bite to eat at night after your arrival. This would likely help you with jet lag too.",

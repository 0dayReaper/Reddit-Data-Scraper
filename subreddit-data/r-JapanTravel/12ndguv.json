    "postText": "Hi all. No rush or emergency with this question I am just polishing my itinerary. I am currently weighing up two options for an overnight stay towards the end on my trip. I have a JR Pass, am solo travelling and just have a backpack. The route summary will be:\n\nOsaka -&gt; via Himeji for castle visit -&gt; Hiroshima/Miyajima (overnight) -&gt; Next day is night time shinkansen to Tokyo\n\nI have a refundable hotel booked in Hiroshima (near the station) however after looking at my plans, I have started to think a second option (below) seems to make a lot more sense unless I am missing something obvious?\n\n**Option 1:** Sunday\n\n* Leave Osaka in morning\n* Stop at Himeji\n* Arrive in Hiroshima\n* Find dinner and back to hotel\n\nMonday\n\n* Early start to get ferry to Miyajima\n* Visit Itsukushima Jinja\n* Back on ferry to Hiroshima\n* Peace Park, Atomic Bomb Dome and Memorial Museum\n* Checkout and shinkansen to Tokyo\n\n**Option 2:**\n\nSunday\n\n* Leave Osaka in morning\n* Stop at Himeji\n* Arrive in Hiroshima\n* Ferry to Miyajima (**final ferry time is 16:10 I believe with JR pass so provided I'm here before then, the above schedule seems OK time-wise?**)\n* Evening in Miyajima (..?)\n\nMonday\n\n* Wake up very early and visit Itsukushima Jinja at sunrise before crowds\n* Checkout of hotel.\n* Ferry to Hiroshima late morning/lunchtime.\n* Sightseeing bus to visit Peace Park, Atomic Bomb Dome and Memorial Museum\n* Shinkansen to Tokyo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just think by staying the night on Miyajima I don't have the worry of trying to get to and from the island AND then explore the important areas of Hiroshima before an evening shinkansen. Is Option B therefore what others would do or have I missed something obvious?\n\nIf I do switch, it means I would now suddenly have an evening in Miyajima rather than Hiroshima (which is an area I haven't done too much research on yet), so any advice for what I can do to make the most out of this would be appreciated\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: I appreciate all the responses however I have realised I have made a stupid mistake. I did a search on** [**booking.com**](https://booking.com) **for 'Miyajima' and it suggested Miyajima Coral. After looking on the map and although this is a hotel near the ferry port for Miyajima, it is actually on the Hiroshima side! More planning needed unfortunately...**",

Lovely to see sunset behind the Torii gates. Eating options are a bit limited; plan this part.\n\nI highly recommend staying overnight. It was very special. You can transfers trains in Hiroshima and continue straight to Miyajimaguchi station. \n\nOn return, you will likely have a line up at the Peace Museum. Our schedule allowed us mornings in both places, but as we exited I saw a fair line up coming in. I don't imagine it's a deal breaker, but just fyi",

People in Hiroshima are totally obsessed with baseball and love their team, and the stadium is right next to the train station.\n\nMiyajima is much quieter at night, but with extra time there you'll have time to hike up to the peak of Mt. Misen, which will give you absolutely gorgeous views of the surrounding islands... assuming you have nice weather.",

I actually have already got tickets in Tokyo for the Giants vs Carp luckily.\n\nBased on itineraries I have seen online, if I set out early from Osaka I should be able to have a nice stroll around the castle grounds etc at Himeji and be finished in time for a shinkansen which would get me to Hiroshima station at 13:51. As I don't have a hotel on Miyajima now, the updated itinerary is currently:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Arrive at Hiroshima station around 2pm\n* Coin locker at station\n* Jump on sight seeing loop bus and reach visit memorial museum &amp; atomic bomb dome and visit through 3pm onwards **(EDIT 2: Never mind! Announcement literally yesterday that on this day the G7 summit will mean the museum is shut on this day)**\n* Ride loop bus back to station and pick up bag and look into night time activity (or sleep!)\n\nThen next day:\n\n* 15 minute walk to station and take JR Sanyo Line to Miyajimaguchi\n* Ferry to Miyajima\n* Visit Itsukushima Shrine + time dependent maybe squeeze something else\n* Ferry back\n* Take subway back to Hiroshima station and hop on loop bus to visit peace park and Okonomimura\n* Ride loop bus back to station and very late shinkansen to Tokyo",

If you stay there you'll be able to get up early before the ferries start bringing in loads of tourists and enjoy the floating gates peacefully. By 9 in the morning the place is completely overrun. The hike up and down my misen is totally worth it and the view at the top is considered one of the best views in Japan. Nightlife in Hiroshima is okay, saw the biggest congestion of Salarymen blowing off steam than anywhere else. All the main Hiroshima attractions, which are around peace park, can be done in an afternoon or evening. The vibe is ridiculously heavy at dusk and worth while.",

            "comment": "Highly recomend staying on Miyajima, especially if seeing the shrine is your goal. Day trippers tend to show up, browse the shops, take tons of torii photos, and then leave without seeing the shrine or any other sights. You can see both Peace Park/museum and Itsukushima in one day - we did - but you're going to have to cut things short to get the train to the ferry, then out to the island, back from the island, the train back to Hiroshima, and then transportation (bus or taxi) to the Peace Park. And then consider your timing on getting transportation back to get your desired shinkansen. It feels rushed, and while you're in control of how much time you're spending just soaking in the sights, cutting short that time to hit all your transportation marks could be frustrating. Staying on Miyajima pushes one of those travel legs to the previous/next day and allows for more leisure.\n\nWe stayed at Hotel Makoto, it was affordable enough and the meals were AMAZING. Nighttime on the island is so quiet and magical, and being able to take another stroll along the omotesando to hit the shops before people arrive for the day is an underrated perk. The ryokans vary in price but generally they will be more expensive than a city hotel in Hiroshima, but you're usually getting huge kaiseki dinner and breakfast, a bath of some kind, and a traditional room for it, which is an experience worth the cost. You can probably get deals that may not include meals but yeah, there's no real late-open restaurants on the island, even the one brewery was closed by nightfall.",

We took a long walk through the streets and trails to digest which was magnificent..felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. I loved it so much so went out again at 5am to climb Mt Mison for sunrise. Livemax also has a private onsen which looks out to the shrine. We would have loved to stay longer. Highly recommend.",

As others have said, if you appreciate a quiet night around town, I would say overnight on Miyajima fits the bill well.\n\nTook the Shinkansen from Kyoto around 9:30am. Stashed my bag at the Hiroshima station temporarily and went down to Kure for the day to see the Yamato Museum. Got to the island around 4pm (The shrine and ferries back to the mainland looked packed at this time) and checked into a ryokan. Rested and had dinner there, then went out after to walk over to the Itsukushima area. They light up torii gate and other structures at night and maybe there was only 20 people walking around. Ended up walking around there and the town for a couple hours, it was very nice.\n\nWoke up early and visited the shrine as it opened around 630ish so only a couple of people there. Visited there for an hour or so, had breakfast at the ryokan, then walked around the shops as they opened up. Took the noon ferry that day and was able to see the peace park, museum, and dome before 5pm. Even got in a Carps game that night which was fantastic. People cheering this or that almost all game long.",

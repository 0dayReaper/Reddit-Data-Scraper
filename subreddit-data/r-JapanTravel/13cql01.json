    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI'll be going to Japan in July with my husband and 2 kids (3 and 7). Would love advice on our tentative schedule and also where to stay. We'll be staying at the Conrad our first 2 nights but are having trouble deciding on where to stay the last 2 nights.\n\nDay 1 - Arrive at Narita late, around 10pm\n\nDay 2 - Tsukiji market for breakfast, Pokemon Center and Cafe (mainly for my 7 year old who is obsessed), Senso-ji, wander around Akihabara if we have time/energy\n\nDay 3 - Daytrip to Yokohama: Cup Noodles museum, Gundam Factory, Chinatown\n\nDay 4 - Ghibli Museum+Shirohige Cream Puff Factory, Nakano Broadway, explore either Ikebukuro or Harajuku\n\nDay 5 - Head back to Narita for afternoon flight\n\nI'd love advice for where to stay for nights 3 and 4. Options are somewhere in Ikebukuro, Sotetsu Grand Fresa Takadanobaba, or Hotel Groove Shinjuku. Since we have young kids we won't be going out late at night so nightlife is not important at all. At first I was leaning towards Hotel Groove, but it's in the Kabukicho neighborhood. Since we don't really plan on staying out late at night maybe it's a non-issue? The Takadanobaba hotel is $150 cheaper which is the main draw and still on the Yamanote line. Is there enough to do around the area? I've read that Ikebukuro is also a good place to stay with lots to do so should we look for something there instead?",

If you're only spending 3 days in Tokyo, I don't think it makes sense to spend one of them in Yokohama.\n\nIf you're doing Ghibli Museum, I recommend spending time in Kichijoji, as well.",

Lots of low-cost domestic carriers fly into NRT because it is cheaper to operate into than HND. For all we know OP is based in Korea or China where a four-day city break in Tokyo is extremely sensible (the hotel changing is extremely not sensible).",

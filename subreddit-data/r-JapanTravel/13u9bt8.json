    "postText": "Tokyo-Hakone-Kyoto-Nara-Osaka-Kobe\n\nJust wanted to preface this and say that for my partner and I, jet lag became our friend. We got up super early with ease and did everything we wanted to do. So if jet lag is something worrisome for you, think of it as a positive \ud83d\ude42\n\n\\*\\*all prices are in Canadian dollars which is 1:100 Japanese yen.\n\n\\*sorry for any grammatical / punctuation errors\n\nTakeaways:\n\n\\-Fruit is expensive as heck in Japan!!!\n\n\\-Bring plastic bags for garbage with you!!\n\n\\-Going to the washroom &amp; \u201cdropping off your kids at the pool\u201d is a \\* religious \\*  experience\n\n\\-Splurge on kobe beef &amp; omakase!!-Get a bullet train / shinkanssen pass. We found that it was extremely worth it for the days we were in Kyoto, Nara, Osaka and Kobe as we used it everyday on the JR lines. For an entire week we did not replenish our Suica.\n\n\\-Japan has this Peach water that tastes like REAL fruit juice. Identical to when you bite into a peach. GET IT!\n\n\\-For money conversion, I found that my credit card gave me a better rate than converting my cash. However, cash is still king in Japan, especially in the markets.\n\n\\-The japan metro/JR/Subway system etc is overwhelming at first however, we learned it the first day. Google maps was my bestie.\n\n\\-The culture shock is huge. Japanese people are very dutiful. Everytime we needed help, locals would always go out of their way to make sure we got to our destination, even if that meant a 10minute detour for themselves. Japan is also very forward looking. I was impressed with how I was handed a sheet to put over my face to avoid my makeup getting on the clothes when trying things on.\n\n\\-Comme les gar\u00e7ons does not let you try on their shirts \ud83d\ude23\n\n8 May 2023 (Monday)Canada -&gt; TOKYO\n\nWe checked in for our flight on air Canada as well as the Japan website.Highly recommend downloading Ubigi as an air sim and getting the suica card on your iphone wallet! Suica saved us a lot of time and we just tapped as we went along.\n\n9 May 2023 (Tuesday) TOKYOArrived in Narita airport\n\nI highly recommend getting the airport limo bus. I used this link: [https://www.klook.com/.../2274-narita-haneda-airport.../](https://www.klook.com/.../2274-narita-haneda-airport.../)...Service to and from the airport cost us 45$ canadian total per person and was a great choice since we did not have to worry about transfers on our first day in Japan. Lots of leg room, AC &amp; WIFI.Our airbnb was near Okubo station. I loved our location as it was 1 stop away from shinjuku station and we had the best ramen. Restaurant is called Gomaryu.\n\n10 May 2023 (Wednesday) TOKYO / shibazakura festival\n\nOur trip was slightly changed as seeing Mt Fuji was important to us and this was the only day we knew for certain would be sunny! Initially, I had planned a chill day but we rearranged everything and went to the Shibazakura festival. I highly recommend going as it was beautiful with tons of Instagramable photo spots and great food vendors.\n\n11 May 2023(Thursday) TOKYO / DISNEYLAND\n\nI booked tickets for us on Klook for Disneyland.I have never been to any Disneyland but this one was truly magical! My partner and I cried after the beauty and the beast ride. We got to the park at 8am and werent let in till 9am. We were one of the first 10% of people who arrived. Keep in mind that people who stayed at the Disney resort got a 15mins head start so once it was our turn, we ran towards the B&amp;B ride to which there was already a 3hr wait immediately. Paying an extra 20$/pp was a no brainer and 10000% worth it. Honestly never experienced nostalgia and magic to this degree. Also want to give a shoutout to the tower of terror 10/10 and 10mins lineup. The starwars ride was also superb for what it was. Alien mochi was worth the hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12 May 2023 (Friday) TOKYO / tsukiji market &amp; sumo performance\n\nTsukiji market was worth visiting with the variety of food. I do not recommend getting anything \u201ca5 wagyu\u201d or sushi as it is not the freshest. I learned the hard way that not all sushi is made equally in Japan so splurge on an omakase (more on my experience later).I booked a sumo experience with klook: [https://www.klook.com/.../75397-sumo-lunch-experience.../](https://www.klook.com/.../75397-sumo-lunch-experience.../)...Amazing meal (I still think about the katsu we had) and show! Was very intimate and got to fight the sumo wrestlers! This day was a core memory for sure.We also visited the unicorn gundam statue which was UNBELIEVABLE!!\n\n13 May 2023 (Saturday) TOKYO\n\nThis day was supposed to be relaxing\u2026 but we somehow did 30k steps. We went to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (so beautiful and amazing starbucks!), Meiji Jingu shrine, imperial palace &amp; y\u016bsh\u016bkan museum (ww2 history &amp; samurai)\n\n14 May 2023 (Sunday) TOKYO bullet train to yunessan \n\nThis was the first day we had for activating our shinkansen pass. We travelled to an onsen in the mountains of Hakone. It is called Yunessan onsen and it was AMAZING. It is the onsen where you can bathe in wine, coffee, sake, green tea etc. We for some reason did not have high expectations but it superseded everything. We paid extra for the fish bath where they eat your dead skin (so ticklish and a crazy experience) and we went to the adult part of the onsen where everyone is naked. Here we found ourselves submerged in lemon water while it was raining with a view of the mountains. Truly a sublime experience\n\n15 May 2023 (Monday) TOKYO -&gt; KYOTO We walked everywhere this day.Saw the emperor, checked out Kinnkaku-ji (Golden Temple), and Yasaka shrine (had the best matcha soft serve)\n\n16 May 2023 (Tuesday) KYOTO We Travelled to Fushimi Inari shrine (super busy and touristy but worth it!), nara park to see the bowing deer , saw the Todaiji temple and visited the famous mochi making place called nakatani mochi shop and saw the show! Best mochi I had all trip. We decided not to go to the Arashiyama bamboo forest as it did not seem worth it from other people\u2019s reviews.\n\n17 May 2023 (Wednesday) KYOTO -&gt; OSAKA Kuromon market had everything similar to Tsukiji market in Tokyo. One thing i loved here were the sweet potato chips that had sugar and salt coating. We also visited a micro pig cafe and the animals seemed very happy. Dotonburri had so many food options.\n\n18 May 2023 (Thursday) OSAKA -&gt; KOBE -&gt; OSAKA My partner had a religious experience here as we both had the best beef of our life. We had kobe and wagyu beef at mouriya honten in Kobe (we travelled here using our JR pass so it was \\*technically free\\*). I wanted to take some time to note how amazing the hospitality was and that the chef cooked our beef in thirds. He made sure that every slice of beef we put in our mouth was still hot and watched as we ate to gage when to start searing the next slabs of beef. I WAS AMAZED!!! Total spent here was $240 CDN.Next we visited the zoo in Osaka and it was only 5$ CDN! (500 JAPANESE yen). I have never seen a red panda before so that was the highlight for me!After this we did mario kart in the streets of Osaka/Dotonburi. [https://www.klook.com/.../8590-street-go-kart.../](https://www.klook.com/.../8590-street-go-kart.../)...I originally wanted to book it for us in Tokyo but it was booked out for a month!! However, the tour guides were amazing and it was a blast. I am not sure why others advised against it and that local Japanese people are annoyed by this activity because I found everyone waving at us, smiling and taking videos. 10/10 activity.\n\n19 May 2023 (Friday)  OSAKA. I never had souffl\u00e9 pancakes so I made a reservation for us at Happy Pancake in Osaka. WAS DELICIOUS AND THE LINE WAS SO LONG FOR PEOPLE WHO DID NOT MAKE A RESERVATION. Also the fruit was really worth it as I said before, Fruit is very hard to come by.The rest of the day was for exploring Dotonburi and shopping.\n\n20 May 2023 (Saturday) OSAKA -&gt;  TOKYO Free day!We had michelin ramen for 15$ in \u2026 A SUBWAY STATION. Ginza kagari! The creamiest broth with chicken and truffle. It was life changing to say the least. We go there at 4pm and the line only formed after we left.\n\n21 May 2023 (Sunday) - Last full day \ud83d\ude41  TOKYO We had an omakase booking at Sushi Yajima and I was so happy. It is run by a old couple who speak PERFECT english. The freshest fish and each person only paid 44$! I made sure to research this place and many other omakase experiences and this was worth way more than what we paid for. The husband was making the nigiri for us and he said the funniest things! He was plating tuna for my partner and said: \u201cThis fish is Viagra. You are strong man so you don\u2019t need it, but I need it\u201d HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET AND WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE BEST SUSHI IN JAPAN. \ud83d\ude02\n\n22 May 2023(Monday)  TOKYO -&gt;back home",

We were in the area at 9 am, and ended up luckily passing by the clipboard, signed our name on the list (3rd group) and continued exploring the neighborhood. When coming back, we were the among the first seated when the place opened at 10 am which worked out great since there was a long line around the corner by that time",

Pre-trip, multiple days I waited until midnight japan time when the new day \u201cdropped\u201d and there was never any availability on their website for any time. Very weird. Got to Japan this morning and went to the ginza location- they have a QR code posted outside and using it gets you on a waitlist (the link will continuously update your position in the queue if you refresh). The wait was 105min when i got on but then it ended up being about 60min (4:45p JST on a Monday is when we arrived there). We just hung out nearby (plenty of shops and malls and cafes) and returned. Nice meal. All tourists. Pancakes were excellent.",

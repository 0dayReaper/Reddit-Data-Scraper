I was going to get a translator to write us a little card that explains the issue when we order food but we are worried about cross contamination.\n\nDo restaurants cook with soybean oil (or vegetable oil blended with soybeans)?\n\nAre there a lot of food additives like soy lecithin, locust bean gum, carob bean gum, etc in their food?\n\nThank you!",

Of course riceball stuffing, yakitori, and grilled meats often can contain soy sauce or miso.  \n\nAre you sure he's actually intolerant of soy sauce and soybean oil?  Soybean oil doesn't typically contain the proteins that trigger soy allergies.",

Unless it's a super large place (which is abnormal for yakitori), you would be hard pressed to find an image with more than one set of rails. It's probably because unless the volume is super high (more than like 20 sticks every few minutes), it's not worth keeping alive multiple sets of coals.",

They do not list all of the allergens on their packaged foods and they probably will not be very careful about cross contamination at restaurants. I would stick to the absolute plain basics: plain white rice, plain vegetables, fruit, and try to cook on your own.",

Unfortunately, Japanese don\u2019t deal with food allergies frequently. They also want to \u201csave face\u201d and be polite, so they will pretend something is GF when really they might have no idea. It was a challenging trip and despite it being a wonderful country and culture, I wouldn\u2019t go back. The food part made it too difficult for me to enjoy myself.",

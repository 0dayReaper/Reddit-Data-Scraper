    "postText": "Hello!\n\nMy parents and I are going to Japan in about 2-3 years and my Mum is a wheelchair user. She is able to walk short distances and go up and down stairs with the help of my Dad. Her wheelchair is also foldable so it can be flat. \n\nI was wondering if there were any tips or things that we should know and take into account before and after we leave. I\u2019m looking for general things like how walking throughout the city will go, public transport, restaurants, museums etc. Is there anything that we should avoid or try to aim for?\n\nI am also learning Japanese (my parents aren\u2019t very good at it \ud83d\ude05) so what phrases or words would be useful to know?\n\nIf you have any questions please let me know!\nThanks :)\n\nEDIT: My Mum\u2019s wheelchair is electric so we don\u2019t have to push her and it\u2019s still quite a small wheelchair.",

                            "comment": "Uh, I have some bad news. I\u2019m a wheelchair user and just returned from the most recent of several month-long trips. It\u2019s not anywhere near as easy as people here have made it out to be.\n\nEven just getting inside the stations can be a task. There\u2019s usually only one elevator down to the concourse per side of the station, and generally they aren\u2019t well marked. Sometimes they\u2019re freestanding, sometimes they\u2019re hidden underneath and on the back side of a set of stairs or escalator. The first time you find one, drop a pin on your map so you can always get back to it. \n\nAt every station you\u2019ll need to request a \u201cs\u016brop\u014d\u201d (wheelchair ramp) to board trains. So you need to be there several minutes before the train, in order to give them time. At rural unmanned stations this can\u2019t be done, so you need to plan around those (travel shorter and take a taxi). The gap is *dangerous* for wheelchairs otherwise. *Do not* attempt it without the slope, you could throw her completely out of her chair.\n\nFor Shinkansen, you need *at least* an hour early. You have to stand in the main line because, for some god-forsaken reason, they have to get approval to sell you a wheelchair ticket. We got in a hurry to make the last train one day, and I  bypassed this process *exactly once* and never again. I literally couldn\u2019t get out of the loading area because the doors on both sides were too narrow.\n\nOnce you do that, you\u2019ll go to the JR booth by the ticket gates, and tell them you need a slope. They get a bit irritated if you give them less than 30 minutes notice, as 30-minutes warning is the JR requirement. \n\nRemember what I said about lifts and how they\u2019re hard to find to get into the station itself? This goes double once you\u2019re inside the station. Most stations have lifts, but they generally only go 1 floor. And they\u2019re *never* right next to each other, they\u2019re always across the station. You\u2019ll usually take 2-3 elevators to get where you\u2019re going, but going from the entrance of my station to the platform for NEX took **seven** individual elevators. Of course none of them are near each other, so you have to walk forever to get from one to the other, frequently reversing directions between them. They\u2019re also hidden in corners, and not always well marked.\n\nIn Tokyo Station, there\u2019s at least one transfer with no lift. Instead, the escalator converts to carry the chair. It\u2019s cool as hell, but you have to figure it out, find the call box, and just repeat \u201cKurumaisu desu\u201d\n\nOutside of the main stations the ticket stalls aren\u2019t always manned. You can only get the wheelchair through one, and you\u2019ll have to hit a call button, show them your ticket, and they\u2019ll open it. This is also where you request a slope at this type of station.\n\nTrain platforms never have more than one elevator, and it\u2019s at the far end. That means if you get off the middle of the train, sometimes there won\u2019t be visible signage and you\u2019ll have to guess, 50% of the time walking all the way back to the opposite end.\n\nThe *good* news is that once you have the slope at the first station, they radio ahead. Someone will be waiting at your stop to help you get off the train, and will walk you to your transfer train if you have one. \n\nDo not travel during peak travel times. There is not enough room for a wheelchair, but they will feel obligated to accommodate it. Sometimes people will get off trains to make this happen. Do not do this, it significantly inconveniences a lot of people. Go earlier or later.\n\nUse the luggage forwarding services from your hotel. Just suck up the $30-90 and do it, it will make moving around the city so much easier with her.\n\n\n**And that\u2019s just for dealing with the train stations.**  \n  \n________\nA few other things off the top of my head. I plan to write a long post in the coming week or two detailing all of the difficulties.\n\nAPA hotel rooms are not wide enough to get a wheelchair inside. They say accessible, but in some the door wasn\u2019t wide enough (my chair is *small*) to get through. One I got inside, but couldn\u2019t get past the bathroom. \n\nYou\u2019ll find similar issues other places. We stayed at a guest house with tatami floors, and my wheelchair wasn\u2019t allowed inside. We had to leave it in a stairwell every night. We stayed at a ryokan where I had to use *their* wheelchair inside the building. They loaded my wheelchair into the bus from the station, and I didn\u2019t see it again until the morning we left; I have no idea where it was.\n\nThe beds are just very firm. If she has issues with that, request extra blankets and lay them on top of the bed. Cheap hotels are the worst, but we stayed at Keio Plaza for our last week in Tokyo thinking they would be better. Do you remember those tempurpedic commercials where they put a glass of wine on one side of the bed, and then someone jumped on the far side and it didn\u2019t spill? We accidentally did this with my wife\u2019s drink and a full bowl of curry. I got out of the bed, then back into the bed, right next to it and none of it sloshed around \u2014 the mattress had *that little* give. Just slightly better than plywood when we were both in the bed.\n\nMany places are inaccessible outside of the city. Shrines, while technically accessible, may be at the end of a long, uphill climb. Or they make be at the end of 50m of loose gravel. Once you get there, there will be steps up to the shoe-free area, often without a ramp. She won\u2019t be allowed on tatami, so some places are just out. They may insist that you clean the tires before her chair is allowed in.\n\nMuch of the shopping is not accessible at all. On Kappabashi street most of the stores aren\u2019t navigable in a chair. The main drag in Harajuku is about 50/50. The Nishiki market is one of my favorite places, but it will take you forever to navigate through the best part, and a decent amount of shouting \u201cSumimasen!\u201d Shopping inside malls *is* generally accessible.\n\nLots of people will try to help, and they\u2019ll be embarrassed if they can\u2019t make things work (ie shop is too small to get inside, no matter what). They\u2019ll even significantly inconvenience themselves sometimes (getting off of packed trains, etc.) be aware of this, and try not to lean on it too hard.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate how far you\u2019ll have to walk. We had relatively relaxed schedule, and still walked 45km per week. You\u2019ll be pushing her, so just take that into account. Lots and lots of hills.\n\n\n\n________  \n  \n\nThere\u2019s just so much more, but you\u2019ll have an advantage because she can walk short distances. Don\u2019t use that for the trains, but it will be helpful in hotels.\n\nI\u2019ll try to ping you when I do my full write up, if I remember to.",

                                            "comment": "Oh lord, a power chair. It\u2019s a power wheelchair, and not a scooter? How heavy is it, and how small does it fold? Is the power built into \u201cnormal\u201d sized wheelchair pushpins, or is is an actual powerchair? Powered wheelchairs add a whole bunch of new problems \u2014 and triple all of it if you can\u2019t carry the chair. \n\nJapan\u2019s accessibility is built around the type of wheelchairs they use. Japan\u2019s power chairs are not like those in west. They take a normal manual wheelchair and retrofit it with the electric parts to turn it into a powerchair. This makes them smaller overall than western powerchairs, but it also means that they can be disassembled to be much smaller, and gives them a very tight turn radius. The nicest consumer powerchairs here can compete with them on turn radius, but many cannot.\n\nSince some stations don\u2019t have elevators, if you arrive at one you may not be able to carry that chair up the stairs for her if it\u2019s too heavy. Generally speaking, taxis are unlikely to be able to transport it. My manual wheelchair only barely fit in the trunk of every taxi I took \u2014 often to the point that they had to leave the trunk open. I suspect the electric chair, even once disassembled, won\u2019t fit. The ones with escalators that convert instead of a lift likely will not support the length of a scooter.\n\nI also didn\u2019t see a single actually accessible taxi my entire trip. I bet you could get one in Tokyo with some help, but I never saw one.\n\nMany hotels, even those large enough for a manual chair, won\u2019t support the turn radius of a scooter.\n\nThat goes for buses, too. Depending on how large the chair is, you might not be able to make the turn to get on the bus and pay.\n\nHow frequently has she flown with her chair? Just want to make sure that you know the airlines routinely break them, and if the plane is full the chance of that goes up. In half a dozen round-trip flights I\u2019ve had two chairs replaced by the airlines because they *destroyed* mine while transporting it. The first time, they literally dropped my powerchair out of the luggage bay of a 747. The most recent one was May 2022, and I\u2019m still waiting for the replacement chair. If it happens to you, the airline will likely provide some sort of temporary chair but make sure that you have *some sort* of contingency plan for that. Travel Insurance is a decent place to start, because you\u2019ll lose a day or two to the rental process, you\u2019ll need your own translator, and so on.\n\nI\u2019d consider sending someone to scout the locations, or check it all out with Street View beforehand, to ensure they are accessible. A couple of times we spent a good amount of time traveling, only to find something that was an absolute barrier to me. \n\nMost of the same things can be done, but a power chair definitely makes parts more difficult. Scooters are even more difficult than that, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d personally try to travel with a scooter.\n\nI\u2019m glad it was helpful. I hope when I finish writing the whole guide it will be equally useful!",

Many people with luggage queue for the elevator and if you are unlucky it will take you fifteen minutes to get to the platform. \n\nSidewalks and pedestrian cross are fine. Just the big streets with a pedestrian under or overpass are annoying as again the will only be one elevator somewhere. \n\nAll venues have wheelchair friendly restrooms. \n\nHave a good trip",

            "comment": "You use the wheelchair accessible option in Google maps to make it (a bit) easier to find the elevators for your in train/subway stations. This will limit the number of stairs a bit.\n\n- [Tokyo Now Has Wheelchair Accessible Routes in Google Maps](https://www.accessible-japan.com/tokyo-now-has-wheelchair-accessible-routes-in-google-maps/)\n- [Basic Guide to Accessible Travel in Japan](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2301.html)\n- [Accessible Japan](https://www.accessible-japan.com)\n\nWhen booking Shinkansen seats you\u2019ll need to book a seat in the last row so you can fold up the wheelchair and store it behind the seats.  The same space where large luggage goes.  \n\nYou could choose a day in each city where you utilize the hop-on hop-off bus tours.  Not all of these are back up running yet as they closed during Covid but if they\u2019re running could be good for a bit less walking while getting a broad overview of the city.  Then, the other days, you can visit specific areas/neighborhoods you want yo explore more.  \n\n- [Sky Hop Bus (Tokyo and Kyoto)](https://skyhopbus.com)\n- [Tokyo Sightseeing Cruises](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/things-to-do/best-water-activities-in-tokyo)\n- [Osaka Sightseeing Bus Tours](https://livejapan.com/en/in-kansai/in-pref-osaka/in-umeda_osaka-station_kitashinchi/article-a2000475/)\n- [Osaka Water Sightseeing Cruises](https://digjapan.travel/en/blog/id=11961)\n\nSimilarly there are sightseeing taxis you can reserve too. Or just take a regular taxi from time to time.  Taxis are particularly helpful in Kyoto. For example, Kinkakuji is in kind of an out of the way/inconvenient spot.  So it\u2019s easier to take a taxi there and not too expensive for the time/hassle you save.  There are taxis everywhere in Kyoto and they can be much more comfortable than the (often very) crowded buses.  There are wheelchair accessible but it\u2019s usually easier if you can just fold up the wheelchair and put it in the trunk.  \n\n- [Hinomaru Sightseeing Taxi Tokyo](https://hinomaru.tokyo/kanko?locale=en)\n- [Catching a Taxi in Tokyo (can get $$$ depending on where you\u2019re going to.

Even skinny people have to squeeze into seats between tables and worry about bumping into the people/table next to them.  So be prepared for some close quarters and that not all restaurants may be wheelchair accessible.  If you can fold up and leave the wheelchair at the front of the restaurant and she can walk in that will open up more options.  However, the top floors of department stores have an array of nice, sit down restaurants and it can be nice to take the elevator up and wander through to choose which one you want to eat at in the A/C.  The seating/tables in these is usually a bit more spacious/wheelchair accessible. In the basements of department stores are nice, take away food halls so if you\u2019re very tired and just want to relax in your hotel room you can pick up food to take back for dinner.  There are also more food halls that have been opening where you can try multiple types of food and these usually have more/bigger tables too. \n\n- [JapanGuide: Department Stores](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2072.html)\n- [Department stores](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2020/10/baby-tokyo-department-stores-take-your-children/ )\n- [Tokyo Depachika (Department Store Food Halls)](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/shopping/best-depachika-food-halls-in-tokyo)\n- [Asakusa Food Hall Inspired by Japan Festivals in Tokyo](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/asakusa-is-getting-a-new-matsuri-themed-yokocho-food-hall-060822)\n- [New Yokocho Food Hall in Shinjuku, Tokyo](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/shinjuku-has-a-new-yokocho-food-hall-with-17-eateries-110122)\n- [8 Other Food Halls in Tokyo](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/restaurants/best-restaurant-food-halls-in-tokyo)\n- [Kyoto: Daimaru Dept Store Restaurant Floor](https://www.insidekyoto.com/daimaru-resutoran-gai)\n- [Kyoto Station: CUBE Food Court](https://www.insidekyoto.com/the-cube-food-court-kyoto)\n- [Kyoto Tower Food Hall](https://www.kyoto-tower-sando.jp/s/en/shop/floor/top)\n- [Kyoto Ramen Kyoji Street](https://www.kyoto-ramen-koji.com/english/)\n\nFinally, consider the size of your hotel rooms; particularly the bathrooms.   I\u2019d stay away from the cheapest [budget hotel chains](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0001458/) in Japan as they often have very small unit baths where the size will make it uncomfortable to shower/bathe.  Chains like Candeo, Mitsui Gatden, Daiwa Roynet, and Hotel MyStays tend to have larger rooms and larger bathrooms.  There are some wheelchairs accessible rooms but they are quite limited. If she can easily walk around the hotel room and use the bathroom without her chair you\u2019ll have more options. After walking 10 miles a day you\u2019ll want/need to be able to take a long hot shower/bath to relax your muscles before bed. So pay close attention to the bathroom photos on sites like Booking.com and avoid lodging that has [the small unit baths.](https://resources.realestate.co.jp/living/japanese-apartment-bathrooms-explained/)\n\nHope these suggestions help.",

You do however mention that your mother can walk short stints if helped so I\u2019m sure you guys will be fine. \nEnjoy your trip and welcome to Japan. \n\nEDIT: stay as far away as you can from rush hour tho. Wheelchair, blind, no arms, the salarymen wont give a fuck. In Japan it\u2019s work first so don\u2019t mess with a salaryman and his commute.",

            "comment": "Went to Japan in January with my mother who is in a chair. Tokyo as far as I experienced is almost entirely adapted for wheelchair users in most of the tourist areas the only trouble location I can think of off the top of my head is Akihabara and Nakano broadway as the stores there tend to be very small and as such difficult for a wheelchair user to navigate. The imperial palace can be difficult to push around due to the gravelled paths but it is doable. Public transport the trains are brilliant they are essentially roll on roll off and the accessible carriages with wheelchair spaces are marked on the platform for where they will stop. The disabled restrooms at stations and large malls are fantastic very spacious with lots of aids also for peace of mind there are emergency call strips at floor height as well can\u2019t speak much for smaller ones as didn\u2019t use any. As for phrases make sure you know Sumimasen! As you will have to ask to move past people some times also learn how to say \u201cmy mothers condition is x\u201d incase of any medical emergencies if it\u2019s relevant",

I would\u2019ve loved to bring him here because he would have had access to so many places. \n\nSo awesome you\u2019re bringing your folks here! It\u2019s a wonderful place.",

It was bearable as trains have specific sections for wheelchair users, there are ramps or elevators everywhere. If you need to roll your mom inside a train, ask for help in the ticket gate so the train officer can set up a small ramp in between the platform gap and the train.\n\nSmall tip \u2014 avoid rush hour. Even if there are designated spots on the train, it will be difficult with the mass of people.",

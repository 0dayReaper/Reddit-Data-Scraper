It's more likely the OP accidentally dropped it somewhere, or had less than they thought, than a pickpocket in the peace museum lifted it and then ran the huge risk of putting the wallet back. Yes I know crime does happen in Japan, but on balance this one I'm not sure about.\n\nThat being said the OP is out a lot of money, so I'm sorry to hear that whatever way it happened.",

In the past I always paid by cash at convenience stores for example, but this time I paid by credit card pretty much everytime. That being said I still carried a good amount of cash on me, but the amount of times I withdrew money was a lot less than I used to.",

But I'd say it's about 60% accept/40% cash only. Hell, conbinis really only started all unilaterally accepting most major credit cards (and non-Japanese cards) in the last year. Many, many places \u2014 especially restaurants and non-chain shops \u2014 do not take cards. They might take Merpay or PayPay, but these aren't things tourists really have access to as non-residents without a Japanese bank account.",

Putting back the wallet after taking out the money adds nothing except risk.\n\nAlso in country like Japan, I really don't think it's that much money. I just came back from my trip and I frequently carried around much more. My bank charges for transactions in other currencies so using my bank pass or credit card everywhere is much more expensive, and you would still be suprised(atleast I was) how many places in Japan are still cash only. On top of that I always like paying in foreign currencies. Could be me but I always find it has \"something special\", lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just took out a big chunk, left a part of it at the hotel and split the rest between my wallet and my GF's wallet. But 15000yen is really not a lot if you visit some places, have breakfast, lunch and dinner and buy some souvenirs.",

I\u2018m sure that doesn\u2019t make you feel any better. Hopefully you\u2019ll be able to put it behind you and enjoy the rest of your vacation.\n\nYou could go to the police (actual station, not a koban) and make a report. They\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s nothing they can do and try their best to get you out of the door because Japanese police are literally useless but if you insist on making a report at least it\u2019s accounted for and there\u2019s a minuscule possibility you\u2019ll get it back. Kinda wastes precious vacation time though.\n\nOn a side note, I also had money stolen here once. Stupidly forgot my wallet on the top of my work locker, when I came back all but a 50 yen coin was taken. I only had 5550 yen in it because I\u2019m poor. Still, I couldn\u2019t stand the idea I was working with a thief and them been all chummy with me the next day so I ended up quitting.

All businesses know if they were over at the end of the day (and note the amount). \n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Museum costs \u00a5200. A snack at a small Soba restaurant wouldn't cost much, either. Do the math. You may have neglected to get your change, or just overpaid for something. You may be surprised at how honest people can be. If either place had the equivalent of $100+ *over* in their register that day, they would remember it. \n\nNot saying that pickpocketing doesn't exist, because it *does* but someone would have had to have been right next to you for more than a few seconds in order to pull this off. Yanking the entire wallet, yes. Grabbing the wallet, extracting funds, and nonchalantly replacing it without you knowing it translates into a master criminal. If they are *that* good, they should be robbing banks, not individuals.\n\nI found $175 neatly folded in a parking lot one day. No one else around. I'm sure the person was as vexed as you are now.

At one point on a train back from Yokohama I noticed a pocket was unzipped on my backpack, but nothing was missing or jumbled. I had a bad habit of getting something from my bag and forgetting to zip it all the way up again. Since I didn\u2019t have a purse with me, everything was thrown into my pack and I accessed it quite frequently. That said, as far as money goes, I always carried at least 20-30,000 in my wallet daily and never had any worries. One time I was putting my coin wallet away at a restaurant and a bunch of coins spilled out onto the floor(forgot to zip it, of course). Three random locals jumped up to help me collect them. I definitely do not experience that back home in the states. Here I almost never carry cash when traveling because it makes me feel more vulnerable in unfamiliar cities, and credit cards are accepted practically everywhere.",

Also the bump into move is less likely to work in that case as the pack is strapped tight. \n\nLeast risk is withdraw the minimum amount you need in 711 ATMs like 20K or 50K and carry that around in various areas on your person. There's the extra cost of withdrawing which can be expensive if you do it in small amounts but definitely not as bad as 100K lost.\n\nSorry that happened to you man.",

It can definitely happen, though it's rare, and no one believes me when I say it did, either. In my case, I know exactly where it happened and how/why: I was in a crowd at Fushimi Inari Taisha and I put \u00a52000 in the outside pocket of my purse before going into a crowd at the end of a row of torii. The pocket didn't zip, and someone in the crowd lifted it straight out; I didn't even feel it. \n\nIt's important to remember that crime happens everywhere, even \"safe\" places, and also you're not the only tourist there.

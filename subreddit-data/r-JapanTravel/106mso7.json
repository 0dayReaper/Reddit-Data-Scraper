If you're looking for anything previous to that, they are long sold out, and resold tickets will be invalid at the gates as these tickets are non-transferable as well. Ghibli Museum is also already sold out for the month of April, but you may be able to get tickets from the LAWSONS Machine on arrival in Japan - although this is NOT guaranteed. Please check the official link above for more information.**\n\nA further note that there is an entry Cap to Ghibli Park:\n\n&gt;Daily Entry Cap of Ghibli\u2019s Grand Warehouse is 3,500 visitors on weekdays and 4,000 on holidays and weekends.\n\n&gt;Daily Entry Cap of Hill of Youth is 780 people per weekday and 900 people per day on holidays and weekends.\n\n&gt;Daily Entry Cap of Dondoko Forest is 650 people per on weekday and 750 people per day on holidays and weekends.\n\nOverseas ticket sales are limited to entry of [Ghibli's Grand Warehouse only,](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/attractions/guide-to-ghibli-park-attractions-restaurants-shops-tickets-free-areas-and-more#:~:text=International%20ticket%20service,weekends%20and%20holidays.) other locations listed will not be made available to overseas purchasers until sometime in the future - currently there is no indication on when this will change.",

You had to buy them outside Japan. I rang my local JTB office and bought some. The big advantage of the JTB tickets was that you could choose your session time.",

And if so, was it an individual ticket though the Ghibli Museum [website](https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/tickets/)? I.e. not part of a JR rail pass package?\n\nI am not sure if I am being an idiot, but from some comments in this thread and from the Ghibli Museum website, it sounds like you can only buy tickets as part of an expensive travel package.\n\nIs that correct - Or can I still buy tickets overseas via \"LAWSON TICKET\" option, seeing as the \"JTB Group Overseas\" is unavailable?",

You should be able to buy your ticket through the Lawson option, keep in mind ticket sales open a month in advance of when you plan to go\u2014 that might be the reason why you don\u2019t see overseas tickets available.

The hardest part was the fact that the website could not handle the traffic. I had the website open in about three tabs just trying to get the schedule to load and add 2 tickets to the cart and check out. Meanwhile, my wife was on her laptop also trying to get the website to work. She ended up getting the tickets. I would say just keep your schedule flexible. Don't set yourself to one day as a MUST GO. That day may sell out and you will have to choose another. When that happened to me we just flipped the plans for the day that we got tickets for. Also, set an alarm, and be on the website when the tickets go live.\n\nI would also suggest trying to navigate the website on an open sale day that is before you are intending to buy if you are worried about navigating the website. It can be pretty jank, and if you are worried about it, a little experience and practice will help.",

But I know a lot of Americans who are used to the US parks like to do fine dining and big bucket list restaurants. The food and theming will likely be good and Oceano has the added benefit of getting you a view of the night time show if you get a dinner reservation at the right time.",

As soon as it hit 10am we refreshed the page and we got to select the day/time slot we wanted. I used my Mastercard 2x and it was flagged (because international card I\u2019m guessing) so I wasn\u2019t able to secure tickets :( it redirected me to the calendar and almost everything was sold out! luckily my bf clicked on the time slot @ the same time as I did but instead used his debit card and it went through!",

Everything was sold out on the English site for me, but it was basically empty on the Japanese Lawson site... you're a lifesaver!\n\n\\[ Note for future Ghibli'ers: I would probably have this (or at least a Japanese VPN) set up and ready to go just in case the English site doesn't work. I was struggling for an hour through constant crashes, juggling multiple tabs, being dumped on \"server too busy\" screens, only to not get it... There is a little headache with the cards, but Visa went through after doing a confirmation. Good luck! \\]",

First the website was crashed and when it finally worked all the time slots were with limited availability and every attempt to book a ticket was pointless as everything was sold out. We were awake 3am greek time to make sure we would manage to get our tickets. I even tried other sites with the guided visit which is more expensive but even this was sold out for April! Is there any way to get last minute tickets?",

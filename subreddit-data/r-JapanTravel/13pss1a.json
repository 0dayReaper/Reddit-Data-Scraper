    "postText": "Hi all\n\nMe (28m) and my fiance (32m) want to go to Japan! We're from Melbourne, Australia and want to travel for 3 weeks around the end of October into November. Planning is not my strong suit, and I grabbed chatGPTs help (don't judge).

A lot\n- we love food\n- I don't mind a mixture of cities and rural, but my partner would prefer cities\n- he doesn't want to go too many temples, so we are opting for the main ones (I like temples, so this is the compromise).\n\nI'll do two parts, the TLDR version, and the entire itinerary.\n\nTLDR \n\n**Day 1-5: Tokyo**\n  - Arrive and explore Tokyo.\n\n**Day 6-7: Hakone**\n  - Travel to Hakone, enjoy the hot springs and local attractions.\n\n**Day 8-11: Kyoto**\n  - Explore Kyoto and take a day trip to Nara.\n\n**Day 12-14: Hiroshima**\n  - Travel to Hiroshima and take a day trip to Miyajima.\n\n**Day 15-16: Okayama**\n  - Visit Okayama and take a day trip to Kurashiki.\n\n**Day 17-19: Osaka**\n  - Experience Osaka, including a day at Universal Studios Japan.\n\n**Day 20-21: Tokyo**\n  - Return to Tokyo for final sightseeing and depart for home.\n\n--------\n\nLong version\n\n**Day 1-5: Tokyo**\n\n- **Day 1:** \n  - Morning: Arrival in Tokyo, check into your hotel.\n  - Afternoon: Explore your local surroundings and familiarize yourself with Tokyo's public transport system.\n  - Evening: Casual stroll around your hotel area, have dinner in a local restaurant.\n\n- **Day 2: Akihabara**\n  - Morning: Visit a Pok\u00e9mon Center and the Akihabara Radio Kaikan for trading cards and merchandise.\n  - Afternoon: Visit an arcade, such as the SEGA Akihabara Building, followed by shopping for video games, manga, and anime merchandise in the various shops in Akihabara.\n  - Evening: Dine in a local restaurant and try some of Akihabara's maid cafes if you're interested.\n\n- **Day 3: Shibuya**\n  - Morning: Visit the Meiji Shrine.

If everyone starts doing this we will be looking at the same copy-paste itineraries being posted here constantly. And sure, when I read this itinerary I see a lot of things that make sense and human made itineraries might not be too different from this one. But when I read a sentence like: \"visit a maid cafe if you're interested\" I just cringe.",

I literally just said I'm not good at planning these things so I used tools to assist in getting a general idea of what might be good. If you don't like what you're reading, then don't comment. It's that easy.",

But when people copy and paste and itinerary from ChatGPT and then ask me to finetune it, that just feels off. I know in your personal situation you may feel like you had a solid reason to do so, but that doesn't really change anything from my end of the deal. If you feel you are really bad at making itineraries, just post what you can make up by yourself and ask other users to help you improve it. I appreciate that more than what you did. Sorry to single you out like this btw, you are the first person I see doing this and it struck a nerve. But am I wrong for assuming we will be seeing a lot more of this stuff? And yes, I could look the other way. But looking away is too easy and it ignores the bigger issue that I just adressed. Have a good day and a good trip to Japan and if you come up with a self made plan I will be more than happy to help you out!",

If you're really into Pokemon, a quick google shows up more than just the stores. https://thesmartlocal.com/read/pokemon-things-to-do-japan/\n\nI'd suggest putting a bit more effort into your search based on your own interests; Japan has something for almost any niche. \n\nThe other thing ChatGPT doesn't do well is keep up to date with specific details. The Sega arcade and Palette town have been closed for quite a while now.",

You may as well peek inside since you\u2019re there for the Gundam but it\u2019s really boring as a mall.\n\nConsider the Hilton Odaiba\u2019s restaurants for the most beautiful bay views around.",

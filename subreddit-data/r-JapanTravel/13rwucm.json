It is really lovely - smaller than Kyoto (about 400k people) but with the restaurants and shops and attractions of a much larger city because it is apparently a biggish destination for Japanese tourists. Large parts of town are original like the Nagamachi samurai district and Higashi Chaya, and the whole town is quite beautiful. Some lovely restaurants (I particularly recommend ENSO), a really good fish market, a few very good cocktail bars, a great modern art museum, and Kenrokuen, which is one of the three Great Gardens of Japan.",

Kurashiki in Okayama is beautiful with its canals, and it's along the shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima.",

Nikko National Park has some good historical stuff, but OkuNikko is up in the mountains and looks gorgeous. Suggest you give it a look.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if your timing will work in Kyoto, but there's a festival on October 22 known as the \"Jidai Matsuri\" or Festival of the Ages. It's a historical procession going back in time with lots of costumes and figures from Japanese history and folklore.",

I dont know. I might recommend you do not miss higashiyama, especially kiyomizudera, and the area leading up to it, and maybe also a little of gion and yasaka when it gets late, i.e. after 6-7pm. its missing from your plan so far. and I understand, limited time. all that. but maybe thats more valuable than walking a lot down the philosophers park and seeing the imperial palace...\n\nyour other osaka, hiroshima, nara days look okay to me\n\none other thing to take into account, it will be fall foliage in that time, and temples/shrines will be starting to be open into the evenings. I would certainly keep my eyes open, that way you might be able to not only see some spectacular sights, but also, enjoy one more  POI in the evening that would otherwise be closed after 5pm",

If you are staying this long then its nice to pack in some entertainment. Personally I really enjoyed Noh, though it is not everyones cup of tea.\n\nAnother recommendation is the Kadokawa Musashi Museum.

Too many people think they can spend 30 minutes at each spot and take the metro to another site. In reality transportation takes time and each neighborhood has a lot to see.\n\nI would like to tell you that the transportation in Hakone is slow, especially compared to Tokyo. There are not many frequent buses and trains, for example the express bus from Hakone Yumoto to lake Ashi only has two services around 10 and 11 am. Everything moves slower and slows down after 5pm. Although it is really very pretty. \n\nAnother thing, if you plan to see Mt Fuji have as many opportunities to try as you can. We tried Tokyo Metro bldg, Skytree, hakone 2 days and Shinkansen. We only saw it on the second day at Hakone (just the summit) and fully clear on the Shinkansen.\n\nAnother comment recommended Shimokitazawa, we did it and really liked it, try to go on a Friday or Saturday afternoon for the maximum experience.\n\nEnjoy your trip!",

But the HFP with transportation from Shinjuku (Odakyu) to Hakone Yumoto/Odawara.\n\nNow, if you do the second one there are two more options:\n\n1. Go from Shinjuku to Hakone on a regular Odakyu train.\n2. Ride a limited express train called the romancecar, reserved seats only and faster.\n\nIf you're doing the romancecar you have to additionally buy a limited express ticket (basically a seat reservation, tickets go on sale 1 month before at 10am JST). There are multiple versions of the romancecar but consider the GSE. Note that you could also take a Shinkansen from Tokyo sta. to Odawara for day 1, but I think it's overkill.\n\nSo if you want to take a Shinkansen from Odawara to Kyoto you would need to buy the HFP without the Shinjuku transportation and buy the first leg (regular or romancecar) separately, one way only. Then use the HFP to get to Odawara on the second day and take your Shinkansen there.\n\nWe did the romancecar both ways. It was Shinjuku-Hakone Yumoto on day 1, then backwards on day two. We decided on going back to Shinjuku to stay the night and then take the Shinkansen early in the morning from Tokyo station, because we could get a Hikari train instead of Kodama and we needed to activate the JR pass on that morning in order to use it later on. Basically it lined up with our needs, but you whatever fits your trip. \n\nI hope I didn't confuse you, it's kind of tricky to get your head around some of the processes in Japan but if you have more doubts about the HFP I would gladly help you.",

You can find cheaper restaurants in Fukuoka than Yatai!\n\nIf you were going to *stay* in Fukuoka I would definitely recommend doing a few day trips elsewhere in Kyushu, like Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Beppu (if you like onsen) and so on, but given how tight your schedule is I doubt that will be possible on this trip. My view on Fukuoka is that like Osaka, it\u2019s more of a place to see in the evening (nightlife, food, drinks, etc.) than in the daytime, and that it\u2019s best experienced as a base from which to explore the rest of Kyushu than as a destination in and of itself.",

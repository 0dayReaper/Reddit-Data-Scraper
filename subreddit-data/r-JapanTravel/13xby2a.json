    "postText": "I found lurking on this forum really useful for planning our trip, so thought I'd return the favour by posting about our trip here - with some extra tips for travelling as vegan or vegetarian! We just got back a few days ago and I'm already itching to go again. I think our interests generally align with what many people want when they go to Japan - nerdy stuff, food, temples and pretty locations. I hope the below is useful to someone, and happy to answer any questions (whether on food or just something we visited!).\n\n**\\*\\*General tips:\\*\\***\n\n***1) Learn some basic Japanese:*** I've seen this one come up quite a few times and can only echo it - while there certainly are Japanese people with excellent English skills, it will smooth the way so much more if you learn to speak some Japanese. Any attempts at Japanese were always met with a much friendlier response than tourists we saw speaking English, and it was especially helpful in the two ryokans we stayed at, where we had much more conversation with our hosts and they seemed much more comfortable communicating in Japanese (also we got some free apple jam!). Personally I taught myself from the basics because I had time/that's how my brain works (hiragana, katakana, then learning vocab + grammar) - but learning some modular phrases will help, e.g. '\\_\\_\\_\\_ doko desu ka?' (where is \\_\\_\\_\\_?), '\\_\\_\\_\\_ arimasu ka?' (is there \\_\\_\\_\\_?), and 'kore wa hitotsu/futatsu/mittsu o kudasai' (one/two/three of this please).\n\n***2) For dietary requirements, do your research and book in advance:*** There are quite a few helpful guides online for vegan diets, including the IG account 'tokyoveganguide', the website 'isitveganjapan' ([https://isitveganjapan.com/food-on-the-go/507-2/](https://isitveganjapan.com/food-on-the-go/507-2/)), Vegewel ([https://vegewel.com/en/area/](https://vegewel.com/en/area/)) and some articles on matcha-jp ([https://matcha-jp.com/en/7716](https://matcha-jp.com/en/7716)). We ate really well while out and about and could pick up certain street snacks - but again, being able to communicate in Japanese helped a lot here (see tip 1). As you probably know, vegan diets aren't well understood in Japan, and they're often shocked to find out you won't eat fish OR fish-based dashi. I've mentioned some of the standout places we ate at below. At conbini/kiosks, plain rice and salted onigiri, as well as the salted ume (plum) onigiri are typically vegan. Mochi are also often a good bet, as are jelly sweets (tend to use agar rather than gelatin). It can be helpful to know the kanji for fish (\u9b5a), meat (\u8089) and eggs (\u5375). Milk products are often listed in katakana as cream (\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0) or similar, but could be listed as cow's milk (\u725b\u4e73). Translate apps can be helpful but it's about 50/50 helpful versus 'hilarious result'.\n\n***3) As a vegan, don't expect your western-style hotel to provide breakfast (but a ryokan will!):*** We generally found that big western style hotels just.. did not provide anything viable for breakfast. You might have been able to negotiate a bowl of plain rice and a piece of fruit, but ultimately we ended up eating breakfast elsewhere (but see tip 4!) and in the future I wouldn't bother opting in for breakfast unless I could verify with the hotel in advance that they had options. However, ryokans were very accommodating so long as you communicated with them in advance, and the two we stayed at provided a list of dietary requirements at the start of our stay that we could tick to indicate what we could eat.\n\n***4) Most coffee shops/food places won't open until 10am:*** It was a bit of a struggle to find places open early enough for us to have breakfast before heading out. We did bring a few cereal bars for this eventuality! But if you research you can find a few places that open at 7am (in Tokyo we went to Komeda Is in Ginza, in Kyoto, the IMU hotel).\n\n***5) Always have some cash:*** We didn't need a phenomenal amount of cash on our trip, although we were also not skimping on spending (we took out 70,000 yen, or about \u00a3400, and that was about right) - many taxis, shops and restaurants took cards if needed. However, cash-only purchases did pop up unexpectedly - for example, in one of our very nice upmarket hotels that 100% had a card reader, sending our luggage by takkyubin for some reason was a cash-only purchase. A lot of smaller shops and little cafes will take cash only. If you want to use a card, you can check at the till with the phrase \"caa-do wa ii desu ka?\" (is card ok?).\n\n***6) Be prepared to walk:*** I know this one is said a lot - it depends what you're used to. We did in the range of 15-30,000 steps a day, and I was fine with a pair of foldable ballet flats and a pair of Vans. However we did bring blister plasters and a blister stick just in case! We also found lots of fun little shops/places by simply walking instead of taking transport, so if you have time it's highly recommended. As you will see below, we broke up the two major destinations (Tokyo/Kyoto) with smaller, slower-paced places. That helped a lot!\n\n***7) Build in extra time for navigating public transport:*** Yea, you probably think you're used to big transit systems - we certainly did. However it's just not always clear which exit you want to get to or how to get there, especially if you're not familiar with the station and surrounding area. Whenever we were pressed for time (for example, when transferring to shinkansen or needing to grab snacks before getting a train) we looked up a map of the station first to plan our route. You probably already know this, but I promise you are NOT ready for Shinjuku station.\n\n***8) If you're worried about temple fatigue, collect goshuin:*** This has been written about extensively elsewhere although I'm happy to share my experiences. Goshuin are a stamp/calligraphy combination you can get at many temples and shrines. They're a very beautiful memento. You need a special accordion-style book (goshuincho) for them that you can buy in advance (I did) or at your first temple (usually 1200-2000 yen). Collecting a goshuin usually costs 300-500 yen and a couple of minutes of your time. You should only collect a goshuin after paying your respects at the temple. Generally the process is just to approach the desk (it's generally quite obvious, and there may be pictures of goshuin on the window of the booth - in some places you choose which one you want), and present your book with both hands, open to the relevant page, asking 'goshuin o onegaishimasu'. They might take your book and give you a number (in which case, you need to wait), or they might do the goshuin then and there - it depends on how busy the temple is.\n\n***9) You probably won't be able to check-n early:*** Of all the places we stayed, only one allowed us to check in before 3pm. However, you should be able to leave any bags with them - just be prepared! If you want to drop off your bags, you can say the following: \"Nimotsu o azukatte mo ii desu ka?\" (more or less: May we leave our luggage here?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Brief trip report:\\*\\***\n\n*Day 0:* We got our flight to Tokyo (14h). We flew Japan Airlines - the vegan meals were.. ok? But the snack was the infamous (iykyk) banana. Everyone else got an interesting snack, so it was sad to just have a banana. I would pack my own snacks next time!\n\n*Day 1:* Land in Tokyo. Staying in the Ginza area. We got in to the airport relatively late (6pm) so we grabbed a snack locally once we got to our hotel (2foods Ginza) and went to sleep!\n\n*Day 2 Tokyo (\\~26,000 steps).* Breakfast at Komeda Is, Ginza. **Kokyo Gaien National Gardens** (near to our hotel), then walk around the **Yanaka** Old District, bought some tea/crackers (often vegan but check), train to **Asauksa** to see Senso-Ji (there happened to be a festival on while we were there so it was packed, but I got a special goshuin!), then across to **Akihabara**. It started raining but was mostly ok as we were running from indoor shop to indoor shop. We had lunch at a shojin-ryori place in Akihabara station. In the evening we went on a **vegan ramen tasting tour** (highly recommended!) in Shibuya/Shinjuku.\n\n*Day 3 Tokyo (\\~25,000 steps).* Breakfast at Komeda Is, Ginza. Then to **Team Labs Planets** (we had tickets for the earliest entry). Despite some of what I've read on here, we really enjoyed the experience (happy to say more if asked!). Then we headed across to **Shibuya**, wandered around, went to the Pokemon Centre and Nintendo store in Shibuya Parco, had lunch at Izakaya Masaka in the basement of Shibuya Parco (highly recommended) and headed over to Yoyogi Park, Meiji Jingu and walked up through **Harajuku**. We continued walking up through to **Shinjuku** and walked around there for a while, including going up the Tokyo Government Metropolitan building (free) for a view over Tokyo. We had dinner at Wired Bonbon.\n\n*Day 4 Yudanaka (\\~12,000 steps).* We sent our bags via takkyubin to Kyoto, and then got the train over to **Yudanaka** (we had breakfast at Komeda Is again - honestly, great menu! and picked up onigiri in the train station for the train ride). At Yudanaka, we travelled over to the Snow Monkey Park, and then back to our ryokan to chill in the bookable private onsen. Our feet needed the rest! We stayed at Seifuso in Yudanaka, which was lovely and inexpensive - our host drove us over to the park (we got a bus back). The food was excellent.\n\n*Day 5 Nagano and Hida Furukawa (\\~11,000 steps).* We travelled from Yudanaka through to Hida Furukawa, stopping off at **Nagano** on the way to visit the Zenko-Ji temple. For lunch we picked up oyaki from Irohado in Nagano, which were delicious (there are 3 shops - one in the station, one in a mall outside the station, and one by the temple)! By the time we got to **Hida Furukawa** it was relatively late, so we just had dinner. We stayed at one of the Iori Stay apartments, which provide dinner/breakfast (vegan if specified in advance).\n\n*Day 6 Hida Furukawa and Takayama (\\~15,000 steps).* We went to **Takayama** in the morning to visit the markets and see a few temples, as well as pick up some traditional sashiko for my mother-in-law. Then in the afternoon we chilled and walked around **Hida Furukawa** (shrines, shops and so on) - we had lunch at Sobasho Nakaya in Hida Furukawa, which has clearly marked vegan options. A number of other traditional soba shops have vegan options. There was a little sweet shop near the main street with the koi carp that sold yam-based mochi-type sweets and had a full list of ingredients you could look at.\n\n*Day 7 Kyoto (\\~20,000 steps).* We arrived in **Kyoto** at about 1pm (picked up onigiri and snacks on the journey), and walked from our hotel (located on Shijo Dori) to Nijo Castle and then to the Imperial Palace gardens. We had dinner in AWOMB Nishikiyamachi, which was excellent (sushi).\n\n*Day 8 Kyoto (\\~30,000 steps).* For breakfast today we found out our hotel couldn't accommodate our diet (whoops) and we ate cereal bars and mochi from the nearby Life supermarket. We mostly stayed around the **Gion area** this day and visited a lot of the temples and shrines there - Yasaka Jinja, Kyomizyu-dera, Kodai-Ji (picked up some dango here), Kennin-Ji and others. There is a little bamboo forest at Kennin-Ji which is much quieter than Arashiyama and in my opinion, nicer. We ate lunch at Uno Yukiko (vegan and gluten-free ramen). We also went to the Pokemon Centre in Kyoto! In the evening we ate dinner at the IMU Hotel (you had to book via instagram), and then headed over to **Fushimi Inari** at night. It was very quiet and highly recommended. We walked up to the first viewing point where you can see across Kyoto (my phone registered this as about 40 floors).\n\n*Day 9 Kyoto (\\~25,000 steps)*. For breakfast we headed over to the IMU hotel who alternate Japanese/Western breakfast by day. It was only 1000 yen, and really good. In the morning we headed to **Arashiyama**, and did the usual - the bridge, the bamboo forest (it was fine, very busy even early on) - and had matcha shaved ice with mochi for lunch nearby. Very healthy..! In the early afternoon we had a **calligraphy class**. After that, we went to **Kinkakuji**, then slowly walked across to the Kyoto Imperial gardens, stopping off at shops and for coffee on the way. We had dinner at Kanga-An - our most expensive meal, but delicious. You have to book in advance.\n\n*Day 10 Hakone (\\~12,000 steps).* We sent our bags by takkyubin to Tokyo. We had breakfast at the IMU hotel and then travelled over to **Hakone**. It was not a clear day but we saw about 2/3 of Mt Fuji out of the window (you need to be in seats D/E on the shinkansen). Based on conditions we decided not to go down to Lake Ashi. We went to the **Open-Air museum** which was honestly a lot of fun, then hung out in our amazing ryokan (Fukuzumiro).  We had our own private onsen and I wish we had spent another night here! It was not a cheap stay but it was wonderful.\n\n*Day 11 Tokyo (\\~23,000 steps).* We arrived in **Tokyo** at about 11am, and went to our hotel to drop off our backpacks - and were able to check in early! To note, this is the only time we could ever check in before 3pm, although we could always drop off our bags. We were in **Ginza** again, and had lunch at Ain Soph Ginza (expensive compared to everywhere else, but tasty - you must book, it's very small). We visited a little shrine and then walked to **Hamarikyu gardens** were we had matcha and wagashi in the tea house. Then we walked down to the **Tokyo Tower/Zojo-Ji** to have a look around. Finally we headed back to Shibuya to wrap up any shopping and sightseeing, have dinner at Izakaya Masaka (so good we went twice!) and then did a little karaoke at Joysound by the station - a great end to our trip. On our way back we stopped off at Don Quijote Ginza for any final bits.\n\n*Day 12 Fly home.* Because of changes to flight paths, our **flight home** ended up being much earlier than it was when we originally booked (moved to 9am). So we couldn't do anything that day but go to the airport. We flew with Japan Airlines \\[edit - from Tokyo Haneda airport\\] and everyone can go into the Sakura Lounge who flies with them as long as you don't have a discounted fare - nice and quiet, with a few limited vegan options for food (pasta). The vegan meals on the flight back were much better than the flight there - our snack on the way back was a sandwich, much better than a banana!",

                    "comment": "Of course! It varied by place but I'll list by restaurant/caf\u00e9 that I can remember below - let me know if you want any other details :) :  \n\n\n**Tokyo**  \n*Komeda Is (fully plant-based):* We went here for breakfast 3 times (I know, lol). They do a 'coffee service', where you can order a coffee and you get this delicious thick toast, which you can have with soy-based butter, jam, azuki paste, etc. In addition to that, we also tried a 'shiro noir' (basically a sort of cronut thing) and their pancakes, which were great!  \n*Komaki Syokudo (fully plant-based):* A shojin ryori place in Akihabara station, we went here for lunch once. We had a set meal here of rice, karaage-type soymeat balls, pickles, miso soup, tea.  \n*Vegan ramen tasting tour:* We did this as our dinner one night - it was with Frank Streigl (owner of the 5am ramen blog) and we had.. well, ramen! I'd highly recommend the tour, not that pricey and Frank eats a lot of ramen and is also very nerdy so easy for us to talk to!  \n*Izakaya Masaka (fully plant-based):* We ate one lunch and one dinner here. Lunch was a choice of set meals, we had karaage with gyoza, rice and miso. Dinner you could order anything - we had tofu noodles, karaage (it was good!), some sort of riff on mapo tofu, and this really good smoky mac n cheese dish.  \n*Wired BonBon (not fully plant-based but some vegan main dishes and all vegan desserts):* we each had a parfait here - I had a matcha and azuki bean one, my partner had a banana and strawberry one. Very tasty and also pretty!   \n*Ain Soph (fully plant-based):* We had the pancakes here for lunch - quite pricey but I can't deny, they were very tasty. Fluffy and bouncy, and served with some very fresh fruit. \n\n**Nagano**  \n*Irohado (all plant-based):* We had a range of their oyaki (little ..sort of.. filled parcels? just under palm-size) - some had spring onions, others sweet pumpkin, sweet red bean paste, pickles, mushrooms, mixed veg, so on.  \n\n\n**Yudanaka (ryokan food)**  \n*Seifuso (plant-based on request):* Dinner and breakfast were made up of lots of little dishes - tofu, yuba (tofu skin), rice, miso soup, pickles, potatoes, fruit, little hot pots that you cooked on the table, things like that.   \n\n\n**Hida Furukawa**  \n*Iori Stay:* Dinner and breakfast here were organised by our Iori Stay hosts (we stayed in Iori Kawanaka - it was amazing!) - and were similar to ryokan-type fare. On the first night we had tofu sukiyaki with other small dishes, and the second night more of a smoky tofu main. Breakfast one morning was Japanese-style (rice, miso soup, pickles, tofu) and Western-style the other (vegan pastries, fruit, bread .. um, and pickles!).  \n*Sobasho Nakaya (not all plant-based, but clearly marked on the menu):* We had lunch here, and you could either have a hot soba dish (kind of like soba ramen.. but not), or a cold soba dish, where the noodles are the star - you basically get noodles to try plain first, and then a variety of toppings to eat them with. We also had some vegetable tempura here.  \n\n\n**Kyoto**  \n*AWOMB Nishikiyamachi (fully plant-based):* We had dinner here. I would call this place deconstructed sushi! It looked beautiful, and the idea was that you combined different small plates they gave you together with your seasoned rice and nori sheets to create your own sushi. It was pretty upmarket and tasted amazing.   \n*Uno Yukiko (fully plant-based, also gluten free):* We had soymilk ramen for lunch here - you could choose various different flavours but.. yea, it was ramen!   \n*IMU hotel (fully plant-based):* We had dinner here once and breakfast here twice. Dinner was a multi-course meal that focused around organic veg, and the chef cooked each course in front of us and chatted with us (combination of Japanese and English). I think there were 10 courses? But it ranged from soup and bread to sushi to tempura. For breakfast, one morning was standard Japanese style (pickles, miso soup, rice, tofu) and one was Western-style - five slices of bread (...yea) with olive oil, a small bowl of soup, salad, and pickles. Oh, and jam!   \n*Kanga-An:* This was a full-on kaiseki style meal and full disclosure, it was not cheap! But it was great, and all served in a private room with views out onto the beautiful garden. Dishes ranged from pickles to tempura to sukiyaki to yuba to tofu and.. well, honestly, most aspects of Japanese cuisine. There was faux eel as well.  \n\n\n**Hakone (ryokan food)**  \n*Fukuzumiro (plant based on request):* We had one dinner and one breakfast here. Dinner was a two course affair of multiple small plates, featuring a little hot plate cast iron dish for each of us, pickles, yuba (I got really into yuba dipped in soy sauce and wasabi.. craving it now!), miso potatoes, rice, miso soup, and so on. Breakfast was similar - we were stuffed! \n\n**Other**  \n*Onigiri*: We picked up quite a lot of these as snacks on the go - the pickled plum onigiri in particular are very tasty! They're about 110-130 yen each, so very cheap. A word to the wise, they're not hugely calorific (maybe 150 calories?) so it's worth picking up more than one if you're making a lunch of it.",

So I collect 16 goshuin over our trip - two of them were the paper you stick in (but real calligraphy, just pre-prepped), one was a stamped goshuin rather than calligraphy (they did check if I was ok with it first, but it was that or nothing!), and the remaining 13 were all written in directly. So based on that I'd say you will mostly get them written in directly! For the paper ones, I bought a little glue stick at a conbini and that worked ok.  \n\n\nI guess a word to the wise on goshuin - they give you a little bit of paper to go between your goshuin to stop them bleeding onto one another while they dry - I removed one of mine after about 8 hours when we got back to our hotel and it veeeery slightly printed the red part of the goshuin onto the next page. Nothing dramatic, but you might want to leave the paper in for a full 24 hours just to be safe :)  \n\n\nP.S. Definitely recommend the tasting tour! It revealed to me that we really need to up our homemade ramen game...",

There are websites where you can print out cards for various food allergies in Japanese and other languages. Being fair even if they speak pretty good English they probably aren't good with specialized terms like medical terms which might be involved. \n\nVegan can be written \u30d3\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3 in katakana. [This blog](https://the-shooting-star.com/japan-vegan-vegetarian-survival-guide/) has a note you can carry giving explanation which you could print from the image [here](https://i0.wp.com/the-shooting-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-ask-for-vegan-food-in-japan.png?resize=960%2C298&amp;ssl=1)\n\nMany Buddhist temples have some sort of arrangement where you stay at them and they provide dinner and breakfast which will be vegetarian and also very good. There is at least one website that only offers this type of stay, but I think it must have been in Japanese as I can't find it now. My cousin who helped me plan speaks and writes Japanese fluently and it must have been something she linked me. If I find the link again I'll come back and post it. Many will work with you to make your meal vegan, but I would try to ask in advance if possible. My cousin wrote a note similar to what I linked above in Japanese for me to email them.",

Kyomizu-dera... we were there probably by 11am or so and it was BUSY. Thick with people. But you could still get some fantastic views and I was quite used to lots of people being around at that stage. Also it was mostly busy with school kids - we seemed to have hit the time of year for school trips! Not a lot you can do about that.\n3. The Kyoto Pokemon centre has different big statues (Shibuya greets you with a giant Mewtwo, Kyoto has a Pikachu in a kimono). The merchandise sold did differ between the stores (I'd say about 40% was different), so it was worth it for us to go to both.\n4. The Nintendo Store - we actually went twice - once on a Saturday at about 12:30pm (I know, not recommended!) and once on a Sunday later in the afternoon, about 4pm. On the Saturday we got a timed entry ticket (for 1-1:30pm), on the Sunday we could just walk right in. So not too much queueing, but it was pretty busy both times which made it difficult to look at what was on offer. I will say that my main interests in that store were Zelda and Animal Crossing, and I found the merchandise for both of those to be a little sparse. There was quite a lot of Mario around, so if that's your thing it's definitely worth a wait.",

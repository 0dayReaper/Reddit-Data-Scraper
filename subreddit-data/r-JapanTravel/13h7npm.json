    "postText": "So I'm leaving in about a week from Japan, and I can't seem to find a ATM that has a lesser withdrawal minimum than 10,000 yen. Which was fine while I'm here but I won't need that much before I leave and we'll end up exchanging it at a currency exchange counter for less than it's worth with the exchange rate and fee. So I'm just wondering does anybody know of any ATMs that take overseas cards that have a lower minimum withdrawal? I've tried lawson, family mart, 7-Eleven and I thought I would ask around.\n\nUpdate: I ended up walking to the nearest post office after trying multiple 7elevens which only despised multiples of 10,000 yen.",

    "postText": "Hiya all,\n\nCouple traveller (31M &amp; 25F) from Australia (Indonesian born) looking to visit Japan for the first time after ages only wishing to go there. I've tried my best to curate this itinerary over the past month and is welcomed to have more recommendations. Our interest mostly on food, desserts, coffee, sightseeing, with specific me skewed towards anime and everything Japanese culture. Since it is our first time, we would like to visit the mainstream destinations first, then will go deeper on the next visit (hopefully soon to come).\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Is Osaka Amazing pass worth it given that we're probably going to use it only for Osaka Castle Gozabune Boat Ride and Umeda Sky Observatory? Or in other words, does those two attractions a must visit?\n2. Is the itinerary too ambitious?\n3.

But I guess it just give us more flexibility if for some reason we want to have a day trip to nagoya or anywhere else (plan change)\n\nIt's save to say that the plan it's doable yeah? Unless it's raining of course, I just need to pray that there will be no rain whatsoever hahaha",

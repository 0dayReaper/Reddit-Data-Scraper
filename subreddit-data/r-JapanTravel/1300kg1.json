You're at an advantage  for Shinkansen travel but other than that you'll likely be overspending if all you're doing is Tokyo to Kyoto and back. \n\nYou don't need to get it on day 1 if you're not going on shinkansen.  Also, if you're going in October,  check pricing.  The price went up to \u00a550k but I'm not sure when the increase is effective.\n\nAlso if you're into Anime, check out Denden town/Osaka and download the Sweets Paradise app and see if you want to go to any theme Cafes and make a reservation.  \n\nFor USJ, get there the sooner the better,  if you don't have express passes make sure you secure those or get there at 6 or 7am and rush to  Super Nintendo world if that is your goal (we didn't bother to see anything but SNW at USJ since we live in California)",

Do you think it\u2019ll be a busy day on Thursday? I\u2019m mainly excited for super Mario world, so I will definitely be going there first!",

Another option would be to drop your luggage at Shin-Osaka in the AM. Unlikely to apply unless you get one of the latest shinkansen, but check when the last local line train to your accommodation in Tokyo runs.",

However, I\u2019d recommend mapping it yourself since the last shinkansen of the night and the last one that allows you to navigate the station with luggage and catch a connecting train to your accommodation might be different. Also, since you\u2019re getting the JR Pass, you won\u2019t be able to ride all types (no Nozomi or Mizuho).",

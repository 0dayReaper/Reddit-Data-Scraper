    "postText": "This forum has given me so much good advice, thought I would return the favour if you\u2019re ever in Japan with a small human. \r  \n\r  \n**Stroller and getting around**\r  \nWe hired a stroller from a nice lady (cash only) and it was a lifesaver in that it was extremely foldable so we could get it into restaurants and up and down stairs if we needed to. Generally speaking, the metro in Tokyo is accessible and there are lifts everywhere \u2014 just follow the signs. (If you use Google maps, it won\u2019t tell you where the accessible exits are - only the nearest exits). However the JR isn\u2019t accessible at all and lifts are almost non existent. A foldable pram works well in a taxi if the walking gets too much. We took buses in Kyoto with the pram and it was not my favourite as the buses get really crowded and you have to try and \u201csumimasen\u201d your way to the front to pay the fare (don\u2019t sit in the back of the bus.)\r  \n\r  \n**Food**\r  \nIn Tokyo, everything opens at 11am. So we relied fairly heavily on the local 7/11 for breakfast and snacks. We did do a few restaurants that had lines and had to rely on electronic distraction (ie Octonauts on the iPad with headphones) to keep the small human occupied. Every restaurant will give you wipes so I stashed a lot of these in my bag for future use, you will need them. Not every restaurant will give the kid a fork (or think to give the kid a fork) so there was a few times when I used a plastic one stored from my bag. There really weren\u2019t any high chairs (not that we needed one anyway but it occurred to me that we never got an offer) so either he had his own seat or was propped on my lap if it was a tight restaurant.\r  \n\r  \n**Rubbish**\r  \nTake a stash of garbage bags with you, there are no bins anywhere. You\u2019ll need them for stashing snack wrappers, empty bottles, whatever refuse your toddler dreams up.\r  \n\r  \n**Luggage forwarding**\r  \nI had visions in my head of never having to move luggage the entire time. But it turns out that we were in an apartment/hotel/rental in Osaka that didn\u2019t accept forwarding so that popped a hole in that dream. Check with your hotel!\r  \n\r  \n**Tokyo**\r  \n*Pok\u00e9mon Centre*\r  \nThe kid loves Pok\u00e9mon but I didn\u2019t like my chances of booking a space in the cafe (there was no space). We went anyway and worked our away around the massive gift store which he was just as happy with. Came out with a whole bunch of Pok\u00e9mon merch as the centre intended. It is hilariously noted that the same merch was cheaper in Yobodashi. Oh, and the kid lost the Eevee figurine several times (showed up in the pram cover and then lost forever in the streets of Harajuku) so if your kid is particularly attached to small pieces, I would consider getting duplicates (after Harajuku, we got Eevee triplicates)\r  \n\r  \n*Disney Sea*\r  \nI guess the only thing I can say is: don't go when it's raining? (We had booked on Klook in advance and were locked in.) Everybody else had the same idea and the park was pretty empty. I think it might have been nice on a sunny day. All the stalls were closed, lots of rides were not possible or at least looked incredibly uncomfortable - the people on the Gondola looked pretty miserable. We mostly did the mermaid lagoon section which was targeted towards young kids and luckily undercover (not much wait times either) but all in all it was probably the shortest Disney trip I've ever done and we were out by 2pm.\r  \n\r  \nAs an observation, I thought it was interesting there was not much in the way of modern merch? No Frozen at all, no Encanto, no Moana etc etc you get the drift. Not a complaint, just interesting. Lots of headbands though.\r  \n\r  \n*Kiddyland*\r  \nGiant toy store with six different levels. We amazingly didn\u2019t buy anything there but you might want to hold onto your wallet. I think we were an anomaly.\r  \n\r  \n*TeamLabs*\r  \nBooked Teamlabs pretty early on and so we had reserved tickets for the opening 10am session. It was pretty fun and definitely interesting. He wasn\u2019t too thrilled with some of the darker rooms but worked his way through it. Wear shorts as there are some rooms where the water reached his thighs. If dark rooms and wet rooms are not your kids thing, the staff offer kid-friendly detours.\r  \n\r  \n**Osaka**\r  \n*Osaka Castle*\r  \nSpent a full day in the parks around Osaka Castle. Lots of park to run around and rocks to climb. With the castle, noting that the castle exterior is stunning however the interior is not for kids. It\u2019s a museum for history buffs (so all me.) lots of reading and some photos and he bored of it really quickly. We ended up having to speed run down the floors. So not worth it with kids basically, he was much happier outside doing his thing. We also did the boat ride and it was eh.\r  \n\r  \n*Osaka Aquarium*\r  \nWe had high expectations that it would be as good as Monterey. It was really fantastic and had an awesome time but it\u2019s a whole day excursion. All the kids had play passports that you can get at the front to stamp what animals you\u2019ve seen. The kid was \u201cfished out\u201d by the last half an hour, he wanted to look at something other than fish and was (slightly) relieved to get out.\r  \n\r  \n**Nara**\r  \nThe kid loved the deer, and for the most part they were pretty gentle with him. They 100% were not so gentle on my husband and he got chased around. The temple was pretty amazing but the kid did not care so much about that and just wanted to go back and hang with the deer some more.\r  \n\r  \n**Kyoto**\r  \n*Umekoji Park*\r  \nTook the small human to Umekoji Park and it was lovely with a creek that he could wade in (the Japanese kids brought toys and nets to scoop tadpoles) and a playground he could play in. Lots of greenery he could run around in. It wasn\u2019t remarkable for me but he loved it so if you need green that doesn\u2019t involve temples, it\u2019s a good kid-friendly choice.\r  \n\r  \n*Arashima Bamboo and Monkey Park*\r  \nWe got up extra early to beat the crowds. The small human enjoyed the Bamboo Park and picking up sticks, it wasn\u2019t too intensive for him as it was pretty pram-friendly. It turned into a thirty degree day as we headed to the Monkey Park. It\u2019s a really steep incline 450m up so we didn\u2019t bother to take the pram (although we saw some parents who did), he did really well and walked all the way up but I can understand that there are lots of kids who would not be thrilled with the idea. All the way up the top is a playground area so he glommed onto the playground and not so much the monkeys (ask me how thrilled I was that we walked that distance in steaming hot weather for him to be distracted by a shoddy seesaw) \r  \nI dragged him to see the monkeys and we kept a safe distance of 2 metres, but his heart wasn\u2019t in it anymore.\r  \n\r  \n**Where we stayed** \r  \nMimaru Akasaka - Tokyo\r  \nBon Condominium Umeda - Osaka\r  \nThe Blossom - Kyoto \r  \n\r  \nWe did our best to stay in places that were 40sqm and family friendly. We knew that it would be pretty stressful to stay somewhere where we would be tripping over each other. As a result, our hotels required a little bit more in travel time (extra five to ten minutes?). \r  \nOur hotels were pretty great overall. Just a note though - Bon Condominium needed to turn on a boiler before we could get hot water for a shower. If you\u2019re at The Blossom, make sure you check out the basement floor for free snacks.\r  \n\r  \n**Random bits and pieces** \r  \n*Random busty ladies*\r  \nI have been to Japan a few times before (but never with a kid) and in those previous times, I have very distinct memories of lots of random not-quite-clothed manga statuettes everywhere I went. So I was all prepared to talk to the small human about what they were doing and why they were semi-dressed. But in my two weeks, I never saw a single one so my prepared speech never happened. I have no idea where they all went. Maybe they all migrated to Akhibara?\r  \n\r  \n*Loxonin*\r  \nIt\u2019s random but you can buy this rub at any pharmacy and it saved my legs considerably on days when I walked 20kms.\r  \n\r  \n*Electronic distraction*\r  \nI\u2019m *that* parent. When the lines or the public transport ride was too long, I popped some headphones on and gave him an iPad. It saved my stress levels and from him getting completely rowdy. I think particularly the restauranteurs appreciated for the most part a silent child.\r  \n\r  \n*Most people speak English*. They really appreciate it when you try to speak to them in Japanese though.\r  \n\r  \n*Masks*\r  \nMask usage has dropped considerably, even on public transport.\r  \n\r  \n*Kids clothes*\r  \nWas all set to buy the kid a new wardrobe annnnd there\u2019s not that many obvious places to buy kids clothes other than H&amp;M and Uniqlo. Sometimes not even Uniqlo - the Roppongi store has no kids section as a case in point. H&amp;M overall had the better selection.\r  \n\r  \n*Bathrooms* \r  \nBathrooms are everywhere and they\u2019re all extremely clean. We never really worried about finding one. We just made him go every three hours or so to avoid any potential issues or leaks. We only had one real emergency where I had to run him through a department store but got there in time and crisis was averted.\r  \n\n\nHappy to answer any questions or help where I can!",

We all took some melatonin to help us get in the rhythm. \n\nWe stayed exclusively in Airbnbs, which gave us and the kids more space. Also having a kitchen and a fridge meant that we always had breakfast ready as soon as they woke up. \n\nWe packed a usb-c to hdmi and a hdmi cable so that we could use the iPad on the tv in the appartement.\n\nWe used the Shinkansen for three trips (Tokyo - Osaka, Kyoto - Hakata and Hakata - Tokyo). Reserving seats through SmartEX was easy. Although the kids were \u2018free\u2019 we decided to book them their own children\u2019s seats.\n\nTokyo Toy Museum was one of the highlights of the trip. Such a nice place with a great atmosphere. \n\nBe ready to walk a lot. The kids did great but ultimately their legs got tired. We carried them on our shoulders when that happened. Free workout for your back, neck and shoulders.\n\nCarry snacks\u2026 all the extra calories burned by walking deserve to be compensated.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have a set plan. We had pinned quite a few things we liked on Google maps and in the mornings we would decide what we were going to do.\n\nWe avoided using public transportation during rush hours. It might be because of this but we actually didn\u2019t find any place or city to be extremely crowded. Compared to the queue\u2019s and numbers of tourists we are used to in European (capital) cities it wasn\u2019t too bad in Japan.",

While it's a much harder logistic traveling with kids, I loved seeing their interactions and hilarious antics. It's worth it for me to travel with my kids, but it might not be worth it for others.

We didn\u2019t have jet lag because we were on an hour time difference from our country, but it did mean that we were up at 5am Japan time and had no idea what to do with ourselves til 11am when everything opened. \n\nRe napping: the small human passed out in his stroller for a good portion of the days. We didn\u2019t go back to the hotel to nap since it wasn\u2019t super easy (for us) to navigate public transport back.\n\nWe didn\u2019t do any family restaurants because we couldn\u2019t find any! I didn\u2019t see any Jonathan\u2019s or Denny\u2019s or anything like that but that\u2019s probably because we were based in Akasaka (which was pretty quiet and a bit upmarket) and close to Roppongi. Would have been handy!",

There were no hand towels and he didn\u2019t love it when there was a hand dryer (that\u2019s the loud noise again) so he air dried.\nThe only toilet that I found questionable was the ones at Umekoji park but only because they had physical soap and it was in a net?

Where we stayed in Bon Umeda in Osaka doesn\u2019t receive forwarding however (no concierge) so we chose to leave some at Mimaru and haul the rest to Osaka. I think you\u2019d have to check with your individual hotels to make sure they have forwarding options. I did read that if your ensuing hotel doesn\u2019t receive luggage forwarding then it\u2019s possible to send to a combini/convenience store instead but we weren\u2019t super sure of how that worked.\n\nThe other thing to mention and I hope if this is helpful to someone! We also attempted to do luggage forwarding from Tokyo station to the airport - the website states that it\u2019s a same day service - but when we got there the lady said that it must be done two days in advance so that never happened either. So we ended up leaving it there for the day and picking it up later but it would have been handy for a same day forwarding option to exist (there is such a thing in Hong Kong, so I was a little surprised that there wasn\u2019t one in Tokyo.)",

The view was amazing apart from the telephone pole in the view but that was barely noticeable. We watched the sun set over Mt. Fuji and just as the sun was setting all these Buddhist bells over the valley started chiming loudly. A very special romantic time. \nThe food there was incredible, some of the best we had the entire holiday. We were the only white people there and the only people not wearing kimonos at dinner (they provide beautiful kimonos on entry to the hotel). \n\n\nStaff were amazing and the whole place felt so relaxed and calm.\n\n\nYou can get the bus from Shinjuku bus station to Fujikawaguchiko and then when you get there ring them and they will collect you or get a taxi for about 10 quid. We went to the tourist information centre in Shinjuku station to help plan the travel. If you don't already know Tokyo or don't speak Japanese the tourist info centre in shinjuku bus station is by far the best. \n\n\nThe only downside to the hotel is that it cost \u00a3400 a night for the both of us. We paid a lot extra for the private onsen though so could have got the room for cheaper. If you are going with a partner of the opposite sex then you won't be able to use the onsens at the hotel together as they are split gender unless you have your own private one.\n\n\nThere are other similar hotels too. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g1165976-Fujikawaguchiko_machi_Minamitsuru_gun_Yamanashi_Prefecture_Chubu-Hotels.html\n\n\nThe top one on this list looks amazing. Bit more expensive than the one we went to though. Be warned though they get booked up very far ahead and quick.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the trip? Who are you going with? What places are you going to?",

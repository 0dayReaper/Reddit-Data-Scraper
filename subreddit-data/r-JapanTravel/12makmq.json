    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be spending 28 days in Japan in May (2023), with 7 of those days being spent in Osaka (5 full days, and 2 travel days \u2014 one from Kyoto to Osaka, and the other being Osaka to Tokyo)\n\nCurrently, my itinerary for Osaka looks like this (I have a google map going at the moment with pinpointed locations planned, so this itinerary is a rough outline, thanks for bearing with me):\n\n\u2022 Day 1: Traveling from Kyoto to Osaka\n\u2022 Day 2: Spending the day around Dotonbori, doing some shopping, trying street food\n\u2022 Day 3: Katsuo-Ji &amp; Minoh Falls\n\u2022 Day 4: (Hiroshima?) *see below* \u2014 would see the Peace Memorial and Museum, given my uncertainty around whether to visit, I haven\u2019t fully ironed this out\n\u2022 Day 5: It\u2019s forecasted to rain so I would use today as a laundry/shopping day \u2014 also to do anything spontaneous that peaks my interest\n\u2022 Day 6: Day trip to Himeji\n\u2022 Day 7: Osaka to Tokyo\n\nGiven this itinerary, I was wondering if anyone thinks the currently scheduled *Day* Trip to Hiroshima is reasonable.\n\nI\u2019ve heard mixed reviews online given the fact that it\u2019s 2 hours each way on the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen train. I also am considering including Miyajima into this Hiroshima trip (but understand that\u2019s also another train, ferry and 1h30m of travel time to account for).\n\nIf anyone else has taken the day trip from Osaka to Hiroshima/Miyajima and has any thoughts, in light of my itinerary, I would greatly appreciate. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m trying to bite off more than I can chew with this plan.",

So, the enjoyment or lack thereof depends on your travel style.\n\n* Get up early for one of the earliest trains out \n\n* Check tide tables to decide which version of the big torii gate on Miyajima you want to see\n\n* No sit-down meals in restaurants or cafes until dinner. Buy breakfast the night before to eat on the train, gulp down lunch (wastes too much sightseeing time otherwise)\n\n* Plan out the entire day according to local transit timetables and operating hours, either stick to it or know what you prioritize (eg spent longer on Mt Misen than expected -&gt; less time in atomic museum)\n\n* Eat okonomiyaki for dinner",

            "comment": "You can catch a ferry to Miyajima directly from the Peace Park area, however it isn\u2019t included in the JR pass and I think it slightly more expensive. I took this ferry two weeks ago and it was great, but still took about 45 minutes each way. If you have the time to stay overnight in Hiroshima, I would recommend that. Hotel rooms are fairly cheap.",

If we were more in a rush we probably could have seen more of the castle but we were taking it easy. It was a long day but not too difficult, as the shinkansens were very comfortable. I found Hiroshima to be very interesting, so I would reccomend it.",

I was underwhelmed by the place tbh because of high expectations but still no regrets visiting the place. It was part of my Japan bucketlist and happy to be able to tick it off on my 3rd Japan visit\n\nDidn't visit Miyajima anymore because I feel that the itinerary will be too tight. Might not make it to the last train going back to Nagoya",

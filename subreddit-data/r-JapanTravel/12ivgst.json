    "postText": "In just one month and one day, I will get on the airplane towards Japan. I've spend some time the last few months to plan and book this trip, and I'm very excited to go!\n\nI decided to make a day-by-day itinerary with locations, but not too many activities. That way, I'm at least a little flexible in what I will do each day. Without further ado, my itinerary:\n\n**Day 0 (May 12th)**\n\nDeparture from Schiphol Amsterdam\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1 (May 13th) - Arrival in Tokyo**\n\nLand at Narita at 13:15\n\nPick up Data SIM card, JR pass, SUICA card\n\nHead to accomodation ([Ito Ryokan](https://goo.gl/maps/PfhHwEGzhoFajewm8)) and relax\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2, 3 (May 14th, 15th) - Tokyo**\n\nHang out in Tokyo, get over jetlag, see some sights\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4 (May 16th) - Hakone**\n\nTake an early train towards Hakone with the Hakone FreePassLeave my large backpack in a coinlocker in Odawara, take my smaller backpack with meSpend the day exploring Hakone, stay at [Mikawaya Ryokan](https://goo.gl/maps/zNnjSsURzzcDmDxS8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5 (May 17th) - Hakone, activate 21 day JR pass today**\n\nFinish exploring Hakone\n\nPick up large backpack at Odawara and take Shinkansen to Nagoya\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6 (May 18th) - Nagoya**\n\nToyota Automobile Museum\n\nHigashiyamna Sky Tower\n\nTake Shinkansen to Osaka\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 7 (May 19th) - Nara**\n\nDaytrip to Nara, attend the [Uchiwa-maki event](https://narashikanko.or.jp/en/event/uchiwamaki_tousyoudaiji/)\n\nAccomodation in Osaka: [HIPPO Hostel](https://goo.gl/maps/BWTyf7HampuQnhiH7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 8, 9 (May 20th, 21st) - Osaka/Kyoto**\n\nStay in Osaka, explore Osaka/Kyoto\n\nNo fixed activities planned\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 10 (May 22nd) - Koyasan**\n\nTravel to Koyasan, stay at Muryoko-in Temple\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 11 - 13 (May 23rd - 25th)**  \\- **Osaka/Kyoto**\n\nNo fixed activities planned\n\n*No accomodation booked (keeping it open to decide during the trip)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 14 (May 26th) - Himeij Castle &amp; Hiroshima**\n\nTake Shinkansen to Himeij and visit the castle\n\nTake Shinkansen to Hiroshima and check into accomodtation ([Roku hostel](https://goo.gl/maps/WNc6u6LWJJ2LV2Mo7))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 15, 16 (May 27th, 28th) - Hiroshima**\n\nExplore Hiroshima\n\nTake a [guided tour](https://www.magical-trip.com/product/4b8953b7-b5d8-46b9-b6b0-3b0f10942a68) of the city\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 17 (May 29th) - Miyaijma Island**\n\nSpend the day exploring Miyaijma Island\n\nStay the night at [Hotel Sakuraya](https://goo.gl/maps/t1kAfP3VXtUYcT678)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 18 (May 30th) - back to Nagoya**\n\n*This probably seems insane (and maybe it is). I managed to get a ticket for the Studio Ghibly Park in Nagoya, but the only day left was May 30st. This is why I suddenly return to Nagoya.*\n\nSpend more time on Miyaijma Island\n\nShinkansen to Nagoya in the late afternoon/evening\n\nStay the night at [Nagoya Prince Hotel Sky Tower](https://goo.gl/maps/dvUW92EhYg33grTW9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 19 (May 31st) - Studio Ghibly Park**\n\nSpend the day at Studio Ghibly Park\n\nTake train to Takayama in the evening\n\nStay at [Wat Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/Jdo9RF9YnpNGuTdq7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 20 (June 1st) - Takayama and Toyama**\n\n*Traveling towards Tateyama for the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route*Spend the day in TakayamaTake train to Toyama, stay at [Toyoko Inn](https://goo.gl/maps/k7zbJyTXouLNVoaa8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 21 (June 2nd) - Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route**\n\nEarly train to TateyamaForward large backpack to accomodation in OmachiStart the [Alpine Route](https://www.alpen-route.com/en/), one-way to OmachiAccommodation: [Kurobe Sun Valley Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/tKimL61PKT8D1FPP6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 22-24 (June 3rd - 5th) - no solid plans (JR Pass still active)**\n\nWhile I dont have plans yet, I will likely pick a nearby city/town and stay there these days\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 25 (June 6th) - Final day of JR pass**\n\nHead back to Tokyo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 26-34 (June 7th - 15th) - Tokyo and surrounding area**\n\nSpend time in Tokyo. Some of the things I have in mind:\n\n* Joypolis\n* Museum of Emerging Science\n* Akihabara\n* Shibuya\n* TeamLab Planets\n* Daytrip to Nikko\n\nOther than this, I am also open to anything I learn about during my trip. Having a little over a week of unplanned days gives me some flexibility in case I learn about something awesome to see/do during the trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have the a few questions about my itinerary:\n\n1. Does it seem feasible? Are there days that are impossible?\n2. I do not have accomodation booked for days 11-13 and 22-34. This is to have some flexibility, both in location and type of accomodation (hotel vs hostel). Will it be possible to find decently priced accomodation during the trip, or will it cost considerably more?\n3. Is spending the last 9 days of my trip in Tokyo a good idea? The idea behind it is to have a more relaxed period at the end of the trip, while also having time for some shopping and casual sight seeing. I'm curious about your thoughts and/or experiences.\n\nThanks for reading! Any tips, comments and advice are greatly appreciated :)",

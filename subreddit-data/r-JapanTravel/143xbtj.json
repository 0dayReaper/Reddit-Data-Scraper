They're a menace to regular people trying to drive normally.\n\nI highly suggest going to Asakusa and checking out Sensoji Temple and the surrounding area.  Lots to see, eat, and experience.\n\nI also recommend going to a tourist information center and getting the 72-hour Tokyo subway pass.  It's \u00a51,500 and is both convenient and a great deal.  (Not just tourist information centers, also located at different large train stations, airports, and tourist information centers, one of which I frequented across the street from Asakusa's Kaminarimon gate).",

There is routes that are much more complicated like doing Shinjuku to Harajuku or Harajuku to Shibuya that are simply connected via the Yamanote. Some places do not have subway at all like going to Ghibli Museum or Odaiba.\n\nThere is also the Tokunai Pass that offer unlimited JR within the 23 wards of Tokyo, but again, you need to use JR enough time to justify it and you have the same limitation.\n\nAt the end of the day, it might just be more simple to use an IC card and pay for whatever transport makes most sense and unless you take the train or subway a lot of times each day, the price difference might not be that big.",

We found it more pleasant to pay everything with our IC cards, no worries about fares, 100% flexible. In contrast to some reports I based our schedule on, which indicated that tourists seldomly need public busses, we took the bus for several legs (Imado jinja, Yanaka, Koto).",

We went really early in the morning, like around 7 am, and it was extremely peaceful and felt like we were away from Tokyo. \n\nIf you exit Meiji Jingu north towards Yoyogi, you can visit the park there, or do something that not a lot of people know about: climb a mini Fuji mound. These were built for people who couldn't make the actual journey, and are said to impart the same blessings as climbing Mt. Fuji. We saw no other tourists there, and the view of the shrine was lovely: [https://goo.gl/maps/i8eDBsCdQfZTXMse9](https://goo.gl/maps/i8eDBsCdQfZTXMse9)\n\nHarajuku itself was very, very crowded. I'd avoid going on a weekend. If you're interested in fashion, you might want to spend more time in Shimokitazawa and/or Koenji which at this point are trendier areas.",

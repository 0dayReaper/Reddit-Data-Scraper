We have broad interests and also open to getting a hire car in either location as I have an international permit. \n\nThanks for any ideas.",

(there are some great things in the area, but just going to go, seems an odd choice and it is quite far from Toyama and Kanazawa.\n\nIf you rent a car rather than taking trains/buses be prepared for large drop off fees if the car is not returned in the prefecture rented.\n\nIf you wanted to do Nagoya I would stick to something more along the coast which might include Hakone, Izu, Shizuoka, Hamamatsu, and Nagoya.",

I was there in bad weather (which also made it devoid of both Japanese and western tourists) but it's a lovely area and because of the prices to actually stay in Kamikochi it is more common as a day trip.\n\nIt will definitely give you a different feel.",

How much of it can be changed?\n\nif its possible, spend more time in the cities you already have plans in.  \n\nIm planning a 10 trip for Osaka, Kyoto, hiroshima and kinda wish I had more time because there is a lot to see and do around those areas.",

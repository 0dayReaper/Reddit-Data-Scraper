    "postText": "My husband and I are leaving next week for Tokyo. We'll get to our hotel late Friday, so no plans that day. Saturday to Monday we have completely free. Tuesday and Wednesday we have work dinners at 7pm, and Thursday is all work. We leave Friday.\n\nHere is my tentative plan. We want to be fairly relaxed and have time to putter around a given area, so I'm trying not to overschedule.\n\n**Saturday:** \n\n\\-Meiji Shrine\n\n\\-Harajuku area\n\n\\-Shibuya crossing and shopping in the area\n\n\\-Piss Alley in the evening\n\n\\-possible points of interest: Tokyu Hands, Don Quijote, Happy Pancake, Shin Udon\n\n**Sunday:**\n\n\\-Akihabara\n\n\\-Aki-Oka Artisan\n\n\\-points of interest: various arcades and all things electronic\n\n(not sure if we need anything else for this day. We're the kind of people who can putter endlessly but don't want to get bored either)\n\n**Monday:**  \n\\-Kappabashi (Kitchen Street) with a plan to leave my many purchases in a locker at the nearby station\n\n\\-Sensoji\n\n\\-Skytree at sunset\n\n**Tuesday:**\n\n\\-Teamlab Planets\n\n\\-Pottery class in Minato area\n\n\\-work dinner\n\n**Wednesday:**\n\n\\-flex day!\n\n\\-work dinner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are not married to this itinerary and I would really appreciate any tips, recommendations, or additions, even if there is just a particular restaurant or bar that you would highly recommend. Thank you!!",

It has way better fashion shopping, cafes, and little shops for souvenirs and gifts than Harajuku does now.  Made for much more enjoyable puttering.  Depending on when you do Teamlabs, the Toyosu fish market is like right there.  Daiwa Sushi is the less busy of their two options (only like a 45 min wait instead of 5+ hours) and was maybe the best food we had in Tokyo.  Akihabara has more than enough to occupy you for one day, especially if you're into nerdy stuff.  The owl cafe there was a really cool experience. Super Potato is really cool for retro games and Mandarake had the best collection of collectibles.",

I hadn't heard of it, but Shimokitazawa looks like it would be a much better choice!\n\nI also think I'm going to move the pottery to the morning of Akihabara because it was lining up well with the teamlabs options, so fish market will also be perfect.\n\nThank you thank you!",

It may mean less to *you*, but it's the same. Also, gothic lolita has been a thing since the 80s. Inferring that it's a recent thing that is now tired is wildly inaccurate.",

It's old buildings with a more bohemian, throw-back fashion vibe.\n\nOne isn't better than the other when it comes to fashion, and Harajuku is still Harajuku: modern, crowded, trendy, and - yes - a bit sketchy sometimes. They're different. You have no insight into what OP is into.\n\nIn fact, if OP is into fashion, they should see both.",

As opposed to being about the shopping, it was more about the people watching. Apparently that's changed, and not many people show up anymore. Regardless, we're going to hopefully be back next year, so eventually I'll see it all!",

I would also see if you can spare some time to see Yanaka neighborhood on Monday. It survived the firebombing of ww2, so it gives an old Tokyo vibe. Ueno park is nearby too.",

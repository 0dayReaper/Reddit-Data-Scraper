It's a nice fireworks but the whole thing is more of an \"event\" than a fireworks festival.\n\nAlso, it has been cancelled for 3 years, so expect even MORE crowds... \n\nI'd never bring a toddler there. \n\nThere are other festivals of more or less the same scale that are easier to see, not necessarily with fewer people but more spreadout and a bit more spatious area. For instance on July 22, Adachi fireworks, on Aug 5th, Itabashi and Edogawa fireworks....",

Large crowds, but nowhere near the unbearable levels of Sumidagawa. Free, this one would be my choice.\n\nEDIT : and the park itself is nice with several old buildings that were moved there, so you can go earlier, finish your day there and grab a snack while waiting for the fireworks.\n\nSame day, the Hachioji fireworks, held in Fujimori park, 3000 shots (but maybe one hour from Tokyo, a bit far in the burbs).",

When I went years ago the crowds were crazy\u2014 well managed, but still a bit scary, especially when trying to get on the trains when it was all over.

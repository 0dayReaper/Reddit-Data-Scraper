    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m planning on reserving the Hirosaki to Akita route on Resort Shirakami, and want to sit on the scenic ocean side. Despite extensive attempts to research, I still cannot find which side should I sit (A or D) if I want to sit on the window seat facing the scenic ocean side. I found one post specifying row A, but it doesn\u2019t mention which direction of train. Does anyone have experience with this? In need of this verification asap. Thank you!",

You can book the seat online and then visit a JR East Travel Service Center to ask the English speaking staff there and they and  lookup and confirm that you are sitting on the ocean side. It\u2019s unlikely you be Resort Shirakami will be fully booked unless it\u2019s during Golden Week or another holiday week like Obon or New Years.",

When I tried to logic it out, I was very confused because - if the train travelled from Aomori to Akita (north to south), following the train diagram, the ocean would be on the right hand side as it would be going down...but so many people booked row A. But then I saw a post saying it depends on the direction we travel, so I wasn't sure TT\n\nOn that note, would you happen to know if Car 1 would still be the leading car, or is it switched to Car 4?",

It\u2019s easier for me because so many Japanese train otaku blogs talk about this.\n\nThe Resort  Shirakami changes its direction three times, at Hirosaki Station, Kawabe Station, and Higashi-noshiro Station. The railway line between Kawabe Station and Higashi-noshiro, which runs along the Sea of Japan coast, is called the Gono Line and is famous for its ocean view. Within the Gono line, A seats are always on the seaside.\n\nIf you want to stay in the front car on this line, you should choose Car 4. You\u2019re going southbound, so A seats are on the right side. Therefore, by using the JR East website diagrams, I believe Car 4 is located at the front of the train.\n\n[https://jreast.travel/joyfultrain/shirakami.php](https://jreast.travel/joyfultrain/shirakami.php)",

Same side as the 'box' seats.\n\nAlthough even if you are on the 'wrong' side, there are observation areas in the train you can move to, notably the 'bar' along the window on the 'Buna' train, which faces the ocean directly.",

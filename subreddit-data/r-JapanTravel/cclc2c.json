As far as I know in most countries people think it's nice if you try to speak their language or at least use the most common phrases (good day, thank you, excuse me,...), I also heard there are some countries where people don't like it if you \"butcher\" their language(looking at you France). How is it commonly perceived in Japan?\n\nTL;dr My Japanese is really bad/non existent. Is it seen as polite/nice if I greet and thank in Japanese or not?",

Phrases are always useful though! Recently Paulo from Tokyo did a good video on phrases to use in restaurants, but on my recent trip I used things like \u2018doko ni kaimasu ka?\u2019 (Where do I buy this\u2014 pointing to a display) and \u2018kore, onegaishimasu\u2019 helps in restaurants while pointing to the food pic in the menu. \n\nI think mainly, although I can ask lots of things I realized I may not always know the answer so things like \u2018mou yukkuri\u2019/\u2018mou ichido yukkuri onegaishimasu\u2019 (once more, slowly) helps! Also I suck at fast numbers so \u2018Ikura desu ka\u2019 (how much is it) sometimes I have to follow with the \u2018pls more slow omg\u2019 so be aware when you need directions or whatnot you can understand those directions! Left/right/outside/inside/floor #s... but all in all, knowing some phrases help tremendously and is often appreciated!! And when you get the \u2018\u3042\u3042 \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e0a\u624b\u201d you too will know \u2018well...... maybe one day.\u2019",

I looked like what I am, a late middle-aged American male of European descent. At one particular shrine, an elderly Japanese man approached me and offered in perfect English to answer any questions I might have about this place. It just so happened that there was a point of grammar that was giving me trouble in the sign, so I thanked him and started to read it out in Japanese to frame my question. He stopped me suddenly, as though alarmed. \"Why did you point to that character?\" he asks. At that second I was pointing to the simplest word on the sign, \u5341\u4e00, 11. A bit confused, I translated the sign into English down to that point and asked if I got something wrong. He still looked stunned, and strangely enough, disappointed. \"You read Japanese? Why would you learn an ugly language like Japanese? Why not learn beautiful languages like French or Italian?\" I stuttered something about how much I like the Japanese language. The elderly man stuttered an apology back at me and rapidly retreated.\n\nIn retrospect, it occurs to me that I was being impolite by failing to anticipate the role the kind old fellow had chosen for me. I was the Dumb But Friendly American Tourist, and he was generously offering to explain things that Dumb But Friendly American Tourists couldn't possibly understand on their own. By ruining my portrayal of this role in our impromptu little scene, I had stomped on his outgoing generosity, a very rare and wonderful behavior in Japan.\n\nBad Japanese is great, because you are confirming the comforting stereotype that only the Japanese can speak (or read) Japanese.",

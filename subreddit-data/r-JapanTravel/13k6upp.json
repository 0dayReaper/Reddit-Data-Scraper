    "postText": "Hi everyone. My buddy and I are going to be taking our first trip to Japan in July, and I wanted to get feedback on the itinerary and ask a few questions. I really don\u2019t have all the activities nailed down to specific days - hoping people can give me ideas on how much time to plan for various points of interest. I also plan on leaving some ability to pivot for weather, particularly when it comes to Kyoto. For the questions I have, I'm just going to insert them at the relevant points.\n\n **July 8th** \\- Arrive Narita Airport late afternoon.\n\n* Pick up JR rail passes.\n   * Which brings me to my first question - I've seen that I can buy a voucher ahead of time and redeem it on arrival - does this save a significant amount of time and money or is it likely not worth the hassle?\n* Check into the hotel/scrounge for a meal then succumb to jet lag. I haven\u2019t booked a hotel yet as I'm not sure what area makes the most sense.\n\n**July 9th-11th Tokyo** \\- includes, but is not necessarily limited to (or in this order)\n\n* Day 1: Tokyo National Museum, Ueno Park and Asakusa \n   * Are these three a feasible one day group or am I shorting us on activity or time? \n* Day 2: Pokemon Center DX, Ginza, Tokyo Tower - same question as above.\n* Day 3: For a third day I have Meiji Shrine and Team Labs left and they look they aren't an ideal grouping.\n   * What would travel time between the two realistically look like (I\u2019m picking up vibes that I can't always trust Google due to ticket queues etc.) Is doing those two in one day ok, should I scrap one and loop in other things more clustered around one choice?\n\n**July 12-14 Hakone** \\-  we have two nights booked at a ryokan - will be using a takuhaibin service to forward our bulky luggage to Kyoto and just traveling with backpacks for this part of the trip.\n\n*July 12*\n\n* Getting there via JR to Odawara then onwards with the Hakone Free Pass. \n   * Seems like we should be able to purchase the HKP online ahead of time, is that correct, and how far in advance should I do that? \n* Step out of the station and see Odawara Castle as long as we are there.\n* Chisu Falls, maybe Hakone Open Air Museum.\n* Check into the ryokan nearby after 3 pm and probably just unwind the rest of the evening there.\n\n***July 13*** \n\n*  Would like to get a hike in the early morning before it gets too hot.\n* Does anyone have suggestions? The majority of the trails seem to be a bit removed from where we are staying but we really want a chance to take in the scenery.\n* Choanji and the cable car over the volcanic vents. \\*\n*  Botanical gardens.\n\n***July 14*** \n\n* Travel to Kyoto (in AM)\n\n**July 14-21 Kyoto** \\- I have far less structure for this part of the trip, partially by design. I like the idea of it being slightly more relaxed and spontaneous. That said, we still have a decent list of places we would like to visit below. Please let me know if you have any recommendations on how to group these different excursions.\n\n* Samurai Ninja Museum \n* Gion \n* Sanneizaka \n* Nijo Castle \n* Kyoto Imperial Palace \n* Higashiyama Jisho-ji \n* Kinkakuji \n* Ginkakuji \n* Arashiyama Bamboo Grove \n* Fushimi Inari Taisha \n* Gekkeikan Okura Sake Museum \n* Day trip to Osaka - Osaka Castle and the aquarium, with Dotonburi in there somewhere as well. \n* Looking for day trip suggestions on Lake Biwa or on the Sea of Japan coast.\n\n**July 21 - Return to Tokyo**\n\n* Drop off the luggage at the hotel \n* Looking for ideas of what to do in the afternoon/evening in Tokyo\n\n**July 22 - Flight leaves from Narita at 6:15 pm**\n\n* Perhaps do something in Tokyo in the morning - suggestions welcome \n* Take public transportation to head to the Narita airport mid-afternoon",

            "comment": "For Tokyo, I think your major activities are definitely reasonable. Akihabara is the nerdy/gaming/anime area and one stop down from Ueno, I would suggest maybe having that as an option to explore if you have time on that day. Definitely worth wandering through even if you're not into that kind of stuff.\n\nYou also don't seem to have Ikebukuro, Shibuya, Harajuku, or Shinjuku on your agenda yet. If you want to go to Meiji Shrine, I'd say spend half the day there exploring at least Harajuku/Shibuya or the Yoyogi areas. \n\nDepending on when your TeamLabs tickets are for, there's also the Toyosu and Tsukiji fish market areas that are nearby and quite fun, but they're more of a morning activity. Meiji Shrine can also be done super early (they open at 5am) so if you're jetlagged, maybe consider doing that early. The downside is, no shops or restaurants nearby will open until at least 10am.\n\nOther Tokyo suggestions for your evening free would be one of the other areas I mentioned above if you haven't checked them out yet.",

            "comment": "Generally agreed with other comments that the JR Pass may not be your most cost-effective plan, unless you end up doing way more day trips out of Kyoto to Gifu, Nara, Osaka, Himeji, etc, as well as exclusively taking the Yamanote line around Tokyo. Might want to find a trip calculator to verify that before pulling the trigger. That said, I was under the impression that the only way to even get the JR Pass (available only to foreign visitors) was to get the voucher ahead of time either from the official site or from a third party, so honestly you might as well just do it. You have plenty of time to get the voucher shipped to you. Hit an office before the rush (around 9am) and you'll breeze through - we exchanged ours at Umeda station Osaka, got there stupid early because we were up at 7 anyway, and breezed through in five minutes. Half an hour later while having coffee at the cafe next to the office, there was a massive line.\n\nPlaces to stay in Tokyo? The most popular areas with travelers seem to be Shinjuku and Ueno, it entirely depends on what areas and activities are a priority. Shinjuku is great if you want fast access to the trains to get anywhere but especially Shibuya, Harajuku, and transfers to the shinkansen; full disclosure we stayed on the west side of Shinjuku station just beyond the Yodobashi Camera district, lots of cheap business hotels there. Unless there are specific stores you want to shop, I'd recommend skipping Harajuku, it's a sad shell of what it was 20 years ago. Hipster fashion has definitely shifted to Shimokitazawa. I'd look at the various districts/neighborhoods and weigh what there is to do when you're tired and don't have plans for specific sights, Shinjuku afforded us souvenir shopping, temple flea markets, and a metric assload of restaurants so we didn't have to think too much but we also had a good time looking for nerdy toys at Yodobashi Camera.\n\nAs for Kyoto, the first thing you want to do is pick your base, depending on what you actually want to do. If most of the sights you really want to see are around Higashiyama (e.g. Gion, Kiymizudera, Yasaka, etc) stay there so you can walk and then take taxis or public transport to get to one or two locations further away. Or, if you want to take a lot of day trips, stay closer to downtown for fast access to the train station. I have to concur that 7 days is a lot if you're not taking day trips (I could have done 5 at most but 3 turned out not to be enough) but only *you* really know what you want to see. Do what's most interesting to *you*, and don't be afraid to say \"nah\" if something that would be too far out of the way isn't your thing. And, tbh, if you want to see bamboo and Arashiyama is the one out-of-the-way thing, go to Kodaiji instead. There's a gorgeous bamboo grove at the temple with a trail that winds through it past some lovely historical buildings and Nene's burial site, and it isn't all graffiti'd to hell from tourists. Aside from warding off temple burnout, there's a lot to see and enjoy in Kyoto, but it's much quieter than Osaka and Tokyo. The attractions are quiet. Museums and temples and temple museums. Great food and bar-hopping at night but during the day, a very quiet vibe. Plan accordingly, including whether you can really do Osaka as a day trip - sure, you can make it to the castle early enough, cram in the aquarium, and then spend an evening on Dotonbori before catching the late trains back but...is that enough?",

            "comment": "When were you going to active your JR pass? A 7 day pass probably just barely breaks even with this itinerary but only if you cover all shinkansen travel (unless you have some really far day trips planned in Kyoto).  If you go back to Tokyo on the 21st then the trip to Hakone and Kyoto would not be covered.  Realistically a JR pass might not be worth it and you should just buy individual tickets, or else you'll need to shorten the Kyoto time.  Buying the voucher in advance is usually around 4000 yen cheaper so people usually opt for that.\n\nThe first day is a good pace.  The National Museum is too expansive to try and see in one day (I spend 3 hours there and only covered 1 of the 3 buildings) so just spending the first half of the day in the museum/park and the rest of the day in Asakusa is feasible.\n\nThe second day is feasible, maybe even a little light unless you plan some extensive shopping in Ginza.  Meiji Shrine and Teamlabs are definitely opposite ends of the city but if thats all you have planned for that day its doable, I would just give yourself over an hour for getting between them.  You could move Teamlabs to the second day since its closer to the same area and go to the Pokemon Center in Ikebukuro or Shibuya instead on the third day.\n\nYou can buy the Hakone Free Pass online, but just purchasing it at Odawara station is easy and convenient.  Ueno is a good option to stay in due to its easy connection with the airport and its proximity to areas you want to go in the first few days.",

            "comment": "I think your Tokyo to Kyoto balance is way off, especially since you're not planning for anything more than a day trip to Osaka. I know you mentioned a relaxing time, but 7 days is a lot for Kyoto when you're only doing Tokyo for 3, especially when 1 or 2 of those might be affected by jet lag.\n\nJR Pass might not make any sense for you, either, on this current itinerary.",

            "comment": "I got the Hakone Free Pass and a quirk about it that I wasn\u2019t aware of was that the Free Pass is displayed via a website on your phone that needs to be connected to data. There is also an app, but it appeared to be only in Japanese and I struggled to navigate it, while the website was available in English. \n\nThe biggest issue with this is that I had an E-SIM and my partner didn\u2019t, which meant I had to keep hot spotting him and we had to keep reloading the page. Ultimately this was all manageable, but overall the experience was much different than using IC Cards and the JR Pass.",

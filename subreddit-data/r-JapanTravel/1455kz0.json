    "postText": "Hello,\n\nWe are heading on our second trip to Japan in mid-October. We went to Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima and Osaka in autumn last year and enjoyed it so much we immediately booked to go back.\n\nThis time around we want to start and end our trip in Tokyo, visiting Hokkaido and the Sendai area during our three week stay. \n\nWe would like to know whether it would be sensible to hire a car for the Hokkaido leg of our trip, rather than trying to travel from Hakodate to Lake Toya and Noribetsu, then onto Sapporo by train.\n\nHere's what we have planned for that part of the trip...\n\nThree Nights in Hakodate - explore the city, Morning Market, Mount Hakodate, venture to Onuma Park by train.\n\nPick up a hire car?\n\nOne Night in Lake Toya - volcano museum, Usuzan Ropeway.\n\nOne Night in Noribetsu - explore Hell Valley, Bear Park and Ainu Village via ropeway.\n\nReturn the hire car to New Chitose Airport on the way to Sapporo?\n\nThree Nights in Sapporo - staying near Shin Sapporo station. Explore the city, day trip to Otaru.\n\nIf we did the whole trip by train we figured we'd have to skip doing a day trip from Sapporo to Biei and Furano, but if we hired a car we could take a trip out there from our Sapporo hotel (where there is parking available).\n\nIs a day trip to Biei and Furano worth it in late October? Or would the day be better spent in Sapporo?\n\nIt would be great to hear from people who've done a similar trip as we're worried that infrequent trains and buses might make travelling by public transport difficult.\n\nThank you!",

I think having a car gave us a lot more freedom and opportunity to visit things or even just drive through the countryside which was beautiful. Not sure about Furano in October, last month when we went there were no flowers and not that much to do if I\u2019m being honest. I think it would have been much better if we went when the flowers are in bloom.",

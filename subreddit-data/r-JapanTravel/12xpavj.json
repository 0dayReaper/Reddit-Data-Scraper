    "postText": "Hi All. Travelling to Tokyo in October for 9 nights and plan to spend 6 nights in Tokyo then head to Osaka/Kyoto for 3 nights before heading back home. \n\nWe will be flying into Narita early afternoon of 10/21 and staying in the Ginza area. After the 6th night we plan to take the train to Osaka where we will be staying and travelling to Kyoto 2 of those days. My idea is to stay in Osaka for dinner/night life although most of our day activities will be in Kyoto. Good idea?\n\nAdditionally, when we travel we usually try to allocate a couple of hours in the evening to rest a bit before heading to dinner (8pmish) and out that night. Although I know some days that's not possible. For the most part we adjust our itineraries as we go, but I like to have a good general idea of what we can do each day. \n\nFor the days in Kyoto - those days are probably jam packed just because of the small amount of time we have.\n\nItinerary as follows:\n\n**10/21**\n\nArrive into Narita around 2:30 PM\n\nCheck into hotel in Ginza that late afternoon/evening\n\nExplore a bit of Ginza\n\nDinner possibly at Birdland or somewhere within the general area\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/22** \\- This day might be a little light while we get adjusted to the time and city?\n\nShibuya Crossing\n\nHachiko Memorial Statue\n\nShibuya Center Gai\n\nMega don Quijote\n\nNintendo Tokyo Store\n\nLunch\n\nAsakura House\n\n*Any other Recommendations?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/23**\n\nZozo-Ji Temple\n\nTokyo Tower\n\nLunch at Nodaiwa Azabu Likura Honten (If possible)\n\nMori Art Musuem\n\nSuntory Art Museum\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/24**\n\nTsukiji Outer Market (Breakfast/snacks)\n\nTeam Lab\n\nManten Sushi Lunch\n\nExplore Shimokitazawa Neighborhood\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/25**\n\nSenso Ji Temple\n\nAsakusa / Nakamise Dori Street\n\nTokyo Skytree\n\nLunch\n\nTokyo National Museum\n\nAkihabara Neighborhood\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/26**\n\nMeiji Jingu Shrine\n\nTakeshita Street\n\nTokyu Plaza Omotesando\n\nCat Street\n\nLunch at Florilege\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Government Building\n\nKusama Museum\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/27**\n\n9:00 AM train to Osaka\n\nCheck into hotel if possible\n\nLunch\n\nExplore Osaka\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/28**\n\nTrain to Kyoto\n\nKitano Tenmangu Shrine\n\nKinkaku-Ji Temple\n\nHigashiyama Jisho-ji / Ginkakuji\n\nLunch at Omen?\n\nPhilosopher's Path\n\nEikan-do Zenrin-ji Temple\n\nZanzen-ji\n\nKiyomizu-dera Temple\n\nFushimi Inari Taisha\n\nDinner at Monk\n\nTrain back to Osaka around 10pm\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/29**\n\nArashiyama Bamboo Forest\n\nNijo Castle\n\nNishiki Market Lunch\n\nPontocho Street\n\nHanamikoji Street\n\nGion Area\n\nYasaka Shrine\n\nKodai-ji Temple\n\nIshibe-koji Alley Lane\n\nNinenzaka Slope\n\nSanenzaka Slope\n\nTrain back to Osaka around 7pm\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10/30**\n\nTrain from Osaka back to Tokyo at 11:30?\n\nTrain from Tokyo to Narita\n\nFly out of Narita around 5:30 PM",

But one thing you probably already know is that the trains shut down around midnight. The real party is in Shinjuku and it doesn\u2019t start until midnight. It\u2019s likely an expensive cab ride back to Ginaza. Just some food for thought.\n\nMake sure to get to the Bamboo Forest early if you want good pics. Or, a good hack is to go to Tenryuji Temple to get pictures in their less crowded (empty) bamboo forest. These are walking distance from each other.",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI\u2019ll be in Tokyo early June and was looking to buy tickets for at least one of the days of the 72nd All-Japan University Baseball Championship, which is being held in Tokyo Dome on June 5-7 according to https://www.tokyo-dome.co.jp/en/tourists/dome/events.html\n\nIs there some way to buy tickets in advance? I could not find a way, so I fear that I\u2019d have to find a website in Japanese to do so (which I struggle to do).",

Guessing it'll probably not be the easiest (or cheapest) to get tickets if it's playoffs, so I am definitely envious if you get to go to any baseball game! hah Goodluck!",

    "postText": "Hello, \n\nFixing the plans for November Japan visit. SO is really interested in photography and Fuji views seems accessible from Tokyo through day trips. We also have plans for Hakone. Since we will be coming from Kyoto, here is what I was thinking. \n\nNov 9th -&gt; 7PM Shinkansen from Kyoto to Odawara, Late Checkin to local hotel,\n\nNov 10th -&gt; start early, Odawara to Hakone Yumoto, forward luggage to Tokyo, bus to Amazake Cafe, Hike to Lake Ashi, Visit Shrine, Take ship tour, Topendai Ropeway to top, have lunch, spend time at open air museum in Gora, Stay in Gora. \n\nWe want to get a Ryokan/onsen experience so would like to checkin by 5PM. \n\nNov 11th -&gt; Leave Ryokan by 10, Hokane Venetian museum, Travel to Gotemba -&gt; Lake Kawaguchiko, Stay in the area, this allows us to beat the crowds early to famous spots ? \n\nNov 12th -&gt;  Take Fuji ropeway, Chuerieto pagoda, Bike around the lake, leave for Tokyo in the evening. \n\nQueries -&gt;\n\n1. Does the Nov 10th look feasible for Activities considering we are coming from Kyoto day before to the area \n2. Do you recommend we go to Lake Kawaguchiko through Tokyo day trip by leaving on 10th to Tokyo or does above plan look feasible. ? This does save us some time by not going to Tokyo.",

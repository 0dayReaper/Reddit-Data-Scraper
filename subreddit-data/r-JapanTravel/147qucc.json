Personally if I went on this trip I would be miserable getting shoved from spot to spot without being able to enjoy my time somewhere.\n\nMy suggestion is find the most important things for you to see and put them on the schedule. Anything else that you want to see but arent critical you can add to another list by area so if you finish something and dont know what to do next you pick one of the destinations you had listed nearby.",

As long as we knew where we are heading on that day, we just rely on google map on the timing. I planned 2hrs for Asakusa, guess what, that place is so beautiful and so many things to see/eat that we took way longer (almost 4hrs).

Your itinerary is so rigid and it doesn't look like you will be enjoying any of those places.\n\nI see a lot of first time travelers to Japan are way too ambitious with their itineraries, especially those who visits for less than 14 days. Japan is about taking in the culture, enjoying your time and exploration, not some 'i'm gonna visit this place on this specific hour and leave on this specific hour'",

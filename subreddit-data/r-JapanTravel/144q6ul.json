No, the crowd will be too much just to move through.\n\nEdit; I don't recommend waiting for the procession because it gets really hot in July.",

The time is accurate as this aligns with the 2023 seated ticket time that they are selling as well https://images.app.goo.gl/iwTvh48oK5B8y4qg8\n\nI personally decided against buying the ticket as I don\u2019t intend to sit for an hour in hot sun. I will be just be there around the festival (maybe half an hour early to the arrival), take some photos and be on my way.",

It also make no sense to use the ropeway in day 6 and again on day 7 for Owakudani. I would get a ryokan/hotel around Gora and only check the open air museum on day 6 and do the rest on day 7. Also, if you have time, consider getting to Hakone on day 7 and use the Romancecar to Tokyo on day 8, that would give you an extra day to visit around Kansai, like a day trip to Nara.\n\nFor the extra day, could be Himeji, Okayama/Kurashiki, Onomichi. Depends on what you are looking for.",

I\u2019ll relook at my day 6 itinerary again, I think I underestimated the time. Hakone on day 7 and using the romance car to get back to Tokyo instead of the jr train seems like a fantastic idea, thank you!!",

Used the balcony onsen, got massages, had dinner at the hotel. We didn\u2019t need to leave. \n\nWe also could\u2019ve spent a week in Kyoto. We left Kyoto and did two days in Osaka and I wish we had more time in Kyoto. It\u2019s the best!",

If my itinerary permits, I\u2019d love to do a day trip to Ine (2.5hours form Kyoto).",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\n**TLDR/EDIT: To clarify, I already bought the JR Pass, but I wanted to know whether to buy another pass (e.g Tokyo Subway Ticket) or just use a Suica Card in addition.** \n\nI will be going to Japan next month. I bought the **JR Pass** as I will be going to Osaka. I am aware that the JR Pass does not cover many lines in Tokyo, therefore I am trying to decide whether I should utilize a Suica/Passmo card rather than just buying a pass (such as the Tokyo 1/3 Day Pass).\n\nAre you able to help me decide if using the **IC card** is better or **buy a pass** (not sure which pass to buy though - it is so overwhelming).Thank you in advance!\n\nHere is my itinerary:\n\n    DAY 1 - TOKYO\n\n* Arriving midnight at **Haneda Airport**. Since trains are not running past midnight, I might sleep there till morning then do a day trip in Tokyo before my hotel check-in.\n* **Minato** (Zojo-ji Temple)\n* **Ginza** (Shopping)\n* Hotel at **Roppongi**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    DAY 2 - TOKYO\n\n* Visit **Yokohama** Ramen Museum\n* Visit **Asakusa**\n   * Asakusa Shrine\n   * Sensoji Temple\n* Maybe visit **Akihabara**\n* Go back to **Roppongi** hotel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    DAY 3 -TOKYO/KYOTO\n\n* Visit Nezu Shrine\n* Travel to **Kyoto**\n* Hotel near **Kyoto Station**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    DAY 4 - KYOTO/OSAKA\n\n* Visit Kiyomizu-Dera Temple\n* **Gion**\n* Yasaka Shrine\n* Travel to **Osaka**\n* Hotel near Shin-Osaka Station\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    DAY 5 - OSAKA\n\n* Osaka Castle\n* **Shinsekai**\n* Dotonbori, Shinsaibashi and Amerikamura\n* Hotel near **Shin-Osaka** Station\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    DAY 6 - OSAKA\n\n* Universal Studios\n* Travel back to **Tokyo** at night (unsure where yet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    DAY 7 - TOKYO\n\n* Shibuya\n* Harajuku\n* Go to Hilton Airport for Hotel at **Narita** Airport",

It saves plenty of money (as long as you aren\u2019t using it at konbini stores and every vending machine :D). \n\nFor tokyo, your Ginza time seems sparse. Ginza is only a small area of central Tokyo. I suggest the imperial gardens and hibiya park if you run out of luxury stores lol \n\nFor Shibuya, you can add Miyashita Park if you\u2019re feeling a cafe. I recommend spending time in Shibuya, then walking and seeing Yoyogi Park (~10 min walk from shibuya crossing) on your way to Harajuku. Yoyogi Park is huge and has many many activities, and then connects to Harajuku. Make a stop at Meiji-Jingu which is also on the way to Harajuku. I haven\u2019t explored much of Harajuku so I can\u2019t say much about it but you can pick up the trains there to go back to shibuya station or wherever you need to go. Shinjuku is also an easy stop from shibuya - definitely recommend going to the 45th floor of the Tokyo Metropolis Building if you have time. \n\nSeems like a good trip. Enjoy!!",

The biggest difference I saw was the delay on getting a ticket for me, but I got the jr pass which cleared that. Also there is a minimum needed to get a refuse of the money you put on the ic card but there is still a fee. I believe using cash seems to help understand the train system as well as paying for things and interacting with people. Oh! And someone with the ic card can\u2019t use the remaining amount to pay for the train ticket, instead has to use cash. You need to have enough for the ic card, you can\u2019t use two transactions, which makes thing a little harder when trying to empty out the card itself.",

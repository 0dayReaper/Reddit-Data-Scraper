    "postText": "Hi, I'm taking my parents to Japan for a week in early August. They're in their 60s and relatively fit. I've been to Japan several times, but not in 10 years. So I'm having a little trouble remembering how long things will take. I'm also trying to find things they would enjoy seeing or doing. My dad is into Japanese history/ships. They haven't traveled this far before and only know of Japan through my love of the culture / Pokemon / Ghibli.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking. I'd also appreciate your suggestions for any events, places, or restaurants. I can also rearrange the order of things.\n\n**Day 0 (Monday, July 31):**\n\n* Arrive at Haneda airport at 5:25 PM\n* Get to apartment at Mimaru Suites, in Asakusa\n* Eat dinner somewhere around the Asakusa Shrine, go to bed\n\n**Day 1 (Tuesday, August 1):**\n\n* Morning:\n   * Ueno Park\n   * Tokyo National Museum and/or Ueno Zoo\n* Afternoon:\n   * Tokyo Skytree (give them a view of all Tokyo)\n* Evening:\n   * Asakusha Shrineenso Ji Temple / Kaminarimon Gate\n   * Nakamise Shopping District\n\n**Day 2 (Wednesday, August 2):**\n\n* Morning: Shibuya\n   * Shibuya Crossing (see around 7:00 during rush hour)\n   * Hachiko\n   * Shibuya Sky\n   * Meiji Shrine\n* Afternoon: Akihabara\n   * Owl cafe \"Akiba Fukurou\" (or any other themed cafe)\n   * Pop in to Yodobashi Camera for a bit\n   * Walk the streets for a little bit\n* Evening: Ginza\n   * See a kabuki show at Kabukiza Theatre (shows are at 4:00 PM I believe)\n   * Pokemon Cafe @ Pokemon Center Tokyo DX (reservations go until 9 PM)\n\n**Day 3 (Thursday, August 3):**\n\n* Disneyland (my parents live near Disneyland Anaheim, so it'll just be a couple hours here to check it out)\n* DisneySea (the majority of the day)\n\n**Day 4 (Friday, August 4):**\n\n* Morning: Ghibli museum (3 hrs)\n* Afternoon/evening: Odaiba\n   * Take Tokyo River Cruise from Asakusa Pier to Odaiba Seaside Park\n   * Check out Odaiba\n   * Watch Ghibli's \"How Do You Live?\" at the movie theater on Odaiba\n\n**Day 5 (Saturday, August 5):** Yokohama\n\n* Hakkeijima Sea Paradise\n* Cosmo World\n* Pokemon Center Yokohama\n* Yokohama Chinatown\n* Red Brick Warehouse\n\n**Day 6 (Sunday, August 6):** Hiroshima (Anniversary of Bomb Drop)\n\n* Take first bullet train from Tokyo to Hiroshima\n* Miyojima Island\n* Hiroshima Peace Museum\n* Hiroshima Toro Nagashi event (6:00 to 9:00 PM)\n* Stay overnight at a hotel in Hiroshima\n\n**Day 7 (Monday, August 7):** Kyoto\n\n* Take first bullet train from Hiroshima to Kyoto\n* Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine\n* Sagano Bamboo Forest\n* Whatever else -- they don't want to see too many temples\n* Tea ceremony? Really want to take them to one at some point during the trip.\n* Some kind of geisha show?\n* Take last bullet train from Kyoto back to Tokyo\n\n**Day 8 (Tuesday, August 8):** Parents going home\n\n* Morning: Explore Tokyo Station\n* Afternoon: Go to Haneda airport, my parents are flying out at 5:00 PM\n\n**Left out:**\n\n* Mt. Fuji\n* Gyoen National Garden (Shinjuku)\n* Imperial Palace\n\nI will be in Japan another week for the Pokemon Worlds event, so there are other things I'll do myself during that time that my parents probably won't enjoy as much.\n\nThank you for any suggestions you can provide!",

They are forced to stay awake (they are nocturnal) and chained to fake trees without access to water so that they don't create waste. There are some animal cafes which are rescue-focussed but the majority are businesses that don't care if the animals live or die.",

So there are eight hours to visit Miyajima island (which is not just the shrine), Hiroshima Peace Museum / Park, eat lunch, eat dinner, and travel between several places. The trip between central Hiroshima &lt;-&gt; Miyajima is more than 30 minutes. And bedtime won't be until 10pm, after having woken up at 5am or earlier.\n\n* Day 7: After going to bed at 10pm the previous night there is now a need to wake up in time for the 6:20 Hikari to arrive in Kyoto at 9am. Then there are two very crowded sights 30 minutes apart, a tea ceremony and a show (both of which typically happen near Gion which is near neither sight nor the train station). This means you guys will be constantly moving around until sitting down on the last train at 9pm.\n\nPerhaps you and your parents are real fitness gurus and I am seriously underestimating your capacity to function in the heat and humidity of Japan in August. In which case, more power to you and I hope the trip goes brilliantly. All I'm saying is that I am a young, able bodied, and very fast traveler, and still would not do it like this.",

On a very long day which involves spending around the same amount of time on various modes of transport. \n\nI am really struggling to see how this is worth it since you're not seeing anything that is \"special\" to August 6 (i.e., the lantern stuff) other than physically being there on the day itself. Unless you have a personal connection to the atomic bomb event or will never visit Japan again, just save Hiroshima for the next trip.",

    "postText": "EDIT: My friends and I agreed to extending the trip to the 18th, so we will be adjusting the itinerary and allowing for more time. Especially in the Kansai region!  Appreciate all the feedback!\n\nHello, All! I can finally say that two friends (M30 and M35)  and I (M30) will be taking our first trip to Japan this summer. Honestly a dream come true, and I can hardly wait to soak in all of the culture and cuisine! Our trip will be between July 30th- August 15th. We won't arrive until July 31st during the afternoon.\n\nWe have only 5 locations for our trip. All tickets and lodgings are booked. Attractions and locations that require reservations will be booked late June/early July. All of our main luggage will be handled by shipping for the most part so we can travel as freely as possible. We will also have a two week JR pass. All of the price checks I did made it seem worth it for how much we'll use them.\n\nThe more research I did, the more I realized how little time two weeks is to actually do as much as I have planned. I'm contemplating extended the trip an extra 3 days IF POSSIBLE so as to alleviate the nonstop pace I'm assuming we'll have to be moving at. Also, if there are any recommendations for something other than what I have, please feel free to share!\n\nAlso! My itinerary is actually super detailed, even listing specific restaurants and cafes i hope for us to go to. I imagine weather, availability, or any number of issues can get in the way, especially with all of the dining options I have listed. I packed into each day what I felt was feasible after going over travel distances, average transportation times, and factoring in potential delays and how tired we might be. Feel free to drop nuggets of wisdom or recommendations! Thank you all in advance!\n\n\n\n\nTOKYO:  7 Days (6 1/2 days)\n\n\n\n[  ] Day 1- July 30th/31st: Arrival @ Narita and Shinjuku.\n\nFlight Arrival time 1640 @ Narita Airport -&gt; Explore airport -&gt; Get our SUICA -&gt; Narita Express to JR Shinjuku -&gt; Snack @ Gourmet Curry Bon Gout -&gt; Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for our first view of Tokyo skyline -&gt; Check into Nishi Shinjuku Mystays -&gt; Disney Flagship Tokyo Store -&gt; Dinner @ Tsuru Ton Tan -&gt; Kabukicho -&gt; Omoide Yokocho\n\n\n\n[  ] Day 2- August 1st: Harajuku and Shibuya.\n\nBreakfast in Hotel -&gt; Meiji Shrine -&gt; Yoyogi park -&gt; Mipig Cafe -&gt; Takeshita Street -&gt; Lunch @ Gyukatsu Motomura Harajuku -&gt; grab a famous Harajuku Crepe -&gt; Omote Sando street -&gt; A HAPPY Pancake Omotesando -&gt; Miyashita Park -&gt; Hachiko Memorial Statue -&gt; Shibuya Crossing -&gt; Shibuya 109 -&gt; Magnet for the One Piece store and rooftop view of Shibuya Crossing -&gt; Mega Don Quijote -&gt; Shibuya Sky -&gt; Shibuya center-gai \n\n\n\n[  ] Day 3- August 2nd: Ikebukuro, Akihabara &amp; Tokyo Tower.\n\nIkebukuro Seibu Rooftop food and garden -&gt; Animate Ikebukuro -&gt; Snack @ Hachi Kuma Cafe -&gt; Sunshine City -&gt; Yamanote Line to Akihabara -&gt; Late lunch @ Kikanbo Ramen -&gt; FF Eorzea Cafe -&gt; Akihabara Gamers and Super Potato -&gt; TAITO Station Akihabara -&gt; Dinner @ Wagyu Burger -&gt; Tokyo Tower\n\n\n\n[  ] Day 4- August 3rd: Day Trip to Nagaoka Grand Hanabi Festival.\n\nMorning @ Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden -&gt; Appetizer @ Cafe Aaliya -&gt; Lunch @ Attachment Italian Cuisine -&gt; JR to Nagaoka for Hanabi Festival \ud83c\udf86 \ud83c\udf87 \ud83e\udde8\ud83e\udd58\ud83c\udf75\ud83c\udf61\ud83c\udf63\ud83c\udf59\ud83c\udf5b\ud83c\udf62\ud83c\udf5c\ud83c\udf7a\ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf8a\n\n\n\n[  ] Day 5- August 4th: Asakusa, Imperial Palace, &amp; Odaiba.\n\nNakamise Street and Senso-ji Temple -&gt; Lunch @ Kura-Sushi -&gt; Train to Tokyo Station -&gt; Explore Kokyo Gaien International Garden and East Garden -&gt; Historical Kikyo-mon Gate -&gt; Views of Imperial Palace &gt; Tokyo Art Aquarium -&gt; Walk to Shin Godzilla Statue -&gt; Train to Odaiba -&gt; Teamlab Planets -&gt; Unicorn Gundam Statue and Statue of Liberty -&gt; Rainbow Bridge Observation Deck\n\n\n\n[  ] Day 6- August 5th: DisneySea.\n\nStart the morning with Starbucks Reserve Roastery to prep for DisneySea\n\n\n\n[  ] Day 7- August 6th (My birthday!) : Just enjoy Tokyo.\n\nCapyneko Cafe -&gt; Uobei Sushi -&gt; Tokyo Skytree (And anything we might not have had the chance to do on prior days)\n\n\n\n\nFUJIKAWAGUCHIKO: 1 Day\n\n\n\n[  ] Day 8- August 7th: My birthday gift to myself with a stay at Kozantei Ubuya.\n \nArakura Fuji Sengen -&gt; Mt.

            "comment": "You've got a very, very busy itinerary there. I'm going to have to be a bit of a downer here because it sounds like you're expectations of Japan is way high. \n\nProbably the biggest change I would do is to remove all your food destinations, perhaps leave one or two that you really, really want to go to and are able to make reservations for. Because you don't just drop in to a well known restaurant; you'll almost always find a line or they'll flat out reject you if they are booked out. I find it much more fulfilling taking a chance with Japan's back alleys, there is good food literally everywhere... I recently discovered an \"alleyway\" full of restaurants built under the train bridges in Shimbashi, and another awesome tonkotsu restaurant in some random office building in the same area (I probably couldn't find it again even if I tried).\n\nDay 1: I would temper your expectations. You're arriving relatively late in the day, depending on luck immigrating could be several minutes or more than 2 hours, the NEX takes 1.5 hours to get you to Shinjuku, and Shinjuku station is a massive beast that almost everyone will get lost in (it's a kilometre long and has lots of tunnels and exits).\n\nDay 9: How are you getting from Kawaguchiko to Osaka? That's quite an awkward route that will probably take you half a day.\n\nDay 12: That day is insane.\n\nFinally, Obon is happening during your trip. You might be able to see some cool celebrations, but you'll also encounter much busier attractions and transport. https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2286.html",

Luckily our hotel is fairly close to Gion, so I tried to center our afternoon only around there. You're definitely right, though, and I'm hoping to be able to spend a few more days on the trip if possible specifically to add an extra day in Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo, respectively.",

I planned the route from Ubuya starting from an 8:30 departure after breakfast. We catch the bus to Kwaguchiko station which starts an almost 5 hour journey that gets us to Osaka by around 1:30ish. I really do want to add a few days to ease the transitional days for Osaka and Kyoto if anything. Otherwise, I have sort of tempered my expectations regarding not completing everything.\n\nI actually had heard about Obon, which lead me to believe that was way all of my reservations and certain accommodations were so pricey even though I booked months in advance \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05.

It is absolutely nothing like southern California. \n\nThe heat and humidity are inescapable.  In San Diego or even in Palm Springs you can escape a lot of heat by just getting some shade.  Nights immediately cool down because of the dry desert climate.  In Japan in summer There is no escape except the air conditioned malls and shops and your cooler in your apt.",

Summer weather in San Diego is a dream. Summer weather in my town is hell. Look up the Imperial Valley. El Centro, CA. I legitimately live in a desert \ud83d\ude05. Not saying Japan will be a cake walk as I'm not used to humidity, but I am used to extremely high, record breaking heat. I also work near Palm Springs in Indio. It's only a little over an hour from where I live, but temperatures here still don't get as high as where I actually live.\n\nHaving said that, I'm definitely toning down on how much we'll be outside during the hot parts of the day for our trip. I was much to optimistic about how much walking we'll probably be doing.\n\nI do hope that maybe I can make that move someday like you have though!",

That\u2019ll be your whole clothed body.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have fun but it\u2019s something to really think about and prepare for! Like the clothes you pack, which parts of the day you\u2019re doing the most walking, where you\u2019re staying and the state of their aircon, what you carry on you and what nearby indoor/underground fun places there are in each area you visit just in case it becomes too oppressive.",

Uniqlo has a clothing line called airism which are affordable and designed to combat the Japanese summer, you can use minty fresh goldbond on your body, wear synthetic sporty underpants, use cooling aerosols, keep a small microfiber towel on you for dabbing off sweat, wear sandals or light running shoes with a mesh fabric etc. The key really is very fast drying, ultra-breathable attire. \n\nAlso helps that malls and train stations are often huge and sprawling with lots to check out, and that every other street corner has a vending machine with cold beverages. \n\nConsider drafting a plan B itinerary which takes you further north in case you guys feel it\u2019s just too much after arriving - it\u2019s significantly milder up towards aomori/sapporo.",

But for sure some of these days are unrealistic in terms of the amount of time it will take to get from place to place and still enjoy them. An example is Day 1, we landed at the same time and didn't end up getting to our hotel in Shinjuku til 9PM after navigating the airport and transit systems. Depending on where you are flying in from, you might be extremely tired and jet-lagged (we had been traveling for 35 hours at that point). I would recommend identifying one place that you might want to grab a snack or a quick meal from that evening and *maybe* one area to do a quick walk-through if there's time and if you and your travel partners have the energy. Also, how much luggage are you each bringing? You're going to drag all of your luggage to the Metropolitan government building prior to checking into your hotel? If you are set on that, I would try to find a coin locker at Shinjuku station or something along those lines. \n\nAre your travel partners similar to you in terms of their level of planning, etc.? If someone I was traveling with showed me an itinerary this packed I would be less than keen to travel with them, tbh.",

I have an extra day or so in Tokyo to do things we couldn't do before, so if we don't hit everything on the itinerary, they can always be done on another day. The days I'm really worried about are the transitional days to Osaka and Kyoto.\n\nI'm bring one large suitcase, one carry-on, and a small travel bag. I advised my friends to do the same. We will be utilizing shipping for our luggage to our accommodations, and I've ensured that we will be able to do so between where we'll be staying at so we pretty much only have to worry about our smaller travel backpacks which are fairly small. Only large enough for essentials and about one day worth of clothes. This allows us the freedom to just go and start instead of worrying about checking in and hauling our luggage.\n\nMy friends are definitely not at the same level of planning as me, which is why I've taken the liberty of extensively planning everything for them. Even going so far as to include emergency numbers and contacts for local authorities as well as our embassy contacts in the different regions. I've shared the itinerary with them, as well as all of the locations outlined on maps, so they are aware that it is packed.  I am trying to potentially add 3 days if we can. If not, then I realize we will definitely be cutting out a chunk of activities",

After all of the advice given here, I'm hard at work on rearranging this to be much more of an experience driven and relaxing vacation instead of a high speed race. We managed to add 3 more days to the trip. Let my friends know that even with trimming down some of the itinerary, having that extra time will help considering the heat and how busy it will be. They agreed. The first night, for example, is simple going to be us checking in and maybe checking out Kabukicho for a bit just to take in the sights.",

We saw mayyyybe a third of of things I had pinned but prioritized a couple of must-dos each day and worked around them. That gave us lots of options in case something on the list took less time than we were expecting, but reduced the pressure to run from spot to spot without relaxing and enjoying our experience. Even with this pace, we walked 35,000 steps a day on average (in april, when the temperatures were cooler). \n\nAlso, last consideration is that in lots of these areas there are beautiful places to see, good food to eat, and random entertainments that you don't even know about yet! Freeing up some time in the itinerary to just relax will allow you to immerse yourself in those things as well.",

It'll arrive next say, and we'll be in Tokyo for about 7 days. Then I'm shipping them from our hotel to a 7/11 (or the next nearest holding area) near our AirBnB in Osaka in Dotonbori. From same with our Hotel in Kyoto, and from Kyoto, either to our last hotel, or straight to the airport depending on how those last two days turn out. At the most, we'll only have our luggage on any transportation on our way to Haneda airport when we go home.\n\nI definitely did not want to be tied down by luggage, or even worse- be a tourist carrying luggage all over the place and being inconsiderate of space.",

Arashiyama is also a must, but detours like Zao Daigongen and Daihikaku Senk\u014dji are also more in the moment decisions that I'm willing to skip for the sake of time and energy",

Have 2 or 3 more options nearby saved in google maps. Do this for everything.\nAvoid transfer (travelling with your luggage) during morning and evening rush hour in major metropolitan areas, especially Tokyo. If you can, get up early and get it done 7 am. All Hotels will hold your luggage until check-in at 3 pm and you can use the day.\nYou can buy most JR tickets or reserve seats for other local trains online.

My aunt is like this and loves to plan out every step.  OTOH if someone sent me this I would not even consider it.  I moved to Japan with a bag and no plan at 22 in 2005 and then ended up living there for 10 years.  The most I can do for planning is to rent a room beforehand and then everything else is just \u201clet\u2019s see when we get there\u201d.  It\u2019s just how I like to enjoy trips.  I like feeling out local super markets to experience a day in the life or just wandering around aimlessly.\n\nAgain it totally depends on personality and there\u2019s a wide spectrum between your approach and mine, and I\u2019m sure you know your friends way better than I do!

I envy your ability to be able to just uproot yourself like that. I imagine there may have been hardships, but I'm sure the experience was amazing.\n\nI've been planning this trip so meticulously because of the short amount of time we have. We can always come back in the future if we're so blessed to be able to do so, but two weeks is such a short time, and I'd love to maximize it by at least having the information to make informed decisions about how we'd likely most enjoy spending our time. Of course, I also see how it's less enjoyment in the moment, so I'm trying to find a nice balance now.",

Japanese Hanabi-taikai are absolutely amazing and will absolutely blow away anything you have ever seen in the states or anywhere else.  If you want to make the most of that experience, I strongly recommend that you go several hours before the start and scope out a good spot to sit.  Bring a tarp/blanket and do a picnic with conbini food and beer and just chill and chat with the people around you.  We used to go to several of these every summer, and this is the one biiig thing I miss about no longer regularly visiting in summer; this and the massive summer rainstorms.",

We've been to Tokyo, Hida-Furakawa, Gero, Takayama, Kyoto, and we're heading to Nara today.\n\nWe had about one tenth as much planned as you and we've been struggling accomplish it. Maybe its just us, but I wanted to give you a heads up. You won't likely be able to just arrive at your destination and experience what you want. There will be a wait.\n\nTokyo is so huge that you'll likely have a lot of time on the metro for all of those destinations. It probably took us a total of 5-6 hours after landing to get through customs, get on our train, find a taxi, and make it to our hotel in Shinjuku. We did really enjoy Omoide Yokocho, but go early because it is absolutely packed and hard to find a seat. Also, bring a plastic sack to strip your clothes into until you find laundry service somewhere. They will be saturated with delicious stinky oil.\n\nThe JR Pass was well worth it for us and I'm pretty sure it will be for you too.",

I will be there during a high season, but I don't think it'll be AS busy as Cherry Blossom season. We're also going to be grounded more often with less destinations, so less overall traveling. \n\nYou're definitely still correct, though, that I over planned! We're adding a few days and trimming the itinerary to be more relaxed.\n\nOhhh if you don't mind sharing your transition from airport to hotel and why it took so long, can you give me a breakdown? Also, we won't have any luggage on as it'll be shipped, so we won't be going straight to our hotel if we manage to have any time.\n\nGlad to hear you recommended the JR pass for us! I think it will, too. Considering how busy it may be consider they've also just increased the price starting in Fall, do you think we should go for green car passes? I was considering it",

(My wife and I are global entry, signed up for Iris and clear; it won't save you.) Then, even if you have your JR Pass voucher, that just locks in your price. You'll need to stand in one of the two JR rail offices under Narita to claim your pass, but they can help you with your first set of tickets while you're there. You don't need tickets with the pass but it does help with initially understanding their systems. That was another hour. You'll probably have a 30 minute wait for a good train. That train will get you to Tokyo station in 1.5 hours. Then you'll need to figure out how to get to Shinjuku (JR Pass doesn't work for any city metro) and feed your starving travel companion.\nI don't think green car would be worth it unless you were moving your luggage yourself, during peak times, on the major lines. Most JR rails we were on didn't have a green car, and it still won't get you into the Nozomi. The standard seats on the Hikari (where I actually saw green cars) were plenty spacious and comfortable.",

That way it'll still be active by the time we make our final return back to Tokyo from Kyoto. We'll probably just exchange our vouchers in Tokyo at Shinjuku station the day before or the day of the Festival. I think that will be easier. They even recommend using a different station than Tokyo Station or Narita as they are usually super busy in comparison.\n\nAnd when it comes to the N'EX, we're going to use the ticket machine, and we're just going to use SUICA for the first few days of train fare. I have watched a few videos on how the ticketing system works, as well as how JR passes work, and I'll probably do many refreshers even before we step on the plane.

            "comment": "Yeah... That trip kind of looks like hell to be honest. I don't even think three extra days would be enough to fit all that in with any kind of comfort. (Experience, 3 trips to Japan, including a 3.5 week one solo. Could speak Japanese. Living in Japan, Tokyo &amp; Osaka for 17 years)\n\nLate July and August. It's going to be hot, hot and humid. I'm not sure where you are from, but trying to do that much without time to cool off is going to be rough. For days like you have planned, I'll often bring multiple t-shirts, a towel and sometimes even a change of shorts or pants. Do you have time planned to do laundry at all? I see you are in southern California. The humidity is going to be a shock. Summer in Japan... it's like a sauna in hell.\n\nI think I saw someone else say something about cutting out a lot of the specific food destinations. Japan is filled with great food, and if you are look at youtube or travel guides the specific destinations will probably be crowded. Just looking at some of your cafes, that looks like a LOT of sweets.\n\nDay 1: You are going to arrive in shinjuku far later than you expect, Disney store will probably be closed by the time you get there. Skip it anyway if you are going to Disney sea later. You aren't going to have time to eat twice. You might find some time to go to Kabuki-cho or Omoide yokocho. The later can be a bit tricky to find the right place.\n\n2: way too many sweets. I think you underestimate the size of the shrine and park areas. Maybe you can just walk in a bit and head back out, but no real time to look around. The rest of it just seems like a bit of overkill. Miyashita is nicer now. Check out the crossing, everyone goes. You seem like you might be doing a lot of shopping early on in the trip and that's a lot of crap to deal with, even if you are sending it around. How much luggage are you bringing?\n\n3: Personal advice, skip some of the theme cafes and get some real food. Sunshine is a huge place just even to walk around. The rooftop garden doesn't open until 10am which seems late from the early starts you seem to talking about. It's probably going to be more like dinner by the time you get to Akihabara.\n\n4: I have not been to that festival, but I know how fireworks are in Japan, that's a two hour trip, to a massive festival and it's going to be packed. You'd better have your tickets ahead of time. The non-reserved cars are going to be hell. Are you sure you can even make it back after it's over? Just getting back to the station might take hours.\n\n5: Way too much for one day. Odaiba takes some time to get to and probably should be most of a day on it's own. I don't really think that's doable. The imperial gardens aren't that impressive, especially if you are going to Kyoto, I used to work there and went there for lunch often. You can't actually see any of the imperial palace at all. The art aquarium is in Ginza which is a good walk away and the Godzilla statue is back the other way again. I think it's going to take you a lot longer getting to the places than you expect.\n\nOne thing which I think might be more doable, get to Asakusa early, check the river bus schedule and maybe get tickets. Explore Asakusa and take the river bus down to Odaiba. Honestly, it's probably a better cruise than most of what I see on your schedule, it will drop you off not far from the statue of liberty.[https://www.suijobus.co.jp/en/cruise/#place-info](https://www.suijobus.co.jp/en/cruise/#place-info)\n\n6: get there as early as you can, probably 45-30 minutes before the gates open if possible. It makes using the fast passes much easier.\n\n7: Kichijoji to the Skytree is an hour train ride alone, those are on completely opposite sides of the city.  There are 1000s of good sushi places in Tokyo, just pick something that's convenient (and somewhat busy, same goes for ramen). If you are heading to Kichijoji why not check out Nakano broadway. Honestly, I think it's more interesting for anime related stuff than your destinations in Ikebukuro or Akihabara and the cafes in that building are probably more interesting that most of what you have planned already.\n\nSkytree is expensive and kind of a tourist trap, but interesting. It's near Asakusa though, making the two go together rather well.\n\n8: If you are treating yourself to a nice stay, get there as early as you can checkin, which probably means skipping a lot of the stuff you have planned. This is NOT the time to arrive 5pm if checkin is at 3pm. Dinner is often scheduled in advance and early, like 6pm-8pm.\n\n9: That looks like it may take you 5 hours to get to Osaka, more or less. That's 3pm with a 10am checkout. Relax in the morning. You aren't going to be able to do all that, in particular the aquarium most likely. You'll just arrive too late.\n\n10: Probably way too much. The castle is ok. You'll get loads of shrines in Kyoto and/or Nara.\n\n11: Same advice as Disney sea, skip the morning shrine, get to Universal early early early, especially if you are going there for Mario. You are probably looking at hours long line if you aren't there when the gates open. Personally I find USJ more fun than Disney. You'll probably spend the whole day there. I wouldn't plan to do anything else. Dotonbori is probably way more fun on foot than a cruise.\n\n12: Don't even try to do both Nara and Kyoto in the same day. You aren't here long enough to see all the temples anyway, either spend the day in Nara or Kyoto. You'll end up seeing far more than you probably want anyway. I'd probably just skip Nara this trip, but everyone has their favorites.\n\n13,14: People are right about Obon, it's going to be crowded. Getting around in Kyoto is often hell with the buses and it might even be worse then. When I went with my parents we used taxis quite a bit which saved a lot of time and we got some air conditioning (if you have some luck). It's going to be very hot, humid in miserable in Kyoto at this time of year. Prioritize on what you want to see in particular. Be prepared to cut up to half.",

I'm learning that we won't make it into Shinjuku as early as I thought, so we will be spending more time around Shinjuku on one of the days we're not doing much.\n\n\n2. I'd say it's not enough sweets \ud83e\udd23 I think that one comes down to personal preferences haha. I planned that for however much our energy allows we'd spend 3-5 hours doing Meiji Shrine and Yoyogi. That would put us around noon. 3-5 hours sightseeing around Harajuku and Omotesando, and the Shibuya from about 5-6pm til nighttime. The in-between details can all be changed as nothing on this day is a must do except for Meiji Shrine and simply Sightseeing. I actually don't think we'll be doing much generic shopping. I'm bringing one large suitcase, one carry one, and one personal one strap backpack. We're shipping our luggage, so we will only have our personal packs on us for the vast majority of the trip so we're free from having to check in ASAP.\n\n\n3. For Ikebokuro, we actually were going to start at 9ish am. This is probably the one day where we would start later than, say, 7? We're primarily going for Animate, and I don't think we will spend much more time than a few hours in Sunshine City. Then it's about a 30 min train to Akihabara. I don't mind skipping some of the Cafes, but one of my friends and I are massive FFXIV fans, so I thought that one would be great to go to.\n\n\n4. From the research I've done, most agree that leaving the firework show before 9pm to catch the last shinkansen to Tokyo is the best course. There's also no way to purchases designated seating tickets to the festival as a foreigner as they are purchased through ticket Pia. The festival itself doesn't require any tickets, though, so were going for the food and experience, and the fireworks can been seen from many spots thankfully. I've also contacted the organizers of the festival in hopes that maybe there is a way a foreigner can get a ticket for a designated seating area.\n\n\n5. I might just go ahead and drop the Imperial Palace all together then. I can't say it was something that I felt we had to do, and I like that River bus recommendation! I would prefer spending more time in Odaiba.\n\n\n6. Might just skip the Starbucks Roastery and head straight for Disneysea in that case.\n\n\n7. I really REALLY want to see a Capybara. I hope to own two as pets someday. I'm completely fascinated by these beautiful rodents, and this Cafe is basically my opportunity to see one. Skytree isn't a must, and I kind of just tossed these all on the last day as I really have no concrete plans for this day. I did intend to do it with Asakusa, but wanted a nighttime view from the top, so I decided against it. If there's anywhere else I can go hangout with capybara, let me know! This really is just a filler day where we can do things we might not have had the chance to do, or just explore.\n\n\n8. Check-in is at 3pm, and we're heading for Arakura at 7:30am. I expect to arrive by 9:30. We should have a good 6 hours to do at least Arakura, make it the extra 20 min commute to Kawaguchiko, and get food. That will determine if we have any time for the railway, though I don't know how long it takes, so if you have insight into that, let me know! We can always do something else to burn the time until 3 as I do want to get to Ubuya right at 3.\n\n\n9. Thankfully, we are extending our trip, so the next morning can be spend leisurely with some morning baths and relaxation as it should. We got the VIP 501 suite, and it was a shame that we were leaving so early in the morning originally. Around 8am just to make it to Oaaka by around 1pm. Now we'll probably do half a day in the area and leave for Osaka around midday, and spend the evening in Osaka probably only doing the Umeda Sky Building and going straight to our airbnb in Dotonbori. The rest of the activities will be done now on the extra day we have in Osaka. 3 full days in Osaka now.\n\n\n10. Noted. Castle is good. Might just get a look at Shitennoji from the outside as I don't really feel the need to actually go into most Shrines, and it's pretty close to Shinsekai. Will cut out Sumiyoshi Taisha\n\n\n11. Will also skipping the Shrine. I had heard that it's basically a lot like the Universal here in California, so I figured we wouldn't spend the whole day as we've been. None of us have been to the Super Mario area though. If there's a lot of cool exclusives though, then we might do a park tour if possible. I did see some cool things like a collab with Jujutsu Kaisen on their site. We're also staying in Dotonbori, so we have access to it at anytime. We're literally a 5 min walk from the Glico man sign and less than a 10 min walk away from Shinsaibashi as well.\n\n\n12. Since we have few extra days, We're going to hit Nara for a half a day trip just to see the deer and the Shrines, and be in Kyoto by night. We won't do anything other than check in and grab food perhaps. We'll have a full 3 days to work with now in Kyoto.\n\n\n13-14. Will do. There's a lot of fluff I added in Kyoto, but the main 5 are Gion, Kiyomizu-Dera, Arashiyama, Fushi Imanari, and Kinkaku-Ji. If we have time for anything else, we'll give it a go. With 3 days, we should be able to at least get these 5 done. Our hotel is a few minutes walk from Pontocho and Kamu River. It's no more than 10 mins from Gion as well. \n\n\nThis leaves just 3 more days as our return Flight on the 18th is also at 6pm. So two more days, one of which will be us returning to Tokyo. Should we do only 3.5 days in Kyoto and spend our last 3 days in Tokyo, or spend 4.5 days in Kyoto and keep our last two days as they are?",

If you can do it, go for it.\n\nThat is the only Capybara cafe I know of in Tokyo and I couldn't find another after a quick search. If you want to go heading out the chuo line is pretty interesting. I do recommend you search Nakano Broadway though, it's off Nakano Station, same chuo line you'll use to get to Kichijoji. If you are into some anime, and gaming I find Nakano Broadway way more interesting than store like Animate. Just the entire building has so many interesting stores. Kichijoji can be a fun place to walk around and eat, the park on the southern side is nice to visit and not large. Koenji on your way back is also a great station to visit to get a better idea of typical Japan along with Nakano.\n\nSkytree - see how your trip goes, but rather than trying to force it on a day watch the weather. To be honest, I actually found it to be a little TOO high to get a nice view. You are looking down at most things. There is a public building in Iidabashi station that has a nice view over towards Shinjuku, although I can't remember the name right now.\n\nMakes sense on USJ. I haven't checked to see what's the same, but I imagine a number of the exhibits are. Last time I went there was a more temporary anime exhibit and that had a four hour line. I don't know what the Mario area will be like, but I can promise you it's probably going to be crowded.\n\nThe best castle hands down is Himeji and one of my favorite places in Japan. I was lucky to get to see it a few times during Hanami while corona was going on. I'm not sure how crowded it is, but if you get sick of temples and find yourself with a free day it's nice, and Engyoji if you want to make a day of it. I'm not sure how you might fit it in though.  The park area around Osaka castle is nice, and there is a building nearby you can get on the roof and have some food or drinks and offers a good view of the castle. I haven't actually visited the inside of it since 2001 and I really don't remember what it was like, but it's all been redone in concrete now.\n\nIf you enjoy craft beer, the beer scene in Japan is quite good now.\n\nKyoto vs Tokyo? It really depends on what you want to see and how it fits into your rail pass. There are many smaller interesting areas to explore in Kyoto, but with your love of anime and games and the cafes on your list there is a lot more you can explore in Tokyo. You are really hitting a lot of the kind of touristy sites. Going to check out stuff like Yanaka, Koenji, Shimokitazawa might be an interesting break from your normal schedule.\n\nIf you get sick of the normal temples, there is a zen temple complex (Myoshin-ji) that's a little different. rock gardens, moss, bamboo, the ones you visit change on a regular basis. The friends I've brought there have enjoyed the change of pace. It's not a must visit, but an alternative.\n\nThe Okochi Sanso Gardens, a short walk from the bamboo forest was really nice. IIRC, it was the former residence of an author or poet and has some nice views overlooking kyoto from the gardens.",

Ironically enough, my itinerary wasn't really giving us the freedom to truly enjoy our locations. If I'm so lucky enough as to return to Japan, my next trip will feature more side quests like Hakone, Kobe, Hiroshima, Koyasan, Kanazawa, Tagayama, etc. Hopefully by that time, I'll speak much better Japanese. I'm still a beginner at this point.\n\nDefinitely going to be knocking back some cold ones. Especially at the hanabi festival.\n\nYou're maybe the only one who's recommended I do more time in Tokyo, and I respect that you based it off of my preferences. As fascinating as Kyoto is, I personally also believe Tokyo is of more interest to us as a first trip. Again, if I get the pleasure of returning in the future, I'll probably fly in through Kansai and begin in Osaka instead of Tokyo.\n\nI'll be keeping an eye on this reddit, and particularly your posts as I rework our plans. Again, I appreciate you sharing your knowledge!",

I really recommend those.\n\nIf the weather is really clear, Skytree might be worth it. See the roads going out, but like I said, it's looking down more than out. Check out of photos if you want and don't feel it will spoil it.\n\nRegarding the other places you listed.\n\nHakone is nice, but be sure you are comfortable with onsens and getting naked. If you aren't going to those you are skipping half the trip. I know people go to the private ones, but it's not the same. Same with Beppu and Yufuin. Kobe kind of reminds me a bit of Yokohama in way, but it feels more separate. As a tourist I don't think there is a lot to attract someone to go there.\n\nAs great as Kyoto is, it can also get old. I think for those people that just like walking around, taking it in, stopping by cafes it's a nice place to spend more time in, and that doesn't really seem like your trip this time. It's also surrounded by mountains and doesn't get much breeze which is part of why it's so miserable in the summer and air quality can be kind of bad at times for the same reason.\n\nYou can visit some of the places you may miss in Tokyo, and there are a lot of other areas you can visit. Yokohama is great to get down to. There is Kamakura if you do decide you want more temples and they really are nice.  And it's summer, you can go Zaimokuza and spend some hours at the beach. (It's also walking distance from Kamakura, so combine it with temples)  Go up to Kawagoe for some more old-japan feel. (Little Edo)   Or head out to Takao-san and look around the mountain, light hiking or take the ropeway, get some beers and ramen up top and visit the temples. Explore korean town Shin-okubo. Visit Yanaka, or go through Ameyoko, the back streets of Koenji or Asagaya and find some of the small live houses or local senberos.\n\nGo to a baseball game in Jingu, that is quite an experience. The cheering is something you never see in US as well as the beer girls. All the beer is sold by young women walking around with mini-kegs on their backs.\n\nWeeknights until about 20:00, get their earlier, especially for food, visit Suzuden (it's a liquor store with a standing area) near Yotsuya station. Still my favorite place to have nihonshu. \n\nIf you are ok with it, the public bath houses are slowly disappearing. Finding some of the old ones can be quite an experience to visit while they still exist. Quite a few brew pups are open now, go on a craft beer crawl and explore the stuff you won't find the US. There is plenty to do in and around Tokyo.",

Why go unless you get to have a fulfilled experience, I always say. Same with my vacations. Budgeting is fine, by why deprive oneself of certain pleasures?\n\nI'm all for the authentic onsen experience! Though we have our own private onsen at Ubuya, and on our own deck of all things which is just amazing, I'm 100% going to the public bath at the ryokan still! It's a must! I didn't do all that research on proper ettiquite for nothing \ud83e\udd23 and also, only the public baths are actually spring water from Fuji, so in order to get the benefits of soaking, the public bath is the way to go. I'll definitely be taking a morning soak though. Hopefully the view is nice and clear so I can get that early morning Kawaguchi Lake and Fuji view.\n\nI forgot about Yokohama. I think that's where the giant Gundam Statue is. We might be able to make a day trip of that, honestly. Ooh, a beach trip to Zaimokuza sounds great. Ah man. I feel like I have so many more things I want to so now \ud83d\ude05. Honestly, it all sounds magical. Especially the exploring of the backstreets and beer crawls. I'm going to really have to reevaluate our goals with all this new inspiration.",

If you research the area you'll see there are some other things to do there. Also look up Enoshima which is accessible via an old street car line. Go over to Enoshima island. Has a nice temple to visit, grab some food and climb down the back and all over the rocks. That whole area is great to see the sunset from, especially on a clear day with an admittedly tiny Fuji-san in the background.",

It is kind of interesting as is Golden-gai, but it's popular and I find the latter a bit intimidating. A lot of tourists go there, but some places aren't friendly if you aren't a regular and prices can sometimes been unexpectedly high. \n\nNobeiyokocho near Shibuya station is much nicer place to go I think. A bar on the second floor near back (facing tracks), Tight is probably still a nice place to start. A few places may still turn you away, especially a group of three, but overall I love the feeling there much more. Ebisu Yokocho might be another interesting destination, more food oriented.",

You do get a lot of Japanese going there on their way home. In that sense it's more local I guess, although there are more places there targeting foreigners than in the past. Often though I feel like it's a lot of tourists standing around in the very narrow alleyway trying to get photos for their instagram. I imagine English is pretty common in the menus. Just order and try what they put in front of you. There are some bars if you just want drinks.\n\nGolden Gai can be pretty deep. Realize a lot of the places will have between 6-15 seats. Look for places that have no charge (basically a charge to sit down) and just try to read the atmosphere. A lot of places can have pretty steep charges of 500-2000 yen + what you order. I've been in the position more than a few times of having to explain to a larger or noisy or overly drunk group why they should look for another bar to visit as the customer that spoke English.\n\nAsk if they have a charge. \"cha-ji ga arimasu ka?\"  Be prepared to pay as much as 2000-3000+ yen for a single drink, and if you get caught like that, pay it and chalk it up to experience. Just try to use some common sense.\n\nFor nonbei - [http://www.nonbei.tokyo](http://www.nonbei.tokyo)Tight, Amulet, Toland are probably some places to start.\n\nEbisu Yokocho[https://japanjourneys.jp/tokyo/ebisu/dining/ebisu-yokocho/](https://japanjourneys.jp/tokyo/ebisu/dining/ebisu-yokocho/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo to whatever interests you most though.

            "comment": "Like many have said, this is way too much. You could have double the time and not squeeze all of this in.\n\nEveryone has different travelling styles from making it up as you go to intricately planned. But this is planned out too much. There is no breathing room here. These are full days with a lot of walking in what should be very hot, humid conditions. You are going to get tired and not want to press on at such an intensity. If you are going to try and accomplish this it will involve very early starts and very late finishes and it will burn you out and you won't be able to sustain it for the whole trip.\n\nThere are some days that need to be reconsidered, but the main one that jumps out to me is Day 1. How do you intend to do all of this on the day you arrive when you arrive so late? You are due to arrive at 4.40pm. This is already late in the day. Assuming your plane arrives on time, you will probably not disembark the plane until at least 5pm. Customs will take at least an hour, maybe 2. So let's just say you get lucky and you get through by 6pm. You still then want to explore the airport and collect your train tickets (this often takes a while as well) so you will be done by 7pm. Then it will be about an hour to Shinjuku, so 8pm. And you are only now going to get a snack. Assuming you get in without a wait you will probably be there until at least 9pm to allow to enjoy what you are eating. And you still have a long list of items plus dinner, and a number of these places will no longer be open. From other comments, it looks like you are flying from California. That is a long flight. You are going to be tired. Your body clock is going to be messed up. You are not going to want to do anything on the day you arrive.\n\n4.40pm arrival is actually perfect. It means you can arrive, clear customs and get into Tokyo at an appropriate time, to allow you to check in to the hotel, eat dinner and go to bed. Because that will be all you will want to do. And you will certainly feel better and more refreshed for the rest of the trip if you get proper rest on the day you arrive.\n\nAs to the rest of the itinerary, cut back. It's great to have options but you cannot cover all of this. You need to be open to some flexibility and make changes on the run. You need to enjoy what you are seeing and not worrying about needing to leave in 5 minutes to get to the next sight so that you don't fall behind. You need to consider the weather. Plans will change if you get a week of rain.\n\nI understand the excitement of wanting to see and do everything, and being tied to a limited timeframe to see it, but really look into travel times. Look into each place you have listed and what there is to see and do while you are there. Yes, sometimes there may be a shrine and all you need to do is take a quick photo and move on, but a lot of these places are more involved than that. They can be located in massive gardens that are worth taking the time to explore. Give yourself time to immerse yourself in what you are seeing and not just see it through a camera lens.\n\nLook at each destination and mark down what you are interested in seeing. Place them all on a map. Have at least two categories - must see and would like to see. See if you are able fit in all of the must see items within your itinerary. Add nearby sites from the would like to see list to make your path for the day flow. Work out how long you think it will take. And then double it. You will always take longer than you think.\n\nThe next biggest change I would make is food. Personally I would cut all of your food stops, but keep a couple that you really want to do. There are countless great food options in Japan. Food should be tied to where you happen to be come meal time. Maybe you took an extra hour at the temple than you thought you would. Then find a place near it for lunch. Maybe you are really hungry at 11.30 or 12.00. Have lunch then. Don't tie yourself down to your plan that involved eating at 2pm after seeing three more sites. Eat, recharge, and then see those three sites. Also by choosing specific places as you have, you are setting yourself up more more stress and pressure if there is a long wait at that place to then get everything else done. If you have an intricate plan for sightseeing, go with the flow for meals. Or if you have an intricate plan for meals, you need to really cut back the sightseeing. Your focus seems yo be on sightseeing, so focus on that and see what is near you when you feel like food.\n\nAll that aside, your plan is great and covers many wonderful places. Have a great time. I am sure you will have fun in Japan.",

We also added a few extra days, and I'm trimming a lot of the fluff like certain Cafes and restaurants that I really don't need to have scheduled.\n\nI also was not aware before that it takes so long just to escape from the airport, as I've taken other trips to places like Hawaii and was out of the airport in 30 mins. I'm surprised it takes so long even with their onboarding process though the Visit Japan website. They made it seem so expedited. Our first night now consists of only getting to Shinjuku, grabbing some food and maybe exploring some of Kabukicho before we check in to our hotel. It's a 10-min walk from our hotel to Kabikicho, so I think that's feasible while not exerting too much pressure.",

I have not travelled there since Covid, and I understand the process may still be a little slower than before the pandemic. However, international travel is always slow going through customs. Always. Domestic travel can feel like a fancy train station. You arrive, go straight through the bag check, on the plane, fly, land, pick up bags and leave. International travel is a whole different beast. Make sure you get to the airport plenty of time before the flight and expect a long customs queue in Tokyo. Personally, I've experienced 3+ hour waits for customs in many major international cities - Dubai, London, Los Angeles. Also be aware that most airports have half to two thirds of the customs counters dedicated only to its national citizens. Everyone else goes through the longer queue with fewer counters.\n\nYour current Day 1 schedule is perfect and very doable.\n\nYou have clearly done a lot of research into places to visit and all of the places you have listed are worth seeing, so I can certainly understand not wanting to cut anything. So as long as you go into it with some flexibility and some order of importance so you know what to skip over if your day is taking longer than expected, you should be fine.",

This is a trip I know myself and at least one of my friends who's going have dreamed about for over a decade. Now, we can finally make it happen.\n\nI was actually getting a bit of flack from everyone from starting the planning process so early, but as we can see, I had a lot of things set in stone even 4-5 months out, and here we are almost exactly 3 months out, and I'm making huge changes like how many days we're staying. I'm a major supporter of preparation. I'm extremely glad I shared this itinerary on this reddit as well. Everyone's feedback has been immensely helpful.\n\nRegarding customs, I had no idea it could get so bad. I've yet to take international flights. I've been to Mex quite a few times, but I live fairly close to the border and it never takes that long, though this is on a whole different level of travel. I'm hoping it doesn't take over 3 hours.",

It took longer than expected to get to places, we\u2019d be slowing down because our feet hurt and some places were so crowded it was difficult to walk fast. We did take the JR line as much as possible (I got vertigo twice from the trains and have never had that or motion sickness). There was a lot we didn\u2019t get to do. We really enjoyed the last two days where we just wandered around slowly finding things as we came across them. I took about 400 pics per day and knew I was looking at my phone too much but also wish I had more pics and videos. Do your best but focus on your time there and enjoy!",

And like other said, don\u2019t make a big deal about must eat restaurants- they can have very long lines and some just say they are full and won\u2019t accept anyone in.

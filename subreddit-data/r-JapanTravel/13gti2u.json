    "postText": "Hi all! My partner and I will be visiting Japan in Nov 2023 and would like to get any opinions on this itinerary. Planning for a mix of driving / public transport, have not looked into regional JR passes in detail yet but keeping that as an option.\n\nWould really appreciate any feedback, not our first trip to Japan but this is our first time in Chubu! Really excited but also a little worried if we are stretching ourselves too thin. We will be flying in to Nagoya and departing from Tokyo. \n\nDays 1-3: Nagoya + Korankei - \nThese 3 days are pretty straightforward, will be visiting the mainstream spots in Nagoya and also doing a day trip to Korankei for the autumn foliage. \n\nDay 4: Fukui - \nWill be travelling here by train from Nagoya, and planning to rent a car for the day to visit the dinosaur museum and Eiheiji. \n\nDays 5-6: Kanazawa - \nKenrokuen, Higashi Chaya, Nagamachi, Nishi Chaya and Ninjadera. There seems to be a loop bus in the city which we are planning to make use of. \n\nDay 7: Shirakawago - \nPlanning on renting a car in the morning from Kanazawa, and driving to Shirakawago. Will be staying 1 night here as well. If anyone has any recommendations for ryokans/accommodation here and when/how to book, please let us know!\n\nDay 8: Kurobe Gorge Railway - \nDrive to Unazuki station in the morning, and spend the day on the Railway admiring the view. Head back to Toyama station to return the car, and wind down in the area. \n\nDay 9: Alpine Route from Toyama to Nagano - \nThe snow corridor may not be accessible in Nov, but I think the other attractions along the way and the different transport modes are exciting on its own! This route is also on my bucket list. I\u2019ve checked and made sure the route is still open (we\u2019ll be there mid Nov), and we will be starting the day early at 7am to make sure we get to Nagano before the bus service ends. \n\nDay 10: Nagano - \nVisit the Jigokudani Monkey Park, also another spot on my to go list. At the moment doesn\u2019t seem like we need a rental car? \n\nDays 11-12: Karuizawa - \nWe\u2019ll probably be spending these 2 days visiting the usual spots - shopping, sightseeing etc. \n\nDay 13: Enoshima - \nMay seem like a totally random place considering the itinerary route but I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Enoshima, so here it is \ud83d\ude02. Will visit the aquarium and some other tourist spots but also here mainly for the view! \n\nDays 14-16: Tokyo - \nHave been here a number of times already so will be doing stuff catered to our own interests before ending our holiday :\u2019) \n\nThank you in advance!! Really, any form of feedback or advice is much appreciated!",

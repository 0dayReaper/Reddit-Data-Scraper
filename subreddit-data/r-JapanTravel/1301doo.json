It's a lovely time of year though and the gardens all look amazing. \n\nAfter Ueno you could also visit Akihabara which is one stop south of Ueno. It's like the center of gaming/anime in Tokyo.\n\nCould also do an onsen while in Hakone.",

Many foreigners are targeted at these events, and if anything happens in your vacinity you may end up in jail. \n\nAlso Odaiba is not the place you want to head with a bunch of luggage.

I\u2019ve heard that the bars are small and people generally chat to strangers.",

There's a really cool place called Tobu World Square and they've got miniatures of famous monuments from around the world.\n\nAs far as the bar stuff goes I'm also not a drinker so I'm not a good person to ask, but I feel obligated to warn everyone regardless. If I were to purely pick somewhere where I'd feel safer, I'd go to Minato. That's where the diplomats and rich people are and so I'd feel more likely to be seen as someone who lives there, rather than someone who is a tourist. I find in touristy areas like Shibuya, Akiba, and Shinjuku, I am more likely a target for tourist scams, which especially include maid/\"companion\" cafes. They charge by seat location and encourage over drinking so that they can charge excessive amounts. \n\nI will say, if you are ever refused entry from a bar/restaurant, don't fight it. Just leave. There are a million places to go and you are most likely being denied entry for your own safety.",

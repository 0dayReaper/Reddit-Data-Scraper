    "postText": "The only trip I've ever done to another city, alone, was from America to Japan for one of the most amazing weeks of my life. I really wish I could travel more. I have the money, but I virtually only get 5 days of PTO a year.\n\nRandomly, if I see a picture of Kyoto or the neon lights of Tokyo, I'll remember myself awkwardly getting lost on the subway, finding a really good Ramen place, or talking to Japanese locals in Osaka. It's very bittersweet because the memories were so amazing, but also since it's not a trip I can do very easily with my job. More so, I have a very wonderful girlfriend now, so if I were to do another trip, it would be with her. It's amazing to have company, but again, there was a certain magic to being lost in a foreign country.\n\nDoes anyone else have these emotions when thinking back to Japan?",

I tend to wing things when I travel and I decided to go last minute to Japan from Korea since I saw a cheap flight but it meant missing out on a lot of cool stuff that was sold out. In addition, I have family and friends in Korea which meant my time was super social and suddenly went to Japan which seemed much more rigid, quiet, and sort of isolating...plus, most of my hostels mainly had only Japanese guests and it was hard connecting with them due to language barrier, meant I spent a lot of time alone. I usually like spending time alone but it was a little too much alone. I think I would have enjoyed it more with friends or family...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, the public transportation gave me a huge headache. What ticket to buy? What covers what? What is the best deal? Having to enter the bus in the middle in Kyoto and it almost being impossible to pay and hop off due to how crowded it was and getting stuck in traffic for an hour even though it should be 15 minutes...not properly researching my route and backtracking. Basically, one shouldn't wing Japan. Know your shit before going and it'll be much more pleasant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also had to carry a banana in my hand for two hours my first day because I didn't realize there were no trash cans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus, as good as the food as, it didn't sit well with me. Admittedly, I am used to spicy food, and I basically had to order a side of kimchi to cut the sort of unctuous, bland taste that is Japanese food. People who love simple, basic cooking, with a few ingredients will love it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never romanticized Japan...I mean, I've always wanted to go but I didn't have any grand expectations and it just was a sort of blah experience for me. It's gorgeous but I didn't connect with the overall vibes. Now India...I miss that place a ton. There's something about Japan that feels a bit too orderly and sterile for me...Plus, after speedy Korea, Japanese service is so slow! The amount of times I missed a train because the service staff kept on explaining every little detail to a T...in addition, the amount of times I went in the wrong way because someone gave me the wrong directions...etc. etc. etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't find Japanese people to be that friendly. Sure, if they are selling you something they are nice, but there were times I overheard some racist shit (they don't particularly like Koreans or Chinese people) when they assumed I didn't understand. To be fair, Koreans and Chinese people can also be pretty racist, so whatevs, I guess. It was just kind of odd to experience as a Korean-American. There were definitely times when I saw how differently they treat \"white Westerners\" as opposed to \"Asian-Australians/Americans/etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's my little vent.",

It was okay, I just didn't fall in love. Part of traveling is also about who you make connections with and Japan was very lacking in the regard.

Westerners will also avoid talking to you unless you aggressively make the first move. \n",

While for me there was nothing wrong with South Korea there was nothing great either that would ever bring me back like Japan would. Spent a month there for Olympics and two weeks in 2017 going to some other places. \n\nI thought Seoul was a not as interesting a version of Tokyo. Food while perhaps tainted by limitations in Pyeongchang was very samey. Put it this way, haven't been to a Korean bbq back in Australia in the nine months since. Japanese at least every other week. Culturally I found Japan fascinating. DMZ was a profound experience but other than that not much grabbed me. And the skiing is rubbish - snow quantity/quality, terrain etc - not a patch on Japan. \n\nPeople were nice but wouldn't go to South Korea on a holiday or recommend it. \n\n\n",

Culturally Japan has so much to see, the old and the tradition contrasting the modern and the high tech. Whereas South Korea feels like a normal modern place without much to see, especially if you\u2019ve seen similar ancient buildings where emperor lived but much bigger and more impressive in China which had a huge impact on Korean in ancient times. But Korean food is another level. Kimchi is really my type. ",

You can definitely see that Korea developed very quickly out of necessity, following the war, if you see all those blocky, ugly, line of buildings  that look the same.  The two countries are totally different  in terms of history so I think it's kind of ridiculous  to compare what has more sites because the answer is obvious,  given the history. \n\nMy mother and I kept commenting during our travels in Korea how sad it is that so much of our past history has been completely wiped away.

Man, I agree sooo much on the trash can part lol In fact, once I realized that, I stopped buying street foods to eat cause I knew I would be holding onto this Takoyaki stick forever. This was my second trip to Japan, but I was excited to go because I wanted to be alone and interestingly enough, Japan really makes you feel that way in some ways.\n\nAnyhow, yes, no place is perfect and the transportation is definitely quite intricate in Japan. I got super annoyed one time when I was trying to buy the one day Kyoto bus pass and the driver literally shoved me aside to let passengers get off, which was what I was trying to do anyways, but I understand.\n\nBut yea I feel you on certain things and if you do happen to go again, I hope that you get a better experience!",

I know most foodies say that Japan is a foodie haven, but give me spicy, bubbling sloppy kimchi jiggae anytime over delicately flavored, immaculately arranged kaiseki meals! I remember feeling ridiculously happy when the hostel I was staying at actually had Shin Ramyeon packets after having delicate Japanese food for almost 2 weeks.\n\nThat said, I've yet to visit Korea despite my love of Korean food. Somehow the places I've seen don't seem very enticing, hiking-wise. \n\nI do hope you'll give Japan another go though, perhaps armed with a few packets of ramyeon :P (I've learnt my lesson). Locals also stay at hostels - so try to pick one with more social vibes. But frankly, I find that people (locals &amp; foreigners) tend to keep to themselves more in places like Tokyo, Kyoto, and usually are more open in smaller places like Takayama, Daisen, Sendai.\n",

The food, the company, the sights, sounds, smells, and people are things I think about almost daily! Japan was the place at the top of my list for international travel, and I am so glad it was my first. I am huge into anime/manga, and the streets of Akihabara just felt like home! I brought back and entire suit case filled to max capacity with every flavor of kit-kat, and collectibles from all my favorite anime/manga series. I was even able to pick up exclusive merchandise from Hiro Mashima\u2019s 2017 Fairy Tail/Rave Master art expo!!! I\u2019m planning on back around the same time ant the beginning of spring in early 2019, because when I went in 2017 I had just missed the Sakura blossoms blooming, and that is some thing I really want to see.

It was definitely one of the more memorable trips we've ever done and I feel happy remembering our time there.\n\nAlso, I think it's very normal to experience nostalgia for a first trip abroad. You said that this was your first solo trip out of the country and I think that's going to be a very special and memorable experience, no matter where you go. I still remember my first trip abroad (to France) when I was in college and even though it wasn't THAT great of a trip, I still think about that experience as one of the best times in my life and feel an immense amount of nostalgia when I remember it. :) ",

I had almost zero expectations going in. And indeed there were a lot of difficult moments with communication and unspoken cultural rules. (Plus someone told me foreigners were unwelcome and I should go drown myself in the ocean...) \n\nBut overall people were friendly. It took awhile to make friends and for people in the neighbourhood to stop being uncomfortable of me. A few years made a big difference though. Neighbours would chat on the street. One old man figured out something was wrong because I left work hours earlier than normal and went out of his way to make sure I was ok. It was easier to cycle and walk everywhere. Rent was really cheap outside of major cities. The gap between rich and poor isn't as pronounced. I really miss the lifestyle there. ",

I was missing it like fire by the time I touched down, but about a week later while I was at work, out of the blue I remembered chilling at the cafe in the Umeda Sky Building drinking a float. It about floored me with how much I missed being out there, and the serenity of watching the planes fly in on approach to itami international from the upper deck of the building. Honestly coming back a second time was way harder than the first. I had a better idea of what I was doing, planned the trip better, and overall had even more fun than my first trip. Hell, even catching the flu on my second day in osaka ended up being fun since I had to explore the area my hotel was in to find a pharmacy (the flu meds are great, was back to 100% inside of 24 hours).\n\nI ended the trip on an incredibly high note though, at a festival north of tokyo. It was something you'd never in a million years see or experience here in america, so incredibly fun that I knew even before the festival ended that day that I'd be coming back for it again in 2019. I dont care if the trip is one week or more, I absolutely will go to that festival again (and osaka. I cant bring myself to visit japan and not spend at least a night in osaka. I enjoyed tokyo, but Osaka was just on another level both times). ",

First, whenever the song \"Accidentally in love\" from shrek comes up on my spotify, I feel very nostalgic because we went to USJ and lined up for the shrek-themed ride, the line is so long and they keep playing this song. I can totally feel the coldness and my legs getting stiff while we wait for our turn.  \n  \nSecond, I was only listening to one playlist while we were in japan until our departure so whenever I play that playlist, it feels like I'm in japan all over again.  \n  \nLastly, you know how some of the public restrooms (in a park, for example) have this distinct stinky smell? Yeah I feel nostalgic every time I smell that in my country.",

And re-reading the novels enhances my experience of the stories visually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've also started learning conversational Japanese and am looking for a way of gaining employment in Japan for at least a year to truely judge whether or not I really like the country or am I just romanticizing the country.",

It was nasty cold in the winter but it was so clean and beautiful.  The whole country looked manicured. There are no nicer people in the world than the Japanese. I know this because I have lived in Thailand, Turkey, Italy, England, South Korea, China and of course Japan. We miss everything about it but one thing that stands out to us is the food. Just delish. And the hot thermal baths are amazing.",

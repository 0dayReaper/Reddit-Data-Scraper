I can understand that you want to see as much as possible but you\u2019re not really giving yourself any breathing room or time to absorb what you\u2019re seeing. Like on May 20th you\u2019re jumping from Asakusa to Shimokitazawa, that\u2019s a hell of a detour. \n\n\nFor example, your Ikebukuro evening is way, way too packed. You estimate you\u2019ll get to Ikebukuro by ~19:46? And you want to see a mall that closes at 8? And see anime cafes and go to an arcade all within the space of around 2 hours?\n\n\nLook, I get it. You don\u2019t want to miss anything but you\u2019ll only get stressed out trying to pack all of this in. You\u2019ll be stressing about leaving the place you\u2019re at to go see another place which you\u2019ll only get to see briefly. \n\n\nI\u2019d say trim it down and cut some things out. Spend quality time at places instead of trying to see it all",

    "postText": "Hi all - I am going to Tokyo for 2 weeks in May. I will be travelling to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka (4 nights each). I have my itinerary for the 2 weeks finalized, except I am having a hard time figuring out how to do the day trip to Hakone from Tokyo. I've done my research and still unsure where to start. Hoping I can get some assistance. Here is what I have so far and my questions:\n\nI will be staying by Tokyo Station. To get from Tokyo Station to Hakone, I plan on: \n\n1) Taking a train from Tokyo Station to Odawara Station and starting my journey from Odawara. From Odawara Station, I would Hakone Tozan to Gora and then continue with the loop. Is this correct or should I be going to Hakone-Yumoto Station from Odawara Station and starting the loop from there? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe loop would consist of \n\nGora &gt; Hakone Tozan Cable Car &gt; Sounzan\n\nSounzan &gt; take ropeway &gt; Owakudani (black eggs)\n\nOwakudani &gt; take ropeway &gt; Togendai\n\nTogendai &gt; pirate ship cruise on Lake Ashi\n\nPirate Ship &gt; get off at Hakone-Machi or Moto-Hakone\n\nGetting off Hakone-Machi: Visit Hakone Checkpoint &amp; Onchi Hakone Koen Park and then walk along Lakeshore to Hakone Shrine (20 mins) - do this for nice views and if time to walk and see Hakone Checkpoint\n\nGetting off Moto-Hakone: 5 minute walk to shrine (do this if not enough time, don't want to walk, or don't want to see Hakone checkpoint)\n\nTake Hakone Tazon Bus to get back to Odawara\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, just wondering if I am doing this correctly by going from Tokyo Station to Odawara Station and starting there or if I should go to Hakione-Yumoto Station and start from there? Many people say to take the RomanceCar from Shinjuki Station but I am not staying in that area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

If you are taking the Tozan line from Odawara to Gora, you have to transfer at Hakone Yumoto anyways, so basically either way you will end up in Hakone Yumoto.\n\n\nAlso, just FYI, there is a Romancecar that goes directly from Otemachi station(metro station that is right beside Tokyo station) to Hakone Yumoto. Only a couple trains in the morning, but if timing is OK then it\u2019s the best way to travel to Hakone.\nYou could also take the Kodama or Hikari Shinkansen from Tokyo to Odawara for quicker travel, but it\u2019s more expensive compared to the Romance Car.\n\n\nAnyways, have fun in Hakone.",

Hence, the Otemachi to Hakone Yumoto Romancecar is the only way for you to travel with no transfers. (You can check the timetable [here](https://www.odakyu.jp/english/romancecar/timetable/))\n\n\nAfter getting off at Hakone Yumoto, the Gora train will be just across the platform, so very quick transfer.",

Thanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I found the timing. I don't think it will make sense to go from Otemachi because the earlier time gets me to Hakone closer to noon which is pretty late. I think I will go to Shinjuku and get the Day Pass from there and then use the RomanceCar",

We did that and it was pretty hassle free.\n\nBut you could ofc also get the 1-day-pass including the romance car and have everything covered - but if you stay near Tokyo station you'd have to change trains in Tokyo once as well, so no difference.\n\nAlso: keep in mind that they can suspend the cable car and ship on rather short notice if the weather is kinda bad, which can seriously influence your plans. I would recommend to check the status online on the day of your trip and plan accordingly (you can reach everything by bus too).",

You may have to search from Ueno to get it to come up in Google Maps, the train is very frequent and no transfers are required.\n\nTokyo Station and Shinjuku are on opposite ends of the Yamanote Line and Shinjuku in particular can be confusing when changing train operators.\n\nOnce at Odawara pick up either the Hakone Free Pass (the \"from Odawara\" version) or the [Hakone Tabisuke](http://www.izuhakone.co.jp/bus/coupon/index.html/). \nFundamentally both will let you do the 'loop', the difference is which sections are in which modes of transport. \n\nI prefer the Tabisuke as the Komagatake Ropeway (which is only included in the latter) is more interesting and I don't care for Owakudani, also it is a little cheaper.",

Generally speaking, for local passes in Japan you come out a little bit ahead if you are doing all the 'things' included within the pass in a time that is within or shorter than the recommended time frame.",

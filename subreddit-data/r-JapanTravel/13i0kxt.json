So many people and I think it's really not that beautiful. The monkey park is okayish but still.. not that amazing in my oppinion.\n\nLet me give you an alternative. Check out this trail, it's in the north of Kyoto: [https://en.japantravel.com/kyoto/the-kurama-kibune-trail/27189](https://en.japantravel.com/kyoto/the-kurama-kibune-trail/27189)It's a very nice Kurama to Kibune hike. Very calming and there aren't many people. It will take you half a day but it's totally worth it.\n\nIf you want to see a bamboo forest though, I'd recommend you check the Kodai-ji Temple in Kyoto. If you can, visit it during the illumination \"program\": [https://en.japantravel.com/kyoto/kodai-ji-autumn-illumination/16526](https://en.japantravel.com/kyoto/kodai-ji-autumn-illumination/16526)\n\nThis was our highlight during our stay in Kyoto. There is a small bamboo forest which is very niceley lit and we were almost alone. Way better and more beautiful than tho OG one in Kyoto.\n\nEdit: I was there just 2 Weeks ago, so it's still viable i think :)",

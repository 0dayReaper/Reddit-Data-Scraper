    "postText": "I'm going to be in Japan in August.  I've been to Japan a few times but I have never been to Hokkaido, so I thought to use this trip to also do that.  I was hoping for an itinerary check to see if I'm in over my head, and suggestions to what places to go visit or if I should be spending more/less time at each city.\n\nThe portion in question starts from the 20th - everything else before is pretty much set since I'm also doing a side trip to Taiwan with a couple of friends (and don't worry, I also have days in Tokyo at a much more relaxed rate).  I get back to Japan on the 19th, then will be going to an overnight onsen in Chiba with a few more friends. I also have to get back on Friday, 25th, as I already got tickets to Animelo with friends.  So ultimately I'm looking to do something for the 5 days in between.   \n\n\nI'll be on this leg of the trip on my own and will be traveling lightly.  I am a big foodie so I'm hoping to try out the different local delicacies, and I also like to visit historical/nature type of places.  \n\n\n* Aug 20: \n   * Onsen checkout in the morning.\n   * Travel to Sendai\n   * Sightseeing in the afternoon\n   * Concert at night, havn't won tickets for yet but not a big deal if I don't\n   * Stay overnight\n* Aug 21\n   * Checkout early in the morning, take Shinkansen to Hakodate\n   * Sightseeing in the afternoon\n      * Mt. Hakodate for the night view\n   * Stay overnight\n* Aug 22\n   * More sightseeing (morning market?) in Hakodate \n   * Leave to go to Sapporo after lunch\n   * Not sure if I can fit in any sightseeing\n      * Clock tower\n      * Odoru Park\n      * Nijo Market dinner?\n   * Overnight stay in Sapporo\n* Aug 23\n   * Sightseeing in Sapporo\n      * Historical Village\n      * Sapporo Beer museum on the way back?\n   * Stay another night in Sapporo\n* Aug 24\n   * Go to Tomakomai in the morning, at least the train ride is finally shorter\n   * Sightseeing\n   * Board overnight sferry at 7pm\n* Aug 25\n   * Arrive at Sendai in the morning, 10am\n   * Take Shinkansen to Saitama for concert (I have 6 hours before the concert starts so there should be plenty of time)\n      * Quick stop on the way in Utsnomiya for gyoza?\n   * Travel back to Tokyo with friends after\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess the thing is, there's mainly 3 cities (Sendai/Hakodate/Sapporo) for 4 days, so I'm not sure which one to spend a bit more time at.  I know the train ride between those 3 cities are pretty long so I'm taking the overnight ferry back instead of taking the train back all the way, even if JR pass covers all the train fees.  It is also possible to flip the plan around by taking the Sendai ferry to Tomakomai but the ferry is half price if pre-booked ahead, for sailings after the 22nd, so it's more tempting to take the route listed above (but it's not a deal breaker).    \n\n\nThanks for reading up to here, and I appreciate any advice/suggestions.",

I'm not against taking overnight bus either, as long as it doesn't cut too much into daytime.",

                            "comment": "I know less about overnight buses because I'm old and I know I would get very little sleep. \n\nI guess the question is really do you want to do anything in Tohoku or is the goal just to go to Hokkaido?  If your goal is just to go to Hokkaido, you could fly from Tokyo to Hakodate, then pay the 9000 yen for Hakodate to Sapporo, then sightsee around Sapporo and then pay \\~3400 yen to go to Tomakomai and then get to the airport.  For Saitama and Utsunomiya you could just use regular trains from Tokyo.\n\nI flew from Nagoya to Hakodate in '09 and it was great.  It was a super scenic flight.  I think there are more flights to Sapporo, but there should be flight to Hakodate as well.  you can look for discounted flights.\n\nSince you're going at the end of August you would need to start looking at discounted fares asap, but it would definitely save you a lot of time.  \n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2364.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2364.html)\n\nIt just seems like something to consider, though I've watched a few videos that make the ferries look like they could be a lot of fun too so...  I just also know I would not be able to sleep in that shared cabin which is the cheapest fare.  \n\nGood luck!",

I don't need to go to Utsunomiya, just a thing I could do on the way back if I'm on the shinkansen already.  My main go to is Hakodate and Tomakomai, Sapporo is just \"on the way\" since it's an hour from Tomakomai.\n\nOvernight bus were okay when I took them like 10 years ago, but I'm older now too so maybe not as easy unless I fork over for the more comfy ones (I know there are ones like seperate cabins where you can lie down.  As for the ferry, I used to take ferry rides often so I can easily sleep on one.  The 50% off makes it so cheap that I could actually go for a 1st class cabin for about 10k yen, or just cheap out at the shared at 5k, which I thought would be pretty decent since I don't have to think about hotel for that night.",

It's a short taxi ride from the Aomori station, and you can leave any luggage in a locker at the station. The site has a cafe (with soft serve, yum) and a souvenir shop as well. I spent several hours there and made it to Hakodate by mid-afternoon.\n\nThe morning market in Hakodate is fun and I had the most amazing seafood bowl at a random shop.\n\nI really enjoyed the Historical Village of Hokkaido and also the nearby Hokkaido Museum, which has a big section devoted to the Ainu.",

I think that arranging itinerary for 50% of your available time and leaving 50% empty for whatever might come up, be suggested, or simply stumble upon, would be the way to go. We went to Nikka distillery, Yamadera, Matsushima, and then Sendai city's sights, plus time for shopping and Clis Road. I'd say your 5 days covering Sendai, Hakodate and Sapporo would mean you don't really see much.",

I'm a nature scenery person, and my most enjoyable place was Kakunodate in Akita prefecture (accessible via Shinkansen). Rent a car from Kakunodate (about 50 dollars) and drive to Dakigaeri gorge and Lake Tazawa. If you still have time, visit the samurai street in Kakunodate itself.\n\nSecond, go to Fukushima city and rent a car, and drive the Urabandai-Azuma skyline, where you get to walk round the caldera of Mt Azuma-kofuji. The drive there is absolutely splendid with beautiful scenery. From there drive on to Goshikinuma (the 5 colours ponds). I recommend parking at the Bishamon pond and walking the 3.5km hike to see the other ponds. The beauty and serenity is unforgettable.\n\nThird (or just one more option) is to go to the Nikka distillery in Sendai for their guided tour and whiskey tasting (free). Then spend the rest of the day in Sendai shopping.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't recommend Matsushima. I was disappointed by the view and how touristy everything there is.",

Mostly because I did not want to drive on the left side of the road in a completely new country. I'd hate to be the clueless foreigner behind the wheel.\n\nI will see if I can make it to some of the places you mentioned by public transport though. Thanks again!",

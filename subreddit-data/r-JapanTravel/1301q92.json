    "postText": "Hello! My boyfriend (31M) and I (32F) will be traveling to Japan for the first time, and we are incredibly excited! We love food and history and are also looking forward to being immersed in Japanese culture. Any feedback and tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!

We plan on visiting lots of temples and shrines and would love to learn more about each place we visit. Any guide books/audio guides you'd recommend?\n2. How does luggage transfer between hotels work? Does every hotel offer this service, or should I be looking into third party services? Are they generally reliable? Any horror stories? If I bring any electronics, should I be keeping them in my daybags?  \n\n\n**Tue. 7/4: Arrive in Tokyo**\n\n* Arrive @ Narita (\\~8PM)\n* Hotel in Shinjuku\n* Perhaps grab a late night meal (Ichiran Shinjuku?)\n\n**Wed. 7/5: Shinjuku &amp; Shibuya**\n\n* Lunch @ Udon Shin \n* Meiji Jingu (buy goshuincho)\n* Harujuku (crepe/other dessert for snack--open to specific recs!)\n* Shibuya Crossing &amp; Shibuya Sky\n* Dinner @ Butagumi \n\n**Thu. 7/6: Ghibli &amp; Akihabara**\n\n* Ghibli Museum\n* Lunch @ Fuunji\n* Akihabara (going here early on trip because I think bf will really like Akihabara, so want to give opportunity to go twice)\n* Dinner @ Himawari Sushi (would like to try conveyor belt sushi--this place seemed well rated and conveniently located but up for other options!)\n\n**Fri. 7/7: Transit to Kyoto**\n\n* Shinkansen to Kyoto\n* Hotel near Nishiki\n* Lunch @ Honke Oriwaya\n* Walking tour\n* Dinner in/near Nishiki (would vendors in Nishiki Market be open for dinner? if not--open to recs!)\n\n**Sat. 7/8: East Kyoto**\n\n* Fushimi Inari Taisha (bright &amp; early!)\n* Kiyomizu Dera\n* Lunch in/near Gion (thinking Oshokuji Dokoro Asuka--but open to recs!)\n* Kodai-ji\n* Yasaka Shrine\n* Ginkaku-ji\n* Dinner @ Monk\n\n**Sun. 7/9: Nara &amp; Ginkaku-ji**\n\n* Ginkaku-ji @ open\n* Bento lunch on train?

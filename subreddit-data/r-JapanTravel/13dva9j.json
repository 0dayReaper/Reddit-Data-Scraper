Like I\u2019m looking forward to having Sendai style gyutan in Tokyo without having to commit to going up to Sendai. A lot of places make Hiroshima style okonomiyaki without being in Hiroshima. I\u2019m just saying to be flexible and enjoy yourself. Like some of the beef you mentioned just seems to be wagyu/beef from those regions, but are still the same breed of cow. Like Kobe beef is black cattle from Kobe, Matsuzaka beef is black cattle from Matsuzaka, and so on. Some connoisseurs will say otherwise, but life\u2019s short. And I\u2019ve only had horse sashimi a couple of times, but tbh, it\u2019s just ok? A \u201cnice to know\u201d experience, but I didn\u2019t think it was amazing.",

Please be patient in that regard.  \n\n[PS]\nThe Seto Inland Sea is known for delicious seafood not only limited to sea eels and oysters.

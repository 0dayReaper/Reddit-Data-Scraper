    "postText": "This might be a bit late, but I wanted to share anyways.  This is an update to my top 10 post I made last year during my January trip.  You can find the first post here: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/7x1if7/my_top_10_favorite_meals_album_of_everything_else/).  During the first trip I spent 2 weeks, traveling to Osaka and Tokyo.  However, this time I only spent one week and the entire duration in Tokyo during Golden Week, as I spent my first week in Hong Kong.  A lot of time was used experimenting during my first trip, so the second time around was conducted with much more intent and direction.  Planning began about 3 months prior to the trip as many of these locations required a reservation.  I\u2019ll try to include as many tips as possible in this write up, feel free to leave any question you may have in the comments. I will answer every single one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDuring this trip, I exclusively used Tabelog to select my restaurants.  I\u2019m a strong believer in following the \u201cWhen in Rome\u201d principle.  Given that Tabelog reviewers are all from locals, I wanted to eat wherever they were eating.  Yelp and Tripadvisor are great for finding information about a restaurant since all the reviews on Tabelog are in Japanese.  But other than that, reviews on those sites were all from foreigners who are not acclimated with Japanese cuisine.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Honorable Mention : Sisiliya** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/gallery/sVt07SI)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSisiliya was one of the restaurants I was looking forward to the most, given it\u2019s high Tabelog rating at the time(3.97, since been downgraded to 3.83).  I made a reservation to Sisiliya about 2 months in advance on the restaurant website, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to make one that far ahead.  Located in Yokohama, I made the trip from Tokyo just to try a slice of the second highest rated pizza in all of Japan on Tabelog.  However, this was the only time I felt let down by the Tabelog rating.  While the ingredients were great, the pizzas felt undercooked and a bit soggy.  I ordered two different pies: one buffalo cheese Margherita and one sausage.  If you take a look at the picture of the Margherita, the crust on one half does not possess the same amount of char as the other side.  The bottom of the crust was also a bit soggy.  The buffalo cheese was very delicious as was the sauce, but having a soggy pizza is almost a deal breaker for me.  I guess it's a matter of preference.  Still good pizza overall and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Yokohama.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**10. Motenashi Kuroki** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/s1o8QIr)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThough not the tastiest bowl I\u2019ve had, Motenashi Kuroki had one of the most unique ramen I\u2019ve tried.  Most well known for their Shio(salt) and miso based ramen, this restaurant has some of the most unconventional toppings when it comes to ramen( Chicken stuffed with olive, leeks, dumplings, etc.).  They also have specialties depending on the day.  Because it was a holiday(Golden Week), they decided to serve a shoyu based duck ramen.  Unfortunately,  this also caused the wait to be unbelievably long.  I waited about two hours before I got to eat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe noodles were about medium in terms of chewiness, typically I prefer a bit of bounce.  The wonton skins were extremely soft, seemed almost overcooked but still tasty.  I believe there were also a couple pieces of rare duck inside which were very tasty.  I was excited to try the duck based broth as my all time favorite meal in all of Japan (Moeyo Mensuke read my previous post) was a duck based broth.  While tasty,  the broth here just lacked the pizzaz that Moeyo Mensuke possessed.  The only thing I did not like about the bowl was the amount of leeks, with each bite containing at least one leek.  The leeks were interwoven in between the noodles and were impossible to avoid.  While I do like leeks, it was just too much for me.  Overall a great bowl of ramen, and I\u2019d love to come back and try their usual shio or miso based broth.  The olive stuffed chicken looked really unique and I was bit disappointed that I did not get to try it.  However, I do not think this bowl was worth the two hour wait at all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**9. Tsujihan** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/FVH4ODW)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDelicious sashimi bowl at an amazing price.  For only around 1100 yen, you can score a sashimi don containing salmon roe, tuna, fatty tuna, squid, clam and shrimp.  Out of all the restaurants on the list, I felt Tsujihan was the best value.  You can also choose to add uni or crab at an additional cost, but I chose to stick with the base meats.  All of the fish is mixed together and placed on top of the rice in a glorious ball.  At the end, you are given a couple slices of sashimi which is then mixed with soup and rice.  Not sure what the soup consisted of, but it was also very delicious.  While the sashimi was not top tier, it\u2019s the absolute best you can get for that price.  The restaurant\u2019s atmosphere was a bit tense, as no one was talking at all during the preparation, but this may be due to the crowd at the time.  I got to the restaurant maybe a 20 minutes before opening and was seated as soon as the operation started.  There was a line as I was leaving so I\u2019d suggest you try to arrive prior to opening\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**8. Yakitori Uno** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/2l7M6u5)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOne of my favorite Japanese cuisines to indulge in here in Los Angeles is yakitori.  But surprisingly, I did not try any yakitori spots during my prior trip.  I made it a mission to try at least one spot during this trip.  I went down the list of the top rated yakitori restaurants in Tokyo and had my credit card concierge call each one until I could find a reservation.  The reservation was made about two weeks in advance to my visit.  The restaurant does not have an english menu, so make sure you do your research beforehand.  Also, the staff does not speak much english so be prepared for that.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPart of the beauty of eating yakitori is being able to try parts of the chicken you wouldn\u2019t normally order.  In my opinion, these unusual cuts are my favorite.  At yakitori spots in Los Angeles, I always order chicken hearts as this is my favorite type of skewer.  At Yakitori Uno, I tried everything from chicken thighs to arteries.  My favorite pieces were Tsunagi (part that connects liver to the heart), Bonjiri (tail), and Seseri(neck).  All of the other pieces were really good too, but for these three I ordered a second round.  Take a look at my pictures to see all of the skewers I ordered.  In the end, I was extremely satisfied to be able to try so many different and unique cuts that we usually don\u2019t see in LA.  However, I felt it was only marginally better than the best places here.  I am a huge fan of the smoky and charcoal taste imparted on the skewers, and Yakitori Uno was a bit lacking in that department.  All the meats were still cooked to perfection and extremely delicious.  Maybe my expectations were just too high.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**7. Ramen Kai** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/Bp6LsnJ)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI had originally planned to go to Tomita\u2019s second branch as I really wanted to try a good Tsukemen restaurant during this trip.  Upon arriving to Tomita about 30 minutes early, there were already about 100 people in line ahead of me.  I had made plans to meet up with a friend in the afternoon, so after realizing I would not be able to make it in time, decided to look up another restaurant.  I just happened to stumble upon Ramen Kai as I was browsing for restaurants closer to where I was meeting my friend.  I made the decision solely based on the Tabelog score, not knowing the base for their ramen broth.  Upon arriving, I waited in a short line of about 5 people, and was quickly seated within 5 minutes.  After asking the hostess, she told me that the broth base was made of clams and sardines.  I was extremely excited as my favorite ramen broth of all time(Konjiki Hotogisu) was a clam based broth.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI decided to order the Tsukemen version of the broth with extra chashu.  Everything about the meal was extremely solid.  The noodles had the perfect amount of bounce, the chashu was very tender, and the broth was very flavorful.  I could definitely taste the sardines, but did not really get much of the clam.  The seafood flavor was amazing, but I felt it was a bit too salty and heavy.  Usually Tsukemen broth is a bit heavier than usual since it\u2019s supposed to act as somewhat of a dipping sauce for the noodles.  But this was a bit too much for me; my lips were quite dry afterwards.  If they toned down a bit on the salt and made the consistency a bit thinner, I think it would have been the perfect bowl of ramen as the seafood taste was amazing.  Maybe next time I\u2019ll try the normal ramen instead of Tsukemen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**6. Sushi Kuni** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/gallery/7CVmsY3)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nUni and Ikura over rice, what more else can I say.  These are probably two of my favorite seafood items.  Located in the Tsukiji Market, Sushi Kuni offers probably the best valued Uni bowl you can find.  For only 3500 yen, you get a very generous serving of Uni and Ikura.  If you\u2019ve had uni before, you are probably familiar with it\u2019s very high price tag.  Especially for good quality uni.  For me, there is a very thin margin that separates good uni from bad uni.  It usually is either tastes amazing and sweet, or it tastes like gym socks that have been steeping in the sea. I usually take the risk whenever I get the chance, as the reward is well worth the risk.  Luckily, Sushi Kuni was on the delicious side.  While not the best I\u2019ve had, this Uni had none of the foul ocean odor, and was even a little bit sweet.  This is probably the dish that I have missed the most as it is very difficult to find Uni bowls in Los Angeles at a fair price.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**5. Fukamachi** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/7Jzx6Gq)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nFukamachi is an upscale tempura restaurant that specializes in an omakase course.  The operation, run by a father and son duo, has been one of the most popular tempura restaurants for years.  The team decides on the best ingredients based on season and availability, forcing patrons to trust their judgement.  My brother had tried this restaurant during his one year stay in Japan and said I had to try it.  He told me that the vegetables were incredibly tasty, and he definitely did not lead me wrong.  I am not a big veggie eater, but this was one of the only places where I prefered the veg dishes over the meat.  Reservation was made 1 month in advance, but I think it could have been made a week or two prior. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn total there were about 5 meat dishes(prawn(2), prawn heads(2), cuttlefish, conger eel, silago), 5 vegetable dishes(asparagus,broad beans,tara bud, butterbur, bamboo shoots), seafood(clam) soup, dried fish appetizer, a pickled vegetable dish, a small tempura don(prawn,scallop), and a dessert, coming out to a total of 10,000 yen.  This option is only available during lunch, and during dinner the prices increase significantly.  To me, it seemed lunch was a much better value.  On your table, you are given a tempura sauce mixture(soy-sauce based), salt and lemon.  Upon receiving each dish, you are given instructions on which of the condiments to use with each piece. This was something that I really appreciated as I would have had no clue on which ingredients to use.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nEach piece was battered perfectly.  When you eat tempura here in the states, each piece is usually coated in a heavy layer of batter, completely covering the base.  At Fukamachi, the batter is light and transparent, allowing for the base to be visible. Although the batter was light, each piece was still perfectly crispy.  Each piece is deep fried in the best quality sesame oil found in Japan, which is changed frequently.  During my attendance, I noticed the oil was changed once.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy favorite pieces were the conger eel and the broad beans.  Eel is one of favorite dishes, and the eel here was extremely moist.  The broad beans were my favorite of the meal, I have never had broad beans before and now I am hooked.  It\u2019s difficult to describe the taste, but the texture  was similar to edamame just mushier.  They even look like edamame, but are much tastier and full of umami.   The butterbur and tara bud were other vegetable dishes that I had never tried before either but were extremely tasty.  I loved that the butterbur was slightly bitter, but it may not be for everyone.  Both of the vegetables are seasonal. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThere was not a single piece that I did not like, and eating here taught me the beauty of tempura.  It is seemingly simple, being just deep-fried fish and vegetables.  It requires true dedication to finding the best ingredients in order to get this cuisine right.  In this regard it is very similar to sushi.    Would absolutely recommend Fukamachi to anyone looking to experience a premium tempura experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**4. Menya Shou** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/cdunYFx)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nMenya Shou was a ramen restaurant that I had visited during my previous trip to Tokyo.  Because I lived in Shinjuku this time around, coming to Menya Shou was only a short walk away.  After checking into my hotel, this was the first restaurant I visited.  It took just one bite to remind me why I fell in love with the country, particularly the food.  Shio ramen is my favorite style of ramen, and this place does it just right.  While this ramen did not possess any characteristics that truly distinguishes it from other ramen, it does everything right.  The broth was of the perfect salt level and very easy to drink after the noodles were gone.  The noodles and chashu were perfect, I prefer my noodles with a little bounce so this really hit the spot for me.  It might be a matter of preference(since Shio is my fav), but Menya Shou was definitely my favorite ramen during this trip.  Check out my previous post for more ramen recommendations, I think the ramen selection was a bit better than this years.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**3. Spicy Curry Roka** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/UnvqaRn)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpicy Curry Roka is a small little shop that embodied everything great about Japan\u2019s food culture.  The patrons are diehard foodies; I waited at 7AM just to get a spot to come back at 12PM(store opens at 11).  An extremely sweet lady runs the operation by herself, well at least during operating hours.   It took about 2 tries coming back here before I figured out how the reservation system worked.  The owner can speak english, and was very helpful and thankful that I came back after failing the first two times.  After speaking to a patron who waited in line with me, i found out that she used to work at Yoshida Kare, one of the most legendary curry restaurants in Tokyo.  She\u2019s also a diehard curry fanatic(makes sense right?), who has traveled to Taiwan multiple times to study spicy curry.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe day that I visited, they had a special extra spicy curry.  The shop can only fit about 8 people at a time, and only one other patron opted for the extra spicy version.  She gave me a warning beforehand that it most people cannot handle it, which was a great sign for me.  I absolutely love spicy food, and I mean spicy to the point where I am sweating.  After taking the first bite, it was no surprise that she gave the warning.  My nostrils were immediately cleared and I felt the pressure in my head.  The other patron sitting next to me was drenched in sweat about halfway through.  I too began to feel the beads of sweat rolling down my forehead.  It was absolutely glorious.  Not only was the spice level perfect, the curry itself was extremely flavorful.   Saltiness was perfect, but the blend of spices/ingredients was sublime.  There was bits of beef inside the curry as well as on the side.  The beef i felt was a tiny bit overcooked, but still very tasty and a great complement to the curry.  If the beef was cooked perfectly, this would very likely be the top pick of the list.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt the end of the meal, I decided to purchase 5 boxes of her own instant curry blocks to bring home.  I could not get enough of it.  After chatting with the store owner for a bit, she bid me farewell and was extremely grateful that she had a customer all the way from Los Angeles.  Oh and did I mention the meal was only 1000 yen?  The entire experience was one of the highlights of my trip.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**2. Hakkoku** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/LagUJeC)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI do not eat omakase sushi often in Los Angeles, as I feel most of the places here are far too expensive for what you get.  And it makes sense, there is not an abundance of raw fish suppliers in the US so prices are much higher.  After coming back from my last trip, I was kicking myself for not trying an Omakase experience.  Much like with my venture with Yakitori, I made it a goal to try a top tier sushi restaurant in Japan.  I went down the list for the highest rated restaurants and attempted to get reservations at each one.  I finally hit when I got to Hakkoku.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI had heard about Hakkoku before after watching a video from Mark Wiens\u2019 youtube channel.  While he did not eat the Tokyo restaurant, the head chef held a pop up in Thailand where he was able to attend.  Chef Hiro was formerly the head chef at Tokami, another legendary sushi restaurant.  Known for having a wide variety of fish due to his extensive connection, Hakkoku serves up a whopping 30 pieces, and that number increases if you include the small appetizers served before and during the meal.  I thought this was the best restaurant if it was going to be the only, since I got to try such a large variety of fish.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI did not get a seat at Chef Hiro\u2019s counter, but instead got to sit with Daichi-San on the third counter.  There are three different counters at Hakkoku, each seat about 6 patrons.  While it would have been ideal to sit at Chef Hiro\u2019s counter, you are still eating the same fish that is served at his counter, the only difference being the timing and preparation. I thought Daichi-san did an amazing job, serving up what has to be the best sushi meal of my life.  Albeit I have only had about 5 total omakase experiences in Los Angeles, this completely blew the competition out of the water.  Each and every piece was insanely delicious.  There were cuts that I was trying for the very first time such as firefly squid, mantis shrimp, fat greening, cherry hybrid salmon, rudderfish, surf clam, blackthroat seaperch, etc.  Some of these fish I had never even heard of before. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI felt the rice really set Hakkoku apart from other restaurants.  Because a blend of different vinegars are used, the rice has a brown color.  It just works so amazingly well with every single piece of fish.  After binge watching videos on the best restaurants in Tabelog, it seemed most of the top sushi chefs agreed that the rice is the most important ingredient when it comes to sushi.  The fish only acts as a topping.  I finally came to understand that concept after eating here, the rice was unbelievably good.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy favorite pieces would have to be the Uni, Aji, Hotaru Ika, ankimo, and kohada.  The meal also came with the full array of tuna (lean,medium fatty, fatty, marinated) which was great, but lacked the wow factor that these other pieces possessed.  The Aji was incredibly meaty, this was probably the piece that stuck with me the most.  Just looking at the picture of it makes my mouth water and brings back so many good memories from the meal.  The Hotaru Ika was extremely unique; it was incredibly sweet.  Ankimo is another one of my favorites, and the piece at Hakkoku was by far the best I\u2019ve had.  It was very creamy and fat, kinda reminiscent of foie gras but without the duck aroma.  The Uni, while not the best I\u2019ve had, was still insanely sweet and creamy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nService at the restaurant was the icing on the cake.  The server, Angie, was extremely attentive and very sweet.  She sparked up a conversation with all of the patrons, seeming to genuinely care about everyone\u2019s dining experience.  After the meal, I stayed back and chatted with Angie and Daichi-san, who invited me to get drinks the next day.  They shared their experiences of working in a sushi restaurant.  Hearing their stories really made me appreciate the experience even more as I found out just how much work goes into crafting the ultimate dining experience.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**1. Seirinkan** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/pjj6T4n)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI apologize in advance for having pizza as my number one selection, but I have absolutely no shame in making this decision.  Pizza is one of my favorite foods, and prior to this trip I went on a Keto diet so I was dying for a slice.  You hear a lot about Japan having great pizza, and I didn\u2019t doubt it one bit.  For a country that fetishized food so deeply, I think you can find great food from just about any type of cuisine.  I learned about Seirinkan through a popular video posted on Eater\u2019s Youtube channel.  Of course I had to check Tabelog first to see it was the real deal.  I had also planned on doing some shopping in Naka-Meguro so it fit perfectly into my schedule.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI arrive about 30 minutes early thinking there would be a line, but there was no one there.  Shocking, as most restaurants rated 3.7 and above usually have a line.  Also since it was featured on Eater, I was almost certain I\u2019d have to wait.  I take a quick walk, buy a beer at a nearby convenience store, and arrive back about 15 minutes early to wait in line.  One of the staff notices me waiting outside and decides to open up early, leading me into a seat on the top floor.  The decor is very unique, reminding me of an old warehouse or factory.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI decide to go with the classic margherita as it is one of the only two items on the list, with the other being marinara.  The pizza arrives relatively quickly, and I immediately dig in with my fork and knife.  Seirinkan\u2019s pizza does not come cut, so I divide it up into individual, holdable slices.  I am immediately blown away by the crust/dough.  Perfectly crisp and amazingly tasteful without being too salty.  Usually the middle of the pie is the soggiest, but this one was crispy throughout.  The crust tasted amazing on its own as well. I would come back just to eat the dough without the sauce and cheese, which were both also amazing.  The mozzarella and tomato were extremely fresh and flavorful, while not overpowering the dough. They were the perfect complements.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI heavily contemplated ordering another pie, but had to resist as I was meeting with friends later that night for food and drinks.   If that were not the case, I absolutely would have ordered another.  I recognized the chef from the Eater video as I exited the restaurant, and  immediately bowed and praised his pizza.  I told him it was the best pizza I have ever had, and his face just lit up.  This is what chefs in Japan live for.  They do not care at all about monetary gain or fame, they just want to make their patrons happy.  And this is why I love Japan so much.",

There are plenty of high end restaurants now that take reservations online. I mainly used by Visa Concierge service.  Check your credit card to see if you have this service, most do.  Once you call in/email the card concierge, they handle the whole reservation for you",

I think its best to call first as they require quite a bit of information from you.  Afterwards, you can request reservations through email as they already have your information on file.  To answer your question, you do not have to stay on the phone the whole time.  After you place your request for a reservation, either thru phone or email, they will call/reach out the restaurant for you at the next earliest availability.  Then they will email you back confirming whether or not you could get the reservation.  \n\nMake sure you are very specific with the restaurant details, its best to provide address and phone number of the restaurant in case they get anything wrong.  Also make sure you choose a date/small date range and time of when you'd like you res to be.  Don't just say anytime in September, be specific with date and time.  If you are staying in a hotel, they may also request your hotel's information as its sometimes easier for the hotel to make the reservation for them.  Do not worry though, you will never have to speak to your hotel directly.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions !",

Very peaceful inside.\n\nCalico Cat Cafe - I love cats so this was a very nice treat.  There are like 50 cats in there\n\nGodzilla statue - You can catch a movie here\n\nGolden Gai - Not sure if you like drinking, but there are really cool bars here.  Theres also another alley where there are tons of food stalls (mainly yakitori) i forgot the name tho.\n\nShinjuku is kinda like the Hollywood of Tokyo, very touristy, crowded, and kinda smutty.  It's very geared towards nightlife so there are plenty of bars/clubs.  There's a lotta illegal activity(prostitution) so be wary of the guys trying to get you to enter their shop.\n\nFor food, definitely try out Spicy Curry Roka and Menya Shou, both on my list.  There's also a 1 michelin star sardine restaurant that is only 1000 yen for the lunch set called Nakajima.  This was included on my last year post.",

I already have a reservation at your #1, so I'm glad to hear it was that good. Have you had Curry Bondy? It was the best curry I had on a previous trip, and I'm wondering how it compares to your favorite spot (on flavor, not spice).",

It was my birthday so I thought fuck it. I am sure it is the most I will ever spend on a meal. Entertaining and educational but you're paying for the product and the amount of luxury ingredients was pretty insane. Massive amounts of kegani and absolutely ridiculous tuna as well as matsutake mushroom, hamo, sweetfish, abalone, wild unagi, Bafun uni.. etc . Although the chef asked me at the end what my favourite piece was and I said it was the kohada, which was true, and he seemed pretty pleased with that. It was a blast.",

I'm traveling with my brother and he's only able to get off of work for 10 days, so this is what we have to work with unfortunately. To preface, I know trying to fit all of these cities in is hard but the reasons I wanted to go to Japan were Arashiyama, Fushimi Inari, Tokyo as a whole, &amp; Dotonbori.   \n\n\nOur hotels are at Ueno Eki Minami in Tokyo, then Machiya Kamiumeya in Kyoto for 2 days, 1 day in Cross Hotel Osaka, and the last 2 days in Hotel Gracery Shinjuku. How's this for a first time itinerary?\n\nDay 1 (6/7) - Ueno area #1\n\n* Arrive at HND at 4 PM\n* Bus or train to APA Ueno Eki Minami\n* Get some food maybe at Ameyoko\n\nDay 2 (6/8) - Ginza and Maranouchi\n\n* Tokyo Station   \n* **Imperial Palace Gardens**\n* Kokyo Gaien National Garden    \n* BIQLO\n* **Ginza Art Aquarium**    \n* Shin Maranouchi building for pizza and street view\n\n  \nDay 3 (6/9) - Nakano Broadway &amp; Ikebekuro\n\n* **Nakano Broadway**    \n* Mandarake Annex\n* Daiso    \n* Lashinbang Nakano\n* Gamestation Nakano    \n* Nakano Shrine\n* Ikebekuro Sunshine Mall    \n* **Pok\u00e9mon Center DX**\n\nDay 4 (6/10) - Ueno area\n\n* Ameyoko    \n* Ueno Park\n* Asakusa Shrine    \n* **Senso-ji**\n\nDay 5 (6/11) - Kyoto\n\n* Nozomi Shinkansen to Kyoto Hotel Machiya Kamiumeya\n* Gion     \n* **Arashiyama**  \n\n\nDay 6 (6/12) - Nara and Kyoto\n\n* **Fushimi Inari first thing in the morning**   \n*  Travel to Nara\n* **Toda-ji**    \n* Nara Park\n* Try melon pan somewhere\n* Go back to Kyoto\n\nDay 7 (6/13) - Osaka\n\n* Travel from Kyoto to Osaka\n* Ajinoya    \n* **Walk around dotonbori**\n* Shinsaibashi shopping street    \n* Osaka castle\n* Kuromon market in the evening maybe if not exhausted\n\nDay 8 - (6/14) Tokyo (Akihabara)\n\n* **Animate**    \n* **K-books**\n* **Kotobukiya**    \n* Train to Harajuku    \n* Kawaii Monster Cafe\n* Yoyogi Park  \n*   **Walk to Shibuya** center street through ometesando for dinner\n\nDay 9 - Fly home after getting ramen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this a doable itinerary?

Thank you for the help!",

You can get two hours or so of shopping in before going to Nakano vs. if you go to Nakano first you're really not getting anything done until noon.\n\nThe Kawaii Monster Cafe closed during Covid 19.  So you are not going there.",

            "comment": "Lots of cool plans on here! What is your luggage situation? If you are planning on having large suitcases they are really going to slow you down. I was just in Japan in May and moving hotels between Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka ate up 1/2 to 2/3 of our travel days with the shinkansen and lugging our big suitcases around on local transit. \n\nYou have a ton you want to do so I'd say make sure to do shrines in the morning because they open early and shop in the afternoons. We found most stores are open 10-7 or even 12-7 (especially in Akihabara) so shopping time is very limited and you have to really plan your days around it. Shrines close early (usually before 6). I would really really recommend reducing how much you want to do though because it will be super rushed. Have a great trip!",

Also (not to add another thing to your list lol) but I see you're interested in Mandarake, my favourite one I went to while I was in Japan was Umeda! It's insane and huge and built like a cave with a big mammoth skeleton in it I think? It was wild lol",

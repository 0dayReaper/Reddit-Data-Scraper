    "postText": "Hi everybody! Last week my SO and I came back from a 15 days trip to Japan. I just wanted to share some thoughts since reading in this sub has helped us so much and maybe some info here can help someone else as well.\n\nI'm not going to go into every details of every day but I posted some time ago an itinerary check and we stick pretty much to it if you're curious. I will break down by Cities.\n\nBut  let's begin with the flights. From Germany we had a direct flight to Narita, it was a 13 hrs flight. We thought that a direct flight would be better because you can sleep and don't have to deal with layover and such, but I don't know if I would do it again. We took JAL (Japan Airlines) and the seats were not so comfortable. I saw people sleep al the way through, but I personally couldn't. The food was pretty terrible too (didn't expect much, but still).\n\nWe departed in the evening and arrived at 5-6 pm there and that was good for the Jet Lag: while we got our bearings, exchange some money and a Narita express ticket, check in and what have you, once we were in our room we went straight to bed and woke up in the morning rested and ready to go.\n\nTOKYO\n\nWe visited the usual stuff I would say, maybe an outlier has been the Kirby Cafe. I was curious of the experience in one of these cafes and booked in advance. It was kinda fun, the food was ok but expensive, but the presentation and the cafe itself were perfect I would say. I bought a Kirby shaped pizza plate at the gift shop and I am very happy about it, it's super funny.\n\nThe Ghibli Museum was better than I expected: there was (is?) an installation about Future boy Conan that was super cool and we watched a beautiful short. It's a little out of the way to reach but if you're a fan I would say it's worth it.\n\nWe went one evening to the Meguro river: we read that there were some lights for the Sakura and it was supposed to be a very nice sight. I don't know if it was too late or what, but there were no lights on, so we regretted getting there instead of somewhere else.\n\nHAKONE\n\nWe took the shinkansen to Odawara and left our luggage in a coin locker to go spend a night in an Onsen in Hakone. The overall vibe was very cool, everybody in Yukata and chilling. We visited the lake coming down with the ropeway. We reached the big Torii in the water and snapped a couple of cool pics. Came back with the ferry. Overall, a super relaxing and fun experience.\n\nNAGOYA ; KISO VALLEY\n\nMore chaotic than Tokyo I would say. A lot of people everywhere. We didn't saw much of the city itself but we took a day trip to do the Magome-Tsumago trail. Absolutely worth it, it was one of the highlight of the whole trip. We had to cut it short because of public transport, the last bus to the train station was very early in the afternoon, so check in advance and plan accordingly.\n\nIn hindsight I would have done like Hakone and try to spent the night somewhere in trail or nearby.\n\nI also tried the Hitsumabushi dish in Nagoya and I think it's the best thing I ate in Japan.\n\nKYOTO\n\nIncredible city during cherry blossom. The philosopher path was beautiful and also the Kiyomizu-dera temple at sunset. The fish market was also a pretty fun and delicious experience.\n\nWe had a bike tour booked on [this site](https://www.magical-trip.com/) but they canceled it the day before saying that there were no guides available to do it. We booked it like in January and we were pretty mad about it also because everything else was booked on the site till may, so it's not that there was an alternative. I mean, they should know that people organize these stuff months in advance, they could at least warn us a week or two before. They refund us immediately tho, so there's that.\n\nOSAKA\n\nWe had a lot of fun walking through Dotonbori and Shinsekai in the evening, we took some very cool pictures and ate very well. We also went to Nara: we woke up pretty early so there were no queue for T\u014ddai-ji and we had a lot of time to admire the statue properly. Also, seeing all the deer and feed them was stupidly fun.\n\nWe also went to Universal studio and I would say it was a pretty miserable experience all things considered. People everywhere already one and a half hour before official opening. I wanted to go there especially for the Nintendo World and we manage to get the timed entry ticket but at 5pm. It was super fun, but every mini game had like a 15-20 mins queue and it started raining as soon as we entered. It took us 2 hrs to do every game and \"beat\" bowser jr. and by that time the Mario Kart attraction closed. So if you have a late entry there, first thing you should do is the queue for Mario Kart and then you can roam around and do the games. In hindsight i would've just shilled out for the more expensive ticket with the timed entry already secured. I also did the Monster hunter VR experience that was unexpectedly cool, but it was only in Japanese and you have to buy a ticket for it.\n\nGENERAL\n\nOverall it was a great trip. People there are very kind and helpful, we didn't have any problems whatsoever. The majority of the staff people we had to deal with spoke english, but not everybody (for example, surprisingly, at Universal Studio we had some problems).\n\nI must also say that it is a country that it's not really comfortable for big or tall people, of which I am both. Seats and tables of every kind almost everywhere are very low and narrow. Don't get me started on public restrooms and trains. Also some rooms we stayed had no space to hang or store stuff. Not even a chair. So if you have big luggages it can become an issue.\n\nRegarding the JR pass, I would say for us it was worth it in the end. Especially considering that in Osaka we just used that for public transport. Booking the shinkansen at the ticket machine was pretty easy and we had no issues whatsoever. The only thing to consider is that for large luggage, you have to book a special ticket for it and there is limited availability, so it's something to considered that we didn't know. Our big luggage fit in the overhead tho, so no problem booking trains even on the same day.\n\nOverall it was not so expensive, food especially. We are already planning of doing a \"summer\" trip in a couple of years if we can.\n\nIt was pretty surreal in general, you see this culture in games and media for all your life and than you get to be there and it's super jarring and fun.",

I also agree about the people, they seem to forget they are in a temple or shrine, not in an amusement park. I saw some people taking pictures of people praying, like they were performing something to entertain tourists. I thought it was very distasteful. \n\nAnyway, Todai-ji was in particular worth it because we were really among the first and we could take our time. Behind us we saw like 3-4 group of school kids with their teacher, se we were very very lucky.\n\nThing is some stuff it's simply not open or accessible too early in the morning.",

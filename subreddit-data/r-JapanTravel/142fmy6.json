On Day 1 you can use the \"ICOCA and Haruka\" foreigner discount. \n\nUnless you are viewing plum or cherry blossoms or trying to collect the 100 castle stamps, Osaka castle is a waste of time after Himeji castle.  I would do Nara Park on day 4 and head to Dotonbori afterwards.",

Although Day 2\u2019s Nara visit might be a bridge too far. \n\nIgnore the other poster, Osaka and Himeji are both castles but offer different experiences. Himeji is largely the real deal, not a top to bottom reconstruction like Osaka. But Osaka had more going on in the inside with a wonderful museum mostly dedicated to Hideyoshi.",

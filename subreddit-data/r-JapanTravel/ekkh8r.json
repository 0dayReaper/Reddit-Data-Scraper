    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nWhat's one of the great things about Japan? Safety standards! What does Tokyo have a lot of? Construction!\n\n[I'm looking for masks/respirators similar to these](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/12/masks-smoke-bushfires-nsw-where-to-buy/) to bring home for friends and family with respiratory problems from 1+ month of hazardous air quality levels. Any store around the Yamanote line would be fine.\n\nI'm making a wild assumption that Japanese people also have to deal with shitty air quality when it blows over from mainland China, so hopefully some of you all have experience with this kinda thing. Looking for something between your regular convenience store facemask and full on military hardware.\n\nAny help would be awesome. Thanks everyone on JapanTravel for all the help and advice you consistently provide :) \n\nCheers!",

Business names to search for:\n\n* Beaver Tozan\n* Kuroganeya\n* Shimachu\n* Kohnan / Kohnan Pro (Pro is exclusively contractor-grade stuff)\n* Super Viva Home\n* Joyfull Honda\n\nThe last two are huge and sell to plenty of contractors. The down side to \"huge\" is they tend to be far from public transportation, and none are inside the Yamanote line. Smaller ones near suburban stations tend to not have the more specialized items. There is a Beaver Tozan in between Kyodo and Chitose-funabashi station, 15 minutes west of Shinjuku.\n\nYou can try Tokyu Hands in Shibuya, the tool floor. Hands tends to have things, but not have a lot of any particular thing in stock.\n\nThere's also [Amazon.co.jp](https://Amazon.co.jp). You can get delivery to (and pay at, in cash) a convenience store. Delivery in 2-3 days.\n\nThe air that blows over from China tends to leave sticky dust on outdoor things. Tends not to turn the sky orange.",

The ordinary cloth masks are to protect against pollen, cold weather and just to avoid coughing in public. \n\nFor the N95 masks, some models have a optional mini fan that helps circulate air within the mask, making it less stuffy and easier to breathe.\n\nIf you have a stop-over in Singapore Malaysia or Indonesia, can try the local pharmacies here too. The local pharmacies have a ready stock given the recurring yearly haze from burning of forests in Indonesia.",

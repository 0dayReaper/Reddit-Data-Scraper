Chuzenji and Keagon Falls are a ways from Toshogu shrine.  It also might be quite cold.\n\n Kawaguchiko (fuji 5 Lakes) and Hakone (where the round course is) are a good 2+ hours from one another and each are around 2 or so hours from Tokyo.  Unless you are paying for some sort of day tour from Tokyo, which makes the transfers around Kawaguchiko and Kawaguchiko to Hakone seamless, I don't think you are going to realistically be doing both in one day together. Most of the tours also don't do the round course cause they transport you around on their own.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by too much time in Kyoto.  You arrive on the 5th from Kanazawa at some point and then have the 6th and 7th before on the 8th you go to Nara and the 9th you go all the way back to the Ghibli Park.  On the 10th you leave for Osaka.\n\nDepending on where you are staying in Osaka and where you are staying in Kyoto, it's more like 1 hour.  It's \\~30 minutes from Kyoto Station to Osaka or Shin-Osaka Station.  Outside USJ, your Osaka days feel light to me, but I usually visit Osaka from Kyoto outside of going to USJ.\n\nGood luck!",

What we will do is reduce from 4 nights in Osaka to 3, and also add on Nara from Osaka rather than from Kyoto. So we are essentially adding 2 days to Kyoto.   \n\n\nAnd in regard to Ghibli, it does seem like backtrekking. We are going to consider how we can do Ghibli on the way back to Tokyo from Osaka since it makes more sense directionally.",

The one part that might be tough is Odaiba since its not close to any of the rest of the areas you mentioned.\n\nIf you are willing to make long days of it I'd try the following:\n\nDay 1: AM - Shibuya + Harajuku + Meiji-Jingu shrine (near Harajuku) and well worth the visit.  \nPM - Shinjuku and Golden Gai (its in Shinjuku).  If you want a nice view of the city (for free!) check out the Tokyo Metropolitan Govt Building.  Its a twin towered skyscraper about 10 minutes walk from Shinjuku station.  There's a free observation deck on the 45th floor one of the towers.\n\nDay 2 (with Odaiba):  AM: Start at Odaiba in the morning and explore.  Then take one of the Sumida river cruise boats from Odaiba to Asakusa.  \nPM:  Visit Senso-Ji and explore in the early afternoon, head to Akihabara after as it starts to get dark.\n\nDay 2 (without Odaiba). AM:  Start at the Sky Tree in Sumida city, not free but great views, there's a huge shopping complex at the base, so you can get a similar experience for shopping as you would in Odaiba.   \nPM: Visit Senso-Ji and explore in the early afternoon, head to Akihabara after as it starts to get dark.\n\nIf you are REALLY ambitious or you don't spend too much time on the shopping part you could try and do all of that on Day 2 but its a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Toshogu Shrine: Ornate shrine complex, mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu.  \nKegon Falls: One of Japan's most famous waterfalls.  \nLake Chuzenji: Scenic lake in the mountains of Nikko National Park.\n\nDoable if you start out early and are in moderately good shape, however its going to be cold.  Nikko temps are in the 30-50\u00b0 range (F) in December.  \n\n\n&gt;Day trip to Mount Fuji (Dec 2, \\~2 hours one way from Tokyo to Hakone):  \nFuji Five Lakes region: Scenic area around Mount Fuji.  \nHakone Round Course: A popular sightseeing route offering great views of Mount Fuji.\n\nBasically not doable.  For one Hakone is to the SE of Mt. Fuji, the 5 lakes are to the North and cover a large area.  Even visiting just one of the lakes is a day trip all on its own.  Pick one or the other, but I don't think both are going to be achievable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Kanazawa (2 nights: Dec 3 - Dec 5, \\~2.5 hours from Tokyo by Shinkansen)  \nExplore Kanazawa:  \nKenrokuen Garden: One of Japan's top three landscape gardens.  \nKanazawa Castle: Historic castle with beautiful grounds.  \nHigashi Chaya District: Traditional teahouse district with preserved wooden buildings.  \n21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art: Innovative museum showcasing contemporary art.\n\n2.5 hours from Tokyo Station, keep in mind Tokyo is quite large so you have to factor in getting to the nearest Shinkansen stop from your hotel/airbnb.  Otherwise this all sounds doable in a day or 2 as they are all near each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Day trip to Nara (Dec 8, \\~1 hour one way from Kyoto):\n\nIMO you should stop in Nara on your way from Kyoto to Osaka, otherwise you are backtracking a lot.  You could easily start out in the morning from Kyoto on your last day, spend the day in Nara, and finish in Osaka by the evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Day trip to Ghibli Park (Dec 9, \\~2 hours one way from Kyoto to Nagoya):  \nGhibli Park: Themed park celebrating the works of Studio Ghibli.\n\nI would put this after Osaka.  Nagoya is on the way to Tokyo from Osaka anyway.  That said I'd also make sure you have tickets in advance, they are hard to come by now.\n\nOtherwise things seem reasonable, however to make things a little easier you might consider staying in Kyoto and taking a couple of day trips to Osaka.",

Get to sleep early so you can start early the next day.\n* Nov 29th - Asakusa, Sky Tree, Akihabara\n* Nov 30th - Shibuya, Harajuku, Meiji Jingu, Shinjuku (Golden gai)\n* Dec 1st - Nikko\n* Dec 2nd - Imperial Palace and Ueno\n\nKANAZAWA HOTEL\n\n* Dec 3rd - AM: Travel to Kanazawa.  PM: Art Museum\n* Dec 4th - Kanazawa Castle, Gardens, and Higashi Chaya District\n\nKYOTO HOTEL\n\n* Dec 5th - AM: Travel to Kyoto.  PM: Kiyomizu Dera and Gion\n* Dec 6th - Nishiki Fish Market, Kinkakuji, Arashiyama.  Take it easier today, tomorrow will be busy.\n* Dec 7th - Universal Studios Japan.  This is a Thursday which is usually the least busy day for visiting theme parks in Japan.  Arrive early and stay as late as you want to make the most out of it.  If you can afford it consider paying extra for fast access to some of the popular rides.  Prioritize the Nintendo area.\n* Dec 8th - Fushimi-inari taisha and anything else in Kyoto that interests you\n* Dec 9th - Osaka Castle and I also recommend the nearby Osaka History Museum, Dotonbori and maybe Umeda Sky Building if you have time.  Its ok, but for the view I'd recommend Harukas 300 in south part of Osaka instead.  \n* Dec 10th - Nara\n* Dec 11th - Kobe OR travel to Nagoya and visit the Toyota automobile museum. Spend the night in Nagoya/Toyota\n\nTOKYO HOTEL\n\n* Dec 12th - Ghibli Park \n* Dec 13th - Travel to Tokyo, Roppongi\n* Dec 14th - DisneySea\n* Dec 15th - Imperial Palace and Ueno Park\n* Dec 16th - Anything else you want to do in Tokyo (don't forget souvenirs for your friends back home!\n* Dec 17th - Fly back to Boston.",

Even though its further from Nara, you can consider travelling to Nara from there. I used it as a base to do day trips to Nara, Kobe, Himeji and have delicious cheap dinners and massages in Osaka.  \nI didn't go to Hiroshima-based off reviews on reddit it seems like it's worth spending a night or two there.",

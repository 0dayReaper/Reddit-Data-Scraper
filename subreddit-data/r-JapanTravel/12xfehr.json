    "postText": "\n\n\nHi everybody, my girlfriend and I have been lurking on this sub for a while as we build our Japan itinerary for this June/July.\n\nThe feedback I see most frequently on this sub is that travelers are trying to pack too much into each day. We're afraid of doing that, but we're also going back and forth on how long each of our activities will take. \n\nWe\u2019re looking for a mix of having a bunch of options on the schedule for each day, but walking around and letting things happen naturally without feeling the pressure to do absolutely everything. We like to be planned to keep ourselves organized, but prioritize exploring and enjoying our time on our feet. We don\u2019t have any must-eat restaurants, but prefer to check out the food around us depending on where we end up.\n\nThat said, are we overbooked in Tokyo and Kyoto? We figured that we\u2019d have a string of busy days first, then our pace would slow down about halfway through as we plan less and incorporate more free wandering time. On the other hand, are we totally missing something that we should\u2019ve incorporated? Finally, does the loop we\u2019re making from Tokyo to Tokyo seem to make sense? We\u2019ll be purchasing the JR Pass as well as the local transportation passes in each place.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**Fri, June 23 (Arrive 2:30 PM at NRT)**\n\n* Settle in at Airbnb in Kabukicho\n* Walk around, get dinner, go to bed early\n\n**Sat, June 24 Tokyo**\n\n*Shinjuku*\n\n* Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\n* Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\n* Omoide Yokocho \n* Golden Gai \n\n*Shibuya (and around)*\n\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Wander Dogenzaka - ramen shops, pubs, izakayas \n\n**Sun, June 25 Tokyo**\n\n*Harajuku (and around)*\n\n* Yoyogi Park\n\n* Meiji Jingu\n* Harajuku - walk Takeshita Dori\n* Walk down through Omotesando, Aoyama, and Roppongi \n* Tokyo Whisky Library\n* Tokyo City View Observation Deck?\n* Tokyo Midtown Mall\n\n**Mon, June 26 Tokyo**\n\n*Akihabara*\n\n* Wander streets and shops\n\n*Asakusa and Ueno Park*\n\n* Walk in Ueno Park\n* Senso-Ji\n* Nakamise Shopping Street\n\n* Tokyo Station nearby (along with Ramen Street, Character Street, and Food Street)\n\n**Tues, June 27 Tokyo**\n\n* Toyosu Market or Tsukiji Market\n* teamLab Planets \n* Ginza walking and shopping\n* Imperial Castle\n\n**Weds, June 28 Tokyo**\n\n* Nikko day trip\n\n**Thurs, June 29 Tokyo to Hakone**\n\n* Leave early in the morning for Hakone\u2014stay in Hakone Yumoto\n* Hakone Loop\n\n**Fri, June 30 Hakone to Kyoto**\n\n* Leave midday/afternoon for Kyoto\n* Nishiki Market for dinner\n* Walk Gion and/or Ponto-cho?\n\n**Sat, July 1 Kyoto**\n\n* Leave early morning for Fushimi Inari and walk to top\n* Lunch around Kyoto Station\n* Kyoto Ukiyo-e Museum\n* Walk and eat as we explore area\n\n**Sun, July 2 Kyoto**\n\n*Arashiyama*\n\n* Sagano Scenic Railway\n* Togetsuky\u014d Bridge\n* Bamboo Grove of Arashiyama (9AM)\n* Tenryuji Temple (Open 8:30-5)\n* Ryoanji Temple \n* Lunch near temple at Yodafu \n* Kinkaku ji Temple (Golden Pavilion)\n* Iwatayama Monkey Park \n\n**Mon, July 3 Kyoto**\n\n*Higashiyama*\n\n* Kiyomizu-dera Temple\n* Chion-In\n* Maruyama-koen\n* Konchi-in\n* Nanzen-ji \n* Kotokou-an\n* Oku-no-in\n* up the Path of Philosophy to \n* Honen-in \n* Ginkaku-ji Temple (Silver Pavilion)\n\n**Tues, July 4 Kyoto to Osaka**\n\n* Nijo-jo Castle\n* Kyoto Imperial Palace\n* Daitoku-ji\n* Kyoto Botanical Gardens\n* Kamogamo-jinja\n* Take late train to Osaka\n\n**Weds, July 5 Osaka**\n\n* Osaka Castle\n* Nishinomaru Garden\n* Kuromon Ichiba Market\n* Osaka Station\n* Umeda Sky Building\n* Walk around Namba\n\n**Thurs, July 6 Osaka**\n\n* Nara day trip\n\n**Fri, July 7 Osaka**\n\n* Asahi Tour\n* Tempozan Ferris Wheel\n* Shinsekai and Tsutenkaku\n* Eat as much as we can as we go \n\n**Sat, July 8 Osaka to Kinosaki**\n\n* Leave early  for Kinosaki\n* Check into ryokan and use onsens in town\n\n**Sun, July 9 Kinosaki**\n\n* Rent bikes\n* Beach and onsens\n\n**Mon, July 10 Kinosaki to Magome**\n\n* Leave early for Magome\n\n**Tues, July 11 Magome/Tsumago**\n\n* Magome/Tsumago trail\n\n**Weds, July 12 Magome/Tsumago to Tokyo**\n\n* Leave for Tokyo in the morning\n* Flex time for eating/exploring/prepping for departure next day\n\n\n**Thurs, July 13 Tokyo (Depart 5:15 PM from HND)**",

I\u2019ve been searching this sub and haven\u2019t found many recommendations for van hire agencies. I had a positive experience with [this bunch](https://japanrv-rental.com/)today. Granted, I haven\u2019t seen nor driven the thing yet but they were really helpful with the booking process and even cancelled and rebooked for free when I mistakenly chose the wrong pickup office. They even sent through some photos of my ride and helpful maps. Soooo\u2026let\u2019s call it a provisional rolling accommodation recommendation. \n\nNow hit me with your hotel picks in Sapporo. I\u2019ll be due for a wee bit of luxury after a week on the road.",

            "comment": "Having stayed in Sapporo many times, both in hotels and Airbnb's, I'd say I prefer Airbnb's up there. Of course YMMV but both times Mt hosts were incredible, the places clean and with plenty of space.\n\nAs far as locations go, Sapporo isn't as huge as other major cities in Japan so even if you stay somewhere off-center, getting to Susukino will take 10-15 minutes by train. I enjoyed staying in Toyohira. Depending on where, you can walk along the river and over bridges, through Nakajima Koen into Susukino.\n\nSome areas west in the southwest of Susukino might not be suited for people who don't want to walk past host clubs and soaplands.",

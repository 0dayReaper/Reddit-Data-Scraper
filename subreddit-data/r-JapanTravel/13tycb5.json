    "postText": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m going to Japan and I wanted to ask some important questions. My itinerary is shown below.\n\n1. Which rail passes/cards would I need? This is my main concern as I have been researching this but some clarification would be greatly appreciated, especially when travelling to Osaka and Kyoto.\n2. My traveling partner eats only chicken and some fish (this is just being selective), so I haven\u2019t really put specific places for lunch or dinner (I don\u2019t have any dietary requirements). Any recommendations for food places that are easily accessible to foreigners would be helpful.\n3. Best options for cell data in Japan since my traveling partner doesn\u2019t have international coverage?\n4. Please feel free to recommend anything you think is good also my schedule might be alittle too packed so anything you think is too packed would be helpful for planning (not everything on the itinerary is absolute, only the things that are in bold and italic.)Thank you in advance.\n\nNote: sorry about the weird text positioning, i was directly copying thing from my own excel sheet so the text is all over the place.\n\n17/06/23 - Tokyo (Arrive/Shinjuku/Harajuku)\n\n|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|Hotel|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Hotel Check-In Hachiko Memorial Statue                             Shibuya Scramble Crossing|Animate Shibuya            Pokemon Center Shibuya                            Lunch|Harajuku                           ***Shibuya Sky***                  Dinner|Daiwa Roynet Hotel GINZA PREMIER|\n\n18/06/23 - Tokyo (Akihabara/Ikebukuro)\n\n|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|Hotel|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Akihabara Radio Kaiken                          Mandarake Complex      Cardshop Magi (+ other trading card stores)                          Fuku Fuku Toreka          Lunch|Gashapon Ikebukuro Main Store                     Pokemon Center Mega Tokyo                     Sunshine City|Dinner|Daiwa Roynet Hotel GINZA PREMIER|\n\n19/06/23 - Tokyo\n\n|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|Hotel|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Suga Jinja (pretty much a free day)|Lunch|Dinner (maybe Gyopao Gyoza Shinjuku ???)|Daiwa Roynet Hotel GINZA PREMIER|\n\n20/06/23 - Tokyo (Odaiba)\n\n|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|Hotel|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|***Pokemon Cafe***|Tsukiji Outer Market    Odaiba                                 Aqua City|Unicorn Gundam Statue                                     Dinner|Daiwa Roynet Hotel GINZA PREMIER|\n\n21/06/23 - Tokyo\n\n|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|Hotel|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tokyo Skytree (Pokemon Center Skytree Town)|Lunch|Dinner|Daiwa Roynet Hotel GINZA PREMIER|\n\n22/06/23 - Tokyo/Osaka\n\n|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|Hotel|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Check-Out of Hotel + Train to Osaka|Osaka Castle                    Kuromon Ichiba Market                        Dragon star Nippombashi-nigo (personal reasons)       Nipponbashi Denden Town                         Shitenno-ji                Shinsaibashi PARCO      Check-In to Hotel to Lunch|Dontonbori                      America-mura              Dinner|HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi|\n\n23/06/23 - Osaka/Kyoto\n\n|Morning|Afternoon|Evening|Hotel|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Train to Kyoto                  Fushimi Inari Taisha       Nishiki Market                ***KIMONO TEA CEREMONY MAIKOYA KYOTO***                               Lunch|Gion                              Yasaka-jinja Shrine          Starbucks Coffee - Kyoto Ninenzaka Yasaka Chaya|Kiyomizu-dera                 Dinner (potentially Ramen Ten ???)

Compared to the west I found they don\u2019t really give a shit about your needs. The food is what it is. If you have dietary restriction at all, learn how to communicate that clearly in Japanese beforehand. I watched a girl jam Google translate in the chefs face and he pointed her out the door.",

Super easy to set up if you have a phone that can do eSim. I\u2019d recommend getting an IC card on your phone for the local metros and buses. On iPhone you just go to the wallet app and add a transit card and choose suica or pasmo. You may want to look at either the JR rail pass or the JR Kansai Pass and see if it would save you money.",

Mandarake and a lot of the shops in Akihabara open more like 11 to noon.  So it makes more sense to do Ikebukuro first.\n\nI assume you already have tickets, but I also don't know why you would pick to go to USJ on a Saturday over a Friday.  Saturday and Sunday tend to be the most crowded days at amusement parks unless it is a National holiday.\n\nGood luck!",

Mandarake doesn't tend to open until noon vs most of the shops in Sunshine 60 will open at 10.  If they want more time in Akihabara they can go from 1 until 8 and eat dinner there before going back to their hotel.",

    "postText": "Purchased four e-tickets (with four sets of QR code) for April 27th Tokyo Disneyland entry on one reservation. A kid got sick on the day of entry, so my mom stayed at the hotel to take care of her, resulting two unused tickets. Since I've also purchased the No-show Refund upgrade, I was trying to claim the unused tickets for refund. \n\nInitially, the customer service agreed that I was eligible to make the claim, and they just needed to notify the supplier for cancellation, then the refund will be processed. No updates for 15 days, then when I reached out to them again, they told me because I partially used two of the four tickets, therefore the supplier refused to cancel, and they could not refund me because of that. Now it is stated in their terms &amp; conditions of the No-show Refund package that \"Partial No-show Refund Claims\" is accepted. I pointed this out to them, still I was refused again with no further explanation. \n\nFor anyone seeing this, if you're planning to buy multiple e-tickets with No-show Refund upgrade from this site, make sure you buy each of them in their own separate reservation, just in case! Though, judging from this , I can only imagine what other excuses they can come up.",

CC said tickets already in your possession isn't eligible for dispute.\n\nI wanted a refund then buy tickets through the official store instead.\n\nKlook says that the ticket is only valid on the day you book, however they're actually valid for a period of around 3 months on any day with the same price class. It even says so on one of their blog posts which is quite confusing and maddening.",

You can't print tickets you have to meet a third party and they don't show up till an hour after the park opens. We went to Sunshine City it is a cool shopping area and got our Disney ticket there.

If you also have time whilst around the Osaka area I would also recommended going to Kobe and Nara they are really short train ride from Osaka and have so much to offer on there own. Also I recommend USJ on a weekday maybe Tuesday/Wednesday as the weekends are just incredibly busy. Also whilst close to Shinsekai there is an awesome bar called Music groovy bar where many travellers gather.",

I\u2019ve read mixed things about Nara largely due to the deer and nothing else really being around but that could be wrong.\n\nSame for Kobe, more so that just visiting for the beef isn\u2019t a great idea as it can be had all over but at least from what I read Kobe seemed like a more interesting place to visit.\n\nRe USJ, that\u2019s exactly yet plan from looking at the attendance charts so great to receive confirmation.\n\nI\u2019ll make a note re the bar as I don\u2019t have too many night places down currently, thanks for that",

You\u2019d be much better off doing Kyoto first otherwise you\u2019re going back on yourself twice.\n\nYou could easily do Shibuya and Shinjuku on the same day, especially with what you\u2019re planning to do. That would give you an extra day to fit something else in.\nThe national science museum in Odiaba (Miraikan) isn\u2019t that good, I\u2019d skip it and do something else.\nUeno Zoo is highly worth visiting, you\u2019ll spend the best part of a day there. Get there early to avoid the queues to see the pandas.\n\nFor Kyoto, the monkey park is in Arashiyama, do that when you go there, it\u2019s almost on the opposite side of the city to Fushimi.\nAbsolutely do not miss Kinkakuji, Ginkakuji and Kiyomizudera. You\u2019ll regret not going to them.",

I was waiting until the weekend to go over it again but thanks a bunch for pointing out that I did stuff that up. - I\u2019ve switched it around on the post now\n\nAhh that\u2019s disappointing on miraikan as it looks good online. I\u2019ll have to do some more research here it appears.\n\nI\u2019ve heard bad things about the zoo mainly with enclosures being so small and depressing but I have to admit I can\u2019t remember if that was in regards to the zoo you\u2019re mentioning and/or an aquarium park\n\nThanks for the Kyoto ideas, I\u2019ve double checked and the only one that I already have on my list to visit is Kiyomizudera which I must\u2019ve missed. I\u2019m not really interested in visiting the other two based upon my past research but thanks anyway more ideas are always welcome",

                            "comment": "Miraikan was probably the only disappointment for me unfortunately, it\u2019s largely pretty empty for it\u2019s size and is mostly aimed at children. There\u2019s a few bits that are genuinely interesting but for the most part it\u2019s just not very engaging and is lacking in any unique displays.\n\nUeno is fine, there\u2019s maybe one or two enclosures that are a bit small but to condemn the whole place because of that is unfair. Most of the bad reviews sound like people without expertise overreacting. They\u2019re currently there to do research and conservation work so it\u2019s not like the animals are needlessly there. It\u2019s pretty similar to London zoo although much bigger.\nThe aquarium parks look awful however, a conservationists nightmare, didn\u2019t even think once about going to them.\n\nKinkakuji and Ginkakuji are seriously worth the time, they don\u2019t take long to go around and are both quite spectacular to look at, Ginkakuji has a particularly beautiful garden around it, I would go as far as saying the best garden I saw.\n\nOn your way to Hiroshima don\u2019t miss Himeji castle, it\u2019s very, very easy to get to. Hop off the Shinkansen, put your luggage in the station lockers and walk down Himeji\u2019s high street to the castle (you can see it from the train station). I\u2019m very fond of Osaka castle but it\u2019s a museum with a castle facade. Himeji is the real deal. I\u2019ve visited dozens of castles around the world and Himeji is one of the absolute best. There\u2019s tour guides doing free tours in Japanese and English, it\u2019s worth joining them because Himeji is very faithfully preserved in that there aren\u2019t any information signs in the main castle to break the immersion. Info is available online but going with the guide felt much more personal.",

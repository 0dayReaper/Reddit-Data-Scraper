I think most bookings on there are fully refundable up to a few days before check in.\n\nReach out to them or the hotel itself and ask them. Shouldn't be very difficult, assuming the room is available.",

            "comment": "Your Akihabara day and Shibuya days are a little light.  But the issue is that Akihabara on a friday and Shibuya on a saturday is going to be rough. Probably the busiest days for those 2 towns. Shibuya will be insane and you won't be able to find anything to eat and it'll be slammed the entire day. \n\nAKIHABARA\n\n- Kanda Myojin Shrine (1 hour)\n\n- Animate (barely 1 hour, maybe 30 minutes. The animate when I was there in April was gutted and half the floors were bare)\n&gt;\n\n- Big Camera (30 minutes)\n&gt;\n\n- Akihabara Radio Kaikan (1 hour) but going on a friday it's going to be busy. \n\n\n- Donki (1 hour)\n\nPlan some food breaks in between. Try to go to some places outside of the main strip because all those food places will be slammed.  We had to travel back to Asakusa to eat food. There are some places on the other side of the highway that is less busy at night for dinner. \n\n&gt; june 17\n&gt;\n \n&gt; SHINJUKU\n\n Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nMeiji Jingu\n\n SHIBUYA\n \n Hachiko Statue (10 minutes for pictures)\n\nShibuya Crossing Scramble (this is going to be a mess)\n\nShibuya Mega Donki (1 hour)\n\nI would add stuff like walking around harajuku but skip Takeshita street or at least walk through it to say you were there but it's shoulder to shoulder on saturday.  You could add hedghog cafe or otter cafe or something else to fill up this day and then dinner outside of this area. you're looking at 1-2 hour wait for dinner on a saturday.",

I home based in Asakusa so i cannot say if it's better on saturday but I do know Shibuya on a weekend sucked. \n\nShibuya is going to be popular for residents and tourist.",

It\u2019s actually inside Universal Studio and you need an area timed entry to that area after you enter the park. If you didn\u2019t already get express pass that includes Times Entry, it\u2019s best you show up to Universal early around 7am, when the park opens you will run to that area because it doesn\u2019t need timed entry early in the day. If not, you go to the park later and either gets assigned a timed entry later in the day or it converts into a lottery system where you May or may not get a chance to enter that area.",

Was that your personal experience?\nI got there at around 7:45am, seeing as the park opens at 9am I thought it\u2019d be early enough\u2026 but it was already open and the rides were also going. I probably got into the park around 8:15 after all the lines and got a free timed entry ticket for 4pm through the app which was the last available slot for the day. I recommend this approach as the payed entry pass costs around the same as an extra USJ ticket",

As we were early and the park was not full we could enter without timed entry and the queue for the attractions were much shorter (30 mins for Mario kart).",

I see reports of failed payment outside of Japan but seems to work if you use apply pay. The alternative is getting through klook but the downside is that you can\u2019t choose the time when you entered the area and won\u2019t know what time you get until you make the purchase. Klook also tends to assign area entry time late in the day so not ideal if you are set to get into Nintendo earlier in the day. Lastly, you can get to USJ really early (maybe before 7am) and wait until the park opens and run to that area before they start requiring area timed entry to get in.",

            "comment": "Some tips for you. We spent 3 weeks in Japan and got back a little over a week ago. Went to some of the same locations except for Nagoya.\n\nHighly recommend posting your bags through Ta-q-bin. As it takes about 24hours for each location, we used a backpack for some locations and had our larger luggage posted to our next location instead. \n\nE.g we went from Tokyo, to Hakone for 2 nights, to Kyoto. So we sent the luggage from Tokyo to Kyoto. \nIf you don\u2019t do this, you probably will need to book a ticket for journey for your luggage on the Shinkansen.\n\nWe also only used the visit Japan web instead of the app and it worked really well. We are from the UK.\n\n\n\nVisiting Asakusa and Nakamise street and the surrounding markets was one of my favourite things to do in Tokyo. Similarly really enjoyed walking round Tsukiji Fish Market and browsing. I think those might be a good fit for your itinerary. \n\nI would consider booking some restaurants in advance for peace of mind. \n\nWe took sleeping tablets on the plane which helped with jet lag. \n\nDay 6 - I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need a whole day at Arashiyama. I feel like you could pair it with Kinkaku-ji or Fushimi Inari. \n\nDay 10/11 - I would swap the itineraries for these days unless you are arriving in Osaka very very early. You\u2019ll want to get to the universal park early to make the most of the day, much like Disney. You will also want to buy tickets in advance for here (not sure if you\u2019ve booked this too or just Disney?)\n\nDay 13: I found the Odaiba area a bit underwhelming. We visited there after doing Tsukiji fish market and TeamLab Planets. These paired well with the area and lots of people we spoke with did the same. You will need to book TLP in advance if you\u2019re interested. I found it OK.",

As Mario Park seemed to be really close the the Universal one, we thought it was a good to do both the same day, is that a bad idea?\n\nDay 13 =&gt; Oh, ok, we will look forward this too. Can you explain me what is a TLP? It doesn't look like something I know.\n\nFrom the 3 weeks you spent there, what was your most memorable moments / things to not miss at any cost?",

And please correct me if I\u2019m wrong because I haven\u2019t been there haha. But if you\u2019re doing those, I\u2019d recommend doing that day the day after you arrive in Osaka - so you can get there early from your hotel. \n\nTLP = Team Lab Planets. Sorry for the abbreviation. It\u2019s an attraction which is held indoors and is essentially an interactive museum for you to take photos at. \n\n\nOur favourite part of the holiday was staying in Ryokans. We are big foodies so a lot of our key memories revolved around eating haha. I\u2019ll include some restaurant names below that we really enjoyed:\n\nYakiniku A Five Ginza - all you can eat meat on a grill. Really enjoyed the selection and quality here.\n\nKuuraku Ginza - Yakitori restaurant we loved, highly recommend the Omakase\n\nManten sushi Coredo - this is another place we chose an Omakase selection at (which means chef\u2019s choice so they\u2019ll choose all the dishes for you). It\u2019s a small chain but we sat at the bar and it was really personal.\n\nTeppan Tavern Tenamonya - book soon if you can for this in Kyoto. It\u2019s a really small bar owned by husband and wife, but the food is relatively affordable and absolutely delicious\n\nTsurugyu in Osaka - they sell fantastic Kobe beef here but at a discount price",

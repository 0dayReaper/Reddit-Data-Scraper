    "postText": "All I ever see on itineraries is \"Nara day trip\".\n\nI've personally found it to be an order of magnitude more amazing than Kyoto or Osaka. It's my favorite city in Japan. Far less tourists (and the ones who do come are completely concentrated in one area). There's eight world heritage, beautiful old shrines and temples, an ancient forest filled with friendly deer (who are happy to come up to you and be fed), some very detailed museums, archaeology sites, mysterious key-shaped tombs, delicious food, and warm hospitality. \n\nFor best results, spend at least a couple days in the city. I remember waking up at 2am for some reason, and randomly walking to the 5-story pagoda and just sitting therein the completely silent night, entranced by it until a random deer came to keep me company. \n\nKyoto has some really nice sites, to be sure. But getting between them is hell and the mobs of Chinese package tourists make them almost unvisitable. If you're dead set on Kyoto, try to visit before 6am or after 10pm.\n\nJust a random rant. Nara is so seriously underrated :(",

Now, don't get me wrong, Nara Park is amazing and easily worth of a day, but Nara as a whole has a lot more to see and you could easily justify a lot longer.  \n\n&gt;Kyoto has some really nice sites, to be sure. But getting between them is hell and the mobs of Chinese package tourists make them almost unvisitable. \n\nKyoto also has a fuck-ton of sites that nobody ever visits, so reading this reveals to me that you perhaps haven't spent enough time exploring it.  I used to live right next to Tofuku-ji and Sennyu-ji, for example, both of which are huge and both of which are practically deserted for most of the year.",

That said, it's gorgeous and the area around it (including the Philosopher's Path and smaller temples like Honnen-in) isn't generally very crowded (unless perhaps you're going at the height of fall foliage or cherry blossoms).\n\n&gt;My only regret was that we traveled in July\n\nThe weather in July certainly isn't the most pleasant, but as a trade-off there are a ton of festivals in Kansai at that time.  Gion and Tenjin are the obvious ones, but there are some other standouts like the Mitarashi Festival at Shimogamo and Motomiya Festival at Fushimi Inari.",

The surge in domestic tourism in particular is very noticeable in the second half of the month, and sights like Tofuku-ji, Eikan-do, and Shoren-in go from next to no visitors to massive crowds.\n\nNumerous attractions in Kyoto have special night openings/illuminations throughout November that are worth checking out. Some that come to mind off the top of my head include Kodai-ji, Kiyomizu-dera, Shoren-in, Eikan-do, and Kitanotenman-gu.\n\n&gt;November. I'm doing 5 days In Tokyo and then staying 5 days in Nara and using it as a hub. We plan to go do Nature-y stuff in Wakayama, and want to see Osaka and Kyoto as well.\n\nFor a first visit I wouldn't really recommend staying in Nara.  If you're doing day trips to Osaka and Kyoto, staying in Nara would really just mean that you'd be adding at least 2 hours of transit to every day you're not in Nara itself.  I say \"at least\" because depending on what you're seeing and where you're staying in in Nara, it could be quite a bit longer than that.  Keep in mind that a lot of the things you'll want to see will not be near Kyoto/Osaka/Namba Stations--especially in the case of Kyoto, where Kyoto Station is located on the south side of the city and a majority of the sights are located around the perimeter.  There's also not much of anything going on in Nara at night, which might not be the end of the world if you're planning to get up at 5:00 AM every day, but it certainly limits your options.\n\nIn short, if this were a second trip to Japan and you knew you just wanted to focus on things in Nara (e.g., Sakurai, Mt. Yoshino, etc.), then basing yourself in Nara could be a lovely idea.  For a first visit that includes day trips to Kyoto and Osaka?  Not so much.",

We visited all the \"unknown\" temples/shrines in Kyoto when we were headed on our way towards a popular temple/shrine.\n\nSuddenly a very nice, old lady popped up and was very happy when she realized that we had walked all the way just to visit this almost 'forgotten temple'.  She explained us a lot about the temple even though we didn't understand Japanese but it was fun. She even let us go inside (it was closed) and explained its history.\n\nJapan is amazing.",

Spending half to a quarter of their trip in one city is hard for people to justify when its not Tokyo or Kyoto.\n\nYou'll also know from going to this sub that 80% of people do essentially zero planning for their trip. They book a flight, look at one or two sites that have things to do and then freak out a week ahead of time and ask the same question thats been asked 30 times that week. \n\nYou're also missing the fact that many people here are Americans, and for some reason we have the need to do \"everything\" on a trip. This typically means when we go to Europe for example, rather than staying in one country, we go to 4-5 and spend half our time simply travelling than saying \"lets go to Germany\" and spend most of our time on a train or a plane then seeing the actual places.",

Or how in conversation they'll laugh about the times they snuck into national attractions without paying the entrance fees. Or how they'll get so drunk on the nightlife that they'll literally piss and puke in the public streets.

                    "comment": "If you actually walk (or bike) around Kyoto and don't just go to the most popular sights, there are a ton of places that are basically deserted.  \n\nKinkaku-ji, Tenryu-ji (and the area right around it, including the most famous bamboo path in Arashiyama), Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizu-dera (and the area in front of it, including Sannen-zaka and Ninen-zaka), and Hanamikoji in Gion are where 95% of the tourists congregate.  You could also probably throw Ginkaku-ji in there, but it's not generally as bad, and the area around it doesn't usually get too crowded outside of fall foliage or cherry blossom season.  Walk or bike even slightly away from those areas and the crowds rapidly thin.  Even really big, famous places like Nanzen-ji, Kitanotenman-gu, Heian-jingu, Nijo Castle, The Imperial Palace, and Shimogamo Shrine don't get a fraction of the tourists that the aforementioned ones do. I also highly recommend going to places at unusual hours.  Fushimi Inari and southern Higashiyama, for example are absolutely gorgeous at night and have much lower crowds.\n\nExamples of incredible places that are generally deserted (except for when they get seasonal influxes of domestic tourists):  Bishamon-do, Tofuku-ji, Sennyu-ji, Ninna-ji, Kamigamo-Jinja, Konkai-Komyo-ji, Daigo-ji, the smaller/sub temples around Nanzen-ji, Daitoku-ji (and its sub-temples), Myoshin-ji (and its sub-temples), Daikaku-ji, Yoshida-jinja, Honnen-in.\n\nExamples of places that are not generally deserted, but have much lower crowds (many of these are within walking distance of the most famous sights): The entire northern half of the Saga-Arashiyama area (including Sagatoriimoto), Eikan-do, Chion-in, Shoren-in, Kennin-ji, most of the town of Ohara, Kurama/Kibune, Takao, Mt. Hiei (including Enryaku-ji).  \n\nAnd there are plenty I'm missing, but you get the idea.",

Yes, there are lots of package tourists, but as you all say, 95% of the city is free of them and still wonderful!\n\nAnyway, Nara. Yeah, Nara is nice. A lot of domestic Japanese tourists have apparently switched from visiting Kyoto to Nara, and I'm sure they know what they're doing.\n\nNara Prefecture is like an exploding-brain meme in Japan form. Start with the unlit brain representing the Nara Park day trip, then progress to Naramachi, Yoshino, Asuka-Takatori, Dorogawa-Omine, Totsukawa, and then end with the ascended brain of anyone who attempts to travel to those bits of southeastern Nara that lowly wanderers like me can't even remember the name of.",

They have paddocks they go to at night and actual food is supplied for them. They\u2019re like petting zoo animals, though, and they like the crackers, so will prefer to eat them. I haven\u2019t heard of obesity issues\u2014it\u2019s always pretty obvious when it\u2019s been a busy day and they don\u2019t want to eat anymore, but the problem I know of that\u2019s killing them is the plastic. \n\nBecause the deer are so aggressive, they grab anything out of people\u2019s hands, thinking it\u2019s food, when it\u2019s often bags or wrappers. People, especially children, also just panic and throw the crackers, plastic wrappers included, when the deer start swarming them. Which results in them consuming literal kilograms of plastic over their (shortened) lifespans.",

    "postText": "We have been wargaming our itinerary for Japan and are trying to figure out how we get from Kusatsu to Tokyo on a Sunday. Google Maps tells us that we can't leave before 9.20, which gets us in too late for an event we have booked early in the Sunday afternoon. However we found this timetable on JR Bus Kanto that we *think* has a few services before then: http://www.jrbuskanto.co.jp.e.wn.hp.transer.com/bus_etc/cntimep01.cfm?pa=1&amp;pb=1&amp;pc=j0450121&amp;pd=0&amp;st=1\n\nWe've also fed the PDF timetable from that page into Google translate, but given the differences with Google maps, we're not convinced that it's up to date or we're understanding it correctly. \n\nI also asked our Ryokan in Kusatsu and they came back with the same schedule that I found on google maps.\n\nIs anyone able to confirm the services out of Kusatsu early on a Sunday morning like the JR Kanto page suggests? Or do we go with google?\n\nIf we can't get back to Tokyo before midday on Sunday, we'll have to look at another Onsen town closer to Tokyo. Does anyone have any suggestions for somewhere similar to Kusatsu in cuteness/historic value? I'm preferably looking for somewhere thst would have a private onsen also.",

            "comment": "Yes, the timetable you mentioned is correct. I looked up the route using the Japanese transit planner Norikae Annai and it suggested taking the JR Bus Kanto. However, I noticed that both Google Maps and the English version of Norikae Annai don't show the route with the JR Bus Kanto. It's really weird...\n\nHere are three schedules that will get you to Tokyo before noon on Sundays:\n\nKusatu Onsen 6:20/6:50 -&gt; Naganohara-Kusatsuguchi 6:45/7:15 by JR Bus Kanto  \nNaganohara-Kusatsuguti 7:05/7:38-&gt; Takasaki 8:31/9:10 by JR Agatsuma line  \nTakasaki 8:39/9:37-&gt; Tokyo 9:40/10:28 by Shinkansen Toki\n\nKusatu Onsen 8:10 -&gt; Naganohara-Kusatsuguchi 8:38 by JR Bus Kanto  \nNaganohara-Kusatsuguti 8:53-&gt; Shin-Maebashi 10:06 by JR Agatsuma line  \nShin-Maebashi 10:10-&gt;Takasaki 10:20 by JR Agatsuma line  \nTakasaki 10:39-&gt; Tokyo 11:28 By Shinkansen Toki",

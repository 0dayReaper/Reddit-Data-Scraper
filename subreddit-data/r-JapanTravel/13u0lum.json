    "postText": "How much earlier before closing do you generally need to arrive to be seated? Is there an unspoken rule?\n\n\nWe arrived at a Yuba (tofu skin) kaiseki restaurant in the main tourist area in Kyoto (Gion) and were told that the restaurant was full and that we would have to wait.\n\nWe arrived 1 hour 30min before closing (8:30PM, they close at 10pm) on a Sunday night. \n\nThe greeter said there were 5-6 parties waiting for their last course, and handed us a menu and said that we would only be able to order the 7-course option due to time. He said we would have to wait, but couldn\u2019t give us an estimate because he couldn\u2019t tell and they don\u2019t rush their guests (good!).\n\nOne of us thinks that the greeter was rejecting us and was communicating that we could not be seated/served that night. That it\u2019s clearly a case of needing to read between the lines, as we\u2019ve been told about Japanese folks\u2019 indirect way of communicating rejection.\n\nOne of us thinks there was still a possibility to be seated, given that the greeter handed us a menu. \n\n\nI know it\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but whose inference is more likely to be accurate? Are there any cultural nuances going on here? \n\n\n(We decided to leave and find somewhere else to eat as we were hungry)",

This information is often signposted somewhere or written inside the menus.\n\nIn your case, the greeter probably didn\u2019t want to fully turn you away, but probably also couldn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019d be seated in time. The \u2018unspoken\u2019 hint was probably just that it was up to you whether to take the risk of waiting or not. A restaurant that can not take more customers will say so very clearly, even quite bluntly and with crossed arms/fingers to make sure the point is clear.",

If somebody\u2019s hungry and wants to eat and they know that it\u2019s gonna be a long wait they might quite understandably go somewhere else. like others said, if they gave you a menu and didn\u2019t turn you away then I imagine you would have been able to eat  \u2026.eventually. \n\nThere are some euphemistic ways to say no and such in Japan, but a restaurant is usually going to be quite frank (which they were)",

Asked it I could return and in how long and the answer was pretty much \"I don't know how long customer will take\". Then they said maybe in 40 minutes, then ok, please reserve me a place in 40 minutes and it was fine.\n\nSo it it absolutely possible that they where just telling you that the place is full and they don't know how long it will take to people to finish. And considering they know it usually takes more or less how much time for their course meal, then they told you what is the biggest course they could likely accommodate. I would say there is no universal rule, usually you would have to order before last order.",

I\u2019ve travelled to other cities to go to mom and pop shops that shut down 2 hours early with no signage indicating why.\n\nEven the big cities in Japan largely shut down early. The metro system shuts down early. So I would assume that it wasn\u2019t really possible to have a 7 course meal with no reservation at 9:15 PM.. that\u2019s what the \u201cI don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ll have to wait\u201d means.",

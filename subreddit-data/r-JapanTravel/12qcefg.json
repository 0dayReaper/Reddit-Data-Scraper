Not sure how to format things with reddit so I'll just reply w/ bullets:\n\n* Owl Cafe Fukurou\n   * Obligatory notice that if you are a patron of owl cafe - you are participating in animal abuse. There are no humane owl cafes in Japan (or anywhere else in the world).\n      * Thank you for the heads up! We saw info online that the couple running this cafe was taking care of the owls but I appreciate your insight. Will cancel this reservation and hopefully get our money back.\n* Day 7\n   * This is undoable itinerary, regardless of whether you rent a bike. If you are taking a Sagano Romantic Train, the most you could do during the day is Bamboo Grove, Tenryu-ji, Iwatayama, Gio-ji and maybe one other temple. \\*\n      * I see! We're going to cut out the Bamboo Grove (heard it was overcrowded and there are other places to see bamboo groves) and Tenryu-ji (would like to prioritize the smaller temples from pictures) for sure then. Between Sagano Romantic Train and the remaining temples, which would you recommend?\n* Shinkansen to Hakone\n   * Obligatory notice that you have to take JR Nara line or Kintetsu to Nara, shinkansen to Odawara, and then work your way up Hakone Tozan to your accommodation.\n   * Also note that if your accommodation is around Gora rather than Hakone-Yumoto - you probably need to leave Nara around noon to make your dinner.\n      * Our accommodation is near Sengokuhara and we're planning to get to Nara early in the morning then leave around noon. I know it's a little bit over a 4 hour trip so it's not a huge deal if we don't make it to dinner. We have the next night as well!\n\n(Edited for formatting)",

I visited one on the weekend and it was way too busy. \n\nHakone is honestly amazing. I would even recommend two nights there. It might be nice to wind down. Would definitely recommend the Open Air Museum too!",

I dunno where is your hotel, but I would rather do something chill further away from the crowds, like the riverside or just slowly exploring on the way to your tea ceremony.\n\n2. I hope the 5+ temples a day are for pointers only, because that is not really doable in an enjoyable manner. Take your time and enjoy, try some small random ones in Higashiyama.\n\n3. I would do Gion and together Yasaka at night, especially cool after rain. Short walk to Pontocho and some lovely streams in Gion. Just take your time.\n\n4. Osaka castle is way more impressive than Odawara castle if you can pick one",

Was on the fence about Gion with all the temples but since we\u2019re cutting down how many temples we\u2019re hitting, this will definitely be an area we explore. \n\n4. We weren\u2019t able to fit Osaka castle in while we\u2019re in the area and we just wanted to see a castle regardless of which one. Odawara just happens to fit in well with our Hakone time :)",

    "postText": "Hello fellow travelers!\n\nI'm planning a first-time solo trip to Japan from **June 14 to July 5** and have the basic framework laid out. However, I'm seeking input to add depth and 'off-the-beaten-path' experiences to my journey. Since it's rainy season, I'm planning on just having days set up and moving them around based on the weather. Here's what I have so far:\n\n# Tokyo\n\n**\ud83d\udcc5 Day 1**\n\n* Arriving from NYC\n* check in to the hotel, start to deal with jet lag\n\n**\ud83d\udcc5 Day 2-5**\n\nMuseum Day\n\n* 21\\_21 Design Sight\n* National Art Center\n\nTsukiji / Asakusa Day\n\n* Tsukiji market in the morning (food) or stick to the imperial palace\n* head to hamarikyu gardens (garden + teahouse)\n* take the water bus to asakusa (cheap and interesting view up the river)\n* sensoji and nakamise shopping street\n*  walk towards akihabara, via kappabashi st (cutlery shopping) and ameyoko street (all sorts of shopping)\n* akihabara \n* head down towards kanda for izakayas (food+ drinks)\n\nShibuya Day\n\n* start with Meiji shrine in the morning, then walk downwards towards Shibuya\n* Meiji shrine\n* Omotesando + harajuku/takeshita street + togo shrine\n* Shibuya sky (sunset views)\n* Shibuya parco (capcom, pokemon, nintendo, piece stores etc)\n* Shibuya crossing, Hachiko statue etc\n\nVintage Shopping &amp; Nail Day \n\n# Kyoto\n\n**\ud83d\udcc5 Day 5-10**\n\n* Philosophers Path\n* Uji: Visit the world's oldest tea shop and Boyodo-in Temple\n* Arashiyama: Visit Sushi Naritaya. (Note: Bamboo grove and monkey park optional)\n* Kibune and Kurama: Half-day hike from Kibune to Kurama, relax in the Kurama onsen.\n\n# Osaka\n\n**\ud83d\udcc5 Day 10-12**\n\n* Universal studios \n* Food! \n\n# Hiroshima\n\n**\ud83d\udcc5 Day 12-14**\n\n* Visit the Peace Park and Museum, Shukkei-en traditional Japanese garden, or Hiroshima Castle.\n* Take a ferry to the sacred island of Miyajima to see the famous floating Torii gate\n\nMy itinerary covers iconic cities, but I want to venture into the less-traveled paths. Note I have to return to Tokyo to leave. \n\nSince I'm going during rainy season, does it make sense to go to Okinawa? Sapporo? Should I do the Hokuriku Arch Pass? I also haven't planned traditional ryokan experiences, but I want to find something not in Hakone. Open to all suggestions.",

            "comment": "Kyoto is incredibly light. You have 5-6 days there and only 2.5 days are planned:\n\n* 1 day Uji\n\n* 1 day Kurama and Kibune \n\n* 1 hour philosophers path \n\n* Eating a meal in Arashiyama \n\nOff the beaten path is a really misused word for Kyoto (half the articles in English advertising this discuss stuff that is not off the beaten path at all), but I will attempt to make a few suggestions:\n\n* Day trip to the western part of shiga. I would do ishiyamadera + one other shrine/temple along the Keihan Otsu line (you can get a day pass for this at Yamashina station)\n\n* Day trip to Ohara\n\n* Stay overnight in Nara city or Sakurai city. One day Nara Park and surroundings, one day the temples/shrines around Sakurai (if you go on a weekday, these are very peaceful). The Kintetsu two day pass can be a good deal since it includes all the sakurai buses \n\n&gt; Hiroshima castle\n\nIs a reconstruction. If you want to see a Japanese castle, stop by Himeji for a few hours on the way to Hiroshima and see an original construction.",

            "comment": "First of all, I think it is very sensible and well thought itinerary. Hokuriku Arch Pass (but I if you are already getting the Nationwide JR Rail Pass, which makes sense given your itinerary, you do not need Hokuriku Pass on top of that) covers the Shinkasen to Kanazawa (among many other stops along the route) which is one of my favorite mid-size cities in Japan with a good range of art and cultural sites. But since you already cover many urban sights, I think Okinawa - especially the smaller islands Kerama islands or Iriomote - may also be a wonderful option to experience a different side of Japan. The good think is that the rainy season in Okinawa has already started and usually ends in the second half of June (as indicated here: [Japan weather forecast site](https://tenki.jp/rainy-season/)). The smaller Okinawan islands offer many nature experiences, some wonderful swimming and snorkeling beaches, kayaking opportunities if you are into those kind of activities. The culture down there is also noticeably different than the mainland.",

We ended up doing the ropeway up Mt Hiei, hike through the temples at the top and exit down the ropeway to Shiga, it was pretty good! We just ran out of time for the other hike.\n\nIf you want something similar we *really* enjoyed the hike in Okutama from Kori station to Okutama station, ending at a really awesome brew pub (https://belleelene.com/2022/04/29/okutama-kori/)\n\nSome other longer hikes you may enjoy are things like the nakasendo trail between Magome and Tsumago (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6078.html)",

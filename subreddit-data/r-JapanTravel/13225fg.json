    "postText": "My wife and I are leaving for Japan in eight days, and I\u2019m so excited to finally be submitting my itinerary check.  We\u2019ll be there for two weeks, flying into Tokyo and out of Osaka, and our goal is to experience the following three \u201ctourism food groups\u201d:\n\n1: City\n\n2: Inaka\n\n3: Nature\n\nWe\u2019re trying to go for a mix of Japan\u2019s \u201cgreatest hits\u201d while also making room for some lesser-known/off-the-beaten-path spots.  Any and all recommendations beyond our itinerary are encouraged.  If it seems like there isn\u2019t enough sake on our list, it\u2019s because my wife and I don\u2019t drink.  We plan on using this itinerary as more of a \u201cbuffet\u201d to pick and choose from than a schedule to rigidly adhere to, so if it seems like there\u2019s too much packed into each day, that\u2019s why.\n\n**Day 1: Arrive in Tokyo**\n\n- Chores: eSIM, currency, transit\n- Shibuya Crossing\n- Shibuya 109/Hachiko statue\n- Harajuku\n\nEat: Ichiran Ramen (chain), Kaiten Sushi (chain)\n\n**Day 2: Explore Tokyo / Ghibli Museum**\n\nMORNING: SHINJUKU\n\n- Metro Govt. Building view\n- Shinjuku Goyen Natl. Garden\n- Suga Jinga \u201cYour Name\u201d Staircase (because we\u2019re nerds)\n- Omoide Yokoch\u014d Alley\n- Shinjuku Golden Gai\n- Takashimaya Dept. Store\n\nAFTERNOON: GHIBLI MUSEUM\n\n- Tickets @ 4:00 PM\n- Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum nearby.  Possibly stop by before Ghibli?\n\n\nEVENING\n\n- Obake Staircase (\u201c49 steps up 39 steps down\u201d)\n- Asakusa @ sunset\n\nFood: Metro Gov. Bldg. 32nd Floor Staff Cafeteria, Harukor Ainu Restaurant\n\nDessert: Nakano Broadway ice cream, Ikebukuro Station Dessert Basement (if we feel like going out of our way), Bake cheese tarts (Shinjuku), Takashimaya Dept. Store Food Court\n\n**Day 3: Final day in Tokyo**\n\nMORNING\n\n- Chiyoda City\n- Intermediatheque (we like offbeat stuff like this)\n- Magokoro Tenyo statue\n- Walk by Sukiyabashi Jiro\n- Shitamachi Museum\n\nLUNCH @ ~~KOZASASUSHI.  Very excited about this one.~~ All booked up.  We're trying to find a nice $60-100ish/seat omakase sushi place, if you have a recommendation\n\nAFTERNOON: AKIHABARA\n\n- Arcade games\n- Creepy Vending Machine Corner\n\nFood: Ginza Kagari, Ekibenya Matsuri Gransta Boxed Lunches, Ramen Street\n\n**DAY 4: Travel to Nikko**\n\nAt this point, we switch gears from over-stimulated city life to quiet relaxed countryside.  We plan on renting bikes and biking around Nikko.  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/agb5c9/sights_and_time_in_nikko/) and [this map](http://nikko-travel.jp/assets/files/english/nikko_historical_walking_map.pdf) should give us plenty to go off of, but there\u2019s an equally high chance that we\u2019ll simply want to bike around and ignore any and all itinerary.\n\n**Day 5: Nikko National Park**\n\nWe\u2019ll take the bus around the park and use [this guide](http://nikko-travel.jp/assets/files/english/oku-nikko_hiking_map.pdf) to decide if and where we want to stop and walk around.\n\n**Day 6: Travel to Akita/Tae no yu Onsen**\n\nWe\u2019re staying at the Tae no yu onsen, so we\u2019ll spend the first half of the day relaxing on the train and the second half of it relaxing at the onsen.\n\n**Day 7: Onsen**\n\nFull day at the onsen.  Relax, bathe, walk around a bit.\n\n**Day 8: Big travel day.  Akita &gt; Nagoya &gt; Takayama**\n\nWe\u2019re renting a car in Nagoya and driving up to Takayama.  I\u2019m very excited to have the freedom of a car for a bit, able to stop wherever we want.  I plan on driving [this loop](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Nagoya,+Aichi,+Japan/Gero,+Gifu,+Japan/Takayama,+Gifu,+Japan/Shirakawa-go,+Ogimachi,+Shirakawa,+Gifu,+Japan/Nagoya,+Aichi,+Japan/@35.7219509,136.4022251,8.99z/data=!4m32!4m31!1m5!1m1!1s0x6003709e107b2365:0x2a9622d4e8ceb352!2m2!1d136.9065571!2d35.1814506!1m5!1m1!1s0x6002da5b928f1c39:0x2076f5b712e95e07!2m2!1d137.2441224!2d35.8059163!1m5!1m1!1s0x6002a342a14fc349:0xd4f2fb84f0b8e3dc!2m2!1d137.252159!2d36.1461317!1m5!1m1!1s0x5ff871b0b6bf25e7:0xccc551bb9d5805f8!2m2!1d136.9061975!2d36.2577967!1m5!1m1!1s0x6003709e107b2365:0x2a9622d4e8ceb352!2m2!1d136.9065571!2d35.1814506!3e0).  We\u2019d like to stop in a random town or two along the way either there or back and just walk around a bit.\n\n**Day 9: Takayama**\n\nI\u2019m a carpenter by trade, woodworker by hobby, so finding out that Japan has a historic lumber/woodworking town made us completely revamp our original itinerary in order to accommodate it (sorry, Hokkaido, we\u2019ll see you next time).\n\n- Tour @ 10:00 AM\n- Hida Folk Village\n- Forest of the Seven Lucky Gods (next to Hida)\n\nFood: Hida beef\n\n**Day 10: Drive back to Nagoya, train to Kyoto**\n\nPossibly spend some time in Shirakawa on our way back to Nagoya, depending on how sick I am of historic architecture (never gonna happen).  We\u2019ll be getting into Kyoto in the afternoon/evening, so we\u2019ll have some time to wander around:\n\n- Teramachi shopping arcade\n- Nishiki Market street\n\nFood: Nagahama Ramen, Shijo Kawaramachi\n\n\n**Day 11: Kyoto**\n\n- Bike tour 10AM - 3:30PM.  We booked a [bicycle tour](https://www.viator.com/tours/Kyoto/Epic-Bike-Tour-of-Kyoto/d332-150739P1?m=61408&amp;nid=VR.f42b4ac6-25ca-453f-a1a0-5f452ee8900a.VT_EMAIL_TRV) to cover many of the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of Kyoto.  I\u2019m not sure what exactly will be covered by this tour, so some of the next day\u2019s items may become redundant.\n- Gion district\n- Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d 1,001 carved Buddha statues\n- Gion Corner is something we're on the fence about.  On the one hand, it could be interesting.  On the other hand, it could be boring.\n\nFood possibilities: Sennari, Tonkichi, Monk Pizza (friend-of-a-friend recommendation), Katsukatsu Tonton, Soba-dokoro Shizuya\n\n**Day 12: Kyoto**\n- Arishiyama Monkey Park\n- Arishiyama Bamboo Forest (I\u2019ve read mixed things about both these places, but the general consensus seems to be that they\u2019re best experienced in the early morning before the crowds)\n- Sagano Romantic Train\n\nFood: whatever we didn\u2019t get to the day before\n\n**Day 13: Kyoto &gt; Nara &gt; Osaka**\n- Stop at Tsuen Tea in Uji on the way\n- Temples/wandering in Nara\n- Evening in Osaka, Dotonbori\n\nOsaka food: Okonomiyaki Kiji, takoyaki (octopus balls), Aozora Blue (udon), Harukoma Honten (sushi)\n\n**Day 14: Morning in Osaka, Flight @ 5:00 PM**\n- Osaka Castle\n- Beg to stay for just one more day",

(Unless you aren't into window shopping at all) \n\nThe Shinjuku-Ghilibi-Asakusa sunset day is crazy. Not sure how you can fit a 4pm museum appointment AND a 1.5 hour+ train ride back to the literal opposite of Tokyo to catch the sunset (which is like 6:30-7)\n\nThe Nara-Osaka day is impossible. How do you stop by Uji if you have to bring luggage along? I'm doing Uji in two weeks and I made it a day trip on its own (with Fushimi sake district).",

I won't be surprised if our Tokyo days are half as full.\n\nSunset is 8:30, so I think we'll have enough time to leave the Ghibli museum around 6:00 and make it to Asakusa by 8:30.\n\nGood point about carrying all our luggage around during Kyoto/Nara/Osaka, I hadn't really thought about that.  I'll consider it some more.",

In LA around August? Yeah 8:30pm is possible, and that's because we inflate with daylight saving hours. But you said you are leaving in 8 days, which means you are in Japan during May, Japan doesn't have daylight saving, and 8pm is just.... unheard of.",

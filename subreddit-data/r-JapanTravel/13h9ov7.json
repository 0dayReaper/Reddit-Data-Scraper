I would not try to live on less than 1000 yen per dinner, that would limit you more to fast-food-chains, or ramen only, or trying to get real lucky with the places you find.\ngoing below 500 yen is buying the cheapest food at the combini and using their microwave or hot water cooker if you want something warm...",

They say how great it was and the cost performance was good, the service was attentive etc then give 3.5/5. Lol. \n\nOne person gave 1/5 because he complained that the tomato in the salad wasn't peeled and he said he was paying a lot and didn't get his money worth (he bought the \u00a51,900 lunch lol)\n\nGoogle has 795 reviews and 4.8/5.

            "comment": "I spent 2 days in Osaka last weekend, on my first day I only ate twice and spent a little over \u00a52,200. One of those was a rice ball from a convenience store and the other was food from a grocery store. On the second day I spent a little over \u00a53,300 and had one real meal of pizza and another grocery store trip. \u00a52,500 per meal would be fine. The Shinsaibashi shopping street is very touristy and you could walk through it quickly. I highly recommend checking out Shinsekai to see the retro style of a market &amp; food street. There\u2019s arcades and shooting games and tons of restaurants. From there, it\u2019s a 30min walk north towards Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori, or you can hop on the train (: America Mura village was also interesting and had a lot of near vintage clothing shops, cafes and other streetwear. It\u2019s on the other side of Dotonbori across the bridge. I\u2019m sure you could pass it on your way: America Mura -&gt; Dotonbori -&gt; Shinsaibashi -&gt; Shinsekai or vice versa\n\nFor Kyoto, I spent all day at Arashiyama. Highly recommend going to the Okochi Sanso Garden and walking along the Katsura River from Kameyama Park to Togetsu Bridge. Skip the Kimono Forest, I didn\u2019t even bother. I don\u2019t think it will be possible for you to do fushimi inari on the same day unless you go at night.",

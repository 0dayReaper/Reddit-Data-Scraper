    "postText": "Hello. i posted an Itinerary check here and this is my new itinerary, based on some advice from there and would appreciate some feedback :)\n\nWhen planning my itinerary, I have to take into account the humidity and heat as I will be going August. I will also going with my 6 yo son. He is pretty good at handling walking and lots of shopping, but still don't want to overdo it for him. Also have to consider big crowds with him, lots of toilet stops, need for a snack every 30 mins lol. My budget is $4500 AUD MAX. So I'm hoping my itinerary isn't too ambitious considering my budget. \n\n**Day 1: Arrival**\n\n* Arrive HND airport and check into airport hotel\n\n**Day 2: Akihabara**\n\n* Pick up child suica card airport and checkout. Head to Akihabara hotel\n* Explore Akihabara + shopping. Some shops to checkout:\n   * Super Potato, Animate\n* Karaoke (*maybe at Big Echo? any recommedations on karaoke places with english songs?)* and dinner\n\n**Day 3: Shibuya + Harajuku**\n\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Hachiko Statue Memorial\n* Shibuya Sky\n* Shopping:\n   * Sailor Moon Store, Angelic Pretty, Laforet Complex, Loft101\n* Yoyogi Park &amp; Meiji Jingu\n* If up for it, dinner in Shinjuku (Omoide Yokocho?)\n\n**Day 4: Ikekuburo**\n\n* **Picnic at Ueno Park early morning. Exhange 7 day JR Pass at Ueno Station**\n* **Sunshine Plaza &amp; Sunshine Aquarium**\n* Shopping:\n   * Otome Road, Mandrake, Don Quijote\n\n**Day 5: Odaiba**\n\n* 9am Sensoji + Nakamise-Dori\n* Asakusa Pier. Catch 12pm HIMIKO Tokyo Cruise to Odaiba Seaside Park\n* DiverCity, get lunch\n   * *If enough time: Gundam Base, Hello Kitty Store and further shopping* , *Miraikan Musuem*\n* TeamLabs in late afternoon\n\nStruggled a lot with my Odaiba itinerary, as my son really wants to catch water bus, and that has only travels very limited times a day so can't get to Odaiba until mid day-afternoon.\n\n**Day 6: Free Day**\n\nOriginally had this day as Mount Takao hike but think the humidity will be too much so don't have anything planned yet for this day. Up for suggestions. If not, I'll use it as a rest day, maybe head to tokyo dome and go roller blading or head to ginzo\n\n**Day 7: Kyoto**\n\n* Check out Akihabara hotel and head to Kyoto early morning. Approx arrive 12pm.\n* Drop luggage off at ryokan\n* Maruyama Park &amp; Yasaka Shrine\n* Walk through Gion\n\n**Day 8: Kyoto**\n\n* Okamato Kimono Rental at Kiyomizu-dera (Yukata)\n* Kiyomizu-dera\n* Nineizaka \n* Nishiki Market and Pontocho Park\n* Return yukata\n* Head to dinner, perhaps in Ponotocho alley? \n\n**Day 9: Kyoto + Tokyo**\n\n* Kyoto Station and place luggage bag in coin locker\n* Catch train to Saga Torokko Station and catch Sagano Romantic Train \n* %100 Arabica Coffee\n* Monkey Park\n* Back to Kyoto station to pick up luggage. Depending on timing, head to Tokyo for additional shopping before heading to HND airport late to check into airport hotel\n\nOR\n\n* Fushimi Inari Shrine, hike \n\n**Day 10: Departure**\n\n[previos post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/13h8n81/itinerary_check_august_1424th_travelling_with_6/)",

No money for rides unless you want premiere pass (which tbh, with a six year old on a weekday isn\u2019t necessary!) food we did $150AUD/day for our family of three (but one is a 2 year old haha). But that includes a popcorn bucket and refills, beers, generous amounts of snacks. You could very easily do it for much less than that.",

In Kyoto itself you\u2019ll be taking the local subways and buses which aren\u2019t covered by the JR Pass. I\u2019d suggest just buying one-way tickets on the [official Smart EX app](https://smart-ex.jp/en/index.php) and using the same Suica IC cards in Kyoto on the buses/subways/local trains there.  Suica cards work in Kyoto too.",

If you want something chill, go stroll along the water, grab some bubbles or a kite to play in the parks, maybe stumble along a random festival/event, get elephant-shaped ice cream at Zonohana, etc. In the summer the fountains in front of Mark IS turn into an unofficial splash pad, and the shopping center is super kid friendly. \n\nYou could also check out something like Kidzania (Wednesdays they do English) or Kodomonokuni.",

            "comment": "Sorry to inform you but your itinerary is unrealistically packed on almost every day. I don't have time to go into the details now. But I will make some general comments.\n\n- When you arrive in Haneda usually after a long flight. You tend to be pretty tired to doing all the thing your are planning seems impossible. I would just stick to Shinjuku that day. Plenty of dinner places to choose from and Sensoji can be enjoyed at another point.\n\n- For the other days. Try to imagine that Tokyo is huge and travelling within the city takes up a lot of time. For this reason it is better to stick to 1 or 2 neighborhoods per day to visit and try to visit neighborhoods that are located adjacent of one another on the map. This requires time a planning that you may not have anymore though.\n\n- I see several days where you are planning to visit temples in late afternoon but most temples in Japan tend to close at 5. My experience is that temples are best enjoyed at the beginning of the day. Especially the popular ones tend to be less crowded.\n\n- On the day you visit a ryokan around fuji you want to visit a japanese village at the end of the day. Here i would also recommend to just chill back in the ryokan. Ryokan towns usually shut down around 5 pm because most visitors will head back to their ryokan for onsen and dinner.\n\n- The last few days also seem too busy. I dont understand all the hotel changes. Kyoto, Nara and Osaka are all within one hour reach of eachother so i would recommend to stay at one place. I guess you've already booked the places though so maybe you can not change this anymore.\n\n- The last day, like all other days, does seem to busy. You could do USJ but you could also just decide between osaka or nara and enjoy quality time in 1 place instead of rushing through 2.\n\nMany people who visit Japan for the first time tend to underestimate how big the cities are and how much walking they are doing each day. Especially Tokyo and Osaka are notorious for this, but I see the same mistakes being made in Kyoto as well. Kyoto's public transport system relies largely on buses which makes travel times relatively long. With that being said I wish you and your group a pleasant journey and hope you will make some sacrifices to make your itinerary more breathable.",

Maybe 90 mins if you spent a long time in each room.  You also need to purchase tickets in advance as there isn\u2019t much in the way of same day sales available it at all.",

When you get out of the area where you collected your suitcase on the left hand side there is a desk where you can purchase a ticket, then just down the elevator on the right and you wait for your bus. They stop basically in front of all major hotels. Never had a problem.",

This goes for things like restersunts to things the entrance for places like Shibuya Sky (you also probably want reservations). Having hour by hour breakdowns will almost certainly fall apart pretty quickly. Like to give you some context, the Nintendo store at the top of parco in Shibuya had a massive line to even get in.\n-\tyou can get from Haneda to Shinjuku pretty easily with normal trains.\n-\tyou won\u2019t be able to use Uber in small towns near Fuji. You may be able to find a cab to take you to the place you want to go (for a lot) but returning will be a challenge. If you are late for your dinner at the Ryokan you normally forgo it. \n-\ttransit in small towns in general is normally way more precarious and time sensitive. Stuff will close a lot earlier \n-\talso just a general comment, you have a lot of days that start at 9am and end at midnight after a full day of doing things - you and your group are going to be tired from all the travelling and Jet lag. You are spending some of these days on your feet for hours.\n-\tyou didn\u2019t really say how big your group is,  but if it\u2019s over two people getting seats to places in Golden Gai  is a challenge.",

Nothing in Japan opens until 11, so shrines are a perfect early day activity.\n\nI wouldn't plan to spend too much time in any given neighborhood.  Shinjuku, Akihabara, Shibuya, none are really worth spending a whole day in, imho.  I recommend bopping around for an hour or two, then moving onto another neighborhood.  Every train runs basically every 2 minutes, so no neighborhood is very far away. \n Harajuku is a train stop away from Shinjuku, and is a great place to spend an hour or so.",

            "comment": "Yeah, echoing everyone else's thoughts that the multiple nights of doing things until very late hours is unrealistic. You're going to be walking everywhere, starting the day early (and let's be honest, you're going to be jetlagged. I usually get up at 5-6am every day the entire trip having traveled from the east coast US) so I think you should reevaluate how much you're banking on these nighttime activities. Maybe put things there that are \"would be nice\" rather than stuff you're dead set on doing. Or maybe have one late night midway through the trip.\n\nIf the nightlife is super important, maybe slot in some time for you to go back to your hotel and take a nap or rest, or possibly don't plan on getting up so early to do things.\n\nAlso, are you leaving from Osaka or Tokyo? Did you not put the day you're leaving on here because of travel back to the airport?",

            "comment": "You\u2019d probably have to line up for an  hour (or more) to get into Gyukatsu Motomura, just fyi. The Pok\u00e9mon center is a walk in, but can be quite crowded which will eat up time. The Nintendo store will also give you a time card and ask you to return at that time (for me, it was an hour later) so you should get the time card first.\n\nFushimi Inari and Arashiyama in the same day is doable but probably not enjoyable since you\u2019ll be spending an hour in commute. Also, if you\u2019re going for well rated restaurants, don\u2019t expect to be able to get in immediately. I would suggest kodaiji near kiyomizu instead for bamboo. Speaking of Kiyomizu, if memory serves me correctly it takes 30 min to hike up to the temple from Gion, and you\u2019ll most likely get distracted by all the shops in Sanneizaka/ninneizaka.\n\nA bit too lazy to read the rest, but I would suggest sleeping early if you\u2019re waking up early. First time visitors who aren\u2019t used to walking will find japan very tiring, and being constantly sleep deprived  will hamper your experience of japan.",

Tokyo's 23 wards, especially the central area, are divided into east and west by the Imperial Palace, so it's a waste of time and quite tiring to travel between the eastern and western parts in one day. \n\nFor instance, in your itinerary, Ginza, Tsukiji, and Asakusa are on the eastern side (as are Ueno, Akihabara, and Tokyo Station), while Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Jingumae (as are Harajuku, and Ikebukuro) are on the western side. \n\nTherefore, it might be better to adjust your schedule to spend one day exploring the eastern side and another day on the western side. (It would be even better if you could stay in different locations on the days you explore the eastern and western sides!) \n\nPlease be aware, the 23 wards of Tokyo (which make up only 28.5% of the total area of Tokyo Met.) are **7.2 times larger than Manhattan.** \n\nBe sure to keep this in mind when planning your travels.\n\nHope this comment helps!",

Some spots require tickets for specific dates and times, or you may need to pick up a timed entry ticket. \n\nIt can be really disappointing and exhausting to have a plan but not be able to enter because you don't have a reservation or ticket. \n\nSo, not only should you leave some flexibility in your schedule, but make sure to confirm whether reservations and such are properly made.",

    "postText": "Made my 4th trip to Japan. Mostly did solo trip prior but for this trip i reluctantly traveled with gf, sister, brother in law, neice, and my mother. Left the 5th and landed on the 6th on April. \n\n\nApril6- land haneda and picked up pocket wifi. Made my way to my first hotel in akasaka. Ate at a near by pizza place and had some takoyaki. Called it a night shortly afterwards. (I originally intended to book in asakusa but I messed up. Was fine either way) \n\n\nApril 7th- disney sea. Umm maybe some big Disney fans enjoy it but it was whatever to me and personally wouldn't recommend besides for the fact of saying you went to disney sea. Started to rain towards end of day I was tired and in pain by the end of it. \n\n\nApril 8th- tsukiji fish market.  Was definitely packed but most if not all the food I ate was good even if it was pricey. \nAfter wards I went to tempura miyashiro. Honest review, not that great. Maybe I'm just not the biggest tempura fan but some of the other dishes were fine. \n\n\nApril 9th- Harajuku, yoyogi Park, shibuya, and shinjuku. \nEnjoyed all the snacks at Takeshita. Nice walk through the park. Afterwards went to a garden? Nearby that charged admission but was really nice as well. Made our way to shibuya for food and then to shinjuku to find a magic bar but apparently was permanently closed.\n\n\nApril 10th to 13th- tokyo to kyoto by bullet train. stayed at kyoto sasarindou. Was nice and was in a great location.\n\n. Did the typical kyoto things such as arashiyama Park. Was very nice and had wonderful food as well. \n\n\nApril 13 to 15th kyoto to osaka by bullet train. Stayed at dontobori hotel. Was in a great location. Somehow they offered free beer from like 3pm to 11pm amount other things as well. Hotel smelled like smoke but was okay. \n\nExplored Dontonbori and went to umeda tower and ate lots of food. And also went to team lab botanical garden at night which was okay!\n\n\n15th through 18th went back to tokyo and stayed in roppongi Fresa inn. In my opinion was very nice! \n\nEnded going to aquarium museum in ginza- was decent.\nWent to sky tower- its okay. On my last night went to shibuya sky which was my favorite and had a great time. \n\nOverall a great trip. Ended up ditching family the majority of the days. because they take forever to get ready and start the day!! So just be and my gf.",

(I'm not a huge Disney fan and I don't even know the difference between Tokyo Disney and Disney sea, but so many people go there on this sub so I'm curious)",

I personally feel like park has no identity and just throws random rides together. The buildings don't really look like disney. But it's not terrible maybe I had too high of expectations.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! My fianc\u00e9e and I (25M/23F) will be visiting Japan for the first time in June. We have done a lot of research however we have some worries about some parts of our trip.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to critique if the days are too relaxed or too overwhelming.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Should we attempt USJ on arrival day instead of going on a Sunday? (express pass will be used)\n* We will not arrive at Hakone until 1-2 pm. Would we have time to actually do anything before places close? I believe we can fit \u014cwakudani, but not sure; also would Hakone free pass still be worth it for just one location?\n* Should I switch days 11 and 15 since Ginza is closer to Disney?\n* Should we add more to any days, we don't plan to do much just eat and explore sights except for the theme park days.\n\n**Itinerary overview:**\n\n**June 09 - 12: Osaka**\n\n&gt;*Hotel: Honmachi Area*\n\nDay 1: 06/09\n\n* 9 am Arrival Kansai Airport\n* Walk around local areas \n   * Osaka Castle\n   * Umeda (umeda sky)\n\nDay 2: 06/10\n\n* Day Trip to Nara\n   * Visit shrines and deer park\n* Dontonbori at night\n\nDay 3: 06/11\n\n* Universal Studios\n   * Falls on a Sunday (should we switch with day 1 to avoid crowds?)\n\n**June 12-14: Kyoto**\n\n&gt;*Hotel: Nishiki Market Area*\n\nDay 4: 06/12\n\n* (Osaka -&gt; Kyoto)\n* Walk around locally\n   * Nijo Castle, \n   * Imperial Palace,\n   * Pontocho Alley\n\nDay 5: 06/13\n\n* Nishiki Market (breakfast)\n* Arashiyama\n   * Bamboo Forest, shrine, train ride, monkey mountain(?)\n\n**June 14-16: Kyoto**\n\n&gt;*Hotel: Park Hyatt Kyoto*\n\nDay 6: 06/14\n\n* Explore Gion\n   * Kodai-ji Temple\n   * Yasaka Shrine\n   * Hanamikoji Street\n\nDay 7: 06/15\n\n* Fushimi Inari (5am?)\n* Walk Around \n   * Ninenzaka\n   * Sanneizaka\n   * Kiyomizu-dera\n\n**June 16: Hakone** (should we skip Hakone?)\n\n&gt;*Hotel: Gora Area*\n\nDay 8: 06/16\n\n* (Kyoto -&gt; Hakone)\n* Arrival at hotel around 1-2pm\n* Owakudani 2-4pm?

            "comment": "Wouldn't suggest moving USJ to the day of your arrival as delays can occur--flight gets moved, immigration takes too long, etc. and IMO a 9am arrival time is already too late for USJ, ideally you want to be at the park before opening time.\n\nSunday will definitely be busy but doable if you get an express pass and go as early as possible.\n\nYour best option if you really want to make the most out of USJ is to move it to Monday June 12, or better yet, Tuesday June 13. Go early AND get an express pass. It's possible to make the trip there from Kyoto anyway.\n\nAlso would recommend to buy your tickets (and express passes) as early as now because they do run out. Do note though that once you buy them, you can't change the date or get them refunded. We bought for June 2 just earlier today and the original express passes we wanted to get were already sold out.\n\nI hope you have lots of fun on your trip! I'll also be in Osaka June 9-12 \\^\\^",

    "postText": "Hi all! This is my first time planning an overseas trip on my own and first time in Japan. I planned this trip for myself and 5 friends, all in our late 20s. Flying out in..2 days. It will include lots of going to bed late and waking up at dawn to catch the train to maximize the day. Main focus is architecture, historic landmarks, tourist hotspots. My friends are also focused on food and anime related activities.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nDay 1: Tokyo\n\nArrive, check in at hostel at 4pm. Shower, nap, go out at night to Shinjuku. Walk around the Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocko.\n\nDay 2: Head to Osaka\n\nTake the train early to Osaka. Arrive around noon. Check out the Nanba Shrine, Dotonbori, and take a look at Nanba Parks. Visit Denden Town if time allows. Check into our rental whenever we're allowed to (a ten minute walk away from Dotonbori so not too concerned)\n\nDay 3: Day trip to Nara, more Osaka\n\nHead out early to Nara. Check out Nara park and Mt. Wakakusa. Head back early afternoon. Stop at Horyu-ji Kondo on the way back to Osaka. Check out Osaka Castle  (optional). Go to Umeda Sky Building or Abeno Harukas (which one is better?)\n\nDay 4: Koyasan\n\nHead out to Koyasan after breakfast. Check in to Temple and walk around Okunoin Cemetery down to Daimon Gate. Do a night tour of the cemetery.\n\nDay 5: Kyoto\n\nStay in Koyasan for the morning ceremony and check out. Head to Kyoto. Here is where I need help. I have a massive list of things I want to do in Kyoto and could use some insight on what could be cut out. Hoping to get there early enough but definitely want to visit Fushimi Inari,  Sanjusangendo Temple, and Sannezaka Ninezaka. Optional stuff for this day include Kiyomizu-deru Temple,  Eikandi Zenrinji, and Ginkakuji Temple.\n\nDay 6: Kyoto\n\nHead out early to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. Visit the monkey park. Then go to  Ryoan-ji Temple and (maybe walk to) Kinkaku-ji Temple. Visit Nitishiki market and walk towards the Samurai/ninja museum. Pontocho Park for dinner and late night walk to Yasaka-jinja Shrine. Walk back to our apartment. Optional stuff: Kyoto Imperial Palace, Nijo Castle, Heian-jingu Shrine.\n\nDay 7: Tokyo\n\nHead to Tokyo, Check out Akihabara District.\n\nDay 8: Tokyo\n\nVisit teamLab Plants in the morning. Explore Harajuku, Yoyogi Park, Shibuya crossing.\n\nDay 9: Flight out\n\nBreakfast before flying out late afternoon.\n\nI think the only part I'm concerned about is Kyoto. I fully expect to things not go as planned but Kyoto is the city I'm having a hard time compromising on. Thank you, again!",

You can find the same crap in the US or elsewhere. \n\nI thought Todai-ji was very worth doing in Nara. \n\nWe just had three days in Kyoto and it didn\u2019t feel like enough, I\u2019d skip koyasan and add a Kyoto night. One night in a place is tough without a good reason to be there.",

This is a lot for a one week trip. \n\nOn your first night, Omiode Yokocho and Golden Gan Gai are firstly tiny, and also quite inaccessible to non-japanese speakers. So, don't plan to spend the evening there. \n\nAs to Kyoto, you'll be able to go to Fushimi Inari, then Gion (including ninenzaka, sanenzaka and Kiyomizuderu) in a day. Then, maybe Potocho alley for the evening. Ginkakuji is a fair way northeast, and relatively isolated - tripping here will be an additional hour + from Gion. Kyoto is big, crowded, and shrines take time. \n\nBoth Osaka and Kyoto aquariums are stellar and worth visiting.",

Didn\u2019t go to Koyasan but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve given yourself enough time in Osaka or Tokyo and if Kyoto is higher on your list that\u2019s also a short time.\n\nIf your friends are food people 100% go to Ramen Nagi when you\u2019re in Golden Gail. Very unique style all homemade that you won\u2019t find elsewhere",

Everyone will have their must-see list, but with two days, make sure you hit the stuff on the top of your list so you don't regret missing it due to someone's suggestion. On the plus side, it leaves you with plenty of stuff to see on another trip.",

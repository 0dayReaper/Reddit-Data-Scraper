    "postText": "Hello,\nI will go to Kyushu in less than a week, but I still can't decide about what to visit in Fukuoka area.\nI will be in Fukuoka for 4 days, and here is the plan:\nday 1 - Rakusuien, Sumiyoshi, ACROS building, Ohori park and Fukuoka tower\n\nday 2 - Arita and Takeo onsen\n\nday 3 - Hakata old area - Kushida jinja, Hakata Furusatokan, Tochoji temple, Shofukuji shrine\n\nday 4 - Dazaifu area\n\nI am not certain about the \"day 2\". I depend on public transportation and I just don't know is the Arita (and Takeo) worth it. \nAlso, Yusentei park, it is about 40 minutes away from everything.\n\nDoes someone has another suggestion?\nThank you!",

If you go, my fave cafe is Gallery Arita. They will let you select your tea cup from a wall of gorgeous pottery, feels super special.",

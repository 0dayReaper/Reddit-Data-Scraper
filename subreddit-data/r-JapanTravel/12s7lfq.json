    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nWe just wrapped up our huge Japan trip. [This was my post regarding our itinerary](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/109u31g/57day_japan_itinerary/)\n\nAbout us: We are a family of 4(2 kids, 4yo and 1yo)\n\nNow let me start on our highlights and learnings.\n\nHighlights:\n\n* Hoshino Resort Tomamu - A family-friendly ski resort in Tomamu\n*  Tokyo Disney Resort\n* Shinkansens and all other trains - our son loves trains, specially the shinkansens. During our trip, I think we\u2019ve seen most, if not all, shinkansen models in service, including Dr. Yellow and East-i. \n* Science museums - we went to a few different science museums and each and everyone of those gave us fun-filled days. Most of the exhibits are interactive so the kids loved it. \n* Train museums - as I already said, my son loves trains so we had a blast going to the train museums in Yamanashi, Nagoya, Kyoto, and Saitama. \n* Ramen - my son\u2019s wise words, \u201cRamen every day, Ramen every night.\u201d Our kids simply loved the different types of ramen we tried throughout the trip \n* Yakiniku - Our kids love good beef\n*  JR passes - we had 2 x 21 days of green passes for 2 adults and 1 child. We\u2019re glad that we splurged a bit on this as the added comfort of the green class made the longer trips a bit more relaxing. \n* seventeen ice cream - our son absolutely loved this ice cream you can get from vending machines \n* Little miss congeniality - we\u2019ve lost count how many times our daughter made friends(train commuters, restaurant staff, etc.) in every place we went. The elderly people were really fond of her as she likes to wave hi to people. We were given a number of treats(lollies, snacks, breads) just because our daughter was playing with them. \n* Unprompted \u201cI love you\u201ds - This is not really related to Japan but this pretty much made the trip for me. The most heartwarming one was when we were in the Hakodate morning market, my wife wanted to have sushi so we split up since our son don\u2019t eat sushi. We had a small dad-son date to a ramen joint nearby, and while we were slurping our ramen, my son said, \u201cI love you, Mars.\u201d He loves planets and refer to himself as Earth, his sister as moon, his mum as Venus, and me as Mars. Almost got teary-eyed from the joy when I heard him say those words.\n\nLearnings/Thoughts: \n\n* Don\u2019t even try having a \u201cconnecting\u201d flight where you need to transfer from Narita to Haneda. This was our first planning mistake as we initially thought that it would be okay. While we made it to the end of that day without missing our flight in Haneda, we were quite exhausted. Good thing the kids were in a very cooperating mood that day. \n* Klooks can sometimes be more expensive than buying tickets directly from an attraction website. \n* No one follows the speed limits(as far as our experience with driving in Hokkaido went) \n* It\u2019s worth looking at the few-days city passes. We had the 2-day Osaka Amazing Pass and it was well worth it. \n* Taqbin is great. But, I think traveling light is still best. We brought 4 bags and 1 pram so I could not even imagine our trip being possible without the baggage delivery service. It was easy enough to find coin laundries around. \n* Kids can be unpredictable, be very flexible\n*  Some of our very fun days were days when we just winged it and took our time. \n* Kobe beef is great but have you tried Hakodate beef? \n* Lawson &gt; FamilyMart &gt; 7/11 - while 7/11 usually had the widest variety, we thought that the food was better from Lawson \n* I love Butadon \n* Learnt about the Nagoya breakfast \n* Some small restaurants charge a seat charge \n* We mostly skipped the temples and shrines as we don\u2019t think it was age-appropriate for the kids. We didn\u2019t want to disrespect the temples/shrines with the possibilty of our kids having tantrums\n\nNotable Hotels/Restaurants: \n\n* Hoshino Resort Tomamu - This hotel is very family-friendly and the hotel building is connected to the shops and restaurants via an indoor walkway\n*  Tokyo Disney Resort \n* Lazuli Hiroshima Hotel\n*  [\u9ebaStyle\u4e09\u5d8b \u672d\u5e4c\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3](https://goo.gl/maps/xZFRhJjW8qamKZZU8) \\- Ramen and Mazasoba\n*  [La Shomon](https://goo.gl/maps/oXg5i747dYVSYMHs6) \\- Yakiniku, Kobe beef \n* [\u96cc\u725b\u5c02\u9580\u5e97 \u677f\u524d\u713c\u8089\u4e00\u725b \u795e\u6238\u4e09\u5bae\u5e97](https://goo.gl/maps/ceTDfdBCnyryCbU46) \\- Yakiniku \n* [Masuhiro Kamihatchobori](https://goo.gl/maps/YiJBhFN8ZNPdRuGD6) \\- Hiroshima okonomiyaki \n* Ichiran - Ramen, our favourite\n\nThe trip\n\nDay 1: MNL - NRT - HND - CTS\n\n* This was an exhausting way to start the trip. We flew in from Manila. The flight was around 9:30AM and we arrived at Narita at around 2:30PM. It took us about 1.5 hours to get through immigration and customs, pick up the SIM cards that we pre-booked, and sending our bags(some to Hoshino Tomamu, some to Sapporo). We were just in time for the limo bus we booked at 4:15PM going to Haneda airport. The bus ride took about 1.5 hours. We arrived in New Chitose at 9:30PM and in Hotel Grand Terrace Chitose at 10PM. It was a long day. We were pretty much running on fumes by the end of it.\n\nDay 2: Travel to Hoshino Resorts Tomamu\n\n*  Checked out from the hotel at around 10AM. Went to Minami-Chitose to catch the 11:05 train to Tomamu. It was very crowded so we decided to skip it and wait for the next one. That was a wrong decision. The next train was delayed by over an hour. When we arrived at Tomamu station, the hotel shuttle buses are waiting for the guests. The check-in process went smoothly and the hotel staff were great. We had a very late lunch(thankfully we had some snacks during the train delay) We rested for a bit then went to the ice village where our son enjoyed some snow play\n\nDay 3: \n\n* We pretty much spent the day playing in snow. \n* We also went up the Unkai Gondola and enjoyed the view from above.\n*  We had to grab our snowboarding rental for an early lesson the following morning\n\nDay 4: \n\n* My son and I booked a private group lesson. It was very enjoyable. We were provided with 2 instructors so we scored a pretty good deal since the group lesson for kids was only a 2000 yen cheaper than an additional person during private lessons. The instructors were great and were both English-speaking. \n* We had some more snow play in the afternoon\n\nDay 5: Tomamu to Furano La Terre \n\n* Picked up a car from Toyota rent-a-car found near the hotel\u2019s lobby\n* The snowfall that day was a bit heavy so really took our time to make sure we are safe on the trip \n* We arrived at Furano La Terre at around 2PM We had a tatami room and it was pretty nice. The hotel was amazing. I think it only had about 20+ rooms and it had an onsen on the premises.\n\nDay 6: Furano sightseeing\n\n*  Went to Biei Blue Pond to just see it covered in snow(lol)\n* Continued driving to Shirahige waterfall which was amazing\n* We then drove to Furano Cheese Factory to have some pizza. The kids were sleeping when we arrived so we let them sleep a bit and just chilled in the car. The pizza was quite good and we also got to try some cheese from shop\u2019s sampler upstairs. \n* We then headed to the Ningle terrace walked around for a bit then went to the Kan Kan Mura and enjoyed some snow tubing\n\nDay 7: Furano to Sapporo\n\n* We drove to Villa Koshido Odori in Sapporo\n* The room was huge. Iirc, it had 6 beds. It was amazing. \n* After checking-in, we returned the car near Sapporo station For dinner, we had amazing ramen and mazesoba from \u9ebaStyle\u4e09\u5d8b \u672d\u5e4c\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\n\nDay 8: \n\n* Was planning to go to the science centre but it\u2019s closed until 2024 \n* We decided to just go to the Fantasy Kids Resort in Shin-Sapporo and pretty much spent the day playing with the kids \n* Went to the Sapporo TV Tower to check out the view at night\n\nDay 9: \n\n* Exchange our 1st set of exchange orders for our JR pass \n* Went to Otaru\n*  We had lunch at this place called Naruto Main Shop which served this huge fried chickens.

Hakodate ropeway. \n* Had dinner at Lucky Pierrot. It was different.\n\nDay 13: \n\n* Went to Goryokaku park and strolled around the park for a couple of hours \n* In the afternoon, we went to the Hakodate Miraikan and Hakodate Kids Plaza. Both can be found in the same building. Both are quite small but the kids had a lot of fun playing.\n\nDay 14: \n\n* I did the laundry in the morning while my wife brought the kids back to the Hakodate Kids Plaza. \n* Followed them for lunch and did more laundry in the afternoon \n* We had dinner at a small Yakiniku joint where we tried and loved the Hakodate beef\n\nDay 15: Hakodate - Akita \n\n* We rode Hayabusa and Komachi \n* Checked in at Ana Crowne Plaza Akita \n* Had dinner at the hotel\u2019s buffet and it was pretty good.

I was in the area during my trip last month and considered visiting to get out of the rain, but it was a Sunday so the test track wasn\u2019t running, and all the reviews on Google said something along the lines of \u201cYeah, this isn\u2019t going to fill a whole day\u201d.\n\nI loved that logic of \u201cTokyo Station is too busy, let\u2019s go to Shinjuku instead\u201d. Shinjuku is the world\u2019s busiest train station. Tokyo, by contrast, is in eighth place. =)\n\nDeers are definitely not Nara\u2019s main draw card. That would be the shrines and temples, and since you elected to not visit those (like, not even at all?), there wasn\u2019t really all that much point in going to Nara.\n\nI\u2019m a mite perplexed as to why you seem to have visited the Kawaguchiko area twice\u2026",

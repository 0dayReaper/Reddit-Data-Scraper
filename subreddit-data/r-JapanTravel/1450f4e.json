    "postText": "Hello, my partner (male) and I (female) are a young couple from New Zealand coming to the end of our first trip in Japan. Unfortunately, today I was using the public toilet in Harajuku Yoyogi Park and noticed someone holding their phone above the stall pointing it at me, in a panic, I banged the bathroom stall and they ran out.  My partner was using the male bathroom and come out shortly after the incident and there were a few people around but we weren\u2019t confident enough with our Japanese/ I was quite uncomfortable staying the the area. \n\nI am looking for advice on if there is any way of reporting this? There were cameras outside the bathroom with signs saying under surveillance (only one exit so most likely the person is on camera). If not, a warning to anyone to be careful and vigilant using outdoor public toilets. In future, my partner and I will not be using outdoor public bathrooms at the same time and will have someone watching outside. \n\nThank you for any advice :)",

In the end, it was a grass-roots network of friends-of-friends-of-friends that supported her and went with her to translate what was going on etc. \n\nIf you feel inclined, I would report this to the authorities in an attempt to get attention on this kind of behaviour in case they're investigating a series of incidents.

    "postText": "Alrighty, I'll describe my first time travel in japan, what went well, what didn't go well, my overall impression of Japan. We travelled trough quite a few cities, but I'll try to keep it as short as possible as I'm not much of writer.\nAnd we've visited quite a few places, so if you'd like more details, comment and I'll go more in-depth :).\n\nA bit about the travelling party. Me(25M) and a work colleague(26M), Lithuanians(Europe) software engineers, reasonably fit and somewhat fluent in english, Omnivores(my colleague is allergic to cheese), our height is around \u00b1185cm.\n\n### TL;DR\n\n#### Cities/islands visited\nTokyo(Shinjuku) -&gt;  Osaka -&gt; Nara -&gt; Kyoto -&gt; Onomichi Islands -&gt; Matsuyama -&gt; Hiroshima -&gt; Miyajima -&gt; Kumamoto -&gt; Aso(region) -&gt; Fukuoka -&gt; Nagasaki -&gt; Nagoya -&gt; Takayama -&gt; Magome -&gt; Matsumoto - &gt; Tokyo(Chuo) -&gt;  Tokyo(Shibuya) -&gt; Tokyo(Teito) -&gt; Hakone.\n\n#### Expenses\nI was slightly more conservative with my spending so my expenses are on the cheaper side, my colleague spent quite a bit more, especially on food and booze.\n\nTotal amount spent: slightly more than 3k euros in japan + 1.1k euros flights back and forth.\n\nEDIT:\n~~Daily food expenses: 30-40 eur or 5k-7k yen.~~\n\n\nDaily food expenses: 3k-4k\nDaily travel fares(bus, metro), museums and other activities: 1k-3k\n\nAverage hotel stay: ~60euro\n\nFood:\n- Breakfast - usually something from a convenience store. Chicken, power gels, chocolate, melon bread(my favourite),\n- Lunch - something from a convenience store or a restaurant\n- Dinner - restaurant usually a ramen place\n\n#### Activities\nMuseums, castles, shrines, forests, mountains, walks around the city. We did a lot of walking, total around 400km of walking(at leasts that's what google fit shows)\n\nAlright that's a brief summary, now for the more in-depth write up.\n\n#### My key takeaways\n- Japan is a very safe country, I felt safe everywhere, even in the shady parts of Tokyo.\n- People are very polite, they'll go out of their way to help you, even if they don't speak english.\n- People are very quiet, you won't hear people talking on the phone, or talking loudly in public transport.\n- Be polite, if you don't understand or thing that this is not how it should be, don't be rude, just accept it and move on. You are an alien in their country, not the other way around. So please don't ever raise your voice, japanese people are not malicious, they'll try to help you, but they might not understand you.\n- If you want to feel appreciated, learn at least the basics on japanese, it's not that hard, and it'll make your life easier. I did it through doulingo, reached unit 14 in a month and that was sufficient to have very simple conversation.\n\nThis is it for the TL;DR part. I'll go more in-depth for the rest of the post.\n\n## Planning for the trip\nWe started planning the trip, where we'll go, where we'll stay, what we'll do, expenses, trains, all that you can plan was started to be planned around a month prior to the trip. We created a word doc as our itinerary, that was around 60 pages long. From what I've read on this page about you can't plan everything. Well I believe we did, we might've even over planned :D.\n\nSo we booked the following hotels:\n- Tokyo - Apa Hotel Higashi Shinjuku Kabukicho Tower(04.25-04.26)\n- Osaka - APA Hotel Namba Kita Shinsaibashi Ekimae(04.26-04.30)\n- Onomichi island - TOMARIGI Hostel(04.30-05.01)\n- Matsuyama - Hotel Patio Dogo(05.01-05.02)\n- Hiroshima - Wholeearth Ryokan Hiroshima(05.02-05.04)\n- Kumamoto - Hotel Wing International Select Kumamoto(05.04-05.08)\n- Nagoya - Sotetsu Fresa Inn Nagoya Shinkansenguchi(05.08-05.10)\n- Magoame - Magomechaya(05.10-05.11)\n- Matsumoto - Hotel M Matsumoto(05.11-05.12)\n- Tokyo - APA Hotel Ginza Kyobashi Tokyo Station Yaesu South Gate(05.14-05.17)\n\n\nExtra things we bought in advance:\n- Water proof bags\n- Hiking boots and socks\n- Bigger backpacks\n- JP Rail pass, we booked the trains in advance, but honestly that wasn't necessary even during golden week\n- Bandages for foot blisters, medicine(for headaches, motion sickness, diarrhoea).\n- Ubigi eSim internet(10GB was plenty for me throughout the trip)\n- Sun screen(did not use and got sunburned to a point where I was shinning red)\n- Portable battery\n\n## The trip\n### Day 1(04.25)\nWe arrived at the Haneda aiport, exchanged some cash to yen(was at a better course than locally),\nprinted out our JR passes(**IMPORTANT TO DO SO HERE, only major stations let you print it out**)\nand went to the metro. We took the train to Shinjuku, and walked to our hotel to check-in.\nWe were quite tired, bought some chicken from lawson and went to explore a few places,\na few drinks in golden gai district and ramen in a nearby place. Eventually we ended up at rock bar mother. Really cool place, for each drink you can request 2 songs to be played.\nAfter that back to hotel, visit the top floor onsen and sleep\n\n### Day 2(04.26)\nGot up early, travelled to osaka. Left our luggage in the hotel, we were too early for a check in.\nWe went to see Osaka castle(quite beautiful), tried takoyaki there.\nMore city exploring, then we went check-in. After that we went to see the Umeda Sky Building in the evening(we bought the ticket in advance)\nvery beautiful, it was very clear and beautiful. Got back to the city, got some ramen, went to the hotel and sleep.\n\n### Day 3(04.27)\nWent to USJ, bought tickets(basic, no express stuff) in advance. We went there 30minutes before opening, and there was already a huge line.\nWe went to Nintendo first, the zone looked very nice, but ride it'd say was okay'ish for me.\nAfter that the dinosaur rides, minion land, grabbed chinese food for lunch, went to the harry potter zone,\nat this point the lines got quite long around 1h to 1h 30min of wait time. After that we went to see Water world\nwhere they were doing a play, was really awesome, I'd say a must see even if you don't understand Japanese,\nthe acting is very good. After that we went to Osaka aquarium(no lines, thank god), it was beautiful, cute chonks and other sea creatures.\n\n### Day 4(04.28)\nTrip to Kyoto from Osaka. We went early by metro, to see the bamboo forest(7:40'ish), beautiful, few people.\nWalked around the park then climbed the mount a fed the monkeys(50 yen for a bag of fruits or nuts), very cute,\ntried petting the hand of one, didn't go well got an aggressive show of teeth. After that we visited\nRyoanji temple, went to nishi market, we we're running a bit late so we took a taxi to Kiyomizudera,\nwe saw the geish district on our way to there, looked interesting. After the temple we went to a bar\nand got back to Osaka and then after a bowl of ramen to our hotel.\n\n### Day 5(04.29)\nWe went to Nara, took this hiking [track](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/japan/nara/kasuga-taisha-shrine-mount-wakakusa-kasugayama-primeval-forest-loop)\nsaw the deer, bought some food, did the whole bow thing then fed them. One thing to keep in mind is to crumble the cookie and give it\nin small pieces, otherwise you'll run out of food to give quickly.\nThey might be very \"assertive\" and try to take it from you, don't be afraid, just stick your empty arm out to get some distance and that's it .\nThey're not gonna bite you. After that we went to see the Todaiji temple, it was beautiful, the buddha statue was huge.\nGot back to Osaka, got some ramen, went to the hotel, scheduled to send our luggage to our next hotel and went to sleep.\n\n### Day 6(04.30)\nGot up early, went to Onomichi, rented some bikes and began our cycling journey through the islands.\nA lot of cool bridges, very beautiful nature. We cycled to north Omishima port, where we transfered to rabbit island\npet and fed the rabbits, got back and cycled to our ryokan and straight to sleeping.\n\n### Day 7(05.01)\nMore cycling, more cool bridges, more beautiful nature. We arrived at Imabari, returned our bikes and took the train to Matsuyama.\nWe ate some stree food, relaxed in the open hot springs for feet. Walked around and went to sleep.\nTo be honest I'd say this was the favorite city of the whole trip for me. I liked the vibe, the people, the food, the nature, the onsen, the layout, the architecture.\nIn general, beautiful city.\n\n### Day 8(05.02)\nEarly in the morning visited a public onsen nearby, then went to see the Matsuyama castle, it was beautiful, tried the orange juice there,\nit was really good, got back to our hotels, got some dango. Packed our stuff, got a taxi and went to the port and took the ferry to Hiroshima.\nChecked in the ryokan. Took a train to Hiroshima city center, visited the castle and then the nuclear museum.\nGet the english audio for best experience. It took me around 2hours to walk through everything, read it and take it in.\nIt was very nerve racking, but I'd say a must see. After that we went out to eat some Okonomiyaki, it was delicious, then back to the ryokan and sleep.\n\n### Day 9(05.03)\nWent to Miyajima island first by train then transfer by ferry. It was very beautiful, the mountain hike was also fun,\nthe view on top was amazing. When we came down from the mountain there was a low tide, so we could go near the Itsukushima shrine.\nGot back to Hiroshima, went to the city center for a couple of beers, got back to Ryokan and went to sleep.\n\n### Day 10(05.04)\nFirst day of the Golden week, wouldn't say that I've noticed anything different, maybe because we were travelling to the far south of Japan - Kumamoto.\nThis is one of those cities that I also enjoyed more than the big common ones, it looked very nice, had a beautiful castle, was not crowded as Hiroshima, Osaka or Tokyo.\nWe rented out bikes, cycled to Honmoji park(the place near Honmoji park is god damn maze, keep you google maps always open or you will get lost)\nfound a place to eat, visited Lafcadio Hearn House and went to our hotel and then to sleep.\n\n### Day 11(05.05)\nWe rentend a car and went to Aso, highly recommend renting a car here, since the public transport is not that good.\nThe drive was very nice, we went to see active volcano crater, luckily it was not erupting, so we were allowed to get close.\nThen we went around and climbed the other inactive mountain caps. Climbing that was one of the most fun hikes I've had.\nIt was very windy, you could barely see past 5 meters anywhere, because of the fog. There was no smell of sulfur, so it was safe.\nWe visited Mt. Nakadake, Mt. Takadake, overall the place looked like Mordor, the vibes, the weather everything.\nAfter that we visited Ayugaeno Falls, the ravines and everything was just majectic. After that we got back\nto Kumamoto, gave back the car and went somewhere to eat. Car rental cost around ~7k yen in total. So I'd say a good price.\nAfter eating, we went to our hotel and then to sleep.\n\n### Day 12(05.06)\nWe went to Fukuoka, by train, walked around the city, visited Tochoji temple, Fukuoka castle ruins, Ohori park and explored the huge ravine type shopping mall.\nWent to the science museum(big mistake, it's for kids...). After that we tried Ichiran ramen(originated in Fukuoka so we thought it be better).\nWas the same as everywhere else. It was rainy so we got back pretty early to our hotel and went to sleep.\n\n### Day 13(05.07)\nWe went to Nagasaki, by train, visited the atomic bomb museum, it was very interesting, just as good as the one in Hiroshima.\nWe took a boat ride to see Gunkanjima, though we couldn't get on the island, because of the weather, it was still very interesting to see\nand hear the history of the island. Explored the Dutch district, walked around the shops, tried some whale meat.\nIt was raining the whole day, so we also got back quite early and went to sleep.\n\n### Day 14(05.08)\nWe got up early and went got straight to the train station, and caught the train to Nagoya. The longest train ride by far.\nWe arrived at Nagoya, checked in our hotel, went to the city center, visited the castle, it was very beautiful, then we wanted to explore the abandoned tunnel near Aichi.\nApparently it was closed, we decided we're going to enter through the exit, like rascals, but apparently after we circled\naround there was a police officer that was guarding traffic through the bridge and wouldn't let us through. So our trip ended there.\nAfter comming back to Nagoya we visited the sky scrapper, it had interesting installations on the windows. We had our stay\ngot back to hotel and went to sleep.\n\n### Day 15(05.09)\nWe went to Takayama, by train, one of the most scenic train rides so far. We strolled around the city\ncenter, visited the early morning market, bought some souvenirs, tried some white strawberries,\nmushroom tee and other local cuisine. Visited Takayama Showa Museum, which was 10/10. You could touch\nalmost everything, the museum gave a great vibe, it was like you were in a house of a family that lived\nthere. There was also an old nintendo with mario kart that you could play, put on a old yukata and take photos.\nPlay pachinko(no money needed), watch an old-school movie. We visited a few sake tasting places, I've\nfound a few flavours that I liked. After that back to Nagoya, eat ramen and sleep.\n\n### Day 16(05.10)\nWe sent out our luggage to Matsumoto, caught a train to Nagiso and then hiked the Nakasendo trail to Tsumago\nand then Magome where we checked in and stayed at the local ryokan. The hike was very nice and relaxing\none of the easier hikes I've had, the places we saw we're quite old and beautiful. At ryokan we met\npeople one American and one from Germany, they had a guitar so we chatted a bit, played the guitar and had\na few beers. The dinner at ryokan was amazing, looked very traditional Japanese dinner. Was also very tasty,\nwould definitely recommend this place. After that we went to sleep.\n\n### Day 17-19(05.11)\nGot up early and took a bus to Nakatsugawa Eki-mae station where we travelled to Matsumoto.\nWe left our bags and went to the RubyKaigi conference. Overall good conference, I've learned somethings,\nbut most importantly I've had bit of time to rest and catch up on some sleep, since we weren't exploring new cities.\nSo overall the following 3 days were wake up -&gt; breakfast -&gt; conference -&gt; lunch -&gt; conference -&gt; drinks -&gt; dinner -&gt; sleep.\n\n### Day 20(05.14)\nSlept in, had breakfast and travelled to Tokyo by train. Left our luggage at the hotel and moved on to explore the Chou region.\nWalked around the Ginza, Imperial palace, Yasukuni shrine and went to check in. After that it was getting dark, so travelled to\nAkihabara to experience the anime night life, was quite bright and interesting. Though the amount of requests\nto visit a maid cafe was too damn high. If your planning to buy a PS5, a new GPU or Nintendo switch, this could be the place,\nI saw PS5 with two controllers for 60k yen, with a 10% tax refund that is around 370 euros. After some exploration, got back to our hotel\nand went to sleep.\n\n### Day 21(05.15)\nThis was our Hakone day trip, we bought the 3 day pass for it, so we could use the train, bus, ropeway and boat.\nWas worth it, even for one day. We climbed Mt. Kintoki, thankfully the weather was great and we could see Fuji.\nThe climb was very nice, the view was amazing, the weather was great, no bears to be seen. After climbing down,\nwe played some golf that was near there. Travelled back to the station were we used the rope-way\nto get around the mountains, the view was just majestic, we saw the sulfur pits, the stench was, well\nstrong to say the least, but overall enjoyed the experience. We didn't make it time to the boat, so we had to\ntravel back by bus, which wasn't so bad, since the scenery was amazing.\n\n### Day 22(05.16)\nExplored more Tokyo, so we went to Teito district, went to the Ueno zoo, National science museum. After that\nwe went to Kaminarimon gate, Asakusa shrine and moved to Shibuya next. There we went to the Yoyogi park,\nMeiji Jingu shrine, paid our respects to Hachiko statue. The last activity was to visit TeamLabs Planets,\nwhich were amazing, one most interesting experiences, not gonna spoil any details, overall great experience,\nwould do it again. As it was getting late we got back to Shibuya, walked around more, had a drink and went back\nto our hotel.\n\n### Day 23(05.17)\nLast day in Japan was spent buying souvenirs, snacks and other stuff to bring back home. Packing our luggage,\nto accommodate for the extras, getting to Haneda airport and back to Lithuania.\n\nI'm very happy I had the opportunity to go on such a trip, I enjoyed it a lot even though,\nI'm quite the couch potato so 3 weeks is a bit much for me, but nonetheless, wouldn't change a thing.",

I do have story I can tell, not that they raised their voice, but tourist who seemed unhappy of the service she got because she did not understood hot things work.\n\nBooking train during golden week can be a really good idea. Go ask my friend who was standing in the shinkansen all the way from Osaka to Tokyo on the last day of Golden Week because he did not reserve a seat.\n\nIt is not that important to get the pass at the airport, there is a list of stations where you can do it, so if the line is long and you are tired, might as well go change the pass on a different day in Tokyo.\n\nWent to Aso via train and up the mountain via bus.

I went to the udon restaurant of the first floor of Atr\u00e9 in Akihabara and it's a fast food style (like you pick the plate at the counter, pay and bring it yourself to the table). One of the item on the menu look like something with meat on top. Customer order it, get a small bowl of rice with meat on top and a bowl of udon. They where like \"no, I did not order the big bowl of udon\" and seemed a bit irritated and maybe tried to blame the \"mistake\" on the staff. But actually yes, they did order that, they just did not understood what they ordered. Then they wanted tempura items, but those are self serve, you have to take a plate and pick up yourself the items you want to add. They where borderline angry that the staff did not serve them the items, while the staff was pointing at the plate and trying to tell them they have to take the food themselves, but obviously, they do not speak English or not enough to properly explain.\n\nKyushu might have been ok for Golden Week, but I would not make a general statement. Anyway, having booked tickets cannot hurt anyway.\n\nJR Pass official website list all the stations where you can exchange or buy the pass : [https://japanrailpass.net/en/exchange.html](https://japanrailpass.net/en/exchange.html)\n\nKumamoto to Aso is about 1h15 by limited express train.\n\nAs far as I remember, Osaka Science Museum was really more for kids, I went because I knew they had a cool robot I wanted to see. Went to Miyazaki Museum of Nature and History, the history side was ok, but nature side  felt it's mostly showcasing local wildlife, local plants and insects, showing rock and mineral and some dinosaur bones, like things I would have been much more interested as a kid than as an adult. I might also have the wrong impression about science museum in general and because of that impression I tend to avoid that kind of museum, but I might also be missing something.",

I don't like crowded cities, I prefer nature and hiking, we also watched quite a few videos from [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AbroadinJapan), which influenced our decision to visit smaller cities in Japan. :)",

The bathroom was nice, all the toiletries and hygiene items were there to use, also a blow dryer. It had a open bath on 12th floor which was great.\n\nThe location is also quite convenient, golden gai is 10-15minutes from hotel, a lawson nearby.\n\nSo I'd say 9/10 for the price :)",

I don't really use any social media, so overall my monthly data consumption is always pretty low. At home I get by with 3Gb",

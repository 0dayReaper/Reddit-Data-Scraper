    "postText": "Been lurking here for a while.  This week is finally my family's turn to visit Japan.  My wife and I have been to Japan multiple times, but this will the first trip for our 6 year old son.  We are landing at HND at around 5 AM so we have a full day even on the first day.\n\n5/28 Sunday East Tokyo\n\nThe usual -- get Suica, get our JR Pass.  Since we are landing so early, we will be dropping off our luggage at the hotel first (Prince Shinagawa).\n\nSenso-ji -&gt; Kimono Rental (for wifey) -&gt; Snacks/Lunch around Kaminarimon Gate/Nakamise -&gt; Tokyo Skytree\n\n5/29 Monday DisneySea (full day)\n\n5/30 Tuesday Central Tokyo\n\nTsukiji Outer Market (probably will lunch/snack there) -&gt; Tokyo Station -&gt; Imperial Palace East Garden -&gt; Chiku Chiku Hedgehog Cafe -&gt; Ninja Tokyo (Dinner)\n\n5/31 Wednesday West Tokyo\n\nMeiji Shrine -&gt; Shibuya Crossing -&gt; Yakiniku lunch -&gt; Harajuku -&gt; Shibuya SKY (5:30 PM entrance) -&gt; Dinner at Shibuya yokocho or the new Kabuchicho Tower\n\n6/1 Thursday Ghibli + Odaiba\n\nGhibli Museum -&gt; TeamLab Planets -&gt; Odaiba (Gundam, Statue of Liberty, Rainbow bridge, Diver City)\n\nI couldn't booked a time for Ghibli museum with the \"international\" website, but was able to secure a spot with the Japanese website.  I had to reshuffle my itinerary to accommodate whatever Ghibli entrance time I can find.\n\n6/2 Friday Kawaguchiko\n\nWill do a day trip to Kawaguchiko.  Booked Fuji Excursion.  However, I will be monitoring the weather closely, if it is forecasted to rain, then I will cancel the trip and replace it with something indoor.  Doesn't make sense to spend hours on travel to see Mt Fuji  covered with clouds.\n\nEven if weather is good, I am debating how many steps my son can take to get to the Arakurayama Sengen Park...\n\nBackup Plan for bad weather - Historical Town Sawara\n\n6/3 Saturday Yokohama\n\nCup Noodles Museum -&gt; Cosmoworld -&gt; Gundam Factory -&gt; Chinatown\n\n6/4 Sunday North Tokyo\n\nUeno Ameyoko -&gt; Shopping somewhere -&gt; Pack and go to airport\n\nP.S.  Love my T-mobile plan -- just checked and it comes with 5GB high speed data free, so even though I d/led Ubigi I don't think I need to use it.",

We might not stay too late if we see him getting too tired. We can skip Soaring and Toy Story Mania since we just visited Disney World Orlando in January.",

I have a T-Mobile US plan as well and maybe we have different international plans but it wasn\u2019t 5G at all. When I got off the plane at Haneda I tried to connect to the local network and it restricted me to 256kbps. It was so frustrating that I bought a prepaid SIM card right then and there at the airport. Unlimited data and it was quick too! Lasted me the entire trip! \n\nI wish had read your post 2 weeks ago as I had just returned a few days back. I did not know about the Kabuchicho Tower and I wish I did!! Sounds like an amazing place!\n\nHave a wonderful time!",

I will likely get their 15 GB 30 days plan after that because after my Japan trip, family will be flying to Hong Kong and then China for like a month long Asia travel.  \n\nHaving the 15GB international plan that is not restrictive to a specific country (versus buying a local sim) makes it a much better deal for my situation.",

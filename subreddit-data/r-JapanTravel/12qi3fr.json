Get Google Maps as the map they give you can be a bit confusing (resulting in me briefly getting lost at one of the junctions). 2. if you\u2019re very image-conscious, wipe down/wash your face before returning the bike to the shop at the destination. I didn\u2019t realize multiple bugs had committed kamikaze on my face until I went to use the bathroom after returning the bike. Needless to say it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight.",

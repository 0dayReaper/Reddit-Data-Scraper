    "postText": "I have jet lag. Here's a trip report.\n\nAt the end of December last year, airline tickets to Japan were still pretty decent and Yen's conversion to USD still felt like Monopoly money, so I booked a 1 week trip to Japan for late April. I planned to stay in Tokyo from April 23rd - 30th and do day trips from Tokyo to go flower viewing. My previous trips had a lot of moving around and such, and this one was supposed to be more chill.\n\n...or it was until January/February when I replayed Persona 4 when it was added to GamePass, got the idea in my head to go to Japan a week earlier to visit the region that's related to the mythology used in the game, argued with myself for a month about whether to do this or not, remembered that I planned to go this area back in 2020 before Covid happened, then ended up pulling the trigger and buying a new arrival ticket for April 16th. \ud83e\udd21\n\nThis was my 3rd time visiting so tbh I'm not going to go into what I consider basic things like \"Buy an IC Card\" or \"Carry a hand towel with you\" (you should absolutely do both of those things tho). I'm gonna outline what I ended up doing, then follow up with a wall of text about whatever I feel like writing a wall of text about instead of trying to force a day by day write up.\n\n**\ud83d\udcd6 What I ended up doing \ud83d\udcd6**\n\n* Apr 16: Arrived in Tokyo, Kirby Cafe Petit (new takeout shop, different from the Kirby Cafe at Skytree), met up with friends who live in Tokyo, Sunrise Express to Izumo\n* Apr 17: Izumotaisha, Matsue Castle\n* Apr 18: Yomotsuhirasaka, Adachi Museum of Art\n* Apr 19: [Tottori sand dunes except it was \"someone is going to die\" fog weather outside](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102584958847045722/PXL_20230419_064000467.jpg), caught the [sand Pokemon bus](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102584943902732359/PXL_20230419_071342665.jpg) back to the station\n* Apr 20: 3 hour chartered tourist taxi in Tottori, Kinosaki Onsen, Onsenji, ryokan and chill\n* Apr 21: Long ass travel day, did the whole course around Amanohashidate, then to Osaka\n* Apr 22: Ate fluffy pancakes, went to the Persona 25th Anniversary Exhibit at ATC, had *a moment* when I realized what the script and storyboard chosen to represent Persona 4 was\n* Apr 23: Nozomi back to Tokyo and chill / do laundry / etc day\n* Apr 24: [Nezu Jinja for the flower festival](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102663765599719464/PXL_20230424_013027866.jpg), got trapped in Ikebukuro station Parco because I saw a cute dress (don't worry, I bought it), escaped the station and did anime shit, friend dinner at Eorzea Cafe the themed cafe for FFXIV the critically acclaimed mmorpg with a free trial up to level 60 including the award winning Heavensward Expansion\n* Apr 25: [Aoyama Flower Market Tea House](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102663293983784970/PXL_20230425_022005437.jpg), [Ashikaga Flower Park in the later half of the day to see the wisteria and the illumination](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102663767130648597/PXL_20230425_074922268.jpg)\n* Apr 26: [Hitachi Seaside Park to see the nemophila](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102663766379859998/PXL_20230426_022702798.jpg) (the nemophila were past their prime, but it was pretty atmospheric with the rain), friend dinner evening high tea at Hotel Chinzanso\n* Apr 27: Fuji Excursion train to Shimoyoshida, Chureito Pagoda (LEG DAY), [witnessed Fuji in sunny weather,](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102434968191381574/PXL_20230427_031218855.jpg) ryokan stay\n* Apr 28: Shibazakura Festival, [witnessed Fuji in sunny weather with cute pink moss,](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102435052131983450/PXL_20230428_015838822.jpg) back to Tokyo\n* Apr 29: Ghibli Museum, got a head spa + massage\n\nIf you have no interest in reading about me losing my mind about a video game from 2008 and going to a stranger's house after telling her that her country's founding deity was a moron, skip to the part labeled \"General Tourism Things\" for things that might help you on your trip instead.\n\n**\ud83d\udc07 Persona 4 Bullshit Part 1: Finding Inaba \ud83d\udc07**\n\nSince I had just replayed P4, I got the idea in my head to visit the region that I believe represents where the game takes place. At the start of the game, the protagonist leaves the big city (presumably Tokyo) behind and goes to a small nowheresville city in the sticks called Inaba in the region of Yasoinaba to live with his relatives. But this is a video game, so bullshit happens, and he gains a Persona named after Izanagi, one of the important figures from the Kojiki.\n\nInaba is a fictional location, but I believe that a mashup of somewhere in Shimane and Tottori makes sense as a \"real\" location for it. The game has a lot of references to the Kojiki mythology besides Izanagi - like the protag goes to a high school in Inaba called Yasogami High (see: the Hare of Inaba, Okuninushi and his bros the Yasogami). The modern day equivalents to some of the areas used as settings in those stories can be found in the Sanin region, which spans part of Shimane and Tottori. The eastern half of the Tottori prefecture where Tottori city is also used to be called the Inaba area before it was folded into Tottori. Izanagi's uh sister-wife-enemy Izanami is said to be buried on Mt Hiba in Shimane where the modern day city of Yasugi is.&gt;!(Perhaps Izanami is hanging out as a gas station attendant around her tomb? Hmm)!&lt; And Iya, located near Yasugi, has a folklore site called Yomotsuhirasaka named after the entrance to the underworld which also gets referenced as a dungeon in P4.\n\nThe Tottori area in particular also makes sense geographically as the gang could theoretically ride scooters to the beach for the summer event, there's nearby skiing areas for the February event, plus the cast could feasibly go on a class trip to Kobe (the city used as the basis for Iwatodai from P3) from Tottori for the September event. Perhaps Tottori City itself is the larger Okina City in the game, and Inaba is like a smaller city that's on the Sanin train line? As you can tell, I have thought about this a completely normal(?) amount because I am unsatisfied with the belief in the fandom regarding Fuefuki in Yamanashi being Inaba purely due to buildings from there being used for location references. \ud83e\udd13\n\n**\ud83d\udc7b Persona 4 Bullshit Part 2: Visiting Yomotsuhirasaka \ud83d\udc7b**\n\nWhen I planned to visit Shimane in 2020, I had marked down Izumotaisha, Matsue Castle, Yushien, and the Adachi Museum of Art as places I wanted to visit. While looking into the area more in March, I found the English Shimane tourism webpage, [which curiously listed Yomotsuhirasaka as a place you could visit in Shimane](https://www.kankou-shimane.com/en/destinations/11488), as well as [Iya Shrine](https://www.kankou-shimane.com/en/destinations/11056) which is dedicated to Izanami, and I just decided that I had to go to Iya to see what seemed like a Japanese equivalent of those American roadside attractions along the interstate roads because of a 2008 video game that honestly I don't completely love - I have like 900 issues with this game - but yeah okay I packed the Persona 4 minifig in my backpack and went to the underworld.\n\nI started out the day pretty early, intending to go from Matsue to Iya, visit both Yomotsuhirasaka and Iya Shrine, then get back on the train and go to Yasugi and visit the Adachi Museum of Art. (The Adachi Museum of Art has no relation whatsoever to P4 Adachi, but the existence of an Adachi Museum of Art happening to exist in the city of Izanami's final resting place is extremely, extremely funny to me.)\n\nThe JR Iya Station is a small station that appeared to be unmanned when I got off (there was also a small cafe inside the station that wasn't open yet) and it felt like everyone was using the honor system to tap your IC card on your way out, or to drop off your paper ticket. I made the 20min walk from the station along the road and started seeing signs that said \"Yomotsuhirasaka 300m\". At the base of the hill, I encountered a sign that said \"Yomotsuhirasaka Goshuin Office\". I had no idea there was a goshuin for this, and I actually did have my goshuincho on me as I was thinking perhaps there was one at Iya Shrine, but the office looked closed.\n\nSo you walk up a hill past the goshuin office and the big sign that says \"the entrance to the underworld is 300m that way\", and after you pass the various houses and fields the bamboo and the ponds, [you come up to a small area](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102645751621881968/PXL_20230418_002955537.jpg) with some signs explaining the mythology behind Yomotsuhirasaka, the family tree of Izanagi and Izanami in the Kojiki, and a covered sitting area. The sitting area contained a notice about the goshuin office I had seen earlier - only open on weekends and national holidays, and I was there on a Tuesday morning. Then there's an upper area with a [torii](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102645752964071545/PXL_20230418_003850781.jpg), a [big stone](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102645753777762354/PXL_20230418_003955937.jpg) (seals the underworld from the living world), a letter box, and a tree labeled \"Yamamomo Tree\" (for the fruit that Izanagi stopped his pursuers with).\n\nI lingered in the area for a while cause I had brought a P4 mini figure along and wanted to take a photo ([DANCING ALL NIGHT BABY](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504124879021277205/1102629488401076264/PXL_20230418_004653672.jpg)), when an elderly lady approached the area and started tidying up the sitting area. She came up and started feeding the fish in the pond, and asked me if I had seen where the koi were. She started talking to me more, and it turns out she lives on the slope leading up to the folklore site and she's the caretaker for the folklore site. She was amazed that I was not a Japanese person but a foreigner who had come all the way out here, as this wasn't a typical tourist destination. She also thought that most Americans weren't into other religions besides their own - \"But don't all Americans love Christ?\"\n\nShe asked me why I had come here, and I *reaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllly* did not want to answer \"because Yomotsuhirasaka was a dungeon in a video game and then a character had it as a stage in the dancing game spin off\" sooooooo I told her that I had read the Kojiki instead - not really lying either, I've read the first 20 or so parts. (On the other hand, there is absolutely no way I am the first person to visit this site because of P4 in the 15 years since the game first came out.)\n\nThe convo continued; she asked how I felt when I saw the area (the day before, a man at Matsue castle had asked me a similar question about the vibe I got when I looked at the castle). I told her it was kind of sad, she asked why sad, and I replied, \"Because in the story, Izanagi was a moron, wasn't he?\" and she burst out laughing. P4 kinda touches on this too, with the unlockable February event where the protag gets the chance to try and fix Izanagi's mistake.\n\nWe ended up talking for 2-3 hours about a lot of things - travel, life, etc. It turned out that she's a calligraphy teacher who draws the Yomotsuhirasaksa goshuin and asked me if I wanted a seal as proof of my pilgrimage. And yes, I totally did, so she invited me back to her house and gave me some green tea &amp; fruit from her garden and drew the goshuin in my book. She introduced me to the farmers and named all of the flowers growing in the area on the way down the hill. This was the most Japanese I have ever used in my life.\n\nWe realized we had never actually introduced ourselves to one another. We had just been talking for 2-3 hours without doing so lol. She (dramatically) went, \"Ah, well, my name is...\", then wrote her name on a sheet of paper with a calligraphy brush before pronouncing the kanji for me. She handed me a sheet of paper and I hobbled through drawing the katakana of my name on another sheet of paper with a pencil, and we exchanged papers. (Small victories, but I consider it a win that I remembered how to write my name in katakana without cheating and using the input on my phone first.)\n\nShe mentioned she was nearing 100, and she thought that if she made it all the way to 100, that Yomotsu Ookami (Izanami) would just come and grab her and be done with it already. I realized as she talked about this, and also her family, that her husband was already long gone.\n\nPreviously, I mentioned there was a letter box at Yomotsuhirasaka. This letter box contains a stack of paper and pencils, and there's a wooden drop box with a Japan Post logo, and a sign that says \"Letters to Heaven (the Underworld)\". You're encouraged to write a letter for a dead loved one, put it in the box along with some yen, with the intention of your letter reaching said deceased person. And once per year, there's a ceremony where someone will come by and \"release\" the letters to the underworld. In retrospect, perhaps I should have left a letter for my dead older brother in the box.\n\nI didn't expect Yomotsuhirasaka to take me like 3 hours, so I did end up skipping Iya Shrine and going to Yasugi as the train was coming soon and there was a time limit on the Adachi Museum and the shuttles from/to Yasugi Station. But after the convo I had with this lady about the area, I think I can consider that paying ones respects to Izanami even though I didn't visit the shrine.\n\n**\ud83e\udd5e Persona 4 Bullshit Part 3: Misc Stuff \ud83e\udd5e**\n\n* While not actually related to Persona except by coincidence of name, the Adachi Museum of Art has a very nice landscape garden, but I think it's hard to recommend because of how far away it is from the usual tourist spots.\n* I visited Amanohashidate, which is related to the mythology but isn't in the Sanin area. If you look the sandbar upside down, they call it the bridge to the heavens that Izanagi and Izanami descended from.\n* The Persona 25th Anniversary exhibit is every weekend until mid May at the Osaka ATC Gallery. There's a display setup for each game of a location from the game plus character cardboard cutouts, then for 3/4/5 there are also statues of the MCs Personas. There are also glass cases for each game that show off a single representative scene's script + storyboard. The one for Persona 4 was a scene from the Golden version where the protagonist &gt;!betrays his friends, known among fans as the Accomplice Ending. I was elated to see a scrap of paper labeled \"ADACHI ENDING\" in a glass display case with a no photos sign and a staff member lurking around the corner like it was some famous painting from the Renaissance.!&lt; It was 100% the highlight of my trip. Absolute galaxy brain selection of a scene to represent Persona 4 with.\n* I got fluffy pancakes in Osaka on the day I visited the Persona exhibit because this isn't even from the right game but did someone say delicious pancakes???\n\n**\ud83d\udc2b Bonus Bullshit: Free! \ud83d\udc2b**\n\nThe city of Tottori has [3hr tourist taxi](https://www.torican.jp/feature/kanko_taxi) that costs 3000 yen. You have to choose from their set plans, but at 3000 yen it beats relying on the bus or doing a bunch of individual taxi rides or renting a car. For my taxi tour, I did the Tottori Sand Dunes Course C which takes you to Hakuto Shrine, the sand dunes (or the Sand Museum), and to some spots along the coastal area north of the sand dunes. My Persona bullshit encouraged me to pick the course with Hakuto Shrine - it's rabbit themed and there is an emphasis on love and matchmaking, as the shrine celebrates the legend of the Hare of Inaba.\n\nThe Tottori sand dunes I had visited the day before, but the weather was kind foggy outside (considering I decided to visit this region after replaying P4, seeing it in fog weather was a plus) and on the day of the taxi tour it was sunny. I wanted to ride a camel in the sand dunes, but the camels had had enough with the tourists and quit giving rides by the time I had gotten there - understandable, and timely. A whole army of auntie tourists with bags, sunglasses and hats descended from the chairlifts as I made by way back up. The last thing on the taxi tour was the driver took me to spots along the Uradome coast in Iwami for scenic views of the beaches.\n\nIf you've ever seen the anime Free!, [the first ending that shows Haru walking through the sand with a camel is seemingly inspired by the Tottori sand dunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojPKvzQdo7k) \\- Free! takes place in Iwatobi, which is a fictionalized version of Iwami in the Tottori prefecture. Various scenes in the anime also show the characters walking by spots on the Uradome coastline. While on the train to Kinosaki, I passed by Iwami and saw the school used as a model for the anime.\n\nIf you're interested in scheduling this, try emailing [tottori.taxi@nihonkotsu.jp](mailto:tottori.taxi@nihonkotsu.jp) (English is fine) instead of trying to call the number on the webpage.\n\n**\u26e9 General Tourism Things \u26e9**\n\n* **Masks**: I saw a lot of people in the big cities (Osaka, Tokyo) still masking up. Seemed like less people were wearing them in the sticks.\n* **Japanese Phone #**: I got a Japanese sim card this time from Mobal that gave me a Japanese phone number. I used this to sign up for stuff that requires a Japanese phone number, and also to call restaurants and stuff to see if they were open that day or taking reservations which I found useful. On the downside, it gave my phone the \"panty shot awareness\" noise when I took photos lol.\n* **Cash Money**: A lot of places in Tokyo and Osaka let you pay via credit card or IC card, but my adventures in Shimane and Tottori were like 80% cash only. I saw I think two (2) whole vending machines you could use IC cards at in Tottori. I don't really want to spend time on my vacation wandering around trying to find the best exchange rate on Yen, and \"airport counter currency exchange\" sounds like a rip off with shitty fees included. I have a Charles Schwab account that refunds ATM transactions and has no foreign transaction fee, so I just used that to withdraw my USD as Yen from ATMs. Japan Post offices also have ATMs if convenience stores aren't convenient enough. If you really wanna religiously watch the currency exchange rate to try and get the best rate................ Revolut and Wise let you deposit USD then exchange it into Yen ahead of time on a debit card, Booking and other hotel websites let you pay in Yen ahead of your arrival date, and the JR sites will also charge you in Yen.\n* **Language Barrier**: I can speak very basic Japanese and I'm Eastern Asian, so people there will just speak to me in Japanese but they very quickly figure out I'm a foreigner cause my pronunciation and everything is crap lol. I went to Shimane and Tottori knowing these were the 2 least populated areas in Japan and that I shouldn't expect much English there. My baby-tier Japanese was fine for getting around and visiting restaurants. The struggle came from how, compared to the anonymity of the big city, random people came up and spoke to me multiple times, such as how my encounter with the grandma at Yomotsuhirasaka ended up being 3hr long conversation spoken purely in Japanese.\n\n**\ud83d\ude84 Traveling Around Japan \ud83d\ude84**\n\n* **Booking**: I hate AirBnB. I did all of my bookings through [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and mostly stayed at business hotels since I was by myself.\n* **The Sunrise Izumo**: This was my 2nd time riding the Sunrise - back in November, I took it from Osaka to Tokyo. This time, I took it from Tokyo to Izumo. The idea of \"overnight train\" and \"working public transit\" is a novelty to me since trains aren't a thing where I'm from. If you're interested in taking the sleeper train, [you can book the Sunrise in English on JR West's website](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/). The website does clear your search options after you go back, which is annoying. I bought a berth because I'm bougie.\n* **Regional JR Passes**: I got the [JR West Kansai Wide](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/kansai_wide/) to go from Tottori to Kinosaki to Amanohashidate to Osaka (14k or so in train trips + local trains vs 10k price tag), and the [JR East Tokyo Wide](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/pass/tokyowidepass.html) to visit Ashikaga/Hitachi/Kawaguchiko (I took the Shinkansen to Oyama, so this was probably 20k in trips vs 10k price tag, plus riding the Chuo and Yamanote about Tokyo). Especially now that the 7 day all regions JR pass price is going up, you might want to look at the smaller regional passes. Booked both on the official webpages and could book seats in advance. Very useful for the Fuji Excursion to Kawaguchiko, which only has 3 cars.\n* **Getting to Mt Fuji / Kawaguchiko**: As I mentioned above, I booked the Fuji Excursion. If you can't book a seat on the Excursion, you COULD stand on the Excursion, but it's like a 2 hour long ride. Standing not recommended - you want your legs to be functional by the time you reach Chureito Pagoda. You could take a highway bus from Tokyo, or piece meal the train route - Shinjuku to Otsuki either via the Chuo line (commuter) or the Kaiji line (limited express with assigned seats), then Otsuki to Shimoyoshida (get off here for Chureito Pagoda) or Kawaguchiko (the lake with a nice view of Fuji).\n* **Smart Ex**: I booked my Nozomi ticket from Osaka to Tokyo via [Smart Ex](https://smart-ex.jp/en/lp/app/). If you know your travel plans ahead of time and the regional JR pass doesn't work for you / is too expensive, just buy a shinkansen ticket on Smart Ex. If you buy 21+ days in advance, you qualify for an early bird ticket (Hayatoku) which gives you a decent discount but with the downside that you can't use the ticket on a later unreserved seat if miss your scheduled train.\n\n**\ud83c\udf8c Specific Hotels and Restaurants of Note \ud83c\udf8c**\n\n* [**Ryokan Konansou in Kawaguchiko**](https://konansou.com/): They had a solo visitor stay plan that was only available through their website. Many ryokans are 2 people minimum, so I found it convenient they offered a solo visitor plan with half-board. It wasn't cheap (43k yen), but I had a patio bath and dinner served in my room, and the customer service level was \"personal stalker\". Treat yo self. The public bath also has a nice view of Mt Fuji and has a shallow pool you can kinda lie down in.\n* **Green Rich Hotel**: I stayed at this chain in Matsue and Tottori. Bigger than average business hotel rooms and they had a breakfast buffet that was included with my stay. Both locations also had public baths, but the water was kinda lukewarm.\n* **Hotel Ryumeikan**: This was the hotel I stayed at in Tokyo. I emailed them in advance and they let me ditch my luggage there for the week I went to western Japan. I remained checked in through my Kawaguchiko stay as they had special pricing if you stayed 5 nights in a row and I figured the extra $5 was worth not having to check out. The rooms were also bigger than the average business hotel room. Unfortunately the wifi would randomly cut out. This wasn't that terrible as I only had my phone, but if I had my laptop this would have driven me insane.\n* [**Shungyo Tatsumi**](https://syungyo-tatsumi.jp/): Walked into this place randomly in Tottori. Would recommend for fish. I had some great sashimi then squid tempura, then I asked for sober food cause I was drunk as hell and they recommended their mackerel ochazuke - sure, why not?\n* **European Curry Tomato**: Had to wait like 1.5 hours in line for this. Good curry, you can taste and smell the variety of spices, but I don't know if I would wait 1.5 hours for it again.\n* **Den Kushi Flori**: Was recommend this place. Interesting French fusion if you're into that. My favorite courses were the fried daikon and the vegetable stew with lamb.\n* [**Lamp no Yu**](http://ranpu-no-yu.com/): An onsen. After getting off the Sunrise Izumo, I went here as it was very close to the station. They open at 10am, which is right when the Sunrise arrives. The indoor onsen smelled like trees. Instead of a large outdoor onsen, they had individual sized soaking tubs outside that you could sit in while looking at the trees in the garden. Very chill.\n* [**Cafe Annon**](https://cafe-annon.com/): Fluffy jiggly pancakes. These had a bit of an eggy taste, which I don't usually like, but I really enjoyed these regardless. I didn't add too much syrup. They were already quite sweet with the fruit and cream toppings.\n\n\ud83d\udc08 **Nerd stuff that is not related to Persona**  \ud83d\udc08\n\n* **Kirby Cafe Petit**: You have to book this in advance via a timed entry ticket on Live Pocket. This site allows foreigners to register, so you can try your luck: [https://t.livepocket.jp/t/icj41](https://t.livepocket.jp/t/icj41) Every day at 9am JST, timed entry tickets for later in the day (1pm+) go up. The earlier in the day time slots were all booked up in advance sob. When I went, all of the cakes were already sold out so I bought a car cake keychain as a consolation prize.\n* **Ghibli Museum**: I got a ticket through Lawson's English website. You either get tickets, or you see the Lawson \"Sorry Cat\" image and die trying. You take a nice scenic walk through Inokashira park and get greeted by Totoro's reception area. I enjoyed the museum - there's a short animation that plays every 20mins, there are rooms setup dedicated to the creative process - showing off old cels and paint, drawings, storyboards, etc, and another room devoted to showing off how motion works. One of the displays was definitely trying to emulate \"Miyazaki's desk\", with a plate that had yakisoba pan lol. I think you need an interest in the animation itself to care about the contents of the museum. Cause other than those things, the cat bus play room is for small children only (I'm a large child, may I please ride the cat bus?), the reading / book room also only has children's books, and you're not allowed to take photos inside the building.\n* **Eorzea Cafe**: I had been to the one in Osaka, and this time went to the one in Tokyo with friends who live in Tokyo. I was able to walk into the Osaka one without a reservation, but for the Tokyo one you should definitely reserve: [https://www.tablecheck.com/shops/eorzea-cafe/reserve/](https://www.tablecheck.com/shops/eorzea-cafe/reserve/) I think the best tasting theme cafe I've been to was the Kirby Cafe, but I like ordering the various themed drinks at Eorzea.\n\nI will now proceed to take 2mo to unpack my suitcase.",

The 23rd was a Japanese holiday and I was unsure of what the holidays would do the Izumo occupancy, so I just made it a point to book ASAP. When I rode it that night, the train did seem quite full - the singles near me were full of people who were chatting, and from what I overheard, they were \"regulars\" on the Sunrise, so I might have been competing with both regular riders and holiday riders for the November ticket.\n\nFor my 2nd trip, I booked only 2 weeks in advance, and the train didn't seem very full at all. There was a gang of people in the common area in car 10, but when I was walking through the cars to go to an open bathroom, many rooms still had open doors indicating no occupancy. (Granted, some people could also have gotten on at Yokohama.)",

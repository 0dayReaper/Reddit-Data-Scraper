    "postText": "Just returned from a 2.5 week trip in Japan.\n\nI started in Tokyo, before flying to Kagoshima and making my way back through Kyushu. I was by myself, making friends along the way.\n\n# TOKYO (Kuramae)\n\nTokyo was exciting and overwhelming. I really enjoyed staying in Kuramae on the east side. It was really peaceful at night along the Sumida river.\n\nThe first night I got in, being totally delirious from sleep deprivation, I ran around Asakusa in the dark. With the day trippers gone, I had Senso-Ji almost to myself. \n\nI stayed in a hotel/hostel with a popular, upscale locals bar and cafe on the first floor, which led to a lot of commingling between travelers and locals. (named Nui). Fantastic idea.\n\nI found a few tiny music venues in the neighborhood which were exclusively filled with locals. Me and some new travel buddies I met were welcomed as tourists, and it led to fun interactions with the bands and random Japanese. \n\n- Asaka\u2019s Gold Sounds\n- Pure\u2019s Sound Market\n\nUeno and the area around the national museum definitely deserve a visit, as does Asakusa obviously. But it\u2019ll be busy. Save for a quick trip, I stayed out of Shibuya/ Harajuku which I didn\u2019t enjoy.\n\nThe most interesting day trip was to Fukushima area. I used a legit tour outfit (Real Fukushima) run by the community and was able to go into the exclusion zone area, and make visits to areas that were devastated by the tsunami. We stopped by one of the few combined community center/restaurant/market centers that had reopened since the disaster. It had such a hopeful feel to it after hearing about the problems getting folks to return to the area.Was a great experience overall.\n\nThe food in Tokyo was incredible in general and the 24 hour conbinis and ubiquitous vending machines were awesome for drinks and late night snacks. \n\nOut of all the izakayas I went to, only one server was annoyed to deal with English speakers. The rest were friendly and inviting. Always useful to know a handful of Japanese and get your phone translation ready so you don\u2019t burden them.\n\nBy far the highlight of my time in Tokyo was being able to attend the Kanda Matsuri festival around Akihibara. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it. The mix of ancient and modern, with the mobile shrines being paraded while chanting in front of Akihibara\u2019s high tech backdrop was wild. \n\nIf you get a chance to attend a local traditional festival \u2014 any festival \u2014 do it. \n\n\n# KAGOSHIMA\n\nKagoshima was a cute little city. You won\u2019t need a lot of time in the city itself. The Sengan-en garden was beautiful, as was the ferry and bus around the Sakurajima volcano. I did both in a day.\n\nI stayed in a really cute guesthouse called Hostel Tomal. It was a group of private Japanese style rooms in an old building that had been rescued by a sort of art collective group. The owner was very nice and helpful and spoke English.\n\nAt night, it\u2019s a quick walk up to the observation point which has a great view of the city lights. (If using Google maps, keep going through the parking lot when you reach the top). This is really popular during the day for the view of the volcano over the bay. \n\nThe entire city was surprisingly calm and quiet at night, especially outside the entertainment district. There were very few western tourists walking around, but I did meet a few. \n\nFood highlights: \n- western cafe called \u201cCAFESHOP\u201d. Delicious sausage omelette and croissant after eating Japanese style breakfasts for a week. \n- little curry place called \u201cFriend and Bird\u201d, nice old man running the shop. \n\nIf you are into table top games or just want a fun bar to drink and hangout mostly with locals, there is a place called \u201cNEWGAME BAR\u201d with a flat fee.\n\n# ASO\n\nI made an overnight stop at Mt. Aso, which was a quick express train from Kumamoto. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit, especially if you are spending a lot of time in the cities. It was incredibly peaceful, I just biked around all evening. \n\nThe guesthouse I stayed in was lovely. It was run by a Japanese guy who had worked in California  for a time, so he had all this American memorabilia and a big flag flying which I thought was cute. \n\nThere is also a great \u201cred beef\u201d restaurant there called \u201c\u3042\u304b\u725b\u4e3c\u5c02\u9580\u5e97 \u3054\u3068\u3046\u5c4b\u963f\u8607\u5e97\u201d.\n\n# FUKUOKA\n\nFukuoka was probably my favorite place, and I stayed for 4 nights.\n\nI was in Hakata, at Webase. It\u2019s sort of a cross between an upscale hostel and a hotel. My private room was equivalent to a business hotel, but had the benefit of a shared kitchen, common space and rooftop patio. \n\nWalking around Hakata, Nakasu, Tenjin at night was beautiful and a lively experience. Similar to Tokyo in that way, but more relaxed.\n\nI ended up at a local music festival out at Uminonakamichi Seaside Park over the weekend. I was one of very few western tourists at the show, and this led to meeting some locals which gave me a ride back and took me to dinner. We went to a local izakaya that looked like an abandoned building on the outside (intentionally) and had a secret doorway. They called it the \u201cninja house\u201d which was just a joke I think. (The place was called \u201cChinpunkampun Haruyoshiten\u201d). They did get a chuckle out of making me try to find the hidden door. This experience was easily the highlight of my entire trip. Google voice translate works very well and really makes these experiences possible. \n\nI also took a day trip up to Kitakyushu to see the Sarakurayama Observatory via cable car. It\u2019s a quick trip and definitely worth the detour. Nanzoin was also beautiful to see, but I think I had more fun just stopping at random train stations out that way and walking around.\n\nFood highlights:\n- really cool Izakaya called \u201cTakenoya Kawabata\u201d\n- modern Yakiniku place with great beef that will serve a single person called  \u201cYakinikutokasudon Tatsunosu Nakasukadomis\u201d\n\n\n# HIROSHIMA\n\nI only had a short time in Hiroshima, and did the typical route of the Atomic bomb dome/museum and Miyajima/Mt. Misen. \n\nThe Atomic bomb museum and surrounding area was a very somber and emotional affair, but important to see. \n\nMiyajima and Mt. Misen were as spectacular as everyone says, but be prepared for lots of crowds. I think I most enjoyed the ferry ride over the most. Absolutely beautiful.\n\nOne major food highlight to point out: \n\n\u201cHakushima Brunch\u201d. The most adorable cafe you\u2019ll find in Japan. Run by a lovely older couple who opened it when they retired. They were so happy to see tourists and interact. The French toast was fantastic and very cheap, and they gave me free home made matcha. \n\n# YOKOHAMA\n\nWhen I got back to Tokyo, I headed to Yokohama the night before I flew out. I didn\u2019t have much time to see everything, but the harbor around the Gundam factory was *absolutely stunning* at night. Train ride was worth it just for the view. \n\nAfter two weeks of almost exclusively eating Japanese food, I found an American style BBQ joint (including wagyu brisket!) there which was fantastic. In fact, some of the best BBQ I\u2019ve ever had period. Place is called Midtown BBQ Yokohama. \n\nOverall, I had a wonderful trip. Be polite, greet people in Japanese, don\u2019t fear the trains, get off the beaten path when you can, and get ready to walk like you\u2019ve never walked before.",

Without quickly saying \u201cNihongo wakarimasen\u201d and whipping out Google translate it\u2019d be impossible to talk to most locals.\n\nThe people at the music festival were just sitting next to me and randomly started writing to me with Google translate asking me why/how I was there, etc. They were incredible friendly, and saved me a 2 hour wait for the train back to Hakata.",

City vibe, beautiful nature and traditional japanese onsen etc. You must be very lucky to join a local group to visit an interesting izakaya and came across the local festival in tokyo. I think japanese festival, called matsuri, is really interesting, but if its a famous one, so too many people are there but if its a kind of the one for locals, then people can just feel vibes and enjoy a cool moment. Thanks for a good report!",

I got off at Shibuya station, and that area was enormous and overwhelming. Very tall buildings/complexes, confusing elevated pathways, absolutely crammed sidewalks, etc. I walked up to Harajuku, and the famous Takeshita street was crammed with people, lots of kitschy tourist traps, etc. \n\nI did enjoy the shrine/huge forested park right by Harajuku station. It was a breath of fresh air to escape the crowds.\n\nI think part of my reaction was just from the shock after spending all my time in less busy, more open areas which were also easier to navigate.",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone! Looking for some feedback/last minute check before my upcoming trip to Tokyo for a few days. At this point I've already been in Asia (Taiwan) for almost a month for work and visiting family, so jetlag and such shouldn't be an issue. I've previously visited the Fukuoka area for roughly the same time frame (family hot spring focused trip), and wanted to focus specifically on Tokyo this time around. I'll be flying in with my wife from Taiwan and also hanging out some days with some friends currently in Tokyo for work. I purposely tried to not overpack our itinerary (hopefully) so we have more time to wander around and explore some areas if interested; a mix of 'touristy' activities, food, but also relaxing and just soaking things in...Hoping to get some last min. eyes on if I'm too ambitious anywhere...  \n  \n**FRIDAY 05/26**   \nTPE &gt; Tokyo (Haeneda)   \nDEPART- 8:25 PM / ARRIVE - 12:30 AM  \nPurchase SIM Cards for internet / Rest in airport until subway opens  \n  \n**SATURDAY 05/27**  \nKeikyu Airport Line &gt; Yamanote Line to Shibuya Train station (might change depending on where we go for shopping)  \nLeave luggage in station locker until hotel (sequence Miyashita park) check-in @ 5:00 pm  \nOutlet shopping  \nLunch at Shin Udon in Shibuya  \nExplore/shop Shimokitazawa in the afternoon (subway)  \nEventually pick up luggage from station and make our way to hotel through Miyashita park.  \nDinner   \nDrinks at SG Club @ 7:30 with friends / additional bar hopping afterwards  \n  \n**SUNDAY 05/28**  \n*probably the most packed day?*  \nNezu Shrine / Yanaka (Chiyoda line)  \nSenso-ji/Asakusa (Chiyoda line &gt; Ginza line)  \nLunch around Nakamise Dori Street / stroll along Sumida river  \nWalk/Asakusa line to Tokyo Sky tree  \nAkihabara (subway)  \nDinner  \n  \n**MONDAY 05/29**  \nTsujiki Fish Market \u2013 morning/noon brunch  \nReturn to Shibuya &amp; explore/shop around Shibuya; cat street, maybe take a peek at Harujuku  \nReservations at Shibuya Sky at 4:00-4:20 \u2013 Try to catch sunset, shibuya crossing at night?  \nDinner  \n  \n**TUESDAY 05/30**  \n*Failed to get tickets to Ghibli Museum :( *  \nThinking of a day trip to Kamakura (Beach/bamboo forest/temples) or Yokohama (ramen museum/aquarium)  \n  \n**WEDNESDAY 05/31**  \n*Checkout hotel at 2:00 PM or earlier and keep luggage in station locker*  \nMeiji Jingu Temple  \nYoyogi Park/Shinjuku Garden  \nLunch at Tamawari in Shibuya  \nImperial Palace / Atago Shrine  \nDinner  \n*Head to airport after evening plans (subway?)*  \n  \n**THURSDAY 06/01**  \n5:55 AM flight back to TW!  \n  \n*Dinners will probably be play by ear with my friends after they get off from work and social drinking afterwards so nothing specifically planned in the evenings. Will try to explore Omoide Yokocho/Golden Gai/kabuchiko in Shinjiku a night or two.  \n  \nAny feedback is much appreciated. Could definitely use some advice on which passes to buy for the subway/bus if needed; trying to study the subway lines and my route more this upcoming week. Thank you!",

            "comment": "You seem to pretty much only be visiting Shibuya (+ Shimokitazawa), Shinjuku, and Asakusa? \n\nI'd recommend spending time in some of the less touristy neighborhoods (relatively speaking); Nakameguro/Daikanyama/Ebisu, Koenji, Tomigaya (actually part of Shibuya), Sangenjaya, Kichijoji, so on.\n\nAlso:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Lunch at Shin Udon in Shibuya\n\nYou might want to think about this. While the food here is fantastic, you're likely waiting on line here for 2 hours. On a Saturday, that number may be even higher. There are a ridiculous amount of amazing lunch options in Tokyo. On a 5 day trip, I wouldn't want to spend such a large chunk of time waiting on line for lunch.",

I\u2019m a big fan noodles, which is why I had shin udon and tamawari specifically listed\u2026I might try to get there early(pre opening) and see how the line situation is, if it\u2019s bad I\u2019ll just find another place!",

I went there 2 weeks ago to see the shrine and stumbled on it upon leaving the station. Their sweet potato delicacy has been the best so far that and I have tried many different sweet potato shops in Tokyo. They are very nice too xDD",

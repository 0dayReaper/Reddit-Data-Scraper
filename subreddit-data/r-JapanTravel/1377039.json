    "postText": "Edit: Switched some days around to make it less back and forth. However, I don\u2019t want to go straight from Osaka to Kinosaki (leaving Tokyo portion in between), because I want to be with my family in Tokyo for their last day).\n\nHi everyone! This is my first Reddit post so I\u2019m kinda nervous, but I\u2019ve been following this subreddit for a while and have gotten so much help from it. I (24F) would love some advice on my own itinerary for my first trip to Japan!\n\nSome things to note before:\n* My trip is split into 3 parts:\n    * Days 1-6: Mom (mid-50s) and Brother (20M)\n    * Days 6-9: Solo\n    * Days 9-15: Friend (24F)\n* My family and I are coming from our trip in Korea and I will be continuing my trip in Korea with friend after Japan. (This Japan trip is a break in the middle of my 1.5 months in Korea).\n* There will be a couple repeated activities since both my family and friend want to experience them.\n* All hotels have been booked, but can be cancelled if itinerary changes are needed.\n* I will be getting a JR Pass, but my mom and brother will not.\n* There is a lot of back and forth travel for me, but this was the best I could do to make sure both my family and friend get to do what they want.\n* If eating/restaurants aren\u2019t mentioned, we\u2019ll probably do convenience store or find something as we go.\n* No nightlife with family, yes nightlife with friend\n* Interests:\n    * Me: culture, food, studio ghibli, anime, shopping\n    * Mom: shopping\n    * Brother: culture, anime, food, shopping\n    * Friend: food\n\n\n\n**DAY 1: SUN** *(Family)*\n*SEOUL -&gt; TOKYO (Staying near Shibuya Station)*\n* Arrive @ Narita around 3:30PM\n    * Activate eSIM, suica card, exchange cash\n    * Narita Express / bus to Shibuya Station\n* Shibuya Station (office closes at 6PM, so only if we can make it by then)\n    * JR Pass exchange\n* Shibuya\n    * Shibuya Crossing, Hachiko Statue, One Piece store, Mega Don Quijote, Miyashita Park (GBL store), Shibuya 109, Shibuya Parco (Nintendo store)\n* Dinner @ Ichiran\n\n**DAY 2: MON** *(Family)*\n*TOKYO (Staying near Shibuya Station)*\n* Tsukiji Market\n* Harajuku\n* Shibuya\n    * Anything we didn\u2019t get to the day before\n    * Shibuya Sky (booked)\n* Dinner @ Gyukatsu Motomura\n\n**DAY 3: TUE** *(Family)*\n*TOKYO -&gt; OSAKA (Staying near Dotonbori)*\n* Shinkansen to Osaka\n* Osaka Castle\n    * depending on how early we get to Osaka\n* Amerika-mura\n* Shinsaibashi\n* Dotonbori\n\n**DAY 4: WED** *(Family)*\n*OSAKA -&gt; TOKYO (Staying near Tokyo Station)*\n* Universal Studios\n    * My brother and I are getting the express passes, but my mom is not (she doesnt like rides/rollercoasters so she doesn\u2019t think its worth).

Do you think its doable or is it too much to the point where I won\u2019t enjoy my trip?\n* Any good sushi restaurant recommendations?\n* Am I missing out on anything?\n* Should I drop anything?\n\n\nThank you so so much for reading through and sharing any thoughts you may have!!",

It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me why you would go from Tokyo to Kinosaki, go back to Tokyo, and then go back in the same direction to Osaka and Kyoto. It\u2019s about a 6 hour train ride from Tokyo to Kinosaki\u2026a lot of your day will be gone for the back and forth.\n\nGoing from Tokyo \u2014&gt; Osaka \u2014&gt; Kinosaki \u2014&gt; Kyoto \u2014&gt; Tokyo will break up the travel time in half and make it a lot easier.\n\nDo you have a specific reason that you want to go to Kinosaki? We just came back from there, and while it\u2019s gorgeous, I do think you can find just as beautiful of ryokans and onsens in Kyoto, Hakone, etc without going all the way out there. But of course, I did enjoy Kinosaki a lot.",

I do want to go back to Tokyo with my family when they\u2019re leaving Japan, but I am now planning to go straight from Kinosaki to Kyoto (see my comment above for more details). Kinosaki is the place I am looking forward to the most! I really wanted to go to a place where I could just relax and not really have much to explore. Can you share more about your experience there? How many onsens did you get to? Any recommendations for food/snacks/souvenirs? Really appreciate it!",

Our itinerary was actually this:\n\nTokyo (5 nights) \u2014&gt; Kyoto (3 nights) \u2014&gt; Kinosaki (2 nights) \u2014&gt; Tokyo (1 night) \n\nI know what you mean about being excited to relax in Kinosaki! We were so exhausted from all the walking in Tokyo, it was nice to wind down to a slower pace in Kinosaki. \n\nWe really enjoyed the ryokan we stayed at - Nishimuraya Shogetsutei, and it pretty much had everything we needed. It was our anniversary trip, so we ended up booking 2 private onsens and a massage with the hotel. This meant we only had time for 2 of the public baths - Satono-Yu and Goshono-Yu. The water was a little too hot for us, so we probably stayed at both maybe 30-45 mins each. Initially, we thought we were going to be onsen-hopping all 7 of the baths but we knew quickly that wasn\u2019t feasible. it doesn\u2019t make much sense to just continuously bathe, soak in the onsen, bathe again, put on clothes, walk to another onsen, bathe again\u2026.rinse and repeat 7x \ud83e\udd23 Your skin will turn too wrinkly haha! We just decided to pick the 2 we were most interested in.\n\nThe town itself is super cute but pretty small. You could walk end to end in about 20-30 minutes, and there is a shuttle bus that will take you from the station (right at one end) to your ryokan (ours was on the opposite end of the station). There are small shops along the way, and of course the scenic little stream and bridge that runs through the town. We also did the mini hike/ropeway cable car that takes you up/down Mount Daishi summit. To be honest, we didn\u2019t eat or shop too much around any of the shops. We had food provided at our accommodations and we didn\u2019t have too much time in between our scheduled things. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our time in Kinosaki. We ended up choosing Kinosaki because we heard it was tattoo friendly at all their public baths. It\u2019s got a nice small town feel and we didn\u2019t mind the train ride there and back. We won\u2019t be going back since it\u2019s kind of a \u201cone and done\u201d type of place (and it\u2019s out of the way), but we had an unforgettable ryokan experience.",

It updates in real time, and also shows when each bath is closed. Definitely pay attention to which days and times it is open because they all differ.",

We didnt stay there (stayed at Moriyuza inn and loved it). We went to 3 onsen, Goshonyo, Kounoyu, and Ichinoyu- only stayed &lt;30 min at each (I was with my husband and we didnt want to be separated too long, plus water is quite hot). Enjoyed the different vibes of each but liked Goshonyo the best I think. Lots of cute shops for souvenirs and sweets! You can walk the whole town in like 20 min and it was such a pleasant escape from Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka. We had 2 nights there so ate at ryokan one night and Irori Tajima Beef the second night (really good kobe beef yakiniku dinner)",

Everything was so nice and I only have good words to say about the hotel. The Kaiseki dinner prepared was beautiful and the breakfast was delicious! I highly recommend booking a private onsen if you want to splurge a little. We actually enjoyed that much more than the public ones! It costs ~$70USD but it was so beautiful and luxurious, it was the ultimate serene experience.",

Friend meets you in Kyoto on same day you arrive. I would just stay in Kyoto and do a day trip to Osaka.\n* Go to Tokyo with friend and then depart for Korea",

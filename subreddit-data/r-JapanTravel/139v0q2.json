If you want to save money, I suggest getting a one week pass that will cover your trains from 13-20 so you can get back to Tokyo from Nagasaki. Osaka/Kyoto/Kobe are near enough that you won't really need a bullet train. You won't really need the pass much in Tokyo too and you can just take a plane or an overnight bus from Tokyo to Osaka. Highly recommend their overnight buses.",

            "comment": "1. This itinerary probably justifies buying a 1 week JRail pass, check [this](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/) calculator. Make sure to buy the pass before the upcoming price hike\n2. Remember to factor in extra time for navigating the subway, it isn't easy at bigger stations especially during rush hour. If you need to be somewhere at 2pm, aim for 1.30pm\n3. Teamlab Planets in Tokyo is amazing, consider going to that, book early if you do",

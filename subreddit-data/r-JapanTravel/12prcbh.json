Basically you\u2019re going to Meiji Shrine area, then going to Musashino, then coming back to Meiji Shrine area again.\n\nThe thing is that Yoyogi park has nothing much to explore. It\u2019s a mediocre park, a large one, but mostly aimed at the locals. You can go straight to Meiji shrine and you\u2019ll not miss out.\n\nWhat you should do is visit shibuya area more, since it\u2019s close anyway, visit Omotesando backstreets, not just the Takeshita street which isn\u2019t even that good, visit Nezu museum nearby which is great. Have a walk around Aoyama.",

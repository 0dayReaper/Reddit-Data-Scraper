    "postText": "Hey all,\n\n***Solved: I have to take the earlier train to Tateyama. If it wasn\u2019t Golden Week, I could arrive at 9:19 and change my ticket for a later cable car.*****\n\nJust made a last minute ticket purchase for the 9:20 cable car leaving from Tateyama towards the Alpen Route. The problem is getting from Kanazawa to Tateyama Station to take the 9:20.\n\nDentetsu Toyama to Tateyama - 2 options on Google maps.\n\n7:01\u2014\u2014-8:15\n\n8:07\u2014\u20149:19\n\nI\u2019m coming from Kanazawa, so I\u2019m trying not to leave at 6am to catch the 9:20 cable car out of Tateyama. \n\nBut, if I take the 8:07 from Toyama, that allows only one minute before the departure.\n\nWhat if I miss the 9:20 cable car? Am I out of luck for the whole trip? \n\nThanks..and good luck to all travelers during Golden Week\u2026\n\nEdit-traveling during GW",

They are very strict on cable car times, and they start checking tickets and shepherding you to the marshalling area for the cable car ten minutes before your allocated time. You'll need to take the earlier one unfortunately!\n\nHaving said this, despite no web tickets being available, there were a significant number of walk up tickets available, most of them not until after 10am leaving Tateyama though.",

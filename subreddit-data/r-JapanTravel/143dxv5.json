    "postText": "Hi all, my husband and I are taking a trip to Japan in July. We're bringing our 6-year-old and while he's very well behaved, we want to get a tracker to help locate him if there are any problems.\n\nHowever, all the trackers and watches I've researched don't work outside the US. Jiobit, Tile, Gabb watch, etc. We have Pixel phones so Air Tag isn't an option.\n\nAnyone know a tracker that functions in Japan?",

It's got nothing to do with how well behaved they are/aren't.   The stations are packed at times, with people pushing and shoving trying to get to their destinations.  These stations aren't always avoidable and, especially with a young child who doesn't speak the language, it's ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry.",

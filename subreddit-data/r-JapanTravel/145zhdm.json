You will definitely buy something.\n\nWhy drag a stuffed pokemon or some other things in your backpack/suitcase for 3 weeks when you've got nothing planned on the last two days.\n\nGo do the souvenir hunting at the end!",

Is this worth it???\n\nSeen a few travel blogs who\u2019ve done this day in a number of different ways and can\u2019t decide on what we would enjoy most. \n\nIn Miyajima - appreciating there\u2019s more to the island - top three are Itsukushima Jinja, Diashon &amp; Henjo cave.\n\nAnd in Hiroshima, I think I\u2019ll be satisfied with 2-3 hours at the Peace Park.",

    "postText": "Hello! My wife and I will be traveling to Japan early next year.  My wife's only concern is with eating, and specifically not wanting to offend a restaurant in certain situations. Ill summarize the main issues with bullet points. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* We've heard that it's considered rude at some restaurants not to finish your main course. Often times, she cannot eat large portions of food because it will end in an upset stomach. Sometimes, she will just share a portion of my food, which I've heard is also rude at some places. Even if the food is amazing, she simply cannot eat a lot. \n* She cannot eat spicy foods. How can we tell if the food is spicy. Do we simply ask the staff for more bland options? Ramen would be an AMAZING option for her because it's just noodles and broth, but we would like to avoid with a lot of spice. \n* No Alcohol . We've also heard it's rude at some sit down restaurants to not order a drink with the meal. She primarily has to drink water with her meals. \n* No Raw Foods. (Immune compromised) \n\nWe are currently learning phrases and translations to indicate that she has Crohn's Diseases or \"ulcerative colitis\" and that her diet is restricted. We've traveled to many countries, but Japan feels like it will be a bit more challenging for her regarding food.\n\n What would be the best way to handle this situation where food and drink may be hard to navigate for my wife? We do not want to offend anyone, or cause a scene.Any tips or advice would be extremally helpful, as I want her to be as comfortable as possible during the trip!",

            "comment": "&gt; it's considered rude at some restaurants not to finish your main course\n\nSharing food is considered rude especially at full restaurants because you are occupying two seats but only giving them one revenue and even creating more work (asking for extra plates/cutlery to facilitate sharing, lingering longer, staff serving two cups of tea rather than one). Aside from this, her personal health &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; politeness. You have all the best intentions, are still paying full price, and will never see these people again. Especially as a woman, it's easy to slide by using the \"oh the portion was just so large\" excuse via body language.\n\nIf you are really concerned, avoid mom-and-pop shops and eat at chains / larger outlets where the individual employee clearing the table is not personally related to the owner and did not go to the market to buy ingredients and cook your food.\n\n&gt; spicy foods\n\nNot sure what her tolerance is, but most food is not very heavily seasoned (outside of salt).\n\n&gt; no alcohol\n\nNearly all restaurants will have non-alcoholic drink options (soda etc.) and many serve free tea / water.\n\n&gt; raw foods\n\nAvoid sashimi, don't order salads, and eat around raw stuff if that is okay for her? For example, don't eat the lettuce served with tonkatsu.",

Sushi and raw foods are not a must to eat; my wife hates fish (and sushi) and it's easily avoided. Research your meals ahead of time for what you can/can't eat. Research restaurants, have some planned out restaurants and backup ones incase they are full. Soba and Udon are fairly plain, Shabu Shabu you can control what you eat. Yakitori is by the stick and I don't recall it ever being spicy. There are plenty of ramen places which you can research ahead of time, and most have non-spicy and spicy options. Japanese curry might be a nono for her, but it's not super spicy. \n\nAfter getting UC I never really drank much, and never felt pressured to while in Japan. Most smaller restaurants don't even serve liquor. Higher end restaurants might, but your typical small shop doesn't.\n\nI know you didn't ask about this part, but there are bathrooms (very clean) everywhere. Don't feel worried about that.",

Japan is known for not having really spicy food.\n\nThere\u2019s always an option for an oolong tea or similar, even at bars. No one cares if you\u2019re not drinking alcohol. \n\nJapanese food actually features very little raw food other than sushi and salad. Vegetables are usually cooked or at least pickled. \n\nWhile rude, weird people exist everywhere, it would be extremely odd for someone to cause a scene over your wife not finishing a meal. You will be fine!\n\nETA: I will say that ramen is super oily and heavy. It often upsets my stomach. If you want something less rich, go for soba.",

There are places you can specifically control the spice level as well, coco curry being my first thought\n\n- I also cannot drink alcohol and if I was being judged I couldn't tell. They do have a wider/better selection of juices and mocktail type drinks so I would often order those. Just be aware you don't always get water as a default so may have to ask for it/at some places cold barley tea is the default \n\n- raw foods should be easy enough to avoid. Might be trickier if you want to eat sushi but places usually have at least some sort of noodle dish she could have",

For someone who has a legitimate medical issue I\u2019d almost completely disregard what\u2019s considered rude and what\u2019s not.  Your wife\u2019s health trumps these customs.  If she can\u2019t finish it so be it.  Some restaurants will require two people to get two food items and two drinks but the drink absolutely doesn\u2019t have to be alcohol.  You can just drink her drink in that case or leave it.  Get whatever\u2019s cheapest though. Do not try explaining UC or crohns as you\u2019ll just confuse them.  Go with telling them she has a severe allergy.  When you say \u201cno raw foods\u201d does this include veggies or are you referring to only meat?  \n\nSpicy can be tricky if you don\u2019t know the food well and everyone\u2019s tolerance is different.  Most people have no idea what someone in your wife\u2019s case tolerance is so consider that when ordering.  If you don\u2019t speak a lot of this can be overwhelming I\u2019d imagine. I speak Japanese but sometimes I get so frustrated trying to get info on dishes from staff that I just walk out and go to another place.  FYI, convenience stores generally have bathrooms but not all do.  Certain high traffic areas women\u2019s bathrooms are certain times of the day can be super crowded.",

They usually serve free water / ocha, so buying any drink is not expected.\n\n- You can usually see the portion when you stand outside of the restaurant. They have this fake food display and you get almost 100% what is shown in the fake food (including the portion size).\n\n- Ask for english menu, look for chilli pict or hot sign. Japanese food usually are not spicy.\n\n- Avoid traditional market, such as kuromon, nishiki, tsukiji, etc.\n\n- Use mask and sunscreen :)\n\n- There are few types of ramen, pork broth, miso, and shoyu, shoyu is the lightest (shoyu is soy sauce), then miso, then pork broth.\n\n- Udon and soba also tends to have clear soup, which is also more towards clean side (in term of taste)\n\n- Yoshinoya and sukiya also a good fast food option.\n\n- If she likes curry, coco ichibanya (or just coco) is a good place to eat, 0 level heat, and you can even reduce the amount of rice you want and they will reduce the price!\n\n- My best bet? Convenience store food! You can see what is inside, and if she cannot finish it, you can eat it for later (or throw it away without any guilt). The store also can heat up the food for you (with microwave), so it is gonna be hot (and kill the bacteria). Some onigiri have raw fish in it, so be sure to check it first.",

Japanese doesnt like people who disrespect food, like visiting a restaurant, taking fotos and just leaving without eating. Thats it \ud83d\ude42\n\nSpicy food - as others mentioned, japanese restaurants have very few spicy food options, Korean, chinese and Thailand restaurants in japan have many spicy menues though. Regarding ramen, a few ramen restaurants add chilli powder, for instance, ichiran ramen, so probably you can ask if they have it before to make sure.\n\n\nAlcohol- only at \"izakaya\" restaurants, yes they expect customs to order Alcohol, but its totally okay if your wife order other non alcohol drinks and you order alcohol. Its because most of izakaya earn by selling alcohol and instead they serve foods by cheap price. There are some groups including japanese, who order only one glass of softdrink, which is quiet cheap like 2 usd, by each, and eat foods at Izakaya restaurants. They are often criticized. So its nice if you order some beers while your wife drinks just a glass of soda \ud83d\ude42. Actually I do this do sometimes.

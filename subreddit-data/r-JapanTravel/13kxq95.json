    "postText": "\r  \nI have some good news! My leg has healed a lot. After waiting for 10 days, most of the swelling has gone down, and I can now walk without the need for a cane! My doctor has given me the green light to proceed with the biking trip as long as the pain remains manageable.\r  \n\r  \nI've decided to continue pushing forward, but at a slower pace. Instead of covering 50km per day, I've set my sights on a goal of approximately 30km per day.\r  \n\r  \nDuring my journey, I had the opportunity to visit the captivating city of Fukuoka, although my stay there was brief due to falling behind schedule. Nonetheless, I managed to explore some remarkable sites, including the ancient shrine Kushida, which dates back to the year 700, and the awe-inspiring Nanzoin Statue of Buddha, renowned as one of the largest in the world. People from all corners of the globe flock to this shrine, and I took part in the common practice of rubbing the statue's feet for good luck, as many visiting Buddhists do.\r  \n\r  \nTo conclude my trip, I met up with a friend I had made on Hello Talk, a social language learning app. He kindly took me to savor some rich and flavorful ramen! I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent there, and I am excited to continue this trip!",

That would be harder to do if I decided to get a nice road bike. I don't know too many people so I have limited resources if something happens.",

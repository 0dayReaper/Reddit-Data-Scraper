    "postText": "Hello! I'm (35M) visiting Japan in Mid-June for the first time. I only have 4 nights and 5 days, so I decided to stay only in Tokyo. I booked an Airbnb in Shibuya all 4 nights.\n\nI could use any recommendations for great restaurants, bars, or any events happening in mid-June? Please let me know if my itinerary doesn't make sense, or if you recommend any changes.

            "comment": "\n&gt;What type of public transportation pass should I purchase if I want to visit everything in my itinerary?\n\nNone. It's typically easier to just get an IC card like suica or pasmo. Local transport is cheap enough that a pass like the metro one would at best save you only a few dollars, while imposing some annoying restrictions on what companies you use. \n\nOmoide tokochu, golden gai and Kabukicho are best done in the evening you're in Shinjuku. \n\nToyosu is very nearby Teamlabs Planets. \n\nYou've already got Takeshita St on your Meiji jingu and Harajuku day, which is perfect.",

                            "comment": "Actually just on the topic of Toyosu, what are you going there for? It's a lot more sterile and corporate that the old inner market of Tsukiji so it's not really worth your time unless you want to eat at the restaurants there. If you can't fit it on that particular day, it's no great loss to skip it.\n\nAnd for the day at Akihabara, don't go in the morning. Shops in Japan only start opening at 10-11 am and Akihabara's attractions are 99% shops. Sensoji is a good morning destination because it's open and going early avoids the crowds that gather later in the day.",

I have been to it when it was in Tsukiji some years ago and that was a really cool experience. Saw auction in Toyosu some weeks ago and personally feel it is a waste of time. Sterile and not really any good views anyway. \n\nRegarding day 4 I think it looks reasonable, did something similar a couple of weeks ago and was a good pace. Rearrange the order like someone else wrote. If you are in to ramen, Kikanbo is close to Akihabara and is a personal favourite.",

I wouldn't change much about your itinerary in Tokyo, maybe noting that you'll have very sore legs by the end of your Shibuya day. If you are into cooking, maybe check out Kappabashi? I bought some sweet knives there. Definitely recommend the Hakone loop and also checking out the open air museum and the cafe Paseo - it's owner (Megumi) was also our Airbnb host and was probably the highlight of our trip. If possible, I would recommend you check out Himeji Castle and the adjacent gardens if you can spare the time for it - you can probably skip nijo castle (which felt a bit empty) if you see both Himeji(which felt a lot more authentic) and Osaka (which was more like a museum). Anyway this itinerary seems very reasonable! Enjoy!",

The last time I was there one of them bit me on the butt, whilst another tried to steal my purse. At that moment, all the warning signs they have scattered about (depicting an old lady being knocked over by a deer) started to make perfect sense\u2026\n\nHakone is great. The trees near and around the shrine are pretty magnificent - very old. On one trip we went around the waterfall loop, which i would recommend if you like that sort of thing. And of course you can\u2019t go to Hakone without buying one of their famous volcano eggs! Apparently, eating one extends your life by a further 7 years. \n\nYour itinerary looks pretty full, but if you have the time I would 100% recommend a day trip to Kamakura and Enoshima (taking the enoden). It\u2019s my all time favourite place and I make it a rule to visit every time I\u2019m in Japan. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re going up the Tokyo sky tree you should seriously consider booking a ticket for the planetarium. One of the best dates I\u2019ve ever had. Although, when I brought my friend she ended up sleeping for the entire show, so I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s not for everyone!\n\nOne thing I will also add, as I\u2019m not sure if people ever really mention this is just how much walking you will be doing. Like, a lot. Especially around Tokyo as everything can be accessed by train. So a lot of walking to stations and standing and more walking to attractions. An observation I\u2019ve made is Japanese people don\u2019t have problems walking places, but if there\u2019s an escalator (even for a few steps) they would rather use that than climb them. Bizarre.\n\nSome tasty ramen in Kagurazaka. But you\u2019ll find great places to eat all over Tokyo. It has the highest density of Michelin star restaurants for a reason. \n\nAnyway, I could literally prattle on for hours, boring you to tears. I really hope you both have an amazing time. Truly a beautiful country, one of my favourites and that\u2019s not me being biased because my mother is from there!",

Bring extra shoes, your feet will get soaked or have those shoe covers?\n\nI\u2019d bring waterproof shoes if I could. Less time in the hotel using a blow dryer. Takes a good 20-30 mins on high to get them dry-ish.",

We waited about 10 minutes.\nUeno Park wasn't much to see.\nGet up super early and head to Senso-Ji.  We were there before 8 am and it was worth it to avoid the crowds!",

As we are getting only one week off, so we chose to travel only in Kansai area to get the most out of our trip. Any advice or recommendations are appreciated. \n\n- We are both foodies and looking forward to trying some local food (any recommendations of food we should try?)\n\n- We will be using 3-day Kansai Thru Pass. (It more flexible that JR Kansai pass)\n\n- Our side day-trip are Nara, Himeji, and kobe (using Osaka as a home-based)\n\n- We won't be going to any theme park or tour. And we don't mind missing some tourist spot either.\n\nSo here is our itinerary \n\n11 Jun (Using KT Pass)\nMorning\n- Arrive at KIX 9:15\n- going straight to Kyoto\n\nAfternoon\n- go to Fushimi Inari\n- return to Hotel (stay near Gion area)\n\n12 Jun\nMorning\n- Kiyomizu-Dera, Higashiyama and kept sightseeing-walk north until reach Higashiyama station\n- lunch in (near) Nishiki Market\n\nAfternoon\n- Kinkaku-ji temple\n- return to hotel\n- Goin district in evening \n\n13 Jun (Using KTPass)*\n Day-trip to Arashiyama\n\nAfternoon\n- catching a train to Osaka\n- stay near Tennoji station\n- dinner at Shinsekai \n\n14 Jun\n- Osaka day (Shitenoji temple, Osaka castle, tenma shop area, Shinsaibashi, Dontoburi)\n\n15 Jun (Using KTPass)\nDay trip to Himeji and Kobe\nMorning\n- train to Himeji\n\nAfternoon\n- train to Kobe (Chinatown, habourland, Kobe beef)\n- train back to Osaka\n\n16 Jun\n- Day trip to Nara (nara park, Kofukuji, Todaji, Naramachi etc)\n\n17 Jun\n- Free day, shopping in Osaka (DenDen town, Amerikamura,Fish market)\n\n21:30 - frying back home.\n\n*Questions*\n- On the 13 of June I'm thinking that I would like to change from Arashiyama to some where else that have less tourist.

            "comment": "You are not really getting even on Kansai Thru Pass here except the Himeji day.\n\nFor Jun 11, you can buy the Kyoto Access Ticket for 1250 yen. Then train to Fushimi-Inari cost 220 yen each. That's 1690 yen, a few yen short of 1733 yen (assuming you buy at 5200 yen/ticket).\n\nFor Jun 13: Gion to Tennoji is 700 yen via Hankyu and Osaka Subway. (You can even go cheaper via Keihan and Osaka Loop Line). I doubt you will be spending 1000 yen to Arashiyama, but even if you do, there's Kyoto Bus 1-day pass or Kyoto Bus+Subway One Day Pass.\n\nGoing to Mt.Hiei on Kansai Thru Pass is a terrible idea since it only allow you to ascend on the Biwako side. You will spend a lot of time going to/from there. Other options are Kurama and Kibune, or Ohara. Both have other passes you can use.\n\nFor Jun 15, a one-day JR West Kansai Area Pass is more expensive at 2400 yen, but it's much, much faster than the Kansai Thru Pass route. You are looking at 1 hour with JR, or 1.40 hour with Kansai Thru Pass.",

This is our 2nd time in Japan, but 1st time in Tokyo, covered Osaka and Kyoto in 2019. \n\nLittle background: Husband is a huge anime/gundam fan and of anything japanese (museums/temples and culture). Wife is fan of japanese food only and decided to give in to go to Japan if her TDL and TDS dreams are fulfilled (hahaha!). Tendon recommendations are highly welcome! Any other theme parks around the areas below to fill up time can be suggested too please. \n\nItinerary is not very firmed up and we need advice especially with regards to staying at Yokohama or Shinjuku/Shibuya for the 1st leg in Tokyo.

Not sure how you would cram that many things into one day trip unless you were only looking for quick visits to some of those places. Then again we probably spent an hour at the Snoopy Town near Yokohama station so if there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way :)",

We didn\u2019t have any other goal there (I have two kids under the age of 10, I couldn\u2019t be too ambitious with day planning!)",

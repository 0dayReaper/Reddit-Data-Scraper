People here don't seem to be taking it seriously and are not taking appropriate hygiene measures like washing hands, hand sanitizer and wearing masks if coughing - they're too busy panic buying food and TP as well as generally being selfish a-holes.",

Thank God we didn\u2019t book any tickets because we would be in a huge mess. He was so hesitant about booking tickets not only because of the cost but he was already anticipating for the virus to get bigger (he works at a news station so he knows the scoop). Also I have lupus and would be more susceptible to the virus, and I really don\u2019t want to gamble with my own life and health already. Lupus flares are already bad enough on their own.",

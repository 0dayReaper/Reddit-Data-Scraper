    "postText": "Hi everyone, looking for some advice regarding the expressway pass when renting a car.\n\nLooks like the CEP expressway pass will be a good way to save on tolls around central Japan. The NEXCO website seems to indicate that the CEP can only be purchased from certain Toyota-Rent-a-Car locations (with only 6 in Tokyo and these aren\u2019t very central locations).\n\nI was hoping to pick up the car around Ueno area but I\u2019m concerned that they won\u2019t have CEP add-on options from Ueno? Has anyone picked up a car from a central location in Tokyo with Toyota-Rent-a-Car and been able to add the CEP at pickup? \n\nUnderstand that trains are more convenient but we have a specific route in mind that\u2019s more accessible to drive \ud83d\ude42\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nhttps://hayatabi.c-nexco.co.jp/page/?id=88r/r/",

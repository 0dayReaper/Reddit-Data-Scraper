    "postText": "Hello! My husband and I are experienced travelers in Europe, but finally making our way to a different continent. We have 14 days planned for Japan in the beginning of October and I\u2019ve seen several itineraries, just wanting some recommendations/critique. \n\nDay 1: Tokyo\n\u2022check into hotel\n\u2022Shibuya crosswalk/Starbucks\n\nDay 2: Tokyo\n\u2022Senso-Jo Temple\n\u2022Meiji-jingu Shrine \n\u2022Golden Gai/Memory Kane\n\nDay 3: Tokyo\n\u2022Ghibli Museum (hopefully!)\n\nDay 4: Tokyo\n\u2022Imperial Palace\n\u2022Tsukiji Fish Market\n\u2022Hana-Rikyu Onshi-teien Garden\n\nDay 5: Tokyo/Hakone\n\u2022Onsen\n\nDay 6: Hakone (Kawaguchi Day Trip)\n\u2022Chureito Pagoda\n\u2022Panoramic Ropeway\n\u2022Sengen-Jinja Shrine\n\nDay 7: Hakone/Kanazawa\n\u2022Matsumoto Castle on the way\n\nDay 8: Kanazawa\n\u2022Kenrokuen Gardens\n\u2022Kanazawa Castle\n\u2022Higashi Chaya\n\u2022Samurai Weapon Museum\n\nDay 9:Kanazawa/Kyoto\n\u2022Shirakawago on the way\n\u2022Kiyimizu-dera Temple\n\nDay 10: Kyoto\n\u2022Fushimi Inari Taisha\n\u2022Kinkaku-ji Temple\n\u2022Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\n\u2022Tenryu-ji Temple\n\nDay 11: Kyoto (Nara Day Trip)\n\u2022Todaiji Temple\n\u2022Isuien Japanese Garden\n\u2022Nara Park\n\nDay 12: Kyoto/Hiroshima\n\u2022Hiroshima Memorial Musem\n\u2022Miyajima Island\n\nDay 13: Hiroshima/Osaka\n\u2022Dotonbori Street\n\u2022teamlab Botanical Garden\n\nDay 14: Osaka/Tokyo\n\u2022Fly home\n\nVery rough first draft. I\u2019m having trouble deciding what to do about the Hakone area. Is it best to send our luggage from Tokyo to Kanazawa, then just have day bags for the two days in Hakone? Is it best to stay both nights in Hakone or stay one there and one in Kawaguchi? Not sure how frequent the buses are for the area. \n\nAlso, we\u2019re not 100% sure that we want to keep Hiroshima/Miyajima Island on the list.\n\nAny and all tips welcome! TIA!\n\nEdit: numbered incorrectly, apparently I can\u2019t count!",

            "comment": "Day 2, 3, and 4 are too empty\n\nDay 1: after shibuya, if you have time, you can do harajuku too (and meiji jingu on the way), which then to shinjuku which you can do at night. They are very close to each other that you can even reach it by walking if you don't want the hassle of finding the right train.\n\nDay 2: sensoji and meiji jingu is like 45 mins apart. And it is very close to harajuku (just like few mins away by train from shibuya). So do meiji jingu on day 1 if you can.\n\nSensoji is like early in the morning, and golden gai is like late at night. That is like 12 hours of free time, what do you wanna do? Closest to sensoji is sky tree, they have sky tree observatory deck, and planetarium (check it out). Then to ameyokocho and ended up in akihabara\n\nDay 3: same with day 2, ghibli museum is like few hours of attraction, what do you wanna do next?\n\nDay 4: also very empty, you do tsukiji first early in the morning (like reaching there around 7.30) then to  garden, then to imperial palace, you have like whole noon and night. Closest will be ginza and akihabara, then odaiba (team lab, unko museum, madame tussaude, life sized gundam etc)\n\nDay 5-7: I have no experience in it, so no comment. \n\nIMO, hakone have hakone loop trip if you want to explore, from odawara (buy the 2 days hakone pass at tourist information, open at 8.30, even if you only use it for 1 day it is still cheaper). To hakone ropeway, to sight seeing cruise. Usually it takes around 6 hours to complete.\n\nDay 9: might be possible, but most likely you will not be able to hit everything\n\nDay 11: also very empty, dotonbori can only offer you so much (unless you like shopping and eating). Add more? If you like eating, kuromon ichiba is gold mine for seafood (early in the morning). If not yry shutenkaku and shinsekai. Or den den town if you like anime or gunpla.\n\nMay I add, that in october, if you like horror, you can do universal studio japan halloween horror night. They will retheme some of their attractions to haunted house attractions. And it is included in your entry ticket! Did it in 2019 and it was fantastic, chucky, the ring, vampire, etc.",

I\u2019d read about a new one opening in the fall of this year, but rarely any news.\n\nWith the Hakone line, it\u2019s just a bus loop for on and off around the Fuji area for exploring?\n\nWe do plan on fluffing up our itinerary more with other museums, shops, and markets. Just getting a good base start now in order to try to get hotels lined up.",

                            "comment": "IMO, no need to shortening the tokyo one? why not just delete arashiyama bamboo forest, it is not good (and very crowded). With that, you can save 45 mins trip. Or you can just go very early in the morning like 7 to bamboo forest and I think you can do it all.\n\n\n---\n\nYeah team lab is still open. I think until the end of this year? It was good, the rubber flooring peeled up a bit (expected because so many people use it), but overall it was good go the earliest one so you can get fresh water.\n\n---\n\nNo, hakone loop is using train (yes, use train, don't use bus, not as interesting) to near the top, then go with gondola to owakudani crater, created by mount hakone eruption. It was where they get their hot water for onsen. On clear day, you can see mount fuji from afar. Then another gondola to lake ashinoko where you can use cruise to go across the lake, it has beautiful view. Then go back to odawara station again. \n\nUnless you wanna go to onsen, using train is the recommended method as it is a sight seeing train. It takes longer (45 mins vs 32 mins with bus)) but it is a very interesting ride.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI think Day 6-9 are going to be very hard, exhausting and possibly not even possible,\n\nIf you are staying in Hakone it will take you a minimum of 2 hours one way to get to Kawaguchiko, possibly longer depending on where you are staying.  And this is working under good bus connections, which since they are bus connections can be wonky.  Someone recently said it is almost worth it to go back to Tokyo and then back to Kawaguchiko rather than dinking with the Gotemba transfer.\n\nAgain, depending on where you are staying in Hakone, you have to get back to Tokyo, then either take a train 3 hours directly to Matsumoto or a train to Nagano  and then take a limited express 1 hour to Matsumoto.  No matter what, you then need to do Matsumoto to Nagano and then Nagano onwards to Kanazawa.  \n\nYou can probably get your Kanazawa day to work.\n\nKanazawa to Shirakawa Go is via bus and it takes about 1 hour.\n\n[https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/highwaybus/kanazawa\\_en/#timetable](https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/highwaybus/kanazawa_en/#timetable)\n\nYou need to do the round trip before getting on the once an hour limited express to Kyoto that takes 2.5 hours.  And then you want to go to Kiyomizudera??\n\nThat just sounds so exhausting.\n\nI would skip either Kawaguchiko or Hakone and add a day to the Alps.",

You might even wanna skip kinkakuji unless you're a shrine/temple fan, you only get to see the temple from afar.",

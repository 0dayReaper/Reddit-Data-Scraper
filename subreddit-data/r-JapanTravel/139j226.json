    "postText": "Hello :) I am planning a trip from Fukuoka to Tsushima, ideally Hitakatsu port, with my boyfriend. \n\nHe will go to South Korea afterwards, while I will return back to the main island. Through my google research I only found some bad websites for ticket reservations and some said that there are no longer ferries going from Tsushima to Busan... \n\nis that true? If not, can we also buy tickets to the ferries at the ports on the spot or how could I get some, even from Hakata port to Tsushima?\n\nThank you for your help :)",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I put together a rough itinerary and want to check if it's realistic and ask for recommendations.\n\nWe're the adult types who like to explore, find unique shops (we do like anime &amp; video games), try local eateries, and we also like to take in the history.\n\nWe'll be getting a JR Pass and SUICA card . I'll ask these questions up front, because I couldn't find relevant answers elsewhere:\n\n1. I want to double check if the SUICA will work for buses/trains in each city (Kumamoto, Fukuoka, Mt. Fuji area, and Tokyo)? Or will I need a new one for each location?\n2. Do I tip private car tour drivers? \n3. What are your recommendations for quiet neighborhoods in Tokyo with nearby access to the train stations?\n\nHere's my rough itinerary for 12 days in June.\n\n**Day 1 -- Kyoto**\n\n* Meet super early\n* Drop off luggage at either the train station or the hotel\n   * Home is already booked near Maruyama Park\n* Head to the Bamboo forest\n   * probably skipping the monkey park if it's too far up hill\n\n**Day 2 -- Kyoto**\n\n* River of Sukura tour (?)\n* Nishiki market\n* Hanamikoji street\n\n**Day 3 --  Depart Kyoto &gt; Hiroshima &gt; Kumamoto**\n\n* Kyoto Station &gt; Hiroshima Station (via Shinkansen)\n   * Peace Memorial Park\n* Hiroshima Station &gt; Hakata Station &gt;  Kumamoto Station (via Shinkansen)\n* Kumamoto\n* Dropoff luggage at Kumamoto Castle Hotel\n* Take the train or SANKO BUS to visit\n   * Monkey D. Luffy statue\n   * Chopper statue\n\n**Day 4 -- Kumamoto &gt; Takachiho &gt; Kumamoto &gt; Fukuoka**\n\n* Check out &amp; head to Kumamoto station to store luggage\n   * Meet a private tour driver at 8am\n      * Roadside station asobonosato\n      * Takachiho gorge views\n      * Kunimigaoka &amp; lunch for somen noodles\n      * Amano Iwato Shrine\n      * **Note: I know tipping at restaurants is not common/acceptable, what about tours/drivers? Should I offer them to join us for lunch (the driver won't speak english)? What's the norm in this scenario?**\n* \\~4pm Return to Kumamoto station &gt; travel to Hakata station\n* Arrive in Fukouka\n   * check-in to the hotel, eat, explore a little, and sleep\n\n**Day 5 -- Fukuoka &gt; Odawara &gt; Lake Yamanaka**\n\n* Shinkansen to Odawara then trains to lake yamanaka (?)\n   * &lt;not really sure the most feasible transport to get up to the lake from the shinkansen station&gt;  \n\n   * Get food, check out the views, sleep\n\n**Day 6 Lake Yamanaka/Mt. Fuji area**\n\n* Explore the area\n\n**Day 7 Lake Yamanaka &gt; Tokyo**\n\n* &lt;reverse transport back to Odawara station??&gt;\n* drop off luggage (still looking for a quiet area to stay)\n* Check out Shibuya\n   * Meiji Jingu\n   * Yoyogi park\n* Try to visit Harajuku &gt; Takeshita Street\n\n**Day 8 -- Tokyo**\n\n* Tsukiji Market\n* Ginza\n\n**Day 9 -- Tokyo**\n\n* Shinjuku\n   * Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\n\n**Day 10**\n\n* May take the train to a nearby beach\n   * **Any recommendations for a quick day trip?**\n\n**Day 11**\n\n* Random day we'll try explore more local areas and gather any miscellaneous souvenirs we forgot for people\n\n**Day 12 Tokyo &gt; US**\n\n* Check-out, get breakfast\n* Depart Haneda 5:15pm",

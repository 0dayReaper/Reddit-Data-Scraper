    "postText": "Hello,\n\nMy husband and I (mid-thirties) are traveling to Japan from the US in mid-October. We love food and nature. I enjoy cities but I sometimes feel like I'm checking sites off the box without getting much out of them. Any recommendations for tours, restaurants, bars, or experiences that were particularly memorable?\n\n**Tokyo:**\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Tokyo in the evening. Staying close to Tsukiji fish market. \n\nDay 2: Culinary Backstreets food tour (has anyone done this and can recommend? We were thinking it might be nice to start with a tour to get some tips from a local), Senso-ji temple at night \n\nDay 3: Explore Shibuya (crossing, Meiji shrine) and Roppongi Hills (Traditional Crafts Aoyama Square). Evening in Shinjuku. Karaoke?\n\nDay 4: Day trip to Nikko to hike around Kegon and Ryuzu Waterfalls and Kanmangafuchi Abyss. Some concern about traffic but hoping it will be okay on a weekday. \n\nDay 5: teamLab planets, Tsukiji fish market, Kappabashi street, Akihabara (arcade and walk through Mandarake)\n\n**Izu:**\n\nDay 6 and 7:  Staying 2 nights in a ryokan by Jogasaki  coast. I would love to do the seven waterfall hike but getting there with public transport seems like it would take a lot of time away from enjoying the unique experience of a Ryokan.\n\n**Kyoto:** \n\nDay 8: Travel to Kyoto. Staying in Gion area. Explore Gion in the late afternoon/evening.\n\nDay 9:  Fushimi Inari, Nishiki market, Philosophers path, Silver Pavilion, travel to Osaka in the evening to eat at Dotonbori street \n\nDay 10:  Kibune/Kurama hike (has anyone does this?),  Kiyomizu-dera  \n\nDay 11: Day trip to Nara, visit Nara Park and T\u014ddai-ji \n\nDay 12: ??\n\nDay 13: Fly out of Tokyo in the evening\n\nAny ideas for what to do on day 12? The Fuji Five Lakes area was recommended to us so I'm tempted to spend a night there on our way back to Tokyo. However, we are currently booked to stay in Kyoto on the night of the 12th. \n\nThanks for your input!",

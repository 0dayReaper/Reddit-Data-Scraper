            "comment": "Seems good to me, only a few things I would suggest:\n\n- Picnic on the day you arrive is ambitious, esp seeing you arrive in the afternoon. You likely won't get to your hotel before 4pm.\n- I would remove Nishiki Market because it'll be likely packed by the afternoon when you arrive, it's better in the morning. I suggest planning for something else close to wherever your hotel is (Kyoto travel times are significant and mostly reliant on buses) like a temple or a shotengai.\n- There are a wealth of good temples In Higashiyama if you're in need of extra things to do there. Have a look at Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka too, which has a good Ghibli merch shop. \n- Sens\u014d-ji gets very busy and is better in the morning, you can swap it with Akihabara because many shops don't open until 11. There are some great breakfast places around Asakusa too, and a famous melonpan place near Sens\u014d-ji that opens at 10.\n- Shinjuku is better than Harajuku for food out of sheer size, IMHO.\n- Suggest pairing Meiji Shrine with Harajuku as they're right next to each other. That leaves you some free time on Saturday and Sunday.\n- One more suggestion - as an alternative on day 9 to the Imperial Palace (which IMHO is not quite as nice as the name) you could take the Yurikamome train from Planets, over the Rainbow Bridge, to Hamarikyu Garden just across the bay.",

            "comment": "Everything up until day 7 looks good to me, some comments on the days from day 7.\n\nday 7: Meiji Shrine should be combined with Harajuku as they are next to each other. Would be a waste to travel there twice.  After Harajuku you could go back to Shibuya, but since you have still about half a day to fill, why not visit Shinjuku and the garden on this day? That leaves day 8 open to explore the east side of Tokyo better. Since your hotel is in Shibuya I feel like you don't have to make it a prominent destination on your itinerary since you will be walking around there a lot anyway.\n\nday 8: you can use this day to visit Asakusa (including senso-ji) and perhaps Ueno. I recently went to Ueno park after long time and it really is worth going there too, for there are lots of sight inside and around the park. You could probably even fit Sky Tree in on this day if you're ambitious.\n\nday 9: no comments here, looks alright.\n\nday 10: Now that sensoji and sky tree were moved to day 8, day 10 becomes more manageable. The sumo tournament can take as short or as long as you want, but if you want to see the top guys brawl you have to be there between 15.00 and 17.00 at least. You could explore the Shibuya night life some more on this day or do some last day souvenir shopping.",

                            "comment": "On a tournament day all the divisions will come into action, the lowest divisions starting from early morning up until the Juryo and Makuuchi divisions later in the afternoon. The last two divisions are the only pro divisions.\n\nAlso, during the morning it tends to be very quiet in the stadium. Which is bad for the atmosphere but good if you want to browse around the area more freely. So going in the morning can actually be a good idea if you just want to soak up the sumo atmosphere. You can also get lunch at a restaurant that serves the chanko nabe, the stew that sumo wrestlers are famous for eating a lot.\n\nIf you want to see the top players in action, you will have to be in the stadium after lunchtime. The stadium fills up during the final hours. Before covid the atmosphere was really good, people would cheer on their favorite wrestlers and stuff, but now people tend to keep quiet and just applaud.\n\nThe matchday finishes at 17.00. The highest ranked players always perform last so if you want to see the Ozeki and Yokozuna wrestlers fight you have to stay until the end.",

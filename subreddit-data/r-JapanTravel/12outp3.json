            "comment": "Your itinerary looks busy, but doable in my opinion. \n\nOdaiba is really nice, pretty modern, but I would skip Joypolis to be honest, we went 2 weeks ago and it was very crowded and most of the experiences had more than 60 minute lines, and honestly did not find those attractions to be worth it. Walking around Odaiba, going to DiverCity and seeing the big statue and then walking to the Decks was something we really enjoyed, specially if dark outside.\n\nShibuya Nintendo and Pokemon Center are extremely crowded, so would recommend going early to try to prevent big crowds. Found the Pokemon Center at Sky Tree to be less crowded\n\nFor Disney Sea, while everything seems to point at their Free Fastpass system working, it currently does not. We went last week at currently they have this disabled, they currently only allow the PremierPass which is a paid option per ride.\n\nFor Universal, I would encourage you to get the Express Pass. That was the only way we could fit most of the park in one day. Wait times hover around 50-70 minutes per attraction. Also, they open earlier than advertised. We stayed at the front hotel and saw people lining up at around 5:30 am in the morning. They let us in at around 7 in the morning",

I appreciate all of your advice so much! Shame the fast pass system doesn\u2019t work!",

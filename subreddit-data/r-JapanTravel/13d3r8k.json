    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone! I was hoping to possibly get some feedback from the community on my itinerary for my 7 day trip to Tokyo this July. Thanks in advance to anyone able to offer their advice or expertise!\n\nSome notes/questions to begin with:\n\n* I\u2019m not attached to any particular day for each activity besides Disneyland on July 10 since our hotel is right beside it and on the way from Narita airport. Everything else can be moved from one day to another.\n* A lot of you have mentioned that shipping baggage from one hotel to another is pretty good. Do hotels do this individually or is there a 3rd party company that you might recommend that's good?\n* At the end of the trip, I will be taking a shinkansen to Kyoto. Is it worthwhile given my Tokyo itinerary to get a 1 week JR pass for Tokyo for this? Once I'm in Kyoto, all of my accommodations and travel are taken care of, so I just need to get me and my things to the city in one piece.\n* Do you have any recommendations for the places I visit in terms of things I will need to book in advance (unless already noted), activities I should remove, activities I should add, etc?\n* I\u2019m travelling with my father. We\u2019re both able bodied and able to handle lots of walking.\n* I can still change my hotel bookings if they are in terrible spots, but I thought they were good options and they're affordable.\n\n**Tokyo Trip: July 9 (Sunday) - July 15 (Saturday)**\n\nSunday, July 9\n\n* Arrive in Narita Airport @ 4:30 pm\n* Travel to Tokyo Bay Maihama Hotel for 1 night\n\nMonday, July 10 - Disneyland\n\n* Tokyo Disneyland all day\n* Travel to new hotel Keihan Tokyo Yotsuya in the evening for 6 nights in Shinjuku\n   * Any recommendations on sending luggage before I leave for Disneyland to my next hotel or should I just travel with it in the evening?\n\nTuesday, July 11 - Yokohama Day Trip\n\n* Gundam Dock\n* Sankeien Garden\n* Cupnoodles Museum\n* Gundam Base Tokyo Odaiba **OR** Meguro River Illumination in the evening\n\nWednesday, July 12 - Mt. Fuji Day Trip\n\n* Mt. Fuji (still looking into travel options)\n* Chureito Pagoda\n* Kawaguchiko Ropeway\n\nThursday, July 13 - Shibuya &amp; Shinjuku\n\n* Shibuya Sky (I\u2019m told the sunset is a beautiful time to book this at)\n* Nintendo Tokyo\n* Shinjuku Gyoen\n\nFriday, July 14 - Akihabara &amp; Other One Offs\n\n* Senso-ji\n* Pokemon Cafe (I know to book this well in advance)\n* Akihabara (shopping, browsing, etc.)\n\nSaturday, July 15 - Free Day\n\n* Maybe some things in Harajuku?\n* Any recommendations?\n\nSunday, July 16\n\n* Leave Tokyo for Kyoto via Shinkansen\n   * Either book for oversized luggage or ship my things to Kyoto. Any recommendations?\n* I begin Kyoto JaLS (language school) on Monday, July 17, so I will be heading to my apartment on this day\n\nThank you so much!",

Do hotels do this individually or is there a 3rd party company that you might recommend that's good?\n\nGenerally the hotel you stay at has arrangements with the delivery companies and will help you arrange the delivery, but often it's only one or two companies so you don't have a choice.\n\nTbh I'd you're able bodied and not moving during rush hour, taking your luggage with you isn't a big deal. I do see many tourist struggle with their luggage, but it's very clear they have over packed. Even with a child in tow, I've taken my own luggage plenty of times without issue.\n\nAs for the JR pass, your trip doesn't really look worth it. If I'm reading this correctly you're only doing a one way trip then staying in Kyoto for the medium to long term. A 7 day pass will be double the cost of just buying a regular ticket. The fact that you're going around Tokyo beforehand doesn't matter; local travel is so cheap that it doesn't factor into the JR pass calculation. Depending on what visa you are travelling on, you might not even have the option to use the pass (it's only available if you are a tourist, not a student or working visa)",

It's easy enough to bring your bags with you if just going from one hotel to another in Tokyo.\n\nWednesday, July 12 - Mt. Fuji Day Trip - my only suggestion is to be flexible with the day and go on the first clear day.",

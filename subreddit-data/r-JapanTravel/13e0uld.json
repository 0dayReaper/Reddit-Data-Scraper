    "postText": "**Big question:**\n\nI need to go from Shinjuku Station to Iwafune Station on Saturday June 10, making it to Mt. Iwafune Cliff Stage by 9:30. I've tried using Google Maps and Navitime but still have questions.\n\n\n- Do these transfers look feasible for someone that has never been in those stations before?\n- Do any of these transfers not accept or require a separate purchased ticket from an IC card?\n- If yes, can any of them be pre-booked?\n- If any of these transfers are missed, when would the next trains be - could I still make it on time?\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/bxt8Lk61aZQ7PEwb7\n\nRoutes 1 and 2 look promising: https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/route/result?start=00004254&amp;goal=00001412&amp;start_name=Shinjuku&amp;goal_name=Iwafune&amp;date_time=2023-06-10T08%3A30&amp;search_time_mode=goal-time\n\nIf the transfers are too much, there are much more direct lines but they arrive much later. A taxi may be able to cut out a few minutes to get us there on time.\n\n- Iwafune station looks pretty small. Are there taxies there at 9:20am Saturdays?\n- Could I prebook a taxi to be there?\n- It would be much more expensive, but what about the availability of taxies at Oyama station or Tochigi station?\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/bQbkVGskP9ktos926\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/8DEkaNcKii85FfmK6\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Smaller questions:**\n\n- For 10amish on a Saturday (June 3), would reserving Kaiyukan Aquarium tickets in advance be recommended? I am hoping to not wait in line too long to try and make the Ocean tank feeding at 10:30.\nIf we do reserve but get lost in transit, and don't make it there during our 15 minute time slot, would they still let us in a little later?\n\n- I would like to visit just one Pok\u00e9mon center. I am less interested in plushies and more interested in... I dunno, knickknacks? Accessories or house items with Pok\u00e9mon on them. I have a special interest in Vulpix and Sylveon. Is there a particular Pok\u00e9mon center that is better for that stuff in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka?\n\n- If there's any glaring issues with the itinerary let me know\n\n\n#Itinerary (June):\nWe aren't very active so I've tried to keep our must-dos low. We will be packing portable chairs and good shoes!\n\nOptional items will be done based on how much time we have and how we feel.

            "comment": "Regarding transit: the transfers should be fine. None of those stations are huge, just pay attention to what platform you need to be on. They all take IC so you don\u2019t need to buy a separate ticket or anything. You can view the train schedule on google maps. [Under the train line name there\u2019s a drop down menu for \u201calso at\u201d.](https://imgur.com/a/neALWTv) Expand that menu and you can see when the next train would be. As long as there\u2019s no delay the schedule is exact.\n\nRegarding your itinerary: \n\n- If you want to go to Yokohama that first day I\u2019d recommend just getting a hotel in Yokohama instead of staying in Shinjuku. \n\n- In my experience at least the Pok\u00e9mon centers don\u2019t have loads of home stuff. They\u2019re aimed more at kids. If I were going to go to any I\u2019d say go to the one Yokohama since you\u2019ll be out there anyways and it\u2019s less crowded than the ones in Tokyo.\n\n- Is there a reason you\u2019re staying in Nara and not Kyoto? You\u2019ll have to go back to Kyoto to take the train to Hakone anyways, so it just seems easier to stay in Kyoto and do a day trip to Nara instead. It\u2019s 48 min - 1 hour one way between Nara and Kyoto.\n\nOtherwise your itinerary seems fine, just be careful about how much time you\u2019re spending on transit.",

Thank you so much for the info on the stations / transit.\n\nI totally hadn't realized that my itinerary had shifted so that all we are doing is Yokohama before going to Kansai. A hotel in Yokohama does make a lot of sense! And I had not been looking forward to Shinjuku station on our first day too haha, so that fixes that.\n\nI am staying in Nara just because I want to. I want to sleep there and wake up there and spend my rest day there. Nara is the thing I am most excited for on this trip, so I want to spend any extra time possible there : )\n\nThanks so much for the helpful comment!",

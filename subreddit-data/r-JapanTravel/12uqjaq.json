    "postText": "I'm curious about [this experience in Maikoya in Kyoto](https://mai-ko.com/tour/katana-knife-sword-making-in-kyoto-workshop/).  It's pricey but I'd really like to do something like this.  Has anyone heard of or tried this experience or visited this place?  They offer a Samurai and Ninja museum and other experiences, including Samurai, Ninja, Tea Ceremony, etc.  Those all seem to have reviews and positive ones at that, but nothing can be found about this forging experience.  \n\n\nI've connected with them because of that coupon for 10% off, which didn't work when I went to the cart.  I sent a screen cap and they said the coupon didn't work because the price was already discounted that's why it didn't work.  Sent another screencap showing it was still the original price. Anyway, I'm going back and forth with them and it's got me thinking twice about booking the experience, if this is the level of service I'm to expect.  I might be reading too much into but...",

But the way they did it; in the original note, they said it was a great value  at the original price and then later as I went through the screencaps etc, they said if budget was a concern that this was expensive for a small dagger.  Seems to be an interesting equivocation depending on their aim.",

It's really just poor website management. They should just tell you that the coupon doesn't work with that experience though. Up to you if you want to go ahead and book but for any type of forging classes you're easily looking at about $300 for something small like a knife. $300usd (43300jpy) for a katana experience is a steal tbh. Just saying.",

But I as I commented to the other reply, the manner in which they communicated was a touch off-putting.  Having slept on it now though, I'm less bothered.  \n\nI have found that the Katana forging experiences in Tokyo are definitely more expensive and you don't walk away with anything.  Have you been to anything like this?  Any others you might have seen and could point me to?",

Make sure to read it through very thorough before deciding. If I remember correctly you kinda sorta need a car to get there. that was something I found hard to make happen for myself",

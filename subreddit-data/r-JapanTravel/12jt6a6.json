    "postText": " \n\n**Working on travel details for our first timers 18 day August/Sept Japan trip and hoping for a bit of input from you all. Planning on JR pass to get around with supplemental local trains. We are in our 60s and don't need to do/see everything. Just want to cover as much as possible. DOES THIS SEEM REASONABLE? We are of the mindset to see less each place we visit, but see as many areas as possible.**\n\n**Day 1,2,3 TOKYO**\\&gt;&gt;&gt;We arrive at Haneda at 4:30AM and plan 3 nights in Tokyo...1st day light sightseeing in Shinjuku-golden gai,gyoen NP, Shibuya-crossing,Meiji shrine and Harajuko-Takeshita St. Sleep in Shinjuku. \n\n2nd day Minato-(Tko tower,Obaiba) Chiyoda-(Akihabara,Imperial palace,Yasukuni shrine) and Chuo-Fish market...maybe Kabuki-za theater).\n\nDay 3 day trip to **Nikko** and evening around Asakusa(Senso-ji temple and Asakusa shrine if accessible evenings) and Ueno(skytree tower). Don't LOVE huge cities so this should be enough Tokyo. Also have a day at the end for additional TKO sightseing.\n\nDay 4 train **Tokyo to Yokohama**...spend a few hours leaving bags at station...then on to **Kamakura**. Yokohama sights we are considering-Chinatown,Sankein garden,which is better....Ramen museum or Cup O Noodles?  Kamakura sights-Great Buddha, Hase-dera, Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, Kenchoji temple\n\nHotel Kamakura\n\nDay 5 am more time in Kamakura then on to **Hakone**. Overnight Hakone in an onsen. Hoping to chill and soak here...I know August is HOT!\n\nDay 6 am Hakone then train to **Osaka** with an optional stop in Nagoya(is it worthwhile?) We may try to see the castle and Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya if lockers are available at the train station. If it isn't worth a stop, we will go straight to Osaka and wander around that first eve. If we stop in Nagoya, I feel like our time just to see Osaka might be too short.\n\nDay 6,7,8 **Osaka with day trips**. day trip #1 to Hiroshima and Miyajima-Peace memorial, Atomic Bomb dome,museum and castle AND if it is possible to do both in a day trip we will do Miyajima-deer park, Itsukushima shrine and the great views. \n\nday trip#2 to Kurashiki-Bikan,Okayama-Korakwen garden for a picnic lunch, and Himeji in the evening to see the castle and maybe the Kokoen gardens....sleep in Osaka and do eve sights there. Is it possible to make these 3 stops in one day trip?  Really hoping to see Geisha in the evenings.\n\nDay 9 **Osaka to Koyasan**....overnight Koya temple\n\nDay 10 am **Koya, train to Kyoto**. evening wandering Kyoto with no specific agenda. I expect that Kyoto will be our favorite place, as so many other tourists have said, so I planned 5 nights here\n\nDay 10-14 sleep Kyoto with day trips. 1. Nara-deer park, Kofuji temple, Todaiji temple\n\n 2. Arashiyama bamboo forest and Arashiyama district and lots of time in Kyoto that evening.\n\n3. possible day trip Shirakawago if it isn't too far. I saw the Hida folk village as an alternative. Is it as remarkable?\n\nWe have 5 nights in Kyoto and plan to have adequate time to see the sights. Does anyone have a particular experience they loved and recommend? Like a cooking class, tea ceremony??? Something special to remember. My husband would love that.\n\n**THE LAST 3 DAYS IS WHERE I AM STRUGGLING...I have seen many recommendations to do 1 night in Kanazawa and 1 in Takayama**\n\nDay 15 **Kyoto to Kanazawa- top sights include castle, old townand the Omicho market**, possible half day to Shirakawago if didn't do trip from Kyoto..also saw Hida no sato is closer and may be as good?   .Sleep Kanazawa\n\nDay 16 finish **Kanazawa, train to Takayama.** sightsee choices include the open air market and Sanmachi historical houses. Love the idea of seeing old town. overnight Takayama\n\nDay 17 finish Takayama and train via Toyama back to Tokyo. Can we take JR direct from Takyama to Tokyo or do we have to go through Toyama? Planning to get a hotel closer to the Haneda airport but have all the final day to see more of TKO\n\nDay 18 Tko final sights. fly home at 11pm so we have the entire day",

            "comment": "TLDR: **I consider your plans extremely exhausting, almost physically impossible.** I sincerely recommend getting intimately acquainted with [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/) and Google Maps. Really, really acquainted.\n\nDay 3: while day tripping Nikko, seeing Skytree in the evening and Senso-ji either at dawn or at night is technically doable - it is a very, very exhausting plan.\n\nDay 4 is physically undoable. Generally I would consider doing either Kamakura or Yokohama (and doing Cup Noodles Museum, Chinatown and Sankeien on a single day would be exhausting), or doing Kamakura and Chinatown only in the evening, though Kamakura is usually better combined with Enoshima.\n\nHiroshima day-trip: it's impossible to climb Mt. Misen, do Itsukushima-jinja and do Peace Park and Hiroshima-jo on a single day. Especially not as a day trip. Also there is no deer park in Miyajima (just deers).\n\nOkayama/Himeji day trip: it's physically impossible to do Kurashiki, Okayama and Himeji in that order. Himeji-jo with Koko-en in the morning, Korakuen in the early afternoon and Kurashiki's canal district in the evening might be doable, however, again, this is a legbreaker itinerary.\n\nShirakawa-go or Hida Folk Village would be absurd day trips from Kyoto (especially since the former is between Kanazawa and Takayama, and the latter in Takayama).",

            "comment": "The biggest piece of advice I have for you would be to make sure you **STAY AT EACH HOTEL FOR A MINIMUM OF 2 NIGHTS**.  Having to check in one night and then move to a new hotel the next day compounds your exhaustion.\n\nAlso, during your time of year I would particularly recommend checking out Hokkaido.  I went in March/April and I started out there.  4 nights at Niseko (3 days skiing), 2 days Noboribetsu (hot spring village), 1 day Hakodate (wish I stayed longer).  The food in Hokkaido is significantly better than the food in the big cities.  It's also absurdly beautiful and you get bigger hotel rooms for less money.  May not be your speed considering your proposed itinerary, but it was my favorite part of a 25 day trip so I would be remiss to not suggest it.\n\nFrom your plans it looks like you are trying to do some crazy sightseeing.  This is now just my personal recommendation, but you should try to chill and just enjoy the food and try to take in what you do get to see.  I moved around Tokyo a lot during the 5 days I was there (15 miles a day of walking) and I was fucking exhausted when I went to Kyoto afterwards.\n\nMy personal recommendations for food: Unagi in both Kyoto and Tokyo (go to Yashima in Taito City before you hit the Skytree, I went there twice and it was amazing).  Other than that, lots of live catch seafood (Botan ebi sashimi, etc.) stuff that is still alive before they prepare it for you.  Obviously the Wagyu is amazing but I would recommend eating food that you absolutely cannot get in the United States.",

It allows you to make your own custom maps with your own places of interest.\n\nI've found this to be helpful while doing my own planning because it's easier to see the location of all the places you are interested in and gives you a better idea of the proximity of them. This may be helpful if your itinerary seems full.\n\nI imagine it'll also be helpful to refer back to when you are actually in Japan too.",

About 1/3 of your time seems like you're in trains , checking in/out, packing up, or trying to figure out how to get to the next place.  Please remember english is still not a secondary language in Japan.  I give myself at least 45-60 min before purchasing a train ticket and finding the right platform.  \n\nI'm not sure what the appeal is in doing day trips from major city destinations when you have only spent one day there (for example Kyoto).  You have 5 nights in the former capital, there are many distinct differences between different regions in Japan and that can only be taken in by spending time there and relaxing a bit.  Remember - it's also vacation!  You're supposed to have fun and let the mind/body wander sometimes.",

    "postText": "(7/20-8/10) Tokyo - Hakone - Nagoya - Osaka (Nara/Kobe) - Kyoto - Hiroshima - Okinawa - Tokyo\n\nThe above is our finalized route.  We are hoping to do lots of food adventuring and checking out some fairly mainstream tourist attractions. Is the below itinerary well spaced out and will it give us a lot of flexibility to explore and rest in between? We know July/August are the hottest and most humid months so we want plenty of wiggle room to rest if needed.\n\nLooking for help with:\n\n1. Anywhere we can hike to see bodies of water and/or waterfalls. I love to swim and it would be really cool to be able to take a splash near some awesome falls. Or any really beautiful beaches!\n2.

These are without accounting for advanced purchase discounts such as Hayatoku 21. Since you are staying in Shinjuku it makes sense to use Odakyu for Tokyo-Hakone.\n\nIf you swap the order of Osaka and Kyoto it can be even cheaper because the Sanyo Shinkansen one way ticket via Klook is 7500 yen for Shin Osaka to Hiroshima.\n\nChances are you won't see Mt Fuji (covered by clouds) in summer - think of it as a bonus if it happens but don't be disappointed if it doesn't.",

Also, all green class seats are reserved so wouldn't it technically be less flexible than buying unreserved seats in regular class and just going 10 minutes early for the unreserved train cars...",

I cant say its \"fun\", but it is an experience\n\nyour arashiyama day in kyoto is very light. explore more of the area there, it can be very rewarding. \n\nI think a travel (for expensive trips) and health insurance are ALWAYS wise. its a very little fee that you will hate yourself not taking if you needed it, and can forgive yourself very easy to not have needed it but still paid for it...",

We took it when we did our day trip to  Miyajima and then you don't need to change trains.  We got to Hiroshima around 10ish and just made the train to Miyajima-guchi and go onto Miyajima by 11.  But I would assume you will be a little later since you want to deal with luggage.\n\n  Kyoto city is inland and has no beaches.  You could go over to Shiga-ken and see if there are any beaches on Lake Biwa.\n\nThere are a lot of beaches in northern Kyoto prefecture, but they're a good 2+ hours away and you might want to consider a rental car if they are your goal just because they are several kms from a lot of the stations with the exception of Amanohashidate (though I am not sure that is a beach for going into the water.)",

We are not normally morning people, but we are in Japan because of jet lag lol Taking a direct was much easier, though we had to change in Shin-Osaka coming back.\n\nYes, there are multiple trains an hour between Hiroshima and Miyajima-guchi.  At the time I was using Hyperdia, and they didn't think we would make the transfer we did make, but our seats were in the perfect car and we made like a 1 or 2 minute transfer lol  I want to say the train is like every 20 or so minutes.  For us, this was a huge bonus because we were day tripping from Kyoto, and we still had to get back to Kyoto in the evening.  For you, it is less of a big deal since you just have to end in Hiroshima.\n\nI want to say we were on the island from 11-3ish.  We didn't see everything but we did go up Mt. Misen.  I was also with my then 6 year old, so that sort of controls how long you spend doing things.  We spent a lot of time sitting in shade and eating cookies lol  We were there for low tide, which she also loved because she walked to the tori gate and looked for crabs.  It was late June, so it was quite hot and humid.  \n\nThere is a direct boat from Hiroshima to Miyajima, but it's not covered by a rail pass, so I've never done it.  It also supposedly is a bit rockier than the very short ferry from Miyajima-guchi.  The train and ferry are covered from Miyajima-guchi so long as you get on the JR Ferry.  It runs fairly frequently, again around every 15-20 minutes.  It's all super easy.  Miyajima-guchi has a ton of touristy shops selling souvenirs like pottery and it is easy getting to the ferries.",

    "postText": "Here are some things that I wish I had known before I came, that I think can really make your trip the best it can be!\n\n* When taking the subway to a location, use Google maps to identify the closest station exit to it and then use the internal station signs to find it and exit out that specific exit. For big stations especially, if you take the wrong exit, you may have to walk all the way around the station again, which is very slow!\n\n* Japan is a maze. If you are looking for something specific (such as a restaurant) just following Google maps won't always get you there. Often you will find they are hidden within a building or underground. Give yourself  LOTS of time to find it.\n\n* If you are still lost, look at reviews. The reviews in Google maps often give clues (such as that it's inside the ticket area of a station, or that it's underground etc). \n\n* The subways are also a maze. The different train lines from different companies often aren't in the same building. They are sometimes connected underground, follow the signs to them of they are, but they often aren't. In Google maps, I recommend selecting a route that has all of the train connections on the same line if possible, even if this adds 5-10 minutes to your trip, so that you don't have to spend time finding a new station.\n\n* The convenience stores usually don't have seats to sit on to eat unlike Korea. Plan to eat at parks.\n\n* Not all parks have seats, or much seating to go around. Some parks have leaning posts instead!\n\n* We have never been able to check in earlier than our hotel check in time, not even five minutes earlier (true story) but we have been able to drop our bags just fine!\n\n* Get to the station with LOTS of time if you need to use a ticket machine or need to line up to buy a ticket. The lines to use these can be HUGE. Sometimes you get lucky and it's empty. But usually, they are huge lines, and they don't move fast. \n\n* Check if the train you are about to board is a \"local\" train or a \"rapid\" train. The local trains stop at all stops and the rapid trains skip stops. This is great if you want to go somewhere quicker, but bad if your station is one of the missed stops (this has happened to us!). \n\n* The train to Disney gets extremely crowded. And then everyone lines up for the opening of the park, and the lines are huge and take a long time to move. You really want to aim to be there 1 hour earlier or more if you want to hit rope drop, and ideally, you want to be staying out that way in a hotel on the monorail loop.\n\n* Shibuya and Shinjuku are loud and extremely busy. We stayed out in Tokyo Station area and it was perfect for us! So lovely and peaceful with plenty of options to eat around us. Even though Shinjuku and Shibuya are the areas everyone recommends, you may prefer a different area after all.",

But I feel this comes with a comfort level of understanding how it works. \n\nAlso MOST importantly I feel that many people do give themselves enough time, because they are trying to cram \"everything they can\" in. It would be like coming to America and trying to squeeze NYC, Philadelphia, &amp; Washington DC; look you can \"technically\" squeeze these 3 in, but you are going to miss A LOT in each City. \nThankfully Japan's Bullet Trains make this a much easier task to go from city one to another. \n\nBest piece of \"General Advice\" I can give is schedule one or two \"Must Do's\" for the Day, and try to clump most of your travel and eating in that area you are already in. There are so many cool things to see by simply exploring that you'll feel accomplished by doing you small checklist, but serendipity will take over and Japan is a great place for that to happen.",

You could get some in the airport, if you feel like you need some. \n\nOnce you are out and about, the easiest way for international travelers to get cash from your home ATM or credit card is to go to a 7-Eleven. You'll usually see two different ATM machines, One is Japan only, the other (usually) will process international cards.   My first day in Tokyo (prior to the pandemic), I wandered around downtown for hours looking for an ATM that would take my N. American ATM card. 7-eleven in Japan is a little different than 7-Eleven in N. America. Yes, it is still a convenience store, but it's also a place where you can do a lot of electronic bill pay and simple banking, (sort of like the Post office in many countries in Europe). 7-Eleven was most consistently the place where I could draw cash from my USA based bank. The Japan based banks don't, generally, have their ATM systems connected to networks outside of Japan.\n\nThe Suica  cards that a few have mentioned are simple cash cards. You can top them up  them at 7-Elevens and many of the larger train stations, as well as use them like cash just about everywhere. And, if I remember right, you can use these cards to pay for the subway or busses.",

Ask the information station for which bus since it\u2019s not labeled. \n\nOn the way there you can only buy a ticket at the bus info desk (a woman got turned away because she wanted to lay the driver in cash and ended up missing the bus since she had to go buy the ticket) and on the way back you can use Suica card or cash (not sure why).l to the driver.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t run all day but in the morning and evenings when people are leaving and going to Disney.

If you\u2019re in the middle of a forest and there\u2019s not much space, or if you\u2019re in a cramped spot in a park. Probably not fine. And then obviously don\u2019t do that at shrines, temples, and gardens with historic architecture. \n\nAlso there are parks with benches to sit. It may just be sparse.

I would choose the train over a taxi the majority of the time, it is more fun personally to ride the subway. Taxi drivers usually will want the location in Japanese and Google provides you with a Japanese translation, just tap the sound button next to the English address. \n\nFor train trips, no, you don't have to purchase individual tickets. You just get a Suica card. There are machines at the stations (I think the pink ones) that make them. You just tap your card each time you take a trip, it will automatically deduct the fare so you don't have to buy a ticket. Where I live, we have a bus card that works just the same, so if you have something like that - some sort of metro card, this will be very similar.",

The check in time thing along with the small size of standard rooms (and dizzying variety of room types ranging from semi to Hollywood to superior executive and more \ud83d\ude02) is interesting. \n\nIn the US obviously it varies but I\u2019ve had a lot of luck checking in early which is often super helpful. Fortunately this trip is a lot more relaxed than our normal trips with reliance on public transportation so really our arrival and departure from all hotels except the one we booked via Amex FHR (which includes guaranteed 4PM checkout) is pretty standard. I also like that it\u2019s so easy for the hotel to store your luggage. I\u2019ve rarely needed that service but it\u2019s beyond helpful",

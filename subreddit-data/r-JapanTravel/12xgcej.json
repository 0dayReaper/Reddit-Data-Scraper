Personally, I don\u2019t really think you need a whole day in Shibuya unless you really love shopping\u2026you could go to Harajuku in the morning/afternoon and spend the evening in a Shibuya. The crossing is better at night anyway. \n\nIt would make more sense to combine the Ghibli Museum with Shinjuku or some of the neighborhoods along the Chuo Line (if you want to see a more chill side of Tokyo). \n\nThe museum is in Kichijoji which is a nice neighborhood\u2026there\u2019s a park right by the museum you can walk around and there\u2019s lots of second hand shops nearby if you\u2019re into that. If you stay into the evening and like drinking Harmonica Yokocho is worth checking out.",

Hard-Off, Book-Off, etc are going to have much better prices.\n\nAll of the Gigo arcades are 100 percent interchangeable and there is nothing significantly different other than the layouts and maybe the number of machines they have. Same goes for Taito, Adores, or Round 1 Centers\n\nHey is good for old candy cabs and strange things you won't find elsewhere and is really one of the only unique game centers around, though.  Check out the Tokyo Leisure Land game center over by the Sobu Line tracks, too",

They're within walkable distance.\n\nI personally won't spend a whole day in Akiba arcades...... You can even fit arcade hopping into your first day of arrival as they usually open till at least 9-10pm. If you like Gundam (there's a giant moving one there until next March) I'd do a Yokohama day trip instead.",

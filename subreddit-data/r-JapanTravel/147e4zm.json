    "postText": "This will be my first time in Japan! I will be traveling from the US.\n\nI am still in the final stages for my dates. So far I have Sept 20- Oct 1. I have the flexibility to extend if anyone suggests changing things around. \n\nI am trying to be as flexible as possible. Please feel free to fill in any gaps. \n\nWhat I care the most about this trip is the food. I would love to take in some local spots vs trendy spots. \n\nI am also trying to find a specific Grand Seiko watch. \n\nI have weekend tickets to go to the Japanese GP!\n\n**Itinerary**\n\n* Sept 20th: Arrive to HND airport \n   * Activities: I will probably relax and try to regain my energy from my long flight\n   * Food: I will try to find something near the hotel in the area.  I have seen in this sub that it's best to be flexible as possible so I am taking that approach throughout the trip \n   * Hotel: The Knot in Shinjuku\n* Sept 21st: Tokyo\n   * Activities: If my body recovers nicely, I plan to explore Shinjuku/Shibuya and try to do some shopping (watch shopping).\n   * Would ideally try to visit Shibuya Crossing and go up Shibuya Sky.\n   * Food:  I plan to find things in the area. \n   * Hotel: The Knot\n* Sept 22nd: Tokyo\n   * Activities: I will try to visit some of the temples in the Tokyo area. Shopping will also be an activity I will be doing if I cannot find the watch I want the day prior. \n   * Plan to go to Nakano Broadway\n   * Food: Intend to be around Shinjuku for the evening and venture into the Golden Gai area\n   * Hotel: The Knot\n* Sept 23rd: Hakone Day Trip?/Kyoto\n   * Activities: I have tickets to go to the Japanese GP and plan to make Kyoto my home base for the race weekend. I am wondering if I could do Hakone for like half a day and then make my way to Kyoto? I do plan on sending my luggage this day or the day prior to my Kyoto hotel. \n   * If I cannot do Hakone in a half day (I can fit it in later in my trip), I plan to go to the qualifying race at Suzuka.\n   * Food: Find food near Suzuka during the day. For the evening I plan on finding some spots in the Pontocho Park area in Kyoto\n   * Hotel: Onyado Nono Kyoto Shichijo Natural Hot Spring\n* Sept 24th: Japanese GP Race Day!/Kyoto\n   * Activities: I intend to spend the majority of my day at the Suzuka circuit. Plan on riding on the JR train from Kyoto to Nagoya and then taking the local train to the race\n   * Food: Similarly to the day prior, find anything appetizing near the racetrack, and in the evening head back to Kyoto and explore more food spots\n   * Hotel:  Onyado Nono Kyoto Shichijo Natural Hot Spring\n* Sept 25th: Kyoto\n   * Activities: Planning on waking up early and heading out to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. From there I will try to make my way to Kinkaku-Ji. Lastly, I will like to hang around the Giod District.\n   * Food: Try to get breakfast near the forest. Lunch around the temple. Dinner around Gion District.\n   * Hotel:  Onyado Nono Kyoto Shichijo Natural Hot Spring\n* Sept 26th: Kyoto/Nara\n   * Activities: This day may be long and a stretch. I plan on waking up early again and making my way to Fushimi Inari. I do intend to climb up as far as possible. I would like to be there for 1.5-2 hours and take in the views. From there, I would like to head down to Nara and visit Nara Park. I want to visit some of the temples in the area and see the deer :). I would then head back to Kyoto in the evening for dinner\n   * Food: Breakfast at the hotel. Lunch somewhere near Nara. Dinner in Kyoto.\n   * Hotel:  Onyado Nono Kyoto Shichijo Natural Hot Spring\n* Sept 27th: Day trip to Osaka/Head back to Tokyo\n   * Activities: I plan on waking up early, one more time, and take the train down to Osaka, and spending most of the day there. I want to definitely try cool foods and meals. I plan on visiting Osaka Castle, Dotonbori, and Shinshaibashi. I will try to make my day back through Kyoto because I want to stop at the Suntory Distillery. Plan on taking the JR back to Tokyo\n   * Food: I would appreciate any suggestions for Osaka. If nothing, I plan to try any street food I see\n   * Hotel: The Knot in Shinjuku\n* Sept 28th: Tokyo/Hakone?/Kawaguchiko?\n   * Activities: If I cannot fit Hakone on Sept 23rd, I plan on doing it here and maybe doing a full day. Depending on my mood, I may switch it up and try to go to Kawaguchiko. I understand it may take longer to go there but if the day is clear, I would go there to get the best view possible of Mt. Fuji. Once I am done with my Mt. Fuji sightseeing, I plan on going back to Tokyo for the evening. If I could not find my watch in my prior attempts I will go back to shopping hunting for the watch that I am looking for. In the evening, I  plan on doing Mario Kart racing through the streets of Akihabara. \n   * Food: Flexible again, depending on the destinations. Evening, probably find a good ramen spot in Tokyo\n   * Hotel: The Knot\n* Sept 29th: Tokyo\n   * Activities: Plan on going to Tsujiki Market in the morning. From there, I would go to Teamlabs Planet. For my afternoon/evening, I will like to spend in Ginza and visit the Grand Seiko HQ(this may also be my last resort if I cannot find my watch).\n   * Food: Find food near the market. Evening, I will try to go to a nice omakase spot in Ginza.\n   * Hotel: The Knot\n* Sept 30th: Day trip to Yokohama\n   * Activities: I plan on being in Yokohama for the day. I want to visit the Nissan Museum. In the evening, I want to go to Daikoku PA to see the car scene at night. \n   * Food: Will take suggestions for any good spots in Yokohama\n   * Hotel: The Knot\n* Oct 1st: Travel back to US\n   * Activities: The title for the day is self-explanatory. I will be heading back to the US via HND airport in the morning\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts! I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for this trip. I can add more days if needed to my trip as well.",

            "comment": "\"visit some of the temples in the Tokyo area\" is extremely vague. It could totally make sense or just make no sense at all depending on the selection.\n\nIf you start the day early and plan to spend most of it (up to like 5pm) in Hakone, worth it, otherwise no, it take time to move around Hakone plus time to do things in Hakone itself.\n\nI personally do not especially like the idea of doing th GP from Kyoto as opposed as from Kyoto, but if you don't ming spending more time in the train every day... maybe.\n\nSuntory Distillery close like at 5pm... so that would really cut your Osaka day short.\n\nSo for the final rating : 0/10 because you plan to do the stupid karting. It's dangerous and really a nuisance for the people who live there.",

It really is vague and you risk losing time by walking aimlessly. \n\nWhere are you planning to go in Shinjuku? So many options such as Kabukicho Tower, Shunjuku Gyoen, Omeide Yokocho, Disney Flagship Store. Research this subreddit, Time Out, Live Japan, Youtube, Guide book to get a better feel where you are walking. \n\nYou mentioned that you are a foodie, but I dont see any goal in mind. Do you want to try Yakiniku? Yakitori? Sushi? Ramen ? Etc\n\nIf you have a vague itinerary then the outcome of your travel will just be rolling the dice as what you see on the day\u2026",

Tokyo might take a month to \u201csee everything\u201d and even then you won\u2019t be done.\n\nMy advice is to ignore all these mad itineraries people post.\n\nResearch all the things you want to do, and more, and put them all on a Google map. You can save places to a list and see them quite easily on the map. Note down anywhere that needs booking.\n\nThen, once you\u2019ve done that, the hardest part is working out where to base yourself - find somewhere that\u2019s close to your favourite places. Even then, you can\u2019t really mess up as the transport system is fantastic and it\u2019s pretty easy to get from place to place - your holiday may just be a shade inefficient.\n\nThen, arrive in Tokyo and just look at your map - make up what you want to do day-to-day. Be sure to put the things you\u2019ve had to pre-book in a calendar so you don\u2019t forget.",

You can maybe even squeeze a day trip here and there\n- September is 3 months away which gives you time to plan and make reservations as needed\n\nWell then to answer your question, how does one plan an itinerary ? I think this ultimately depend on your interest. If your interest is anime, that totally is a different itinerary than someone who is into history and shrine. My tips is to explore resources below and determine your leaning\n\n1. Start by exploring the major areas - japan-guide.com and this subreddit is your best friend. You will see that major tourism areas in Tokyo are not that many: Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Odaiba, Asakusa, Ginza, maybe Disney as distinct areas. The Japan Guide should also give yiu hints on recommended sights.\n\n2. To plan within the area, you can see many area guides on Youtube, Time Out Japan, Live in Japan, Tokyo Cheapo, etc. This will help you find things to do and sights within the specific area.\n\n3. Food can be researched on Tabelog again based on area and cuisine you want to try.\n\nUltimately, there is no shortcut to build your itinerary. You will continue to craft your itinerary for many days if not weeks as you discover new ideas. Good luck!",

Also loved the hotel breakfast, which we didn\u2019t try until our last morning and wish we\u2019d done sooner. I think it was on the pricier side for a hotel buffet but honestly one of the best breakfasts we\u2019ve had all trip. The bakery in the bottom of the lobby didn\u2019t open early enough to meet our needs (they just tease you with amazing smells when you wake up), but they supply plenty of treats to the buffet. \n\n*We were told it\u2019s standard for rooms to be very small, but every other hotel we\u2019ve stayed at has has much bigger rooms, and that wasn\u2019t something we paid attention to when booking, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\nAs for food, try to get a reservation at The Bellwood. Hands down our favorite dinner of the entire trip.\n\nEdit to add: Hijiri-ya Nishi-Shinjuku is a ramen place around the corner from the hotel and was a perfect first-night-I\u2019m-so-tired dinner.",

We hired cars and drove ~2 hours each way (hard to say how long it will take because speed limits are different here). It was worth it to drive up Mt Fuji. I'd hire the car from 10am til the next day if I did it again, because 7pm return isn't long enough.\n\nGolden Gai was total shit imo. Cover charge everywhere, locals sick of westerners shit (understandably), westerners just drunk acting silly. Might as well do it, but we didn't take long before our tolerance for it decayed. $90 iirc for five people having one drink each.\n\nYou have a lot of stuff in the trip, but you've got some good goals for each day. Don't stress about food because there's stuff everywhere plus great snacks at Lawson's/711. \n\nDon't skip Harajuku at dusk. Great cars to eye bang cruising around, and great ramen shops. Daikuko (might have that name wrong) at midnight on weekdays for more JDM culture, but some Aussies we met said they weren't allowed in without a car.",

We were there during the typhoon so qualifying was cancelled on the Saturday. We spent the day walking the city which was easy enough. \nI also think a lot of subway lines link with the main station but we didn\u2019t actually catch many trains when there.",

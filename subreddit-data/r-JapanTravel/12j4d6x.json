    "postText": "I got back from a trip, which was planned using a lot of advices that I got here, and now I just want to share some tips based on the experiences I had during my trip to Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo, my first after the reopening of borders after the pandemic. I hope this helps you in any way.\n\nI'll keep the itinerary details off this report because I basically went to the places that are in every Osaka-Kyoto trip, so it's way better to check other wonderfully written trip reports that this subreddit have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **ARRIVAL PROCEDURES AND VJW**\n\nWith all the VJW forms filled beforehand (blue screen for quarantine procedures, QR code for customs and immigration), I took roughly 15min to do all the arrival procedures in the airport (Narita, in my case).\n\nRight after getting off the plane, I showed the quarantine blue screen for a person (very briefly, and it was the screenshot of the page), and scanned the QR codes in the next steps. I talked just with one person, and got the arrival stamp in my passport.\n\nOverall I think it's better to use the VJW and fast track procedure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **TOURISM**\n\nAll touristic spots were full to the brim. I can't compare if it's worse or better than pre-pandemic, but the places were crowded, as expected. Tokyo, specifically, was similar to the last time I went there (2019).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **INTERNET**\n\nUsed the Japan Wireless' SIM card, so I retrieved it in the Japan Post Terminal 1 and did the setup right away (took 5min with just following the instructions that came in the package). It worked flawlessly during all trip. The internet speed is average, but plenty enough for Google Maps and social media.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **CASHLESS PAYMENT**\n\nAll major stores accepted Visa and MasterCard credit cards (chip and PIN).\n\nAnd a good amount of stores also accept payments with IC cards (Pasmo and Icoca in my case). I like to use the IC cards as payment to avoid carrying too much coins and speding time hunting for coins in the purse.\n\nThe only stores that truly didn't accept cashless options were small restaurants and stores, so always keep a couple of thousand of yen for those cases. Also, some gardens/shrines also only accept cash to pay for entrance tickets, charms and goshuin.\n\nIf you have an iPhone or Apple Watch, I've seen maaaany people using them for payments, so it should be a good option too.\n\nSo, to summarize, yes, cashless payment is much more common now and should cover most of your expenses there. But don't expect to pay literally everything with cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **YAMATO TRANSPORT**\n\nWorked very well, since I was carrying 2 suitcases at some point of my trip. I highly recommend using them if it makes sense to you (more comfortable hotel hopping, specially if the luggage is bothersome to carry - like large or heavy suitcases).\n\nThe cost were around 2,000 JPY for each one (check-in sized luggage), and took less than 24h to be delivered in the next hotel. I usually shipped them the day before the hotel check-out, and when I arrived at the next hotel, my luggage was already there. The suitcases were not damaged in any way.\n\nIf you have trouble filling those pink forms, there are instructions in English in the Yamato Transport website.\n\nJust check beforehand if the hotel reception can help you with the shipping procedures. Some of them (APA Hotels, for example) does all the procedures in the reception. Others help you calling the Yamato Transport to collect the luggage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **SHINKANSEN - \"OVERSIZED LUGGAGE\" SEAT RESERVATIONS**\n\nI didn't truly needed to use those seats with space for \"oversized\" luggage, however when I was choosing a seat in the ticket machine, 3 days before the shinkansen trip date, almost all of those seats were already taken. So I suppose it is advisable to reserve those seats ASAP, if you really need to use them.\n\nOverhead luggage space and the leg room as well have plenty of additional space. You can easily put a carry-on sized luggage on those. Just be careful with heavy suitcases.\n\nOr just ship the suitcases with Yamato Transport. I had good experiences with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **JAPANESE AND ENGLISH**\n\nI know enough Japanese for basic conversations, so this helped me so much that I can't even describe. What I didn't know (specific words or kanji), Google Translate filled those gaps. Specifically, the camera function worked very well.\n\nRecommendation is to study at least the basic phrases in Japanese, plus hiragana and katakana, if possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **TAX FREE**\n\nI've seen that the tax free procedures will change with VJW, but with the curreent procedures, it's much better than some years ago.\n\nSince now everything is digital, the store clerk fill an digital form in a system (probably from the government), take a photo of your passport and check your arrival stamp. This usually took 5min on each store. No more stapling those receipts in the passport.\n\nSince I just bought non-consumables, so none of the products were sealed by the store. But I've seen that they use a very specific transparent plastic bag written tax free for the case of consumables.\n\nIn the airport, none of the luggage were checked to confirm if the tax free products were leaving the country. They only scanned the passport in a desk designated specifically for the tax free procedures, and that's all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **COVID**\n\nMasks are widely used by the Japanese, on almost every occasion: indoors, outdoors, crowded or empty spaces. My main take here is to at least carry one mask with you. Regardless if you believe or not that masks are necessary nowadays, I've seen some restaurants to ask to use a mask while the food wasn't ready, so avoid a headache and just wear one.\n\nI had my temperature checked twice, when I entered two restaurants, but that's it.\n\nHand sanitizer is also available at the entrance of almost every store or establishment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*EDIT: included additional info.*",

Since I basically skipped all those people due to already having the VJW forms ready, it saved me a LOT of time.",

What can affect the lines is if there is another flight arriving at the same time as yours, but that's impossible to predict.\n\nOverall almost all security personnel I've seen in the airport was carrying a little sign indicating the people to show the VJW screen, so I believe this is still the prefered procedure for them.",

If you want to check cherry blossoms or fall foliage, you don't have much of a choice, since they happen in very specific periods of the year. Always check the forecast of the year, since it could change a bit every year (you can google it some months before, so you can have a more precise forecast). Besides that, I would say to avoid the end of summer, which is the rainy season.\n\nAnd, of course, rain happens and can mess your itinerary (half of the time I was in Yokohama rained pretty bad, and it was not in the weather forecast), so always have a plan B for those days (ex. go to the shopping mall or department stores).",

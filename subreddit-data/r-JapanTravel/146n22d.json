We are early 30\u2019s and people who like to plan our days mainly around eating, drinking, with only 1-2 big events. The way I wrote the literary is more many options for the day, not that we must do them all. We also wanted to check and see which of the things in the itinerary people say are must see places.\n \nBreakfasts: Mainly at hotels and Conbini\nLunches: Find places near the location or event of the day, or the different markets we plan to go to.\nDinner: We want to find nicer restaurants near where we are staying. Any recommendations on this would be greatly appreciated, we have a few, and many things marked in google maps already, but always love food recommendations!\n \nDay 0 Seattle \u2192 Japan - June 13th-14th\nAirport by 9:30 AM\nFlight leaves at 12:30 PM \nLand at 3 PM\nMonorail or Taxi to Hotel\nCheck in 15:00-24:00\n \nThe first 2 days in Tokyo I just wanted to write out some options to give us some direction, our basic plan Day 1 is to walk to Skytree &amp; find things along the way.

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI get being from Seattle you are use to rain, but Seattle isn't really hot and humid like Japan is in June.  I could see walking from Ueno to Skytree, but I can't imagine walking to Tokyo Tower.  It's going to be like 5 miles there the shortest route and I don't think you are planning the shortest route.  You want to be able to do a lot of walking in Kyoto, I would make sure you will have energy for that.  Also Akihabara doesn't really open up until 11 or noon.  There are some stores and shops that might open at 10 (electronics and Animate, but a lot of the other shops, Mandarake won't open until noon.)  I can't imagine Akihabara is interesting to walk through at 9  or 9:30 in the morning.\n\nI think some of your Kyoto days feel a little packed, especially depending on where you are starting from.\n\nThe Togetsukyo is a bridge?  I mean the view is nice enough, it comes in handy to get to other side of Arashiyama?  I don't know if I would go to the bridge just to see a bridge.  It's not like the Charles Bridge in Prague.  The monkey park is great if you want to see monkeys. The monkeys are still wild animals and go and come as they like.  They tend to hang out in the area because they are fed much like the deer in Nara.  You can go into a little building and feed the monkeys through the wire.  (The monkeys are outside, you're enclosed in the little building.)\n\nI personally don't think Shirakawa Go is going to be as interesting in the Summer, but everyone feels differently.  I think doing it as well as other things will be harder just because the buses only run so frequently.\n\nI enjoyed Myoryuji a lot, my tween not as much.\n\nI really like Kenrokuen, but unless the iris stay late this year, I think it is not as good in June.  I went previously in November and it was sort of disappointing in June, though getting softserve outside is much more enjoyable in the Summer.  \n\nGood luck!",

This is really helpful, we were hoping for this kind of feedback :) \n\nYes, we are definitely a little worried about the rain &amp; humidity, especially as it is already in the forecast.  The humidity will probably be the killer for us. haha. So we will rethink the Tokyo Tower walk. And good note on Akihabara, we will put that to later in the day. \n\nGood notes on Kyoto, Kanazawa and Shirakawa-go as well, we will probably skip that! We were hoping we didn\u2019t have TOO much time in Kanazawa, but we really do want a chance to slow down for a while, especially after Kyoto and Osaka. haha\n\nThank again, so much! This was very helpful :)",

It's like January in Seattle except 75-85. lol   I love Kyoto, but it can be stifling, because it is surrounded by mountains and the heat can be kept trapped.  You end up praying for a little rain.  \n\nWe are flying from Sea-Tac about a week after you and staying a little further into July.  \n\nIf you like you could slow down Kanazawa a little more or look into an easier trips like Kaga onsen or just start on your way back to Tokyo a little earlier and spend a night somewhere else.  A lot of people are really into the Kurobe Gorge railway.   I'm only so into trains so it doesn't appeal to me, but it could interest you.  (I also travel with my daughter, so that highly affects what we do!) I love Nagano.  It's super easy to leave Kanazawa and go to Nagano.  I liked Zenkoji.  If you like hiking, it might be a little cooler if you go to Shiga Kogen and do some of the trails there.  (I wouldn't do the monkey park in Summer if you're not OK with the one in Arashiyama.  In the Winter the monkeys want to go in the onsen, in the Summer they are bribed with food as well.)  I've not been to Shiga Kogen in Summer, but it was definitely colder than Nagano proper in February.  Togakushi keeps getting cut from my itinerary which is sad.  You could easily do Nagano and Matsumoto, if you leave Kanazawa early enough.  Matsumoto has a small art museum, an original castle just cute old town area near the castle.  (So does Nagano near its main temple.)\n\nI have been to Takayama, Matsumoto, Kanazawa, and Nagano in June.  \n\nIt's also good to sort of... think seasonally.  June is hydrangea season.  \n\n[https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/things-to-do/best-places-to-see-hydrangeas-in-tokyo](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/things-to-do/best-places-to-see-hydrangeas-in-tokyo)\n\nI hope this helps! :)  And bring your Seattle rain coat, since it will likely get use, I know I am!",

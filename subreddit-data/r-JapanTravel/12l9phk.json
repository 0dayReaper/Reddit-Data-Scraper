    "postText": "I am heading into Northern Japan at the end of the month and have already bought the 5 day Tohoku JR East Pass. All has been smooth sailing so far with regards to booking trains EXCEPT for Resort Shirakami trains. This is a PSA/tip for those who may encounter this problem in the future.\n\nRight now, the JR East reservation system online does not allow me to book the entire journey from Akita to Aomori despite there still being plenty of seats. However, the system does allow me to book portions of the journey within the route. Thus, I am forced to make 2 seperate bookings to go from Akita to Aomori using this train. Also, as the system does not allow adjacent bookings, there would be a small gap between 2 stations where I do not actually have the reserved seat.\n\nPretty stupid and the normal troubleshooting method of just heading down to the station to get the proper booking won't work as I'm not in country. If you guys have any recommendations on what to do and if you experienced any similar situations, you are welcome to share it with everyone.",

You are likely choosing a departure time that isn\u2019t a start to end train departure time.",

You must choose the specific train before proceeding on to check availability so thats not the problem. Departure and Arrival stations are also customised on the site to the Joyful Train you are choosing so there is really no way to mess it up.",

When I booked the Resort Shirakami I did it in person when buying my JR East Tohoku pass and was able to have them reserve seats on the exact departure time I preferred so no transfers. Since there are multiple departures each day on that train line it\u2019s unlikely to be completely booked up unless maybe during Golden Week in May.",

The train doesn't even show for me on the reservation lists, only the local or shinkansens. It's in the middle of the week on a Wednesday so there's no way it could be sold out...",

It can probably be resolved easily if you ask over the counter but this seems to be the case for online reservations. It also only shows up if you search for segments instead",

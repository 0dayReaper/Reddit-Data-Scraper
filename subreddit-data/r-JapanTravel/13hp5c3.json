    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nWe're a couple 33M and 32F visiting japan for our first time. Very excited!\n\nWe've decided on an itinerary but would be happy to hear any suggestions. The dates of the stays in the main locations are mostly set, but day trips to surrounding cities are always a possibility. We want to get a general feel for the country since it's our first time and experience things that are only possible to experience in Japan. We are OK with a busy schedule, but not one that has us compromising the holiday aspect of the trip AKA not overbooking.\n\nWe have gotten lots of inspiration from japan-guide.com, they have what seems like great itineraries.\n\nThere are some constraints regarding allergies (gluten, milk, corn etc), but we've tried to make it simpler by booking places that have a kitchenette and allow us to cook at home on some occasions, while also trying to find places that can accommodate for us.\n\nAlso, the last week of the trip that will be spent in Kyoto we will only be available for half days, therefore it would be best to keep Kyoto only activities for those half days we have available.\n\n\nAny thoughts and critiques are greatly appreciated!\n\n**Day 1- Arrival - Tokyo**\n\nLate arrival\n\n**Day 2 - Shinjuku**\n\nGroceries, Roaming around, checking out some cool bars, rooftops etc\n\n**Day 3 - Asakusa, Ginza**\n\n**Asakusa** Kaminarimon (Kaminari Gate), Sensoji Temple, Asakusa Shrine, Dempoin Temple, and some light shopping\n\n**Ginza** Imperial East Garden, and Ginza shopping\n\n**Day 4 - Shinjuku, Shibuka and Harajuku**\n\nMeiji Shrine and mainly walking around shopping in these busy famous areas\n\n**Day 5 - Nikko**\n\nToshogu Shrine, Taiyuin, Rinnoji Temple, Shinkyo Bridge and **open to suggestions**.\n\n**Day 6-7 - Mt Fuji**\n\nHiking up mount Fuji will use up 2 days\n\n**Day 8 - Takayama?**\n\nNot sure about this one, since it's quite far. It looks nice, but are there any suggestions?\n\n**Day 9 -Tokyo**\n\nRoaming and activities\n\n**Day 10 -Tokyo**\n\nRoaming and activities\n\n**Day 11 - Kinosaki onsen**\n\nKinosaki onsen in the middle of our stay, hopefully we can transfer luggage from Tokyo to Kyoto.\n\n**Day 12 - Transfer to Kyoto**\n\nTrip to Kyoto, arrival late afternoon\n\n**Day 13 - Arashiyama Full Day**\n\nMonkey Park, Togetsukyo Bridge, Tenryuji, Bamboo Groves, Jojakkoji, Gioji, Saga-Toriimoto Preserved Street, Otagi Nenbutsuji, Daikakuji\n\n**Day 14-15 - Shimanami Kaido cycling**\n\nWe will be doing this in 2 days.\n\n**Day 16 -Eastern Kyoto Full Day**\n\nGinkakuji, Philosopher's Path, Nanzenji, Keage Incline, Heian Shrine, Yasaka Shrine, Kodaiji Temple, Higashiyama Streets, Kiyomizudera\n\n**Day 17 - Nara**\n\nCentral Golden Hall, Eastern Golden Hall, National Treasure Museum, Nandaimon Gate, Daibutsuden Hall, Approach to Nigatsudo, Nigatsudo Hall, Kasuga Taisha\n\n**Day 18-21 - Half day visits through Kyoto**\n\nMostly going to see what we haven't had the time to yet, for example: Kinkakuji, Fushimi Inari Shrine, Nijo Castle as well as other activities.\n\n**Day 22 - Bye Japan!**\n\n**A few questions:**\n\n- Are we missing anything \"major\" on our list?\n- Considering our travel, should we get the JR Pass for 3 weeks or only 2? \n- Anyone have great experiences in restaurants in these cities that can accommodate for various allergies?\n- From your experience, is cash still king?\n- From experience, is the tea ceremony with a maiko/geisha worth it? Or is it mostly a tourist trap?\n- Where would you say is the fashion part of Tokyo to buy all kinds of outfits? (for example, lolita, very minimalist etc)\n- Is there anywhere you can rent a full lolita outfit for a day?\n\n\nThanks for your help!",

You can do overnight karaoke (and you can do that in Kyoto as well) but there are limited things open super late, because the people working those jobs need to be able to get home or have to want to work overnight.\n\nI'd say the biggest difference is Kyoto has more things to do at 7-8am than Tokyo does.\n\nOn your actual itinerary, I think it is very hard to climb Mt. Fuji in a single day because you have to get out there from Tokyo first.  I think most people do it over two or if they really want to do it in 1 they start in Kawaguchiko.  And yes, Takayama is a really long trip from Kawaguchiko.  You're looking at a good 6+ hours.  Someone else was just realizing this.\n\nIn terms of passes are you flying out of KIX, ITM, HND NGO, NRT, something else???\n\nIf you are flying out of Tokyo I believe a 2 week will pay off.  If you're not I don't think it will.\n\nBut honestly if things are not set in stone I would move them around some depending on if you really want to go to Takayama and to give Mt. /Fuji 2 days.  Like if you do go to Takayama, it might make sense to go from there Kinosaki vs. all the way back to Tokyo.\n\nI'd also make my Nikko day trip work within the 2 week period, since it seems odd to pay extra for Nikko, just because you have it earlier in the trip.\n\nYou can charge a LOT more places than you use to be able to, including combini.  I like to have some cash, but from my December trip I only spent around 20-30,000 yen in cash and some of that was refilling our suica and some was making sure my tween had her own spending money.",

We will most likely be going to sleep relatively early as we'll definitely be waking up early to try and see the temples in a more relaxed manner.\n\nIn my itinerary I should've been clearer, but I had already allocated 2 days to mount Fuji and we're getting picked up in Tokyo which makes life easier. I just edited it to add \"Day 6-7\". Also, the Shinamani cycling will be over the course of 2 days (I also edited it in my original post).\n\nDo you think think Takayama is worth it? As you said, it's far but we're willing to consider it if it's special.\n\nWe're flying out of KIX, that's why we're ending in Kyoto (actually our last night is in Osaka airport since we have a really early flight and wouldn't be able to get there using trains.\n\nI chose the trip to Nikko to be done while still in Tokyo, since it's a bit closer and we would make it work as a full day trip.\n\nAbout the card, that is great to know. No need to go there with lots of cash, but obviously I can imagine some smaller shops not having options for cards. Does VISA work in most places?\n\nThanks for all your time!",

If you're just going for an overnight, I think it's a long trip for that, especially as you are currently planned.  I like Takayama, I've been 2x, it just really needs more time.  You can easily spend 3-4 hours at Hida no Sato, it's really well done, let alone trying to get in anything else.\n\nIf you want to do Takayama, I would move things around and possibly move around your climbing Mt. Fuji days so that instead of returning to Tokyo you go onwards to Matsumoto (and then go Matsumoto to Takayama and then go up to Kanazawa before going back down to  Kyoto to head to Kinosaki.  \n\nWhat I meant was move Nikko as a day trip from Day 5 to day 9.  Unless there are very specific timed things you need to do, putting travel closer together tends to save money.  I also get that sometimes there are specific timed things that trump saving money.  I had that on my last trip, where I was trying to work around New Years closures.  \n\nSince day 5 and Day 9 are both nights spent in Tokyo, it's not like you are leaving from a different location.\n\nSome small shops take credit cards it sort of depends where they are?  Pre-Covid the place where I was the most surprised to not be able to use credit cards was Matsushima.  The boat tour and all the shops only took cash.  I do remember being surprised that the Farm Store owned by Nagashima Spa Land did take credit cards.  I think we paid in cash still.\n\nBut in the US, if I go to my local farmer's market, all the sellers take cards, but if you were to say go to an event with individual sellers like a shrine flea market  or some other hobby event, that would be doubtful.\n\nAnd yes, Visa is fine in person everywhere.  Most of my credit cards are Visa.  The only issue I had with Visa is I couldn't buy from the US my tickets for Tokyo Disney Sea.  (I had to use Mastercard)  Once in Japan, I had no problem using my Visa at Disney Sea and I was able to use my card on the App to purchase premier passes.  \n\nI think for allergies, it really varies on how severe the allergy is how easy it is to accommodate.  My daughter is allergic to mango.  It upsets her stomach, so we just avoid eating it.  If something is cross contaminated, it sucks to get a tummy ache but it's not life threatening.  Growing up, my parents had a family friend who was allergic to pine nuts.  She once went into anaphylaxis shock and needed medical attention because the glass she was using hadn't been washed well enough and someone who had drank from it in the past had eaten pine nuts.    Both allergies are completely real and legitimate, but the more minor reaction is easier to accommodate.    Avoiding milk and corn is much easier in Japan since usually their use is more obvious?  Corn syrup is not as ubiquitous in Japan as in the US.  The problem is actually wheat, since most soy sauce contains trace amounts.  \n\nIn general, places catering to Westerners are more likely to be accommodating to allergies.  We stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Kyoto and they had a sign up offering all sorts of milk substitutes and I am sure if I had told them I couldn't eat gluten they would have worked with me.  As it was, one morning I really just wanted avocado toast because I needed a little less dairy and I got avocado toast.\n\nI would imagine there are resources out there for places that work with wheat allergies since it's a fairly common allergy.",

I'll see how that would affect us and also I still need to see when it would be most beneficial to get the JR and for how long.\n\nGood thing to know about the card, we'll carry around some cash but maybe not much more than 20,000 yen or so.\n\nHer allergies are definitely not anaphylaxis shock level, but they are debilitating for a few days, so not the best thing to have when some of the activities are time sensitive (mt fuji, cycling etc).\n\nOur hope is to find somewhere where she can eat safely and try various things, even if that means going to one restaurant in each location. That's good to know about corn, although sometimes it can be tricky since when you see \"glucose\" or \"dextrose\" or maltodextrin\" it is usually a derivative of corn (cheapest source of it), but it's a good start knowing they're not great fans of corn itself. For soy sauce we'll definitely be taking our own, to avoid risking that and we'll have to be on the lookout for wheat. \n\nWe'll try and get an allergy card that can be helpful, we're just seeing the best way to do it (the list is long and it's helpful to provide examples for them to understand it).\n\nAs I mentioned, we're also staying in places with kitchenettes so it'll be something she can rely on too.\n\nWe're leaving out a big chunk of Japan up north, but it's just not feasible to visit all of it, especially since we'll be working for 1 of the weeks.

Corn happens to be particularly cheap in the US, it is less so elsewhere.  It's like how Soda in Mexico still uses sugar vs. corn syrup.  I had a friend when I lived elsewhere who was allergic to corn and we talked about how ubiquitous it is in the US. \n\nThe Japanese love corn, but it's usually in ways that you can't miss it, like corn soup or corn and potato pizza.  It's not going to be an accidental thing, they like their corn where you know it's there.\n\nI would make sure to figure out food for hiking Mt. Fuji and biking the Shimano Kaido because I think those will be the hardest places.\n\nBut yes, it's not feasible to go everywhere and I think it is very smart to figure out where you most want to be.  If you need a cheap day trip from Tokyo, you can go to Kamakura or Kawagoe \n\nIf you drop Takayama and move Nikko, you might be able to do just a 1 week pass.\n\nStart it on the 9th, it is good until the 15th when you go back from the Shimanami Kaido to Kyoto.  Everything else is just cheaper paying out of pocket.\n\nI have not eaten here but... it use to be a vegan and gluten free cafe.\n\n[https://ippukucafe.jp/](https://ippukucafe.jp/)\n\nNow it seems to have meat but I believe is still gluten-free and dairy-free and with the desserts the sugar used seems to be derived from beets.

    "postText": "Hi there! \n\nMy partner and I are having our second day in Tokyo together, and our first impression of it is awesome! However, there are so many places that made us runaway due to migraine-causing ultrasounds.\n\nMatsuya Asakusa - we couldn't shop. All the entrances have a device for it, we're in our early twenties and couldn't stay anywhere more than 2 minutes because of it.\n\nMost train stations, the Sky Tree, some restaurants, near some temples. It's quite intense.\n\nMy question is: \nObviously all the older people around can't hear it, but it seems like all the young people our age around us were walking by completely unphased by it.\nHow? Why? Does it damage your hearing enough after a while and you just don't hear it anymore?",

Try exploring Asakusa a bit more, closer to Senso-ji and Rokku Broadway. Open-air markets and shopping streets also seem to be free of them.",

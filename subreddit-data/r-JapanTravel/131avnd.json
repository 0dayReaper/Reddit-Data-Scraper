            "comment": "Rumour has it that lines at Japan customs are  very long and slow right now. Your flight may come in late. You'll be travelling from the airport at rush hour. What I'm saying is that there is little chance you will be checking in to your hotel by 5pm. But it seem the Kirby Cafe is open until 10, and the Skytree is probably opened later, too. So if you have the energy, give it a shot. But it's possible you might be tired, so be prepared  to slot those items in on another day if they're super important to you.\n\nMany stores in Akihabara aren't opened until 11am. I think most, if not all, of the locations of Mandarake don't open until noon. I know this is true of Akihabara and Nakano Broadway locations for sure. Closet Child (both the Harajuku and Ikebukuro locations) don't open until noon, either. Stores open quite late, but parks and other attractions close early. You really can't win waking up early if shopping is your goal.",

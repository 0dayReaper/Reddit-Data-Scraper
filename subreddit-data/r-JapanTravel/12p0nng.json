    "postText": "Had such a wonderful experience staying here that I thought to share this with you guys.\n\nBooked a car from ito station and drove all the way down but not before stopping by to interact with dolphins at \u4f53\u9a13\u578b\u65bd\u8a2d Dolphin Fantasy \u4f0a\u6771 ([https://imgur.com/a/RzKCCNv](https://imgur.com/a/RzKCCNv)) and to visit mount Omuro.\n\nA ryokan stay is usually kinda expensive and one of the highlights of a trip. Some of the factors that are important to me was a private room bath with a view to die for, good food (some ryokans seriously do not serve food that is bang for your buck) as well as clean and modern facilities.\n\nInatori Ginsuiso happens to have all these nailed down. When I was there, most of the guests were locals, only spotted 2-3 groups of tourists.\n\nGetting there wasnt much of an issue just had to navigate some small roads and tight bends. They do have a shuttle bus provided from their hotel to Ito station so those that arent driving might want to use that service. It was about a 30-40 mins drive from Ito Station.\n\nThe first thing that exceeded my expectations was the room itself. It was large and modern, beds were so comfortable, toiletries were good, the bath and the view was amazing.\n\nRoom Pics! : [https://imgur.com/a/N6VB3Si](https://imgur.com/a/N6VB3Si)\n\nThey also had a longue that had various sessions lined up throughout the day so that guests could have a different experience. When we first reached, there was a welcome mocktail served to us. It was concocted really well and was so refreshing. The longue had a nice selection of snacks, drinks (juices, sparkling wine) as well as a beer dispenser. When I was not soaking in the bath in my room, I was always spending it at the lounge. In the mornings, you can have a nice cup of coffee while taking in the view, when its noon u can chill over a beer and before you go to bed you can have some sweet treats lined up  for you.\n\nLongue Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/QO7aio4](https://imgur.com/a/QO7aio4)\n\nNearly all of my ryokan stays disappointed me with the food, but im so relieved to say that Ginsuiso did not !\n\nDinner and breakfast was at their dining hall. We were served a selection of appetizers, followed by some really good sashimi (the lobster sashimi was so good), followed by a whole abalone, steak and a entire fish. The only let down was that the fish wasnt the freshest one around. After dinner we went to the longue for some dessert.\n\nBreakfast was also honestly one of the better breakfasts I had in Japan. Such a huge selection of Japanese and western options. I had a morning soak before going for my breakfast. Taking in the wonderful view of the sea while slowly working through the massive options available was wonderful. There was curry, crab miso soup, eggs (so many options) , bacon, sausages, rice, fish, simmered beef, fruits, yoghurt.. the list goes on\n\nFood Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/f0ZzFbY](https://imgur.com/a/f0ZzFbY)\n\nThe best part was that it was only  119,250 yen for 3 pax. That works out to around 300 USD per pax for 1 night. Talk about value, ive had more expensive stays at other ryokans in the past that werent even that good. Service staff from the hotel concierge to the people manning the longue and our dinner assistant were all so friendly and attentive.\n\nBefore we left, we loaded up on coffee and small snacks from their longue. Overall it was a really nice experience and honestly one ryokan that I wouldnt mind going back. I felt so refreshed after staying there for 1 day.\n\nOverall rating: 9/10 (do give it a try!)",

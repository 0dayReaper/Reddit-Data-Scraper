Didn't know how to change the Post title so I deleted it.\n\nHi all, I\u2019ve just started planning my 13 day long itinerary to Central Japan with my partner, but there\u2019s so many places we wanted to go and we just can\u2019t decide which to eliminate. Currently we are pretty concerned that our itinerary is too packed and would really appreciate some help in planning this !\n\nOur main priority is to catch the autumn foliage and have a mix of nature + cultural + city areas within the 13 days.\n\nOur 13 day itinerary from mid Oct to end oct:\n\nDay 1: landing in Nagoya in the morning, taking a train to Takayama and staying over night there.\n\nDay 2: taking a day trip from Takayama to Shirakawago, and back to Takayama\n\nDay 3: Taking a bus to Kamikochi ( the highlight of the trip !!!), and spending the night at Okuhida.\n\nDay 4: Exploring Okuhida area and maybe do some onsen-hopping. Read online that tourists are able to rent an electric car or bike to explore around the area. Is that true ?\n\nDay 5: Going to Kanazawa from Okuhida And staying the night there.\n\nDay 6: Kanazawa day 2\n\nDay 7: going for a day trip at Kurobe Gorge.\n\nDay 8: Taking a day trip to Karuizawa, then taking the Shinkansen to Tokyo and staying the night there.\n\nDay 9: exploring Tokyo\n\nDay 10: Day trip to Mt Fuji area , possibly Lake Kawaguchiko. We would like to do some outdoor activities there such as kayaking or cycling around the lake.\n\nDay 11&amp;12: Tokyo sightseeing and Disney sea\n\nDay 13: morning flight from Tokyo back home\nRight now we are worried that there's too many day trips and are deciding on eliminating one of them: either Kurobe Gorge, Karuizawa or Mt Fuji Area. \n\nKurobe Gorge looks really beautiful online, but we understand that it\u2019s going to be really crowded at that time and wondering if it\u2019s really worth it. \n\nSame for Lake Kawaguchiko area, the idea of kayaking with Mt Fuji as the backdrop really excited us a lot. However we read that autumn foliage season comes later around mid Nov for Mt Fuji. Is that true? if so, we might not be able to see the leaves. \n\nAs for Karuizawa, I saw many Reddit threads that it\u2019s a hidden gem for all seasons and is much less crowded than Kurobe Gorge and Lake Kawaguchiko. But we are still not very sure what we can do there. It would be great if there\u2019s any insights into any outdoor activities we can do there.\n\nSo should we go ahead with our current itinerary or reduce it by one day trip? thank you!",

It's gorgeous though! Well worth the visit.",

So sorry for not clarifying on the original post, was quite frantic when I realised that I put the wrong date and can't find a way to change the title. \n\nAnd wow I didn't know that the railway journey is so long. \nAre there any other places you suggest to go around the area if we do not go to Kurobe Gorge? We are still exploring the itinerary. :)",

We were planning on going to Arashiyama bamboo forest and Tenryu-ji Temple today but I think I we just need to rest it, maybe go to an onsen?\n\nAny advice and suggestions on how to help her recover, what we can do in Kyoto that didn't involve much walking etc.",

Do not go to an onsen with a sprained ankle!!!\n\nI\u2019ve sprained my ankle 8x last year so I\u2019ve gotten quite used to maneuvering around with one.\nIf you can find some ankle tape wrap like this: https://www.zoro.com/first-aid-only-bandage-beige-gauze-bulk-5-yd-5-911/i/G5018781/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=surfaces&amp;utm_campaign=shopping%20feed&amp;utm_content=free%20google%20shopping%20clicks&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw9J2iBhBPEiwAErwpeULm45m7UgbW5Wtm0OCn2hQlLySh3WhRnRiOV7mAByp74S8L9JyqixoC8VMQAvD_BwE\n\nGet it. Some sort of gauzy, self-adhesive ankle tape will help immensely when she walks.\n\nAnd of course, avoid walking on it. Japan involves a lot of walking, since you have to take trains/buses, but maybe calling a taxi might be worth it in this case. I would try asking if some places have wheelchairs to borrow? I\u2019m not sure about Japan, but when I was vacationing in Palm Springs, CA with a sprained ankle, the zoo we went to had a wheelchair for rent.\n\nThe Arashiyama Bamboo forest is not a long walk, and the Tenryu-ji temple is not too far from the entrance so maybeeee that might be doable? I still think that might be tough, depending on the severity of her ankle. Maybe do more shrines (Yasaka Shrine in Gion District) or the Kinkakuji Golden Pavilion. \n\nThat really is unfortunate. Wish her a speedy and careful recovery!",

It's just that a lot of stuff in Kyoto involves a fair amount of walking, at least from what I could tell.\n\nWas more a post to see if others had ideas for things to do here with less walking, any decent anti inflammatory products we could pick up from general stores etc.\n\nJapan/Kyoto specific advice I guess!",

Weight bearing and walking itself is quite rehabilitative.\n\nMaking circles and doing alphabets with the foot, into tolerable ranges, is a good place to start as well. \n\nDepending on pain tolerance and swelling, introducing calf raises can help.\n\nIce can be used to manage swelling overnight or while resting between activity. Yes heat is good and has its place, but the management of swelling is going to be important for travel given that swelling will impede movement and can bring on pain.",

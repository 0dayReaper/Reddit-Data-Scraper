    "postText": "I've been meaning to write this up for a while but time kept running away from me! This January I spontaneously decided to go on a 3 week trip to Japan by myself. I had less than 2 weeks to organise/ plan everything and this travel forum was a big help, so I thought I would pay it forward by sharing my itinerary and budget.\n\nAcross 21 days I traveled from Tokyo to Nagano, Shibu Onsen, Jigokudani Snow Monkey Park, Matsumoto, Hirayu Onsen, Shinhotaka Ropeway, Takayama, Shirakawa-go, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Nara, Kobe, Himeji, Hiroshima, Miyajima Island, Naoshima Island and finally Osaka... it was a whirlwind, at times frenetic trip, but I never felt rushed or tired - one of the perks of traveling solo is the freedom to explore at your own pace.\n\nAs a solo female traveler, Japan is a marvel. It's comfortable and convenient to get around, and I always felt incredibly safe. One of the highlights of my trip was walking around Yasaka Shrine and Maruyama Park in Kyoto at 1am during a snowstorm (you can see some of my photos[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11iiful/kyoto_during_snowstorm/)). I found Japanese people to be very friendly, courteous and hospitable - many were curious that I was traveling alone and were quick to offer help if I needed. As soon as I left Japan I was already planning a future trip in my head to visit during the spring/autumn!\n\n**Itinerary Overview:**\n\n**Day 0:** Fly into **Tokyo**, explore Akihabara\n\n**Day 1**: **Tokyo** \\- Asakusa (Senso-ji temple, Nakamise-dori), Tokyo Skytree, Kanda/Jimbocho (secondhand bookstores), Ginza\n\n**Day 2:** **Tokyo**\\- Tsukiji fish market, TeamLabs: Planets, Tokyo Ramen street\n\n**Day 3:** **Tokyo** \\- Menju-jiji shrine, Harajuku (Takeshita and Cat street), Shibuya (Crossing, Hachiko, Shibuya-central Dori)\n\n**Day 4:** **Tokyo** \\- Gotokuji temple, Shimokitazawa, Shinjuku (Omoide Yokocho, Golden Gai)\n\n**Day 5: Nagano -** Train from Tokyo to Nagano.

Fly home!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BUDGET BREAKDOWN** (currency is in AUD)**:**\n\n**Accom**: **$809 total for 20 nights**\n\n* Capsule hotel in Akihabara, Tokyo: $38 per night (3 nights)\n* Capsule hotel in Shinjuku, Tokyo: $65 per night (2 nights)\n* Ryokan guesthouse at Shibu Onsen: $100, one night\n* Ryokan guesthouse at Hirayu Onsen: $66, one night\n* Capsule hotels in Matsumoto, Takayama, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Hiroshima &amp; Osaka: $25-35 per night\n* Yurt on Naoshima Island: $44, one night\n\nIf you are a solo traveler on a budget in Japan, capsule hotels are the way to go! I was constantly impressed at how *meticulously* clean they were - compared to the hostels in Europe and Southeast Asia that I\u2019m used to, capsule hotels in Japan are nothing short of luxury. Most even provide you with complimentary fresh pajamas, slippers, and a little toiletry bag.\n\nIf you can, I highly recommend staying in a traditional ryokan guesthouse at least once, especially in a little Onsen village in the Japanese Alps!\n\n**Food**: **$847 total**\n\nOn average I spent $12 - $20 per meal, although I did occasionally splurge on expensive meals such Kobe beef, Japanese Snow crab etc.,. Usually I only eat one or two sit-down meals a day: for breakfast I would pick something up from a convenience store (you can find a huge range of delicious, ready-made meals in supermarkets and corner stores), and for lunch I mostly ate street food or ramen.\n\nMy favourite dishes were tsukemen ('dipping' ramen - absolutely incredible), shabu shabu, dry buckwheat soba (a specialty of the Nagano region), Kaitenzushi ('conveyor' belt sushi - very affordable, so many different types of fish!) , and of course, Hida and Kobe beef. You can sample a huge array of Japanese foods at morning fish markets, my favourite was Nishiki Market in Kyoto.\n\n**Transport: $537 Total**\n\n* Narita Airport Skyliner express: $30\n* Tokyo subway: around $6-10 a day\n* Tokyo-&gt;Nagano Shinkansen: $70\n* Buses in the Japanese Alps: $100 total (traveling between Matsumoto, Hirayu-Onsen, Shinhotaka, Takayama, Shirawaka-go, Kanazawa)\n* Kanazawa-&gt;Kyoto Shinkansen: $80\n* Kyoto-&gt;Nara (return): $20\n* 5-Day JR West Pass (Kansai region): $164 (fast train/Shinkansen between Kyoto, Kobe, Himeji, Hiroshima, Okayama, Osaka)\n* Boat to Miyajima Island: $24\n* Ferry to Naoshima Island (return): $12\n\nJapan has the best public transport infrastructure in the world, by far. It's affordable, frequent, efficient, and fast. However, I did get lost every time I used the subway in Tokyo  - those stations are labyrinthine! Use google maps to find the right entrance/exit, because usually there are many!.\n\nSince I was spending a lot of time in the Alps it didn't make sense to buy a full JR Pass. However, as I planned on using the Shinkansen a fair bit to travel between Kyoto and Hiroshima, I bought a 5-day pass that only covered the Kansai Region. It's worth calculating the cost of each leg of your transport to see if a full JR Pass is the most cost-effective option.\n\n**Activities (museums, tickets, entry fees, tours): $453 total**\n\n* Tokyo Skytree: $23\n* TeamLabs planets Tokyo: $35\n* Jigokudani Monkey Park Pass: $40\n* Shinhotaka Ropeway Pass: $45\n* Hirayu-No-Mori Open-air Onsen: $15\n* Snow hiking tour on Shinhotaka Ropeway: $50\n* Entry fees for temples, castles, gardens: $3-12 each\n* Gion Evening Walking Tour: $17\n* Mt Misen Ropeway (Miyajima Island): $22\n* Naoshima Island museums: $70 total\n* TeamLabs Osaka Botanical Gardens: $17\n\n**Admin / miscellaneous (e-sim data, coin locker for luggage, IC card): $158**\n\nI bought an e-sim through GetYourGuide. It worked well, but I went through about 1GB every 2 days, so it's worth paying extra for more data. Arilo is also a good option.\n\nHaving coin lockers available in train stations and bus depots throughout the country made traveling around so much easier - I was able to leave my carry-on luggage at the station and explore a town for a few hours before heading on to my next destination.\n\nIC cards are great - you use them for trains, trams, subway, buses, and also vending machines and some retail stores and restaurants. Very easy to top up at kiosks in train stations.\n\n**TOTAL TRIP COST:** **$2804** **(excluding international flights).**\n\nOn average I spent $133 AUD a day  - around $35 AUD per day on accommodation, $35-40 on food, and the rest on transportation, entry fees, activities etc.,\n\nI would say traveling in Japan is more affordable than Western Europe and Australia, but significantly more expensive than other parts of Asia.\n\n**Stray observations:**\n\n* Cash is still king in Japan, especially for entry fees to temples, parks etc.,\n* Be prepared to carry around your trash - Japan is very clean and I rarely saw any litter, but public bins are difficult to find!\n* Similarly, you won't find many public drinking fountains - I usually topped up my water bottle in public toilets, which are extremely clean\n* don't eat and walk at the same time - street food stalls will have designated spots for you to stand and eat\n* Hardly anyone shouts or talks loudly on their phone, no one eats or drinks on the subway, no one  jaywalks or pushes in line... Japanese people are very respectful in public spaces\n* Vending machines are everywhere, with hot drinks available! This was a treat during the winter - warm lemon tea was my favourite.\n\nThere it is! Happy travels everyone",

            "comment": "Solo traveling in Japan is the absolute best. I would like to add a suggestion that made me save lots of money regarding transportation when I went there for a month in 2018 (don\u2019t know if anything changed since the pandemic): trains in Japan are expensive, especially shinkansens. A solution I found was to move from city to city by night bus. In this way I paid probably about a third of what I would have paid for a shinkansen and also saved the money for accommodation for that night by sleeping on the bus. All of a sudden instead of paying 130 euros for the shinkansen Tokyo to Kyoto and 30 euros for the night in a hostel I was spending only 30/40 euros for the night bus, which combined transportation and accommodation. Also, night buses in Japan are very comfy, I\u2019m not one who can sleep anywhere, I struggle sometimes even in my own bed but I was able to on those buses. If anyone in the future would like to try my suggestion is to go for Willer Express night buses. Obviously they\u2019re a good solution only if the ride lasts at least 6 hours so not every stop of your trip can be made using them. I used night buses to do Tokyo-Kyoto, Osaka-Hiroshima, Hiroshima-Fukuoka, Nagasaki-Hiroshima and Hiroshima-Tokyo. 100% would recommend to anyone that wants to save some money during their trip in Japan",

You can stay in one multiple days but you have to check out every morning and then check in again later in the evening and you will have to find a place to store your things during the day",

I think I'll do the JR 7-day pass (from Tokyo to Kyoto, then nara, Osaka, and Hiroshima before using it to come back to Tokyo) but want to be sure I'm choosing the most economical option since it'll be 3 of us.",

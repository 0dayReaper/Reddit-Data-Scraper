    "postText": "Hi guys, I have bought an express pass (from Klook) and tickets for USS Osaka on a Tuesday in July.\n\nI will appreciate advice on suggested routes/rides to take and places for lunch in the park.\n\nMy main goal is visiting Nintendo and harry potter world.  As it is summer, I am not inclined to queue long for rides in the sun. Hence I have bought the express pass.\n\nThe express pass timetable is as below:\n\n\\-11:50-12:10 JUJUTSU KAISEN The Real 4-D\n\n\\-14:50\uff5e SUPER NINTENDO WORLD Area Entry(No Re-entry)\n\n\\-15:10-15:40 Mario Kart: Koopa's Challenge\n\n\\-16:40\uff5e Harry Potter\u2122 Area Entry(No Re-entry)\n\n\\-17:00-17:30 Forbidden Journey\u2122\n\nSpider-Man or Jurassic Park (any time)\n\nI am thinking of reaching USS around 10am+ and lunch after the jujutsu kaisen ride, not intending to queue early in the morning to enter the park.",

I visited on a weekday.",

Thus, I had to go with the jujutsu kaisen option.\n\nAm I able to get a timed ticket for nintendo world in the morning before the jujutsu kaisen ride and then reenter nintendo world using the fast pass?",

Went early (before gate open)\n\n\n3. Grab the timeslot for harry potter world (manage to get the session before noon)\n\n\n4. Went clockwise and start with the indoor ride, crowd tends go start anti clockwise with the more famous ride\n\n\n5. Go for single rider lane for shorter q, but you may ended up diff row / car with your partner or friends\n\n\n6. Longest q for me will be the jurassic park ride which is 1.5hrs long\n\n\n7. Had turkey leg and minion buns as snack/lunch\n\n8. Covers everything we wanted (once) by 4pm (again, no Nintendo world). Can tell most of the ride has much less Q by then\n\n9. 3d ride is abit weird as they speak japanese without subtitle (Spiderman)",

            "comment": "There is a USJ app for iPhone not sure about Android, but it also might have. You have maps of the park, ride and waiting times, and much more there. \n\nSo I would advise you to get that. You should try going to the rides with long waiting times first, just when the park opens because you can get in line pretty quickly and get the busiest ride checked out on your list.\n\nOne thing I did is have a more extensive breakfast before going into the park; otherwise, you will lose a lot of time trying to get a bite. I went to Mac Donalds in the morning, but convenience stores were also open. Food venues will be packed from morning till late afternoon, so I decided to grab a bite around 4 pm when the lines were shorter but still long.\n\nOne thing I did is have a more extensive breakfast before going into the park; otherwise, you will lose a lot of time trying to get a bite.

If you want to take pictures of your food, consider Hog's Head, Discovery Restaurant, or Lost World Restaurant. I went for Hamburgers at Mel's and Pizza later at Louie\u2019s N.Y. Pizza Parlor because of the queues.\n\nEven with Express Pass, the waiting times can be daunting, so I advise you to have patience.  Spider-Man Ride was my first one when I went there last time because the lines were short, and so were the Minions. You should strive to get there before 10 am because people will already be queuing.",

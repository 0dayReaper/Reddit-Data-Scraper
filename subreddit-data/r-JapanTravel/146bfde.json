    "postText": "Is it possible to walk from Otagi Nenbutsu-ji to the bamboo forest? Looking at Google maps, there doesn't appear to be sidewalks near the temple which makes me question if it is even safe to attempt to walk. I'm not concerned with getting to Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, I'm mostly concerned with leaving. I see cautionary tales of waiting an hour for a bus so I'm trying to avoid the bus. I wouldn't be against using a taxi, just not sure how to request a taxi with my android. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",

Take that into consideration when planning how much walking you'll do, and build in time to stop and rest in air conditioning, with cool drinks. Also plan for rain.",

Depending on the day, there will be a night game with Hanshin Tigers, a popular Japanese baseball team. The team is very famous to enthusiastic fans. I think you can enjoy the atmosphere even if you are not a big fan of baseball games.",

It was also seconds away from Dotonbori and a couple of minutes walk to the station. \n\nAs for USJ, buy your tickets to Super Mario World way in advance. We procrastinated and the only available tickets between March - May (literally just two left) were for a random day in May.",

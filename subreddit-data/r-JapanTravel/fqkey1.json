So in January we spent $9300 for round trip airfare for 4 people the end of June for 2 weeks. At this point I have no other choice but to wait to see if things get better.\nUnited Airlines looks to only be offering a travel voucher that has to be used in 2020. I appears I cannot just get a refund.\nBecause she is still in school we can't go any other time in 2020.\nShe understands there are larger issues in the world.\n\nWe are hoping for the best.",

There's also a chance this extends until June, and the flight gets cancelled. All of these reasons should trigger the ability for you to get a refund, not a credit.",

And I think December is considered winter so yeah it would be weird to experience Fall phenomena in winter months haha\n\nBut I agree, I usually travel most of the world in October, it's not too hot, not too cold and is usually the shoulder season for most travel destinations.  Highly recommend, just hope you don't get unlucky!",

If they're not offering you anything good now, then hold onto the booking in case you either (1) get to go on the trip or (2) the situation worsens and they are forced to cancel the flight.",

It\u2019s a gamble taking the voucher.  You are helping keep the airline afloat but if they don\u2019t make it you lose your money.

We were lucky that every company we booked with was offering free cancellations, either from the beginning or was doing it because of the pandemic. Not entirely sure if/when we'll reschedule this trip for another time - there's a lot of uncertainty right now. Would love to go this fall or next spring, but it's really hard to say. ):",

He works at a news station so he gets first dibs on all the up and coming News and with the virus he could sense something wasn\u2019t right and that it was going to spread. Plus I have lupus and am immunocompromised. So it\u2019s good we didn\u2019t buy tickets otherwise we would\u2019ve been in a mess. I would love to go next spring on our 4-year wedding anniversary or next fall.",

Either way, busy just depends on what you're doing and what time. If you go very early or are there before they open, you're almost guaranteed less visitors.\n\nToday we'd be in Kyoto walking around Fushimi-inari, Kiyomizu-dera, with maybe a museum in the afternoon.

    "postText": "Wrote some stuff down in a Google Doc every night, so it ended up being super long and rambly. Hopefully I was able to cut it down at least a little bit. I wasn't sure if I could leave references to individual businesses or Airbnb experiences in, so please let me know if I need to remove those.\n\nI planned this trip 2 weeks before I had to leave, so I was in a huge rush. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it without everyone\u2019s help here and on the Discord! It was my first time traveling solo, so I was a little more neurotic about it than usual. Also I don\u2019t know how accurate the steps/distance on iOS is, but I figure there\u2019s enough internal consistency to compare between days.\n\n**Some personal highlights**\n\nTokyo\n\n* Check out some listening bars if you\u2019re down for a low key night with more of a focus on listening to music than socializing: Grandfather\u2019s, Bar Martha, Bar Track, Ginza Music Bar\n* Yoshikami is a pretty interesting (albeit pricey) place for dinner. It\u2019s apparently been there since the 1960s and has a nice diner vibe.\n\nKyoto\n\n* Otagi Nenbutsuji, Adashino Nenbutsuji, and Nanzenji were my personal favorites.\n* Fu-ka near Ginkakuji for fantastic omurice.\n\nOsaka\n\n* I loved Osaka in general for its mixture of being laidback with big city vibe\n* Izakaya crawl with Taka was amazing (https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1018635). It\u2019s true that you can plan a night of izakayas for free, but honestly I found the cost pretty worth it. Taka was a really cool guy and made for an incredibly memorable night.\n* Okonomiyaki Chitose for okonomiyaki. Great food and great staff.\n\n**Monday, May 29 - arriving in Tokyo**\n\n* **3pm** - Haneda Airport arrival. Withdrew money after immigration, picked up Suica card, then traveled to Ueno Station (close to hostel) to pick up JR Pass due to 1 hour line at airport. In hindsight, I obviously should\u2019ve gotten the JR Pass the following day, but I was jetlagged and exhausted and wasn\u2019t thinking. When I arrived at the hostel, I ended up falling asleep and decided to just start my trip officially the following morning.\n\nReflections\nIf you\u2019re an anxious planner or traveler like me, definitely don\u2019t plan anything specific on the first day. There\u2019s a good chance your plans will get derailed. The JR Pass line at the airport is often super long and if you can, try to stop by an office close to where you\u2019re staying or near one of your stops.\n\nWalked: 6540 steps / 3.1 miles\n\n**Tuesday, May 30 - Tokyo (Akihabara)**\n\n* **7am** - Yoshinoya for breakfast (Random, but I wanted to try all 3 of the big gyudon places by the end of the trip just because. Even as a big completionist, this wasn\u2019t worth it at all.)\n* **8am** - Walked around Ueno Park, then Ameya Yokocho. \n* **11am** - Gyukatsu Motomura for lunch at Ameyoko, which was absolutely incredible.\n* **12pm** - Walked around Akihabara and checked out the \u201cWeird vending machines\u201d on Google Maps. It was definitely weird. Would recommend if you\u2019re kind of drawn to weird shit, and the hostel staff found it super entertaining when I showed them everything. \n* **3pm** - I ended up moving through Akihabara pretty fast (I have a bad habit of not being able to take my time with these things). I decided to stop by some places in Ginza, like the Sembikiya flagship store and the Okuno building (Room 306).\n* **6pm** - I was still pretty jetlagged, so I ate some dinner with people at the hostel and hung out with the hostel residents and staff.\n* **10:30pm** - Stopped by a convenience store to grab something for breakfast the next morning.\n\n**Reflections**\n\nHaving a list of restaurants or specific foods (e.g. tempura, okonomiyaki) to pull from can be super helpful in being slightly flexible/spontaneous but also settling some of your (my) neuroticism. I had planned to check out Gyukatsu Motomura elsewhere but since it\u2019s a chain and I had no idea what to eat, it helped me make a decision for lunch.\n\nIt can be a good idea to have an \u201coverflow list\u201d of things to do in certain areas. I thought I\u2019d spend more time in Akihabara but I think I was still getting the hang of traveling/exploring without rushing around. \n\nWalked: 27728 steps / 12.9 miles\n\n**Wednesday, May 31 - Kyoto (Nishiki Market / Department Store food floors / Kiyomizu-dera)**\n* **7:30am** - Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto\n* **10:15am** - Walked to hostel and suitcase wheels ripped off on the way there (still left it there for storage). Original plan was to wander Nishiki Market and the food floors for Takashimaya Department Store and Fujii Daimaru, which I did for a bit. Then got a new suitcase at the large tax free store a block down, and walked back to the hostel to put my suitcase there.\n* **3pm** - Check in with a new suitcase and head to Kiyomizudera. Three hours was more than enough time for me to wander around Sannenzaka, Ninnenzaka, and Kiyomizu-dera. I\u2019m also not someone that is great at lingering to stop and smell the roses, though.\n* **6:30pm** - Try to line up for Menya Inoichi. The line was already closed for dinner, so I stopped by Nakau for some fast gyudon/tonkatsu instead.\n\n**Reflections**\n\nHave backup plans for your meals, list out some ideas in the area but expect some of those to be derailed.\n\nYou might need an eye mask even if you splurge on a private room in a hostel. The blinds were paper thin here so I woke up at like 4-5am.\n\nWalked: 26290 steps / 12.2 miles\n\n**Thursday, June 1 - Kyoto (Arashiyama / Ginkakuji / Philosopher\u2019s Path / Eikan-do / Nanzenji / Gion)**\nThis was the day I was prepared to walk the most because of the itinerary. It ended up being pretty packed, but I think it worked out decently well. Both of these things would\u2019ve been better off unrushed as maybe 2/3 of a full day, so I would\u2019ve split this up into 2 days if I could have.\n\n* **7am** - Breakfast at a convenience store, then taxi to Otagi Nenbutsuji at 7:30am (opens at 8). It isn\u2019t the cheapest option, but there also isn\u2019t a great alternative. It was pretty empty and a great place to start the day. \n* **9am** - Walked to Adashino Nenbutsuji, which was also fairly empty but had a beautiful bamboo area that honestly was basically as good as the Arashiyama grove for pictures. \n* **10am** - Walked to Tenryuji, which included the Saga-Toriimoto Preserved Street along the way, then did the Arashiyama Walking Tour from Inside Kyoto, which was a great way to see a little bit of everything (https://www.insidekyoto.com/arashiyama-bamboo-grove-guide-walking-tour). \n* **12:30pm** - Walking tour led me to Togetsukyo Bridge, where I could easily bus over to the Ginkakuji area. \n* **1:30pm** - Grabbed lunch at Fu-ka, which was a small restaurant run by some very sweet people. The omurice there was amazing, and I would definitely love to go there again someday. \n* **2pm** - Ginkakuji -&gt; Philosopher\u2019s Path -&gt; Eikan-do -&gt; Nanzenji -&gt; Gion. I was definitely not prepared for how much stuff there was to do at Nanzenji in particular! I definitely could\u2019ve spent 2-3 hours there even rushing around. I ended up not being able to check out the inside of Nanzen-in and the big gate because I ran out of time. Upstairs from the Nanzenji arches there is a great walk to leave Nanzenji when you\u2019re all done (Nanzenji Suirokaku). It takes you past a power station, and then down some abandoned railroad tracks. \n* **5:30pm** - Went to check out Gion and Pontocho. I couldn\u2019t figure out what to eat for dinner, so I thought I\u2019d give Menya Inoichi another shot. It was pretty early but the line was closed again. There was an amazing fried chicken place nearby called Loco Chicken (would definitely recommend too!)\n* **7pm** - Checked out Yasaka Shrine and Gion again now that the sun was down. It was nice but admittedly underwhelming after all the amazing temples I had seen. I was originally going to go to an izakaya for the night or experience some nightlife, but I was pretty tired and decided to call it a night.\n\n**Reflections**\n\nEven if you\u2019re a rusher like I am, Nanzenji especially can take some time. Otagi Nenbutsuji and Adashino Nenbutsuji are a little out of the way, but definitely worth it. The preserved street isn\u2019t all that exciting, but it is along the way from Adashino Nenbutsuji to Tenryuji.\n\nMenya Inoichi apparently closes pretty damn early wtf, possibly due to running out of their limited supply of wagyu. Loco Chicken was suuuuper good though. I guess there see a lot of great food options and planning meals in advance should only be if there\u2019s a restaurant I really want to stop by (e.g. Fu-ka).\n\nWalked: 33577 steps / 16.4 miles\n\n**Friday, June 2 - Kyoto / Nara / Osaka**\n\n* **7am** - Got up to go to Fushimi Inari Taisha. We were on the edge of a typhoon (apparently the landslide zones of Kizugawa were being evacuated?) so it was pouring rain, which meant it was really empty on the actual walk to the summit. \n* **10am** - Kintetsu train to Nara Park. It was pouring there too, but the deer were still out and about to get their food from visitors. I was a little tired at this point since my feet were soaked through, so I went to check out Todaiji and only took a brief walk around Nara Park before heading to my hostel in Osaka, so I could get my shoes washed and dried at a nearby laundromat.\n* **8pm** - I did an Airbnb bar crawl (https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/4388157) in the Dotonburi area which was awesome as a solo traveler because I got the chance to meet other people much more easily and check out some local spots I realistically wouldn\u2019t have gone to (or at least navigated easily). The guide was fantastic and fun, and it was a really nice way to get an introduction to Osaka nightlife. I would definitely recommend doing this on your first night if you want to spend some time in Dotonburi! You can find the listing for that one here: . One of the places we stopped by was called the Misono building, which had a bunch of interesting and quirky bars.\n\nWalked: 27023 steps / 12.4 mi\n\n**Saturday, June 3 - Osaka (shopping streets and Dotonburi)**\n\n* **10am** - Took a look around Denden Town and all the different streets in Osaka near Dotonburi (Kuromon Ichiba, Hozenji Yokocho, Ebisu Bashi-Suji, Shinsaibashisuji). I also stopped by the Ebisu Tower Ferris Wheel, which was nice but also not something I\u2019d consider a must-do activity. I imagine it might be even cooler at night when the lights are all on.\n* **6pm** - I did another izakaya crawl here, and it was AMAZING (https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1018635)! The guide, Taka, has lived all around the world and has some incredible stories to tell about his life. He worked on farms in remote places in Australia, for instance, that even the Aussie guests were astounded to hear about. The vibe was definitely a lot more chill and not super conservative, if that makes any sense. It was the kind of environment where all the guests felt comfortable asking him how to swear in Japanese after the first round of drinks. If you\u2019re not super uptight about stuff and want the feeling of local nightlife with some friends, this is a must-do in my opinion! Taka was such a cool guy and this was an unforgettable once-in-a-lifetime experience. We stopped by to do some karaoke at the end, which I felt was mandatory since we were at its birthplace.\n\n**Reflections**\n\nTaka brought us to one of the streets that I completely missed in my research, which was Tenshinbashi-sushi. It\u2019s supposedly the longest shopping arcade in all of Japan, at 2.6km long. Definitely something to check out!\n\nWalked: 25782 / 11.8 miles\n\n**Sunday, June 4 - Osaka (Shinsekai, Abeno Harukas)**\n\n* **10:30am** - Was starting to get pretty tired by this point so I slept in again, and got to Shinsekai around 10:30. I realized how much I loved the vibe of Osaka, which seemed much more laidback than the other big cities. I remember there was an adorable off leash puppy walking around one of the shopping streets, and a bunch of old people pulled out their phones and started chasing it down to take cute pictures. I might be totally off the mark from my few days\u2019 impression of other big cities, but that just felt kind of unique to me.\n* **11:15am** - Lined up outside Okonomiyaki Chitose so I could get food there when they opened. Fantastic okonomiyaki, and the owner and staff were super great as well. They chatted with me a bit and joked around with each other while making the food in front of us. Great experience.\n* **1pm** - Went to Tsutenkaku to look around and check out the viewing area. It also had this big slide that you could pay to go down, which was quite fun too.\n* **2:30pm** - Walked over to Abeno Harukas to check out the observatory here. The view was fantastic and they also had a fun little VR bungee jump station where they put you on a tilt table and simulate a jump from the observatory area. Didn\u2019t have time to check out the helipad because I had a timed ticket for the aquarium (which didn\u2019t end up being necessary, it wasn\u2019t super busy at this time).\n* **4:30pm** - Osaka Aquarium! I honestly considered skipping this and I don\u2019t think it was absolutely unmissable, but it was a fun time. I really tried to take my time here but it only took 2 hours.\n* **6:30pm** - Grabbed dinner at nearby Tempozan Marketplace, then went on the Tempozan Ferris Wheel (waited for one of the clear bottom carriages). Another fun activity that I wouldn\u2019t categorize as a must-do, but definitely worth it if you\u2019re in the area.\n\nWalked: 20954 / 9.6 miles\n\n**Monday, June 5 - Hakone**\nThis is the part of the trip that I embarrassingly botched, but considering I had less than 2 weeks to plan the whole thing while working full time, I\u2019m trying not to give myself too much shit for it.\n\n* **10:30am** - Arrive at Odawara Station and leave luggage in locker there (packed a day bag). Transfer to the train that will eventually take me to Gora Station\n* **12pm** - Gora Station. Grab a quick lunch at some random cafe and walk over to the Open Air Museum.\n* **2pm** - Realized I spent too long at the museum and rush to continue the loop. Spend about 30-45 minutes at Owakudani.\n* **3:50pm** - End up waiting at Togendai until 4:25pm for the next pirate ship.\n* **4:50pm** - Arrive at Motohakone and decide I\u2019ll do the quick walk to Hakonemachi and catch a cab to my ryokan (checkin before 6 if I want to make it in time for dinner). My big mistake here was not noticing that the taxi stand was empty already by this time.\n* **5:10pm** - Realize I\u2019ve screwed myself at Hakonemachi and decide to take the Tozan Bus to another major stop to get a taxi. Yunnessen seemed like a good bet but the taxi stand was once again totally empty. Ended up wandering around for about 20 minutes and managed to flag a stray taxi.\n* **6pm** - Check in and realize my dumb ass accidentally booked without the dinner option and that I could\u2019ve taken the long way to the ryokan after all.\n* **7pm** - Stop by a nearby kaiseki place for dinner. They seemed a bit wary about having me eat there and really emphasized that this was a set menu that took a long time (probably had bad experiences with tourists in the past?).\n* **8pm** - Get cleaned up and head to the onsen before bed\n\nWalked: 17975 / 8.2 miles\n\n**Reflections**\nIf you really want to stay in Hakone for only one night and one day, I would recommend checking into your hotel/ryokan the night before and relaxing there, which gives you the next full day for exploring the city. YMMV of course since I did get to Hakone in the late morning, but I think doing the loop then ryokan will inevitably feel like it\u2019s cutting into ryokan time.\n\nEven though the Hakone transportation system is great, things like the Tozan Bus line can have long lines and alternative/workaround routes like in the big cities don\u2019t really exist. Tight schedules are tough to stick to, and I nearly got stranded because I stood at one of the taxi stops around 5pm and it became clear that no one was going to be coming by.\n\nBooking.com has a lot of ryokans listed as minimum 2 people (I just bit the bullet and decided to splurge), but the staff at Senkyoro were confused about why I paid for 2 instead of 1. Could be good to try to check with the ryokan directly in case you can save some money when booking.\n\n**Tuesday, June 6 - Tokyo (Shinjuku, Shibuya)**\n\n* **6:30am** - Leave for Odawara Station because I had to meet with a relative in the morning (like I said, definitely could\u2019ve scheduled this better). Definitely misplanned this leg of the trip, and didn\u2019t maximize my time in Hakone at all.\n* **10:30am** - After dropping off luggage at Asakusa Station locker near my hostel, met up at Shinjuku Gyoen, then walked around and grabbed lunch at Omoide Yokocho. Also stopped by Kabukicho and Golden Gai just to look around.\n* **1:30pm** - Originally planned to spend more time at Shinjuku and go to Shibuya the following day but I realized I didn\u2019t have anything left to do. Walked to Shibuya and checked out the Hachiko Statue and Harajuku. Stopped by Iyoshi Cola. Shibuya Sky tickets were sold out so I had to come back the following day for my original reservation.\n* **5pm** - Hang out at Grandfather\u2019s before dinner. Great place for people interested in listening bars!\n* **6pm** - Head back to my hostel (K\u2019s House Tokyo Oasis) to check in, then swing over to Sensoji and Nakamise-dori to check out at night.\n* **7:30pm** - Grab dinner at Yoshikami, a Japanese style Western restaurant. Had a really good beef stew and cream corn potage. Went here in passing but would definitely recommend stopping by if you\u2019re in the area.\n\nWalked: 27632 / 12.8 miles\n\n**Wednesday, June 7 - Tokyo (Shibuya Sky, Akihabara, Bar Martha/Track)**\nI spent a good chunk of my life in Shanghai, China, so I think the appeal of the big city stuff was a little lost on me (not a huge big city guy). In hindsight, I definitely didn\u2019t need to allocate this many days for Tokyo. I definitely should\u2019ve gone further to other areas for day trips that were recommended on the Discord, like Shimokitazawa, Jiyuugaoka, Koenji, Kamakura/Enoshima, \nHonmonji Ikegami, Yokohama, Nikko, or Fujikamaguchiko.\n\n* **10am** - Slept in and explored Nakamise-dori a bit after. Grabbed an early lunch and headed over to Shibuya for my Shibuya Sky reservation.\n* **12:40pm** - Shibuya Sky for a little over an hour. I wouldn\u2019t consider a must-do, but it\u2019s definitely a nice spot to get a good view of the city. Pretty similar vibe to Abeno Harukas (Harukas 300).\n* **2pm** - Headed to Akihabara to mess around for a little more and get some gifts for friends. Checked out all the different arcades and peeked at some rhythm gamers in their element.\n* **6pm** - Headed to Ebisu to grab dinner. Found a Japanese style Italian restaurant called \u201cUncle Tom\u201d (Google translated name), used Google Lens to translate the photos of the menu and just pointed and ordered. \n* **7pm** - Stopped by Bar Martha, which was one of my personal must-sees. Some of the reviews online were pretty scathing, and I\u2019m not sure if the staff have just mellowed out in recent years or the reviewers lacked self-awareness, but it was a great experience. You\u2019re not allowed to talk too loudly or otherwise be disruptive (or take photos), but that\u2019s really just your typical listening bar. The Tannoys sounded fantastic!\n* **8pm** - Went to Bar Track to check it out as well. A little bit more laidback than Bar Martha but with the same rules. Also a great spot.\n\nWalked: 21181 steps / 10.3 miles\n\n**Thursday, June 8 - Tokyo**\n\n* **10am** - Stopped by Tsukiji Outer Market to check it out. There was a fruit stall that sold a cup of Shine muscat grapes for about 2000 yen (super expensive but worth it just to try - they really were pretty amazing). Ended up meeting up with someone on the Discord for lunch, and we wandered Ginza for the Uniqlo and Muji flagship stores.\n* **3pm** - Split up with Discord buddy because he wanted to head to Shibuya but I had dinner reservations at 5pm. Wandered around a bit more and checked out Kabukiza and then went to Mantensushi Hibiya for 5pm omakase.\n* **7pm** - Went to Ginza Music Bar. A little difficult to find but very much worth the visit. It was relatively empty but it was a fantastic spot to round out my listening bar visits. It had a little more of a typical bar-like atmosphere but the music and sound system were just as amazing.\n* **8pm** - Head back to hostel to pack. Grabbed some last second ramen at Asakusashoten on the way back. Needed to be a little more intentional about cash usage here because I wanted to use it all up before leaving. After factoring in my subway and Skyliner costs, I ended up with 210 yen in my pocket and 7 yen in my Welcome Suica (I really should\u2019ve just gotten a regular one) the next morning before my flight, and spent 200 yen at one of the massage chairs in Narita.\n\nWalked: 19530 / 8.9 miles\n\n**Thursday, June 9 - Flight out from Tokyo**",

            "comment": "**Some general takeaways:**\n\n* The rush hour in bigger cities is around 7-9am and 5-7pm. Especially if you have large luggage or just suitcases in general, you\u2019ll feel like an asshole on the buses or subways during these busy times. If you can help it, take a taxi or avoid these times \u2014 in Kyoto for instance, they specify that you should keep luggage off the buses in general. In Tokyo, I once decided to browse some shops to kill the 15 minutes between 8:50 and 9:05 and the difference was surprisingly substantial (though this could have been a coincidence).\n\n* Google Maps is fantastic for helping you figure out public transportation, but sometimes it gets things like platform numbers wrong or doesn\u2019t mention needing to buy an extra ticket. Try to learn the transportation system a bit even if you\u2019re app-reliant. For instance, the Skyliner to/from Narita Airport is just listed as a train transfer but you have to buy an add-on ticket to get onboard.\n\n* If jet lag kills your appetite like it does for me but you\u2019re going to be walking a lot, really try to get food in your system. Drink protein shakes if you have to! I\u2019m sometimes still hungry after a Chipotle burrito in the US, but my first few days in Japan I ended up not eating much or skipping meals. After averaging 25k steps / 12 miles a day the first week, I felt really fatigued and lost a lot of weight (and not in a good way).\n\n* Travel light if you can! I ended up having to travel with a check in sized bag (large but below the Shinkansen guidelines for oversized) because I had things to bring to overseas relatives, but it was a huge pain. If you do have to, though, know that a check in sized bag absolutely fits overhead in the standard Shinkansen. \n\n* If you\u2019re traveling with large or heavy luggage, also consider leaving your stuff in a locker instead of going all the way to your hostel to save some trouble. For instance, I packed a day bag and dropped my stuff off in a locker that I knew I would return to, so that I could grab it on my way out of the city. Hakone-Yumoto specifically has a baggage delivery service that works within a day, but unless your schedule works with their timetable, you\u2019ll be left handling it yourself going one direction.",

The staff were amazing and seemed genuinely interested in making new friends with guests, and it made the whole vibe of the place super social and friendly. Hanging out with the staff and other guests here was genuinely one of the highlights of this trip for me.\n\n* Kyoto - K\u2019s House Kyoto - Backpackers Hostel\nThe staff, as usual, were super accommodating and nice as usual, and the hostel itself had great amenities. I was too tired in Kyoto to really socialize, but K\u2019s House seemed like a great hostel for that! The common area on the second floor was super lively at night with residents hanging out and chatting with one another. It definitely had a bit of a college dorm vibe (in the best way possible).\n\n* Osaka - Osaka Namba Miyabi Hostel\nUnfortunately, the private room wasn\u2019t worth it. To me, the perks of a private room over a bunk would be having some extra space for yourself and some peace and quiet. The soundproofing here was really bad (could hear the next room over almost perfectly even when they were speaking quietly), and the private room was so narrow I could barely open my suitcase flat on the ground. The staff were fantastic and friendly and the amenities/location were actually pretty nice though! Since the main gripes I had with the private room aren\u2019t things you really expect from a hostel bunk, I think this place would still be great for a standard hostel stay (just not the private room). It\u2019s also worth mentioning that this place has no elevator, in case accessibility might be a concern for you.\n\n* Hakone - Senkyoro\nA great ryokan that\u2019s incredibly beautiful (though I imagine most are). The public onsen is available for guests to use whenever (until midnight) and there\u2019s an open air one that looks out to the mountains. The staff are wonderful and the ryokan area is a great place to explore. One thing to keep in mind is how relatively remote it is. If you\u2019re doing the Hakone loop, this ryokan is closest to Togendai, which is kind of in the middle of it. \n\n* Tokyo - K\u2019s House Tokyo Oasis\nThis K\u2019s House location was more low key and much less busy at night. It had a much more homey vibe than the one in Kyoto. The staff at reception were incredibly kind as usual. One thing that might be worth mentioning is that the bathrooms here don\u2019t have a bidet. The private room I stayed in was amazingly dark even in the morning, so it was easy to sleep in on the mornings I wanted some more rest. It is about a 5 minute walk to Sensoji though, which made it very easy to visit at night.",

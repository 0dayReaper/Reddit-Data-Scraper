    "postText": "My friend and I were in Tokyo DisneySEA today, and had this interesting experience.\n\nWe were walking away after having taken a photo at the StellaLou spot by the ship, and a group of about 4-5 Japanese girls approached us and asked if they could take a picture with us. My friend and I were really confused, and thought they meant us take a photo of all of them, but no. They wanted a picture with us like a picture you would take with the actual characters at the park! We said sure and they kind of giggled and said sure to each other. They were very sweet though. They asked us afterward where we were from, and then one of the girls told me I smelled good? And they left after bowing and waving.\n\nMy friend and I are both short American girls. She is very visibly not Japanese, but she is a brunette and has brown eyes. I\u2019m blonde with blue eyes. Did they jut think we were cool or cute or something? It was very weird, and as someone with social anxiety I was, and still am, a little freaked out.\n\nEdit: thank you all! I feel a lot less weirded out!",

My male Japanese friend told me afterwards that it was normal, that I\u2019m basically something they\u2019ve never seen before, a unicorn discovery basically. I didn\u2019t mind, it made my day!

They had two small identical-twin boys whom they were toting around town in a double pram. The parents confessed to being slightly stressed out. Of course the kids attracted a ton of attention (to be expected), but there was something about the boys being small and tow-haired and TWO OF THEM that short-circuited the usual Japanese reserve. Lots of people were so overcome with curiosity that they moved forward and actually touched the boys without permission \u2014 something normally unheard of. (Of course, in retrospect it could have been Chinese tourists that the couple assumed were Japanese, but this happened back when the # of tourists from mainland Asia was much smaller, so I doubt it could account for all the instances.) Anyway, the parents were having to resort to a lot of loud \u201cNo!!!\u201ds and forceful gestures to ensure that others kept their distance. \n\nPeople with fair-haired small children, please take note.",

Then she sped up to talk to our japanese friend and said she wanted my other white friend and I to come to her temple tomorrow for some kind of event. She was fascinated with us and kept pushing for us to come. Then she started saying she would pay us both to come and pulled out a wad of yen totalling about $2500 USD. \n\nAfter that we started getting a bit worried and said thank you but no we were leaving tomorrow. She kept insisting we take the money, it was in my hand at one point but we kept saying no thank you. We got back to our guest house with this lady still following us. We decided to tell our host so she went out and talked to the lady and told her we were not interested and that she needed to leave. Then she kept giving the money to the host to give to us. I could tell the host was getting very nervous and ended up phoning the police. The lady left finnaly but in the morning our host would not let us walk to the train, she said it was not a good idea. We safely made it to the train and never had another issue. We still have no idea what that was all about.

The only reason I really said yes was because it was unexpected, and we were also in Disney (I was dressed cute like one of my favorite characters). If someone had asked me at the mall or something, I probably would have said no. I\u2019ll keep that in mind!",

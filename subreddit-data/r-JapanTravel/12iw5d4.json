Missed out both of these because we went for pancakes on my last day and the place was booked out for the full day already.\n\nObviously the pancakes one depends on where you go. We went to the one advertised by Paolo in one of his youtube videos.\n\nTeamlab Planets was booked out a few days ahead as well.",

    "postText": "Hi all, would love some feedback on a quick trip to Osaka. We land at KIX in the late afternoon and are staying a few minutes walk from JR Namba Station.\n\nFor context, we're traveling with a one year old so we're trying to not cram too much into each day.\n\n**Night 1:** Wander around Dotonbori after dropping off stuff at our accommodation.\n\n**Day 1:** Spend the morning in Nara, then head over to Daimaru Umeda dept. store in the afternoon. \n\n**Day 2:** Kuromon Market followed by Amerikamura for the thriftshop/vintage stores. \n\n**Day 3:** We fly out of KIX in the morning, so checkout and head straight to the airport. \n\n**A few general questions:** \n\nHow does the plan look so far? We're interested in visiting Amerikamura because we saw there are a lot of thriftshops/vintage shops in the area, but if you have any suggestions we would love to hear them.\n\nFor the evening on Day 2, we currently have revisiting Dotonbori on the agenda, but I would love any suggestions for alternatives! We're interested in trying street food and stalls, preferably within walking distance from JR Namba Station.\n\nOur stroller is collapsible and we'll be using a baby carrier, so hopefully no issues on the train -- but how stroller friendly is walking in Osaka? \n\nThank you in advance!",

So I'm planning to travel there from Tokyo, leave my stuff at the train station, and enjoy the park (will book ticket when it becomes available in August). Would it be too much if I left the park in the late afternoon, get back to the train station, and continue onward to Osaka, where I'll spend the night?\n* I left 2 days buffer in case any of the transportation in Hachijojima/Aogashima (plane, ferry, helicopter) has an issue due to weather. In case nothing happens, I will use the 2 days as buffer in the hectic days 15-20.\n* Is my schedule in days 15-20 too much? The target locations are the types where overnight seems to be enough I think?\n* I'm planning to buy a tent and a sleeping bag in Tokyo, as it seems to be cheaper than renting multiple times across the country. Would it cause offence if I wanted to donate them to the hostel at the end of the trip? I don't want to carry them back home.\n* Am I making a mistake by skipping the most popular attractions (most Tokyo attractions, Kyoto, Nara, Hakone, Miyajima) and going for hard to reach places?",

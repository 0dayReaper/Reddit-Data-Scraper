    "postText": "So sorry if this comes off as a silly question, but I'm just unsure on what to do with myself.\n\nHopefully next year I plan to visit Japan, and try and haul myself up Mount Fuji. Kind of daunting.\n\nAnd I'm just trying to think. I get to the bottom the morning after descent, I find the way back to the hotel and shower, change clothes, then...\n\nSit by Lake Kawaguchi doing little \n\ndo like a half day at FujiQ maybe.\n\nPack up try and get to the next destination \n\nIdk.\n\nI imagine you're anywhere between exhausted or on a high from the night before. And yeah, I've never done something on this scale before.",

There will likely be dozens of other people with you, every step of the way,  you won\u2019t really get a feeling of tranquility, or even of accomplishment because of that.\n\nMaybe climb mount Ashitaka and get a view of Mount Fuji, which would be a lot more serene as it is one of the most aesthetically pleasing places on earth.\n\nAlthough the commonly repeated proverb is \u201ca wise man, climbs Mount Fuji once. A fool climbs at twice.\u201d",

Like someone else said, it's pretty easy and there will be plenty of people. Of course train for it a bit. But I wouldn't worry too much about being exhausted the next day.",

I wouldn\u2019t plan on moving destinations. You\u2019ll want a big meal and a nap and probably a bath. So rocking some onsen or something along those lines would probably be a good plan.",

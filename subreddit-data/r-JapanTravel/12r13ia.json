When I made this post around 3:20PM EST it was working. Seems like Mastercard and American Express are back to being the only ones working. :(",

I have 2 cards without foreign transaction fees but they are both Visa. Never occurred to me there would be a problem with Visa. \nI was really hoping to avoid the hassle of ATM withdrawals and Suica cash reloads. Just seems like a waste of valuable time on vacation to move money around manually.  \nI wonder if I can preload funds in Suica in the Apple Wallet before I leave?

I was so adamant about not trying to reload a Suica using cash and having to use ATMs that I tried once a day for 2 weeks straight until it finally worked with my Visa.\n\nI'll be forced to reload using cash if I end up somehow expending all 5,000 Yen I have on my Suica but at least I have a solid buffer for now. \n\n&gt;I wonder if I can preload funds in Suica in the Apple Wallet before I leave?

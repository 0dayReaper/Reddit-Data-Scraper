Company is always fun, so if it works out to join along please respond, plus we don't speak any Japanese. This will be our 2nd time there though.\n\nWe are automotive and motorcycle enthusiasts, and we're also into hard rock and metal music. We both like anime, but I watch way more. Also, gunpla. Anyway....\n\n15th and 16th are both stays in Kyoto, planning on going to the train museum, Toei and Fushimiinari. \n17th we were planning on going Suzuka Circuit and should be in Hammamatsu at night. \n18th we were going to be in the Hakone area and checking out the evangelion areas and eating those black eggs. Then getting to our last place in Shinjuku.\n19th we were renting a GTR and AE86 to drive to Tskuba and drive a few roads. It would be amazing if we could drive together. Also planning on going to an UP GARAGE  during this time to see if there's anything for our cars and motorcycles at home. \n20th is our \"open\" day;sti gallery, small worlds gundam base and anything else. \n21st is when we will be going home but still would be cool to find maybe one last interesting place in the morning.\n\nHopefully, one of the nights go to a local bar or do Karaoke. My wife isn't into it, so I need a singing partner\ud83d\ude05.",

My main focus of this vacation besides de stressing from my job is to explore Japanese culture both traditional and modern, which is why I\u2019m hoping to visit some museums (Moro Art Museum, Tokyo Met Art Museum or Tokyo National Museum), temples (Senso-Ji, Zojo-Ji), and a lot of shrines (Hanazono, Nezu, Meiji Jingu, Koami, Inarikio, whatever shrines I stumble into).\n\nI don\u2019t drink alcohol, but I am looking forward to checking out Tokyo\u2019s culinary scene, especially the Sushi and Izakaya places, and even quirkier places like maid cafes. I\u2019m also cool with exploring different parts of Tokyo and choosing random restaurants or stalls to get food from. So if you want a new buddy to accompany you on your gastronomic journey in Tokyo, I\u2019m glad to be that guy.\n\nAs a gay man, it would also be nice to meet fellow LGBT tourists or locals and explore places in Tokyo that are popular among the LGBT community. I have heard that Shinjuku Nichome is full of establishments catered towards LGBT, so I might briefly check that out, and I\u2019d be eve more glad to make a new friend there.",

I\u2019m mostly interested in eating good food, shopping around, taking pics, hitting up arcades/karaoke, and visiting temples/parks/gardens/aquariums but I\u2019d be down to do all of the touristy things as it is my first time in Japan :) \n\nexcited to hopefully meet ya, explore all the places, and make fun memories together! &lt;3",

Already planning on just seeing the tourist sites by myself but maybe some company could be fun.\n\nThe general gist of me is: work in tech remotely, writing a novel, paint fairly regularly, gym every week, flexible conversationalist, I travel a lot, like last year I was travelling for a quarter of the year. Don't really want to go drinking again, got ripped off already but I'd be down to make good with the daytime.",

Staying in Shibuya for initial few nights before Ueno &amp; then rest of trip.\n\nVery easy going in terms of activities and also looking forward to visiting new places and trying some great food!",

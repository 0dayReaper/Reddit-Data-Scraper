    "postText": "Today\u2019s question is: What is your favorite Golden Week activity?\n\nThe time, when half of Japan goes on holidays, when almost all sightseeing spots within a day trip's radius of Tokyo are insanely crowded and when you'd better avoid the popular entertainment spots.\n\nBut maybe you have found a good way to survive this period, an activity that is best done during this period, or just helps to deal with it.\n\nSo tell us, what is your favorite Golden Week activity.\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

Sure some places are a bit crowded but most people disperse through different cities so what happens is that most of the domestic tourism overlaps those who are not coming because it\u2019s golden week \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd btw, Japan is clearly a big trend in travel for 2023. So I\u2019d just stay elsewhere if you don\u2019t like crowds. Or travel in really low season, probably when it\u2019s too hot or too cold",

When i went to the various pokemon centers in 2018, they were essentially all empty. This week all of them had a 1-3 hours wait time just to get in. Once inside they are so full you can forget about having a browse, way too crowded. Loads of stuff sold out completely. Restaurants all a 15mins to 4 hour wait (for the most popular). I don't recommend golden week at all",

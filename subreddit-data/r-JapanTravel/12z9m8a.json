    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy boyfriend and I will visit Japan for our very first time this November. We have a few questions; most of them I've tried to Google myself, with no avail. I hope you can help us out!\n\nOur plan is the following (dates are written DD-MM):\n\n1. sa 04-11 Arrival - Tokyo\n2. su 05-11 Tokyo\n3. mo 06-11 Tokyo\n4. tu 07-11 Yudanaka\n5. we 08-11 Kanazawa\n6. th 09-11 Takayama (via Shirakawa-go + Gokayama?)\n7. fr 10-11 Takayama\n8. sa 11-11 Kyoto\n9. su 12-11 Kyoto - day trip Arashiyama\n10. mo 13-11 Kyoto\n11. tu 14-11 Kyoto - day trip Nara (or Kyoto - Osaka via Nara?)\n12. we 15-11 Osaka - day trip Himeji + Okayama?\n13. th 16-11 Osaka\n14. fr 17-11 Osaka - day trip Mt. Koya + Wakayama?\n15. sa 18-11 ??\n16. su 19-11 Hakone\n17. mo 20-11 Tokyo - day trip Kamakura (or Hakone - Tokyo via Kamakura?)\n18. tu 21-11 Tokyo - day trip Nikko\n19. we 22-11 Tokyo\n20. th 23-11 Tokyo - Departure \n\nOur interests are food, historical architecture, buzzing trendy neighbourhoods, parks/gardens and anime (Gundam, Ghibli amongst others) and JRPG. We much rather explore 'street culture' and eat street food than go for fancy experiences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe questions I have are:\n\n1. We have one day unplanned. Where would you advice we stay another day?\n2. We're travelling in November: are there highlights we can't visit (Mt. Fuji seems to be closed, for example) or close much earlier? Or highlights which are especially nice in November?\n3. For the day trips to Nara and Kamakura I'm wondering if it's better as a day trip (from Kyoto and Tokyo respectively) or if it's better as a 'transfer'. So from Kyoto, via Nara, to Osaka and from Hakone, via Kamakura, to Tokyo. In the latter scenario I'm wondering if there's luggage storage/lockers at the train stations.\n\nBonus questions (I'm meaning to look up more about this myself, but maybe you can help me out?):\n\n1. Japan rail pass will almost double in price per October 2023. Will it be worth it?\n2. I heard some towns will have one day per week where everything is closed. Which towns and which days?",

            "comment": "&gt;we 15-11 Osaka - day trip Himeji + Okayama?  \nth 16-11 Osaka  \nfr 17-11 Osaka - day trip Mt. Koya + Wakayama?\n\nThose day trips are going to be mostly sitting on trains, I think. Doing Himeji only from Osaka is probably fine. That would be about three hours or so roundtrip. Adding on Okayama adds more than 2 more hours of train time on that day. Similarly, Osaka to Koyasan is over 2 hours each way. Adding Wakayama to that is really pushing it. You won't have time to really see anything while there. Why not just use a hotel/hostel in the places you want to visit on day trips?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We have one day unplanned. Where would you advice we stay another day?\n\nI'd advise you to decompress some of the day trips into that time or add a night to Hakone.\n\n&gt;We're travelling in November: are there highlights we can't visit (Mt. Fuji seems to be closed, for example) or close much earlier? Or highlights which are especially nice in November?\n\nWhat do you mean by closed? You can't climb Mt. Fuji in November, but you can certainly visit the surrounding area and view the mountain. Otherwise, depending on the area, you might see some of the autumn leaves. You will probably be a bit early to see them in Kyoto, where some temples have really vibrant Japanese maple trees, but you could get lucky.\n\n&gt;For the day trips to Nara and Kamakura I'm wondering if it's better as a day trip (from Kyoto and Tokyo respectively) or if it's better as a 'transfer'. So from Kyoto, via Nara, to Osaka and from Hakone, via Kamakura, to Tokyo. \n\nIt depends on how much you plan to do on those days. If you do them as day trips, you need to leave time to travel back each day. I'd probably do them as transfers to reduce the backtracking and overall time spent on trains.\n\n&gt;In the latter scenario I'm wondering if there's luggage storage/lockers at the train stations.\n\nAll major train stations have luggage lockers. They can sometimes fill up, though. My advice would be to pack light. One 30-40 liter backpack should be all you need for such a trip. Alternatively, you can use the Yamato luggage transfer service to send your luggage from one hotel to the next.\n\n&gt;I heard some towns will have one day per week where everything is closed. Which towns and which days?\n\nIn my experience, this isn't determined by a town, but by each business owner. If there are must-see or must-eat places on your itinerary, I suggest you research ahead of time to see what their days and hours of operation are and plan accordingly.",

            "comment": "JR pass would still be worth it considering all train tickets are getting a price hike. \n\nSince you are only going in November, you can buy it at the current price in October before the price increases (keep tabs on this) and  have up to a month from purchasing before you have to activate it.\n\nConsider the option of e-sim vs pocket Wi-Fi\u2026 both work great but the latter is just another thing to carry around, keep charged (and recharge as they rarely last a full day), pick up and deliver. It\u2019s a money saver though if you\u2019re a group of more than 2 people and/or have many devices.\n\nYou could stay in a temple in Koyasan on the 15th if that tickles your pickle? Ryokan-esque experience with ascetic monk food, morning prayer to observe, the cemetery and whatnot.\n\nNara is a very short day trip from both Kyoto and Osaka - it\u2019s like 35 mins from Kyoto station. It\u2019ll definitely fill your morning and afternoon but IMO you can experience most of it in the one day. Most stations have luggage lockers. You could totally leave Kyoto early and go into Nara, leave your stuff in a locker and see what the town is all about then back to the station and on to your next hotel in Osaka.",

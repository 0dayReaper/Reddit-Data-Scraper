    "postText": "Hi, I consulted a proxy service about some event tickets.After taking a look, we decided it would be better to wait until I\u2019m in Japan with a Japanese sim so she can transfer e-tickets (less likely to be rejected at the door).\n\nShe then asked if she can send an invoice for 5000 yen which will go to tickets if I end up purchasing and will be used as a fee for her time if I don\u2019t.\n\nTo me, this is a little odd. I mean, I haven\u2019t purchased anything yet and such a fee would be unusual where I\u2019m from. So I\u2019m not sure how to respond. But I was thinking maybe it is a cultural thing and normal practice in Japan. Any thoughts?",

            "comment": "So depending on the event this may be helpful, or not.\nI have used a company called buysumotickets in Japan on many occasions to get me tickets to pro wrestling and sumo events. They also get tickets for other sports and concerts.\nPre covid they would get the physical tickets and ship them to me in Australia and I would then take them on my trip. In February just gone they were not doing international shipping so I got them sent to my hotel a few days before I arrived and the hotel had them for me when I checked in. Very common and safe option.\nTickets would have a small fee added for the cost of them getting them for me but always very reasonable in my opinion as I had no other way of getting them especially if they were a pre sale for Japan only fan clubs or exclusive pre sales for say Lawson or 7/11 or loppi.\nThey have a bunch of popular events on their site available for immediate order or you can email a certain event and they will see if they can get it. Also pre sales can be done but be aware they are not a ticket selling agent they are a shopping service so there is no %100 guarantee of getting the tickets you want. A refund is given if it's not possible to get or partial refund if you choose to get lower class tickets.\nI have personally used these guys many times and will again and had fantastic communication and service.\nMaybe something to look at.\nHope this helps.",

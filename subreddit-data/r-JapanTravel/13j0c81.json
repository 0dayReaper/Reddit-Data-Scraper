    "postText": "Guys can anybody help pls. We did a one day trip to yakushima today. At the last minute our flight got cancelled. We are travelling with literally nothing cause we wanted to fly back on the same day. Does anybody know any possibility to get a charger in yakushima or around airport? We cant even set an alarm if we dont get an charger soon\n\n\nEdit: we got an personal assistance at the airport. A guy called Takahashi i think. What a hero this guy was. He drove us with his private car to the next open supermarket, helped us find the stuff we need and brought us to our hotel he found for us. We woke up the next day at 5am, to reach as first one at the Anbo port. Only 20 seats were available(online not included) and we were the person 12 and 13. We really got one and arrived at Kagoshima the next day\ud83e\udef6",

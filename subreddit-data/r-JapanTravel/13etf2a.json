    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019m trying to book the saphir odoriko train from Atami to Tokyo at the end of the month and I\u2019m struggling to figure it all out. we have the JR pass and I\u2019m wondering does this mean we get a discount on the base fare and just have to pay the premium? Im confused because it seems impossible to book the saphir odoriko on the JR pass booking website the saphir train doesn\u2019t even come up as a option. I tried to book through the JR east website and the only option is to buy the tickets at full price with no discount or to book with a JR east pass for a discount but the full JR pass is not an option on the JR east website if I want the discount will I have to book in person at the station? Thanks in advance for any help!",

Otherwise, JR Pass will just cover the base fare and Saphir Odoriko can't be booked online.\n\nThis is the same situation as with non-*nobi nobi* seats on Sunset Seto/Izumo, except that JR West website accounts for the situation, where the base fare might be already covered.",

You need to do purchase ticket then when the saphir odoriko option appears, choose the \u2018purchase tickets such as the super (limited) express train ticket only\u2019 option since the ordinary jr pass already covers the base fare.",

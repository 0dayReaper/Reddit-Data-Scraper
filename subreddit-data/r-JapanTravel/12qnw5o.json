    "postText": "This group has been super helpful in planning my trip, so I would like to share my experience :)\n\nSorry it's turned so wordy. I try to keep my tips highlighted if you want to skip the wordy parts. I applaud you if you do read it all!\n\nTravelled with my boyfriend from March 31st (arriving at Haneda April 1st) to April 13 (early morning).\n\n* April 1st - 3rd: Tokyo, a small hotel in Ginza (if I remember correctly, we are not supposed to name hotels, right?).\n\nWe were pretty groggy after over 13 hours on the plane, we flew with ANA and it was a nice experience. We had security exist seats booked, so we could stretch our legs. Another nice feature of the plane (Dreamliner) were the windows which could be dimmed. The best part were the flight attendants, they were super attentive and even wrote us a note with restaurant recommendations. The downside were the hard seats. Somehow they were much harder than other seats I've had on long haul flights. But that's really a minor nuisance.\n\nArrival at Haneda went smooth. I read some people had bad luck and lined up for hours. We had our QR codes ready right after getting off the plane, someone divided people into 2 lines, one for QR-holders and one for those that needed to do the whole online process onsite. We were through the sizeable line (a few large planes had arrived at the same time) within 30 - 40 minutes, then went to pick up our PocketWifi and took the train to Ginza. We didn't bother with picking up our JR Passes at the airport due to the insane line, we picked it up at Ueno station where there was only a short line at a later time.\n\n**My tip:** have all your QR codes ready as soon as you get off the plane. I hear soon the Covid pass won't even be necessary anymore, but the other 2 codes will still be required. Also, don't bother with the JR pass here. We had pre-charged SUICA cards ready, so all we needed to do was figure out where to get off the train.\n\nWe were surprised at just how tiny standard Japanese hotel rooms are, we had 2 large suitcases. It wasn't a big issue, but be prepared and maybe try to pack smarter than we did. Luckily our AirBnb allowed us to spread out more and we could stow the suitcases under our bed in the last hotel. Large suitcases are definitely not handy here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* April 3rd - 8th: Kyoto, AirBnb\n\nShinkansen are the best! My boyfriend works for our national railway, and he never stopped being amazed at the Japanese railway system. I would recommend anyone to use the shinkansen at least once. We didn't see much of Fuji on the way to Kyoto, he was hiding behind a single cloud Q\\_Q but hey, we got to see him later on, so all is good. We bought some conbini food prior to getting on the train, I am a bit sad we never tried a real ekiben, but we grew quickly addicted to onigiri lol. Were you in a rush and only got to your quai last second? No problem, there is probably a conbini right there! The only thing to keep in mind is, trash cans are sparse. I always had a lunch box with me to keep the food crisp, but it doubled as a mobile trash container too. We were also amazed at how clean the stations were. If someone asks me what I miss the most, the answer is Japanese public transit and toilets. Except for one station, we always saw those lovely heated toilets... What a bliss!\n\nKyoto was totally overloaded. I guess it always is, but I read some comments that it was especially bad this season. Everyone and their mother and greatgrandmother were in Kyoto, many of them donning gorgeous kimono. I was bummed, because I hadn't had any restaurant bookings ready, so we missed out on a few good food opportunities. Also we only spent one day in Kyoto proper despite spending 5 nights. We did go to Gion area 3 evenings, but it was always too crowded to be enjoyed (for our standards). We walked nearly 20km in Kyoto that day (starting with Fushimi Inari), and we were just exhausted. Didn't take a single bus there, instead, we had an airbnb right by Tofukuji station (there are also restaurant and shops around here, it feels more gritty but quite fun) so we just took the train and walked the rest. It was feasable, but my suggestion would be to have more time in Kyoto proper. \n\nWe did daytrips to Hiroshima / Itsukushima and Nara and we spent one day in Arashyiama. All 3 were great day trips. for Itsukushima, check the tide calendar before going! For us, it was best to go in the morning to see the gate in the high tide (awesome!) and we did Hiroshima Peace Memorial after that. We also had Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki and honestly, that is a must! I personally prefer those over Osaka style. For Arashiyama, the bamboo grove is a joke... I thought it would be much bigger and found it pretty lame. But Tenryu-ji, Okochi Sanso Garden and the preserved street made the whole trip more than worth it. Tenryu-ji got crowded but the other two places were nearly empty, which made for a nice change from other busy places we had been to prior. So if you ask me, Arashiyama is still worth a daytrip, just don't expect the bamboo \"forest\" to be a highlight. We didn't do monkeys because we didn't want to deal with crowds or a hike that day (it was after those famous 20km)\n\n**My tips:** reserve seats in every Shinkansen. Sure, it takes away the possibility to just hop on any shinkansen, but the trains got pretty busy and we had our suitcases with us going to Kyoto, so we needed to reserve the baggage area. We printed all our tickets in Arashyiama, because it is a quiet station with no lines. Absolutely do a daytrip to Hiroshima / Itsukushima, it was one of the best days we had all trip. Don't underestimate the walks in Kyoto, have at least 2 days in Kyoto proper, we did not have enough time there. And try to reserve in restaurants. I regret that we didn't get a chance to try Kyoto food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* April 8th - 9th: Hakone, \"ryokan\" Hotel\n\nSome people on here advised me that one day in Hakone is not enough, they were right - mostly because of how late we finally got to \"explore\" Hakone. The buses here take very long to get from Odawara to Owakudani, and because Japanese bus drivers are very mindful to give everyone time to get on an off the bus safely, they cannot be as punctual as the trains. Also, the buses are tiny. We shipped our suitcases straight from Kyoto to Tokyo, so at least we didn't have THAT struggle. \n\nWe had a fancy hotel room booked because I have a full sleeve tattoo and am not permitted in public onsen (at least I couldn't find a single one), but I wanted the experience, so room with onsen bath tub it was. It was money well splurged. The food was not THAT great, though that mostly has to do with us being picky eaters. I can imagine most people were thrilled about grilled Abalone, we were not so much. I had read some complaints online about the food, but it was decent quality. Was it worth the money? Maybe not, but the room was, so I won't complain.\n\nWe only saw Moto Hakone and Amazake Chaya, but we loved both. Weirdly, despite the crowds everywhere else, Amazake Chaya was nearly empty. I guess people don't know about it. It was really fun trying Amazake here and having some mochi, but that mochi sure was filling!\n\nThe next day we only had until 3pm, so we headed straight to Owakudani after breakfast. There we finally got to marvel at Mt Fuji in all his majesty! We also got the famous black eggs - perfect for Easter! We really enjoyed Owakudani and the views. The weather was nice, so we didn't freeze either. We left over 2 hours before our shinkansen in Odaware because as I mentioned, the buses take really long. \n\n**My tips:** don't underestimate travel times in Hakone, it is much bigger than the YouTube videos make it seem. And do go for that onsen experience, it's really worth it. If you want Kaiseki, I suggest you rather go to a proper ryokan, so you can have a more intimate experience. If you want a luxurious room however, the big hotels with their private onsen rooms are for you. We have no regrets after all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* April 9th - 13th: Tokyo again, Hotel in Iidabashi\n\nWhy choose a hotel in Iidabashi? It was a recommendation by someone who had visited Tokyo a few times. It's not on the Yamanote line, but if you're getting a 72-h-ticket for Tokyo Metro, it's perfect (that's the ticket we got, duh). The hotel was close to both Iidabashi and Suidabashi stations, so we got to everywhere easily. The other nice thing: Iidabashi is - bar the salarypeople - pretty quiet. There is life in the evening around Suidabashi West entrance and Tokyo Dome, we had good Okonomiyaki in one restaurant there, but it's not overwhelming as far as night crowds can go. Nice to know: there is a good breakfast spot on the corner of Tokyo Dome and Iidabashi station, next to Starbucks. By far the best croissants I have ever had! It's pricier, but it was worth it to us. There is also a Jump Store if you are into manga and anime, probably the nicest Jump Store we have been to.\n\nDuring our last days in Japan, we visited Shinjuku (the only \"dirty\" area we saw), Shibuya (the scramble was not so crazy in the morning, but still really cool to see), Ikebukuro (Sunshine City is now my favorite mall worldwide!), Akihabara, Harajuku, the area around the Imperial Palace and Azabu Juban (because I am a Sailor Moon fan, and I wanted to get my fill of Tokyo Tower views). We had done Asakusa and Tokyo Skytree on our first stay in Tokyo, so I think we did see a whole lot. We didn't rush anyhwere either. I am sad we didn't get to see Odaiba, that's top 1 when we go again.\n\nThe trip back was... a trip. 15 hours. We flew over the Northern Pole! We did fly Lufthansa and because it was a code share with ANA, we didn't get to pick seats on this leg of the journey. Do not recommend. The seats were more comfortable but staff was unfriendly (this was not my first time experiencing this with Lufthansa on a long haul flight either) and the way we were treated in Munich was just despicable. Do try to get your chosen seats on both ways, 15 hours with a moody kid jamming his seat against your knees is not fun, even less so when staff doesn't even bother to ask people to put seats upright during lunch or turbulence. It didn't ruin the trip, but it was quite bothersome.\n\n**My tips:** if you are using the metro a lot (we did), go for the day passes. There are 24, 48 and 72 hour passes. They don't work on every line, I think it didn't work on the Yamanote line. Also try to avoid rush hour. We did get into rush hour once or twice and while it wasn't as bad as I feared (I have a fear of crowds in tight spaces), it was far from pleasurable. Absolutely try the varieties of ramen. We went to 3 different spots. My favorite is tonkatsu, but we had really awesome miso ramen in one place in Iidabashi too. Do your big shopping during your last days. Shipping stuff around is fun, but if you listen to my \"pack small\" advice from above, your shopping might not fit and you'll need another suitcase. You can get good value suitcases in Ginza Karen - they specialize in selling suitcases to shopping tourists. You won't mind another suitcase for the last night or two in your room, but it would be annoying to log it around the entire trip, and shipping can get pricey depending on size and item number. The yen was also pretty weak during our trip, so we did not hold back. Gotta help that Japanese economy ;)\n\n**Extra tip for figure hunters:** your itinerary should be as follows: Ikebukuro Lashinbang and Mandarake plus whichever other figure shops you spot around here, then the smaller figure shops around Akihabara plus Lashinban and Mandarake here, and only THEN Radio Kaikan and Akihabara gamers. Prices vary like crazy, it is worth digging around, but the places I listed first were the most affordable ones.\n\n**Final words:** we loved our trip to Japan and I am already plotting on when I can go back. I am still having that post-travel blues, but I wouldn't want to miss it. The only annoying thing were the tourists. I am probably preaching to the choir but please, be mindful of each other. We are all excited to see Japan, so let's respect the premises, the locals and other tourists, it really isn't much to ask. If you show some respect, the people here treat you with amazing kindness :) We will be back for sure, but probably during a different season. Thank you, sakura, you were gorgeous, even though we got there late!",

I would suggest getting the Hakone Free Pass. We did not buy it because I mistakenly thought it wouldn't be worth it. We took a bus from Odawara to Kowakien, I forgot which one it was, so we just asked every bus driver. The bus going to Owakudani passes Kowakien. It's quite a long bus ride and it's uncomfortable because buses are small. They're also pricey if you don't have the Hakone Free Pass... Everything is doable by bus though, but keep in mind it gets really busy and the bus stops everywhere and takes its time. So calculate for lots of time going places. If I were to go back to Hakone, I'd visit the Open Air museum, spend more time in Moto Hakone (which is where you can visit the lake, get a beautiful view of Mt. Fuji if it's a clear day, do the boat tour, walk to the shrine...) and visit all the local craft and souvenir shops :) Do not miss out on Owakudani though! If you're not afraid of hights, you can take the cable car :)",

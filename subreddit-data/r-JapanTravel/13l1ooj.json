            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI hope this is OK to ask, but why not just fly from Sapporo to Osaka (KIX or Itami) or even to Chubu in Nagoya or Kobe if your end goal is to go to Kyoto.  There are 6 flights a day just to Kobe and even more to Itami, KIX and Chubu.  If you're paying for a flight any way, why not go closer to where you want to be?  Itami is the closest to Kyoto.  It would be much faster than going to Haneda or Narita first.\n\nIn terms of your questions:\n\nI've never seen bears in Japan.  I'm also not a huge hiker.  I have seem multiple bear crossing and beware of bear signs.   I use to live in a part of the US where black bears were seen on a regular basis, and thankfully never saw one there too.  In general, bears are put off by people and being loud and noisy so you don't surprise a bear is the easiest way to avoid bears.\n\nThe obvious answer for Sendai is making a day trip to Matsushima.  The pine islands should be quite nice in early November.  I've gone in mid-late October.\n\nI've also been to Aoba Castle ruins and Zuihoden Mausoleum. The Sendai Mediatheque, building is supposed to be interesting if you like modern architecture.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by fill up.  You get back to Tokyo sometime on the 3rd, have all day on the 4th and most of the day on the 5th.  It's really like 2 days maybe 2.5  Though I would think you would want to spend as long in Nikko as you could.  If you do that and then on the 4th visit Sendai, you really just have the 5th, your last day in Japan.\n\nI think November is a little early for strawberries.  We went in late December and we were just at the start of the season.  January-March is the big strawberry season in Japan.\n\nWhether you need a pass in Nikko or not depends on how you plan to get there and how you plan to get around.\n\nJapan Guide does a great job describing the various passes and offerings.\n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358\\_002.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358_002.html)\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by desolate with Izu.  If you mean few rail networks, sure.\n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6310.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6310.html)\n\nHere are some activities, though you are not there that long because you have to get there from Osaka on 10/31 and then you check out on 11/1 and start heading to Nikko\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Seems kind of busy for honeymoon, but that's up to you two.\n\n1. Fall foliage can vary by some number of weeks either direction. The chances it's going to be near it's peak during your couple days in Nikko might be iffy. A lot of trips organized around that or Sakura tend to have more free schedules to follow according to where it's going to be best, but with your restaurant recommendations, that might be difficult. Nikko is probably most likely to reach it's peak in mid October. The elevation can change by about 2000m, so there is some variance by a couple weeks. If you are looking at hiking (Guessing higher elevations?) November might be too late. You might have better luck at lower reservations at that time of year. \n\n2. Probably pretty rare to see a bear in Nikko, and that's probably if you are getting off the beaten paths and hiking more, which it doesn't sound like you'll do. I've hiked in the alps quite a bit and never seen a bear, the bear bells people carried nearly drove me nuts though. \n\n4. not sure, but you get gyutan a lot of places. If that's the main reason you are going to sendai I'd just skip it. (or the other suggestion sounds interesting, I haven't been). This place was in my old neighborhood and is excellent. https://goo.gl/maps/s4Mm1udrFRRsDDeAA\n\n5. There are 100s or 1000s of things to do in and around Tokyo. Tokyo is big, and it can be crowded, but most people feel that way because they stay around the most crowded stations. They want to see all the bright lights. There are plenty of places were the crowds won't feel oppressive. (Although the trains are often what you can't really get away from)\n\n7. 1000s of unique eats. What do you want? The level of food is very high in Japan in general, one doesn't need to go to specific restaurants in general to get a great meal. \n\n3 days in most of your destinations, only one without travel seems like it's pushing it to me. I'd probably relax some places a bit more. \n\n10/24 you aren't going to get out of Tokyo in the morning with that schedule. \n\nIzu - I tend to see Izu more as a summer place. It's not the fastest place to get in and out of and public transportation tends to run much less often. I assume you are going for the fall colors? I'd be tempted to take the time here and spend it other cities on your list. \n\nIf you like music, I hear Kyoto has become pretty good for smaller experimental bands.  \n\nRelated to that, with your scheduled I'm not sure I'd plan to go Nara, you are just so tight already, spending another couple hours on the train to see more temples doesn't seem worth it. Just stay another day in Kyoto instead and see all the temples you are missing there. Kobe doesn't have anything more interesting to offer than Osaka, especially as you don't have the time to really even explore Osaka as it is.",

                    "comment": "For the fall foliage, I was going off the Japan travel page! It\u2019s difficult now to rebook that area unless I get a random hotel . This Airbnb we have seems promising, but things can be moved around. \n\nGood to know on the lack of bear! Lol\n\nOk will take Sendai off lol that\u2019s just my gluttonous self talking. Ty for the rec! \n\nI do recall some parts of Tokyo being a bit slower, but yah maybe for the most part, we were in a very crowded area during Sakura season . \n\nLmao the ryokan part is without travel, def more for relaxation only if for a day.\n\nSpeaking of travel, would you happen to know anything about Yufu/beppu? That area piqued my interest more for ryokan, but not sure how difficult it would be to get there from Osaka station, then fly to haneda after for Nikko. Is this like a wild unicorn I\u2019m chasing ..\n\n only thing I really need in Tokyo is parla crepe, jiromaru, egg salad sandwiches, and  teamlabs lol sorry, I should have mentioned that\n\nTy for the note on Kyoto music! Just hard to get actual event info lol\n\nI did two separate hotels for Kyoto + Osaka because there was a lack of availability on Airbnb for 5 days that fit the criteria lol I can try looking again tho! Unless we just grab some random hotel\n\nUnique eats as in fav foods * \n\nThanks so much!",

                            "comment": "For Tokyo, Yanaka is fun place for the afternoon (dead during the evening). Ebisu is still kind of crowded, but less so then Shinjuku or Shibuya and you'll get better food and drinks in that area. Also try out the Kagurazaka area, good restaurants around there too.\n\nI've been to Yufuin and Beppu. It's really nice, but you have to like hot springs and getting naked with everyone else. It's not really the type of place you'd go to only to use a bath attached to your room. I consider it kind of 'high level' onsens. Smaller neighborhood ones can even have the changing rooms (men and sometimes even women) visible from the outside. One mud onsen we went to didn't have a wall between the women's and men's bath area, just a floating piece of bamboo. There are some 'safer' places of course and kashikiri baths, but I suggest you be comfortable with onsens before you go to get the most out of that area. You'll probably want to fly in and fly out, but I'm not really sure how you'd fit it into your schedule. I'd probably give it two full days, more if you want to hit both areas, but I'd say that about most of the cities you are going to.\n\nCrepes seem like they are everywhere in Japan although that looks a bit unique. I'm not really into them myself. Jirumaru is just a yaki-niku place? It looks like it might be fun. I'd prefer to sit down for yakiniku rather than stand, and for good meat, make sure you don't overcook it. I'd probably recommend teppanyaki someplace that will cook it properly for you if it you want it at it's best.\n\nEgg sandwiches aren't anything too special and you'll find them all over at cafes. You can probably search google for Egg Sandwich, but do check the photos. or \u5375\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9 (tamago sando), will get you a bit better results. Unless there is someplace in Tokyo you just have to get them, try out a few cafes during your trip. Teamlabs... take or leave it I guess, but it seems like the must-do item on everyone's lists right now.\n\nI don't have a site for you on live music right now, but do a bit of searching can you can probably find information. Tokyo, sangenjaya, is another area with a lot of small-ish bars and tons of live houses. You'd probably enjoy. Osaka has it's live house scene too.\n\nIt can be beneficial to have a hotel in Kyoto, just because you want to get to some spots at like 7am to avoid the crowds. The bamboo grove in particular comes to mind, if it's on your must-go list. Arrive there by 8am and you are already late. You can make the trip from Osaka, but you'll have 30+ minutes being in Kyoto. I'd plan early starts when you are staying there. Make sure the place you want to visit it open.\n\nWhen I first started living here I looked a lot for Japanese food, but in the end the number of good restaurants are endless. It can be a bit difficult recommending some places, as they don't have english menus, speak english and only take cash. I've brought people visiting before to my favorite places and kind of irritated the owners some (too noisy, too many questions or demands on the food). In the end though, there will be a place down the street also serving a similar menu that's also amazing. Get out of the tourists areas a bit and you'll get better food for better prices and if you are feeling adventurous avoid the chain stores go for the privately owned places. Try what they serve. Omakase-kudasai. - kind of chefs choice, can help some if English is a problem and most places will make up some dishes to serve.\n\nMost of my specific restaurant choices are all based around foreign food, as that's what you end up craving after being here for twenty years and the best places are far less common. American BBQ, philly cheesesteaks, a proper meatball sub. Mexican food that doesn't have ketchup on it. Good german fare. Italian places that can get pasta right (pizza is much easier to find). Sri-lanka curry, Vietnamese food, good greek food, etc etc.\n\nMaybe try Tonkatsu Tonki in Meguro. I really like that place and it's fun to watch them in the open kitchen. No reservations, you'll wait until seats open up, but they'll take your order when you enter. Hire-katsu (less fat) or roast-katsu (rosu-katsu) (more fat), or kushi-katsu (probably wouldn't recommend for your first time there). Definitely take seats on the first floor, not the second.\n\nSandwiches, one of my go-to lunch places was always Little KOIWAI in the second basement (B2) of the Otemachi Building in Otemachi (west side of Tokyo Station).[https://goo.gl/maps/LM6fMMeJPDVVivPi](https://goo.gl/maps/LM6fMMeJPDVVivPi9) You'd have an adventure just finding it. Only go on a weekday if you do try to find it, that area is pretty dead on weekends outside of fancier shops and restaurants. I'm not even sure if they are open on the weekends. They'll definitely have egg sandwitches if they aren't sold out, along with other very unique options.\n\nIf you enjoy nihonshu, I recommend Suzuden, 5-8pm on weekdays, standing area. Yes, narrow opening and might look intimidating, go in, everyone there is nice. Early is better, I wouldn't bother if you arrive much after 7pm. [https://goo.gl/maps/8yYFqF5Q1r1n2N6E7](https://goo.gl/maps/8yYFqF5Q1r1n2N6E7)\n\nA few of the Japanese places I might have recommended seem to have closed or changed a bit since I last went. not sure I want to recommend them ATM.",

            "comment": "There are soooooo many great hotels all throughout Japan.  My go to hotel chains are Daiwa Roynet, Mitsui Garden, Candeo, Cross Hotels, and Hotel MyStays.  These have larger rooms/bathrooms and often nice, big tubs.  I always use the filters in a site like Booking to limit results by rooms with a private bathroom and with a bathtub.  After walking upwards of 20,000 steps each day sightseeing you will want/need to take a long/hot shower or bath to relax sore muscles.  Prioritize being close to a station and size of room/bathroom. The cheapest hotels are very, very tiny.  \n\nETA 2: For families, the Daimaru Hotel chains or Oakwood Residences are apartment style. \n\nETA: I prefer hotels over Air BnBs hands down as they are usually closer to the station and almost all have baggage delivery service at the front desk.  Hotels will also store your luggage for free if you arrive before checkin time or want to still sightsee nearby after you checkout.   Takes away the hassle/cost of trying to find large luggage lockers at train stations.  This is true for hostels and capsule hotels too.  They may not offer luggage delivery or free storage of bags before/after checkin/out.  \n\nFor where to stay in Kyoto I prefer the Gion/Higashiyama area as you\u2019re then walkable to so many other sites and restaurants.  Kyoto Station is actually a bit inconvenient in terms of walkability to sightseeing spots.  We loved the Hotel Granbell in Kyoto as a couple.  In Osaka I like staying in the Namba/Dotombori area for similar reasons. We loved the Cross Hotel in Osaka. Shin-Osaka where the Shinkansen station is I don\u2019t love staying in as it\u2019s more of an office/mall area so not as fun at night.  Though not bad if you just need a place to crash before an early morning Shinkansen departure.  Hiroshima I like staying near the station as it\u2019s easy to use the [sightseeing loop bus (covered by JR Pass)](https://en.japantravel.com/hiroshima/hiroshima-s-meipuru-pu-sightseeing-bus/69583) to get around. \n\nFor where to stay in Tokyo, I love staying in Akasaka.  Near 3 metro stations, lots of great restaurants and bars, and a nightlife vibe without the overwhelming nature of Shinjuku.  Lots of hotels in this area too at a range of price points.  I really think it\u2019s a hidden gem of a neighborhood to stay in Tokyo. Not as convenient if you\u2019re trying to optimize a JR pass though.  \n\n- [Hie Shrine](https://maps.google.com?g_st=ic)\n- [Thousand Toriis at Hie (great photos at night)](https://maps.google.com?g_st=ic)\n- [Toyokawa Inari Betsuin (great at night too)](https://maps.google.com?g_st=ic)\n- [State Guesthouse Akasaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yTMMP3woyRDdgqZ6?g_st=ic)\n- [Dobrogi Hungarian Bar and Grill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tFYWLHnqPt6dwccMA?g_st=ic)\n- [Streamer Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/shbPNf8hYANMQgRj7?g_st=ic)\n- [Champagne and Gyoza Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EW7xecSMPaUHXowQ6?g_st=ic)\n- [Tebasaki Original](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5agSBtXtZucfvjpS8?g_st=ic)\n\nAnd soooo many more restaurants in the area too.  Just put Akasaka into the area search on Booking or other sites and you\u2019ll find a huge range of hotel options in this area.  If I were to ever live in central Tokyo I\u2019d probably look at this neighborhood seriously for convenience, price, restaurants, and amenities like kids parks. \n\n- [Tokyo Chapter: Akasaka With Kids](https://www.thetokyochapter.com/the-akasaka-area-with-kids/)\n- [Best Living: Akasaka 1-Day Itinerary for Families](https://bestlivingjapan.com/akasaka-area-with-kids/)\n- [Tokyo Chapter: Where to Stay in Tokyo With Kids](https://www.thetokyochapter.com/where-to-stay-in-tokyo-with-small-children/)\n\nOther Tokyo neighborhoods I like are Nihombashi, Ginza, Ueno, Minato, and Asakusa.  I don\u2019t like staying in Shinjuku or Shibuya really as it\u2019s too busy/crowded/loud/bright for me at all times day and night.  I prefer a little calmer vibe at night after a busy day sightseeing.  Tokyo Station is a bit tooooo quiet at night for me as it\u2019s mainly an office area around the station though Kanda is nearby but could be a long walk depending on where your hotel is located.   If you have an early morning Shinkansen departure heading towards Kyoto/Osaka I\u2019d prefer staying near Shinagawa or for an early morning Shinkansen departure heading north towards Tohoku I\u2019d prefer to stay near Ueno. \n\nLots of other specific hotel recommendations in some of my past trip reports. Though I haven\u2019t written reports on all places I\u2019ve been in Japan. \n\n- [Tokyo Day/Overnight Trip: Late Cherry Blossoms in Fuji Five Lakes Area](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/moqcwv/cherry_blossoms_in_fuji_five_lakes_dayovernight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Tokyo Day/Overnight Trip: Early February Cherry Blossoms on Izu Peninsula](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mlugpb/early_cherry_blossoms_in_the_izu_peninsula_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Tokyo Overnight Trip: Tattoo Friendly Kusatsu Onsen (Gunma)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/meafbh/trip_report_kusatsu_onsen_in_gunma/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Kansai Side Trip: Tattoo Friendly Kinosaki Onsen and Himeiji Castle](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/sna5au/kansai_side_trip_tattoo_friendly_kinosaki_onsen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Summer Long Weekend in Matsumoto and Waterfalls in Norikura (Nagano)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/piyive/summer_weekend_in_matsumoto_and_waterfalls_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Takayama: Autumn Weekend (Gifu)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mg8ir9/autumn_weekend_in_takayama_gifu_prefecture/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Snow Weekend in Nozawa Onsen](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/t33lt8/snow_weekend_in_nozawa_onsen_nagano/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [5-day Road Trip to Noto Peninsula (Ishikawa) and Toyama Alpine Route](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/o0tn59/road_trip_to_toyama_and_noto_peninsula_ishikawa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Fukushima: Samurai History and Painted Candle Illumination in Aizuwakamatsu (mid-Feb)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/metuf4/samurai_history_in_aizuwakamatsu_in_fukushima/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n- [Aomori/Akita: Cherry Blossoms and Samurai History using the 5-day JR East Tohoku Pass](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/nahtfk/chasing_cherry_blossoms_in_aomori_and_samurai/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

                    "comment": "We liked the APA hotels but didn't like that the APA president said about Jewish people is pretty fucked up and the denialism of Japanese war crimes is pretty fucked. \n\nSo we went to some other hotels. \n\nHere's our reviews for our trip. \n\n1. Tavinos Asakusa - Hotel is clean, the check in and check out process was a little annoying as it's on the 2nd floor so you had to take the elevator to the 2nd floor. The elevators ALWAYS stop on the second floor so that was really annoying. The room was basically a \"queen size bed\" and a window mental. Queen size in quotes because it was 2 twin pushed together with it's own bedding for each. Basically the edge of the bed was a wall on both sides. Under the bed was luggage storage and you had maybe 3 feet from the foot of the bed to the door. The washroom was surprisingly long and a full stand shower. I'm 6' and I was fine. The amenities were weak. Hotel was about 10 minute walk from Asakusa Station. Was a 5 minute walk to Asakusa ROX. Another issue was that there's a lot of groups that stay here. It was non-stop busy. \n\n2. Tune Stay Kyoto - Hotel is very hipster. 20 dollar Gin tasting, 5pm short film festival every night, 24h laundry/kitchen in the basement, and the staff's english is decent. We got the double bunk bed which means the room was narrow. Washroom was full sized as I was able to stand fine in them. The Aircon didn't work that well because it kept resetting the fan location. I was in the top bunk and after an hour it would just blow 100% of the cold air at me. They were having issues with heating and cooling with central air as there was a warning in the elevator. \n\n3. Petit Bali Shinjuku sanchome - It's a love hotel but it's a lot nicer than the other hotels. Room was decently big, in and out privileges (You just gotta give them the key and they give you a ticket). The hotel room had an actual queen size bed, free snacks, water, alcohol, TV with all the porn and movies you wanna watch, The shower was a tad small for me width wise. They had a large jet bath you can use on the 4th floor. It was a little bit more expensive but it was actually very nice. Would book again for sure just as a hotel vs a hotel. It was about 8 minutes from Shinjuku San Chome station. It's actually in a really fun area. \n\n4. Super Hotel Lohas - Ikebukuro - This is a normal Business hotel. The room was small but bigger than tavinos. Actual queen size bed but the shower/washroom was small. The shower would have been fine for me but the bulkhead for the shower was an inch too short so I had to hunch over while I shower trying to avoid getting concussed.  The room was clean the staff is super nice. Free stuff like tooth brush/paste/hair net/green tea/coffee and tea/softdrinks after 5pm/alcohol from 5-9:30pm. For amenities they had a breakfast from 7-9:30 that looked good but we never made it to it. There's a public bath seperated by gender. They had a \"Pillow Bar\" where you can pick an additional specialty pillow. Laundry on  the first floor. I liked it minus to shower but it was a tad far from ikebukuro station. I think it's about a 10-15 minute walk. There is a donki near by. It's on the north east side of Ikebukuro opposite sunshine city.",

In the book, Motoya reiterated his belief that the Nanking Massacre and comfort women were falsehoods created by China and Korea. In addition, he discussed attracting millions of tourists from countries like China and Korea, and said he \"will provide support to the maximum degree\" to the Abe administration which can be used against China and Korea on these historical issues. Some Chinese tourist organizations are boycotting the chain.[13]\n&gt; \n&gt; Antisemitism\n&gt; Motoya believes that \"Jewish capital\" is always in the background of \"American wars, from the Vietnam War to the Iraq War\". According to him,\n&gt; Jewish people control American information, finance, and laws, and they benefit greatly from globalization because they move their massive profits to tax havens so they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes.[14]\n&gt; \n&gt; In reaction to criticism, Motoya apologized and wrote in a following issue of APA magazine:\n&gt; \"I always mean to praise the Jewish people as wise, with excellent skills in the fields of information, finance, and the law. But considering their history of struggle, I decided my statements had gone too far and removed them from the website.\"[15]\n&gt; \n&gt; Motoya is the author of an essay titled: \"Japan Should Use Jewish Marketing Companies to Correct Historical Falsehoods\".[16]\n\nYou could have just typed in \"president of APA\" and gotten this.",

I'm used to paying quite a bit more elsewhere in Tokyo. \n\nIf the area has any downside, I would say its local shopping is lacking; you need to walk a bit to the Ginza side. But transport is awesome, and there are lots of food. My take is that the area is quite a popular area for Japanese workers to have after work food and drinks, so there is a lot of affordable restaurants (not as high end as Ginza). It's not as dense as Shinjuku, so you find a lot of ground floor restaurants... I often struggle to find restaurants in Shinjuku because they are all hidden in multi story buildings and it's hard to figure out they exist, what they sell, and whether or not they have a massive line. If you get the chance, go explore the areas under the train tracks; they've built entire alleyways of restaurants and shops under there. \n\nMy wife is thinking of staying there again whenever we are back in Tokyo, and she's quite hard to please in terms of hotels.",

They\u2019re widely available, the staff are friendly and courteous, and the rooms, while being a little cozy, are comfortable and clean. \n\nBut the things that REALLY keep me coming back are the amenities:\n\n* Free bath/spa access available for most of the day. I took advantage of this at least once a day. Nothing feels better than showering off and hopping into a nice hot bath after a day full of walking. Every location I\u2019ve been to had at least two types of baths (including an outdoor bath), a cold bath, and a sauna. \n\n* Good quality amenities like shampoos, soaps, lotions, etc. \n\n* Free washing machines and cheap driers (100\u00a5/20m)\n\n* Free ramen between 9:30 and 11pm every day. I didn\u2019t always take advantage of this, but it\u2019s just the thing when you\u2019re feeling snacky at night. \n\n* Some locations have extra amenities like free Pocari Sweat in the spa area, free ice cream or Yakult (also by the spa area), a manga library, bike rentals, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve stayed at the locations in Shibuya and Ikebukuro so far, as well as a location in Osaka. I also stayed at some other hotels I was really looking for on my most recent trip, including Candeo Hotels, but none of them were quite as enjoyable as staying at Dormy Inn. \n\nThe price per night will differ depending on where you\u2019re staying and at what time of year, but for reference, I was able to book a room for 2 in Ikebukuro during the recent Sakura season for around $88USD per night. Other locations may be more expensive. I\u2019d have a look and see if it works for you. \n\nAs for the ones I\u2019ve stayed in in Tokyo, the Shibuya location is GREAT for its proximity to the subway and just generally being a great launch point to most other parts of Tokyo. I was also pleasantly surprised by Ikebukuro. I didn\u2019t know anything about it before my last trip, but found it had a fairly nice night life and lots of dining and shopping options. Sunshine City nearby is also a cool place to shop and spend time.",

It was pretty fun experience (futons and the style in general; can't comment on \"hostel community\", not my thing) and despite being there during summer, it never got super hot (and the room had AC in any case). The owner spoke quite good English too. Location is calm, but close to Ginza line and Tsukuba Express line. Ton of restaurants in the area too. And the somewhat famous Benitsuru pancake shop is literally around the corner.\n\nWould recommend.\n\nHenn na Hotel Asakusa Tawaramachi which is just down the street from there is also nice if you want low budget, but clean and comfortable hotel room with no frills. Very small rooms though (I had a room for 2 people with 2 separate beds). \n\n----\n\nActually, I wonder, do people generally consider Asakusa a good place to stay? I know lot of people stay in Shibuya/Shinjuku, but those are more nightlife oriented I think? I wonder what other district might be as calm and safe as Asakusa. I also stayed around Asakusabashi station and that felt somewhat less safe at night.",

It doesn't come with the crowds like Shinjuku/Shibuya and its convenient to a lot of stuff, and a direct ride on the Ginza line will get you to the other side of the city easily and lots of things in between so transfers are minimal. The only downside is worrying about last trains if youre out for the night in Shinjuku/Shibuya. Looking back on it I should've just stayed out and cab rided back home or snagged a capsule to sleep until the trains started up again.",

For me, I was interested in Ikebukuro, Shibuya, Meiji Jingu/Harajuku so everything I wanted to do for a couple days was within a few train stops.  And I stayed in some other small rooms, so the room size didn't strike me as particularly tiny.\n\nOne comment I had read before traveling there was that Shinjuku might not be the best place for getting a night's rest, but like most of the hotels I stayed in there the soundproofing was pretty amazing.  I heard very little street noise and in my room, the shade did a decent job of cutting out video screen lights.\n\nOne other thing I should share - some commenters didn't like having to deal with the \"touts\" in Kabukicho.  I was a single male walking around and a few did come up to me.  But my demeanor was generally very dismissive like \"I notice you but I'm not interested\" and would just wave them away.  It wasn't an issue.  I find the idea odd in general to have men approach presumably heterosexual men and say things like \"are you interested in a massage or sex?\"  I kind of wanted to say \"not from you!\"  If they're looking to entice people who might not otherwise be interested, it seems like having women ask might be the better approach.",

We walked from there to Tokyo Station with our luggage to get the shinkansen and it was actually easier than trying to drag everything onto the Metro.\n\nNo problems heading back there on my own in the evening and there were some nice izakayas around that felt very 'local'.",

            "comment": "Stayed at the **Nohga Hotel Tokyo Akihabara** in late Nov 2022. It was a really nice, clean hotel in the heart of Akihabara, pretty much next door to Gamers Akihabara and across the main road from Don Quijote and Animate. \n\nRoom was clean and well kept, as you'd expect from a hotel that's less than 5 years old. It was a bit cramped for two people but still a bit roomier than the average APA or Super Hotel. The decor had a cool retro vibe and each room comes with a audiophile quality Bluetooth speaker which was definitely a nice feature. \n\nLocation wise, the hotel was perfect as an otaku but definitely still worth considering even if you're not. Akihabara and Suehirocho station were both about 5-10 mins away and made it easy to get around town. Plenty of restaurants in the area although you if you are looking for something more premium than run of the mill ramen, conveyor sushi or curry shops, you may have to look elsewhere. \n\nOne other thing to note is that the area is full of maid cafes and at night time, you can't go anywhere without bumping into a girl trying to hand you a maid cafe coupon or ad, so if you find that kind of stuff off putting, then better to go elsewhere. \n\nNo breakfast is included but the downstairs restaurant is still worth visiting. Great pizza and service, albeit a bit pricey. It's apparently quite a trendy place to eat as we saw a lot of well-dressed young professionals eating there in groups, which is a bit unexpected for Akihabara.\n\nPrice wise I managed to get a really good deal as the foreign tourism hadn't yet picked up. Paid $105 CAD per room per night (needed 2 rooms for my travelling party) whereas now it looks it will cost you at least $160 CAD or so.",

The staff are great and will meet you at the NEX and take your bags to the NEX so if you have a lot of bags you are set.  The breakfast at the Atrium is amazing and the setting is beautiful.  It's definitely expensive and is a luxury property.\n\nI like the location for the Royal Park Iconic.  I've gotten some good deals on rooms there and the beds are comfy.  I don't like then breakfast though.\n\nI like the Mitsui Garden Otemachi and Mitsui Garden Hotel Nihonbashi Premier.  The Otemachi Mitsui is cheaper and has smaller rooms, the Premier feels very luxe.  I've not gotten breakfast at either.\n\nI prefer staying near Tokyo Station and Shimbashi.  It has great connections to many places and plenty of shops and restaurants.",

I got a particularly good deal on both Mitsuis because I booked before they had officially opened.\n\nThere were amenities?  I don't really remember them, so it couldn't have been anything super fabulous, but it also wasn't completely lacking or I would remember it.  I've also stayed at another Mitsui in Sendai.",

            "comment": "One of my favorite hotel as a family (3-4+ people) was at Mimaru Hotel chains (Nihonbashi branch to be exact). It's on the pricey end of things, but still felt like good value for that many people. You get spacious living space, full on couches, mini kitchen like an AirBnB, but still maintain the Hotel quality and service.  This area in particular was in quiet backstreets, but still 1-2 ride away from most major attractions in Tokyo. Being next to TCAT is a perk for direct bus rides as well to airport.   \n\n\nTravelling alone I'm less fussy about the room quality. My recent trip included The Tourist Hotel &amp; Cafe Akihabara. I personally think the size for most business hotel are quite similar in size and service. It's nice when the hotel is newer (this opened 2020 mid-Covid, and I travelled Dec 2022), and you can tell it's been designed to be more aesthetically pleasing compared to your traditional business hotels.   \n\n\nPersonally think the key thing to have is a convenience store within a block of you. The ability to hop across the street for an easy breakfast or late night snack is amazing.   \n\n\nHotels I'd like to try would include Dormy Inn, hearing great things before and in this post.",

I ended up staying in [Asakusa Ryokan Toukaisou](https://toukaisou.com/en/) which I highly recommend for budget travelers who aren't as concerned with starting and ending their day with some transit (it's about 5 minutes from the Ginza line, which will take you straight to Shibuya in 30 minutes). It was inexpensive compared to similar options especially considering private bathrooms. Note there are no western beds, only tatami mats with futons. For me this was a plus but I know for some people it's a dealbreaker.",

Just a few minutes walk to Akihabara, and to Tokyo Station. Lots of places to eat, several coffee/breakfast places nearby (including a Starbucks), and 3 different c-store chains within a block. Yet quiet and off the main streets. The rooms were small but nice, and came with a cute basket of amenities and the bathroom was fully stocked. Oh, and it had a washer dryer available. Really inexpensive, but perfectly fine to come back to and hang for a bit; we had two rooms on one floor and splurged for a larger \u201cexecutive\u201d room that had space for a love seat/bench and table because the rates were so reasonable.",

    "postText": "Hi! My husband and I are planning a 25 day trip to Japan for this summer, from mid July to mid August. We are both huge fans of art, culture, nature and food. So far we had a very relaxed itinerary, with longer stays per city, as I was supposed to be 5 months pregnant. Sadly, as of this week, I am not anymore. I've already added more activities, walks and museumtrips to our itinerary during our stay in Tokyo, but it still needs a lot of work for the rest of it. As you can see, there are still days unplanned or need to be changed.\n\nQuestions I have:\n\n* This is a 25 day trip, with days unplanned. Any recommendations as to where we should go or visit?\n* The number of days for Osaka may be too much now. I myself have been to Japan twice before, visiting Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. I actually really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and shopping in Osaka! However, it is my husband's first time. Perhaps it would be nice to discover other (new) places together. I am therefore willing to shorten our stay in Osaka to 4 days, but where should we go during the rest of it?\n* If there's any advice or recommendations you have on this itinerary, I'm all ears. With everything going on, it sometimes feels a bit overwhelming. So any help is very much appreciated.\n\nOur current itinerary:\n\n* Day 0: Flight to HND Tokyo\n\n# Part 1 - Tokyo (7 days)\n\n* Day 1: Tokyo\n   * Morning: check-in at the hotel, have brunch\n   * Evening: discover Ginza.\n* Day 2: Tokyo\n   * Morning: visit Sensoji-temple, Asakusa and head to the National museum.\n   * Evening: t.b.d.\n* Day 3: Tokyo\n   * Morning: explore Akihabara en Ikebukuro\n   * Evening: t.b.d.\n* Day 4: Tokyo\n   * Morning: Tsukiji market, Hama-rikya gardens and maybe a Kabuki show.\n   * Evening: explore Chuo Dori or Nihonbashi district.\n* Day 5: Tokyo\n   * Morning: culture walk through Jimbocho, Imperial Gardens and Kagurazawa.\n   * Evening: t.b.d.\n* Day 6: Tokyo\n   * Morning: Meji-shrine and Yoyogi Park\n   * Evening: explore Shinjuku\n* Day 7: Tokyo\n   * Morning: Ghibli museum, explore Kichijoji and maybe Inokashira Park or Nakano Broadway.\n   * Evening: Shinjuku for Oimoide Yokocho and Kabukicho\n\n# Part 2 - Kansai (12 days?)\n\n* Day 8: Osaka\n   * Morning: Shinkansen to Osaka, check-in at hotel\n   * Evening: t.b.d.\n* Day 9: Osaka\n   * Morning: visit Osaka Castle\n   * Evening: shopping and have food at Dotonbori\n* Day 10: Osaka\n   * Visit Nara\n* Day 11: Osaka\n   * Morning: shopping\n   * Evening: Dotonbori or explore some bars\n* Day 12: Osaka\n   * Visit Kobe\n* Day 13: Osaka?\n* Day 14: Osaka?\n* Day 15: Osaka?\n* Day 16: Kyoto\n   * Morning: travel from Osaka to Kyoto, check-in at hotel\n   * Evening: explore Gion\n* Day 17: Kyoto\n   * Morning: Philosophers path and cycle around.\n   * Evening: t.b.d.\n* Day 18: Kyoto\n   * Morning: Kinkaku-ji park and Insho domoto museum.\n   * Evening: t.b.d.\n* Day 19: Kyoto\n   * Free day/my husband has a list of things he wants to do.\n\n# Part 3 - Unplanned (3 days)\n\n* Day 20: ?\n* Day 21: ?\n* Day 22: ?\n\n# Part 4 - Tokyo (3 days)\n\n* Day 23: Tokyo\n   * Maybe explore Yokohama.\n* Day 24: Tokyo\n   * Open to explore any place we might have missed.\n* Day 25: Tokyo\n   * Open to explore any place we might have missed.\n* Day 26: Tokyo\n   * All day: flight back home.",

            "comment": "Ghibli Museum is hard to get into. You have to book tickets wayyyyy in advance. \n\nShinjuku is amazing at night. Just be careful of people harrashing you to go to a bar/hostess club's. They seem friendly. However, they will get you drunk/drug you, charge you for expensive drinks and won't let you leave until you pay. Have heard it has gotten worst since covid. Kabuchio is the only place I experienced that behaviour. Also if you're down that way Golden Gai is a beautiful part of Shinjuku to visit (and oldest part of Tokyo), I would go in the daytime though. \n\nMy favourite part of Osaka is Shinsekai. It's definitely worth a visit! The Tsutenkaku tower is so cool! Great food in that area, too. There is an old arcade (pre covid 2019, not sure if it's there now) that was a lot of fun to visit! \n\nI suppose you could spend more days in Kyoto. Kyoto was my absolute favourite part of my trip. Love that city. Fushimi Inari and the bamboo Grove are must visit spots (touristy, but for a reason because they are beautiful).\nOtherwise, catch the skinkasen to Hiroshima? I recommend spending a couple of day there and seeing the bomb dome, Peace Park, museum and catching the ferry to Miyajima Island (could stay there one or two nights, there's a lot to see and do there!)\nI spent one day in Hiroshima and Miyajima, I regret not staying longer. Beautiful part of Japan \n\nAlso if you wanted to not stay in Tokyo as long you could go out to Hakone, see Lake Ashi and see the Owakudani volcano. They have awesome boat rides on Lake Ashi and you can view the volcano craters on a ropeway. Hakone has some beautiful places to stay, the place I stayed at had a private onsen.\n\nAlso, I totally recommend booking a tea ceremony or some kind of art/craft/knife sharpening class. Great way to get souvenirs and really make the trip memorable \u263a\ufe0f\n\nAnyway, these are things I'm thinking of from the top of my head. You can message me if you like and I can help you  (I'm a travel consultant, new to the industry but I have travelled to Japan!) \ud83d\ude0a",

You can access them from Okayama and Takamatsu by ferry. \n\nAlso just a side note of caution, July and August are VERY hot in Japan. You\u2019re itinerary is relaxed, which is good, but please be careful of heat stroke on your trip! I\u2019m from Florida and even I struggle every summer in Japan. Most vending machines sell electrolytes drinks called Pocari and Aquarius. They\u2019re lifesavers! Buy a parasol, handheld fan, or anything else that will help keep you guys cool as you walk around and sightsee. Convenience stores also sell cooling body wipes which are great to refresh with.",

The three days marked as 'Osaka?' could definitely be a trip to a totally new location! Hiroshima is a great option, a couple of days in the city (which has excellent shopping and the very moving peace park and museum) and a day visiting Miyajima island which is wonderful.\n\nOr if you fancy a change of pace, you could visit an onsen town for some R&amp;R! I haven't been there myself, but Kinosaki Onsen in Toyooka region looks beautiful. It was axed from our itinerary in favour of Kurokawa Onsen (which was _fabulous_, but it's in the heart of Kyushu and meant hiring a car, so perhaps not an option for you). But Kinosaki would be first on my list next time. Lovely traditional town, lots of great food, onsen and close to a beach for a paddle. https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3525.html\n\nHakone (as already mentioned) is a great shout for your unplanned zone before the return to Tokyo. We spent two nights there and really enjoyed the relaxed mountain vibes! The Open Air Art Museum was one of our trip highlights. It's well suited to a three day trip as you can purchase a three day travel pass that covers your trains and buses in the area, including a lovely loop up the cable car and over the lake. We basically stole the whole itinerary from this site - https://thebambootraveler.com/hakone-itinerary/ \nI'd recommend Gora as your base there, there are lovely Ryoken inns to stay in, and we had a great meal at the Gora Bar &amp; Grill.\n\nAll the best for a great trip!",

Dormy Inns have a public onsen and nice freebies like drinks in the afternoon, ramen in the evening, and ice lollies after your hot bath! \ud83d\ude04 We stayed in one in Nagasaki and it was very nice.

Sakate port is on the east of the island, so is near the soy sauce museum/factory area as well as Eigamura (Movie Village), and I stayed at Sen Guesthouse in the same area which is a little tricky to get to but the owners are lovely and will give you a lift back to the Sakate area in the morning if you ask. Also, if you take the ferry on return Shodoshima -&gt; Kobe, I recommend booking a premium seat because the free seats on the Aoi are... not great (the Ritsurin ones are fine Kobe -&gt; Shodoshima).\n\nI personally spent a weekend there and unfortunately it heavily rained on Sunday which limited what I could do. It's a little tricky to travel around because the buses aren't always particularly regular so in my two night stay I don't feel like I saw enough, but also I spent the Saturday doing a day hike up to Kankakei Gorge. I think you could do two nights comfortably if you took the cable car up Kankakei, and then had a full afternoon to see the west of the island such as the olive park.\n\nIf I really had all the time to relax and explore, I think my ideal Setouchi loop would be Kobe -&gt; Shodoshima (three nights) -&gt; Takamatsu (two nights) -&gt; Naoshima (day trip and straight onto...) -&gt; Tamano/Uno port (one night, I stayed at a guesthouse called Toranjyo Lit that I recommend) -&gt; Okayama (one night) -&gt; Kurashiki (day trip before leaving the area). I haven't seen Teshima yet but I think it's a good partner island to Naoshima.",

You need an international driver licence for renting a car.\n\nJust got back from 3 nights in Shodoshima, it's an island best travelled by car and worth 3 full days, I really enjoyed myself.\n\nTo save money on travelling,  sometimes taking a bus means 1 hour of travel time extra but 50 euros less on the costs.\n\nThe 7 waterfalls on Izu Peninsula are great too, you can even swim near the first 1 in different pools / hot springs for a small fee, this is on my bucket list :-)\n\nOr travel to Hokkaido too, for beer festival and lavender fields.",

    "postText": "Hello! First, thanks to anyone who offers help and information, it is much appreciated!\n\nMyself, one other adult, and two kiddos, aged 19 and 11, are traveling to Japan at the end of this summer. The trip will be first for all of us and the primary purpose of the trip is a belated High School graduation gift for my oldest Son. Below is my itinerary. My primary questions/concerns are:\n\nDoes each day seem plausible?\n\nIn terms of transportation, would a JR Rail Pass be a good idea? I have used the JR Rail Pass Calculator, but what is unknown for me is how much of the local travel we'll do would be applicable to the JR Rail Pass. \n\nCan anyone help me understand using the Suica card? I understand it can be added to an AppleWallet, but what about for my 11 year old? She's the only one of us without her own AppleWallet.\n\nI am still confused about admission to the Studio Ghibli Museum. I have read several things which contradict each other. So far it seems like US citizens CAN purchase tickets, and that can be done on the 10th of the month before. Is that correct?\n\nBackground info:\n\nWe're coming from Seattle, to LAX and then to Narita in Tokyo.\n\nWe are staying at an AirBNB in Minato City in Tokyo. It appears the closest transit are:\r  \nAkabanebashi Station\r  \n\rAzabu-Juban Station\r  \nKamiyach\u014d Station\n\nWe are planning to travel from Tokyo to Osaka via the Shinkansen, but are open to other suggestions. Our flight home departs from Tokyo as well, so well will take the same transit back to Tokyo on our departure day.\n\nWe are staying at the Liber Hotel in Osaka, which seems like it will be close enough to walk to USJ.\r\n\nItinerary:\n\n**Thursday 8/24**\r\n\nSeattle (SEA) to Los Angeles (LAX) via Delta\r  \n\r\rLos Angeles (LAX) to Tokyo (NRT) via Singapore Air\r  \n\r\r  \n**Friday 8/25**\n\nArrive at 5:50pm\r  \nAirport to AirBNB via Skyliner\r  \n  \n**Saturday 8/26**\r  \nGundam Base Tokyo;  Akabanebashi Station to Daiba Station (40-60 minutes)\r  \n\tGundam Statue\r  \n\tGundam Caf\u00e9 (take-away only)\r  \n\tGundam Base Store\r  \n\r  \n**Sunday 8/27**\r  \nPokemon Center Tokyo; Akabanebashi Station to Oshiage (Skytree) Station (30-50 minutes)\r  \n\tPokemon Caf\u00e9 (RESERVATIONS CAN BE MADE @ 1800 31 DAYS PRIOR)\r  \n\tPokemon Center\r  \n\r  \nTakeshita Street; Azabu-Juban Station to Harajuku Station (30-40 minutes)\r  \n\tCandy A-Go-Go\r  \n\tTotti Candy Factory\r  \n\tMarion Crepes\r  \n\tIyoshi Cola\r  \nJingumae Food Hall\r  \n\r  \n**Monday 8/28**\r  \nAkihabara; Kamiyacho Station  to Akihabara Station (30-40 minutes)\r  \n\tBandai Namco Gashapon Store\r  \n\tAnime Shops\r  \n\tMaid Caf\u00e9?\r  \n\tKanda Myojin Shrine?\r  \n\tSuper Potato\r  \n\tOwl Caf\u00e9?

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nYour 11 year old daughter will need her own IC.  She can get a physical one, she does not need one in an Apple Wallet.  It will just mean you need to use cash to add more onto the card.  You can get her either a Welcome Suica or Child's Suica because she is 1/2 price.  They will want to check her passport to make sure she is 12 or under.  And her name will be put on the card, my daughter has one.\n\nSince you're from Seattle, please be aware Summers in Japan are super humid.  I know Seattle can be hot in the Summer, but it tends to be a dry heat vs. Tokyo is more like any large city on the East Coast in August.\n\nAnyone can buy tickets to the Ghibli Museum (in Tokyo)) and Ghibli Park (in Nagoya) now.  They sell out fast for the museum. If you get desperate Willer has a more expensive package that includes tickets, but they sell out too.  The Park restricts what area foreigners can buy tickets for, but you can buy tickets.  They go fast.\n\nI think the 26th is really light.  I can't imagine spending a day on just those activities.\n\nThe Pokemon Cafe is not located in Skytree.  You can certainly go to the Pokemon Center in Skytree.  But the Cafe is located in the Takashimaya in Nihombashi.  Make sure you know where you are going and give yourself time to get between the two.  The Kirby Cafe is located in Skytree.\n\nyou will be spending much longer than an hour on Takeshita dori because on a Sunday during the Japanese school break you are going to have a 20+ minute line for each food place you want to visit.\n\nMost stores in Akihabara are not going to open until between 10 and noon.  You might want to have something to do before 11 that is somewhere else.  Owl Cafes are cruel, but if you are OK with that, it's on you.\n\nGive yourself more time when Going to Tokyo Disney because you still need to get from Maihama to either park.  For land, you can walk it in round 15 minutes, but Sea you really need to catch the monorail or take some sort of bus.  I think we did a monorail last time.\n\nMake sure you install and set up the Tokyo Disney App ahead of time.  It works on Android phones, I assume it works on Apple.\n\nWhy are you going back to Skytree and Harajuku on your second week end?\n\nPokemon Sweets doesn't take reservations and is located in Ikebukuro not Shibuya.\n\nI could have sworn shinkansen tickets can only be bought 30 days in advance\n\nIt's 6 of one half dozen of the other whether a 1 week pass is worth it for your trip to Osaka.  It's definitely not worth it to get a JR Pass while you are in Tokyo unless you are planning things not in your itinerary.  A lot of your travel is going to be a mix of local trains and subways.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I am in Japan rn and don\u2019t have too much to offer on your itinerary (as I didn\u2019t do the theme parks or go to most of these places) except for the fact that I found Harajuku extremely underwhelming and very tourist-trappy, so unless you have loads of things to tick off there I wouldn\u2019t suggest going on 2 separate days. \n\nI didn\u2019t get Ghibli tickets as they sold out within hours for me (I am from the UK so stayed up until 2am UK time to buy, but the website crashed for me as soon as tickets went live and when I got back on an hour later I was 11,000th in the queue), but yes it is open to foreigners now and they do go live the month before on the 10th at 10am JST, so good luck as they will sell out quickly. One suggestion to consider adding to the plan would be TeamLab which I imagine would be a good exhibit with the kids (not sure if Borderless will re-open by then, but I think Planets is open until the end of the year).\n\nI would just reserve Shinkansen tickets once in Japan as (similar to what the other commenter has said) your Tokyo itinerary is mostly subway journeys, and the few local JR trains you will get can just be done with Suica cards - saves you having to bring the physical exchange orders and queue up to exchange etc. It also means you can reserve seats on the faster Nozomi services which aren\u2019t included in the JR Pass, they only stop at the major stations between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka and I believe they are more frequent than the Hikari and Kodama services (which are included in the JR Pass)\n\nThe self use ticket machines can all be switched to English, and (unless due to any summer holidays meaning the trains are packed) you should be fine reserving them a week in advance, we managed to reserve seats (only 2 of us with JR Passes but plenty of options even without Nozomi trains) easily on the Shinkansen just a couple of days in advance between Tokyo and Kyoto. \n\nGood luck with your trip!",

(I think it was slightly cheaper.)\n\nI am not affiliated with Willer and receive absolutely nothing from them.   I have personally not used the service, I last went to the Museum in 2018, and I got my hotel to get me tickets.\n\nHarajuku is super touristy and all the food stops are super touristy, and I get wanting to go because it's sort of like a theme park, but I can't imagine going 2x to the same shops in 1 2 week trip.  It's really not worth it.",

There was definitely more of a sameness to it, when I went in December (when it was unpleasantly packed.  It's like I think the Dotombori area of Osaka use to have some more unique shops, but now it's just very crowded and not someplace I want to spend time.\n\nI am going to Harajuku to go to the Disney Movie Box Cafe, and I might go back another day around noon to look at some shops, but I want to go back early enough that the shops are just opening and it is a work/school day. lol\n\nIf it makes you feel better, while I enjoyed my first time in the Ghibli Museum, my second trip was incredibly disappointing.  It was packed with people and the sounds reverberate inside which my old person ears just can't take.  I also didn't like our limited film and the dinning options are excessively limited and again just packed with people\n\nI'd also like to go to the Park when more is open, especially since the Warehouse Exhibit is the same exhibit we saw at the museum lol\n\nDid you try Shirohige's for the cream puffs?  It's not the same thing, but is still awful cute.  I admit, I liked the cookies more than the cream puffs.",

The park does sound great though even if it is out of the way, that would definitely be one of the priorities for us on the second trip.",

We have a 5:30 pm reservation for the limited time Pikachu themed tea, which I am hoping has better food but still scratches the Pokemon itch.\n\nWe have dietary restrictions, and while the new Park has options for people with restrictions, the museum really does not.  And with its no re-entry policy, you either need to carry around food with you or leave eventually to eat.  There is just one small Cafe and one window selling ice cream (and I think a few more snacky things) so lines can build up very quickly.  My first visit to the museum, I think they had more restricted numbers of visitors, and the film we had was a delightful one about kitten buses and was a pleasure to watch.  I like some of the permanent exhibits, but they're small and once you've seen them, they're the same?  And fighting people to get close to see examine them is less than fun.\n\nAnd yes there is a Shirohige's near Daita.  That one has an actual cafe attached to it, so you can eat there.  It's a very cute area.\n\nDotombori is better than Harajuku, but I still don't get how people can spend more than a 2-3 hours there.  I see it on so many itineraries as a must do and I am like... OK.\n\nI travel with my tween now, so I am always balancing things for me with things for her and things for us.  (It's also why I know where the Pokemon Cafe is and Pokemon Sweets lol)  It's why I get wanting to go to Harajuku, the OP is traveling with a 19 year old and an 11 year old.  But I honestly would never want to go on a week end and I really can't imagine wanting to go two days both on week ends and both to the same shops.  I am hoping it was a copy and paste error.  There are just so many other places to consider.\n\nUsually, it feels like people are putting too many places in 2 weeks, but this itinerary just feels quite empty.",

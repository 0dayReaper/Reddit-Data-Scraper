    "postText": "Hello all. I\u2019m leaving for Japan on the 30th of this month. I just got Yen from my local bank here in Toronto, Canada.  I received a number of \u00a5 2,000 notes. I read online that outside of Okinawa they are quite rare and many vending machines and shops don\u2019t accept them. \n\nI was wondering how true this is. I will be going to Tokyo, Kyoto &amp; Osaka. \n\nCan I exchange the notes at the airport bank? I\u2019ll be landing at Haneda airport.\n\nThanks in advance",

You can\u2019t use them in vending ~~or ticket machines~~ (they do work in JR ticket machines per comment below) but you can pay with them at any register.  Don\u2019t be surprised if the cashier does a double take though or has to ask a manager.  If they are young or a new cashier they may have not seen a 2,000 yen bill yet.  You might even hear a few \u201cSugoi!\u201d (Cool/interesting)",

It's a passive way to track how international tourist money is injected into Japan, though I'm not sure if that's the intention.\n\nIf you exchange your money in Japan, then you're unlikely to see them.",

It's too expensive to adapt all of the vending machines etc. to accept them so not many machines do. \n\nThe picture on the back is from Okinawa, so the \u00a52000 bills were all dumped in Okinawa or sent overseas.  It's like when the Susan B Anthony dollar coin came out in the states. Very unpopular so they were all sent out to American military bases around the world or just left in bank vaults",

It's not a matter of the military knowing how much money is withdrawn in yen, but to show the citizens that complain about the military how much they actually contribute to the economy given how many of the bills ended up being in circulation. Especially with the media hate for the military bases there saying they were all a net negative to Japan.\n\nPutting out a quarterly report on ATM use doesn't quite have the same effect. The military did this in the US at times as well, back before direct deposit, paying soldiers in $2 bills after communities complained about the bases, to show the community how much they would lose if bases were shut down, private companies also did this in communities they caught grief in.",

There's a lot of tourism there, but with IC and credit cards, I doubt currency flows quite the same way between Okinawa and Tokyo the same way it does within Okinawa. The military does a huge amount for the economy, hires a very large number of citizens to work on base, and leases out land to farmers. Not to mention tens of thousands of soldiers who go off base to eat, drink, live, etc. Also I doubt the ATMs get as much use these days as they did when I was there 20 years ago and credit cards, if you were lucky enough to get one, still used impression slips.",

I tried to use a 2000 yen bill at one of my local supermarkets and the cashier was hesitant to take it because she hadn't seen it before. Another store's automatic machine wouldn't accept it. However, I live in a town that rarely sees foreign tourists. Even here, though, the vast majority of stores took them without a problem  (even though some staff were curious about them haha).",

I bring about $200 US in case of emergency but I rely on ATMs to get cash whenever I need it. Some local banks won\u2019t take foreign ATM cards but 7-Eleven and Family Mart ATMs have never failed me, even in the smallest town. I got a free checking account with Charles Schwab as they rebate all ATM fees worldwide.\n\nAlthough I have no fear of being mugged, I hate to carry large amounts of cash, maybe being a New Yorker causes me to be nervous. My first trip to Japan was in 1994 (I\u2019m old) and it was my far more cash-based then and really hard to find an ATM that took foreign cards. These days, I\u2019m using my Suica card, Apple Pay and foreign-transaction-fee-free Visa almost exclusively.",

Anyway, they kept us waiting for nearly an hour. Out of patience, I demanded to know what was taking so long. Apparently, someone at the bank had made a clerical error on the last payment we made and this was causing problems. As it turned out it was much easier/faster to pull the cash out, which we did (put it into my backpack). The remodel guy was laughing when we told him to come over and pick it up.",

The 2000yen note was created in the year 2000, and is for an amount that is extremely relevant for modern purchases, and Japanese people 23 years later are still bewildered by it.",

She stood there with opened wide eyes, after a while she touched it to feel the texture. After that she kept repeating the word \"Gifto\", my friend didn't understand at first and asked his guide what that meant. She said that 2000 bills are very rare and some japanese people never saw them in all their life. \n\nShe basically told my friend to keep it cause it's rare. That was his first day in Japan and it had me laughing hard when i heard the story :P",

            "comment": "In my opinion that is a lot of time in Kinosaki. For me 1 night is enough in a ryokan with 2 meals, 2 is limit, 3 really too much. If you keep this plan, day 9 leave early and stop by Himeji castle, here is a direct train from Kinosaki, I just do not know the time, then continue to Hiroshima. There is not that much to see in Kinosaki, by the end of day 7, you will have walked from one side of the town to the other 10 times already. Also if you do ryokan with meal, you usually have to check in before 5 or 6 pm, so that does not leave a full day for Kyoto on day 7, that already have a lot (also maybe skip Toji temple).",

I doubt they would have late check in as late as 12 even if you do not get meals.\n\nYou have a lot on that day, for sure do Toji if you have time, but again, check in time at ryokan.",

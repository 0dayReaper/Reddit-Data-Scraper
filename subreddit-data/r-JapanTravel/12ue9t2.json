    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm visiting Japan for the first time this Fall with my former college roommate. I haven't figured the exact day to day flows but I do have my landmarks, attractions and top food spots collected. Recently, some friends visited Japan and relayed their experience so hopefully I'm not missing out much. I am a big foodie/ramen head and I typically hit up 4x-6x food spots per day on vacation (food vacuum). I have been warned that this will likely be impossible. As a result, I have pulled back to going for 1 food spot per day either lining up or reservation and going for 1 major tourist attraction. The rest of the day will be free flowing. \n\nDAY 1 - Arriving Saturday in Ginza\n\n* Arrive ~4pm at NRT and Ginza, Tokyo ~5-6pm and check in. \n\n* Random dinner or maybe we'll do a sandwich comparison between 7/11, Fami and Lawson. \n\nDAY 2 / 3 - not quite sure on the order \n\n* Landmarks: Tsukiji Fish Market, Imperial Palace\n\n* Food: Ginza Hachigou (will line up in the morning), Manten Sushi at Tokyo Station (reservation for value omakase)\n\n* I was thinking of lining up Ginza Hachigou in the morning and then doing Imperial Palace + Edo for the afternoon. The other day would be Tsukiji Outer Market in the morning and free flowing after that. Manten Sushi can happen on any of these days. \n\nDAY 4: 1 Nighter in Hakone\n\n* Forward Luggage to Kyoto hotel. \n\n* I'm just going to follow one of these itineraries: [TokyoCheapo](https://tokyocheapo.com/travel/holidays/hakone-day-trip-guide/) or a combo of the [HakoneNavi](https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/course/244) and [HakoneNavi2](https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/course/1237)\n\n* Still hotel searching but Hotel Green Plaza might fit the bill. I am looking for a Fuji view and Onsen if you have any recommendations. \n\nDAY 5 - Depart for Kyoto\n\n* Any remaining Hakone things but likely we will just depart for Kyoto asap via Shinkasen. \n\n* I'm activating my 7 day J Rail pass.\n\nDAY 6 / Day 7 - Kyoto Landmarks\n\n* Landmarks: Fushimi Inari Morning Hike + Kiyomizu-dera/Sanneizaka Afternoon, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove + Togetsukyo Bridge (I can maybe do this on Day 5 if we get to Kyoto early enough).\n\n* Food: Yamamoto Menzou, Ginjo Ramen Kubota\n\n* I welcome any food recommendations for Kyoto. I operate on an open mind, open stomach principle. \n\nDay 8 - Himeji Day Trip\n\n* Tour the castle and come back to Kyoto basically\n\n* Is it possible to do the castle in the morning and then Nara Park (and close landmarks) in the afternoon?\n\nDay 9 / 10 - Osaka Day Trips\n\n* Landmarks: Super Nintendo World + Universal Studio, Osaka Castle + Dotonbori + Kuromon Market. \n\n* Is there any time for Umeda Sky Building/Observatory? What about Abeno Harukas?\n\n* I did want to go bargain hunting at a Tamade supermarket. \n\n* Food: Gyukatsu Motomura, lots of Dotonbori spots so far\n\nDAY 11 - Return to Tokyo (Shibuya)\n\n* Forward our luggage to Shibuya hotel. Last day of 7 Day Rail Pass. \n\n* I was originally considering a day trip to Nara and then returning to Tokyo.\n\nDAY 12 / 13 / 14 - Shibuya \n\n* Landmarks: Harajuku, Shibuya sky,  Nonbei Yokocho, mostly shopping \n\n* Food: Random assortment of stuff, Higuma Doughnuts\n\n*  Shinjuka, Ueno/Akihabara at some point and a bunch of souvenir shopping\n\n\nMy key questions: \n\n* Is Himeji + Nara doable or should I just do Nara park? This could mean returning to Tokyo on my second Osaka night. \n\n* The last 5 days are still TBD. I would like to see the Shinjuku National Gardens, Ueno/Akihabara also the Ghibli museum.\n\n* Sosakumenkobo NAKIRYU and Soba House Konjiki-Hototogisu are the other 2 ramen spots on the top of the list. Can I somehow fit these in? I have gathered a decent list of ramen spots from Tabelog, Youtube and IG Ramen reviews but please feel free to recommend any other specific cuisine/restaurants.",

If it\u2019s not a very clear day, you might not get to see it at all. So be sure to manage your expectations. In the past couple of weeks for example it\u2019s been so foggy / cloudy / sandy that you could barely ever see it from Hakone or Kanagawa area at least.",

At the same time, Himeji with just the castle is a half day trip, so you can put Arashiyama in the afternoon, and go straight from Kyoto station (via Sagano line at no. 33 platform) to Saga-Arashiyama Station.",

    "postText": "I'm going to Japan in about two weeks . I already went in 2019 and already did the main touristy routes. (Kiyomizudera and neighbourhood, Gion, Fushimi Inari Taisha, Ginkakuji, Kinkakuji, Arashiyama)\n\nWe have 9 days in Kyoto, but I felt this one was getting too boring, so in a bout of crazyness I just scraped most of my Kyoto Itinerary.  The days in **bold** are the ones I didn't change. The thing is, my parents are coming with me and it's their first time, so would a \"Kyoto Highlight's\" Day would be enough for a taste of the old Kyoto?\n\nI'm looking for a mix of small towns, hiking, castles, temples and gardens. What do you think? I'm I missing somewhere amazing? We all love hiking, but my father has some mobility problems, so we can't go on hikes that are too hard or long.\n\nHere's my new itinerary:\n\n**Tuesday 9 - Fushimi (Half a day)**\n\nWednesday 10 - Hikone &amp; Omihachiman\n\nThursday 11 - Takao to Arashiyama Hike\n\nFriday\t12 - (Me) Kurama to Kibune &amp; Kyoto Teahouses / (Parents) Kyoto Highlight's\n\nSaturday 13 - Ohara\n\n**Sunday\t14 - Uji (Reservation at Nakamura Tokichi Honten)**\n\nMonday\t15 - Yamanobe-no-Michi\n\nTuesday\t16 - Himeji\n\n**Wednesday 17 - Guided Tour (Gardens of Kyoto)**\n\nI have a few questions as well:\n\n1. How hard is the hike from Takao to Otagi Nenbutsu-ji? Is there enough time hike it in the morning and visit a few Arashiyama Temples in the afternoon? I saw that the temples at Takao only opens at 9h so It would be a kind of a late start.\n2. Is it worth to take something off the list to visit Kayabuki no Sato or Mt. Hiei?\n3. Is it feasible to visit both Hikone and Omihachiman in the same day?\n4. I'm not sure if my father can walk the full Yamanobe-no-Michi. Are there bust stops along it?\n\nThe full trip in a nutshell is: \n\nArrive Tokyo &gt; 9 Days Kyoto as HQ &gt; 2 Days Wazuka/Parents in Osaka&gt; Nagoya &gt; Tokoname &gt; 4 days Tokyo &gt; Kamakura &gt; Enoshima &gt; Yokohama &gt; 2 Days Tokyo\n\nBut you can find it detailed here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iCIAQRH-fzjWC4tj6e\\_CErk\\_e8XYMrTm/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iCIAQRH-fzjWC4tj6e_CErk_e8XYMrTm/view?usp=sharing)",

            "comment": "One of Hikone or Himeji is enough and two get duplicative, especially if your parents have limited mobility for the insides of castles. The only exception is if they are super into the history of Japanese castles. If it were me I would do Omi-Hachiman one day and either Hikone or Himeji on the other day.\n\nKayabuki No Sato looks easier to abort/leave than Yamanobe No Michi which could be a consideration for your father?",

All itineraries I've seen make it as a half a day trip.  \n\nAccording to my parents what they like to see the most when travelling is Nature, so I think he would love to do a slow walk on the countryside... but Kayabuki No Sato may be a better idea. Thanks!",

The shopping experience there will be vastly more pleasant than in Kyoto/Osaka.",

I certainly underestimated the time it takes to travel between towns in a group of 3, but it worked out in the end. Next time I'll set a more leiseure pace when in a group context.\n\n- Omihachiman was pretty and the walking path on the top of the mountain was surreal in the light rain: they had turned on lanterns in part of the path.\n\n- Himeji Castle is 100% worth it, but Mt. Shosha felt eerie. There were absolutely no one in sight, except on the mochi shop.\n\n- Uji was one of the best days. The tea ceremony was fun, and the town is beautiful.\n\n- My parents ended up burned out of temples by the end, so we skipped most on Kamakura. Only visited Hasedera, and they loved it. Spent the rest of the day at Enoshima. Very nice place.\n\n- Yokohama was an unexpected hit. Spent the whole day, returned very late. The gardens were full of flowers and there was a parade in the Chinese district.\n\n- my parents loved Nikko, but hated Utsunomiya. I loved Wazuka.\n\n- Ohara is nice, but it's a bit of a temple overload\n\n- The hike from Takao to Arashiyama is gorgeous\n\nGood luck on your trip.",

            "comment": "TLDR: **You probably should skip Kyoto since your *workation* would interfere with any sane plans and you should focus on cities like Kobe or Osaka that somewhat support that kind of hours.**\n\nYour plan for Sunday, April 30th is silly - in general if you start teamLab in the morning (10am-ish) it is doable to hit all those place, but you probably be better off visiting Akihabara during the early afternoon, then hitting off Asakusa and ending at Skytree in the evening. Akihabara is pretty much dead (save some sex businesses at night) and once the shops close - there is absolutely nothing to do since dinner options vary between awful and mediocre\n\nMonday, May 1st: Harajuku should be hit as soon as possible - that will not save you much during Golden Week, but late morning is still less insanely crowded than afternoons.\n\nWednesday, May 3rd: I don't know what you are planning for the morning, but hitting Arashiyama that late afternoon would mean that you will be rushed and the area will be extremely crowded. Also, unless you have reservations already set - there is not much point to spending that much in Gion during evening (even if looking for vibe and lanterns - 2 hours would be enough).\n\nThursday, May 4th: You will not get through Nijo-jo and Imperial Palace in 2 hours. Kiyomizu-dera would be also packed in the late afternoon with lengthy queues and closes at 6pm, you also pass on seasonal Joju-in garden viewing times.\n\nFriday, May 5th: Both Kinkaku-ji and Fushimi Inari are likely to be extremely packed at those hours.",

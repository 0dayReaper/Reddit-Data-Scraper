    "postText": "Hi all, wondering if someone has tips for playing golf around Mount Fuji? Want to surprise my partner with a round of golf during our trip to Japan early October and I\u2019m slightly intimated by the Japanese websites of main golfcourses in the area. Curious to hear about recent experiences of others (tourists/foreigners) on playing golf in Japan and how feasible it is to book a greenfee. We are both experienced golfers and have played abroad before, but golfing Japan seems like a different ballgame (pun intended). We wouldn\u2019t bring our own gear so looking for a course with rental options. Also, is early October typically a good time of year to actually see Mount Fuji from a distance? As the view on Mount Fuji would also be a factor in choosing a golfcourse. \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!",

A real challenge if you don't have Japanese skills \n\nAdditionally you will need to pay extra if you are not a foursome.\n\nFinally expect to take all day with a break for lunch.\n\nJapan Guide have a very good golf article including link to Rakuten Gora which is a Japanese language site for booking rounds\n\nhttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2082.html#section_links\n\nIt's a great experience if you can find sonewhere to accommodate you",

You hit the nail on the head with the booking being a real challenge in Japanese \ud83d\ude05 Really hoping someone on this thread has recent experience booking as a tourist and can share how they went about it and where they ended up going. The Rakuten site is not that easy to navigate, even when translated.. \n\nRegarding lunch and potential extra charges for a twosome - noted, all good.",

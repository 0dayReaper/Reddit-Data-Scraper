Click your prefered language on the screen, navigate through the options to buy a suica card. Add funds to the card using cash. So visit an ATM first. It can be a bit tedious so I suggest going outside of peak hours or you'll create a queue behind you with people who'd rather be elsewhere.\n\n(JR pass is for long distance travel and you'd have no use for it staying only two days in tokyo)",

Obviously depends on the amount of trips you intend to take. There's also a 500Yen deposit required when getting your suica card issued.",

This pays for the round trip from Narita + gives you access to the metros. You purchase online and then redeem at the Skyliner ticket counter at Narita. Super easy!\n\n**Edit: missed the part where you have a hotel shuttle.  You can still buy the 48 or 72 hour metro ticket separately :)",

The metropass is unlimited trips for however many days you buy the pass for. Each trip is approx 200\u00a5 on average, so you can do the math to see if the metropass is worth it for you :)",

I've heard the locals don't really like the go cart thing so just keep that in mind. I did see them drive past and it looks kind of fun but maybe also kind of unsafe because you're on a road. \n\nThere's also the Nintendo store which is in Shibuya and there's also a Pok\u00e9mon store and a few other anime type stores on the same level. I went to a few of the Pok\u00e9mon stores and they were all pretty similar. If you're going to Senso- ji, there's a street nearby called Kappabashi where you can buy Japanese Knives (and other kitchen stuff). I bought my knife from Tokuzo, would definitely recommend if you're looking for one. Also nearby is the Tokyo Skytree, which is one station east of Asakusa. \n\nThere's also 4-5 museums nearby in Ueno, which is just a couple of stations north of Akihabara.",

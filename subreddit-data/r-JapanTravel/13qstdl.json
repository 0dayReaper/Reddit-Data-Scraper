    "postText": "Hi guys! Going to Tokyo on July and wanted to check if my itinerary\u2019s too packed, needs diversity, or needs better routing.\n\n1- \n\nShinjuku - Kabukichon, Omoide Yokocho\n\n\n2- \n\nKamakura - Tsurugaoka Temple, Zenirai Temple, Komachi Dori, Hokokuji Bamboo Garden\n\nKamakurakokomae\n\nEnoshima*\n\nYokohama* - Red brick warehouse, ramen museum\n\n\n3- \n\nGhibli Museum*, Kichijoji*\n\nShibuya - Shibuya Crossing, Hachiko, Pokemon Center, Donki Shopping, Shibuya Sky, Nonbei Yokocho\n\n\n4- \n\nTokyo Disneyland\n\n\n5- \n\nWarner Bros Tokyo\n\nHarajuku - Takeshita St, Yoyogi Park, Meiji Shrine\n\n\n6- \n\nUeno - Ueno Park, Ameyokocho\n\n\n\nThose in asterisks are those that I\u2019m not sure of yet. \n\nNotes:\n- Placed Ueno Park as last so we\u2019re nearer the airport. My hotel\u2019s in Shinjuku. Is there enough to do in Ueno Park, and do you guys prefer Asakusa or I do both on last day?\n- Is Shibuya enough time if i go Ghibli Museum first? Is there time to slot in Tsukiji before Ghibli?\n- Not sure how to go about Kamakura. Do i slot in Enoshima or Yokohama after? I heard Enoshima closes early too\n- If I\u2019ve been to Shibuya on a prior day, is it still worth allotting a half day to Harajuku? Any reccs on better places to go full day after Warner Bros?\n\nThanks!",

I find it's always helpful to factor in some time to actually acclimate before you try to hit your entire list. That said, I would 1000% recommend taking the train down to Kamakura at least for the day. Great place, great sights there.",

Far too many \u201cTokyo Only\u201d tourists don\u2019t.\n\nWhen I went there I initially planned on dividing my time between Kamakura and Fujisawa and ended up spending the whole day in Kamakura instead. I recommend taking your time and savouring your stay in Kamakura since it will have a very different vibe to anything you\u2019d experience in either Tokyo or Yokohama.",

It's an Akihabara aimed for women (aka less hentai and more yaoi and family friend anime shops.)\n\nGinza is Ginza, it's luxe, but there are more affordable brands like Muji and Uniqlo.  I think of it as wide sidewalks and actually named streets and lots of department stores.\n\nI'm sure Kichijoji is expensive to LIVE in, but it's more cute stores and a big park.  It has a much lower skyline and more small shops.",

I tend to get my anime fix in at Ikebukuro.\n\nIf you want somewhere more traditional make a day trip to Kamakura.  It's around 1 hour south of Tokyo and costs only about 1200 yen each way to reach, so it won't break the bank.  But I like temples.",

You can't just show up to go. \n\nIf you are wanting to spend any time in Akihabara you will most likely need more than just a couple of hours. It's a big area and there is stuff on every floor of all the buildings.\n\nUeno park is also a big area. There are six museums and a zoo (one of my favorites). As well as two or three shrines. You could easily spend the entire day just in the park depending on what you want to do and see. Loved the natural history museum there. Hachico was stuffed after his death and is on display in the museum.\n\nKeep in mind that you are going to be there in the summer. It is extremely hot and humid. Drink lots of water.\n\nThere are two parks at Disney. Do Disney Sea during the day then after 6pm switch to Disneyland. They don't do park hopper tickets but they do discounted prices after 6pm. The reason for doing it this way is that Disney Sea is designed more for teens and adults and it gets super busy in the evening where the main park is really busy during the day and is not as busy in the evening.\n\nHave fun!",

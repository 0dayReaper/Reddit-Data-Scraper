A horrified watcher alerted the authorities and search team recovered a body and it is not determined if it was the live streamer.\n\nIt is implied he was ill prepared for hike, as he was complaining about his frozen fingers, reported to be wearing tennis shoes and was hiking alone.\n\nBecause of live streaming, it is also implied he went on a hike for social media status.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/10/30/national/body-livestream-fall-mount-fuji/\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/29/hiker-falls-off-mt-fuji-while-live-streaming-steps-from-summit-rescuers-yet-to-find-him%e3%80%90video%e3%80%91/\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/30/search-for-live-streamer-who-fell-from-mt-fuji-finds-badly-damaged-corpse-half-mile-below-peak/",

I know when I hiked it overnight, I went fairly well prepared (low temp, water/windproof gear) on a \"good weather day\" and it was still pretty miserable.  I talked with some people along the way who were just in basic athletic gear without any backpacks, just treating it like a day hike, and they were supremely miserable when I ran into them at the top. \n\n&gt; I'd imagine that Fuji in the winter is a good place to learn basic mountaineering,\n\nProbably true; plus it sounds like this guy got to the summit successfully.  Maybe he did have experience and just made a mistake?  Maybe hiking alone was hubris?",

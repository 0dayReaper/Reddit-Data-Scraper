    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI'm booking a last minute solo trip to Tokyo. The last time I was in Tokyo, I didn't get a chance to walk around the city.

So if you're going to Ueno park,  you're either going before rush hour (7am) or after rush hour (10am) and then walk around a bit for 2 hours and then jump on the train to get to Akihabara. You're going to spend at LEAST 2 hours there and that's going into animate and just walking up and down the main street and then junk street. Maybe get some food? This leaves you for what 2pm to then get to Ginza. \n\nGetting to Ginza from Akihabara is 20 minutes and then spend another 2-3 hours there. \n\nYou're at peak rush hour 4-5pm to go to Odaiba which is almost 45 minutes from Ginza Six. FYI there's a Hello Kitty Store in Ginza. \n\nOdaiba for 2-3 hours and you're at 8pm on the first day. If  you're coming from North America, you're going to be struggling to stay awake from the jet lag and your legs will have issues. \n\nYou can see how the first day is a little to chaotic and you might miss out on some things depending on timing and rushing to get from one place to another. \n\n&gt; Thursday 5/11:\n\n&gt; morning jog in Yoyogi Park\n\n&gt; Shibuya\n\n&gt; lunch at Tsuta\n\n&gt; Nintendo Store\n\n&gt; Tokyu Hands\n\n&gt; Harajuku\n\n&gt; Omotesando\n\nThursday is not so bad. Might want to rethink the morning Jog depending on how your legs/feet feel. \n\nThis feels like a lighter day so it should be okay.  \n\nFor Yokohama, you can visit the Gundam factory, Yokohama China town, the 2 malls are pretty nice at the cup noodle museum. \n\nWe skipped Hakone because we weren't looking to drop 700 bucks a night for 2 people. \n\nI would honestly put in some breaks. \n\nCheap food: \n\nBreakfast - Yayoi - Nakau \n\nLunch - Any Gyudon place (Sukiya &gt; Yoshinoya &gt; Matsuya)\n\nDinner - we slummed it a bit with a few Kura/Sushiro but we did eat some fancy meals \n\nMore Expensive Food: \n\nI recommend Tsukemen at this place Menya\n\nhttps://menya634.co.jp/storelist/akihabara/\n\nHope this helps.",

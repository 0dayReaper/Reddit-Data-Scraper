    "postText": "I leave for Japan very early tomorrow morning and I haven\u2019t yet received my Yunyu Kakunin-sho. I did apply for it recently because I was only able to receive some of the necessary documents. I will be in Japan for 2 months. Should I only take 1 months supply of my medication and have the rest shipped? Or would it be better to bring the full supply and see if the airport can hold it?",

Shipping might get flagged by customs, and if it is a controlled medicine, they might charge you with bringing drugs. It will all depend on the kind of medicine you need. Why don't you try using insurance and going to the doctor here? I believe it is your safest bet. There are English Speaking doctors in some hospitals. If you need I can look up one for you when you get here!",

Japan has an extremely hard stance on drugs of any kind.\n\nDefinitely follow up with the Japanese embassy and make sure you have all your paperwork in triplicate. Hard copies as well as digital.",

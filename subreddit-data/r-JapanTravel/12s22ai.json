    "postText": "Hi all, I know this is a common destination but I think I'm looking more for advice than for information. I'm going to be in Tokyo May 4th-8th and it was kind of a last-minute decision so I'm frantically trying to research and plan some stuff. I really want to do a day trip to Mount Fuji, specifically the Kawaguchi area. I figured I'd do a tour package to save myself the stress of figuring out transport and because I want to be as time-efficient as possible and fit a lot into one day. HOWEVER...because it's so close, and because it's golden week, the tours that look best to me are sold out. These are the things I really want to do:\n\n* Lake Kawaguchi (hopefully rent a bike and ride around a little bit)\n* Arakura Sengen Park + Arakura Fuji Sengen Shrine + Chureito Pagoda\n* Kachi Kachi/Mt Fuji Ropeway\n* 5th Station\n\nNone of the tours that are still available have the Ropeway, or if it does have the Ropeway it doesn't have the other things (and instead has things I don't want to waste limited time on). So, I guess my question is... is it worth it to attempt this all on my own just so I can do the Ropeway? I won't have a JR Pass since I'm only there 5 days, and I've never been to Japan before, but I've been reading about the Fuji Excursion Limited and have faith that I could figure all the trains out. However, I'm a little worried about the train selling out, plus figuring out travel between each spot, timing it all correctly, etc. If I messed up the timing I'd end up missing some of the spots anyway and would've been better off on a tour. Thanks in advance for any input...",

            "comment": "We were just there a couple of weeks ago. The excursion buses and trains were all sold out, and apparently had been for weeks. So we took the local trains the whole way there (for us from the Hilton Tokyo/Shinjuku Station, it was JR Chuo Line to Otsuki Station, where we hopped on Fujikyu Railway all the way to Kawaguchiko Station). The regular JR Passes don't cover this line anyway, unless you have the Tokyo-wide pass. I believe it was about $13 each way, and you can use your IC card. Took us about 2 hrs 45 min to get from Shinjuku to Mt. Fuji, so be sure to leave very early.\n\nThen have your IC card ready again for the sightseeing bus route, because the sights at Lake Kawaguchi are quite far from the train station. The sightseeing route goes right past the ropeway and will get you extremely close. The lines for the ropeway were INSANE when we passed by, literally down the hill and around the block, but it wasn't in our plan for the day anyway.\n\nChureito Pagoda is quite close to one of the stops along the Fujikyu Railway Line (Shimoyoshida Station). FYI when it's busy, there is a line to get up to the best photo spot where you can get Mt. Fuji and the pagoda together in one picture. Again, the line was massive and spiraled down the hill. It looked to be hours long, so we didn't bother. We got really nice pictures elsewhere anyway!",

Fuji is not a guarantee based on weather and whatnot) and there was a sign at the door saying it was full. The sign had the same instructions I outlined above. Presumably this is the best way since that's the route recommended by JR as the alternative. \n\n[This page](https://gowithguide.com/blog/how-to-book-fuji-excursion-4138) seems to have a detailed explanation of how it can be booked ahead. I can't speak from experience since we tried to book the day of and failed big time! There was no need to book anything the way we did it, so at least you know it's possible to get there even if the convenient fast options are all sold out.\n\nAs for the train system, Google maps works pretty well but we actually used the Japan Official Travel App. It was extra handy with our JR Pass, because it tells you which routes are covered by the pass. I can see it being very useful even without the pass though. The route planning worked perfectly for us every time and it provides costs in yen for each leg that's not covered by the pass. It was also nice to see which platform we needed to go to, and then the list of stops along the way was helpful so we could be sure we were going in the right direction!",

Actually I just realized I took a picture of the sign at the JR office, so [here it is](https://imgur.com/a/MF8l3gt) if you're interested!\n\nOur best pictures came from the north shore of Lake Kawaguchi. We took the sightseeing bus route all the way to the end (Oishi Park) and then walked back east along the edge of the lake towards Nagasaki Park. There were tons of great photo spots, and lots of cherry blossoms (since we were fortunate enough to be there while they were in full bloom). It was also easy to hop back on the bus again once we got our fill... There's a pathway along the lake there that runs beside the road, and it's a very short distance to just cross back over to the road again to get on the bus. \n\nThe view from Chureito Pagoda was still nice even though we didn't get to go to the top to get the pagoda in the photo. But I don't think it was worth the climb otherwise. My pictures from Lake Kawaguchi are the ones I ended up getting printed and they didn't require me to climb 10 billion stairs either lol",

My experience is that all the attractions on the south side of the lake close to the train station are pretty touristy and are rammed with people by 11am - it really detracts from the beauty of the lake and seeing Fuji. If you were staying overnight I\u2019d say you could hit Chureito and ropeway first thing in the morning, so it really depends what time you can get there. \n\nIf you\u2019re planning on biking around the lake, you could try to visit the Kawaguchi Asama shrine on your way to Oishi Park. It\u2019s a beautiful shrine in itself, famous for their ancient cedar trees. But there\u2019s also a path that takes you up through the trees to see a torii with an amazing view of Mt Fuji. There will still likely be a queue at the top to take a photo but in my experience is less crowded than Chureito.",

It's not too hard to get around, lots of people were taking the rail from kawaguchiko to the one near Arakura Sengen Park with us.\n\nIf you're dead set on the ropeway, try to get there early because the line did come all the way down and around the block when we got there at 2pm. Then you can bike around and if time permits, go to the pagoda. We were only able to go to the pagoda and walk around kawaguchi because of time constraints, but still felt like it was worth the trouble.\n\nMake sure you book something that is cancellable and check the Fuji cam in the morning. I think the bus will let you cancel online before the departure time for some nominal fee.",

    "postText": "As I was biking out of Kumamoto my foot slipped and the bike's Pedal slammed into the back of my leg. I wasn't going very fast, but the bike had a lot of weight on the bike. I thought it wasn't much and kept pushing forward. As time went on my leg started to swell and ache.  \nI biked with one leg to a nearby clinic and got there just 15 minutes before they closed. I wasn't able to put too much weight on my foot at this point. I was able to explain what happened to them using Google Translate. They were really kind and they stayed late. The doctor did an exam. He took an X-Ray of my ankle and found out that I have a crack on my Fibula.  The nurse helped wrap my foot to stabilize it and he told me to not put any weight on it for a few days.  They even called a Pharmacy and they were able to deliver the medications to the clinic so I didn't have to walk there.   \nI paid cash and I was very surprised. The bill for everything was only $55, In the US this would have cost $500 even if you had insurance. I was able to slowly bike to a nearby hotel with one leg.  \nI found an umbrella that I have been using as a cane. The swelling has gone down significantly since the accident, but I may have to rework this trip. It gets a bit depressing being alone in a hotel room in a foreign country where you don't speak the language, but hard times give us time to reflect.  \nI will keep you all posted!",

My brother\u2019s wife attempted a cross country bike race in America (the Trans-Am) but started to experience some knee pain halfway across Oregon. She tried really hard to push through, but ultimately had to drop out from the pain. She pushed so hard she was in a wheelchair for a month. \n\nOP, don\u2019t push it. Plans can change and that\u2019s okay, healing is what\u2019s important.",

Even your shoes should be special for long distance cycling. Roads in japan is not always flat but mostly step you should be very fit to cover good distance between the points in day light. Cycling in dark is a big no, no. Hope you can recover soon and consider my humble advice.",

This person is giving good advice that is important to keep in mind, and they are doing so in a respectful manner. \n\nI doesn't really matter how \"leisurely\" he is traveling, as OP has stated in previous posts, he is biking *every* day. That requires planning and good equipment, biking daily *will* take its toll, and its important to respect that. It doesn't seem to me that the person giving some advice is saying \"you need a 100 000 Yen bike, premium fitted bike shoes, a dedicated bike computer\".",

It's got a comfortable, upright riding position and easy gearing. And most bike tourers don't bother with clipless or special shoes. I've seen bike tourers in all sorts of body types and with all sorts of kits and there's nothing that I could pick out in the the OP's pictures that would suggest to me that he wasn't prepared. Heck, I tour with a [modified time trial bike](https://i.imgur.com/qxA9lEO.jpg). Shit happens when you're out riding. A pedal smacking the back of your leg is just one of them, and in the grand scheme of things, nothing anywhere near the worst thing that could happen, and more to the point, nothing that was a result of the OP's alleged unpreparedness. That post was more of an undeserved judging than an advice.",

This QR code is for one specific ticket.\n\nI assume the person in the station told you it's not possible to collect your ticket because you probably showed them your QR Code ticket (instead of the pick-up QR code).",

My wife didn\u2019t scan at the machine (this is important later). I was instructed by the people in the office that I had to go to the entrance gates and they would help me.

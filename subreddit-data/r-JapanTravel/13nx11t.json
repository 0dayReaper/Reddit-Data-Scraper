    "postText": "Yesterday in Tokyo me (29F) and my partner (38M) went out to a bar to watch baseball and have a beer. Out of nowhere a man came up to our table and started calling us \"european motherfuckers\" and so on and clenched his fists telling my partner that he wants to beat him up. I quickly told the staff which caused him to attack me and he had to be removed. He didn't seem drunk and the staff had never seen him before. This is our second day in Japan and now I'm worried, is this a common occurrence and should we avoid certain places to avoid trouble?\n\nEdit: I think the thread got locked because I can't reply to people directly. So here are some more details. \n\nSomeone asked how he or we knew where each other are from. I'm German, my partner is British and I got a noticeable German accent when I speak so we guess he just went off off that. I think he walked past near by us a couple times while we where there. Same goes for why we think he was american. He spoke in a North American accent but tbf he could have been from somewhere else. \n\nDid he look military: Maybe, he had a very large tattoo on his arm that was a P with an x on the bottom. I think that is a military symbol? But I don't understand what that has to do with this.\n\nSome poeple say just chill: I was super confused by this encounter and as a women I'm very rarely physically attacked. I travel a LOT and never had anyone let alone Americans be rude to me. Most other tourists are always friendly. This was soooo out of the ordinary that I thought maybe we missed something that happened here recently and we stepped onto someone's toes. That's all. Seems like there is nothing though.",

I've been to Japan 6 different times and the only time anything even remotely similar happened to us was a group of Australian guys who jokingly shoved one of my friends while he was taking a photo of a koi pond at the park. It was a light shove and they walked away laughing at his reaction. We have no idea what that was about.",

Therefore, avoiding certain places because some dudes are ill is not necessary.\n\nOne more thing: every assault should be reported to police and they deal with it. However, as a foreigner reporting anything to the police automatically puts you on the list of suspects, so it is always better not to deal with police, but ask someone local to do it.",

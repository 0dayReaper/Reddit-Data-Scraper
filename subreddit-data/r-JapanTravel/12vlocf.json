Your hotel is right next to Keihan Sanjo Station.  You want to take the subway to Yotsubashi Station and then take the Keihan to Keihan Sanjo Station.  It will cost you all of 620 yen per person and will save you a lot of time.\n\nWith your original route you will have to use either a subway or a bus once you get to Kyoto, because there is no way to use JR to get anywhere near your hotel.\n\nI think you might have a hard time getting everything in you want to do on May 4th\n\nI think you will have a hard time getting everything in on May 5th, because Nishiki Market doesn't tend to open until 10ish or later and you then need to get from there back to Kyoto Station to take a train 2.5 hours to get to Tokyo.\n\nI think May 6th is going to be very hard to impossible as well.  Kawaguchiko is 2 hours by bus from Shinjuku Station (not covered by a JR pass, there are partially covered trains, they can book out and they vary in how often they run and always take at least 2 hours as well.)  You must be inside Shinjuku Gyoen by 5:30 pm, it closes at 6.\n\nTeam Lab can sell out and you are going on Sunday.  I would check ticket availability, if you do not currently have tickets.\n\nGood luck!",

Mainly because there were trains or buses that were simply more convenient and my feet were too tired to walk and wait for a JR line haha.\n\nI would also consider cutting out the Arashiyama bamboo forest. I went yesterday and it was so crowded and underwhelming (much less dense and shorter walk than I thought). \n\nI enjoyed the street food and the river view more than the bamboo forest itself.",

Granted I know what I am doing since this is my 3rd time doing kyoto",

            "comment": "Your 6th May is probably pushing it in terms of timing. The bus is the easiest and most direct route, but if you can book a train, you can take the JR train from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko station. But you then need to take a local train or bus backwards towards Mt Fuji station or Shimoyoshida Station. Walking from Kawaguchiko station will add a lot of time. \n\nAlso allow some time to take turns for photos. There were 15-20 other people at that popular instagram spot all taking turns for a photo.\n\nAlternatively, from Kawaguchiko station, hire a bicycle for a couple of hours and do a quick cycle to the other end of lake Kawaguchi. It\u2019s a nice ride. You could then cycle to Honcho street and back. \n\nBut it\u2019s still going to be a big day.",

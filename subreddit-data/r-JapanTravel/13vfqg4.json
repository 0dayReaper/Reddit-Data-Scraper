    "postText": "Just got back from 10 days in Japan and wanted to type up a trip report to hopefully help others that are trying to plan a trip!\n\nOur trip was 5/16 - 5/28 including travel days. This was my 2nd time in Japan (first time was study abroad for 5 weeks in May/June 2016), but it was my mom &amp; sister's first time, so the goal was to include as many must-see activities as we possibly could in the short time we were there. Our days were packed to the brim however all 3 of us are fairly active and healthy so despite being absolutely exhausted by the end of each day, in retrospect we wouldn't have changed a thing in our itinerary.\n\nThat being said, our itinerary would be much too busy for the average person's first trip to Japan so keep that in mind if you use this information to plan your own trip. For example, we usually only had time to sit down and eat for one meal per day and had to eat on the go for the other meals in order to have enough time to go to all the places we wanted to go to. There was very little downtime in our trip.\n\n# Tourist Tips\n\n* **Luggage**\n   * We each traveled with 2 checked luggage since they were included in our flight. I had one full sized suitcase and one slightly smaller suitcase which both only had one side filled when I left the US. The plan was to fill the other half of the suitcases with souvenirs to bring home. Last time I went to Japan, it cost me \\~$200 to ship two large boxes of souvenirs back home, so despite having to bring a lot of luggage this saved me a significant amount of money and I will be doing this for future trips as well.\n   * Within our luggage we also packed a duffel bag to hold all our purchases on heavy shopping days and a daily backpack to hold things like our trash bag, hand towel, hand sanitizer/wet wipes, body wipes, small purchases, etc. My carry-on was a 40L backpack that I took with us when we stayed overnight in Kyoto.\n* **Money**\n   *  I brought $400 cash to exchange at the airport. I had gotten a Charles Schwab debit card before leaving which has no foreign transaction/ATM fees so I planned to use my card for whatever purchases I could then use cash for everything else. I ended up withdrawing another \u00a520000 which was just enough cash to last me the rest of our trip.\n* **Walking**\n   * Last time I went to Japan I survived wearing flat gladiator sandals basically the whole trip, but this did NOT work this time around for whatever reason (I guess we walked a lot more this time?). BRING COMFORTABLE SHOES TO WALK IN. I ended up having to buy sneakers on day 2 because I stupidly didn't think I would need them. I was more concerned about looking cute for pictures (ha) but I quickly realized that all the girls in Japan wear sneakers with their cute skirts and dresses, so I blended right in. I would also recommend bringing a second pair of shoes with you each day (in your backpack) to swap into if the shoes you are wearing start giving you blisters.\n* **Masking**\n   * We saw a lot of people not wearing masks, but the majority of people still wear masks. I would say the ratio of people wearing masks to not wearing masks was about 80:20.\n* **Trash**\n   * As many have mentioned on this subreddit, due to the lack of public trash bins I would highly recommend bringing a reusable trash bag to store your trash while you're out and about until you can find a bin. We found these cool black fabric ones with a waterproof liner on the inside that you could rinse out when it got dirty and could clip to the outside of your backpack so it wasn\u2019t with your other belongings.\n* **Restrooms**\n   * Due to the lack of hand dryers/paper towels in bathrooms we also brought hand towels as recommended, but found ourselves just air drying our hands way more often than using the hand towels as it was often more cumbersome to remove our backpacks and fish out our hand towels to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Accommodations\n\n* **Sakura Hotel Jimbocho in Tokyo**\n   * I stayed in this hostel when I studied abroad in college in 2016, so it holds a special place in my heart. You can get a single room here for cheap, and although the rooms are extremely small, I don\u2019t travel to Japan to spend time in my hotel so when looking for accommodations price is my #1 factor, not comfort. Toilets and showers are shared in this hostel and the rooms are set up coming off of a square hallway with sinks/restroom facilities in the center. The facilities don\u2019t appear to be very modern and pretty, but the water pressure of the showers is the BEST. They have other room types as well, like bunk-beds, double rooms, etc. They have a 24 hour cafe downstairs and breakfast is included in your stay. All their staff speak English &amp; Japanese (and other languages as well). They host some cool events like language exchanges and walking/jogging groups if you are more of a social person. I really enjoy the location of this hostel. You are within walking distance from the Imperial Palace and it still feels like you are in the city without it being so loud and busy like if you were to stay in Shibuya, etc. They do have other locations if you\u2019re looking for somewhere with more nightlife.\n* **The Millennials Hostel in Kyoto**\n   * This is a really modern looking hostel in Kyoto, 2 streets over from Pontocho. The facilities are gorgeous and look brand new. They are set up similar to a capsule style hotel with a bunch of rooms coming off a hallway. Your bed takes up your entire space, and you have about 18 inches at the foot of your bed to stand. You pull an opaque privacy screen down to make your room private - there is no door. You can control your bed\u2019s incline and lights through an iPhone in your room. There is storage space under your bed and on a shelf above your bed. Restrooms are shared but the showers are in one room and toilets in another. There are a lot of shared common spaces including a full stocked kitchen you can cook your meals in, but we literally only stayed here to sleep so we didn\u2019t explore those spaces. I was worried about other guests being noisy but that wasn\u2019t the case - everyone was super respectful. The price and location was great so I would definitely come back here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Daily Itinerary\n\n**Day 1 &amp; 2: Travel**\n\n* We flew out of Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Our direct flight to Narita was around $1600 after taxes, fees, and flight insurance. I had one layover the last time I flew to Japan and in the future I will only be buying a direct flight as I found this to be way easier than having a layover.\n* Once we arrived in Narita we turned on our e-sim. We chose Ubigi after reading many positive reviews on this subreddit and I highly recommend them. We had some issues getting iMessage to work despite following Ubigi's instructions to a T, so we ended up just using WhatsApp to message during the trip, however, iMessage did start working later on.\n* We decided against picking up our JR passes &amp; seat reservations at the airport because the line was long and we didn't need them for another 5 days.\n* Going through customs/immigration and grabbing our luggage only took about 20-30 minutes. There were many staff to guide you and we found the whole process to be really smooth.\n* We exchanged our currency and went downstairs to buy our tickets for Narita Express at a ticket vending machine. We got round trip tickets for \u00a53460 (keep in mind that the return ticket needs to be used within 14 days). We had purchased our Suica before leaving and put them in our iPhone wallets and they came with a balance of \u00a52000 so we didn't load money onto our cards until the following day.\n* We took the Narita Express to Tokyo Station then took a cab to our hostel in Jimbocho. We each traveled with 2 checked luggage, so we found the short and inexpensive taxi ride to be a better option than lugging 6 giant suitcases on local trains to get to our hostel.\n* We checked into our hostel. The total price per person for 11 nights was \u00a549500 (about $380).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3: Imperial Palace/Ueno**\n\n* We woke up and walked to the Imperial Palace/East Gardens. We got there right when they opened and spent about 90 minutes there. We walked back to Jimbocho to go to my favorite tempura place in Jimbocho. This place has gotten quite famous since I was last there in 2016. We were first in line at 10:45am and by the time they opened for lunch at 11:30, there was a line of 20+ people. Our lunch cost only \u00a5800.\n* After lunch we took the train to Ueno and spent some time in the Tokyo National Museum and Ueno Park. We also visited Shinobazu No Ike Bentendo Temple which is a cool temple right inside Ueno Park. While at Ueno Station, we picked up our JR passes &amp; seat reservation tickets and also put \u00a55000 on our Suica. We really enjoyed the fact that you could charge your mobile suica at a convenience store using cash - we didn\u2019t have to worry about finding the machines in train stations with the phone holders.\n* After that we walked through Ameyoko and did some shopping - I bought a super cute used Coach purse for around $65. Ameyoko seemed to have a lot more products than when I was there in 2016\u2026 but I also had more money this time around so maybe I was just paying more attention!\n* We took a train back to our hostel to drop off our shopping bags and change. We took a train to Shinjuku to go to New York Grill for our dinner reservation. New York Grill is on the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt hotel in Shinjuku and the views were incredible. We got the Spring Harvest 5-course dinner which included wagyu and it was easily the best beef I have ever eaten in my life - so juicy and buttery. The cost was \u00a523100 per person (\\~$175).\n* 25,138 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4: Shibuya/Akihabara**\n\n* We woke up and took a train to Shibuya to see Hachiko, go to the Starbucks near Shibuya Crossing, and shop at Shibuya109 and Uniqlo. It was hard for me to find any clothing that would fit me at the stores in Shibuya109 (I am a US 8/10 which is basically considered plus size in Japan) however I was able to find a cute t-shirt at Punyu's in Shibuya109 and two dresses at Uniqlo. I also bought sneakers at the Skechers store.\n* I also went to the Mega Don Quijote in Shibuya and spent about $102 on candy and snacks to bring home. Lots of fun KitKat flavors here but it was very crowded and hard to walk around with my extremely full baskets.\n* We took a train back to our hostel to drop off our shopping bags and had a quick lunch via conbini.\n* We took a train to Akihabara and bought some souvenirs and gachapon, and walked all the way back to Ameyoko where I spent another $90 on candy and snacks to bring home.\n* We took a train back to our hostel to drop off our shopping bags and change. We took a train to Ginza to go to Tempura Kondo for dinner (a Michelin starred tempura restaurant). We got the Yomogi dinner which was \u00a523100 per person (\u00a525410 after fees, \\~$195). The staff were amazing - they noticed that my sister was left-handed and set up her plates/silverware as such which was really observant. We loved the dinner, however there was WAY too much food for us; the staff recognized we were starting to get full, and asked us if we would be able to eat the next course which was ten-don. I was really concerned about being disrespectful and wasting food, so I was really glad that they noticed and asked!\n* 19,445 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5: Asakusa/Ginza/Omoide Yokocho**\n\n* We woke up and took a train to Asakusa to see Sanja Matsuri. We shopped at the small souvenir shops on Nakamise-dori and had street food at the festival for lunch. I bought an awesome goshuincho here with a wooden cover and foxes on it.\n* After being completely overstimulated, we took a train to Rikugi-en Garden to escape the crowds. This garden is a little off the beaten path, just outside the big city, but it is completely gorgeous and so worth the trip.\n* After the garden, we took a train to Ginza to window shop and go to our reservation at Higashiya Ginza for wagashi &amp; tea pairing. We had 5 wagashi paired with 5 teas that were amazing. It cost \u00a54500 per person.\n* After this, we walked to Mitsukoshi Ginza to explore the basement food floor and grab dinner. They start to discount the food as the stores near closing time, so going for a late dinner can save you a couple yen! After eating on their rooftop terrace which was beautiful, we walked to Patisserie Sadaharu Aoki Paris Marunouichi to grab dessert then headed back to our hostel to drop off our shopping bags.\n* After we ate, we took a train to Shinjuku to walk down Omoide Yokocho. We had a drink on the third floor of Bar Albatross - highly recommend! The alleyway is a lot shorter than I imagined, and very crowded as you would expect. I probably wouldn\u2019t go back here in the future but I am glad we visited!\n* 25,002 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6: Harajuku**\n\n* We woke up and took a train to Harajuku to visit Meiji Shrine and got our first goshuin.\n* After visiting the shrine, we walked back to Takeshita-dori to get lunch at Afuri Ramen. They\u2019re known for their ramen with yuzu in their broth and this was one of our favorite meals during our trip. We got there about 20 minutes before they opened and were \\~8th in line. By the time they opened, the line was stretching around the building!\n* We walked down Takeshita-dori and shopped, then went to our reservation at Mipig Cafe (mini pig cafe). This place was so cute! You can make reservations for 30 minutes or 1 hour where you sit on the floor and miniature pigs will come and sit on your lap. You weren\u2019t allowed to pick the pigs up and the staff were super kind and handled the pigs well. A 30 minute reservation was \u00a51800 per person.\n* After the pigs, we walked down Omotesando and took the train to Shinjuku to get dinner on the food floor at Isetan.\n* After we ate on the rooftop terrace (beautiful once again), we headed back to our hostel to drop off our shopping bags. We took the train to Shibuya to go to our reservation at Shibuya Sky. We got the package where you get an admission ticket including a 50 minute reservation for the sofa seats and a choice of a mini bottle of champagne or 2 beers per person, which cost \u00a55900 per person. The views were unreal and I recommend reserving the sofa seats so you can get amazing pictures. This was a highlight of our trip.\n* 21,719 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 7: Kawaguchiko**\n\n* This was our first travel day. We woke up early to take the highway bus from Busta Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko. The bus was \u00a54400 per person. We were able to get some super clear pictures of Mt. Fuji while we were on the bus and right when we arrived at the station.\n* We bought the daily unlimited bus pass for \u00a51500 which ended up not being worth it for us because we spent so little time seeing things on the bus route. First, we went to the Panoramic Ropeway. We got there about 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a really long line. By this time, Mt. Fuji was already completely covered in clouds but the ropeway was really cool and we still got some awesome panoramic pictures. They have a shop at the top where you can get ice cream and sit on some swings and take pictures.\n* After the ropeway we took the bus back to Kawaguchiko Station to get on the train to go to Chureito Pagoda. The gnats here were INSANE. We climbed up the \\~400 or so steps to the top and got some cool pictures as well as our goshuin.\n* We walked back to the station and took the train to Fuji-san Station and walked \\~30 minutes to Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Sengen Shrine. The wooded walk up to the shrine is absolutely gorgeous. We got goshuin here as well.\n* After the shrine, we walked and took a train back to Kawaguchiko Station to eat a conbini dinner, do last minute shopping, and catch our bus back to Tokyo.\n* 19,374 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 8: Kanazawa**\n\n* We woke up early to catch our 6:16am shinkansen to Kanazawa. Once we arrived, we bought the daily unlimited bus pass and took the bus to Omicho Market where we bought some souvenirs and food.\n* We walked from Omicho Market to visit Ozaki Shrine and Oyama Shrine and got goshuin at both places. My sister realized she lost her wallet at this point, but a kind soul had turned it in to the staff at Ozaki Shrine!\n* We took the bus from Oyama Shrine to Kenroku-en Garden, where we walked around, took lots of pictures, and sat down for lunch at a local restaurant.\n* After lunch, we took the bus to the Higashi Chaya district where we shopped and took pictures.\n* After that, we took the bus back to Kanazawa Station to catch our 5:57pm shinkansen back to Tokyo.\n* 20,192 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9: Kyoto Day 1**\n\n* We woke up early to pack our overnight bags and catch our 6:21am shinkansen to Kyoto, where we would be staying for one night. We decided to keep our reservation at our Tokyo hostel because 1) it was super cheap and 2) we would be able to leave all our suitcases and belongings in our rooms for when we returned to Tokyo.\n* When we arrived in Kyoto, we headed straight to our hostel to have them hold our bags before we could check in later that day.\n* After that, we took a local bus to the Arashiyama area. It was absolutely packed with school groups and tour buses. We walked up Saga-Toriimoto Preserved Street to Adashino Nenbutsu-ji Temple where it was much quieter. We got goshuin and visited the small and private bamboo grove behind the temple. We walked back down Saga-Toriimoto Preserved Street towards Togetsukyo Bridge where we stopped and sat down for lunch then continued shopping along the way. I got lots of uji-matcha here.\n* We walked back to Arashiyama Station and took a train to Kiyomizu-dera where we got goshuin, then walked to a small rooftop bar overlooking the Hokan-ji temple and pagoda and got awesome pictures and had dinner.\n* After eating, we walked back to our hostel and checked in, then slept for the night. Our 1 night stay cost \u00a55000 per person.\n* 21,545 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 10: Kyoto/Nara Day 2**\n\n* We woke up super early to check out of our hostel and head to Fushimi Inari. Our hostel held our bags while we went sightseeing for the day. We arrived around 6:45am which was so worth it - it wasn\u2019t crowded at all and we got lots of pictures of the shrine and torii gates without any people in them. We walked for about 30 minutes up the mountain then headed back to Inari Station to head to Nara.\n* Once we arrived in Nara, we spent some time with the deer then visited Todai-ji and got goshuin.\n* After that, we took a train back to Fushimi Inari to visit the souvenir shops which had not opened yet when we had gotten there earlier that day. We shopped and got goshuin, then headed to Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka to shop. We visited Ryozen Kannon to get pictures (they had closed by the time we got there) and walked down Ishibei-koji Lane and Hanamikoji Street.\n* After that, we walked back to our hostel to pick up our bags. We took a taxi to Kyoto Station to catch our 7:36pm shinkansen back to Tokyo.\n* 27,861 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 11: Tattoo**\n\n* My mom and I went to a tattoo shop near Shibuya to get matching tattoos on our wrists, then my mom spent the rest of the day shopping in Shibuya with my sister while I got another large tattoo on my shoulder.\n* After my tattoo was finished, we all met up in Ikebukuro to get gyudon for dinner.\n* 9,879 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 12: Yokohama/Kamakura**\n\n* We woke up and took a train to Yokohama where we walked the Minato Mirai 21 area and shopped and had lunch at World Porters.\n* After lunch, we took a train to Kamakura. First, we visited Hase-dera and got goshuin. I got lots of pictures of the hydrangeas even though they weren\u2019t in full bloom yet.\n* After that we walked up the road to Daibutsu and got goshuin. We walked back to Hase Station and took a train to Kamakura Station and walked the pedestrian pathway in the center of the road to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu. We got our goshuin and were able to observe a small part of a traditional Japanese wedding that was happening at the shrine, which was really cool.\n* After that, we walked back to Kamakura Station and took a train back to Tokyo.\n* We spent the night packing. I ended up completely filling my suitcases with my souvenirs and had to put even more in my carry-on bag.\n* 21,131 steps on this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 13: Travel**\n\n* We woke up and headed back to Senso-ji to grab our goshuin, since it was too busy when Sanja Matsuri was happening the week before.\n* We took a train back to our hostel and checked out around 11am, then made our way to Tokyo Station to take the Narita Express back to the airport.\n* We arrived at the airport with plenty of time before our flight so we could get last-minute souvenirs. I found a couple flavors of KitKat and Hi-Chew here that I could not find in Donki/Ameyoko - but I could not find Beni-Imo KitKat which is the flavor that I was looking for! :(\n* We flew back to O\u2019Hare and drove home from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Trip Cost\n\n* **Total trip cost:** \\~$5462.73\n   * Total spent before I left Japan (flight, JR pass, highway bus ticket, tattoo deposit, pay-ahead reservations, suica, car rental): $2562.73\n   * Total I spent in Japan (souvenirs, snacks, accommodations, transportation, meals, activities/admission, reservations, tattoo): \\~$2900\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Cost Breakdown\n\n**Airfare**\n\n* Total (USD): $1600\n\n**Accommodations**\n\n* Total: \u00a554500\n   * \u00a549500 (Tokyo hostel/11 nights) + \u00a55000 (Kyoto hostel/1 night)\n\n**Transportation**\n\n* Total: \\~\u00a564470\n   * \u00a533610 (JR pass) + \u00a54400 (highway bus) + \u00a53460 (N\u2019EX) + \u00a518000 (local trains/bus) + \u00a55000 (taxis - approximate)\n\n**Meals**\n\n* Total: \\~\u00a588510\n   * \u00a540000 (breakfast/lunch/dinner) + \u00a548510 (meal reservations)\n\n**Souvenirs**\n\n* Total: \\~\u00a5150000\n   * Goshuin, charms, matcha powder, candy, jewelry, clothing, purses, shrine offerings, postcards, etc.\n\n**Activities/Admission**\n\n* Total: \\~\u00a59800\n   * Pig Cafe, tea/wagashi tasting, shrines/temples, etc.\n\n**Tattoo**\n\n* Total (USD): $604.66",

The camaraderie between the different neighborhoods and the teamwork is so fun to witness. Seeing everyone let loose compared to typical stoic behavior by people in Japan is energizing. \n\nHaving been to sanja matsuri before it really was no different than last time I was there. I just think our circumstances and time crunch and the fact that I had seen it before made it feel a bit different. \n\nWe got there about 90 minutes before they started carrying the floats to shop. We had gotten a lot of pictures of the floats before they picked them up and by the time they started we were kind of on a time crunch, had seen what we wanted to see, and needed to head over to the next place. At that point it was shoulder to shoulder and you literally couldn\u2019t move, like you were at a complete standstill. I\u2019m not a fan of crowds even though I expected them here, and it was way more crowded than when I visited last. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect anything different, I guess that particular day I was feeling crunched for time and claustrophobic and just ready for a break from the crowds lol.",

Highly recommend if you\u2019re staying in cheap hostels!\n\nWe took the N\u2019EX from the airport to Tokyo station, then a cab from there to our hostel, so we never had to bring our luggage on local trains.",

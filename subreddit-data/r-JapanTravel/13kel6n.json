    "postText": "So I was looking to reserve a spot for the Orihime Diner for when I visit Japan this summer, but I had some confusion about the 4,000 yen reservation fee...\n\n  \nOn the reservation site, it says that the fee includes the seating, one meal, and one beverage, but when I click to refer to the menu (https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/menu/) it shows no prices near the meals (as expected) but prices next to the drinks and none near the desserts.  \n\n\nSo I was thinking that this could mean two things,\n\n1) it includes the meal, but the type of drink changes the price, and the desserts count as a meal option rather than an addition to the meal (more likely).  \n2) it includes the meal and a dessert, and the drink is extra, and the reservation site meant the reservation includes 1 meal and 1 dessert, and the drink isn't included but an addition to the order\n\nHas anyone been to the Orihime Diner and can tell me what's included in the reservation fee, and what to expect when I order there? My Japanese is weak so I wanna be prepared when I go. Thanks!",

They also have pilots living abroad so depending on the time of the day they may assign someone from a different time zone but speaking English. \n\nOne of the most impressive \"experience\" one can get in Tokyo these days imho, very glad they are riding the tourist wave and expanding to foreigners. Honestly, price is not really an issue, the whole thing will probably leave quite an impression, whatever the price you pay.",

I made sure to mention that in the 'requests' part of the reservation. \n\nI mostly said that because my communication disorder makes my mind go blank in situations I didn't think about in advance, so having to deal with that and trying to come up with a response in a language other than English is even harder.\n\nAlso, that's cool they hire people abroad, I didn't catch that when I was looking through the pilots page, I should probably take another look.",

You had the option to pick alcohol, dessert, etc also and pay the difference at the counter before you leave. this place was one of my most memorable thus far! Our OriHime\u2019s name was Carly. He spoke very good English; and what he didn\u2019t know how to say he would google translate it. We had 0 issues communicating. Your server controls an iPad on the table to show you pictures of things. Very very neat experience. Let me know how it goes, and let me know if you have any other questions :)",

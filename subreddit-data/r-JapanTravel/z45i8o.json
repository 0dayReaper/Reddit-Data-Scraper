    "postText": "Hi all. So just returned from an amazing 2 weeks trip to Japan with wife and 2 kids (age 11 and 7). Following was my itinerary:\n\nTokyo (3 days) - Kyoto (6 days - and from here took day trips to Osaka, Hiroshima) - Back to Tokyo (4 days)\n\nMy learnings (please do feel free to correct me or I might get things wrong)\n\n1. JR pass was a life saver. I can\u2019t stress enough! We took a 14 day JR pass and literally were able to save on travel cost and were able to travel to numerous places without the need to buy tickets. A lot of major station are covered by the JR line. \n\nNOTE: many at times, google will not give you JR option and will simply give you the fastest option bases on your preference. Please feel free to confirm or ask the information desk. They are so helpful, like all Japanese people. \n\n2. There are no (zero) trash cans in Japan. This came as a surprise to me as I wasn\u2019t aware of this. Please carry small bags with you to dispose of your trash. Japan is so clean. I come from Dubai and honestly, Japan takes the spot for cleanliness and zero rubbish on the streets. \n\n3. Respect Japanese culture and rules. This goes without saying. Even if masks are no longer mandatory, you will see a majority of the population wearing them. Again, it is better since, although the Japanese are considerate, it is better to abide by the same.  I was told that a lot of older Japanese generation were against the idea of opening tourism. \n\n4. This point is for the Muslims. It is not easy finding Halal restaurants. So my suggestions is to google : \u2018Indian / Pakistani restaurants near me\u2019. This way you will find numerous options and be surprised that these restaurants are Halal too, albeit it won\u2019t show on Google. Even if not Halal, the vegetable options were so tasty. \n\nImportant to note: don\u2019t assume a veg pasta will be completely veg. The tomato sauce has traces of pork in it and again the Japanese people were ever so helpful to point this out. So before ordering, please ask !\n\n5.  Google maps and Google translate are your best friends. Although many Japanese do speak English, a Google translate will il go a long way. The Japanese people are so humble and polite and will go out of their way to help. So make it easier for both of you. \n\n6.  Team labs Planet Tokyo is a must visit with the kids. Don\u2019t miss out. Book tickets in advance online to get a discount. \n\n7. The toilets are spotless clean. And they have these electronic bidets installed. Work like a charm. Easy to operate. \n\n8. When checkout from Tokyo (for a example) ongoing to another city with baggage, please ensure to make reservations a day prior in order to store your luggage\u2019s on the train.\n\n9. Check the weather forecast before you start your day. This is basic info. And surprisingly we missed this and it started to rain. Hotels are kind to lend you their umbrellas. \n\n10.  Carry coin purses. Comes in handy. \n\nI was so overwhelmed by Japan. Their people, culture and beauty. It is a must must visit. The Japanese people made it even more memorable. Please do feel free to add your pointers. I am sure I missed out on a many.",

It's probably better to get last row seats on other shinkansen lines in advance, but it's non-mandatory.",

I did before I went for the first time because (as a European) I hadn't felt the need to get one until then. Having a credit card in Japan can be really useful in certain occasions where you have to pay a big amount of money at once (like checking in to a hotel or buying Shinkansen tickets). If you have to withdraw these big amounts of money (with a fee) only to spend it all at once is really a waste of time and money.\n\nVisa is more accepted than Mastercard in my experience, but Mastercard has become increasingly accepted in the past 10 years. Also some ATM's will let me use my debit card to withdraw money.\n\nSo, to summarize: have plenty of cash money on you for small daily purchases like touristy places, temples, casual restaurants, convenience stores and of course vending marchines. And use your credit card for big purchases like hotels, expensive restaurants and long distance train tickets.",

Do get one before travel if you remember about it. Here, 90 kWh solar battery pack (don't go over the 100 kWh airplane limit) came in handy, though it weighs half a kilo! Check if your chargers support 100 V@50-60 Hz but the modern ones should. Same goes for every single piece of electrical equipment you plan to plug in in Japan.\n\nFor laundry, if you want to use coin laundry (\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc) you need a detergent or you need to find a newer one that doesn't need it and applies it automatically. They can often dry the clothes, too.\n\nLearning even a little Japanese goes a LONG way. Not only does it smooth out your encounters, but the Japanese will appreciate it, too. Some pretty much don't know any English (outside of katakana words), and it's that or the translator app.\n\nIf you floss, don't forget to get your favorite floss with you, I forgot and I have a hard time getting anything useful.",

Now that you're back would you change how you divided it up?\n\n I'm going in January with my family (3 of us, no young kids) for 11 full days total and right now we have planned 5 in Tokyo (1 daytrip to Hakone) and 6 in Kyoto (1 daytrip to Osaka and maybe 1 to Nara). Trying to decide if 6 and 5 would be better for us",

Thinking maybe I can do 4 in Kyoto 4 in Tokyo and then do a daytrip on my 5th day in Tokyo. I'm just worried about the weather not being ideal for Kyoto etc.",

First night in Narita, there was actually a very nice park with a Buddhist temple in walking distance from our hotel. The next four nights were in Tokyo, exploring different parts of the city. Then four nights in Kyoto which included a very exciting River boat ride down the Hozugawa river. Our final two nights were in Osaka. As for the weather, I don't think it should make much of a difference, a blanket of snow would make for stunning pictures, also there won't be many tourists at that time of year.",

The best bet for train travel planning used to be Hyperdia, but now that they've bollocksed up their service, your new best bet is going to be [Navitime](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/route/).\n\n2. True. But also respect their recycling rules. They're really very keen on recycling. Goes without saying.\n\n3. Reading up on culture and etiquettes goes a long way. Please don't give tourists a bad image \ud83d\ude00\n\n4. Japan in a Buddhist country. They have no concept of Halal, generally speaking. Perhaps you should consider \"when in Rome\" and just drop your non-health threatening dietary needs, so you can taste their culture, instead of your own. Similarly, I was brought up NEVER to eat raw egg, but in Japan it's totally fine, so when in Japan I can drop the belief that raw egg is dangerous.\n\n5. Plus, it can \"break the ice\" if you can come in with _sumimasen_ and then switch to English.\n\n6. There are loads of places for kids, even small kids. But it bares mentioning that strollers seems to be rare, and many non-kids oriented places are not stroller friendly.\n\n7. Agreed. I personally don't like a stream of warm water onto my bottom, but I do like the automated lid, and non-touch flush. Low-tier toilets do still exist though, so don't set your expectations too high.\n\n8. Do you mean for luggage? Only a reservation is required for so-called \"oversized\" luggage. If your suitcases/bags are of normal dimensions, a reservation is not required. A seat reservation however, it's free on the JRP and it guarantees a sit down, so I'd still recommend it wholeheartedly.\n\n9. Absolutely. Japan's rainfall is not like in my country, where it might rain for an hour and then sunshine for the rest of the day. If it rains, it RAINS. Umbrellas are a must-have. The dryest months are October and March, iirc.\n\n10. Japan is a cash country. Cash is king. Doesn't make sense to pay with a credit card for everything anyway, because your bank may deduct a per-transaction commission. For European travellers: your debit card (Maestro in my case) can ONLY be used at some ATMs, and can NEVER be used to pay for something.\n\n/edit\n\nJesus fucking christ, fuck you all for downvoting me for that one passage that I fucking stand by. Don't be such a baby. Do I go on a rant about Buddha or Allah because I'm an Atheist? Of course not. Last time I'll write a thoughtful reply. Fuck this sub.",

    "postText": "Overall I\u2019m wondering if this itinerary I planned will give me a good experience on how Kanto Tokyo is given the limited time. Just worried I might be visiting too much of the same feel (Shinjuku/Harajuku/Shibuya/Ikebukuro/Shimo), or my itinerary doesn\u2019t have much going on. If I add another day trip instead, also worried I\u2019m not relaxing too much, and I\u2019m not visiting enough districts. Hope you guys can help me with clarity on my dilemma!\n\n**Day 1: SHINJUKU**\n\n* Narita customs (coming from Philippines) to Shinjuku Hotel - 12:00-4:30PM\n* Free time (Godzilla/Donki/Store hopping) - 4:30-7:30\n* Dinner - 7:30-9:00\n* Kabukicho - 9:00-11:00\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2: IKEBUKURO/WARNER BROS TOKYO/SHINJUKU**\n\n* 8:30-9:30 - Convenience store breakfast\n* 9:30-10AM - Shinjuku to Ikebukuro\n* 10AM-2:30PM - Free time/Lunch\n* 2:30PM-3PM- Ikebukuro to Toshimaen\n* 3-7PM - Warner Bros Tokyo\n* 7-8PM - Toshimaen to Shinjuku\n* 8-11PM - Free time (Omoide Yokocho/Golden Gai/Store hopping)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3: KICHIJOJI/SHIMOKITAZAWA**\n\n* Convenience store breakfast - 8-9AM\n* Shinjuku to Ghibli - 9-10AM\n* Ghibli Museum - 10AM-1PM\n* Lunch - 1PM-2PM\n* Inokashira Park/Free time - 2PM-4PM\n* Kichijoji to Shimokatizawa - 4-5PM\n* Free time (Thrift stores, cafes) - 4-9PM\n* Dinner - 9PM-10PM\n* Shimo-Shinjuku - 10PM-10:30PM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4: TOKYO DISNEYLAND**\n\n* 7:15-9AM - Shinjuku to Disneyland\n* 9AM-9PM - Disneyland/Packed Lunch\n* 9-10:15PM - Disneyland Shinjuku\n* 10:15-11PM - Dinner\n\n**Day 5: HARAJUKU/SHIBUYA**\n\n* Convenience store breakfast - 8-9AM\n* Shinjuku to Harajuku - 9-9:30AM\n* Free time (Yoyogi, Meiji)- 9:30AM-12NN\n* Lunch (Harajuku) - 12NN-1PM\n* Free time (Takeshita, Omotesando, Ura Harajuku, Cat Street) - 1-4PM\n* Harajuku to Shibuya - 4-4:30PM\n* Free time (Hachiko, Crossing, Shibuya Sky, Center, Parco, Don Quijote) - 4:30-9PM\n* Nonbei Yokocho - 9PM-11PM\n* Shibuya-Shinjuku - 11PM-11:30PM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6: ASAKUSA/UENO**\n\n* Shinjuku to Asakusa - 6:30-730AM\n* Convenience store breakfast - 7:30-8AM\n* Free time (Sensoji Temple, Nakamise) - 8:00-9:30AM\n* Asakusa to Ueno - 9:30AM-10AM\n* Brunch - 10AM-11AM\n* Free time (Ueno Park, Ameyokocho) - 10AM-4PM\n* Ueno to Narita Airport - 4-5:30PM\n* Leaving Tokyo - 9:00PM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n1. Disneyland and Warner Bros Tokyo are non negotiables since my partner\u2019s really excited for them, but Ghibli I\u2019m looking to book on June 10 for July. I have second thoughts though, thinking that I booked too many attractions already. Did I allot enough time in my itinerary for going around Tokyo? If I were to replace this, where could I go instead to pair up with Shimokita?\n2. If I booked too many similar things, I\u2019m thinking of replacing Day 2 entirely with Kamakura/Yokohama or Enoshima. Would that leave me too little room now for going around the city? I\u2019m also going in the summer, so wondering if better to not go to Kamakura and stay in the city instead\n3. Ruled Mt Fuji out since I\u2019m going on July-Aug and it probably isn\u2019t visible then. Should I still consider?\n4. Currently going to Shinjuku 2 nights in a row. Is that too much and a waste of time? Not sure where else to best spend night life",

I ask this because Tokyo Disneyland is incredibly similar to other worldwide \"Magic Kingdom\" parks, and if you've been to Disneyland or Disneyland Paris, it's not going to be particularly different.  There are a handful of different rides and experiences.\n\nI will say that my wife particularly loves Tokyo Disneysea because it is a unique experience compared to other parks she's been to worldwide.\n\nI will also note that this is a pretty short trip - if you are coming from somewhere outside of Asia Pacific, your first two days are going to be miserable from jetlag, and I will be incredibly surprised if you can stay up through 11PM.",

Koenji is great for a more casual, neighborhood night spending drinking and eating. They also have a ton of thrift stores there that are probably more thrifty than what you'll find in Shimokitazawa. Shimokitazawa is still fun, though. I recommend Shirubee if you're getting dinner there.\n\nOther interesting neighborhoods could be Daikanyama/Ebisu/Nakameguro (all next to each other - much different vibe than the rest of the Tokyo you'll be seeing), Sangenjaya, Tomigaya, Jiguyaoka.",

Ive done the zoo and the national musuem both are very good.\n\nHave fun",

We got off the train and started just wandering around, the first spots I remember seeing were maybe host clubs. Not sure on the lagality of prostitution in Japan, which is why im assuming host clubs and not brothels. But was an interesting thing to randomly happen upon, and yeah it was esrlier so not much open. Which is how we ended up at Sunshine city and spent most of our day there. The mall is huge, but four hours im sure is plenty of time.",

I would recommend the City Hall observatory deck at night, though, it's free and has a gorgeous view of Tokyo!\n\nUeno (again, imo) is not that good or particularly interesting. If you want a bit change of scenery after a lot of city, crowded neighborhood, I would suggest the little hidden gem of Todoroki Valley. It's within Tokyo but it feels you're in a Ghibli movie , it's very peaceful... And cool, considering you're going in summer!",

I placed Ueno since it seems the most convenient place before going to Narita Airport, and also so it feels like we went to a more natural part of Tokyo for our trip.

Lot of cute old streets (especially the cats street!), onz of the oldest cemetery, and you can still reach Ueno park by walking 20 mn if you want to see it a bit (however, avoid the zoo. It's depressing...).",

            "comment": "If you can manage it in your timeline, your train to Shinjuku should take you THROUGH Yokohama, so if you can fit it in before Halloween party time that'll save you time and energy!\n\nBut also Nov 2/3 is pretty empty; Tokyo Tower is much closer to Shinjuku than it is Akihabara, and it won't take you two days to explore all the arcades in Akiba -- a lot have closed, and arcades are in other places around Tokyo as well! Maybe change Nov 2 to Akiba and Senso-ji in Asakusa, and Nov 3 to Tokyo Tower/Zojo-ji and see if there's any other things down in the Minato area you want to see? (like the Gundam just a bit farther south in Odaiba for example?)\n\nFor Nov 4 it's Shibuya Sky but there's other observation decks too (Skytree in Asakusa for one) to look into! What do you want to do in Yoyogi Park? Meiji Jingu is a huge shrine that's between Shibuya and Shinjuku, so it may be more interesting to switch out Yoyogi for Meiji Jingu in the end. Also, don't forget to say hi to Hachiko at the Crossing! \n\nHave fun!",

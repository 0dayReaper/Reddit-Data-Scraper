    "postText": "During my time in Hiroshima, Japan, I explored every nook and cranny I could find. I traveled down many streets, many alleys, walked through country paths, greeted locals, engaged with the culture in anyway I could. I decided to go to pay my respects to the biggest warship ever to be on this planet. The battleship Yamato. The battleship Yamato was sunk by the Americans in world war two, but I still wanted to pay my respects to such an impressive feat of human engineering, so off I traveled to the Yamato museum in Hiroshima.\n\n\nI heard it was closed, but wanted to see for myself. And low and behold.. it was closed. So I headed back to Hiroshima, along the way I noticed this tropical looking beach. It really caught my eye, as it was mid march at the time, cold but sunny, this beach looked straight out of Bora Bora, so I hopped of the train, and walked down to the beach\n\nI walked to the edge of the small man made pier, observed in the distance and I was approached by an elderly gentleman, he asked me if I could take his photo for him on the beach, I gladly complied and we started to chat, he introduced himself, and we started talking about life. He told me how he traveled to London as a young boy and saw a Charles Dickens play in London. We chatted, walked along the beach, and shared memories, moments and bonded. \n\nThis was deeply profound moment for me in Japan, despite myself and the gentleman being completely different generations, cultures, and countryman, we bonded so well. We parted ways, but before we did, he gave me his business card. I studied it and thanked him, I gave him the rest of my hand gel bottle, so he could stay safe, this was before we still really understood Covid around the world... We met a very young family on this beach, the young boys were very pleased to see me, and we practiced English together, they were amazed by how tall I was! \n\nThe beach seems to shut at around 5pm and some music is played in the background presumably so people fuck off. Hahaa. It was still a great experience.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/1TJZwvZ",

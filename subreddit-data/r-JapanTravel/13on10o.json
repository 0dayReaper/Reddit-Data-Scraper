    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nWe will be in Japan for the first time (finally \ud83d\ude2d) next Spring and would like your thoughts on our itinerary, especially the part for Tokyo-Fuji. Thank you so much in advance! Also, we're from SEA so jetlag won't be an issue. \n\nApologies in advance if the formatting's weird; currently on the app.\n\n**\u2022 Day 0 (Tues)**\n\n(arrival; staying around Tokyo Station or Ginza)\n\n**\u2022 Day 1 (Wed)**\n\n(planning to reach by 7/8AM for \ud83d\udcf7 and to queue for Starbucks)\n\n\u2022 Meguro River (from Naka-meguro Station)\n\n\u2022 Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo\n\n\u2022 Lunch (omakase) @ Udatsu Sushi or Sushi M, Shibuya\n\n\u2022 Lights up: 17:00-20:00\n\n\u2022 Dinner (wagy\u016b) @ Gyukatsu Motomura Shinjuku Minamiguchi or Yoroniku\n\n**\u2022 Day 2 (Thurs)**\n\n(planning to reach by 8/9AM for \ud83d\udcf7)\n\n\u2022 Shibuya: Sakura Street / Yoyogi Park / Meiji Jingu\n\n\u2022 Shinjuku: Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\n\n\u2022 Lunch @ Ichiran\n\n\u2022 Shibuya: Disney Store / MEGA Don Quijote / Nintendo / Pok\u00e9mon Center / Shibuya Sky (an hour before sunset) / Shibuya Crossing @ Mag's Park Rooftop (closes by 21:00)\n\n\u2022 Shinjuku: Godzilla head (lights &amp; sound off by 20:00) / 3D billboard (sound off by 23:00) / Golden Gai / Omoide Yokoch\u014d\n\n**\u2022 Day 3 (Fri)**\n\n(planning to reach by 7/8AM for \ud83d\udcf7)\n\n\u2022 Asakusa: Tokyo Skytree @ Sumida Park / Sens\u014dji / view from Asakusa Culture Information Tourist Center, 8th floor (opens at 09:00)\n\n\u2022 Snack along Nakamise-dori Street / nearby\n\n~ dango @ Kibidango Azuma or Momotar\u014d\n\n~ sweet bean paste balls @ Funawa\n\n~ melon pan @ Asakusa Kagetsudo\n\n~ taiyaki @ Naruto Taiyaki or Taiyaki Sharaku\n\n~ dorayaki @ Umezono\n\n~ pancakes @ Benitsuru\n\n~ matcha @ Suzukien\n\n\u2022 Akihabara: HEY Taito\n\n\u2022 (before sunset) Asakusa: view from Asakusa Culture Information Tourist Center, 8th floor (closes at 20:00) / Sens\u014dji / Tokyo Skytree @ Sumida Park (Lights up: 18:30-00:00)\n\n**\u2022 Day 4 (Sat)**\n\n\u2022 Tsukiji\n\n~ tamago @ Shouro\n\n~ ichigo daifuku &amp; Soratsuki\n\n~ lattes @ Matcha Stand Maruni\n\n~ kaisendon\n\n~ wagyu\n\n~ daifuku mochi\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7 spots:**\n\n\u2022 Tokyo Tower: Shiba Park 4th block / Motor Cycle Park / basement\n\n\u2022 Tokyo Imperial Palace &amp; East Gardens\n\n\u2022 Chidorigafuchi Moat\n\n\u2022 Inokashira Park\n\n\u2022 15:55 train from Tokyo Station - Kawaguchiko Station via Ch\u016b\u014d Line (IC)\n\n**\u2022 Day 5 &amp; 6 (Sun &amp; Mon)**\n\n\u2022 Chureito Pagoda\n\n\u2022 Shimoyoshida Honcho Street / Lake Kawaguchiko / Panoramic Ropeway / Lawson Lake Kawaguchiko Ohashi\n\n**\u2022 Day 7 (Tues)**\n\n\u2022 in case Mt Fuji got shy the day before, repeat above itinerary\n\n\u2022 head to Gotemba - Kyoto\n\n**Questions:**\n1. I like to take photos so you'll see that on some days, there'll be back and forth travelling so that I can capture certain places both in the morning and at night; any changes I should make for any of the days to make it more efficient in terms of getting around?\n2. Am I putting too many activities in a day?\n3. Any recommendations on where to get good coffee and h\u014djicha lattes? I tried Google and it was difficult to find the latter.\n4. There are certain restaurants that we'd like to try, which I've listed down, but mostly we'll just do a quick Google search for nearby restaurants; if you have any recommendations, we'd appreciate it!\n5. I'd really like to see Mt. Fuji hence the 3N stay (3 chances to see it in the morning &amp; afternoon) but I'm not sure if I should scrape it altogether since it's so dependent on the weather and I'd have to book accommodations in advance (so if the weather for the days I booked turn out to be bad, I won't be able to cancel them; and also those days could be used to explore Tokyo more). Thoughts?\n6. In case we do go ahead with Fuji, we're planning to bike around since we don't have an international driver's license; would this be feasible?\n7. Also, any recommendations on the route from Fuji to Kyoto? When I checked Google Maps, most of the routes bring us back to Tokyo then Kyoto. I chanced upon a route that led to Gotemba then Tokyo but now it's gone; is this route uncommon?\n\n**Edit: formatting.**",

We went last april on a weekday afternoon and it was very quiet. Also, while there are definitely some cherry blossom spots worth checking out, be prepared to face crowds in those places. During the sakura season you will be able to find cherry blossoms everywhere. In random streets, in small parks, in small temples. You might have a more relaxed experience.",

I would just allow more time to buffer in between connections if you need to catch a train as the highway bus timing is dependent on traffic.\n\nEven if you can't see Fuji I think it's a nice break to be somewhere less hectic between Tokyo &amp; Kyoto/Osaka.  It will give you some time to rest and enjoy nature.  There are a few sightseeing bus lines but can't comment on how effective or crowded these are at getting around the lakes:\nhttp://bus-en.fujikyu.co.jp/heritage-tour/detail/id/1/\n\nEdit:  you can also check out Fuji Shibazakura Festival (moss phlox) depending when you are there",

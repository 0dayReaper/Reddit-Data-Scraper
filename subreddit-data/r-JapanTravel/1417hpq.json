It looks like a beautiful area in its own right and maybe we\u2019d decide to do it anyway if we felt like getting in some nature and a hike, but I would prioritize it less as an option on our itinerary if the leaves are likely not to have started turning at all.",

In Kanto you could have some luck depending on the temperature this fall. \n\nNikko, Hakone, Oze, Nasu, Minakami, Tanigawa are good destinations not that far from Tokyo. Most likely would have autumn folliage. But really tricky to plans months ahead. But anyhow these are nice places even without the red leaves.",

But if you want to see autumn folliage at that time, the easiest way would be to go to Nikko, Oze or Nasu. \n\nMore exact forecast will be known in September I think. If it's extremely warm or cold autumn, the schedule of autumn folliage might shift.\n\nThe most detailed resource for autumn leaves is this page (in Japanese, but works with autotranslate in Chrome/Safari):\n\nhttps://koyo.walkerplus.com/",

Also, assuming you\u2019re traveling in on a long-haul flight, you will be exhausted when you arrive - and then traveling to Kyoto on top of it. Maybe think about doing a night in Tokyo just to settle in and take a Shinkansen the next morning/afternoon.",

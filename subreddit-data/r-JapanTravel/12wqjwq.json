    "postText": "  \n\nHi Everyone- I just got back from a 7 day trip to Tokyo with my 11 year old daughter.\n\n**Big Picture:** Stayed in Tokyo for our trip (as opposed to splitting with a few days in Kyoto or Osaka). Appreciating that everyone has their own style of travel, we were happy with our decision to just stay in Tokyo. There is so much do in Tokyo and having 7 days allowed us a more relaxed approach.\n\n**Hotels:** I had a ton of points saved up from work travel so we stayed at the Grand Hyatt Roppongi for first few nights. It was a wonderful hotel, great service etc. I think for my daughter having a western style hotel for the first few days helped ease into things. It\u2019s obviously a splurge without points but well located and nice experience.\n\nWe moved to Ryokan Asakusa Shigetsu  ([Hotel Website](http://www.shigetsu.com/en/index.html)) for the last few nights which was fun to experience a Japanese style accommodation with tatami mats etc. There was also a traditional plunge bath on the top floor which was fun to try as well.\n\n**Itinerary:**\n\n**Day 1:** Arrived mid-afternoon to Narita Terminal 1. Pleasantly surprised with relatively short lines (&lt;1 hr from landing to clearing customs). Booked the limo bus to hotel at the counter \u2013 would recommend a bit more than other options but simplicity of door-to-door service was great after a long flight.\n\n**Day 2:** Started with Meji Shrine in Harajuku then cruised down Takeshita Street. My daughter loved the sweets / snacks that lined the street. As an FYI, we saw most of the same options or similar elsewhere later in the trip. My daughter was very interested pet cafes \u2013 I had some reservations from an animal welfare perspective but after some research we tried Mame-Shiba Cade on Takeshita Street ([Google Map Link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Harajuku+Mame+Shiba+Cafe/@35.6709467,139.7055971,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x60188d42665a8813:0x3613a4d93ddc3123!8m2!3d35.6709467!4d139.7055971!16s%2Fg%2F11g2kptk92)). We arrived just before they opened and still waited for 15 minutes which then gives you a specific time to return \u2013 the line was huge by the time we left so I\u2019d suggest going early. My daughter loved it and was a highlight for her. The dogs were super cute and it seemed well run and the animals well taken care of (they rotate the dogs so they can take breaks).\n\nWe then walked to Shibuya Crossing popping into stores and cafes along the way. Stopped for ice cream at Nanaya Aoyama ([Google Map Link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nanaya+Aoyama/@35.6603014,139.704928,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x60188c71bbc2be69:0xe419747c185ec897!4m6!3m5!1s0x60188b5f20f9d365:0xfd79f7e97c7d2459!8m2!3d35.6603014!4d139.7075029!16s%2Fg%2F11c1tkw4dj)) \u2013 would recommend. Have great green tea ice cream with 7 levels of intensity! \n\n**Day 3:** Day trip to Kamakura. About an hour trip via train \u2013 temples and more rural setting was a nice change of pace from Tokyo. We roughly followed this walking itinerary ([Kamakura Walking Tour Link](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3121_kamakura_full.html)) which worked well and was a nice mix of hiking and temples.  We had lunch at Chayakado ([Google Map Link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chayakado/@35.3276806,139.5547705,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601845bce23b671d:0xf43bdb1f53582c47!8m2!3d35.3315669!4d139.5510369!16s%2Fg%2F1tr17jm7)) which services Nagashi somen \u2013 basically noodles served down a bamboo chute and you catch them with chop sticks. It was a unique and tasty meal. \n\n**Day 4:** TeamLabs &amp; Odaiba: Much has been written about TeamLabs \u2013 it was a highlight of the trip for my daughter and I thought very unique. We booked the first time slot which I would highly recommend. We were able to experience most of the rooms with only a few people. We actually looped through a second time and even by then (an hour later) started to feel very crowded. We then explored the Toyoso market down the street got some food at the cafes and explored the shops. Took the monorail to Odaiba after and my daughter explored a few rides at Joypolis. I thought this part was underwhelming and would skip next time. Odaiba was mostly just a big series of malls and Joypolis was a little tired and the rides just OK.\n\n**Day 5:** Visited Nezu museum \u2013 smaller museum but gardens are wonderful hidden gem. Walked to Gonpachi Nishiazabu after \u2013 apparently the inspiration for the restaurant fight scene in Kill Bill! Nice atmosphere and pretty good food. Went to Tokyo Tower after. Nice view but not really higher than towers nearby include Roppongi so left wondering if deck there or Skytree might have been a better choice.\n\n**Day 6:** DisneySea. Couldn\u2019t book tickets directly so did so via Klook which worked fine. I\u2019d recommend bringing the paper tickets as you need to scan them into the Disney app after you enter.  If you can, try to find less busy days using the crowd tracker ([http://www15.plala.or.jp/gcap/disney/](http://www15.plala.or.jp/gcap/disney/)). We were there on a \u201clight blue\u201d day. Lines for the most part were pretty reasonable (20-40 minutes) with the exception of a couple of really popular rides. We did use the Premier Access to ride Soaring Fantastic Flight and Toy Story which had 90 and 75 minute waits all day \u2013 it was a splurge but freed up a lot of time to enjoy the rest of the park (and were our favorite rides!)\n\n**Day 7:** Visted Tokyo National Museum. There was a oyster focused food festival set up in the park just outside which was a fun option for lunch. We then went to the pond and rented a paddle boat \u2013 I\u2019d recommend getting either the non-swan boat or a row boat. The neck and body of the swan really limits the views.\n\n**Day 8:** Visited East Gardens at the Imperial Palace \u2013 they really are wonderful. Then to Asakusa to visit Sensoji Shrine and shops neaby. We were there on a Saturday and it was super crowded FYI but loved the food / sweets from all the little shops. Took the Kesei Limited Express to Narita which worked well \u2013 was cheaper and didn\u2019t have to make a connection to other train options.\n\nIf anyone is still reading, I hope the above was helpful! I was a long-time lurker here while planning my trip. I thought I would try to pay it forward with my own trip report. Happy to answer and questions.",

My interest in this kind of day trip started in reading about Nara which sounded wonderful but wasn't going to make it on the itinerary this trip.  So, I was looking for closer day trips that had some nature / temple cultural elements.  Nikko felt a bit far which was the other option I looked into but I can't speak from personal experience on the tradeoffs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe really enjoyed Kamakura - the temples were beautiful and the hikes in between were a nice way to link them together without being too much to ask of a jet lagged 11 year old. The temples themselves were also relatively uncrowded and a bit calming thank the bustle of those in Tokyo which made for a contemplative experience (Hasedera in particular was our favorite for this reason).  Also great that the route in the link above ends in town for fun food and shopping to recharge before heading back to Tokyo.  Hope that helps!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso shout out to /u/SofaAssassin who suggest Kamakura in the Q&amp;A thread! Much appreciated.",

Very few people on the trail it was nice. Buddha was BUSY on a week day - we rode the bus to it and there was lots of traffic. We walked the shopping street near by it was ok.  \n\nAnother place close to kamakura was enoshima.  That was super cool! You climb up the steps or use the paid escalator to get to the top where you can get on the space needle and get a great view of Fuji.  Unfortunately due to Chinese desert dust you could barely see it. Neat place!",

First, I didn't appreciate how valuable leaving flex time would be.  It turns out my daughter really appreciated and like the the gardens (which was a surprise to me) so we were able to add a few things along those lines that she really liked (her favorites were the Nezu museum garden, Imperial Palace East Garden and Hasedera in Kamakura).  Second, I wish I had done made a few reservations on restaurants.  While we had some great meals on the fly, I think we missed out a bit on some more popular and / better fit for us places because I was tracking down last minute or were already booked.",

Like most people, we woke up super early at first (4am the first day!) so we tended to get breakfast when it opened then head out to things when they opened (definitely recommend for TeamLabs / Dinsey).  By mid-afternoon, she was kind of toast and we'd chill at the hotel for a couple hours before dinner.  Worked well for us and kept it relaxing but sacrificed some items on our itinerary.  We intentionally left DisneySea until late in the trip so were on a more normal schedule but it was a long day left hotel at 7am and got back at 9pm.  But, other than a little later start the next day she bounced back.  Hope that helps!",

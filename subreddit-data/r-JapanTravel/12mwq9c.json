    "postText": "I\u2019ll start with a disclaimer by saying that I look after my hygiene. Not to an extent that prevents me from doing things, but I always take necessary measures to avoid unsanitary situations.\n\nAm a bit in a rush atm and this post is 50% vent so:\n\n1. Organisation is lacking. We had a timed entry (30 minute slot). We were only let in after 30 minutes after our 30 minute slot. It was raining and they keep the whole queue outside and had no tents. Make sure to have an umbrella if it\u2019s raining. \n\n2. The whole set up is a little \u201ctired\u201d. You can tell it\u2019s due for an upgrade which I guess is coming soon. Especially the experience where you are ankle deep in the water - the underwater floor has its lining coming off and it\u2019s like ewwww when you touch it.\n\n3. I did expect having to be barefoot the whole way but hoped for rinse stations between stations. There were none apart from the one on the entry. I saw a giant patch of mould upon entry to one of the water stations. That\u2019s fucking insane. \n\n4. Experiences itself are cool\u2026for 2000s. In 2023\u2026meh. I\u2019ve seen better. \n\n5. The smell. Gosh. If you have been to a ski room, you know the one.\n\nSo far, the most underwhelming experience in Tokyo. Especially given the hype on this sub and tickets that I bought ages ago.",

You could hardly move for people, and everyone is treating it like their own personal photo shoot. I was so excited to go but felt really disappointed by the end. I thought the art installations ranged from ok to beautiful, but it was difficult to really enjoy them with the amount of people.",

I was one of the last groups to go in before closing, so I didn't have an entrance delay. It also wasn't as busy as it could have been. \n\nThe only negative I had there was other tourists. Not that I'm a perfect tourist, I'm sure I do many things wrong, but a lot of people were sooo disrespectful when I went. People were using camera flash repeatedly even after workers told them to stop, they were touching things they weren't supposed to, pushing those giant light-up bulbs around, and just blocking things so they can get good pictures. In the flower-ceiling room, people just refused to leave and would run away from the workers. They were also touching the flowers. I found myself pretty cranky throughout as a result, my partner said his experience was soured a bit as well.",

I had to push it out of my mind that I was walking in a giant kiddie pool with tons of others.... I didn't see any floating bandaids, haha. But the display on the water was amazing.

At least half the people at teamLabs are gonna be entitled, dumb, take way too many photos, etc. but take it for what it is and enjoy. I would do it again, but I\u2019d suggest people do it once",

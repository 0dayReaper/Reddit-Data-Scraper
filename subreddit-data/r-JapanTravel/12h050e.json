    "postText": "If anyone is tall and is interested in riding Imabari to Onomichi one way, I thought I would just provide a quick trip report that I did during the sakura season. \n\nIf you are over 187cm (6\u20192\u201d) the cheaper bicycle hire place had one large-ish frame available, without a reservation. A Y3000, this is a much cheaper option that gives you extra hours (opens at 8am). The cheaper bicycle was a 24 speed Giant Escape in size M. It looked in very good condition (tyres, brakes, gears, etc) and a lot better than some of the no gears hire bikes, I've ridden.\n\nhttps://www.giant.co.jp/giant22/bike\\_datail.php?p\\_id=00000038\n\nI reserved an ML sized road bike from giant for Y8800 including a one way fee. I was glad that I did as the better bike allowed me with reasonable fitness to do the standard course with a few detours. If you want to save the Y5800, then probably could roll the dice and always book the giant road bike at the last minute.\n\nI stayed at Imabari Urban Hotel. It\u2019s only bookable via Japanese websites, so use google lens/translate and book there, getting a good night\u2019s rest before the big ride (avoid the snorers in the hostel). They looked after my luggage for Y2200, which was super easy and same day delivery.\n\nGiant opens at 9am, so first detour was via Imabari castle. It\u2019s lit up at night and is worth visiting twice (during the night and the day). (+6km)\n\nSecond detour was very quick to the Kurushima Strait Observatory (+1km)\n\nThird detour was up a rather steep hill to Kirosan Observatory which is the flip side of the first (+8km - in and out)\n\nI think the first bridge is the most impressive and worth seeing from both sides.\n\nLast detour was to Hirakiyama park. This was great. Heaps of cherry blossoms and other flowers, with a large slide and food stalls. (+8km - loop).\n\nAfter that it was a pleasant cruise to the finish.\n\nAt Onomichi, the ferry across the water is super easy, comes every 5 minutes and charged a crazy Y10 to take my bicycle. I took the second ferry to get my distance up but the Giant store is closer to the first ferry.\n\nI had enough time to do a quick lap of Onomichi before returning the bicycle at 18:25 and ensuring the GPS ticked over to 100.5km\n\nFinally this is the best map to get\n\n[https://shimanami-cycle.or.jp/download/cycling/cycling\\_map\\_en.pdf](https://shimanami-cycle.or.jp/download/cycling/cycling_map_en.pdf)\n\nRecommended!",

    "postText": "Hi there! My husband and I are planning a trip to Japan in March 2024 and this is the first version of my itinerary. I know it's full. I know we should spend longer there... but until we hear back from both of our jobs re: PTO this is what we've got to work with. His must-do includes anything WW2 related and mine is more for nature (and Disney!) Let me know how we can possibly make this work and any other tips about traveling to Japan. (What do we pack? wear? etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1: Fly into Tokyo**\n\n**Day 2: Full day Tokyo**\n\n**Asakusa** : Neighborhood rich in tradition exemplified in the architecture and markets.

Tokyo may be convenient with transit but need to account for train times, getting lost in the station (it will happen at least once) and then just walking out of the station to your destination...\n\nUnless you get more time off from work (hoping you do!), I would recommend dropping an area (either Nagasaki or Kawaguchiko). I think 10 days will be good for Tokyo and Kyoto, day trip to Hiroshima and/or Osaka. Or Tokyo/Kawaguchiko/Kyoto.\n\nHave fun planning!",

I\u2019d built a full spreadsheet for the things we wanted to see and do\u2026 and I can tell you there are far too many incidentals and normal things to factor in for you to accomplish an itinerary this packed. Expect to get half of it done. This is a good thing though since you shouldn\u2019t try to speed run the densest city on the planet lol. Half of the stuff worth checking out is stuff you\u2019ll find as you wander around. Plus\u2026 food. There\u2019s no food baked into your plans and I can assure you that you will happily spend time on food (unless Japanese food isn\u2019t your thing?). For that reason alone, I\u2019d cut your plans significantly.\n\nPick your \u201cmust see\u201d items and ensure you get those done. Everything is should just be icing on the cake if you can get to it.\n\nAlso, the Arashiyama Monkey Park and Fushimi Inari hikes take up more time than you\u2019d think (but are super worth it). And with how beautiful Kyoto is in general, my advice is to *slow down* while you\u2019re there and really take in the beauty. Getting ice cream at a shop near Kamo River was a fantastic way to spend an hour or two with friends. Revel in the beauty while you\u2019re there.\n\n2nd also, shrines do start to feel a little bit like \u201cseen one, seen them all\u201d after a while. I don\u2019t recommend trying to visit all of them (and there are TONS). Hit a few of the big ones and then press on. There\u2019s just too damn much to see everywhere.",

I\u2019m a relatively active 27 year old who\u2019s on her feet all day for a living, and I did fushimi inari on a seperate day from kiyo, you don\u2019t have to go all the way to the top I suppose, but the elevation gain is 700 feet spread out over something like 12,000 steps, and the whole area leading up to kiyo is also uphill.

Also are you planning to visit Land or Sea?\n\nI think you could maybe make day 4 work depending on where you are staying in Tokyo and Kyoto and how early you leave in the morning.\n\nI think day 5 is going to be exhausting.\n\nI think day 6 is going to be very hard, we took a morning direct train between Kyoto and Hiroshima and didn't get to Miyajima until after 11 and we pretty much made a connection in Hiroshima Google hadn't thought we could.\n\nAgain, a lot depends on where you are staying.\n\nI think the Nagasaki 1/2 day and then going to Kawaguchiko is going to be long, and yes even with a domestic flight.\n\nI think you are not really getting much nature because you are constantly on the move.\n\nI think you will have a hard time walking Mt. Inasa at daybreak unless you plan to climb it from the bottom, because none of the public transit starts running until 9:00 am\n\nPlease see Getting There:\n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4412.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4412.html)\n\nIt's going to take you a minimum of 45 minutes by bus to Nagasaki Airport, you should give yourself at least 1 hour before a domestic flight, the flight is 2 hours.  There is one direct bus a day from Haneda to Kawaguchiko and it is at 2:40 but won't get to Kawaguchiko until after 5.  If your flight gets in earlier you can go up to Shibuya or Shinjuku or Tokyo Station to look for transport but you still have like 2 hour+\n\nGood luck!",

As an example day, we are doing Harajuku in the morning, Happy Pancake for late lunch, and shopping in Shibuya. That is one day of our trip. \n\nI understand the impulse to pack your trip, but attempting to speed run everything is far more likely to leave you feeling how much you missed than how much you saw. \n\nYou won\u2019t have time to breathe, stop in to places you see along the way\u2014 in fact you would not have the literal time in that one day to do all the things on your list. Day two should be two days. \n\nWith Day 5 in Kyoto, not only is it not doable but you will miss the opportunity to experience a historic city and enjoy the relaxed pace. You\u2019ll be running around trying to hop from one place to the next.\n\nI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re seeking advice here because I want you to have an absolutely amazing trip that you can fully enjoy!

            "comment": "Like what a few others have said here is just reconsider packing too many things into a day. You can get a thoroughly enjoyable holiday in this short of a time if you plan out your key activities for each of the days and leave the others as a \u201cstretch\u201d target.\n\nWe just came back from our third trip to Japan and one thing I always forget is how long it takes to travel around everywhere. Especially in Tokyo. It is a BIG city. You WILL feel like you\u2019re just running around to every thing and you may be upset to only hit a few of the things you planned.\n\nThat said, you haven\u2019t said whether this is actually the type of holiday you like to do. Some people like box ticking trips, so if that\u2019s you then all good.\n\nMarch is a nice time of year, it can be a bit cool and but is starting to get warm. We were there in mid April and temperatures were around 20-25 degrees Celsius in the daytime in Tokyo. I wore a mix of shorts and jeans with a tshirt depending on the day.",

    "postText": "Hi all!  I've made a very last minute decision to go to Japan end of the month for a little solo trip as a reward for a new job!\n\nMinus flight days I will be in Japan for 9 days!\n\nMy current plan is to split the time between Tokyo and Osaka and Kyoto.  I've been to Tokyo twice and have done some of the major tourist things already (Skytree, Shibuya, Akiba ect) but both times were relatively short so I want to take advantage of this solo trip and explore a bit more of the smaller places!\n\nI plan on travelling relatively light and probably will stay in some capsules or hostels and hopefully will make some friends!\n\nHere is what I've got so far!\n\n**Day 1**\n\n1. Flight Arrives 4:30 PM\n2. Activate JR Rail Pass (7 day)\n3. Go to Osaka\n\n**Day 2**\n\n1. Osaka exploration\n2. Tsurugyu for Dinner!!\n\n**Day 3**\n\nUniversal?\n\n**Day 4**\n\nNara Day trip\n\n1. Todai-ji\n2. *Deer park*[https://thenavigatio.com/nara-itinerary-one-day-trip/](https://thenavigatio.com/nara-itinerary-one-day-trip/)More Osaka at night\n\n**Day 5**\n\nKyoto Early Morning(stow bag at locker)\n\n1. *Fushimi Inari Shrine*\n2. *Kichi Kichi*\n3. Higashiyama Ward\n\n**Day 6**\n\n1. Arishiyama Bamboo Grove\n2. *Kinkaku-ji*[https://thenavigatio.com/2-day-kyoto-itinerary/](https://thenavigatio.com/2-day-kyoto-itinerary/)\n3. Walk around\n\n**Day 7**\n\nJR to Tokyo\n\n1. *Teamlabs*\n2. *Ghibli Museum*\n3. *Capyneko*\n\n**Day 8**\n\n1. *Cup Noodle Museum*\n2. *Gundam*\n3. Muscle Girls\n\n**Day 9**\n\nDisney or more exploring!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nItalicized ones are things I REALLY want to keep in.  Everything else is negotiable.  Day 5 and 6 are interchangeable!  I'd like to go to Arishiyama in the morning but if it's a better idea to leave my luggage at the hotel instead of in the lockers then I'll switch the days around and go check in first before I do anything.  I can always go Arishiyama after Kinkaku-ji if I have time.\n\nAside from Tsurugyu, Osaka Castle and Namba Station I don't have much idea for Osaka.  Definitely want to indulge in Osaka style okonomiyaki and some street markets.\n\nIf there's any more localized things that aren't super English friendly that's okay too.  I have basic Japanese conversational and reading skills so language barrier isn't a huge issues for me (plus google translate hahaha).\n\nI don't think I will go both Universal AND Disney, but again if I make some friends there I'll go, otherwise I don't mind skipping both or just doing one or the other!  I do like scary rides but I also enjoy artistic rides so I'd love to hear everyone's suggestion on what's a better visit!\n\nI haven't booked anything yet but will be going to a travel agency locally for my JRPass and will ask them about tickets for some of the museums.  If there's anything I can add in or sub out please leave suggestions!\n\nThank you!",

Is it doable / recommended to lump both in one day? \n\nBtw Ghibli is close to Kichijoji which we have read is consistently rated as one of the most desirbe neighborhoods in Tokyo so worth looking to see if you are interested in spending some time there",

I personally like to explore so having things far reduces time crunch and forces me to be out and about!  I\u2019m doing them separately now though because theres a capybara cafe and the muscle girl diner near Ghibli that I want to go to, and teamlab also ran out of morning slots, but the original plan was team as soon as it opens before I hit up Ghibli!",

Depending on where you want to avoid and go I'd suggest finding a small town near Tokyo/Osaka and visiting there! I went to Gifu and ended up spending an entire day there because of how beautiful it was!\n\nBest of luck!!!",

Universal is great, but I find it to be more congested and crazy than the Disney parks. The wizarding world and Nintendo land are worth seeing for how immersive they are, but every part of Disney sea is that level of immersive, whereas the rest of USJ is just kind of\u2026. A theme park.",

I do plan on leaving for the 8-8:30AM trains and want to stay around Ginza so I\u2019m close to the station so I can drop off bags really quickly at wherever I book, and be there for 12-12:30, or should I save a full day and hit it up as soon as it opens?",

I still think about disneysea to this day I want to back and spend a longer time there + go to Disneyland next time. \n\nI too was worried about the rides but it was no problem. Majority of the time I sat alone for the 2 ppl rides vs. single riders rides is when I sat next to someone. Rides happen so quick there's not enough time to small talk. \n\nPeople are honestly so nice too! You'll have a great time alone.",

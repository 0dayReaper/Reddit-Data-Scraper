    "postText": "*Original itinerary [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/133g0w6/11_days_first_time_in_japan_trip_halal_itinerary/) for reference. We planned this trip primarily with Halal food in mind, along with regular sight-seeing locations + shopping for Switch games, clothes, and souvenirs*\n\n**Overall notes / Takeaways**\n* It was a great time with the authentic halal Japanese food, seeing all the cool sights &amp; places, and experiencing a very nice environment + culture. \n\n* The amount of researching / pre-planning can be a double-edged sword. Things that were unexpected were some of the best experiences. At the same time, if we tightened our itinerary and squared away some details better: we could have saved some cash, lessened on-the-spot deliberations / route planning;  and perhaps, squeezed a few more places to visit. \n\n* Biggest mis-planning: we did not realize until after-the-fact that the 14 day JR Pass was not cost efficient for us, especially with our hotel locations utilizing local lines + better planning luggage situation\n\n* For our trip with the Halal dietary restriction, it would have been helpful to pickup a sim card for a Japanese phone # to make some reservations ourselves and taxi\u2019ing around in Kyoto when we got tired of walking around. At the end of some of the shopping trips, the 10-15 minute walk back to the hotels were very tiring, and the cost estimates on Google didn\u2019t seem too expensive for short trips.\n\n\n---------\n\n\n*Notable Highlights Part 1: Asakusa*: \n\n* Ueno Park was our favorite part from this portion of the trip - even though it was raining, there were so many unexpected sights! We thought Edo Castle Ruins would be closer to like how Ueno Park was. \n\n* Getting lucky at the halal yakiniku place for dinner without a reservation! Being there at open and the rain may have helped.\n\n*Notable Mid-light*: \n\n* Going to Akibahara twice since the first time where second trip ended up mostly window shopping. We went to different stores each day, and it was really only the first night where we actually bought stuff. \n\n* *Notable Low-light*: Unable to reserve actual Tokyo Skytree Towers tickets.\n\n\n**Notable Highlights Part 2: Kyoto** \n\n* Experiencing all the nature on our WED was our favorite part of this portion, especially the rivers! We did not realize the \u201c20 minute walk\u201d at the Monkey Park would end up a 45 minute hike. We were not prepared, but it was a very fun going up and taking breaks at all the stops.\n\n* We did not expect downtown Kyoto to be as lively and cool at night as we saw it, and we did not expect Kyoto to be where we\u2019d get a lot of our shopping done.  The Surugaya here had the most Switch games I purchased at best prices (and the anime bins for trinkets as souvenirs, my wife had a lot of fun here); Gion had a lot of other souvenirs; and downtown had a lot of clothes.\n\n* Notable Low-light*: fatigue and foot pain at the end of those days when we did a lot of shopping, especially traveling between different stores. Some benches really would have helped. We did buy Dr. Schultz insoles and cooling pads for our feets at the pharmacy stores here, which helped with some exhaustion, but not all.\n\n\n**Notable Highlights Part 3:  Shibuya/Shinjuku**\n\n* The Ramen with the Fried Chicken @ Honolu Shinjukugyoenmae  was my favorite meal, especially coming back to it so many times!\n\n* Friday congregational prayer at  Tokyo Camii Center: the sermon was done in 4 different languages - that impressed me along with its architecture. It was such a peaceful and familiar experience in a new environment. They gave out some food after (rice+natto I believe plus sesame ball sweets I believe), although we passed since we were still full from lunch.\n\n* Shibuya Scramble was always fun to walk across! Busiest crosswalk in the world!\n\n* Tower Tokyo tour was the nicest tower experience that I\u2019ve had (they served us Lemonade!) and my wife got to take a photo with the Tokyo Tower Mascot, Noppon.\n\n* Mega Don Quijote at Shibuya to finish up the bulk of our shopping, especially on souvenirs! Especially picking up Zelda Tears of Kingdom at release day!\n\n* Gundam Base &amp; live Gundan Unicorn transformation @ Odaiba Diver City! My wife went into it mostly blind, and was very impressed.\n\n*Noteable Mid-light*: Harajuka and Takeshita street were cool to window browse, but we didn\u2019t find anything we actually wanted to purchase here. It made me realize, like our second time at Akihabara, that window shopping isn\u2019t as fun as actual shopping.\n\n-Aside from the Gundam @ Odaiba, we didn\u2019t get too excited about anything else here. If we visited here first / sooner, we may have had a better time. I think we ran out of gas at this point.\n\n*Notable Low-light*: \n* The last hotel for me, especially with its location being furthest out from nearest station and not being as nice as the first two hotel.\n\n* The Subway sandwiches (shrimp and tuna respectively) were pretty sad on SAT. \n\n* Though not part of the actual trip, on upon LAX arrival: the lack of cleanliness, customer service and organization were immediately noticeable, which reflected on how nice Tokyo &amp; Kyoto were!\n\n\n---------\n\n\n**Other notes**\n\n* **Biggest shoutout to my wife for being with me and her patience, especially while Switch game hunting and being chaotic while planning!** \n\n* *Hotels*: all our hotels were listed as 3 star hotels. We learned that every minute walk closer to the nearest station(s) really makes a difference \u2013 i.e. a 5 min walk back to the hotel wasn\u2019t as bad as a 7-8 minute walk, and 10-12 minute walks back where the worst. We did keep an eye on square footage for the rooms (wanted to avoid less than 150 feet\u00b2 for 2 people). We averaged around $95 USD per night.\n\n* Henna Tokyo Hotel - Asakusa was a very nice hotel, especially with the animated front desk and great first time with bidets and warm toilet seats which the other hotels did not have.  183 feet\u00b2 which felt small but sufficient.\n* Second hotel - Kyomachiya Ryokan Sakura Urushitei in Kyoto - was a bit further from local bus points, but this was also a very nice hotel, especially as a Ryokan with great customer service and hidden shelve compartments in the room. We also did not expect a 2nd floor for the private garden view, which was also very nice. 156 feet\u00b2 would have been small by itself, but pretty sure this does not account for the 2nd floor.\n* Our last hotel, Cloud Himalaya felt like a re-designed local apartment, so it didn\u2019t feel as nice, but it was the most spacious @ 291 feet\u00b2. It was the furthest away from the local stops/stations. It was a low-light for me, especially compared to the first two hotels. My wife thought it was okay though: she thought it was comfy and the space inside the room made up for it.\n\n* **-Local Transportation:** We only got on the wrong train once, and it was on our first night when leaving HND airport. For the rest of the trip, we didn\u2019t have much issues. The learning curve for us was short to navigate the trains with GoogleMap, by looking at train departure times on our phone directions and platform # to match info listed on the electronic train station boards.\n\n* Even if we took an extra min or two to verify the train/bus to take, and we missed a train that was right in front of us, the trains were frequent enough such that it wasn\u2019t a long delay \u2013 usually 5-8 mins at most. Having very little reservations in our itinerary helped in this aspect.\n\n* The GoogleMaps LIVE view on directions was a useful feature in finding bus stops, especially in Kyoto and Shibuya/Shinjuku.\n\n* *Phone Plan*: We decided against one Ubigi and one Airalo data plan and just got two Ubigi data plans. Overall, we used only 4-5 GBs each out of the 10 GBs available. Ubigi worked well throughout the 10 days. As noted earlier, having a JP phone # would have been helpful.\n\n* *Flights*: standard flight experience with Delta - around $750 USD roundtrip for each of us. The lack of space didn\u2019t bother us too much except when fumbling around with the meal trays. We requested special accommodations for Halal food on the HND inbound flight, and they provided vegan food which we didn\u2019t enjoy that much (i.e. PICKLE SANDWICH!). \n\n* On the return flight to LAX, we did not put in any special accommodations and had a better time with their regular vegetarian food (although the pasta salad was very creamy and the Hagan Dazs they gave were slightly melted).\n\n* *Language:* We were able to get away with just using from *sumimasen* and *arigato* for the most part, and used English/non-verbal language most of the trip otherwise. \n\n*more review/input on food commented in original plan [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/133g0w6/11_days_first_time_in_japan_trip_halal_itinerary/jlnogxr/?context=3)\n\n\n---------\n\n\n*Full detailed routing that we ended up doing:*\n\n\n**First part of the trip -  East side of Tokyo: Asakusa**\n\n*FRI 5/5 Arrival* HND arrival was around 2pm, and we got to the hotel around 6:30pm. From there: We were able to start off our trip with Ramen for dinner @ Ayam-ya Halal Ramen Tokyo \u2013&gt; Senjo-jii and Nakamise Street at night (which was not crowded at all at night)\n\n* *Airport sidenotes: If you do the JapanWeb form online, make sure to complete it all the way until you get the QR code, which I missed. Also, we didn\u2019t realize there\u2019s two sets of lines / forms: the first for customs entry and second for customs declarations.*\n\n* *SAT May 6:* Edo Castle Ruins \u2013&gt; Tokyo Station (Ghibli, JUMP, Pokemon stores which were all super packed with long lines)  \u2013&gt; (walked to Ginza and attempted  late lunch at Ginza Tendon Itsuki, but line was too long and we went to MOS burger instead) \u2192 Tokyo Skytree Mall (first Takoyaki for my wife here!

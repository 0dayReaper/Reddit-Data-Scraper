    "postText": "Hi, we as a group of 6 are planning on travelling to japan post highschool graduation towards the end of this year. We have budgets of around $5-6k (AUD) each for \\~16 days (ofc not aiming to burn through it all, some money is expected to be left over, also we only have 12 days planned out right now, unsure where to add more days). We have two 18 year olds and four 17 year olds, so we intend to keep that in mind for the sort of stuff we can and can't do (we are also already aware we probably need to get a travel guardian permission thingo filled out for the u18s). Advice as to whether there are issues or if other alternatives would be better would be helpful! As only two of us have a basic understanding of Japanese and we are travelling with minors we have decided to stick mostly to larger cities and more tourist friendly areas, and we also want to book accomodation in advance. I was also wondering about withdrawing money while there, I heard most things are cash based and that 7/11s have atms which allow international withdrawal, is that right? Also are there any particular spots which are usually very crowded, and what would be the best time of day to avoid all that? Also recommendations for any good places for shopping and the like at Tokyo or Osaka?\n\n**DAY 1**\n\n* Plan is to fly out from syd to Osaka, get necessities from the airport (ie. cash, suica for trains, sim card), then take the train to our accomodation (we will likely be choosing between ryokans, hotels, and airbnbs for most of the trip)\n* Dinner at accomodation - any recommendations for which areas are good to book accomodation?\n\n**DAY 2**\n\n* Osaka aquarium, explore city\n* Dinner at Shinsekai, Tennoji Park (?)\n\n**DAY 3**\n\n* Day trip to Himeji, take train, see castle and koko-en garden\n\n**DAY 4**\n\n* Day trip to nara, take train\n* Todai-ji, Nara deer park, Mt.

            "comment": "Just did a month around Honshu. Some tips:\n\n&gt; Todai-ji, Nara deer park, Mt. Kasuga forest - Kasuga taisha\n\nAlso do the Nakatanidou mochi shop and check out their fun demonstrations, it's right on the walk from the station to the deer park and todai-ji. Todai-ji is absolutely amazing btw, i'd say budget 1.5-2 hours for it, you'd want to just sit on the stairs and stare at it.\n\n&gt;Dotonbori for dinner\n\nTry the melonbun on the street for dessert.\n\n\n&gt;Chill day around hakone (hotsprings, ropeway, owakudani, lake ashinoko, hakone shrine)\n\nInsider tip: Go to Taikanzan Observatory and you will catch an incredible view ;)\n\nHakone also has a very nice torii gate on the lake, but there's a line to get pictures with it (the japanese *love* to queue up)\n\n&gt; Kyoto\n\n&gt;Recommendations for other things to do in kyoto?\n\n\nHas the classic 4 - kiyomizu, arashiyama bamboo forest and boating near it, kinkaku-ji golden temple and of course the fushimi inari shinto shrine. Also recommend [Nanzenji Temple and the aqueduct](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3905.html).\n\n\nSushitetsu is a must go, despite the wait, insist on sitting close to the chefs on the counter. Put your name down and go walk around to get sake. Ichiran ramen is also a fun experience, the whole vending machine thing, also recommend the  shakshuka at Gojo Paradiso in case you feel like getting food outside of japanese cuisine.\n\nMatsui sake brewery tour \ud83c\udf76 Call them and ask for George who\u2019s the only English speaker. Or fill out form a few days before.\n\n&gt; is there anything to do at shibuya aside from looking at the crossing?\n\nThere's a large park called Yoyogi Park and the Ebisu beer museum also looked interesting though I didn't go. There's also a maid cafe where they'll keep telling you to say Taidama (I\u2019ve come home) if that's your thing.",

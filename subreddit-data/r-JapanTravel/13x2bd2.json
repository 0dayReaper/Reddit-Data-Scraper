    "postText": "I am traveling to Japan in a couple of weeks. I take an injectable medication weekly that needs to be refrigerated. I am planning to stay in Koyasan for a night and then hike the Kumano Kodo for about 6 days. I can delay the medication so I don\u2019t necessarily have to carry it on that part of the trip, but I\u2019m not sure where to store it during this period. Any ideas? Do you think a hotel in Osaka would be willing to store a refrigerated item, similarly to a luggage storage? Anyone have experience with this?",

Not sure how long the frozen block does the job but I know someone who used it on a longish flight.  The accommodations fridge would need a freezer compartment to use each night or perhaps another option.",

I have used an insulated lunch bag with a gel pack in the past for flights, but was worried about consistently being able to freeze the gel pack every night for the next day while hiking - especially at places like the temple in Koyasan. I just did some research on insulin storage and was able to find a portable cooler that can use either a gel pack or be plugged into a power source. I think with a combination of a portable battery pack and the gel pack I should be able to make it work! \n\nHere\u2019s what I found if you\u2019re curious: https://4allfamily.com/collections/best-selling-products/products/portable-medical-fridge-usb-insulin-medicines",

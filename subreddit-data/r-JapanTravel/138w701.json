            "comment": "I'd recommend doing a bit more research with regards to Kyoto. Your Day 10 takes you from one corner of the city to another. Which is doable but is it fun? I did Kinkaku-ji and Arashiyama because they're relatively close. But I wouldn't have added anything else to that day.\n\nLook at the different districts and try to pick temples / shrines that are close to one another. For example, Tofuku-ji is well worth a visit, especially if the fall colors are popping off and it's close to Fushimi Inari. Check out Dragon Burger if you hit Tofuku-ji.\n\nhttps://www.discoverkyoto.com/places-go/tofuku-ji/ \n\nWhat I found in Kyoto is your experience gets so much more enjoyable if you can escape the tour bus hordes. Try to do some off the beaten path stuff if possible. Look into renting a bike, that's the best way to get around. \n\nI would not specifically target a JR station as an attraction. You'll pass through them enough. The stairs at Osaka station are pretty cheesy. \n\nLooks like you have 5 days in Osaka, which from my experience is a lot. Osaka's main draw in my opinion are the street scenes / cuisine which are best at night. So I would rather day trip to Nara from Osaka rather than Kyoto (similar distance), because imo Kyoto has quite a bit more to offer than Osaka. Like you can hit Nara and easily do Shinsaibashi in the afternoon / evening of the same day.\n\nIf your interested in castles, take a day trip to Himeji from Osaka. Osaka Castle has very valuable history / significance. But it's a restoration. Himeji is one of the few surviving castles and its very impressive in person.  \n\nI don't think your days are packed at all. Which is a good thing. Best travel experiences for me are frequently accidents or spur of the moment. \n\nWhen in Ginza hit Shimbashi for a walk around. Fun vibe. Lots of interesting restaurants. Also check out Yurakucho station. Great restaurant there: [http://www.andysfish.com/Shin-Hinomoto](http://www.andysfish.com/Shin-Hinomoto) but you need to book ahead. Ginza was my Tokyo base and I wandered from Shimbashi to Yurakucho and back several evenings. So much going on.",

Don't worry about having time or the knowledge to explore Japan and it's different intricacies, the better way to think about it is having the mindset to take your time enjoying it and not rushing the experience. I hope you have a great time in Japan, remember that some days you'll be absolutely tired from the adventures, make sure to set aside time for breaks.",

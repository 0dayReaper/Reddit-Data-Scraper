    "postText": "No coin lockers in all of Fukuoka station. From the Google translated flier: \n[Notice of suspension of coin lockers] This coin locker cannot be used from May 15th to May 21st, 2023 due to vigilance and security associated with the G7 Summit. From May 15, 2023, it will be closed sequentially. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we ask for your understanding and cooperation. Thank you very much. [Notice of Coin-Locker Service Suspension] Due to increased security activity in line with the the G7 summit in Japan, these coin lockers will temporarily not be in service from May 15 to May 21, 2023.\n\nThe G7 summit isn\u2019t even in this city so this could be nationwide? Unsure. \n\nPro-tip: I saw coinlockers at the canal city mall not too far away from the station. I haven\u2019t checked to see if they are still available, but it\u2019s walkable. \n\nGodspeed!",

So you could just ask the staff at your location if they could help you to find a location where you can store your luggage.",

    "postText": "Because I learned so much from reading other itinerary/trip reports here, I wanted to share our experience.\n\n  \nBeforehand:  \nAT&amp;T \u2013 signed up for international day pass which meant $10/day for first person on the plan and $5/day for the others, for the first 10 days of each month or maybe billing cycle. Worked well and allowed us to split up when needed.  \nBought Tokyo Metro Pass (about $11/day, well worth it for us for 3 days) and JR pass on line from Klook prior to trip in time for them to mail the JR pass voucher to my home.  \nWe also bought a limousine airport bus ticket ahead of time from Klook but see below.  \nPicked up Tokyo Metro Pass by showing QR code to the machine at metro station (instant and easy) and went to Shinjuku JR station to pick up JR passes (show passports, ok to pick up passes days before you want them activated) in person and make seat reservations for the long shinkansen trips and for the Tobu Nikko trip (paid the extra fee to Tobu staff when we arrived in Nikko). It was helpful to have determined exactly which train we wanted seat reservations for (train number, time, and date) beforehand. Ask for Mt. Fuji side if going Tokyo to Osaka/Kyoto. JapanTravel app is great for checking train times. Do give yourself enough time to transfer \u2013 the app will give you 10 minutes, say, to transfer from metro to JR trains and given the size of the stations and having to swipe in and out of the stations, and being confused about where to go, you probably need more time.  \nIf you have an iPhone, add virtual Suica card to your wallet. Was incredibly easy to use and saved us from having to top up at kiosks or buy tickets. Used it to grab drinks from machines, at 7-11, etc. But, it was a little tricky to set up for some of us \u2013 you may have to try Amex or Mastercard if Visa doesn\u2019t work. Once, it didn\u2019t work the first day but worked the second day when we tried again, so definitely do this at least a few days prior to the trip.  \nGet some cash and plan to stop at ATMs (we used 7-11) often because cash is king there.  \nWe did not make any reservations so that we could be flexible with our plans. All the food was excellent and we rarely waited long (we would just look for another place if a line was long).  \nOf course, do the visit Japan web website at least 3 days prior to the trip and get your QR codes for customs and immigration. Screenshot these as well.  \nIf you can keep yourself to a carry on size bag, it will make finding lockers and taking the shinkansen much easier.  \nBreak in those shoes. We walked 11-12 miles every day.\n\n  \nTokyo for &lt;= 3 days. We stayed in Shinjuku and tried to cluster our activities when we could:  \nNortheast:  \nKappabashi street to check out the beautiful knives and kitchenware, and buy some lovely chopsticks  \nAsakusa Shrine: beautiful but we did not go in because we were there for the Sanja Matsuri festival; crowded but a lot of fun watching the golden shrines bounced up and down the street, and we still got to sample foods from the food stalls. Thought about returning for evening, but never made it there.  \nAkihabara: this was on my if-we-have-extra-time list; so glad we made it because it was a real highlight. Playing retro arcade games (Super Potato Retro shop), watching the real pros compete in the huge multistory gaming center buildings; walked over the Owl Caf\u00e9 but should have made reservations a week before if we had wanted to go.  \nWent to a bonsai market garden center in Ueno which was kind of interesting.  \nOchanomizu Gakkitengai for guitars and other musical instruments.  \nDidn\u2019t do SkyTree, did go to Ameyoko market which I thought was just ok.  \nEast:  \nFukagawa Fudo-do Temple: Goma Ritual, drumming, prayers, fire; service lasts about 30 minutes. Take a look around the temple\u2019s other rooms also. Multiple times daily.  \nHat Coffee: we did not go but I\u2019d have loved to see the 3D lattes  \nSoutheast:  \nTsukiji outer market (we had a Klook voucher for limousine bus tickets to take us right to the hotel to drop off our bags, but we got through immigration quickly and waited around until 6 am when the ticket counter was supposed to open, but it didn\u2019t open and the info desk told us it wouldn\u2019t open for another hour, plus first bus wasn\u2019t until 7:30 am\u2013 so rather than waiting around the airport for hours, we ended up going straight to the market on the monorail and the metro using our Suica card, getting there at 6:20 am). It might sound early, but we had such a wonderful visit to the market at 6:20 am, dropping our bags in a locker at the metro (some take coins but we found ones that took our Suica (virtual Suica was in our Apple wallet); there are also lockers at Plat Tsukiji). Enjoyed the market and excellent coffee at Yonemoto, then lined up at 8:30 for wonderful meal at Tsukiji Koromo Sushi. Fantastic experience being able to look closely at everything at the market and make our purchases. By the time we left breakfast, though, it was wall to wall people, long lines, too crowded to really check out the stalls, and a much different experience. We were glad we had gone early. We even came back (at 7 am) two days later to enjoy more food stalls and sample the fatty tuna at Maguroya Kurogin (worth it despite the line).   \nWest:  \nShibuya 109: go downstairs to food area and find the whipped cream vending machine next to the escalator. Bring cash!  \nShibuya Sky: we did not have tickets and they were sold out, but during the day we went to the floor below and walked through the art gallery to have a beautiful view of the scramble crossing. At night, we went one floor below that to a lounge to take in the free view.  \nEverywhere: Don Quijote; bought all the candy. Very fun running around trying to determine what was in each package. Thankful for Google Translate.  \nWalked through beautiful Yoyogi Park to the Meiji-jingu Shrine. Saw some of a wedding ceremony. Beautiful.  \nThen walked through Harajuku which was crowded and lively. Didn\u2019t really see eccentric clothes and fashion, but lots of restaurants and snacks and fun resale shops.  \nDid not get to Shibuya Nonbei Yokocho.  \nDid stop in at Omoide Yokocho in Shinjuku and enjoy an early drink; would recommend getting there early since was already packed. Also lots of smoking in the izakayas, which made it less enjoyable for us.  \nEnjoyed a walk through Golden Gai also. There are many areas of Shinjuku other than these for nightlife and restaurants. If there is a long line, go elsewhere. So much excellent food. If you like electronics, check out the 11 buildings of Yodabashi camera.  \nAlso ate at Uobei Shibuya for fast fun conveyer belt sushi. Line moved quickly. Great value too.\n\n  \nThen we took the Tobu Nikko line to Nikko (direct from Shinjuku so saved time and transfers with our bags). Cost a little more since JR pass didn\u2019t cover fully. You could just take JR but there were more connections.  \nChecked into Ryokan Nikko Hoshinoyado. Enjoyed Kanmangafuchi Abyss and the Toshugu shrines (buy tickets at the train station to avoid the lines at the shrine). Highly recommend this ryokan. Great public onsen (not busy, mostly empty, indoor and outdoor options) and phenomenal dinner. Surprised by wonderful breakfast also.  \nAfter one night, metro and shinkansen to Kyoto (nice view of Mt. Fuji; enjoyed an ekiben on the train that we got at Tokyo station).\n\n  \nIn Kyoto, walked Gion/Shimbashi street and had dinner at Pontocho first night. Many maiko sightings from across from the Ichiriki Tea House as dusk fell.  \nSecond day got 7 am start to be at Arashiyama bamboo grove early (peaceful) and then over to Golden Pavilion by 9 when it opened. Still very crowded, but fun and beautiful. We took cabs to the bamboo grove (30 minutes instead of 60) and then over to the Golden Pavilion because buses required connections and much longer travel time when we were trying to beat the crowds. After those two cabs, we just took buses around. Went to monkey park which was great and the had obanzai lunch at Gyatei (upstairs on the left, excellent) followed by walk to Gio-Ji temple (moss garden) and then through the Okochi Sanso Villa; then walked around the Arashiyama shopping streets. If you do the bamboo grove very early, be aware that all of the temples on that beautiful historic street nearby are closed that early. Nishiki market then dinner in Pontocho.  \nThird day, started at Kiyomizu-Dera (check out Tainai-meguri, a symbolic womb of a female bodhisattva \u2013 we were pressed for time and the next schedule wasn\u2019t for 30 minutes so we couldn\u2019t stay), walked down Ninen-zaka and sannen-Zaka streets and then bus over to lunch at Izusen for shojin-ryori (you could get reservations, but we just got there early and were lucky to get in) and a walk around Daitokuji temple complex. There is a wonderful new zen bonsai garden in the Hoshun-in sub temple. Staff at other sub temples told us that that garden wasn\u2019t open but when we got there it was. Check Instagram for opening times. After another visit to Nishiki market, we walked the Fushimi Inari Shrine into the evening and then back to Pontocho for dinner.\n\n  \nTrain to Osaka.  \nWent straight to Okonomiyaki Chitose which was excellent and a bit away from the main food areas; tried to get there for 11 am but went the wrong direction on the shinkansen rushing to the unreserved cars ((at the front of the shinkansens, by the way, usually cars 1-3 or similar). Also be aware of what platform to be at, but also that you are getting on the correct train. We almost took a 10:01 train when we should have waited for the 10:03 train at the same platform. Similarly, you might find that the JapanTransit app asks you to get off on platform 16 and then get on a train at that same moment at platform 16. Do it \u2014 it is asking you to go from an express to a local train). Because we didn\u2019t arrive until 11:45, we were in an hour long line to get in. It was excellent though.  \nSpent the rest of the day at Don Quijote and all of the many endless food and shopping streets near Namba and ended at Dotonbori. Conveyer belt sushi close to the river but upstairs so harder to find \u2013 surprisingly not crowded when the other places on the river were all mobbed.\n\n  \nNext day train to Nara, a few hours there exploring the Daibutsuden Hall and Todaiji temple and feeding the bowing deer, fantastic lunch at izakaya  \n\u306a\u3089\u9152\u8535\u306a\u3079 At 34-1 Imamikadocho, Nara, and then to Kyoto for the shinkansen to Tokyo for the airport.",

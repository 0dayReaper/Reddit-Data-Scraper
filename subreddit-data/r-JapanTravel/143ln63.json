Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove/Tenryuji/Togetsukyo bridge, and Nijo castle are in three distinct parts of the city, so you're going to burn up a good chunk of that 1 day just going from place to place, all before taking *another* lengthy bullet train back to Tokyo. For a trip this short, just enjoy Tokyo, and if you feel like getting out of Tokyo, pick one of the many nearby day-trip destinations. Also, are you coming from the US or Europe? If so realize that you are going to have serious jet lag, your July 22nd day is very unrealistic, even if it wasn't your first day in Japan I'd call it *ambitious*, but for jet lag day it's just outright not feasible.",

The only thing we booked on the 22nd is the TeamsLabs at night. The rest of the items, i believe we can shuffle around for the last day too.\n\nThe Kyoto trip, we can definitely cut short. Really just want to go to the shrine and then explore a little more.  Thank you!",

Tokyo Station (I recommend adding this) &gt; Ginza &gt; Tsukiji &gt; Teamlabs &gt; Gundam makes the most sense imo (they\u2019re all kinda clustered in the same area). I also recommend adding in Odaiba Seaside Park after the Gundam. \n\nAlso Shibuya should ideally be grouped with Harajuku, they are 1 stop away from each other. \n\nMaybe Omoide Yokocho can go with the Tokyo Tower day, of course it\u2019s closer to Harajuku but that day might be too busy. \n\nI don\u2019t think Kyoto 1 night is a good idea but if you must go, I recommend Fushimi Inari and Maruyama &gt; Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka &gt; Kiyomizudera path. They\u2019re the essentials. Adding in Pontocho for dinner is fun too. Ginkakuji and Philosophers Path if you have more time.",

If you had 2 weeks, then I\u2019d suggest at least staying 2 nights in Kyoto.",

We did some day trips to Nara, Miyajima, Arashiyama, and even decided to visit Okunoshima aka rabbit island. I\u2019ve probably forgotten a few but that\u2019s generally how we spent our time.",

A lot of cool temples to see and a big change from Tokyo with a coastal surf town vibe.

If you wanted to get out of Tokyo for a day, maybe go to Hakone or another hot spring town. \n\nAlso recommendation if you're going to Gundam Base Tokyo, there's an arcade nearby called [Daiba Game Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/vV8g1uc5VThpJJs46), lotta retro arcade games.",

There will be times when you see something that you want to spend more time on but your other plans may prevent you from staying longer. Definitely would advise against the day at Kyoto, you will not run out of things to do in Tokyo with the short time you have scheduled. Also, if traveling with a larger group account for lost time deciding where to eat, go etc.",

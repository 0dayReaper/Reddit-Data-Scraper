    "postText": "So I\u2019m coming to the end of my 3 month stint in japan. I\u2019ve got 3 full days left in Tokyo (and 1 overnight near Fuji). Sadly the weather looks like it\u2019s taken a turn for the worse but hey ho.\n\nFor the long time travellers/residents, what\u2019s one thing you wish you\u2019d done in Tokyo? I\u2019ve done many shrines/temples across japan. Eaten lots of foods. Been to museums and galleries. Got Studio Ghibli on Monday morning and I\u2019ve done both Teamlab exhibitions. Eaten tonnes of ramen and sushi. But I don\u2019t want my plane to land at the other end and then think \u201coh no! I wish I\u2019d done xyz\u201d.\n\nSolo activities please - I\u2019m alone :(. Also preferably cheap. Sadly Michelin meals are not on the menu! Also I\u2019d be grateful if we could stick to Tokyo rather than daytrips from Tokyo.",

Check his twitter to make sure they\u2019re open, then go before they\u2019re open to put your name on a reservation list (kind of same system as Gram in Harajuku), then come back for your alotted time slot.

Idk if my experience is different because I just really love singing, but solo karaoke doesn't have to be lonely! I have a blast, even by myself. I like that I can sing as much as I want and don't have to wait my turn for the next song. And you don't have to worry about keeping the mood.\n\nThere is a place, though it's pretty expensive for karaoke, called 1kara where you can sing with a professional-looking setup with headphones and everything. It's fun. I've only been able to do one hour, though. https://1kara.jp/en/",

When you are batting, you can select the speed of the ball, so it wasn't too difficult. You can also pitch at a board, divided into 9 sections. The distance is nowhere near what it would be in an official match, and the target board is huge, so it was more for fun than actual practice.",

Really nice if you love books. The area in general I could spend a lot of time in, too. It\u2019s just so nice. \n\nHave you cycled there? If not, it\u2019s really quite safe (but I don\u2019t mind a bit of danger anyway - I\u2019m often on a Boris bike). You can rent a Tokyobike up in Yanaka. Cheap, and well worth it. Loved mine. Oh, and Yanaka is a seriously cool place to be, too. \n\nSee if there\u2019s any festivals or similar on. I found a few just by looking at Google Maps and them showing up. \n\nIf you\u2019ve not been to Yokohama, do! Also, have you had an egg coffee yet? Weird. \n\nHave you been to an owl cafe? You need to do your research about how kind they are to the owls, but I can recommend a place. \n\nBeen to kabuki? \n\nI personally enjoyed the brief visit I had to the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum. Again, the area around there is nice, too. \n\nSumo I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve done...\n\nI\u2019m not normally one for zoos, but I liked the zoo there. \n\nThat\u2019s about it for now.

I cycle in London but Tokyo seems nuts - they cycle on the pavements, the wrong way down roads. It\u2019s just not proper! :P but good to know it\u2019s safe - I was curious to try it out. The weather\u2019s nice tomorrow so I\u2019ll give it a go.\n\nI actually haven\u2019t done sumo. The matches weren\u2019t on while I was in Tokyo and seem crazy expensive. You can watch them training through the window at the dojo can\u2019t you? Have you done that?",

You can find a number of \"tutorial\" videos on Youtube that literally walk through the entire process of paying, changing, washing, and soaking to make it a bit less worrying.

A few people were able to pet the shibas and we just tried to enjoy the moment thru them. Not sure if this is typical, of the shibas were just tired, or if it\u2019s a breed specific trait.

I wandered into a free museums that are worth seeing (the waterworks museum, the firefighter museum, and the parasite museum in Meguro) and I loved just walking around and seeing the neighborhoods. The Ghibli museum is worth it if you can get in (you have to buy tickets a couple weeks in advance) and I enjoyed just walking around some of the neighborhoods.\n\nMostly I wish I made it out into the countryside more, but that's probably because I go every year to visit friends and family and I never make it out to the edges of Tokyo. I do make it out to the middle of nowhere, though, since that's where the family tend to be.",

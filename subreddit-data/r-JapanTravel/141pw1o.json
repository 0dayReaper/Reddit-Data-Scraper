    "postText": "Hello everyone.\n\nMy wife (48F) and I (43M) are doing a five-week trip to Japan from October 14 to November 17. The first ten days of that trip are being spent in Tokyo. I would love to share our itinerary, and get your thoughts. Yes, we are doing three days at Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea. My wife and I are big fans of Disney parks, and so we are prioritizing our time there. I'm mainly looking to see if there are any glaring omissions or must do's that we are missing. Thank you so much in advance. This sub has been extremely helpful in the planning of this epic adventure\n\nOct 14\n-Land at Narita in the evening\n-Take shuttle to hotel in Shinjuku.\n-Find dinner, possibly at Ichiran Ramen.\n-Try to sleep.\n\nOct 15\n-Travel to Shibuya. \n-Take a food tour / into to Tokyo tour that takes us to many food stops and interesting areas of Shibuya.\n-Go to Jingu Bashi (shrine bridge)\n-Yoyogi Park.\n-Meiji Shrine\n- Back to Shibuya for Shibuya 109\n- Maybe Mega Don Quijote\n- Shibuya Sky at Sunset\n- Dinner either in Shibuya or back in Shinjuku\n\nOct 16th\n- Start day at Takeshita Street. \n- Explore Harijuku.\n- Wakabayashi coffee shop.

            "comment": "In my opinion Ichiran is overated. It's not bad, but not good to the point I would say it's a must. About every other ramen place will be as good.\n\nNot sure why start by Shibuya. You want a morning food tour ? If not, then start by Harajuku, Meiji-jingu open early, then if you want to see some shops, they will open at 10-11am, then you can go to Shibuya for ta lunch food tour and continue tour visit around there....\n\n Actually, seeing you have a Harajuku day, I do not understand why you want to go to Meiji-jingu on the Shibuya day.\n\nIf you like retro anime stuff like Mandarake, then check to stop by  Nakano Broadway on the Ghibli museum day. It was not especially the kind of stuff I am looking for and preferred Akihabara in General, but places like Radio Kaikan and Akiba Culture Zone.\n\nAlso, Akihabara is not especially a morning place, shops open at 10-11 (some even at 12) so if you are earlier than that, there is not much point.\n\nIf you fly out of Tokyo, you might want to consider moving a couple of days in Tokyo at the end of the trip so you can focus on shopping when you are back in Tokyo and not have to carry what you purchased all around Japan.",

Maybe we can scratch doing Shibuya the first day, and instead start with Meiji and Yoyogi, and then head over and to the majority of Harijuku. Then end the night with Shibuya sky, and a few other sites. It might be more fun to experience Harijuku on Sunday with the crowd and everything. Then on Monday (second day) we hit Shibuya and so whatever we didn't see in the morning, and do Shinjuku in the evening. Thank you do the advice!",

You might want to take a good look at the procedure before travelling to see if there are still tickets left from their monthly sale",

Fortunately we were able to get one using a desktop PC. (At 4 am, after more hours of nail-biting) \n\nAlso, Make sure you print out your QR code and purchase history promptly.\n\n\n I found that when I went back into my account about a month after purchase I was unable to get it to display a third time. (Fortunately I had pdfs saved of everything and had not lost that original printout..)\n\nThe hilarious thing is after all that stress,  the actual  qr code was never scanned at Ghibli warehouse. Instead,  Humans just looked at It and confirmed that my name on my order history sheet  matched my passport.",

We live in California, and have been to the Florida parks a few times, so we certainly have seen a standard Disneyland a lot of times. This is why we are prioritizing our time in in Disneyseas, which seems like the more unique park for us. Thanks!",

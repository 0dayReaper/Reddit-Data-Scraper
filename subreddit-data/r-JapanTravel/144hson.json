            "comment": "Good question!! Chances to see Mt Fuji is as low as 6.5% in July.  It's definitely skippable if your intention is to gaze at the mountain. It is low due to high humidity and rain which impact visibility.\n\nI think your itinerary is fairly paced between the sights you want to see",

As of now, it shows 4.3KM visibility which means not visible at all!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Agv5WZA](https://imgur.com/a/Agv5WZA). You can toggle / fast forward to see how visible it is in few days (I think max 5 days for free version)\n\nOverall Windy is an absolute must have for weather buff out there!",

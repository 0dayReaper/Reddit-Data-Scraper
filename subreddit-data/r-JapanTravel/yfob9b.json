    "postText": "Returned today from two weeks in Tokyo, Karuizawa and Kyoto. Note: I still love Japan after my third visit. It was not depressing and there's plenty of life but...\n\n**Observations:**\n\nMasks are pretty much everyone, everywhere, all the time, indoor and out.(This may or may not not prove a big irritation to you.) \n\nLikewise sanitiser, temperature checks and requests to not engage in conversation. (Yep - on signs and over PA announcements.)\n\nTip: Buy some local lightweight masks at a Lawsons or pharmacy with non-elastic straps for the sake of your ears. They come in packs of 30 and it'll be the best purchase you make all trip.\n\nTourist numbers are still very, very low compared to usual. We were regularly alone or nearly alone in cocktail bars etc which was a tad dull but of course often we enjoyed the lack of crowds.\n\nThat said - the streets and subways of Tokyo will always be full of life and people. The population is 125 million or so!\n\nFlights from Australia there and back were 40% and 60% full. Shinkasen and Narita Express were not busy at all (still have to reserve a seat though for NEX though regardless. No reservation - no access - no flight.)\n\nAs a result of zero tourists for two years the Narita Express and Limousine Bus are at much reduced service levels. Narita Express was one-per-hour yesterday afternoon (instead of three per hour) and I'm sure that will catch some folk out. Don't expect them to respond to queries or have a good website.\n\nNarita Airport was 75% closed in terms of shops and restaurants and some opened at 4pm to coincide with flights.\n\nIn general many restaurants, bars etc are out of business, closing early, opening late, reducing hours etc due to lack of staff and / or clients. Double check before you go anywhere. They are only just getting back into gear for international or local tourism.\n\nOther things - hotel bars, laundries, lounges - may be closed or reduced as part of Covid precautions. They are REALLY Covid-wary which often slows and stresses service in cafes etc.\n\nTwo of our hotels insisted on plastic gloves at the breakfast buffet which did not create a great morning vibe. They also gave us a little special envelope in which to rest our masks as we ate. Eco madness.\n\nStaff have been laid off and businesses are rehiring and as a result frontline staff were often less experienced than on our previous visits. The chap at the JR stand at Narita Airport had never been asked to issue a JR Pass before! It took a LONG time and a lot of help from his supervisor. I hope they speed up before the hoards descend.\n\nConsider not getting your JR Pass upon arrival at Narita, though of course the Narita Express is included in your pass.\n\nOh - download and complete the MySOS app but keep in mind that the blue screen isn't enough to speed up your immigration process. You'll also need to use the airport wifi or a mobile service to allow them to do something with your app. This wasn't well explained when we arrived on the third day of the re-opening. It might be better now.\n\nEnjoy Japan - we did but it was different.",

I didn\u2019t have the same experience with closed businesses or reduced hours that OP did\u2014pretty much anything I wanted to do or eat at any given time was open. All the shopping and sights are open. Restaurants and bars were busy. The lack of tourists was actually pretty nice. My hotel was pretty bare bones, but the facilities and laundry were open as usual.\n\nIt was maybe a little weird here and there, but not depressing or a trip-ruining experience. Honestly everything felt pretty normal.",

Some stuff runs at reduced capacity or with timed tickets, but I kind of like that. Bars are lively in my area on the evenings, shopping centers and attractions are bustling on the weekends, a bunch of new restaurants opened up this past year, local events are still happening, etc.",

And I say that as it\u2019s my 17th time here, first after pandemic.\n\nI loved not having international tourists around the first few weeks because places like Sensoji and Nikko felt like they were just mine to enjoy, and people weren\u2019t walking super slow down cramped alleys while live-streaming it, or stopping every 15 seconds. I could get access to limited events last minute because they weren\u2019t reserved by others months in advance. I could hang out in the izakaya until midnight (or later). I\u2019ve been able to go to any restaurant I wanted no problem (famous soba shops, udon shops, Michelin starred places, etc.).\n\nPlaces that were seas of people before the pandemic were still seas of people now - Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Ameyoko, Akihabara. Everywhere I went was open. I\u2019ve ridden the trains during rush hour pretty much every day and it\u2019s still a sardine can.\n\nThe only real changes are masking, hand sanitizer, temperature checks, and the little plastic dividers being used everywhere.\n\nLife is actually more convenient now in some ways because digital and electronic payments are more common. I\u2019ve paid for tons of stuff with Suica, the oddest so far being contact lenses.\n\nOh, and there are bag fees now.\n\nMy snobby opinion is I like it better now.",

They make an excellent tsukune, among other things. Very cozy locals place, you\u2019ll be rubbing shoulders with post-work salarymen drinking and chatting.\n\nI also like Isomaru Suisan - they\u2019re a chain but they do robata and they\u2019re open very long hours, the one I go to is in Ameyoko and is 24 hours. If you love drinking while cooking your own seafood, I\u2019d recommend. It\u2019s extra fun with friends. You order via a tablet/a webpage on your phone.\n\nAnother of my favorite izakaya is  Zuku Bako (\u305a\u304f\u7bb1) in the Akiba/Kanda zone. They have the largest selection of umeshu I\u2019ve seen, lots of good stuff. They also serve soba, though I\u2019ve only ever drank there because I\u2019ve only ever gone with friends who wanted to go late enough their kitchen was closed. Completely in Japanese, including staff. Oh, also, the owner is an exotic bird enthusiast so you uh\u2026eat/drink while a bunch of peregrine falcons and owls are sitting in a terrarium-type room staring at you. The owner rotates birds in/out so I\u2019ve seen different birds every time I\u2019ve been.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll always add my hands-down favorite: Nemuri-an in Kanda. Reservations strongly recommended (phone only) because it\u2019s a one-man shop and he serves 6-8 people a night tops. He makes excellent soba and bar food, and has good shochu and sake. Hyper Japanese (you should be able to read kanji). Guy doesn\u2019t speak English.",

As usual the Japanese are incredibly accommodating and learning a handful of phrases and having a little patience will earn you a very wide smile and gratitude. \n\nDon\u2019t be put off by some of these reports, the o ly thing that might suck for you in March is that more tourists will be back and things will be more crowded. As it is things are much less busy than I anticipated and workers in general seem happy to have tourists, and their business, back",

Still some of the western tourists we see do not wear masks outdoors, and some Japanese too, and that seems fine too. On the subject of tourists, we\u2019ve come across lots of Japanese tourists in both Kamakura and Kyoto (school trips?) . Asakusa was crowded too at the weekend. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what it was like pre-covid (this is our first time in Japan)! \n\nI agree re mySoS app, it took us ages to get through and you need an internet connection for it to work. I recommend printing out the page with the page with the QR code and have it handy.\n\nOther than the wearing of masks and the ubiquitous hand sanitisers, everything feels very normal and lively. I feel a lot safer and I enjoy eating out/visiting shops in Japan than if I were in the UK. It does help that the weather has been glorious :)",

There are temperature checks when walking into stores or restaurants, but it\u2019s pretty simple, with you standing in front of a tablet to have your temperature checked or getting a reading from the palm of your hand. Takes like 2 seconds and it\u2019s not mandatory in most places I\u2019ve been to. Mask wearing is common and expected, but doesn\u2019t seem to be enforced.

I\u2019ve been on about 4-5 shinakansens, the recent ones almost all full. There were only a handful of individual seats free on the Tokyo - Osaka I took today for example . Lunch and dinner time restaurants are packed with lines in at least Tokyo and Hiroshima and popular tourist places. And there are foreign tourists everywhere now, my completely anecdotal perception is that it feels like pre-Covid. Hospitality business owners I\u2019ve spoken to are stating it\u2019s been their busy week in 3 years - tsukiji was jam packed on Sunday. The tea ceremonies at hamarikyu park on Saturday had a line of about 70 people waiting to see if people cancelled and they could get in instead.",

Especially bars and restaurants\u2014everything we've been to was full at peak times, with popular places having lines.

Most standalone stores closed, no one at security or immigration, and the open stores practically empty. The omiyage store that used to have lines out the door at all times even a decade ago had just me and one other group in it. The cosmetics store was empty, and the staff practically pounced on me. I\u2019ve been through NRT many many times, and this felt very weird.\n\nThe JAL Sakura Lounge was pretty full, though, especially as it got further into the evening. By the time I left, most chairs were filled and the food area was packed. They used to do a self-serve buffet, but they now take your order and plate up your food for you.\n\nI will say that the Keisei Skyliner does not have a reduced schedule, though\u2014or, at least, not an obvious one. It still seems to be running roughly every 20 minutes like before. So it\u2019s another option to try instead of N\u2019EX if you\u2019re going close to the Ueno area.\n\nMy flights were similarly low on load. My flight to Japan was before the full re-opening, and I think it was maybe 35% full. My return flight earlier this week was more full, but still not 100%. Maybe 75%?",

Airlines gain and lose slots here and there, and Haneda has always been incredibly sought-after.\n\nOf the \\~32 million overseas tourists that went to Japan in 2019, 26 million of them were from Asia, so it would be more interesting to see how the other slots are currently allotted. Especially since there's still an incredibly reduced number of flights coming out of Korea, China, and Taiwan (the top three pre-pandemic sources of overseas tourists to Japan, since they made up \\~20 million people just on their own).",

I was probably the only person in our group that wore mask both outdoors and indoors. Some people never even placed one on their nose even indoors. I think only in few places (Himeji/Osaka castle?) they asked us to mask. \n\nTourist areas are packed \u2026 with Japanese. Even in the biggest tourists hotspots in Kyoto, I could barely see any foreigner. We hit a time where there were also Japanese student school trips and even then the spots didn\u2019t feel that much crowded. At Fushimi Inari there were barely any foreigners and I felt like our group were the only foreigners while we were in the Meiji shrine/Kinkakuji and Ginkakuji/Sensoji/Kyomizu-dera. \n\nOutside hotel breakfast buffets, I don\u2019t remember any place at all where I would be having a temperature check or a request to wear plastic gloves. \n\nOur Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto was pretty packed up (tho not full to the brim). \n\nIt\u2019s definitely noticeable that stores were opening later in the morning, but most stores, restaurants and fast food were decently packed (again overwhelmingly with Japanese). \n\nObservation places (like Umeda sky building, Kyoto tower, Skytree) were also decently packed, but not overloaded. \n\nAs for the MySOS app - in my case, they requested to scan the QR code from the page that opens once you click the restrictions tab in the app (lower-left). I also had to fill in a health declaration but that\u2019s pretty much it. Checking/screening was straightforward and easy",

We're going to Osaka, Koyasan, Nara and Tochigi next.\n\nMy first impression was a bit like OP's, in Tokyo masks are 95% yes even people alone in their car (I'll take pics). Lots of restaurants and smaller places have reduced hours outside of Shinjuku, Shibuya etc... We had a hard time finding a cafe open before 10am.\n\nStuff is busy however, mostly with locals though. Tokyo skytree was jammed at 8pm, Senso-ji was also chock full (on a Saturday morning) and there were definitely tourists there.\n\nOutside Tokyo though it's been more relaxed on masking. Here in Kyoto, I'd say 80% masks, more tourists and a more normal vibe. Keep in mind, more remote areas of the country haven't seen a non Japanese for almost 3 years.\n\nOne oddity for me, as  Canadian 14-17 degrees is shorts weather, we noticed the A/C off and heat on in some places, so 24-25 degrees at Tokyo skytree for example, pretty warm on the shinkansen as well. Our hotel in Toyama had turned off the central air. We got them to open our room window (on the 8th floor) so I could sleep.",

The only things open before 9am/10am tend to be bakeries in train stations, some family restaurants (like Lotteria), and fast food places (like Yoshinoya/Matsuya/etc.). Even a lot of nice coffee shops don't (and didn't really ever) open before 10am or 11am.",

First half of the trip had noticeably less tourists than the second half - the second half of the trip it basically felt the same as when I went in Jan 2020 except 99.9% of people wore masks.  I wore a surgical mask with elastic straps that I know fit me well as the straps are quite elastic for the entire day without issue.  Keep in mind I stayed near Akihabara so this is pretty much the weeb tourist spot.\n\nThere's alcohol for your hands everywhere and occasionally a restaurant will ask for temp checks, but for me that was like 2-3 restaurants out of a lot.\n\nI've never found a need to take the Narita express for some reason, I normally take one of the Keisei lines which run a bit more frequently and are significantly cheaper.  Narita express did only run once or twice per hour though.\n\nAirbnb had self check-in and I got breakfast at conbinis and such, no issue there.\n\nFlight from Toronto was pretty much 90% full going there, slightly less full coming back(had an empty seat next to me)\n\nFor me, mySOS was all approved and blue for me.  I just had to click a button to open up the QR code and scan it at the vaccination check area.  Vaccination + immigration was extremely slow though, upwards of 1-2 hours even with me having everything ready.\n\nNot really a bargoer so can't say much about the bars, but the arcades close up pretty late, 11:30-1am ish depending on the arcade so I found myself there quite a bit after the bulk of the shops closed around 9pm for the night.",

I'm going on the last week of December and this is so helpful in painting a realistic picture and helping manage expectations. \n\nOn your note about Narita Express, their website isn't very helpful as you mentioned, but I did find [this unofficial site](https://www.snowmonkeyresorts.com/access/narita-express-nex-timetable/) mentioning the schedule as of 01 October 2022 which shows about two trains per hour. Do you know if this is fairly accurate? I'm depending on this schedule in planning for my very early morning departure from NRT so now hearing that it has reduced service levels is worrying ):",

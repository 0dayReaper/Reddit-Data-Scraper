    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nMy husband and I are headed to Japan for our honeymoon in late October. We\u2019ll be there roughly 3 weeks. We are foodies, and love unique experiences! I want to see it all, but also want to be conscious of my partner - I tend to have a lot more steam and don\u2019t want to burn him out. \n\nCould you take a look at my itinerary and tell me if it looks too packed or if it\u2019s missing anything? I\u2019m also debating doing one more day in Kyoto, and one less day in Osaka.\n\nIm still plugging in some restaurants and cafes I want to visit, but I\u2019m open to suggestions!\n\nOct 28 -Tokyo - Land at Narita in the afternoon. Settle into hotel and find dinner. (sushi!!!!)\n\nOct 29 - Tokyo - First full day! Starbucks reserve, Mario Kart Tokyo Bay (?) &amp; shop for halloween costumes (any ideas where??). Shibuya Sky &amp; Coco Curry House\n\nOct 30 -Tokyo   - Disney Sea\n\nOct 31 - Tokyo - Harajuku, Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, Senso-Ji Shrine &amp; Nakamise-dori market. Halloween Celebrations in Shibuya or Rappongi?!\n\nNov 1 -Tokyo - Meiji Jingu, Akihabara, Tokyo Sky Tree\n\nNov 2 -Tokyo - Travel to Kyoto, Ramen Making Class\n\nNov 3 - Kyoto - Arashiyama - Sagano Romantic Train to Kameoka Station. Cruise on Hzugawa River. Hogon-in Temple &amp; Garden. Walk to Iwatayama Monkey Park. Bamboo Grove.\n\nNov 4 - Kyoto - Kinkaku-ji, Tea Ceremony\n\nNov 5 - Kyoto - Climb Fushimi Inari, Toji Temple, Nishiki Market\n\nNov 6 -Kyoto - Samurai Experience, Explore\n\nNov 7 - Kyoto - Kiyomiza Dera Temple, Head to Osaka\n\nNov 8 - Osaka - Dotonburi &amp; Rose Garden Park\n\nNov 9 - Osaka - Nara Deer Park\n\nNov 10 - Osaka - Osaka Castle &amp; Osaka Castle Park\n\nNov 11 - Osaka - Yasaka Shrine, Kuromon Ichiba Market (TBD if we need this extra day!)\n\nNov 12 - Hakone - Take it easy. We'll be tired by this point - so a stay at a Ryokan with a private Onsen  sounds good.\n\nNov 13 - Hakone - Slow Morning.Travel back to Tokyo.\n\nNov 14 - Tokyo - Asakusa - Kaninarimon, Nakamise Dori, Pagoda, Sensoji Kappabashi Street\n\nNov 15 - Tokyo - Leaving it open! Don Quijote probably for some souvenir shopping.\n\nNov 16 - Tokyo - Fly Home!\n\nThank you so much!",

Also, you are zooming along in traffic but right at tailpipe level, sucking up fumes. Not the best way to see the city. We are opting for a 3 hour e-bike tour instead, a much more relaxed way to see the city, plus cheaper and you get time to get off the bike and experience the city.",

The hike up around the monkey park is not a cake walk. So not sure if you might want to slow down a bit that day.\n\nHope you enjoy the honeymoon!!!",

I took a \\*wonderful\\* \"home cooking/bento box\" class taught by an older Mom and her 30s-aged son in Osaka and it was delightful. I'm a pretty passionate hobby cook and I learned a good 3 or 4 skills I was able to take home, being that we were making bento boxes, it was simple/quick enough that we were all (about 6 of us) able to make a good sized meal to eat together, and it was a fun detour from the many \"big\" attractions (temples/shrines/museums/parks) that can be pretty de-personal. I also attended a pretty bare-bones takoyaki making get-together, that was less useful from a learning perspective, but was definitely super fun.\n\nI'll also agree with your comment about the challenge of finding ingredients/tools in your home country for *most* countries, but honestly (and some people might disagree with me on this) Japanese cooking is often pretty simple/minimalist and quite easy to replicate at home with basic pots/pans and ingredients that pretty much most major grocery stores (in the US) carry these days. The number of dishes built on a base of soy sauce/miso/mirin is staggering.",

If you're going to Asakusa/Sensoji I would lump Skytree with that day instead since they're in close proximity to each other. So would personally swap Meiji Jingu into your Harajuku day as they're are right next to each other. As others have stated, Halloween is crazy so bare that in mind and dont overload the itinerary that day",

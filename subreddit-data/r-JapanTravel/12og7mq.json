    "postText": "Hi! It just has come to my attention that we will be in Japan on our 3 weeks trip during Silver Week. I must\u2019ve missed it when I was looking at the list of holidays a few months ago. \n\nMy question is, do I switch up my itinerary around to avoid going to Disney Sea on a Sunday during Silver Week? I am big on theme parks and I always get the fast passes when available, but I am a bit defeated knowing it will be a holiday. \n\nTruth is, I was looking forward to ending our trip in a nice hotel in the Disney resort area and it also happens to be decently close to Narita. Alternatively, I could just go to Disney Sea during our initial days in Tokyo and end our trip in Yokohama/Tokyo and finish up the last remaining things that I did not get to do initially.\n\nMy husband thinks that maybe we should just chance it and go anyways but I\u2019m not quite convinced. Help! What has Silver Week previously looked like?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHere is what my rough itinerary looks like (it is super detailed on my Wanderlog). \n\nTokyo: 6 nights\nSept 5 - arrival day, turn on eSIM, exchange JR pass, get to the hotel and explore the Ginza area (where our hotel is). \n6 - team lab, rainbow bridge, Tokyo tower\n7 - Shinjuku, nightlife activity \n8 - Shibuya, Harajuku\n9 - Starbucks Reserve, Shibuya sky \n10 - sumo tournament \n11 checkout \n\nFujikawaguchiko: 3 nights\n11 - travel day, ebike rentals, ropeway\n12 - Onsens, Five Lakes, ninja park, massage\n13 - Fuji Q\n14 checkout \n\nHiroshima: 2 nights\n14 - Long travel day, explore the lighthouse and restaurant on arrival. \n15 - Hiroshima, Miyajima\n16 checkout \n\nOsaka: 3 nights\n16 - stop in Himeji, the bunny island?; check in to hotel in Osaka and then head to Dotonbori \n17 - explore Osaka\n18 - USJ \n19 checkout \n\nKyoto: 4 nights \n19 - shop for kimonos, fish market, shrines\n20 - Arashiyama bamboo forest &amp; monkeys\n21 - Nara day trip \n22 - Fushimi Inari either early in the morning or at night (when dark) / explore Kyoto\n23 checkout \n\nDisneyland Tokyo: 2 nights \n23 - stop in Nagoya? Go out to Tokyo for last-minute shopping or low key evening at the hotel or area\n24 - Disney Sea \n25 - check out/ last day\n\n\nFeel free to roast my itinerary if something I am doing seems unreasonable. \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks for the help!",

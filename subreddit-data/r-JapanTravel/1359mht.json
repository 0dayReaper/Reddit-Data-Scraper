    "postText": "Hi guys! I had a wedding last week in Hokkaido and I love this island, so I'd like to report on a list of recommendations I have from this trip and prior.\n\nThis was my first time aiming for hanami in Japan, and specifically in Hokkaido. Official bloom predictions had stated full bloom would be on April 21 this year, however the majority of cherry trees in Maruyama Park/Hokkaido Jingu are *NOT* Yoshino sakura, and so official bloom predictions will not give you the best timing. The majority of sakura trees here (about 75%) are Ezoyama Zakura and Yaezakura, which are later blooming trees which this year reached full bloom about 5-7 days after Yoshino sakura. My friend arrived on the forecasted full bloom day and was quite a bit underwhelmed; climate change is especially rough for hanami.\n\nIn Sapporo, you'll want to visit Susukino, Japan's safest night life/red light district. In the daytime the fun places to go here are Surugaya Shopping Center, Tanukikoji Shopping Street, any of the many (many) maid cafe's (I recommend \u3086\u3044\u307e\u30fc\u308b)  the Animate Building, Melonbooks (the best doujinshi store), Daimaru/Pole Town/Aurora Town for tourist goods shopping, Pokemon Center above the Daimaru, Chitosetsuru Sake Museum, Sapporo Beer Museum. Get your exercise in by walking in the underground tunnel between Susukino and Sapporo stations, or along the Toyohira River if you're staying in Nakajima Koen area. Good restaurants are plentiful, so it's hard to recommend anything in particular, but dairy is the big thing in Hokkaido so be sure to get ice cream (which is also really popular for the younger local crowd to do at the end of a night of drinking). There's information booths in Susukino that can give you info about the other (18+) night life activities and what's English friendly. I also personally recommend going to the Historical Village (Kaitaku-no-Mura) if you're interested in Japanese colonial architecture/history/a big Golden Kamuy fan, since that is the main holy ground for the anime.\n\nLake Shikotsu has a great onsen at Marukoma Onsen, which is a ryokan (also ok for day trip visits) this onsen is tattoo friendly, has some English speakers but many Mandarin speakers. It's even open during the winter and has an outdoor bath - so if you're wanting to sit in a bath while being snowed on, here's your chance. It's easiest to reach via bus from Chitose Station, but this bus comes at long intervals so you'll probably find yourself spending time in the onsen town. Enjoy Log Bear coffee/cake set for \\~$5 USD, highly recommend!\n\nOtaru is entertaining, but a bit of a tourist trap. I still recommend visiting here if you're interested in architecture, regardless, as you'll see the equivalent of Japanese Wild West architecture. Since Hokkaido was colonized in the late 19th century, many buildings strongly resemble the old West US on the outside. The main tourist fare Otaru is known for is glassware and fromage; you can get most of the fromage at the tourist shopping areas at the airport/Sapporo, but the glassware is still unique to Otaru. Le-TAO has fantastic cookies, you must try them.\n\nAsahikawa is 1.5 hours by train from Sapporo, about \u00a55000 each way per person, and has a few interesting locations to see, though it is a smaller town so don't expect to be overloaded by tourist attractions. You'll be travelling primarily by cab. Hokkaido Gokokujinja is located here, and is essentially a Japanese version of the US's Vietnam war memorial, except it's also a Shrine. Hokkaido Gokokujinja is a less controversial branch of the Yasakuni Shrine in Tokyo, and is very interesting to see as an American if you're used to American memorials. Unlike Yasakuni, though, this Shrine is owned by the State and it's gods are now the same as Hokkaido Jingu; though you can still see the building built to house the soldier spirits. Across the street is the Hokochin Museum, another holy ground for Golden Kamuy fans and another incredible thing to see if you're into military history. Asahikawa was founded as a military town by the soldier-farmers sent by the Meiji government to colonize the island, and as such this base is the nexus of a lot of that colonial history. It has memorabilia from many of the 7th Infantry Divisions campaigns, including in Manchuria against Russia, on Guadalcanal, and even up to modern day Iraq. Hokuchin Museum is not open all year, so figure out in advance if it's a good time to go. In Asahikawa, you'll also want to visit Asahiyama Zoo. It has all sorts of exhibits, but I think it's most famous because they walk the penguins around the zoo in the winter. Furarito is a cool old school-style food street to see and has a few famous shops, including Hachiya Ramen (made famous by its honey ice cream) and Gin'neko.\n\nI have yet to go to Hakodate, so can't make any recommendations there beyond this: it's 4 hours to get to by train from Sapporo, it has a really cool star fort, and it's supposedly known for squid. It was briefly the capital of the short-lived Ezo Republic during the end of the Boshin War. When the shinkansen station is finished in Sapporo it will be easier to visit Hakodate.\n\nBiei/Furano - you're going to see tour buses offering a trip to see these locations. Be wary; you should check bloom reports to see whether or not the fields are in bloom. Otherwise, it could just be a 4 hour bus ride to see a tree made famous by a Nissan commercial 50 years ago. If you go during bloom though, this is the definition of idyllic farming, these people are the types that literally retired from Tokyo to start farms that look pretty, they don't even grow stuff worth money.\n\nNibutani/Shiraoi - These are the places to visit if you're into Ainu history. As a former Hawaiian resident I have mixed feelings about this, but I had been recommended to visit these by an Ainu person and so I feel inclined to actually make the recommendation. I'd probably say Nibutani (near Biratori) is the better one to visit, as Shiraoi has long queues, but Shiraoi is easier to visit since it's by train on the way to/from Hakodate.",

Descriptions are written from the Ainu perspective (\"Our culture,\" \"a difficult time in our history\").

                    "comment": "Not a local, but the wife is/was (born in Asahikawa, raised in Otaru/Hassamu, moved to the US after college). COVID made travel to Japan difficult, but I went in September last year and again this late April, and set for another trip this winter.\n\nAs my wifes grandmother was a shrine maiden in her younger years, her great-grandfather was a priest at Hokkaido Gokokujinja (in Asahikawa) during and before the war, and her family ran another shrine before that for some generations, she had a connection to shrines that made it ideal to have a traditional wedding. It's not something I would do without numerous people fluent in Japanese involved.\n\nThe wedding process was like this: I booked the date with the Hokkaido Jingu shrine (in Sapporo) 4 months in advance, set for roughly hanami time, there was no difficulty booking the time we wanted. I was allowed 1 rebooking without charge. Booking fee was \u00a530,000, and \u00a570,000 more day of. My wifes sister is in a kimono class, so we rented kimono through them at a good rate for such high quality kimono (\u00a5200,000 for both of us, including her hair and makeup). The wedding photographer cost about \u00a550,000 - I get the pics by CD which makes me smile because I don't have a disc reader. Photo's and videos are otherwise forbidden in the shrine haiden (my friends apparently did it anyways and the shrine staff didn't yell at them at least). At Hokkaido Jingu, each family was allowed up 12 people; a total of 16 friends was permitted. You cannot mix seats if you have more friends or family than the prescribed number of seats; these are hard limits and dictated by strict rules in rituals. We waived all wedding fees; in Hokkaido its typical that everyone pays the same amount per person (I believe the amount is usually \u00a520,000) but since many people travelled from overseas, or from across Japan, I didn't feel it necessary. The shrine would otherwise have collected it for us.\n\nThe Monday before the wedding (which was on Friday) we went into the shrine to be debriefed on what would happen. All instructions were given in Japanese; they don't have any strong English speaking staff. We had to arrive at the shamisho 1 hour before the wedding, were dressed in a separate room by the kimono class, and received a second set of instructions - this time it was official in time was tight. We were given our seishi and had to write the date and our names in Japanese. I nearly wrote \u6b63 for the year rather than \u4e94 because I was nervous. This was folded and placed in my kimono collar, and we proceeded into the shrine. You can read about the rest of the ritual there, but the Hokkaido Jingu was apparently very nice because it had all the possible shinto instruments playing during the ceremony. The miko-san were incredibly helpful to me; but my family did not speak Japanese and without my sister-in-law making hand gestures to them on how to do things like fold the candy paper or when to stand, they'd have been lost. The ceremony took about 30 minutes, we walked out afterwards and had about 15 minutes for pictures, then 30 minutes to get undressed. If you rent a kimono through a kimono rental, you won't be time constrained for pictures, but you will not have an attendant to keep your kimono properly tied and tight, and to pose you the correct way for pictures.\n\nThe shrine provided us gifts, these included 2 bottles of sake, a kamidana, ofuda, 2 silk omamori for husband/wife, the 3 weddings sake cups we shared sake from, our seishi, our candies, and a few other things I forget. Overall, I'm surprised how much we got as gifts/mementos from the shrine.\n\nI had originally planned to do hanami/jinghis khan under the cherry trees, but Maruyama park forbade grilling, so we had bento's. After the wedding, my sister-in-law got us an izakaya for \u00a53,000 per person for 2 hours unlimited drinks and small meal, a karaoke after for the same price for 2 hours unlimited drinks, and afterwards we called it quits and went to a love hotel because going to her dads house that night would've been awkward.",

Also, although Sapporo is the fifth largest city in Japan, it's significantly less crowded than Tokyo, and most tourists visiting the island are Taiwanese so as a Westerner you can fool yourself into thinking there aren't many tourists while you walk around. Susukino also has a fantastic night life vibe while also not being filled with Americans, which is something Tokyo can't give you.\n\nHokkaido is also known as the second worst prefecture when it comes to bad drivers, I think only Aichi ranks worse? That said, I'd never recommend anyone to drive in Japan myself, particularly because a US Drivers License is not legal in Japan, you need an IDP which is another pre-flight hoop to jump through.",

Also, calling an entire city with plenty of sights, surrounding mountaings and interesting history a \"tourist trap\" is ridiculous. \n\nThe food is among the best in Japan. Soup curry, ramen and one specific tsukemen shop I love that has the best tsukemen in all of Japan in my books. Jingisukan is fantastic, although there are far too many overpriced locations. But then again - my friends and I walked into one that was ran by a mama-san and younger girls, full of locals (right next to one of the billion Daruma's) and they were exceptionally accommodating to us foreigners.",

As far as I can tell, Hokkaido people have been more welcoming to me than say, Tokyo.\n\nI've also entered a dozen of those tiny 6-customer max bars dotted around Susukino and, as someone whose Japanese is elementary schooler at best, I've been welcomed in every one of them and everyones tries striking up a conversation.\n\nThe only problem I experience in Sapporo thus far was at a kyudo shop who didn't want to sell to a bow to a foreigner. The neighboring shop owner (a yugake manufacturer) said the other store was owned by his brother, he had chastized him, and offered me a discount on a different bow he himself could supply me. It took a few months to make (it was custom made for me at the price of an off-the-shelf bow) and he walked me over to the other store (both at Teine station) and made sure I was able to get good service in buying arrows. It's very typical to get the first response; a lot of Japanese martial arts shops are hesitant to sell to foreigners. But to take me there and make sure I don't get bad service? How am I suppose to pay him for that? Nah, Sapporo people are not rude.",

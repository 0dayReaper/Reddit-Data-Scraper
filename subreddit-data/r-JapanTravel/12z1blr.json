    "postText": "Update: made it through just as others described\u2026I carried what I could in my backpack in case they asked to inspect, but knives were checked.  After security, go to customs and immigration, scanned passport, got the happy Mt Fuji picture and moved onto immigration.  My tax free purchases were under $2000 USD.  Not sure if other procedures apply for higher amounts.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI have read a number of conflicting things about the tax free process upon departure, including one note that says the process changed on April 1, 2023.  We purchased some jewelry at tax free stores, they simply didn\u2019t charge the tax on the transaction and we don\u2019t have any special forms or documentation inside our passports.  I don\u2019t know what would trigger any additional process at the airport, but I want to be sure we don\u2019t have a problem after we have checked our bags.  Any recent experiences that required you to do something at the airport?",

We got the knife tax-free too so it would have been linked to my passport. Nobody cared. I scanned my passport as mentioned above, and the sign near the scanner showed that there were two possibilities that could come up once successfully scanned. Mine was a picture of Mount Fuji and a thank you, which meant I just proceeded through security like everybody else.\n\nSo other than scanning my passport as I passed by, I literally did nothing else and there were no problems.\n\nETA:  I kept all my receipts handy, with my tax-free purchase receipts separate for just in case. I didn't need any of them, but probably not a bad idea to be prepared.",

            "comment": "For tax free the rules are pretty simple.  There are two designations for tax free:  general goods and consumable goods.\n\nIf when you use the item it depletes and runs out at some point then it is a consumable good.  IE, food, shampoo, perfume, lotions, powders, etc..  These items have to remain sealed while in Japan and can only be used after leaving the country.  If you plan on using them before leaving Japan then you should pay the tax on them.\n\nGeneral goods:  purchases of a value of 5,000 yen or more are eligible for tax-free status if they are purchased at a location that is enrolled in the tax-free program.  When this happens the location will take your passport info and the purchase will be associated with your passport (unless the location is 'old school' and gives you a lengthy paper receipt.)    General goods have to leave Japan with you.  That's it.  In theory these goods are supposed to be 'gifts' - but I suppose you can purchase gifts for yourself.\n\nThe uncertainty comes down to a manual customs check at points of departure.  If you do not have the goods with you at customs then customs can (probably will) charge you the tax for those items at that time.  However, if customs thinks that you resold your stuff inside of Japan then they can levy a fine or even jail time.\n\nThat's why people say that the goods should be with you when you leave (in your carry-on.)  If the items are in your checked luggage then, in theory, customs can have the luggage retrieved but the reality is that they are more likely to simply charge you the tax on them and move on.  Retrieving luggage from an international plane that's already been loaded or in the process of being loaded is not a trivial act.  That could cause a significant delay to the flight.\n\nThe process at the airport is that you are supposed to scan your passport at the customs desk (some people straight up miss this step when leaving since it's after security but you aren't funneled into a line going to it) and the reader will either show a 'thank you' or 'see customs' type message.  I'm paraphrasing the message.  If you get the 'see customs' response then you are being selected to talk to a customs official who may request physical verification of your tax-free goods to ensure that they are leaving the country.\n\nYou can read about the tax-free thing here at the official japan government site:\n\n[https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/pamph/shohi/menzei/201805/pdf/explanation\\_eng.pdf](https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/pamph/shohi/menzei/201805/pdf/explanation_eng.pdf)\n\nand\n\n[https://www.customs.go.jp/english/c-answer\\_e/extsukan/5004\\_e.htm](https://www.customs.go.jp/english/c-answer_e/extsukan/5004_e.htm)",

I wonder if you could take a picture of the items in your checked luggage before you head to the airport.  I have no idea if that'd help in that situation though.  It would be date and time stamped so... maybe?\n\nAt that point, it'll be a matter of how they are feeling, probably the overall value of the goods (is it worth the effort to charge the tax,) and whatever standard operating procedure they have to follow.\n\nThe possible outcomes:\n\n* You are let through without paying\n* You are asked to pay the taxes on the missing items which you do at the airport itself (I believe it is a separate counter though.)\n* They call for the checked luggage to be brought over to be inspected\n\nAt the end of the day, it's not a big deal.  The likelihood of being selected for manual inspection seems to be extremely low.  Even if you are selected for a secondary inspection the customs official might not request visual confirmation of the goods.  That's an \"as necessary\" designation sooo...\n\nI suspect that there is a threshold of value in play as well.",

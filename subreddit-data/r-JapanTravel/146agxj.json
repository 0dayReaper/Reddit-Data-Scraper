    "postText": "My husband and I are going to Japan for our honeymoon/birthdays/one-year wedding anniversary/everything-in-one trip! We're so excited, but also feeling a bit overwhelmed like everyone else.\n\nWe adore Japanese food and our main priorities are good food and sightseeing. We love wandering museums/temples/gardens, so we figured we'd spend a bit more time in Kyoto than the other places we have on our itinerary. We're late 20s/early 30s, so we're prepared to walk lots and tend to go faster than most others! We're not fans of amusement parks, so opted not to spend some days at Disneysea/Universal.\n\nWe haven't booked any hotels or ryokans yet because we wanted to nail down a rough itinerary first. We're also keen to book a decent amount of restaurants (fingers crossed for some Michelin starred restaurants). Any recommendations/suggestions would be appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Day 1 \u2013 Saturday, Oct 28: Arrive in Tokyo**\n   * Arrive at Narita Intl Airport at 3:00pm\n   * Pick up IC Card/other items\n   * Spend day relaxing/adjusting to local time\n* **Day 2 \u2013 Sunday, Oct 29: Tokyo**\n   * Meiji Shrine\n   * Yoyogi Park\n   * Harajuku\n   * Shimokitazawa\n   * Shibuya\n* **Day 3 \u2013 Monday, Oct 30: Tokyo**\n   * Tsukiji Fish Market\n   * Namiyoke Inari Shrine\n   * Hamarikyu Gardens\n   * Ginza\n* **Day 4 \u2013 Tuesday, Oct 31: Tokyo**\n   * Asakusa\n   * Senso-ji Temple\n   * Tokyo National Museum\n   * Ueno Park\n* **Day 5 \u2013 Wednesday, Nov 1: Tokyo**\n   * Tokyo Imperial Palace\n   * Royal gardens\n   * Studio Ghibli Museum (if we can get tickets)\n   * Shinjuku\n* **Day 6 \u2013 Thursday, Nov 2: Hakone**\n   * Travel to Hakone and stay at ryokan\n* **Day 7 \u2013 Friday, Nov 3: Kyoto**\n   * Travel to Kyoto\n   * Kiyomizu-dera Temple\n   * Explore Gion and Higashiyama\n   * Nishiki Market\n   * Yasaka Shrine\n* **Day 8 \u2013 Saturday, Nov 4: Kyoto**\n   * Philosopher\u2019s Path\n   * Nanzen-ji Temple\n   * Kinkaku-ji Temple\n   * Kyoto Botanical Gardens\n   * Fushimi Shrine \u2013 torii gates \u2013 go at night time for good vibes\n* **Day 9 \u2013 Sunday, Nov 5: Kyoto**\n   * Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\n   * Tenryu-ji Temple\n   * Iwatayama Monkey Park\n* **Day 10 \u2013 Monday, Nov 6: Kyoto Free Day?**\n* **Day 11 \u2013 Tuesday, Nov 7: Kyoto Free Day?**\n* **Day 12 \u2013 Wednesday, Nov 8: Osaka**\n   * Travel to Osaka\n* **Day 13 \u2013 Thursday, Nov 9: Osaka**\n   * Osaka Aquarium\n   * TeamLab Botanical Garden\n* **Day 14 \u2013 Friday, Nov 10: Osaka**\n   * Kuromon Market\n   * Dotonbor\n   * Hozenji temple\n* **Day 15 \u2013 Saturday, Nov 11: Osaka**\n   * Sumiyoshi Taisha Shrine\n   * Osaka Castle\n   * Shitennoji Temple\n* **Day 16 \u2013 Sunday, Nov 12: Day trip to Nara**\n   * Todai-ji temple\n* **Day 17 \u2013 Monday, Nov 13: Osaka Free Day?**\n* **Day 18 \u2013 Tuesday, Nov 14: Koyasan**\n   * Travel to Koyasan and stay at Fukuchiin if we can book it\n* **Day 19 \u2013 Wednesday, Nov 15: Tokyo**\n   * Travel to Tokyo\n* **Day 20 \u2013 Thursday, Nov 16: Tokyo**\n   * Depart from Narita airport at 6:30pm",

They are capacity controlled by definition and are a free + uncrowded way to see the royal family's gardens.",

            "comment": "I'd suggest splitting Tokyo into two equally long time periods at the beginning and end of the trip. Pick one hotel in the east and another hotel west of the Imperial Garden. Pick whichever hotel is closer to places you want to shop at for the latter one. In each stay, visit the sights closer to your hotel. You'll save a bunch of time you otherwise just sit on public transit. Getting from one part of Tokyo to another often takes longer than you'd expect.\n\nIchijou-in is reputed to have the best food in Koyasan. Only place there that I've stayed at and it was very good.\n\nBased on your interests, I'm not sure Osaka is a good fit. Street food is the weak spot in Japanese cuisine IMHO. I think Kanazawa would be a better fit. Kanazawa will be near peak foliage towards the second half of your trip and Kenroku-en is one of the greatest gardens in Japan. It also has several top-level sushi restaurants (with Mekumi being the best of them) that aren't *as* difficult to book as the Tokyo ones (but still quite difficult)",

            "comment": "day 7, the day itself looks good, but nishiki is poking out a bit. timewise it may not work out, and its a bit of a travel there. i suggest you stick with higashiyama including kiyomizudera and dont miss kodaiji, when its getting \"late\" head over to yasaka and explore gion\n\nday 8: maybe kinkakuji is better left of that day, so you can explore the philisophers path more fully. fushimi inari is okay if you go late. \n\nday 9: there is a good chance you could do kinkakuji before or after arashiyama if you only do the three things on the list. maybe start with tenryuji, when you exit past the garden you are standing at the entrance to the bamboo grove. walk through there, then head to the bridge/monkey park if you so chose. maybe spend the rest of the day exploring arashiyama. or skip the monkey park and explore more arashiyama. if you get \"sick of it\" and its like 3pm you can head to kinkakuji, but chances are, you can spend a day in arashiyama without any trouble...\n\nday 10 and day 11  \nnow with a free day 10 or day 11, you could head to north kyoto and see kinkakuji. a little west of kinkakuji is ryoanji and ninnaji (you can walk there but if you happen to catch a bus, your feet will thank you). I also like kitano tenmangu\n\nseeing nijo castle might be a good change of pace from all the temples. I liked it. seeing the imperial palace is impressive from the size of it. apparently you can get in and see stuff. i never managed to. however, both locations are quite central, and from there it is very possible to head over to nishiki market",

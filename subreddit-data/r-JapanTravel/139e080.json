    "postText": "I received incredible support from this community in planning the perfect trip, and now it's my turn to repay the favor. As mentioned in previous posts, this destination had been a long-awaited dream (originally planned for April 20', but unfortunately, it was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic). With three and a half years to plan, I can confidently state that this has been the most remarkable travel I've ever experienced (having already visited over 30 countries to date).\n\nPlanned Itinerary: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/11gmwut/final_itinerary_marapr_2023_22_days_tokyo_osaka/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1)   \nAlready shared a little bit of my experience here: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1295uo1/currently_travelling_in_japan_here_are_some/)\n\nSome highlights:\n\n* Food is part of any destination, and when it comes to delectable meals and snacks, Japan truly stands out. I made sure to experience in a wide array of culinary delights during my trip (with the exception of Kobe beef, which I regrettably couldn't find at a reasonable price after initially missing some opportunities). From matcha and matcha ice cream to sakura ice cream, I savored the flavors unique to Japan. I explored various types of ramen with different soup bases, relished in tsukemen (ramen with separate noodles), delighted in tonkatsu (fried pork), enjoyed mochi, eel, sushi, and sashimi. I also sampled yakisoba, different styles of okonomiyaki (Japanese-style pancakes), wagyu beef, and indulged in an exquisite omakase course. Seafood was a highlight, including oysters, taiyaki (fish-shaped dough filled with custard or bean paste), nikoman, yakitori (grilled chicken skewers), dango, gyozas, and the famous fluffy cheesecake from Rikuro's in Osaka. I didn't miss out on tempura, onigiri, yakiniku (Japanese barbecue), tamagoyaki (rolled omelet), dorayaki (pancakes filled with bean paste), sukiyaki, gyukatsu (beef katsu), katsudon, curry, udon, takoyaki (octopus balls), and even indulged in some fancy fruits. Not to forget the comforting oyakodon (chicken and egg rice bowl), omuraisu (rice omelet), Chinese cuisine, Korean dishes, and melon pan. I had meticulously compiled a comprehensive list on my phone to ensure I didn't miss out on any must-try delicacies.\n* You might be concerned about the calorie intake and potential weight gain after all that delicious food, and I had similar thoughts initially. However, let me assure you that walking played a significant role in balancing things out. Throughout my 22-day trip, I averaged a staggering 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) of walking per day. In total, I covered hundreds of miles/kilometers on foot. Surprisingly, I managed to return home without any weight change. This turned out to be a remarkable highlight of the trip.\n* Among the multitude of tourist attractions I visited, several stood out as my absolute favorites. The Universal Studios theme park provided thrilling experiences. The iconic Miyajima tori gate, standing majestically in the sea, left me in awe of its beauty and significance. Mount Fuji, with its breathtaking views, was a definite highlight of the trip. The Tokyo Skytree offered panoramic vistas of the cityscaper. The Tokyo Art Aquarium, creating a unique and immersive experience. Lastly, the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan impressed me. These attractions left a lasting impression and added an extra layer of magic to my journey.\n* I was incredibly fortunate to time my trip to Japan just one week before the peak of the cherry blossom season. It felt like an extraordinary stroke of luck, especially since the flowers bloomed earlier than expected this year. Experiencing the cherry blossoms in full bloom was truly a dream come true. One of the most captivating aspects of this season in Japan is the diverse range of landscapes with cherry trees. From the combination of cherry blossoms and castles in Osaka and Hiroshima to the Chidorigafuchi moat in Tokyo. The sight of Mount Yoshino's 30,000 sakura flowering cherry trees. Mount Fuji and Fuji Cemetery were simply breathtaking. The Meguro River (Tokyo) and the Philosopher's Path (Tetsugaku no michi) in Kyoto painted scenes of beauty. Even at night, the Nijo-jo Castle in Kyoto. And if you're lucky enough and have time, you might witness the Sakura snowfall, as the petals fall. The cherry blossom season in Japan is an experience that exceeded all my expectations.\n* One aspect that truly impressed me during my trip to Japan was the organization and efficiency of the public transportation system, particularly the trains. Although it took us a couple of days to fully understand Tokyo's train and subway system, once we understood how it worked and onboarded with the information provided by Google Maps, we felt like seasoned locals (well, maybe not entirely local, but consider that I live in a big city and travel frequently). The convenience and reliability of the trains were remarkable. While train fares may be relatively expensive, they are part of the overall experience. As someone who comes from a place without bullet trains, I was thrilled to embark on this experience of enjoying bento boxes on the shinkansen. It added an extra layer of excitement, making it even more memorable.\n* For Pokemon enthusiasts, I highly recommend visiting the Pokemon stores in various cities across Japan. Each store offers a unique selection of stuffed Pokemon and showcased Pokemon, so you'll find different items in each location. The stores are conveniently located, and we even stumbled upon some of them \"by accident\" while exploring with the help of Google Maps. So, keep an eye out for these stores during your travels.\n* One aspect that left a big impression on me during my time in Japan is the exceptional level of safety in the country. Coming from a developing country (speaking as two men), this was a particularly impactful experience. The sense of security I felt while walking around, being able to walk worrying about personal safety, was truly liberating. It provided a total peace of mind that I'm not used to. We encountered only two minor incidents that slightly bothered us. On one occasion, an elderly man made some mocking remarks, and on another, someone attempted to engage us in what was clearly a scam in the Shinjuku area. However, these incidents were far from posing any real threat, and overall, Japan remained an incredibly safe destination throughout our journey.\n* I couldn't agree more about the convenience of the TA-Q-BIN luggage delivery service in Japan. It proved to be incredibly handy, especially considering that we traveled via shinkansen and stayed in six different cities. It's advisable to check with your hotel beforehand to ensure they offer luggage delivery services. It's worth noting that we encountered a slight caveat during our stay at an Airbnb in Hiroshima. We had to personally collect and drop off our bags at one of the delivery service stores or you can utilize a 7-Eleven for this purpose (also you will need help to write the form in Japanese). However, if you opt to stay at a hotel, it becomes much easier as nearly every hotel is equipped to receive and handle the delivery of your luggage.\n* After spending years planning and immersing myself in countless hours of content about Japan, I initially had concerns that it might detract from the actual experience of visiting tourist attractions. A valuable tip that helped me overcome this potential issue. I made sure to include spare time in my itinerary, allowing myself the freedom to get lost, take my time, and truly explore. While a trip to Japan during the high season or for those traveling from far away WILL require planning, it doesn't mean that every single hour of the journey needs to be meticulously scheduled. Embracing spontaneity and leaving room for unplanned adventures adds an element of surprise and discovery. So, while planning is essential, it's equally important to leave space for flexibility and let the magic of exploration unfold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it! If you're currently planning a trip to Japan, I wish you the best and hope your journey is filled with unforgettable experiences. If you've recently returned from your adventure, I can understand the feeling of post-travel blues.",

Some of the areas you list can be inconvenient to reach via public transportation, like Cape Kamui and the blue pond.\n\nHave you thought about flying into Hiroshima instead of Osaka? That would reduce some of your train time, right now you are going Osaka &gt; Hiroshima &gt; Kyoto and you could change it to Hiroshima &gt; Osaka &gt; Kyoto (or swap the last two).",

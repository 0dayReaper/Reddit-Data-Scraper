Do japanese people have an alternative for people who struggle with this? I can still use a fork so should I bring my own or do they have them at restaurants? Is it better to eat with your hands? I really don't know and I'm a bit embarresed about it...",

Most restaurants will have one, but I'd keep a set in your bag just in case.\n\n**So-called manners are not worth hurting yourself!** Not to mention these are people you will never meet again.\n\nIf you look non-east asian they will fully \"understand\" and assume you don't know how to use chopsticks. If you do look asian, by Japanese standards service staff are not really supposed to show negative emotion so any judgment will be silent only :)",

That said, smaller local places and convenience stores might not always have them, so it probably wouldn't hurt to travel around with a fork or something just in case.",

You actually do not usually have spoon when you get soup like miso soup as you are supposed to just take the bowl in your hands and dring from it.\n\nDish that typically are eaten with spoon is curry rice and fried rice. The interesting part is that both are not traditional Japanese dish, one being more Indian and the other is straight Chinese.\n\nTotally agree with bringing your own just in case.",

More permanent hashi that are slightly thicker in diameter hurt my hand less. Maybe give that a try, if you want to use chopsticks. If not ask for western utensils.",

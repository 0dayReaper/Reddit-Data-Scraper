Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* For travelers entering the country on or after April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)). The COVID/quarantine section of Visit Japan Web has been removed.\n* Tourists entering Japan should still have their Immigration process and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration and a QR code for Customs, which can smooth your entry procedures.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

We are planning to use the pass between Jul 12th - 18th. I can exchange the pass before the 12th (within one month) and set that day as start date. Correct?\n2. **Reserved seats**: I can reserve seats at the JR Offices, is there a fee for seats reservation? How can I check if the trains I'd like to take are reserved only or mixed ones?\n3. **USJ, Disney Parks**: when do you suggest to buy tickets? I was worrying that buying them so much in advance would lock me in case there will be pouring rain.\n4. **Restaurants**: I'm basically getting all restaurants suggestions from scouring trip reports. Is there a specific website I can check? (e.g. TripAdvisor or equivalent).\n5. **Luggage storage**: I've been reading that most lockers are day-use, or at most 3 days while I want to go to Kyoto/Osaka with only my small luggage for a total of 7 days. Is the JR East Travel Center storage the only option?",

Those fee are included in your JR Pass so you can reserve for free during your JR Pass period. If you use Navitime app, it will show you the price for specific route.\n3. -\n4. Tabelog is the main restaurant review platform in Japan. Google Maps is pretty decent too.\n5. You can ask your hotel if they will hold it for you -- some will do, or if you are staying at different hotel, you can send the baggage to your next hotel. You can specify delivery date for 7 days in advanced.",

If the answer to either of those last two questions is \"yes\", you're going to have a hard time, even at a cheaper chain. Most sushi places won't be able to avoid cross-contamination at all. And for the ones that might be willing to do it, there won't be a large selection of non-fish rolls/nigiri. There are often some vegetable options (usually pickled), tamago, and occasionally things like cooked beef, but even a mid-range sushi restaurant won't have enough options to make an omakase out of for her. They may not even really have enough options to make a meal at all for her.\n\nAnd I would definitely have a plan for eating everywhere that includes an allergy card. A ton of stuff has dashi in it, and you won't necessarily know that by sight.",

Since we will be traveling eastwards from the airport towards Central Hokkaido first, where should we stay for our first night after arriving - Sapporo or Chitose?\n\nI was thinking of putting up a night at Chitose for a quick rest and then proceed straight to Tomamu (Shimukappu) the next day. We are planning to rent a car, i figured there would be more option near the airport and I would save more time/cost instead of traving in and out of Sapporo on the first day. Would that be a good choice?\n\nShould I just head straight to Sapporo upon arrival for the first night? If I were to rent a car from the Sapporo station area, would it be more expensive (or less vehicle choices)? Or I could travel back to the airport to rent a car?\n\nAnother option I have in my mind is, head straight to Sapporo and then spend day 2 in Sapporo doing some local sightseeing before heading to Tomamu on day 3.\n\nPlease advise.

The Yodobashi Camera (largest store/electronics store in Japan) does open at 9:30, though.\n\n\\----\n\n* Google Maps is pretty good for giving transit directions.\n* If you have an iPhone, you can drop a Suica or Pasmo on it, load it with some yen, and use it for almost everything you need to pay for - transit, many restaurants, and various shopping options. Note that you can not use a Visa card to charge the IC card.\n* If you're on the eastern side of Tokyo at the end of the day (like Akiba/Ueno), I'd probably recommend taking the Keisei Skyliner from Ueno back to the airport, as it's one of the fastest options.",

If you're talking about the Shinkansen, most cars on them are reserved seats, though most trains have cars that don't have reserved seating.\n\nThen beyond that, there are special trains called Limited Express (\u7279\u6025 tokky\u016b). These are similar to the Shinkansen in that they can have reserved seats and unreserved seats.\n\nJR trains that are limited express require an extra fare on top of the regular fare. I normally see many tourists end up on these trains without the additional fare, so they have to pay the fare on the train when the train staff come around checking tickets.\n\n&gt; Green requires reservation and you have to pick up the vouchers at an office?\n\nI almost never go to the ticket office. You can get reservations at the ticket machines. You may also be able to buy them online depending on what you're looking at.\n\n&gt; Is the green space worth it vs the ordinary space?\n\nHaving ridden many trains...not really.

We're super close to finishing our itinerary for our July trip, and have secured several tickets for some things we wanted to check out so we're finally able to fill in some gaps around those. Thanks to those in past Weekly threads who helped and gave advice.  \n\n\n1. We have one full day and two half days in Kyoto. How ridiculous does this itinerary look? We're all fairly active adults, history/nature buffs, and anticipate super early starts to the mornings:\n\n\\- arrival day do himeji castle.   \n\\- on our one full day do arashiyama early in the morning (sunrise hike!), followed by nijo castle, kiyomizudera (lunch?), and fushimi inari (sunset hike!)  \n\\- on departure day maybe try to see some gion festivities before leaving\n\n  \n2. Has anyone here actually been in Shiori park to watch the Sumidagawa fireworks? How visible is visible - is it a worthwhile experience, or will we be squinting from the grass? We're trying to weigh the pros and cons of good viewing/being close vs fighting the insane crowds.",

Will still be crowded, but probably much easier to get a good spot to watch from.",

The problem is when I say nearing the end of my trip I mean that I'm leaving tomorrow morning so I can't exactly use all my coins at a conbini.

If there are any don quijote stores with self service that might be good cause I usually spend a fair bit of money in there but I haven't seen any so far... or any manga stores, iirc kinokuniya have self service so might go there",

We'd also like to buy the Express Pass to make our life easier, but it's super unclear how that works if we have got our tickets already (the website only offers the Express option once you've already added a base ticket to your cart). Is there a way to purchase Express separately?\n\nI understand this is a super niche question but if anyone has any experience in dealing with a similar situation, we'd love to hear it.

I love going there, but I wouldn't consider any ride at TDR a thrill ride with the possible exception of Splash.",

Also obviously get to the parks as early in the day as possible, and buy whatever express passes you need if you're trying to go to the very popular stuff like USJ.\n\nI was at Fuji-Q and rode most of the coasters in January 2018 (so during one of the busiest tourist years in Japanese history), on a weekday, and every ride had no wait or a very short wait. Longest I had to wait was probably 10 minutes for Fujiyama. As the day rolled on, I did see the lines did get much longer since the local students were getting out of school in the early afternoon.",

You can still get tickets to this one.\n\nThere are touring sumo exhibitions/non-competitions that also happen in the summer, but the schedule for these are basically July 29 - August 29.\n\nBeyond that, there are sumo competitions for amateurs, but I don't think any of those are happening, and they tend to be college or high schoolers, so not all the events are necessarily open to the public.\n\nAn alternative is you can see sumo practice/workouts which happen in the morning. You can book a tour/tickets to see these. I don't use the service, but Klook, for example, has such tickets.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'm heading back for my second trip to Japan for a little over two weeks towards the end of September. Previously, my daughter and I did the usual Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka/Tokyo itenerary, and had a blast. We had a one week JR pass for that trip. \n\nThis time, I'm going solo, and I want to concentrate on Japan's extensive rail network, mostly in rural areas. I love trains, and have ridden them all over the world, but I didn't care much for the famed bullet trains. When I'm on a train, I'm not in a hurry, and in particular, the styling of the shinkansen seemed to want to emulate a jet aircraft with the small oval windows, and general vibe. We made a side day trip to Nara (awesome), and as our pass had expired at that point, we made our way back to tokyo through a series of non-shinkansen trains, and it was such a better experience for viewing the area you are traveling through. Big windows, somewhat slower speed, made for a richer experience, for my tastes at least.\n\nSo my plan for this uppcoming trip is, trains, and more trains, and after that, I'll ride some trains. It would seem as though I'm a slam dunk candidate for a two week rail pass, but my question is this: All the rail pass calculators are based on shinkansen fares, which are quite steep. So, it's easy to suggest that if one is doing more than a round trip from Tokyo to Kyoto and back, the pass is worth it. But I'm having a hard time finding the price of the slower, less glamorous trains, the ones where you just use your Suica card and go. On one hand, if the main activity of the trip is riding trains, it would that perhaps I'm overthinking this, and wouldn't save at all by paying the fares a la carte. As I said, all the information is geared towards the trains I have no interest in. The kind of trains I'd like to ride are the ones I see on this guy's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@AUNZRAILFAN\n\nThanks for any ideas or suggestions. I'm fine with buying a two week pass if it makes sense financially, but a lot of lines in Japan aren't owned by JR, and aren't covered, like this little gem, which is a whopping 310 yen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-Dt3sAdK2s&amp;t=803s\n\nTL;DR: Is a rail pass worth it if you don't want to ride shinkansen?",

Three times a year, JR sells these tickets to allow for 5 days of continuous or non continuous use for any local or rapid train in the country. The exception is you'll need a supplement ticket to cross over into Hokkaido. The next period of sale, I believe, is in July-August and in winter.\n\nThis is perfect if you're looking for that slow change of pace. It's also economical. You can do Tokyo to Osaka for the equivalent of around \u00a52500",

For reference a Shinkansen for the same trip is 13k yen and 2.5 hours. \n\nWithout knowing your actual route, it's hard to say whether or not the pass is worth it.

Essentially, I'd like to see as much as I can from a train window. Ideally, I'd do it all without a lot of laborious planning, somewhat akin to Paul Theroux's style of travel. But Japan is a country that likes to plan ahead, and I'd hate to arrive somewhere and not have a place to stay.\n\nBasically, I feel as though I've done the normal Japan trip, I've seen enough shrines and museums, not to denigrate them at all, the shrine in Nara was amazing. I just like riding on trains. You see things from the window of a train you'll never see elsewhere. And in the rural parts of Japan, they have these dinky narrow gauge trains of just one or two cars that creep through immensely scenic rice paddies, and rural areas. I'd like to just hop from one train to another, getting off when a place looks interesting, or I need a bowl of noodles. What I'm wondering is if I need a JR rail pass for this, or is it unnessesary? It's possible I might want both the pass, and be prepared to use a suica card for trains not covered by the pass. I don't know. Hence, the questions.",

Look into JR East \"Joyful Trains\" and [these independent lines](https://www.tohokukanko.jp/en/features/detail_66.html).  \n\nIt's a bit difficult to say whether a JR pass would be a good deal. The JR East regional passes tend to pay for themselves very quickly but of course are useless for slow travel on non-JR lines. You could come up with a theoretical route and just buy passes as needed. An all-area JR pass is unlikely to be a good deal compared to JR East's offerings.  \n\nEDITED TO ADD: By the way, a lot of the little regional lines don't take Suica, and very often have their own tourist passes. Check before you ride :)",

You can take it to the Ominato line out to Shimokita Peninsula.  It's really far out there.\n\nYou'll have to do some research on whether non-shinkansen still go between Aomori and Hakodate.  Honestly, since you are just in a tunnel under the water, you're not seeing much out the window, it's more cool what you are doing.\n\nOver in Kansai, I enjoyed taking the Kuroshio down to Tanabe.    I've done the express as well as locals.\n\nI don't know how you got between Nara and Tokyo, but I really enjoyed the Kintetsu line between Yamato-Yagi up to Nagoya.

                    "comment": "On the other hand, the regional passes are only for six days of consecutive travel. That could leave me up Hokkaido without a paddle. Maybe my best choice for such a train-centric trip is a two week full nation pass. At $349, it's a pretty good deal for 14 days of travel. You aren't going to get a deal like that on a Eurail pass.",

            "comment": "Rather than looking at the Tokyo to Osaka/Kyoto rail pass, have you considered the smaller local passes? For example, there's a Kansai region one which is about $100 for 5 days, and you can take the train to more remote places like Amanohashidate or Kii-Katsura in Wakayama. If saving money is your priority, it might be more worth it to buy the local passes, use them until the deadline, then get a night bus to your next destination and repeat the process.",

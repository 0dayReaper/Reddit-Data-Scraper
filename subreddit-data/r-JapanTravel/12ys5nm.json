    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nHere is my updated itinerary for this November. I am SO EXCITED, as it is my first time going to Japan! I am finally able to fulfill my dream of visiting JAPAN. \n\nI know there are a lot of uncertainties in my itinerary, but I came here for the best advice and recommendations I could get. \n\nQUESTIONS:\n\nSince the price for the JR Pass is increasing, what should I do in terms of transportation? What would the easiest and most cost-saving/cheapest way to travel be? \n\nI want to visit AT LEAST one onsen in my trip, which one should I go to that aligns with my itinerary? \n\nNOTE: I am not going in November for the autumn leaves, however it is a great bonus as it allows for AWESOME pictures. \n\n21 days\n\nTokyo &gt; Kawaguchiko &gt; Nagoya &gt; Nara &gt; Osaka &gt; Kyoto &gt; Kanazawa &gt; Nagano &gt; Masomatsu &gt; Tokyo\n\n\nDay 1: Tokyo - Arrival\n\nArrive in Tokyo\n\nExplore Akihabara\n\n\nDay 2: Tokyo\n\nMenju-ji Shrine\n\nAsakusa (Senso-ji Temple, + (?))\n\nGinza \n\nTokyo Skytree\n\n\nDay 3: Tokyo \n\nOther shrines + temples \n\nShibuya \n\nHarajuku (?) \n\nTry any restaurants I wanted to tick off (don't have to tick all - chance at end of trip) \n\n\nDay 4: Kawaguchiko\n\nTokyo -&gt; Kawaguchiko \n\nFuji Five Lakes \n\nLake Kawaguchiko  \n\nArakura Fuji Sengen Shrine (Chureito Pagoda)\n\nPanoramic Ropeway (?)\n\n\nDay 5: Nagoya\n\nKawaguchiko -&gt; Nagoya\n\nWhat should I do in Nagoya? I was thinking that it could be a relaxed day to just walk around and chill, what do you think? \n\n\nDay 6: Nara \n\nDay Trip to Nara! \n\nNara park (to see deer + take LOTS of pictures haha) \nWalk to Isuien Gardens \n\nNandaimon Gate (?) - from there walk to Todaiji Temple \n\nOnce finished, go to either Horyuji Temple or Naramachi\n\n\nDay 7: Osaka\n\nNara -&gt; Osaka\n\nShinsekai/Tenma (which is better?) \n\nRecommendations for middle of the day? \n\nExplore Minami at sunset + night \n\n\nDay 8: Osaka\n\nWhat should I do on this day? \n\n\nDay 9: Kyoto\n\nOsaka -&gt; Kyoto\n\nOtagi Temple + lunch at a restaurant? \n\nDaigoji Temple \n\nWhat else? \n\n\nDay 10: Kyoto\n\nFushimi Inari Shrine (arrive before sunrise - hike through Torii gates all the way to the top) (I've heard you can buy a miniature Torii gate and even little fortune foxes, where in Fushimi Inari can you get these?) \n\nArashiyama Bamboo Grove \n\nGion District \n\n\nDay 11: Kyoto\n\nTraditional Tea Ceremony (which ones would you recommend? Hopefully/preferably one where you dress in a kimono? If not, that isn't a problem) \n\nUji \n\nNishiki Market, then explore Poncho Alley (have dinner there?) \n\n\nDay 12: Kanazawa \n\nKyoto -&gt; Kanazawa \n\nStart out by going to Kenrokuen Gardens (as early as possible) \n\nNagamachi - Samurai District \n\nNishi Chaya District (Geisha District) \n\n\nDay 13: Kanazawa \n\nOmicho Market (how different is Omicho market from Nishiki Market (in Kyoto)? Is it still okay to go to Omicho?)\n\nMaybe add something else? Something small? \n\nGet ready to go to Nagano \n\nKanazawa -&gt; Nagano \n\nChill and get settled into accommodation for the night\n\n\nDay 14: Nagano \n\nJigokudani Monkey Park + Onsens (only if snowing) \n\nNarai-juku \n\n(I know I'm hard pressed for time with Narai-juku and Jigokudani, so what should I do? Maybe I could stay the night (on Day 13) in Narai, then visit Jigokudani during the next day (Day 14), returning to Nagano to stay the night? - WHAT SHOULD I DO?)\n\n\nDay 15: Ueno/Matsumoto \n\nSlowly making way back to Tokyo\n\nWhich one should I choose? What should I do there? \n\n\nDay 16: Back to Tokyo\n\nExplore Takasaki (Or somewhere else? What do you recommend?) for a few hours, then head back to Tokyo to get there by the late afternoon. \n\n\nDay 17-20: Tokyo \n\nFREE TIME to do anything, explore, shop, visit restaurants I want to tick off, etc. \nLeave JAPAN :(\n\nEXTRA QUESTIONS:\n\nI have an open day in my itinerary (as it is 21 days and I have 20 so far haha). WHERE SHOULD I GO? \nI was thinking that Fukuoka is a good choice, but what would you recommend? \n\nWhat do you recommend in terms of accommodation? I'm hoping to save some money in terms of my accommodation, so what which money-saving alternatives/choices/options would you recommend to me? \n\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry for the bad formatting, I'm typing this out on mobile haha. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your help :) \nI cannot wait for my trip to Japan! \n\n~Sayonara",

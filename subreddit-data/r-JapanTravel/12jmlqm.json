    "postText": "Here\u2019s one for all the parents out there! \n\nWe\u2019re travelling to Japan in a few weeks with our toilet training little one, and I\u2019m feeling concerned about the public toilet and toilet seat situation. \n\nWe\u2019re using a booster seat at home, and I plan to bring along a portable toilet seat that will fold up so easy to get around with, but it\u2019s unclear whether ours will fit on Japanese toilets. \n\nAre there any go to stores where we can purchase a portable toilet seat in case ours doesn\u2019t fit? I\u2019ve found some on Amazon but they\u2019re no longer available, so looks like buying there might be the only option. \n\nAnd I see there are public toilets for kids in some places - how widespread are they? \n\nFor context, we\u2019re only going to be in Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo, and probably make a day trip to Nara. \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Most public toilets in spots like department stores have kid toilet seats you can put over the toilet seat.  Not in every stall but there\u2019s usually a couple baby/kid stalls with a baby seat and even sometimes kid size urinals or the smaller kid size toilet. Japan is surprisingly kid friendly. \n\n[Department stores](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2020/10/baby-tokyo-department-stores-take-your-children/ ) will also be your friend.  They have mother/baby rooms where you can breastfeed in privacy as public breastfeeding is not common in Japan. The rooms also have a microwave to warm up bottles/food and baby changing areas and sometimes kid sized toilets. There are usually one or two floors of restaurants on the top floors that are easy to eat at with a wide array of foods and, especially during the day, there will be other diners with small children in many of them.  In the basement floors there are awesome food halls where you can get high quality takeaway food to eat at your lodging if you need a midday rest or for dinner.  Much better selection than konbini fare.  You may find it easier (and a bit cheaper) to have your main/large/nicest meal at lunch too.  After lunch, if you\u2019re lucky, your toddler may nap in the stroller so you can explore a bit. \n\nEven if your 4 year old doesn\u2019t use a stroller at home much, still best to bring a lightweight umbrella/fold up type so when they do get tired they can sit in the stroller and you don\u2019t have to carry a heavy 4 year old around.",

Those toilets have a much smaller opening than ameri6toilets. If your kid is 3, 3.5yr or older, they will be able to just sit on it without a booster. I sometimes help her by holding her. Overall going potty in public toilets was a non issue for us.",

            "comment": "Does your kid still wear nappies in case of accidents? \n\nBathrooms are fairly widespread, however during an \"emergency\", they always seem further and less common than I recall. Even worse is opening the door and discovering its a squat toilet. \n\nLarge stores (e.g department stores, Bic/Yodabashi), fast food outlets and train stations (usually inside the turnstiles) are fairly reliable places to find a bathroom, but in busy areas, long lines are common so he will need to be able to give you plenty of warning, or be able to hold it in. Even though my son was fully toilet trained when he went as a toddler, he still had plenty of close calls.",

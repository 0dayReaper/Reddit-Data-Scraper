            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think your Tokyo itinerary is at the moment very light. Day 6 is for instance dedicated to travel to Hilton Tokyo from Shinjuku.  I am not sure if changing hotel here is necessary, but if you do change - you do not need an entire day for this exercise.\n\nDay 2 - Asakusa for instance. I am not sure if you need an entire day to explore Asakusa. If you explore in the morning, you'd be done in the afternoon after some shopping / lunch in the area. \n\nDay 3 - I think my comment here also cascade to your other days. But this day is just lacking detail / plan. Shinjuku is a vast area and you can certainly take advantage of the myriad of activities there (Omeide Yokocho at night, Godzilla, Disney Flagship Store, Shinjuku Goen, etc)\n\nDay 11 - This is just impossible. Your itinerary here is probably doable in 2 days (rushed) or a more realistic 3 days.\n\nI think my comment is - try to refine your Tokyo plan, be more efficient, see if you truly need that many days. I think you can easily pare 2 days there and allocate to Kyoto overnight stay.\n\nFor 15 days, I generally think an efficient itinerary goes like this: 8 nights Tokyo (with day trip to Yokohama/Hakone/Kawaguchiko), 4 nights Osaka (incl day trip to Nara), 3 nights Kyoto.",

Get to Fushimi Inari first thing in the morning (like between 7-8am). If you hike the whole thing to the top of the mountain, expect 2 hours at least, maybe a little more if you want to check out the shrines. Then you could hit up Yasaka later in the day and explore Kyoto streets. I would keep it to that.",

There is a lot to see here ! Like others said, i think the minimum of the minimum is 2 days but the best are 3 days ! Go to Fushimi Inari early in the morning (i took the first train at 6 am in the morning and for taking photos there is almost no crowd !)\n- Are you travelling alone ? I was, so if you are, tell me and i can give you some advice if you want !\n\nI personnally prefered the Kansai over Tokyo (more traditionnal, smaller than Tokyo and less people)\n\nHave fun to prepare your trip !",

Poop Museum? \n\nSkip the eki-ben, they're not worth the price. Just find something to eat before and after the train ride. \n\nPick up the Osaka tourist pass. There are 1 or 2 day options, and it includes all Osaka metro (but not JR) rides, bus rides, and most of the entrance fees for what you listed. There is also an all day Osaka metro pass (break even if you take about 4 rides). Some of the tourist attractions like the river cruise should be reserved ahead of time.\n\nIf you travel between Osaka and Kyoto on the weekends on the Hankyu line, certain times will use the train with a special decor.\n\nRiding the bus can be a bit different between these cities. In Tokyo, it'll be the more common, get on at the front and pay format. But in Kyoto, you get on from the back, mark your start, and pay as you get off the front.\n\nIt'll be very apparent when you arrive, but when using escalators, you stand on the left (and walk on the right) while in Tokyo but opposite in Kansai.",

We went all the way up Mt Inari though so that took some time (pro tip, there are a TON of the orange arch walkways, so don\u2019t feel like you need to get a picture right at the beginning. That stuff stresses me out and realizing that the other route or juuuust a bit further up is much more clear saved me from losing it just to take another picture.) Consider adding in Kiyomizu. Just got done with that today and we enjoyed it (and we\u2019ve seen our fair share of temples so far lol). We\u2019ve enjoyed bopping in and out of shops in the Nishiki Market area too. \n\nAlso, we had a blast up in Nagano/Yudanaka going to the Snow Monkey park. They make it super easy on you too. When you get to Nagano you can buy an all inclusive pass for 2700 JPY that gets you round trip on the subway, bus, entrance fee. It took up most of the day though from Tokyo.",

    "postText": "I have 2 questions related to Takayama!\n\n====\n\nI'm traveling from Takayama to Nagoya in late June. I'm wondering how I can reserve a seat on the Hida Wide view train? Or is it even necessary to do so?  I've heard that train is usually full, but I don't have a JR pass and don't feel like I travel enough to need one. \n\nIf I get the JR Pass, can I reserve a seat on Hida in advance? \n\n====\n\nAnother route I'm considering is from Takayama to Gujo Hachiman. According to Google maps, I'd have to walk from Gujo Hachiman Inter Change to Gujo Hachiman Castle for 45 minutes (in the summer!)... is there a better way to do this? I have a carry on so it's not possible to ride a bike",

There's Mame Bus in Gujo Hachiman, but you still need to walk 13 minute from highway bus stop to local bus stop. And another 20 min from castle bus stop to the castle itself.",

            "comment": "I went from Nagoya through to Toyama in March. The JR Pass is good for the route and you can reserve seats either in person at a ticket office or using one of their automated terminals (the same ones that reserve on the Shinkansen). It looks like you don't necessarily need a reservation, but I'll offer one caution: the windows on the train are large but still have large seams between them, about one every other row of seats, so if you want an uninterrupted view, be careful to pick one that doesn't have a seam. Also, if my experience going the other way is any indication, the train will reverse direction after Gifu and so you'll be going \"backwards\" towards Nagoya.\n\nI have no experience with Gujo Hachiman, so the only thoughts I have there are: maybe there are taxis around you can hail? Or maybe there's luggage storage near the stop? Or maybe you can send your luggage ahead via courier to a future stop?",

            "comment": "Re Gujo Hachiman - stash your stuff somewhere (at the station or maybe tourist center? Best to check/ask way ahead to confirm) since the town is small and is best seen by bike or by foot. The castle (as of March this year) is closed for earthquake reinforcement. Check if they're open.\n\nRe the route you're taking: you're doing Takayama - Gujo Hachiman - Nagoya right? I think you just have to get back to where you got off earlier. Doing a Nagoya - Gujo Hachiman - Nagoya loop was stressful because you have to find the bus stop at the opposite side of the highway. \n\nPS - the shoryudo bus pass is a bang-for-money one in this area. I like it more than trains since you get to have the michi no eki (highway stop) experience and buses tend to be more comfortable than trains",

How do I know which bus will take the shoryudo bus pass on Google Maps? only the busses whose names starting with \"Meitetsu\" take this pass, is that right?",

Some tips though:\n\n* buy from OUTSIDE the country (e.g. via Klook), exchange when you get in. You specify the effectivity dates when you exchange the voucher at the selected stations so it'd be fine to do it before your trip.\n* this is not a regular bus pass you just show the driver and you're good. You still have to reserve tickets from the station especially for long highway trips e.g. Nagoya to Takayama. This is because bus drivers have a manifest of sorts for seat occupancy. Now, does this apply for bus stops? Maybe. I rode a bus from a bus stop only once (coincidentally - from the Gujo Hachiman interchange stop) and the driver had to radio back to base to confirm if I can ride. I was able to ride anyway but it meant the bus was stopped for a good five minutes. On the other side, I used this pass to ride the bus from Shinhotaka Ropeway back to Takayama and I just showed the pass to the bus driver. The difference is that the Shinhotaka Ropeway is the tailend of that bus route, and I booked a seat from Takayama station to Shinhotaka Ropeway\n* when in doubt, ask the staff at your home/starting bus station before going to your destination\n* find the bus station back as you go down the bus and reserve your seat for the bus back before heading off to wherever. One less thing to worry about on the way back, yeah?\n\nThis pass shines for day trips out of the big stations e.g. Nagoya, Takayama. I did Matsumoto Castle as a day trip from Nagoya, for one. Is it optimal? Maybe not. But I just ate breakfast and dinner on the bus (you're allowed to eat in them!) so that saved time.",

Just reserved it a few days in advance from one the reserved ticket machines you find at most bigger stations using the JR Pass. You won't have an issue even booking a ticket on the day you travel as there are always plenty of free seats. Exact same as booking a shinkansen, extremely easy.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am a Dutch girl who walked the Camino de Santiago last year and it sparked a fire in me: I need to be a Dual Pilgrim!!\n\nI would like to walk the Kumano Kodo in March 2024. I am currently preparing myself, but I am a bit overwhelmed by all the information and all the possibilities. I would like to ask my questions to someone who has personal experience with walking the Kumano, instead of spitting through never-ending blogposts and information pages, hence my post here. Excuse my very lengthy post. \n\n\\- Which trail is the \"best\"? I read that the Nakahechi trail is the most common, but it is in my opinion quite short, only 37 km. The Kohechi trail is longer, 63 km, but there is also less information available about this trail. Then you also have the Kiji trail, which sounds interesting as well. Which trail did you do? Did you enjoy it? Any recommendations on which trail to pick?   \n\\- I have understood that it is wise to book your accommodations way in advance, especially since I'm planning to do it during spring, the most popular season. But how far in advance should I book? If I book now I'm booking a year in advance, that might be a bit much. Also, where do you book accommodations? Which sites did you use? Are there any accommodations in particular that you visited that you would highly recommend?   \n\\- I am planning to do it in spring, during the cherry blossom period, so end March/beginning of April. However, would you recommend this? I would love to see the trees, but I am afraid the trail might be too crowded during this time. \n\nThanks so much in advance for reading. Greetings from the Netherlands!",

            "comment": "You should note that Kohechi is not a Camino Santiago type of trail - it mostly leads down dirt tracks at best, you need to carry your own food and water for multiple days with very limited possibility to re-supply and since you will not see anyone for hours - there is limited possibility of assistance in case of accident (and the assistance will arrive in a matter of tens of hours rather than minutes).\n\nKohechi also generally requires full hiking gear as there are parts that are fairly steep or not entirely secured following landslides.",

I was glad I hiked during good weather and I wasn't alone. I highly suggest as well to partner up with someone",

I am doing the Nakahechi route in September this year and I booked through through the kumano kodo website (kumano travel)! I\u2019m doing the suggested itinerary for 5 days/4 nights. The website itself takes some getting use to but, it\u2019s a really good resource! I was able to pick my dates, choose my housing including meals (breakfast, lunch, supper) and send it in to be reviewed by someone before making a reservation. I also arranged a luggage transfer through the website. I did mine 6 months in advance, I think a year might be too much time as some of the housing is small and doesn\u2019t put their availability up until 3-6 months in advance.\n\nAlternatively, you could pick the cities you want to stay in and try to find Airbnb\u2019s or hotels but I found that some cities are so small it was hard to find anything. The nice thing about the kumano kodo website is they have contracts with private homes and have more options available. \n\nI chose the Nakahechi because it fits my itinerary for the rest of my trip and the 3 major shrines plus the traditional boat ride interest me. I chose September because I\u2019m hoping it will be less crowded than the spring so I\u2019m not too helpful there. \n\nI hope this helped a bit! I also had a hard time finding information on this hike, I\u2019ve been researching it for over a year now. Check out the website and see if they have a model itinerary that fits your trip",

I saw that a lot of lodgings for our dates were not able to be booked. I reached out to the Kumano Travel office who let me know that we were too early and that we needed to wait for lodgings to provide their 2024 availability. So you still probably have time before you need to or are even able to book lodging! Will be excited to read your trip report.",

            "comment": "I did part of the Nakahechi trail this week following Kumano Travel\u2019s model itinerary Hongu to Nachi. You may want to do the whole route from Takijiri though which I think takes about 5 days. \n\nWe really enjoyed it. It probably helped that we had perfect hiking weather and also we like walking through forest. If you hike for spectacular views then the Kumano Kodo doesn\u2019t have that so much - I can see that some people might find it a bit samey. However, it\u2019s very atmospheric, there are points of interest along the way including the temples and lots of little shrines and the history is interesting. It\u2019s also really nice to get out into the Japanese countryside and spend some time in smaller towns and villages. \n\nWe booked our accommodation about 4 months in advance mostly though Kumano Travel (which I would recommend). I would really recommend staying at Kumaano Farm &amp; Guesthouse in Koguchi. You get a little cottage to yourself with an amazing outdoor bath overlooking the river. The couple who run it are really friendly and cool you dinner using organic rice and vegetables that they grow themselves. \n\nThe Kumano Kodo trail is not the place to see cherry blossom. I believe the trees are mostly cedar and cypress. You may see a few cherry blossom trees on the way but it wouldn\u2019t be a focus. I think that would be a relatively busy time to walk but I don\u2019t think the trail ever gets that busy because there is limited accommodation along the way which restricts numbers. \n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "Hi all,\n\nI just finished the kohechi trail. In my experience, it's a nice hike over 3 mountain passes each over 1000m high. Average elevation gains are around 700-900m per day. Mostly through woods and some road walk. If you go with nice weather, it should be perfectly fine. I booked accommodation 3 days in advance, and had no problem (even over the weekend). The trail is very quiet, over the course of 4 days we only met 3 other hikers. Which were mostly day hikers. If you book with accomodation, you can just go with a daypack, they will provide dinner and breakfast and a lunch on the go (which for me was a super nice bento box!).\n\nI'm an experienced hiker with several long distance hikes this year. For me, it was pretty easy. But if your not really fit, it can be a challenge. \nHope this helps.",

I booked all my accommodation with lunch boxes as well so I shouldn't need to carry food other than for lunch. I'm fit and used to hiking. Did you find the Kumano Travel time estimates accurate? Did you have any difficulty on the hikes that you didn't experience on other long distance hikes?",

I think the shorter distance you are noting is the bit that is acknowledged as part of the dual pilgrimage, but I would recommend doing the full route if you have the 4-5 days to complete it. I\u2019m happy to send you my full itinerary if you\u2019re interested! But I very much enjoyed the hike and it was enough of a challenge but not too extreme.\n\nI booked around 6 weeks in advance and walked in mid March, which was still quiet as it was just before the peak period. But I don\u2019t think the trails will ever be too busy as accommodation is fairly limited, most of the crowds were at the big shrines. Happy to answer more questions!",

    "postText": "Hello. Me and my family are traveling to Japan from Sept 22-Oct17 as first timers (5 adults including 2 seniors). We are hoping to cover as many cultural and historic sites as we can while not losing chance to see unique landscapes for photography (just a hobbyist, not a pro). My itinerary appears busy so when our elderlies get tired, I would be doing some explorations on my own.  I have to choose between Nachi Falls or Kiso Valley as a day trip from Nagoya on our D3, if anybody has any idea which is worthier of travel time, I'd take recommendations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Sept 23 **D1**: **ARRIVAL** at Narita at 1740 (exchange JR pass/ get Suica cards) . Check in Hotel.\n\n\\*Sept 24 **D2**: **TOKYO**\\- Visit Tsukiji Market , Ginza, Kabuki Theatre, TokyoTower,Sunset at  Roponggi Observation Deck\n\n\\*Sept 25 **D3**: **TOKYO-&gt;NAGOYA-&gt; NACHI FALLS-&gt;NAGOYA** Join a day trip at 0700 in Nagoya to Kumano Nachi Taisha/ Nachi Falls then back to Nagoya for overnight or\n\n**TOKYO-&gt;NAGOYA-&gt;KISO VALLEY-&gt; NAGOYA**  I really want to capture the old town street of Magome or Tsumago with the mountains as the backdrop\n\n\\*Sept 26 **D4** **NAGOYA-&gt; KAMAKURA -&gt; TOKYO** ( Kotoku-In, Hasedera, Hokokuji, Kenchoji, Enoshima Island)\n\n\\*Sept 27 **D5** **TOKYO -&gt; NIKKO ( Day Trip)**  (Visit Shinkyo Bridge, Nikko Toshogu, Kegon Falls, Lake Chuzenji)\n\n\\*Sept 28 **D6** **TOKYO**  Visit 1.)

We'll arrive at Fuji at night and spend the next 2 nights there. Is it ok to spend the sunset in Hakone? Or should we leave for Fuji before night time?\n\n\\*Oct 1 **D9** **FUJIKAWAGUCHIKO** Sunrise at Lake Kawaguchi, Chureito Pagoda, Mt Tenjo's Ropeway, FujiQ Theme Park, Oshino Hakkai. Sunset at Lake Kawaguchi\n\n\\*Oct 2 **D10** **FUJI Check out -&gt; TOKYO -&gt; KYOTO Check In** We are going to head back to Tokyo Station to grab our luggages then make our way to Kyoto.

Also Yasaka Shrine, NanzenJi, Philosopher's Path\n\n\\*Oct 5 **D13 KYOTO -&gt; HIMEJI CASTLE -&gt; KURASHIKI -&gt; KYOTO** In the morning we'll head out to Himeji and then Okayama. I want to see Kurashiki bec I am a big fan of the Rurouni Kenshin movies. We'll head back to Kyoto and get some time to relax in the evening.\n\n\\*Oct 6 **D14** **KYOTO Check out -&gt; HIROSHIMA/MIYAJIMA Check in** Early AM, we will head out to Hiroshima and visit Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park then go to Miyajima in the afternoon.

Late afternoon travel to Takayama.\n\n\\*Oct 9 **D17 TAKAYAMA** This is the highlight of our trip since we are going to see the Takayama Autumn Festival. This is regarded as one of the most beautiful matsuri's in Japan so we are stoked. We'll explore Takayama Jinya, Old Town, and Hida Folk Village as well. I believe they'll be doing a night parade of the yatais as well so that would be wonderful for photography.\n\n\\*Oct 10 **D18 TAKAYAMA -&gt; SHIRAKAWAGO -&gt; TAKAYAMA** We'll do a stroll at the morning market afterwards head on to Shirakawago and spend the rest of the afternoon there. \n\n\\*Oct 11 **D19** **TAKAYAMA Check out -&gt; OSAKA Check In** Since we are stopping by Nagoya for train switch, I am thinking of dropping by Ghibli Park. I heard it is massive but at least I want to visit the Grand Warehouse for a couple of hours. \n\n\\*Oct 12 **D20 OSAKA** We planned nothing else here but to check out Dotunburi. Maybe Osaka castle or the Umeda Sky as well and whatever temples we get to see. We'll do some shopping here as well.\n\n\\*Oct 13 **D21 OSAKA -&gt; NARA -&gt; OSAKA** Doing a day trip to Nara to visit TodaiJi temple and the Deer Park, Kasuga Taisha and KofukiJi temples.\n\n\\*Oct 14 **D22 OSAKA Check out -&gt; TOKYO Check in** Maybe a Kawagoe day trip since we dont have any plans for this day.\n\n\\*Oct 15 **D23 TOKYO -&gt; ATAMI -&gt; TOKYO**  It's Shinjuku Day!

Afterwards, take the train to Atami in Shizuoka and watch the Atami Fireworks Festival. \n\n\\*Oct 16 **D24 TOKYO** It's Shibuya Day! Stroll around the Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park. I want to look for a spot to capture the Shibuya crossing. I need to find where the Shiba Inu Cafe is as well, not sure if its here of Shinjuku. Planning to see the sunset in Shibuya Sky building. At night, maybe we'll do GoKart.\n\n\\*Oct 17 **D25 FLY OUT of NARITA**\\- Our flight is not until 1840 in the evening so maybe I'll go to Starbucks Roastery. And then do additional shopping if we still have time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow does this look? I am contemplating if we should do a 2night stay in Hiroshima because since I have such a tight schedule between Hiroshima/Miyajima and Kanazawa. I believe the travel time is at least 4.5hours. Also, If I buy the JR Pass soon, I don't have to pay extra for the price hike in October, do I?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "You should use Google maps to check travel times. Just because something looks close on a map, doesn't mean it's close by train.\n\nFor example,\n\nTOKYO-&gt;(2 hours)NAGOYA-&gt; (4.5 hours)NACHI FALLS-&gt; (4.5 hours)NAGOYA\n\nThat's 11 hours of train in one day. Also, the last train is 4:24pm from Nachi. So, if you board the train at Tokyo at 7am, you get to Nagoya at 9:30am, spend 30 mins dropping off your stuff at your hotel, and you have to board at 10:01am for Nachi. That gives you a whole 1.5 hours in Nachi, so you can take the last train back. 11 hours of train for 1.5 hours in the place you actually want to go.\n\nTOKYO-&gt;(2 hours)NAGOYA-&gt;(2 hours)KISO VALLEY-&gt; (2 hours)NAGOYA\n\nKYOTO -&gt;(1 hour) HIMEJI CASTLE -&gt;(2 hours) KURASHIKI -&gt;(2 hours) KYOTO\n\nTOKYO -&gt;(2 hours) ATAMI -&gt;(2 hours) TOKYO  (four hours on the train just to see fireworks?)\n\nAnd most of these times are using the shinkansen which is expensive if you don't have a JR Pass. But, your trip is so spread out, I'm not sure you can get your money's worth for a JR Pass.\n\nAlso, what's in Nagoya that you want to see so bad? It appears as if you want to make it a base camp but, it's far away from the places you actually want to see.",

You're right, it will serve as the middle ground for those side trips since there is no direct trip from Tokyo to either Kiso or Nachi Falls. I forgot to put in there the day trip to Nachi is from Klook, my bad, and basically, they're bringing us to Nachi Falls via private transport to cut the hours to 3hrs instead. So, 7am meet up in Nagoya and tentative arrival to Nachi at 10am and estimated drop off to Nagoya at 1900 (so maybe a decent 4 or 5hrs in Nachi).\n\nAnd yes, we are definitely planning on buying 21 day JR pass.",

I just checked, the first shinkansen from Shinagawa station to Nagoya is at 6:00am and arrives at 7:27am. You will miss the meet up time in Nagoya. Not to mention how much of a pain it would be to wake up before 4am-ish to get ready, check out (if it's even possible) and get to Shinagawa station.",

I haven't visited all of them, but I'd recommend the Sannomiya area and the Nada sake distillery zone.\n\nIf you can get a reservation at any of the Mouriya restaurants, that's where I'd go for the fancy wagyu experience (if you're into that sort of thing). I love the curry bread at Koln bakery and Mahisa Tea Room is a great place to take a break. Bar Murozumi is one of the best bars I've ever been to. All of these places are around the Sannomiya Station.\n\nIf you're into sake, there's a great little distillery area that includes at least one really great (free) museum that shows the traditional brewing methods. We were really impressed with the 1920s video footage they had in the museum at Hakutsuru. There's a nice description of the area [here](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3556.html), including a map, and it's very walkable.\n\nThe waterfront area has a lot of newer attractions and also an area that shows the damage from the 1997 earthquake. We didn't spend much time there since there wasn't much uniquely \"Kobeish\" about this area. Similarly, I'd steer you away from Chinatown because it's just so-so (although I've lived in SF so other Chinatowns are tough to compare).",

March-April data is just not available yet. Overtourism was already a topic in 2019 as the number of foreign tourist was just increasing year over year with no sign of slowing down.\n\nI am not saying that there is not a lot of people right now, just saying that there is likely not more than there have been pre covid.\n\nThe thing that the data does not show is where people are going. It is not impossible that more people stay in the touristic area of the top cities and you noticed it more.\n\nI am in Japan since early March and I spent weeks barely seeing any foreigners, but I am also not spending all my time in the big cities where all the first time visitor go. But yes as soon as you set foot in the touristy area of the top visited cities, like Hiroshima, you get in a sea of foreign tourist.",

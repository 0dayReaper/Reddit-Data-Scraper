    "postText": "Hey. Hi. Hello. So apparently food doesn't count in terms of sightseeing, so my first couple attempts at posting this have gotten removed. My main focus on this trip \\*is\\* food, but I've done my best to include other cultural/entertainment things. Fingers crossed.\n\nThis is pretty long and rambling because I\u2019m terrible at editing, but I appreciate your time and input. I guess I'm mostly asking for recommendations for blank spots and while we tried to not plan too much in any one day to allow for the unexpected, if anything looks super off, please do let me know. Thanks in advance.\n\nA few notes:\n\n\\-I\u2019m a chef, so a lot of the food choices are based around specific \u201cchef-y\u201d reasons. That said, I am entirely open to almost anything, as long as it is good. Other than listed restaurants, most of our food choices are going to be either trying random things at conbini or just going to a place that looks good/popular. Any and all suggestions are appreciated.\n\n\\-please PLEASE give me specific recommendations for candy/snacks/drinks, etc. to try. I can\u2019t read Japanese, so other than brands I already know, I\u2019m going to be completely guessing when it comes to trying new things.\n\n\\-It seems that many people here focus a lot of their dining options on ramen. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a palate preference or cost thing, etc. but we\u2019re more interested in things like okonomiyaki, yakitori, sushi, etc. As always though, if there is a spot (ramen or otherwise) you would highly suggest, hit me with it. I\u2019m super down for some solid tsukemen or tonkotsu.\n\n\\-We don't eat breakfast and lunch is usually light and random, so we currently mostly plan to just eat when/where the occasion arises. For example, bento on the train, random snacks (like the cheesy 10 Yen coin pancakes), standing sushi, Gyukatsu Motomura, etc.\n\n\\-We\u2019ve both been trying rather unsuccessfully to get a reservation at the Kirby Cafe, but aren\u2019t banking on it happening. We both check multiple times a day for any cancellations, so it would be nice, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna happen.\n\n\\-If it's convenient, I'd like to visit a Costco while I'm in Japan. It's not a super high priority, so I left it off the itinerary. I think it would be easy enough to fit into a day where not much else is going on.\n\nSome questions:\n\n\\-I don\u2019t know if it is considered omiyage or not, but would it be weird if I brought small American candy to give to people? I just enjoy giving random gifts, so it\u2019s not so much about trying to fit in or be cool, I just think giving people things they can\u2019t get is a fun thing to do. I don\u2019t want to freak people out though.  \n\\-I wear baseball caps a lot. Like easily 95%+ of the time. Will this matter in most places?\n\n\\-Should we bother doing any tours? We\u2019ve enjoyed these in other countries (Amsterdam bike tour was awesome), but I wonder if just exploring and eating random things is good enough or if a guided tour of some kind would be worth it.\n\n\\-From what I can tell, sumo matches are pretty seasonal and it looks like we just missed one tournament and the next isn't until after we leave - Can anyone confirm this?  \nBasic info\n\n\\-39M/34F  \n\\-trip duration: technically 18 days  \n\\-places to visit: Tokyo, Kanazawa, Kaga, Echizen (maybe), Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai, Nara, Kobe  \n\\-level of Japanese comprehension: almost none. I can order sushi in Japanese (mostly because of my career. I know most products by their native names as well as the English name). But I can\u2019t read, speak, or understand spoken Japanese at all outside of 5-6 words.\n\nPre-Trip  \n\\-fill out Visit Japan Web forms to expedite customs/entry  \n\\-download Deepl, Google Lens, have Translate ready to, etc,  \n\\-download Suica app/add Suica to Apple Wallet\n\\-get esim from Ubigi\n\n04/30 Day 0  \nSAN FRANCISCO  \n\\-fly to NRT\n\n05/01 Day 1  \nTOKYO  \n\\-land at NRT around 1:55PM  \n\\-get cash\n\\-train to hotel  \n\\-go to sento to relax  \n\\-general exploring as much as our energy will allow  \n\\-dinner: probably 7-11, Lawson or Family Mart - fried chicken, egg salad sando, tuna mayo\n\\-accommodation: Hyatt Centric Ginza\n\n05/02 Day 2  \nTOKYO  \n\\-Asakusa (explore + rickshaw tour)  \n\\-Shibuya Sky (have sunset reservation)  \n\\-dinner: yakitori alley/memory lane//piss alley (any tips/recommendations? just pop into any shop with open seats?)  \n\\-accommodation: Hyatt Centric Ginza\n\n05/03 Day 3  \nTOKYO  \n\\-Planet Labs (have a reservation)  \n\\-Kappabashi  \n\\-dinner: Butagumi (have a reservation)  \n\\-accommodation: Hyatt Centric Ginza\n\n05/04 Day 4  \nTOKYO  \n\\-Mt.

The room, with a long bench that seats maybe 8 or 10 is very stark but beautiful, with a gorgeous garden. There was only one other guest - a clearly very wealthy businessman doing his regular Saturday lunch there. Service was charming. The food was excellent - magnificent ingredients, usually treated (perhaps deceptively) simply, bursting with flavour. I was a very happy man afterwards. Definitely planning on going back there for dinner next time I am in Kyoto.\n\nHappy to message you pics of the food in chat if that would assist.",

            "comment": "Firstly, love your accommodation choices. Beniya Mukayu is bucket list for me. Andaz Tokyo is one of my favourite places to stay - definitely build in time to enjoy their awesome pool, jacuzzis and hot baths, it\u2019s heaven after a long day. They also have a neat little free cocktail hour which nice. If this matters to you at all, it might be worth asking if you can have a room with an obstructed view ahead of time - a few towers have gone up in the vicinity since they built that complex. Their concierge team have been great about food recommendations and bookings too. \n\nFor your Tokyo food choices, you can stick your head in depending on the alley you end up in but this list could help: https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/restaurants/where-to-eat-at-omoide-yokocho-in-shinjuku\n\nBirdland isn\u2019t an overlap with the above - it\u2019s much more refined than what you\u2019d find, so I\u2019d still go with it if I were you. They also have an outlet in the Toranomon Yokocho that just opened up if you\u2019re having reservation difficulties. \n\nMy best nodoguro bite was at Taheizushi in Kanazawa. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened with the place since the lovely old chef passed away but heard it\u2019s been passed into good hands. It does require a taxi there and back though. \n\nRe: tours: Yukari Sakamoto does some food tours in Tokyo that could be great for you considering your background. You could also get in touch with Curated Kyoto if there\u2019s anything you want to dig into in terms of food culture there.",

            "comment": "You are staying at good hotels, so I would lean on the Concierge a little bit to makes some reservations for you. \n\nI'm fairly well versed in the culinary scene in Osaka, Kyoto, Kanazawa, Toyama and Hokkaido. I'll try to provide recommendations across the board though my focus tends to be high end dining. \n\nJapan is the best place in the world eschew places like Joel Robuchon as the high end dining culture runs deep. \n\nYou noted that you want to try Nodoguro. The range for Nodoguro tends to be from on the sea of Japan side from Nagasaki prefecture to Toyama, though Kanazawa tends to be the most famous for its Nodoguro. Should you make a booking at a restaurant you can always specifically request a item you would like to have served, though this tends to be a service more often provided to regulars, restuarants will often meet the request if they can get their hands on good quality Nodoguro. Across Japan the four best places I've eat Nodoguro at are: \n\n1. Zeniya in Kanazawa - this place in general has amazing cuisine though the interior feels a little dated. [https://goo.gl/maps/E4bmk8vCLPrN46Ky5](https://goo.gl/maps/E4bmk8vCLPrN46Ky5)\n\n2. Ichiyo in Osaka - This place also has great quality Osaka style Japanese cuisine. [https://goo.gl/maps/rSJYvSxPJCb3UKfa7](https://goo.gl/maps/rSJYvSxPJCb3UKfa7)\n\n3. Nakashima - A little out of the way from the places your are staying, this restaurant is also one of the cheapest three starred Michelin restaurants in the world. I always tried to eat there whenever I'm in Hiroshima. It also had the best tasting Nodoguro of the three. [https://goo.gl/maps/ZAzrAbE66yccxLfB9](https://goo.gl/maps/ZAzrAbE66yccxLfB9)\n\n4. Ebitei Bekkan - More on this restaurant below. \n\nRestaurants a little out of the way but worth the trip - \n\nL'evo - This chef build his restaurant in an abandoned village, almost every ingredient is sourced locally from within Toyama prefecture. He has his own organic garden managed by a women with a PHD in agriculture from the university of Tokyo. He is also a master forager. His knowledge of the local fauna is incredible and the food is amazing.  It is a bit of a hike to get to however. [https://goo.gl/maps/zfgqXug7opLTA9v3A](https://goo.gl/maps/zfgqXug7opLTA9v3A)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEbitei Bekkan - The Chef here is the fourth generation chef of a Ryotei whose history runs back to the Edo period. He previously recieved two Michelin stars, but still did feel that his skills were good enough. He subsequently spent 5 years at top restaurants across Japan honing his skills. The restaurant only recently reopened this past winter in a new building, but the food is amazing and half the price of what one would pay for a similar meal in Tokyo. Also focuses on almost completely local sourcing for ingredients.The Nodoguro here is also amazing. Worth it to take Shinkansen to and from Kanazawa. [https://goo.gl/maps/x5i6GRGXDAHyhx6KA](https://goo.gl/maps/x5i6GRGXDAHyhx6KA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeniya Mukayu is good. But a couple of things are evident. It used to be a very typical Ryokan that went through an extensive renovation, some of the bones of its less impressive past are still visible however. The food wasn't all the memorable and I found the atmosphere of the main dining room to not be quite up to par with other ryokan of a similar price range. The rooms are great though. Nearby Araya Totoan is my favorite in the Kaga region. If you enjoy a retreat with a modern vibe, River Retreat Garaku is also very good with larger rooms and much better dining.\n\nNear Beniya Mukayu is a restaurant called Kame Sushi, it is a great place to eat Nodoguro/Sushi for Lunch. Reservations are required. [https://goo.gl/maps/Sd5vBNMzX6wP9Enn7](https://goo.gl/maps/Sd5vBNMzX6wP9Enn7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOsaka Food recs: \n\nIn the city for snacks of any kind I would recommend going to a Depachika, Depachika are the food areas in the bottom of department stores like Daimaru. Very good quality snacks and bentos of every kind. \n\nEating Takoyaki and Kushikatsu are a must in Osaka. There are plenty of Takoyaki places on dotonbori, though almost every station in the region has a takoyaki stand nearby with prices half that of Dotonbor. Shin-Sekai is the place to try Kushikatsu. Though it is a little warm when you are visiting, Osaka is also known for its Oden. Hanakujira is the most famous [https://goo.gl/maps/fkgtYoKb336PugbX7](https://goo.gl/maps/fkgtYoKb336PugbX7)\n\nStand Fuji in Tennoji is my go to Izakaya, it can be hard to navigate if you don't understand Japanese though as the place is a little hectic. [https://goo.gl/maps/capdUu2uufEBEWgk7](https://goo.gl/maps/capdUu2uufEBEWgk7)\n\nRentaro has good sushi at a decent price [https://goo.gl/maps/yuRxk3EeuwPABZnZ6](https://goo.gl/maps/yuRxk3EeuwPABZnZ6)\n\nNakashima is a great place to experience a modern take on Japanese cuisine. Reservation are needed as there are only 6 seats. Close to Hanakujira.  [https://goo.gl/maps/m3HyeBVm8s6Cop7w7](https://goo.gl/maps/m3HyeBVm8s6Cop7w7)\n\nKyoto \n\nSobaya Nicora - Great soba in a renovated Machiya [https://goo.gl/maps/jK8bX5GQNK9n6XNo6](https://goo.gl/maps/jK8bX5GQNK9n6XNo6)\n\nPanel Cafe - Great Matcha Mochi Daifuku Pancake [https://goo.gl/maps/euvJ62i29UWBNbbm9](https://goo.gl/maps/euvJ62i29UWBNbbm9)\n\nSpicy -Classic Curry House [https://goo.gl/maps/eVj9YZJh1WX1RFUXA](https://goo.gl/maps/eVj9YZJh1WX1RFUXA)\n\nArtisan Halles - Great Bakery [https://goo.gl/maps/D6qiRks178HzaFxr5](https://goo.gl/maps/D6qiRks178HzaFxr5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor Costco, no places except Hiroshima have a Costco that is accessible without a car.

I have traveled to Japan 5+ times and the only times I got Japanese striking up a conversation with me were 1) anime themed cafe where I was seated with another person who also went to the cafe alone, 2) on the train to KIX with two suitcases (obvious tourist) and this ossan asked if he could practice English with me. Do you give out candies randomly in US too?? Whenever I'm handed something by strangers, I personally will smile, thank you and throw it out afterwards to be honest. \n\nFor USJ we made a reservation at Saido, which is currently running a themed cafe for Jujutsu Kaisen, but the food itself looked very good too. If you don't have meal planned for the day you can give it a try.",

From there you can easily get a cab to your hotel.\n\nThe only reason you need the suica app is if you want to know the full number on your apple wallet suica for linking it to shinkansen tickets. If you have an iPhone you can create a suica directly to apple wallet without the app.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t getting a JR pass you should download the SmartEx app and set up an account before you leave in case you want to use it to book shinkansen tickets",

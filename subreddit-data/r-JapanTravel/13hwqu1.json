I've always wanted to go to japan since I was actually born there, but moved to America at 5 years old. I'm interested in anime, Japanese life, food, the usual, and my main focus is really to just sight see and experience Tokyo and Japan again.\nI've planned some days out below, but I expect this list to be flexible and change when I'm actually there\n# Day 1\n- Arrive to Japan, check in to hotel ~3:00 pm, explore area around hotel, rest\n\n# Day 2\n- Harajuku\n- Meiji Shrine\n- Shibuya\n\n# Day 3\n- Asakusa - visit the temple and explore streets\n- Nakamise street\n- Taito Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center for observation view\n- Senso-ji\n\n# Day 4\n- Akihabara\n- Teamlabs Planets\n- Rainbow Bridge\n- Odaiba\n\n# Day 5\n- Shimokitazawa (here b/c Bocchi the Rock)\n- Ueno park\n- Shinjuku\n\n# Day 6\n- Hakone Ryokan and onsen\n\n# Day 7\n- Visit hometown in Yoshikawa and meet mom's friends in Saitama and stay over\n\n# Day 8\n- Leave japan\nI don't have too many specific things that I'd want to do yet, but I think these are the areas that i'd at least like to spend a decent amount of time in\n# Questions\n- Is one week enough to squeeze in a stay at a Hakone ryokan? \n- Are there any restaurants worth making a reservation? I like finding good restaurants to eat at when I travel but I think this time I'll just find whatever on the street and go there\n- Are summer festivals still going on in September? I don't imagine they still are but if any other events going on I'd like to go\n\nAny advice on if this schedule is realistic or if things could be moved around would be appreciated",

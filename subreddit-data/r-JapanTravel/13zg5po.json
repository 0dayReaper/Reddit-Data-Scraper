            "comment": "1. No (see 2)\n\n2. Yes you are trying to fit in too much, and I consider myself a very fast traveler. If the priority is Sakura, then Shirakawago and Takayama are a waste of time because they bloom quite a bit later than Kyoto or Osaka. In fact, you are choosing possibly the worst time to visit Shirakawago since it is before trees have leaves/color but after the snow has melted, so it is just barren branches (and tourist oriented shops) everywhere.\n\n3. If you delete Shirakawago and Takayama, it becomes more economical to do a combination of internal flights (Hiroshima-Tokyo especially if you are using Narita) + JR West regional pass + advanced purchase tickets. \n\n4. Consult a Japanese website (I use hanami.walkerplus.com) for more ideas of famous cherry blossoms sights.\n\n5. You vastly underestimate the time taken to travel from place to place. Between Day 6 to Day 7 it takes several hours from Takayama to Kyoto (the direct train is once daily in the afternoon); on Day 8 many of these places are not within walking distance of one another and the buses will be incredibly crowded so you'll have to splurge on taxis.",

            "comment": "March 27 is not feasible. I suggest that you plan out your days on a map, play around with transit options and then see what you can do. If you plan to go up and down Fushimi Inari, are you really willing to then walk entire philosophers path? This doesn\u2019t taken into account any transit hurdles.\n\nWhy not do Fushimi Inari and then go to Nara the same day. She philosophers path for another day. \n\nDay 5 - will be a long day. And, you are missing out on higashi chaya district, samurai district. It is already a packed day. Maybe worth cutting some spots out and doing 2 day in Kanazawa.",

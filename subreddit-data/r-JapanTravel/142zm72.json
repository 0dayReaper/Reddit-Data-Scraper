If you remove sensoji then there is not a lot happening on this day\n\nAlso, if you activate the JR pass on Day 4 you need to be back in Tokyo on Day 10 as it goes by calendar days (a 14 day pass does not make sense for you).",

Also, if you like animals, walk up the mountain where the monkeys are. \n\nSince you\u2019re doing Fushimi Inari on the same day, I recommend going at the crack of dawn - trust me so worth it! You\u2019ll get the place to yourself and enjoy a tranquil walk when it\u2019s not too hot too. Will leave you plenty of time to explore Arashiyama.",

            "comment": "Day 3 - on the way between Sensoji and Ueno check out Kappabashi - rather authentic kitchenware shopping area. Has great shops for traditional knives and ceramics and some fun kitchen gadgets.\n\nDay 8 - Kobe is rather meh. Unless you have specific interests there. I would rather go to Himeji (castle), Hiroshima, Miyajima (if you start early).\n\nDay 10 - I would do Higashiyama in Kyoto. Try some big temples, try some small random temples, stroll in Gion, Yasaka and Pontocho at night. \n\nDay 13 - I would do a day trip somewhere else that has less of an urban vibe. Yokohama and Kawasaki are very industrial, similar to Tokyo. Some nice things to do, but not the best around Tokyo in my opinion.\n\nI would suggest to rather go to Hakone, Kamakura. Nikko is possible while slightly tight in one day. Okutama, Takao are decent natural areas in Tokyo if you want something different. Kusatsu if you want multiple traditional very hot hot springs. \n\nIf you do hiking, Tanigawa is extremely nice, Tanzawa as the second best day hiking option.",

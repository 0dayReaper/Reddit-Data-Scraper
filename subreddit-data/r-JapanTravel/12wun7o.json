    "postText": "Hi everyone, 28M first time solo traveller here from Canada looking to experience a different way of life for a few weeks. I'm really interested in food, anime (Attack on Titan, Spy X Family, Boruto, Bleach, Code Geass, Gundam,etc...), sightseeing, skating and sports in general. I posted a few months ago and have finalized my itinerary based on your feedback and wanted one final check. I\u2019ve broken everything down by business hours and how long I plan to stay at each place.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n* I currently have a Day Trip to Osaka planned which I think I should perhaps change to something closer to Tokyo. What do you think?\n* Would there be any value in visiting some of these shrines at night-time?\n* My April 29 day (Teamlab planets) would probably make more sense to be placed on the final leg of my trip when I\u2019m staying near Tokyo Station (as opposed to Shinjuku). My rationale was avoiding some of the golden week busyness. Is this a good idea?\n\nTokyo (April 27-May 2)\n\nApril 27th\n\n* Arrive at NRT 4:30pm\n   * Buy Suica card at airport\n* Take Keisei Limited Express from Narita Airport to Nippori Station.

Just be prepared you might not fit everything on your itinerary into your day.\n\nWhat exactly are you doing in Yokohama at 0830 when the stuff you noted don't even open until 10-11am? There aren't really much to see in Chinatown in the morning... And if you're from Canada like Vancouver/Toronto, I'd even just skip Yokohama Chinatown lol, or only look around and not bother with the food there. Did you factor in walking  / travel time?\n\nDo you like JJK? There's an exhibit in Yokohama there until May 8 and you can spend an hour there. \n\nCheck this out for anime collabs.  https://collabo-cafe.com/",

If you never had good Chinese food in your life then sure check out Yokohama Chinatown. Otherwise... Spend your money on local Japanese food lol.\n\nIt's not just about moving through places quickly... Tokyo streets can be confusing to navigate even with GPS, unlike Canada where most streets are # shaped and straightforward, Tokyo has a lot of little side streets. The railways are also quite complicated to first timers to navigate, I don't know if you googled that at all, like how there are multiple railway companies and lines, whereas Van/To is just one company.\n\nNakano Broadway itself is very easy to find but some other destinations are not. Nakano Broadway is also one of those places you need to take your time to find the stuff you want to buy, but if you're only browsing then yeah 2 hrs is doable.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! Just came back from my first trip to Japan. It has always been my biggest dream to visit Japan since I was a kid and I'm so glad I finally got the chance to go! The trip was actually planned by my boyfriend who booked everything for us in May, which is my birthday month. \n  \n\n  \n**Tips:**\n\n\n  \n***Make Reservations Months in Advance****!* We made reservations for cafes, activities, restaurants, and even trains months in advance to make sure we would be able to do everything we wanted; we were not taking any risks and we were so thankful for our reservations. Make sure to do your research about when to make reservations months in advance.\n\n\n  \n***Pack and Travel Light****.* Japan isn't really suited for traveling with big luggage to haul around. The trains can get incredibly crowded, you\u2019ll probably be walking around and using stairs frequently, and hotel rooms can be very small at times. I recommend bringing a small rolling luggage and a large backpack and only pack what you need. Leave some room in your luggage for souvenirs or snacks  to bring back.\n\n\n  \n***Get Yen immediately at the airport or at the nearest convenience store!*** You will definitely need yen for a good amount of places in Japan. My boyfriend and I tried to load money in our Suica but the machine we used only accepted yen. Luckily we found a nearby conbini that accepted our debit card but we couldn't use our credit cards for some reason because the atm required a pin number. I might have accepted Mastercard but we both didn't have one.\n\n\n  \n***Bringing comfortable shoes is a must in Japan!*** I brought comfortable shoes and my feet still hurt by the third day because we were walking and standing most of the days. I also recommend buying Lion\u2019s Foot Patch if you find it at a conbini (I think we bought them at Lawsons) as the gel patch felt so good after a long day of walking!\n\n\n  \n***Plan more days to relax****.* Although I have no regrets doing all the fun things we planned for our trip, I do wish we had more rest days in Japan, especially when our feet were so sore and we were so sleep deprived from waking up early. I wish we would have stayed a full 2 weeks in Japan and planned relaxing things to do in between our activities like visiting an Onsen and staying in a Ryokan.\n\n\n  \n***Get to popular places early*****!** My boyfriend and I would wake up at 5am to get ready and beat the morning rush hour and to get to popular places before the crowds showed up, it definitely worked out well for us.\n\n\n  \n***Use hotel luggage transport or lockers when necessary*****.** The luggage transport was especially useful when traveling long distances and carrying luggage through the trains would just be a hassle. All we had to do was just talk to our hotel clerk and give him the information for our next hotel we would be sending it to, and the clerk did the rest of  the work. The luggage would usually arrive 2 days after we sent it. For the rest of the time, we just used lockers at train stations to store our luggage as we went sightseeing.\n\n\n  \n**Trip Report:**\n\n\n  \n\n**Sunday May 14: Arrival and TokyoDisney**\n  \n***Arrival at Narita Airport***\n  \nArrival was simple, fast, and easy. For immigration and customs, we just had to scan our QR codes and passport and also take a picture. \n  \n\n***Yen situation***\n  \nAs we arrived at Disney by bus, we wanted to use the coin lockers to store our luggage. The lockers only took suica (maybe yen too) so we tried to buy a suica but the machines only took yen (it didn't look like it took foreign cards). We tried walking to  7/11but it was closed so we ended up just walking to our hotel to drop off luggage. We ended up spending more than an hour walking everywhere and only had 2 hours for Disney.\n  \n***Tokyo Disney*** \n  \nThe only ride we had time for was the beauty and the beast ride and it was amazing! We loved our experience inside the castle and we were amazed how fluid the animatronics were. If I could recommend one ride in Disney it would be this one. We did have time to go on one more ride so we went on the Monsters Inc ride which was just a shooter game and was just okay.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n**Monday May 15: Tokyo- DisneySea**\n  \n\nBefore  we went to disneysea, we wanted to try some convenience store food so we went to Lawsons and Family Mart. The convenience store food was delicious! The onigiri tastes better than the ones in the US, the chicken in the hot food section was so juicy and delicious! Definitely recommend eating the hot foods and drinks. We tried getting money out of the ATM with our Visa credit cards but it didnt work so we used our debit card because the atm required a pin number.\n  \n\n  \n***Tokyo Disneysea***\n\nWe arrived at Disneysea almost an hour early and we still had to wait in line. After the gates opened, we went straight to Journey to the Center of the Earth, but it broke down before we were able to ride it. The staff did offer us a fast pass to use for  the ride later when it would be fixed. When the ride was working again, we headed back, used the fast pass and immediately got on the ride. It was a fun. fast, and short ride. All the rides at disneysea are pretty short and are moderately thrilling. Afterwards, we went to the submarine ride, 20,000 leagues under the sea, which was a unique experience and a very chill ride. Next was the Indiana jones ride; it was fun and a much better ride than the one in california. Then we went to Tower of terror which wasn't too scary. We also went to Soaring which actually has really long lines and wait time but it was a cool experience. The ride with the longest line was probably toy story mania; we decided not to go on the ride because of the long lines and we've been to the one in california. Kings triton castle was the most beautiful area to look at and explore, our favorite part of the area was exploring ariel's trinket room. Lots of rides were closed the day we went so we didnt get to ride on the\n spirits roller coaster, autopia, and explorers. My favorite food i tried there was the Ukiwa bun.\n  \n\n  \nWe also got to eat at Magellan which is one of the more expensive dining options. We didn't make a reservation until that very same day but we luckily able to reserve a spot in the morning. The food was tasty and it was my first time going to a fancier kind of restaurant that offered 3 course meal that were all tiny portions. I got the cheaper option (around $40 or $60, i cant remember)  and  it was very delicious. My boyfriend got the most expensive option (around $100) and it tasted terrible! I wouldnt recommend getting the most expensive option there.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n**Tuesday May 16:  Tokyo-Harajuku**\n  \n***Harajuku***\n  \nWe took the trains to get to Harajuku and it was a little overwhelming trying to figure out how to find our train the first few times but, after a while, it became a very easy process. We used google maps to find the trains we needed to take. Then at the train stations, we looked for signs with the name of the train line we needed and followed the arrows and asked for directions when we needed extra help. Then we used our suica card to  tap into the specific station we needed to be at to find our train. Next we looked for the PLATFORM NUMBER our train would be arriving at and followed the signs for that number. Once at the platform, we confirmed if we were at the right place by making sure  the ARRIVAL TIME, PLATFORM NUMBER, and TRAIN LINE on the digital signs matched the one from our google maps. Make sure to follow train etiquette by stepping to the side to let people out of the train and putting your backpack in front of you if the train is really crowded.\n  \nAt Harajuku station, we put our luggage in coin lockers for the day so we could explore. We went to a conbini, grabbed some food for breakfast and went to **Yoyogi park** to eat since nothing was open at 7am. After eating, we went to **Meiji shrine** for a bit, which is also near yoyogi park, and then headed back to harajuku so we wouldn't be late for our mipig reservations.\n\n **Mipig cafe** was our favorite cafe and one of our favorite experiences in japan! The pigs were so loving and friendly, they came right up to us and laid on our laps after the staff put some blankets on us. They were adorable and as many as 2-3 pigs would come up to us and sit on our laps. Some pigs would even get aggressive with other piggies if you gave one too much attention. Some pigs started chewing on my dress so I had to get another blanket to hide my dress from being eaten.\n  \nAfter Mipig, we wanted to get some food. We tried Marian crepes, candied strawberries, and some small cafes. We visited **Anakuma cafe** and it was definitely an interesting experience. A bear hand  would come out of hole in the wall and give us candy and a coin to put in a gacha machine and it would also play rock paper scissor with us.\n  \nNext stop was **Hedgehog cafe** which i wouldnt recommend only because I learned later that hedgehogs are nocturnal and they were sleeping most of the time we were there. We ended up leaving early because there was not much to do as we felt bad disturbing the little guys.\n  \nAfterwards we visited the **Kiddyland** store and I enjoyed the **studio ghibli** section but they also had kirby, pokemon, and sanrio merchandise.\n  \n***Teamlabs***\n  \nNext we took a train to **team labs**, we got there early but we had to wait until it was closer to our  reservation time before we could line up. After getting inside we had to put our shoes and backpacks in lockers so we could go through the water exhibition first. They offer shorts if you are wearing dresses as some of the exhibitions have mirror floors. I wasnt too into the water exhibition but I did like the lights exhibition and flower exhibition the best. Overall it was a cool experience and I got some amazing photos out of it.\n  \n***Shibuya sky***\n  \nLastly we went to shibuya sky. We also couldn't get inside until our reservation time started. The elevator ride up was pretty cool as they played a video on the ceiling. They have some restaurants and cafes near the top, I wish I came earlier to try them but we were so tired I didnt want to stay too long. The top of shibuya sky was outside and it was cold  (i wish i brought a sweater) but it was incredibly beautiful, especially at night. It's a nice place to relax and look at views. This was probably my favorite sky building out of the three i went (shibuya sky, umeda sky, and tokyo skytree).\n\n\n  \n**Wednesday May 17: Nagoya-Ghibli Park**\n  \n***Ghibli park***\n  \nWe left early morning to get on the train and avoid morning rush hour. We ended up taking the Nozomi train to Nagoya. We bought our shinkansen tickets at the JR ticket booth. We recommend reserving seats  as its only a couple yen more and gives you peace of mind knowing you get to choose your seats. We also grabbed some ekibens which were delicious, my favorite was the blue one with mt. fuji on it. Next we had to take a bus to ghibli park which was actually very hard to find. We had to ask for help to find it. To pay for the bus, you can use a suica card or yen to pay as you board the bus.\n  \nWe arrived super early, and put some of our bags in the lockers. We went to lawsons nearby and bought a ghibli park book which features the exhibitions inside. We walked around the park a bit before we were allowed to start lining up for our reservation times. There are also no trash cans at ghibli park so make sure you bring a trash bag with you to take all your trash back with you.\n  \nAround 12pm we went inside and went straight to the first exhibition (Becoming characters in Memorable Ghibli scenes) and there was already a line to get in. Once we got in we took pictures with Noface from spirited away, ponyo, princess mononoke scene, and many more movie scenes. \n  \nThe next exhibition we went to was the food exhibition (Delicious! Animating Memorable Meals). You can't take pictures in that area but it was cool to be able to interact in the kitchen spaces from your favorite movie scenes. Also, in the end of this exhibition, you can take pictures with totoro and the cat bus!\n  \nWe visited the ghibli store next because I heard the lines can get rather long at the end of the day and I bought some merchandise from there.\n  \nAfterwards, we took pictures at the central staircase, the castle in the sky scene, and the scene with Yubaba.\n  \nNext, we took the elevator down to the bottom floor and took pictures in the arietty scenes, it was cool feeling so tiny while everything was supersized!\n  \nLastly we went to the bakery to get some sandwiches. Unfortunately, the food does sell out and there were not a lot of choices left by the time we got there. The food we got was okay but nothing special.\n  \n***Osaka:*** \n***Ichiran ramen***\n  \nAfter Ghibli park we took the train to Osaka. In Osaka, we lined up to get into Ichiran ramen. We ordered our ramen through a vending machine and it gave us our ticket to give to our server. We were seated in these small cubicle  areas but we were also able to close the partition in between us so my boyfriend and I could share our table space together. I thought it was a unique dining experience; it was cool not having to say a single word to our server, and the food was also delicious too.\n  \n\n\n  \n**Thursday May 18: Osaka-Universal Studios Japan**\n  \n\nGot to USJ an hour before it opened and there were still super long lines! As the gates opened up, we ran to nintendoland to make sure we got in. We went to toadstool cafe to get ticket reservations but they didn't open until 9am so we decided to take the single rider line for the mario kart ride, it was a bad idea. For some reason the single rider line still took us 30 minutes to complete and it felt like it was going slower than the regular lines. The mario kart ride was cool, it used like a VR headset and you were able to shoot shells at others but I really didn't understand what was going on.\n  \n***Toadstool cafe***\n  \nWe went back to toadstool but all the tickets were gone, I tried talking to one of the workers if they would offer tickets later but I don't think he understood what i was saying. He actually just let me in the line after I asked a few times if they had anymore tickets for the afternoon. After waiting in line and ordering, we grabbed our drinks and table number and sat down at our table. The drinks were delicious! Definitely recommend. We also ordered some kind of mushroom pesto soup and it was bomb! We recommend that too since they don't offer it in the California Universal. We also got peaches cake for like $30 which is supposed to be for 4 people but just the 2 of us ate it. It was light and fluffy and we recommend getting it as they also dont offer it in the California Universal. The staff also came by and offered to take pics of us which was so nice.\n  \nNext we bought the limited edition wrist bands and started playing some of the mini games. We played about 3 games before we decided to leave nintendo land and check out the other areas because we also bought a reserved time to get back into nintendoland to use our fastpass for the yoshi ride.\n  \nWe had a fastpass for the Jurassic park ride so we went on that next. Make sure you are prepared to get wet cause you will get soaked at the end. Then we went to Hogwarts and watched some of the shows they offered and grabbed a meatpie. We didn't stay long here as we have already been to Hogwarts in california. Next we got in line for the mario strawberry shortcake pancake and it was delicious light and fluffy! I think we also had a fastpass ride for jaws and that ride was actually really cooler than I expected . The next fastpass ride was for despicable me ride so we did that one too and it was actually better than the california version. And lastly we went back to nintendoland to use our reservation time and our fastpass for the yoshi ride. It was a cute slow ride but it had nice views of the park. I enjoyed it even though it was a kiddy ride. Lastly, we had the yakisoba shells and melon lassi and both were delicious\n  \n By this time our feet were so sore from walking for days so we left early to go rest at our hotel. I ended up being so sore and tired I just knocked out early. My boyfriend bought Lions Foot Patches from Lawson and put them on my feet while i slept. They felt so nice and cool on my feet. I recommed getting those foot patches while you're in japan.\n  \nWe woke up for a late dinner and got some nearby mcdonalds. I'm not a fan of mcdonalds in the US but i wanted to try japan's mcdonalds to see if its better. I honestly didn't like the Japan Mcdonalds either even though it does taste different, I'm not sure what the hype is about with the japanese mcdonalds. I found that japan's convenience store chicken was much juicer and tasted better than the mcdonalds chicken.\n\n\n  \n**Friday May 19: Kyoto-Fushimi Inari Taisha, Nishiki market, Ninenzaka**\n  \n***Fushimi inari taisha shrine***\n  \nWe got to the shrine early, maybe around 7am,and  it was not very crowded but there were still people there. It was raining a bit so luckily i brought my umbrella, unfortunately my boyfriend did not, this would haunt him later. We took a picture of a map to see which way to go to reach the top as there are different routes you can take. It was a gradual climb up but my boyfriend really struggled as his feet still hurt from the days before. The gates were beautiful and there were so many areas to look at and explore as we climbed. Unfortunately my boyfriend was tired and we were in a time crunch so we didn't explore every area but I wish I could have because this was the most beautiful place I had visited in Japan. As we neared the top it started to rain more heavily and my boyfriend ended up getting soaked. The top of the shrine was anticlimactic, but we took our picture and headed back down. On our way we stopped by the little stores and bought an umbrella for my boyfriend which we were thankful they had some. As we went down the steps in the rain, my boyfriend accidentally slipped and fell on his back pretty badly. He ended up with a deep gash on his finger as the blood gushed all over the floor. Luckily I had some tissues to wrap up his finger. We headed back down the mountain and bought some bandaids at a conbini store. We also bought some strawberry daifuku at a small little shop and it was the best daifuku I ate in Japan. The mochi was a great consistency and the strawberry was the juiciest strawberry i ever had. I wish i had bought more from there.\n  \n***Nishiki market***\n  \nWe went to Nishiki market around 11am and it was super crowded while the path was so small and narrow. We literally had to push through the crowds at times because there were so many people, it was not a fun time for me. I also ended up losing my suica card somewhere around there. I'm also not the biggest fan of seafood but my boyfriend is so he ended up eating most of the food. We ended up not staying long for all those reasons and ended up going to a nearby store that sold all kinds of different food which I liked a lot better because there weren't crowds of people there. \n  \n***Ninenzaka***\n  \nNext we walked to Ninenzaka which was like a 30 minute walk. It was still raining so we were just looking for a place to stop and eat for a bit. We went to Kudamono cafe and got the cloud dessert. It was pretty good and fluffy and the dessert looked so pretty. Afterwards, we had room for more dessert so we tried Maccha house. We ordered the matcha tiramisu and the parfait. The matcha tiramisu was probably the best dessert i had in Japan, I definitely recommend getting it! We also visited Donguri and bought more totoro merchandise. At this point, my boyfriend was so tired and soaked from the rain we decided to go back to the hotel. We took the bus this time and it was packed! We had to push people just to get out.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n**Saturday May 20: Kyoto, Nara, Osaka**\n  \n**Kyoto:**\n  \n***Arashiyama bamboo forest***\n  \nWe got to the bamboo forest early at 7am, there were a few people there but not too many like later in the day. I recommend going super early to beat the crowds. The bamboo forest was super short but it was still a cool area to check out and plus there are many things to do around the area. We walked to a nearby park next to a big river and the views were absolutely gorgeous! Kyoto is really breathtaking. After walking a while and checking out the scenery we headed back to the bamboo forest to board the Sagano Romantic Train.\n  \n***Sagano Romantic Train***\n  \nWe had reserved seats for the Sagano Romantic Train and the views from the train were amazing! Get there early because you might have to do some minor paperwork stuff to print out your ticket if you reserved in advance. The reserved seating we had was in a train with no glass windows so you can just feel the air rushing through your hair as the train moves. Truly it was a memorable and fun experience with a lot of breathtaking nature views. After coming back to our initial departure spot on the train, we left for Monkey Park.\n  \n***Monkey Park***\n  \nWe rushed over to Monkey park and by this time the streets of kyoto became much crowded as we had to dodge pedestrians left and right. We paid a fee to get into the monkey park and hiked our way up to the park, there were a couple benches to take rest if needed. At the top, you can see monkeys running around and playing with one another. We went inside a little building where you can buy food for the monkeys and feed them through windows covered with a mesh net. We didnt stay long as we had a full schedule planned for the day so we left to go catch a train to Nara but we did eat some amazing street food on the way. I don't know why but the street food in Kyoto was so delicious, the best I had in Japan probably.\n  \n\n  \n**Nara:**\n  \n***Nakatanidou***\n  \nWe arrived at Nara from the trains and went straight to Nakatanidou for some mochi and it was packed with people! It was even hard trying to get a space to watch them make the mochis. It was cool to experience the mochi making and to taste the mochi but I probably wouldn't go back there again because of the crowds.\n  \n***Nara Park***\n  \nAfter the mochis, we walked to Nara park and it was amazing! There were so many deers and they were so friendly and polite! This was my favorite part of nara for sure. For a few yen, we bought some crackers and found some deers that would bow everytime they wanted a cracker, it was too cute. The deers were literally everywhere, on the streets and even at temples.\n  \n***Shrines***\n  \nThere were lots of shrines around the area but we came pretty late so most of them were closing up but the ones we did see were pretty neat to look at. We also ate some udon at a little restaurant next to a small lake, the views of the lake were amazing from inside the restaurant.\n  \n\n\n**Osaka:**\n  \nAfter Nara, we came back to Osaka and the streets were so crowded at night. I tried shopping at don quixote but there were just to many people to weave through that I just decide to give up and try a 10 yen cheese bread near the store. The line was kind of long but I decided to try it out, it was actually really big, not that good, and made my stomach hurt. I would not be getting that again haha\n  \n***Matsusakagyu Yakiniku Restaurant***\n  \nMy boyfriend had reserved this place for Thursday but we were so tired that day that we decided to cancel our reservation. We decided to try to go in person on this day to see if we could get in. We were lucky that they had a spot available and we ordered a platter of A5 wagyu beef for more than $100 US dollar. Im not really a meat person but the beef was very tender and delicious and the service was very good. They took pictures of me and my boyfriend and gave me free ice cream for my birthday.\n\n\n  \n**Sunday May 21: Tokyo-Joypolis, Akihabara, skytree**\n  \n***Joypolis***\n  \nThe next morning we took the Nozumi back to Tokyo and headed straight to joypolis. We got tickets that allowed us to go on pretty much any ride there. Joypolis was small but had some interesting and unique rides and attractions. My favorite was the rhythm rollercoaster where you play rhythm games on a small roller coaster. We also played a VR Laser tag which was actually pretty fun even though I dont really play VR. There was an Attack on Titan walkthrough attraction that was completely in Japanese so I didnt understand any of it but it had some very cool props inside. The other interesting attraction was a scary house, where you have to get into these lockers and a girl comes and bangs on them and then the lockers flip you back horizontally. It wasnt that scary but it was pretty unique.\n  \n***Akihabara***\n  \nNext we went to Akihabara just to check out but we were actually super tired so we didnt stay long. We went to a couple stores but to be honest it was actually kind of boring as I am no longer as into anime as I was when I was a kid so we ended leaving akihabara fairly quickly.\n  \n***Tokyo Skytree***\n  \nInstead of going to akihabara I kind of wish I just went to the tokyo skytree shopping area because there was so much cool things to do there! They have a pokemon center, a kirby cafe, studio ghibli shop, and so many stores to shop or restaurants to eat at! We also went to the top of skytree but it honestly wasnt worth the money as the very top didnt have that much stuff and we just had to wait in these super long lines to get both up and down the skytree. After the skytree, we found a yakitori spot and ate some beef skewers which were delicious. We wished we went restaurant hopping more as there were just so many places to eat in this area.\n\n\n  \n**Monday May 22: Ueno Park and Departure**\n  \n***Ueno park***\n  \nBefore we left to the airport, we visited Ueno park which was only a few blocks away from our hotel. It had a beautiful lake which was covered with some sort of  lily pads. The park was pretty big and it was nice just walking around the area.\n  \n***Life Mart***\n  \nWe decided to stop at Life Mart to get some food before we left to the airport. The Meat was so delicious and was so cheap, and it had different options from conbinis.\n We took train back to Narita Airport, this train I think you have to reserve in advance.\n  \n***Narita airport***\n  \nGoing back through immigrations and customs and tsa was super easy and fast. We recommended getting lunch or snack early because there were pretty long lines as our departure time approached.\n  \n\nWe also bought Tokyo Banana for souvenir snacks to bring back to our families, its very delicious!\n  \n\nFor pictures of my trip you can take a look at my Instagram: martha_o93\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/martha_o93/\n  \n\nIn the end, visiting Japan was better than I could ever imagine and I just cant wait to go back! Please let me know what your favorite parts of Japan are and what other areas in Japan I must check out!",

                    "comment": "I live in Japan FWIW\n\ntrains - you can just book these through the train provider website, eg. [https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/reservation.html](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/reservation.html) for Tokyo area shinkansen / limited express etc. I honestly just use google maps for transit directions because I'm too lazy to read the Japanese language apps and it works 99% of the time. also, strictly speaking you don't really need to book in advance if the train isn't likely to be full (rush hour / weekend / holidays). for example I did a Tokyo -&gt; Osaka -&gt; Hiroshima -&gt; Osaka itinerary one year and I bought all of the shinkansen stations at the ticket machine in the station the day of, with no problems.\n\nrestaurants - first of all, if you're staying at a nice hotel (4-5 star), going through the hotel concierge will unlock a lot of places you probably couldn't reserve without being fluent in Japanese, or being referred by a regular at that restaurant etc.\n\nbeyond that, these days, a lot of restaurants, even fairly nice ones often let you reserve through some straightforward online portal. and in fact, some of them will even show up when you search the restaurant in google maps (just look for \"find a table\", somewhere around the phone number and opening hours on the listing). if you want to go the direction of \"search in the portal to find what restaurant I can reserve\", two of the easier to use systems are:\n\n* tablecheck (has english support but relatively few restaurants)\n* tabelog (reservation system doesn't have english support but it's easy to just google translate in your browser; much bigger restaurant selection)\n\nfor really really nice restaurants (let's say Michelin star+ and really high demand) there are specialized websites like omakase and pocket concierge that I've never used personally. I think they will often charge a (possibly significant) fee, have really strict cancellation policies etc.\n\nand finally if all else fails, there's no harm in trying regular methods like calling the restaurant and asking in English, or stopping by in person. I've had some surprising success stories like, one time I walked into a 2 michelin star tempura restaurant with no reservation (at lunch), speaking 0 Japanese then, because they happened to have a last minute cancellation. I've also booked a few really really nice places (sushi omakase / teppanyaki) in Ginza that were happy to accept reservations from foreigners who could only speak English, just by calling.",

However, he said he just went on the direct websites to book cafes and other activities. He used Klook to purchase disney and Universal tickets. And we only reserved specific trains in advanced for longer distances, like the Nozomi shinkansen, and that we booked the same day by going to the JR ticket booth at the station.\n\nI would recommend booking a month in advance for cafes and activities as the popular ones might run out of reservations early (im looking at you Pokemon cafe). For Ghibli park and the ghibli museum I would book even more in advance (maybe like 3 months in advance or whenever they first open) because those tickets are hard to get!",

After that, exchange cash in Shinjuku at interbank/Ninja Money Exchange on the outside of Omoide Yokocho (the best exchange rates I have seen, at least for the U.S. Dollar, with a difference of maybe 2 or 3 yen per dollar)\n\nI ALWAYS bring large luggage, usually two, plus a duffle bag and backpack, and even traveled across the whole of Japan with them, on trains and planes.  Of course, this isn't for everyone, but I do a lot of gift buying so I tend to need the space.  Just research the baggage limitations for different airlines and trains.  In particular, the bullet train (Shinkansen) can be difficult to find space for your luggage, although most cars do seem to have luggage racks, but it is first come first served.",

What they do is they leave their check in luggage empty going into Japan and just put their carry on luggage inside the check in luggage so they're only only carrying around one big luggage at the start of the trip. Saves a lot of hassle carrying multiple.  \n\nWe definitely had issues with finding luggage space even on the train from the airport to our hotels so what we did on the shinkansen is just had our check in bags delivered from hotel to hotel so we only had to lug around our carry on luggage. It cost like $15ish which is pretty worth to not deal with all that hassle, and we got it a day and a half after we sent it for delivery at the hotel",

It was frigging awesome waking up to a view of Fuji.  I ended up booking a ryokan with an open-air bath overlooking Fuji at Kawaguchiko the next day, so I really enjoyed Yamanashi.  In Nagasaki, I ate at the restaurant that invented Champon and the bake shop that invented castilla cake back in the 1600s.  In Kyoto, I visited the shrines and watched Fast X subtitled in Japanese, I wanted the 4DX show but that was only dubbed.\n\nMy Tokyo stay was less organized.  I'm still a video game and anime fan, so I went retro game hunting in Akiba.  Took me two days of hitting multiple stores, but I found 5 of the 6 games I was looking for.  I had a booking for the Final Fantasy 14 cafe and hit up the other game centered cafes in that building (Monster Hunter and Dragon Quest).  I ended up going to a Maid Cafe for the first time, I had no problem doing the cringey phrases they wanted me to say but I don't see myself going again. A buddy I used to do hip hop dancing with in college taught English in Tokyo a few years back, so he hooked me up with some folks to session with, so I did that.  Visited the Gundam factory in Yokohama, got the combo tickets and went to the top of Skytree, took my customary visit to the Hachiko statue and picture of the 109 Shibuya building, spent a half day collecting the eki stamps along the Yamanote line, I wanted to see how the club scene is but Im too old for that now so I went izakaya hopping most nights.  My aunt also runs a karaoke bar in Odaiba, so I visited her as well.\n\nWhat I want to do next time I go back, I'd like to go more in with the eki stamp hunting, the JR stations have 78 stamps, the Tokyo Metro stamps were tougher to get.  I also didn't go to the Gundam statue in Odaiba this time, I already have pictures with the RX-78 and Unicorn statues.  I also didn't get to visit the shrines in Tokyo.  Also, I would have liked more time to do some clothes shopping, tailored suits are very affordable there.",

The day I left was the first reported COVID death outside of China and it happened to be in the Philippines I was worried they weren't going to let me in!\n\nThe big game changer is the JR pass dramatically increasing in price this October.  I got the one-week green car for $300, it's getting bumped up to about $375 for a one week regular car pass!  Though, the price increase is going to have the added benefit of using the Nozomi and Mizuho trains which are the fastest trains.  The price increase was why I decided to hit up multiple cities.  \n\nMy original idea was to try to go across country from south to north, but it would have been 8 hours of travel from Tokyo to Sapporo and 8 hours back, so I opted to just go south and spend more days in Tokyo.  Once I knew the cities I was going to visit, then I went looking for the hotels and then lining up the train schedules and transfers.  Getting the lodging and train schedules helped out in determining how much time I had to go exploring.",

Like practically every store and restaurant I went to accepted my visa debit card and my Chase United, and if it didn't (the only place I remember was Mister Donut) then it accepted my IC card on my iPhone that I could top up with my card through apple wallet. Even smaller shops that I assumed would only take cash accepted card.  \n\nYou might have a different experience if you find some restaurants or food stands that don't accept cards (we didn't encounter many if any of these) and if you don't have apple devices so you're using the physical IC cards, but for the most part I got through my trip last week with just my two visa cards and my IC card with no issues. Never got the vibe that the workers were bothered by having to run the card through either",

Luckily, I saw a reddit post that said they added more tickets to ghibli park for may and we quickly bought tickets! Hopefully they'll add more tickets for July too.\n\nIf you arent able to go this year and decided to go back to Japan next year, they will have more areas available at ghibli park. I think next year they will have a howls moving castle area! so cool!",

But it was pretty crowded, I don't know how crowded golden week usually gets though as it's my first time going to japan. The most crowded was probably nishiki market only because it so small! It was also crowded in dotonburi in Osaka at night, then Kyoto near arashiyama bamboo forest area, and in the bigger train stations during rush hour. That's why I highly recommend doing the most popular tourist things very early morning before everyone gets there.",

Maybe if they dont allow luggage you can see if the closest train station has lockers to put your luggage in? As for the commute, we only took the train from Arashiyama Torokko station to Kameoka Torokko station. We didnt book a roundtrip so we took the JR train line back to arashiyama. Im looking at the online map for the romantic train and the last stop seems to be saga torokko station near the bamboo forest, so i dont think it goes back to gion, maybe you can take the JR train back to gion?",

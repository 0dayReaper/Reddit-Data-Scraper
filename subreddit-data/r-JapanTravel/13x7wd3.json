And if you can fly to Nagasaki it's ~7 hours, plus all the time spent is in the evening of your first day, where you are unlikely to be doing much anyways, while the daytime train hours are probably far more valuable. \n\nI feel like a 21 day rail pass is a waste of money for your itinerary (take out the Tokyo days and you are down to almost 14 days anyways, so it will likely be far cheaper to just by a 14 day pass), but YMMV of course \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.",

You're mostly referring to the fukuoka/nagasaki route back to Tokyo right? Would be really useful if you have any alternate paths\n\nThanks alot for your comments! Really useful and may have missed out some points in optimising",

Connecting to (ideally, but not sure if possible) Nagasaki or even Fukuoka turns it into a one-way trip.

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nMy family is planning to head over to Hokkaido to view the autumn foliage. Problem is, Google gives very different answers on when is the best period to see them. Ideally we would like to see the red leaves.\n\nFor reference, we are looking at early October (4-14 Oct) or late October (25 Oct to 4 Nov). While our itinerary is not settled yet, we will be starting at Hakodate and ending it at Sapporo \u2013 with stops at Noboribetsu, Furano, and Daisetsuzan National Park.\n\nIf any of you could give any advice on which is the better period to travel, or suggest alternative dates, it would be most welcomed.",

    "postText": "I'm Japan for 2 months, and I wanna download some apps, damnit.  The generally accepted solution online is to change your country setting but that can only be done once every 365 days.  That obviously won't work because I'll go back to the states and have the same problem for 10 months!\n\n\nI have found web downloads of apk files which works okay.  The downside is that apps like TVer need to be up to date to function properly, which means periodically reinstalling all my apps from sketchy websites.  Anybody have a more elegant solution? (E.g. something like a non-google app store, or secondary Google account)",

    "postText": "I'll be in Japan in October with my wife. \n\nWe're taking an overnight train from Kyoto to Yokohama (Kintetsu Bus) and we have a few hours before we'll be able to check in to our accomodation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been wanting to go to Enoshima Island. I was thinking we could take a train to Kamakura, take the electric railway to Enoshima, and then somehow get to the island. Apart from the boat, is there any other way over?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant to check out the main things on island, caves, dragon bell, garden, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was thinking of getting a day pass. Can you get them in Kamakura?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, was looking for a day pass for the Electric Railway, or some kind of multiple use ticket. Where can I get these, and can I use Suica?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI note that the escalators only go up on Enoshima. How does one go back down? Is there any easier way to leave the island other than the boat (and I would love a schedule for that, if available). Ideally I'd like to be on the island for a few hours, before getting back on the electric railway and heading back to Kamakura, than taking the train back to Yokohama. \n\nAdditionally ideally, I would love to stop at Hase to check out Kotoku-in and Kamakura Hasadera (along with the above).\n\nIs it feasible I can do all of this? After an overnight bus, I can probably be in Kamakura by 7-7:30am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks, and any other suggestions for Kamakura or Enoshima would be appreciated.",

We had an Airbnb about 10 min walk from the island, checked in at 3, then went and spent about 2-3 hours on the island before walking back and having dinner. \n\nWe stayed the night but you could easily do all that and head back to Yokohama after",

            "comment": "I just got back from Japan 2 weeks ago and did both Kamakura and Enoshima in a day with ease (I went to both on May 24th).\n\nAfter arriving in Kamakura, you can exit the station and purchase a day pass for \u00a5800 at one of the ticket terminals right outside the station \u2014 it covers your electric railway use to Enoshima and back \u2014 saves money in the long run.\n\nIn Kamakura, I did both Kotoku-in and Kamakura Hasadera \u2022 Kotoku-in was nice, more touristy but still worth seeing (you can go inside the Giant Buddha as well). Kamakura Hasadera has magnificent views at the top of the hike \u2014 there is a pathway up that gives you breathtaking views of the coastline \u2014 truly one of the highlights of the day.\n\nEnoshima Island is within walking distance from the Enoshima station \u2014 I walked down to the beach and strolled until the bridge, walking across the bridge to the Island (it took less than 5 mins to cross the bridge, about a 20 minute walk to the island from the station). If the weather is clear, you can see Mt Fuji from the bridge as well, which was lovely to take pictures of.\n\nEnoshima Island is relatively crowded (not as much as other major tourist hubs in Japan, but still) \u2014 I didn\u2019t see any foreigners while I was there, just Japanese tourists (I think it\u2019s a popular seaside escape).\n\nThere\u2019s multiple booths, shops, caf\u00e9s and places to eat on the island, and the shrine is walkable to \u2014 I didn\u2019t hike up the entire way but I can imagine that it\u2019s a beautiful site.\n\nIf the weather is nice, I would highly recommend bringing a towel \u2014 I walked barefoot along the beach in Enoshima and should have brought a towel for my feet \u2014 it was a relaxing stroll nonetheless; my top experience of the day.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know! When I went the weather was nice, but may be different with the rainy season :)",

We walked the stairs and it was not difficult as long as you take some time to enjoy the view and look around before moving up to the next level.  There are vending machines on each level if you need a cold (or warm) beverage.  Make sure to try some Kinokuniya Honten Meoto Manju (sweet steamed buns).  The shop is over 100 years old.  What\u2019s most interesting (to me) about the island are the large birds of prey flying around snatching food from unsuspecting tourists.  There are signs everywhere warning of large Hawks dive bombing for food.  I didn\u2019t take it seriously until I saw it happen twice!  They are HUGE!",

            "comment": "So just repeating what others have said Enoshima line is crowded from Kamakura so suggest Yokohama to Ofuna. Monorail from ofuna to Enoshima. Enoshima line Enoshima to Kamakura. Kamakura to Yokohama. Btw Yokohama and Minato Mirai and China town are a few stations apart by Toyoko line. \nBut in reality either you are very young or have lots of stamina going to all those places plus dinner in Chinatown after an overnight bus will be rough. \nNot sure if you\u2019ve heard of the anime Slam Dunk but it\u2019s one of the reasons why Enoshima line is crowded. \n\nAlso might want to checkout the jr pass before price increase. \nhttps://www.jrailpass.com/blog/japan-rail-pass-prices-increase/amp\n\nHawks are a real thing in Kamakura and Enoshima if you want to live on the edge try eating Lawson karage kun at the beach they love those.",

You can use Suica or Pasmo for the electric railway.  There is a bridge out to the island, but if you get to the the south side of Enoshima and don\u2019t feel like walking back there is a ferry that will take you back to the mainland.  At the shops to the left of the bridge you can get some barbecued scallops and squid.",

            "comment": "The fastest way to Enoshima from Yokohama is to take the JR lines to Fujisawa and transfer to the Enoshima line. To get to the island, you just walk over the bridge. Japanese hotels are sticklers for no early check-in until ~3, but most will accept your luggage for storage. Highly recommend dropping of your bags at the hotel instead of lugging them around all day.\n\nMy biggest advice for Enoshima and Kamakura is to not go on a weekend; they will be crowded with Tokyoites doing weekend getaways. I\u2019d rather try to do each on their own day; Kamakura is somewhat spread out if you want to maximize the number of temples and shrines you visit.\n\nAlso, train passes aren\u2019t really a thing in Japan.",

Here is the one for enoden https://www.enoden.co.jp/en/tourism/ticket/noriorikun/\n\nThe one for the tram between Kamakura and Enoshima is sold direct at the station. I did not get it as I would have needed to at least ride it one more time to save money, but it should be sold in the ticket machine or if not, at the counter.",

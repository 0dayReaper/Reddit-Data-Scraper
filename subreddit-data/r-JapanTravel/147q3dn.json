            "comment": "Hello, from my experience I would say you can do pretty much all of this on your trip. I would recommend to focus on the places you really want to visit first then add things around that and which are close by. I did almost everything on your itinerary when I visited and it's achievable but you gotta start your day early, be mindful of your time and walk fast lol. If you want to do all this, just know it's not gonna be a leisure stroll. Hope that helps. If you need an recs I would be happy to share.",

I\u2019m just a bit more of a spontaneous person, so I am not too sure how much time Id personally spend at some areas. I do think of myself being quite a fast walker! So it is good that you think it\u2019s feasible. Thank you so much!",

I waited for about an hour and a half in an online queue haha, I didn\u2019t do anything special like making a japanese lawson account or whatever, I just used the link for english readers. The traffic really is quite crazy though, I had 5 devices, ranging in queue from 3000 people ahead of me to 10000 people ahead of me.",

I would be concerned about your parents becoming tired or burned out as there is a lot of walking and moving around.\n\nYou are going to too many castles (Osaka, Hiroshima, Kanazawa, Himeji), one is enough.\n\nShirakawago is completely touristified and only takes a couple of hours to see, but it is on the UNESCO list so worth going to tick a box.\n\nOsaka-Nara is best by train, not by bus.",

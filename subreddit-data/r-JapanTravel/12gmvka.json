I can post an update on my experience once it's done if you'd like.",

Lots of options. \n\nKyoto and nara on the same day??? Good luck with that. Also Arashiyama and Fushimi Inari are total opposites in the map. Maybe you should rearrange things. \n\nIf you are visiting the giant gundam, check the amusement park nearby (I love roller coasters so it\u2019s mandatory to me).",

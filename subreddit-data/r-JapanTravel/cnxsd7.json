Just recently my dad has passed away somewhere in Okinawa. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if anyone has any information on what my mum could do next so that I can help her out. \n\nHow would she get the body home from japan etc?\n\nThank you so much in advance if anyone can help.",

            "comment": "OP, please accept my sincerest condolences. \n\nUnfortunately, this sub is mostly frequented by tourists ho have little to no experience with traveling to Japan, let alone with something of this nature. \n\nYou or another family member must contact the embassy of your father\u2019s country of citizenship. They are the ones equipped to deal with this, and there might be a page on the embassy or consulate website about repatriation of remains. It\u2019s likely the nearest consulate will be in Fukuoka or Osaka if there isn\u2019t one in Okinawa. Please contact the embassy ASAP. We are about to enter a holiday period in Japan and most offices will close. I would call RIGHT NOW, as it\u2019s 4pm in Japan. \n\nFinally, as embalming is not widely practiced in Japan, your father will most likely have to be cremated. If embalming is done, it will be VERY expensive. If your father was American, there might be a chance the American morgue for military would assist, but that is probably not an option for you.\n\nThere are many well-meaning comments here, but they contain misleading information. Contact the British Embassy. They will help you.",

It\u2019s usually an add-on to regular life insurance policies, but you may still want to check if your parents have life insurance that might help cover that cost. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry for your family\u2019s loss and I hope you find comfort soon.",

                    "comment": "Insurance policies, especially travel insurance policies, can assist with repatriation of remains. However, the issue at hand is that embalming is not a wide practice in Japan, so repatriation of a body is impossible. Not to mention, it\u2019s 30+ degrees across most of Japan right now. Transporting a body will be difficult as it is. \n\nCremation is the only option in this situation. An insurance policy can\u2019t change this fact, sadly.",

            "comment": "A lot depends on the situation - contact the British embassy in Tokyo for advice in the first instance. \n\nIf there is no insurance policy to cover repatriation of your father, looking into cremation in japan and repatriating the ashes might be an alternative option depending on your family\u2019s wishes. (A ceremony to bury the ashes could then be held at a future date under less stressful circumstances.) But obviously the route is not for everyone. \n\nEmbassy will be very familiar with these issues so  get in touch with them first of all. I wish you all the best with this and I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.",

First, I am sorry for your loss.  \n\nIt seems there is a choice to cremate in Japan and bring home after, or bring the body home on a flight to the UK.   \n  \n**Please** see this first:   \nhttps://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/when-someone-dies-abroad    \n\nThis website can also give you some information and ideas:  \nhttps://beyond.life/help-centre/arranging-a-funeral/how-to-repatriate-a-body-and-how-long-it-takes/   \nhttps://beyond.life/help-centre/arranging-a-funeral/what-is-the-cost-of-repatriating-a-body/   \n\nThis is a company, so they may not give perfect advice (and want you to buy their services).   \n\nI do think the UK consulate, or a government agency will have info and help you.  It seems like name is British Consul   \n\nPlease don't be afraid to call a UK government agency and ask them for help.  You may need to say \"do you know who I can talk to about this, or who can help me\".",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'm planning a trip to Japan this upcoming September/October and we'll be staying for a few days near Ito in Izu Peninsula, we found some cool fishing spots nearby so we're hoping to fish (at least try) on some of the days.\n\nI've searched on a few sources online but want to avoid any confusion and potential trouble with local authorities, so I need your help on the following points:\n\n* The sources I've found mentions for saltwater fishing (coast, piers, etc) it should be all right without a need of a fishing license/permit - is this a national guideline or can vary from Prefecture to Prefecture?\n* For rivers, lakes and such it is mentioned that is mandatory of a permit/license with the possibility of a 1-day permit to be issued - is there website where we can check who can issue a license depending on the area I want to fish? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a final note, aside from fishing we're hoping to go swimming on a few beaches - however it will be outside the official \"beach season\" - can we get in trouble for such? (We're not planning to go off to a random cliff or body of water but a designated beach out of the beach season).   \nI've checked a few beaches rules and guidelines but found no mention of off-season swimming.\n\nThanks!",

Just use a picture translate app for any signs around or near the pier.  Sometimes locals ignore signs that say don\u2019t go out on the pier etc.   \n\nfreshwater usually requires a license from the local city hall and can be expensive.   \nthey rarely have cheap 3 day permits.",

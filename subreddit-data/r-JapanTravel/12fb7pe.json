    "postText": "I took/gained so much from this subreddit in my planning that I figured I would give back:\n\nFirst-time trip for my wife (35F) and myself (34M). I booked our flights and hotels within a week of the announcement of reopening to general, non-guided tourism. Our planned stay was 3/19 - 4/5.\n\nThis was a bucket-list trip for us + 3yr delayed honeymoon. We didn't ball out but I wasn't too concerned about our spending for a celebratory occasion. Our focus was to eat well, have fun, and see[ ch](https://imgur.com/n59i1Oi)e[rry](https://imgur.com/IKJcUfU)[ bl](https://imgur.com/n59i1Oi)o[ss](https://imgur.com/9w6O6wO)o[ms](https://imgur.com/LHaQ2bM).\n\n**Prep for Japan:**\n\n* I had been lurking this subreddit for weeks, combing through comments for recommendations and travel tips. There was also a resurgence of content from Youtubers living/working in Japan that was helpful to know which businesses survived Covid, what tourist changes had occurred. 95% of my final itinerary was shaped by this sub.\n* Reservation prioritization: Flights &gt; Hotels &gt; Specialty trains&gt; USJ and major entertainment attractions&gt; High-end meals (depending)&gt; Shinkansen seats. I reserved everything online via SmartEx or used my Suica card to get around.\n* Between Oct - Feb, over 90% of my lodging, nice meals, itinerary and POIs were reserved. I was trying not to over plan, but in hindsight I probably still did.\n* Exchanged $1000USD back in October at JPY144:$1 rate. First time I timed something right.\n\nHere is a custom Google Maps list of all of the various POIs and dining options we considered. https://goo.gl/maps/WHbBgikoUbPzrUzP9\n\n**Accommodations &amp; Transportation:**\n\n* Tokyo: Shibuya, Sequence @ Miyashita Park: Great location, small rooms. This hotel had some poor reviews recently for the minimal staff experience, but i didn't experience any issues. Everyone I spoke with was able to communicate in English well enough.\n* Kyoto: TSUGU Kyoto Sanjo near Nishiki Market: Great location, rooms were nice and reasonably sized. On-site laundry. Would recommend.\n* Osaka: The Flag Shinsaibashi: Amazing location, fantastic hotel with modern accommodations, the rooms and restrooms were great. On-site laundry &amp; coffee was great. I'd highly recommend.\n* Hakone: Yama no chaya Asebi 100sq.m room with private open-air bath. This came recommended often on this sub for Hakone. I decided to splurge here for 2 nights. It was good, but I feel like you can get better for the price. More later.\n* Tokyo pt2: Ginza, Aloft Ginza via Marriott points. 3 nights in the Larger King for \\~150000 points. Great location, good amenities. Would recommend.\n* All specialty trains and shinkansen tickets were booked 3+ weeks in advance via SmartEX app or online.\n\n**TOKYO (4 days, Mar 20 - 24):**\n\n* Initial flight from Austin to Houston suffered mechanical delay. We missed our ANA-operated flight to Haneda and United rebooked us the following morning 6AM from Austin&gt;SFO&gt;HND. Lost about 12 hours of vacation\n* eSim via Ubigi on the day of arriving. Got the 30day/3GB for my wife, and the 10GB for me. We both used maybe 75% of it over 16 days.\n* Picked up 2x Welcome Suicas directly in Haneda Terminal 3 prior to exiting for the Terminal 3 Station\n* We wound up spending a lot of time in Ebisu,[ Naka](https://imgur.com/spTsH3i)meguro, and Daikanyama for one reason or another due to interesting meals or shopping.\n* Things I skipped/missed: Meguro River Cruise (rain), Shibuya Sky (flight delay/wet weather)\n* Things I loved: We had a chance to visit[ Toyosu Market](https://imgur.com/Cal1smX) on the[ wholesalers floor](https://imgur.com/u5dBZfJ) for a[ behind the scenes](https://imgur.com/u5dBZfJ) tour with chef Sato-san of Hakkoku and our Austin-based sushi chef who is training under him for several months. It was a treat to be able to walk with them as they did their daily morning shopping and vendor visits. Sometimes they[ aren't down](https://imgur.com/OTENmKL) with photos so you apologize and move on.\n\n**KYOTO (4 days, Mar 24-28)**\n\n* Reserved Shinkansen green car w/ reserved luggage storage 3+ weeks out for the discounted rate.\n* We walked the[ Philosopher's Path](https://imgur.com/O6qoSDz) into[ Keage Incline](https://imgur.com/Skb5yZD) because of the peak cherry blossom bloom. Despite the[ hundreds](https://imgur.com/vOXBZf8) of tourists -- it was still a very idyllic scene.\n* We booked the Fushimi Inari Locals\u2019 Hidden Hiking[ tour](https://imgur.com/d3bkTiI) that has been promoted by a few YouTubers and absolutely loved it. Probably one of the highlights of our trip. We saw[ maybe](https://imgur.com/PhkJ9EF) 50-100 people total in the first 2 hours of the 3HR hike up the back of the mountain. Only when exiting the front of Fushimi Inari did we catch up to the commonly-visited thousand gates area and sea of the general tourist population. I would highly recommend this hike if you want to enjoy a quieter path to visit Fushimi Inari. Be physically prepared for the uphill climb and have the right shoes for a modest hike.\n* Things I skipped/missed: Arashiyama (weather + tired legs), Kiyomizu-dera night illumination (tired).\n* Things I loved: Waking up and strolling around before 8-9AM before the world wakes up. Walking down[ \\- Nishi-Kiyamachi-dori St](https://imgur.com/l2rZI6R) with[ blossoms](https://imgur.com/shXmlvC) everywhere, casual rooftop drinking @ \u2018In the Moon\u2019, foot soak + much-needed massage at Mominoki House. Besides blossoms, there [were](https://imgur.com/9LLGjE3) [beautiful](https://imgur.com/C8pDJN6) [flowers](https://imgur.com/aWLgzTL) [everywhere](https://imgur.com/jfGY463).\n\n**OSAKA (4 days, Mar 28-Apr 1)**\n\n* Reserved the Kintetsu Limited Express sight-seeing[ train](https://imgur.com/JMuP5aG) AONIYOSHI from Kyoto &gt; Nara for a day-trip, continuing on to Osaka by 5PM for our hotel check-in. We really enjoyed Nara as a calm and[ delightful](https://imgur.com/bx1uc5d) day trip. We walked past Nara park, towards the Mt Wakakusa base[ North Gate](https://imgur.com/uutOwKD) and scenic area filled with blossoms and deer.\n* We then did a loop around Todai-ji before making our way to the crowded front entrance path and completing the loop back towards Kintetsu-Nara station to wrap our day trip. I purchased a damascus gyuto at Kikuichi Cutlery for myself and a santoku for my mom.\n* Visited Team Labs Osaka at the Nagai Botanical Garden\u2026 meh, but it was better than Naked @ Nijo-ji.\n* Visited USJ on our last day, Friday 3/31 to what seems like a full crowd of 25-30K people. Bought the express pass on Klook that included Nintendo[ World](https://imgur.com/W9zacjc) timed admission, Harry Potter timed admission, Minions Ride, Spider-Man or Jurassic Park ride. I\u2019ve never really been big on theme parks and this was no different. 15-20 minute waits even with Express Pass for a 3-5 minute ride that sometimes gave us a bit of motion sickness was an experience that I won\u2019t be rushing to do again. Spider-Man was pretty cool and the Forbidden Journey ride was immersively intense, but I was 2 minutes away from getting pretty nauseous. Good thing it was our last ride of the night.\n* Things I skipped/missed: Osaka Castle Park (started to get blossomed out)\n* Things I loved: The base of Mt. Wakakusa in Nara where there is a picturesque seated area with deers and park benches. Hotel the Flag Shinsaibashi was great and I would highly recommend it to anyone.\n\n**HAKONE (2 days, April 1-3)**\n\n* Reserved[ Shinkansen](https://imgur.com/WCT6ixq) from Shin-Osaka to Odawara 3+ weeks early for the green car with reduced rate. We sent all of our big luggage from Osaka back to Tokyo, only bringing our backpacks and a small duffel to Hakone.\n* We stayed at Yama no chaya based on a lot of positive reviews on this subreddit. It was a charming place and our host was great -- but a 3PM check-in and 10AM checkout doesn\u2019t leave a lot of time for activity given you automatically lose about 3-4Hrs solely dining in your room each day. The meals were very good, the private baths were good. However the valley views and sound of nearby traffic from the road left a little to be desired.\n* Our host recommended traveling via the Hakone Tozan Railway instead of by bus that would crawl in traffic. The railway was more scenic for sure, but it still took about 30-40 minutes alone to move from Tonosawa to Gora station so it was probably a push, time-wise.\n* I must have screwed up my ticket purchase from Gora up the ropeway to Sounzan because there was some ticket misunderstanding for myself and seemingly several other tourists as well resulting in some halting, items lost in translation with the station staff, and confused frustration.\n* Things I skipped/missed: Hakone ropeway down to Togendai and visiting Lake Ashi and the Hakone shrine (not enough time to get back well before 6PM dinner)\n* Things I loved: Self-serve[ green tea](https://imgur.com/Xblsv64) in the[ mornings](https://imgur.com/jSieS8a) and [A5](https://imgur.com/1XfHBYG) wagyu [hotpot](https://imgur.com/ZfAXTsp) on the second night of our stay at Yama no chaya\n\n**GINZA (3 days, April 3-6)**\n\n* Returned to Tokyo to stay in Ginza. Reserved seats on the observation deck car for the Odakyu Romancecar from Hakone-Yumoto to Shinjuku. Getting seats on the first row of the observation deck must be super difficult to secure, but seems well worth it.\n* We enjoyed our plans for a baller omakase meal via a 25 course dinner with Chef Ryutaro @ Hakkoku. Despite meeting and touring Toyosu with Head Chef Sato-san a week prior, we were still first-time foreign visitors to Hakkoku and thus highly unlikely to get a seat with the big-boss himself. But, he did greet us to say hello. Among the highlights were sayori (needle fish), ankimo (monkfish liver), masu (sea trout), katsuo (bonito), and obviously the chutoro and otoro.\n* We did most of our shopping in this final leg. I bought a pair of grails that I have been eyeing for years at[ Hender Scheme](https://imgur.com/lOII8po) in Ebisu. Reloaded on some basics at Uniqlo, did some thrifting in Kinji, oogled the merchandise at[ Worm](https://imgur.com/f0tDQ3S), scoffed at the prices at Dover Street Market Ginza.\n* Had reservations for NAKED Cherry Blossoms night illumination at Shinjuku Gyoen. I didn\u2019t do my research for this one because all the locals came early in full force, and came prepared for a full evening picnic in the park. In hindsight, we would have stopped by Lawsons to grab a bunch of food and drinks before entering the park.\n* Things I missed/skipped: Ueno Park (blossomed out), Akihabara (didnt have luggage space to entertain what ifs)\n* Things I loved: Finding the Kirin Lemon Tea, hot or cold. Walking around Shinjuku at night looking for [interesting](https://imgur.com/bQpVTML) [alleys](https://imgur.com/p5brXOi).\n\n**FOOD/DINING:**\n\n* Lawson\u2019s tuna mayo + egg sandwiches have made me a member of team Lawson.\n* I learned about how good Family Mart\u2019s hot-and-ready chicken is.\n* [A5 + uni](https://imgur.com/GFtQgH1) is just a bit too much richness. I'd rather be a A3 - A4 kind of guy.\n* Ramen:\n   * Even the ramen in the ANA Lounge was better than most i\u2019ve had in the states\n   * Ate at Ippudo, didn\u2019t get a chance to visit Ichiran but I was surprised to see a line for Ichiran no matter which city. To me, modern was better than classic.\n   * Got the tsukemen at Wajoryomen Sugari in Kyoto. I didn\u2019t want to be the asshole gaijin holding up the line trying to translate their Japanese-only POS, so we rushed the ordering process and hoped for the best. Got the tsukemen + raw egg add-on. I definitely screwed up by missing out on ordering the chashu slices.\n   * Had the specialty fatty pork-rib ramen at Hanamaruken in Dotombori. A lot of the reviews said it was overly salty but I thought it was delicious. Salty? Not really. Fatty/greasy AF? Duh, you\u2019re eating rendered[ pork rib.](https://imgur.com/xGHfrU6)\n* Tokyo: Mark\u2019s Tokyo - 3.15 on Tabelog which means average to good (for Japan). I saw this recommendation via a comment in a prior thread on /japantravel. Chef Mark is half Japanese/half Italian and was a former Finance bro turned late-blooming chef that trained in NYC. The meal was[ delicious](https://imgur.com/qmn9v8Z) and the atmosphere was charming. As someone who loves to cook, it was great to sit at a little 6-7 seat counter and watch him work a few feet away. And, it was a great opportunity to bounce my itinerary with a local in English at the beginning of my trip and get some future recommendations. He highly recommended trying Hirokazuya in Osaka, a hole in the wall okonomiyaki place and ordering the Buta Negiyaki.\n* Tokyo: Yoroniku Ebisu - a 4.3+ on Tabelog which is usually means to expect great and I booked this via tablecheck. This was one of the BEST meals I had in Japan. The[ silky beef](https://imgur.com/BjmIXt0) will be a memory i keep forever and the[ zabuton + truffle sukiyaki](https://imgur.com/XCnFfHT)[ dip](https://imgur.com/LZPvaCN) shaved fresh at the table was simply umami overload. I don\u2019t often pay for fresh table-side truffle in the states because it is a rip-off but our host and griller simply went to town on a whole truffle between the two of us. I gasped when she didn\u2019t stop shaving the half piece she started with and proceeded to begin shaving the next one.\n* Tokyo: Hakkoku Ginza - 3.9+ on tabelog which is very close to great. I booked this via Omakase(dot)in. My buddy is an Austin sushi chef who is training under chef Hiro-san. I considered booking at other places rated slightly higher (Arai, Ryujiro) at his recommendation -- but ultimately I thought it would be more interesting to eat where he was training so that we had the chance to see him and discuss/reminisce about a menu familiar for all of us. The experience was great, we sat at a counter full of foreign tourists (couple from melbourne, couple from shanghai) and the chef[ Ryutaro-san](https://imgur.com/tHTZxjt) did his best to make conversation. He was able to converse about the dishes well enough and he and I got along about golf.[ 25](https://imgur.com/rVTWsiD) courses was plenty of food but I came prepared, my wife was challenged at around course 21.\n* Osaka: Yakitori Ichimatsu - 3.8+ on tabelog which is very good. I booked on Omakase(dot)in. The chef is an absolute pro in working with chicken. We got so full that we had to pass on some of the final rice or noodles. I don\u2019t understand how some of these Japanese couples next to us were pounding down the same amount of meat and even more drinks. What champs.\n* Tokyo: Tonkatsu Aoki Ginza - 3.75+ on tabelog which is very good. This came recommended from Chef Hiro-san for Tonkatsu in Ginza. We got both the mega[ fatty](https://imgur.com/qhmHZ1w)[ pork sirlion](https://imgur.com/vcCh2Ox) and the more modest pork filet. It looks like a lot of food at 300g + rice, cabbage, soup, but we both managed to finish our meals. It was worth a 30 minute wait.\n* Kyoto: Hafuu Honten Main Store - 3.6+ on tabelog which is close to very good. The host spoke perfect English and was a pro at explaining the courses. The[ beef](https://imgur.com/Ar4m3Ig) was[ very good](https://imgur.com/G7AwcBp) and it was one of my more memorable meals in Kyoto. I booked this on some Japanese reservation site that I cannot find in my history. (\u201cIKYOU or something similar?)\n* Tokyo: Isshin Daikanyama - 3.6+ on tabelog which is close to very good. Some YouTuber recommended this as a place where locals go to eat. We were about 30-40th in line 30 minutes before the place opened. Luckily we were one of the last 2 tables to be sat in the opening wave of diners so we didn\u2019t have to wait for tables to turn over. Quality wise, it was a very[ good meal](https://imgur.com/m2KuRRL) for lunch.\n* Yakiniku Black Hole Shinjuku - 3.4+ on tabelog. I think I bookmarked this place because of StrictlyDumpling on YT. We walked into this place without reservation on a Tuesday night after Shinjuku Gyeon and were sat promptly. I love all things grill-it-yourself, Korean or Japanese, so this was a pleasant experience. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to get their touchpad POS into English so i relied on Google translate. Turns out thinly sliced sirloin wagyu is pretty fuckin great and we attempted to recreate our own sirloin sukiyaki with raw egg experience. All-in the meal was super affordable for the[ quality](https://imgur.com/9gC0oQr) of the[ beef](https://imgur.com/hoyCuca) that you get.\n\n**TAKEWAYS/TIPS**\n\n* Was prepared for dealing with trash but damn, it is a real strategic challenge at times. You could rely on an opportunity to dump some trash (and acquire more) by visiting some Family Mart\u2019s or when you pass through a station.\n* You can rely on finding restrooms within specific areas of most stations and often at department stores. Maybe we were hydrating so much but we were pretty conscious to try to use the restroom each time we had a reliable window.\n* Hydration is so critical. Drink tons of water on the plane so you don\u2019t dry out. We were doing 25K steps per day for almost a week straight before we needed to tone it down. I was mowing through Pocari Sweats to stay hydrated from all the walking and casual beer drinking throughout the day at restaurants.\n* Don\u2019t overdo the planning and walking. After several days of 12mi+ and 25K steps, our feet were simply not happy. We ultimately visited Mominoki House for a foot soak or massage in both Shibuya and Kyoto to recharge our bodies for future travel days.\n* Get an IC card for local travel, and purchase your tickets online. I don't get why so many people would waste their precious travel time waiting in line to buy tickets. Swiping in and out via IC card was so fast and easy. I did not wind up booking the 2-week or 3-week JR pass for my 16 day trip. Based on my calculations, i wasn't really traveling enough to almost break even.\n* When riding buses in Kyoto, you enter through the middle door and pay as you exit the front door. This appears to be backwards from my experience in Tokyo and general common sense assumptions. I saw some foreigners get this mixed up and confused as to why the driver was telling them to do otherwise.\n* Kids are so well behaved in Japan and i\u2019m amazed at how they must be raised. I don\u2019t have any kids yet but if it did, I\u2019d want to learn how Japanese parents do it. Seemed like any kid that went noticed was likely a foreign child. At worst, a Japanese toddler would look disgruntled -- but rarely heard. Raising your hands to cross the street is so cute and safe in the world of tons of ambiguous intersections.\n* Don\u2019t always trust your GPS until you can get some better verification, like a printed sign with your station name or take a brief visit to a surface street. There were multiple times where my GPS told me i was in station A, while i was 3-4 stations away in B, and it could have gotten me on the wrong ride.\n* Trusting Google Maps and the platform # is your friend. Ultimately knowing which platform to look for got me to the correct destination when running through the maze of a station. I still don\u2019t think I grasp where the hell is was transitioning between within Shibuya station and the Shibuya Hikarie but I got there. There will be times where you rush into a train going the wrong direction. I would just get off at the next stop and reverse platforms/direction to the right route. It shouldn\u2019t cost you anything except some time, assuming it wasn\u2019t a shinkansen or limited ride.\n* I prepared and studied-up on about 20-25 phrases in Japanese ahead of time. Besides the obvious basics, the ones that were most useful were probably, Eigo wakari masuka? (Do you know english?), Gomen nasai (sorry) obviously sumimasen (excuse me), ijo desu (that\u2019s all, when ordering), yoyaku arimasu (i have a reservation), hitori desu(one person) / hitotsu (one thing) and futari desu (two people) and futatsu (two things), kore onegaishimasu (this please, when pointing to the chicken in the window) o kaikei onegaishimasu (check, please) \\_\\_\\_\\_ arimasuka? (\\_\\_\\_\\_ do you have it?) and \\_\\_\\_\\_ wa doko deska? (\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ where is it?)\n* At least within Tokyo and Osaka, a lot of people and youth are fashionable AF. I\u2019m not sure how many people are busting their ass for long hours to buy a single Celine piece or Prada boots but I was amazed at the sheer volume of luxury shopping and materialism on display. I am glad that both my wife and I have very little interest in that race.\n* We did quite a bit of shopping for clothes, gifts and souvenirs. Among my big purchases were the [MIP-25](https://imgur.com/8gKX47x) by HenderScheme, based on the Air Max 90, a jacket from the Human-Made 1928 store in Kyoto, a 210mm [gyuto](https://imgur.com/tHcoMGQ) from Kikuichi in Nara. We returned home with 2 large suitcases that we checked, 1 carry-on roller, 1 medium duffel-bag that held return laundry. We each also had a personal backpack for tech and valuables. We used Yamato transport about 3 times total over 16 days (ex. Kyoto to Osaka allowing Nara daytrip, Osaka to Ginza allowing light Hakone weekend.) Each time was about $17 for each suitcase and it arrived within 24-48hours. For me, it was worth it to avoid breaking into a mad sweaty hustle to move luggage around huge stations.\n* A $250 per head sushi meal in Japan vs a $250 per head sushi meal in Austin or Los Angeles seems like it has diminishing returns up to a point. I would assume the quality + consistency of fish is high everyday at this tier in Japan. Whereas back home, I would get access to a very, very nice piece of otoro maybe once every 3-4 months, often times the otoro was average to nice. I think the ability to source very high-quality fish to cities all over the world recently has made very good sushi more accessible to everyone.. I\u2019m not sure i\u2019ve yet found life-changing sushi. There is always next time\u2026\n* Holy shit i wrote a novella.",

A huge splurge for sure on something that is an artisan, handmade-in-japan, leather BIFL shoe that i'll cherish.\n\nBut that hardly compares to some of the drip that I was seeing on tons of younger japanese locals -- i'm talking balenciaga trainers, celine tops, LV jackets, Dior bags, Prada boots with little coinpurses on them. It had me doing double-takes on what kind of wealth or obscene materialism may exist within some Japanese families.",

Alternately, some common daytrip places like Takayama and Kanazawa are also lovely to visit past 3pm as tour groups start to depart and you might be able to catch some shops open (I kostly go for the free tasting of sake lol). Golden hour+lack of crowd makes up for the shops imo as I get to enjoy the vibe of the place.\n- Regarding recharging/foot soaks, I love how Japanese bathrooms always have a tub so I always do a warm soak night.

This was maybe 3-5 total destinations.\n\nThen I began to make reservations for most of the peak Friday/Saturday nights given that we were visiting during such a busy travel window of the sakura bloom. I didn't really want worry about not having a above-average meal destination when thousands of tourists and locals would be eating in the same window. I would say most of my reservations took place in Tokyo and Kyoto. Osaka had enough easy dining options everywhere that I didn't feel compelled to plan that intensely.\n\nUltimately, it seemed like even really popular places would have long lines mostly for the opening wave and shortly thereafter. Once places were open for 1-2 hours, it seemed like you could potentially walk-in or get a seat in the third or fourth turnover without much issue on weekdays.\n\nDepending on the \"tier\" of meal, you likely don't need or can't even make reservations for more common meals like ramen, izakaya, conveyor belt sushi, etc. If a great spot was too busy, we often just moved along to another nearby alternative. In no circumstance did we wait for than 30-45 minutes for food -- i refused to do so.\n\nLast, as far as planning and overplanning, my main goal each day was to have an idea of which neighborhood we wanted to start the day in and which areas we would be branching to throughout the day (with a goal to stay within specific areas vs trekking back and forth across the city. Ex Shimokitazawa, into Meguro, into Ebisu. Shinjuku, down to Harajuku, down to Shibuya. Odaiba, into Tsukiji, up to Ginza.) On select days, we would have a specific dinner reservation and neighborhood in mind to end the day at, and just made a work-back schedule for a loose travel itinerary from there.",

My wife and I dressed up a tiny bit to be more evening business casual for our omakase at Hakkoku but there were japanese locals that showed up dripped out in high-fashion hoodies and full aesthetic gothy-schoolgirl vibes. I think the main goal is just not to arrive smelling like you've been trekking all day or like you've doused yourself in masking cologne or spray. \n\nAs for dining for a family of 5, i would likely have to recommend a reservation where you can find a private table or private room. This could be shabushabu places, yakiniku places, etc. \n\nIn hindsight, I think we would have enjoyed time and views at a lake-side ryokan in Kawaguchiko rather than be in Hakone. It would add another +3-4 hours total in your commute though so keep that in mind.",

It's my second trip, but given the similarities between our itineraries, this post is a godsend. Especially food recommendations- I tend to wing it with that kind of stuff when I travel, but I'll bookmark a few of those. \n\nYour planning/prep routine sounds similar to mine as well. Is there anything you wish you booked earlier? Or prioritized for later? Any price fluctuations you might have noticed? \n\nDo you have any tips for USJ as well? I've heard horror stories about the wait and expense, but my fiance really wants to go. Any suggestions to make the trip run more smoothly are welcome :)",

I was definitely surprised that I wasn't able to secure the ideal seats on some of the limited express sightseeing trains given that I was reserving 30-40+ days out. But I guess it makes sense given that there are basically 10-20 elite seats for some train cars that only operate on 2-4 routes per day.\n\nI would have prioritized as much shopping for the latter half of our trip rather than seizing immediate opportunities at the beginning. Trying to lug around gifts in boxes or shoeboxes was not really worth the hassle. \n\nUSJ, we booked via ApplePay on their website and then got the express pass via Klook. If you buy the express pass via ApplyPay on their official ticketing portal -- i believe you have more control in selecting the timed entry windows. With Klook, you get what you get. For us, the Express Pass was worth it to get in 4-5 top rides within the 6-7 hours we were there. Otherwise, we saw 60+ minute waits for even the basic rides and 120-180+ minute waits for the star attractions. No way in hell we were gonna try to play that game. \n\n  \nAlso, outside food is stated as prohibited in USJ but we saw so many folks munching on some conbini snacks everywhere. I don't think the ban is strictly enforced and it was worth having available while you wait in a 20-30 minute line for food.",

In my experience, all the hotel front desks will make your experience super easy and minimal as they take care of all steps of arranging transport. I would recommend the following based on my recent shipments:\n\n\\- Check in with the hotel prior to handing over your packed, ready-to-go bag(s). This is your opportunity to give them the destination address and they may call ahead to make sure the hotel is aware to receive them. The hotel clerk will usually begin to prepare a shipping label that has carbon copies. They will fill out all the info so long as you show your destination reservation info. \n\n\\- I would come back later that evening or early the next morning with the bag(s) packed and ready to handover to the clerk. They would usually have the shipping label filled out and awaiting final details. They would measure your bags dimensions and refer to a shipping pricing table to arrive at the final shipping costs. Some hotels would ask for cash only for this transaction, others allowed me to put it on my card. From there, they take your payment and take your bags and you're done. They handle everything from there as far as getting your bag to the transport pickup. \n\nI never spoke with anyone at Yamato, i never paid anyone other than the hotel clerk handling the shipping label. The expectation is that the bag(s) would typically arrive in about 12 - 24hours. This was the case at all my hotels. \n\nWhen I check in to the destination hotel, i would give them a copy of the yamato shipping label and they would return my bag(s) back to me. Sometimes they were plastic wrapped for security, sometimes not.",

My boyfriend and I are going to Japan in October for ~15 nights with the same overall itinerary and similar interests- definitely saving this. \n\nWe actually just booked at Yama no Chaya for 2 nights so am curious if there were any other onsen ryokans in Hakone you were considering that in retrospect you think might have been better value / more worth the cost. \n\nWe have two hotels booked in Osaka that we\u2019re deciding between, one of which is Hotel the Flag (the other Fraser Residences in Namba), so your rave review is really helpful!",

Nara was a day trip so we stored almost everything in a station coin locker. \nIn Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto we didn't have as much issue with bringing larger suitcases on trains and subways, buses are not quite as easy. We did reserve the luggage seats on the shinkansen ahead of time.",

Dinner is at 6PM or 6:30PM which leaves you around 9PM onwards to enjoy any evening baths. \n\nWith that in mind, that basically leaves you from 10AM - 5:30PM to attempt to do the full loop from Tonasawa station &gt; Gora &gt; Suonzen &gt; Togendai &gt; Lake Ashi and then somehow back to the ryokan. If you try to complete the loop clockwise, there is no train back and you'll have to rely on a bus and potential traffic. You could also opt to reverse your path back up how you came. I think it is doable but you don't leave yourself a ton of flex room to take things slow.",

I just happen to have a inside guy that worked at a high-end Tokyo sushi restaurant that offered to have us tag along. That said, despite the wholesaler section of Toyosu not seemingly open for tourists -- we still saw a few roaming around with their luggage and cameras. I think if you can show up around 7-8AM, look/be asian, and stay out of the way of all the chaos, then you may be able to sneak in.",

Were any of the places you ate at kid friendly? If not, I may choose 1 or 2 and leave the kids with my sister (also travelling with us for most of the trip) for a kid-free meal.\n\nAlso for the Hakone leg, did the shinkansen from Osaka take you straight to Odawara or did you have to transfer somewhere? I was going to get the JR Pass purely for convenience with the kids but we\u2019ll just be breaking even so I might look into pre-purchasing the tickets the way you did it.\n\nThanks!",

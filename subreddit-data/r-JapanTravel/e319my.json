    "postText": "This will get lost in New but I really wanted to take the time and thank everyone on this sub that helped me out when I had questions, and thank you to Japan for being an utmost gracious, loving, and life changing host.\n\nI grew up very poor, dysfunctional and abusive parents, and surrounded by bad environments and horrible influences. I have been working myself to death these past four years straight, and at the age of 25 I decided to finally take the leap and travel overseas for the very first time, to Japan for two weeks. I had always adored the Japanese culture, mythology, religion, architecture, pop culture, influences, society, it all looked so amazing, and I mean this with utmost sincerity, Japan exceeded every single one of my expectations.\n\nI have been dealing with depression since early high school and have been extremely suicidal the past 6 months again, even started seeing a therapist which was a big deal to me. This trip, my very first time overseas, has singlehandedly given love to my heart and has made me want to continue on and ensure I find a way to do so. I'm currently writing this as I tear up happily, my emotions are all over the place, as I am preparing to leave for the airport later today to go back home in Australia.\n\nWords cannot express my gratitude to the people of Japan, despite me only knowing very few words of Japanese each and everyone of you made me feel welcome. I never once felt like I was a burden, or unwelcom. This made me want to explore more and more, fall depper in love with my surroundings, as it had been forever since I genuinely loved what surrounded me.\n\nI will never forget my first proper day in Japan, as I was heading to the Akihabara station to head home, I came across a busker known as Small Samurai, who was an absolutely beautiful violinist. No one knew, but I absolutely adore the violin, it makes me feel those deep emotions that most music can't, and to watch and listen to him play beautifully as it became dusk, I couldn't help but feel like I was in a state of pure bliss. I thanked him and made sure to gift him money for performing. Just something about seeing such a performance live all by chance on my first day in Japan, made me feel like a higher power really wanted me to be happy, and now I know how truly happy I can be I will strive to keep that feeling alive within myself.\n\nThis likely sounds rather generic and unimportant, but I really just wanted to tell someone how much my life has been changed by coming to Japan. Despite the trip being a short one and the fact I'm leaving for my flight home today, I will never forget my time here and will always keep my sentimental memories with me.\n\nThis trip saved my life, it has made me realise that I do deserve to be happy and I will try my hardest to stay happy.\n\nTo anyone contemplating a trip to Japan, do it. To anyone struggling within themselves, reach out. And to everyone, especially the people of Japan, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",

I didn't travel out too far from Tokyo as I didn't want to feel rushed and feel like I missed things, so I didn't get to see Osaka, Kyoto etc, but I don't have any regrets. My advice is take your time, take it all in, as there is so so so much beauty in every corner of Japan. My absolute favourite place was Taito, where they had Ueno Park. Such a blissful and happy open park with many trees, a small market in the middle with lots of food. Not to mention the park is home to many museums and shrines. I spent en entire day there visiting the museums, taking a break to walk through the park, and visit the shrines there. It was a truly melancholy experience. In all honesty I could go on for hours about what makes each prefecture amazing, which is why I am glad I took my time. You'll be so pleasantly surprised with what you stumble across, from feeling like the centre of the world atop the Tokyo Skytree, to finding a lost joy coming out of a train station into a brand new adventure. I really cannot express enough how amazing everything was.",

I really do think Japan holds a special place in the hearts of people who grew up in a broken family environments in a country (like the US, where I\u2019m from) where there is no real sense of community larger than your family. It is therapeutic to see a place that emphasizes so strongly finding your place in the larger society.

Not mad, I get it.\n\nHappiness is everything!\n\nI've been wanting to visit Japan since the early 90s when my cousins were stationed in Yokosuka, and it wasn't until 20+ years later when I joined the US Navy and got orders out there when I first landed in Japan! From 2013-2015 I was out there, made loads of videos, and at the end of 2015, I got out of the Navy and came back to America.\n\nI went back to school, but was constantly struggling to adjust to so much so fast, and I took a year and a half off in 2017 to figure myself out. I decided that I needed to get back to Japan, so I looked at how I could make that happen. Initially, I tried to get a study abroad program when I was in school, but because I was on the GI Bill, I couldn't use it unless it was explicitly for my degree (which it wasn't). So I then decided to push off Japan until after graduation.\n\nBut when I was away from school, one of my old shipmates got out of the Navy and got accepted into Temple in Tokyo right away. I asked him how he did it, and he explained that while the GI Bill can't fund studying abroad programs, you can use it to go to a foreign university, and that's what he did. So I decided to move in with my brother, go back to community college to rebuild my GPA, and apply to universities in Japan! At the end of the first summer semester, I had a 3.0 GPA and was accepted into Lakeland in Tokyo! I'll be moving back to Japan next month once this current semester/my visa paperwork is finished!\n\nIt's been 4 long years and I've gone through so much change personally, but I'm finally coming back to Japan!",

We are pretty close to fulfill that dream, but now I feel hesitation... I never flew by plane before, I've never been so far before, and now I feel afraid, that this trip will be to much for me/us to handle, that the language barrier will be the main problem to us (we are from Poland) and we get lost or something, won't be able to see all the places we want to see because of the lack of organisation skills... But when I read your post and it was your first trip too... Maybe we can handle it too.",

The whole thing was very daunting, I had no idea what to expect so I was rather stressed thinking about it all. Believe me when I say, the entire experience was great. If you are ever unsure, just ask someone around you, Japan especially has many people situated conveniently around their airports and train stations to help ensure you find your way, and I would say about 90% of the people I spoke with knew enough English to understand and help!\n\nOne of the most amazing feelings once it is all said and done, is knowing that you tackled something you were once unsure of, and through this experience you not only got to experience such a joyous adventure, but you also get to come home with knowledge and confidence knowing that you are now suited to handle all the things travelling throws at you.",

I'm focused on documenting people from a third world who happens to fall in love with Japanese Culture and visiting the country for the first time. Something kind of impossible to do because of living conditions and innumerable circumstances. Everyone deserves a chance like this one. I'm happy you were able to be like myself one of those people whose life will be changed forever by this experience. Congrats!!",

I think I\u2019ll try staying in a certain area to enjoy the sites and culture when I go next year. Then I\u2019ll just go back another time and visit a different area. I hope things continue to grow for you!",

You might still have a purpose to fulfill; who knows, perhaps this entry has saved lives, too!\n\nThe Japanese are known to make the most of what lands on their plates. They're not just a hardy people - they are always in search for meaning in everything. They don't discard what they think is unimportant; they make it important. It's these approaches to adversity that makes cultural immersion so important: you'd never know how others deal with the problems you have until you live their lives. Kudos to you for discovering this on your own!\n\nGambare!",

I've been to Japan 5 times already I'm looking forward to number 6 sometime next year - there are just soooo many things to see and do, regardless of your interests. \n\nAs you've seen, it is an amazing country and I'm sure you'll be going back for another trip :)",

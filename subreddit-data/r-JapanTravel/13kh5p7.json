    "postText": "Hiya! I've been thinking about visiting Japan for the first time in June 2024, right after finishing university. Lurking in this subreddit has really helped me figure out where I'd like to go, and planning has been super exciting even though it's still a while away.\n\nI've got a tentative itinerary laid out below, open to changing the order of days/locations. I've tried to get a good mix of walking/hiking, eating a variety of different food, exploring the many shrines and temples (and collecting their respective Goshuin), and some anime-related shopping (preferably shows &lt;2010). Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated :)\n\n**Day 1: Landing at Narita**\n\n* Unsure if there'll be much free time this day, if there is then I'd probably visit the Tobacco and Salt Museum since it doesn't slot in that well in any of the other Tokyo days.\n* Travel to Kamakura where I'll be staying for two nights. The flight from London is pretty long and I thought it'd be nice to properly start the trip away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.\n\n**Day 2: Exploring Kamakura**\n\n* Early start, likely taking the train to Kita-Kamakura and working my way towards Tsurugaoka Hachiman via Engaku-ji, Meigetsu-in and so on. Hydrangea season is around this time of year so I'm hoping to see them in full bloom \\^\\^\n* Visit Hokokuji Temple + the bamboo forest, the pictures I've seen look simply magical\n* Explore central Kamakura (Komachidori street etc.) and Kotoku-in/Hasedera.\n\n**Day 3: Enoshima + travelling back to Tokyo**\n\n* Taking the Enoden down to Enoshima to visit the island, shrine and sea candle.\n* See Enoshima Aquarium and maybe stroll along the beach if the weather's nice.\n* Head back to Tokyo where I'll stay the next few days. I was thinking of staying around Ueno\n\n**Day 4: Asakusa + Akihabara**\n\n* Senso-ji/Asakusa shrine in the morning\n* Taking the train to Ueno station, then walking down through Ameyoko for some snacks and then Aki-Oka.\n* Spend the rest of the afternoon in Akihabara, maybe kill some time at Hitachino Brewing Lab.\n\n**Day 5**: **TeamLab Borderless + Shibuya/Shinjuku**\n\n* Assuming it's reopened by then and I can get tickets, Borderless in the morning as well as Mori Art Museum.\n* Lunch and shopping around Shibuya before walking up towards Yoyogi Park and Meiji Jingu.\n* I'd like to get drinks in Shinjuku - Omoide Yokocho or wherever, but not sure what to do until then. Perhaps Harajuku?\n\n**Day 6: Ikebukuro, Nakano Broadway + Shinkansen to Kyoto**\n\n* The Evangelion Store and a Pokemon center are located in Sunshine City so I have to go there :P might not spend too long apart from those stores though\n* Gonna hunt down all kinds of merch in Nakano Broadway. I REALLY want some Hellsing-related products.\n* Shinkansen to Kyoto. Was thinking it'd be nice to drop off my bags at my accommodation and head out to Fushimi Inari.\n\n**Day 7: Kiyomizudera, Kodaiji, Shogunzuka and Gion**\n\n* Pretty standard Kiyomizudera start, walk down through Sannen/Ninenzaka towards Kodaiji and Maruyama Park.\n* Visit Chion-in and hike up towards the Shogunzuka viewpoint.\n* Head back down, visit Yasaka shrine then walk around Gion at night.\n\n**Day 8: Northeastern Kyoto**\n\n* Maybe Shimogamo-jinja? It's kinda out of the way but looks so nice. Would take the bus towards Ginkakuji afterwards.\n* Philosopher's Walk down to Nanzen-ji, maybe Shore-in too?\n* Evening in Pontocho Alley\n\n**Day 9: Day trip to Uji/Nara**\n\n* Quick pitstop at Uji to see Byodo-in and try the famed matcha tea.\n* Rest of the day in Nara\n\n**Day 10: Return flight from KIX**\n\n* Might have time to see Nishiki market in the morning.\n\nQuick question - is there anything you'd recommend **doing** while in Tokyo/Kyoto? I think I saw another itinerary mention cooking classes which sounded really nice. Would be down to extend the trip if something like this was available.\n\nSorry for the long post, this whole thing has been on my mind for a while and if I can figure out an itinerary I'm relatively happy with, I'd be able to leave this on the backburner until closer to the date. Thanks everyone!",

I just thought it was charming and had a lot of character.\n\nAnd quiet- I was almost the only person around (which could be because of my timing). But everyone I did encounter was so friendly and welcoming. It's nice to see it mentioned on this sub. Maybe I'll revisit when I get to go back to Japan.",

I really wanted to go but wasn't sure how to fit it into the planned itinerary. It'll probably have to wait for next time, but thanks again for the recommendations \\^\\^",

You'll get to Nakano 2-3 pm, and spend 2-3 hours there hunting things down. You won't get to Kyoto til late. Fushimi Inari is kind of spooky at night, but you'll avoid the crowds (if you even have energy left to go to the top).",

I might move Ikebukuro to the evening of day 5 and drop drinking in Shinjuku since there are probably plenty of izakayas elsewhere. That makes Day 6 a bit more relaxed.\n\nYeah the plan is to go up Fushimi Inari after sundown, should be nice and peaceful without the crowds like you said.",

            "comment": "Looks great!\n\n  \nDay 4 - Seems a little light to me. Asakusa can be explored early and may take just few hours, Akihabara - will take you say 3 hours. It leaves you the entire afternoon/evening free. Idea is to shift either Shibuya (Shibuya Sky) or Shinjuku here (Omeida Yokocho, Tokyo Kabukicho tower, etc) or explore other area like Ginza or Roponggi.\n\n  \nDay 5 - If you are able to shift one of them here - you can explore Odaiba area more - there is Joypolis here, Tokyo Trick museum, Gundam store, or even go to Tsujiki (if any interest to go to fish market?).  You can spend the later part of the aternoon either in Shibuya or Shinjuku\n\n  \nDay 6 - Would be impossible to hit all the spots. Sunshine City opens around 10AM, Nakano Broadway opens around noon. What time are you planning to leave to Kyoto? (mind you it is 3.5 hrs journey).  -- even if you leave Nakano around 2PM, you'll get to Kyoto closer to 6PM. By time you get to Fushini Inari - it will be dark. A little creepy perhaps to hike it at night (unless that is your intention?)",

                    "comment": "I think day 4 is perfectly fine and has a lot of flexibility. If they're into anime and want to buy merch, they can easily spend an entire day in Akihabara, despite what the subreddit likes to say about that part of Tokyo. \n\nIt all depends on what they're after in Asakusa. Just Sensoji? Checking Nakamise? Getting their goshuin? If it's just to see Sensoji, I'd even recommend to go to Akihabara at around 10-11 because that's when shops usually open, there aren't as many people there so shopping around will be far easier and it would leave Asakusa for the evening. Especially late evenings there are the best since the crowds are pretty much gone at 10-11pm. On top of that, they could then also take a stroll along Sumida afterwards or even before.",

Firstly, thank you for the pointers ^(\\^\\^)\n\nRegarding day 4, the idea was to go nice and early to Senso-ji to pray and collect goshuin - not too bothered about missing the stalls on Nakamise. You're probably right about spending too long in Akiha, was lowkey thinking the same when planning. I've heard that the merch here leans more towards newer animanga, is that the case? Could potentially move the drinking in Shinjuku plan to this day like you said.\n\nOdaiba doesn't really interest me, sorry. Originally I considered a half day here due to TeamLab Planets but with Borderless reopening, I don't really see a reason to go.\n\nYou're right about Day 6. In another comment I mentioned moving Ikebukuro to the evening of Day 5 since it's just a few stores I wanted to visit, although that doesn't fix the problem of Nakano opening at 12. Bit stuck here. I'd probably leave for Kyoto around 4ish? Google maps says it's around 2.5 hours on the bullet train from Tokyo station. \n\nmhm the intention was to go to Fushimi Inari at night :)",

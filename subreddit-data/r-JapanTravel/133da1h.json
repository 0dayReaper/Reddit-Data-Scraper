They said they have shots\n\nAnd also they work with them everyday so how would they have rabies\n\nI get anxious a lot\u2026.. so i guess itd be nice to know other people\u2019s opinions! \n\nEspecially because it\u2019s a different country from the United States I don\u2019t know if i should be concerned lol. \n\nIt also didn\u2019t draw blood, just lightly scratched my finger with its teeth, like i guess it only broke the top layer of skin?",

I don\u2019t understand how it is ethically more wrong\n\nIn fact I think it\u2019s more likely you had a huge cognitive dissonance regarding this and is why you can\u2019t come up with an argument for why it\u2019s more wrong",

In all honesty it just sounds like you\u2019re trying to justify these unethical cafes, most of the time these animals live in horrible conditions without any enrichment or proper care and food. In fact, people can be upset about both of these things at the same time. You\u2019re speaking as if you know me personally and how and what I eat lol",

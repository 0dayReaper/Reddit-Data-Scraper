    "postText": "Hey folks! A few friends and I are planning a week long road trip all throughout Hokkaido this coming late July. There is one day where we plan to drive from Wakkanai (northern-most point) to Abashiri/Nemuro, preferably Nemuro because we want to see the sunrise at Cape Nosappu the next morning. My question is if anyone knows any cool spots/towns along the eastern coast along the way. It'll basically be a scenic driving day but we can stop every now and then to take in some sights and get food.   \nWe will also spend the next 2 days going from Nemuro to Hakodate with a planned stop in Noboribetsu for Jigokudani and onsen. Any fun eastern Hokkaido ideas would be greatly appreciated! \n\nThanks!",

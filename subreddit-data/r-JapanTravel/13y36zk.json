    "postText": "Hello all - This is my second time in Japan and I'm planning to explore places outside of Tokyo this time. \n\n**What bus / train pass do I need to get?** I look up my routes on Google map and most trips require taking local buses, and just a few Shinkansen here and there. Also it seems like the JR pass is best for people who have a limited amount of time in Japan. But I'm going for almost 2 months so it doesn't seem like an economical option. \n\nI also looked into the **Shoryudo bus pass** but couldn't figure out which bus it covers based on Google Maps. Can someone help?\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n**===== ITINERARY =====**\n\n**June 18:** Arrive in Tokyo\n\n**19-21 June:** Kanazawa \n\n* Exploring Kanazawa\n* Shirakawa-go\n\n**21-23 June:** Takayama\n\n* Exploring Takayama\n* Gujo Hachiman\n\n**23-25 June:** Nagoya\n\n**25 June - 14 Jul:** Osaka\n\n* Osaka Aizen festival\n* Kyoto Umekoji Park Handicrafts Market\n* Kyoto Mizu Matsuri\n* Kyoto Heian Raku Ichi Market \n* Tanabata festival @ Okawa river\n* Just randomly exploring \n\n**14-18 Jul:** Kyoto\n\n* Hyakumanben tedukuri ichi flea market\n* Kyoto Gion Matsuri\n\n**18-26 Jul:** Osaka\n\n* Toji Kobo market\n* Kyoto / Motomiya festival Fushimi Inari Taisha\n* Osaka / Tenjin Matsuri @ Osaka Tenmangu\n* Kyoto Ennichi market\n* Maybe Nara\n\n**26 Jul - 3 Aug:** Tokyo\n\n*  Tokyo Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival \n* Kawagoe\n* Kamamura \n* Just randomly exploring Tokyo\n\nThanks all for your help!",

I attempted to submit a very similar plea for assistance for our month+ fall trip but for some strange reason, it got taken down.  Yes, it really does seem like the nationwide JR passes favor travelers on a more frenzied pace.  And it gets fairly confusing when I try to navigate the various regional passes.  \n\nWe\u2019re currently leaning towards waving the white flag and simply buying the 21 day JR passes - even though it looks to be, at best, a wash.  And like you, we\u2019ll be there prior to the announced October price hike.",

            "comment": "Hi, most passes are only valid for a short time period (3-7 days). Most likely they won't be of any use to you as you stay longer in certain areas.\n\nFor our trip, I looked at the japanguide website for info on regional passes. I just did a quick look for you guys, but maybe the JR kansai-hokuriku pass would fit your needs? It has a 7 day validity. Pls. Read the info on the website yourself though.\n\nhttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html\n\nWe also visited the Japan alps (takayama/kamikochi/Matsumoto) and I also tried to look for good travel passes. The main websites for travel in this area are alpico and nouhibus. In the end, the passes they offered didn't fit our needs so we paid for all the train/bus tickets separately. \nhttps://www.alpico.co.jp/en/\nhttps://www.nouhibus.co.jp/english/\n\nBuying train ticket and bustickets is pretty easy to do in Japan. The service desks there are very helpful. I wouldn't waste my money on a JR national pass.\n\nJust some comments on your intinerary. \nWhy would you travel to kyoto for daytrips from Osaka while also staying in Kyoto afterwards? Can't you just stay longer in Kyoto instead of Osaka? There is so much to see in Kyoto, so you could definitely stay there longer.",

            "comment": "Day 3 - Consider doing Nara as a day trip if it's free. Going from Koyasan to Nara will take time so if you do it on Day 5 you may not reach Nara until lunchtime.  \n\nDay 5 - Head straight to Kyoto. If you didn't do Nara on Day 3 you can do it on Day 6?\n\nDay 12 - If travelling from Kanazawa you might not make it on time for the morning markets.\n\nDay 13 - It takes around 5 hours to get to Tokyo from Takayama so you might struggle to do all those things in the afternoon as they aren't too close. Your day 14 is a bit light so you can add some of these things here.",

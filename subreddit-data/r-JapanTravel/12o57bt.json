    "postText": " \n\nHi there!\n\nMy girlfriend and I are going to Japan for 28 days. This will be our first time in Japan.\n\nWe are both pretty chilled out travellers from Switzerland. For us, quality comes before quantity and it's absolutely fine if we don't get to see everything. I have made a rough plan for this trip. Hopefully you can give me some tips for my planning.\n\nFor me, it's hard to tell if the days are too packed or not packed enough. We are trying to avoid \"stressful\" days where we have to tick off everything that was planned. We don't want to rush through everything.\n\nWhich days do you think are too full?  \nOr what are indicators that a day to too full packed?\n\nThank you in advance for your time!!!\n\n**9.5**\n\nAirport Narita at 1305\n\n* Buy Sim card\n* Buy suica card\n* Buy shinkansen tickets to Osaka\n\nTo Osaka\n\n* Get to the hotel\n* Dinner\n\n**10.5**\n\nOsaka\n\n* Get Osaka Amazing Passes [https://www.osp.osaka-info.jp/en/](https://www.osp.osaka-info.jp/en/)\n* Osaka Castle\n* Kuromon Ichiba Market\n* Shitenn\u014d-ji\n* Harukas 300\n* Ts\u016btenkaku\n* Dotonburi\n* Hozenji Yokocho\n\n**11.5**\n\nOsaka\n\n* Universal Studio\n\n**12.5**\n\nOsaka - Daytrip Himeji and Kobe\n\n* Daytrip to Himeji\n* Tegarayama Central Park\n* Bach to Kobe\n* TBD\n\n**13.5**\n\nOsaka\n\n* Osaka Aquarium\n* Katsuoji\n\n**14.5**\n\nOsaka to Hiroshima\n\n* Onomichi\n\n**15.5**\n\nHiroshima\n\n* Hiroshiam Castle\n* shukkeien garden\n* Downtown\n* Peace park\n\n**16.5**\n\nHiroshima\n\n* Mazda Museum\n* chilling\n\n**17.5**\n\nHiroshima - Daytrip Miyajima\n\n* Itsukushima Shrine\n* Daisho-in Temple\n* Walking trail to mount misen.\n\n**18.5**\n\nHiroshima - Kyoto\n\n* Shimogama\n* T\u014d-ji\n* Higashi Hongan-ji\n\n**19.5**\n\nKyoto\n\n* Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\n* Tenryuji Temple\n* Kameyama Park\n* Iwatayama Monkey Park\n* Kimono Forest\n* Arashiyama Park\n\n**20.5**\n\nKyoto\n\n* Kinkaku-ji\n* Nij\u014d Castle\n* Nishiki-Marked\n* Heian-jing\u016b\n* Kyoto Imperial Palace\n\n**21.5**\n\nKyoto\n\n* Fushimi Inari-taishi\n* Castle Fushimi\n\n**22.5**\n\nKyoto - Daytrip Nara\n\n* T\u014ddai-ji\n* Nara Park\n* Botanical Garden\n\n**23.5**\n\nKyoto\n\n* Yasaka Shrine\n* Maruyama Park\n* Kiyomizu-dera\n* Byodo-in Temple\n* Daigo-ji\n\n**24.5**\n\nKyoto - Kawaguchiko\n\n**25.5**\n\nKawaguchiko\n\nRyokan,chill and explore surrounding\n\n**26.5**\n\nKawaguchiko - Tokyo\n\n* teamLab Planets\n\n**27.5**\n\nToyko\n\n* Tokyo Skytree\n* Asakusa\n* Sensoji\n* Rikugien\n* Ueno Park\n* Sugamo\n* Ameyoko\n\n**28.5**\n\nToyko - Daytrip Yokohama\n\n* Gundam\n* Ramen Museum\n* Chinatown\n* Sankeien Garden\n\n**29.5**\n\nToyko\n\n* Meiji Shrien\n* Shibuya\n* Shinjuku\n* Harajuku\n* Shinjuku park\n\n**30.5**\n\nToyko\n\n* Disneyland\n\n**31.5**\n\nToyko\n\n* Roppongi\n* Roppongi hills\n* Sengakuji Temple\n* Tokyo Tower\n* Zojoji Temple\n\n**1.6**\n\nToyko\n\n* Tsukiji Market\n* Akihabara\n* Koishikawa Korakuen\n* Imperial Palace\n* Yasukuni Shrine\n* Kanda\n* Ginza and Yurakucho\n\n**2.6**\n\nToyko - Daytrip Nikko\n\n* Toshagu Shrine\n\n**3.6**\n\nTokyo Spare Day\n\n**4.6**\n\nToyko Spare Day\n\n**5.6**\n\nToyko - Spare Day\n\nFlight back to Switzerland",

There's heaps of stuff to do there like the Open Air Museum which I would totally recommend.\n\nSince you're going to Ueno Park there's a few museums there as well which you're probably aware of. If you guys like art the modern art museum is great.",

We stayed two nights and it was our favorite place we visited by far (we also went to Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo). \n\nThere is the Hakone Loop which is a blast, it is fun to do and you can get great views of Mt. Fuji. There are also nice hiking trails, relaxing onsen (hot spring baths) and some museums. It is beautiful. \n\nIf you decide to go, try to plan your visit during weekdays as it is quite busy during a weekend. The Hakone Free Pass is a good deal if you plan to do the loop, and makes it even more convenient as you don't need to buy any separate tickets.",

I honestly don\u2019t know where to begin since you have 30 days yet somehow you made it feel like you\u2019re there for a week lol.\n\nSpace things out better especially in Tokyo. One to two districts a day. For example you have Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Harajuku which sounds like hell. Most people do Harajuku then Shibuya.",

    "postText": "Since I used this subreddit a lot in the planning process, I wanted to do a write-up of my experience. Also happy to answer any questions about my trip! \n\n**Trip Report:** \n\n**Background:** Was on a trip with my roommate. I had been to Tokyo for a week last year, he had never been before. We both wanted to try great restaurants, find a lot of whiskey (we both love whiskey), and experience Japan. We spoke limited Japanese (hello, thank you, excuse me, etc). We said that this was a \"yes\" trip, meaning that our default response would be yes, whether to an experience, food, a night out, etc. We also have a particular way of vacationing: only plan 1 major thing per day, and shoot for 1-2 hours before dinner to rest/relax at the hotel. I know this isn't everyone's jam, especially when it comes to a place like Japan, but I think it helped us a lot to not get burned out on the trip. \n\n**When:** June 14-28, the rainy season. We got incredibly lucky and only got drizzled on once for the entire trip. Weather was awesome, not too hot either (most days in the high 70s F). \n\n**Costs:** Our total came out to just around 5,300 USD each, not including flights. This breaks down to:\n\n* Hotels: 2200\n* Transportation: 500\n* Food/Drink: 1900\n* Miscellaneous (snacks, drinks, admission prices, etc): 300\n* Whiskey: 400\n* Flights: Used 70k United points for a round trip direct flight from Newark to Narita. Great value. \n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* Best High End Food: Masuda (Kaiseki), Sushi Suzu\n* Best Low End Food: Tonkatsu Taihou, Tenkaippin Ramen, Mizuno Okonomiyaki\n* Best Attractions: Teamlab Borderless, Kiyomizu-dera temple, Akihabara, Dotonbori\n* Best Bars: Elixir K (Osaka), Rum and Whiskey (Kyoto)\n* Biggest Disappointments: Tsukiji Fish Market\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone! Japan is likely very different than your home culture, but that's a great part about it. The most fun we had was in spontaneous planning and in small interactions struggling through the language barrier. Osusume (recommended) was our go to in restaurants and bars, and we tried some awesome things we wouldn't have. \n* All food is great, high-end and low-end. I think we would've actually done 1-2 less high end places, or at least spaced them out better. \n* Get a basic fare when traveling on the shinkansen! We ended up messing up our tickets and almost missed our train. If you want to be safe, buy from a ticket agent instead of a machine. \n* For me personally, 3 days in Osaka was plenty and 3 days in Kyoto was not enough. And you could spend weeks/months in Tokyo. \n* Got a pocket WiFi for the two weeks for 100 dollars. Amazing value. Highly recommend, though make sure to charge as much as possible. \n\nRead on for a very detailed trip report. \n\n**Day 1**\n\n* We took the Narita Express from the airport since it fit the route to our hotel better. In our post flight daze, we left our garment bags on the train. When we realized it about 5 minutes into our walked, we rushed back to find that they were already in the information booth. All I know is if I had lost that on public transportation in New York, no way I\u2019m getting that back for days.  \n* After dropping our stuff off at our hotel (Capitol Hotel Tokyu), we went to Sushi zanmai for dinner. We ordered the sushi special plus the tuna plate five ways. It was delicious. The cheap to mid level sushi in Japan is just on a whole other level. \n* Finally, we walked around Akasaka as it\u2019s near our hotel. Walked past a great shrine (Hie Shrine), which had some kind of celebration/ritual going on which was cool to see.\n* We found a whiskey bar on the third floor of an office building, Bar Algernon. Had two great bourbons and then realized that we were both about to fall asleep at our table. We were asleep by 8:30. \n\n**Day 2**\n\n* Wide awake at 2am, so browsed the web for things to do.  We hit a coffee shop in the morning for a chocolate croissant and coffee. \n* With some time to burn before a sushi reservation for lunch, we went to our hotel pool and hot tub and relaxed for a bit. \n* We went to Sushi Kanesaka for lunch, and we had the same chef as I had one year ago. Food was excellent. \n* In the afternoon, we walked from our hotel to Meiji shrine then Shibuya crossing. Lots of great energy, and it was my roommates first time seeing the crossing so that was fun.  \n* For dinner, we went to. Tonkatsu Taihou in Meguro. Incredible, we had a very nice old lady who took our order and looked up Japanese translations for us. This was the kind of place that does a few dishes, but does them extremely well. \n* Next, we wandered into a nearby izakaya. It was super busy, and we ended up sitting next to two older women who constantly shared their dishes with us. They did not speak English but were very friendly. It was an awesome introduction to the izakaya environment.  \n\n**Day 3**\n\n* After a late night, we slept in (luckily starting to kick the jet lag). We got ramen in Akasaka. Quite delicious, chili spice sauce provided as an add on was a must, added a great kick. \n* Through unfortunate planning on my part, we went to the Edo Museum which was closed since it was a Monday. We decided to walk to Akihabara from there to see more of the city. Wow. What a scene. As my roommate described \u201cthis is what Tokyo is like in the movies\u201d. We did an arcade, a sex store (highly recommend M\u2019s), and a good walk through the district. \n* We then went on a liquor hunt, after 6 shops we finally found some Blantons. Through this we saw a bunch of different neighborhoods so time was well spent.\n* Dinner was Yakiniku Jumbo Hanare. Ordered multiple things through recommendation of our waiter/cook. Osusume is a must! The filet (chateaubriand cut) was the best steak I\u2019ve ever had. Our waiter/cook was awesome as well, added a lot to our experience. \n* Finished the night by opening up the Blanton's. Not my favorite although pretty good. There\u2019s definitely an over hype about this but nonetheless a good bottle. The view from the hotel was great, looked over Akasaka.\n\n**Day 4**\n\n* We went back to the Edo Tokyo museum after confirming it was indeed open. Was cool to see the history and contrast against modern day period. \n* For lunch, we went to Ichiran. While I think there is a hype about Ichiran, it was really excellent \u2013 the broth quite nice.  \n* We went on another whiskey hunt to see if we could find some more rare bottles. Scotch is actually much cheaper in Japan than the US, which was great for some quality pick-ups. \n* We started the night at Cocktail Gastronomy, where a super friendly bartender took us through some custom cocktails. We also discussed with him the state of Japanese whiskey, and how increasing demand and dwindling supply has lead to a really bad state of things. \n* For dinner, we went to Sushi Shin. The setup is 8 people sitting at the bar with one table of two. Everyone is served courses at the same time. The best way I could describe it is being invited into someone\u2019s home for an awesome dinner. The one downside is pacing was pretty erratic, and the overall dinner took 2.5-3 hours. \n* We went to These, a library bar to finish the night. The cocktails were quite good, and the ambience was great. \n\n**Day 5**\n\n* Tsukiji to start the day. I can\u2019t recommend it, it has gotten way worse than last year when I visited before Toyosu was opened. Got some sushi, which was one of the worst meals of the trip though still quite good.  \n* Next, we went to Teamlab Borderless. Wow. Really cool. Lot of experiences, lot of nice visuals. I\u2019d recommend buying tickets online.  \n* From there, we went to Shinjuku. We stopped at a ramen place for lunch, Tenkaippin. This was probably my favorite ramen of the trip. It was really rich and almost creamy. We then went on a search for a Pablo Mini for dessert, which is this small cheesecake. Surprisingly hard to find in Shinjuku station. We rounded out the afternoon by browsing in a Don Quijote. \n* For dinner, we went to Ishibashi, which was a traditional eel place. I\u2019d never had just eel as a main dish, it\u2019s always been within a sushi menu. It was really delicious.  It was a place where you sat on the floor, which wasn\u2019t my favorite.\n* We ended the night at a few Izakayas in Akasaka. As it seems like a heavily business district, it was really lively, especially as compared to Saturday when it was quite dead. Since we were taking the train the next morning, we took it pretty easy. \n\n**Day 6**\n\n* As we got our fares, we had a mishap with the basic fare in addition to the express. Though not incredibly clear from the machines, both a basic fare and then your shinkansen ticket is needed for the purchase. \n* We had a fish based ramen for lunch right near the train station. Quite delicious, much lighter than the other places we\u2019d been to. \n* We stayed at Yamanochaya for the night. This portion of the trip was all about relaxing in between the cities in our trip, so we ended up not even going to explore Hakone. Instead, we used our onsen and took it very easy. The dinner was a kaiseki, which was great, but I think both of us were a little exhausted from so many great dinners in a row. \n\n**Day 7**\n\n* First thing we did on waking up was a morning onsen session. What a great way to wake up. We had a mishap with the scheduling of trains trains, ended up taking a shinkansen with more stops. It probably would\u2019ve been worth it to schedule a little better. We decided to try a green car, which was significantly nicer, especially as we\u2019re both a bit taller. Definitely not necessary to do, but we both liked it for the longer ride. \n* We arrived in Osaka. We explored around our hotel (Osaka Marriott Miyako) and went to Gojunoto, a buddhist temple. There was a second hand market outside the temple, which was fun to browse through.  \n* For dinner we went to Masuda, a kaiseki place. Best meal of the trip overall. Sake was incredible, every dish was between incredible and best version of that dish I\u2019ve had. Nice rapport with the chef, showed us some pictures in an encyclopedia of food for some of the more exotic pieces. We also talked with some of the prep chefs about baseball in Japan.  \n* To end the night, we went to Dotonbori. We decided to make our way back to our hotel by stopping at izakayas along the way. This was the drunkest I got all trip, spilled all over my shirt when we got ramen. We also called some people, including my parents, which was great.  \n\n**Day 8**\n\n* Ichiran to start the day, good way to kick the hangover. \n* Walked to Osaka castle from our hotel. Osaka as a city is not very picturesque, but the castle/grounds were awesome. We didn\u2019t end up going into the castle itself, but the grounds were plenty to enjoy it. \n* We then went into the department store under our hotel. We went to the big ass food court with a bunch of stands, had some tonkatsu, walked around the stores for a bit. The sweets section was almost as big as the rest of the food court. \n* For dinner, we went to tayu tayu in Kitashinchi, a pork yakitori place. Really delicious, did a chefs special tasting of 7 different kinds so tried things like heart artery, large intestine, and tongue. The best was pork baby back ribs, which had onion in the skewer as well. \n* Afterwards stumbled upon an awesome bar combo. First was Bar Juniper, which we learned later was a gin bar, but I saw some whiskey when I walked in so I ordered peaty Japanese whiskey. They had a sister bar which they brought the bottles from for me to try. What incredible service. The whiskies themselves were Japanese distillery exclusives, so as a whiskey lover it was cool to try something that I may not again. We then went to the sister bar, Elixir K, and had some of the most fun at a whiskey bar I\u2019ve had. The old bartender was awesome, talked with us a lot about whiskey, and was incredibly cheap for the quality of whiskey we were tasting. It ended up being my favorite drinking night. \n* We swung Ichiran to finish the night. Twice in one day, though in my hungover state in the morning I was in no mood to enjoy it. It was delicious.  \n\n**Day 9**\n\n* Slept in and went to the department store market area for lunch. Got tonkatsu and it was very good. I think I like mustard as a condiment the best, though tonkatsu sauce is quite good too. \n* We went to the observation platform at the top of our hotel, the Harukas observation platform. We decided to do Edge the Harukas, where you literally lean out across the building\u2019s edge and look down from 60 floors up. Also what was nuts was this was 10 dollars. A similar attraction in New York would probably be 40-50. \n* Hit up the Osaka city museum and saw some very cool scrolls. The detail is incredible. We opted for the small pass, which I wouldn\u2019t recommend as it gives you access to a very small portion of the museum. \n* The night was about trying the three classic street foods. First takoyaki (Abeno Takoyaki Yamachan Namba), shit is hot as fuck but quite delicious. Okonomiyaki (Mizuno) for dinner, which was very rich but the flavors worked well together. We then went to Dotonbori to chill with a few drinks while we sat on the river, and had someone serenade us with You Raise Me Up on a karaoke machine. Finally, we ended. The night with kushikatsu (Daruma Kushikatsu). The fry on it was delicious, but it was almost too rich. I\u2019d rank them okonomiyaki, kushikatsu, and then takoyaki. \n\n**Day 10**\n\n* We took the train to Kyoto right from underneath our hotel, which was ideal. We checked into our hotel (Saka Hotel) and headed out into the city. \n* We got udon for lunch, the sweetness is a great contrast to the saltiness of ramen. It was almost too sweet, and very delicious. \n* We then went to Fushimi Inari which is quite the hike to the top. Our first experience with heavily touristed Japan, especially among the lower gates, but closer to the summit it wasn\u2019t as bad. It\u2019s a big hike, but not too difficult and was a good way to spend the day. \n* Next we went to Kiyomizu-dera which was unfortunately partially under construction. However, it was still fucking awesome. We also walked through some of the more classic Japanese streets to pass some time. I really, really liked Kyoto, which I wasn\u2019t expecting. I thought that the temples wouldn\u2019t do much for me and the tourism would be too much, but the latter was actually not too bad. \n* For dinner, we had no plans so got sushi. Next we hit up some whiskey bars. First was Bar Cordon Noir. Great selection though a bit stale of an environment. Next we went to Rum and Whiskey, which competes with Elixir K for my favorite bar experience. The bartender/owner is super passionate about both rum and whiskey. First time I\u2019ve had rum neat, and damn it is fine. I\u2019m going to start drinking more of it. \n\n**Day 11**\n\n* We started off the day at Nishiki market, was a nice covered outdoor market. My roommate commented he liked it more than the new Tsukiji market, which I\u2019d have to agree with. Got some ramen at ippudo which we both said is much better than the one in New York. \n* Next we went to the Yamazaki distillery. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t get tickets to the tour, but we did get to see the museum and tasting room. An awesome place for Japanese whiskey lovers, the tasting room was incredibly cheap. \n* For dinner we went to a sukiyaki place on the river, Moritaya Kiyamachi. Was very, very good, featured great meat and vegetables (who knew Japanese people even consumed these). \n\n**Day 12**\n\n* After grabbing some udon by our hotel, we took the bus out to Kinkaku-ji, the golden temple. It was pretty awesome, even with a fair amount of tourists there was a certain peace/tranquility about the place. We then went to Ryoan-ji to see the stone garden. At the end of the day, it's 12 stones in a small garden, but still cool. The grounds of this temple were also great. \n* We stopped by the Kyoto Imperial Palace on the way back to our hotel. It is so vast. The grounds and the temple are deceptively big.  \n* For dinner, we went to the izakaya Shimme. Luckily we sat down next to a very friendly salaryman who had lived in New York. He ended up ordering us everything, which was great because we had no idea where to start. A ton of grilled fish, some sashimi, some tempura, and a lot of good sake. \n* Overall, Kyoto was great and I need to go back there. \n\n**Day 13**\n\n* Got some great bento boxes in Kyoto station and then we were on the train back to Tokyo, again opted for the Green Car experience. We checked into our hotel, Candeo Hotel Roppongi. It was really nice. Though a lot smaller than the previous three, it was in a good location and had a really nice onsen on the top floor. \n* The day was about rounding out the whiskies we were going to bring back. We stopped by two previous stores that we had been to, Shinanoya in Ginza and Suzusake in Roppongi. These were the two best stores that we went to, in case anyone is in the market. In total, we brought back 12 bottles of whiskey. \n* We took it pretty easy in the afternoon as we both were a little worn out from the trip. Our final dinner was at Sushi Suzu which was the second best dinner of the trip and probably the best sushi dinner I\u2019ve ever had. Each piece was incredible, and the chef had great sake pairings to go along with them. We finished the night at an izakaya by our hotel, where we consumed far too many highballs. \n\n**Day 14**\n\n* The last day in Japan. We got Ichiran for lunch and went on one last walk to find a Pablo Mini. We ended up in this office building/lunch place, and since it was in the lunch hour (12:30), it was packed. Every place had lines out the door. \n* We then headed to Narita, picked up some nice items at Duty Free, and boarded our flight home. What a trip.",

It does get very good reviews, including in this subreddit. I\u2019d recommend it to anyone, but I think once was enough for me. Also, small point but food was good but not great. Could\u2019ve been that particular night though.",

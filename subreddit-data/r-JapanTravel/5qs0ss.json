We had a traditional room with a full service dinner.  It was ~400 USD with dinner, without would have been about 350\nUSD.  But the public onsens were phenomenal as well in the hotel.  \n\nIf you take the cable car for less than $6 USD a person you can get amazing views of the mountain.  We had no issues with weather seeing it. \n\nIn Tokyo, we stayed in Shinjuku at the Sunroute Higashi for $70 other nights.  Great budget hotel literally next to the station. \n\nMy wife is going to write a full recap of our 8 day trip.  We know zero Japanese and did a lot (including bar-hoping Golden Gai) with no issues.

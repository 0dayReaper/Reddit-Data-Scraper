And occasionally you might change plans and the flexibility is worth it.\n\nMy general glance at your plan is that your days are packed past what I find doable. You might want to fine tune your Kyoto plan, because you've got stuff that's close by on different days like Kinkaku-ji and Ryoan-ji.\n\nDay 11- You're going to Himeji and then back to Osaka and walking around and then moving on to Tokyo? Doesn't it make sense to get your Osaka plans done and then go Himeji - Tokyo?\n\nKOKE-DERA requires advance booking. Check on it now. I couldn't get a slot and I was looking three months in advance.",

What the JR pass normally does is make the user ignore other routes and prefer JR routes. Often using the subway or other train lines makes for faster travel, less working, less changeovers. I often see people take some of the worst routes to get from one place to another because they want to use their JR pass over paying a few hundred yen for a much route. \n\nWhen someone is only going between Tokyo and Osaka/Kyoto where the rail pass tends to be about break even with the Shinkansen, I generally recommend not getting the pass. You can take a faster Shinkansen to start with (and better experience overall) and you have the freedom to pick the best ways to get around without trying to optimize your pass. Especially in Kansai, the private lines often make more sense over the JR pass.",

Humans tend to behave irrationally quite a bit, but if you valued your time more than others, that\u2019s great. I think the closer someone is to breaking even the more incentive they feel to try get the most out of their pass and end up losing more than they gain. I\u2019ve seen it over and over and over again.\n\nYou are right that the Yamanote will take you where you want quite a bit of the time in Tokyo if you are hitting the big sites. Tokyo in particular is really good with the JR lines. Kansai area less so, but the loop line you mention hits a couple popular spots, depending on where you start from it\u2019s useful. \n\nI\u2019m not quite sure why you put faster in quotes. It is or isn\u2019t, but there also other reasons to take alternative routes than just speed.",

One day in Kyoto has you at both Fushimi Inari and Kinkaku-ji. Is it doable? Yeah but they're on opposite ends of Kyoto so you might feel exhausted.\n\n I would do Fushimi-Inari, Gion, Nishiki Market and wrap up the day at Kiyomizu-dera. There is a train near Fushimi Inari that takes you into Gion and then you have Nishiki a few blocks down one way, while Kiyomizu-dera is the other way. \n\nMy only other suggestion is to keep in mind how packed the subways get during certain times of the day, especially in Tokyo.",

If you like thrifting you will get more out of Shimokitazawa as they have so so many thrift and vintage stores. Harajuku I believe is mainly newer stores, although I think they have a couple used clothing stores.",

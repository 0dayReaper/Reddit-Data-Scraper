            "comment": "Hi!\n\nYou would need to move things around somewhat, but this should fit the bill for music:\n\n[https://www.inhamamatsu.com/art/innovation-road.php](https://www.inhamamatsu.com/art/innovation-road.php)\n\nYou can also do a tour of the Yamaha Factory and see how pianos are made.\n\nProbably it would make sense to move your Kyoto afternoon things for your arrival day to the afternoon of your Fushimi Inari day and instead stop in Hamamatsu on the way to Kyoto.\n\nIn terms of your current itinerary:\n\nMake sure to do the breakfast at the Atrium at the Tokyo Station Hotel.  It's so delicious.  My tween loves staying there and she loves the breakfast.\n\nMake sure you know how to get to Nijigen no mori, unless you are planning to rent a car and drive there.  I was clicking on some of the links on the official site about buses and some of the links don't take you to the schedule as promised. \n\nMy tween had a friend who tried to go in 2019 with their Dad.  The Dad is a little incompetent with directions, and really struggled to get there.  By the time they did get there, the park was closing and they had to race back to the front of the park to not miss the last bus back to Hyogo-ken, so they never really ended up doing anything.  I'm not  saying you can't go, but don't be like them.\n\nI did some of Yamanobe no Michi.  It's really lovely.  I would have done more, but it was super hot and humid and my tween just refused.  The Kintetsu to get to Sakurai runs quite frequently (I believe you have to go to Yamato-Yagi from Kyoto and then change to get to Sakurai) but the JR Sakurai line has trains once an hour at best.  \n\nI think on June 1 you will be hard pressed to do Himeji, Hiroshima and Miyajima all in one day.  \n\nGood luck!",

If it doesn't, my plan is to drop Miyajima.\n\nI am pretty worried about the Nijigen no mori daytrip. I've read several blogs with the same directions so I have my fingers crossed. My kids really want to go or I would have dropped it for sure after seeing how it isn't a straight forward trip :/",

I would make sure to give myself extra time  too.  I'm planning to wait until my daughter is better at Japanese, because I suspect all the activities are more fun if you can actually read and understand Japanese.\n\nJust have a plan and make sure everyone would not be too upset if something gets dropped.  Maybe spend some time finding out how often the train from Himeji goes to Hiroshima.  You don't want to waste time spending 40 minutes waiting around the train station.  Himeji is not a station you can easily do that.",

You can always try to find a couple of live houses in Kyoto and see if they have show and see if they by any chance sell tickets at the door.",

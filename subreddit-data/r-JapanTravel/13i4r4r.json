    "postText": "So we will hopefully be travelling on the Tohoku Shinkansen with our 3yo, who does not need a ticket. On the Tokaido/Sanyo line, not an issue, because he\u2019s free. On the Tohoku line, he\u2019s free - BUT all seats are reserved for Hayabusa. Does anyone know how to book for this? \nWe\u2019re hoping to have JR or JR east pass and planning enough range that the pass makes sense (Osaka to Nagoya to Tokyo return, plus up to Aomori). \nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Congratulations on finding something I don't think is covered by our wiki!.\n\nTickets for infants/toddler (under 6, or 5 years old rounded down to the year, so 5 years, 364 days is a toddler) are free, if the child is not occupying a seat only (\"lap baby\") and is travelling with a adult and you have only 1 child per adult.\n\nSo, you have a choice to make.  Will your child occupy a seat for the trip or will they sit on your lap the whole way?\n\nAs someone who has travelled with a child, I can tell you it isn't worth it to buy the ticket, at least for shorter hops (&lt;3 hrs) as you child will likely wander the train a bit, and when not they can just chill with you.\n\nIf your child will occupy their own seat, you will need to buy a child ticket.  The child ticket is 50% for everything except for the green car tickets (basic fare and super express).\n\nYou can use Eki-net for reservations online and you pickup your ticket in person at the station (at least you used to): https://www.eki-net.com/en/jreast-train-reservation/Top/Index?&amp;_ga=2.62624047.2097205682.1684152552-1372751854.1684152552#_gl=1*p51dwq*_ga*MTM3Mjc1MTg1NC4xNjg0MTUyNTUy*_ga_ZDNCJLPMZL*MTY4NDE1MjU1MS4xLjAuMTY4NDE1MjU1MS4wLjAuMA..",

I would actually book a seat on Hayabusa/Komachi, unless you only plan using it only for parts north of Sendai (and then Yamabiko).\n\nAlso another caveat: Hayabusa/Komachi is all reserved seats only for Tokyo to Morioka section.",

She was 5 1/2 and I don't travel with a partner, so it wasn't even like I could book 2 seats together and have her sit partially on both seats between us.  However, I didn't get her an IC card.  So when we took the Tozan private like in Hakone, I let her sit on my lap and same for any buses we used in Kyoto.  \n\nTo be upfront, I also use to buy her a seat when she was under 2 and flying on the plane.  It felt safer.  \n\nJapan is interesting because at 7 she counted as the second adult in the room at many hotel and those she didn't, she counts as a second adult now at 12.  Though to be fair in most hotels in the US there is no single rate, so kids staying free is less of a discount.",

If you do this, the middle seat will remain open and your toddler can sit there so long as no one else books it.  Outside of major holiday weeks like New Years\u2019s Week, Golden Week, or Obon it\u2019s very unlikely the Tohoku Shinkansen would be fully booked. Most travelers would not voluntarily choose to book a middle seat when the window and aisle are already reserved. You\u2019ll likely have a good chance the middle seat remains open and it\u2019s fine for your toddler to sit there then.",

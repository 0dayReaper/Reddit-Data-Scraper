    "postText": "One thing I see many foreign travelers don\u2019t understand on rail networks in Japan, despite the fact they might live in a big city and use public transportation every day, is that private railways are huge in Japan. \n\nFirst of all, JR is divided into 6 different companies (JR East, JR West and such) and the JR Pass (sold exclusively to foreign travelers) is pretty much the only ticket works on all six.\n\n\nThe key is JR is a just a part of public transportation in Japan.\n\nIn Tokyo, while JR has the biggest network, there are two subways companies and dozen of private railways companies.\nEach and all of them have its own railroad, trains, gates, fare and stations that work INDEPENDENTLY. \n\nShinjuku stations, for example, JR has its own  \u201cJR Shinjuku station\u201d.\n(You can go to a station like Shibuya and Harajuku)\n\nRight next to it, Odakyu railways (private) has its own \u201cOdakyu Shinjuku station\u201d.\n(You want to take Odakyu train when you go to Hakone)\n\nNext to it, Keio railways (private) has it own \u201cKeio Shinjuku station\u201d. (You want to take Keio if you want to go hiking at Mt. Takao)\n\nUnder ground, there are two subways companies, Tokyo Metro (private) and Toei Subway (owned by city of Tokyo). You want to take them when you go to area such as Roppongi or Asakusa.\n\nThose stations are all connected to each other, but owned and operated by different companies.\n\nFew blocks alway, Seibu railways (private) has \u201cSeibu Shinjuku station\u201d. \n\nAll together, locals call  \u201cShinjuku stations\u201d.\n\nWhat make navigating through the stations difficult is many of those railways companies built commercial facilities (department stores, hotels, shopping malls and such) above, around and under the station since its prime location for business. \n\nThat\u2019s why, Suica (a rechargeable fare card issued by JR) is revolutionary and highly recommended because it works on all transportation companies (trains, subways, buses, monorail, some taxi) in Tokyo and most transportations all over Japan.\n\nSo JR pass is a great saving if you ride expensive JR trains such as Shinkansen to go to long distance/multiple cities, but its not the best ticket to go to places within and around Tokyo since many areas aren\u2019t accessible by JR.\n\nSame goes to the subway pass. It\u2019s good saving if you only use subways. \n\n\u201cUnlimited rides\u201d sound so good but a train company only provides the information regard to their service.\n\n\n\nHistorically, private railways network is much more developed in Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe).\n\nTechnically, JR has been privatized (for 30 years) but still Japanese distinguish JR and private.\n(Suica = issued by JR East, Pasmo = issued by private railways and bus association)\n\nOnce you understand this concept, not only using trains in Japan gets easier, but also help you plan and enjoy \u201cthe train culture\u201d in Japan.",

The only difference between any of the IC cards I was able to find was where you had to return them.\n\nUse hyperdia to do the math for your trip regarding JR pass. We figured out if you did a round trip on the Shinkasen on the 1 week pass you come out ahead. Most people here do a few days in Tokyo then activate their pass, go to Kyoto/Osaka and back. We flew into Tokyo and left from Osaka two weeks later and we ended up paying out of pocket because it didn't make sense to do the pass.",

If you can time your trip so that the JR pass covers most of your inter-city travel, it'll be great. Like I was travelling in Tokyo first, then went around the country, then spent my last few days in Tokyo, so the JR pass covers the parts I was travelling around. It was a 2-week JR pass, for my 3 week long travel. \n\nThat being said, the Suica/PassMo/PitaPa/etc is useful to get around the non-JR metros. Also I think PitaPa would work in other cities in most cases but I can't confirm that. I can say my Suica card works in Osaka and Hiroshima.",

It has to be from a parent machine. Not a big deal, just keep an eye on how much you recharge in your final days. I have some money on mine but I can always visit again and use it.",

Though, JR East could combine with Hokkaido and JR West could combine with JR Shikoku and no one would notice IMO.\n\nBTW, Keio has 2 Shinjuku stations.\n\n&gt;Historically, private railways network is much more developed in Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe).\n\nJust want to add that this is because before privatisation, JNR neglect commuter/metro traffic in non-Tokyo area.\n\n&gt;Once you understand this concept, trains/stations in Japan get clear.\n\nOne thing I want to add that also seems to confuse many is that the metro/commuter/intercity concept is not clearly divided as in the US. JR operates both metro-like service (Yamanote Line ,etc.), commuter service, and long distance intercity service. Private railway is also a mix of those services, too.\n\nThis also makes JR fare rule more complicated than it should be, but tourists probably don't really need to know the detail (the weird rules are usually only exploit only by train maniac)",

Instead of all trains being run by one company, Tokyo has a plethora of rail companies including JR, 2 subway systems, numerous private train companies (e.g. Keio, Keisei, Odakyu), as well as automated people movers and monorails - each company generally only provides information on their own services so you need to use 3rd party apps/websites to find all transport options - Google Maps and Hyperdia http://www.hyperdia.com/en/sp/ are great for that. \n\nInstead of just the Octopus card in HK, there are multiple IC cards sold by different transport operators - in Tokyo you get Suica from JR or Pasmo from other companies, but the cards all work the same at all transport operators throughout Japan where IC cards are in use (smaller towns &amp; non-urban areas generally don\u2019t use IC cards). \n\nOctopus cards are accepted at all convenience stores, fast food chains, etc throughout HK, while in Japan IC card use at shops is nowhere near as widespread yet.",

Just enter your location and destination and it will calculate how much it will take to get there. You can even select which line you want to take. \n\nYou can also scan and add your suica card to Navitime.\nOnce scanned, it will track your travel history and the amount your trips cost, plus it keeps track of your remaining card balance.

Buy the day pass for whatever city you're in. You're usually good to go most of the time.\n\n- keep your suica/Pasmo/icoca whatever card charged with some yen. If the gate rejects the day pass, no big deal, retrieve your day ticket and just beep yourself through with your rechargeable card. You start to remember what lines don't take the day pass as you use the trains. JR stations are good for it though and you'll use those a lot anyways.  Using the day pass first will cut down a lot on spending for transportation. You can write down how much you spent on the day passes per day and recharging the suica way less will make it easier to track. Though given cost of tickets and lodging imo at this point cost of transportation is basically a rounding error imo...\n\n- I'm not sure why you would avoid using the same line again in the same day?\n\nIf you don't already use Google maps in Japan, do it. It tells you when to leave stations and walk to another connected one, tells you the lines you're using and where to go to board, and if you check the lines as you go you can tell when and at which point you'll have to use the suica over the day pass.",

Its really messy and confusing to read with nothing of value added.\n\nIf anything... yes SUICA/Pasmo will make your life x1000000 easier while moving around public transport in japan. If you use google maps you get the \"best\" route. If you use Hyperdia you can get the best out of your \"JR PASS\". My country doesn't even have proper transport system and it was very easy to move around trains/buses/metro.",

All they need to know is that the easiest way to travel is to use the PASMO and SUICA, but PASMO is better as it has more utility - buying a combined monthly ticket to a particular station which reduces the overall price for example. I use this for ikebukuro and it\u2019s great. \n\nBut what you are ignoring is the fact that people buy the JR pass for the significant savings, which PASMO and Suica do not offer at all. A JR pass used correctly will most definitely save people a tonne of money if they are traveling by Shinkansen around japan and can access most places through the Yamanote line. \n\nSo it\u2019s a case by case basis but I\u2019m pretty sure people would obviously understand that they are different companies... I mean the signs are in English",

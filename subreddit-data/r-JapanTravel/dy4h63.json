    "postText": "I\u2019m a Norwegian dude who\u2019s always had a deep and abiding love for Japan - in particular onsen and bathing culture. I\u2019ve done about a dozen smaller trips over the years, but this October I decided to do my dream journey.\n\nI had such an amazing trip, and this subreddit helped a lot in the planning. I wanted to give back in whatever way I could, so here\u2019s the rundown if any of you want to do something similar:\n\n**THE PLAN**\n\nMy plan was to:\n\n* Travel solo for two weeks, all the way from Tokyo to Matsuyama via Kyushu Island (Even though I speak only 4-5 words of Japanese, poorly at that.)\n* Stay in a new hot spring village and ryokan every night\n* And most importantly: Hit up as many ONSEN each day as I could! (My goal was to hit at least 30 - a number I almost doubled by the end. I devised a rating system - more about that later.)\n\n[HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W1UuXiR3B55HeGCI4nSE6_mGGz9c6XMG&amp;usp=sharing) is my map of the overall route, which went:\n\nTokyo - Kusatsu - Shibu - Kanazawa - Kaga (Yamanaku, Awazu, Yamashiro) - Arima - Kinosaki - Kurashiki - Kumamoto - Kurokawa - Beppu - Unomachi - Matsuyama.\n\nIf you have any Qs about any specific place, don\u2019t hesitate to ask me!\n\n**PS:** Typhoon Hagibis hit and knocked out a crucial Shinkansen line 3 days before I left, which was of course just a *super* fun challenge and not stressful at all.\n\nI made homemade Google Maps of each region I was planning on visiting - as an example, [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Epi5w1dh-Z0V8vlJqwAqQ3ktv08zGDJc&amp;usp=sharing) is the one for Kyushu Island. (The little blue waves are the baths, the beds are my ryokan!)\n\nIf anyone wants, I\u2019ll share all the maps. They were made from me reading a billion travel books and websites for months and months in advance.\n\nAvoid Golden Week/Christmas/Sakura seasons for a lot of these villages - I think they get pretty crowded. I went off-season with many near-empty trains/buses/towns. Even in many onsen and ryokan I was completely alone - it was right after China's Golden Week, right before Winter/Christmas season, so mid-October was juuuust perfect. I still got to see incredible Autumn foliage, although that's even more beautiful right now in November.\n\n**BOOKINGS**\n\nI\u2019ll share a Google Doc with the full transport info at the end. I bought a two-week JR PASS from [HERE](https://www.jrailpass.com/), which meant I only spent 400 EUR total on almost all the transport total. (I also got a portable wifi from the same site - lifesaver.)\n\nPlane tickets were around 650 EUR direct from Amsterdam where I live, thanks to [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.jp/). Put up a price alert on there two months in advance.\n\nI booked all my ryokan via [Booking](https://www.booking.com/) \\- I think they\u2019ve recently added a ton more traditional ryokan, I found some real gems on there. Plus their app made it easy to have Japanese info on all lodgings, communicate directly with the property about my kaiseki meals, phone numbers to hand to cab drivers, and so on.\n\nLodgings cost about 80-120 EUR/night - and I had two big splurges you can see in my recap highlights at the end. (You can also stay at budget hostels in pretty much all of these places, but I was all about ryokan.) Feel free to ask about which were the best ones!\n\n**TRAVEL ITINERARY**\n\n[HERE is the FULL Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSZ7EmoPSetvjncSLUQESXqfmfjWv9vm8aA7gf9sOZM/edit?usp=sharing) with all of the schedules for trains, buses, ferries, etc. I did a *lot* of research - with a few optional timings - so this is still pretty accurate for whenever other people might go. It also has all my maps.\n\nIf you make your own travel schedule, use [Hyperdia](http://www.hyperdia.com/) for longer journeys - not Google Maps. The latter is not optimised for easy travel in Japan, it will give you stupid routes that take 3x the time. I know the Hyperdia page/app does not look pretty, but trust me - it could mean the difference between a 2-hour train ride and a 9-hour one.\n\nI almost never spent more than 1,5-2,5 hrs/day on transport. And traveling by Shinkansen and cute local trains is just so pleasant anyway, 99% of the time I wished I could stay on each train longer!\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIf you want to take it easy and stay longer in a few places, these are my personal top 5 onsen villages/cities from the whole tour (ranked in the order you\u2019d do them in - Kurokawa is probably #1 overall):\n\n1. KUSATSU\n2. ARIMA\n3. KINOSAKI\n4. KUROKAWA\n5. BEPPU\n\nFinally, I made videos where I ranked each bathhouse from 1-10 while travelling, which are all gathered on my Instagram story highlights. (*EDIT: Removed due to self-promotion rule.*)\n\nI could write a novel about all I experienced on this trip, but the IG stories and this post sorta say it all. It was the adventure of a lifetime and the best trip I\u2019ve ever taken.\n\nThank you so much, r/JapanTravel.\n\n**PS!** I know it sounds like this was planned to the millisecond, but the most important thing I did was TALK to people in each village. My Japanese sucks, but people were always SO willing to share bathing and city tips, hand-draw paths to secret onsen, share meals, etc. I have a physical black dossier full of maps, memories, and notes from local villagers. So even though I've shared a lot of tips here, that book is the most precious guide of them all. :)",

            "comment": "Awesome post ! I am in planning mode now for my dream month in Japan this April and my number one goal is to visit a bunch of Onsen. My first solo backpack trip at age 55 was through Europe, including Amsterdam, but hit up a bunch of hot springs in Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic\u2026 It was amazing! Figured I would follow suit with this trip but I will not be bouncing around so much. I\u2019m meeting my digital nomad son who is pretty set on staying a minimum one week in each place. (Although I did convince him to do a few days in shibu onsen.). I really want to go to kusatsu and wondering if you could tell me whether it is worth the very long  (5 1/2 hour?) train ride each way I will have to do from my base in Osaka. My week in Tokyo is already pretty much accounted for and I will be hitting up many Onsen from there. From Osaka as well, I have many day trips planned. If you can recommend any\u2026 And be so kind as to share some of those secret rotenburo in a DM, and your Instagram I would appreciate it so much! I am so excited! This is a dream trip for me too and I want to do it right. I have been studying Japanese for a while now and hopefully will be able to have real conversations with locals there!  I hear they really appreciate the effort and are super patient LOL. Thanks again for sharing your trip!  Any tips for a Japan first timer (unless I can count my one day layover last year) most appreciated !",

Incredible read.\n\nJapanese Inns &amp; Hot Springs - the prose is a little bland, but you can\u2019t fault the guy\u2019s choices. Some great ryokan in here!\n\nJapan: a View From The Bath - anthropological study on the culture surrounding bathing, crucial context! Sounds dry but the dude is super funny.\n\nLafcadio Hearn Ghost Stories - for classic creepy tales of yurei and yokai to keep you company in a creaky ryokan. Scared myself shitless many a night.\n\nPlus Lonely Planet guides and such, which should be pretty obvious.\n\n**WEBSITES**\n\n*Besides this subreddit, Booking, Skyscanner, Google et al mentioned in my post, these are the sites and channels that proved valuable in researching and getting inspired.*\n\n[Abroad in Japan YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHL9bfHTxCMi-7vfxQ-AYtg) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABroadInJapan/) \\- for inspo, laughs, and general not-too-stiff but still polite etiquette tips. (There are tons of other Japan YouTubers, but I find them too influencer-y and manic. Stresses me out!)\n\n[TabiEats YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Je3-ZV_x38NqQAxKiCCyQ) \\- for great local food tips in a lot of these specific villages.\n\n[KitsuneKun](https://www.instagram.com/kitsunekun/) \\- just for gorgeous visual onsen inspo, she usually keeps the actual locations hidden (and rightfully so).\n\n[Stephanie Crohin](https://www.instagram.com/_stephaniemelanie_/) \\- for sento tips (onsen with regular water, found in bigger cities like Tokyo). (She gets pretty French if you DM her though.)\n\n[The Yokai Encyclopedia](http://yokai.com/) \\- Matt is a great artist and a yokai scholar. This let me know about spoopy folktales from each region, if Hearn hadn\u2019t spooked me enough already.\n\n**Avoid** TripAdvisor &amp; Yelp. It doesn\u2019t get more gaijin-friendly than what they rate highly there, with some really rude, low-scored reviews on beautiful traditional spots.\n\nFinally, almost every village has a tourism site you should go to beforehand. Not gonna link them all, but [Arima\u2019s for example](https://visit.arima-onsen.com/) is really beautifully designed. A visit to each of these villages' sites is crucial!",

(I was tipped-off about one that's an 11-hour hike - didn't do that one this time around.)\n\nOr in Shibu Village, there are nine hidden, locked onsen that are only unlockable with a master key you get from staying at a handful of select ryokan in town.\n\nIt goes on.

I guess I'm just really sensitive to hot water, but some of these onsens are literally scolding hot and even pouring small amounts on my arms/legs results in bright red scorched skin for me. So I was wondering--did any of the onsen you visited feel not so boiling? Which ones do you remember being the coolest or least boiling? I will take any absolutely any suggestions or recommendations!

A few years ago I visited the kumano kodo pilgrimage trail and stayed in Shirahama at the Seamore Hotel.

Nearby was Saki-no-Yu, supposedly Japan\u2019s oldest onsen dating back to 1300 years ago and also outdoors facing the ocean. It looks like the Seamore hotel was recently renovated, so I don\u2019t know if they still have the pickle barrels...",

    "postText": "A few tips I would have liked to have known before going to Japan and then some\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS \n\n1.Masks are used everywhere in Japan - both indoors and outdoors (not limited to the subway/Shinkanzen) even if not mandatory\n\n2. Tickets for the Shinkanzen/museums are generally bought the day of. It is fairly common in NA to buy tickets in advance/online. Here - except for restaurants - it isn't something necessarily common. Most people buy their tickets at the entrance\n* this is not the case for Shibuya Sky, Universal Studios, Disney, Contemporary/new attractions\n\n3. Cash is king. Some places allow you to pay with credit card/IC card, particularly in big cities, but it has happened more often than not that it was cash only (even in some buses). At some point, I was stuck for almost an hour at an onsen waiting for a taxi that had a credit card machine  \n\n4. Weekends are really overcrowded. Be prepared\n\n5. Carrying your passport at all times will allow you to buy tax-free goods without issues\n\nLANGUAGE\n6.Some people have mentioned this in this sub, however, I do feel more emphasis should be made on this particular point: do not expect people to speak or understand English. \n*Although some Japanese may know a few words in English, it is extremely rare to find people able to speak conversational English, even in customer service. Surprisingly so. It is, however, expected, inasmuch as this is Japan, and the only language spoken is Japanese\n**Google Translate helped me in most cases\n*** people really do appreciate you trying a bit in Japanese before switching to English \n\nTRANSPORTATION\n7. It can be confusing and time-consuming to find stations, stores or restaurants, in particular while in Tokyo or Osaka (even with google maps). A good approach is to always give yourself some additional time to find them \n* Transportation fees are paid at the end of the trip when using an IC card, similar to other cities (e.g. London). Although you need your ticket/IC card to access means of transportation, it's at the end of your trip, while exiting, that you will see how much it costs. So you'll have to pull out your card/ticket back while exiting \n**Google maps is a must in most place you go, particularly to plan your rides. However, not everywhere. In Kyoto, it has hapenned a few times that the information wasn't accurate or translated, in particular for the buses. Hiroshima, was similar, in that aspect. \n*** Some stations, like Shinjuku Station, are very huge, to the extent that you might get lost, even with Google. The signs are fortunately in both Japanese and English, so you can find your way around \n**** Check if you can have your IC Card on your phone - honestly it really makes it easier\n***** This should be a given, but just in case: be sure to buy the JR Pass before going to Japan\n\nRESTAURANTS\n8. Many sitting down restaurants with menu work with a reservation-first policy - meaning that they can be fully booked for the day, even before opening.This is particulalry true in Kyoto, and Tokyo (depending where). Be prepared to reserve well in advance (Attention: in most restaurants, you can only reserve in Japanese)\n* People eat dinner fairly early in Japan (restaurants begin openning/re-openning around 5:30 pm). Should you have no reservation, one way around is to wait at the restaurant before opening, so as to ensure a place \n** For solo travellers, it has hapenned to me more often than not, even without reservation, that I managed to get in simply cause I was alone (one seat)\n*** Kyoto without restaurant reservation is a sh*show. Be prepared to eat early \n**** Restaurant hours on Google are sometimes more of an indication. Some restaurants will close after a certain point if they have no clientele - even if it's two hours before their internet closing time.\n\nSIGHTSEEING\n9. There are many tourists in Japan, even during the off-season. This is particularly true in Kyoto, that I found very much flooded with tourists. Waking up early is a good way to ensure some privacy and, in my experience, the best for sightseeing. \n\nONSEN ETIQUETTE\n10. Be sure to know which places accept tattoos, and to understand well the etiquette that is involved. Onsen are not spas. \n* Not staying too long in the water is recommended. Actually, the best approach is to follow what the Japanese are doing. They take their time before going in, starting with their feet, then they stay for a couple minutes, then go in and out two or three times. My first time around, I almost fainted cause I was rushing out of the water after staying too long. It is not an enviable position. \n** I have a small tattoo on my arm and had no issues, even in onsen that did not accept tattoos\n\nTLDR: Some tips and things to expect for upcoming travellers. Not everything is relevant, tbf\n\nNote: The previous version mentioned \"all restaurants.\" It has been fairly pointed out, and I agree that it is not all restaurants, but rather sitting down restaurants with menu (that can be more expensive). I'm really sorry for the confusion. \n* Food Street/ fast food require no reservation\n** Some restaurants will simply work on first come first served policy",

I have literally no idea what you're talking about, I've never reserved a table ever and never had such issues. My guess is that you either went to fancy places only (while I generally don't go there at all) or there was a misunderstanding or the restaurants used this as an excuse not to accept foreign tourists",

Every single other restaurant I visited didn't have a reservation system in place. \n\nI understand that some places don't want to become touristy and want to \"protect\" their local regulars, or something along those lines. And then there's the ones who simply hate foreigners. But why not just outright ban foreigner and put a sign up front? It would save everyones time and energy.",

I doubt we got turned away for being foreign since my friend who went in to ask is Japanese (though born and raised in US).",

They didn't seem to be trying to get rid of us, first they asked for the reservation details. And we found one in Kyoto, but it seemed to be on the fancy side, that we tried to see if we could grab lunch there (Ayuchaya Hiranoya - it had amazing reviews and it smelled great from the outside), and they also said that they were booked full. But that was 2 times in 2 weeks, and both were nicer places. I most definitely would not say that you need a reservation all of the time, just to try and check if the restaurant takes reservations if it's a popular or exclusive spot.",

But you know, helps that the food was expensive so I think they were more willing to bend the rules.\n\nAlso this didn\u2019t apply to all restaurants; some refused to bend the rules even in an empty restaurant so it is what it is. I will give it to you again, some of it felt like it was just an overall ban on foreigners going to a local restaurant.",

Hakata ramen and mentaiko in Fukuoka, champon and Sasebo burger in Nagasaki (and I guess the latter also in Sasebo), basashi and Kumamoto ramen in Kumamoto, Miyazaki beef in Miyazaki, etc. Shouldn't be hard to find more specialties and specific restaurant recommendations online.

If you are going more than a Solo traveller, don't expect to get into restaurants if you have prebooked.\n\nYes, Cash is fairly prevalent, but the difference between 2019 and 2022 is drastic. I was able to use my card in almost every place we went even smaller shops. But I would have a few thousand yen on you as a back up just in case the place you are going doesn't take cards. But since COVID, most people (from our experience) have accepted CC. \n\nWe joked that we felt the entire country of Japan must have studied their English during COVID, because the amount of people that spoke to us in 2022 vs 2019, there was a drastic difference. However OP does have a point that if you at least try to speak what little you know (Excuse Me, Please, Thank you, etc). It goes A LONG WAY. I feel you get from the world the amount of effort you put into it. So be humble, kind, and I think you will receive that in return.",

Ready for downvotes, but it annoyed me that the only maskless people were foreigners - I get it, I don't wear a mask in the US outside anymore but IMO best to be respectful of local culture in other countries, especially in Japan where the society is extremely rule abiding. It will take a long time before they go maskless\n* I was really confused with cash vs credit card debate on this sub before returning. There are some very vocal posters here saying that Japan is some sort of credit card society now\n   * In my experience, you will never have a problem having cash. Just withdraw from Lawson ATM's as needed. Really not a big deal, and have a coin purse.\n   * More restaurants were taking card, but there were several that were still cash only. I suspect the people posting that cards are king now don't go to any small stores or food stalls. Many are still cash only, especially the food street in Kyoto\n   * So why not do both? Carry a credit card and Pasmo/suica card, but definitely have cash on you at all times. I would not advocate for credit card only.\n* Restaurants you don't need reservations unless you are eating at some Michelin place. Agreed lines can get long during peak hours, I just simply went to restaurants a little earlier/later to avoid crowds. For very popular places with tourists, go early before opening (Shin Udon, Toyko station ramen etc.)",

You can just as easily be pre-booking at a ticket machine or at the counter as otherwise.",

If you are fine sitting in the non-reserved train car you just show up with your JR Pass and get on the train. If there are no seats, you can stand there.\n\nReserved seats have their own train cars and to sit there you have to pay an extra fee but it's only a couple of bucks. With a JR pass, this extra fee is waived. All you need to do is go to a ticket window or a ticket machine and reserve your seat. However your reservations cannot overlap so if you miss a train you need to go to the ticket window and cancel your missed reservation and rebook the seat reservation. You can prebook as far ahead as your pass is valid.\n\nIn general I prefer booking reserved seats because the reserved seat trains are usually less busy.",

Not full conversational English but enough to fill in the gaps of what I can\u2019t say in Japanese. On top of a huge amount of restaurants having English menus and places like the pharmacy having sheets printed out in English to describe the process of buying medicine. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m in a different Japan. Although feel like a lot of this applies more to places outside of Tokyo specifically.",

That\u2019s still central Tokyo area for the most part. Expensive, easy commute. No one really gets out beyond the guide books. I\u2019ve lived in Tokyo for 16 years, tourists all flock to the same areas.\n\nShimokitazawa is kind of unfortunately. It's changed a lot after the station got renovated and not necessarily for the better, unless you live there or enjoy craft beer. \n\nYokohama is still part of the greater Tokyo metroplex, if outside Tokyo-to and central Tokyo. Nice area to walk/bike around when the weather is nice. \n\nNone of these are really getting off the beaten path. It's no wonder you see mostly places that have English menus and take credit cards. Get out to Tateishi for some great food, or Jujo for a bit more grimy but fun side. Go to Horikirishobuen for some great senberos, or Kameari. Bring cash. Lots of great Izakayas close by in Asakusabashi that are likely better then you are getting in the places you listed above. Even inside Tokyo, I rarely see people go to Arakicho except for maybe the bozu-bar. Otsuka probably sees some more tourists now, Sugamo, Tabata. This is just stuff nearby.",

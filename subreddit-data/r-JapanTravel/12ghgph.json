    "postText": "Hi everyone! Been a lurker on this sub for a while and love reading through all the advice shared about Japan :-) Am planning a mom-daughter trip in end May to Fukuoka! Have been to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hokkaido previously and thought we'd explore somewhere different this time. \n\nWe're all about getting a relaxing vacation (think spread out walking, stopping for coffee breaks frequently) so there's some space carved out deliberately in the itinerary.. that said, if there are amazing experiences I'm really missing out on I'd be so grateful if you could share! \n\nSome things we really want to explore - strawberry picking (I think it's at the end of the season so I'm not sure if this is doable), shopping in Fukuoka, visiting museums, watching a baseball game and trying out lots of good food! Also been looking at Takachiho Gorge which looks gorgeous - is that doable as a 1-day tour trip sort of thing based on the itinerary? \n\nDay 1 - 23 May (Stay in Fukuoka): Arrive in Fukuoka at 9am; visit Ohori Park; lunch at \u3046\u306a\u304e\u51e6\u5c71\u9053; visit Fukuoka Asian Art Museum\n\nDay 2 - 24 May (Stay in Nagasaki): Take the train down to Nagasaki; visit Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum / Peace Park; visit Mount Inasa\n\nDay 3 - 25 May: Take the train to Kagoshima; Visit Yoshino Kumano National Park; Visit Shiroyama Park\n\nDay 4 - 26 May: Visit Kagoshima City Museum of Meiji Restoration \\[Note: Day is quite empty, not sure what else to do here\\]\n\nDay 5 - 27 May: Take the train to Strawberry Picking Chikushino Farm; Take the train to Fukuoka; Shop at Canal City\n\nDay 6 - 28 May: Visit Fukuoka City Museum; Watch Softbank Hawks game\n\nDay 7 - 29 May: Cycle at Uminonakamichi Seaside Park\n\nDay 8 - 30 May: Depart from Fukuoka in the morning",

                            "comment": "Just my personal opinion: Visiting Dazaifu only for temples in your case: maybe not. But as you mentioned you are interested in museums you should decide whether the Kyushu National Museum is of interest for you. Besides that strolling Tenjinsama-dori Street, Dazaifu's main street, is nice. Have a look at this trip report: [https://www.thetravelmentor.com/2019/04/taking-a-day-trip-to-dazaifu-from-fukuoka-hakata-japan/](https://www.thetravelmentor.com/2019/04/taking-a-day-trip-to-dazaifu-from-fukuoka-hakata-japan/)",

Also Sengan-en gardens and the Kagoshima Aquarium. There\u2019s also the nice tourist trains that go to Ibusuki that\u2019s on the tip of Kyushu. As for Nagasaki there\u2019s a tourist train that runs from Takeo Onsen to an Nagasaki that\u2019s very popular and serve local treats and drinks onboard. Don\u2019t forget there\u2019s also Yufuin/Beppu/Kurokawa for the onsens and outdoor hot springs. Kumamoto for its beautiful Black Castle.",

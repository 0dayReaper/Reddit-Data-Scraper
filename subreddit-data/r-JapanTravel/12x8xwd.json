    "postText": "Paying it forward, this subreddit is extremely helpful - so hopefully this helps someone planning their trip (2 travelers from the US -  M&amp;F)\n\n**TIPS &amp; TRICKS**\n\n1. Very good to use:  e-sim UBIGI or Mobal data sim. We each used a service, and both were reliable.\n2. Very good to use for apple phones:  PASMO/Suica on apple wallet and designate PASMO/Suica to shinkansen tickets bought on SMARTEX. Get your full PASMO or SUICA card number by downloading the corresponding app. We did not buy any tickets at the station. Everything we did was on our cell phone. We did not buy the JR pass - not worth it for our trip.\n3. Bring an extra power battery bank for your phone if you have one, else you can [rent them](https://www.howto-osaka.com/en/battery/) if your cell phone battery dies. We had to do this in Osaka.\n4. Book Shibuya Sky tickets in advance if you go at a popular time - sunset. We noticed the tickets were sold out by 4:30pm the day we went.\n5. Book dining reservations in advance if able to, especially if you go to a popular place, ie Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo, any Michelin star establishment, or any popular spot mentioned by a vlogger. I was only able to use google or tablecheck. Tablelog was a little to difficult for me to navigate. We were turned away at a number of places since they were fully booked.\n6. Bring a travel towel for daily use to dry hands in bathroom \u2013 or buy one for a souvenir\n7. Bring a coin pouch \u2013 or buy one for a souvenir; Extra ziplock bags - handy for trash and unfinished food.\n8. Laundry is easy to do in Japan \u2013 don\u2019t be scared to pack light and the detergent is included when washing so no need to bring laundry detergent or pods. 24 minutes in the dryer in Japan was definitely dry enough.\n9. Tax refund should be done the day you are shopping \u2013 either at the store or at a tax refund counter in the shopping mall; you should always have your passport on you as a visitor, but make sure you do when you shop at a tax refund store. 5000 jpy is the usual limit to earn a tax refund. There is no tax refund counter at the Haneda airport\n10. Unless you walk 10 miles a day on a usual basis, your feet will get sore amongst other joints. Try these [patches](https://www.reddit.com/user/fabulousdrink/comments/12x6kja/japan_tips/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\u2026.I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in them, but I wished I bought them sooner. Used them on the last 3 nights to help with recovery. I also brought Advil with me but ran out of them by day 5. If you have allergies, be sure to check the ingredients.\n11. Our daily steps total ranged from 20,000 to a high of 36,000 steps a day. Wear your absolute most comfortable walking shoes and socks. Asics Gel-Kayano's for me and yes, my feet were very sore.\n12. As for credit card as a US visitor, mostly used Visa, sometimes American Express and only one time needed the Mastercard for a PASMO apple wallet transaction when the amex card failed.\n13. We don\u2019t know any Japanese. I think at the very minimum, at least learn to say thank you. \u201carigato gozaimasu\u201d and please \u201conegaishimasu\u201d. Most people we encountered knew English and you definitely could get by with hand gestures and pointing at the item on the menu.\n14. Stand on the left side of the escalator. As for walking, it seemed to vary.\n15. Carry your backpack in the front, while on the train\n16. I used the majority of my cash in Osaka and Kyoto, versus Tokyo used mostly credit card.\n17. Used the free version of Wanderlog and apple notes for planning\n18. Took one hour to go through customs and immigration in KIX after deplaning at 7pm \u2013 no checked in luggage and we did have the screenshots of our QR code with the colored bars. Bought the discounted rapi:t Nankai ticket online (KIX&gt;Namba) beforehand and booked the tickets/seats after going through customs and immigration. Caught the 8:36 PM rapi:t train.\n19. 7-bank ATM at KIX charged a 220jpy fee on top of my Chase bank fee 3% and $5 USD to withdrawal JPY.\n20. Keep your itinerary relatively flexible so you can adjust it for any rainy days. We did bring rain jackets and umbrellas - used both.\n21. Avoid rush hour train times.\n22. On the Shinkansen train from Kyoto to Tokyo, sit on the left hand side for views of Mt. Fuji\n\n**TRIP ITINERARY** (apologies in advance for any misspellings)\n\nDay 1 - arrive in Osaka.

            "comment": "Thanks for these! I\u2019ll add some additional comments/differing perspectives:\n\n1. We have done both esim and pocket wifi; pocket wifi is cheaper and more data and can feed multiple devices, but is one more thing to carry (three if you consider the extra power bank and charging cord to make it last a long day out). \n\n3. Power banks are very cheap and small/easy to carry nowadays, so I would recommend buying vs renting!\n\n4. My personal recommendation is Mori Building\u2019s Tokyo Sky View over Shibuya Sky ;)\n\n5. As far as I know, Kengo Kuma\u2019s Starbuck Roastery does not take pre-reservations. You must show up early day of and take a number for virtual queuing by scanning a QR code at the visitor centre beside the cafe. Some Michelin star establishments also do not take pre-reservations, for example Chukasoba Hachigou in Ginza is a same-day physical queue only. Basically - rules vary, do your research specifically!\n\n6. Yes, personal hand towel is necessary as most hand dryers are still out of service due to covid precautions. There are so many cute quality towels; the one I bought was this [dogs at onsen](https://sugoimart.com/products/onsen-face-towel-dogs?variant=39645551788131&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=18120963333&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=18120963333&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;gadid=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0ZiiBhBKEiwA4PT9zxqfsxBFwMcISS8LwGFhRkVrLVodfD5UrZX_hNrAuSMsH0pTUNyJQxoCaZwQAvD_BwE) one. \n\n7. Similar to towel, coin purse/\u201ctrash\u201d bag is another good souvenir opportunity! I bought an adorable coin purse that has beautiful fabric print and a puzzle clasp mechanism with a frog charm. My friend bough a locally crafted phone/coin purse that had the design of a local lemon sour on it. And we bought a beautiful cottagecore floral mesh bag that we used for our hanami picnic, it matched perfectly with our kimonos and we used it daily as our snack-to-garbage bag throughout the trip. \n\n8. We had a different experience - some hostels do not provide any detergents, so we just washed with plain water cycle. And keep in mind dryers are very small compared to standard dryers that we have in modern homes in Canada, so my small load of travel clothing (think 2 tees 1 pant 1 light jacket and some socks) took about 4 cycles (2 hrs) to fully dry. But yes coin laundry is very easy to use. \n\n11. Indeed lots of walking, especially in bigger cities! We always book hostels/ryokans that have onsens or at least ofuros to soak the soreness away at night. \n\n19. I\u2019m curious what your final effective conversion rate was for using the ATM? Seems like a whole lot of fees. We did our cash conversion at home and brought cards for emergencies, but did not end up using ATMs while in Japan. \n\n22. On a clear day you will see Mt. Fuji on the Shinkansen for about 3-5 min, and then it disappears behind some other mountains in the foreground. Don\u2019t put your camera away just yet; it will come back in view for a little longer shortly ;)",

At these cashiers, you show them your passport, and they will do the rest. The transaction is rung up tax free and your receipt should show 0 for tax and they usually bag and seal all your purchased goods, which should not be opened until you depart Japan. Be forewarned, I made a purchase at Itoya in Ginza and they had a fee for the tax free  - so the receipt did look different.\n\nThird, if your are at a mall like GINZA SIX and make a purchase in their store - you should still see the sign \"Japan tax free shop\", you still show them your passport, but this time they give you the receipt and it's usually. attached to a pamphlet that tells you tax free guide. The guide will tell you where the tax refund counter is in the shopping complex. You must go that day to receive your refund. The particular tax refund counter I went to, had a tablet that you choose your language, then you get a ticket number. They will call your number when it's your turn at the counter. At the counter you show them your receipt and your purchased items. They will bag it and seal it for you, and the refund will be given to you. Mine was given to me in cash.\n\nThe total amount of your goods/consumables must be over 5000 jpy (before tax) to earn a tax refund. This is why I saved my beauty shopping haul for my last days on my trip - to consolidate everything together to reach the 5000 jpy limit and to not have to carry everything with me.\n\nI hope that helps.",

Because of this, I didn't bother purchasing the JR pass and it was more cost effective to buy a single pass shinkansen ticket. However, I do want to note I got really lucky/kept a close eye on prices with my flight tickets, as multi-city flights are typically much more expensive than round trip. Gl!",

Risky business these days.\n\nAs \\\\TeamSmitten mentioned it cost more to fly multi-city vs. RT.\n\nI blew the travel budget on the plane tickets. On reflection it probably wasn't necessary, but I really did enjoy the convenience of flying directly into Osaka. Also, Osaka was our favorite city between Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo. \n\nIt was nice not to have to bother with a JR Pass and only have our IC card on our cell phone to think about. I think if we flew RT to Tokyo, the JR Pass might be worth the value for us. \n\nI would only fly multi-city if the budget allows it. Else I would fly RT and save the money. The public transportation in Japan is amazing and honestly the first day was still lost to a travel day anyways.",

I had just eaten at Bricolage cafe so I wasn't that hungry but oh, how I wish I was. I wanted more sashimi! I ordered the seasonal delicacies set which came with a sashimi bowl. There were items in the seasonal delicacies set that I normally do not like, ie bamboo, tofu. But how they prepared the items in this set was exceptional. The tofu was made with milk and tasted like a cream dessert. The bamboo didn't have that funky flavor. Everything was delicious. I truly wish I had time to come back and eat the nigiri set. The lunch value is insane. Check out the google reviews - people have more food posted as well.",

    "postText": "A fire broke out overnight at Shuri Castle in Okinawa, a World Heritage Site. Unfortunately the reports on Japanese media this morning are saying that the castle is completely gone. No reports on the fire source so far.\n\nObviously this is a big hit to the area and the nation as a whole. I'm sure they will look to rebuild at some point in the future (they did after World War 2) but it will take some time for everyone to process.\n\n [https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/30/asia/shuri-castle-fire-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/30/asia/shuri-castle-fire-intl/index.html)",

Hopefully the relief fund gets at least a moderate amount of international attention",

Certainly the Japanese have familiarity with rebuilding temples and castles after fires, and Shurijo has significance to Ryukyu culture for Okinawans. I don't think they'll decide not to bother just because it's not as internationally famous. But who knows!",

I was practicing my Japanese by asking directions and not always doing a great job understanding what I was told. At one point we walked into a Buddhist temple, thinking that it was perhaps the entrance to the castle (or perhaps I was just having a senior moment). The kind people there directed me further down the street. The correct location quickly became obvious from the giant stone foundations. It was a very beautiful, impressive place. I wanted to post some photos from my experience, but I find that I was (am) such a poor photographer that I never managed to get any pictures that did it justice.",

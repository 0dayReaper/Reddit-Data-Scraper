If you or your group personally like to window shopping, that's fine, but if not that much, I would suggest you doing something different. Imperial Palace, Tokyo Tower, Meiji Shrine, Nakano Broadway, etc. are some options.",

Even after all that, baggage still hadn\u2019t arrived. THEN was the customs checkpoint. There was a few flights arriving at once but it was 2 hours from landing to getting out of the airport.\n\nAlso, at Haneda, the SIM cards are in a vending machine that was sold out for the ones I wanted and only took certain notes. I landed at night and everything else was shut. Hopefully Narita and timing is different, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll clear all that and then get across the city from Narita to Shinjuku in 2 hours.\n\nAlso, Suica on your phone is way better. No mucking about at stations to top it up when it\u2019s low, and the queues are long at the airport station.",

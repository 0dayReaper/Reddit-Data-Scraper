Definitely trying out 7-11.\n* Lunch &amp; Dinner are based on when and where the areas we are currently exploring in.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "You have grouped things together which is the right idea. It's hard to say if it's too busy or light as it's hard to predict how long you will spend at each place. For example, Ginza for some could be a full shopping day, but for people who aren't looking to shop then there is not much there for them. \n\nTokyo is dense so there is a lot around so you can easily get distracted and end up doing things you don't plan, so it's always better to not put too much on each day and allow yourself to wander.",

And a good way to wind down.\n\nWhat do you think of these time allocations? (For the time being)\n\n1. Shrines \u2192 30-45 mins\n2. Temples \u2192 1 hr - 1 hr 30 mins\n3. Modern Buildings (Tokyo Metro Gov / Yebisu Garden Place Tower) \u2192 1 hr - 1 hr 30 mins\n4. Wandering along streets \u2192 1 hr *(Should I add more in case of distractions?)*\n5. Meal Times (inc. selecting place, waiting time, actual dining)\n\n* Breakfast \u2192 30 mins (quick breakfast - 7/11?)\n* Lunch \u2192 1 hr\n* Dinner \u2192 1 hr\n* Are these times to unrealistic, due to possible business?",

I would say shrines and temples should have the same allocation of 1 to 1.5 hrs.\n\nFor meals, it's not uncommon for popular places to have queues so factor that in if you are going to a popular place.",

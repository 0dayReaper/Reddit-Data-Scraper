    "postText": "I saw this on another Japan subreddit however this sub wouldn't let me crosspost it here so I'll link it instead. The first forecasts for the 2019 cherry blossom season have been [posted](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/01/15/national/cherry-blossoms-across-japan-forecast-arrive-earlier-usual-2019/#.XD4PlFxKiUk).\n\nFrom the article: \n\n&gt;In this year\u2019s forecast, released Thursday, Japan Meteorological Corp. announced the blossoming in Kochi is likely to be followed by early flowering in Fukuoka, where blossoms are due to emerge on March 20.\n&gt;\n&gt;Soon after that, sakura flowers will begin to bloom in the cities of Tokyo and Nagoya on March 22, in Kyoto on March 25 and Osaka on March 27.\n&gt;\n&gt;According to the forecast, cherry trees will be in full bloom in Kochi on March 25, and in Tokyo and Fukuoka on March 29.\n&gt;The firm has also said the last weekend of March will offer the most enjoyable cherry blossom viewing in Tokyo, Kyushu and the Tokai region, and that the first weekend of April will be the best time for picnics under sakura trees in the Kinki region and other parts of Shikoku, as well as other places in the Kanto region.\n\nMy own trip dates are March 19 to April 14 so I'm excited!\n\n**edit**: Hey guys, bear in mind these are only early predictions and not set in stone, blossoms are very finicky and weather-dependent! This is only a forecast and not a guaranteed schedule.",

Sendai is further north than Seoul, yet averages almost four degrees higher during the day because Seoul is more exposed to Siberian troughs.",

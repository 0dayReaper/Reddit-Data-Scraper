    "postText": "Hello! My husband and I (both early 30s) are currently planning our first trip to Japan. We regularly work with a travel agency to help us plan our itineraries when we travel. I have gone back and forth with the agent on our Japan itinerary several times. Nothing on the below itinerary has been booked and we don't yet have hotels. The agent is supposed to provide hotel selections after we finalize the day-to-day itinerary. \n\nMy impression is that this is a slow pace and we will spend a lot of time in transit.  I would love this forum's advice on days that we can consolidate and be more efficient with our time. For example, will we really need a full day in Odaiba? Can we reasonably combine Ueno and Akihabara/Shinjuku? Can we reasonably combine trips to Arashiyama and Nara? Or, does this pace look like it's on target? \n\nFWIW, We enjoy a moderate pace when we travel (generally, sleep in until 8:30/9, leave hotel by 10:30, explore all day, return to hotel to freshen up before dinner/drinks, usually back at hotel by 11pm/midnight). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1: Arrival to Haneda at 3pm; private transfer from airport to hotel. Regroup, get something quick nearby for dinner. \n\nDay 2: Explore Odaiba (Fuji TV building, Diver City, Miraikan); Cooking class in the neighborhood at lunchtime. \n\nDay 3: Explore Ueno (Ueno Park, Nezu Shrine, shopping)\n\nDay 4: Explore Akihabara and Shinjuku (maybe take an anime/manga tour on this day)\n\nDay 5: Visit Ghibli Museum in the morning, explore Asakusa after (Senso-ji, shopping, etc)\n\nDay 6: Tokyo -&gt; Mt Fuji via train: settle into hotel upon arrival, explore\n\nDay 7: Tour of Highlights of Kawaguchiko (which includes Chureito Pagoda, Oshino Hakkai Village, Kubota Itchiku Art Museum, The Mount Fuji Panoramic Ropeway)\n\nDay 8: Fuji -&gt; Kyoto: settle into hotel, then go to traditional tea ceremony\n\nDay 9: Day trip to Arashiyama (bamboo forest, monkey park); on return, visit Kinkakuji.\n\nDay 10: Day trip to Nara (Todaiji Temple, deer park)\n\nDay 11: Explore other districts of Kyoto\n\nDay 12: Kyoto -&gt; Osaka: Osaka Castle, Dotombori District\n\nDay 13: Osaka -&gt; Tokyo: Explore Osaka as needed in the morning; catch the train to Tokyo; visit Tokyo Skytree.\n\nDay 14: Group tour of Tsukiji Fish Market, then visit Shibuya &amp; Harajuku\n\nDay 15: Last day! We will have time to visit one neighborhood in the morning before our departure at 5pm.",

There's plenty of shopping and sightseeing (esp along the waterfront), plus some very cool museums (my partner and I visited TeamLAB Planets and Small Worlds and loved them both). It made for a fairly relaxed first day in Japan, since it's fairly quiet and open. \n\nIf you're big into anime and pop culture, Akihabara could also take up an entire day. There are so many stores!\n\nI wouldn't recommend trying to do both Arashiyama and Nara. For one, they're in completely opposite directions. For another, both have enough to do to keep you busy all day. Nara has a huge park with a bunch of temples - Todai-ji was a highlight with its views over the city - and of course the deer, plus shopping and eating closer to Nara Station. In Arashiyama I recommend bike rental and cycling the streets, the Monkey Park, and the temples closer to the mountains, which are fairly small compared to others in Kyoto but no less beautiful. \n\nI hope this helps a little :)",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m planning to visit Japan with my wife from June 22 to July 2, both inclusive. Planned the whole trip alone and needed a second pair of eyes to help me with some questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole trip plan is Tokyo \u2192 Kawaguchiko \u2192 Kyoto \u2192 Nara \u2192 Osaka \u2192 Tokyo, which takes 11 days (10 nights), includes 5 different hotels and 2 Shinkansen rides to and from Tokyo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1: June 22 (Arrival to Tokyo, Check-in, Shinjuku):**\n\n\\- Arrive at Narita Airport at 18:30 in the evening\n\n\\- Train to the hotel in Shinjuku and check-in\n\n\\- Explore Shinjuku district (Kabukicho area and Golden Gai St.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2: June 23 (Shinjuku district):**\n\n\\- Tokyo Metropolitan Building\n\n\\- Shinjuku Gyoen Park\n\n\\- Omoide Yokocho\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3: June 24 (Shibuya district):**\n\n\\- Shibuya Crossing and Mag\u2019s Park\n\n\\- Shibuya Scramble Square  &amp; Shibuya Sky\n\n\\- Shibuya Hikarie Building- Shibuya Center St.\n\n\\- Niku Yokocho\n\n\\- Yoyogi Park\n\n\\- Meiji Shrine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4: June 25 (No plan, just have fun):**\n\n\\- Tsukiji market\n\n\\- Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo\n\n\\- Just walk around\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5: June 26 (Kawaguchiko day trip):**\n\n\\- Check-out early morning (\\~06:00)\n\n\\- Bus to Kawaguchiko station and check-in\n\n\\- Arakurayama Sengen Shrine\n\n\\- Chureito Pagoda\n\n\\- Kachi Kachi Ropeway\n\n\\- Rent a bike\n\n\\- Oishi Park\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6: June 27 (Kyoto):**\n\n\\- Check-out early morning (\\~06:00)\n\n\\- Shinkansen to Kyoto  and check-in\n\n\\- Ninenzaka Street\n\n\\- Starbucks Ninenzaka\n\n\\- Kiyomizu-dera Buddhist Temple\n\n\\- Samurai &amp; Ninja Museum\n\n\\- Nishiki Market\n\n\\- Mameshiba Cafe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 7: June 28 (Kyoto):**\n\n\\- Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\n\n\\- Togetsukyo Bridge\n\n\\- Iwatayama Peak\n\n\\- Kyoto Gyoen National Garden\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 8: June 29 (Nara &amp; Osaka):**\n\n\\- Check-out early morning\n\n\\- Train to Nara\n\n\\- Nara Park &amp; Todai-ji Temple until after lunch\n\n\\- Train to Osaka and check-in at the hotel in the evening\n\n\\- Dotonbori Street &amp; Market\n\n\\- Kurobon Ichiba Market\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9: June 30 (Osaka &amp; back to Tokyo):**\n\n\\- Check-out from the hotel in the morning\n\n\\- Explore Osaka for the rest of the day\n\n\\- Umeda Sky Building\n\n\\- Osaka Castle\n\n\\- Shinsekai District\n\n\\- Shinkansen to Tokyo in the early evening\n\n\\- Check-in to hotel in Ginza\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 10: July 1 (Tokyo):**\n\n\\- Godzilla statue\n\n\\- Tokyo Tower\n\n\\- Senso-Ji Temple\n\n\\- Tokyo Skytree\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 11: July 2 (Departure):**\n\n\\- Check-out from the hotel early morning\n\n\\- Have fun in the Ginza area until lunchtime\n\n\\- Train to Narita Airport at 13:00\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see that a couple of days are not filled as the rest of them, and are just being used for having fun without a strict plan, as I could not come up with anything for those days on my own. My wife and I are not interested to visit popular stuff like USJ or Ghibli Park, or shopping, so it\u2019s only exploring the cities and their attractions. We travel with two carry-on suitcases and on some days will be bringing them with us for the walks around a city (not a good idea?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only things booked for now are the hotels. I am not sure if I need to book Shinkansen and bus rides right now already, or if I should wait to get to Japan first. Also, I think we will not need JR Pass as we only travel on Shinkansen two times (to and from Tokyo), and the cost of those tickets will be cheaper than buying JR pass. I am not sure about route Kyoto \u2192 Nara \u2192 Osaka (does it benefit from JR pass?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, what is the best way to get from Kawaguchiko to Kyoto in the early morning? Going down to Mishima and taking the train, or going back to Tokyo by bus and taking the train from there (which is faster according to google maps)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? Please feel free to give any advice or recommendation on places and transportation. I am open to anything.",

Depending on the day of the week there can even be street preformers.\n\nOsaka\n\nI'm not saying don't go to the castle because it is fun but it's totally modern inside. Some really awesome displays but not historic like some of the other castles in other parts of the country.\n\nIf you have time go to the aquarium! This was the coolest aquarium ever! It's 5 stories tall and has a central tank that has whale sharks.\n\nKyoto\n\nNot really much to say because any of the shrines /temples are worth going to. The palace is amazing and I love the nightingale floors.\n\nHave fun!",

            "comment": "About the suitcases you can always leave them in a coin locker, you can usually found them in train station. Just note that the further you go from the main entrance, the cheaper it can be.\n\nAbout day 8, seems like you want to do Nara and Osaka main attractions in one day. Many shops in Kuromon Market close early (17h-18h) so you may miss them. \n\nIf you're late for Kuromon Market, how about the TeamLab exposition at Osaka Botanical Garden- which open when the sun set? It's not that expensive and it's a lovely experience (imo). \n\nFor Tokyo, during free time I would recommend the Ueno area with Omoide Yokoch\u014d street. And even the Yanesen area (old Tokyo town) west of Ueno Park to get a nice break from the modern side of Tokyo. It's like one station away from Asakusa and the Senso-ji.",

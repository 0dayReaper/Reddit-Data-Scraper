    "postText": "My wife and I had a great experience with one of the locals in Osaka and just wanted to share it here. We had landed at the airport around 10pm and followed the hotel instructions to use the local subway. There was a connection between two lines to get to our hotel and in the middle we had discovered that the subway closed by the time we reached Tengachaya station. We had no access to internet since the sim stores at the airport were closed by the time we landed. Tried to take a taxi but the language barrier was too much. Taxi driver ended up giving up since we only had the hotel name and the address we had was in English. Underandably, we had to pay the starting fee and get out of the taxi. At this point we were panicking and I wanted us to just walk the 1.5 hours relying hopefully on free WiFi along the way. \n\nThere was a young man at the station waiting for his friends so we decided to ask him for help. He spoke very little English except a few words and I spoke zero Japanese. He was so patient with us all the way through. Ended up asking for the phone number to the hotel so he could google where it was. Got us a taxi and explained to the driver how to get there. He was just such an awesome human being. It was not easy at all trying to figure out how to help us and he could have easily just walked away. Definitely saved two dumb tourists that day.\n\nThanks you saint of a man! We're really enjoying your city right now and you're really representing it very well.",

            "comment": "FYI.. that first taxi driver probably could have gotten you to the hotel with just the phone number.  All Japanese Navigation systems can find locations by phone number.  And you got screwed on the first taxi fee.. they usually don't start the meter until they know where they're going, bad luck on that one.",

We arrived Haneda airport late in the evening and had only 30 minutes to go to Times Car rental shop in Otorii before they close to pick up our car.  The Taxi driver instead drove us to a Times Car parking lot in a residential area.  Luckily, we had just picked up a pocket wifi so we used goggle to communicate to confirm the exact address of the shop and arrived just before they close.  And we arrived in Hakone around midnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the driver's interactions and expressions though, we felt pretty sure he knew we needed to go to the shop and not the parking lot.

We ran so far away (sorry, couldn't help my self - YOU know the joke, right?) and caught up with our bus just as it was pulling away.\n\nIt continued to pull away. Without is. We stood there feeling sorry for ourselves and wondering what to do next, when a woman approached us told us the story (unimportant to this story, so explained below, to improve story telling flow).*\n\nSo we walk back, and on the way, no less than THREE other sets of folks  (not knowing that we'd already been told the news) ALSO informed us of what what was what. We felt a little silly, but overflowing with gratitude that people would take the time.\n\nWe got on our proper bus a few moments later, no problem.\n\nWant to guess what city? Not in Japan, but HONG KONG.\n\nAll of this to say that the kindness of strangers comes in all forms from many different nationalities. So does shitty behaviour that does NOT represent a country.\n\nJust keep this in mind when you experience either. And pass it along in your home country. Think about it... you're going about your day and you see someone, obviously a visitor, obviously confused about something, or worse, in distress. It's no skin off your back to take a moment to help out. And it leves a great feeling behind.\n\nPay it forward folks. And you your due diligence before entering a new country. ;)\n\n* It *was* our bus, but it was out of service as of the stop we were waiting.

We had a phone number, but no connectivity, and had to rely on the help of a passerby who phoned their friend who spoke English, who then called the AirBnB\nhost, who then arrived. Coulda a been hairy, but it was solved due to the kindness of strangers.\n\nHowever...\n\nIt really goes to show you that you have to do your homework before entering and travelling in a new country. Bus instructions written down, saved map routes, downloaded offline maps in both Maps.me AND Google... knowing that Google maps doesn't do offline in Japan. KLNwoing when buses and Metrostop running... these are all basic things that everyone MUST know before they land.\n\nThings usually work out in the end, but cause grief and anxiety until then. Help yourself and do some planning beforehand.",

I must've looked confused or something because this friendly Japanese man (in his 60s I suppose) walked up to me and asked in English where I needed to go. I told him where, and he proceeded to give me directions to the platform I had to go on. I didn't ask for help nor need it, but I thanked him profusely just the same and went on my way almost teary-eyed because it was so unexpected and nice :')",

Alternatively I can spend a fraction of that for an unlimited data SIM card. I spent 7000 yen on a 30 day unlimited LTE SIM card when I was in Japan this past winter, and it was completely worth it. I used 36GB of data while I was there. That much data on a Canadian carrier would have cost me multiple times that even if I had been at home.",

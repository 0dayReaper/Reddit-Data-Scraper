    "postText": "Hi everyone,   \nI'm travelling to Japan for the first time with my friend, later this month and I was hoping this sub could help with checking the early draft of my itinerary and telling me if it's reasonable or does it require some major changes? Any advice will be very much appreciated. \n\n**Locations: Tokyo -&gt; Kawaguchiko -&gt; Kyoto -&gt; Osaka -&gt; Hiroshima -&gt; Tokyo**  \n\n\n**Day 0**: Arrive in Tokyo in the evening, explore Shinjuku.   \n\n\n**Day 1:** Teamlab borderless, Meiji Jingu, Senso-ji Temple, HP Cafe, Godzilla Head.  \n\n\n**Day 2**: Take the Fuji excursion to Kawaguchiko, Hike, visit Oishi park.  \n\n\n**Day 3**: Hike, cycle, Onsen, visit Arakurayama Sengen park.  \n\n\n**Day 4**: Take the bus to Mishima Station and board the Shinkansen to Kyoto.   \nAt Kyoto, visit Kodai-ji temple, Nishiki market and if time permits, Kiyomizudera temple.  \n\n\n**Day 5**: Day trip to Nara, come back by late afternoon and then Nijo castle, Kyoto Imperial palace and end with food at Gion.   \n\n\n**Day 6**: Early morning visit to Fushimi Inari / Bamboo grove forest (Will only have time for one of the two unless I switch Nara with one of the day trips from Osaka). Board the train to Osaka.   \n\n\nAt Osaka, Umeda sky building, Dotonbori, Tempoza ferris wheel, teamlab botanical garden  \n\n\n**Day 7:** Universal studios. End the day at Hozenji Yokocho with food/drinks. I expect to be fully exhausted by the end of the day.  \n\n\n**Day 8:** Explore Tsutenkaku, Osaka aquarium, Shinsaibashi-suji shopping street, Tsutenkaku, Tenma  \n\n\n**Day 9:** Kuromon ichiba market, Kobe beef experience, Shinsekai, Shitteno-ji, Osaka castle. (Can do a day trip to Kobe/Nara here - Optional)  \n\n\n**Day 10:** Leave for Hiroshima / Miyajima.   \nAt Hiroshima, visit peace memorial museum, atomic bomb done, hiroshima castle or Mitaki-dera.   \nTake ferry and stay at Miyajima. Visit Itsukushima shrine later once the crowd has subsided.  \n\n\n**Day 11:** Hike Mt. Misen, have an easy day just visiting nearby shrines and temples. Could do peace memorial museum and dome on this day.  \n\n\n**Day 12:** Leave for Tokyo.  \nAt Tokyo, visit Nakano Broadway, Akihabara, Skytree, Pokemon Center  \n\n\n**Day 13:** Disneyland. Expecting to be exhausted at the end of the day so will end it with some good food and drinks near Shinjuku.   \n\n\n**Day 14:** Ramen museum, Gundam factory, Senso-ji, Harajuku, Golden Gai, Piss alley or Ameyoko.   \n\n\n**Day 15:** Shrines, temples, Ginza, Hamarikyu gardens, Imperial palace, visit friends.   \n\n\n**Day 16:** Send bags off to the airport and explore more of Tokyo till noon and then leave for Narita international airport.   \n\\------  \n**Additional questions and notes:**  \n1) Would it be easier to travel with a 14 Day GREEN JR pass? Considering I might be travelling with two large bags?\n\n2) Is end of may to early june expected to be rainy?  \n\n\n3) Would getting an eSim be the best course of action for this trip over pocket wifi?  \n\n\nInterests (incase it helps): Food, drinks, unique/cultural experiences, shopping for retro pop culture merch, retro electronics, anime.  \nThank you so much for your time.",

            "comment": "For Osaka and Tokyo you should group your activities better by area/location. For example in Osaka you have Tsutenkaku and Shinsekai on separate days when Tsutenkaku is *in* Shinsekai. And in Tokyo, I would do Skytree, Akihabara and Ginza on one day seeing they are all on (very roughly) the same side of the city.\n\nOtherwise you will waste a lot of time transiting across the cities unnecessarily.",

    "postText": "My husband and I are traveling to Japan for two weeks in July! One of the experiences I am most excited about is renting yukata in Kyoto. However, I am struggling to decide on the best time to do this.\n\nWe have four days in Kyoto. We will be traveling from Hakone to Kyoto and are planning a low-key first day because of that. Here is a bare bones version of our itinerary:\n\n**Kyoto Day 1:** Train from Odawara to Kyoto in the morning, explore downtown, visit Fushimi Inari shrine at sunset.\n\n**Kyoto Day 2:** Travel to Kibune to experience kawadoko dining and the Kifune shrine.\n\n**Kyoto Day 3:** Arashiyama: Bamboo Grove, Monkey Park, explore Arashiyama area\n\n**Kyoto Day 4:** Day Trip to Nara! We plan to spend the whole day there, then return to our hotel in Kyoto.\n\n**My question is, which of these days would make the most sense to rent yukata?** \n\nThe first day seems tricky because we're traveling to Kyoto, and I don't want to stress about making an appointment when considering travel time from Hakone to Kyoto, even if we leave as early as possible.\n\nFor the second day, I am wondering how practical it would be to travel to Kibune in yukata. Thoughts? For reference, our hotel is right next to the Gion district.\n\nFor day three, almost everyone recommends visiting the bamboo grove as early as possible--way earlier than yukata rental places open. Seems like it doesn't make sense, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nOn day four we travel to Nara. Would it make more sense to rent Yukata in Nara instead of Kyoto?\n\nI would appreciate any feedback, including anything I haven't considered. Thank you!",

Otherwise, return was 6:30 same day. Let me know if you want to know the place, I\u2019ll PM you. \n\nTakes about an hour to pick out your stuff and get all setup. So plan accordingly. \n\nDefiantly get your hair done. The extra 500-1500 yen is worth it!\n\nMake reservations!\n\nConsider the weather. You might not want to get a really detailed, multilayered setup if it\u2019s hot.",

However, since so many are asking I rented from Okamoto Kimono (https://www.okamoto-kimono-en.com).\n\nI hope this isn\u2019t against the rules. \n\nThey actually had nicer material kimonos from what we saw others wearing. I don\u2019t think they were the cheapest in town, but they do have a store right outside Kiyomizu-dera temple that made going to the temple dressed up very convenient. The staff was friendly, spoke English, and were pretty quick in getting everyone setup. I really liked I could make a reservation without any deposit.",

It would also be nice to eat traditional Japanese food while dressed in Japanese garb.\n\nYukata is traditionally worn with wooden sandals which are not conducive to long distance walking at all, which is what all the days entail. You can sort of think of it as flip flops. For example, day 3 involves walking up a hill (monkey park), day 4 involves lots of walking in Nara Park, I would never do either of these in flip flops. And you are correct that the bamboo after 7:30ish is a terrible experience.",

I didn't think much of Japan summer, but if your from Florida for instance, you'll be right at home.\n\nI spent the whole day in Nara as well from Osaka (similar distance from Kyoto) and walked SO MUCH. Depends on how much you want to walk with the Yukata. Nara is more spaced out than Kyoto so keep that in mind.",

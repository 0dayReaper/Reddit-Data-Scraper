Also I would love to try some products with Hokkaido milk, if you have any recommendations. Last, I had amazing tonkatsu in Nara at Genki. I tried several locations in Tokyo and they all could not match up to it. And, I want to see some pretty sights, particularly the Sakura!\n\n## In addition to what I have listed, I was also considering Noshi Park, but it\u2019s quite out of the way and probably not worth seeing?

I was told it is illuminated.\n* Tanukikoji Shopping Street\n* Ghenghis Khan\n\n# Day 3 \n\n* ??? Open to suggestions, maybe I can reduce my stay here by a day, or have more time for another city?\n\n# Day 4\n\n* Take a train to furano, explore around there\n* See Ningle Terrace\n* Visit Furano Cheese Factory\n* Take transit to Farm Tomita\n* Hinode Park\n* eat at Marumasu? or other recommendations?\n* Shikisai No Oka\n* Kanno Farm\n* Biei Shrine\n* Hokusei-no-oka Observatory Park\n* Zerubu Hill\n* Take the bus to the blue pond\n* Go to shiraghe waterfalls\n* Go up to Tokachidake Observatory if the weather and time allows it\n* Get to Asahikawa, stay the night\n\n# Day 5\n\n* Check out the ramen village\n* Kamikawa-jinja Shrine\n* Kaguraoka Park\n* Tokiwa Park\n* Any special places or foods I should check out here?\n* I was thinking of trying Restaurant Honnete, \u3042\u3055\u3072\u5ddd\u4e95\u6cc9\uff12\u6761\u5e97 or Maruichitei\n\n# Day 6\n\n* Head to otaru\n* sushi?

The Sankaku Fish Market also had different stalls with tasty options in a casual setting. Jun no Mise in Shakotan was astoundingly good for their uni don and chirashi don. Not a sushi restaurant, but features plenty of raw seafood. I went twice in two days.",

I took a ticket and only had to wait one hour for my turn for Nemuro Hanamaru at dinner time, so try not to wander too far away. \n\nI think it's a wasted opportunity not to try Soup Curry when you're in Hokkaido cause it's a specialty there. Seems like it's better then eating a pizza with egg?",

            "comment": "Anything in Otaru is fit for a king. Find out if the nishin are running. They are great sushi when  very fresh. Otherwise, if frozen skip it. Nishin are a traditional fish run there. They used to used them for fertilizer back before my day. There is a ramen shop in Sapporo that uses shrimp shells for a base. Oh, my word is it good. That is the only place Im willing to stand in line for ramen. Sorry, can't think of the name. I don't want to burden you with my favorite places there but I really go for venison steak, smoked duck and Otaru sushi. One more thing. I went on a sushi crawl in Otaru last year. Tickets that got me sushi in about 7 sushi-yas. During winter. Good thing I had plenty of antifreeze in me.",

Fushimi inari was also a very good experience but I went before 8 am.  \n\nThat's just sites.  Taking matcha tea breaks, eating desserts, trying kaiseki and shojin ryori, shopping, was also must dos.",

It's much more relaxed, and avoids relying on Kyoto's public transport, which isn't great. My partner and I walked around Arashiyama and highly recommend it, especially if you rent bikes. It has such a beautiful atmosphere. I also recommend walking up Fushimi Inari in the early morning, truly a highlight of our trip (get there before 8am bc that's when tour groups and schoolkids started to arrive in my experience). That being said, if you can add even one more day in Kyoto, that's the way to go!",

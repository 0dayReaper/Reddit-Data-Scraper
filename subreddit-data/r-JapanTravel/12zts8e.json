    "postText": " \n\nHi all, another Itinerary check! My wife and I will be travelling in September. Feeling relatively comfortable enough now to start prebooking everything we need. We're avid food and culture travellers but we've spent the last 2 years travelling Asia so are a bit templed out if our itinerary looks a bit temple-bare! Thrown in a few touristy things for entertainment but hope to come away with a feel for Japan, the food and the people. We havent schedules: Sumo wrestling (its on whilst we're in Tokyo so hope to grab a booking), kabuki, Cooking classes or Food tours yet - any recommendations welcome! Anything in \\[brackets\\] we've left as optional incase we don't have time or are tired/want to wander elsewhere\n\n17/09 - Arrive Haneda 17:15, Travel to Shinjuku check in to our hotel and go find some dinner then sleep\n\n18/09 - Imperial palace \\[and Yushukan Museum\\]\n\nTokyo Station for Lunch (Kitchen Street or Ichiban Gai?)\n\n\\[Teamlabs Planets - not sure on this as just seems like somewhere to take photos and worried it will be too busy to feel immersive or moving\\]\n\nDrinks in either Shinjuku or Ropongi Hills - Perhaps a cooking class or Food tour today instead\n\n19/09 - Asakusa Senso-ji and Asakusa-Jina and walk towards Kaminarimon Gate\n\nWalk around Ueno, go to the park maybe a museum\n\nAkibahara\n\n14:00 - Cultural experience with Matcha tea ceremony, Japanese Dance show, Kimono dressing, Calligraphy and origami\n\nStreet Go Karting\n\nKabukicho Tower for some dinner and drinks, Golden Gai if we want to continue the drinking\n\n20/09 - Shibuya for the spectacle crossing, Hachiko, Shibuya Sky for the view\n\nCheck out Harajuku \\[Yoyogi park\\]\n\nRoppongi hills for dinner\n\n21/09 - Day trip to Nikko\n\nTemple, Edo Wonderland, maybe a private onsen/Sake or Cycling Tour\n\n22/09 - Leave Tokyo to arrive in Kyoto at 14:00 staying 10 mins walk from Nishiki Market\n\nCheck out the Market and Shinkyogoku Shopping Street\n\nGear Non-verbal Theatre show\n\n23/09 - Early morning head to Fushimi Inari\n\nThen over to Gio-ji Temple\n\nArashiyama Bamboo Grove if we haven't had enough yet\n\n\\[Arashiyama Monkey Park\\]\n\nFine dining for dinner if we can get a reservation - Recommendations welcome :)\n\n24/09 - Nara day trip\n\n25/09 - Self Walking tour of Higashiyama taking in the hits of Gion and a bunch of temples/scenic street and sights\n\nEnding at Jisho-Ji\n\nDinner nearby\n\n26/09 - Head to Hiroshima to arrive around 15:00 staying near the train station\n\nOkonomimura for dinner \\[or two\\]\n\n27/09 - Souffle Pancakes for breakfast (Recommendations welcome!)\n\nA Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Museum\n\nKagura Performance in the evening\n\nAny recommendations for dinner?\n\n28/09 - Miyajima for the day have a relaxed/early evening for a chaotic 2 days of travelling ahead\n\n29/09 - Head to Mt Koya for a tempe stay (Around 5 hours travelling)\n\n30/09 - Wake up early for the morning Rituals then leave around 10:00 back To Tokyo Haneda Airport hotel\n\n01/10 - Say goodbye to our first, but hopefully not last, trip to japan!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe know the stay in Mt Koya is hectic but we are prepared for it. We will travel for around 5 hours there arriving around 14:00, our temple has no curfew so we will hopefully enjoy 3 or so hours daylight exploring and then the evening explore the cemetary/area. We will then wake up again for about 05:45 and be leaving just after 10:00 so will see a bit more before leaving and then a 6 hour slog to our airport hotel!\n\nAny critique, criticism or suggestions welcome! We've had our trip cancelled 4 times due to covid (Having originally planned it all in 2019) so changing and adapting everything has been a bit disheartening and overwhelming at this point so we are worried we might miss some glaring issues. We are comfortable with the travel and amount of hotel changes we have done this on previous trips utilizing domesitc/international flights without issue - albeit the issue of leaving somewhere and wanting more but thats what second and third trips can be for!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMain questions:\n\n\\-Would you cut anything?\n\n\\-Would you add anything?\n\n\\-Any recommended cooking classes or Food tours in either of these locations?",

Koyasan might not be far from Kyoto, but it's a bit of a hassle to get there (you need to take a combination of 3-4 trains + bus).\n\nIt will allow you to make the most of Koyasan and rush it less, spending time in Okunoin and even do some hiking. We did Miyajima / Haneda, travel time is 7 hours door-to-door.\n\nAlso, browse Tabelog to book restaurants in advance in Kyoto.",

However, simply make sure to have dinner in the places full of tourists during the day (higashiyama or Gion), it's pricey but the dinner will be great and you can stroll these areas empty at night.\n\nMost restaurants will take online reservation, but only through the japanese version of their websites, so use google translator to navigate the forms.",

We were only planning a day trip to Miyajima do you think we should stay the night whilst we're changing hotels anyway? \n\nIs it a must to prebook dinner/restaurants or can you still walk-in/queue? Loads of places seem to require prebooking since covid which sucks as it means making a tighter itinerary for travelling!",

But then, you can still go to izakayas and enjoy more casual food, or even in shopping malls, which might sound weird for Westerners, but the food is actually great there.\n\nAnd yes, stay in Miyajima if you can, the island is packed in the day but when it empties at night, it's magical. And it gives you the option to hike Mount Misen alone if you wake up early in the morning.",

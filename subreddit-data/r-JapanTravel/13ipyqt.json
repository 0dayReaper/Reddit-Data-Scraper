    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm taking a day trip (yes, I know, would've been nice to spend more days) to Kyoto with my girlfriend next monday (22th of May).  \nI'd like to hear some thoughts on our planned itinerary. I have been doing some thinking about how long we could spend at each spot, and to me it seems like there should be time to do all this. But let me know if you think otherwise.\n\n* 9:09 am, arrive with Shinkansen \n* Grab some to-go food/snacks from e.g. nearby 7-11\n* Make our to the **Bamboo Grove &amp; Forest**\n * San-In Line train to Saga-Arashiyama Station\n * Free with JR Pass\n* **Kameyama Park**\n * See some wild monkey if we're (extremely?) lucky\n * Visit observation deck\n* **Tenryu-ji Temple**\n * Probably only see the garden\n * Maybe also see inside really quickly (extra 300 yen)\n* **Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama**\n * Walk here\n * Feed some monkeys\n * Make our way up to the \"**Peak Rest House**\" where there are free roaming monkeys(?)\n* Make our way to **Nishiki Market**\n * Planning on it being about 2pm at latest by this point (2pm when leaving Monkey Park, that is)\n * ~1hr bus \n * Or ~20min faster(?) by switching trains: Arashiyama Station \u2192 Katsura Station \u2192 Karasuma Station train\n * Eat and explore\n * Spend at latest until 4.30pm here. If leaving 2pm from Monkey Park, should give us about ~1.5h here (is this too little?)\n* Make our way to **Kiyomizu-dera**\n * Walk or bus+walk\n * Want to be here probably at latest 5pm(?) (seeing as it closes 6pm)\n* Make our way to **H\u014dkan-ji Temple**\n * Walk through Sanneizaka and Nineizaka streets\n* **Yasaka-jinja Shrine**\n* **Hanamikoji Street**\n* Maybe something more near here if time (any suggestions?), check in ends at 10pm at our accommodation\n\nAlso next morning after waking up, we're planning on heading to Fushimi Inari super early before catching a train to Osaka.\n\nThanks for any thoughts!",

And it's (according to Google Maps) ~45-90mins to Nishiki market from the top of the monkey park.\n\nAnd yeah, taxi is starting to sound really appealing for Monkey Park - Nishiki Market (though Google Maps says a taxi wouldn't even be much faster, but maybe it overestimates traffic). But I don't see the need for a taxi anywhere else on this itinerary. I only wonder how does one get a taxi? Say I want a taxi to the Monkey Park, how would I go on about doing that.",

Long day at work.\n\nSo. When we, or at least, I say taxi/cab, we mean any connection you would take a bus. \n\nAssuming your itinerary and you coming from Tenryuji, either the front entrance or more likely the back entrance at, you would never ever take a bus or a taxi to get to the monkey park. its like a 5-10 minute walk door to door, where you could take a taxi. they wont drive onto the temple grounds to pick you up and they wont drive you up the monkey park hike. Okay, I may be wrong, and they might drive a little further than I expect. but still, thats not what we mean. its both arashiyama. we expect you to walk.  \n\nwe mean to take a taxi when you transfer from arashiyama to nishiki and when you transfer to kiyomizu dera",

I would feel more confident with  just Arashiyama/ Nishiki (though it does shut down so just an early dinner here at 5 or I would suggest) There's another shopping district that kind of bleeds into it that stays open later.",

This is already pretty much the earliest shinkansen which has us waking up in Tokyo before 5am.  \nOr well, I guess there is [one](https://i.imgur.com/h1BLxWk.png) which is 1hr earlier in Kyoto, but it has us doing 3 transfers and waking up super early.",

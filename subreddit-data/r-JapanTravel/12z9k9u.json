    "postText": "\nI'm planning a Hokkaido trip in Jan 2024. Part of the driving road trip is a 4 days (tentatively) snowboarding session.\n\nI'm kinda stuck deciding between Kiroro Clubmed, vs Hilton Niseko packages.\n\nIt's 4 of us, two of which are advanced snowboarders who could just go non stop for 4 days. The other 2 are our S.O. who are first time snowboarding, and might not be that fully enthusiastic about it.\n\nConsiderations so far:\n1. Clubmed\n- all in drinks and meals, no need to figure out lunch and dinner every day in between and after sessions (non stop good Jap food + alcohol)\n- comes with instructors, suitable for the first timers, and they have instructors for advanced riders\n- pricier by a lot\n- not much night ski lifts\n- not sure about the ski routes, haven't been there\n\n2. Niseko Hilton\n- been there and had an awesome experience before\n- go for ski runs late till the last lift\n- less stuff to do for our partners if they end up wanting to rest or not so keen on continuing to ride\n\nAppreciate any suggestions. Especially those that have been to Club med.",

            "comment": "the two kiroro club meds are both new. The Peak only started last year and the Grand is hosting first snow season end of this year.\n\nClub Med food are decent I heard (friends stayed in the Tomamu one for two years in a row). There are enough variety to keep their family happy for a week stay.\n\nApparently snow is good there. I'd avoid Niseko personally... Might just as well go to Perisher since it is all Aussies and well... not necessarily closer or cheaper haha (9hour drive for me and shitting accommodation compared to what you get in Japan).\n\nBut both places haven't got a lot to do if you don't ski/snowboard. But probably more to do in a clubmed (and you don't have to worry about food etc trying to decide that and plan kill brain cells. I only look for half-board options  these days. Then again, we go with kids...)\n\nFurano may be a safer bet if you are wondering if your partner gets board, at least town centre is a bus ride away from New Prince Hotel. There is also onsen.",

            "comment": "First:\n\n&gt;non stop good **Jap** food\n\nPerhaps you don't know, but this is a slur. Please be respectful and use the whole word \"Japanese\".\n\nI've never skied Kiroro, but just going by the trail map, I can tell that Niseko has a lot more trails and variety. Are you more into powder boarding or terrain park riding? Because Kiroro doesn't have much for the latter. Nor do they have a lot of advanced on-piste trails. They do have good sidecountry from what I've read. Niseko is so big that they can pretty much cater to anyone.\n\nAre you sure the Clubmed food is so good? I've never been to this particular resort, but outside of ryokan, I've never been very impressed by hotel meal plans.\n\nAlong the same lines, since Kiroro is less build up than Niseko, there's not nearly the same apr\u00e8s ski scene. In Niseko, there's a huge variety of restaurants and bars to choose from. Bear in mind that the bulk of those would be over in Hirafu, but if you get the Niseko United lift pass (and you really should to be able to ski the whole mountain), bus transfers are free.\n\nPerhaps there is less to do within the Hilton hotel itself, but there's plenty to do in Niseko.",

Use all the context you want, but people are going to see that one word and throw out everything else you said. You might not see much wrong with it, but then you're not the one being slurred. My advice: don't use it.\n\n&gt;I've heard feedback from peers who've been to Clubmeds in other locations, is that the full board package has great food generally, and is basically a \"switch off your mind and enjoy\" type of experience.\n\nI'm not a resort-going person, so perhaps I'm biased. But I like to explore what an area has to offer with food. For example, in Hokkaido, there's lots of seafood, miso ramen, curry soup ramen, grilled lamb, etc. Perhaps the resort has all those and more, but I'd prefer to go to restaurants that specialize in the food I'm getting.\n\n&gt;The last time I was in Niseko without a car, we were kinda tied to shuttle bus timings and wait times, and had a bit of an issue figuring out food every night, before jumping on to shuttle bus back to hotel.\n\nIt can be a little annoying, but I found the shuttle bus to be pretty convenient, even though I was even further afield when I went. Perhaps pick a place in Hirafu? The Niseko Tokyu Grand Hirafu would be comparable to the Hilton Niseko Village, since it's right at the gondola.\n\n&gt;With that said, we might be renting a car this time round, so may solve this issue.\n\nYeah, a car opens up a lot of options. Just bear in mind the zero-tolerance policy on drinking and driving in Japan. You might also consider how tired you'll be after a day of riding. Also, have you ever driven in heavy snow?",

We got the 2 meal option last year but then meals are a bit of a headache because there are a few places to choose from. Most are walkable via in door tunnels.",

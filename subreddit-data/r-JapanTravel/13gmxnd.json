    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm excited to embark on a solo trip to Japan from August 2nd to 25-26th and I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to make the most of my time in the country. I am particularly interested in exploring off the beaten path destinations, utilizing the JR Pass for transportation, and finding ways to avoid the heat and humidity.\n\nHere's my current itinerary:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**August 2-5: Shizuoka 3 Nights**Explore Traditional Craft Shops in Shizuoka City: I am particularly interested in traditional Japanese crafts. Are there any specific craft shops or areas in Shizuoka City that are known for their craftsmanship?\n\nJapanese Papermaking (Washi): I've always been fascinated by the art of papermaking. Are there any workshops or studios in Shizuoka where I can experience this traditional craft firsthand?\n\nVisit Craft Villages in Izu Peninsula: I've heard that the Izu Peninsula is home to several craft villages. Which ones would you recommend visiting to immerse myself in local artisanal traditions?\n\n**August 6-8: Kyoto 3 Nights**Visit Pottery Festival: I've always admired Japanese pottery. Are there any pottery festivals or events happening in Kyoto during my visit? I'd love to witness the skills of the local potters and perhaps even purchase some unique pieces.\n\nVisit Manga Museum: As a fan of manga and anime, I definitely want to visit the Manga Museum in Kyoto. Are there any particular exhibits or events happening around that time that I should be aware of?\n\n**August 8-10: Fukuoka 3 Nights**\n\nParticipate in an international sports competition.\n\nExplore Fukuoka as a city: I would love to explore the local attractions and hidden gems in Fukuoka. Any recommendations for off the beaten path places to visit, eat, or shop?\n\nVisit Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine: I've heard great things about this shrine.\n\nIs there anything specific I should know or see when visiting Dazaifu Tenmangu?\n\n**August 11:** TBD, But the plan is to get out of the Kyushu area and into the North. I asked multiple people and the consensus is: If you can go to the north. Does anybody have convicing arguments tot stay in Kyushu area?\n\n**August 11-13: Morioka 2 Nights**\n\nExplore Morioka and its attractions, such as Morioka Castle Ruins Park and the historic streets of Morioka.\n\nDiscover traditional crafts like Nanbu Tekki (ironware). I plan to visit the Morioka Handi-Works Square. Are there any specific shops or artisans I should check out for Nanbu Tekki products?\n\n**August 14-15: Hachinohe 2 Nights** \n\nTake a train from Morioka to Hachinohe (approximately 1 hour).Explore Hachinohe and its attractions, including Kabushima Shrine and Hachinohe Yatai Village.I'm interested in local crafts, particularly Enburi masks. Are there any craft shops or markets in Hachinohe where I can find unique Enburi masks or witness the craft-making process firsthand?\n\n**August 15-19 Aomori 3 Nights**\n\nTake a train from Hachinohe to Aomori (approximately 1 hour).Explore Aomori and its attractions, including the Nebuta Warasse Museum and Aomori Bay Bridge.I've heard about Tsugaru Lacquerware. Are there any recommended craft shops or galleries in Aomori where I can find authentic Tsugaru Lacquerware pieces?\n\n**August 20-22:**  \\- Somewhere between Tokyo and Aomori TBD (3 nights). Open for Suggestions\n\n**August 22-26th Tokyo** \\- Saw Tokyo before so I am still planing this part.",

Maybe cut out a few of your Tokyo days and shoot for Hakodate - Noboribetsu - Sapporo? If you\u2019re wanting to escape the heat Hokkaido is one of the best options.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do Hokkaido, then maybe Yamagata?\n\nEdit: I believe that there is an Ainu Museum near Noboribetsu where you can explore traditional crafts and learn about the culture and history of the Ainu people.",

My itinerary includes three night in Sapporo, two in Hakodate, two in Aomori, two in Hachinohe, and five in Sendai with side trips from these to Otaru, Noboribetsu, Hirosaki, Kakunodate, Matsushima Bay, Hiraizumi, and Yamadera. All using JR Pass. I'm not into crafts but will study your ideas.",

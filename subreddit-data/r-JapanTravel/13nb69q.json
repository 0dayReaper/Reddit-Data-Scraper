    "postText": "Hello! I am currently in gunma but I'm struggling to map out my routes/times. I've frequently found that Google maps does not provide routes(except by car, no bus or train) For example coming from Nikko area it gave me no route options to my minakami hotel stay. If I selected just from the Nikko station to jomokogen, it did show a route on the JR lines. However it does not catch the bus routes here in minakami so planning on getting around is tedious as I have to ask for help planning as the local bus schedules are all in Japanese. It's 50 minutes from the station to our hotel so a taxi is prohibitively expensive. \n\nFor another example Google maps gives no route options from jomokogen to takumi no sato. There is a JR shinkansen from jomokogen to takumi no sato so it's weird it doesn't but it is what it is.\n\nI've found this site (given to me by a hotel) that *sometimes* helps but I'd not that user friendly (no maps, paid service)...\n\nhttps://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/\n\nDoes anyone have any English sites that I can use with maps to helpe search for timetables and routes?",

I like knowing what I am getting into ahead of time.\n\nGood luck!",

There should be a shinkansen approximately every 10 minutes since one leaves every 10 minutes for the west from Tokyo, though I also have had it give me limited expresses, when going to Osaka because though the train trip is short, when you include changing at Shin-Osaka, limited expresses get you there at the same time.  I believe there is an option to get routes via cost though.  It's like looking for driving routes without tolls.",

    "postText": "For easy reference I will be dividing this review based on cities.\n\n\\#Tokyo\n\n\\- **Sutamina-En ( Yakiniku)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1323/A132305/13003777/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1323/A132305/13003777/)\n\nTabelog award silver 2017, gold 2018, silver 2019. It is not the easiest of places to get to. I suggest a taxi straight from the train station and be there at 4pm although it opens at 6pm. Yes 4pm, you read that right. The line gets really long quickly and if you do not get into the first seating you are gonna have a long wait (about 2hours plus).\n\nFood pics - [https://imgur.com/a/5AY3EnM](https://imgur.com/a/5AY3EnM)\n\nThe lady boss is extremely friendly for those that can speak chinese, shes from Taiwan. She took really,really good care of us ie gave us extra side dishes, let us try one of their more expensive sake. Theres also an English menu but I didnt really meet any tourists down there. All locals. The beef that they use here is all A5 wagyu and it makes a big difference. Extremely flavourful, tender,  juicy. Dont even bother to think. Just go. Missing this place during your Japan trip is just criminal. Yakiniku at its finest.\n\n**let me share with you guys one incident on why I rate this place so highly. The first time I reached there at 4:45pm I only made it to the second seating, I only got in close to 8pm.\n\nOn our last day in Tokyo we had an 8pm train to Matsumoto. However we wanted to come back again to also thank the lady boss for being so kind to us. We got there at 4pm, dragging our luggage behind us on a weekend. There was already 20+ people in the queue. We were crushed. However amazingly at 5 plus when their guy came out to take orders we were told that we managed to make in into the 1st seating.\n\nSo we waited until 6pm but as the eager customers were ushered in bit by bit until it finally came to our turn they told us that inside was full. We had to wait for the second seating. So we were disappointed again. We had to weigh the options of hoping to get in around 7pm have a quick bite and rush back for the 8pm train or try our luck on the 9pm train. We decided to wait until 7 to see if anyone would somehow leave early.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about having yakiniku on a weekend. You go in with ur best buds to have the meat feast of your life. You drink, you eat, you order somemore. One eating session takes about 1.5 to 2 hours. When 7pm came about we sadly informed the staff that we would be forfeiting our queue and we requested to take back our luggage from their store which they kindly help us to store earlier. As I was wearing my bags and taking my luggage, the big boss himself came rushing out and told me to wait for 2 mins. He will get me a table. Apparently the staff told their boss about our situation and the boss managed to get a Japanese couple inside to leave early to accommodate us. As we entered the restaurant amazed we saw the boss and the female boss apologising to those 2 profusely.\n\nThis act really impacted me greatly. They went out of their way to let us dine at their place one last time, made sure our food had first priority over others, apologised to us over the 1st&amp;2nd seating incident ,helped us to order their signatures and lastly got a taxi for us to the train station. We made it for the 8pm train.\n\nI doubt many other places in japan would do that for 2 tourists. Hence this is why I rate this place so highly.\n\nDamage: 13,000-17,000 yen for 2 pax. But for the quality and amount it was certainly worth it imo.I went there twice.\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Menya Itto (Ramen)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1312/A131204/13111737/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1312/A131204/13111737/) /  [https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/27327.html](https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/27327.html) \n\nTabelog 2019 Bronze. 3rd ranked Tsukemen on ramendb. I use ramendb and tabelog these 2 websites to source for ramen spots in Japan. Just use google translate to navigate, its a goldmine of ramen shops that you have never heard in your life or from tripadvisor websites. Put in some effort and you will be rewarded. Easily accessible, recommended time to get there is 10am to get a queue ticket as well as to buy your ramen from the ticket machine and hand it over to their guy. Ask for the english menu. Reaching at 10am gets you in the first seating at 10:55 to 11am. The good thing about itto that the queue moves fast. Many Japanese male adults finished slurping their bowl of ramen heaven in less than 10 mins. And here I thought I was a fast eater myself. Choose the 1300 yen special tsukemen or the char siu tsukemen. The former gives seaweed the other gives you more pieces of pork. \n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/HuukJCy](https://imgur.com/a/HuukJCy)\n\nPeople come here for Tsukemen not for the ramen. My girlfriend had the shio ramen and regretted it.Hence we went 2 times lol. Noodles are bloody chewy, broth is a rich mix of meat and seafood flavor that does not leave you dying of thirst after every slurp, the menma (bamboo shoots)has a firm bite and a really good flavor but I need to give special mention to that egg of menya itto. Ive eaten at a few highly rated ramen shops in Japan but my effing god, no one else even comes close to Itto's egg. The yolk is so well seasoned with what I feel is not just normal soy sauce. Just go try it, and do add an additional egg while you are there. Another one of those \"dont think, just go\" places. Look I wanted to try Tomita ok  [https://tabelog.com/en/chiba/A1203/A120302/12000422/](https://tabelog.com/en/chiba/A1203/A120302/12000422/) /  [https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/282.html](https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/282.html) but it was just too far.\n\nDamage: 1,300 yen\n\nOverall: 5/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Toshi Yoroizuka Mid Town (Dessert)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13037382/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13037382/)\n\nThey have a seating area for dine in customers. Menu was about 5-6 dessert items. Seemed average to me only. Wont return.\n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/jFmEebG](https://imgur.com/a/jFmEebG)\n\nDamage: 3000+ yen for 2\n\nOverall: 2/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Toricho (Yakitori)**[https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1321/A132102/13058892/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1321/A132102/13058892/)\n\nTabelog 2019 Bronze. Wanted to try their foie gras hotpot so made a reservation. But you do not need to make one, restaurant was surprisingly empty. Only 2 other groups were in the restaurant. When we reached we were told that they could not serve as the hotpot as the minimum people required was 4pax. We were really disappointed but agreed to have their omakase menu which was about 10+ dishes? Cant really remember exactly.\n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/5JEBitP](https://imgur.com/a/5JEBitP)\n\nThey serve chicken sashimi so take note for picky eaters. Wasnt exactly the most delicious thing there but o well I managed to down it with a few glups of beer. Cooked chicken dishes were good. Standout dishes were the fried chicken, chicken thigh skewers as well as the porridge. You can choose for a porridge or noodle to end off the meal. Both were very good. Desert was sweetened tomatoes. Kinda disappointed to be honest. Wasnt really blown away but was just pretty good yakitori that i feel i could have found else where for a fraction of the price. Might return for the foie gras hotpot though.\n\nDamage: 4,500yen for 1\n\nOverall: 2.5/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Sushi Dai (Sushi)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1313/A131307/13227096/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1313/A131307/13227096/)\n\nWhats a Tokyo trip without the 4am pilgrimage to the legendary Sushi Dai? My advice is to reach there about 4.15 to 4.30 for 1st seating. And your only option is a taxi or if you drive by car. Public transport won\u2019t open so early so do take note. We reached at 4.20 and there was already a queue of close to 10 people infront. They will come out at around 5 plus to ask for your dietary restrictions as well as your order (everyone went for the omakase). Its about 4500 yen for 11 pieces if i recall correctly.\n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/OUlsoW7](https://imgur.com/a/OUlsoW7)\n\nSushi for me is pretty much split into 2 camps. Either it tastes freakin great and packs a huge load of flavor or its just pretty bland but chewy stuff. Sushi Dai has a pretty good mix of both but im more inclined towards the former. I mean the flounder, squid, white fish are all ok but to me they are boring. I much prefer the ikura roe, uni, otoro kind of pieces and the good thing about here is that after you finish your course they let you order whatever you like. It was freakin awesome, just go order that piece or pieces that you have always wanted to try dont feel shy. Overall, imo if its your first time in Japan, just wake up, grab a cab go and queue for this. I can safely say you wont regret it. I recommend staying at a hotel near sushi Dai so u can take a short hike over in the morning,etc Hotel Daiwa ( this brand of hotel is really good and quite reasonably priced)\n\n**i know how some people might ask if sushi dai is overrated and this is my opinion. Some sushi pieces will taste good irregardless of the Chef skill since it\u2019s heavily dependent on the freshness of the ingredients. The pieces that come to my mind on my favourite sushi pieces are Uni,otoro, ikura and sweet shrimp. All these taste so much fresher, cleaner and sweeter than those I get back in my home country. At sushi dai you aren\u2019t going to get Super crispy seaweed, red vinegared rice, aged/smoked sushi, or any little tweaks that other chefs might do for their own sushi. What u get is a sushi place that due to its proximity to the Toyosu fish market is able to offer me my fav sushi pieces for a fraction of the price in my home country yet 2 to 3 times the flavour. So I say to you guys who might still be on the fence over visiting this place, just go and have the Omakase. But the real fun begins after it. Go ahead and try what the Sea of Japan can offer you. Pretty sure you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nDamage: 10,300 yen for 2 ( we ordered about 4 extra pieces in total)\n\nOverall: 4/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Hidemi Suguino (Dessert)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1302/A130202/13002285/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1302/A130202/13002285/)\n\nTabelog 2019 Bronze. Opens at 11am, get there at 10.40 and you will be fine. Pro tip, choose the cakes towards the left of the counter while facing it ( only those few can be eaten at the shop, do not feel pressured and rush through your selection even though theres a queue behind you of hungry and angry people).  You can choose 2 cakes to eat in so CHOOSE WISELY. Takeaway limit im not sure but we took away 2.Staff will stop you even if you try to take a photo of your own cake while eating it. Too bad i managed to snag one shot \uff1a/ Oh yea you have to order a mandatory drink to go along with your cake so take note of the extra cost for those planning their budgets.\n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/jAFXDnO](https://imgur.com/a/jAFXDnO)\n\nHow was it? Pretty good yea, one of the better places in Japan. The first piece in my picture link is apparently their signature? and only rumoured to have only 10 a day? Im not too sure on this as Im pretty sure they have more than that. Will i return? Yep\n\nDamage: 4000+ yen for 2 pax\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Ningyocho Imahan (Sukiyaki)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1302/A130204/13003059/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1302/A130204/13003059/)\n\n16,000 yen for 3 slices of beef. So 2 pax it came up to 30,000+ yen for 6 slices of beef.\n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/f3pi8ol](https://imgur.com/a/f3pi8ol)\n\nFor that price I could have gone to Sutamina-En and ate 10 times the amount. Beef was good but I found out it tastes much better grilled ala Yakiniku style. This place really made me feel that Sutamina-En was so much value for money. Rest of the meal was forgettable. Appetizers , filler vegetables &amp; dessert was meh.Wont be returning and I urge people who might want to try this place to stay away.\n\n\\*\\*\\*TAKE NOTE\\*\\*\\* The prices on their website for reservation even after you have listed for 2 people is actually only for 1!!! This was something that pissed me off greatly. I thought it was supposed to be 16,000yen for  2pax. !Beware!\n\nDamage: 30,000+ yen\n\nOverall: 1/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Tempura Fukamachi (Tempura)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1302/A130202/13004105/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1302/A130202/13004105/)\n\nTabelog 2019 Silver. I only found 3 dishes that met my expectations. The prawn, the rice dish and the dessert. Dont get my wrong, the batter was really good but vegetables and white fish through the entire course made it so boring that I found myself waiting for the meal to end and go out to the nearest yakitori joint.\n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/IYJbs2m](https://imgur.com/a/IYJbs2m)\n\nDamage:26,000 yen both pax\n\nOverall:2/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Obana (Unagi) [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1324/A132401/13003509/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1324/A132401/13003509/)\n\nTabelog 2019 Bronze. Got there at 10.30 and made it only to 2nd seating. Loads of people in the queue, most of them locals. Had better grilled eel in my own country, extremely disappointed. Large is 6000 yen, medium is 5000 yen if i recall correctly. Not recommended. I wanted to try Kabuto  [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1305/A130501/13016660/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1305/A130501/13016660/)  but couldnt get a reservation there.\n\nFood pics:  [https://imgur.com/a/Evm7IPQ](https://imgur.com/a/Evm7IPQ)\n\nDamage: 11,000+ yen both pax\n\nOverall:2/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Narikura (Tonkatsu)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1319/A131905/13236380/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1319/A131905/13236380/)\n\nBit into the pork and the only thought was \"sh\\*t, this tastes so f\\*\\*\\*\\*n good\". Do note I went to the main store which is helped by the original Chef and only takes reservations online via omakase website. They have another outlet which accepts walk-ins helmed by his apprentice. Had both the filet and the loin. The filet \uff08round balls, I had the chateaubriand cut which was one of the most expensive items on the menu due to its rarity\uff09 were leaner and had a firmer bite. But I preferred the fatty loin, there was another option that was like special rib loin but it was sold out when I got there at 8pm. So if you are going to this place I strongly recommend you try that special rib loin first . Type of pork just choose tokyo X seems like everyone was choosing it. I only had one Tonkatsu meal in Tokyo but i will wager 10,000yen anytime that this is the absolute best place for tonkatsu in Tokyo hands down. Batter is ethereally light and crunchy and that pork..let me describe it to you. You know how aging beef gives its a stronger flavor? This is how I would describe that pork. Immediately upon sinking my teeth into it I was strucked by the strong yet clean taste of pork. No gaminess whatsoever, its 100% pure pork flavor. The LOIN is such a perfect balance of fat and meat that the mouthfeel is so disgustingly luxurious yet it does not leave an oily or nauseating aftertaste that you get from too much greasy food. And the tonkatsu batter gives it that crunch which makes it all the more addictive. They had a collection of sauces to go with your pork, mustard, worcestershire, seaseme oil, soy sauce eg but whatever you choose to complement your pork, the flavor of the pork still shines strongly through. Thats how flavorful their pork is, its pork cutlet on jap steriods.Take note they open their reservations every month in advance and slots fill up quickly.\n\nFood pics: [https://imgur.com/a/sk27l24](https://imgur.com/a/sk27l24)\n\nDamage: 11,000 yen both pax\n\nOverall:5/5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kinda rounds up what I ate in tokyo. Will do up a further review on more restaurants that I tried during my trip if I have the time. Oh yea, I did try Ichiran. And its f\\*\\*\\*\\*n bullshit ramen. Just skip it and save yourself a valuable dinner slot somewhere else. I\u2019ll like to add on that this is solely my opinion. For starters, my Girlfriend loves it. I do not have any animosity against people who like it.\n\n\\*\\*TL/DR\\*\\* In Tokyo, top 3 places are Sutamina-En(Yakiniku), Itto (Ramen), Narikura (Tonaktsu). Sushi Dai comes in at 4th on my list &amp; Hidemi Sugino for dessert.",

            "comment": "This is a great post! I'm so sorry you had a bad experience with that expensive sukiyaki place. Honestly, sukiyaki is the sort of dish that's awesome done at home gathered around the kotatsu. It sucks you spent like 30k on it...\n\nAlso seems like a logical takeaway from this post is that the Tabelog Bronze/Silver places were not really up to snuff. Has this been anyone else's experience? I always find that the inconvenience that comes with a highly-rated tabelog page is rarely worth it. \n\nYou also seem to have spent quite a lot on some 2/5 meals. Would you do anything different next time?\n\nI also agree Ichiran is overrated and overpriced. And consistency is really NOT an issue. All their food comes pre-made. The staff just heat it up. Japanese people always mention how there's no knives at Ichiran locations. It's not really handmade, lovingly crafted stuff like you'd get at a local shop.",

I can sympathize with OP being non-plussed by the subtleties of leaner proteins and vegetables when he has his eyes set on a dish like foie gras shabu shabu.",

Also, if you wait in line for Ichiran, you're doing it wrong.\n\nI appreciate Ichiran the same way I appreciate McDonald's. It's always around, it's always the same, it's open at 4am, it's salty as fuck and it satisfies an immediate craving for something trashy but good. If I want incredible ramen, I'll go get it somewhere else.",

Tsukememmichi and Yakumo  are not all that different.

Batter maybe a little on the heavy side at Marugo too. \n\nThat is comparing it to Narikura so Marugo is  still top tier tonkatsu in every respect and cheaper too!",

There is a time and a place for it, just like there is with the fanciest and most expensive food. \n\nDoes it claim to be groundbreaking, incredible bowl of ramen made with super special ingredients sourced from some rare or famous outcropping in the mountains somewhere? No, and it shouldn't be regarded as such. Can you get better ramen at a similar price point \u2014 sure, but not at 4am!\n\nHopefully you also had a chance to sample some of the less high-end stuff Tokyo has to offer. There is delicious, incredible and affordable food (that isn't a massive chain like Ichiran) to be had in Tokyo \u2014 and it's arguably better than a lot of the more expensive, over-hyped stuff out there.",

They also give u a very hot cast iron cooker that cooks the meat within seconds unlike some places which takes forever to cook.",

I reserved it on the morning of the day itself when the window opened usually a month before. I was not able to get any 6-7pm slots already so seats get reserved very quickly. You want the earlier slots to avoid some items being sold out",

Now it's moved to Suginami which is the one where you visited.\n\nDo you know if the other one closed or do they have two branches?",

This is a long-awaited development for many fans of the Ghibli Studio films.\n\n**Some Important Information for Purchasers:**\n\n&gt;- **Tickets for entry from March 15, 2023 to April 30, 2023 will go on sale on January 10 2023 from 2pm JST.** \n\n&gt;- **Tickets will ONLY be available for Ghibli\u2019s Grand Warehouse at this time.** This is the park\u2019s main area where you\u2019ll find three exhibition rooms, a souvenir shop, restaurants and a warehouse with exhibits from previous Ghibli exhibitions.\n\n&gt;- **Entry times will be limited, with 12:00 noon entry initially the only time offered.** According to the Official Ticketing Site, \"You may only enter the park at your assigned entry time, but may stay as long as you wish until closing. Please enter Ghibli's Grand Warehouse within one hour of your reservation time. No re-entry is allowed. You can't enter the park before or after your assigned window of time. Entry times may change without notification.\"\n\n&gt;- **Ticket prices are split between weekdays and weekends/holidays:** \u00a52,000 for adults on weekdays (children aged 4-12 are \u00a51,000), and \u00a52,500 (children aged 4-12 are \u00a51,250) on weekends and holidays.\n\n&gt;- **Tickets cannot be resold (ID will be checked for the people entering the park), exchanged for a different date or time, refunded, or re-issued if lost, damaged or stolen. All members of your party must enter each area at the same time as the person whose name is on the tickets for entry to be valid.**\n\n&gt;- **The park\u2019s new international ticket site is located [here](https://ghibli-park.jp/en/ticket/ticketb.html)**, ensure you have followed any steps required to create an account in order to purchase your tickets in advance of the sales beginning. Tickets will likely go quickly, and will be very limited!\n\nGood Luck to those hoping to secure the first round of tickets!",

It feels like a laid-back and relaxed place like Shirakawa-go and Takayama etc\n\nI see Nikko in the Tochigi Prefecture in there, and I haven't heard of that. How long do you think you'll be spending there? I might add that to my trip as a stop between Gifu and Tokyo",

On the way back towards Tokyo, ik not 100% sure which places I will visit and stay at.\n\nAdmittedly, Kanazawa is the place I researched the least so far. I do agree that it feels like a relaxed area. I'm planning to look into things to do there in the coming months and decide on how long to stay then. \n\nAs for Nikko, while I also have seen much about it yet, Japan Guide highly recommended it: https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3800.html\n\nIt looks like a nice area! On my way back to Tokyo, it's not a big detour to go there from Kanazawa, so I might stay a day or too there. \n\nWhen will you go on your trip?",

How bout you?\n\nInstead of doing a lot of towns and 2-3 days at each, I'd prefer spending 5-6 days at each stop and reduce the amount of travel (even though japanese trains are fantastic). I'm hoping to savor life outside of the neon-lit hustle bustle big cities of Japan, which is why I'm looking at low-key spots like Gifu and Nikko",

How does a person not living in Japan reserve tickets for the \"Youth Hill\" and Dondoko Forest\" areas?",

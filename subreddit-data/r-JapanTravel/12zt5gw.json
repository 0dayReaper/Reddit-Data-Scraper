    "postText": "In the process of planning our second trip to Japan and need a sanity check about our travel plans during the New Year's period of 2024. I'm aware that it is an intense week of travel for local citizens and want to minimize the travel crush as much as possible.\n\nTentative current plans:\n\n22-Dec (Fri) - Arrive in Tokyo NRT via LAX  \n23-Dec (Sat) - Tokyo - take it easy, acclimate to jetlag  \n24-Dec (Sun) - Tokyo - Ghibli Museum  \n25-Dec (Mon) - Tokyo - Ghibli Museum (back-up day)  \n26-Dec (Tue) - Tokyo - Disneyland  \n27-Dec (Wed) - Tokyo - DisneySea  \n28-Dec (Thu) - Tokyo &gt; Nagoya  \n29-Dec (Fri) - Nagoya - Ghibli Park &gt; Kyoto  \n30-Dec (Sat) - Kyoto  \n31-Dec (Sun) - Kyoto  \n1-Jan (Mon) - Kyoto - Nara day-trip  \n2-Jan (Tue) - Kyoto &gt; Kanazawa  \n3-Jan (Wed) - Kanazawa - Shirakawago day-trip  \n4-Jan (Thu) - Kanazawa &gt; Osaka  \n5-Jan (Fri) - Osaka - Himeji day-trip or relaxing in Osaka  \n6-Jan (Sat) - Osaka &gt; Hiroshima  \n7-Jan (Sun) - Miyajima &gt; Tokyo  \n8-11-Jan - Tokyo (eating, shopping, possible side-trips to Kamakura, Yokohama)  \n12-Jan (Fri) - Departure  \n\n\nWe last visited in 2018. We primarily stuck to the golden route during that visit, so we're looking to do more of the smaller cities this time around.\n\nOur plans are pretty firm for the first and last week, but I've some concerns regarding the middle week that includes New Year's. We'll be two families traveling together with two children who do not enjoy being in large crowds in confined spaces, so we want to minimize running into the crush on the trains as much as we reasonably can. We will be trying to get reserved green car seating whenever we're able.\n\nQuestions/concerns:\n\n* Will the shinkansen from Nagoya &gt; Kyoto in the evening of 29-Dec (Fri) already be packed, or will most citizens be traveling that Sat instead? \n* From what I've read, traveling from Kyoto &gt; Kanazawa on 2-Jan should be against the majority flow of traffic. Is that correct?\n* Will Shirakawago be mostly back to normal by 3-Jan?\n* Will Ghibli Park likely be open on 29-Dec (Fri)?\n\nAn alternative we're considering is to do Kanazawa before Kyoto. We prefer the above itinerary, but if the following will mean running into a lot less traffic, we'll do it.\n\n29-Dec (Fri) - Nagoya - Ghibli Park &gt; Kanazawa  \n30-Dec (Sat) - Kanazawa - Shirakawago day-trip  \n31-Dec (Sun) - Kanazawa &gt; Kyoto  \n1-Jan (Mon) - Kyoto - Nara day-trip  \n2-Jan (Tue) - Kyoto   \n3-Jan (Wed) - Kyoto  \n4-Jan (Thu) - Kyoto &gt; Osaka\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

            "comment": "So, for New Year, the holiday rush usually runs from 12/29 to 1/3. Both the trains going down to Kyoto and the trains going up to Tokyo can get pretty busy during this period. In addition to that, lots of Japanese like to visit shrines during the New Year, which means any shrine, or even local trains,  will be super crowded between 1/1 and 1/3, especially in Kyoto.   \nIf I were traveling as a big group, I would go to Nagoya-&gt; Kyoto/Nara-&gt; Hiroshima-&gt; Osaka -&gt; Kanazawa -&gt; Tokyo to avoid the crowds in Kyoto during the New Year. Kanazawa is much less crowded than the other cities.   \nNo official announcement for the schedule yet, but Ghibli Park was closed on 12/29 last year.",

I like the idea of essentially starting out West and making our way back to Tokyo.\n\nWould this revised itinerary better avoid the overcrowding?\n\n24 - Tokyo &gt; Nagoya  \n25 - Ghibli Park &gt; Osaka  \n26 - Osaka - Himeji day-trip  \n27 - Osaka - Nara day-trip  \n28 - Osaka &gt; Hiroshima  \n29 - Miyajima &gt; Kyoto  \n30 - Kyoto  \n31 - Kyoto  \n1 - Kyoto &gt; Kanazawa  \n2 - Kanazawa - Shirakawago day-trip  \n3 - Kanazawa &gt; Tokyo  \n4-11 - Tokyo (Disney, Ghibli Museum, Kamakura, etc)  \n\n\nI feel like our decision is to spend New Year's in either Kyoto or Osaka. We're using Osaka as a base for day-trips in the region and dining in the evenings. Given the likely closures during that period, I'm thinking we'd be better served to be in Kyoto where most attractions should still be open (though crowded). We'd hate to be in Osaka during a time when most restaurants are closed and day trips would be difficult due to crowds. Does that make sense? \n\nWas Ghibli Park open this past Christmas?",

While restaurants typically remain open throughout Japan during the end of the year, taking a train for a day trip around that time can be inconvenient. So, your plan makes sense. If you don't mind the crowds, there are many special events that take place around New Year's, such as lit-up temples and temple bell ringing (bell ringing is only on 12/31). Staying in Kyoto should be pretty interesting.\n\nHowever, I highly recommend reserving seats for the Thunderbird on 1/1 and the Shinkansen on 1/3 as soon as possible. You can make reservations starting at 10 am (JST) one month before the boarding date. Especially, the Shinkansen bound for Tokyo is expected to be super busy because 1/3 marks the end of the New Year's vacation for most Japanese people. Additionally, it's a good idea to make dinner reservations in advance.\n\nOne more thing: As I mentioned in response to your other post, the Omicho Market in Kanazawa will be closed from 1/1 to 1/5, while Kenroku-en will be open and free of charge. Ghibli Park was open last Christmas.",

The other family traveling with us is leaving on the 7th so we need to squeeze those in before they depart.\n\nRe: Shirakawago bus -- they run on New Year's Day, so I figure the other days should be fine. I think I have a bookmark somewhere with the bus schedule that I'll share if I find it again.",

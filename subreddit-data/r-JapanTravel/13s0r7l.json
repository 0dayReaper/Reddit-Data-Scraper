Regarding the JR pass, will I need it for travel within Tokyo? If not, how much should I load into a Suica/Pasmo card?

As far as recommendations for Shibuya, Shibuya Sky is a beautiful new building with a glass rooftop overlooking the city (including a good view of the crossing), that has just recently opened up a bar on top! \n\nRegarding Tsukiji market, it definitely gets busier as the day goes on, but I think you could get away with arriving at 9 or even 9:30, giving you a good 1.5-2 hrs there before your 20 min ride to Teamlabs. Depends if you\u2019re in the mood for sashimi/seafood that early in the AM too :P\n\nAs for Skytree, idk if I\u2019m in the minority, but I personally think Skytree is worth it! It\u2019s the highest view of one of the largest cities on the planet, it\u2019s insanely cool to see from up there. I\u2019d do it if you never have!\n\nEdit to add: I hate to be a buzzkill, but I\u2019d really advise against the animal cafes :( animal welfare in Japan is abysmal, and the fewer people that patronize these businesses, the less they\u2019ll be encouraged to use/abuse the animals. Just a PSA!",

Shabuya crossing takes 10 min. 20 if you go to the Starbucks and watch from above. Would focus on eating there. Museums will take 1-2 hours max. Unless you really are into reading every card. Ramen museum is probably my favorite. If you like museums then go to the national museum. That was my favorite that wasn\u2019t ramen. There is a huge ramen food court in the basement but lines will be long .the observation towers are great for a quick look and pics but you\u2019ll wait in line longer then you spend at the top. Team labs is far from Shinjiku. Prob about 40 min by train. Would change your ticket to the opening time and go to fish market for\nLunch. Ginza will be another 30 min on train. Hope this helps. I\u2019m just finishing a month in Japan and spent 9 days in Tokyo.",

Good luck! I was 2000+ in line doing both of these things but when I checked the queue on my phone, there were well over 15,000 people in line behind me.",

            "comment": "100% you do not need JR pass. First, a JR pass only allows you to use JR lines or Shinkansen. In Tokyo there are bunch of different lines run by different companies. Such as Toei, Tobu, Odakyu, Keikyu etc. FYI both Narita airport and Haneda airport do not have a JR station.\n\nSecond is, 7 days JR pass will going to cost you 5000yen daily for 6 days. You don\u2019t need that much to use the transport. I think the average is around 1000-1500 (or 2000) if you are traveling a lot.\n\nThird. Just remember the rules, if you are not using Shinkansen for a return trip, never use JR pass.",

            "comment": "1. Kaminarimon gate- I've visited many times. My first time was late morning/mid-day and it was absolutely packed and overwhelming for me. I recommend early in the day or late in the evening to appreciate the gate itself and explore the temple, which opens at 6 am. But of course, you can arrive much later than that- a lot of shops on Nakamise St open up at 10, so you can arrive by 9:30 or so and have plenty of time to enjoy the area before it gets too busy, and still enjoy the surrounding shops. \n\n2. Skytree is neat. You get a great view and there is a cafe and some shops around to enjoy. I always like to mention that the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building in Shinjuku is free, however, and pretty much offers the same city skyline views. But the trade off is that it has less amenities and is really just a viewing point- I'd pick just one or the other, depending on where your itinerary takes you (and if you go later in the evening, the Skytree is open later, so it might be the better choice). \n\n3. Shibuya has a lot of shopping areas, things to do and see, etc. Yoyogi park is a nice place to relax and take a breather, and it's right near Meiji Jingu. Omotesando has a number of great shops and cafes/restaurants as well. Throughout Shibuya you can also find more niche shopping spots like a Nintendo store, Kitkat chocolatery, and a few character/anime/gaming shops in the area if that's to your interest. As well as more \"regular\" stuff- nice clothes, souvenirs, or just about anything else.\n\n4. I cannot speak for any specific owl/mipig cafes, but please be aware that many animal cafes in Japan are unethical and that the standards for animal treatment are very different in Japan and often inconsistently followed from one place to the next. You can find some humane and ethical ones, but be sure to do careful research first. If you're unsure I'd recommend skipping it altogether.\n\nIf your Ghibli day doesn't pan out, I can also recommend other areas to explore- Odaiba is popular, but I also really love Ikebukuro (trendy neighborhood with lots of anime/gaming merch, themed cafes, and shopping) and Ueno (known for the massive Ueno park, and tons of historic sites and wonderful museums and galleries). A day trip would also be possible to Kamakura or Kawagoe (for a mini-Kyoto-like experience), Mt Takao (for an easy day hike and shrines), and to Kawaguchiko (for Mt Fuji views and lakeside activities). Nikko is within reach as well, but the distance makes for a bit of a longer day, IMO, so it depends on your tolerance for that kind of traveling.",

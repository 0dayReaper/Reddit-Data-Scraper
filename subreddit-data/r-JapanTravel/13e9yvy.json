    "postText": "Welp, no other way to explain this. Was ushered into an all you can drink bar off the beaten path while exploring near akihabara. Only had 4 drinks, from what I can remember, but somehow blacked out and lost all memory. Which is strange because I'm an avid drinker, 180 pound male, and (thought) i knew my limits well. Regardless, the next thing I woke up to was a cell with nothing in it but a blanket. No hangover somehow, but hit my head pretty good. Once the police found me awake they did their best to communicate what happened despite not speaking any English. The only thing I was able to grasp was that they found me passed out on a busy street and once I got to the station proceeded to urinate right outside the cell(I cleaned it up for them later). They brought me out and returned all my belongings which miraculously were all there, money included, minus 20,000 yen which I presume I payed to the bar in my drunken stupor... Anyways, what I'm worried about is before they released me they took the fingerprint from my left index about 7 times on a document with no English whatsoever, so i had no idea what it was. Was I charged for a crime and I don't know about it? I was only in there for about 5 hours apparently. I was released after completing that (and sincerely apologizing 900 times). I cant seem to find any similar situations online. Very new to japan and have only been here 3 days. I'm very worried and extremely embarrassed by this, so any advice that could hopefully calm me down would be great!",

He approached me while i was walking down the street. Very happy person to talk to so I really didn't think twice when he said there was an all you can drink bar. There was a female bartender who spoke broken english, and there was even another japanese man that looked to be drinking in there. Just a small hole in the wall bar or so i thought, nothing immediatly sketchy or adult themed so i just felt safe enough. I cant even remember the name or where exactly it is. I tried looking through google maps history to try and find out. Seems i have no luck. After understanding the situation I got myself in I can't believe I was so worried about legal issues.

Both super friendly. The bar experience was perfectly fine (nothing nefarious happened) but when we left at the same time the female bartender was ending her shift. We exchanged emails and she said she was going to a party with some friends near Nishi-Shinjuku if we wanted to come. We didn\u2019t end up going (decided to go with my fellow gaijins to a Korean BBQ) but I was very tempted.\n\nUpon reflection, probably made the smart decision, although I do sometimes wonder what would have happened if I had followed up with that cute bartender.",

Regular Japanese people do have lives and jobs, but many of them are still extremely helpful.\n\nI'll give you an example - One time I took a ferry to Toba, en route to see Ise Shrine. The ferry arrived in late evening, and it was already very dark out. I figured I could ask someone at the ferry station how to get to the train station to head toward my youth hostel, but the ferry station closed the moment we arrived and everyone left in cars, leaving only a confused me and the ferry captain in the building. He noticed me and asked if I had a question. I asked for directions to the train station, and after a moment's consideration he said he could drive me directly to the youth hostel. Which he did. Not sure how far out of his way that took him, but it was at least a 20 minute drive.",

Occasionally yes there may be a friendly person who just says hi, helps you out, or makes some conversation. I've run into many ojii-sans who do this and it's pleasant.

Or you check out random new bars with a friend not alone. If you wander into to snack bar even without the drugging you'll find your bill comes to 2000 for the beer, 2000 for the drink the girl who said hi to you had, 3000 for the entry, and 2000 for the shitty nut mix they put in front of you. Maybe 1000 for the karaoke if they got you to sing a song. So one or two beers will see you presented with a bill for 10 000+. A man walking alone is prime target for these so don't follow anyway, check google maps reviews and ask other foreigners which bars they go to, if you happen to meet any.",

I have only ever stayed at business hotels or backpackers, I have never spent more than 6000 for a night in Tokyo so no idea what the kind of hotel that has a concierge would be like. I assume they could get a kick back from a place they might recommend though?  You might end up paying 2000 a beer then coming home and telling people wow Tokyo was expensive because they sent you to some overpriced tourist bar. When the locals are drinking at places that are 500-700 a beer. I used to be a cleaner in a backpackers in Tokyo and when new people arrived we would tell them all the good places to go (or just take them out with us). I also heard a lot of these 'we followed someone into this bar and the bill was $$$$$' stories as well so we would try to warn people if they were heading out to be alert. You also can't go wrong with chains, like Hub. Yeah it's cheesy but it's safe and you might meet people to go out with to somewhere better.",

I was so concerned about the fact that I could be in trouble with the police that it never crossed my mind for even a moment that I could have been drugged. For reference, it was no more than 12:30, in broad daylight (day drinking on vacation was normal for me, was). And I honestly can't even say that I physically saw a drink being poured in front of me while i was still conscious. I was naive, more focused on conversation and laughing than anything. Everyone was so nice. What little English they spoke seemed so genuine and happy. And then lights out. My credit cards are untouched somehow, but the 20k yen is still long gone, a small price to pay. I consider myself extremely lucky. As someone stated below there's a possibility that I was able to escape while I still had some sense of self, but I really can't say for sure. I'd do have some injuries, nothing major, that I originally thought was from me being a drunken fool.  Thank you everyone. I will do my best to answer any questions when i can, I sincerely appreciate you all for the wake up call. This will not change my opinion of japan or Japanese people, I still love their kind hospitality and hard working culture. I won't let my own ignorance, foolishness, and stupidity change that, i will simply learn from my mistakes. And yes, I made this account only to post this because I was embarrassed for being drunk and disorderly, but now that I know the truth I'm doubly thankful.",

They'll either drug you or extort you the old fashioned way by getting some tough guys to threaten to beat you up. They target both foreign tourists and locals. The cops generally won't do anything about it and it's easy for them to close shop and reopen somewhere else due to the lack of strict liquor laws. In future trips I'd recommend being cautious about going into places you don't have any information on. You should stick to places that are chains, featured in guide books, recommendations from your hotel or have some sort of noticeable online presence with Google reviews/etc.",

A newly wed couple on honeymoon followed a street tout (one of them pushers that try to get you into bars) into a karaoke bar and they were quickly fed a bunch of drinks and suddenly blacked out. When they woke up, their cards were charged 6000 USD in total, and the police not the bak couldn't do anything about it. !&lt;\n\nSo I doubt this was a drunken stupor, but rather the result of whatever drugs they slipped you. I highly recommend checking your bank debit and credit card(s) for any unauthorized transactions. \n\nIt is a scary situation, but the good news is that you are out of that situation now. The loss of money will sting, but you got out of it. You likely have a good amount of days left in your trip, so don't let this ruin it! Go out and see/do what you've been looking forward to. \n\nI'm packing my bags right now and will fly to Tokyo tomorrow.

I try as much as I can from discouraging others to go bar hopping etc. In many areas because as a tourist you're often a target in these areas.\n\n\nA lot of men in particular feel, consciously or not, \"immune\" to drugging because we only talk about it happening to women for the purpose of rape. This simply isn't true.\n\nIts g7 summit time so you need an appointment, but it wouldn't hurt bringing any papers from the police and speaking to the American Embassy about what happened. They'll be able to translate for you and also get you appropriate resources for an English speaking doctor if you need.\n\nGo ahead and freeze your cards if able, regardless of not seeing any transactions. Once you're back in the states, report your accounts as potentially compromised.\n\n\nFor further safety tips:\n\n Avoid drinking in well-known tourist areas, and avoid anywhere that tries to \"lure\" you in.\n\n Do not go drinking alone.\n\n Even though Japan's crime rate is low, please remember that unless you're of Japanese descent, you will always be a target. Unlike in a country with a more racially similar or diverse population or a higher immigrant population, you can't just change your clothes and the way you stand and blend in. \n\nAvoid carrying large backpacks and luggage, and instead opt for a \"day\" bag or backpack. \n\nOpting for a chain bar like HUB lowers your chance of the establishment actively engaging in illegal activity. \n\nIf someone ever becomes disorderly in a bar or a fight breaks out, leave immediately\n\nAvoid drinking in Shibuya on holidays like New Years and Halloween where people are most likely to party en masse. \n\nAlways drink well under your limit when not somewhere you live or are familiar with. \n\nIf an establishment ever indicates \"no foreigners\", just leave.

An attractive woman just disarms men quicker. The woman or bartender makes sure the drink is drugged and then stronger men or women take over pulling your wallet once you get sufficiently drugged up and hazy.\n\nOnce you are fully drugged out the men will either drag you to an ATM and shove your debit cards in, or just toss you somewhere nearby on the street, so you look like someone that just got too drunk. They might payoff local police to look the other way, so they might help you but not go raid the bar on your behalf unless something really really messed up happened. Getting $5000 USD stolen is not really a serious enough issue for them.\n\nSo not impossible, couples have reported getting drunk drugged, but the touts could be focusing on easier marks.",

In almost all cases, it's a scam.  Even if it's a Japanese person, if you follow them in and the customers are all foreigners, there is probably a reason, so run.\n\nEven if the tout and clients are Japanese, you never know, so it's better not to ever follow any tout, except maybe for an izakaya or chain resteraunt.\n\nYou especially want to avoid random shops in kabukicho or roppongi.\n\nIf you feel at all that the shop is shady, tell them your maximum budget ahead of time, and ask to pre pay for everything so they can't spring a big bill on you at the end.\n\nI only carry a small amount of cash, and my ATM card is set with a limit of 10,000 jpy per day, so even if I was drugged and was persuaded to tell them my PIN they wouldn't get much, but I've never had such an unfortunate experience yet.\n\nI saw Golden Gai mentioned in the comments, golden Gai is 100% fine, except possibly for that big foreigner oriented bar at the entrance.\n\nLuckily the worst that will ever happen in Japan is you might be ripped off, but that can be avoided just by staying away from rip off joints with tours that target foreign tourists.\n\nYou don't have to worry about any legal issues, the police just found you passed out and worried.  They were probably taking your fingerprint just to check your visa status.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you, but sadly the police are relatively ineffective at stopping it.  The main reason why is that it's often foreigners doing this, so when they eventually do get caught, they get deported, and someone else comes to take their place.  They also target foreigner tourists because they know they are less likely to be reported / caught.\n\nNever, ever pay at any suspicious place with a credit card.  Some places in roppongi are known to add an additional decimal zero to your bill, and you will be back in your country by the time the charges come through, making it difficult to dispute.",

One night I did a drinking tour where we got hoppy at a restaurant, beer at an izakaya, and some flights of sake at a fancy lil sake bar high up in a building. Afterwards we all went to 7-11 and were introduced to Strong Zero and drank it outside with a little crowd. I felt pretty drunk by then. My group was pretty social, which made the drinking a lot easier. I took a train from Shibuya back to Asakusa and had to stop halfway to use the bathroom. Then I went to the Family Mart next to my hotel where I bought a big Kirin and another Strong Zero. I remember taking a sip of the SZ in my room and then I woke up at 6am with my head hurting. This was only the second time I ever blacked out, the other time being with Everclear jungle juice at a party in college. I was incredibly hung over until about 3pm. I planned to meet up w my tour guide in Shinjuku for some ramen at noon, but I only ate like 3 bites before he was finished and we left. Riding the train was hell, especially while trying to stop a 55-on checked bag from rolling around. \n\nNot saying it couldn\u2019t have been drugs, but I\u2019ve fallen victim to delicious shochu that goes down like water when you\u2019re in a good mood with strangers.",

I was really freaking out that I could have signed up for a court date or something and didn't know because the entire document was in Japanese. It was a very embarrassing thing hence the burner, but now it's just depressing knowing the truth. It's my first time in japan. I failed to do proper research into these types of dangers here.",

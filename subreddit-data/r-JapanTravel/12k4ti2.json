I will be traveling with a group of 5, we all share pretty similar interests, almsot all of us are into anime of many kinds, some gaming, some gunpla etc, however we are mostly here to see the sights, eat good food, and have a good time. We arent doing any guided tours and we have already booked our hotels/airbnb, and gotten our rail passes. At the moment we have a very rough idea  of what we would like to do in each area, so im looking for a few things\n\n**Questions**\n\nA. any advice on location/tips/tricks related to specific locations\n\nB. Any recommendations on things to do in each location (things that might be less crowded/touristy) Specifically good food locations that might not need a reservation\n\n**Other important Info**\nWe have reserved our rail pass to be activated on may 3rd and it will last 7 days, which will cover shinkansen travel to and from the kyoto area, as well as covering all JR trips around the kyoto/osaka areas.

            "comment": "On May 1st, since you have a free schedule after going to Tokyo Skytree, which I would recommend getting tickets ahead of time, why not go around Asakusa since you're basically in the area. Go to Sensoji temple, there's also that popular Matcha Ice cream shop close by. You can also reserve a ticket for the water bus from Asakusa to Odaiba and then go see the 2 Gundams in the area. Teamlabs is also in Odaiba if you guys are interested in that too. But definitely buy tickets/ make reservations to stuff ahead of time since most do get sold out the day of. For all the other attractions that you know will be crowded that you will be going to, your best option would be getting there as early as possible to avoid the massive crowds.",

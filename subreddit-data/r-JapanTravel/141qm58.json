It was a mix of places that they wanted to visit and places I didn't get a chance to visit the past 2 trips I've been to Japan. However, I will go with the flow on the actual trip itself, removing places that are not at the top of our list :)",

If you wanted to do every single thing on that list you'd be looking at each place for 15 minutes before sprinting off to the next. I used wanderlog to plan my trip and it includes opening and closing times and tells you if something is closed (lots of stuff is closed Mondays). You're going to enjoy your vacation more if you spend more time at a few locations instead of spending almost no time at a ton of locations",

We had to see all of Osaka Castle in 30 min because we got there at 4:30 pm. \n\nHowever, some things are open late: i think the Inari Fox Shrine in Kyoto is actually open 24 hours, so he could get up really early to do it at the crack of dawn  or move it to the end of his \"East Kyoto\" day and do it at sunset.",

So kind of returning to Akihabara on two different days, so might not be the most optimal.\n\n Overall, what you have seems to make sense. Just be flexible and take this list as options and not must do. If you try to do everything at all cost, it might be exhausting.",

The reason for going here first is because I want to get my prefered goshuin cho first before visiting other shrines :)  I can see why it doesn't make sense at first glance hahah\n\nAnd I don't want my parent's first place in japan to be full of anime stuff that I know they wont be interested in, thus leaving Akihabara for a later date where I can explore myself. Thanks for the advice!",

Although the trains are very efficient, you still have to walk to the stations and climb stairs. Also there is a lot of standing in line. With a very light schedule, just 3 things in one day, I averaged 20,000 steps and 20 flights of stairs per day. I lost 8 lbs in 19 days. Slept like a baby every night.",

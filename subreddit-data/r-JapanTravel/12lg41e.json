            "comment": "Have you been to Japan before? My advice would be to limit the number of places you are staying, because any given town is going to have way more than can been seen/enjoyed in just a day or two. For example, if you are in Kyoto three nights, I wouldn\u2019t take the time to go to Nara (I thought Nara was cool, btw). In Tokyo, a train might show up every 3 minutes, but I took a trip out to Ohkunoshima and the train I needed as part of a multi-legged trip arrived once per hour. So in a situation like that a 3 hour trip can take much longer if you miss a train. I like to vacation at a pretty fast pace, but this plan looks very exhausting.",

There is a bus, but you're looking at a more like 5.5 hours for just for the bus not including transport from Hakone.  \n\nPresumably the fastest way from Hakone is taking the shinkansen from Odawara to Nagoya and changing there for Hida.  The train from Odawara comes approximate once every 2 hours.  You could technically go from Odawara to Shin-Yokohama to Nagoya, the latter via nozomi, but it will cost quite a bit.\n\nYou can do a lot more in 1 day in Kyoto than  Gion if you want.\n\nAnd I'm not going to repeat the problem with Hitachi as a day trip from Osaka.",

My second trip, I wish I had  spent a bit more time there, but I was also traveling with a kid so, that sort of changes everything.\n\nYou're only in Japan 11 days and this is presumably your first trip.  I would do either Hakone or Takayama not both.\n\nAnd yes, I have been to Hakone multiple times as well.",

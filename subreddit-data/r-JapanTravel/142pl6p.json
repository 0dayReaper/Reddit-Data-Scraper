            "comment": "My suggestion is to have a more specific point of interest to avoid disappointment. Shibuya is vast and there so many interesting things to see there such as Shibuya Sky, Magnet Shibuya, Shibuya Parco, myriad of food options.\n\nI think you're fine in nailing the major sights, but need to refine anything that you want to see.\n\nGinza shopping is nice but there are some flagship stores there such as UNIQLO, Muji, and very interesting architectute. \n\nI think you missed Shinjuku here. Lots of sights and interesting neighborhood to see. Omeide Yokocho, Golden Gai, Shinjuku Goen. \n\nTokyo Cheapo, Timeout, Live In Japan website, Youtube area guide, Reddit are your best bet to get next level of granularity.",

            "comment": "Tokyo Skytree is too tall so imo views arent great. How about Shibuya Sky instead? Also, maybe move Nikko to Day 4/5 so that if ever you feel jetlagged, you can just take it slow in a cafe or something.\n\nBecause you're going back to Tokyo at the end of the trip, I actually suggest the shopping districts (with the exception of Shibuya) to be placed at the end because you might get tempted to shop and would not want to lug around stuff. \n\nAlso, checking out the sites online and prioritizing which castle/historical district/temple you're interested in the most and diversifying the landscapes you visit (mountain, sea, forest, city) is important for a long trip in my opinion because they will all start to look alike at some point \ud83d\ude43",

            "comment": "Regarding Ginza and Shinjuku, if any of your days in Tokyo fall on a Sunday, I recommend using that day to visit either place. They close certain streets to traffic for certain hours (morning to afternoon, I can't remember the exact time but sure you could find it somewhere), and it makes for some nice pictures in the middle of the road, as well as just a generally less hectic time spent there.\n\n\\*I believe this is still occurring, though I'm not 100% sure, and recommend checking just in case if you do plan on it haha.",

When I went I hoped to go on the sightseeing train, but didn't go early enough. Decided not to bother when I saw how crowded it was going to be; it was like one of those clown cars... an impossible number of people came out of that tiny station single file.\n\nYou should also consider going straight from Tokyo to Kyoto instead of putting a single night in Osaka between the two.",

Any tips/tricks to doing Tokyo Disneysea? I suspect it's going to be packed.\n3. Is the Mori art museum interactive Disney exhibit even good or worth it?\n4. Nikko day trip will consist of only Edo Wonderland since we don't have time for the shrines unfortunately. Just to double check it would be feasible to do as a day trip?",

Say then you spend 3hr eating/stopping for lunch+dinner+break - a 15HR day (7AM-10PM) left you with actually 3-4 hours to explore the Park and Nagano.\n\nThe return ticket alone is $200+ per person with the Shinkansen.... \n\nGhibli Park is seen on many Youtube videos and I personally don't think its worth making a detour, let alone 8 hour detour... maybe Ghibli Museum or Harry Potter Studio ... or Puroland ..",

I've been to Japan 6 times and I think the best days were ones anchored around 2 major events or areas, leaving time for exploring, taking a break, and not feeling rushed. I also notice you've got two different cafes on the same day in Akiba, maybe change one of those to a different day or at least space them out so that you're not sitting in cafes for like 3 hours in the same day.\n\nI'd also say that some of these day trips may not be worth it. We did a day trip to Tobu World Square (2 hours either way) and it ate up the whole day and did not feel like a wise use of our time. It was cool, sure, but there's probably tons of cool stuff 10-15 minutes from wherever you're staying, too.",

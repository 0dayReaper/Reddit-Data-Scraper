    "postText": "Bird enthusiast here!\n\nI tried searching for Bird Parks on Google - Kakegawa Bird Park came up almost every time. however, that's 200km southwest of Tokyo, and as the title suggests, we hope to travel downwards from Sapporo to Tokyo over the course of 14 days, and that's a bit too far off course.\n\ni also know about Matsue Vogel Park and Kurume Bird Center, however, those are even more southwest of Tokyo.\n\nI'm hoping to not just be in a nature reserve and look at birds through binoculars - I'm hoping to get up really close. if Reddit knows any good recommendations, please let me know! thanks!\n\nedit: not just birds, but just anything worth a visit in the Sapporo - Tokyo region. right now we are still brainstorming (searching online) for places to visit so any suggestions are great!\n\nedit 2: we changed our minds, gonna take the 200km train trip to and from Tokyo just for this bird park! yay!",

When I visited Shinjuku Gyoen Garden in Tokyo (which is a lovely place to visit, although I can't speak to the variety of birds there), my niece and I went to the gift shop and really loved all the enamel pins they had of different Japanese bird species. This was in 2016, so who knows what it's like now, but if you're in the area, it's worth a visit!",

If you change your mind it\u2019s about 1hr30min via Shinkansen and you get to see Mt.Fuji on the way. Totally worth it for the birds and scenery.",

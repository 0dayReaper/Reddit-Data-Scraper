    "postText": "Wife (35F) and I (35M) arrived yesterday to Tokyo for our second trip to Japan and we\u2019re outbound from Yokosuka to Shinmoji to lay low in Kyushu (Kumamoto specifically) during Golden Week before we make our way back up towards Tokyo with plenty of stops on the way!\n\nCurrently have the back deck of the ship to myself as I write this. Have been a bit under the weather with laryngitis the last couple of weeks and a couple of long plane flights and unusual sleeping conditions have made sleep not particularly pleasant so I\u2019m hanging out awake while most people are asleep! Got some onigiri and some drinks to keep me company until the sun rises! Anyways\u2026\n\nWe decided to catch the Kyushu ferry from Toyko to have bit of a different experience rather than just using the trains! Saw someone on YouTube doing it and thought it looked like a good idea! Booked our cabins/fares a couple of months ago through the offical website, was a bit of pain as the translations to English weren\u2019t super clear and there were some hassles about area codes for phone numbers that we fixed by not putting any number at all!! Booking went through ok after that! We went with a couple of capsule style pods rather than a room for cost reasons more than anything! Ferry departs at 11:45pm in the evening from Yokosuka and gets to its destination in Shinmoji (near Fukuoka) around 9pm the next day, so almost 24hrs.\n\nFast forward to this evening! Made it the ferry port in Yokosuka this evening from Shibuya where we had spent the day hanging out. Used Suica passes and Google Maps to work out what trains to take and had no issues. Picked up some snacks from 7/11 on the way to the ferry terminal and checked in with no issues, the staff had enough English for us to understand the process and we waited for boarding upstairs with a few hundred others!\n\nNoticed very few foreigners apart from ourselves waiting and I don\u2019t know how often tourists use these ferries but we wanted to try it out! Boarding was smooth and we found our capsules easily. A decent amount of space and storage but a tad stuffy! Had an explore around the ship and then my wife and I decided to brave an entirely new experience\u2026 Japanese public bathing!!!\n\nOn our last trip we had a private onsen in Hakone and that was the extent of our bathing experience in Japan. \n\nThis ferry has no private bathing facilities or showers, just a men\u2019s and women\u2019s bathing facilities including traditional bathing stalls, hot pools, sauna and even an open air hot pool! For those unfamiliar, this type of bathing involves getting completely naked around a bunch of strangers in a locker room and proceed the wash and bath area to wash and clean yourself and soak in the tub with said strangers!!\n\nAs a couple of Aussies this was definitely a new and challenging experience! My wife did not like it at all and got out of there pretty quickly after a quick wash and dip in the bath! \n\nI chickened out after walking into the bathroom and confronting the full reality of what a \u201cpublic\u201d bath meant!! I\u2019m a nurse so seeing other people naked doesn\u2019t bother me at all, but me being the one naked, uhuh, not sure about that!!\n\nAnd then I did something I didn\u2019t think I would be capable of..\n\nI went back in and decided to embrace the experience and ended up really enjoying it!!! I had the open air bath to myself and felt really refreshed afterwards, especially with how crap I\u2019d been feeling due to illness!!\n\nNow I\u2019m on the back of ship with place to myself in blissful quietness after a day of hanging around Shibuya and waiting for the sun to properly rise on the start of a hooray that we\u2019ve really been looking forward to!!!\n\nAnyways, hope you like this rambling live trip report and happy to answer questions about the ferry!!",

Because of Golden Week?\n\nBTW, I visited Kagoshima a few years ago, and it was really enjoyable! Since it's only an hour from Kumamoto by Shinkansen, I highly recommend going there. The view of Sakurajima, the massive active volcano, from Senganen Garden or Shiroyama Park, was truly fascinating. You can reach Sakurajima by ferry, and I had a great time walking around there. Additionally, the steamy sand bath in Ibusuki was also unique, although it was a bit far from Kagoshima-chuo. If you end up going to Kagoshima, you should definitely try Kagoshima pork and Satsuma-age, which are delicious fried fish cakes. \n\nKurokawa Onsen is just fantastic. The town is thoughtfully designed with a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. Hope you have a great trip!",

Thanks for the recommendations! We\u2019ve got 5 days at an Airbnb in Kumamoto! We\u2019re spending tonight near the train station at Kokura and the catching our first Shinkansen down to Kumamoto tomorrow morning! Bought our Shinkansen tickets while hanging out in Tokyo yesterday at Harajuku station and reserved our seats as the trains were pretty full!\n\nWe\u2019ll be activating our 14 day JR passes once we get to Kumamoto and use those for the rest our travel. We\u2019re pretty loose on what we\u2019re doing while based on Kumamoto, especially as it\u2019s during Golden Week! We\u2019re planning day trips to Fukuoka or possibly Kagoshima or Nagasaki, not 100% sure yet! We\u2019re also hiring a car for a day and planning a bit of road trip out past Mt Aso, maybe to the onsens at Kurokawa and see Takachiho Gorge. Plus to resting and relaxing and exploring around Kumamoto! After that we\u2019re taking the Shinkansen back up towards Hiroshima and then doing a couple of days cycling the Shimanami Kaido!\n\nI believe the ferry tickets were 18,000 yen each for the Tourist A style cabin.",

Not sure about driving there. We were using public transport. So ensure you can get to where you want to go.\n\nWe went to Nagasaki. Nice town. The views from the mountain lookout are wonderful We could not make the evening viewing to see the city lights, but a day time visit was great.",

            "comment": "Your experience with the baths is actually something I've (29M) been thinking about for my solo trip that starts on May 12th. I will have multiple accommodations where I won't have a private bathroom, but I will definitely want to wash myself.\n\nLuckily, I have gone to a public nude spa before. Surprisingly, I got used to being naked around strangers in just 5 minutes! It becomes apparent that everyone is totally fine with it, so there is this sense of acceptance that is actually quite nice to experience. I am a bit worried it will feel different in a country that is totally unknown to me though. I don't want to unknowingly break some social rules. \nCone wat way, I'm very excited for my trip!\n\nThank you for your trip report!",

The bathing is not something that we even have anything similar to in Australia, with all our hang ups around nudity etc! \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of information online regarding the etiquette of using the baths which is helpful!\n\nAs others have said, the main thing is to get naked, use the washing/shower facilities (with the little stools that you sit on) to rinse and wash yourself thoroughly before enjoying a soak! I\u2019m looking forward to trying it some more with a proper onsen! Definitely a more refreshing way of getting clean than just having a quick shower like I\u2019m used to at home!",

            "comment": "Sorry for the late update, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had good phone reception on the ship! The further south we got and further away from land the spottier the connection got, including the on board Wifi which only sporadically had enough signal strength Int self to work!\n\nSo I ended up staying up till about 5:45am, had pretty much the whole deck to myself for a couple hours with a few early morning risers who also came to see the sunrise. It was pretty overcast and a bit rainy so there wasn\u2019t much of a sunrise but it was nice all the same!\n\nTurned in and had a few hours sleep in my pod until my wife woke me to see how I was doing. We decided to skip breakfast and get a few more hours sleep instead! The pod (Traveller A style) was actually pretty comfortable and the temperature had settled and wasn\u2019t too warm! I was able to get a few hours of solid sleep, the only interruptions being fairly frequent messages over the PA system! My Japanese isn\u2019t the best but I\u2019m pretty sure it was to do with the opening and closing of the restaurant and cafes for the different meal times!\n\nWe\u2019re staying in an 8 bed mixed gender cabin (though it\u2019s pretty much all guys apart from my wife) and my wife has been surprised how quiet it is in such a small room! Everyone is super polite and quiet within the room and you would barely know other people were in there once you were in your pod! Each pod had a decent amount of storage space, had its own bedding that you need to makeup yourself, plus a light with a power point for your charger. Pretty basic but clean and comfortable!\n\nI doubled down after a couple more hours sleep with a return to the bathhouse for another wash and soak! Feeling much more confident this time with the process I enjoyed the use of the bathhouse facilities!! Still a little in shock at how I was able to adapt to this utterly foreign way of bathing but looking forward to experiencing some onsens in Kyushu in the coming days!\n\nAfter a freshen up we both decided to go to the main restaurant for lunch. I believe the ship has three different food facilities, a an upmarket restaurant, which we didn\u2019t check out, a small cafe kiosk which was open at certain times and the main restaurant which we went to!\n\nEach table had its one tablet to do your order on! The staff were very polite and efficient with our orders coming out almost as soon as we submitted the order to the kitchen! We both had the Yokosuka Naval Curry rice meal which was delicious! We couldn\u2019t find an English option for the menu screen but between my wife being able to read a fair bit of Hirigana and Katakana plus the pictures on the tablet we were able to quickly work it out and order our meal! At the end of the meal you submit the final receipt on the tablet and take a little barcode card from your table and take it to the exit of the restaurant where there are a couple of self service payment tills to check out. My card (Mastercard) was having difficulty paying which I think I saw mentioned somewhere that sometimes the internet reception can cause difficulty with the payment machines. My wife went off to get more cash from our room but it turned out that my card went through and I just had to wait for staff member to come down to print off a receipt for me to sign! Given there was no signage in English on how to do this process we were relieved we managed to do very thing successfully with minimal faux pas\u2019s! Plenty of pictorial instructions around which helped us to get the jist of things! Just something to be aware of I guess!\n\nAfter lunch I went back for another few hours of sleep (exciting I know!) and we\u2019ll probably head back to the restaurant for dinner soon!",

It was more about how she felt in her own body in that setting as opposed to how she felt she was viewed/treated by others in the baths! She says that it\u2019s more how comfortable the individual feels in themselves in such a setting! I don\u2019t think in any way that she was made to feel uncomfortable by the other users of the baths!",

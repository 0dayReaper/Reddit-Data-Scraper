    "postText": "Route info: Osaka &gt; Kyoto &gt; Hiroshima &gt; Kumamoto &gt; Fukuoka &gt; Mt. Fuji/Lake Yamanakako &gt; Tokyo\n\nTraveler info: Adults who enjoy leisurely travel. We also like anime, video games, history, and nature (leisurely strolls near the forests, lakes, and beaches). We LOVE trying new foods: I have some spots I want to try but we'll probably stop in small cafes or street vendors as we're walking around.\n\nGetting around info: We'll basically be travelling in a loop back to Tokyo with the JR Pass &amp; SUICA card. We plan to have carry-on luggage &amp; backpacks only, and a few of our accommodations will have at least a washer. We'll bring a small duffle each in case we want to check in an additional piece of luggage for souvenirs on the return.\n\nTechnology info: We'll be getting the UBIGI eSIM (both android and apple), plus we will have our US carrier's travel plan as a backup.\n\nCurrency info: We couldn't find any local banks to exchange here in the states, but Navy FCU said we'd have to go thru a screening process to visit the bases overseas. We'll revisit this latter option, b/c I'm not sure if that's even worth it. Anyway, we'll try the withdrawal from 7Eleven or FamilyMart as recommended in the FAQs.\n\nHere's my update itinerary based on a previous suggestion.\n\nDay 1: Osaka/Kyoto\n\n* Meet partner super early\n* P/u JR pass at Kyoto stations\n* Drop off luggage at the hotel in Kyoto (near Gion Shijo Station)\n* Bamboo forest\n\nDay 2:  Kyoto\n\n* River of Sukura tour\n* Nishiki market\n\nDay 3: Depart Kyoto &gt; Hiroshima &gt; Kumamoto\n\n* Kyoto Station to Hiroshima Station - 1.5 hrs\n   * **Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen**\n* Hiroshima - 2hrs\n   * Peace memorial park\n* Hiroshima Station to Hakata Station\n* Dropoff luggage at hotel\n* Bus to Monkey D.

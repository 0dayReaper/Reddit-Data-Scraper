    "postText": "April 9 - April 26: Tokyo - Nanyo - Hakone - Kyoto - Osaka - Koyasan\n\nWe had two main goals for this trip to Japan: eat great food and see cherry blossoms. We had the best of both in the city of Nanyo in Yamagata prefecture. It's not a place that I've ever seen mentioned on Reddit or the western internet, so I wanted to share it with you all here.\n\n# What we learned\n\n* **Ship your luggage** \\- The airport as well as every convenience store we walked into let us ship our luggage. This made traveling between cities significantly easier, and prices were always very reasonable. For single-night stays, we just packed what we needed for a single day and shipped our suitcases to the subsequent hotel.\n* Google Maps is very helpful, but don't trust them for transfer times in public transit. We thought we were transit experts because we live in NYC, but the stations in Japan are even more complicated. Leave early if you need to catch a train.\n* Almost all restaurants in Japan are good, but I'm somewhat of food snob. If you're like me, I recommend using **Tabelog** for reviews to find places that are a bit more special. The scoring is very different from western reviews. In general, anything above a 3.3 is very good. Scores are also significantly biased towards more expensive restaurants, so I'd recommend higher scores for fancier restaurants.\n* Fruits and vegetables are relatively expensive and difficult to come by in Japan. We were able to get them at supermarkets, which can usually be found in the basement of any department store. Next time I'm in Japan, I'll consider bringing fiber supplements.\n* **Cherry Blossoms** blooming times are very unpredictable. The Japan Meteorology Agency has a [website](https://s.n-kishou.co.jp/w/sp/sakura/sakura_top.html) with up to date cherry blossom predictions of over 1000 locations. Even if it doesn't have the exact cherry blossom site you want to visit, you're definitely going to see something close by. Websites of popular tourist destinations update the status of cherry blossoms as well.\n* I recommend that you book hotels within 5 minutes walking distance from well-connected subway stations. A couple of our hotels were 10-15 minutes away from the station we needed to go to, so it was mildly irritating to repeat the same walk so often. In those places, there was actually a closer station, but if we took those, we'd have to transfer to a main station anyways.\n* Standard hotel rooms have a double bed, which are about the same size as full sized beds in the US. If you're a move around a lot in your sleep like I do and want your partner to be well-rested, it's worth upgrading to a room that has a larger bed or two twins.\n* If you're shopping, don't forget to bring your passport, so that you can get a **duty free** discount or refund.\n\n# Planning\n\n* We booked our Hakone ryokan in January\n* In February, we booked 3 fine dining restaurants, hotel in Kyoto, and temple lodging in Koyasan\n* **Saiho-ji** (the moss temple in Kyoto) says that they require you to write an international postcard to request a reservation, and I saw that too late. Fortunately, there was also a Japanese website that let you make reservations, and we filled that out about a month in advanced with the help of Google translate. One of the fields required a Japanese address. We just used a friend's address, but you can probably use a hotel as well.\n* Besides that, we booked all our other lodging and a week before our stay or less. A few times this wasn't best decision because our hotels were significantly more expensive this way.\n* We left the first week in our trip very flexible, so that we could go *somewhere* that was in peak bloom during this time. We had a few places in mind, and ended up booking a ryokan in Nanyo the night before our stay there.\n* Besides a few bucket list items, we figured that we'd be happy going anywhere. My wife and I made a shared Google map with all the sites that we found interesting without the intention of going to all of them and used that as a guide to choose what was convenient.\n\n# Tokyo Highlights\n\n* I bought strawberries from a random department store, and an absurdly priced mango and orange from the **Sembikiya** flagship store. The strawberries were some of the best I had and worth the price of 1200 yen. The orange was tangier than any other orange we've had. However, you have to peel the thick membrane to fully appreciate it, and even then, I don't think it was worth anywhere close to 3500 yen. The mango was the most expensive at about 12000 yen, and everything about it was perfect. It was fragrant, the skin was thin, the texture was creamy, and it was as sweet as candy. It's hard to believe that this was grown from a plant.\n* The real reason to go to **Mori Art Museum** is the stunning view of Tokyo. The main museum was closed, but we got to see an exhibit of Heatherwick Studio instead, which was more interesting than I expected.\n* We loved the garden the **Nezu Museum**\n* We went to **Hotel Sara Kinshicho**, a love hotel, and it was as fun as it looks on Youtube. The room was both more spacious and cheaper than most of our other hotel rooms. That said, it's a bit out of the way, so you should definitely ship your luggage to your next destination.\n* We wanted to go to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant and settled on Kura Sushi. Considering that you're paying $1-$3 per plate, you shouldn't expect the highest quality of fish, but the eel was absolutely incredible. It seemed to be fresh off the grill and it was so saucy and fatty. I honestly enjoyed it more than the eel that I got from a dedicated unagi restaurant.\n* The yakitori at **New Torigin** was amazing, especially the chicken skin. Perfectly charred and crispy.\n\n# Nanyo\n\nAs I mentioned before, Nanyo was the highlight of our trip. Despite being a small town, it had it's own distinct feeling and cuisine, and I think it deserves more love. I definitely shouldn't have been able to book a last minute ryokan reservation during peak Cherry Blossom season.\n\n* After arriving in Nanyo, we ate some dessert near the station nearby. We then took a train known as the Flower Nagai Line. On the train, you can see cherry blossoms, snowcapped mountains, and pass sleepy villages. We stopped at Koguwa Station.\n* There is a famous soba restaurant close by. It was a 30 minute walk, but I was really in the mood for some soba. Unfortunately, we arrived, we found out that the shop is temporarily closed because the owner broke his arms. It was around this time when I think I spotted an eagle catching a snake.\n* Fortunately, we still had some sweets leftover and the weather was perfect for walking. We walked to a spot which has a small cherry blossom festival. One of the trees there was over 1200 years old, yet it was still blooming strong!\n* We took the Flower line back to Nanyo and checked into our ryokan, **Morinoyu**. We didn't see any English speakers in their staff, so my wife's basic Japanese was definitely helpful. Service was excellent, despite our communication barrier.\n* For dinner, we went to **\u98df\u697d\u4ead \u65ed\u5c4b**, which specializes in beef. Despite going to several more expensive restaurants, this was by far my favorite meal in Japan and one of the top two meals of my life. We had their [specialty Shabu Shabu](https://imgur.com/a/FEihklr) with their local Yonezawa beef. I don't think it was graded A5, but I honestly don't think that mattered as it still had wonderful marbling and melted in your mouth. To eat it, you take a thin slice of beef and wrap it around a bunch of spring vegetables. The mild freshness and crispness of the vegetables perfectly compliments the fatty beef. It's kind of like eating a Korean ssam but in reverse, which is so much better because you primarily taste the beef instead of the vegetable.\n* After dinner, we walked around **Eboshiyama Park**, nearby. It's a hill with hundreds of cherry trees in full blossom. It also features the largest torii made out of a single stone.  It was after dark, but they light it up at night which gives the park its own sort of beauty.\n* We went back to our ryokan and soaked in the public onsens. The water had a slight sulphurous smell though I think that actually enhances the authenticity of the spring water.\n* The following day, we went back to Eboshiyama Park. During the daytime, the park was even more beautiful. It felt like I was walking in Shinkai film. The best part is that there were the perfect number of people. Sometimes, you feel like you have to the park to yourself, but there are still enough to make the atmosphere more lively.\n\n# Hakone\n\n* We went up the **Hakone Ropeway**. Fortunately the sky was clear and we got to see Mt. Fuji on Owakudani. We didn't have time to complete the entire loop, so we turned back from there. If you're in a hurry like us, I definitely recommend taking the bus instead of the train and cable car, which were painfully slow. We barely made it to our ryokan before their last check in time.\n* Our ryokan we stayed in was **Yama No Chaya**. Despite being highly recommended on this sub, I personally would not recommend it. Don't get me wrong. We had fun, and it met 90% of our expectations, but it's fair to expect that extra 10% after spending almost $700. Our meals were rushed, especially breakfast. Our attendant kept on reminding us that check out was at 10:00 am despite having plenty of time. I think they were short-staffed because he always had the expression of being overwhelmed. One of the public onsens had a thin layer of oil in it, which likely came from a guest who didn't shower themselves properly. Our private onsen was beautiful, but they locked the door to the outside because there was construction underneath.\n* The Open Air Museum featured a lot of interesting sculptures, and we took the bus there this time.\n\n# Kyoto Highlights\n\n* **Fushimi Inari** is as lovely as it appears on social media. We arrived at 9 am, which we thought was late, but there were fewer people than I expected, especially in the upper area.\n* **Roketsu** is a fun studio where you can make your own indigo textiles. It is much easier than it looks to make something beautiful.\n* **Saiho-ji** is a Japanese Buddhist temple that features a large garden covered in 120 types of moss. Due the limited reservations, our visit was quite peaceful.\n* My favorite overall dinner in Kyoto was **Soba-no-Mi Yoshimura**. They have an English menu, but their Japanese menu has a lot more options, such as the 100% buckwheat soba that I ordered. My wife got the traditional nishin (herring) soba, which was also delicious. The best part was honestly the tempura.\n* We had a couple of traditional Kyoto-style kaisekis, and both were excellent. **Iharada** was a great overall value and service was impeccable. **Kiyama** was more of a splurge, but also worth the price. Every other tasting menu I've experienced has aimed to present dishes with a wow factor, but each course here elegantly embodied delicacy.\n\n# Osaka Highlights\n\n* I've never seen dolphins so active than the ones at the **Osaka Aquarium**.\n* **Hajime** is a 3 Michelin star restaurant where I had the most exquisite meal I've ever had in my life. Every course was a work of art. I posted a [full review](https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/13wedy8/hajime_april_2023/) on /r/finedining.\n* We had Okonomiyaki and yakisoba at **Ajikuraya**. It was a tiny fraction of the price of our previous dinner, but equally as memorable.\n\n# Koyasan\n\n* Our last stop was Koyasan, a mountain with a Buddhist temple settlement. Honestly, at this point, we were all templed-out, but it still offered a distinct experience from the other ones we've visited.\n* We stayed at Ichijo-In, which is a functioning temple and lodging of pilgrims. We aren't religious, but almost all of the other guests seemed to be quite serious. The walls of the temple are quite thin, and it got quite chilly in April, so I'd be cautious if you want to book this in the winter.",

For example, most salads at restaurants tend to be kind of small and sad (with the exception of our favorite restaurant in Nanyo).\n\nAs I mentioned, we did go to supermarkets but that's inherently going to be somewhat out of the way as a tourist. Also, it's not like you're just going chomp down on a raw daikon. We'd usually get apples, bananas, or salad mixes (which again were fairly small).\n\nNext time in Japan, I'll probably opt for a road trip, so I'll definitely check out some michi-no-eki.

I guess the politeness of Japanese people won't translate in these subreddits, as I've seen people being shamed for the most ridiculous complaints or comments and since I'm not the only one noticing (there are 4 years or longer posts with these conplaints), I'm guessing this is a \"holier than thou\" attitude that will never be fixed.",

And closer to the producers you can for reasonable (though not cheap) prices often find fruit of incredible quality.",

But when you're used to getting decent fruit by the bag for a few dollars, seeing individual apples sold for hundreds of yen, even if it's only two or three hundred yen, is pretty surprising. Even seeing them priced individually is odd.\n\nYou're right that a Tokyo department store isn't going to be the cheapest place to buy fruit, though it does represent where a lot of people get their fruit.",

Do you need to inform your next hotel to expect your luggage?\n3. When initiating the shipping, you just walk in to any convenience shop with this service?\n4. Do only certain hotels accept luggage delivery? I.e. is there a risk of the hotel rejecting the delivery and the luggage goes missing lol.\n\nTIA!",

I just checked a receipt we got and it was.\n\nWe never informed the next hotel. At our first hotel, the front desk told us that they can ship our luggage, but for this service the receiver pays the fee, and in that case the hotel may reject it. That's why he recommended us just to go to the 7-11 next door.\n\nI had a 100% success rate with convenience stores, but I'm not sure. Your front desk will definitely know.\n\nSo long as your name matches with a reservation, I can't think of a reason why they'd rejected your luggage. Every time, I'd seem a lot of other shipped luggage next to mine, so it seems like something that's expected for them to handle, at least for 3-star hotels.",

            "comment": "&gt; Almost all restaurants in Japan are good, but I'm somewhat of food snob. If you're like me, I recommend using Tabelog for reviews to find places that are a bit more special. The scoring is very different from western reviews. In general, anything above a 3.3 is very good. Scores are also significantly biased towards more expensive restaurants, so I'd recommend higher scores for fancier restaurants.\n\nIt's okay to admit that not all restaurants in Japan are worth your time even if the food quality is higher on average than it is in America. \n\nI'm curious where you saw that 3.3 is very good since most sites say that 3.5 is very good, 4 is excellent, and 4.5 is legendary.\nhttps://www.eater.com/2017/2/21/14686118/tokyo-tabelog-restaurant-ratings\n\nThat said, the ratings don't actually matter. What matters is what you like but as a prospective tourist, it can be hard to figure out who to trust. That said, I am still skeptical of places that are &lt; 3.5. It's interesting to compare TripAdvisor rankings to Tabelog rankings to see what tourists prefer vs locals. Additionally, just because a place has a high Tabelog ranking doesn't mean you will enjoy it. \n\nI thought this was an interesting article on how Tabelog reviews can fall short due to the inherent biases of the platform: https://www.ramenguidejapan.com/editorials/2018/11/3/the-ranking-system-of-tabelog",

I found the good \"regular\" restaurants (e.g. salaryman ramen) are very unlikely to get a 3.5, but you still benefit from choosing a score that's slightly better than average. On the other hand, a ramen rated 3.5 will incorporate a unique element in their broth because that's something that you'd want if you've eat ramen your whole life. However, as a tourist, everything is going to be different, and taste being equal, I'd rather go for something more \"regular.\"",

The transfer time google maps gives you is based on walking straight to the next platform and doesn't factor crowds or the difficulty of finding where you want to go in the maze that is Shinjuku station.\n\nAlso, missing you first train can have a knock on effect since you'll miss every other connection too.

    "postText": "Hello friends, I've just returned from a trip to Japan, made much better than it would have been by all the wonderful advice from fellow redditors. I'd like to pay it forward by writing my own trip report, but for now, here are some general tips that didn't really fit into specific days in my trip diary.  These may be more applicable to people traveling to Japan for the first time, as it was my first trip.\n\n**Travel/Public Transport:**\n\nIf you're flying into Narita after 3pm (or any airport, really) and are planning on traveling to another area, just stay the night near the airport and travel the next day.  We landed around 4pm and went straight to Kyoto, and we were dead tired by the time we got to Kyoto at 9pm. It did save us more time, but it really wasn't worth it to try and figure out public transport while dealing with jetlag and exhaustion related with a long flight.  \n\nIt also was a pain in the ass, for some reason, to get to Narita Airport from Tokyo Bay using public transport. I'm not sure why, but we ended up transferring like 4 times and the money saved wasn't really worth it.  Next time, we'll just take the airport limo bus.\n\nWhen riding on the train/subways, sometimes one line turns into another, if that makes sense? like subway line A becomes the B line. if Google Maps says \"stay on board,\" take it with a grain of salt. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.  Try to figure out which stops the train runs to, and see if all of them match up to what Google Maps says.\n\nHowever long Google Maps says it takes to get somewhere, multiply that by like 1.5-2. You don't know the area well, and that's okay! It'll be fun to explore are discover the little things along the way. Just keep that in mind if you have timed reservations anywhere.\n\nGet the suica/ic card! It made everything way more convenient when paying for items, especially when there's a long line. I didn't realize, but the ticket machines actually show your remaining balance when you tap you way through, which is nice\n\n**Language/Culture:**\n\nGoogle Lens is the best, as everyone else says. It was so nice to be able to hold up my phone to a menu to see what it says rather than just struggle.\n\n3 words: Sumimasen. Daijoubu. Arigato. You should probably know these three at a minimum before you go.  I know a few other phrases, but these were so applicable to nearly every situation. \n\nSomeone said Google Translate is better for Japanese to English translations, and DeepL is better for English to Japanese. I'm not sure if that's true, but it was easier to have two apps so I didn't have to switch the language back and forth. Also, I highly recommend downloading Japanese on Google Translate, it'll still work even if you don't have internet access.\n\nThis is small, but I brought some small American candies to gift to people who were exceptionally helpful or kind.  Tips aren't accepted, and non-edible items are dust bunnies, but everyone likes to try snacks from around the world. So I tossed 12-15 individually-wrapped fun-sized candies and packets of jelly beans into my suitcase to give away. They were accepted and much appreciated.\n\nBring a washcloth to dry your hands after using the restroom, as paper towels are not provided, and try to store it in an outside pouch of your bag or an otherwise easily accessible place. \n\n**Misc:**\n\nWe were previously undecided on going to Tokyo Disneyland, as we live close enough to American Disneyland in California.  However, being moderate Disney fans, and seeing how cheap the prices were compared to the awful gouging American prices, we opted to go to both Tokyo Disney Resorts. For some reason, the online Tokyo Disney Resort website decided it didn't like the mastercard we had gotten specifically to buy Disney tickets even though it had worked for purchasing Disney Sea tickets a month prior, so we ended up having to use Klook. Anyways, Just a PSA. Try to get the tickets sorted out before you go.\n\nBring some medication from home. This is kinda gross, but it took me 2 days to adjust to the food, and I absolutely shit my brains out the first night. Sure, I bet conbini sells some weird ass weak Japanese pepto, but who wants to run out into the streets at night and try to translate shit to some guy at 3am while battling stomach pain and the shits? not me! \n\nDepartments stores are very reliable for good food! They're usually close to big stations and were great to visit in a pinch when we wanted to get food on the way back to our accommodations. \n\nDon't bring a hairdryer, all our accommodations had one. Hostels may be different, idk\n\nEven very old inns and hotels are very clean.\n\nTo save on luggage space, I only packed 2 sets of clothes in addition to what I wore on the plane. Many hotels/inns have coin laundry, or it's just down the street. Worst comes to worst, the bathroom sink/bathtub. I would normally do my laundry in the evening. Get back from sightseeing, toss a load of laundry in, shower, and then grab the laundry and throw it in the drier. Eat dessert, brush my teeth, plan out the next day, and the clothes are dry before bedtime. If they aren't, they can dry in the room overnight+the next day, or I can throw them in the drier before getting breakfast at conbini. \n\nThis seems obvious, but try to group your activities by location. It's easier to travel in one direction then to run around all over the place.\n\nDon't be gross, wear a fucking mask.",

No one challenged that and immediately quickly dig through the bags to put on masks. \nThis village has a mixed of both locals and foreigners. \nAfter that we went to 2 ryokans that has about 30% foreigners from different countries and no issues with mask wearing. \nNow on the way back to Tokyo as I write this.

(They wanted me to book the second segment at the next station.  My entire argument was that I had only 10 minutes to make a connection in Shinagawa, which, when I got there, I realized would\u2019ve been plenty of time to make a reservation.)\n\nIt would\u2019ve been even easier if I hadn\u2019t needed to exchange a jr pass, which is why I\u2019m a fan of not exchanging at the airport office if I can help it.  The only major hiccup was I ended up at the wrong hotel- I thought they had two branches near the Shin-Osaka station, but it turns out there was 3.  I speak enough Japanese that, between the staff and I, we figured out the problem really fast- and the one I booked at turned out to be the closest to the station, so that was an extra win.",

The only thing is the inflight wifi is sooooo slow, and I saw some people getting chastised for switching seats, even if their row was full and the one they switched to was empty, so I guess they punish you for not paying extra for the reserved seat lol",

They don't make you take off your shoes and you can walk through security with liquids and water bottles. When you land, your luggage comes out at about the time you reach the carousel. \n\nYou're arriving to the station at least 20 mins early to navigate through the station to the track/platform.

Considering that the ticket was about $55 usd for me with the exchange rate I had, and ears are only $13 usd, I figured why the hell not.\n\nI went in January when many rides were closed for refurbishment, so both parks were probably doable in one day if we really rushed, due to many of the attractions at Disney sea being closed. However, if your trip is 2 weeks or longer, I'd just do them on seperate days. It's nice being able to walk around leisurely and go back for the things you like. For instance, we had the little green alien mochi twice and rode Sinbad's fairytale journey twice at Disney Sea, and went on both Beauty and the Beast and Pinocchio twice AND saw a show at Disneyland, and we wouldn't have been able to go back for these things if we did both in one day. If you do, try to do Disney Sea first and the Disneyland, and Disneyland stays open later than Sea.",

I collected most of the prefectures of Japan, a few US states, and a bunch of countries in Europe as well.  (I took the DS to other places- I picked up several prefectures from my local shopping mall- but theme parks generally had a better yield than the time I took it to Akihabara.  The only place that I had similar yields was at a major video game convention- which was sadly with a different DS.)",

            "comment": "&gt;When riding on the train/subways, sometimes one line turns into another, if that makes sense? like subway line A becomes the B line. if Google Maps says \"stay on board,\" take it with a grain of salt. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong. Try to figure out which stops the train runs to, and see if all of them match up to what Google Maps says.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that the train signs will say, \"Bound for...\" The station it mentions is the last stop. For example, I live in Ibaraki, so I will usually take the Joban Line in and out of Tokyo. Going back to Ibaraki on the Joban, trains might say, \"Bound for Abiko\", which means the last stop is Abiko Station (meaning, it won't go as far as I need to). Occasionally, it will say, \"Bound for Narita\", which means it will turn into the Narita Line after Abiko, which means I definitely don't want to be on that train lol.\n\n&gt;This is small, but I brought some small American candies to gift to people who were exceptionally helpful or kind. Tips aren't accepted, and non-edible items are dust bunnies, but everyone likes to try snacks from around the world.\n\nI've done this, too! Individually-wrapped maple candies from Canada are always well-received. When traveling as a tourist, I usually gave them out to people who were extra helpful or friendly (i.e. helping me with directions).\n\nNote that this is NOT required. You don't have to go out of your way to buy snacks/candies or use up the space in your luggage for these things. Also, if you DO want to try this, make sure the candies you are giving away are individually wrapped.",

For longer, multi-hour trips, I would add an extra hour just to be safe, and make sure I don't have anything scheduled within an hour of arriving, like any dinners or attraction reservations. That way, you won't feel too pressed if you want to stop along the way either.",

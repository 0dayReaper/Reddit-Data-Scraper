    "postText": "**This discussion thread has been set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel. Please stay civil, abide by the rules, and be helpful. Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements and COVID Requirements\n\n* Japan has resumed visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* **If you are arriving in Japan on or before May 7, 2023,** you will need to have three doses of an [approved vaccine](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_vaccine.html) or submit [a negative COVID-19 test result](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_test.html) ahead of your departure to Japan. For the vaccine doses, there are no timing requirements as long as you have three doses of an approved vaccine (see [top of page 10 here](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/001002920.pdf)).\n* **If you are arriving in Japan on or after May 8, 2023,** you will not be required to present a vaccine certificate or negative PCR test ([official MHLW source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)).\n* Tourists entering Japan should get their COVID document checking process, Immigration process, and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration, a QR code for Customs, and a blue \"Review completed\" screen for COVID fast track (no QR code) once approved. (See below for more info.)\n* Travelers connecting through Japanese airports and staying airside for their connection do not need to complete any visa, entry, or COVID procedures.\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Visit Japan Web Info and FAQs\n\n[Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/) (VJW) is an online document-checking system introduced in December 2022. It allows you to pre-enter all of your Immigration, Customs, and COVID vaccine/test information before arriving in Japan. To make the entry process as smooth as possible and prevent any issues, we recommend filling it out and obtaining the QR codes provided by the service.\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions regarding filling out the VJW sections:\n\n**Can I put multiple family members under the same Visit Japan Web account?**\n\n&gt; All adults should have their own VJW account. Family members on the same account should only be either minors or dependents incapable of filling it out on their own.\n\n**How far in advance can I fill out Visit Japan Web?**\n\n&gt; Officially speaking, you can use Visit Japan Web for trips up until the end of the year following the current year. For instance, in February 2023, you can register a trip with a date up to December 2024. That said, your information will be wiped if you don't sign into Visit Japan Web at least once every 18 months.\n\n&gt; Practically speaking, there's no real need to register more than a few months or weeks in advance, as the information gets reviewed and approved within hours or days.\n\n**What flight number do I use?**\n\n&gt; You should use the flight number for the flight _landing in Japan_. So, for instance, if you have a flight from New York City to Seattle and then from Seattle to Tokyo, you use the flight number of the Seattle to Tokyo Flight. If you are on a codeshare flight, you can use either the carrier you purchased through, or the operating carrier. For instance, if you are on American Airlines #4065 and it codeshares with JAL #001, you can write either \"AA 4065\" or \"JAL 001\".\n\n**What do I put down for my intended address? What do I do if I'm staying in multiple hotels or accommodations over the course of my trip?**\n\n&gt; You should use the address and contact information for your first hotel/hostel/Airbnb/etc. You don't need to provide multiple addresses.\n\n**On the quarantine procedures page, it has a \"Time remaining to complete registration: XXXXXX\" notification, but I've already submitted my vaccine certificate and my screen is blue. What do I do?**\n\n&gt; You don't have to do anything. This timer is for submitting a test for approval, which you don't need to do if you submitted vaccine information. Basically, it's bad design/programming.\n\n**Will I still get a \"temporary visitor\" stamp in my passport if I use VJW? I need it for the JR Pass and tax-free shopping!**\n\n&gt; Yes, you will still get a temporary visitor stamp in your passport. Tourists who fill out VJW still see an immigration officer at a manned immigration station and receive their stamp.\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

Prices get more expensive for lodging during this peak season.  \n\nYou could look into hostels or inexpensive business hotels if you want a private bathroom.  You\u2019ll also need to consider staying in less convenient locations.   For example, it\u2019s cheaper to stay in Osaka often than Kyoto but then you\u2019ll lose time and dime cost traveling from Osaka to Kyoto each day. If you want to stay along thr [Yamanote Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line) in Tokyo you\u2019ll need to look at the stations not in the bold black rectangles.  You could also look into spots line Asakusa that are on a subway line but not a JR line. You\u2019ll also likely need to plan for a longer walk to get to the station, ~20 minutes from your lodging. \n\nYour budget is very low for lodging; do what you can to increase it.  You\u2019re gonna likely be looking at hostels if you want to stay within that range.  Start looking 6 months out and try to have things booked 3 months out at the latest.  Book refundable lodging so if you find a better location/price later you can easily change.  \n\n- Use a site like Booking to search and the filter for your max budget.  Or filter for hostels or specific budget hotel chains. \n- [6 Cheap Hotel Chains in Japan](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0001458/)",

If I included the discounted accommodation from using the credit card points accumulated from the trip (from purchasing travel, other bookings, pre-paying for attractions, etc) to get 3 nights steeply discounted it ended up being 6,900 Yen per night for two people.  Or 3,450 Yen per night per person.  To me that was remarkably inexpensive for accommodation.  \n\nWe stayed in a variety of hotels and ryokans ranging from pretty much a fancy capsule / hostel type hotel (The Pocket Hotel) to a lovely Ryokan in Nagano (highlight of our stay.)  In between we stayed at an AirBnB, and 3 star hotels (business hotels.)\n\nIf you look, there should be plenty of options.  We really wanted to experience a lot of different places so that was part of our criteria when booking.",

They have Sanrio, Ghibli and other character shops the kids might enjoy. \nDay 3 - USJ \nDay 4 - pass by Nara (am) teen go to Kyoto (pm)\nDay 5 - Doable if you don't shop and pass through all the shopping areas. 7 AM climb Fushimi. Take the JR outside the shrine and go straight to Arashiyama up to fees of the macaques (opens at 9 AM). You either shop and eat down the arashiyama shopping street OR go back to your hotel (pick one close to Gion area) so you can go there at night. Or spend another day for all the shrines at Gion area: Kiyomizu, smaller ones around the Sanen/Ninenzaka streets, Yasaka shrine at night. There's a gild shrine at the north closer to Arashiyama and the shrine with hundreds of statues.",

You can pre-book online. The cheapest set was $30 for the whole look. I'm not sure about kids' pricing though. You can choose the set during reservation but they won't charge until you get there.\n\nWe actually ran late, didn't leave Osaka early enough to make it, and the site said you have to  cancel at 1 pm the day before. But there's a fine print which says you can call them the day of! We just called them and moved our reservation, which we still missed by 20 min because we ended up going to 2 other Okamoto locations (Higashiyama and Main shop) but they were chill about it. I think the reservation just made sure they don't exceed the daily quota.",

I do not plan on having checked bags, and I'm sitting near front of the plane landing in Tokyo so I should be one of the first few people off the plane. US passport if that matters. This will be for a Sunday in June. Thanks!",

It really will come down to the speed of clearing passport control/VJW app checks, and that's impossible to predict at this stage. I don't think it's impossible, but I personally wouldn't risk it.",

Apparently they also require it to pick them up from ticket office.\n\nYou can search by train number on smartex, so you can find the train number of the one you want on JR west (it will be something like \u201cnozomi 300\u201d or \u201chikari 15) and try searching for it",

I'm travelling in three weeks so just delved into this quite a bit, so just to help you reflect:\n\n May is simply dryer, sunnier, less humid, and a bit cooler. Just more pleasant. And apparently the rain season (starting ~6 June) is somewhat sudden, so not as gradual as entering spring from winter as in another country.\n\nThat being said, rain season is not terrible. It rains only every other day. It's not monsoon downpours. Predictions are pretty good so you can alter your plans the night before/in the morning. \n\nSo you'll be fine in both. But yeah, definitely a big plus for the weather if you go end may to beginning of June.",

It\u2019s near Sensoji so very busy during the day but a more chill vibe at night and there\u2019s Hoppy Street.  \n\n- [20 Things to Do in Asakusa](https://matcha-jp.com/en/5112)\n\nAnother neighborhood I like staying in is Akasaka.  (Different from Asakusa). Near 3 metro stations, lots of great restaurants and bars, and a nightlife vibe without the overwhelming nature of Shinjuku.  Lots of hotels in this area too at a range of price points.  I really think it\u2019s a hidden gem of a neighborhood to stay in Tokyo. \n\n- [Hie Shrine](https://maps.google.com?g_st=ic)\n- [Thousand Toriis at Hie (great photos at night)](https://maps.google.com?g_st=ic)\n- [Toyokawa Inari Betsuin (great at night too)](https://maps.google.com?g_st=ic)\n- [State Guesthouse Akasaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yTMMP3woyRDdgqZ6?g_st=ic)\n- [Dobrogi Hungarian Bar and Grill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tFYWLHnqPt6dwccMA?g_st=ic)\n- [Streamer Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/shbPNf8hYANMQgRj7?g_st=ic)\n- [Champagne and Gyoza Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EW7xecSMPaUHXowQ6?g_st=ic)\n- [Tebasaki Original](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5agSBtXtZucfvjpS8?g_st=ic)\n\nAnd soooo many more restaurants in the area too.  Just put Akasaka into the area search on Booking or other sites and you\u2019ll find a huge range of hotel options in this area.  If I were to ever live in central Tokyo I\u2019d probably look at this neighborhood seriously for convenience, price, restaurants, and amenities like kids parks.",

My understanding is the worst that would happen for a small amount of items you don\u2019t have is they could charge you the tax before you leave. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.",

We are taking the shinkansen from Odawara at 8am to Nagoya, then Google maps has several options, most involve another transfer in Gifu. Is there a bus that goes directly from Nagoya to Gujo-Hachiman plaza? And then after about 5 hours in Gujo-Hachiman, we are hopping on another bus at 6pm to Takayama. Is it easy enough to find the Gujo-Hachiman Interchange on the side of the highway? Is it within walking distance of the main part of town or is it best to get a taxi? \n\nThanks for your help!",

I know Yamato says ~2 days, so should I ship on the 5th? We fly at 9:55PM so we'd need it around 6ish. lol I don't want to take off and leave all my souvenirs behind",

Take the train into Sapporo, hotel overnight.\n\nDay 2 - Day in Sapporo (tbh, I feel I could skip Sapporo but realize we will be jetlagged and probably need a day buffer.  Is Otaru really worthwhile to do here or should we stick with Sapporo?)\n\nDay 2 - Breakfast in Sapporo, take the train to Noboribetsu.  Visit Jigokudani and Oyunuma.\n\nDay 3 - Travel from Noboribetsu to Lake Toya.  Hike somewhere near Lake Toya.  Onsen stay overnight in Lake Toya.\n\nDay 4 - Travel to Hakodate, go up Mt Hakodate\n\nDay 5 - Shinkansen to Tokyo\n\nDo we need another day buffer in between?  My husband is a late riser, so I don't know how feasible this all is if we don't get going until 10 or 11 each day.\n\nI'm interested in Biei/Furano, but those seem to be more summer spots is that right?  Is it worth adding a day trip while we are in Sapporo to visit those?  And should we rent a car for that day?",

I would maybe do Hakodate in a day and catch the late Shinkansen to Tokyo, that way you can still see Hakodate but not miss out on Sapporo.",

[In this example,](https://imgur.com/a/lanXJOt) the JR website says the Hikari shinkansen is included, but the app doesn\u2019t say Fare Included like the train beneath it.

We'll be spending 5-6 days in Tokyo, and then travelling to Fuji, Kyoto, Osaka, and then back to Tokyo to fly home. Trip in total will be about 12ish days. My question is, will I need the 14 Day JR pass or just the 7 day? We will be solely in Tokyo for the first 6 days. Then we will need to travel the following routes:\n\n1. Tokyo to Mt Fuji\n2. Mt Fuji to Kyoto\n3. Kyoto to Osaka\n4. Osaka to Tokyo\n\n\nI have done lots of research into what the JR Pass actually gives you and it seems to be tailored to inter-city travel across Japan. If that's the case, would we be better off just sticking with a Suica card for our time in Tokyo and just buying a 7 day JR pass for the latter half of our trip?",

            "comment": "Hello, We are planning to stay one night in Hakone between our trip from Tokyo to Kyoto. We would love some recommendations on Ryokan to stay in. This trip is going to be in late June, so we understand it will most likely be oppressively hot for an onsen but we still want that mountain resort experience.\n\nThings to note:\n\n* We are traveling with a pretty big group, 6 people total. ( I have found this makes it hard to reserve on ryokan websites as they're honestly kind of janky)\n* We will probably divide 2 rooms between 3 people each unless it's easier to do 3 rooms of 2.\n* Limit is $1600 total for the night\n* 2 in our group are vegetarians, and 1 is allergic to shrimp. From my research, it seems most Ryokan are pretty accommodating though.\n* Food is a pretty big reason for this trip so please recommend Ryokans that have amazing meals!\n* Speaking of food we are looking for one that will do both Breakfast and Dinner.\n\nI was considering Yama no Chaya, but got voted out due to price. I think a stay there will be better with a smaller group anyways though.\n\nAlso, does anyone know when [https://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/](https://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/) will be available again or are they permanently closed? It seemed a pretty handy website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome ryokan we were considering:\n\n* Gora Hanaougi, but for some reason the reservation site is down (anyone know a way to reserve outside their site?) [https://gorahanaougi.com/en/](https://gorahanaougi.com/en/)\n* Kijitei Hoeiso [https://www.hoeiso.jp/](https://www.hoeiso.jp/)\n* Fukuzumiro [https://www.fukuzumi-ro.com/en/top-en/](https://www.fukuzumi-ro.com/en/top-en/)\n* Lalaca [https://lalaca.com/english/](https://lalaca.com/english/)\n* grand terrace le lien hakone [https://lelien-hakone.com/](https://lelien-hakone.com/)\n\nWe are absolutely willing to hear more recommendations, and or personal experiences with the ones listed above.\n\nThank you!",

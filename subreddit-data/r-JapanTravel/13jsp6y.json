We are keen on scenic / unique views+experiences\r  \n\r  \nOr alternatively if it worth increasing our trip by a couple of days to cover these extra locations - however I may have to purchase extra tickets outside of JR pass which Ofc is $$$.\r  \n\r  \nThanks!!",

I believe a lot of the Hells in Beppu are like the Yellowstone geyser - you can see but you cannot soak so it\u2019s more gimmicky above all else. On the other hand, Yufuin is a delightful little stretch of great shops and delicious snacks, Kinrin Lake really was breathtakingly beautiful.\n\nHaving said all that, I wouldn\u2019t bother with the effort and time to get ALL the way down to Beppu/Yufuin in your short timeframe - a quick Google Map search gives me 2h39m from Hiroshima to Beppu on JR, IMO Beppu is not a sufficiently great a destination to warrant a 5+h to visit when pressed for time.",

Happy to change my itinerary to suit travelling to that place so anywhere in Japan would be fine. I'm mostly staying in Beppu to see Yufuin but it being an onsen town would make for a nice place to relax",

There should be nice foliage there for autumn, and do go on BOTH sides for their very different view of the same \u201cbridge\u201d. \nI really, REALLY like Tottori for their sand dunes, it was a very surprising and \u201cnot-typically-Japanese\u201d sight.",

            "comment": "I'm pretty biased because I live over near Kanazawa and I think it's a great city to visit. However, it is often called \"Little Kyoto\". It has a lot to offer that is somewhat similar to Kyoto. I think they're both worth visiting but because it's Kyoto-esque and you're already going there... you may feel like it's more of the same?\n\nShirakawa is really great, and many people do it as a day trip from Kanazawa. The scenery there is pretty unique. It's a beautiful place in the mornings and the fall scenery would likely be really nice. I think it would be pretty different from other things on your itinerary. \n\nI guess having said all that, Yufuin + Beppu would possibly be more unique than Kanazawa + Shirakawa. So maybe worth the time more?\n\nHow long is your JR Pass good for? You can always activate it later in your trip. Maybe pay for some of the othe travel up front and then activate your pass a few days in if you decide to stay longer. That might already be something you have thought about though.",

            "comment": "Day 1 is definitely overbooked unless you spend only a few minutes in each location.  Its a couple hours flight from Korea + customs + baggage claim + at least an hour from Haneda or 2 from Narita to get to Shinjuku/Shibuya.  The earliest you could possible arrive at the airport in Japan is 8 am, but 10 or 11 is more likely.  So you are looking at 10am arrival in Shinjuku/Shibuya at the absolute earliest, but 12pm or later is more realistic. \n\nI'd honestly skip the Kyushu part this time around (Beppu and Yufuin) and spend time in Tokyo or Osaka if those are important to you.  There's lots of scenic stuff around the greater Osaka or Tokyo areas that would be easier to do than flying to and back from Kyushu.  Don't get me wrong, Kyushu is great, but trying to squeeze Tokyo + Kyoto + Hiroshima + Osaka + Kyushu in 10 days is going to be hard and you'll spend a lot more time traveling than actual sight seeing at that point.",

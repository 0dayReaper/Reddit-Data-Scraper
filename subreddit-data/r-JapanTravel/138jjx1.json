    "postText": "**This discussion thread has been set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel. Please stay civil, abide by the rules, and be helpful. Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* For travelers entering the country on or after April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)). The COVID/quarantine section of Visit Japan Web has been removed.\n* Tourists entering Japan should still have their Immigration process and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration and a QR code for Customs, which can smooth your entry procedures.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

Assuming the accommodation are prepaid online and they need to copy the passport etc.\n\nWould a bunch of photocopies of passport help to have with you? Paying in advance saves some time?\n\nIf it really does take 15-30 min i might prefer to book a more central place in Hokkaido and  Sendai and travel a bit more then make more 1-2 day trips from different hotels.\n\nEdit: first time international traveller so I have no idea what's normal.

For people who've had the local udon, seafood, mentaiko, motsunabe, and trying to find out of season Amaou strawberries worth that premium?\n\nNone of the day trips under 2 hours interest me. Mifuneyama Rakuen is a runner up but I'm only mildly interested given the 2.5 hour one-way transit time.\n\nMy alternative would be to add a day to Kanazawa, and try to find similar food in Osaka/Okayama.\n\nTo explain myself, I thought the Kansai Wide Area Pass didn't include Kinosaki Onsen, since it wasn't as clearly indicated on the region map as the West All Area one.\n\nCould someone confirm that travel from Himeji up to Kinosaki Onsen is covered under Kansai Wide Pass?\n\nMuch appreciated!",

The first two weeks I will be on my own and open to do whatever I want but the last two weeks I plan to stick with my friends that will arrive. They plan on going to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka and because of that I would like to visit places that I won't be able to visit in my last two weeks. My ideas so far is to chose between going to Southern Japan or Northern Japan during that time.\n\n**Southern Japan Ideas:**\n\nKanazawa/Takayama/Shirakawa-go\n\nHiroshima/Miyajima Island\n\nEhime(haven't looked in to this one much heard it might be worth visiting though)\n\nFukuoka\n\n**Northern Japan Ideas:**\n\nFukushima/Sendai\n\nAomori\n\nSapporo\n\nSome of my Interests/preferences:\n\nGood food\n\nSight-seeing/general exploring of cities\n\nwould be down for short hikes to cool locations but not the super outdoorsy type\n\nSo far I am leaning more to visiting southern Japan as there seems to be more unique and interesting places to visit but let me know if I am missing some must see places on either sides. Which one would you choose and any other recommendations are of course much appreciated!",

Knowing not just \u201cSapporo\u201d but a list of things you want to do will keep you interested.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m just finishing a week here, and was able to explore so many areas on my own.

We can't rent a car as France takes six months to issue international driving permits and we kind of screwed up not getting it done sooner.\n\nMaybe a month in one place and then a month in another?\n\nCheers!",

Will this be cutting it close to rush hour?  I'm not sure how much time to allot to customs and bag collection",

Lines like Yamanote, Chuo, Denentoshi are better avoided.",

I think the fear of rush hour tends to be overplayed, especially if you're not used to the trains. \n\nYou might hit rush hour, but you can still get on with two pieces of luggage, just go to the very front or very rear of the train, and if its completely packed you might have to just wait for the next train, but usually at the major stations, there's enough people getting off that you can get on and stake your ground with the luggage and people will fill in around you. You will likely be at the Haneda train station by 6am, maybe a little earlier, then to the Hamamatsucho by around 7am (a bit earlier if you take the rapid instead of the local), then transfer to the Yamanote line or whatever train you need to get to where you're going.\n\nAlternatively, see if there's a limo bus that can get you close to your hotel and skip the trains.",

For the sake of ease, I have been interested in getting a SIM or eSIM rather than pocket internet, but I am not sure whether my phone will be compatible. \n\nI have found SIM providers that do not have iPhone 13s on their list of compatible phones and apparently the reason for that is that this model, the European model, is not compatible with Japan\u2019s LTE and 5G bands. This is according to the Apple website, where I searched for Japan in the list of bands supported by my phone model number (A2633) and I couldn\u2019t find it. \n\nHowever, most of the eSim providers I have found seem to say it is compatible \u2014 none of them have answered my email inquiries to clarify. \n\nSo my question is: has anyone here travelled to Japan with an iPhone 13 bought in Europe and if yes, did your eSim/Sim internet work on it? Phone is unlocked.\n\nThank you in advance!",

Ideally, I don't want to go too far from Tokyo as I'll return there at the end of the trip.\n\nCurrently, I'm looking into Shizuoka. I can see myself spending one day each at Hamamatsu and Hakone, but that still leaves me with one extra day.\n\nWhat do you think of this plan? Any suggestions?",

But if you have half a day to spare, Kunosan Toshogu is good but it's at least a 3-4 hours trip.\n\nIf you are into green tea you might want to consider Kakegawa instead.

            "comment": "We're just starting our planning for a trip at probably the end of September, so we want to figure out how long to go so we can get our flights first. It seems like these 3 cities in one trip is a very popular option, so I'm wondering if there's a usual go-to recommendation for how long to spend in the country? I see all the detailed itinerary checks which will be very helpful soon, but we're not there yet.\n\nOne friend did 12 days with the first and last being transit from the US, but instead of Osaka, they did a Ryokan north of Kyoto. He thought overall it was 1-2 days too long and the Ryokan was their favorite part. Another friend went for 17 days and also went to Hiroshima. They want to go back for more cities.\n\nTwo things I want to do that I haven't seen posted much are go to a Sumo event and a baseball game. The dates we're looking at for the end of September would overlap with the final weekend of the Sumo tourney. I haven't checked the baseball schedules yet. Would adding these events onto the normal list of must-sees/dos necessitate some additional time in the trip somewhere? Also, is it hard to get a ticket to the last day of the sumo match as I assume it's the championship fight?",

                    "comment": "Go for as long as you can. Yes, most people just do the Tokyo to Kyoto/Osaka route with maybe a stop off in Hakone but you\u2019ll be very, very rushed if you\u2019re trying to cram all that into 7 - 10 days.   I\u2019d say plan at least 5 days in Tokyo and 5 days in Kyoto/Osaka (or maybe 4 nights Kyoto and 1 night Osaka). In Tokyo there are lots of day trips you can take too so I guarantee you won\u2019t get bored.  If you can, look into an open-jaw/multi-city flight where you arrive in Tokyo (NRT/HND) and depart out of Osaka (KIX).  This way you don\u2019t lose sightseeing time backtracking across the country for a regular roundtrip flight.  \n\nIf you can add on more days you could do an overnight in Hiroshima to see the Peace Myseum and visit Miyajima, a night or two in a place like Hakone or Nikko or (even better in my estimation) an onsen town like Kusatsu (best accessed from Tokyo) or Kinosaki (best accessed from Osaka/Kyoto).  There\u2019s also sooooooo much more to see in Japan than just the cities.  I love Takayama and the Kamikochi National Park is gorgeous!!! Tohoku in northern Japan has some really beautiful spots and I\u2019ve loved every trip I\u2019ve taken there. Gorgeous in any season. \n\n- [25 Day Trips from Tokyo](https://tokyocheapo.com/entertainment/easy-day-trips-from-tokyo/)\n- [Tokyo Day Trip: Utsunomiya Gyoza and Oya Stone](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mv766x/tokyo_day_trip_utsunomiya_gyoza_and_oya_stone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n- [Tokyo Day/Overnight Trip: Late Cherry Blossoms in Fuji Five Lakes Area](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/moqcwv/cherry_blossoms_in_fuji_five_lakes_dayovernight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Tokyo Day/Overnight Trip: Early February Cherry Blossoms on Izu Peninsula](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mlugpb/early_cherry_blossoms_in_the_izu_peninsula_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Tokyo Overnight Trip: Tattoo Friendly Kusatsu Onsen (Gunma)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/meafbh/trip_report_kusatsu_onsen_in_gunma/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Kyoto Day Trip: Arashiyama Scenic Railway and Riverboat Ride](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mibm8t/kyoto_sagano_scenic_train_hozugawa_riverboat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Kansai Side Trip: Tattoo Friendly Kinosaki Onsen and Himeiji Castle](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/sna5au/kansai_side_trip_tattoo_friendly_kinosaki_onsen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Takayama: Autumn Weekend (Gifu)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mg8ir9/autumn_weekend_in_takayama_gifu_prefecture/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n- [Fukushima: Samurai History and Painted Candle Illumination in Aizuwakamatsu (mid-Feb)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/metuf4/samurai_history_in_aizuwakamatsu_in_fukushima/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n- [Aomori/Akita: Cherry Blossoms and Samurai History using the 5-day JR East Tohoku Pass](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/nahtfk/chasing_cherry_blossoms_in_aomori_and_samurai/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n\nThe number 1 tip for any visit to Kyoto or Tokyo is to lump sightseeing together by district. These are *huge* and very spread out cities. Number 2 tip is to get your one to two must-see/do\u2019s done as early each day as possible.  Then, anything else you do that day, is gravy. \n\n- [Tokyo Districts](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-districts/)\n- [Kyoto Districts](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-districts)\n- [Osaka Districts](https://insideosaka.com/osaka-districts/)\n- [Save the places you want to visit in Google maps.](https://www.theunconventionalroute.com/google-maps-saved-places/) \n- Then, zoom out and see where those places are lumped together.  Do *that* specific district/area in the morning and shift to another district/area in the afternoon.  This way you don\u2019t lose time/money criss-crossing the city.  \n- See how long it will take to travel via public transit (or walking if within the same area) between your sites.  You need to account for travel time and add in an extra 15- 20 minutes from what Google Maps says as you may get turned around looking for your entrance/exit or platform in the subway/train stations. \n- Be sure you check opening hours/days in Google maps too.  You don\u2019t want to show up at 8 am to Akihabara only to find all the shops closed or to a museum on a Monday as that is often (but not always) a closed day. \n\nFinally, there\u2019s no need to recreate the wheel. Use some of these sample itineraries as a guide to plan out your days.  YouTube and TikTok are great for ideas/inspiration, but they often edit videos together in a way that makes it seem locations are much closer together than they are.  Sample itineraries like these, put the main sites together in a logical way logistically and give you a better sense of what is possible to see within a day. You don\u2019t have to follow them exactly, but they can be a helpful starting point to planning your day. \n\n- [JapanGuide: Suggested Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2400.html) \n- [JapanGuide: Tokyo Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3051.html)\n- [Truly Tokyo: Itineraries](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-itineraries/)\n- [Truly Tokyo: Kawaguchiko Day Trip](https://trulytokyo.com/a-day-trip-to-the-mt-fuji-area-lake-kawaguchiko/)\n- [JapanGuide: Tokyo Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3950.html)\n- [Inside Kyoto: Itineraries](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-itineraries)\n- [JapanGuide: Osaka Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4028.html) \n- [Inside Osaka: Itineraries](https://insideosaka.com/osaka-itineraries/)\n- [Nara Itineraries](https://www.insidekyoto.com/nara-itineraries)\n- [HakoneNavi: Itineraries](https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/course) \n- [Hakone Round Course](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5210.html) \n- [Japan Guide: Nikko Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3822.html)\n- [Nikko: One Day or Overnight Itinerary](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-tochigi/in-nikko/article-a0003340/)",

I did 1 week in Tokyo and 1 week in Kyoto and traveled out to surrounding cities. I also planned my trip last minute (bought tickets on a Sunday and flying out on a Friday) but I don't usually follow any plan during my solo trips anyway.\n\nI would suggest not to spend too much time at pop culture spots (anime, gashapon, etc.), eventually most stores are all the same but at least you know if you wanted a souvenir you're not too far from a Animate or Jump Shop. If you're not into that kinda stuff then you'll have some more time to explore.\n\nSports events felt like it would be the same as my home country (US), get there early to a stadium you may have never been before, find seats, etc. I was planning to buy a ticket to see the Osaka soccer derby, the game was sold out the day of. Be aware of the time difference of the sports event, the Osaka derby was going to be at 3PM so I didn't bother. For a first time trip, I figured I would use the time to explore more and next time I come back I will do sporting events with friends.",

Is it for daily travel expenses as well?\n\nIs it supposed to also cover purchases?\n\nWithout more information about the breakdown of your budget there's no way to know if that'd be enough.\n\n$500 USD would be plenty if accommodations are paid for, it's for one person, covers food, and minimal purchases.  Without knowing what you like to eat and how much I'd budget $70 USD per day for meals and beverages.  Given that, you are left with a little bit to make extra purchases - assuming this budget does not include transportation.\n\nIf you need to include transportation costs then that also depends on which airport you're arriving at.  Narita to Tokyo is more expensive than Haneda to Tokyo or Kansai International to Osaka.\n\nWhen I was in Japan we spent around 800 JPY per day on transportation for buses, metro, and trains within municipalities.  That does not include travel between cities.",

                                    "comment": "For perspective, on our trip in March, we spent roughly 4,300 JPY per person per night on accommodations.  This was spread across a variety of types:  airBnB, business (3-star) hotels, a ryokan, and an upscale capsule hotel.   I wound up upgrading our base experience at the ryokan a lot (upgraded the room, upgraded the food choice, etc) so our final cost for that one place was significantly higher which is not reflected in the 4,300 JPY per person per night.  :p\n\nTo me that was relatively inexpensive.\n\nFor food, there are so many options and so many budget options.  You can get away with spending 400 JPY for a breakfast.  You can also spend 1,500 JPY for a breakfast.  Some hotels have amazing breakfasts as an option or are included with the room.\n\nActual lunches (like sit down meals) typically range from 1,000 JPY to 1,500 JPY.  Even noodle shops tend to be around 1,100 JPY.  So, as an average, I figure 1,200 JPY for lunch.\n\nFor dinner, you can easily go to 4,500 JPY per person (there are lots of places that are 150,000 JPY as well) or you can find places that are 1,200 JPY to 1,500 JPY.  It really depends on what you're looking to do and experience.  This flexibility in options makes it hard to say what to budget for.    The reason I suggest 70 USD per day for food is to provide opportunity for splurge meals (all you can eat wagyu meal maybe?  special sushi meal? go to a themed cafe?)\n\nBasically whatever you budget you should be able to find something within it as long as the budget is reasonable.  I mean, you could get away with eating for less than 3,000 JPY per person per day if you wanted to and limited your food options.  It's doable.  For some people that's perfect.\n\nFor credit cards - yes, most places accept them.  If you're in a city then pretty much everywhere major accepts credit cards.  There are some exceptions such as reloading an IC card (a rechargeable card you can use for transportation and a lot of other things.)  Some restaurants do not accept credit cards but in Tokyo we didn't encounter that - everywhere we went they accepted a credit card.  Street merchants often did not accept a credit card.  So street food - cash.\n\nOn top of all of this are attractions - I bought most of our attraction tickets online and in advance.  Since I was buying them over a period of time I didn't really track how much I spent on them.  We did not go to Disney or Universal.\n\nWe used klook for a fair few of our attractions (and the JR pass we got) which allowed us a few fun discounts on attraction tickets (got 2 for 1 on teamlabs planets and teamlabs botanical) plus at the end of the trip I used up the klook points to buy very discounted 48 hour metro passes for Tokyo.\n\nFinally, we did spend almost 30,000 JPY at Ghibli Warehouse :p",

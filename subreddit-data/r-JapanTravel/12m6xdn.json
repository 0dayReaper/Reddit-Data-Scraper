    "postText": "Hello! I'm visiting Japan for the first time with my boyfriend. We've been wanting to go for years so this trip is really exciting for us! We have limited time unfortunately but still wanted to squeeze in a lot without making it too rushed. I'm worried that I'm underestimating travel time and how big these cities are. What do you guys think? \n\nThe other thing I'm unsure of is what to do on Day 3, which I currently have as a day trip to Hakone. Not sure if I should go to Hakone, another onsen town, Nara, or do an extra day in Tokyo. Would love to hear your feedback. Any food suggestions (or tourist traps to avoid) would be appreciated too. Thank you!! \n\n**Day 0 (Saturday) - Tokyo**\n\n* Land in Tokyo at night, travel to hotel and check in and chill\n\n**Day 1 (Sunday) - Tokyo**\n\n* 10am: Explore and eat at Tsukiji Market\n* \\~12:30pm: TeamLabs\n* 2-6pm: Explore Akihabara, have lunch, dinner and snacks\n* 7pm: Asakusa (Nakamise dori, Senso-ji)\n\n**Day 2 (Monday) - Tokyo**\n\n* 10am: Gyoen Garden\n* 2pm: Waho-An to relax after yesterday's walking\n* 4pm: Explore Shibuya, go to Shibuya Sky at sunset \\~5:30pm\n* Get dinner and go bar hopping the rest of night. Do you guys think staying in Shibuya would be a better time or going to Golden Gai (which I've heard is a tourist trap)? \n\n**Day 3 (Tuesday) - Travel (Hakone and Kyoto)**\n\n* Morning: Train from Tokyo to Hakone \n* 12 - 3pm: Visit a private open-air onsen; Explore Lake Ashinoko \n* 3pm - 6pm: Train to Kyoto\n* 6pm: Dinner, explore Gion area (Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka) \n\n**Day 4 (Wednesday) - Kyoto**\n\n* 8 - 10am: Fushimi Inari \n* 10am - 12pm: Go back to hotel to rest haha \n* Explore temples, Bamboo forest, etc. At night take the train to Osaka\n\n**Day 5 (Thursday) - Osaka**\n\n* 10am: Get food at Kuromon Ichiba Market\n* 12pm: Katana lesson at Last Samurai\n* 1pm - 4pm: ?? explore, I guess? Some possibilities are cafes, tea making, sumiyoshi taisha. Suggestions appreciated! \n* \\~4pm onwards: Dotombori District, Amerikamura, Shinsekai, fish your own food restaurant\n\n**Day 6 (Friday) - Osaka**\n\n* 9am - 11am: Osaka Aquarium\n* 12pm onwards: Universal Studios. Do you think it's doable to fit the Aquarium and Universal in 1 day, or would it be better to move the aquarium to the day before? I wanted to do them together to minimize travel time since they're both at the same area, but unsure if it would be too tiring. \n\n**Day 7 (Saturday): Flight**",

            "comment": "That's a very rushed itinerary.\n\nDay 3. Depending on where this onsen is, it's likely not achievable in just 3 hours. Hakone does have a local train, but that doesn't go to the lake. You have to take the local bus.\n\nDay 4. Not practical either. Kyoto is a spread out city and mainly relies on buses rather than trains. You probably won't get your rest either. Since you're not staying in Kyoto that night, check out is typically 11 am.\n\nLeaving Hakone off completely and having an extra day on Kyoto make it slightly better. But tbh with only 6 days, a much more pleasant itinerary would be to spend the entire trip either in Tokyo or Kyoto/Osaka areas... both those regions have more than enough to occupy you for at least a couple of weeks.",

            "comment": "This is very rushed. This is about a 2.5 week trip crammed in less than 6 days. \n\nRealistically you should pick Osaka area or Tokyo area. If you WANT to still have a rushed trip plan and fit both - you should really consider cutting out Hakone/Kyoto and do no day trips (so no Nara or travel to an onsen either) because even if you cut those places the trip is still rushed and I would leave a trip like that to someone who has already been to Japan and knows what specific thing they want to do and knows how to get there efficiently (so no time wasted trying to figure out the transit system for the first time and knows how jetlag affects them by now).\n\nThere's no way you'd be done with Hakone and an Onsen by 3. That's just not really possible. Hakone is spread out and transit is really SLOW. Plus it'll take an hour alone just to do an onsen and with 12-3 planned the other 2 hours would go to transit, with no time left to explore. \n\nOsaka and USJ are two full day things in my opinion. Universal is insanely busy with lots to do and the aquarium is quite large and I think worth more than 2 hours and probably better paired with something less exciting.",

            "comment": "A bit too packed to be enjoyable as other has mentioned. I would only do Tokyo and Kyoto (fly in to Tokyo, fly out from Osaka). Osaka is nice but you can experience some of the same stuff in Tokyo, and Universal is not a particularly Japanese experience when looking at how much time you would have to spend on it.      \nSame thing about Hakone. It is a nice place, but mostly for doing a stay in an onsen ryokan, and if the weather is bad absolutely nothing is accessible.      \nKyoto is amazing for experiencing temples and \"old\" Japan and has that special zen vibe when you escape the most crowded areas. A day trip to Osaka is also very doable from there since it is only 30min away.",

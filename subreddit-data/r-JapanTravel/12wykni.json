They were at their best last year in April so late May might just be the last of them, but I don\u2019t know for sure. It\u2019s a long-ish drive for there not to be flowers at the end of the journey! But it is a beautiful area regardless.",

Initially, I had a lot more packed in, but I made sure I prioritized the items so I knew what to cut when they got tired.\n\n-it\u2019s going to be tough for you to find places to eat with a group that large (I was in Japan with a group of 7 a few months ago and were frequently had to split into two or three groups). I\u2019d recommend making as many reservations as you can or going to malls so you can explore the basement food courts or nicer restaurants on the top levels.\n\n-after so many days of walking, my dad started manifesting new and (un)exciting back pains. I\u2019d recommend traveling with ibuprofen or your favorite painkillers (you can also buy these easily while you\u2019re out and about). The many, many subway stairs were surprisingly hard on my mom\u2019s ankles, so I bought her some ankle braces from 7-11 to give her more support. \n\n-I always carried a few onigiri and other conbini snacks, which ended up saving the day a few times when the elderlies got cranky. We also ended up taking way more cafe breaks than I\u2019d anticipated. Also make sure your elderlies are drinking tons of water because Japanese food has a lot of salt and my elderlies are complaining of feeling swollen.\n\n-the flowers bloomed several weeks early this year. I followed the Instagram accounts of all the flower festivals/gardens I wanted to visit to make sure things would look good when we were there; I ended up moving the itinerary around to accommodate the early blooms.\n\n-Ameyoko St is okay, but very touristy. My parents liked Yanaka Ginza a little more, which is a short bus ride/walk away from Ueno Zoo and is within striking distance of Nezu shrine if they have the legs for a 15 min walk (one way)",

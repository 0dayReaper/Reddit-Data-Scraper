    "postText": "my wife and myself are traveling around central japan for an extended period of time. I know homosexuality isn't illegal in japan, but it's not exactly openly accepted either. would it be a bad idea for us to kiss, hold hands, sit close on the train, etc? I don't want to cause any trouble or wind up getting kicked out of a restaurant or something, since I know there aren't any laws about identity-based discrimination. thanks so much for any advice xx",

You\u2019d definitely get looks if you kissed or were affectionate - that goes for all genders.\n\nThat said, sitting close on the train or holding hands is more ok. People would probably just view you as foreigners.",

            "comment": "You're foreign, so you won't be exposed to quite the same social pressure as Japanese people. And because people here don't have much exposure to openly gay people... I don't think they would pick up on it unless you really spelled it out for them. \n\nSitting close would be completely fine. If you're all giddy with excitement about something, taking one another's hand would be considered everyday behaviour too. Be cautious with kissing, though. Where we may view kissing as kind of a harmless loving and affectionate gesture... here it's kind of perceived more like ...foreplay? Definitely not something you would freely do in public.\n\nEdit to add: Japanese gay people tend to keep a low profile purely because openly demonstrating 'rogue elements' could have negative consequences for their families, friends and workplaces. But..it's more about being different, than being gay specifically, if that makes sense.",

You could be sleeping in the same bed cuddling and they wouldn't even suspect. A lot of the issues for LGBTQ+ stuff seems to come from interpersonal relationships between family and friends after coming out, and how people fit into their communities after being out. For travelers, I've never heard of it being an issue. If you kiss in public and have overly loud conversations in public, however, that may cause people to whisper and point in your general direction.",

As such, we kept PDA to a strict minimum, no more than what was necessary to assist with a mobility issue. However, we didn\u2019t have issues with this either. I felt that participating in some of the culture norms was part of the travel experience and it did not effect me negatively during our trip.

Kissing on the train I would say is not normal though! (but I\u2019ve seen sooo many couples kissing at night in public lol). Of course these are all by younger folks, they tend to not care as much about the old fashioned modesty culture. Younger people as well are pretty welcoming of LGBT (from my experience at university and my friends). So PDA among couples definitely does exist especially among the youth but maybe not as common as some other cultures (depending on where you\u2019re from). \n\nFor platonic (same sex) friends though there really isn\u2019t any problem. It\u2019s been mentioned but you can see girls (friends) hold hands/link arms here very frequently. Go to Harajuku or Shibuya, you will definitely see it! Just the other day I saw 2 boys clinging to each other too, I\u2019ve seen it a lot as well and no one bats an eye! It\u2019s funny because in the west you will not see 2 guy friends holding hands but in Asia it\u2019s normal. So a lesbian couple will probably just be seen as close friends. \n\nAnyway if you look non-Japanese, you will be given some leniency as most of your behaviours will just be chalked up to being foreign. If people stare, it\u2019s probably just because you\u2019re foreign. Like my friend gets stared at everywhere just because she\u2019s a redhead, not because she\u2019s doing anything interesting lol",

We kiss in public a lot, I would never dream of not showing affection regardless of societal norms - unless in a situation where it would be directly respectless. But that hasn't been the case in general in Japan. It is not my impression that Japanese really care about hand holding or a kiss here and there in public since no one ever seemed to even notice.",

We might drink cappuccino after breakfast when in Italy (which Italians would laugh at) or show some affection in public in Japan, it's not the end of the world. \n\nI got to meet and befriend some Japanese exchange students studying and living in Sweden and witness their cultural faux passes. For example, when finishing a pitcher of beer in Sweden you'd probably not pour the last beer to yourself, at least not without asking the table. They did this all the time, but we didnt care or get annoyed. They  were not Swedish, we are not Japanese.\n\nI think people need to relax a bit because the impression when reading this forum is that you need to act perfectly like a Japanese person when in Japan or risk being rude/annoying. I'm not saying you have a free pass to behave however you wish, but feel the room.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am a guy in his early 30s who is going to travel to Japan for three weeks on the last week of this month. It is going to be my first time in the country. A little bit of background about myself - I am into anime, video games, and Japanese food. Also, my friends (first-timers as well with similar interests) would be joining me for five days in the last week of May.\n\nI have tried to plan this itinerary by arranging some of the busiest places to visit in the early morning or on weekdays to beat the crowd. I might have overlooked something or packed too many places for a day. Any opinion or advice would be much appreciated.\n\n# \n\n# TOKYO (part 1)\n\n## Day 1 (April 25, Tuesday)\n\n* 3 pm - arrive at Narita airport\n   * Activate Keisei Skyliner roundtrip ticket and pick-up pocket wifi\n   * Reload Suica and get some yen\n* 6 pm - check-in near Nippori Station\n* 7 pm - explore around Nippori\n\n## Day 2 (April 26, Wednesday)\n\n* 7 am - Asakusa\n   * Activate Tokyo Subway Unlimited Pass 48hr\n   * Kaminarimon Gate, Nakamise-dori, Senso-ji\n   * Sumida River, Sumida Park\n* 10 am - Ginza\n   * Lunch at Turret Coffee Tsukiji\n   * Shop at Uniqlo\n* 3 pm - Akihabara\n   * A-stop Akibazone , Amiami , Yodobashi\n   * Play at arcades: Gigo and Super Potato\n\n## Day 3 (April 27, Thursday)\n\n* 7 am - Shinjuku\n   * Kabukicho, Godzilla head, Shinjuku station\n* 9 am - Tokyo Metropolitan Govt Bldg (free observatory)\n* 11 am - Shibuya\n   * Mega Donki\n   * Shibuya Parco (Nintendo, Pokemon, Jump, etc.)\n   * Shibuya crossing, Hachiko statue, Doraemon statue\n* 3 pm - Ikebukuro \n   * Animate flagship store (largest)\n\n## Day 4 (April 28, Friday)\n\n* 9 am - Depart to the Philippines\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *\\** *Philippines (April 28 - May 26)\\** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TOKYO (part 2)\n\n## Day 1 (May 26, Friday]\n\n* 11:45 am - arrive at Narita airport\n   * Exchange JR Rail exchange order for the pass and pick-up pocket wifi\n   * Reload Suica and get some yen\n* 2 pm - check-in near Ogawamachi station\n   * Mostly rest because of an early flight beforehand\n\n## Day 2 (May 27, Saturday) [with friends]\n\n* 10 am - check out\n* 10:15 am - explore around Ogawamachi \n* 1 pm - Akihabara\n   * Explore around\n* 4 pm - meet up with friends at Keisei Ueno Station\n* 5 pm - check-in near Asakusa Station\n* Evening - Asakusa\n   * Kaminarimon Gate, Nakamise-dori, Senso-ji\n   * Sumida River, Sumida Park\n\n## Day 3 (May 28, Sunday) [with friends]\n\n* Activate Tokyo Subway Unlimited Pass 72hr\n* 7 am - Shin Marunouchi Building\n* 9 am - Tokyo Tower (observatory)\n* 11 am - Akasaka\n   * Harry Potter area and cafe\n   * Hie Shrine\n* 3 pm - Akihabara\n   * Shop and play at arcades\n   * M's Pop Life Adult Department Store\n   * Dinner at Chibachan (Karaage Boat)\n\n## Day 4 (May 29, Monday) [with friends]\n\n* 6 am until 3 pm (or earlier) - Kawaguchiko\n   * Arakurayama Sengen Shrine\n   * Mt.Fuji Panoramic Ropeway\n   * Lunch at Hotou Fudo before leaving\n* 5pm (or earlier) until late night - Shinjuku\n   * Tokyo Metropolitan Govt Bldg\n   * Kabukicho, Godzilla light show at Toho cinema\n   * Dinner with drinks at Hanbey (izakaya with Showa-era vibe)\n   * Catch the last train\n\n## Day 5 (May 30, Tuesday) [with friends]\n\n* 7 am - Harajuku\n   * Meiji Shrine\n   * Takeshita street\n   * Breakfast at Happy Pancake\n* 2 pm until late night - Shibuya\n   * Hachiko statue, Shibuya Parco, Shibuya crossing\n   * Shibuya Sky (1 hour before sunset)\n   * Miyashita Park (Doraemon statue)\n   * Mega Donki\n   * Dinner with drinks at Nonbei Yokocho\n   * Catch the last train\n\n## Day 6 (May 31, Wednesday) [with friends]\n\n* 7 am - Ueno\n   * Ameyoko, Ueno Park\n* 11 am - Ginza\n   * Shop at Uniqlo and  Muji\n* 3 pm - Odaiba\n   * Statue of Liberty\n   * Doraemon Times Square\n   * Unicorn Gundam\n\n## Day 7 (June 1, Thursday) \n\n\\- first day of JR pass\n\n* 12:30 pm - Yokohama\n   * Gundam Factory\n   * Lunch at Chinatown\n* 5 pm - check-in near Akasaka station\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# KYOTO\n\n## Day 8 (June 2, Friday)\n\n* 11 am - depart for Kyoto\n* 2 pm - arrive at Kyoto then check in near Kiyomizu-dera\n* 3 pm - mostly relax then explore around Higashiyama Ward\n\n## Day 9 (June 3, Saturday)\n\n* 6 am - Fushimi Inari Taisha (until Yotsutsiji Intersection)\n* 8 am - Coffee at Starbucks Ninenzaka\n* 9 am - Higashiyama\n   * Ninenzaka, Sannenzaka, Kiyomizu-dera\n   * Gion, Yasaka Shrine\n* 12 pm - Lunch at Nishiki Market then eat at Kamo River\n* 3 pm - Arashiyama\n   * Bamboo Grove, Tenryu-ji, Kimono Forest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# OSAKA\n\n## Day 10 (June 4, Sunday)\n\n* 11 am - depart for Osaka\n* 11:30 am - arrive at Osaka\n* 3 pm - check-in near Shin-Osaka station\n* 4 pm - Shinsekai\n* 5 pm - Denden Town\n* 6 pm - Dotonbori\n   * Glico Sign\n   * Dinner: Okonomiyaki Mizuno, Takoyaki Wanaka, Genrokozushi\n\n## Day 11 (June 5, Monday)\n\n* 7 am - Universal Studios Japan\n   * Super Nintendo World, Harry Potter, Jujutsu Kaisen, Spider-man\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# HIROSHIMA &amp;

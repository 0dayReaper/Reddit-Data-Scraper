    "postText": "Hello! I'm taking a much delayed honeymoon to Japan this July/August, and my wife and I really want to spend a few days exploring Yoshino Kumano Park. However, we're not sure about the best way to do so. Ideally we just want to find a place where we can stay and easily access the park and trails without having to use too much public transit or rent a car. We're coming in from Nara so the Nothern side of the park is ideal.\n\nIf it matters, I've traveled to Japan multiple times and am fluent in the language. Honestly any advice about enjoying the National Parks of Japan would be appreciated, I've only ever done urban travel in Japan and really want to try out some nature sight-seeing! Thank you for your help!!",

    "postText": "We are thrilled about our upcoming trip to Japan with our 18-month-old son. However, we are facing a significant challenge due to his severe food allergies. He is allergic to chicken eggs, sesame, and avocado, and we're aware that these ingredients are commonly used in many Japanese dishes. We anticipate that finding suitable food options for him might be quite challenging, especially considering the potential for sesame cross-contamination in restaurants.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate your assistance and expertise in suggesting some snack and meal options for our toddler. We understand that 7/11 and Lawson's stores are prevalent in Japan and might have some allergy-friendly choices. We are specifically looking for snacks and meals that do not contain eggs, sesame, or avocado.\n\nSo far, we have come up with a few ideas, but we would be incredibly grateful if you could share any additional suggestions or tips:\n\nYogurt\nFruit\nRice\nLunch meat (such as Subway)\nMcDonald's (specifically edamame and corn)\nString cheese\nCereal\nTomatoes\n\nWe genuinely value your knowledge and experiences. If you have any recommendations for specific snacks or meals available at 7/11 or Lawson's, or if you know of any allergy-friendly restaurants or eateries in Tokyo, please share your insights with us.\n\nThank you all in advance for your incredible help and suggestions. We are excited about our upcoming adventure in Japan and eager to ensure our little one has a safe and enjoyable culinary experience!",

Allergies are hard, harder still in a picky toddler! Let the parents enjoy their holiday, a couple of weeks of your kid eating some takeaway is not going to hurt anyone - I\u2019m pretty sure they aren\u2019t suggesting it for 3 meals a day.",

            "comment": "Sesame oil is used a lot and the kitchen staff might not even be aware of whether it\u2019s in the food, so I would recommend buying foods that are labeled with ingredients or are so simple that you clearly know what\u2019s in them i.e. just fruit or whatever. Lucky for you he\u2019s young enough that you can take him to a restaurant and eat while providing him with something else. Rice balls covered with nori could contain sesame oil so maybe steer clear. Do consider printing up a card in Japanese that explains the allergies and their severity. Supermarket shopping and getting accommodation with a kitchen could make things easier for you, for sure.",

Plan for a lodging that has a kitchen and shop at grocery stores where you can take your time to read labels. Avocado will be easy to avoid, eggs are an allergen that should be labeled, but sesame oil might be hard.  I\u2019d recommend a custom translation card from a site like Select Wisely.   You can also get a custom translation card with info on what to do in a medical situation where your child does ingest an allergen.  \n\n- [Food Allergies in Japan](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0001856/)\n- [Quick Guide to Allergens in Japan](https://savvytokyo.com/quick-guide-know-and-understand-food-allergies-in-japan/)\n- [SelectWisely Allergy/Medical Translation Cards](https://www.selectwisely.com)\n- [Printable Allergy Cards Japanese (Free)](https://justhungry.com/japan-dining-out-cards)",

            "comment": "Honestly with a kid that young and multiple allergies, I might consider getting an Airbnb and doing most of the cooking \u201cat home.\u201d \n\nWhile egg allergies are generally widely understood (and avocado is actually kind of rare to find), sesame will be an issue. Increasingly I see kid foods at the grocery store (and occasionally restaurants) with allergy information labeled, but this is normally for just egg, milk, etc. And no idea of how strict they are for manufacturing cross-contamination. \n\nBut the good thing is that grocery shopping can be lots of fun, and a neat way to \u201cexplore\u201d Japan. And during COVID a lot more restaurants started offering takeout/delivery, so if the adults want something more interesting to eat at home there are options.",

            "comment": "Oof, both sesame and egg are everywhere. The problem is that both these ingredients are also processed into other products, like common sauces, dressings. A lot of restaurants are starting to labeling allergens, but not very trustworthy. When i order food labelled lactose free, sometimes the food still came with cream sauces, dairy sides/toppings.. Once we had a fruit bowl as part of a set menu, with crunchy bits. It was sesame crackers, was delicious, but nowhere was sesame mentioned. Like others already said, preparing your own food in your own kitchen is the safest way. No chance of cross comtamination. We ve seen sesame grinders on tables at ramen restaurants, sesame was also given at tonkotsu restaurant. Depend on how allergic your child is, those kind of restaurant miggt be a huge problem. There must be a lot of sesamedust/residues in the restaurant and kitchens.",

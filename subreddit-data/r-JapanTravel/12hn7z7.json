    "postText": "Hello !\n\nAs said in the title, this is my first ever solo trip, not only abroad ! I write this late, this trip begin in two weeks !\n\nI've always wanted to visit Japan (I enjoy natural wonders, forest and just walking and discovering things, even in big cities). These past 3 years were tough mentally, and I wanted to know if I can plan a 2 weeks trip by myself, so I choose Japan as my destination, if I could say, a \"challenge\".\n\nI will have to rely on my English (I am a french native speaker and due to unplanned things, I couldn't learn japanese as I have planned this year..). I am quite young (21f) and Japan seems like a safe country, as long as I continue to be cautious.\n\nIf you can give me any feedback on what I have planned, this would be appreciated ! As well as advices !!\n\nI am not planning to go to expensive restaurants, I'd rather eat something cheaper as I enjoy all types of food, I love discovering new dishes ! And I plan to buy souvenirs, like wooden-made, chimes, and meaningful souvenirs. And some clothes too. So if you have any recommendations on that, thank you in advance !!\n\np.s. : I have a JR pass, and I already checked the transport for \"no-JR-pass lines\" !\n\n**Day 1-5 Tokyo (Sakura Hotel Ikebukuro)**\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n* Arrival in Narita airport / Check-In Hostel\n* Yoyogi-Koen park\n* Meiji jingu\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n* Rikugi-en\n* Nezu-jinja\n* Shitamachi museum (Ueno park)\n* Hanazono Inari Shrine\n* Yanaka Ginza\n* Tokyo character street\n* Monzennakacho\n\n**Day 3:**\n\n* Todoroki Ravine Park\n* Setagaya walk\n* Sengaku-ji\n* Shibuya\n* Shimokitazawa\n\n**Day 4:**\n\n* Tonogayato garden\n* Tatemono-en museum\n* (Senso-ji ?)\n* Kichijoji\n* (Shinyokohama Ramen Museum ?)\n\n**Day 5: Train to Nagoya**\n\n* sending suitcase to Kyoto (Yamato transport)\n* Nakano Broadway\n* Shinjuku Golden Gai\n* Omoide Yokocho\n* Train to Nagoya\n\n**Day 6-8 Kiso (a short part of the Nakasendo trail)**\n\n**Day 6: Magome, Tsumago, Nagiso (Kiso Mikayawa)**\n\n* Train to Nakatsugawa\n* (Ruins castle ?)\n* (Ochiai ?)\n* Walk to Magome -&gt; Tsumago -&gt; Nagiso\n* (Castle ruins ?)\n* Train to Kiso-Fukushima\n\n**Day 7: Fukushima, Narai (Hama no yu Suwa)**\n\n* Fukushima -&gt; Narai\n* Train to Suwa\n\n**Day 8-15 Kyoto, Himeji, Okunoin, Nara**\n\n**Day 8: Train to Kyoto (Gion Ryokan Q-beh)**\n\n* Train to Kyoto early\n\n(I have not planned anything yet, but I think this will just be me chilling and walking around, discovering things)\n\n* Collect my suitcase\n\n**Day 9: Himeji**\n\n* Train to Himeji early in the morning\n* Himeji Castle\n* walking around in the city\n* (back to Kyoto, stop by Kobe ? is it worth it ?)\n\n**Day 10: Okuno-in Cemetery (the visit that made me choose Japan as my destination !)**\n\n* Train to Okunoin (I have to check where to go, which train to take...)\n* Full day walking in the area\n* back to Kyoto\n\n**Day 11: Nara**\n\n* Train to Nara\n* Nara park\n* Naramachi\n* Kasuga Primeval Forest\n* back to Kyoto\n\n**Day 12: Full day Kyoto**\n\n* Philosopher's Path (very early in the morning)\n* Gion -&gt; Naneizaka (Sannen-zaka Path) -&gt; Kiyomizu-dera (Otowanotaki)\n* Higashiyama-ku\n* Enko-ji\n* Potoncho Alley by night\n* sending suitcase to the airport (is it possible ?)\n\n**Day 13:**\n\n* Mount Kurama\n* Kifune-jinja\n\n**Day 14: Last full day**\n\n* Fushimi Inari Taisha before dawn\n* Train to Narita airport\n* Sleep at the airport\n\n**Day 15: Back to my country**\n\nAs you can see, some days are not very full, I'll take time this week to properly finish, or just improvise that day !I rely on my french backpacker's guide to find restaurant or street food spots !",

            "comment": "hello! looking like an awesome itinerary! i have some experience with this part of your journey so might put in a few comments for the Day 6-8 Kiso section. I've done this trail and I think it might be a good option to base yourself in Nagano instead and explore places like Kamikochi, Mt. Tateyama, Hakuba etc as well as have easy access to the Nakasendo trail. I visited other parts of Kiso and I feel like it could be fully experienced in a day so the natural beauty of the Chubu region can be better explored if you based yourself in Nagano and went to other areas too :) Then you can head down to Nagoya and continue your Kyoto leg too!",

            "comment": "Don\u2019t rely only on a backpackers guide to find food - it will be outdated and inaccurate. Google maps and searching for the kind of food you want works well.\n\nI did just the Magome-Nagiso section of the nakasendo but spent some time looking into the logistics of doing more of it:\n\nThe castle ruins near nakatsugawa is a whole different bus ride from the train station than the bus to Magome, and the buses aren\u2019t that frequent. (They look cool so I looked into if I could get there when I visited) You won\u2019t realistically have time to go there and also to explore both post towns and walk between them.\n\nIf you are planning to walk all the way from Nakatsugawa to Nagiso without taking the bus to Magome, then you should take the first Shinano or spend the night before in Nakatsugawa instead of Nagoya. \n\nFrom what I remember of the photos on google maps, the castle ruins in Nagiso are just a hill, with no real ruins left.\n\nMake sure you know the train schedule between Nagiso and Kiso-Fukushima because trains stopping at Nagiso aren\u2019t that frequent at certain times of day.",

Thank you for that !\n\nOn Maps, I researched for the walk from Nakatsugawa to Nagiso, it says 4h30 approximatively... maybe maps think I'm doing it quickly... I'll take that into account..\n\nedit : yes I'll take the shinano in the morning !\n\nYes I think I won't do the nagiso castle ruins, reviews are not that great and it seems there is no much thing to see.\n\nThank you for all of that !!",

You should plan on allowing at least 3 hours more for exploring Magome and Tsumago, getting lunch, visiting the tea house near the pass, and stopping to take pictures. Be sure to try goheimochi and the steamed buns that are the other local specialty. Both are delicious.",

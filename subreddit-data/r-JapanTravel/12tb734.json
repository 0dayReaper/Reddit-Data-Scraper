            "comment": "Only chipping in for the Akiba vs Ikebukuro bit... As a female I like Ikebukuro a lot, so much that I stay here almost every Tokyo trip, even typing this in a hotel here lol. If you like anime themed cafes, Ikebukuro has way more than Akiba, and things in Ikebukuro are more central than Akiba. Have you heard of the Otome Road? If not you can google for more info. There's also a butler cafe but you need to book well ahead. I also like the Sunshine City Mall as the aquarium is cute and tons of food options, and there's also a Pokemon Center and Namja Town. Just went there today and there's a Bandai Namco store at where J World used to be. It's a dangerous place for the wallet...\n\n\nFor Akiba, I find the stores to be a bit too scattered and in general I find Akiba more geared towards guys. I usually would only go to Akiba if I'm checking other things nearby; I personally don't dedicate a day for Akiba.\n\n\nAnother good options for looking for rare anime goods is Nakano Broadway.\n\n\nBut since you're going from Asakusa... Ikebukuro would be far. Akiba is closer. If you only wanted to look for simple anime stuff, why not go to the skytree? The Solamachi mall has quite a few anime shops and it's very close to Asakusa. Ll\n\n\nI don't have time to look through everything in your itinerary, but just make sure you factor in travel time and always leave extra as this is your first trip, so it is easy to get lost at a subway. Getting out from the wrong exit (east vs west in Shinjuku for example) could end up causing a 20+ min delay... Use Google map and change the time to reflect actual of the day to get a better idea of commute time. Try to group what you're checking out together in nearby areas to reduce transit time.",

However, transfers do occur.  \n1 to 2 times.  \nIn addition, there are two types of trains, a regular train and a limited express train, \n\nand the price is  \nNormal 1230 yen  \nLimited express 2750 yen  \nThere is no transfer for the bus. Arrive directly at Ginza. However, since the departure is at 15:50, you have to wait a little while at the airport.  \nThe price is 1300 yen  \nNarita Airport is currently very busy, so it may take some time before you can enter the country.  \nAlso, the Japanese subway is very complicated, so if you want to go smoothly, I recommend the bus.  \nYou can see more information at the link below.  \n\n\nhttps://www.jorudan.co.jp/norikae/cgi/nori.cgi?eki1=%E6%88%90%E7%94%B0%E7%A9%BA%E6%B8%AF&amp;eki2=%E9%8A%80%E5%BA%A7&amp;via\\_on=-1&amp;eki3=&amp;eki4=&amp;eki5=&amp;eki6=&amp;Dyy=2023&amp;Dmm=4&amp;Ddd=21&amp;Dhh=15&amp;Dmn1=0&amp;Dmn2=0&amp;Cway=0&amp;Cfp=1&amp;Czu=2&amp;C7=1&amp;C2=0&amp;C3=0&amp;C1=0&amp;sort=rec&amp;C4=5&amp;C5=0&amp;C6=2&amp;S=search&amp;Cmap1=&amp;rf=nr&amp;pg=0&amp;eok1=R-&amp;eok2=R-&amp;eok3=&amp;eok4=&amp;eok5=&amp;eok6=&amp;Csg=1\n\n  \nHave a nice trip to Japan!",

We saved up for Shibuya Sky views which were well worth it. \n\n\nDAY 1 23/4\n\n\u201c- Lunch @ Manten Sushi\n\n- Check out thrift stores @ Shimokitazawa. Also interested in Gotokuji Temple, is it worth it due to my limited time? Or skip?\u201d\n\nshimokitazawa was a cool walk but as someone else said, it\u2019s almost all Americana thrift stores and super overpriced for someone coming from the thrift stores in North America. I got bored fast. \n\n\u201c- Shibuya &amp; Omotesando: Shibuya Crossing, Nezu Museum, &amp; shops basically\n\n- Shibuya Sky RESERVED 5 PM\n\n- Continue to explore around the area after\u201d\n\nLots of time here \n\n\n\u201cDAY 3 25/5\nActivate JR Pass today\n\n- Arrive in Kyoto before noon\n\n- Nishiki Market\n\n- Arashiyama: Bamboo Forest in the evening, Arabica, Miffy Bakery\n\n- Explore Gion area\n\n- Dinner @ Kichi Kichi Omurice - RESERVED\n\n- Explore Pontocho area\u201d\n\nThis is a lot in one day but a lot of it is close together. Arashiyama is quite a train ride from Kyoto though and will eat Into your day. Monkey park is cool too but you don\u2019t have time here. \n\nGion is cool. Mostly shops and tourists lol\n\n\n\u201cDAY 4 26/4\n\n- Fushimi Inari \n\n- Kiyomizu Dera\n\n- Explore Higashiyama &amp; Ninenzaka area\n\n- Dinner @ Gyukatsu Motomura\u201d\n\nFushimi Inari and Kiyomizu Dera are must dos for sure. Fushimi Inari is WAY better if you can find the back entrance. Hardly anyone makes it to the top so great views of the tori gates up there. \n\nLots of time on this day. \n\n\n\u201cDAY 5 27/4\n\n- Arrive In Osaka before noon\n\n- Katsuoji\n\n- Izakaya Toyo\n\n- Kuromon Market\n\n- Dinner @ Tsurugyu RESERVED\n\n- Explore Dotonbori\u201d\n\nKuromon and Dotonbori are insanely busy but amazing. So much food and shopping. Highly recommend Pablo\u2019s cheesecake or Rikuro\u2019s Namba Fluffy cheesecake. Amazing!\n\n\nI don\u2019t have much insight into the rest of your trip. I didn\u2019t love Akihabara, but I\u2019m not an anime fan either. \n\nHave fun and don\u2019t be afraid to switch up your itinerary once you\u2019re there when you see something cool! \n\nI just got back from 14 days yesterday and I already miss it!",

I mostly want to go up the mori tower to see the view of tokyo (+ tokyo skytree) at night as opposed to shibuya sky at daylight/sunset. \n\nAlright i'm rethinking shimokitazawa lol currently trying to do more research on the thrifting scene in general\n\nAnd i've never heard about the back entrance of fushimi inari, i'll definitely look it up!",

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (South Tower only) also has amazing views of Tokyo from the 45th floor (202m), is free and is open until 10pm.  \n\nWe went there around 5pm to see the sunset. Plenty of room to sit, a little gift shop and wasn\u2019t crazy busy. You might have to queue up for a bit to go up though, but they post signs showing the wait. \n\nWorth it!",

            "comment": "Hi,\nJust came home from a wonderful trip to Japan. Here are my thoughts and recommendations to your upcoming trip. Enjoy, it truly is an amazing country!\n\n1. My biggest reflection after 3 weeks in Japan was that I wished we did less of the \"must see\". Most of the things \"you have to to\" was crowded to an extent where it took the fun away. I recommend to instead wander the streets and find something that interests you.\n\n2. If you like thrift shops, I recommend Kinji in Shibuya and 2nd street stores. \n\n3. In Shibuya, you must visit Grandfathers, a cozy Isakaya with focus on smooth music. It's quite hard to find, so good luck. \n\n4. Highly recommend Yoyogi park. It is mainly locals and expats who hang out here. Quite a beautiful and tranquil place in a buzzing city.\n\n5. Avoid Nishiki market at all costs. This was the most crowded place we came to and it was impossible to enjoy anything since all the tourist pushed you on. There are better alternatives to this street both in Tokyo and Osaka. \n\n6. Bamboo forest was a huge let down. A very tiny forest that you pass in 2 to 3 minutes. Not worth the trip out in my honest opinion. \n\n7. If you are going to Izakaya Toya, expect to stand in a queue for at least 90 minutes. We stood in line for a while in the hot sun before giving up. If you really want the same experience as half of the tourists visiting Tokyo, bring a camping chair, because you will be waiting for a while.\n\n8. Visit a local kareoke bar, one of the best experiences.\n\n9. Don't expect too much from Chichu art museum. It tries a little too much to be a modern special museum. It had a few interesting pieces. Explore Naoshima, a beautiful island in its own right. \n\n10. Try the food from the convince stores, they are actually surprisingly good. \n\n11. Get a suica or Pasmo card. \n\n12. Have fun.",

It took me about 3 times as long to get anywhere as Google maps said it would coz I kept getting lost/confused. So on that note it's worth prioritising things that you really want to see and things your not so fussed about if everything doesn't quite go to plan. \nHave fun!",

So far it's been easy and a lot of times i did choose to walk instead of using public transportation because it takes roughly the same time &amp; to save money hahah.

The train takes you to Ikeburuko pretty quickly from that station so if you have time maybe both, they did open the NEW Animate store in Ikeburuko last month.",

            "comment": "I'd move the senso-ji/kappabashi/ueno park bit to the second half of trip, given the fact that your hotel is in Ueno itself. Especially if you want to buy something in Kappabashi, so you don't have to drag that around for 2+weeks.\n\n3 full days in Hiroshima seems like 1 too many if you need 1 for the peace park and 1 for Okunoshim.a Why not add an extra night to the ryokan in Mijayima instead? Gives you more time to enjoy that experience and see the island on a more leisurely pace.",

            "comment": "I agree that you're probably staying one day too much in Hiroshima, which is a very nice and enjoyable city, but so are Kyoto and Osaka. I'd probably use that \"extra\" day to visit Kyoto with less of a hurry (consider that many points of interest are very distant from each other, so it's hard to visit Kiyomizudera, Fushimi Inari and Kinkakuji on the same day, for example).",

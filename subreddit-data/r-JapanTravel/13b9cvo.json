    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI have posted my itinerary here, but I wanted one last check before we head there in a few days.  I and 5 friends (18-20M) plan to go to Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, and Osaka in 4 days. I would appreciate any feedback on the itinerary or any help in general with Japan (hotels, attractions, logistics with the schedule, etc.).\n\nA few questions I have:\n\n1. What time would be optimal to wake up and leave the AirBnB? I was thinking of leaving by 8 am every day. Are there specific attractions that are better to wake up early/late?\n2. Are the trains complicated (are we able to figure them out there?)\n3. Does anything on the itinerary need to be booked in advance?\n4. Our day 11 in Osaka hasn't been finalized but I put down some ideas, which attractions are best to go to?\n5.

Note that shops don't open until 10 or 11am so if that's your first activity for the day then you can start later.\n\nTrains aren't too complicated. It can look confusing as there are a lot of train lines but once you get it it's pretty easy to navigate.",

Then a lot of the following days that were unplanned lead us to going to subdue a we\u2019d heard on the trains, where we found new things. I think just having a scratch of plan even if it\u2019s fully malleable is still helpful to having a good direction for your trip.",

Take your time and use gps + instructions the air bnb lister gave to you\n\n- Generally for your itinerary going out out at 8 is good\n\nDay 2: you can go out earlier like 7 then to tsukiji market first (then to hamatikyu, imperial palace, ginza, then teamlab + odaiba). If you go at 8, it will be very crowded. \n\n*Teamlab planets. Not borderless.\n\nDay 4: that is very far with a lot of stops. Same, going out at 7 (or even 6) also good\n\nDay 7: lake ashi?? Lake ashi is already in hakone round course. You mean lake kawaguchi?\n\nDay 11: kuromon first, then osaka aquarium, then the rest (you can do dotonbori and namba at night)\n\n\n- What you need to book in advance:\n\nTeamlab planets\n\nUSJ\n\n- the train can be confusing at first, google map is your friend. It usually tell you which platform you need to wait. Look for signs above you, or on the wall (usually above you). You will get used to it after few days. \n\nAnd learn about local and rapid / express train. Local means it stops on all stops. Rapid / express stops on select few (faster).\n\nSame with shinkansen kodama and hikari. Kodama stops at all stops while hikari stops at select few (faster). And you cannot use nozomi if you use jr pass",

The usual opening time is around 10-12 noon, and the visit take an hour in average.\n\nBy the way, Hozugawa Boat ride is now suspended  until the end of May due to the accident back in March (https://www.hozugawakudari.co.jp). So, you might as well save that for a later trip, and enjoy Ararshiyama in a more relaxed pace in the afternoon.",

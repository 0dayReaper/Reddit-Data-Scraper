    "postText": "Hi, I'll be in Japan soon and had been hoping to attend a lot of events: concerts, sumo, kcon etc. but if I understand the system correctly, it seems like everything is quickly sold out, and then only the original purchaser is allowed to enter, l.e tickets cannot be resold. So I think I am basically stuck in not being able to attend these events. Am I understanding correctly or is there some alternative?",

If you can pay for it in cash that would be ideal to avoid any foreign card issue or any identity third party app verification requirements.

Then I made the ticket reservation on the app and paid for it at FamilyMart with cash using one of their ticket machines, which got me around the Japanese credit card requirement.\n\nAnd even after that, I was a bit worried that the ticket was under my name written in katakana (translated with Google) as required by the form, while my ID is obviously written in English.

Was the plan automatically terminated after x months?",

Getting tickets to the others is again practically impossible unless you have a friend who can read Japanese and help you with the rest.\n\nMost places open up between 1-3 months in advance and sell out quickly. \n\nLawson sometimes you can find tickets If you're lucky.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nWe'll be visiting Nagoya from June 3-4. I am researching there seem to be a TON of festivals happening that specific weekend around the area. Can I get some help on which ones to prioritize? Are these all actually happening this year? Are there any more that I should check out? This seems amazing and at the same time too much to do on a short weekend.\n\nSome I found were\n\n1. [Horikawa Festival](http://horikawamachi.net/festival.html) Seems like the main draw this weekend. Are fireworks on Saturday or Sunday?\n2. [Atsuta Festival (Shobusai Festival)](https://www.nagoya-info.jp/en/event/detail/155/) Is this part of the previous festival? I see fireworks for Monday night June 5th as well?\n3. [Dekimachi Tenno Festival](https://www.nagoya-info.jp/en/event/detail/157/)\n4. [Okehazama Historical Battlefield Festival](https://www.aichi-now.jp/en/spots/detail/1122/)\n5. [Arimatsu Shibori Festival](https://www.aichi-now.jp/en/spots/detail/1314/)\n6. [Tebasaki Summit\u00ae NINE](https://www.aichi-now.jp/en/spots/detail/2191/) Chicken wing festival?!\n7. [Tokkawa Firefly Festival](https://www.aichi-now.jp/en/spots/detail/1370/)\n8. [Tsuruma Park Flower Festival](https://www.nagoya-info.jp/en/event/detail/42/)\n\nThank you all",

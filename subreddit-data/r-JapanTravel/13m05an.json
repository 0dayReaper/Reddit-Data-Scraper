Just open up Google maps and head to the nearest subway or train station. There\u2019s likely one within a short walk of where you are.  Outside of the station, on one side or the other is a taxi stand/queue.  Or, just search the nearby area in Google Maps for Taxi Stand and you\u2019ll likely find an option nearby. Outside of hotels or major tourist spots like museums there\u2019s also likely a taxi stand.  Or, if at a restaurant or hotel, you can ask the staff to call a cab to pick you up.   Alternatively, use Uber as in Tokyo it dispatches a cab to your location. Many of the ones passing by that seem empty are likely on their way to pickup those who\u2019ve used an app to book their ride/pickup location.",

This is often a issue if you try to catch a cab near a station but outside the taxi stand. \n\nThe best place to hail cabs, outside of taxi stands, is large roads, not side streets. On a side street they are probably going to a call or returning from a long one.",

            "comment": "Just got back from Tokyo on the 10th of April, staying predominantly in Shibuya. A couple of small thoughts on the Tokyo side!\n\n* Ichiran ramen in Shibuya everyday had a long queue - saw a guy standing outside sometimes with a 45 min wait sign. Shinjuku\u2019s probably a teeny bit quieter than Shibuya but would suggest planning to be there a bit before opening if you don\u2019t want a long wait (or go on the backside of lunch). \n* Potential to swap Shibuya/Harajuku around? If you do Shibuya towards the end of the day, you\u2019ll get the crossing at it\u2019s busiest (it\u2019s a spectacle no matter where you are by the crossing, novel to get into the midst of it), and I\u2019d also suggest buying tickets for Shibuya sky to time with sunset/dusk. We went up at about 6pm and it\u2019s just stunning to see the city shift from day to night - Tokyo is spectacular lit up. Definitely book though!\n* Sakura street is all green now, Cherry blossoms have moved on, it\u2019s pretty but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to see it. \n* Day 3 night - maybe could look into Roppiongi or Ebisu? Or if you don\u2019t do it on your Harajuku day, Omotesando/Aoyama?",

I wanted to go to the sky bar but it seems it's sold out but will try to book the sky for around that time. \n\nIs Ichiban worth the wait? I'm sure there's plenty of exceptional places for ramen?! Will definitely look at those day 3 options. Thanks again.",

If you look at people waiting in line, they are tourists. \n\nRather than looking at trip advisor etc., it's best to read from those who specialize in visiting lots of Ramen shops. Here is a sample of some good places in Shibuya. Of course there are literally thousands of good ramen shops in Tokyo that are not chains like Ichiran and Ippudo\n\nhttps://ramenbeast.com/blogs/news/shibuyas-best-ramen-shops-1\n\nhttps://www.tokyoramentours.com/post/shibuya-ramen\n\nhttps://www.5amramen.com/post/best-10-shibuya-ramen",

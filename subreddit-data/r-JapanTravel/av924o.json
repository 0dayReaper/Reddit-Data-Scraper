    "postText": "I read an article recently about how Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka are heavily overtouristed, and the problem seems to be getting worse, fraying the nerves of both visitors and locals. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope people could consider getting off the beaten tourist path a bit and going outside the \"golden highway\" between Tokyo and Osaka. There's plenty of locations in Japan that are absolutely beautiful, fun, and culturally enriching, which have very, very few foreign tourists (or any tourists at all, sometimes). All of the best experiences I've had in the country were away from the crowds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's some ideas, and if other people wanted to contribute some, maybe that would be cool and helpful to some folk :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKyoto has plenty of beautiful temples, shrines, and gardens. But also plenty of tourists. Hirosaki and Kanazawa both have some excellent temples, shrines, and gardens, along with castle ruins at both. They're far less crowded and the people are very welcoming. \n\nFor nightlife, Sapporo in the North and Fukuoka in the South, both have some great party areas with packed bars and excellent brew on tap. \n\nDay trips to Mt. Fuji are nice, but Mt. Aso in Kyushu (active volcano with huge, green caldera you can take a ropeway up to see), Mt. Hakodate in Southern Hokkaido (the view from the summit is the most stunning in the world at night), and Mt. Haku in Gifu, which is quiet yet beautiful.\n\nIf you really want to experience some of Japan's remote and unspoiled beauty, any of the cities and towns dotting the Sea of Japan (\"other\" coastline) get practically no visitors from outside the country (aside from Niigata, and even that place is underrated). Tottori has amazing sand dunes with all the associated fun activities (sandboarding, paragliding, camel rides, and a local legend about a cursed woman). \n\nOr practically anywhere in Shikoku, which is basically the everyday Japan, without the hype. The prefectural capitals here all have museums, nightlife, attractions, and restaurants (geared towards locals instead of tourists, so higher quality and lower price). The towns and villages are full of friendly and interesting people, and the air is often so fresh it's intoxicating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI definitely don't want to slam Tokyo or Osaka; I love those places and everyone needs to check them out at least once in their lifetime. But dedicating part of your vacation to seeing some of Japan's less instagrammed places could be a really awesome experience, too :)",

So of course they're gonna visit the most popular 3 cities if it's their only chance. It's like telling a visitor to USA \"Don't just visit NY and LA! There are so many other cities!\". We know that too, but I'm not gonna book a flight to St Louis on my first visit to America even if it is a wonderful place.",

If you're going south, Osaka or Kyoto is also a good place for a rest stop. But there's also a lot outside that, and I'm just suggesting people consider a few days in a unique place.\n\nOf course, it's your vacation, so do as you see fit :)  But you might be surprised. When I visited America, I wasn't impressed with NYC, but loved New Orleans.",

Then you can choose your own destinations and time table. When I used the JR pass we did day trips from Tokyo to fujisama and Nara, and it works in the city on the non-subway lines as well. I don't know what type of adventure you're hunting for, but the passes really make the long distances between Tokyo and the rest of the country much shorter and doable. They also serve 250\u00a5 beer on the trains and the katsu sandwiches were actually pretty good lmao. \n\nEDIT: There's also an app that lets you plan train route really easy, it costs like 2.99$USD and I cant remember the name but it helped a LOT with planning esp because it works on station wifi. I had a sim card for my global phone but my wife didn't so it was handy. \n",

Additionally, there's going to be a LOT more to do in your average Japanese mid-size city or area than a mid-size city in the US. For me, it makes more than enough sense to intentionally fit less-traveled places in your itinerary. If you enjoy these places even more than places on the beaten path (which has been my experience), then why not?",

            "comment": "I agree with the premise that there is loads to see outside of Kanto and Kansai, but I take issue with several points:\n\n&gt;I read an article recently about how Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka are heavily overtouristed, and the problem seems to be getting worse, fraying the nerves of both visitors and locals.\n\nThis depends completely on where specifically you're going and when you're doing it.  If you go to Kinkaku-ji in the afternoon during a busy tourist season, then of course it's going to be packed.  But if you walk just down the road to Kitanotenmangu or Daitoku-ji--arguably much more beautiful sights--you might have the place practically to yourself.  There are so many places in both Kanto and Kansai that get relatively small numbers of tourists, are easily accessible, and are completely worth seeing.  There's no reason to go half-way across the country just to avoid tourists.\n\n&gt;I hope people could consider getting off the beaten tourist path a bit and going outside the \"golden highway\" between Tokyo and Osaka.\n\nThe reason why the Kanto+Kansai itinerary makes so much sense for first and even second or third time visitors is not just because they contain the most famous sights.  It's also because they offer an extremely high concentration of varied activities within relatively easy transit distance.  You could pretty easily hunker down in Kyoto and fill 10+ full days, doing the city and some day trips, and have a very full itinerary.  It's not easy to make the same case for someplace like Kanazawa (wonderful though it is).  This is especially important for people planning a first trip or traveling with a group (e.g., family), since moving from place to place in quick succession can get really tiring really fast.\n\nAnother important consideration is transit time.  It's absolutely true that many small towns are fun to visit, but it's also really easy for people who are unfamiliar with traveling in rural Japan to severely underestimate the time it realistically takes to get around some of these places.  I've seen itineraries on here where people planned to traverse massive swaths of Tohoku in only 3 days, which is something that you simply cannot do.  So for anyone who's planning to go well off the Tokaido,  my advice would be to pick a region and stick to it.  Don't be thinking you're going to do Yamadera, Oga Peninsula, Kanazawa, and Shirakawa-go in 4 days.  Don't be in such a hurry to rush off the next place before you've even done a tiny fraction of what there is to see where you are.\n\n&gt;Day trips to Mt. Fuji are nice, but Mt. Aso in Kyushu (active volcano with huge, green caldera you can take a ropeway up to see), Mt. Hakodate in Southern Hokkaido (the view from the summit is the most stunning in the world at night), and Mt. Haku in Gifu, which is quiet yet beautiful.\n\nYeah, all of those things are nice.  The problem is that they're incredibly unrealistic unless you're planning to be spending at least several days (but more realistically, closer to a week or more) in those respective areas.  For first or second time visitors this is unlikely to be happening, and people who have traveled to Japan a lot are probably already considering options outside of Kansai and Kanto.",

I would *love* to show my friends some of the lesser-visited areas I've been to or explore some of those areas I have *not* been to yet, but ultimately, we only have 2 weeks to work with. My friends want to see the big things, like the Ghibli Museum, Harajuku, Kinkakuji, Nara, etc., and with only 2 weeks to cover all these things and still keep our sanity, we won't have time to run off and explore, say, Shikoku or Hokkaido.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right about transportation time. I think a lot of people from larger countries look at Japan and think, \"It's such a small country!\" but transportation time is definitely something to heavily consider when looking at more rural areas. I definitely came across places where the bus only came by twice in a day while I was in Shikoku, and a significant amount of the island still is not accessible by train. Add in the fact that English is *far* less prevalent in rural Japan and it can be quite a bit more involved and patience-testing compared to the usual Tokyo - Osaka - Kyoto route (not saying you can't explore rural Japan without knowing Japanese, but you should be prepared for a higher language barrier).",

Surely there are more than 5 things to do in the entire city, let alone the entire prefecture! In reality, Kochi is very rich in nature, boasting some of the cleanest rivers and best coastline in Japan. I strongly recommend visitors to branch out from the tourist path and go somewhere rural just for the sake of going somewhere rural. I guarantee you that it will be extremely rewarding.\n\nShimane/Tottori are also very very underrated places with a surprising amount of unique activities. But look beyond japan-guide.com! A great way to find overlooked destinations are the prefecture or city's tourism website, such as \n\nhttps://www.kankou-shimane.com/en/\n\nhttp://www.tottori-tour.jp/en/\n\nhttp://visitkochijapan.com/\n",

I have to say that my favorite place so far that I've visited here has been Hiroshima. It was really interesting and I had a great experience. The peace museum and memorial were fascinating. Personally, I thought the okonomiyaki was better than in Osaka (fight me) and there were some surrounding areas that were pretty cool, too. Like Miyajima island which was BEAUTIFUL and has the famous Itsukushima shrine (the shrine on water) as well as enough deer roaming around that it could easily rival Nara's deer park and some fascinating museums over in Kure if you're into navy stuff. \n\nIf you're a nature person, so far my favorite place has been Nikko, which is hard to travel around without a car but if you can rent one then it's honestly fantastic with tons of beautiful waterfalls and stunning views to be had. It also has a pretty cool shrine where you can hear a dragon's cry so there's that, too.\n\nFukuoka is also really amazing if you're a foodie. My husband is from there so I went to visit his family and they treated me to all kinds of great restaurants. Motsunabe was probably my favorite but they do some mean yakitori down there, too. And of course you absolutely have to have their specialty ramen. Delicious. Also if you come at the right time of the year, you should definitely go strawberry picking if you like that kind of thing. Their regional strawberries (amaou) are the best I've ever had in my life and getting them fresh from the field is the amazing.",

Lots to do, the people here are ace and the city is busy and vibrant, especially in Nagarekawa and Yokugawa (there is a loop bus now, which gets you from the station to Hatchobori/Nagerekawa, in about 5 minutes - 180yen). There are museums, good shopping, a Pokemon Centre, the peace park, Miyajima, and the castle. If you come to Hiroshima for the first time, no doubt you would want to find out about the a-bomb, and the museum is great, but also you are able to book guided tours with volunteers who will take you all around, showing you out of the way (and often missed), important historical sites. The tours are available in English, and all of the volunteers do a very intensive course. It is really interesting, my wife was a volunteer and she took me round for practice. Even though I have lived here for ages, I still found it fascinating.   \n\nAlso, the food is amazing. I absolutely recommend an oyster restaurant in the Hondori area called Ekohiiki - \u3048\u3053\u8d14\u5c53 - Oysters are their speciality, but they also do a load of fish dishes which are incredible. I often go there for lunch with my wife (who is very particular), and it is cheap and delicious, the best I have had in Hiroshima by a mile. I often see tourists stop outside and ponder whether to go in, but it does look a little daunting (all Japanese), from the outside. My tip is that if you are near it, go for it. One downside is the music, which is usually Mariah Carey!!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Felt a little rushed and tiring and in all honesty Sapporo felt a bit meh and felt like there wasn't too much going on in December. Still nice to say I visited though! \n\nThe rest such as Mount Usu/Lake Toya felt lovely in the snow, having a blizzard on the mountain was pretty mad but hildarious nonetheless.\n\nHakodate was lovely for Christmas Eve/Day. Funny visiting the Christmas themed Lucky Pierrot for a cheeseburger on Christmas eve... then the next day exploring Hakodate, eating seafood, hanging around the docks and going up the mountains.\n\nAomori is another quick stop off for a few visits for food, apples, the giant buddha if you can fit it in along with Nebuta Wa Rasse to see all the giant paper floats and play some of the giant taiko drums.\n\nMorioka was my next stop mainly for an Ryokan, not 100% necessary but a chill out evening.\n\nTiny detour from Morioka can be Kakunodate for a Samurai Town, in blizzard snow it was very quiet and many Samurai houses were closed but of what was still open gave beautiful views of the way Samurai families lived.\n\nThen back on the Shinkansen to Sendai for a few days as a home base with trips to Yamadera and a big climb up some cliffs for another beautiful view. Follow that with exploring a bit of Sendai overnight and a trip to Matsushima to visit one of Japan's top ranked most scenic places to visit. Visit some of the temples to learn more about Masamune Date and how he and his wife lived.\n\nThen make your way back to Tokyo for the usual business and the usual tourist bits/shopping.\n\nQuick waffle of text to give a run down of what could be done if you plan to go north. Rushed over 7 days and if you can break it down over a few extra days you could have an even more amazing experience I reckon. So many places to visit other than the tourist hub of Tokyo and next time I visit I reckon I'll have to figure out how to visit all of the more obscure places by train.",

I could get lost in there for days and not get tired of it. I also say, beyond Universal Studios and Disneyland or Disney Sea because Japan has so much more to offer than just those.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you have a link of the article? I'd love to post it in my local travel group on Facebook to make the other travelers aware.",

It's the oldest road in Japan, documented in the Nihon Shoki, which ancient farmers used to bring their produce to the capitals of Asuka and later Nara. \n\nIt's a long, winding path through persimmon orchards, bamboo groves, rice paddies, kofun, and forests, and the whole place looks like a Ghibli movie. It's lined by dozens of little roadside stalls selling as much produce as you could possibly want, super fresh and super cheap. The south half of it runs between two incredible shrines: Oomiwa Jinja (by some accounts, the oldest shrine in the country) and Isonokami Jingu (which, AIUI, was very important in Japanese history between the third and fifth centuries).\n\nSeriously couldn't recommend it more.

Those cities are good places to safely (and comfortably) get accustomed to and comfortable with the ins and outs of how things work in Japan before going out and exploring the less popular attractions where they probably will have little help or direction.",

Takayama, Kanazawa, and Shirakawa-Go especially. I find these to be the most interesting places I've been to in Japan, and we barely saw foreign tourists while we were there (there were a lot of domestic tourists too!)\n\nI also think Kyushu doesn't get enough love. I find Nagasaki super fascinating, both because of how they remember their atomic history, but also in general, Nagasaki has a very distinct and (I think) unique feel compared to the rest of Japan, with its very obvious European and Chinese influences that can't be found elsewhere. After all, they were for a time the only window of Japan to the rest of the world.\n\nYou're absolutely right though. There's so much to see beyond Kansai and Kanto!",

With far more Chinese/Korean tourists than westerners. I could see this being very difficult for anyone with anxiety or such.\n\nWhatever you decide, I do hope you enjoy your trip! If you want, come back and post a trip report; it could be helpful for others in similar circumstances :)",

Id even go so far as to say Tamana\u2019s Rengein temple is the equal of any Kyoto super attraction, with almost no guests and a gob-smacking view of the autumn leaves from the top of the pagoda. ",

Features a lot of buildings from ca 1850-1950 and well don't forget to take off your shoes ;) \n\n2nd in Osaka there is the Minoh waterfall makes for a nice walk in the mountain, almost no western tourists and also lots of old buildings. With the beauty of fall it was even better with all the colours.\n\nFor a first time visit i really do recommend the cities like Tokyo, Osaka and such. They make up for a good one week stay.\n\nIn august this year i go for the 4th time and for 2 weeks and across maybe a quarter of the country\n\nAnd i'm really fxxking exited about this trip allready. \ud83d\ude02\n",

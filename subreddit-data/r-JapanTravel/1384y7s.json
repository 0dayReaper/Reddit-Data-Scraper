I am getting stuck trying to find any information on how to get from Oze National Park (Oshimizu entrance) to Nikko by bus. \n\nI realise this is a very specific question but I'm hoping someone can help!\n\nMany thanks!",

If you are going outside of this period there won't be any transport to Nikko.\n\nIf you're going between now and June 3rd, if you don't want to completely backtrack the only option would be going to Numayamatoge, so you could travel to Aizu and from there take a train down to Nikko, but I expect that will take a long time.\n\nGood luck!",

It's possible this one of them.\n\nMake sure you know when the trains run between Aizu and Nikko.  I know they do run, just only so often.    Aizu is supposed to be a great place to visit though.  I keep having it on my itinerary and then cutting it last minute.",

            "comment": "Hi !\n\nTo get Oshimizu entrance, you can ride a bus from Shinjuku.\nTo move to Nikko, there is a bus line from Kamata(\u938c\u7530) to Yumoto-onsen(\u6e6f\u5143\u6e29\u6cc9). Those 2 bus lines are seasonal.\nAfter you get to Yumoto-onsen, you can also travel to lake Chuzenji, Toshogu shrine, or Nikko station by another bus.\n\nhttps://kan-etsu.net/en/publics/index/17/smartssmartssmartssmartssmarts\nhttps://kan-etsu.net/en/publics/index/22/\nhttps://www.tobu-bus.com/en/nikko/",

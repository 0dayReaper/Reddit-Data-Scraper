    "postText": "Hey everyone, looking to see if my *loosely* planned itinerary is realistic, and for recommendations. We\u2019re two pretty geeky guys in our 20\u2019s who are into the whole video game/anime thing, particularly enormous fans of Pok\u00e9mon. We also really enjoy cultural experiences, and aren\u2019t just going for the otaku culture. However, remember that we\u2019re also in our 20\u2019s and like to go to bars and such at night! We\u2019ll also have the JR train pass. \n\nMay 29: Fly from New York to Haneda, direct flight. \n\nMay 30: Land at Haneda Airport at 4:45 AM, take monorail into Tokyo, and then to our hotel in Shinjuku. We\u2019re likely gonna be enormously tired, so we\u2019ll probably just walk around a little bit and take it super easy. \n\nMay 31: Akihabara\n\n\nSuper Potato Store, multiple arcades such as Hey Taito and Gigi Akihabara 1. Also general exploration and shopping here. Later in the day we\u2019ll head over and check out Sens\u014d-Ji in Asakusa and maybe walk around Amaya Yokocho Market. \n\nJune 1: Shibuya in day, Shinjuku at night\n\n\nDuring the day we\u2019ll go to Harajuku to visit Takeshita Street, and visit the Nintendo store. Maybe also stop at Meiji Shrine. At night we\u2019ll go to Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocho for food and drinks in Shinjuku. \n\nJune 2: Chuo and Ginza\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon center DX, maybe Tsukiji Market (although I heard it\u2019s overcrowded). In Ginza we\u2019ll visit restaurants under Yurakucho train station. Maybe the art aquarium museum? At night we\u2019ll visit Kabukicho for drinks since it\u2019s one train stop away from our hotel. \n\nJune 3: Kamakura\n\n\nWake up early, take train to Kamakura. Going here is important to me b/c a book I read was based here. We\u2019ll visit the Buddha statue and use the Daibutsu Hiking Trail. Also temples and shrines like Hasedera Temple and Hachimangu Shrine. \n\nJune 4: Nakasendo Trail, stay in Nagoya\n\n\nFrom Kamakura, travel to Nakasendo trail via a stop in Nakatsugawa and visit Magome and Tsumago. Afterwards, take train to Nagoya to stay the night. \n\nJune 5: Kyoto\n\n\nDay in central Kyoto. Visit Nishiki Market, Samurai and Ninja Museum, Pontocho for food, Nijo Castle. \n\nJune 6: Kyoto\n\n\nEastern Kyoto. Visit Kiyomizudera, Higashiyama, Gion. \n\nJune 7: Kyoto\n\n\nNorthern and Western Kyoto. Visit Kinkakuji, Arashiyama, Monkey Park, Saga-Toriimoto Preserved streets\n\nJune 8: Kyoto -&gt; Nara\n\n\nEarly in the morning visit Fushimi Inari if we want (although I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s crazy overcrowded). Then go to Nara. Visit Nara Park, Todaiji Temple, Horyuji Temple. Also just general walking around and seeing where the streets take us. \n\nJune 9: Nara -&gt; Osaka\n\n\nTake train to Osaka. Walk around Minami Namba, Shinsekai, Kuromon market, Dotonbori, grab drinks at night. We don\u2019t really want to stay in Osaka too long because it gives the city-like vibes that Tokyo already satisfied, so we\u2019re kind of speedrunning it. \n\nJune 10: Osaka -&gt; Kinosaki Onsen\n\n\nTravel to Kinosaki Onsen. Relax in Onsen and stay in a ryokan. \n\nJune 11: Kinosaki Onsen -&gt; Kurashiki\n\n\nTravel a couple hours by train to Kurashiki in Okayama. A friend of mine told me that it was unbelievable there so I\u2019m itching to see what he was talking about. The canals look cool. \n\nJune 12: Kurashiki -&gt; Matsuyama\n\n\nTake 3 hour train ride in morning to Matsuyama in Ehime. Walk around, visit Matsuyama Castle, Dogo Onsen. \n\nJune 13: Matsuyama -&gt; Beppu\n\n\nTake ferry to Beppu from Matsuyama. Enjoy the warm baths, stay in ryokan. Pretty simple day (as long as the ferry plan cooperates). \n\nJune 14: Beppu -&gt; Fukuoka\n\n\nNo particular plans, visit the food stalls and walk around the area by the river. Maybe visit some shrines. \n\nJune 15: Fukuoka -&gt; Tokyo -&gt; New York\n\n\nIn the morning, take plane from Fukuoka airport to Haneda for ~$100 through JAL. Land in Haneda then walk to our terminal for our flight. The flight is at like 6 in the evening, so an early flight should do us fine. \n\nThanks for any help or suggestions anyone can provide!",

            "comment": "No Pokemon center in Ikebukuro Sunshine? It's the flagship. Shibuya mewtwo as well.\n\nThe later half of the iterinary feel a bit rough in term of taking the luggage around. A lot of day trips and lodging switch can be a hassle.\n\nInstead of Kyoto to Nara then to Osaka, what about going straight to Osaka and spend two nights to avoid switching? Do Osaka that day, and a day trip to Nara. There is a Pokemon Center in Osaka Umeda too. \n\nFukuoka flight back to Tokyo and more flight feel like a wasted potential. What about splitting your Tokyo days into two - and allocate it towards the end of the trip? Like at the beginning you stay in west side of Tokyo, and on the way back home you spend it in east side of Tokyo. You can save up some transportation time that way.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the great advice! I didn\u2019t realize there were other Pok\u00e9mon stops! The good news about our trip is we aren\u2019t taking luggage. I think we\u2019re just gonna pack a couple days worth of clothes in a hiking backpack, and just wash them as needed. We kind of want the second half of the trip to be pretty spontaneous, and go to a lot of non-touristy spots. I also like the Osaka idea. I think that makes a ton of sense for us. I like the Tokyo idea for the end. The only problem is that we already booked our hotel in Tokyo, so at this point we can\u2019t really divert. We also really liked the idea of landing at the airport we\u2019re going home from so we don\u2019t really need to worry about taking the Shinkansen all the way back to Tokyo if we\u2019re all the way on the island of Kyushu.",

But if it is just hiking bags, that makes sense.\n\nSome more things to suggest: \nShinjuku / Akiba: consider Kurand sake market. For 3600 yen, it is hundreds of sake, shochu, and fruit liquor, all you can drink. It's great especially if you don't speak a whole lot of Japanese and don't know what to order in Izakayas. You can bring food in too. \n\nKamakura: consider a night out in Enoshima. It is touristy, but local seafood and great scenery looking at the ocean at night.\n\nKyoto: Fushimi is a sake brewery district in Kyoto. If you want some alcohol and food at night, Fushimi Sakagura Kouji can be a good choice.\n\nRyokan: there is nothing spontaneous about ryokan. They can be fully booked months in advance. They might force you to show up at a certain hour for dinner. Those days are going to be strict to the schedule - can't afford to take breaks. But maybe Dogo is different - I haven't been there so I can't comment on it.\n\nHow long do you have between the two connecting flights? Haneda Airport Garden literally just opened and looks pretty good as a relax spot.",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone! I\u2019m quite torn between these two destinations. I\u2019m asking early because I want to book a good onsen as early as possible. \n\nTo give context, It will be my first time to visit Japan in November. I will also be going alone. I will be staying in Fukuoka. \n\nI only heard good things regarding onsens so I want to spend a day or two trying out onsens. Staying one night at a good onsen that has a beautiful public and private baths. Preferably, a solo traveler friendly place. (Some places doesn\u2019t accept solo traveler for staying the night)\n\nFirst, I was thinking of Yufuin because I want to try the limited express train from Hakata, the various food, Kirin lake, scenic views there during autumn and onsens.\n\nBut I got interested in Kurokawa onsen. I find it pretty unique and it seems like it would be good during Autumn. I also heard great things about the onsens there. The food around the area is pretty limited so it won\u2019t be hard to decide where to eat.\n\nHere\u2019s a thought, can I visit Kurokawa onsen and stay the night then go to Yufuin the next day? Or just do Yufuin in another day?\n\nAnother thing to know is that I\u2019m planning to purchase the JR pass and I\u2019m not sure whether kurokawa onsen is covered by that. \n\nFor those who have been to both, what do you prefer and why?\n\nThank you!",

I'm starting in Kumamoto and will be taking the Kyushu Odan Bus line to Kurokawa onsen ([https://kyushubusbooking.com/highway-bus/kyushu-odan-bus/](https://kyushubusbooking.com/highway-bus/kyushu-odan-bus/)).\n\nI think there it may be possible to take from a bus from Fukuoka as well([https://kyushubusbooking.com/highway-bus/fukuoka-kurokawa/](https://kyushubusbooking.com/highway-bus/fukuoka-kurokawa/)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same line also goes to the Yufuin bus station which is what I will be using the next day. I then plan to take the limited express train from Yufuin to Fukuoka  ([https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/yufuin\\_no\\_mori.html](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/yufuin_no_mori.html)). My understanding is that the JR rail pass/Kyushu regional pass covers the limited trains, but not the Kyushu Odan Bus Line.",

It's smaller, much more scenic, has some truly amazing onsen/rotenburo, and is one of the nicest onsen towns in the whole country. It could be more expensive than Yufuin depending on where you stay, and I would try to stay in the center of town so you can just walk everywhere. Fuji-ya was a fine place and not too expensive, and Oyado Noshiyu is stunning but pricey).   \n\n\nYou can catch a bus from Hakata JR station in Fukuoka which is an easy ride, but not covered by the JR pass. The bus only runs a few times a day, so I would spend a night in Fukuoka, then catch the morning bus to Kurokawa so you have time to spend the day there and onsen hop a bit. When in Kurokawa, you have to go to Yamamizuki (its a \\~5m bus ride from central kurokawa), and then I really like Ikoi, Yamabiko, and Sanga (also you could stay at any of these three).\n\nYou could also go to Yufuin by train, stay the night, then do another night in Kurokawa which would be cool too.",

The fall is also an amazing time to go there, and onsen towns are always better when its cold outside.",

Kurukawa has tourists but since it\u2019s smaller and more high end I thought it was a better vibe-most people are staying at a ryokan and you can buy a pass to visit 3 other ryokan onsens and everyone walks around in the ryokan yukatas (if they are still doing that). Lunch options are more limited but there\u2019s still places to eat and make sure your ryokan stay comes with breakfast and dinner!\n\nKurokawa also has a lot of outdoor (rotenboro) onsens that were so relaxing. Looking out on a stream or sitting in a cave. I would make the effort to go more off the tourist path!",

I want to buy ghibli stuff cause I am a fan. Aside from that, I like the scenic views there too especially I will be there in Autumn.\n\nBut will also do Kurokawa onsen. I just don\u2019t know when is the best time for it. Are the food souvenirs there worth it? Especially the cheesecake? My family is a fan and I if want to bring it home, I need to schedule it by Nov 20 or so.\n\nThank you!",

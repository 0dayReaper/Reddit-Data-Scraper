    "postText": "Family of 4 including two 7-year olds.\n\nFirst time in Japan and very little / no Japanese spoken.\n\nWe are most interested in modern and traditional culture, food, kid-friendly amusement parks and games, outdoors activities like hiking or boating.\n\nI am planning on train station and dept stores being our best friend for lunch and dinner, and konbini our friend for breakfast.\n\nI prefer to underplan and travel slowly, minimizing intercity transfers, and taking into account kids' unpredictability and need for frequent breaks / playgrounds etc.\n\nOur kids are pretty game for most things as long as there are sweets or souvenirs involved in some fashion, lol.\n\nI've bolded crucial or booked activities, and italicized lodging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Our first full day in Japan is in Kyoto on a Sunday. We are staying in Gion. What would be recommended given the busy tourist day AND that we will likely be awake early?\n2. I'm not convinced Arashiyama is worth the 45 minute transit time from Gion for a family with kids. Monkeys and renting a rowboat would be fun - but e.g. more shrines and temples and bamboo forest seems not noteworthy vs. Higashiyama sites.\n3. Disneyland vs DisneySea? We only have time for one. Or maybe neither! We are Disney \"agnostics\" - have never been to a Disney park, no strong interest, and our kids have much more interest and allegiance to Pixar era movies, Frozen, etc., rather than Mickey and Minnie.\n4. Are there any kid-friendly ways to view traditional Japanese sports or performance art? Kabuki? Sumo? Bunraku?\n\n# Kyoto\n\n5/27\n\n* Arrive KIX from USA in afternoon\n* Get ICOCA\n* Haruka to Kyoto Station\n* *Check in to machiya in Gion*\n\n5/28\n\n* Anticipate being up early\n* Wander southern Higashiyama district if up very early\n* Nishiki Market area lunch\n* \"Maikoya\" facility for a sweets class or origami class or similar\n\n5/29\n\n* **Toei Eigamura Studio** \\- kid friendly \"ninja\" activities and dress-up\n* Nanzen-ji and Higashiyama sights north of here\n\n5/30\n\n* Osaka daytrip\n* **Kaiyukan Osaka Aquarium**\n* **Orix Buffaloes game @ 18:00**\n* Train back to Kyoto\n\n5/31\n\n* **Fushimi Inari walk and hike (to the top)**\n\n6/1\n\n* **Nara daytrip**\n* Splurge-y dinner, possibly at the Ritz Carlton\n\n# Kawaguchiko\n\n6/2\n\n* Leave Kyoto by shinkansen to Nagoya, local train to Hongo Station\n* Pick up rental car from Toyota Hongo Station\n* **Ghibli Park @ 12:00**\n* Drive to Lake Kawaguchiko area\n* *Stay at Kawaguchiko Country Cottage Ban*\n\n6/3\n\n* Chureito Pagoda\n* Easy hiking and caves: wind cave thru forest to ice cave and back, \\~2mi\n* Time permitting, possibly check out Lake Shoji, specifically Tatego-hama beach\n* *Stay at Kawaguchiko Country Cottage Ban*\n\n6/4\n\n* Ide Sake Brewery Tour\n* Fuji Panoramic Ropeway\n* Drive to Hakone\n* *Stay at Hakone Airu onsen ryokan*\n\n# Hakone\n\n6/5\n\n* **Hakone Loop starting in Hakone-Yumoto**\n\n6/6\n\n* Check out of ryokan\n* Yunessun baths/pool complex\n* Drop off rental car at Odawara Station\n* Shinkansen to Tokyo\n* Ninja Akasaka dinner\n* *Stay at Mimaru Akasaka*\n\n# Tokyo\n\n6/7\n\n* Harajuku and Shibuya walk, shop, explore\n* Cat cafe\n* **Shibuya Sky @ dusk**\n\n6/8\n\n* **One of the Disney parks**\n\n6/9\n\n* **Teamlab Planets @ 09:00**\n* Tsukiji outer market for lunch\n* **Owl Cafe Fukurou @ 15:00**\n* Akasaka/Roppongi area for Robot Park and easy dinner\n\n6/10\n\n* Ueno for park, shopping, swan boat rental, possibly Science/Nature Museum or Hana-Yashiki Amusement Park\n* ?Arashio sumo stable if open\n* Ferry to Odaiba\n* Miraikan vs arcade\n* Dinner\n* **Unicorn Gundam at dark**\n\n6/11\n\n* &lt;unplanned day likely to be in Shinjuku or Shibuya or Ikebukuro for shopping, exploring, and eating&gt;\n\n6/12\n\n* Last minute souvenir shopping\n* Afternoon flight back to USA",

            "comment": "Your itinerary looks decently planned out. End of may shouldn\u2019t be too busy, but it may start getting a little warm\n\n1 - the popular temples such as kiyomizudera will get busy/crowded. A good early morning option nearby is fushimi inari as there are no \u201copen\u201d hours there. Not sure what your family is into but there are some places in Kyoto such as the train museum and aquarium that are a little less traditionally seen in tourist itineraries. They weren\u2019t very busy when I went\n\n2 - I personally really like arashiyama. It\u2019s a pretty area with a bamboo grove and the monkey park is a unique experience. However the monkey park is a fairly long hike uphill about 20-30 minutes and not sure how your 7 year olds would fare on that\n\n3 - definitely Disney sea. Disneyland is the traditional Disney and rides that you can see in California, etc. disney sea is unique to Japan\n\n4 - sorry hopefully someone else can address this one",

            "comment": "On your first day in Kyoto, I would head to Kiyomizudera as early as possible. They open at 6 am. I took a cab for under $10, but if you are close you may want to just walk over. Be sure to exit out through the cemetery if you want to avoid the crowds that will have formed by the time you are leaving. By the time you are done, more shops and restaurants should be open.

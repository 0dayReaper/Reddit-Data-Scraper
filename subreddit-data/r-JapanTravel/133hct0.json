    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am planning a solo trip to Japan from August 2nd to 25-26th and I am looking for some advice on how to spend my time in the country.\n\n**Aug 2-4th:**\n\nI planned to start my journey in Komoro, where I will be staying with a guest family in an old-style Ryokan for three days to unwind and get ready for the rest of my trip. During the three days in Komoro, I plan to take a day trip to Nagano, but I am open to other suggestions for things to do in the area.\n\nNote: This is still optional, so if anybody has a good suggestion to stay in a mountain area to really wind down for 3 days I am all ears.\n\n**5th: ???**\n\nAfter Komoro, I will have one day to spend one night between Komoro and Kyoto. If you have any recommendations for places to visit or things to do would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis will be Saturday the 5th of August. Naniwa Yodogawa Fireworks Festival comes to mind or the festival held in Kanazawa. Preferably the place would be accessible by Shinkansen and midway from Komoro and Kyoto.\n\n**6t-7th: Kyoto**\n\nKyoto. Visit the Kyoto Pottery Festival, Manga Museum, and Possibly do some shopping for artisan things (Shigeharu Knives come to mind as other crafts of Kyoto)\n\n**8th-10th: Fukuoka**\n\nOn August 9th I plan to participate at a international sports event with my team so I will be arriving on the 8th, registering, checking out the city in the even, competing on the 9th, and leaving on the 10th. Fukuoka I dont really have any idea what I want to see yet.\n\n**10th-15th: ????**\n\nHere I would like to ask for suggestions Ideally I would prefer if I can spend 4 nights somewhere that is a little bit off beat but has a lot to offer.\n\n* Visit the Sentonakai National Park area. Imabari and Takamatsu come to mind.\n* Head south to Kumamoto and Kagoshima, and skip the next part in Kyoto. My fear of going to far south is that it is going to take half a day just to come back to Kyoto area.\n* Fly to Sapporo and completely change the plans for 10-22th focusing on the Northern part of Japan.\n\n**15-16-17th: Kyoto**\n\nOn the 10th I intend to leave Fukuoka, I don't have much planned, other than potentially visiting Kyoto again on August 15th and 16th for the market and festival, and maybe a Ikebana course.\n\nI still haven't seen Osaka so I am contemplating a day trip there as well during this time. What I have seen before was Kifune, Uji, Nara, of which I would most like to see Uji again.\n\n**17th-22: 2 Days Takayama, 3 Days Gifu Area**\n\n**TBD.**\n\n**22-26th (Late evening:) Tokyo**\n\nOn August 22st, I will be arriving in Tokyo, where I plan to spend 3-4 days exploring the city / doing shopping / Museums I previously skipped.\n\nSince I have already done most of the major touristy stuff in Tokyo and Kyoto, I am really looking for hidden gems and off-beat experiences during my trip. Any suggestions for unique experiences, local restaurants, or other must-see places would be greatly appreciated.",

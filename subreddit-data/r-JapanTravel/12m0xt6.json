    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019ll be travelling to Fukuoka soon and I really want to visit Itoshima and go to the following places\n\n\u2022 Sakurai Futamigaura\n\u2022 Totoro Forest\n\nHow difficult is it if I\u2019m using public transportation to go around Itoshima? I\u2019ll be coming from Hakata and I saw in myroute app that they have a pass that I can purchase but I\u2019m having a hard time figuring the bus routes in the area. Is there any app that I can use? I\u2019ve been trying google maps but it doesn\u2019t show the local bus route in the area. \n\n\nI also have a question with IC card. Do I have to return it before leaving Fukuoka? If I can keep it, how long is it\u2019s validity?\n\n\nThank you for your help.",

Just catch the train to Imajuku station and take the bus. Takes about 90 mins from Hakata station, and the bus stops right outside the stones area. You can use an IC card to pay. And when you leave you just keep your IC card, it's yours. You can get a new one when you return to Japan next time.",

    "postText": "If you are planning to visit Kyoto you have to go to Okonomiyaki Katsu restaurant (you can find it on TripAdvisor). It is located at 1-4 Ryoanji Saigucho, Ukyo, Kyoto 616-8011. There are 3 dishes. First is vegetable pancake with okonomi-yaki sauce (you can also add some additional ingredients). Second dish is fried noodle with okonami-Yaki sauce and the last one is okonomiyaki topped with Yalu-soba and fried together. This restaurant isn\u2019t big there are only 5 seats. Sometimes you need too wait 1 hour for seat. Anyway staff is very polite, food is excellent and value is great. All you need to do is visit this place",

Dishes with ingredients from all over Japan are intricately designed an often make use of traditional Japanese porcelain.\n\nThe restaurant is located at 58, Susukinobaba-cho, Saga Tenryuji, Ukyo-ku, Kyoto. The price is between\u00a0\u00a540,000 and \u00a560,000. It's not a cheap restaurant but it has an extraordinary quality. That's why it's a Michelin Star Restaurant.\u00a0",

I'd definitely give up the $100 meals for those cool experiences any day.",

    "postText": "[This Tokyo coffee guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/eujk0v/an_ongoing_tokyo_coffee_guide/) by /u/ramenporn has inspired me to create one for Kyoto. I originally posted this on /r/Coffee and /u/ramenporn suggested I post it here as well for you guys to see. Seeing as Kyoto is one of the main stops of the vast majority of tourists visiting Japan, I think this guide should be of use for those looking for good coffee during their trips.\n\nUntil recently, I lived in Japan. Shiga prefecture to be precise, which borders Kyoto prefecture. I would frequently go down to Kyoto during my weekends for sightseeing and coffee drinking. My appreciation for speciality coffee really matured whilst I was living in Japan. I had started my journey into speciality coffee whilst I was a final year university student, and after graduation I moved to Japan. Having a good income for the first time allowed me to be try more expensive beans, and Kyoto was a great place to do that.\n\nSo, my guide won't be as in depth as u/ramenporn's Tokyo one. I'm mostly running off of memories that are a couple of years old, but I'll try my best to provide some useful information for all of you. Any prices I give might no longer be correct due to the recent increase in sales tax from 8% to 10%. Sorry if that is the case.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Weekenders Coffee**  \n\n* [Location](https://goo.gl/maps/mt7PcdM3ARTyromJ7)\n* **English level:** Very high, they are able to talk you through the coffees and make recommendations in perfect English.\n* **Closed days:** Every Wednesday. Make sure to check for public holidays as well.\n\nWeekenders Coffee is easily one of my favourite coffee shops in Japan, and is likely already known by most of you. Located near Nishiki Market, it can be found in the back of a car park, which makes it easy to walk past. Make sure you look carefully as there is no obvious signage pointing it out. It's a beautiful two storey building with a pleasant little garden and some small trees. It is a small shop, with only a bench outside for seating. \n\nThey have several different beans available for pour over and purchase, as well as espresso based drinks. The variety of beans on offer is very good, usually roasted light to medium with the occasional dark, usually 6 available to choose from. They sometimes have special coffees available as well, such as Geishas, which cost more for a cup. If I remember correctly, a regular pourover cost 420 yen. Special pourovers were a lot more. Of note, my dad mentioned that he wanted a flat white, which wasn't on the menu, but they happily offered to make one. So it's worth asking if they can do something that isn't on menu. Within reason, of course.\n\nI love this coffee shop because it is so consistently great. Every coffee I had from there was delicious! And I always made sure to buy beans to take home. I sometimes went out of my way to get a coffee from here. My only complaint, and a small one, is the lack of seating. This isn't an issue at all when the weather is nice. But when it's raining or snowing, having to huddle in the small inside area can make things very cramped. Aside from that though, this is a must visit for anyone who likes speciality coffee. Add it to your lists now!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kurasu** \n\n* **Locations:** [Near Kyoto Station](https://goo.gl/maps/wPisXjWi8kRaDsTQ7) and [near Fushimi Inari](https://g.page/kurasu-fushimi-inari?share)\n* **English level:** Very high. The majority of their baristas have spent time living and working in Australia or New Zealand as baristas. Everyone I spoke to there had amazing English.\n* **Closed days:** None, but check for public holidays.\n\nKurasu is another heavy hitter in the Kyoto speciality coffee scene. They initially had just the location near Kyoto Station, but now have a location near Fushimi Inari. I haven't been to the one near Fushimi Inari, but the one near Kyoto Station is very nice. Despite being small, it's relatively spacious inside with a good amount of natural light coming in. The staff are incredibly friendly and speak amazing English. I had a great conversation with one of the baristas about the nuances of giving thanks in Japanese. That was incredibly helpful for my Japanese.\n\nWhen I first visited them in October 2017, they were using beans from other roasters within Japan. Sometime around early 2018, they started roasting their own beans and now the mostly use them, with occasional guest roasters available. For pour over, they have four beans on offer and a good variety of African, Asian and South American. The roasts tend to be in the light to medium range. I had a delicious coffee Myanmar, and equally delicious Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. They also have a good range of espresso drinks. I highly recommend their mocha, they use a really rich ganache for the chocolate part which results in a really delicious drink. All of the beans they have available for pour over can also be purchased. A pourover cost around 450 yen if I remember correctly.\n\nI really fell in love with Kurasu once they started roasting their own beans. Whoever their roaster is is doing an amazing job. Add in the super friendly staff and the convenient location near Kyoto Station, it's an easy winner. If you have to catch a train from Kyoto Station at any point, give yourself some extra time to get a coffee from Kurasu. You won't regret it! Or check out their Fushimi Inari store if you're in that area.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**% Arabica** \n\n* **Locations:** [Higashiyama](https://goo.gl/maps/ru65g5KTQx3RqRaT6), [Arashiyama](https://goo.gl/maps/YvTzyv4f9PhwJmkW7) and [Fuji Daimaru department store](https://goo.gl/maps/QxP6kernzsMfmZoh6)\n* **English level:** Very high. \n* **Closed days:** None, but check for public holidays.\n\n% Arabica is well known outside the speciality coffee scene. This will immediately become apparent when you see the massive lines outside their Higashiyama and Arashiyama stores. And all the people taking Instagram pictures showing off the logo. I have had a latte from both the Arashiyama and Fuji Daimaru stores and they were ok. Nothing particular special. Definitely not worth queueing up for 30-40 minutes like I did outside the Arashiyama store. Though at least there you have a nice view of the mountain and Togetsu-Kyou Bridge. \n\nThey don't sell pour overs or any filter coffee from what I remember, only espresso based drinks. When the shops are this busy, it's understandable that they don't have time to do pourovers. I think a latte was 500 yen.\n\nYou can probably tell that I'm not a huge fan of these stores nor the coffee they sell. I think they are extremely overhyped and due to how busy they get, the coffee isn't that special because they have to churn out cups quickly. However, they're the only decent coffee shop that I know of in Arashiyama. If you really want to try their coffee and don't care where you have it, go to the Fuji Daimaru store. I haven't seen massive queues there like you get at the other stores. Otherwise, don't bother. There are much better coffee shops in Kyoto, and generally in the same areas.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kissamaster** \n\n* [Location](https://goo.gl/maps/CHWNbgiVKtXTZWLR9)\n* **English level:** OK. Menu pointing likely required though. \n* **Closed days:** Wednesday and Thursday. Also check for public holidays. \n\nKissamaster is located very near to Weekenders Coffee, and just off of the main shopping area in Kyoto. It is part of a boutique clothing store, and has a seperate entrance to the side for those who just want to have a drink. \n\nKissamaster is probably the most expensive of the coffee shops on this list. A pour over costs around 550-600 yen from what I remember. They sell a wide variety of drinks besides coffee, so good if you have people with you who don't drink cofee. Their beans are roasted by Weekenders Coffee, so it is very delicious. They have a couple of beans available for pour over depending on what Weekenders has available.\n\nYou might be wondering why I am talking about this place, if it sells coffee available elsewhere at a cheaper price. The garden. The seats in the coffee shop overlook a really beautiful and immaculately maintained Japanese style garden. It's a nice and quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of central Kyoto. It's worth paying more for that in my opinion. And you can easily sit down, which none of the other shops listed so far can guarantee.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Walden Woods Kyoto** \n\n* [Location](https://goo.gl/maps/ibfdp6sCRXTMKtsg9)\n* **English level:** Not much. Menu pointing will be needed.\n* **Closed days:** None, but check for public holidays. \n\nWalden Woods is an interesting place. It is in a reasonably large building with two floors. On the bottom floor they have the counter where you order, and behind that there is a large roaster, Probat I think. The top floor is very Instagrammy though. It's a square area with two tiered seating on the walls, with electric gas lamps lighting up the area. Oh, and a white tree in the middle decorated in fairy lights. The pictures on Google Maps will give you a good idea of what it's like.\n\nBut how's the coffee? They have a good range of espresso drinks available, and a couple of beans available for pour over. Filter beans were roasted medium to medium-dark. I went here twice and had a pour over both times. I can't remember what I had the first time, but the second time I had a coffee from Peru. Both times they were OK. Not bad, but not especially good either. Pretty standard coffee. Also, a pour over cost 500 yen, so on the more expensive side for Kyoto.\n\nI would only recommend Walden Woods if you want to go somewhere with an interesting aesthetic. I only went the second time because my girlfriend wanted to go. When sitting upstairs, be prepared for people taking a lot of photos. I saw what was pretty much an amateur photo shoot going on. Not what I want when I want to relax and drink coffee. The location isn't particularly convenient either, requiring a 15 minute ish walk form Kyoto Station. Stick to Kurasu if you're near the station.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Light Up Coffee Kyoto** \n\n* [Location](https://goo.gl/maps/Z6yrbxRT2zBTe1rp6)\n* **English level:** Good. They should understand your order perfectly fine.\n* **Closed days:** None, but check for public holidays. \n\nIf you're near Demachiyanagi Station and want a nice cup of coffee, this is the best place in the area. Light Up is actually based in Tokyo, and that's where their beans are roasted. The storefront doesn't stick out so keep your eyes peeled for it. The seating area confused me somewhat because it seems to be shared space with what appeared to be a children's engineering activity group. Maybe. I'm not sure, but it wasn't particularly peaceful which annoyed me. But that was beyond the control of the coffee shop.\n\nThe coffee here consists of espresso drinks and pour over or Aeropress depending on the bean you choose. When I went, they had two beans for filter, light to medium roast. I had a nice Colombian which was made with an Aeropress. I can't remember the price, but it wasn't expensive from what I remember, so probably around the 400-450 yen mark. I kind of liked the simplicity of this place. Only having two options was quite nice, some coffee shops in Japan can go a bit overboard with how many beans they offer. \n\nIf you go to this shop and the weather is nice, I'd recommend taking your coffee to go and having it whilst chilling on the bank of the nearby Kamo River. This is especially nice in the summer. The coffee here is very nice, but case out the seating area when you get in to make sure if you want to sit in or take out. I think the children's group only ran on Saturdays anyway.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Clamp Coffee Sarasa**\n\n* [Location](https://goo.gl/maps/ckGPX51k65Gd9RLB6)\n* **English level:** Good. They should understand your order perfectly fine.\n* **Closed days:** Wednesday. Also check for public holidays. \n\nClamp Coffee Sarasa is a unique looking coffee shop. When you approach it, it's covered in ivy and it's easy to walk past. Inside is quite dark, even on a very sunny day like when I visited. It has a very rustic look, with their roaster on display and sacks of coffee stacked around it. Lots of bare wood, brick and concrete. I liked the atmosphere a lot.\n\nFor coffee, they offered the usual espresso drinks and a large number of coffee beans available for pour over. They offer beans ranging from light to dark roast. I had a medium roast Guatemalan, though it tasted more like a medium-dark roast to me. Still nice though. They also offer food, though I didn't look too closely at the menu.\n\nClamp Coffee Sarasa is located near Nijo Castle, so if you're in the area then it's worth checking out. There is also a shop next door which sells locally made home goods. One thing to pay attention to is that there are signs around the coffee shop asking you not to take pictures of other customers. If you want to take pictures, make sure it is done discreetly and only of your own food and drink.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mamebaco**\n\n* [Location](https://goo.gl/maps/jFY7Sfxyo1953FfA8)\n* **English level:** Very good, from the person doing the sampling anyway.\n* **Closed days:** None, but check for public holidays. \n\nSo, I haven't actually been to this coffee stand. They opened within the last few months I was in Japan and I didn't get around to going to their shop. However, I have tried their coffee. They were giving out free samples, freshly brewed, outside the Tokyu Hands in Kyoto one time. I happened to be walking past, and tried some. I tried a medium roasted Indian coffee, and a medium-light Colombian. Both were very nice. So if you want to try somewhere that's just sprung up within the last year, give them a look. Though the location isn't exactly near anywhere on the tourist trail, so you might have to go out of your way a little.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat was a lot more than I was expecting to type out. But I hope it was helpful for some of you who are looking to go to Kyoto and want to know where to go for good coffee. There are some coffee shops that I didn't mention here because I haven't visited them or tried their coffee, so have a look on Google and see if any places interest you.\n\nI have travelled to many places in Japan so I can give information on coffee shops in other less travelled parts of Japan if people are interested at all. Let me know.",

That's part of the experience!  Something like [this](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E3%82%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A72020%E3%80%90%E3%83%8F%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E7%89%88%E3%80%91C-Life%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B5%E3%83%92%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB-%E6%9C%9D%E6%97%A5%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E5%87%BA%E7%89%88/dp/4022782951/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;keywords=kyoto+cafe&amp;qid=1580171447&amp;sr=8-1).\n\nI recommend checking out Wright Cafe, filled with a lot of antiques for decorations.  And they used to have a little cat that wandered around.  Good friendly folks.\n\nAlso check out Cafe Rhinebeck.  Their coffee is just ok, but their pancakes are fantastic!  Good atmosphere, but staff are a little stiff and not friendly.",

The American branch of Ogawa is its own division and they don\u2019t really have to follow a lot of the standards that the Japan shops do - they roast a lot of their own coffee in-house, and they have their own style and branding.\n\nSince Ogawa Coffee is about 70 years old in Japan, they actually more resemble kissaten than they do the Boston one, but since opening the Boston one, I think they have been redesigning some of the Kyoto ones to have the same style as Boston\u2019s.\n\nThe coffee, in terms of roast quality, can be hit-or-miss (in Boston or Kyoto), but sometimes they roast something pretty good. Their latte art in the Kyoto shops is strong, though, just like their Boston shop.",

The coffee was very delicious as well!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n * [Flat White Coffee Factory Downtown](https://goo.gl/maps/X4Aj9msLggwZEsdU6)\n\nSleek and modern. They offer espresso drinks and filter, either V60 or Aeropress. They have a lot of beans on offer for filter. You choose via an iPad at the counter, and you can change the language to English. The beans are roasted on site. The baristas were very friendly, though spoke little English. One of them has competed at the Japan Aeropress Championship, so I recommend trying an aeropress from there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n * [Spark Coffee Roasters](https://goo.gl/maps/JpSMeFYHBjNKX9r78)\n\nA bit out of the way, but worth it. It was very quiet when I went. They have espresso drinks and filter. They had a couple of beans to choose from for filter. The beans are roasted on site, you can see the roasting room behind the counter. What was cool about this place is that they made my filter coffee using a Chemex, which was a first for me! Very nice and friendly staff, who I recall spoke good English.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHope that helps!",

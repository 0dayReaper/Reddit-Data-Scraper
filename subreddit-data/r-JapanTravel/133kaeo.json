    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nThis will be my fourth time in Japan, and my boyfriend's second. We've both done the Golden Route (or whatever Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka/Hiroshima is), and now looking for new experiences over two weeks. I'm not against hiring a car, so I'd love suggestions as to how to extend our adventures! I also speak okay Japanese, as I studied in high school and university.\n\nWe'll be travelling in early November -- a first for me. Last time we went was in summer and it sucked, I already live in a humid place already and I still struggled so hard!\n\nWe aren't set on what we do every day, so basically I just have bullet points of stuff we'd like to see or re-visit, since we missed a bit due to the heat last time, especially in Kyoto. We want to be a bit more relaxed, mostly wandering/exploring. This is not a rush and see everything trip.\n\n **Tokyo (yeah I've been there before but I'm obsessed)**\n\n4 nights (3 really as we'll land after 9pm and will more or less lose a day to jet lag/travel into Tokyo from Haneda).\n\n*Things to do:*\n\n* Akihabara\n* Nakano Broadway\n* teamLab Planets TOKYO\n* Miyashita Park, for food and shopping\n* [Vanilla gallery](https://www.instagram.com/vanillagallery_jp/) (I'm not into their current exhibition but interested to see what else they'll have much later this year, linked for fellow art lovers)\n* Studio Ghibli Museum?\n* One Piece Tower (Odaiba, or is it Skytree?). Boyfriend is a die hard One Piece fan\n\n**Nagano**\n\n2 nights\n\n*Things to do:*\n\n* Day trip to Matsumoto for Matsumoto Castle, Nawate/Nakamachi Street, and Matsumoto City Museum of Art\n* Day trip to monkeys at Jigokudani Snow Monkey Park (40 minute bus ride from Nagano, then a 25 minute hike)\n\n**Kyoto**\n\n3 nights\n\n*Things to do:*\n\n* Kinkakuji Temple, Arashiyama. Same day? Doable?\n* Kobe day trip; harbour promenade, sake tasting at the Kiku-Masamune Sake Brewery Museum, riding the Mosaic Ferris wheel for an impressive view, eating ramen, and shopping\n* Day trip to Universal Studios/Disney?\n\nFly to **Sapporo**\n\n3 nights\n\n*Things to do:*\n\n* Odori Park\n* Sapporo TV Tower Observation Deck\n* Sapporo Beer Museum\n* Mount Moiwa\n* Tanukikoji Shopping Arcade (also good for night-time fun)\n* Susukino\n* Sapporo City Maruyama Zoo?\n\nFinishg in **Tokyo**\n\nLast night. I want to buffer a day for flights to take off some stress, no plans.  \n\n\nIf you have day trip ideas that can be done via car from any of these cities, please let me know. We're most likely going to purchase the JR Pass ahead of the October cut-off, but I haven't run the numbers yet. We may not need it at all.\n\nAccommodation and flights (excluding domestic flights in Japan) are booked.",

            "comment": "theres a few well known things around Kyoto which usually get left behind on the 3-5 days people spend there before moving on\n\nand theres a few not so well known things as well\n\nI dont think I actually know any secret spots.\n\nSo...\n\nHave you been to, how about...\n\n- Kibune/Kurama: well known spot(s) but up into the north hills, usually people dont go there unless they have a reason to. Its well known for eating on the river (in summer), it serves a bit of a rest from the heat since its cooler than the city. You can take the train (and bus or walk) into either Kurama and take a railcar or hike up to Kurama-dera, then hike over the hill to Kibune and see Kifune-jinja - or the other way around without the railcar. There used to be an onsen in Kurama but it seems to not have survived corona. It may reopen though, so if you end up there make sure to at least check, nothing beats sitting in the onsen there after the hike\n\n- Amanohashidate / Kyoto by the sea: one of the 3 famous spots in Japan, about 3 hours train ride north of Kyoto. Its very pretty up there and you can spend a whole day\n\n- Kinosakionsen: also about 3 hours train ride from Kyoto, near Amanohashidate (but not close enough to consider them the same area), a town of 6 or 7 onsens and onsen-tera temple half way up the hill which you can hike to (or take a cable car)\n\n- the whole of lake biwake / shiga next to Kyoto. the west side has a small tori gate (shirahige) in the sea you can hike to or take a bike, you can even borrow a bike at a near train station. or further south you can explore otsu, which has a number of attractions going into the hills between Kyoto and Otsu. Speaking of the hills, that whole hill, or mountain, Hiezan is a cable car/hike dream. There is a temple up there (Enryaku-ji) more like 3 in 1, although I really got frustraded figuring out where everything is up there, the view and hike was spectacular  \ngoing up the west side of the lake, you can find a ferry to bring you to the island Chikubu with the hogonji temple on it.  \nthe east side of the lake has at least Hikone / Maibara. I have yet to explore more there too :)\n\n- also in north kyoto is ohara. a great area to explore with a number of temples and more local tourists\n\n- not really a secret but you can explore Uji, south of Kyoto, famous for tea and Byoidin\n\n- the area between Kinkakuji and arashiyama is often overlooked. highlights are ryoanji and ninna-ji although there is more if you walk the way and follow the signs\n\n- the whole area below arashiyama (look for Saiho-ji, no you cant get in that one) can be a great day of walking and exploring and seeing temples. often with very few other tourists around. \n\n- yes kinkakuji and arashiyama can be done in one day. but you cant do all of arashiyama. you can easily spend 2 days and not see everything in arashiyama. a interesting spot to hike to might be the Kuya Falls (around an 1.5hrs from tenryuji hike)\n\nthat should be plenty of options for your kyoto area trip. hope you find something awesome.  \nif you look around a little there are sooo many options.",

Possibly fall foliage in November depending on the leaf forecast. I would recommend at least an overnight trip though with a visit to Ine (equally charming fishing village a bus ride down the coast). Part of the fun of visiting Amanohashidate and Ine for me was having a slow, peaceful vacation. Also, the trip from Kyoto is pretty long and wouldn\u2019t be as interesting in the dark if coming/going very early/late. When I was there last the one car trains and the buses only took exact change in coins so bring a full coin purse. There are also several sightseeing and scenic dinner trains that run in that area.",

It's a lot of vendors on the street with fish, oysters, treats, etc, and there's plenty of good sushi around too. It's fairly close to Akihabara, so I'm planning to go there in the morning and then continue on to Akiba after. There's also Toyosu fish market (the new one, has the actual fish auctions at 5am) but I haven't been there yet.  \n\n\nI'd also suggest Ikebukuro as an area to explore, as it has a lot of shops and a giant new Animate store. I know you're a little limited on Tokyo days, so maybe that's just a fill in on your last day or something.\n\nIn Kyoto, Arashiyama Bamboo forest is great! Definitely suggest. I'd also say maybe Fushimi Inari Taisha since it's very close to Kyoto station (depending on where you're staying, that might not be \"close\" to you) but it's very cool and worth checking out.",

They have, get this, a digital queue. So you can wander about and come back. Still be mindful of time though, cuz it's a 10 min get back here or we gonna skip you.\n\nAs for arashiyama, you should consider the monkey park. The view at the top of the mountain is spectacular. It's a 20 min hike (japanese mins). And the monkeys are nice. The river is a really nice place that you can head to after the bamboo forest. As for a place to eat, try Takara sushi. It's a 7 piece nigiri for 1000 yen. Pretty decent.",

Or you might want to consider Narai-juku, a quaint edo-style post town 30-40 mins by train from Matsumoto.

Port Tower isn\u2019t anything special, but I never rode the Mosaic ferris wheel so not sure about that. Another option is an evening round trip on the ferry between Kobe Airport and Kansai Airport for a city lights view from the bay. \n\nFood: Kobe is well known for European-style pastries so a pastry break is definitely recommended. I always liked Patisserie Tooth Tooth\u2019s tea and pastry sets, but there are many other options. \n\nShopping: Nagasawa in Sannomiya Centre-Gai is worth a visit if you or your bf are into fountain pens. \n\nTourist Resources: The Japanese language version of the \u201cFeel Kobe\u201d website has a calendar of local events, sightseeing recommendations, and a summary of transportation day passes. The English language version of the website isn\u2019t complete so it\u2019s better to use Google Chrome to translate the Japanese version. \n\nHave a great day in Kobe - it\u2019s a lovely city!",

So it means we can definitely find more special experiences between now and six months from now. I\u2019d love to travel in an RV actually, but I do worry about my Japanese not being good enough to get us into the really not-touristy areas.

Lots of space and time to just look at things and take them in rather than being confined to rooms with installations. I believe there's one planned for Tokyo which may be worth looking into. \n\nSnow Monkey Park was definitely worth the trip, and you have time afterwards to come back into Nagano and get some hot ramen after a cold walk in the woods. \n\nI would absolutely recommend looking into special/sightseeing trains, even if you plan to hire a car - you're there in November so you have all the autumn foliage out. \n\nWe found Akihabara a bit overwhelming, but then we were there for the first spring since the borders reopened. \n\nWith a car, I think I'd be looking at getting to some of the more remote places that are difficult to manage practically via train - I really wanted to visit some of the cat islands and other interesting places around the Inland Sea but the train schedules didn't align well.",

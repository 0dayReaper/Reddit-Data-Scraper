    "postText": " \n\nHey guys!\n\nI am biking 2000 KM across Japan alone for the next few months and I'm going to be writing updates about my journey. I spent several days working my way from the city of Kagoshima through the mountains to a small town on the coast called Izumi.  \n\n\nWhy am I doing this?\n\n1: I have struggled with my weight since I was a kid and I think changing my environment and biking 50km a day will help me break free\n\n2: I have always wanted to experience Japan in its entirety. Biking across Japan will force me to see the whole country and see what life here is really like.\n\n3: I wanted to force myself to become a better storyteller so I'm going to turn this adventure into a video series. The limited time to edit is going to force me to focus and get better at content creation.\n\nHere are the [photos ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1ejYEChksXBAobS3NJq8FkgLQKfiSvP95?usp=share_link&amp;pli=1)if anyone wants to see!\n\nI had a very interesting experience on my first day of biking across Japan. I was biking through the mountains of Kagoshima, the southernmost province of Japan. When I got to my hotel I found out it was abandoned. I was afraid since I do not speak Japanese and I could not find a new hotel nearby. It was getting very dark out and I kept biking through the mountains. I was very tired since I had biked uphill for 9 hours, and my body started to feel heavy. I met a man cooking chicken skewers in a small village and I asked him if I could camp on his property. He agreed and I ordered some hot chicken from him. As we talked through google translate I told him about my journey across Japan and He invited me to stay with him in his home! We drank green tea deep into the night and he told me about his life and he showed me his Kanata. I'm so grateful that he opened his heart and his home!\n\nThe next morning I tried to bike the rest of Kagoshima's mountains, but I was only able to bike 30 kilometers in 11 hours. The mountains made it very hard, I had to get off my bike and push uphill for most of the trip. I have about 100 pounds of cargo with me. I had planned to stay at a camping ground, but it was getting dark and my stop was still far away. I found a patch of grass in a small town to set up my tent for the night. I went to the grocery store to buy some dinner and water. I asked the owner if I would get in trouble for sleeping in my tent in that spot without a permit. When she learned of my plan, she said that I could sleep in her grandmother's empty home! I was taken aback. I'm a complete stranger and they let me stay in their home. I was about to cry at her kindness. The Japanese people are the kindest people I have ever met. I was able to get a good night's rest before attempting to escape the mountain in the morning.\n\nThis became the most stressful day of my life. I continued my journey across the mountains of Kagoshima. I used Google Maps to find a route to the town of Izumi. The route took me deep into the mountains. As I got far in I realized that the route was abandoned. Trees cover the path and I had to throw my equipment over time and time again. I kept going through as the map said I would find a road soon. I soon started to lose signal and my water started to run low. As I continued I reached the road and learned it was abandoned. I was afraid I would get lost if I turned back so I kept pushing forward. The road was covered in trees and rocks, many parts are covered in landslides. Sunset quickly approached and I didn't want to travel this dangerous road in the dark so I set up my tent and slept. I eventually reached a part of the road that had collapsed. I started to climb around very slowly, the ground kept breaking away under my feet. It was very scary as the smallest misstep would mean I would fall and get injured. There would be no one to help me. I wouldn't even be able to call for help since my phone didn't have a signal in such a remote area. I spent several hours climbing and taking my belongings back and forth. I had to be very careful. I eventually made it across. I received many injuries from the rough forest and the broken road. I fell many times. I eventually was able to make it out in the morning.\n\nI was completely out of water and I had many injuries from the experience. I continued to push forward and found a highway where I continued to bike to Izumi. Within a few minutes of riding, I found a rest area with a water fountain! I was very relieved. As I refilled my bottle a paramedic stopped there to use the restroom. I stopped him and asked if he had a first aid kit. He noticed my injuries and started to clean them with alcohol. He used his bandages to help wrap the wounds. I was very grateful. I tried to give him money many times but he refused to accept. I continued my ride to the town of Izumi. I was very happy that the route was mainly downhill. I was very tired and it was to travel. I found the town of Izumi where I was able to get some more medical attention and food. It was the first time I was able to eat in 32 hours. I found a hotel where I was able to take a hot bath and eat some yummy ramen! Once again I am humbled by the kindness of Japan. My apologies for the delay in posting this update and spelling mistakes, I am still exhausted.\n\nI turned this experience into a video, but I'm not allowed to post it here sadly. If you're interested in seeing it feel free to DM me.\n\nTLDR:\n\nI biked across the mountains of southern Japan, local families opened their homes to me on two different occasions and google maps almost killed me.",

Please be careful and make sure you prepare yourself properly before heading out there by yourself. Stack up on enough food, water and medical supplies and try to look up on information about road closures online before you head out. Best of luck to you!",

I lived in Kagoshima and southern Kyushu for a few years and yeah, for some reason google maps is completely unreliable there. It should hopefully get easier for you as you head north. Good luck on your journey!",

I look forward to reading more posts about your trip.\n\nWhen I was driving in rural Shikoku I found Google Maps and Apple Maps recommended routes that were not safe/viable/open. The navigation system that came with the rental car was much better when in the mountains, and we learned that if it didn\u2019t show the route that Google maps did we shouldn\u2019t go that way.",

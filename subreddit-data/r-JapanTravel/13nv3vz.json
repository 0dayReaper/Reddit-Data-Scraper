    "postText": "Thank you for clicking on my post and deciding to help a stranger with his itinerary!\n\nHeaded to Naha with my aunt (23M and 60F) for 3 full days in early July via Peach (Domestic from Kansai airport). Will be a chill one so no diving or hiking. Any suggestions/amendments/removals would be much appreciated. \n\nSome added context/info:\n\n1. no car rentals so just monorail/walking/bus.\n2. I'm into film/street photography and love the dilapidated vibe of certain parts of the city so any roads or areas not listed that I would enjoy, please do let me know.\n3. Wondering if Yachimun no Sato is worth visiting (1.5 hrs bus ride one way from hotel)\n4. Not into shopping but any places to get regional exclusive merchandise/omiyage would be cool\n\n2 July\n\n\\- Land at night\n\n\\- Head to Hotel near Naminoue Beach and have dinner nearby\n\n3 July\n\n\\- Fukush\u016ben Garden (Walk through to get to Kokusai)\r  \n\\- Kokusai Dori Shopping Street\r  \n\r\\- Makishi Public Market (Lunch)\r  \n\\- Tsuboya Yachimun Street (stroll)\r  \n\\- Nouren farm (probably come here the next day)\r  \n\\- (Optional as view doesn't look great) Naminoue Beach for sunset viewing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4 July\n\n\\- (Removed) Shurijo Castle\n\n\\- (Optional as I don't wanna tire my aunt out and it doesn't look very interesting) Kinjo Stone Road\n\n\\- Okinawa Prefectural Museum (Not into art maybe will visit the art side if there's time)\n\n\\- Sakaemachi Arcade (Dinner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 July\n\n\\- Former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters (A bit out of the way but looks cool!)\n\n\\- Kokusai again\n\n\\- Any places worth revisiting or we missed\n\n\\- Need more suggestions on where to go!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6 July\n\n\\- Morning flight back but get Pork Tamago at the airport before heading back\n\nEdit 1: Removed Shurijo Castle",

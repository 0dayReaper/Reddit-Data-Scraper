It\u2019s very similar to the Dinosaurs ride at Disney World in Florida but, for some reason, I loved every single second of it whereas I absolutely hated the other. I think the best thing for me, was that I went into the park completely blind. I knew nothing about any of it and somehow it made discovering it all so much more \u201cmagical\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of sister rides; The Tower of Terror was amazing and so much more fun than the one in Disney World. Both are great, but the new story was so refreshing.\n\nAlso, the little magical moments scattered throughout. I was walking and saw a janitor stop sweeping near a puddle of water and use her broom as a brush to draw Donald Duck on the sidewalk with water as the \u201cpaint\u201d. I feel like I could go on for hours.",

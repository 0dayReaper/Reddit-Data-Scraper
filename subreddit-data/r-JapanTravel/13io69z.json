    "postText": "Hey, so we just did nintendo land yesterday and had some pretty bad experiences I wanted to warm people about if they are planning to go. \n\nUnless you are lined up ridiculously early or went for the e press pass, you will have to use the universal app to book a time to get into that part of the park. The issue we had was when I went to book for three people, for some reason the app messed up and only booked for 2 of us despite us all being on the same application. On top of that, it wouldn't let us sign the third person up for anytime at all because an error message would pop up and prevent it. Basically one person just wouldn't be able to enter no matter what we did.\n\nWe showed this to staff and had to run around while people tried the same things over and over for about 2.5 hours. They finally admitted this was a mistake on their part and they had never seen this before. \n\nThe worst part was that their only apparent solution was that we had no choice but to pay them an extra 2000\u00a5 just for them to write a note saying we could go in and they explained how this was a \"privilege\" they were offering us.\n\nWe specifically came to universal to go to Nintendo land and found it pretty horrible that despite prooveing and them acknowledging that this was the fault of the park, they would do nothing for us unless we paid them more money. Given how much everything costs in the park it felt really greedy.\n\nPlease be warned because if something goes wrong on their end you will be the one paying for it.",

You get showered in apologies but the ultimate resolution of the issue is often very underwhelming and unsatisfying.  \n\n\nTLDR: Japanese customer service is great until something goes off script.",

I think in these large companies the workers must be scared to do anything that they haven't been strictly told to? So when a situation that hasn't happened before comes up, instead of bothering their superiors or making an executive choice outside of the rules they just stick to the book no matter what, even if it doesn't really make sense to. I would imagine this is more of an issue in big soulless corporations like Universal. I think if the staff feel as though they can't help that's the fault of the company for not training them for situations like this. \n\nThis is just the impression I'm getting based on the info I have, so maybe there is another reason, but I would agree that so far Japan has been pretty nice.",

The park always opens 1 hour earlier than the opening hours posted on their site, so use that to your advantage.\n\nThe timed entry system is also in place for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

You can shoe that something has upset you without being rude to the specific staff in front of you.\n\nIn my cause, all I did was ask questions and explain that this was frustrating and poor service. I explained how this glitch would separate families trying to get into the park, that it wasn't right for us to have to pay for the parks mistake. I asked why we had to pay and all I got was shrugs and \"I'm sorry\"s. I've worked in retail at minimum wage most of my life so I 100% understand what it's like to deal with a horrible customer, but culture shouldn't be used as an excuse to not do the right thing. In our situation they could have easily just let the one person in when it was clear the system had messed up. Making us run around the park for 2.5 hours then make us pay for something that should have been free to do is terrible service.",

I do know TDR is just easier than USJ (though the hotels in their equivalent of City Walk are surprisingly cheap, but have no benefits?) when it comes to visiting.  We booked the Ambassador for our trip so we I'm just going to get tickets when we are there and not worry about buying in advance and hopefully we don't need any premier passes.  TDR is a much better value than the US parks.\n\nYeah I've looked at Huis ten Bosch, but it just seems so far and I wasn't sure it had enough rides.\n\nNagashima looks amazing.  We did make it to Yuami no Shima, the farm stand for strawberry picking, and Nabana no Sato for the light up.  I would do all 3 again, though strawberry picking is sort of expensive compared to the US.\n\nFuji Q is another roller coaster park like Nagashima.  Supposedly, Nagashima is more like a less well run Cedar Point and Fuji Q is more like a 6 Flags.  I don't know if this is true.  I do love Cedar Point.  I've not been to a 6 Flags in years, my most recent non Disney Park was Hershey in PA, which was not what I expected at all.\n\nI admit,  I've been waiting until my kid got older to go to them all, because a lot of roller coasters in Japan want kids to be 10+ before they can ride them.\n\nI wanted to try a few smaller parks, I have been watching a few youtubes specifically about roller coasters lol",

Not sure if this is the same at the Ambassador hotel. For Tokyo Disney these days they only sell premier passes for a few rides in each park (e.g. Beauty and the Beast at Disneyland).

It was pissing down with rain all day, and Nintendo Land was PACKED. It seems like everyone enters and no one leaves. There was little space to shelter from the rain (had ponchos but were still soaking). Yoshis Adventure is probably an amazing ride in the sunshine, but in the rain it is utterly miserable, especially when it stops when you're outside \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe lines for food were outrageously long so we didn't bother standing in the rain for that.\n\nUSJ in general was so busy, we've been to many theme parks in our time, and even USJ pre covid, but have never experienced anywhere so utterly busy. All food places, including popcorn stands and butter beer, were soooo long we left hungry and wet.\n\nYou don't realise how little shelter theme parks have until it's raining lol.",

We also felt the Mario Cart ride was a bit naff. Didn\u2019t really know what we were doing so felt it was all a bit of a waste of time. We didn\u2019t research anything so maybe that\u2019s why. Should we have to though\u2026..\nWe are HP fans so thought the express pass would be worth it for that. Didn\u2019t even need timed entry into that area.

Any ride if note was 100-200mins wait (even some kids rides). Express pass is (at the time of writing) the only way into Super Nintendo World as you are given a slot . A park ticket is not enough. \n\nAs someone who did universal last year in LA I would still recommend it. It's cleaner, the staff were lovely (so so many of them all happy and attentive).

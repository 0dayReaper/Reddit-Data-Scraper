    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI\u2019m traveling to Japan soon and I\u2019m trying to get tickets to an exhibition in Osaka. To buy tickets I have to register through the Japanese eplus site and I put my information, like my phone number in Half-Width format. I\u2019ve tried everything I can think of including, using the Japanese keyboard on my IPad and phone, which allows you to type in half or full width, and YET nothing works. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong, I even tried a VPN. \n\nIf anyone knows what\u2019s wrong or has any tips please let me know.",

Unless you have a Japanese sim card or you know someone who can buy the ticket for you, you're out of luck and have to wait until you physically arrived in Japan. Once you are there you can buy the ticket from machines at Konbini's for example Lawson.",

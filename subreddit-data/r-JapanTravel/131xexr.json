    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nMy itinerary for my trip to Tokyo next month includes the following on Saturday 13th\n\n* Tsukiji Outer Market\n* Teamlabs Planets **(already booked: 10:30am)**\n* Akihabara\n* Kanda Matsuri(?)\n* Ameya Yokocho\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm struggling a little with where I should go to enjoy the festival and also realistically what time I should be making my way to said location considering the other things I've listed.\n\nI feel like I'm not making good use of the day as currently it feels a little messy without any defined plan or where to go so any advice or suggestions on how you would plan out the day would be appreciated.\n\nTo be honest. Akihabara and Ameya Yokocho could easily be moved to another day if there's a more logical suggestion for a fun Saturday which includes Kanda Matsuri after an already-reserved 10:30am ticket to Teamlabs.",

The other option is similar to you and actually head towards the shrine itself I guess?",

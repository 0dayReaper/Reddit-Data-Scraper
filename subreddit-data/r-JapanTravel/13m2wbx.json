    "postText": "I wanted to provide a slightly different trip report, focused specifically on high-end, top rated Tabelog restaurants that don't completely break the bank (though obviously still pricey). I will provide shorter reviews of each for length purposes, but for context I ate at **8 different Tabelog Silver / Bronze restaurants** (i.e. 4.0 and above, considered excellent - amazing) in total during a 1.5 week early-mid May trip. I focused specifically on finding ones that were less than 30000 yen per person.\n\nI hope this helps folks looking to spend a bit more on a special experience for their upcoming trip without draining the wallet. If you like this kind of content, I'd love any feedback, as I'm thinking about writing more specific posts like this in the future. Let's dive in. But first...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***What is Tabelog? How is it different from the Michelin Guide?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor simplicity, Tabelog is the de-facto foodie guide *in accordance to Japanese standards &amp; palate,* while the Michelin guide is catered towards Western standards &amp; palate. As an example, Japanese food critics often emphasize criteria such as aesthetics, ambiance, and cadence of service more than Westerners do, though of course the food itself needs to be delicious in both cases.\n\nMichelin also only lists restaurants that are open to the general public, which is not always the case with top Tabelog restaurants (and often not the case with Gold-awarded restaurants, which are only reachable via personal introduction).\n\nI have been burned by overpriced, lackluster Michelin starred cuisine in Japan before, but Tabelog has overall been quite consistent and my go-to resource when looking for somewhere good to eat. It also has a usable(ish) map feature which helps find restaurants on the go. The Japanese version of the site is the one to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Restaurant List (Score, Tabelog Award Type, Michelin score for completeness)***\n\n*Kyoto:*\n\n* Dinner at **Hassun** (4.20, Bronze. One Michelin star, formerly two)\n* Dinner at **Sakagawa** (4.18, Bronze)\n* Lunch at **Kiyama** (4.46, Silver. One Michelin star)\n\n*Tokyo:*\n\n* Dinner at **Tonkatsu Narikura** (4.22, Bronze. Formerly one Michelin star)\n* Lunch at **Sushi Suzuki** (4.30, Silver)\n* Dinner at **Yakitori Omino** (4.01, Bronze. One Michelin star)\n* Dinner at **Tempura Fukamachi** (4.06, Bronze. One Michelin star)\n* Dinner at **Florilege** (4.27, Silver. Two Michelin stars)\n\nAll of these cards took credit cards, including AMEX. In Kyoto, I used Pocket Concierge for Hassun and Kiyama, while Sakagawa was done through my hotel concierge as it was not bookable online. In Tokyo, I used Omakase to reserve Tonkatsu Narikura and Yakitori Omino, while using my hotel's concierge to book Sushi Suzuki and Tempura Fukamachi. I used Tablecheck to book Florilege.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Reviews:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hassun:** 4.75 / 5\n\n* Superb ingredient quality - even if I didn\u2019t absolutely love a few dishes, the individual components were all top notch and extremely flavorful. Sashimi was a highlight (squid, lean tuna, and snapper were textural delights), large eggplant tempura with white miso sauce was an umami bomb, the eponymous Hassun plate was impressively plated with many delicious small appetizers, yuba with uni and seaweed starter was perfectly seasoned, unagi course with rice was fantastic, and I had an unexpectedly incredible grapefruit slice with honey / brandy glaze.\n* Minor con is a dish or two that didn\u2019t quite hit for me. For example, the tempura course featured ayu (small river fish) which was fried whole, so it still had its innards which were very bitter. I got over it after the first bite but it was a surprise initially.\n* Chefs were willing to explain and chat with us proactively (this quality became more evident after meals at other places). It was just us (3) and another duo for 5 total at dinner. There were no servers, just the two chefs. They explained each dish and took out a huge encyclopedia of Japanese ingredients and fish to show us where items came from and how to properly eat them. I chatted with the head chef in bad Japanese, who\u2019s a jolly guy. The assistant chef speaks a little English and is a pleasure too.\n* Came out to 69,000 yen total for 3 people with Sake and Beer, so about \\~$175 pp, a good deal for this quality of cooking. Original course price is 22,000 yen for dinner or 11,000 yen at lunch, total per person. Lunch is also supposedly very good.\n* Book about 1 month in advance on Pocket Concierge. Wasn't too hard to find availability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sakagawa**: 3/5\n\n* Sad to say, this unfortunately felt like I was snubbed as a foreigner. Was put with an apprentice chef at the corner of the counter who didn\u2019t really know English so that voids the language / lack of communication rationale, while the head chef was at the center and very clearly making dishes for all the other guests except us. The hostesses were kind and the apprentice chef was good, but the experience felt rushed and ultimately paled in comparison to Hassun.\n* For completeness: Excellent sashimi, with chutoro, ika, uni, and tai. Shark fin soup was relatively tasteless; I was surprised when this was served.\n* Giant clam grilled with white asparagus was very good, Ohmi beef cooked sukiyaki style was pretty good. Fatty and succulent.\n* Baby whitefish and egg custard - pretty good. Made up of many individual baby fish and paired nicely with the egg / dashi.\n* Tempura was ok. A Kakiage tempura (mixed, with onions, Shiso, shrimp, alongside seasonal vegetables). Rice and soup were fine, as you would expect.\n* Dessert was a fruit jelly which was forgettable.\n* 79,000 yen total for the 3 of us including sake and beers. Would not recommend, go to Hassun instead. I booked this one month in advance with my hotel\u2019s concierge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Kiyama:** 5/5\n\n* Put at an apprentice counter and thankfully the reason was he did speak English, so off to a much better start. The owner Kiyama came by and helped prepare a few dishes, including the signature dashi. The restaurant has a couple of counter rooms and was told it can handle quite a number of guests, which explains the (relative) ease of reservation.\n* Water cup of their famous Imperial Palace well water and a handful of 3 types of katsuobushi (dried fish flakes) with 1 year age, 2 year age, and 3 year age (traditionally aged with fungal exposure, like blue cheese). Incredible to taste the flavor progression, and they shaved them in front of us.\n* Incredible Koshi-abura tempura, flavorful firefly squid with cherry salmon sashimi, multiple mouthwatering dashi tastings (you will be amazed). The owner came out and mixed it himself. Had the ichiban-dashi (first taste), then second dashi flight.\n* A mountain of food followed, too many to list. But it was truly excellent, excellent food at an excellent value. Cost me 18,000 yen for lunch including 3000 yen shabu shabu supplement to die for, so about \\~$140 total for one of the best Japanese meals I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve had a lot of them.\n* Surprisingly easy to book on Pocket Concierge with plenty of availability 2 weeks out. Dinner is double the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tonkatsu Narikura:** 4.5 / 5\n\n* Paying &gt;1000 yen for tonkatsu was a novel concept to me, so I was curious if Narikura lived up to the hype. I had previously been to Butagumi and Tonta which I enjoyed and also recommend\n* In short, it\u2019s pretty damn good. Unfortunately they had sold out of the rib roast by the time my 7:30 reservation came around, so I had the rib, \u201ccha-ton-briand\u201d (tenderloin), and cheese millefieulle along with a crisp Yebisu beer.\n* The rib was quite fatty and had a very luscious mouthfeel as the meat / fat coats your palette. The exterior is an interesting \u201csoft crunch\u201d, where the batter is relatively delicate and thin but quite crispy. I did think by the last bites it was a little too heavy though.\n* The \u201cchatonbriand\u201d was the star of the show - being a lean cut, it still melted in my mouth and was exceedingly juicy. It was also served quite rare, which kept the meat much softer than a full cook. I wanted an extra but they told me it sold out with my party.\n* Cheese millefieulle had an interesting texture as it\u2019s essentially thinly sliced loin stacked on top of each other with cheese in the middle, deep fat fried. How could this not be good?\n* The sauce / condiment combinations are all worth a try - I preferred mustard and salt, surprisingly. My partner like the yuzu sansho and salt, while our other guest liked the tonkatsu sauce, which tasted a bit sweet for me.\n* Honestly it didn't completely blow me away like I hoped, but I would go back if I could get a reservation. However, they're tough to get - released biweekly and tend to get fully booked within a few minutes of opening. I\u2019d monitor the OMAKASE page closely and mark your calendar for your preferred date, then spot check to see when availability will get released. I believe it\u2019s around 8PM PST.\n* 6800 yen for a choice of 3 cuts (like I did), or 5200 for 2. Of course you have to do 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sushi Suzuki:** 5/5\n\n* Hostess is a bit standoffish compared to other places, but still nice. Recommended a nice dry sake and beer, about 3000 yen.\n* The courses were as follows: Ika, hirame, isaki, akami, chutoro, otoro, kohada, ebodai, aji (exceptional and a huge cut), mirugai, kuruma ebi, bafun uni, hamaguri (so sweet and bouncy, this place\u2019s specialty), anago, negitoro hand roll, tamago.\n* Highlights were the aji which was a huge portion and insanely flavorful, chutoro, mirugai / hamaguri (house specialty, so delicious), kuruma ebi, and tamago. But all were insanely good. This is right up there with top Ginza sushiyas that are much more expensive. The rice is particularly notable as it can be quite sour at first taste, but really enhances the flavor.\n* Amazing value for an omakase of this quality. Can\u2019t get anything close to this elsewhere for &lt;$400 USD, and this didn\u2019t even break $200. 77,000 yen total for 3 people including beer and sake.\n* Reserved through my hotel concierge and most decent 4-star and above hotels will be able to do this. If not, you will need a Japanese phone number and speaker as they do not speak English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yakitori Omino:** 4.75 / 5\n\n* Wide range of yakitori offerings in an omakase format, including innards, white / dark meat cuts, and vegetables like snap peas / okra. 6600 yen per person\n* Really delicious overall, elevated by product quality and diversity of offerings. The seasoning leans savory and not the sweet teriyaki-like most yakitori places, allowing you to really enjoy the quality of the chicken. I will note that higher-end yakitori tend to serve chicken medium rare which IMO elevates the experience but if you\u2019re put off by that, tell them to cook it well done.\n* Innards are the star here. The gizzards, cartilage, heart, and \u201cchochin\u201d (lantern) skewers were so delicious. Standard cuts are excellent as well, ranging from juicy thigh to crisp tsukune (meatballs). Recommend pairing with a draft beer or highball, then check out nearby Senso-ji at night afterwards on a mild buzz when the temple / pagoda is illuminated.\n* Reservations are released all at once in month-long blocks on OMAKASE and tend to sell out about an hour after release, so mark your calendars. I didn\u2019t have any trouble nabbing the exact date / time I wanted 5 minutes after release.\n* Location is a mild con as it's right next to the Skytree, which is a tad far from most hotel hotspots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tempura Fukamachi**: 4.5 / 5\n\n* The chefs speak some English (the son's is actually very good), and 3 menus are offered: regular, regular + uni, and regular + abalone + sea cucumber roe + uni. I chose the 3rd and most expensive.\n* Truly elite tempura, which enhances the umami of the base ingredients as the batter itself has no flavor. The abalone in abalone sauce, uni, sea cucumber roe, shrimps, eggplant, nodoguro... all terrific bites. The chefs will tell you when to use sauce vs. salt vs. lemon.\n* The kakiage tendon (mixed tempura bowl) they give at the end was extraordinary; I was stuffed at this point and scraped every last bit. Try your best to save a little room for this if you can. The tencha bowl (green tea at the bottom) helps with digestion if you're really bursting at the seams.\n* I cannot give this a 5/5 due to price; it is very expensive. The most expensive menu was 27000 yen (\\~$210), which while I would probably pay again if I could come here, does dock it a bit as it's not necessarily a value. Lunch is a more palatable price at \\~16000 yen and I would highly recommend that if you can find a reservation.\n* This restaurant is popular so you'll want a good hotel concierge to do this on your behalf. I was only able to nab a dinner reservation instead of lunch like I wanted on a Saturday, about 2 months out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Florilege:** 5 / 5\n\n* Some French food for a change, with many Japanese ingredients used throughout like seasonal produce, miso, green tea powder, etc. I was looking forward to this one as a consistent World's Top 50 Best restaurant.\n* My lord, the food was amazing. From the \"broad bean\" starter which was a smooth bean puree on top of a churro with miso gelee, to the \"Udo\" course which was udo puree with hibiscus oil with caviar and udo-caviar cream, everything was absolutely delicious.\n* Service is friendly and chefs do all the serving. Good English ability and was able to understand every dish and its components. The head chef in the back does most of the heavy lifting while the apprentices do the plating and sauces. Very fun to watch in an open kitchen concept.\n* The best part? It's not terribly expensive. Dinner was 15000 yen per person, and lunch is 7500 yen. If you can find a reservation, I would absolutely recommend anyone to come here and try some of the world's best French food at a reasonable price.\n* That being said, reservations can be difficult to nab. I booked one month out and availability tends to dry up about an hour or so after they release in advance. Monitor the calendar appropriately and strike while the iron's hot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it this far, I hope you've enjoyed reading my reviews. I'm looking to write more actively in the future and I'd love to know if you like reading these kinds of posts.\n\nTo more good eats - M",

It was neat to have an \u201cexperience\u201d there in a small restaurant, from waiting in line for an hour with the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 popping out every so often to count the people in line and ensure those next in line got to see the menu, to sitting at the counter and seeing them make all the food right in front of you, patting the pork loins so delicately with flour. \n\nThose other experiences were great because of the personal interactions with the chefs and servers since the places are so small and you\u2019re an attraction as a foreigner coming to their non-tourist restaurant. Tempuraya Mirakawa was cool because there are 6 seats at the counter and only 2-3 tables otherwise. The chef and server were like \u201chow did you even find out about us?\u201d The unagi-don place was very similar, with 3 tables that each could fit 4 people. I stretched my Japanese as far as it could go to order food and beer and ask for things there, with some English thrown in to complain that my hand was cramping up from using the chopsticks and failing to get much rice, so when I left and the chef said something to me and I replied \u201cwakarimasen,\u201d they went \u201cWAKARIMASEN?!?!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure with fancier places like OP went to that you get a more intimate experience, so I encourage everyone to try something like that once and feel not like a tourist.",

I'll be in just a few weeks, and am trying to figure out some great eats. \n\n1. Is there a dress code for eating out? It'll be hot (summer) and I'm not really planning on bringing \"nice\" clothes. I'm from the Seattle area, and casual clothing has become a way of life...\n2. Kids? Are these places ok with bringing (well behaved) children? I'll have my 3 kids with me (teens / tweens), and all are excited to try a wide variety of Japanese food. Sushi, Ramen, Teppan, and the rest are all on the menu. My littlest rabbit has made Miso from scratch and will have questions about preparation... \n3. Allergies. We've got a few. I'll have a pre-printed card in Japanese with me that lists them, but I suspect there will be no issues... \n\nRight now I've only got reservations at a [Kibunesou outside of Kyoto](https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/23862-kibunesou-kibune-river-terrace-dinner-kyoto/), which is all about location, location, location.

                    "comment": "Clothing: Dining in Japan will feel much dressier than Seattle in my opinion. I\u2019m from the Bay where we similarly keep it super casual. I do think as a non-Japanese person, it does go a long way to dress respectfully and take time to research various aspects of Japanese dining etiquette, especially if you are interested in building ongoing relationships with the restaurants for return visits. \n\nI will absolutely pull up to the bar at Saison in black jeans and a T-shirt and I actively refuse to go to any restaurant in the US that has jacket requirements for men, but I bought nice long sleeved blouses and slacks and long skirted, long sleeved dresses for dining in Japan. I am a heavily tattooed woman from neck to fingertips to toes and so perhaps I overcompensated a bit since there are so many taboos around tattoos in Japan (I actively felt this much more in Kyoto than in Tokyo though fwiw), but in general dress in Japan is fairly conservative comparatively. I wore long sleeves and pants to all nice meals, or a conservative dress. In the states, on the rare occasion I do dress up, I wear a lot of plunging necklines and pretty sexy dresses, but I would have felt very out of place in Japan doing so. I think if you don\u2019t have visible tattoos, nice, short sleeved button ups and black jeans or slacks are probably fine most places. \n\nKids: it is very difficult to get reservations for 5 people at spots of the caliber discussed in this post in Japan to my knowledge\u2014  if you want to do the kind of fine dining talked about in the post above, you\u2019ll probably need to check for private rooms as a lot of places are kappo/counter and to see if the restaurants allow children at all. A lot of kaiseki/sushi/high end places simply do not allow them. Your kids would need to be INCREDIBLY well behaved, quiet and adventurous eaters. Like\u2014 PRISTINE manners. If you want to do super fine dining with that number of people, Ishikawa has private rooms (can\u2019t remember if they only fit 4 though or if they would allow children even id you can get it), Yakumo Saryo has a table that fits 5-6 I believe but again, not sure if they allow children at dinner, L\u2019Eterre has a fab and large private room. For more casual but delicious fare with well behaved kids, here\u2019s what I would recommend:  Savoy (Pizza), Pizza Marumo (SO GOOD), Tacos De Azules (open for breakfast! Mexican chef and his Japanese wife\u2014 the food is SO incredible and they also are open for breakfast earlier than most places), Kagari Ramen (swoooon), the handmade udon spot in the basement level of Nakano Broadway (an old school covered shopping promenade/mall thing \u2014 this would be a fun place to take kids as there are all sorts of interesting collector shops for manga and vintage Japanese toys (top floor) and the basement level also has an incredible, huge and very inexpensive used kimono store. SumibiYakiniku Nakahara is good for well behaved kids. When I went there, there were two different Japanese chefs from fine dining spots out to eat with their families and children here on their day off. It\u2019s delicious and the head chef speaks decent English. You can book through PocketConcierge. \n\nI literally only saw one child in a fancy restaurant in 28 days of fine dining every single day in Japan and they were silently walking into the private room at a very posh sushi spot for lunch. For manners reference\u2014 modulate my voice to make it quieter by 30%+ anytime I\u2019m in Japan. \n\nAllergies / restrictions : may I ask what the allergies / restrictions are? Some things will be easier than others. Unless you are seeking out specialty restaurants to accommodate restrictions, it can be difficult. I have allergies to an oddly specific family of mushrooms, and just had to sit out the courses that had it with no replacement or accommodation that would normally come in it\u2019s place in the US\u2014 this is fine if it\u2019s an allergy like mine which doesn\u2019t have a ton of representation in the cuisine and only amounted to 4 courses missed in a month, but if you want to eat tasting menus/ Omakase / kaiseki and you have a a serious shellfish allergy during peak shellfish season?Good luck. Can\u2019t have any soy products? I\u2019d be worried for you. Celiac? Needs EXTENSIVE planning ahead. Having a card written printed in Japanese with your allergies / restrictions listed is a good start, but keep in mind a lot of places simply will not accommodate them. Your best bet is to inform the restaurant of all allergies or restrictions at the time of reserving\u2014 do not wait until you are at the restaurant eating. There just isn\u2019t the same cultural context for it as there is in the US.",

Me and 3 kiddos. It's going to be quite an adventure. Fortunately, all of my kids travel very well. I'm not quite ready to turn them loose on Public Transit without me, but that's only a year away. Hopefully a reservation for 4 will be more practical. I'll call my hotels and see if the Concierge is able to make reservations for me.\n\n(My kids love the YouTube / Nebula channel \"[Jet Lag: The game](https://www.youtube.com/c/jetlagthegame)\", which is all about using public transit to get around while playing games like Tag across all of Europe. We're considering a week of doing exactly that in another year or two. I think, even now, if they got separated from me in Japan, they would probably be able to get back to the hotel before I could.)\n\n&gt;Allergies / restrictions : may I ask what the allergies / restrictions are?\n\nNuts and Seeds. With Sesame seeds (but not Sesame seed oil) being the things I'm primarily worried about in Asia. That and \"unknown\" allergens, as we'll be eating things not normally found in the US.\n\nFor the most part, we're able to eat Dim Sum, Teppan, Sushi, Raman and other Asian foods with no trouble.

So many places are kappo /counter seating with only 6-12 seats and, again, a lot of higher end places don\u2019t allow children under a certain age. The hotel concierge is a great resource for this if you\u2019re staying somewhere high end enough for them to have those relationships\u2014 I never have stayed somewhere that posh in Japan on my own, but know a lot of friends who have had great luck with concierge made booking when they were staying somewhere nice. I would definitely let them know three guests are children and do so very far in advance for a party of this size.\n\nThe public transport in Japan is amazing and overall the country is so safe\u2014 if your kids have phones and you get a Japanese SIM card to connect to the internet and they can use google maps and translate, they would likely be fine going around alone a bit, especially the teens, from a safety point of view. I saw many, many Japanese children who were pretty young taking the subways and busses alone. If I were a parent, I suspect I would be terrified to let my kids out of my sight in America but would be very relaxed about letting my kids wander in Japan from a safety aspect as long as I knew they would be polite and respectful when on their own.\n\nI want to be clear I absolutely do not feel Japan was hostile to children at all but wasn\u2019t traveling with kids and don\u2019t have any of my own so take this with a grain of salt. Perhaps some parents who have travelled to Japan with kids can chime in. From my observation there are just some different cultural norms around decorum, noise levels etc. For what it\u2019s worth, I went to Japan as a young kid (6) in 1994 with my mom for nearly a month and the whole trip was an amazing core memory that cast such a positive, cascading effect over the whole course of my life. I felt very welcome in the spaces I was in and remember many people offering me snacks and sweets and the women running a ryokan patiently showing me how to cook my breakfast egg by cracking it into steaming rice and letting me come \u201chelp\u201d with the dishes after. My mom took me to parks and playgrounds where I met and played with a lot of Japanese kids and my mom had really great interactions with other moms despite the language barrier and this being pre-cell phones. There are a lot of child friendly places, I think there are just some different cultural expectations on how children should behave in restaurants and other spaces that aren\u2019t specifically child focused. In the more casual but still nice restaurants I went on my trip this year that had a lot of tables with children, like Pizza Studio Temaki, it was extremely noticeable how differently Japanese kids were behaving from the American kids, European kids and kids from other parts of Asia who were often running around screaming and causing problems, uncouthly watching iPads WITH THE SOUND ON AND NO HEADPHONES IN A RESTAURANT etc.  \n\nRegarding your last paragraph, gently I would suggest not everyone feels that children bring so much life and happiness to all activities. I respect that there are people that feel this way and want to bring their kids everywhere, but it is also totally ok for there to be spaces reserved for or focused on the experiences of adults. I wouldn\u2019t go to Chucky Cheese and expect children to stop screaming or running around or being sticky and messy \u2014 similarly, parents should only bring their children to adult focused spaces like fine dining restaurants if those kids are able to understand and respect the behavioral expectations for such a space without negatively affecting other diners. What one person defines as life and happiness might be defined as grating, jarring and obnoxious to another.",

            "comment": "Great restaurant reviews, thanks for sharing. \n\nI tried to do the same thing for this upcoming trip. The Tabelog Gold and Silver restaurants, asking the hotel concierge to reserve for me. However, they weren't able to book any of my top choices, even six months in advance. I.e. Sushi Arai, Yoshitake, Sugaya, etc. \n\nMost of the Tabelog Gold and Silver restaurants are full by regular customers and can only be reserved now through introduction/referrals. In addition, many restaurants decline requests from non-Japanese speaking customers. Hotel concierges have a lot less leverage now, especially with booking services like TableAll, Omakase, Pocket Concierge, etc getting popular. Restaurants don't care as long as all the seats get filled up everyday. \n\nTabelog ratings are skewed by AI, so I would not fully trust the ratings and reviews. That being said, Tabelog **3.6\\~3.8** rated restaurants provide the best value IMO, and are much easier to reserve. Interactions with the chefs and learning about the unique ingredients and cooking methods are a big part of fine dining. These restaurants tend to have English-speaking staff or the chefs have basic English proficiency, thus better dining experiences overall. Another plus is that you are more likely to be served by the main chefs/owners compared to sous chef/apprentice chefs at the top-rated restaurants since you are not a regular. \n\nI have the following reserved, you can consider for your next trip. In addition, highly recommend Kyoto Wakuden. My favorite experience so far. Sushi Tokami 16 piece lunch menu is also worth a try, very good value and large shari sizes. \n\nSushi Harutaka\n\nTempura Kondo\n\nSushi Take\n\nSushi Inomata \n\nYakitori Hirano\n\nToriyoshi Ginza",

I like eating foods are still unique to Japan or much more value when I travel. Good sushi, which will come at a fraction of the price domestically\u2026 SushiDan is a pretty good \u201cbudget\u201d one and easily bookable. I heard the Ginza Onodera Kaitenzushi is also pretty affordable and good. Tokyo French food is also very well priced and delicious, an easy one to book is Ryuzu which is 2 Michelin stars and not that expensive. Gyukatsu is another unique one, there\u2019s a famous chain in Tokyo that Ican\u2019t recall the name but is easily googlable. Kaiseki is a must in Kyoto at least once and lunch at Kiyama is your best bet.\n\nI don\u2019t think ramen and udon really taste that different here than abroad (given we have chains like Nagi and Ippudo in the US). I think unagi is overrated outside of high end establishments, as is tempura. Please do not waste your time here eating beef bowls at Yoshinoya. \n\nAny sake by Noguchi Naohiko is excellent - i like the Yamahai Ginjo. Kikuryu is a nice budget option.",

There are a lot of gems within the silver category that does not break your bank.  Looking forward to Jambo Habare, Yakitori Omino and Kiyama (if they accept the reservation). \n\nGetting Tabelog sushi silver under 30,000Y is an accomplishment!!! I tried Sushi Hashimoto even at 30,000Y,it was gone within exactly 1 minute of it being available.  I am trying Top 5000 instead - Sushi Rizaki Aoyama (Tabelog 3.7, 15,000Y dinner Omakase). Although I do eat sushi quite a bit, I am not sure if my palate is refined enough to tell Tabelog 3.7 vs 4+. Have you tried comparing it?",

Tempura Fukamachi for lunch is definitely worth it but I would not be willing to pay &gt;$200 for it. \n\nFavourite experiences were Kiyama and Sushi Take.",

I would highly recommend - I\u2019ve been to a fair number of Ginza sushiya and it\u2019s been the best one so far.",

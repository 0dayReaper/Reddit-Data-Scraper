    "postText": "I have 2 weeks free while in Japan and would like to spend my time exploring the northern part of the country. I would start in Sapporo around May 19th and want to make my way down towards Tokyo and try to be there by June 2nd. Both of these regions seem to be less touristy especially in the summer so I\u2019m not sure which places to visit. Based off of research I saw that Sapporo, Hakodate, Furano, and Sendai somewhat interested me but I feel like they only need a couple of days each and aren\u2019t worth spending too much time in. I also want areas with good nature or with nice guesthouses/ryokans. I don\u2019t have a car so preferably they are places were I can access them via train.\n\nAlthough it is irrelevant to my question, here is my plan for the 4 cities mentioned. (Only adding it to satisfy the mods annoying rule)\n\nSendai \n\nZuih\u014dden Temple\nSendai Castle \nOsaki Hachimangu Shrine\nSendai Morning Market\nKotodai Park\nSendai Downtown\nSendai Mediatheque\n\n\nHakodate\n\nGory\u014dkaku\nGory\u014dkaku Tower\nHakodate Morning Market\nHakodate Park\nOld Public Hall of Hakodate Ward\nMt. Hakodate\nCape Tachimachi\nKanemori Red Brick Warehouse\n\n\nSapporo \n\nSapporo Beer Museum\nSapporo Clock Tower\nSapporo TV Tower\nMaruyama Park\nHokkaido Jingu\nNakajima Park\nTanukikoji Shopping Street\nSapporo Hitsujigaoka Observation Deck\nShiroikoibito Park\nSusukino\nOdori Park\nJR Tower\nNijo Market\nSapporo Dome baseball game?\n\n\nFurano/Biei overnight trip\n\nNingle Terrace\nFarm Tomita\nFurano Lavender Fields\nShikisai No Oka\nShirogane Blue Pond\nShirahige Waterfall\n\n\n\nEdit: Based off of recommendations this is what the plan is looking like. Anything I should change? I don\u2019t mind moving around a lot and only staying a couple of day anywhere\n\nSapporo May 18-23\n-Otaru day trip\n-Furano day trip\nNoboribetsu 23-24\nToyako 24-25\nHakodate 25-27\nAomori 27-29\n-Hirosaki day trip\nHachinohe 29-30\nSendai 30- June 3rd\n-Yamadera day trip\n-Matsushima day trip",

Technically in another prefecture, but it's really nice and about an hour away by train.\n\nMatsushima is also \"next-door\" and makes for a nice day trip.",

Definitely have zunda mochi while you are there (local specialty), I can recommend [this place](https://goo.gl/maps/em79m4vHojuaSUXb6), their matcha was awesome as well and I generally don't really like it. Thenon the way back, have a look at the Zuiganji temple itself and there is also nice garden next door (Entsuin). However, most of these places require a small fee to enter and it kinda adds up. Just a heads up.\n\nIf you are feeling particularly adventurous, on the way to Matsushima, you can make a stop at Shiogama Fish Market (Wholesale?) for some nice breakfast. Although, at least the Wholesale market is very much not catering to routists, so it was bit of a struggle, haha. Maybe the regular one is more accessible? Still cool experience.\n\n----\n\nYamadera is more of a half-day trip, unless you add more things along the way. You could combine it with stop at Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory visit, which on the way there. Or as someone suggested, visit an onsen. We were returning to Tokyo that day so half day trip was fine for us. Also, I would skip the Basho-kinenkan museum in Yamadera, the small exhibition of dolls is cool I guess, but the entry fee is kinda expensive for what it is and half of the exhibition are Japanese poems,not translated to English.",

            "comment": "For Hokkaido, Otaru is really great and not too far on the train from Sapporo. Highly recommend.\n\nFor Furano it\u2019s a shame you will be missing the full lavender bloom, but that does mean it will be less busy, and there should still be other flowers at the farms and gardens.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re taking the train down to Hakodate anyway, stop for a night at Noboribetsu or Toyako. Noboribetsu has the most popular hot springs/ryokans in Hokkaido, and Hells Valley is great. Toyako is a beautiful caldera lake with lots of recreational activities and nature. \n\nHakodate itself is really gorgeous- I love the view from Mt. Hakodate.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where you got the \u201cless touristy in summer\u201d tip for Hokkaido though. There are a lot of tourists that come up to escape the heat. Hokkaido has a later blooming season than the rest of Japan, so mid-late May (when it looks like you\u2019re coming) is fairly popular.",

It was a nice place to just chill and relax. \n\nI agree - Hokkaido has way less tourists compared to Tokyo (like 100x less) and generally was less stressful to explore. The Maybe Hokkaido has more local tourists than foreigners. Tokyo was incredibly crowded with tourists. I also went from Sapporo down to Tokyo, was there from 6th to 20th April.",

It has an very nice historical district with a mix of old samurai residences as well as some interesting European style buildings built shortly after the Meiji restoration. Right next door is the Hirosaki Park which is very pretty and in its center is Hirosaki Castle, one of the 12 surviving \"original\" castles. You'll see a good amount of scaffolding around there right now because they're renovating the stone foundation. However I actually quite enjoyed the exhibit inside the castle explaining how they physically moved the castle inch by inch to get access to the foundation for renovations. From Hirosaki park you can also gaze at the majesty that is nearby Iwakisan, a huge mountain that rivals Fuji in beauty!",

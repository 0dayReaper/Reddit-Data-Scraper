    "postText": "Hello!\n\nTravelling to Oita for 4 nights (5 days) May 7-11th with my fianc\u00e9. Would really love any recommendations if people were kind enough to share.\n\nWe are planning to have a car rental. So far we have our first night booked in Beppu. We are both fluent in Japanese (fianc\u00e9 from Japan).\n\nWe're considering the following places but not sure which to pick: **Yufuin**, **Kurokawa-onsen**, **Takachiho**, **Harajiri**, **Kunisaki peninsula** (Futagoji/Tennenji/Choanji/Fukiji temples)\n\nWould hugely appreciate any info on:\n\n* **1-day/2-day hikes/pilgrimages:** would love to hike between temples &amp; stay at ryokan. Was considering Mt Hiko but think it's too far. Considering Kunisaki peninsula, but there seem to be few ryokan there - so maybe a day trip. Mt Aso, Mt Yufu seem to just be mountains without temples.\n* **Any particularly nice ryokan/hotels**. We've booked one night in [Yamada Bessou](http://yamadabessou.jp/) in Beppu - would love any particular Ryokan recommendations - especially rural/mountainous/romantic locations!\n* **Beppu-specific recommendations -** we'll be there either 1 or 2 nights. Would love any recs, including day-trips (e.g. to Yufuin?)\n* **Anything else**: if anyone has anything they really enjoyed when in Oita/nearby would love to hear! Attractions/food/activities suggestions welcomed\n\nAny suggestions valued! Thank you in advance! :)",

Awesome!](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z8DyQCknBn9AFjTS8?g_st=ic)\n- [Robata Jin is awesome. we are 2 nights in a row.  Best to make a reservation as it\u2019s very popular with locals.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J3YdDnhTsUT7pzar6?g_st=ic)\n- [Takegawara Onsen - has sand bath option too.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p1Co6rcsVYuG2Hqr5?g_st=ic)\n- [Great tourist info spot at Beppu Wander Compas. They recommend Robata Jin to us.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UpvFFb4StVfs4i7o8?g_st=ic)\n- The He\u2019ll Ponds we\u2019re okay but they took all day.  Avoid the crocodile one.  It\u2019s very sad.  I\u2019d suggest skipping these or only going to the blue one and instead hopping around to some of the day use onsen instead. \n\nIf you base yourself in Beppu for 2 or more nights you could also take the [Yufuin no Mori sightseeing train](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/yufuin_no_mori.html) to get to/from Yufuin. And/or the [Aso Boy sightseeing train](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/asoboy.html) to/from Kumamoto.",

Is it the only loud annoying thing you\u2019ll encounter in Shibuya? Far from it but the fact the kart tours were running all the time adds to their nuisance factor. Plus keep in mind that even in Tokyo where people are more used to seeing foreigners around, Japan is a very homogeneous country, and the foreign tourists driving these things around contributes to the public perception that foreigners are wild and don\u2019t follow the rules, an outlook that has negative consequences for foreign residents of Japan.",

I'm glad it's gone though. Nothing about it adds to the experience of being in Japan at all. It's a westernized experience for clueless tourists in Japan, so I would say it actually takes away from the experience of what Japan has to offer.\n\nAnd if this was their top 3 things to do in Tokyo. Man what a low bar to begin with, with the words  &lt;anime name&gt;, ramen, sushi, kimono, Tokyo, Kyoto, and Mt Fuji (maybe Osaka) being the only other words they know about Japan.\n\nIf you wanted to \"be on the [literal] streets of Tokyo\", you were better off getting a rickshaw tour from one of the many locations. They abide by traffic laws, and inform you of the locale, and are much more relaxing, and non-intrusive.",

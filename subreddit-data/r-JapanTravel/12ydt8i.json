    "postText": "So in July I'm going for two weeks at least that's the plan. The plane won't be the issue, but i do have some minor inquiries.\n\n1. Hotels and Airbnb require you to be 18 (at least from what I've seen) and I'm the only person going how could I get around this?\n\n2. If potentially i get in trouble with police for what ever reason what should i do? (Unlikely i want to explore not cause trouble but still a thought) \n\n3. Staying in contact with my mom i assume i would need a sim card that you could rent for 14 days I've seen those in pretty much every travel guide I've read. which one would be the best one?\n\nThat's the major points, but any advice outside of these would be more than appreciated. So, a little more information: this will be the first time I travel far from home without my family. Yes, my mom is okay with it, just a little scared about the idea of her first kid going across the world. Any good parent would be. I have a passport (pretty much guaranteed with having family outside my home country). I'm landing in Tokyo, and once I get the money to book for the two weeks, I will start calling hotels and getting a general idea of what needs to happen. \n\nTL:Dr need advice for a 17 year old going to Tokyo Japan for two weeks.",

Worst case scenario, the service is spotty and you need to rely on public wifi sometimes.\n\nI stayed in an airbnb with no trouble - BUT that was before the crackdown and everything. I imagine airbnbs won't care, because the last few times I literally checked in and out without ever seeing the owner. If you're set on staying at a hotel, go for a big one, like an international chain. They should have solid procedures for minors staying by themselves.\n\nAnyway don't worry too much, Japan is one of the easiest places to visit by yourself. I'd imagine you'll have more of a culture shock going from a small city to a big city like Tokyo, rather than a country specific culture shock. All big cities are rather similar.\n\nLast thing, please get a suica. Like, literally the moment you step out of the airport. Get a staff to help you find a machine and get a suica.",

            "comment": "I guess messaging any hotel you plan to stay at would be helpful. Ask what their policy is for minors and if you have to bring any documentation. There are also hostels that explicitly don't allow minors (listing titles would literally say 18+ adults only)\n\nIn previous years I've stayed at hotels that were strict and asked for the same credit card used in the online booking. Haven't encountered that in my latest trip. But they always ensure that the names on the booking and passport match up.",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nMy family and I will be traveling to Japan for the first time this June. We'll be staying in Osaka for our whole trip, with a day trip to Kyoto. There will be 7 of us--my siblings, cousins, and my mom who has rheumatoid arthritis which has me worried about the amount of walking. So, to the best of my abilities, I have tried to optimize the itinerary for my mom while trying to maximize it for everyone else's benefit. Also, the transportation system is extremely different from where I live, so I'll be relying on Google Maps the whole trip. We will most probably get lost a bunch of times which doesn't help with my concern abt my mom so I've been considering taking taxis for shorter distances.\n\nHere's the itinerary that I have so far:  \n**Day 1, Fri (Arrival)**  \n\u2022\tArriving at 7 PM  \n\u2022\tDinner near accommodation at Nishinari Ward\n\n**Day 2, Sat (Osaka Amazing Pass Day 1)**  \n\u2022\tBrunch at Kuromon Ichiba Market  \n\u2022\tOsaka Castle  \n\u2022\tOsaka Museum of History  \n\u2022\tLate Lunch at either *Strike Ken, Shoyu-Ramen Sodaisho, Mengenso, Ramen Chonmage, or Mugito Mensuke?*   \n\u2022\tTenjinbashisuji Shopping Street  \n\u2022\tOsaka Museum of Housing and Living  \n\u2022\tDinner at Dotonbori\n\n**Day 3, Sun (Osaka Amazing Pass Day 2)**  \n\u2022\tOsaka Aquarium Kaiyukan  \n\u2022\tBrunch: Naniwa Food Theme Park  \n\u2022\tTennoji Park, Keitakuen Garden, (Tennoji Zoo?)  \n\u2022\tShitennoji Temple, Gokuraku-jodo Garden  \n\u2022\tShinsekai: Janjan Yokocho, Tsutenkaku Tower  \n(Any recs for good eats around Tennoji and/or Shinsekai area?)\n\n**Day 4, Mon**  \n\u2022\tNakazakicho District  \n\u2022\tHankyu Entertainment Park? No idea where to go after Nakazakicho...  \n\u2022\tLunch at a conveyor belt sushi place? (Rec needed pls and thank you.)  \n\u2022\tSolaniwa Onsen (tattoo-friendly)  \n\u2022\tHozenji Yokocho\n\n**Day 5, Tue (Kyoto)**  \n\u2022\tArashiyama Bamboo Grove  \n\u2022\tTenryu-ji  \n\u2022\tLunch at Nishiki Market  \n\u2022\tFushimi Inari Taisha  \n\u2022\tKiyomizu-dera  \n\u2022\tGion  \nTried to plan a 2-day trip but couldn't find anything else we wanted to do (that aren't temple-related) other than the stuff listed, so felt like a day trip was best?\n\n**Day 6, Wed**  \n\u2022\tFree day, don't know what to do or where to go...  \n\u2022\tMaybe lunch at Tonkatsu KATSU Hana?  \n\u2022\tMaybe dinner at Ura-Tenma?\n\n**Day 7, Thu**  \n\u2022\tShopping at Shinshaibashi-suji, Amerika-Mura  \n\u2022\tLunch at Hokkyokusei \u2013 Shinsaibashi Main Shop  \n\u2022\tMore shopping... somewhere...?  \n\u2022\tDinner reservation for 6 PM at Kobe Aburi Bokujyo\n\n**Day 8, Fri (Departure)**  \n\u2022\tCheck out of accommodation, leave luggage at a coin locker  \n\u2022\tHave some free time before flight at 8:25 PM\n\nI'm unsure of what to do in the later days because I feel like we've done most of the \"recommended\" stuff to do in Osaka on days 2 and 3. Mostly just want to eat. I feel like it's a lot and yet not enough! I just want everyone to have a good time!\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Food recs too please! (I've tried tablelog and did my own research but yeah... there are just too many options!!!) Thanks for your time in advance!",

            "comment": "I would recommend a day trip to Nara for one of the free days. Or if you\u2019re up for a slightly longer day trip, I could recommend going to Iga by Kintetsu. They have a ninja museum and show, and it\u2019s in the countryside, so you\u2019ll see another side of Japan that you wouldn\u2019t see if you stayed in the big cities. Also, the train ride out is really nice once you get into the mountains. If you\u2019re lucky you might even get to ride a train painted up as a ninja.",

            "comment": "Hi. Just finishing a 15 day trip. My biggest suggestion would be to look at your day 5 at Kyoto. There is a fair amount of distance between those places and your main transportation will be packed buses. In addition, the Fushimi Inari Taisha was a lot of walking and tired my group out quite a bit. I would look into potentially moving some of those items to the next day (day 6)",

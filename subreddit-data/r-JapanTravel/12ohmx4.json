    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nWe(wife and I) have a trip to Japan scheduled April 20-May 2. \n\nWe very much would like to enjoy the cherry blossoms. For that reason, we planned on an overnight trip from Tokyo to Aomori to visit Hirosaki castle April 23-24. Given that the Sakura is blooming almost 2 weeks early, I am wondering if we should change our trip a bit and visit Sapporo (edit: or Hakodate). Details below.\n\n\nFor context, our itinerary is as follows:\n\nApril 20-23: Tokyo. Leave Tokyo in AM.\n\nApril 23: 4 hour travel by Shinkansen to Aomori, overnight in Aomori.\n\nApril 24: Shinkansen back to Tokyo. Possible stop for a few hours in Sendai.\n\nApril 25-26: Tokyo Disney Resort\n\nApril 27-30: Kyoto, Osaka, possible day trip to Hiroshima.\n\n\nGiven that the Sakura has come so early, is it worth changing our April 23-24 excursion to Hakodate or Sapporo? I am worried there will be few to no cherry blossoms left in Aomori.\n\nIf we were to do Hakodate, everything would stay the same. If we were to do Sapporo, I think we would take the Shinkansen there(and enjoy the countryside on the long 7 hour trip), and fly back to Tokyo.\n\n\nAny thoughts on this itinerary as a whole and changing it as described? I can provide more info if needed.",

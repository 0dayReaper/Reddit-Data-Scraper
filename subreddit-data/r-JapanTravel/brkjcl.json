    "postText": "Just got home from a 2 week japan trip where I spent 5 days in Tokyo with a day trip to Nikko, 1 in Hakone, 3 in Osaka, 2 in Kyoto, and then 1 more in Tokyo before flying out. So I\u2019ll sum up my trip in short sentences.\n\n-I am going to miss gas station good terribly. The egg sandwiches were my breakfast till restaurants opened at 11 and god damn they are good.\n\n-Picori sweat, drank that shit everyday as a Canadian I sweat like a pig in hot humid climates. Also noticed it helped when I slammed it before bed to reduce hangovers.\n\n-read online that udon no chikara drinks can help with hangovers when your drinking. I would drink one before bed and I did a fair bit of partying and never really had a bad hangover! Always managed to get up at a decent time and explore all day!\n\n-garbage cans just don\u2019t exist in japan haha some stores even wouldn\u2019t let me put my garbage in their bins because I didn\u2019t buy something from their store.\n\n-don\u2019t understand how anybody thinks Ichiran ramen is the best in japan? Ate at 6 or 7 different ramen shops and Ichiran was the worst.\n\n-definitely gonna miss grabbing a cheap beer at a 7-11 and drinking in public. Would always predrink before going out and it saved me a ton of money. Drinks at bars and clubs worked out to like $7 or $8 Canadian for me so that was a must.\n\n-karaoke is hella fun if you get a crowd who\u2019s on the same level as you. I\u2019m a shy guy so I have to be pretty drunk to sing in front of other people lol. Also highly recommend bar champion in golden gai! Never have I been in a bar before where the whole bar is screaming karaoke together! It was an amazing experience!\n\n-team lab borderless is an unreal experience, going early before opening is a must as you can experience some rooms with minimal crowds.\n\n-drinking culture in japan is insane, these salarymen can drink like fish, can\u2019t count how many of them I seen stumbling in alleyways with puke all over their suits, no wonder they sleep on the trains haha\n\n-Tokyo was my favourite city and I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting that. Picked a district or two for each day and would explore my favourite spots.\n\n-Kyoto is overhyped and way too touristy for my liking. Bamboo forest is a waste of time. Wish I would have just stayed in Osaka and maybe visited Kyoto for a day or two.\n\n-I really enjoyed Osaka, highly recommend staying in the namba or shinshabashi area near dotonbori. Osaka bar crawl was a good way to meet other travellers and had a lot of fun!\n\n-the day trips I did were honestly the best highlights of my trip. Nikko, Nara, Hakone, and Himeji castle were all amazing! \n\n-Being a bit of a history nerd Nikko had me in awe the whole time. Such a cool place! I recommend anyone going to Japan must do a day trip there!\n\n-Staying in Hakone for a night was a genius idea, all the exploring and walking had me exhausted and had sore feet so I did the rope way and pirate ship and then relaxed in the Onsen and gave myself a break in the middle of my trip.\n\n-Highly recommend Nara as well, feeding the deer is a cool experience but the real cherry on top is the Toda-Ji temple and the big Buddha. Also had lots of Japanese kids on a school trip and they had an assignment to practice English with tourists so it was a cool experience talking to them.\n\n-Skipped out on castles in other cities cause I knew Himeji would be the best, the castle was massive and had me in awe the whole time. A half day trip out of Osaka is all you need for Himeji.\n\n-Pasmo or IC card is a must! So much easier than using tickets all the time, just load up the card and tap the subway gates and your good to go. Also used my card for any convenience store purchases. That way I would cut down on small change as all the 10 and 5 yen coins started to drive me nuts!\n\n-I loved Japanese people! They are so nice and would help me out anytime I had a question. They are so polite and the customer service is always so good! Tried to tip once or twice and they wouldn\u2019t accept it!\n\n-Honestly never took a cab once, when booking your hostel just make sure your close to a train station and you\u2019ll be fine. If you plan on partying then maybe stay in the area you want to party in as last train is at midnight or one depending which city your in.\n\n-Japan was a spontaneous solo trip for me and i am leaving this country feeling so fulfilled and happy I chose it! I will definitely be back one day as Japan has a special place in my heart!\n\nIf anyone has questions or needs advice for their trips I can try to help just ask away!",

We ended up going back to Tokyo a couple of days earlier - I liked Tokyo a whole lot more than I had expected to! Nothing against Kyoto, but the city attractions are more or less around the same type of thing, so after a couple of days you start feeling like you\u2019ve seen enough of that. I can completely see why so many people really love it, but it might not be for everyone. I spent 4 days there, was planning on 6, but that was too much for us in the end. I also had a better time when we went to less known attractions (like a small temple near the monkey park where the monk was super nice to us, a little rabbit temple, a free garden with a small art exhibit inside, the multiple statues temple in Arashiama). I really loved Kyomizudera and Fushimi Inari, but some of the main touristic areas of Kyoto get a bit of a tourist trap vibe that can be off-putting.",

For Nikko I bought the Nikko access pass that got me trains and bus rides in a certain area for one day. Hakone I just took the Shinkansen to Odawara then hopped on the bus. Himeji and Nara were actually very easy day trips I just used my ic card and took local trains as it was the cheapest way.\n\nI stayed in hostels and was really impressed with the cleanliness and quality of the hostels. I just used hostelworld.com and looked at reviews and picked the highest rated ones. The par crawl was easy they have a Facebook page and tell you when and where to meet and you can just pay at the first bar meetup place. I believe it was 2200 yen and you get cheap drinks and lots of shots.\n\nI wish I would have been able to make it to Hiroshima to see the peace park and A dome as I am a big history nerd. However because I didn\u2019t buy a JR pass it would been quite expensive to add it to my trip. However I honestly loved Japan so much that I\u2019ll be back one day, and next time I am going to explore the other less touristy areas of Japan.",

Especially in Osaka it\u2019s important to get drunk with clients, let your guard down, and party. How they do it everynite is beyond me since most in business work like 60-90hour work weeks and some go out to clubs nightly with clients. Also it\u2019s impolite if you don\u2019 t get really drunk with your Japanese business partners. That\u2019s about the only social coworker thing they do together because during work hours it\u2019s all WORK. Japanese admire you more when you get drunk and bond with them, don\u2019t ask me why.....Whereas in the US the office enviro is different, perhaps more casual too.

Wish I would have just stayed in Osaka and maybe visited Kyoto for a day or two.\n\nCan't agree more with this. The only rude person I came across was a tourist. Kyoto city/Arashiyama is a big no no for me next time.\n&gt; -team lab borderless is an unreal experience, going early before opening is a must as you can experience some rooms with minimal crowds.\n\nEhh I don't agree with this. I did go during a busy time so I can imagine it being way nicer when it's quiet, but I only saw it as flashy lights and nothing else. Was going to visit TeamLab Planets but Borderless put me off completely.\n\n&gt; -garbage cans just don\u2019t exist in japan haha some stores even wouldn\u2019t let me put my garbage in their bins because I didn\u2019t buy something from their store.\n\nI found that if I asked store owners where the bin/gomibako was they were nice enough to take my rubbish and put it in their bin.\n\n&gt; -Pasmo or IC card is a must! So much easier than using tickets all the time, just load up the card and tap the subway gates and your good to go. Also used my card for any convenience store purchases. That way I would cut down on small change as all the 10 and 5 yen coins started to drive me nuts!\n\nBy the time I got home I must have had about 1000 yen in 1 yen coins. My bag was so heavy.",

At most, they might drink a bit from a bottle of water or flask of tea, something reusable that you would bring back home. All the food and drinks are to be brought home / to work / to school etc. Or for a picnic, and if there are still no garbage cans there you would take your trash home.",

Tokyo surprised us with how non-touristy it ended up being. We did have the benefit of her Japanese friends squiring us around town, though, so there's that.",

I don\u2019t think I used many local JR lines in the cities but it\u2019s not a big deal because local trains are only like $2.50 a ride so I just loaded up a Pasmo card. It might be inconvenient to try to find and ride only JR lines as they aren\u2019t everywhere. However it would still be worth it just for the travel between cities. Enjoy your trip!",

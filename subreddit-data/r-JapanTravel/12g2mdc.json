    "postText": "We struggled a bit with using the local train with green cars using our JR pass (green class) since there wasn\u2019t any available information online about this topic. Thought it might be useful for anyone who is interested.\n\nHere is what we learned:\n- You can use local JR trains by putting the JR pass with the QR code into the automatic gates when entering and exiting the station (this part is the same regardless of whether you have the green class or ordinary class JR pass). Not all of the automatic gates have the slot for the ticket. You will need to look for one but there is generally at least one among the other automatic gates (with IC function only).\n\n- the sobu train had regular cars and green cars. When using the green cars, look for signs on the platform to know where the green cars will stop. The sticker on the floor is very confusing so it might be easier to look at the signs hanging above. \n\n- there are two floors in each car. You can sit in any empty seat (all seats are non-reserved)\n\n- you may notice that the light above your seat is red. Once you show your JR pass (green class) to the ticket conductor, who will come by at some point, and tell them the station you will get off at, the light above you will turn green. If you don\u2019t have a JR pass (green class), you can just pay for the seat by tapping your Suica card on the Suica logo above your seat (the red light will turn green immediately). \n\n- there were signs that said a washroom was onboard. We didn\u2019t use it so not sure how big it is. \n\n- there is no designated luggage area. There is a section of the green car where there is an overhead rack to put smaller carry on but nothing for oversized luggage. \n\nHappy travels!\n\nEdit: someone pointed out below that you need to load the green car ticket on the Suica card via mobile suica app or via the Green car ticket machine on the platform before you can tap your Suica card on the Suica logo above your seat (only if you don\u2019t have the JR pass - green class).",

These are for green car Suica ticket that can be bought and load onto Suica either via Mobile Suica app or via the Green Car Suica machine at the platform. If you don't have ticket, you have to buy from the conductor, which is more expensive.",

You simply walk through the gates with your jr pass and hop on the green car (it\u2019s kind of like going on a shinkansen without a reserved seat with a jr pass). The sobu line train has both regular cars and green cars. From my observation, the green cars are typically in the middle section of the train.",

Each ride on those green cars would\u2019ve cost us an extra 580-780yen on top of the regular fare.\n\nSome Shinkansen are shorter (like some of the ones to Kyushu region) and only has one green car so it can be difficult to book a seat (especially the oversized baggage seats) if you are travelling when everyone else is travelling. For one of the train rides, we ended up sitting in the regular car anyways because we couldn\u2019t get a green car seat.\n\nThe seats are a bit bigger, there is a foot rest, and there is an electric recliner so you can elevate your legs and have the back part of the seat fairly low. The regular Shinkansen cars are already pretty comfortable so if you are just travelling short distances and between Tokyo and Osaka regions then it might not be worth it.",

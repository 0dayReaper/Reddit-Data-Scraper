    "postText": "Hello :) I would really like some advice on my itinerary for my trip to Japan in August \n\nThings considering my itinerary: I will be travelling with my 6 yo son. It will be both our first time overseas and I am pretty airheaded so I'm trying not to pack too much into a day, to avoid overwhelming myself/ exhausting my son.  I've tried planning things near each other and using google maps to get a sense how long to spend at each place, and how long it'll take to get from place to place but it's easy enough to plan itinerary using Google Maps for timing and stuff, but it's a different story actually getting around. So I would appreciate some feedback if my day plan just isn't realistic / is too packed, ect.  I'm helpless with transport as well, so tried planning things that didn't have too muhc of a complicated route\n\nMy budget (excluding plane and hotel costs) is strictly $5000 AUD. That's how much I can maximum save until August. So if my itinerary seems too out of my budget, that'd be helpful to know too. My rough food daily budget is $50. I have emergency money, but will really like to avoid overspending, or having to spend money to fix a mistake that came from not planning properly, that's why I'm really wanting to make a well thought out itinerary. \n\nWhat I am to get out of my itinerary: a good trip that my son will also enjoy, without being too childish, scenic enjoyment (like hiking, relaxing at parks, boat rides, seeing pretty art, ect). Not big into amsement parks or super crowded, loud places. Also I speak very little Japanese, so I have taken this into account when planning things and have taken things off my itinerary where it seemed it would be too difficult to navigate without it. \n\n**14th August: Arrival**\n\nArriving in Tokyo around 8pm, customs + immigrations then checking into airport hotel.\n\n**15 Aug: Asakusa** \n\n* Check out of airport hotel and grab all necessary stuff from airport \n* Head to hotel in Akihabara and drop off luggage\n* Senso-ji + Nakamise-dori Street \n* Sumida Aquarium\n* Tokyo Skytree\n* Karaoke somewhere nearby, in akihabara? \n\n**16th Aug: Akihabara + Obaido**\n\n* Ueno Park (have an early picnic)\n* Catch Tokyo Cruise from Asakusa Pier to Obaido Sea Park. If I have the time before my teamLabs reservation, grab some food at nearby Vegan Ramen restaraunt\n* TeamLabs\n* The National Musuem of Emmerging Science and Innovation \n\n**17th Aug: Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku**\n\n* Shibuya Scramble - If possible, grab some food / drink from nearby Starbucks and view crossing from up aboce\n* Hachiko Memorial Statue\n* Shops I want to visit Shibuya / Harajuku:\n   * Tower Records Shibuya\n   * Angelic Pretty\n   * Sailor Moon Store\n   * CS T&amp;P\n* Takeshita Street -&gt; don't plan on spending too long here. Grab something to eat then duck into Selco Studio for some cute photos\n* Meiji Jingu\n* Head to Shinjuku for dinner (suggestions for any cheap places to get some food that don't require reservations far ahead? I'll eat anything. So far considering Omoide Yokocho (but not sure if appropriate to take 6yo) or Toritake)\n\n**18 Aug: Mt Fuji Tour**\n\n* **Head to Keio Plaza Hotel for meet up.** [Viator Mt. Fuji, Lake Ashi and Cable Car tour](https://www.viator.com/tours/Tokyo/Mt-Fuji-Lake-Ashi-and-Bullet-Train-Day-Trip-from-Tokyo/d334-2142TYO_F800_F820) (I'd love to go on the lake ashi cruise, but worried this 11 hour tour may not be doable for my son. Would love some alternative plans as back up ideas)\n\n**19 Aug: Mt Takao and Akihabara**\n\n* Head off to Mt Takao early morning \n* Akihabra \n   * Animate\n* At some point, head to Ueno Station JR office to get my JR Pass \n\n**20 Aug: Kyoto**\n\n* Check out Tokyo Hotel and catch Shinkansen to Kyoto.

Suggestions?)\n* Furuhon Ichiba Nishijin store\n\n**22 August: Kyoto + Tokyo**\n\n* Check out of hotel early mornign\n* Head to Fushimi Inari Taisha\n* Head back to tokyo for any more souvener purchases / spend leftover money\n* Head to airport late afternoon to check into hotel airport\n\n**23 August: Departure**",

            "comment": "Whew! You have way too much planned each day with a 6 year old. Some days are pretty busy even just for an adult. There is a lot of walking in Japan and your 6 year old\u2019s little legs will get tired quickly. You\u2019ll need to plan in some rest/down time throughout the day and also account for any nap/rest time they may still need. Best to get your #1 thing to see/do done early in the day so anything else after that is just a bonus since it\u2019s hard to know how the day will go with a small child. There\u2019s lots of kids parks that your 6 year old will have fun at too and where they can run/stretch their legs a bit.  Even if they are too big for a stroller at home I\u2019d strongly consider bringing a lightweight, easily foldable umbrella stroller if they fit.  This way your kid can nap/rest a bit as you continue sightseeing. Otherwise you\u2019ll end up carrying a heavy/tired/cranky 6 year old at different points throughout the day. \n\nCheck out these websites for lots of kid friendly travel tips and restaurant recommendations.  If you search the first few links below for the city name or neighborhood/area name you\u2019ll find some great ideas and tips.\n\n- [Best Living Japan](https://bestlivingjapan.com/category/travel/)\n- [The Tokyo Chapter (has info on other cities too)](https://www.thetokyochapter.com)\n- [Passports and Playgrounds](https://passportsandplaygrounds.com/)\n\nThese sample itineraries might be helpful to look over too. \n\n- [Tokyo Itineraries with Children](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-1-day-itinerary-with-children/)\n- [Kyoto Itineraries for Families with Children](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-itineraries-families-children)\n- [Osaka with Children](https://insideosaka.com/osaka-with-children/)\n- [JapanGuide: Traveling with Children in Japan](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2460.html)\n\nYou can also use the wheelchair accessible option in Google maps to make it (a bit) easier to find the elevators for your stroller in train/subway stations. When traveling on the Shinkansen you\u2019ll need to always book the [luggage storage seats at the back/last row of the train car.](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/info/oversized-baggage/)\nThis way you can fold up your stroller and store it behind your seat.  Another tip is to book the window and aisle seat in the 3 row on the Shinkansen or other trains with reserved seats. You\u2019re less likely to have someone in the middle seat then so you\u2019ll likely have an extra seat/room for all the kiddos stuff and more room for them to lie down and nap on the train. \n\n- [Tokyo Now Has Wheelchair Accessible Routes in Google Maps](https://www.accessible-japan.com/tokyo-now-has-wheelchair-accessible-routes-in-google-maps/)\n\n[Department stores](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2020/10/baby-tokyo-department-stores-take-your-children/ ) will also be your friend.  There are usually one or two floors of restaurants on the top floors that are easy to eat at with a wide array of foods and, especially during the day, there will be other diners with small children in many of them.  In the basement floors there are awesome food halls where you can get high quality takeaway food to eat at your lodging if you need a midday rest or for dinner.  Much better selection than konbini fare.  You may find it easier (and a bit cheaper) to have your main/large/nicest meal at lunch too. For children\u2019s medicine/products check [Japanese Drug Stores](https://jw-webmagazine.com/5-best-japanese-drugstores-cc1305f73a77/), Don Quiojte stores, or search Google maps for the nearest Aeon or Toys/Babies R Us.  \n\n- [Japanese Medicine Cabinet Essentials for Babies/Kids](https://bestlivingjapan.com/japanese-medicine-cabinet-essentials-baby-kids/)\n- [Mosquito Repellents in Japan (Kid Friendly)](https://www.thetokyochapter.com/do-you-need-mosquito-repellant-bug-spray-in-japan/)\n\nDon\u2019t forget to build in playground time and/or children\u2019s museum time for toddlers/young kids.

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI think you are underestimating lines at various places.  You are going during a Japanese vacation time and a lot of places don't just get visited by foreign tourists but Japanese as well.\n\nWhen we went to TeamLab we waited a good 30-40 minutes for Uzu Ramen.  The ramen is incredibly good, and I would highly recommend it, but I think you just need to be prepared that things are going to take longer than anticipated.  (I am also thinking the Starbucks near the Shibuya Scramble and the Starbucks in Kyoto, they're very popular and can be very crowded, and we didn't eat on Takeshita dori because every shop had a 15-20 person deep line and I was just not willing to wait.)  \n\nMake sure you talk to your son about staying with you, because my last visit to Takeshita dori it was insanely packed and it would be easy to lose a child.\n\nThe Lake Ashi cruise is incredibly boring to me.  I know some people love it, but it takes forever to load and unload and then you just sit on a boat.  You are extremely unlikely to see Mt. Fuji (because it is August.)  I would think long and hard about whether you really want to do a 12 hour tour with a lot of sitting on buses all day with a 6 year old.  I know my kid would not enjoy it, especially when she was 6.  It's one of your more pricey activities and I am unsure is really worth it.  I am unsure going to Kawaguchko would be worth it if you are only going to see Mt Fuji.  Again, you are going in August.  The Summer months are the worst time of year for Mt. Fuji viewing.\n\nMy daughter would hate a day of shopping at stores mostly for me.  Maybe your son is more patient?  \n\nAs has already been said the 20th is impossible.  I know some people have morning kids, but getting yourself out the door to get to Kyoto early enough to do everything will be hard.\n\nI too visit Japan in the Summer, because that is when school break is, but Japan is quite hot and humid in the Summer.  The humidity can be very hard and can just be exhausting.  It's better to give yourself more breaks in the weather.  It might be even harder for you because you will be coming from the Winter into hot and humid Summer.  We went from Hawaii to Tokyo this past December and I think it made Japan seem even colder.\n\nGood luck!",

You are a very lucky person.\n\nWe tend to go in June which not quite as humid but... we take breaks and we don't over plan days.  We make sure to stop and drink or eat something cold on a fairly regular basis.  We try not to get dehydrated.  I have a few wet towels that you put cold water on and then wrap around your neck or wear as a headband and they are supposed to help, they do to some extent.  The Japanese like to carry around wash clothes for washing off the face and neck which helps as well.  We bought our special towels at Disney World when it was really hot and humid one trip.\n\nBTW back in 2017 or 2018, we rented kimono from Okamoto.  The kimono/yukata selection were wonderful for women, even overweight women, and it felt like you were wearing a kimono not dressing up in a costume.  The children's selection was much more limited.  I have no idea about boy's or men's.",

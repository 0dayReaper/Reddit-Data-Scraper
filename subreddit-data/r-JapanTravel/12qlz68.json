    "postText": "Let me start off by saying Japans healthcare system is a big 10/10. \n\nMy wife had a bad allergic reaction, terrible cramps, vomit, diarrhea, and shaking, from soba today in Kamakura. I walked her to a nearby pharmacy to see if they could help and they sent us to a doctor across the street. He and his assistant checked her out and gave her a steroid shot\u2026 after 15min he told me that he suggest we call an ambulance. I know they\u2019re free but naturally that moment terrified us. I could tell my wife needed more help so they arrived shortly and were super helpful the whole ride, it was interesting using translation apps the entire ride to talk to them and answer questions. Then we get to the ER and the doctors and nurses were extremely nice and helpful. They gave my wife IV and did bloodwork to confirm the soba (buckwheat) allergy. \n\nThey had a translator who was with us most of the time and even explained how everything was going to work. He basically held our hand each step of the way. The total bill for ALL of this was $230 USD, I couldn\u2019t believe how cheap it was. \n\nTo the pharmacy workers, the doctor/nurse, the Kamakura amubulance, and to the doctors/nurse/translator at shonan Kamakura general hospital, and Japans overall health care system I can\u2019t thank you enough!! \nThey turned our terrifying afternoon into a night of laughing about the whole situation. I wish the US had 1/4 the quality I experience here in Japan.\n\nMy lesson to anyone reading this would be to not hesitate to call an ambulance in Japan.",

How expensive must it be to call an ambulance to be terrified by something that's supposed to save you... So unreal.\n\nSorry this situation happened to you OP and happy your wife's doing OK !

We don't charge anyone for hopping onboard our ride.\n\nThat said, while the younger generation are scared of getting scolded for wasting resources. Most of our resources are used to transport elders/higher dependency people to the hospital.\n\nWe have always advice STRONGLY to anyone who dials the 3 digit number to go to the hospital. We can't force people to go and we can't tell people to not go, they are the ones who have to decide. 8/10 they will, even for cases that we determine is non-serious at a glance.\n\nIts just easier on our asses to let the doctors in the hospital to decide if the patient is indeed dying or has any other underlaying problems that lead or could aggravate further. Plus if it's non-serious then atleast we know they'll be safe in the hospital for the next 6-8 hours.",

Basic support (broken bone, serious but non life threatening injury) is about $950.00.  Advanced life support is about $1500.00.\n\nFor those who have insurance the cost can vary WILDLY.  From fully covered (no cost, very rare) all the way to the full cost.  Though the average is reported to be $200 to $500.  Those with the best insurance also tend to have better higher paying jobs as well.\n\nNow, because this is a medical emergency you often just go to the closest hospital that has capacity to take you in (but not always).  But which hospital you go to can mean the difference between a total bill of a few thousand or hundreds of thousands of dollars.  For exactly the same care.  If the hospital is in your network it will be less expensive, out of network more expensive.  There have been attempts to limit these surprises but I'm not sure how successful they've been.\n\nIt's a shit show.",

I'm just hoping the pain resolves in the near future. But I've been through similar situations where scans/tests were done, I got thousands in bills because either the deductible wasn't met or the insurance refused to cover it (\"not medically necessary\"), only to have the doctors say \"just give it time you'll be fine\". So yeah, this is \"good\" health insurance in the wealthiest country in the world. Pfft.\n\nAs an aside, I was very ill on a trip to Spain last spring, saw a doctor there, and without having any coverage, paid the doc 140 Euros for an in-hotel-room visit, then 2.46 Euros for the prescription. The contrast is astounding....",

So we took a taxi to the hospital and got situated. The service was impeccable with no crazy or messy waiting room. My mom was called in, did an x-ray, echocardiogram, ekg, labs, and I believe a CT to be sure. It turned out to be a simple heart burn lol. Anyways, while I was waiting for my mom. The nurse placed my son (7 at the time) and I in the waiting room with beverages and snacks. They even played a cartoon and brought coloring books for my son. I don\u2019t want to say I enjoyed the wait but their service was awesome. They seem very caring. Unfortunately, they speak a little English but good enough to get by. We paid at the lobby and they called a taxi for us. The total was 693 USD for all these scans and lab work. In the US, this would\u2019ve been a 5-7k visit.",

I had insurance, I Google searched medical facilities that were open and I ended up walking to the hospital, despite the pain.\nI was examined by the nurses once I walked in, and then I was supposed to see a doctor.  They warned me it would be expensive, and I said, that\u2019s fine, I have insurance.  They looked at me and said, no it\u2019s still going to be expensive.  I asked how much, they looked some things up and they said it could cost you more than $2,000 and advised me that it might be better to just go home and get some rest.  I turned out to be ok, although I failed my exams and I still ended up paying $800+ simply for going to ER, despite having insurance.  And this was almost 15 years ago.",

Imagine someone who just had a stroke trying to do that once they got home.\n Luckily i was around and able to resolve that for them.  It took about 7-8 months of calling, sending in paper work proving my parents income and they sent us a reduced bill.  Also event hough we went and stayed at one hospital you get bills from like 5 different companies, which is confusing and frustrsting as you have to send in a that paperwork to each company that work in that one hospital my dad stayed at.  In the end we paid about 5-6 thousand cash as my dad wasnt old enough for medicare at the time and couldnt afford a 700 dollar a month health insurance plan.  He made too much to get approved the cheap insurance but not enough to actually afford a plan that covered basic things.  So frustrating!!!!!",

We all know our country is really bad at a lot of things. We thrive in a lot but suffer majorly in things considered \u201cstandard\u201d in many other first world countries. Hope our generation begins to work on making those challenges, no matter how difficult to address",

Because, as a foreign tourist who doesn't have a health insurance, you are billed threefold of usual price since 2021. So yeah. $230 was so expensive.",

Many expats with various illnesses go back to their home countries for proper treatment and care.

As a frequent user of both American and Japanese I\u2019ve had way more success in the US despite being a Japanese speaker.  Significantly more testing available and way more treatment methods available for the most part.  Certain fields of medicine Japan does pretty decent in but over all the US is more advanced.  Hell,  the Japanese medical community look to the CDC for guidance on many things.  I\u2019ve had doctors work together on numerous times in the US but I\u2019ve never had my Japanese doctors work together.  Hell, even transferring testing results and doctors notes to other doctors here in Japan is insanely inefficient and complicated.  Everything is on paper.",

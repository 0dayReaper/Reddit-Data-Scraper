            "comment": "It may take some time to pick up your baggage, get through customs, and pick up pocket wifi. You might end up getting to your AirBnB closer to 11:30 or 12.   \n\n\nJuly 30:  \nI'm not sure what you mean by Skytree (Tokyo Tower)? [Tokyo Skytree](https://goo.gl/maps/Gfv79vfWUyLWz2QPA) and [Tokyo Tower](https://goo.gl/maps/wmhbogthfew4t4bY7) are two different places. If it's just Skytree and Asakusa, the day seems a little light, but it might be fine as this is your first day and it'd be good to rest after getting in so late the night before.   \n\n\nJuly 31:   \nThe highlight of the Cup Noodles Museum for me was getting to make our own in the [chicken ramen factory](https://www.cupnoodles-museum.jp/en/yokohama/attractions/cr-factory/) and it requires reservations, which you can make on the linked page. It's an extra 1,000 yen, but it was a cool experience. Note that this is different than the [cup noodle factory](https://www.cupnoodles-museum.jp/en/yokohama/attractions/mc-factory/) where you just pick toppings and decorate the cup. \n\nFor the Gundam Factory, try to see which performances you'll want to see and time it, the standard performance schedule is here: [https://gundam-factory.net/en/attraction/](https://gundam-factory.net/en/attraction/). I didn't spend too much time here outside of viewing the Full version of the Awakening and Standby Mode.   \n\n\nAug 1:  \nNot sure what time you plan to start your days, but a lot of the larger stores in Akihabara don't open until 11 AM. This is actually kind of true for a lot of places - I was surprised to see how late a lot of places opened. The Gachapon hall here was kind of a letdown for me, but don't miss the one in Sunshine City (you have this scheduled for Aug 2). Also, I think the Animate in Ikebukuro is bigger, so you might want to add that to your list too. \n\nAug 6:  \nNear the Ghibli museum is a capybara cat cafe ([Capyneko cafe](https://capyneko.cafe/)). There's one capybara and a bunch of cats. Also, if you're into anime figurines and plushies, I found Nakano Broadway to have lots of that stuff too - you could do this on the way back from the Ghibli Museum area. \n\nAug 8:  \nGet a reservation ticket for Rilakkuma Cafe first, then depending on how much time you have until your estimated reservation time, go to the Bamboo forest or Monkey park. I did not get there at opening, and the wait ended up being a few hours. We walked the Bamboo forest, and the paid garden on the other side of it. We walked back going south along the river instead of the bamboo forest and by the time we got back it was around our reservation time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNara can be a day trip from Kyoto if you like deer and want to see some deer bowing for crackers. This is a pretty unique experience being surrounded (more like swarmed) by so many deer. They can be pushy, but I had fun here.",

            "comment": "Sept 9: buy jr pass before you go to japan, it is cheaper. i suggest to buy for 2 weeks and activate it on sept 13 (you can ask the jr pass counter in the airport to activate it at specific date). Which ends at sept 26 (when you already in tokyo). Buy suica for the rest of your trip (which around tokyo).\n\nSept 11: not sure if teamlab borderless already open at that time. But right now, it is closed and all you get is teamlab planets. Teamlab planets is in odaiba where you can see life sized gundam too.\n\nSept 12: try nakano broadway and ikebukuro, IMO, they are better than akihabara\n\n*If you gonna buy a lot of stuffs in akihabara, move it later when you come back to tokyo, so you won't bring too much stuffs when you move aroun japan.\n\n\n**You have so many empty days in tokyo, I recommend to grouped some together into one day and add in more, maybe disneysea and disneyland.",

The only thing is im closer to Akihabara in my first stay but youre right i should maybe wait on that. \n\nWould love some other suggestions for Tokyo! (we have disneysea there.) any thing else? :)",

                            "comment": "Teamlab borderless closed since august 2022, there is a rumour that it might open in autumn 2023. But if it is not open, then teamlab planets is your next best bet.\n\n\nFor osaka and kyoto, same with tokyo, some days are very empty. If you want, you can add few places.\n\nMy recommendations:\n\nIn osaka / kyoto\n\nDay trip to (or stay in) Hiroshima, people usually go to peace memorial museum and itsukushima shrine. If you stay in Hiroshima, I suggest to go to rabbit island Okunoshima. It is a bit far and need to cross by ferry, but who doesn't like island full of rabbits.\n\nFukuoka is birth place of many famous ramen. Ichiran, ippudo, ikkudo all are from this palce. So if you want to eat a lot of ramen, here is the place. They even have this place called ramen stadium where some famous shops open their brand there. Such as hide chan or nagahama no 1. You can also go to see life sized gundam (different type of gundam than in tokyo). It is very far though\n\nOsaka also have teamlab. It is called teamlab botanical and only opens at night (not sure if this is what you refer as botanical in your itinerary)\n\nShinsekai and tsutenkaku, other than dotonbori, these two places also offer the same thing as dotonbori and it is a short walk from dotonbori too. \n\nOsaka aquarium kaiyukan housed 2-3 whale sharks. There are others too such as sunfish, spider crab, dolphin, otter and penguins.\n\n\nDuring sept, you are in luck for halloween horror night at universal studio japan (since I saw you put nintendo world, that means you will go to USJ right?) It is included in your tickets and many attractions will be revamped into haunted houses. I went to halloween horror night USJ in 2018 and it was a blast, chucky, sadako, zombies, vampire, etc \n\n\nIn tokyo:\n\nDay trip to yokohama: famous for their chinatown, cup noodle museum and kirin beer brewery, cosmoworld theme park and moving gundam (you need to pay to see it though).\n\nDay trip to kawasaki, world shortest escalator, biggest book off (2nd hand items), toshiba museum, ajinomoto museum, and phallic shrine (kanayama shrine).\n\nDay trip to saitama, a lot of stuffs such as garden, biggest arcade in the world, etc\n\nDay trip to kamakura, a lot of shrines\n\nVr shibuya and joypolis also interesting (I went to joypolis one and it was super cool).\n\nVillage vanguard, filled with a lot of wacky stuffs.\n\nSanrio puroland if you like sanrio characters\n\nSkytree observatory deck and sumida aquarium\n\nSunshine city ikebukuro + sunshine aquarium\n\nArt aquarium ginza\n\n12 floors uniqlo at ginza\n\nWatch sumo fight\n\nThe decks odaiba floor 4 (I think) vintage arcade, vintage candies, old haunted house, lucky boxes, etc.\n\nBuy your souvenir at don quijote (go to mega donki, bigger one).\n\nBuy your souvenir at daisho\n\nSo many things to do that I might miss lol",

Even if you're not that bothered about going on rides, the theming alone is worth it.  The park is totally unique.  The food is also surprisingly good and not that pricey.  Alternatively, they also have evening passes which are less expensive if you just want to hop on a ride or two and see the park at night.",

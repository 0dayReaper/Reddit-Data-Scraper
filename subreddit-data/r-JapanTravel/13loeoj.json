I'm completely confused how this works as the office opens at 7.30am but I'll have to leave toyama around 6am I believe.\n\nI've had no luck finding answers elsewhere. \n\nThank you.",

You do not need to go to Tateyama Station to \"get\" your ticket. The agents at the gates will be able to sort you out, just show them a confirmation email or whatever information you have. I haven't taken that particular line since the station remodel so it may have other access points, but if you just plug in the Lotteria, you'll get close to it. It's not in the \"big\" part of the station, it's on the second floor, you access from the outside near ESTA.   \nHonestly, if you need some help and are nearby, let me know. I will be at the station to do some shopping in a bit! I can show you.",

Meaning, there are no reservations from Dentetsu-Toyama to Tateyama part of the journey. [This page](https://www.alpen-route.com/en/transport/ticket.html) gives a bit more insight to that...sort of.",

    "postText": "Hello \n\nThis is my second draft of the itinerary. I\u2019m going to Japan on early September (1st to 15th)  with my family. People usually comment on the heat, humidity and rain during these months but we are from Costa Rica so we live in that kind of weather all year long.\n\nWhat we have planned for the trip \n\n- Japan Rail Pass \n- eSIM with Ubigi \n- SUICA card \n\nItinerary \n\nDay 1 \n\n- Arrival at Narita at 6:30 am and have breakfast\n- Wait for JRPass until 8:30 am \n- Go to hotel and leave the luggage there \n- Sensoji\n- Meiji Jingu\n- Lunch \n- Tokyo Tower \n- Dinner in Harajuku \n\nDay 2\n\n- Train to Osaka, have breakfast at the station and then train to Hiroshima \n- Estimated arrival time at 1:00 or 2:00 pm \n- Go to hotel \n- Castle and Atomic Bomb Dome \n- Wander around the city \n\nDay 3 \n\n- Ferry to Mijayima \n- Spend all morning until lunch exploring the area \n- Back to Hiroshima to wander the city (maybe visit some museum) \n\nDay 4 \n\n- Train to Okayama or Himeji (small visit to the city of choice) \n- Train to Tottori estimated arrival at 3:00 pm \n- Tottori Sand Dunes and Museum  \n- Tottori Castle Ruins \n\nDay 5 \n\n- Conan Town and Museum \n- Conan Airport \n- Visit some Temples or go to Uradome or the Flowet Garden\n\nDay 6 \n\n- Train to Osaka \n- Osaka Tsutenkaku \n- Shinsekai \n\nDay 7 \n\n- Osaka Castle \n- Dotonburi \n- Shitennoji Temple \n- Namba Shrine \n\nDay 8 \n\nONE of various options:\n\n- Day at Universal Studio or \n\n- Day at the aquarium or \n\n- Day trip to Himeji or Kobe or Nara (Depends if we went to Himeji  before or not ) \n\nDay 9 \n\n- Train to Kyoto \n- Fushimi Inari \n- Kiyomizu Dera \n\nDay 10 \n\n- Arashiyama \n- Togetsukyo \n- Kinkakuji \n- Ryoanji \n\nDay 11 \n\n- Imperial Palace\n- Ginkakuji \n- Kodaiji \n\nDay 12 \n\n- Day trip to Nara or Nagoya (Depends if we go to Nara or not before) \n\nDay 13 \n\n- Train to Tokyo \n- Tokyo Dome Giants Game (big baseball fans, we checked and we will arrive in time for a double header that starts at 3:00 pm)\n\nDay 14 \n\n- Day Trip to Kamakura \n\nDay 15 \n\n- Ueno park \n- Wander around the city \n\nDay 16 \n\n- Flight back \n\n\nSmall clarification: I am not going directly to Hiroshima despite the fact that we arrive at 6:30 am.  because we will be coming from an early flight from Costa Rica to Mexico City and then a late night flight from Mexico City to Narita. I\u2019m sure we will be too tired to endure  another 6 hours travel and we will prefer to do tourism right away. \n\nQuestions: \n\n- Do you have any general comments or suggestions about the itinerary? \n\n- In the days we have not decided what to do yet, what would you suggest? Specially with the extra day in Osaka and Tottori, we are completely lost about it \n\n- In case we have some spare time during our visits, what other things would you suggest? \n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "have you bought your tickets already? I noticed it is a round trip via Tokyo? I personally would ask the airline to change your booking to Home country to Osaka then Tokyo to Home country. In the long tun, this is cheaper money and time-wise.\n\nhow many hotels have you booked? for Day 5 to 8, you can book a hotel in Osaka and go to all of them. I love Tottori and I would insist that you check that out. But you can spend a whole day in Day 5 in Totorri and then combine Himeji (morning) and Kobe (evening) for Day 6.\n\nSeptember is a weird no-longer-summer-but-it-isnt-autumn-yet. It is the last leg of monsoon season, so it may be humid but rainy at the same time. I would say, check out the Karasu Zumo festival at Kamigamo Shrine in Kyoto. Kids will be competing in sumo wrestling as part of the Shrine's festivities. Last time I saw that, no foreigners were with us.",

Same for Day 4. If you exhaust yourself, you will not be able to visit all places that you think are important for you to see. In my exierience, you book a Ryokan in the middle of your entire trip and spend an overnight just relaxing at an onsen. I spent 18 days in Hokkaido and Gifu last February. So I strategically put Gero (onsen town in Gifu) in the middle of that 18 day trip so I can replenish. I spent one night in a Ryokan, rented a private onsen, I had a massage, traditional dinner, and traditional breakfast. It was very rejuvenating.",

You'll want to eat okonomiyaki (savory pancakes) or oysters (though may be out of season); both of which Hiroshima is known for.\n\nFor Miyajima, go first thing in the morning before the crowds and be sure to check out the tide schedule.  We took the non-JR ferry (45 min from Peace Park), however, with your pass, you'll want to take the electric line to Miyajima guchi (55 min from Hiroshima) then a 10 min JR ferry.  You'll want to carry cash if you stop by the various shops &amp; street food vendors.  While most take cards, cash is especially handy here.  We did not lunch here, but filled up on various street foods.\n\nAnd while in Japan, 7-11s are awesome for ATM cash withdrawals and bathroom breaks (we went every day esp for the sandwiches, riceballs, snacks &amp; beverages).  Carry a handkerchief bc some restrooms don't have paper towels; some don't even have soap, so you'll want to carry a small bottle of soap and/or sanitizer.  Good luck, bon voyage &amp; enjoy your trip!",

            "comment": "I did a solo travel last March during cherry blossoms season with osaka &gt; tottori &gt; hiroshima &gt; kyoto &gt; nara\n\nSome insights from someone who got limited budget\n- there are lots of tourists in Japan right now so be prepared to wait in line for long periods of time. If you can do reservations in advance, please do so\n- I travel via bus only to save money. Also, there is no direct train route to Tottori using JR pass so you might need to drag your luggage accross stations. In the buses, you just put your luggage in the compartment and sit pretty while traveling. I reserved Nihon bus to Tottori and to Hiroshima, they are more comfortable to sleep in than the night bus imo\n- it was peak season when I was in Tottori but the streets are usually empty during the day. Plan where you want to eat or make reservations if you can. Most local restaurants do not have English menu / no English speaking staff so it was very hard to eat there. Those that have English menu gets fully booked early. For dinner, I got lucky on day 1, waited in line for almost an hour on day 2, and got in as early as 5:45pm for day 3\n- Do not mind if you only have one or two agenda in Tottori. You need to consider the bus and train schedules. Some of them are an hour apart. As an overthinker with not a lot of money, I spent most of my time waiting for bus/ train and looking for places where I can eat\n- IC card does not work in Tottori. Buses only accepts cash and you have to buy tickets from ticket machines for trains\n- For Conan Town, the direct train route from tottori station is only until around 8am and then resumes at around 2pm. In the hours in between, google will suggest to ride the limited express one which is very expensive (about 2k yen). I also asked tourist booth but they suggested to go to Conan Airport then to Conan town which costs around 4k yen in total. Just Google separately how to get to Kurayoshi station then how to get to yura station from there. This will only cost 860 yen\n- The tourist information booth at Tottori station is very helpful. I also got discounted tickets for the Sand Museum there\n- For day 3, you can try seeing Kintai Bridge and Iwakuni castle in the afternoon if you do not feel like hiking in the afternoon in Miyajima\n- Okonomimura in Hiroshima is a must!\n\nHope this helps!",

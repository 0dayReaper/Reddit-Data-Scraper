    "postText": "Will be traveling to Japan in June for 2.5 weeks an wanted to make sure that the last leg of the trip is feasible and see if I am allotting enough time in each place. I plan on traveling from Hiroshima to Kanazawa in the morning 6/16. We will have the 14 day JR pass so we will take the jr train from Hiroshima to Kanazawa which seems to take around 4hr and 15m. \n\nWe will stay in Kanazawa for 2 nights. On 6/16 and 6/17, we plan on sight seeing and checking out Kanazawa Castle, Nagamachi samurai district, Omicho Market, Ninja Weapon Museum, and Kenrokuen Garden. \n\nOn 6/18, I was planning on leaving Kanazawa in the morning by taking the jr train down to Takayama. From there, we will take the Hirayu Shihotaka Line and Kamikochi Line to Kamikochi. In total google maps says this will take around 4 hrs. \n\nWe plan on staying in Kamikochi for 2 nights. We wanted to do hikes in the area and plan on doing some of the shorter day hikes on 6/18 and 6/19. \n\nOn 6/20, I plan to take the Shin-Shimashima - Kamikochi Line and Matsumoto Dentetsu Kamikochi Line to Matsumoto where we will catch the Limited Express trains on the Chuo Line JR train back to Tokyo where we will spend the night of 6/20. In total this, this should take around 5hrs. Our flight back home is at around 4pm on 6/21. \n\nWas wondering if this plan is doable and if I'm overlooking anything here. This will be the first time Ive traveled to Japan so not super sure of what to expect and if the transportation on google maps is accurate and reliable to plan with. Thanks in advance",

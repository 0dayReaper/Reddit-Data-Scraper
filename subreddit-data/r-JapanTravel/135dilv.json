Probably a bit earlier in Tokyo than Kyoto.\n\nMt Fuji can be hit or miss as far as being visible or hidden by clouds.  Wishing you good luck.\n\nKyoto Station has an excellent information centre with English speakers.  I would visit there for an update on where to see autumn leaves.\n\nYou trip seems to be a cut and paste from official guides.  Nothing wrong with that but also check out some YouTube content to get a feel.\n\nI found the Imperial Palace and fish market not as good as expected.  Your view may vary.",

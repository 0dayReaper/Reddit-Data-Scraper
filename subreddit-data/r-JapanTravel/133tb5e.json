    "postText": "5'6\" 275lbs 39 year old male, traveling with my 6'4\" 260lbs husband.\n\nI didn't find many perspectives from large people prior to embarking so I felt I would contribute with my experience as I sit on my flight back across the Pacific.\n\nFirst off I was worried that I would get lots of stares, nasty looks, and outright discrimination from my largely trim hosts  While I'm not the most observant person, I found this to actually not be the case whatsoever.  I can't recall once getting a nasty look or comment from anyone.  I felt perfectly normal and I fit in completely fine.\n\nSecond, I found a lot of the spaces in restaurants, izakayas, public transport much smaller than usual, but perfectly fine to navigate.  I wasn't dissuaded from visiting anywhere because I wouldn't fit- though sitting on tatami mats several times for a tea ceremony and a meal proved incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nThird, it was dismaying, though certainly not unexpected, that I couldn't purchase clothing of any kind anywhere in Japan.  If I soiled a shirt at teppanyaki or after eating taco bell, I had to wear it on my shirt all day for everyone to see.  I couldn't rent a kimono/yukata and take cute pictures because I was too large, I couldn't buy any pokemon shirts at the Pokemon Center, or anything like that, either. That was a bit of a downer that might normally be overlooked.\n\nBut my final 'large person' observation is the biggest one of all, and that is that despite knowing full well ahead of time what I was in for, the sheer amount of walking and stair climbing and hiking was far, far too much for me, and it ultimately took a lot away from my trip.  Let me explain before everyone jumps on me for all the various reasons.\n\nWhen you book a hotel \"4 mins walking\" q(according to Google Maps) from Shinjuku station, it's actually more like 34.  I pick Shinjuku because while most people already know it is the busiest station on earth, you don't actually know how completely fucking labyrinthine this place is- or how most stations are- for that matter.  You have to leave many stations just to walk to another one where your connecting line is.  I don't know how Google Maps calculates its estimates but they are always WILDLY misleading for any newcomer to Japan.   It seems to assume that you can read every sign, can anticipate every single random hallway you enter thinking it's your exit, that there is no foot traffic, etc.  It must also assume that youre already at street level because it can be the only explanation for why it is always a 7 minute walk to your destination, but it's actually 30.\n\nAnd this is the case everywhere you go in the big cities.  You think it's 45 minutes to the Tokyo Dome from your hotel which is right next to Shinkuku Station (this is why you booked the hotel here, after all) but it's always- always an hour+.\n\nSo now you'd like to take a breather somewhere and just sit.  Think again!  There is scarcely a seat to be found ANYWHERE, least of public spaces like shrines or even parks and especially at the train stations.  The seats in restaurants are mostly small stools and tiny chairs and it doesn't seem to be any secret that you aren't meant to sit down anywhere.  It's a phenomenon that I don't understand but is clearly engrained in the Japanese culture\n\nNow for people who love walking and who are fit and love adventure, all of this may sound fun, even exhilarating to an extent.  But to a large person like me it was more agony and disheartenment as the day wore on, and this invariably affected my husband's enjoyment of his trip, which is the next thing I learned.  \n\nThe mismatch in activity levels between my partner and I sucked for both of us.  I found myself often becoming a hindrance to him because he would want to go out and do things while I simply couldn't bear it, and he felt like he was leaving me behind.  Obviously if you are traveling to Japan solo this point will be moot, but if you're traveling with anyone who insists on filling every second of their vacation with taking in all Japan has to offer, you're just not going to be able to keep up and you need to be ready for that reality.  Allow them the space to go out alone if they so wish and don't be ashamed or 'feel like you missed out' by staying at the hotel and chilling on your vacation if you need to.  \n\nSo that's my little bit of insight as to my experience as a large person visiting Japan.  I am so glad I went and saw all the amazing things I saw, and thankfull to live out a dream, but I just probably wouldn't visit again because the difficulty came too close to outweighed (no puns, please) the reward.",

            "comment": "All stations have special exits. Your exit will determine if you have to walk five minutes or thirty. If you've been there a while, you'll get to the point where you actually know which train car to choose, so that you're as close to your exit as possible.\n\nUnless you know the station well, do NOT \"just get out\" and hope to figure out where you're going. Youll walk literal miles in big stations. \n\nYou can also choose smaller stations nearby your destination., such as Higashi/Nishi/Minami Shinjuku instead of Shinjuku. Station exits tend to be roughly ten minutes walk apart from each other. Sometimes, that guarenteed three-to-five (at most ten) extra minutes is worth avoiding the chaos of a larger station, especially during rush hour, or otherwise the 30+ minute wander of shame.\n\nYou also learn what exits are a five minute walk uphill versus an eight minute walk downhill. For example, Omotesando is a great choice for someone who wants to explore the fancier streets of Harajuku but doesn't want to walk uphill after going through Takeshita.",

There is absolutely no way you can plan in advance for what you'll encounter in any decently large station.  You have A gates 1-30, then you have B, C, and D gates, half of which go missing midway through your escapade.  Then, you leave the station to hit a JR station, and you get turned around by GPS and you go the wrong way for a while before you go a different way.  Absolutely unplannable... you just have to learn it.",

Videos on Airport to/from an area.\n\nAgain, most of these Station walking videos were from 4-6 years ago. I'm sure they're still useful. I think his most recent \"station\" video was 2 years ago showing the opening of the new East and West Exits in Shinjuku Station. Just scroll all the way down until you find the Station ones.\n\nHe doesn't do these now, mainly walking videos of gardens and parks. But even those peaked my interest and have gone to some pre-covid. And noted some to visit for my 6th trip to Japan this Fall. I actually downloaded his videos on my first 2 trips to help me walk around Shinjuku and felt comfortable walking around in and out of the Shinjuku Station area.\n\nHis youtube channel:  JapanBackpackersXpress",

I just returned from my first trip to Japan, also stayed in Shinjuku for the first leg (wouldn't really recommend this in hindsight), and when we put directions in Google maps and followed them exactly, they were really accurate for us for trip duration IF we entered and exited via the exact exit #s they instructed. The issue is following these step by step instructions and not just entering or exiting the station wherever you please. I thought the stations were all certainly busy, and sometimes a bit of a maze but found them navigable and was shocked at how much English signage and announcements there were. I also live in Philadelphia and have lived in NYC so I am used to busy train stations too which may have helped.",

                            "comment": "In my experience about 99% of anxiety surrounding the stations is actually having to get home (your hotel or wherever). I suggest finding a major station along the yamanote line (the above ground line that runs in a circle around Tokyo) that runs directly through a line of your \"home\" station and you'll never really be lost. Every line in Tokyo runs through a yamanote station somewhere.\n\nAs far as knowing the exit or station, I suggest Google maps! Kanji that is good to know would be:\n\n\u51fa\u53e3 exit\n\u5357 south\n\u5317 north\n\u6771 east\n\u897f west\n\nOften when used as an exit it will show as \u6771\u53e3\n\nReally I look for the direct location that I'm looking for (for example I will look up a specific store or place, NOT an area), and then ill search the surroundings to see which exits or stations are nearby that aren't the big ones. I will then plan my route to that station, and walk to my destination.\n\nAlways get an ic card as tickets are awful and the prices are not listed in English. People say \"suica\". The truth of the matter is there are fifty thousand different ones based on region and who owns the line. Don't worry, they all work. A suica will work in a sugoca region. It does not matter to tourists what card you use and where.\n\nIf you're like me and you like to meander, you can also scan Google maps to find hidden gems, and plan yourself a longer walk to see some cool stuff.\n\nAlso just give yourself an extra 10-20 minutes with your commute since you are in a new place. You never know if something happens with the train either and it delays. The train delays will be read overhead in Japanese and sometimes written in multiple languages on a screen above the door in the train, but the information is always available in English on the website of the corresponding company. For Tokyo, that would be JR east, Tokyo metro, and Toei bus company (they own lines too). You can literally Google \"Tokyo metro train status\" and find the link.",

You essentially pay a flat rate for a route and you get unlimited use of that route during that time. They didn't care where you stopped along the way or how you got around within the route specified. I believe anyone can get one, but it may not be worth it to tourists, depending on where you are. Depending on how long you're staying and where your hotel is, it might be worth it to get a one month pass. You do NOT need documentation. \n\nI lived out near Toshimaen and commuted to near shibuya every day, which was like 45 minutes on the \"seibu- fukutoshin/yurakucho line\". If I hit a double express I maybe saved 15-20 minutes but if my commute didn't plan out perfectly, I'd easily gain back that time waiting for the express. I considered them a fun little surprise on occasion, as I had a schedule where I never seemed to make it on time. \n\n\nStandard expresses are not to be confused with the bullet trains or what I will dub the \"airport express\" trains. Those often require a ticket and/or reserved seat and only leave out of certain stations. I'd say bullet trains city to city are not worth it (you can get a plane ticket from Tokyo to Osaka for half the price and time), but the airline express tickets (especially to Narita) are worth it if you have a certain timed flight or have heavy luggage.",

Similarly, your experience with Google maps makes a ton of sense. \n\nYou do learn the system over time, such as identifying in advance how to get to the exit you need. But yes, for the newcomer, budgeting an extra 15 min (or more) just to make your way through bigger stations makes sense. \n\nI\u2019m glad you braved the physically demanding streets to explore. You do get used to it, it\u2019s a workout. By a few weeks you do get stronger. But regardless of your weight, depending on your fitness, expect to find yourself needing rest (and not finding a place to sit) when exploring the city. \n\nThe advice just to chill and enjoy your hotel room or maybe a nearby cafe is a very good one. Nothing beats sitting in a Tokyo cafe with an iced coffee and a few books or magazines for a few hours. The parks are also perfect for this, if the weather cooperates (which it almost never does\u2026)\n\nI do hope you come back and explore Tokyo again on your own terms. Over the years I\u2019ve developed habits, like just stopping into one of the many generic British-style pubs just for one drink, or a revolving sushi joint just for a few plates just to sit and recharge for a bit. During off-hours, these places are often fairly empty, and just partaking slowly (but reasonably) is very comfortable. Back in the day, the video game arcades were great for stopping and sitting for an hour or so. The best way to enjoy Tokyo, IMHO, is just to enjoy being in Tokyo.",

It's one reason I tell anyone who comes to visit here to no overbook their activities. My best friend had a similar experience of getting disheartened by all the walking he wasn't used to. Keep in mind that people here don't typically walk to and go to so many places every day, trying to cram in as much sightseeing as possible either. Japan is awesome, and your first trip can be amazing, but I do encourage anyone who comes to either give yourself lots of rest time in between or just plan fewer stops so that the walking doesn't ruin your impression and enjoyment.",

I guess Ill have to challenge and train myself to at least 15k steps slowly before my travels. Good tip on the Google map distances too! I should probably double or triple.",

London gave me some trouble as there is a fair bit of walking and far fewer escalators in the actual stations than in Tokyo, but as far as size...the difference between Waterloo and Shinjuku is like the difference between the Earth and the Sun.  It's just stupidly crazily bigger.  There are whole cities underground around these stations with full on miles of restaurants, Family Marts, claw machine stores, you name it!  Oh! Don't forget there isn't just Shinjuku station there are also a bunch of 'Nishi-Shinjukus' just to confuse you even more lol.  All I have to say is thank God Tokyo isn't hilly!",

Allow them the space to go out alone if they so wish and don't be ashamed or 'feel like you missed out' by staying at the hotel and chilling on your vacation if you need to. \n\nI don't think that's weight related.

There's someone in my group with mobility issues, and we just take the day as it comes. We're doing like 1-2 things a day max. This might not be the most efficient use of time and money, but it's the best we can do and it's still amazing.\n\nThe 1-2 things a day method works great for me personally too since I have debilitating ADHD and doing more than one thing a day even back home is pretty pain inducing.\n\nI think maybe if you come with everything planned out and you're not hitting your expectations, you're going to be pretty sad. And that goes for everyone not just people with mobility issues.",

Someone might disagree with me but the fact is my wife and I stumbled upon lots of stuff that wasn\u2019t on any map or list of things to see or do so even if we went above our usual 20-25k steps a day, had we not turned here or went down those steps, we wouldn\u2019t have seen it anyways. \n\nBest bet is to just accept that you can only do what you can and be happy with what you do and you\u2019ll continue having a great time and not worry about the concept of wasting time:)",

For example I booked an owl cafe for 2pm and Kirby Cafe for 430 pm on the same day.  We missed the owl Cafe completely due to Google maps fucking our time royally up, and we almost missed Kirby Cafe for the same reason PLUS not knowing what a cluster fuck the Tokyo Skytree is.  Luckily they were accommodating when we showed up 20 mins late.  But yes, plans were constantly in flux due to varying circumstances so please give yourself an extra 45 mins EVERYWHERE!",

I've lived in Tokyo for over 5 years and speak Japanese.  If I had an appointment someplace new, and I went alone, I'd budget to get there about 10 min early.\n\nIf I were meeting friends from the US there, and I know they'll be fine taking the trains on their own (e.g., they've already been in Tokyo for a few days) and they don't need any special accommodation (i.e., no kids, are comfortable with lots of walking, stairs, etc.), I'd budget 20-30 minutes.  Because even then people get lost.  People take time to find the right exit.\n\nIf I were dealing with anyone who needed some additional accommodation -- 30 to 45 minutes makes sense to me.  I'm not going to rush my guests when they're still figuring out the train system, or if they'd benefit from sitting for a moment in a cafe or the like.\n\nThese time estimates include the fact that I can guide them once we meet at our destination train station.  If my friends were coming on their own, OPs experiences and advice makes a ton of sense to me.",

We planned the trip according to the physical abilities of the least able person. We planned only one major activity per day, with anything else a bonus. We hired a guide with a vehicle in Kyoto/Uji/Osaka to minimize walking. We took taxis for some travel when we otherwise would have walked (this added to the budget). The person with limitations was prepared with a tablet/book to amuse herself in the hotel so the rest of us could go out if we spent the morning doing a lot of walking and she needed to rest. We had to identify the nearest elevator in every subway/train station when we ordinarily would not have used elevators. We had to plan our luggage so that two of us could carry all the luggage in case the elderly people were tired or in the few cases where using stairs was required. \n\nMentally adjust to being OK with some solo adventuring if only one person has the energy to do something and wants to go out - I\u2019m a person who loves some alone time so I really enjoyed going solo here and there. Part of your enjoyment of the trip can be deriving satisfaction from the other person getting to see what they want to see even if you can\u2019t accompany them.",

            "comment": "Sorry about your experience in Japan. Everyone seems to underestimate how much walking and stairs are involved. I don't think the time estimates are quite that bad, but the stations can be quite complicated. \n\nGeneral advice for stations, figure out what exit numbers you can use. Before you even leave the train platform, make sure you are heading in a direction for those exits. Once you get off the platform or leave the gate and you end up in the wrong part of a station, things can get lot more complicated. Take the time look at the signs, it will save walking time. (Osaka is far worse for long transfers)\n\nSitting can be a problem. Look for department stores and take the escalator up a couple floors. Find coffee shops or cafes to rest at. Some of the areas to sit at you may not have even recognized as we have some odd shapes to prevent people from sleeping there. Living here I know where to go, but in the tourist areas seating can be difficult outside of stores. Also, take taxis when it's appropriate. Especially for short trips that involve getting to a station, stairs, waiting for and standing in trains then more walking to get back out to your destination.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d 300 lbs. I\u2019d been to Japan once in the mid 2000\u2019s when I was in my 20\u2019s (I\u2019m now 42). I experienced the horrors of this the first time, blisters, sore everything, etc.\n\nUnfortunately I stayed a large guy. I started planning for my trip in October of 2022 and went for almost the same time you were there, april 14-28. When I booked everything in October I started on a weight loss plan and over the intervening months I went from 340 to 300. I had intentions of adding lots of walking into the mix but it was winter and cold and I never really did get to it.\n\nSo, first good thing I did was lose 10% of my body mass (i packed on some pounds during Covid).\n\nNext was getting the right equipment. I went to a local running/fitness shoe place and had my feet modeled and purchased a pair of Hoka walking shoes with the highest level of comfort. Contrary to what you hear breaking these in we\u2019re not necessary. Believe it or not shoes like this are only good for like 300ish miles of use before not offering the support they used to.\n\nNext: socks. For those people not used to exertion (like me), I talked to my doctor and researched online and I invested in about 7 pairs of 15-25 mmHg compression socks for 3 reasons: 1) I\u2019m on some meds that can cause clots and my flight over was 16 hours and these help prevent them 2) I read they really help with extending your endurance (there\u2019s a reason why athletes use them and 3) it helps with sore muscle recovery. I will stress here **that these were 90% most likely my secret to my success**. It was like night and day over regular socks. Seriously if you\u2019re going to Japan buy some and use them every day you will definitely notice a difference.\n\nNext: blister prevention. I noticed in the airports and flight over I was getting a few hotspots in my shoes, but I was prepared. I bought these Teflon things to go back on tbe heels of my shoes that smoothed out the interface between my heels and the shoes to stop friction based blisters from happening. I highly recommend doing this, if you\u2019re prone to this issue. I\u2019d always been highly prone to blisters on my heels. This + the smooth compression socks knocked this problem out completely.\n\nSo, you\u2019ve gotten the equipment sorted, and tried a little to prep your body (or not, that part is up to you). Next is a regimen of self care.\n\nEvery night it was: get back from eating dinner, disrobe, bathe in the Japanese fashion. That is, take a shower to wash yourself off and cleanse everything, then fill up the deep bath with the hottest water you can stand and soak in it (making sure your entire lower legs are submerged) for 15-30 minutes. Out of the bath, take an NSAID of your choice. I had to go with aspirin because I mistakenly only packed excessive migraine and strangely couldn\u2019t get ibuprofen at the drug store. Then just relax and wind down and sleep.\n\nThis regimen + the equipment + the prep made me feel like literal superman. I could go all day. I would get up in the morning, walk all morning in my neighborhood of choice, sit down and rest at lunch for an hour, then stand up and go all afternoon, dinner, then wind down regimen. I did stop every now and then where I could to rest if I needed a minute but for some reason had no issue finding places for that? Also there\u2019s always sitting on the train. Lots of bus riding in Kyoto too and lots of the stops have benches there as well.\n\nThe piece de resistance for me though? One of the big reasons I finally decided to be brave and take this trip was because over Covid I heard about the walk from Magome-juku to Tsumago-juku along the Nakasendo trail. Everything I did was to give myself the best chance of doing this hike. I planned it for the first half of my trip, and it was the best experience of my life, even if the first 40% of it felt like I was walking up the side of a mountain. It\u2019s like 6 miles from town to town over a mountain pass, and I did it, and my feet and legs survived (I did end up taking an easier day the next day to recover but that was kind to be of expected after a 10+ mile day).\n\nAs far as google maps I luckily didn\u2019t have much issue with them and after got into the groove it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nSo yeah, as a large person, it\u2019s definitely doable as long as you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into and are prepared.",

I went to Japan as a decently fit high schooler and I still found the lack of seating combined w all the walking to be exhausting. Especially since we were there in the summer. My feet were beat tf up at the end, and god almost everyone on my trip got heat stroke once. I think most Americans needs to be cautious about not biting off more itinerary than they can chew, or prepare to pay more in cab fair. Especially on top of the jet lag, the exhaustion can catch up to you fast.",

At least in my mind It wouldn't make much sense to walk 20 miles a day to prepare myself for Japan only to come back and then give it all back.  Luckily my partner and I have traveled enough to know each other's limitations and we thankfully mesh well in this regard.  We definitely don't hold each other back and we don't frustrate each other.  \n\nUsing the word fault is really off-base, I totally respect and appreciate that this is their culture. I'm a guest in their country.  However coming from a different culture myself I don't understand it.  I respect it but I don't understand it.  That is my 'fault' and my fault alone.\n\nAnd I probably wouldn't visit again given my current condition.  It's just too hard to be quite honest.",

My husband and I knew there'd be a lot of walking prior to our first trip so given that we weren't the most athletic people, average weight but not in shape, we \"trained\" for several months leading up. This involved everyday going to the gym and walking for at last an hour straight. Didn't help.\n\nAfter one week in Japan we were absolutely spent and I was developing a grudge against the lack of public seating. Part way through week 2 we were in Osaka and lo next to a random stoplight was a bench just large enough for one person to sit on. It was heavily graffitied which was weird as we hadn't seen graffiti anywhere else around. There weren't any signs saying it was like an art exhibit or anything. Just this tiny solitary bench.\n\nI insisted we stop so I could and I quote \"take a picture of the only public bench in all of Japan\". I will forever remember this bench.",

The 2 big problems I had with google maps was if you needed to transfer trains on a line, like when I was on the Asakusa line to Yokohama, it adamantly told you to stay on board, almost ended up at Haneda. The other thing was it would tell you the fastest route possible, not the most practical which caused a lot of headaches as it would walk us 17 minutes through the rain when while time wise it would've been longer, if we'd stayed on one more station, the walk would've been shorter and under cover half the way.",

            "comment": "I was also going to do a similar post and I am grateful that you did.\n\nI stayed near Ikebukuro station in Tokyo, maybe 3-5 minutes from C3 exit which is one of the farthest exits.  It doesn\u2019t have an escalator, unlike C6 which is nearer to the turnstiles but left me more exposed to the early springtime weather.  As a person weighing ~200 lbs it wasn\u2019t much easier for me to trek the 10 or so minutes from turnstile to the exits, up the stairs and the last few meters to the hotel.  Especially after doing 15-20k steps the whole day.  Many times I wished for the power to teleport because of how tired I was.\n\nPlus, this station is busy, being on the Yamanote line, though far less than Shinjuku.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this experience has put you off from probably visiting again.  I definitely got less enjoyment from exploring because I opted to just go home and rest instead of staying out hopping across night spots like I imagined doing.  That is just the reality we have to face, and somehow mitigate.  Sometimes we just learn on the fly how we can cope better, or we learn where to draw the line.",

            "comment": "Activity level mismatch is a real thing and I've never really experienced it until recently.\n\nI've been to Japan multiple times. My friend (who is very sedentary and overweight) wanted to visit Japan for the first time, so I let her plan the trip. Unfortunately, like you, she vastly underestimated the amount of walking and stairs that were required for this type of trip.\n\nFor the record, 5km is a decent but nice walk for me. Walking 20km in a day is fine for me. On one day in Japan, we were on the train for the better part of the morning, so we estimated we walked around 7-8km. She exclaimed about how far we walked and how tired she was. I think my face betrayed my surprise because 7-8km in an entire day isn't a lot for me. If anything, I still wanted to take an evening walk before going to bed because I still had energy.\n\nWe decided on spending some days doing separate things, which was the best for us in the end. I think we were both a lot happier on those days because we were able to go at our own (very different) paces without feeling held back (me) or feeling too exhausted and sore to be enjoy the trip (my friend).\n\nTL;DR if you are traveling with someone with very different activity levels, be prepared to do your own things sometimes for everyone's happiness.",

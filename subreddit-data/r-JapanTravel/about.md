Description:

Got questions? Need advice? Overwhelmed with your itinerary? Want to share your travel tips and experiences in Japan? Then this is the place for you! /r/JapanTravel is for any and all looking to visit Japan as a tourist â€” including those who have already been.

Rules:

Posts must relate to travel and tourism inside Japan.: **This subreddit is intended for those traveling as a tourist within Japan.** General posts about travel, airlines, airports, accommodations should be posted in r/travel or r/flights. Posts about living in Japan, whether temporarily or permanently belong in either r/movingtojapan, r/teachinginjapan, or r/japanlife. Translation requests should be posted in r/translator. Posts that belong in other subreddits will be removed or redirected. General discussion posts are welcome in /r/JapanTravelTips.

No low effort posts.: No low effort posts. Be specific in your questions. Include information such as where you're starting, your dates of travel, budget, interests, or things you like. This information can have a significant impact on the suggestions the community provides. Also include prior research into the topic. Posts that contain minimal information ("Where should I go?"), excessively broad questions ("Tips for Tokyo?"), or other low effort / karma-gleaning posts ("I miss Japan!") will be removed.

Itinerary posts must be identified and detailed.: Itinerary posts must be clearly identified in their titles, and they must include more information than dates and general location. It is not the job of this subreddit to fill the gaps in your itinerary for you, so please give daily plans and activities when providing your itinerary. Itinerary posts must have sufficient supporting information and specific questions so that the community can help. Any itinerary post that does not meet these requirements will be removed.

No posts that primarily focus on individual establishments or services.: The review sections of aggregator sites such as TripAdvisor, Yelp, Expedia, Tabelog, etc. have better and more up-to-date information and recommendations on individual establishments or services such as travel agencies, booking agencies, lodgings, restaurants, shops, etc. Specific questions within larger posts (such as itineraries) are allowed, as are questions regarding accommodating the special needs of a person (e.g. wheelchair-accessible bathrooms, guide dogs) or in case of emergencies.

No self promotion.: This includes advertising business services you are directly connected to.  If you want to submit your own content, its primary goal should be to drive or jumpstart discussion on r/JapanTravel. (A example of this is a trip report that includes links to photo albums hosted on a third party site.) If the primary outcome of your post, regardless of your original intent, is to drive traffic to your blog/vlog/Instagram/portfolio/etc., your post will be removed.

No standalone meet-up request posts.: Meet-up requests for tourists or transient travelers are only allowed in the official Meet-Up Megathread stickied at the top of the sub. A new thread is automatically created each month, so please keep meet-up related posts limited to the thread that corresponds to the month you'll be visiting Japan.

No solicitation posts.: This includes souvenir/merchandise purchase requests, accommodation/restaurant booking requests, service provider/tour guide requests, survey or crowdsourcing requests, event ticket purchasing requests, or location photo/video requests. The only exception to this rule is that we allow ticket resale in the monthly meet-up megathread only. Posts that violate this rule will be removed.

No "meta" posts about this subreddit.: No "meta" posts about this sub. (i.e., "Why do people post the same itineraries all the time?") No PMs to individual mods about removed comments or posts. Problems or questions should be directed to moderators via the modmail interface.

Keep content legal and PG-13 rated.: We do not allow posts seeking information on illegal activities, circumventing laws in Japan, or adult entertainment services, nor do we allow comments encouraging illegal, questionable, or otherwise dangerous behavior. Please refrain from discussions regarding adult-oriented topics, such as sex tourism, drugs, gambling, etc.

Be civil.: Posts and comments should be polite and helpful. Harassment of other users or mods, trolling, posting of users' personal information, repeated intentional rule breaking, hijacking other users' threads to complain about concerns with the sub or mods, or other general unsavory behavior will be met with bans. We take this rule very seriously, and will enforce it as necessary to keep up the quality of information in this sub.

Trip reports are welcome on this subreddit.: If you are going to share your experience by writing a trip report, review, or guide, please make sure you do so in an organized and detailed fashion. Such posts should be made as text posts only, with any photos or relevant external content linked within the post, and they should contain personal experiences and opinions about sights, activities, and traveling within Japan.

Trips reports must be personal and about activities.: Trip reports must be focused on personal input and opinions regarding activities, sights, and experiences in Japan. Posts that primarily focus on general tips will be either considered low-effort or invited to repost in /r/JapanTravelTips.

No standalone posts about border policy or visas allowed.: Per our policy, we don't allow standalone visa-related or border policy questions. You are free to discuss related issues in our weekly discussion threads, however, we recommend directly contacting your local Japanese embassy or consulate for accurate information. Comments on how to skirt visa, immigration, or customs rules will be removed and the authors may be banned.

    "postText": "Hi there, just looking for some Kyushu advice.\n \nI previously lived in Japan but somehow never made it down there, so I\u2019m hoping to remedy that with an upcoming trip. I\u2019m planning to visit some friends and do the Shimanami Kaido over 4 days, but then for the Kyushu leg of the trip I\u2019m looking at either 5 or 8 nights.\n \nI\u2019m a big fan on onsen, temples, history, and food, so anything in that vein is right up my alley, but mostly just happy to be back in Japan after COVID and could happily coast by just walking around.\n \nDoes my plan look feasible? If it\u2019s too rushed I\u2019ll probably cut Korea and spend a more relaxing time in Kyushu.\n \nPlan:\n\n\u2605    Nagasaki \u2013 3 nights\n\nNot sure if this will be too long but it\u2019ll basically be two full days directly after we do the Shimanami Kaido so it\u2019ll include some rest time, atomic museum, dejima, china town, and hopefully Nagasaki Kunchi as we\u2019ll be there in October.\n\n\u2605    Kumamoto \u2013 1 night\n\nBasically just for the Castle and Lafcadio Hearn\u2019s house \u2013 is it worth just visiting as a half day stopover?\n\n\u2605    Kurokawa Onsen OR Beppu \u2013 1 night\n\nIf we just did a stopover in Kumamoto or two nights in Nagasaki could we maybe fit both in?\nPossibly fitting in Mt Aso in between?\n \nPLUS\n\u2605    Sneaky Busan trip \u2013 3 nights\n\nOR\n\n\u2605    Beppu  \u2013 2 nights\n\n\u2605    Fukuoka - 1 night or return to Tokyo earlier\n\nHonestly I\u2019m not super interested in visiting Fukuoka. It seems like it\u2019s more of a great place to live rather than visit. But if its highly recommended I would happily visit.\n\n\nEdit: since someone brought it up in the comments I\u2019d also love to get some opinions about my Shimanami Kaido plans. \n\nDay 1. Train from Osaka to Imabari, bike to Omishima in afternoon\n\nDay 2. Travel to Okunoshima, stay overnight\n\nDay 3. Boat back to Omishima, Bike to Ikuchijima\n\nDay 4. Bike to Onomichi, travel onto Nagasaki\n\nI\u2019m mostly worried about having enough time on Day 1 to get to Omishima, and then being able spend enough time on Okunoshima. Could I comfortably get all the way there in one day from Imabari?",

I found the city really enjoyable with much to see and it has quite a few options for day trips as well (e.g. Shimabara peninsula and Unzen onsen). I wouldn't have minded even staying 4 nights there. Fukuoka can be skipped IMO. I also really enjoyed Kagoshima, especially cycling around Sakurajima.\n\nGenerally staying just 1 night *anywhere* always feels rushed to me. As I'll have to travel on both days, it never feels like I can properly arrive and take my time to explore.",

Atomic bomb park is a bit out of the way from the center, so many historical sites were spared. If you're into more niche stuff, you can check out the various sites linked to Sakamoto Ryoma or the shogunate final years. You also have a couple industrial sites from Meiji era.\n\nIf you add the surroundings, have a car, and as you said interested in history, the former christian sites near Sotome are well worth it.  Also, you'll have Unzen, Shimabara peninsula, Hara castle ruins, etc.\n\nHonestly, the history in and around Nagasaki is infinitely more interesting and varied than what you'll see around Kumamoto (which is probably more \"accessible\" for a quick visit with its sceneries).",

I agree with your assessment on Fukuoka too, nice city but there's not really anything interesting for tourists - especially if you've lived in Japan before! I did half a day in Kumamoto just for the castle and thought that was fine. Beppu is nice too, and nearby Yufuin is a nice little onsen town if you want to stay somewhere a bit more rural.\n\nAlso, apologies because you didn't ask for any feedback on it but I couldn't help but notice - four days seems really long for the Shimanami Kaido. If you've already planned it out then just ignore me though!",

But I suppose it depends on your general level of fitness - I'm fairly in shape but not a hardcore cyclist or anything and did it in one day pretty easily, arrived at like 4pm or so. It depends how leisurely you want to take it, but I don't think you need any more than two days for the Shimanami Kaido itself (excluding Okunoshima). \n\nNagasaki is pretty far away though, so maybe an extra day will help you out.

As u/sloppyrock mentions below, Yufuin is a much nicer place to stay in the area and if you're driving, the drive from Beppu to Yufuin, especially the last stretch, is really scenic.\n\nKurokawa Onsen is surely a must do if you're a fan of onsen and can be a decent base for exploring other areas as day trips, such as the Kuju Mountains, Mt Aso etc.\n\nIn southern Oita you also could visit Usuki for the stone buddhas.\n\nMiyazaki is also worth visiting - Takachiho for sure.\n\nYou might also consider the Kunisaki Peninsula in North Eastern Oita, especially if you're interested in temples and enjoy hiking.",

It is the most convenient of the Nagasaki Remote Islands (30min flight from Nagasaki City) or (1 hour Jetfoil from Fukuoka. The cheapest travel option is the ferry from Fukuoka (2 and a half hours but only around 3,000 yen). I think there may be a lot of sites that are of interest to you! It could easily be tacked on as a side trip between Nagasaki and Fukuoka as well.\r  \n\\- History (one of the largest Yayoi era ruins in Japan (Harunotsuji Ruins), extensive museum showing artifacts excavated from numerous Yayoi ruins, kofun etc. (Ikikoki Museum)), there are several kofun that you can actually go inside\r  \n\\- Shinto - some of the oldest shrines in all of Japan are located here. My personal favorite is Ondake shrine, a matchmaking shrine with over 250 stone monkey statues) and Ryuda Shrine (a beautiful ocean-side shrine to a dragon god believed to protect fishermen.) Tsukiyomi shrine is also extremely ancient and Iki shrine and Sumiyoshi shrines are also very beautiful, and historically significant shrines.\r  \n\\- Onsen - There is an onsen village called Yunomoto in western Iki with several day-visit onsen. The water here is very rich in iron so it appears brown in color. I highly recommend Hirayama ryokan for its traditional atmosphere and rotenburo. You can also purchase a yu-meguri pass to try several onsen here).\r  \n\\- Food - There is amazing sushi on the island that is shockingly cheap. I highly recommend either Nomoto in the southern part of the island or Hougetsu in the north. At both of these you can have an amazingly fresh, delicious nigiri or sashimi set for around the 2,000 yen price point which is crazy cheap. Yakiniku Gou in the Gonoura area has excellent Iki Beef and squid. There are also a huge number of really great cafes on Iki so I also highly recommend a cafe-meguri (D.D. Cafe in Gonoura and Cafe De Luddy and Tono Cafe in Katsumoto are some of my favorites).\n\nI'm happy to give more recommendations if you're interested!",

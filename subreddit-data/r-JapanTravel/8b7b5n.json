    "postText": "I am a Japan travel specialist, working in the luxury, very high end category. This post is intended to offer some advice to those heading to Japan who want to eat out at the top/famous restaurants particularly but is (I hope) useful advice for all.\n\nA lot of our clients come to us with long lists of restaurants they want us to book for them and ask for reservations to be made for each night. They do this fully intending to cancel some of them nearer the time but like to have the bookings in place. This is especially true of clients from the US.\n\nThis sort of approach leads to a lot of problems and I want to explain why.\n\nIn the US, it seems, it is perfectly normal and acceptable to make restaurant reservations and then cancel. I don't know how the restaurant trade in the US feels about this but in Japan, it is not at all the way things are done and it definitely leads to bad feelings and closed doors. \n\nThis year alone, we have been told by 3 separate restaurants that they will no longer accept reservations from foreign tourists because of so many cancellations. Many restaurants in Japan are small and the chef will plan and prepare based on the number of reservations he has each night. If clients cancel, this either means wasted food or empty seats, neither of which are good for them.\n\nOf course everyone understands that sometimes reservations have to be cancelled when there's an unavoidable reason but we see so many clients who ask us to book and then cancel because they no longer feel like going or another restaurant was available. This approach may well be fine back home but in Japan, it is considered very poor manners and bewilders the owners/chefs because they cannot understand why foreigners behave like this.\n\nOf course I know that food and eating out is a major reason for many people going to Japan and that's great. All I want visitors to understand is that there is a *very* different culture and perspective in regard to reservations so if you book a table, while thinking at the back of your mind that you may well cancel later if something better comes up or if you just don't feel like it on the day, you are not only being extremely rude, you are potentially ruining the chances of any other foreign visitor going to that restaurant at a later date.\n\nTLDR: Please don't try to prebook meals for every night of your trip to Japan and please don't make reservations unless you definitely want to eat at that restaurant because cancellations are bad for everyone.\n\n*PS: Please don't PM me asking about booking restaurants for you!*\n\n",

Those hotels are clearly aware of the possibility of cancellation, and would charge you if you do cancel. In my opinion, it\u2019s fair game to use those hotels as backups.\n\nHowever, I wouldn\u2019t do this with any accommodations that provide meals to you, especially ryokans. Those establishments are facing the same issue as restaurants, and it would be extremely rude for me a traveller to cancel.",

It hurts other customers who are looking for accommodation because you have booked several places (fully intending to cancel all, if not all but one of them), which means those places aren't available to those other travelers.  As a result, they may end up booking a place farther away / less nice, and be unable to switch when you finally do cancel; or they may not go at all because they can't find accommodation.",

Most if not all of them specify compensation you are entitled to if they don't have a room for you, mainly a comparable room at a nearby hotel (doesn't have to be within the brand), plus points or some other form of compensation.

Obviously there are exceptions but they are in the minority when compared to the vast number of Olive Gardens and other \u201chigher end\u201d chains.  Because of this a \u201ccorporate\u201d attitude has been adopted by the majority of diners in America.  In general, food service in America is a \u201ccustomer is always right\u201d situation... unfortunately.   Small kitchen, chef owned and operated establishments are the exception in America, at least by my experience and this seems to be almost inverted in Japan.  ",

There are certainly areas where \u201cfamily owned\u201d or local chains are widespread and the cookie cutter cheesecake factories and fast food are less popular.  \nI don\u2019t really think the shocking abundance of \u201ccorporate food\u201d is the only reason Americans tend to cancel dinner reservations when visiting Japan.  There is a prevalent attitude in American dining of \u201cservant and entitled\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m paying you for a service to take care of ME because I paid you are somehow below me.\u201d  So a lack of humbleness, respect and gratitude to food service professionals and their establishments is pervasive.  There is very little honor from the outside in food service in America, the jobs are not viewed as very respectable/successful.  \nWe Americans (that are not \u201cfoodies\u201d or have been in the industry) really only respect our dining experience during the holidays where we really stop to be respectful and thankful for our food and cherish the process of preparing it.  \nThat\u2019s why Americans bail on reservations and they do it in the US too.... and it\u2019s a shame!",

I also added a response to the OP but it really depends on the restaurant in the US on how they handle reservations.  Certain US restaurants, usually with a pre-fixe menu only will ask for a credit card deposit to protect the chef from planning their menu.  For other restaurants that are quite popular with no pre-fixe menu, reservations just secure a table and favor an organized patron.  If those reservations are canceled, the restaurant has no problem supplying them to walk-in customers (if they are that good, you will usually get walk-in's inquiring if a table is available).\n\nIf there is no pre-fixed menu, what is the negative consequence to the restaurant in Japan?  I would not do this as a visitor to Japan but I'm wondering what is the backlash to the restaurant?  After 10 mins, just give the table up.\n\nJust to add, in the hotel industry, some hotel sites lets you cancel your booking within 24hrs for hotels all over Japan.  Somehow they have accepted this function, why not restaurants?  Not saying it's right, just that culturally it's accepted in Japan.",

Many restaurants in Japan are somewhat hidden away and rely more on bookings as opposed to walk-ups.  These restaurants most likely book up months in advance and do not take names for last minute cancellations because it's not within their cultural mindset that someone would cancel at the last minute.\n\nAdded to this is the issue with there being somewhat of a language barrier in some places so foreign tourists are much less likely to walk-up and fill seats.  \n\nAlso, as one of the other posters mentioned, these high end restaurants source their fresh supplies and do pre-prep for the day ON THE DAY, so if you have a booking and don't show, and they don't fill that place, then that's a lot of money invested that is lost.\n\nFinally, there are a lot of restaurants in the US which are very unhappy with this culture of booking and cancelling at the last minute.  If 10-15% of customers book and no-show that number of unsold seats may represent the difference between profit and loss for that day.",

Also, may of these restaurants here are quite small and don't keep a standby list. They can lose out on significant business if a few foreign parties cancel in one night. And there are not always lines of people at these places. In fact, that's what makes them so special.\n\nWhere are you getting that 10-15% number for cancellations?\n\nThis isn't just about highly rated restaurants.

Every hour of every day is planned out, and if something goes wrong (we have a lot of weather here, which seems to come as a surprise to people) it's a grade A disaster, and everyone is expected to scramble to compensate. When everything's going as planned, the US tourists are some of the most delightful! But the moment it starts to rain or a single detail isn't as expected, the whole day (if not the whole trip) is ruined. If people did a little research on climate (we have a wet season!) or knew the details of the specific tour they had booked (\"my travel agent arranged something for today, am I in the right place?\" \"what did they arrange?\" \"well, I don't know what it's called\"), it could all be a lot less stressful for everyone involved.",

None of this is true in this case.\n\nThe whole issue arises from the fact that people want to dine at these specific restaurants for various reasons, but it's hard to get a spot, so a small share of them are abusing the reservation systems. The owners lose on multiple fronts. They don't get paid, paying customers have to be turned away, maybe they even had to come up with more staff or order more ingredients for that day. By turning the small number of abusers - those who aren't even really interested in your product and services anyways but (presumably) just want the Instagram fame they get by posting from inside the location - away, they are protecting their business and making life better for the customers who actually value what they are doing.\n\nIf a single couple makes five reservations and shows up at just one, and the average value would have been 200$, they pay 200$ at the place they ended up going to but the other four restaurants lose 800$. And yes, in this case (unlike e.g. with movie piracy) that money was actually lost, because we can assume they wouldn't have had to make a reservation in the first place if they didn't have to compete with other customers. But even worse: four paying couples now didn't get to eat at the other four restaurants, and they might start telling their friends that it's impossible to get a table (so don't even try) or even write a bad review.\n\nMy father runs a company and there have been several occasions on which he simply had to cut ties with a customer to make life better for everybody else, and later on he often found out he wasn't the only one wasting resources on that specific customer.",

I know a ton of faux \u201cfoodie\u201d luxury traveler types who go to Japan as it\u2019s trendy now and has lots of Michelin ****** but don\u2019t really care or know about the culture. \n\nI think also in the US most \u201chot\u201d impossible-to-get,must-plan-months-ahead type restaurants have online booking systems and/or wait lists so if you can\u2019t make your reservation, someone gets called up from the list or walking in - no danger of them missing a cover at all. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case in Japan at all - maybe some tourists might think they can wait-list or walk-in to Jiro or something but you definitely almost never can. And on the off chance the customer does no-show in the US, they will charge a nominal cancellation fee that the type of people who book a lot of fancy dinners don\u2019t really care about (like if they were going to drop $200 pp or more doubtful they care about. $40 or 50 cancellation fee). All these things plus total obliviousness about how things work elsewhere = bad behavior.   They likely just assume it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d there because it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d here. I would say it\u2019s good to educate them but I have a feeling it\u2019s not possible to if they don\u2019t care in the first place. \n\nI will say in my travels, in general, the Americans aren\u2019t the worst anymore. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard customers badmouthing service or a restaurant or bar, or even berating service people because XYZ foreign country doesn\u2019t have their specific tea or gin or whatever is staggering",

It's standard practice. We also don't linger in food venues the way that other cultures do... we go to dinner, eat our food, and get out; in some countries a single table will be occupied for hours by the same patrons. It isn't a slight or considered rude to cancel a dinner reservation, except perhaps if you booked a private event. \n\nObviously this doesn't excuse American tourists from responsibility; when in Rome... but it does at least explain why so many people are having this issue.

I had lived in Japan for 15 years at that point (11 years ago now) and spoke fluent Japanese. I had travelled around most of Japan during that time and was very familiar with the country. In practice, because we have a team of native Japanese in our Tokyo office, I rarely actually need to use nihongo on a daily basis for work as I focus more on the planning and sales side and deal with the clients rather than suppliers. All my non Japanese colleagues have lived in Japan for at least 2 or 3 years but most of them are relatively basic with nihongo, so that's much less important than knowing the country well and understanding what western tourists want to do and how they want to do it. I'd also say that because we deal with the very lux market, one of the hardest things for new colleagues has actually been getting their heads around the incredible amounts of money that some people spend on their holidays.",

To deter people from hogging a table from another customer by not showing up. With the fee usually they'll give you some kind of item of equal value once you arrive but not always. \n\nI've only made a couple of reservations and it hasn't been an issue. One reservation I made in person for the following night because they were already booked when I walked up so I asked if I could just go ahead and make one for the following night instead. They were fine with that. \n\nI don't like the idea of booking every restaurant on vacation. I understand if you want to book a high end dinner for one night. But booking every single place even the low-mid scale places is a bit much. Usually my appetite changes so frequently and I'm walking down the street going to eat at place A but suddenly I see place B and decide to go there instead. Outside of the top fancy dining places or places with a limited time menu offering or something special going on; reservations generally are not needed.",

Which means that I have no problem patronizing Japanese-run businesses here, but I flat out refuse to knowingly patronize a business that is run by a Japanese rapist.\n\nLikewise, if restaurants have had a bad experience with a Fijian (for example) customer in the past, then they could at least have the common decency to *only* ban Fijian customers in future; instead of losing out on a lot of potential business by assuming that the Fijian psyche is *exactly* the same as the average Liechtensteiner's.",

These restaurants are high in demand that they can recoup a cancelled appointment with guests on a waiting list or they are so popular that it will get filled within the same day.  I'm not sure how much influence you have with the restaurant industry but you might share this practice with them.",

            "comment": "Yes! My SO and I are in Japan for the first time and, as we are lucky enough to travel for a living, we did extensive research before coming to this country. We decided to do kaiseki and, when we asked our hotel to book a reservation for us, they kept repeating the time. We had to assure them repeatedly we would not cancel or be late. I believe Japan even put out a tourist guide where canceling reservations was at the top of the no-no list. Please don't mess it up for the rest of us!\n\n\nOn that note, any advice on what we can do to show the right amount of appreciation for our food? Sometimes we feel like a simple \"Oiishi!\" isn't enough. Any kaiseki advice in general would be great too.\n\nEdit: Am American and am kind of getting my feelings hurt (lol) considering I've seen despicable travel behavior everywhere and it doesn't seem to be concentrated to one culture. I think that we forget most people don't travel often, and first-time travelers are bound to make mistakes as they are nervous, out of their comfort zone, and can't know what they don't know. I tend to err on the side of empathy in this case. Maybe people are making assumptions, but would change their behavior with a little counseled awareness. \n\nJust a reminder: travel isn't just about travel plans, it's about connection. Cultural and historical research gives traveling more depth and 'the more you know before you go', the better experience you will have. Read literature, research art, study the environment, get involved through Meetup and Reddit before traveling! \n\nEdit 2: Can you tell I'm an anthropologist? Lol",

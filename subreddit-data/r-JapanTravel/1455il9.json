    "postText": "Hey guys, apologies if this topic is repeated/over-posted, I just couldn't seem to find the answers to my questions regarding tolls in Japan. These are my questions:\n\n1. From what I have read so far, you go through an entry gantry when you enter the highway, and then you go through an exit gantry when you exit the highway. Is this correct?\n2. Generally speaking, if I am driving between cities (e.g Osaka to Kyoto), would I need to enter and exit the toll road multiple times for one journey, for example when swapping between routes?\n3. How are the tolls calculated? I tried using one of the [toll calculator sites](https://search.w-nexco.co.jp/en/) and they give me three routes with three different prices for the same departing and arriving IC's. Why would a different route change the price of tolls? How would they track which route you are taking, if you are going from and to the same entry and exit point? This goes back to my unclear understanding of how to enter and exit the highway.\n4. Is there a better way to go about calculating tolls and navigating Japan in general? Is it ok to just use google maps?\n\nThank you for reading, any help would be very appreciated :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Though some has middle gantry that may or may not require you to pay before reaching your destination.\n3. There are middle gantry. That site should list you where you are paying and how much at each place.\n4. Your rental car GPS will be much better.",

            "comment": "1. Generally yes, but toll booths exist at certain points, where you switch highway operators.\n2. That depends. Also, driving in Kanto, Kansai and Northern Kyushu urban areas can be only described as masochistic.\n3. Distance and route. Depends also whether you switch operators in the process.\n4. Use Nexco calculator, or calculators baked into car navigation systems. Generally, I would avoid using Google Maps for car navigation in Japan since the local systems (eg. Toyota's) have up to date info on road closures etc.\n\nAlso, note that if you are renting a car equipped with ETC is strongly recommended.",

            "comment": "I don't have the exact answers to your questions, but we hired a car for 4 days in Kyushu last month, and found the toll roads incredibly straightforward to use and well maintained. I highly recommend booking an ETC card with your car hire (it was like \u00a33 on top of the hire) as it automatically scans and charges as you go, and then you pay a lump sum to the car hire place when you return the car. \n\n1) That's right. \n2) Not always, you might go from from route 324 to route 497, and if they're joined up you might not go through a toll booth to go from one to the other. But you might have to come off one expressway and be on the normal highway for a bit, then back on another expressway, so then you'd go through a toll booth and then back through another.\n3) I have no idea, but its surprisingly expensive! We paid about \u00a327 to go from Nagasaki to Kurokawa Onsen because the Nagasaki Expressway is loooooong. \n4) You're not allowed to use cell phone navigation in your hire car (unless your passenger is holding it I guess?) so it's harder to pick alternative routes to the one your in car navigation selects. The in car sat nav was very accurate and easy to use, so we just did as it said, toll roads and all. \n\nAnother word of advice re the speed limits - everyone speeds! The roads are well signposted with the speed limit, usually 30 in the city, 50 in towns, and 80 on the expressway. But I was doing the limit and everyone was speeding past me. At one point in single carriageway I found myself doing 50 with a massive queue behind me, one guy even honked at me! \nAfter the first trip, I googled it, and apparently speed cameras only flash you if you're going over 17kmph over the limit, because there's a law against photographing someone unless they're actually committing a crime. So it seems everyone treats that as the speed limit! I wanted to stick to the limit so I much preferred the two lane expressways where I felt like I wasn't in anyone's way!",

My main concern is the straightforwardness part, like worrying about whether the route that I'm taking would cause me to pay too much, or getting lost and having to re-enter and pay the toll again. In general when using the car nav, did you run into such problems?",

As long as you have an ETC in your rental car, it\u2019s going to be like using a Suica card in the Tokyo metro. Just navigate to where you want and you\u2019ll get charged exactly correctly. I just rented a car with ETC last week and it was zero effort.\n\nThe only thought might be to figure out the route you want ahead of time (to optimize for scenery, speed, or tolls). Anything else is overthinking.",

They give you three warnings of literally anything you have to do, and if you're on toll roads, there is nothing to do! Cost I can appreciate being a worry - we drove for 7.5hrs and 306 miles over 4 days, and we paid \u00a347 in tolls. Which was more than I was expecting, but next time I'd budget for it.",

I am running into this when looking to rent a car with TEP.  It's not just any rental car outlet within the Tohoku region.  You need to rent from a company that allows TEP at a particular branch.  So as an example: Budget only offers TEP from the Sendai Airport.  But there are Budget outlets in places like Koriyama.\n\nI used a TEP Pass in 2019.  I made sure to pick a location listed as offering TEP (Orix from Ichinoseki ) I went in, filled in some forms and got my TEP.  I did make sure to rent my car with ETC on line.",

I've only gotten TEP and I stayed within TEP.  \n\nAgain, I'm planning to book a TEP again, but I need to find a rental from where I want to rent a car lol  I have at least two destinations I want to make it to.\n\nI've rented a cars in Japan in Summer of 2019 and again in December 2022.  For the latter period I didn't get any pass because my first rental the ETC fees were only around 2200 yen and my other rental I didn't even get an ETC card because I never took an expressway.  (I drove from Kuwana Station to Nagashima Spa Land.)\n\nSorry if this is not what you were hoping to hear",

So you're not going through 4 pass areas unless you are going to unlisted places.  You are starting in an areas without a pass, going to an area covered by CEP and then you want to visit some more uncovered areas.  I'm not seeing 4 areas.  \n\nSo according to the CEP info Page, you CAN pick it up in KIX\n\n[https://hayatabi.c-nexco.co.jp/page/?id=88](https://hayatabi.c-nexco.co.jp/page/?id=88)\n\nyou can use Times Car Rental and get a car with CEP at KIX or Kyoto Station or Nippon rent a car and get it at KIX.\n\nCEP has a few add ons, but you honestly might need to contact  a rental car agency to ask more questions about CEP or to find out about the additional CEP adjacent passes you can buy to cover additional expressways like NEP.  I find their colored map sort of confusing.  But they also might not apply to you.\n\nYou can read this page as well.\n\n[https://hayatabi.c-nexco.co.jp/page/?id=91](https://hayatabi.c-nexco.co.jp/page/?id=91)\n\nThe map on that page is a little easier to read.\n\nI would expect the rental car companies working out of KIX have better knowledge of English. Though it looks like you would need to take side roads to get from KiX to Kyoto because in Kyoto you can enter CEP but KIX you can not.\n\nYour other problem is CEP is only good for 14 days max.  I've no idea what happens when you come up against that, I expect it just becomes a regular ETC card.  Again, I only rented a car for a 2 or 3 days, so I never had an issue with that.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m wondering if I have too much city strolling  and too little nature/temple seeing in my current itinerary. Thinking of making Day 3 a Kamakura/Yokohama day trip instead, but that might make my city strolling time too short? Should I just keep as is?

I\u2019ll try to push Disney earlier, but I guess we\u2019re fine with being a bit late since we\u2019re there the whole day anyway.\n\nThe dinner part is news to me, I heard Tokyo life in general starts really late at 10AM, then it comes to life at night. Aren\u2019t dinners at Shinjuku/Shibuya/Shimo still open at 8-10? These districts I heard are nightlife cities. \n\nI forgot to mention but going back straight to the hotel (Shinjuku) after Disneyland, and planning to eat somewhere there. Where do people usually eat dinner when going Disneyland btw?",

There were a lot of crowds though at Kamakura and Enoshima was more chill. Somewhere between there, on the train, there was a stop with a beach and a beach-side restaurant with views of the surfers, just remember it being incredibly chill, and then we got to Enoshima late afternoon, and still had time to wander.  Basically we did it all in one day but definitely did Kamakura first.  I guess, I would start with Kamakura and if you\u2019re feeling done with it, continue on to Enoshima.  Or you might spend the whole day in Kamakura.  \nThat said, your Tokyo itinerary looks pretty good.   I just remember feeling exhausted of Tokyo after a few days - we had planned 5 days in Tokyo thinking we would fill it all up with city, and I remember Kamakura being such a nice break, with the forest hike and all.  But there is so much to do in Tokyo.  Sounds like you live relatively close (the Philippines) and so could go back again.",

Your itinerary is basically made of theme parks so you may not like some real Japan, but that would be a very educational and therefore welcome addition.\n\nThrow away Inokashira park or Ikebukuro, lump together attractions from other days.\n\nOther comments:\n\n1. Seems you have to it dinners set very late. Most shops where you can actually eat dinner will be closed by that time. Try to have dinner before 8PM\n\n2. Every day includes kombini breakfast. It must be because you are going to be on budget, but realise that kombini is anything but cheap.\n\nThere\u2019s also lots of poor planning. For example, only 30 minutes for Sensoji: you won\u2019t be able to reach the temple in that time. Give it solid two hours.",

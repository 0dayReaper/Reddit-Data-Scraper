    "postText": "With Japan's re-opening and the upcoming winter, I'm going to go over some common cold and cough medicines found in Japan's drug stores. These are all over-the-counter medications that you can pick up a most drug stores throughout the country.  Matsumoto Kiyoshi (MatsuKi, \u30de\u30c4\u30e2\u30c8\u30ad\u30e8\u30b7) is possibly the most noticeable drug store, with its big yellow and blue signage, but there are many others, too. More generally, drug stores will have this kanji often listed outside: \u85ac (medicine). Note that you cannot buy medicine at convenience stores. At best, they might have throat lozenges or non-medical powders for stomach aches, but they don't sell anything with medical ingredients.\n\n# General Notes\n\n* This guide is meant to help travelers who are experiencing mild symptoms or who are perhaps in a drug store and don't know what to do (the pictures and translations below should help \u2014 you can also show them to the staff!). **If you are very sick or feel that you need medical attention, the Japanese government has [a guide that can help](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html).**\n* The guide below details a few prominent medications. It does not cover all medications available. Some of these medications also have different versions with slightly different ingredients meant to target different symptoms. I picked the most \"general\" of the options when I could.\n* I did not translate the entire box for these medications. Below, I've listed ingredients, usage, dosage, and any important notes. If you need more specifics for info like allergies or aversions, this is not a guide that can help you.\n* Given the ingredients of these medications, almost all recommend that you take them with food.\n* Almost all of these medicines contains forms of codeine and/or ephedrine, ingredients which are often **not considered OTC medications in other countries**. Be careful when taking leftover pills out of the country, and **make sure to adhere to your next/home country's medication laws**.\n* **This guide is not medical advice!** It is simply meant to help you read and understand the packaging of Japanese OTC medications if you are looking for cold symptom management. If you have a complex medical history, or you take medications that interfere with these ingredients or others, always be careful when selecting OTC meds.\n* Translations of Japanese were made with assistance from /u/SofaAssassin. Thanks!\n\n# Glossary\n\nHere are some ingredients you'll commonly find in Japanese cold and cough medications:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|English|Japanese|Used For...|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Acetaminophen (AKA Paracetamol) |\u30a2\u30bb\u30c8\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3|Pain|\n|Ambroxol|\u30a2\u30f3\u30d6\u30ed\u30ad\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u5869\u9178\u5869|Cough, Phlegm|\n|Ascorbic Acid / Vitamin C|\u30a2\u30b9\u30b3\u30eb\u30d3\u30f3\u9178\uff08\u30d3\u30bf\u30df\u30f3C\uff09|General Health|\n|Belladonna Extract|\u30d9\u30e9\u30c9\u30f3\u30ca|Runny Nose|\n|Benfotiamine (Vitamin B1 derivative)|\u30d9\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30c1\u30a2\u30df\u30f3\u3000(\u30d3\u30bf\u30df\u30f3B1\u8a98\u5c0e\u4f53)|General Health|\n|Bromhexine|\u30d6\u30ed\u30e0\u30d8\u30ad\u30b7\u30f3\u5869\u9178\u5869|Phlegm|\n|Caffeine|\u7121\u6c34\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30f3|Anti-Drowsy|\n|Chlorpheniramine|\u30af\u30ed\u30eb\u30d5\u30a7\u30cb\u30e9\u30df\u30f3|Congestion|\n|Chlor-Trimeton|\u30af\u30ed\u30eb\u30d5\u30a7\u30cb\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30de\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u9178\u5869|Runny Nose, Congestion|\n|Dextromethorphan|\u30c7\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3| Cough|\n|Dihydryocodeine|\u30b8\u30d2\u30c9\u30ed\u30b3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30ea\u30f3\u9178\u5869|Pain, Cough|\n|dl-methylephedrine|dl-\u30e1\u30c1\u30eb\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u5869\u9178\u5869|Cough, Phlegm|\n|Guaifenesin|\u30b0\u30a2\u30a4\u30d5\u30a7\u30cd\u30b7\u30f3|Cough|\n|Hesperidin|\u30d8\u30b9\u30da\u30ea\u30b8\u30f3|General Health|\n|Ibuprofen|\u30a4\u30d6\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3|Pain|\n|Isopropamide iodide|\u30e8\u30a6\u5316\u30a4\u30bd\u30d7\u30ed\u30d1\u30df\u30c9|Runny Nose, Congestion|\n|L-carbocysteine|L-\u30ab\u30eb\u30dc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3|Cough, Phlegm|\n|Magnesium Oxide|\u9178\u5316\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30b7\u30a6\u30e0|General Health|\n|Pseudoephedrine HCl|\u30d7\u30bd\u30a4\u30c9\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3|Congestion|\n|Riboflavin / Vitamin B2|\u30ea\u30dc\u30d5\u30e9\u30d3\u30f3|General Health|\n|Tranexamic acid|\u30c8\u30e9\u30cd\u30ad\u30b5\u30e0\u9178|Sore Throat|\n|Thiamine / Vitamin B|\u30c1\u30a2\u30df\u30f3|General Health|\n\n# S.TAC NEO EX\n\n[FRONT OF BOX](https://imgur.com/syes79g) | [BACK OF BOX](https://imgur.com/T3wNZg0) | GENERAL COLD AND COUGH MEDICINE\n\nS.TAC NEO EX is a general cold and cough medicine that uses ibuprofen-based pain relief.

It is very strong, and contains more dihydryocodeine than other things on this list, which means it has quite a bit of a drowsy effect. I wouldn't recommend SS Bron unless you are suffering a serious cough, and you should be careful when combining it with other medications (especially ones that also contain dihydryocodeine). In most drug stores, this product will be on the shelves, but you will likely need to speak with a pharmacist at checkout and answer a series of questions before they will let you buy it, as it is often abused and more strictly controlled because of that.\n\nFor an adult, you take 4 pills 3 times per day.

I'm not as familiar with all the options, though, so I'd have to do more work/research to track down all the pictures and information.\n\nNaproxen is prescription only in Japan, but they do have Loxoprofen (\u30ed\u30ad\u30bd\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ca\u30c8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u6c34\u548c\u7269), which is packaged OTC as [Loxonin S](https://imgur.com/y6mdNVl) ([ingredient list](https://imgur.com/vNcgZEU)), and it's what I think they consider a \"replacement\" for naproxen. My husband, who only takes naproxen for pain, says they work the same for him, but that will obviously vary per person. It's worth knowing about, though, just in case you're in a situation where it might be the only viable option.\n\nPersonally, nothing works on menstrual pain for me except ibuprofen, so I totally get where you're coming from\u2014it's frustrating when the exact thing you need isn't available!",

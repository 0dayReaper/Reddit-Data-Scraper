            "comment": "I have only a few things to say:\n\nJune 3rd - Asakusa and Akihabara:  \nYou should probably flip these activities, depending on when you pla to get up. I think not many shops and maid caffees are open in the morning, you can mazbe expect them to open at around 10 a.m. On the contrary, the temple in Asakusa and the shops in front are open a bit arlier I believe. The distance between Asakusa and Akihabara is also not terribliy far, if you take the metro I think it takes around 3-4 stations.\n\nHiroshima:\n\nI think \"Miyajima Island\" is a really amazing place to visit, but you should at last take half a day for that. If you do have the time, look it up - if not, then ignore my comment on this.\n\nIn General:\n\nI believe June is right in the Rainy Season in Japan (Tsuyu), so be prepared that it might rain. A lot. Keep alternative indoor options available and always bring a raincoat/umbrella with you.\n\nMy break at work is over now, so I can only say a few things - but I am sure some others will help you further with tips and your schedule.\n\nBest of wishes and I hope you will enjoy Japan!",

            "comment": "On June 11th, are you traveling all the way from Osaka to Kobe just for dinner, then going back to Osaka? Only to go through Kobe the following day on your way to Hiroshima? It would be more efficient to rearrange your schedule so that you finish with Osaka, then go to Kobe, then on to Hiroshima. That'll save you at least two hours of being on a train.\n\n&gt;I read a lot in here and wanted to understand how shipping the luggage from a hotel to an another worked because that would make our life easier I think.\n\nI've not used the service from Yamato before, but some people swear by it. Just remember that it still takes some time for it to get there. So be sure to inquire as to when it will arrive. Because if you send it in the afternoon for example, it might not be there for you to use at night at the next place.\n\nMy advice would be to pack light, so you don't need to be worrying about big luggage. It'll be summer, so you won't need anything bulky anyway.",

    "postText": "Hi!! First time going to Japan for a vacation and I'll be headed there for \\~18ish days, super excited. My friend and I committed on the basis that we'll summit Mt Fuji so I'm kind of centering the trip around our hut reservation on Sept 5th. I'm pretty open with my budget; late 20s STEM career with a fortunate housing situation. \n\nI've traveled a couple times in my life and I think I can narrow down my interests to be: eating good food, hiking/physical activity, relaxation/spas, and partying. In that order, hahah. \n\nI've made this rough itinerary but I'm a little bit worried I'm trying to visit too many places. I also referenced mostly Google Maps on how to get around but it may not be realistic? \n\nThe *italicized* locations I'm a little iffy on and would gladly invite suggestions/insight! \n\n* 8/31 - LAX -&gt; Haneda: Try to relax after the flight since I'm gonna travel \\*again\\* toward Gunma/Nagano.\n* 9/1 thru 9/2  - Tokyo -&gt; *Yamanouchi -&gt; Kusatsu:*  I picked this place out because **Jigokudani Monkey Park** and **J\u014dshin\u2019etsu-k\u014dgen National Park** looked fun to visit. But other than that I'm not so sure what else to visit haha. Also the super renowned **Kusatsu Onsen** is (kind of) nearby, it's like \\~3hrs away. I would love to squeeze a visit. \n   * I was weighing this out with a day trips from Tokyo to Hakone/Kamakura/Nikko? It may be easier since they're closer and not... within the mountains haha.\n* 9/3 thru 9/4 - *Yamanouchi* \\-&gt; *Matsumoto*: I've gotta get to Mt Fuji by the 5th but public transport from Nagano area southbound through the mountains is pretty rough (\\~5hrs?). Matsumoto would be a solid break from the pilgrimage south. \n* 9/5 thru 9/6 - *Matsumoto* \\-&gt; Fujikawaguchiko -&gt; Mt Fuji: Finally, head to Fujikawaguchiko relax, check out Fuji Five Lakes before the hike. Splitting the hike into two: Hike to the 7th Station, sleep, and peak the mountain on the 6th. Be back in Tokyo by the evening?\n* 9/7 thru 9/16 - I'm still trying to split this part up hehe... Rough draft:\n   * 9/7 - 9/11ish(?): Mt. Fuji -&gt; Tokyo: \\*Actually\\* relax after all the hiking and adventuring. Thinking **Golden Gai**, **Ghibli Museum** (hoping I can get tickets!! August 10th, gotta save the date), **Sumo Wrestling** (there will be a tournament in Kokugikan!!), **Yomiuri Giants Tokyo Dome** game, eat ~~some~~ lots of fish at **Tsukiji Fish Market**, visit some cool cafes. \n   * 9/11(ish) - 9/15: Tokyo -&gt; Osaka/Kyoto: I heard Osaka actually has the better places to eat! I was looking at visiting the **Kichi Kichi Omurice**, **Izakaya Toyo** (the flamethrower tuna chef!), of course the famous **Osaka Aquarium**, hike around **Mount Yoshino**, visit the **Nara Deer Park**, check out **Yoshino Kumano National Park** (a bit far),  see the **Fushimi-Inari-Taisha Shrine**.\n* 9/16 - Back to Tokyo, buy souvenirs, prepare to fly back. :( \n\nMight be a little noticeable that I've got quite a lot going on in my head for this visit haha. I'm just looking to have fun and replenish; it had been a really rough past year. I would greatly welcome:\n\n1. Advice on getting around (will probably get a JR pass)\n2. Your own stories and memories about your trip that you can't forget\n3. Favorite restaurants/food vendors/bars/plates/bites/flavors you had\n4. Hotels/ryokans/Airbnbs/onsens that helped you get great rest.\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "Going back to Tokyo after the Ghibli Park just to go to Hiroshima the day after seems like a huge waste of time and money. Continuing to Hiroshima after the park would make your day after a lot less cramped.\n\nFor the first day keep in mind it takes a lot of time from the airport to the city. We landed at 1pm a week ago and didnt make it to our hotel in Shinjuku until around 5pm. Especially considering your hotel is not that close to your planned activities, plus any potential jetlag, doing a lot in Shibuya might not be feasible.\n\nIt also makes me wonder why your Tokyo hotels are in Sumida and Asakusa while everything you're planning to do is on the western side.\n\nThe Kyoto day is also quite lofty, since it includes moving hotels, amd the places you want to visit are not that close to each other.\n\nI'd personally drop Hiroshima completely (even though I love the city) and spend some more time on Kyoto or Tokyo. 9 days for the 4 cities is definitely doable, but imo its a bit rushed.",

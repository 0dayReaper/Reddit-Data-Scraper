In Dontonbori, try the melonbun\n\n&gt;Universal Studios Japan\n\n1. Try get the express pass if not sold out.\n2. If you can't, go to the longest wait time rides (the 2 jurassic park rides, the 2 harry potter rides, 4d spiderman) an hour or so before close time (10 pm, though check close time for your date). We did the HP forbidden journey ride twice, once in the day at 11 am (2 hour wait), and once at 9 pm (5 min wait).\n3. Get the app which has live wait times - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/universal-studios-japan/id532097000. See which rides have a single-rider line, which is great and saved me a lot of time.\n4. Eat beforehand and see if you sneak in a couple sandwiches, they don't allow food inside but their bag checks are perfunctory. The food inside isn't great and has long waits.",

If you do it in the morning maybe could tie in the Tsukiji visit with that day? You could go from there to Akihabara and Skytree  \nThen Shinjuku/Shibuya could be it\u2019s own day (with Harajuku too). Recommend booking Shibuya Sky for sunset/dusk - beautiful time of day.   \nCould start in Shinjuku park in the morning, wander around Shinjuku for lunch, then Harajuku and wind up in Shibuya for the late afternoon/evening",

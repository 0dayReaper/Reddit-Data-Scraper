    "postText": "I just got back from an amazing 10 day trip in Japan. I've been to Japan once before (17 years ago) and it remains one of my favorite countries I've ever visited. I've had IBS-d for over 10 years, and have mostly ignored it until a couple years ago when I got checked out by a doctor. Even after being diagnosed, it didn't affect my life too much until about 7 months ago. I developed severe anxiety around being outside my home. I would panic anytime I was in a car or place where I didn't know where a bathroom was. So I stopped going out anywhere besides to work. My life became extremely isolated and restricted. I think the term for my fear is agoraphobia. \n\nHowever, I'm into r/awardtravel. I was able to score 2 first class seats on ANA with points. I've been planning to go to Japan this year since they reopened. I did not want to let my fear stop me from going. So I started therapy as well as anything and everything to try and get my IBS under control. I started a low fodmap diet and that is the only thing that's worked for me. Before going, I asked the low fodmap subreddit for Japanese food suggestions I could eat while over there. Someone suggested tempura and tonkatsu. So I tried those things before going on my trip. They absolutely destroyed me. So I started my trip not really knowing what I could eat besides plain rice... I had gotten other suggestions of sushi with no sauces and shio yakitori.  \n\nI had read that there are bathrooms in all the train stations. I didn't it believe it, though. Most places I have traveled don't have frequent public bathrooms. When I got into the first subway car, I began to panic badly. I hate enclosed, crowded spaces that I can't get out of. The journey to our hotel from Haneda airport was rough. But I did start to notice that there did seem to actually be bathrooms in every train station. Also, the time between stops was usually a minute or two. If I needed to get out, I could. So that anxiety subsided for the rest of the trip. \n\nWe spent 6 days in Tokyo, 2 in Kyoto, and 2 in Osaka. Our hotel in Tokyo was on the outskirts of Ginza in a business district next to the Sumida river. Picking a hotel in not so central location ended up being somewhat of a detriment. There weren't really any restaurants close by. My diet is already limited, so that made it worse. There were a couple of nights where my dinner was a rice ball from 7/11 because I couldn't find anything else. My IBS usually flares up after eating a meal. So I always wanted to be close to the hotel after eating something more than a rice ball. \n\nFor breakfast and lunch, I would have a rice ball from 7/11 since that was a safe food for me. I was so sick of rice balls by the end of the trip. I was worried I'd have a flare up and then I'd not want to leave the hotel room. So keeping eating to a minimum until dinner time was important. My partner and I were out walking tons everyday. As others on here have said, you will walk a lot! We were averaging 30k steps a day. I didn't bring the best shoes, so my feet hurt badly every night. I'm a mail carrier, so I'm used to walking a lot. But walking as much as this was a bit painful, especially in sandals. \n\nOur hotel in Kyoto was in a slightly better area. It was residential, but there were some restaurants close by. Shio yakitori and sushi were one of the few things I could eat. So we ended up going to a couple of good yakitori shops. One was a very tiny shop with just one guy working. It was really cool to see. We walked a ton in Kyoto and hit some of the popular shrines and temples. \n\nIt seemed the bus system was the way of transport in Kyoto more than the subway system. This has probably already been talked about here, but it was very unclear to us how the bus system worked. You need to go to the front of the bus to pay. So that means pushing past people in the aisle. The first time we took the bus, we tried to get out the back doors and got berated. \n\nIn Osaka, we stayed at Cross Hotel which is very centrally located. Location-wise, it was the best hotel. We had any and every food option around us. Since our stay there was so short, we never left the Namba area. There was so much to see and do in Namba. I badly wanted to have ramen while in Japan, but knew it would cause a flare up. We found a ramen shop that was a 2 minute walk from our hotel. We ate there both nights and it was amazing. Some of the best ramen I've ever had! Since we were right next to the hotel, it wasn't a big deal for my IBS. \n\nMy advice is if you have a food allergy, make sure to book a hotel in a central location with lots of food options around. Otherwise, you may be like me and be left with nothing to eat besides 7/11 food. Next time I go to Tokyo, I want to book a hotel in a better location. I picked a hotel I stayed at with my dad when I had visited 17 years ago. The rooms were large and the views were stunning. Our room had a view of Tokyo tower. \n\nI went into this trip with extreme anxiety that my IBS would derail anything and everything we wanted to do. But by sticking to rice balls, I made it through with only a few flare ups. I believe Japan was one of the best places I could travel. A number of food options fit my limited diet. There also were a ton of public restrooms everywhere. I was also able to overcome my anxiety around being in public places, especially public transit. I've only been back in the US for a couple of days, but since being back, I'm no longer anxious to go in the car. That's really huge for me since that was limiting my life a lot! I'm really hoping this trip fixed or at least significantly helped my agoraphobia. \n\nOverall, it was an amazing trip. I can't wait to go back to Japan!",

You were probably scolded because it looked like you were going out the wrong door, causing disruption for those getting onto the bus, and leaving without paying.",

Enter at the front and pay a flat fee immediately, cash or IC card, then get off the back whenever.\n\nThe other two styles are:\n\nGet on the back and pay a flat fee, cash or IC card, at the front as you get off. \n\nGet on the front or back, taking a ticket that indicates where you got on if paying cash (or tapping your IC card). Then when you want to get off, you check the board at the front and see how much you owe, (look at the box that corresponds with the number on your ticket ) and pay at the front in cash (or tap your IC card again to automatically pay the calculated amount. It's like going in and out of a train station)\n\nI definitely know in Hakone you get in at the front but it's not a flat fee (see third example above)",

I also saw bathrooms in 7/11 and Family Mart. There were a lot of cafes and coffee shops with public restrooms. We were also never far from a train station, so I felt bathrooms were all around in Tokyo. It was very similar in Osaka. Kyoto definitely had less. We spent most of our time at the popular tourists sites (Nijo castle, Kinkakuji, Fushimi Inari). They all had multiple public restrooms.",

It didn't happen often, but when it did, I would be out of commission for half a day and I would need a toilet extremely close by. \n\nLast year, I went on a solo trip to Warsaw. I was having lunch in a small cafe, and suddenly I knew what was about to happen. Luckily they had a toilet, but it was just one toilet for the entire cafe. I tried to make it to a nearby metro station, but after 10 meters, I knew I couldn't make it. I sprinted back to the cafe and thank goodness the toilet was unoccupied. After a few hours I felt a bit better and spent the rest of the day at my hotel. \n\nI am so impressed that you decided to just go for it! I think it was definitely the right thing to do, but also quite scary. I'm so glad you had a great time there!",

Once you realize how to be careful there you will relax and enjoy. I understand the anxiety as I have it too but learning how to work around it. Again don\u2019t made meals and food a focal point.

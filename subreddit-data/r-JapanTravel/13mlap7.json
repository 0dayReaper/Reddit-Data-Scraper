    "postText": "Hi,\ncurrently travelling around Kyushu with a JR pass and are wondering what would be the best day trip from Nagasaki\n\n- Sasebo with a cruise and a visit to the Tenkaiho Observatory (dependinh on the timing of the bus, could work out) with a stop in Kami-Arita for the shrine and maybe some shopping\n\n- Shimabara (but have been to Kagoshima / Beppu)\n\nOr any other suggestions?\n\nMain transportation should be involving the JR Kyushu Pass plus any add on bus\n\nFor Nagasaki I do plan on spending 1,5 days in the city - including a night visit to the observatory (or would that be better during the day ?) \n\nThanks",

You can read more details in my [trip report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/13mm11b/trip_report_3_weeks_from_kyushu_to_tokyo/) JR pass will only take you up to Isahaya though, as Shimabara railway is its own company.",

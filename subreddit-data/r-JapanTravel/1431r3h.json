We didn't get to explore as much as we wanted to.\n3) I've only had a brief look of what activities we can do in Okinawa, hence it's pretty empty at the moment. Anything we find, we can add to our itinerary later.\n4) Similarly, we haven't planned much for Tokyo because we want to be more spontaneous with our plans there, apart from places like Disney, Pokemon Cafe, etc. We also have a friend living there whom we plan to meet, so we aren't worried about not having set plans (we had more fun that way!).\n5) Since there are soooo many travel passes out there, are the passes I've chosen (Nikko WH &amp; Hakone/Kamakura) good enough? We still have our Pasmo cards which we can use in the cities.\n6) I've tried my best to plan the different places according to average cherry blossom forecasts, knowing that the forecast can vary every year (although I know Okinawa gets sakura very early, so I don't mind missing it there as long as we get to see it on the main land).\n7) We are planning to go to the theme parks (both Disneys &amp; USJ) on weekdays, hopefully for less crowds (considering it would be peak tourist season).\n8) Due to the length of our trip (and hence our budget), I doubt we will be able to stay at a hotel/ryokan with a private onsen with Mt Fuji view (that has been my dream, but it's like $600-1000 AUD per night :( ). Are there any suggestions for hotel/ryokan with private onsen alternatives, even in other places such as Hakone? We are trying to spend ~ $100 AUD per night, but I understand that such places would be far more expensive (we'll see if we can spend a little extra, otherwise leave my dream for a future trip!)\n9) We were originally planning to go to Sapporo during the Okinawa dates, as I really want to go to Shiroi Koibito Park. But, it seems like it would make more sense to go to Sapporo another time, such as during the snow festival, and even in March I'd have to pack extra warm (and possibly heavy) clothes. Hence, we decided to swap Sapporo with Okinawa, since it's said to be more \"tropical\".\n10) Is it possible to do Izu Peninsula as a day trip from Tokyo? Or Yokohama?\n\nThank you (especially if you read this far!)",

Spending money to rent a car just to spend more money parking it...\n\nDay 21 : Personally do not like the Osaka-Kawaguchiko. I think it would be easier to do Kawaguchiko to and from Tokyo. Hakone make more sense coming from Osaka as it will just be easier.\n\n1. No JR Pass especially as you fly to Okinawa then Osaka.\n2. I do not mind spending time in Tokyo, but you might want to find a bit more detail than just \"Shibuya\" for two whole days, like spot specific attraction/shops. You don't have to do everything you find, but I just think it's easier to follow (or not follow) a plan than to have no clue of what to do and search while you are there\n3. &amp;#x200B;\n4.  \u200bIt's ok to be \"spontaneous\", but again, I prefer to at least have an idea of things I could do.\n5. Yes, those two seems to be fine. Yes, pass are nice, but you don't have to overthink it.\n6.  \u200b \n7.  \u200b\n8.  Instead of booking a room with a private onsen in the room, check to book a ryokan with a \"family bath\", in other words, a private bath you can rent for a set amount of time, either as an add on to the price of the room but some include it in the price.\n9. &amp;#x200B;\n10. 10. Maybe... depend where exactly you want to go. I am sure you could spend 2-3 days in Izu peninsula, spend a night a a ryokan with onsen, go for some hike...",

Their website said that cherry blossom appears in the order of Tokyo, then Osaka, then Kawaguchiko - hence the order in my itinerary. Do you think it's better to change the order and make travel easier/simpler, or stick to it based on cherry blossom forecasts?",

Stay for at least a night in Tokyo, leave your luggage at the hotel, go to Kawaguchiko then return to the same hotel. Of course Osaka to Kawaguchiko is possible, it just take time.",

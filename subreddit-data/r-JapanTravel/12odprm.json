    "postText": "Hi all! My wife and I have a two-week Japan trip coming up in late May, with the most adventurous leg being three nights around Kyushu with a rental car after our time in Tokyo and Kyoto. This is our first time visiting Japan.\n\nThe current plan is to take an early-morning bullet train from Kyoto, rent the car at FUK around mid-day, and drive to Minamioguni where we have two nights booked at a ryokan. During that time we'd like to check out Mt. Aso and Takachiho Gorge. Then we'll head back to Fukuoka and nearby beaches for one more night before grabbing a cheap flight back to Tokyo (for the last two nights of the trip).\n\nOn paper it all makes sense, but since we've never been to Japan I'm naturally a little nervous about it. I do know we need to get our international driving permits before the trip. A few questions:\n\n\\- How's cell service between Fukuoka and Mt. Aso? We've bought a couple Mobal SIM cards and expect we'll be pretty dependent on our phones to navigate.\n\n\\- We've booked two nights at a single ryokan in Minamioguni, but would it make more sense to stay elsewhere the second night? (The owners already reached out to warn that we should expect the same dinner both nights, which to me suggests two-night stays are less common.)\n\n\\- Anything else we should know about the logistics of pulling this off?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Is a plan doable? Yes.\n\nShould you rent in Fukuoka? Probably not. I would argue that you should rent in either Kumamoto, or if you would want spend your second night elsewhere in an onsen town other than Kurokawa Onsen (because Minamioguni is essentially that) - it would probably be Yufuin.",

And if not, is there any other reason to avoid renting out of Fukuoka in particular? I was looking forward to the ramen (either on the way in, the way out, or both!) and checking out the beaches in Itoshima. Thanks again!",

You\u2019re on holiday mate!\n\nHiring a car out of a smaller city/town will be much easier to handle. Less traffic too. \n\nI did something similar. Stayed in Fukuoka but took the bullet train down 2hrs and stayed the night in Kagoshima where I hired a car to drive around the volcano. Was a fairly straightforward process.",

Depending on your schedule you would probably have time to have ramen for lunch in Fukuoka.\n\nFrom the station, Kumamoto airport is an hour bus ride. You could rent your car from there - it\u2019s on the east side of the city near Aso, so you wouldn\u2019t have to drive in the city at all so I second this. I\u2019m doing exactly this in about two weeks haha.",

But, your destinations are only 1-2 hours apart. Takachiho isn't somewhere I would normally suggest a traveler because it's so far away from everything, but it's only \\~1 hour from Minamioguni, so no problem.\n\nThe only thing you should consider is the time period. If your trip is during the winter, you should reconsider because that area has snow and messing with chains on tiny mountain roads is a pain. All other seasons is great though.\n\nI've never had problems with reception, but if you are worried, you can download google maps to offline. The pictures won't show up in offline mode, but the navigation still works.\n\nAlso, unlike the other guy, I don't recommend renting in Kumamoto. Kumamoto isn't *that* special to go out of your way for. It's a pretty big city with a castle. Fukuoka is more convenient to start out of.",

On that note I do have a logistical question about balancing our time in Minamioguni and the surrounding areas.\n\n* Day 1: Arrive in Kurokawa around 3-4pm. Dinner and relax.\n* Day 2: Early morning venture to Takachiho. Return to Kurokawa around 3-4pm. Dinner and relax.\n* Day 3: Check out around 9am and head back to Itoshima/Fukuoka.\n\nI'm not sure how late the onsens operate for guests, but does this give us enough time to relax in Minamioguni itself or should we retool the schedule somehow?",

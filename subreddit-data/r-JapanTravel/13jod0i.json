    "postText": "My husband and I will be going for our first trip to Japan this coming week from 21st May to 1st of June.\n\nUnfortunately I had a terrible fall just a month prior to our trip and I actually have partial tears of several ligaments of both ankles. At the moment, I\u2019m wearing aircasts for both my ankles and have been going through some treatment to alleviate the pain. I\u2019m able to walk, but walking longer than an hour makes my ankles start to throb with pain and after a full day of walking, I usually suffer terribly the next day.\n\nThis makes me worried for my trip in Japan. I\u2019m thinking of bringing a lot of painkillers for this trip. Anyway, this is my itinerary for the trip and there are times when I\u2019m keeping it light and easy just to make time for random stops at cafes/shops nearby to sit in case I\u2019m suffering from a lot of pain from walking at the time.

It\u2019s hard to avoid transit in Japan. Because sometimes going to places requires a walk to train, bus, walk to attraction and then the walking you do when you get to your destination. Many buildings in Japan and have a lot of stairs. When your in a train station, find out ahead of time, when the elevators are. Also, it\u2019s important to watch out for uneven pavement. I would look into onsens. Make sure all your hotel accommodations are near sightseeing or train stations. I think the inside of temples and castles will be hardest on your feet. Some parts of them have elevators. If it were me, I might request a wheelchair for some of the time. Double check the reviews of gardens. I went to one garden that was super steep and uneven.",

            "comment": "As someone with constant ankle pain, the one issue other than the constant walking that I struggle with, is the constant standing. Mostly from waiting in lines whether that\u2019d be at the airport, at train/bus stations, at popular restaurants. Even if I wanted to sit to rest my feet, there were hardly any chairs or rest area. Sure some places had parks but benches were limited and were often already taken. You can go to a cafe but you\u2019d have to pay for a drink or snack, and even then, if it\u2019s busy you can\u2019t stay long to get enough rest.\n\nSo I think that\u2019s something you\u2019ll also have to keep in mind. In my first trip, I was only able to fully take a rest when I returned to my hotel after a full day of walking. From then on, I\u2019ve pretty much relied on taxi or Uber, but it\u2019s an added expense and not all areas have Uber or taxis readily available.",

If not, gotta be prepared to be walking/standing for a very long time. What helped for me was to buy one of those ice packs at Daiso or something and use it to just chill my tired feet after a really exhausting day. Most hotels don\u2019t have a freezer option in their fridge though but still chill enough to keep the ice pack cool. \n\nOr, if money isn\u2019t too tight and depends on the depth of your ankle pain, hop into a foot massage place for maybe a 30-min massage. It really helped a lot. If not, onsen is really good too.",

They were utterly boring imo, it's a bunch of people setting up tents and selling stuff bazaar style, I went to both - I only bought some snacks from one, and the other sold mostly fruits/local produce, and it was so sparse like less than 10 tents/stalls in each. Really disappointed, not sure if it's better now than it was in Jan/winter. \n* Recommend the [Takayama Retro Museum](http://retromuseum.jp/index_en.html), same vibes as the Showa-kan (first I've heard of it), and you can play a bunch of games as well like old consoles, etc. \n\nDay 6: \n\n* Looks like a tiring day of mostly travel, I'm aware you can rest on the bullet trains in between but having to keep alert for when to get off, managing luggage (if you aren't using a delivery service), is going to be tiring in reality. Just pointing this out, doable but keep it in mind, especially with your injury. \n\nAlso, it's fine to have a time scheduled but keep in mind it *won't* happen 100% in reality, and some parts look tight with shops closing times, etc that can leave you being unable to do what you've planned. \n\nGetting around Tokyo will take a lot more time than other places due to how dense it is, and having to navigate around even a single station, so always keep a buffer for that. \n\nGet proper walking shoes that are comfortable, rest when you can. You can easily walk over 20k steps a day so do take care. Hope you have a good trip.",

I think it really does vary quite a lot based on time of year / what is in season. \n\nFor the Retro vs. Showa Museums I would recommend going to the one that most aligns with your interest in the era. The Retro focuses more on games and toys, and Showa Museum is more of a walk-through set comprised of small town streets, houses, shops, and a classroom. There are toys around on display as well, and an old-school pachinko room, but it\u2019s more of an exploration and photo opportunity museum. If you want to play old video games and look at action figures, Retro is the one, but if you want the illusion of walking through a showa-era Japan and take photos, Showa Museum is better.",

            "comment": "I highly suggest using Uber/taxis instead of public transportation.  I have sesamoiditis in my right foot and went to Japan a few weeks ago in an air cast.  The most difficult times for me were using public transportation. The amount of walking up and down stairs and standing while waiting in one place really killed me (especially carrying my backpack and pulling roller suitcase).  For some reason, we always find escalators going one way but not always the other, and there's not a lot of places to sit.  I once sat on the waiting area floor when I couldn't take it any longer and the stares were SO bad.  It's also incredibly difficult and painful to use all of those muscles in your feet to keep your balance on the trains when there's nowhere to sit (even with my boot on, I did not always get a seat).  Also, I should note, the only people that use elevators are elderly and families with strollers, I always felt too guilty to use them myself, especially with a long line.\n\nOther than that, I was able to go to many shrines (picked ones with short entries), Super Mario World, the deer park at Nara (hired a rickshaw), bamboo grove (only went in for a bit and walked out), and lots of other places without issues.  The most challenging was probably the monkey park in Arashiyama which was right next to our hotel so i knew it would be a hike but still wanted to go.\n\nI think as long as you know your limits, take lots of breaks, and plan accordingly it's definitely doable.  \n\nFYI: We removed teamlabs from our itinerary after seeing a video on YouTube. You have to remove both your shoes, walk in water, and then each room after that looks to have really unstable ground, with no shoes on. Don't feel bad if you can't go, I heard it smells like feet pretty bad in there (makes sense lol).",

In the cases where there's a bypass route available, they were holding a sign indicating how to take the bypass route (typically it's \"turn left down this corridor instead of going into the room\"). If you're unsure, you can ask them, they'll all speak english. As far as I can tell, the bypass route basically walks you around the room with the exhibition and you rejoin the route immediately after.",

Perfect for easing any foot pain.\n\nSome tips, at Hakone-Yumoto station they have luggage/bag delivery to the hotels in the area for a decent price depending on the size of your bags. I can\u2019t remember the exact price but it was around \u00a51500-2000 for a large backpack. They sent our bags straight to the ryokan same day. We got to sight see right away and when we checked in our bags were waiting for us!\n\nNot sure what room you have at the ryokan but they offer 45 min private baths in one of their larger baths that you can reserve for that afternoon/evening. Yama no Chaya only has 8 reservation spots so it\u2019s first come first serve. We checked in at 4 PM and were able to snatch the last private bath reservation! Even though our room had its own bath, the private reservations was a nice chance to experience the other onsen they had to offer. The private onsen was much larger than the one in the room. \n\nAlso, if you want to stay an extra hour at Yama no Chaya you can pay \u00a53000 to check out at 11 AM instead of 10 AM. I liked this option since we loved how relaxing the ryokan was and didn\u2019t want to leave right after breakfast. \n\nHope you have an amazing time!",

We bused from Owakudani and even then I was a little nervous walking on the road from the stop to the ryokan.

We were at the amesake tea house and were gonna bus back and didn't realize there's only one bus every hour for the most part.  \n\nAlso i think doing the bus to he lake and the pirate ship to the ropeway is the better route than the opposite as if you had a clear day you get better views of Fuji.  If you have time and are up to it we really enjoyed the open air museum,  its one stop down on the train from Gora.  There is a bit of walking but a good amount of seating as well so only if you are up for it.",

Japan is very strict when it comes to some medications. For example, you can't bring Nyquil here.

Honestly any place you go will intrinsically involve tons of walking to and from the station, around all the rooms and paths, etc. I wonder if bringing or buying a walking stick will help? And i second what others said about taxiing if the bus and train stops arent pretty much right outside the location. Split between two people it\u2019s really not so bad depending on how far youre going. Good luck!",

No idea if the venue you are going to is going to be like that, but it\u2019s probably unlikely to be stadium style seating. I personally ended up getting uncomfortable pretty quickly and needed to stretch out a few times, might be an issue with your ankles!\n\nFor your first day I would also factor in a lot of time waiting to get into places like the Pok\u00e9mon center. I\u2019ve seen pretty hefty lines to enter, but depends a lot on the day.\n\nI\u2019m actually staying very near to your hotel near Higashi-Shinjuku (Okubo is a nice area!) but just some general points\n\n-\tYou will often get suggestions to take the JR lines to Shin-Okobo station and walk to your hotel rather than take a metro like to Higashi-Shinjuku. This is fine but just be warned the street that the JR station is on is pretty crazy like everyday, especially weekends. So many people and very slow moving crowds. It takes a lot longer to walk down that street than Google says\n-\thigashi Shinjuku has a few metro lines. The Tokyo-Metro Fukutoshin Line has an exit right by your hotel, but there are some stairs at the very end. We have been taking that line a lot, but it\u2019s often the deepest and hardest to get to line at other stations. The Oedo line is also through there but there is some weird transfer situation a few stops down which means you need to get off the train, up and down some stairs to get to the right platform. Also quite deep (\n-\tin most cases there are always escalators except for the last section leaving the station.  (EDIT - just walked by the exit and seems there is an escalator up) https://i.imgur.com/13As6EB.jpg\n-\tShinjuku station is very walkable from that hotel.\n\nOne final thing, you can buy ibuprofen and Tyronel drug stores but a lot of them have caffeine in them",

It was the only ones available and we thought seeing something was better than nothing! The seats are chairs going by the photos since we're right at the back so thankfully that'd be alright for my ankles. \n\nThe metro lines at Shinjuku are downright confusing for me when I'm searching over Google maps. I was hoping it'd be clearer when we're actually there in person. I am pretty stressed out when thinking about all the stairs at transits to get to correct platforms. Thank you for the input on the metro lines and the walkways! It's very helpful to know. :)",

There are very visible signs and symbols for each you just need to follow.\n\nOne of the reasons it can get confusing using Google maps is that if you search a route a few min apart it may suggest a completely different route since generally there are multiple options and it depends on which trains are coming first. Once you get familiar with the stations your hotels are near you should be able to make a decision on which path is best for you ( e.g it might be easier to wait 10min for the next train at your current station rather than take another train and transfer in a rush at a busier station)",

    "postText": "***(Title should say Kabukicho, not Roppongi... I am jet lagged and brain dead at the moment :) )***\n\nI thought this was an exaggerated stereotype but nope. Apparently Japan STILL has this issue: I just returned from 18 days there and had an extremely pleasant, safe experience with all people in the country... except for the Nigerian(and Yakuza?) gangs who apparently run Kabukicho at night! \n\nBe careful travelling alone at night in Kabukicho you may risk a fight in the worst case scenario. Even if you mind your own business, avoid eye contact, walk quickly by... it can still happen!\n\nIt was about 12AM. After ignoring the scammers on the streets outside Golden Gai, (of which there are many, by the way) I was followed by one of them when I went down to a basement alley-like strip mall area to get to a bar down there. \n\nThere was nobody else in this basement hallway. Just us. The dude got in front of me, was touching me/holding me from passing. I tried ignoring him, but I honestly could NOT move forward as he would push me backwards with a friendly smile on his face. Asking where I was going, how I should see his \u201ctitty bar\u201d etc. I was more polite than I should\u2019ve been for about 10 seconds, considering the situation, and then I snapped, got in his face and started yelling at him, saying what the fuck do you think you're doing? and was about ready to prematurely defend myself if this carried on but he yelled back fuck you, let go of me quickly without any more harassment and scampered up the steps back to the streets.\n\nMy buddy also told me he saw the same thing happen to a French woman, right outside Bar Champion, except she was apparently held/not allowed to pass for around three minutes before the guy finally gave up (or possibly stopped pick pocketing her?)\n\nThis is not a show-off story or a story to discourage solo traveling, but a post to let everyone know how serious it can be and how suddenly it can happen, even in Japan, which has this (deservedly true) reputation for being extremely safe. I got lucky he wasn't with his friends. otherwise it's 4 on 1... \n\nIf you travel alone in Kabukicho at night: be prepared to possibly face physical contact, for minding your own business. I wish this wasn\u2019t true but it is.",

If something seems fishy, it probably is. Following strangers to \"second locations\" is always highly discouraged unless you can independently verify the individual is not connected to crime (ie: meeting a fellow traveler at a bar is probably safe, for example).\n\nIf you avoid the obvious hostess bars, scam bars, etc. Kabukicho is a perfectly fine place to spend an evening.",

            "comment": "I literally was drugged just last week in Shinjuku/Kabukicho by a dude who said he was from Ghana. Pretty horrible and traumatic experience that cost me $1k. But I'm honestly just happy I wasn't physically hurt or worse.\n\nWe casually started talking about soccer outside of 7-11 and he invited me across the street to have a beer with him. I didn't think much of it, just thought he wanted to keep talking about soccer and have a beer. I had zero indication that he had bad intentions and I had not read anything about this happening all the time, until after the fact.\n\nAfter drinking a beer together, he offered me a shot of Jager that was laced with something and it completely fucked me. Him and his boys forced me into the back of a car, while I was hardly even conscious. I tried fighting back but was so drugged that it did nothing. I ended up waking up, the next day at 2pm, somewhere on the other side of Tokyo with no phone and $1,000 charged to my credit card. Thankfully an amazing cab driver could tell I needed help and helped me into his car and drove me back to my hotel in Shinjuku.\n\nI reported it to the police, and the US embassy, even showed them the bar it started at but they said they couldn't do anything without physical proof of me being drugged. So I was completely out of luck and even had to buy a new phone.\n\nI've traveled all over the world solo and never even considered being drugged, so it was not at the front of my mind.. Be safe everyone.. and although it sounds racist/stereotypical, don't EVER trust African dudes in Tokyo.\n\n(That being said, Tokyo is still the safest city i've even been to, not including that one area and one group of people who clearly target naive foreigners...Avoid them and avoid Kabuchiko and you will be perfectly fine)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm also a 6'5 Male who is in good shape - so this can realistically happen to anyone.",

Police often don't want to intrude into other people's affairs, but they often fail to intrude when you need them to. It has been a while but you should check to see what they spent the money on. I often get people saying that I'm too crass and bold, but never in my life have I been more greatfull of that trait. It almost happened to my friend and I in the same manner, exept I have a great people perception. The guy seemed suspicious and when he geabbed my friend's arm ( white passing half japanese half caucasian dude ) so I yelled that we won't go with him and we won't buy his bracelets in Japanese and English. Then I grabbed my friend's other arm and ran away. We were on a school trip so we were just 16 and 18 at the time and leagally minors in Japan so we would have been in a world of trouble had we been taken.",

They are often pretty right wing and a lot of them are into the traditional thing so they are usually nationalist. So they dont see you as real people.\n\nBut they work in the bar and club business and in Tokyo, particularly at the moment, tourists are their bread and butter, so they will try to keep everything as cool as possible. It is not a worry for most people, but if you are in a club in central tokyo and you start acting up you may encounter them.",

He was a young kid who had never been outside the country as far as I remember. I just googled it and I could only find the link above, there used to be a lot more online about this.\n\nBasically it seems like that here was this young guy who came out to Japan with his friends. They went to Kabuki cho and got drunk, and it seems like at some point Kang was approached by some guy who got him away from his friends.\n\nHe died in an elevator, and there was a security camera in the elevator but it only showed a frame every 15 seconds. He was in there with a guy and one shot showed him doubled over.\n\nAt the trial the defence tried to suggest that by bending over he was making a sexual advance to the guy who clearly tried to take his money and punched him and he fell and broke his neck.\n\nThe whole thing was fucked up. A yakuza killed a tourist by mistake, but it was a Korean so, they didnt even give the guy up. They fought it. and they won. They gambled on the fact that he was Korean American and noone would care.",

There are a few simple tips that should keep you safe.\n\n\\- First, Golden Gai itself is safe, very safe. It's a very tight community, many of the mamas will go drinking to other bars of the GG when they're off themselves, there are absolutely no touts and the most obnoxious people are groups of drunk tourists. Quite sure a tout would be in a world of trouble would he set foot inside the GG, and any spiking or similar would be met with furor. The furthest touts go is a few meters West of [Bar Champion](https://goo.gl/maps/DSTb1xks2QB3zWaX6), but not behind that point. Once you're inside GG, you're good. Would you be in trouble, you can probably look for safety inside a bar of the GG, though it may look a bit counterintuitive by the looks of it.\n\n\\- Many black touts operate around [Kuyakusho-dori](https://goo.gl/maps/F11oAwUw7iuTbbtB6) street, especially in the smaller streets West of it (around [Robot Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/pyDWPJ5fgef7DDw9A)). They hardly ever go South of [Yasukuni Dori](https://goo.gl/maps/xQeQMnkDHvst2Wgs8) avenue (too many people). There are no touts East of Golden Gai, in or near the [Hanazono shrine](https://goo.gl/maps/Pmg4rzAsT5RCPtg68).\n\n\\-The northern area of Kabukicho (around [here](https://goo.gl/maps/nkKgnm41sCQdvGp58)), where hotels and host clubs are, is also quite free of touts. Not a lot of bars, though...\n\nIgnoring touts (as in act as if they were nothing but air and no sound was coming out of their mouth) is usually enough to deter them. Also, don't look as if you're lost, just keep walking at the same pace, same direction, in a determined manner. They have weaker preys to hunt and will give up quickly. \n\nAfraid of touts, but wishing to go to GG anyway? enter by the East side, through Hanazono shrine or the street between the shrine and GG. There is a small police box ([Hanazono Koban](https://goo.gl/maps/TexbaUeXRsr1ffUa8)) and touts are not crazy enough (yet) to enter religious grounds or do their deeds right in front of the police.",

Like kabukicho isnt that big and most of the hotels there arent on the tout streets so i would also consider it to be safe. IMO people are exagerating how dangerous they are\u3001just dont look afraid and dont do stupid things like grabbing a drink with them. But im not a small dude so maybe thats why. \n\nTo get to the point imo most important point for a hotel is how close it is to a subway. In shinjuku my hostel/hotel was close to higashi shinjuku and that was perfect. If you really want to be safe just take a hotel just above kabukicho close to shin okubo maybe(it can be packed as it is a kpop streat and girls really like that place). \n\nIf you have questions you can dm me\u3001i stayed in shinjuku last week on my trip. I was there for 30 days so i know it a little bit",

            "comment": "Just to add my experience:\n\nI was a solo traveler and stayed in Shinjuku this past spring for a week. I\u2019d be out at night and sometimes walked quite a bit around the different neighborhoods of Shinjuku. \n\nI only had one \u201cbad experience\u201d where the typical African tout started walking with me for about a block and kept trying to ask me questions in such a way as to sound friendly and inviting. On the other hand I had already heard about stuff like this before my trip, so I still knew not to go along with the guy. Might\u2019ve been in Kabukicho since it was your typical lady bars/clubs everywhere neighborhood, but tbh I\u2019m not 100% sure. All I know is google maps told me to walk down that block and by the time I realized the kind of area it was it was too late. \n\nAlso the funny thing was right at the end of the block, when you know you\u2019re \u201cout\u201d of it, there was an English announcement on speakers from the police saying a whole bunch of stuff about being careful not to engage with \u201chawks\u201d as there are reports of them mugging/drugging tourists and robbing them of tens of thousands of yen. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019ll add is that if you\u2019re new to a place you\u2019re visiting just read up as much as you can before you get there. Don\u2019t talk to strangers (unless there\u2019s a very good reason to). Avert eye contact. Etc. The basics. \n\nAh and one last thing, I\u2019ll echo what\u2019s been said already: Japan in general was the safest I\u2019ve ever felt in any single place. Like I was comfortable roaming in back alleys around midnight and didn\u2019t feel worried I\u2019d be jumped or anything.",

The trick though is to just avoid eye contact and when you notice somebody following you, go to a more crowded street and I know y\u2019all think Tokyo is safe but there are places here you shouldn\u2019t be in at night. \n\nAlso, avoid passing near the group of men huddling in the corner of the street at night or around midnight. They may be Japanese or Nigerian, they kind of forcefully offer you something and it gets scary when they start to surround you. (I\u2019ve experienced this with my friend while we were passing by Kabuki-cho) around 12:30 AM. My Japanese friend told me to just cross the street if the men are huddled up in the street you are passing or walk in the middle of the street as there are no vehicles passing by at night or midnight.",

In fact I spoke to a couple of them before and one guy has a british citizenship ... after coming from Ghana.\n\nNow why do they do the work they do?\n\nThey come here for a better life of course. But with no Japanese skill and no degree, what can they do?\n\nThey know a friend who works for someone and they get that job has a promoter.\n\nBasically the promoter works for a guy who works for the Yakuza.\n\nWhy don't the police do anything? Well just like most big mafia gangs, they pay the police.\n\nIt sucks and it won't be disappear at all.\n\nJust stay safe, have your wits about you and don't be alone in that area.\n\nThese 'promoters' are humans, they can be nice people. But when they have a demand to meet, they get pushy. If they are making money to live off, then they will get it no matter what.",

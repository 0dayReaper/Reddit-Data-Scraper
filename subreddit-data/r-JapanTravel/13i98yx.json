    "postText": "**Pre-trip**  \n\\- ESIM  \n**Transport**  \n\\- Pasmo card from boyfriends mom  \n\\- Kansai WIDE Pass  \n\\- Shinkansen (Tokyo&gt;Kyoto)  \n\\- Tickets for attractions  \n\\- USJ  \n**Hotel**  \n\\- Tokyo- Asakusa (Asakusa Tobu Hotel)  \n\\- Kyoto - Shijo (Hotel Wing International Kyoto Shijo Karasuma)  \n\\- Kinosaki Onsen (Hanakouji Saigetsu)  \n\\- Osaka - Namba (Frasers Residences)  \n\\- Kimono booking  \n\\- Cash (40k Yen)  \n\\- withdrew 40k more yen within Japan (Revolut)  \n\\---  \nTravelled to Japan during Golden Week, was definitely really nervous because everyone kept saying not to travel during this time, but we had already booked the tickets way in advance in November.  \nI am generally really sensitive to crowds and waiting, but I will do it if it is \u2018worth\u2019 it.  \n**Day 1; 30 Apr:**  \n\\- Arrived at 10pm;  \n\\- Immigration took about 1-1.5 hours to clear at Haneda airport  \n**Day 2; 1 May:**  \n\\- Shibuya  \n\\- Walking towards Harajuku - Kiddy Land!  \n\\- Omotesando hills  \n\\- Asakusa dinner + Sensoji temple  \nWindow shopping and lunch in Shibuya was great, it was actually really empty for some reason. There also appeared to be a workers\u2019 rights-related protest there?  \nIt rained quite heavily in the evening which cleared up the Sensoji temple crowd\u2014 the place was really beautiful at night and there was basically no one!  \n**Day 3; 2 May**  \n\\- Puroland  \n\\- Mori Art museum sunset  \n\\- Dinner at Roppongi  \n\\- Stopped by Ginza Mitsukoshi otw back  \nThis was a really packed day, but had loads of fun! Would love to do a separate trip report on puroland so let me know if you\u2019re interested. It was great fun, as a Sanrio lover, and the crowds weren\u2019t as insane as I thought they would be.  \nSaw online that the view of sunset from Mori art museum was better than shibuya sky\u2019s, and decided to go for it. The tickets were also substantially cheaper and we could enjoy a really interesting exhibit at the same time!  \nMitsukoshi\u2019s food stores had mostly ALL sold out by 8pm.  \n**Day 4; 3 May \u2014 Official GW public holiday**  \n\\- Ginza  \n\\- Mitsukoshi  \n\\- Walking around  \n\\- Ueno  \n\\- Ueno toshogu garden and shrine  \n\\- Ameyokocho  \n\\- Asakusa Monja  \nWas very happy walking around Mitsukoshi, and Johan bread was super delicious. It was quite crowded but generally queue times below 5-10 minutes  \nUeno had a lot of street food stalls, and walking around the park area was very pleasant.  \nContemplated going to akihabara later in the evening but we just headed back to Asakusa.  \nQueue times were so crazy, but since we lived around the corner we put our names down, went up to chill for 1.5 hours, and popped back down just in time.  \n**Day 5; 4 May \u2014 Official GW public holiday**  \n\\- Shimokitazawa  \n\\- Kichijoji  \n\\- Inokashira Park  \nShimokitazawa was pretty disappointing, and I felt like the stretch of shops was mainly confined to one street. Not sure if I was just in the wrong areas, but it was really underwhelming. Thrift shops were also super expensive for clothes in okay to poor condition clothes.  \nWent to Kichijoji so my partner could go to Nike running lab (pretty good prices!) and enjoyed ourselves there more. The streets were more pleasant to stroll around and there were loads of cute cafes and shops to look at.  \nEnded off the day at Inokashira Park and had a JBBQ dinner (Wagyu!). This had a 30 min queue, but it was SO worth and it seemed to be a local hotspot.  \n**Day 6; 5 May \u2014 Official GW public holiday**  \n\\- Asakusa Gyukatsu (this is actually just a chain of Gyukatsu Motomura, not sure why there\u2019s a different name)  \n\\- Nakano Broadway  \n\\- Shinjuku - Kabukicho  \nQueued for gyukatsu since it was just below our hotel 50 minutes before opening. Somehow became the second group of people to get in, meaning that I waited a total of 50+45 mins to get in. Felt like crying because I was so hungry LOL but food was good. Was it 1h45 min worth of waiting? Perhaps not for someone who hates queueing.  \nNakano broadway was fun but I couldn\u2019t really participate in purchasing manga since it\u2019s all in Japanese. Had loads of gacha machines here and we went crazy. Taito station (claw machine) also occupied us for a long time.  \nHeaded to Shinjuku to wander around (and get sucked into more claw machine shops). Accidentally wandered into Kabukicho area and would not recommend solo female travellers to go here. Loads of shady characters standing around, and I was there before 9pm.  \n**Day 7; 6 May \u2014 Saturday**  \n\\- Naka-meguro  \n\\- Daikanyama  \n\\- Omotesando (Le Labo, CDG)  \n\\- Asakusa Kowakata Dozeu  \nNaka-meguro area was alright, I guess it\u2019s only super famous during the cherry blossom season.. There were some cool vintage shops but nothing within our price range.  \nDaikanyama was a nice residential estate, but honestly nothing much to do. Tempura motoyoshi was a famous sweet potato tempura icecream, and was pleasant. Not sure if it was worth travelling to Daikanyama for though.  \nThis day was a little disappointing and felt a bit \u2018wasted\u2019 for our last day in Tokyo.  \n**Day 8; 7 May \u2014 Sunday**  \n\\- Travelling to Kyoto from Shinagawa station  \n\\- Gion at night  \nNot much, just travelling. The shinkansen was so fast it gave me a headache haha.  \nGot my hair cut by my old hair stylist that moved back to Japan in Gion. Ate a quick abura soba dinner (delicious) and headed back since it kept raining. Most shops closed at 9pm  \n**Day 9; 8 May**  \n\\- Kimono rental  \n\\- Yasaka Shrine, Kiyomizudera, General wandering around  \n\\- Hanamikoji district - catched a glimpse of a geisha!  \nFelt nervous about kimono rental because it would be really hard to move around if it continued to rain. Thankfully the weather was fine! Kyoto seemed to have the most number of people wearing kimonos.  \n**Day 10; 9 May**  \n\\- Fushimi Inari shrine - 840am reach  \n\\- 840-1045 climb  \n\\- Head back for lunch  \n\\- Take train to Kinosaki onsen (1.25pm)  \nFushimi Inari wasn\u2019t that crowded, there were loads of pockets where there were no crowds in sight. Weather was 19 at its high but it was soooo hot.  \nReached kinosaki onsen at \\~3.50pm. For some reason a lot of shops were closed. We went for a private onsen that our ryokan provided, had a wonderful yakitori dinner and hopped around 2-3 onsens afterwards.  \n**Day 11; 10 May**  \n\\- Onsen hopping  \n\\- Cycle to Genbudo park, lunch, Itsukushima Shrine (3.5h rental)  \n\\- 1 last onsen before pass expired at 3.30  \n\\- Train to osaka  \nSuper fun and scenic route, even though my cycling sucks. I also got a sunburn even though I put sunscreen so please be careful!  \nOur favourite onsens were: Goshono-yu, Ichino-yu (walk behind to access the cave part!) and satono-yu. We love the outdoor parts! Really thankful that the weather was cooperating too and not hot.   \nOne of my favourite days in Japan!   \n**Day 12; 11 May**  \n\\- USJ - Wrote a separate trip report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/13g1q0b/usj_trip_report_11_may_2023_thursday_with_queue/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  \n\\- Explore Namba at night  \n**Day 13; 12 May**  \n\\- Breakfast in Namba  \n\\- Nara day trip - Todai-ji temple  \nReally fun and scenic! Deer were friendly and cute. Those that fed them seemed to be chased around and nibbled. so I am glad I didn\u2019t buy the crackers.  \nIt was worth paying to enter the temple, but didn\u2019t pay for the museum so can\u2019t comment on that.  \n**Day 14; 13 May**  \n\\- Osaka castle park  \n\\- Osaka aquarium  \n\\- Dotonbori  \nThe aquarium was fun, but their main attraction is obviously the whale shark. Good to look at the feeding schedule to time your trip well.  \n**Day 15; 14 May**  \n\\- Dotonbori  \n\\- Rinku-town outlet  \n\\- Flight from Kansai airport  \nDotonbori for last minute souvenir shopping, takoyaki queues were insane so we gave that a miss (my partner doesn\u2019t like squid anyway and I\u2019m not too hot about takoyaki).  \nRinku-town was so expensive and selection was quite limited. The only store really worth purchasing from there was the Sanrio store. We put our luggages in coin lockers at the station (500 yen outside the gates).  \n\\---  \n**Overall thoughts**  \n1. Japanese people are okay with long queues, as are tourists. They will not shy away from a long queue. Often times, hole-in-the-wall establishments are just as delicious even without the hype. The best sorts of restaurants are the ones that let you leave your name. Helps to know how to write your name in hiragana/katakana or just use your initial.  \n2. Activities that required cash  \n\\- Noodle shop vending machines  \n\\- Kinosaki onsen  \n\\- Nara (sometimes)  \n\\- Gacha and claw machines  \n\\- Eki-bento from Shinagawa station accepted card payment via suica/pasmo only, so I just paid with cash.  \nMost other places accept card.  \n3. Walking shoes are so important! Averaged 20-25k per day wandering everywhere.  \n4. Uniqlo socks are cheap here (and also the only apparel-related purchase we made)  \n5. Gyukatsu queue in Osaka was better than in Tokyo  \n6. Kansai WIDE passes have to be redeemed, and it was so hard trying to find the right machine to do so. Please buffer time to find the machine. (especially for the trains to kinosaki onsen from kyoto which only come once in 2-3 hours.)  \n7. Being Asian was quite stressful because most assume that we can speak Japanese. Picked up some basic Japanese for convenience stores and restaurants was helpful.  \n8. This was our first time back in Japan after close to a decade. My partner and I were okay missing out on super touristy stuff so we could spend more time exploring.  \n9. If I could redo this trip, I would cut down on the last day in Tokyo and add another day in Kinosaki Onsen to explore Tottori/ San'in Kaigan national park, but am pretty happy with the itinerary! :) Also wish that I had time to see Kinkakuji in Kyoto but will save that for next time!",

I stayed at Comfort Hotel Kiyosumi Shirakawa and loved it.\n\nIt\u2019s right next to a Tokyo Metro station (2 lines as well!), so could get to most major Tokyo destination in 30-40 min max. Surrounding neighborhood has great food and activities (check out the nearby Japanese garden), yet has a quieter, hipster vibe which was super refreshing especially when you spend a whole day at hectic places like Shinjuku.\n\nHotel also had free breakfast. Highly highly recommend!",

I would see the clerks and service people be super accommodating to white tourists but gave us snarky looks and service. \n\nA few workers noticed my Canadian Flag and were like \"ohhh Canadian\" and then we got more english service. \n\nWestern Asians going to Japan will face the \"Chinese Tourist\" experience :(",

I speak English for the first few sentences and then use Japanese. I do this so that I'm not mistaken for a \"Chinese tourist\". Most Japanese people cannot understand English, but they can easily recognize fluent English. I have found that this helps.",

People would get super confused as to where the english is coming from. \n\nEuros get really confused though since they don't run into asian people who speak english normally so when I talk to them in english as in, helping them get around, or telling them to move because they are blocking the train doors, you can see the ?!?!?! in their eyes.",

There were 3 Japanese women, and a white couple also in the elevator. Well, on one floor, the 3 Japanese ladies were a little confused as to what floor the elevator stopped on, and they kept the doors open for about 30 seconds. After I explained to them (in Japanese) that they were on the right floor, they exited. One moment later, the white man says to his wife in a loud enough voice for my mother and I to hear, \"Daffy Japs\". Then the woman says \"Shhhhh\" to him. To which he says, \"they don't understand us\" (referring to my mother and me). After about 2 seconds, I turned to them and said, \"Yeah, they were daffy Japs alright. Those daffy Japs kept the doors open for at least 30 seconds. Those daffy Japs. The only thing I can't stand more than daffy Japs are those Japs who speak fluent English, like me\". \n\nI saw the woman's eyes practically bulge out of their sockets.",

            "comment": "&gt;Being Asian was **quite stressful** because most assume that we can speak Japanese.\n\nBeing Asian myself, I feel your pain. I've been studying Japanese consistently since 2015 and I'm no where near fluency. When I start talking to someone in Japan, I usually start out with a couple of sentences in English just to warn them I'm a non-native speaker. Then I continue with Japanese. But the Japanese hold us to a higher standard because we're Asian. And they come at us with \"machine-gun Japanese\". It's a good learning experience, though. \n\nWhat did you think of Asakusa Tobu Hotel? Was it a 4 star hotel?\n\nWas it difficult to navigate through Immigration?",

We had room service every day, a 24 hour concierge, as well as washer-dryer machines (helpful!)\n\nImmigration was okay, it was just a really long line. There was another QR to leave after collecting the luggage though, which held us up for 10-15 mins.",

                    "comment": "Great stay! A little tiny, but most hotels in Tokyo are. It is in a tourist district so the first thing you see when you pop out of your hotel are tourists, but it\u2019s surrounded by loads of food and you and see sensoji at night or at the crack of dawn. \n\nThere was a washer-dryer machine which we used (since we stayed in Tokyo for 6/7 nights). We could use our Pasmo-suica to pay so that was super handy. \n\nThey also sell tourist subway passes at the counter which we bought the 3 day version of. However just note that they can\u2019t be used to exit outside \u201cTokyo\u201d, which basically ends at Shinjuku if you\u2019re going towards the west. so you can use the subway pass until that point, then you have to tap out and pay for a ticket/use the transport card from that point onwards. \n\nLastly, there is a lift up from the train station but I think it\u2019s located at the yellow line exit (not sure if they\u2019re connected though, they should be!) Google maps will tell you to exit out of exit 5, but that requires you to climb many flights of stairs. It\u2019s something to consider if you have a lot of heavy luggage, but my partner and I got by just fine. \n\nHope this helps, let me know how else I can help:)",

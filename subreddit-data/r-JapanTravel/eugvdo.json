    "postText": "## Other Guides\n\n* [An Osaka Specialty Coffee Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/ezj5nx/an_osaka_specialty_coffee_guide/)\n* [A Kyoto Coffee Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/euugy7/kyoto_coffee_guide_inspired_by_uramenporns_tokyo/) (by /u/aGeriatricHobo)\n\n## Preface\n\nEdit: **If it's not in this list, very likely I haven't gone and it might be on my to-go list. Tokyo has way too much good coffee and I don't have nearly enough time to try them all.**\n\n**Feel free to skip this section.**\n\nThis is sort of a guide/listing of much of the coffee I've consumed in my recent travels to Tokyo. It's aimed mostly at coffee aficionados or those who are interested in specialty coffee. Hopefully my coffee addiction helps you in some way.\n\nCoffee is one of my hobbies. I drink probably too much of it, and one of the things I do when I travel the US or internationally is find coffee shops to relax, drink, and talk to the staff. I concentrate most specifically on specialty coffee and third-wave coffee shops and roasters, which are focused on a host of things like fair and equitable coffee sourcing, quality of beans, and coffee quality.\n\nJapan has an interesting coffee culture - it's famous for being the birthplace  of canned coffee, buying up most of the world's annual supply of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans, and for the traditional tea/coffee shop called the [_kissaten_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissaten). In the last decade, there have been a growing number of specialty coffee shops throughout the country, as well as a growth in the number of coffee roasters.\n\nThis post isn't a comprehensive list of coffee shops in Tokyo, nor is it even a complete list of coffee shops I've tried, but it's a good start. I'll mostly be ignoring places that are essentially equivalent to places like Starbucks/Dunkin'/Tim Horton's, so that means most places like Doutor and UCC won't be included.\n\n## Additional Notes\nSpecialty coffee is rather expensive in the grand scheme of coffee, and it is especially expensive in Japan. A normal coffee shop like UCC might charge you 150-350 yen for a cup of drip coffee or an espresso-based drink, whereas a specialty coffee shop will charge more like 350 - 800 yen for the same drinks. For pour over coffee, you can expect to get maybe 200 mL (~6.8 fluid ounces) for that money, which is anywhere from 30-50% less coffee than you'd get in the states for the same money. Espresso-based drink prices are roughly in-line with American prices for a similar volume of liquid.\n\nIf you buy coffee beans from specialty shops, you are looking at the equivalent of buying them for anywhere from 4000-10000+ yen per pound. Compare to prices in the US, where I'd pay $25-50/lb for the same quality coffee beans.\n\nI will also add some important bits of info for each shop up front, like website, prices of the most common drinks, and language-friendliness. I speak English and a decent amount of Japanese, but I know a lot of tourists run into language issues so I will give my assessment of the staff and shop in regards to how friendly they are for English speakers.\n\n\n## Glitch Coffee\n* Location: [Jimbocho, Kanda](https://g.page/glitchcoffee?share)\n* Website: [GLITCH COFFEE&amp;ROASTERS - \u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc&amp;\u30ed\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba](https://glitchcoffee.com/)\n* English-friendliness: Menus and coffee descriptions in English. Some staff members speak good to excellent English. Has a non-Japanese staff member on some days.\n* Latte - 500 yen. 200 yen discount for additional drinks during same visit.\n* Pourover coffee - 600 - 2500 yen. 200 yen discount for additional drinks during same visit.\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Coffee Bean Selection](https://imgur.com/2XP3Xut)\n\t* [Shop Exterior](https://imgur.com/ltckQpi)\n\t* [Shop Interior](https://imgur.com/yKMwbJl)\n\nIf you're a coffee enthusiast, Glitch would be the only place on this entire list I would say you should go out of your way for. And go out of your way you will. They're located in the business-y part of Kanda, near Jimbocho Station. I walk the kilometer here from the Kanda or Akihabara areas multiple times every trip.\n\nThe coffee shop is very modern in design, and can get very busy and packed, with only a few tables and some counter seating. Their main clientele are local employees and tourists. Of all the coffee shops I've been to in Japan, this one had the second-most number of tourists I've seen, because the shop is extremely famous in the coffee community and appears on all sorts of \"Best of...\" lists. And the fame is well-deserved; all the coffee I've had here has been fantastic.\n\nFor pour-over coffee, they normally have a selection of 6-8 coffee beans you can choose from, with prices ranging from 650 yen for some of their mainstay coffees like Ethiopia Kochere Sakoro to 1500-2000 yen for some of their most interesting coffees like their Geshas or anaerobic-processed coffees. As a huge fan of Ethiopian coffees, their selection has never disappointed, and I've had at least 4 different staff members make me pourovers with many different beans. The coffee has always been fruity, sweet, nicely acidic, and sometimes has really surprising notes.\n\nFor those who prefer milk and espresso, I like both their flat white and latte. My wife has at least 2 lattes every visit, as Glitch's are her favorite in the world. A combination of their beans and the milk they use (from Hokkaido) produces a latte that is naturally exceptionally sweet without a lot of the coffee taste she can't stand.\n\n## Fuglen Coffee\n* Location: Asakusa and Shibuya\n* Website: [FUGLEN](https://www.fuglen.no/)\n* English-friendliness: Basic menus are in English, most staff members speak decent English.\n* Latte: 520 yen.\n* Pourover coffee: 500 - 800 yen.\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Shop Sign](https://imgur.com/Xp6liyG)\n\t* [Shop Interior](https://imgur.com/JaQ2oqH)\n\nI've been to the Asakusa location multiple times, located at the edge of the Sensoji area. This is a coffee shop from Oslo, Norway which, strangely enough, has more locations in Japan than they do in their home country.\n\nThe Asakusa location is quite spacious, with two floors, and despite being located on a street with heavy pedestrian traffic, I've never found it to be overly crowded any of the times I've gone, even in the middle of the day. The aesthetic is modern, with the second floor looking like it came out of the 1970s. I've been told this is a very Norwegian aesthetic.\n\nTheir coffee is quite nice - the beans are roasted Nordic-style, so they are going to be a little acidic. This comes out even in their milk drinks - I've had multiple cappuccinos and cortados there, and the coffee is very palatable, balanced, and smooth. My wife isn't much of a coffee drinker, but she has ordered multiple mochas here and loves them, which is high praise from her.\n\n### The Roastery by Nozy Coffee\n* Location: [Jingumae, Shibuya](https://goo.gl/maps/Zo3zoZzG9P2UvMzw8)\n* Website: [MENU(E) | THE ROASTERY](https://www.tysons.jp/roastery/en/menu/)\n* English-friendliness: Menus in English, all staff spoke excellent English.\n* Latte: 500-1000 yen depending on coffee bean choice\n* Pourover: 680 yen regardless of bean choice\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Shop Exterior](https://imgur.com/ny5uZmf)\n\t* [Shop Interior](https://imgur.com/EVXjKWz)\n\t* [The agepan stand next door](https://imgur.com/v9e3Q7n)\n\nCoffee is a very individual thing, but I will say this up front: I do not like this place. This is completely counter to everything else you'll read on the internet, because The Roastery by Nozy is considered one of the top coffee shops in the country by tourists. I had both a latte and a pourover here, and both tasted exceedingly normal with no special qualities to either, which was disappointing given the prices they charge. I would equate their milk drinks to being like a slightly better Starbucks. If you were in the area and considering going here, I'd instead recommend going elsewhere in the area, like to Chatei Hatou, which I will list next.\n\nThe staff are super friendly and the space is large, but it will feel cramped because this place is in an extremely busy shopping district and attracts a lot of people. It also attracts a lot of tourists, which is probably why all the staff members speak really good English.\n\nOutside this place is a tiny cart that sells pretty good _agepan_, though, so if you're around, I'd buy it for a snack.\n\n## Chatei Hatou\n* Location: [Near Shibuya Station](https://goo.gl/maps/PUZSqiHQxRdrNfmf6)\n* Website: None\n* English-friendliness: Basic menus in English, staff do not speak English.\n* Cappuccino: 950 yen\n* Pourover: 800-1000 yen depending on bean\n* Quirks: This place requires everyone in your party to order a drink. They are _very particular_ about where you sit.\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Shop Sign](https://imgur.com/IDdEzzT.jpg)\n\t* [Shop Interior](https://i.imgur.com/sAIjEeJ.jpg)\n\t* [Cappuccino and Cafe](https://i.imgur.com/6ToMUL0.jpg)\n\nChatei Hatou is a _kissaten_ that's been around for 30+ years, so it's a lot more traditional. Their coffee beans are charcoal-roasted, so they end up being very robust in taste. I actually find their coffee very drinkable black, but I'd probably be considered the minority here. Having been here several times, I find their coffee smooth and very full-bodied, and the staff pays a lot of attention to their brewing as well as what your coffee is served in. I've seen the head barista (whom I affectionately refer to as Mad Hatter) change the cup he wanted to serve my coffee in right before pouring it.\n\nChatei Hatou is also famous for chiffon cake, and usually has several flavors available. The cake is delicious, light, fluffy, with airy frosting, and pairs well with the dark coffee.\n\nI guess it also has to be mentioned that this place was the inspiration for the founder of Blue Bottle Coffee.\n\n## Blue Bottle Coffee\n* Location: Various (I went to the Kanda one)\n* Website: [\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc](https://bluebottlecoffee.jp/cafes#tokyo)\n* English-friendliness: English menus, staff at my shop spoke decent English\n* Latte: 500 yen\n* Pourover: 600-700 yen\n\nIt's Blue Bottle - the taste is consistent across continents. I generally like their coffee and I'd pick it over The Roastery by Nozy if given the choice. It's always a perfectly fine place to grab a coffee if you need one and beats out Japan's more standard offerings of Doutour/UCC/etc. \n\n## Cafe de L'Ambre\n* Location: Ginza\n* Website: None\n* English-friendliness: basic English menus, a couple of the younger staff members have excellent English\n* Coffee prices: 700-1100 yen - they don't do steamed milk drinks and instead do coffee-with-milk\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Shop Sign](https://imgur.com/qv3c56X)\n\nAnother _kissaten_, Cafe de L'Ambre is from a very different time. It was founded in 1948, and the owner passed away in 2018 at the age of 104. This place serves only coffee, coffee-based cocktails, and some coffee-based sweets like pudding and jelly.\n\nIt is very much the antithesis of places like Blue Bottle or Glitch, being very dark, very smoky, and exceedingly cramped. This is a place that gets very crowded during the day time with salarymen and a fair number of tourists.\n\nThey roast a very wide selection of coffee beans from all over the world, and they use Hario Nel drippers to make their pour overs. I only drink pourovers when I go to Cafe de L'Ambre, and while I'd prefer pourovers from Glitch or some other shops on this list, their coffee is robust, smooth, and flavorful.\n\nThe major draw here should be some of their coffee cocktails, though. My wife always gets the Queen Amber here, which is a sweet, cold milk and coffee-based drink served in a champagne glass.\n\n## Streamer Coffee Company\n* Location: Various, I went to the original location in Shibuya\n* Website: [STREAMER COFFEE COMPANY | HOME](http://streamer.coffee/)\n* English-friendliness: Full English menus. The person who served me was a native English-speaking Japanese-American.\n* Latte: 500-800 yen\n* Pourovers: Not available\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Shop Exterior](https://imgur.com/dfXeWXO)\n\nI'm going against the popular sentiments you see on sites like Yelp: I'm not a fan of Streamer Coffee's coffee. They are very much an espresso-oriented coffee shop, but I found their coffee to be exceptionally dark, so all the flavors I got out of their drinks were just \"dark roasted coffee.\" Their drinks are also overly sweet, and many of their coffee drinks are very Starbucks-style with things like caramel swirls and other additives. Their latte art game is on-point, though.\n\nI feel this is the place you'd go if you wanted coffee that tasted like what you'd get from mass-market places like Starbucks.\n\n## Sarutahiko Coffee\n* Location: Various, I went to one of the new locations in Akihabara Atr\u00e9 shopping center\n* Website: [About\uff5cSpecialty Coffee Shop in Ebisu, Tokyo/ Sarutahiko Coffee](https://sarutahiko.co/en/about/)\n* English-friendliness: English menus. Staff at my shop spoke mostly Japanese.\n* Latte: 430 yen\n* Pourover: 400-600 yen\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Shop Exterior](https://imgur.com/U0supXE)\n\nThis is a specialty coffee chain that's been aggressively expanding over the last two years or so. I think they fall into the trap of having way too much choice in terms of coffee bean selection and drinks, but I found their latte perfectly fine for something that cost 430 yen. I'd say similar to a Blue Bottle.\n\n## Faith Coffee\n* Location: [Shibakoen/Hamamatsucho/Daimon area in Minato](https://goo.gl/maps/dcwggJsGk8L3w2ep6)\n* Website: https://faith-coffee.com/\n* English-friendliness: I don't know, owner and I spoke in Japanese. Basic English menu.\n* Pourover: 500-700 yen\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Shop Interior](https://i.imgur.com/CaOs85C.jpg)\n\nIf you find yourself in the Hamamatsucho area, perhaps because you went to Tokyo Tower or goshuin-hunting at Zojoji or Hoshuin, you can't go wrong with getting a coffee at Faith Coffee.\n\nThis place was founded by and run by Reiji, a Q Grader (a certification recognizing an ability to judge the quality/taste of coffee beans). He is a nice and friendly guy who roasts all the coffee the shop brews/sells, and while the shop is small, it is airy and wasn't particularly crowded.\n\nThe only choices you get here are pour over coffee, chai, and apple juice. You get to choose from the several beans the shop is roasting at that time, and I'm fairly certain that the shop doesn't offer anything like sweeteners or milk, so you should like your coffee black if you come here.\n\nThe coffee itself was nice. I picked an Ethiopia Aricha and Reiji poured over my coffee with a Hario v60. The coffee was nicely acidic with some strong citrus notes, very drinkable.\n\n## KOFFEE MAMEYA\n* Location: [Omotesando](https://goo.gl/maps/4FJchryK1UsXoZFP9)\n* Website: [KOFFEE MAMEYA](https://www.koffee-mameya.com/)\n* English-friendliness: Staff members speak very good-excellent English.\n* Pourover: 500-1000 yen\n* Pictures:\n\t* [Coffee bar/selection](https://i.imgur.com/0AKMFfQ.jpg)\n\nI'm going to start off by saying a few things:\n\n1. Koffee Mameya _is not_ a coffee shop\n2. Koffee Mameya _is_ a coffee bean shop\n3. I think intermediate/advanced coffee enthusiasts would enjoy it most\n\nI list those things because I want to set up expectations, and because I see a lot of people who line up for this place and not understand what it's really about.\n\nKoffee Mameya sells a variety of coffee beans that they source from roasters throughout Japan and the rest of the world. They do not roast any of their own beans. At any given time, they will have between 20-30 coffee beans available for sampling and purchase. \n\nYou should go with the expectation that you will spend 2000-4000 yen on coffee and beans, and to expect to line up for at least 30 minutes just to \"order.\"\n\nI say that last part because the entire experience is similar to buying a car. There are typically three baristas working behind the bar, and each one almost always focuses on just a single customer (or related group) at a time. There aren't really any time limits to how long a barista will spend with any particular customer - the first time I went, there was a customer there who spent at least 45 minutes there, drinking a cup of coffee and talking with the staff about pop culture.\n\nWhen it is finally your turn to meet with a barista, the barista asks some questions to gauge your coffee knowledge. This really dictates how your overall interaction and experience will be. Since I'm a hobbyist, my interactions at Mameya are about what kind of coffee flavors I like, and discussing things like brew methods or favorite coffee shops. Many people who go to Mameya tend to be tourists who are coffee newbies, though, and so their discussions are more focused on basic things like how to make coffee or why different coffees cost such differing amounts of money.\n\nAnd on the money bit, as mentioned, expect to spend a fair amount here. If you want to sample any of the coffees, the barista will brew a cup for you, for 600-1000 yen per cup. If you wanted to buy coffee beans, they normally cost 1800-5000+ yen for 150 grams of coffee. In American terms, this works out to be about $50-150/lb.\n\nStill, Mameya is a fantastic experience for coffee lovers, especially if you have 60-90 minutes of your day to burn on waiting in line and then talking with staff. I'd recommend trying anything from MOMOS Coffee (a South Korean coffee roaster) if they have any, as well as anything from Coffee Collective (a Danish coffee roaster).\n\n----\nAnd since people are curious, my ever-growing list of \"Want to Go\" in Tokyo:\n\n* Unlimited Coffee Bar - Tokyo Skytree area\n\n* Bear Pond - Shimokitazawa\n\n* W/O Coffee Stand - Shimokitazawa\n\n* Switch Coffee - Meguro\n\n* Light Up Coffee - Kichijoji\n\n* Passage Coffee - Shiba, Minato\n\n* PEACE Coffee Roasters - Nishishinbashi, Minato\n\n* Maruyama Coffee - multiple locations throughout Tokyo and Nagano\n\n* Coffee Elementary School - Shibuya\n\n* Onibus Coffee - Nakameguro\n\n* Nozy (original location) - Sangenjaya\n\n* About Life - Dogenzaka, Shibuya\n\n* Dear All - Sasazuka, Shibuya\n\n* Cafe Obscura - Kanda/Akihabara area, Sanjengaya, and Hiroshima\n\n* Little Nap Coffee Stand - Yoyogi, Shibuya",

One of the few places where I saw kopi luwak coffee. Very modern Japanese type of place. \n\nAnd Coffee Roasters (Hibiya) - kind of hidden on the 3rd floor of Hibiya Midtown. Great ice coffee and is part of a larger unique and Showa-style designed food court. \n\nTajimaya Coffee House (Shinjuku) - Kissaten style, dark roasted...the kind of ice coffee that tastes better in a copper cup but they serve it in a champagne flute. Still good, but popular with tourists as it\u2019s right next to Piss Alley. \n\nKugutsusou (Kichijoji) - coffee place with an underground cave setting. Coffee is also kissaten style with a nice deep taste. Their curry seems to be a popular item too. \n\nAnd there\u2019s a lot of more to list at the moment, but those are the ones that pop out to me.",

I\u2019ve found drinking coffee in Japan to be a good way to get recommendations and chit-chat with shop staff - Mameya told me about a really cool tea house in Shibuya, and I was told about a good coffee shop called Tasogare in Osaka by staff at a retail store who was talking to me about coffee.",

It was in Shibuya. I was in Shibuya. Yet, I never made it there because I prioritized another spot from their Japan series (Chocolate Cake) and the Nintendo Store. Anyway, if you're in Tokyo somewhat regularly, maybe it'd be worth checking out? I'd certainly be curious to hear how it compares. I hope I'll be able to go back sooner than my previous visit-gap (which was 12 years).\n\nAs my consolation prize, I bought a promotional bag of artisanal coffee samplers from Tokyu Hands, which I've been grinding at home for drinking and keeping relatively poor track of what's what (the two pouches I've made so far haven't been my style, but they were definitely interesting).",

Coincidentally, it was the very first thing we did in Japan, but only because it was quite close to our hotel - we just picked the nearest coffee spot and what a great little place it turned out to be!\n\nWe also manged to confuse the poor guy running the shop when we went to pay, as we had been given a few JPY bills by my wife's grandparents that were left over from their last trip to Japan and figured it was as good a place as any to use them. Turns out their trip was in the early 80s and the bills were no longer legal tender! He wondered where the heck we had gotten them from.",

                    "comment": "Will write up a better post about Osaka soon giving my impressions of places, but here's a quick-hit list of places I'd **recommend** or **not recommend**:\n\n## Osaka\n\n* Unir Coffee - Hankyu Umeda department store 9th/10th floor\n  \n  It's a kiosk that sells drinks and beans, I went there a couple times. I like their cappuccino and shakerato. The latter is amazing on a particularly hot day, too!\n\n* LiLO Coffee Roasters - Shinsaibashi\n\n  This is one of my favorite places. They do pourovers and I think they do espresso - you might get analysis paralysis from how much choice they give you for coffee beans. Tends to get very busy and swarming with tourists because it's in a major shopping area and the shop has become pretty famous since it's one of the original specialty coffee places in Osaka.\n\n* Tasogare - Shinsaibashi\n\n  This is a few blocks away from LiLO and is much less busy. I'd say it's relatively unknown to non-locals. It's very hip-hop in style, they play Japanese hip hop music, and they have a lot of interesting coffee bean choices with origins that are pretty uncommon, like coffee from Yunnan China.\n\n* ALL DAY Coffee - Osaka Grand Front building\n\n  This is a kiosk in a food court-style area, in the basement of the Osaka Grand Front building which is next to JR Osaka station. They do pretty good pour overs and also espresso drinks.\n\n* Brooklyn Roasting Company - couple locations in Kitahama and Namba\n\n  These are the Japanese outposts of Brooklyn Roasting Company from NYC. They make pretty good coffee and I find the Kitahama location to be a great place to relax - they have an outdoor patio that is right next to one of the rivers that run through Osaka.\n\n* Takamura Wine and Coffee Roasters - Nishi, Osaka\n\n  This one's a little out of the way, but it's a really cool place. It's actually a huge wine shop that sells a lot of imported wine from America and Europe, but they also have a coffee roaster/shop. I'd recommend getting an Aeropress, they have a former Japanese Aeropress champion on staff and it's a shop specialty. Has a variety of bean choices.\n\n  They also sell a very cool Kalita Wave dripper that's black and gold and hand-made by metalsmiths in Tsubame, Japan.\n\n* Mercedes Me / Downstairs Coffee - various locations including Grand Front building\n\n  I would **not recommend** this coffee shop. It's a coffee shop that's attached to/run by(?) Mercedes-Benz dealerships in Osaka. The coffee is rather pricey but I think the allure is really Instagram. They're located in very nice-looking car dealerships and their milk-espresso drinks can have very fun latte art done, perfect for social media.\n\n  The coffee itself is Starbucks-y - very dark, not too much in the way of unique taste. Expensive for what it is, too, I think I paid 550 yen for a latte.\n\n----\n\nThere are other famous ones I haven't had the chance to try in Osaka yet, like Mill Pour and Mel Coffee Roasters.\n\n----\n\n## Kyoto\n\nI've only been to a couple coffee places here: Cafe Kurasu, which have locations next to JR Kyoto station and near Fushimi Inari shrine. They make a great pourover.\n\nHowever, Unir Coffee's main store is located at the Marui department store here.\n\nI've also been to Cafe La Madrague which is more like a kissaten - they're famous for their egg sandwich, but I unfortunately showed up too late for one and they were sold out. Coffee was okay, nothing super special, but I like the decor and atmosphere - it was like walking into the 1960s.\n\nFor more about Kyoto, I'd recommend this very new thread from the r/Coffee community:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/eupzgx/kyoto_coffee_guide_inspired_by_uramenporns_tokyo/\n\nSome places on that list that are on my to-go list are Weekenders and Lights Up.",

Coffee shop hopping is fun to do in Japan and I\u2019m glad to read that there are so many other places to check out and try (and from a quick skim, a few to avoid).\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve enjoyed Arise Coffee Roasters in Kiyosumi-Shirakawa, and Cafe Bach just south of Minami-Senju station, all in Tokyo. The owner of Arise was pretty enthusiastic about his coffee collection and even made some recommendations for follow up visits, so I look forward to that.\n\nWhat excited me about reading your list is the few places listed in Shimokitazawa. I love spending a day there anytime I\u2019m in Japan (I can\u2019t explain it well but to me it\u2019s very relaxing) and I haven\u2019t been to those stops before, so I am definitely adding them to the list.

    "postText": "A tiny reminder to the community that we do follow the news and we also have very thorough and more or less up to date information on transport regarding:\n\n* [JR Pass](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Airport to city transfer](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airport/transportation/)\n\nSome tidbits that are not covered by those articles:\n\n* Suica app and Apple Wallets do not work well (simply put not at all) with foreign-issued Visa cards - this is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon as Visa sees IC card payment system as a direct competitor to its Visa Contacless Payment standard.\n* [Smart-Ex website/app](https://smart-ex.jp/en/index.php) has some fairly interested rebates for Tokaido, Sanyo and Kyushu shinkansen if you intend to book your travels sufficiently in advice.\n\nSome tidbits that need to be emphasised:\n\n[Japan Rail Pass](https://japanrailpass.net/en/) is official JR webpage. \n\n[Official reservation site](https://www.japanrailpass-reservation.net) is the only site you can book JR trains prior to getting a physical copy of your pass.\n\nUse [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/?c=10&amp;sub_lang=nosub) website/app or NaviTime app in conjuction with Google/Apple Maps (some use with regarding to bus schedules and locating bus stops) for your JR Pass calculations and transport planning,\n\n**Get an IC and JR pass holders. The number of people losing either their IC cards or JR Passes has been lately rather insane.**\n\nWe also would like to remind you not to use third-party providers for booking train tickets in Japan. All train tickets can be bought/booked 30 days in advance and third-party proxies do not have earlier access to those tickets:\n\n* [JR East ticketing website (Eki-net)](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/reservation.html) - also for booking JR Hokkaido trains\n* [JR Central ticketing website (Smart-Ex)](https://smart-ex.jp/en/index.php)\n* [JR West ticketing website (5489)](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/overview/) - it allows you to book JR Shikoku's, JR Kyushu's and most of JR Central's, JR East's Kanto's Nagano/Niigata's areas trains\n* [JR Kyushu ticketing website](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train_reservation/service/)\n* [Odakyu's website](https://www.odakyu.jp/english/passes/) for Hakone Free Pass, Romancecar etc.\n* [Keisei's Skyliner website](https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/e-ticket/en/)\n* [Tobu's website](https://www.tobu-ticket.jp/guest/EBA01/GEBA01010.xhtml_) for booking limited express trains to Nikko/Kinugawa Onsen \n* [Kintetsu's website](https://www.kintetsu.co.jp/foreign/english/about/limited_express/index.html)\n* [Nankai's website](https://www.nankai.co.jp/en_railway/traffic/exticket.html) for rapi:t and Koya-san limited express trains\n* [Meitetsu's ticketing website](https://reservation.meitetsu.co.jp/En/top)\n\nThose sites should cover majority of your ticketing (or reservation needs) during your stay in Japan.\n\nMy coverage plans for foreseeable future:\n\n* update JR Pass FAQ as soon as more information becomes available (including unfortunately price hikes for single fares);\n* making non-JR Pass transport passes page as comprehensive as JR one;\n* scheduling best of regional passes discussion threads.",

The plastic holders you get from the ticket office, if you want to use them, are weirdly too long to fit in most wallets. I sewed a coin purse with a JR pass holder before leaving and it was better but I still wished that the plastic pass holder was small enough to slip into my wallet if not my coin purse. It wouldn't have worked in my folding wallet, it was too stiff to fold. It was super nice, but didn't fit anything I had on hand, even my partner wouldn't use it in her purse because it was a weird dimensional size that didn't fit into any of the pockets except the cavernous depths of the main purse.",

We'll be sticking around Tokyo from Oct 15-21 (15-20 around Tokyo, then 21 at DisneySEA), then using the JR Pass starting on the 22nd when we head to Kyoto/Nara/Osaka/Hiroshima. \n\nWhy is it bad to use Klook? It seems like it's not prime travel season so just picking a seat the day of travel should be fine for us, right? Or is there something I'm not understanding by using Klook. I'd like to get our passes before Oct and it seems like the only way is to get it mailed to us by purchasing 90 days beforehand. \n\nAs for Suica and IC, I'm a little confused. So a friend gave me her IC card from her recent travels. Do I need to get a separate Suica card or does the IC cover everything metro related in Tokyo and Kyoto?",

You will not be mailed an actual rail pass, it will be a voucher; when you go into the office to exchange it for your  rail pass, they will confirm you are an international tourist by checking your passport, and the visitor stamp you got placed in it when you arrived in Japan. I imagine this procedure is necessary to prevent criminals from buying rail passes at a discount out of the country, and then taking them back there to use even though you are not a tourist, or to sell them for a profit (like scalping concert tickets). There is nothing wrong with Klook; they have some great deals, and are very easy to use. I just returned from a three week trip to Japan, where I used Klook for several events and even some Tokyo Disneyland tickets. I did, however buy my JR rail passes directly through  \u201cjapanrailpass.net\u201d because I if you buy your tickets through them directly, you can also make seat reservations right away for any Shinkansen trips you have planned (and we also bought green car tickets so we wanted to take advantage of our reservation options) - when you use other websites, you have to wait until after you pick up your physical/actual rail pass to make seat reservations. Additionally, when purchased directly at their website, you can pick up your seat reservation cards at the same time as picking up your actual rail pass when you arrive, rather than having to figure out the station machines to make your reservations and/or print them out. Of course, you can always go into any J.R. rail office where they will help you make reservations and print out reservation cards for you.",

I'm assuming the JR site tells you which stations are available for exchanges? \n\nWhat site did you use to find out the time the station's office opens? Our hotel has a direct path to the Toranomon Station. If I go there by myself (in the off chance jetlag hasn't destroyed me, but my husband and kid are passed out still), can I still exchange and book all 3 passes for my family? \n\nAnd what if I don't know what trains we want to do when? All we really know is we want to go from Tokyo to Kyoto, with a pit stop to an onsen on the 22nd. From there, I don't know which days we'd want to do Osaka or Nara or Hiroshima or if we want to combine any of those in one full day or what. Is there any way to just hop on a train while we're in Kyoto without having to plan out each day in advance and still find seats? \n\nAND ;-) if we do book the trains in advance, but then decide we want to do something else that day is that ok? Can we just not go on that train and show up for a different train the same day? We'd love to be a bit flexible somewhat. I would hate having every day planned to a tee, esp if we're dealing with weather or an over-traveled 10yo. \n\nOof, this is a lot. I appreciate you!",

It's confusing, all these options and ways and prices, and I just don't want to show up and then be like uhhhhh, this is all wrong ma'am. \n\nI can tell you in Seattle you either take the bus, walk, bike, or drive to places. Google maps will tell you how and that is that. So I feel like I'm entering a maze at the moment. Of course this is just one city and I'm dealing with an entire country so I get it's going to be different. Thanks for understanding.and trying to help. \n\nI won't be buying tickets for anything at the airport if I can help it bc I just know my family will be over the whole traveling part and then we still have customs and the hour long ride to the hotel. I'm getting the keisei Tix with 3 days of Tokyo metro 30 days before to get to the hotel straight after customs (we will likely only have carry ons with us). So my hope is to not be at the airport long if it's not necessary. I rather do the exchange at a station if I can figure out which stations do it and what times they open once I'm a bit more clearheaded and not worried about a potentially cranky 10yo ;-)",

Navitime was correct on schedules but we found it frustrating trying to get the entire itinerary the way other apps used to work. So long as we only input our origin station and destination station, we could get the next train's time schedule, and a little wiggle room for half an hour to an hour on either side. It's not ideal but it's the best app we could find.\n\nThat said, pre-planning 3mo out is too much anyway. Even if train schedule doesn't change in the meantime (it likely won't), you don't know how long it's going to take you to walk through the station to your platform, or arrive at/depart from your station. Inside cities like Tokyo and Osaka, trains run every 2-5 minutes, so missing one isn't a big deal you can just get the next one. In terms of shinkansen, you have anywhere from 10-30 minutes during peak hours to miss and grab the next one, and if you're going with non-reserved seats anyway, there's no need to panic. Over 18 days on the ground, we only reserved seats on the Hayabusa line to/from Sendai because it's required, otherwise we literally showed up whenever we were there and took whatever next train was going our direction, stepped onto the train and took non-reserved seats, and were never wanting for a seat. Most non-reserved cars were filled-ish but not 100% full, there were always a few seats open here and there depending on route and time of day - sometimes as much as half the car, but as little as 5-10 seats.  We constantly ended up with Navitime thinking we had no options but we'd show up at a station with 10-15 minutes to sit down and enjoy a beverage and still make our shinkansen with plenty of time to arrive at our destination, see our sights, get to our hotel, etc.",

I mean, hell - when we needed to reserve the Hayabusa to get to Sendai, we didn't even do so until we reached Ueda, and just went to a kiosk to reserve seats for the first train bound for Sendai after our arrival in Saitama. Boom, set. It was so damn easy I almost couldn't believe it. On our way back to Tokyo, we just showed up at Sendai station and reserved seats on the next train out. Even easier! Depending on the time of day and overall travel burden, your experience could range from slight annoyance to completely easy-peasy.\n\nthere are a lot of good train-related resources online, including exact walk-throughs on youtube, but honestly, after experiencing it first hand, I can say that the entire train system in Japan runs laps around any Western country and slam dunks anything in the US. It's stupid easy to use and you'll be almost taken aback at how easy it is to just get seats and go somewhere. Larger groups or families might need a smidge of planning work, but there's still wiggle room to just go with the flow day-of and still have a good vacation.",

Suica/Pasmo will cover the same stuff though and MOST stuff, so which you go with won't matter.\n\nIf you're in Tokyo - Subway will be exclusively Suica/Pasmo, but then you can find yourself casually converting to JR Lines depending on how far you go out, so that's where it'll be a maze a bit to you... people generally will use Suica's for Journey's they could of actually used their JR Pass on, but I mean it's 200 yen, so nothing major major unless you do a fair few trips a day, then I guess it's adding up quick.\n\nThe main line that'll get you to key spots in Tokyo is the Yamanote - entering and exiting that can be done with the JR Pass. Yet loads will just not be aware and use their Suica when they have a JR Pass. It's also slower than using the Subway.\n\nI mean you could probably do a legitimately good trip of Japan while just using the JR Pass should it cover your whole trip - if you stay within walking distance of any of the Yamanote line Stations - I don't think I've used an IC card at all outside of Tokyo... though I'm sure I should have on some buses but driver just waved me on when showing my JR Pass, I dunno.",

Unless you bought your Pixel in Japan, it cannot function as a virtual IC.  So we need a physical card for the pixel user and need to go to a kiosk and use cash to refill it. For me with my iPhone/watch, I can refill it in about 10 seconds from anywhere for any denomination of 100 yen.  No physical card to keep track of either. It is significantly easier for Apple users.  However for Shinkansen, you can book multiple tickets and distribute them to physical IC cards right from the app which is super handy.",

That said, you're right - since the pass needs to be taken out and run through the gate every single time, you need something that has quick take out/put back access that is also secure enough to hold the pass between uses so you're not doing like I did and constantly checking your Pass Pocket (tm) to make sure your pass didn't fall out. Or like the person who almost lost their pass on Mt. Misen! There isn't anything I've seen already-made that serves this purpose, alas.",

We still have 1000Y sitting here unused from that refund. IC cards are useful in a lot of unusual places but when we had the cash on hand anyway, we kept paying in cash rather than IC. Also of note - we had a LOT of problems using our ICOCA cards (issued in Osaka when we landed) for buses and other situations in remote parts of Kanto, like Nagano and Sendai. The \"universal\" adage isn't quite, so if you're planning ot do any traveling outside of Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka, there might be issues.\n\nDamn ICOCA cards are our priciest regret, we lost 500Y plus whatever was still on it, each, because even konbini won't do partial charges - you can't just use what's on the card and then pay the balance in cash. It's all or nothing.",

We are staying in Toronoman Hills so we'll definitely be needing the metro more and thought it was a solid deal for my family of 3.\n\nThe bit I'm stuck on is if I should buy the combo deal online or at the airport. I understand you have to collect your ticket at the airport anyway, and that getting it at the airport is more expensive. But it seems that if I do it online there's an extra step of trading the e-voucher to the regular voucher before getting the ticket. Where exactly would you do that trade if I got them online? Is it the same place where you trade the voucher for the ticket? Does the airport ticket counter sell the combo as well or is that only on the internet? Is buying directly at the airport = a drastically shorter line?\n\nNext, we will end up having to transfer from Ueno anyway, but I don't want to start our Metro until the next day since I doubt we'll want to do much on the first day (we'll likely not even get to the hotel until 8pm is what I'm guessing, we arrive in Japan at 4pm-ish). I have a Pasmo card from a friend. Can I refill that card at the kiosk and then get my family their own cards? Furthermore, I'm assuming I just need 1 card for my family (or do we each need our own card)? EDIT: Discovered that I need 3 cards for each of us.\n\nThanks again! Y'all are saving me big time.

It felt like you have to first exchange the e-voucher to a voucher, and then go somewhere else to exchange the voucher to the ticket. I'm all, this is so dang inefficient! Thank you!!",

I don\u2019t know about that, but for just the discount skyliner ticket bought directly from keisei there was just the one step. The only weird bit was the way you had to buy it. I filled out all my info, hit submit, and then it sent me an email with a link to complete the purchase and pay. It worked just fine but the process was really odd",

I'd get more savings out of one that goes to Sapporo but either way it will still work for a 14 day pass (but not 21). I guess my uncertainty comes from regional passes...\n\nWe plan on getting an IC card (Suica) for Tokyo use, a Kyoto 2 day pass and maybe a further one day pass, an Amazing Osaka Pass for the 2 days we will be there. I have read there are some Fukuoka tourist passes and something for Kanazawa too but I have not found an equivalent for Sapporo haha...travel is going to be such a big expense. I cry.",

While the old passport-style passes required you to use the manual lanes, they were much harder to lose and made a nice souvenir of the trip.",

Enter the Shinkansen gate, go to the right track and travel from Nagoya to Kyoto without planning it prior. No waiting in queues to buy a ticket or reserve a seat.\n\nNozomi trains (the fastest Shinkansens) on this route are not covered by JR Pass.\n\nOf course, do not attempt this during Golden Week or other high-traffic periods. But I did this during sakura and never had to stand.",

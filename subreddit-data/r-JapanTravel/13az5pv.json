    "postText": "Hello and thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this post, this is my finalized (unless someone here advises otherwise) itinerary for a Japan trip in June with a group of 4 guys. Its a total of 2 weeks trip so Im breaking up the post into 2, this is week 1 where we will be in Tokyo. I tried to simplify things but I have taken time to make a more detailed itinerary including train routes and times. Primarily just looking for feedback on realism of fitting everything in the day, and any little things I should be aware of such as restrictions etc\n\n6/7 - fly from Austin to LAX, then board ZipAir flight to tokyo. Will land in Tokyo about 2pm 6/8 Japan time.\n\n Thurs 6/8 - Day 1 Tokyo\n- Get through the airport (we did traveljapan web, we will use Airalo E-sim, and we opted for no JRpass)\n- Ride to the Tokyo Skytree \n- Eat dinner in the area\n- Go to Akihabara as thats where our airbnb is\n\nFri 6/9 - Akihabara day\n- Go to a maid cafe for breakfast\n- Explore the town, get some good pictures, shop, hit a few arcades, etc.\n- Go to the Art Aquarium Museum (by Ginza station) if we have time (would go at about 3:45)\n- Be at teamlab planets at 6\n- Dinner then return to airbnb\n\n\n6/10 - Shibuya\n- In the morning we will go to our next Airbnb in Shibuya\n- Minipig cafe in harajuku in morning\n- Takeshita street to shop\n- Miyashita park to explore and shop some more, definitely go to the ghibli store and a vinyl record store\n- Shibuya Sky. Want to be here at the perfect time to see sunset. I will book the tickets for this date as soon as they\u2019re available as I know they sell out.\n\n6/11 - Shibuya 2\n- go to the Shinjuku gyoen garden in the morning\n- Go to the sunshine mall\n- If we have time, go to Meiji temple. But they close early at 5:20 so we may not.\n- Go to a cat cafe somewhere\n- Return home \n\nMon 6/12 Shibuya 3\n- This is a spare day to relax and/or do any left over things. Considering enoshima beach or Nogeyama or Ueno zoo.\n\nTues 6/13 - Mt. Fujj\nThis day is assuming the weather allows us to enjoy Mt. Fujis view. We can also switch this day for Mon 6/12 depending on the weather\n- Go to Kawaguchiko station then use omni bus red line for transport.\n- Mt KachiKachi ropeway\n- Go to kawaguchiko natural living center (for pictures)\n- Arakurayama sengen park\n- Return to airbnb\n\n6/14 - Hakone\n- take romance car limited express to Hakone-Yumoto \n- At this point, depending on how much luggage we have with us, we will either go to our ryokan hotel (Mount View Hakone) to drop off our stuff, or bus to Hakone Shrine\n- Hakone shrine\n- Pirate boats at Moto-Hakone port\n- Hakone Ropeway\n- Go to Mount View Hakone earlier in the evening to enjoy the experience and Onsen\n\nThu 6/15 - Go to kyoto (will post this week separately)\n\nThank you for any advice!",

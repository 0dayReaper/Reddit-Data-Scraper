    "postText": "This literally just happened and I wanted to make sure people would be more aware and less dumb then I was! \n\nSo today I was at Shinjuku station with my sister waiting in line to top up( charge ) my card. As I was waiting I was approached by a middle age / old man . He kept asking where i was going and I have no japanese. I tried to tell him I was ok and that I was just waiting to top up my card. My sister stood off to the side looking up things in her phone.\n\nWhen a charge station became available he ran to it and ushered me to it. I was like I'm ok its fine I know how to do this thanks. Most of the time people are just trying to help. I always look Abit like a deer in headlights. Unfortunately it is my natural face so I thought he was concerned that I was lost. \n\nAfter toping up my card he demanded for my change. I was holding my purse at the time with my license in it and my bank card so I was terrified he would take it. I have a disability and would not be able to run after him if he did. He was extremely forceful, took the change  and he ran.\n\nNormally people are so nice and helpful in the stations but just beware as some are there to get money off you.",

It\u2019s very possible you were trying to be too polite, and saying \u201cOk\u201d (confusing, could be interpreted as \u201cOk, please help me\u201d) didn\u2019t help. \n\nIf you\u2019re ever uncomfortable or being harassed, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to drop all the nonsense about \u201cyou must be polite in Japan\u201d to throw a scammer off. Stand your ground. I\u2019ve walked away from so many scammers without so much as a \u201cgomen.\u201d They\u2019re  scammers and don\u2019t deserve your politeness. \n\n\u201cNO\u201d is universal in any language. It would also help attract attention if the guy did still end up being pushy with you.",

In my experience \u201cno\u201d is a very strong word in Japanese culture. Even when wanting to say no, usually the literal translation of their response would be something more along the lines of \u201cnot so much.\u201d  There is a Japanese word for no: iie, pronounced \u201ceeyeh,\u201d but the word is not often appropriate to use. In this situation, I\u2019d say it would be appropriate. Sorry to hear about your bad experience, I hope you have an amazing remainder of your stay!",

They are happy to help if you approach them but most of the time they won't go up to you. I think it's something about not wanting to bother people who may or may not need help? Like we don't want to insult by asking if they need help in case they get offended? \n\nIn the city center stations if someone approached I would be on high alert though as the scammers thieves etc wouldnt go for the change they would go for your bag or purse.",

They also usually have some capacity to help deal with foreign tourist especially in Tokyo or other heavy tourist areas. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re more safer ASKING for help than having a stranger butt their way into your problem. If you ask someone for directions and they go the extra mile, that\u2019s cool. But if someone is being persistent by injecting themselves into the situation regardless of if you asked or not, that\u2019s not cool. Just remember what you\u2019re uncomfortable with in your culture, isn\u2019t much different in Japan either. He was being a harassing scam artist and you\u2019re completely allowed to call him out on it. Most of us who live here have learned to ignore everything and I mean EVERYTHING. It\u2019s usually the tourist who try to play polite in Japan when it\u2019s not a situation that warrents being polite.\n\nSorry you experienced that.",

My husband says that when he went to uni in Tokyo in the 90\u2019s, these guys would hang out at the train stations near universities to try and scam the new students fresh from the inaka. The university would put out warnings every year.",

This was in 2014, mind you, and Google Maps were not as good then. So they had an area map opened, when a man approached them and asked them if they were lost. So he offered to show them to the train station and when they got there, he demanded they give him money. So I guess this has been happening for quite some time now.",

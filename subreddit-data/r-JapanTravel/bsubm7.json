    "postText": "We went up Fushimi Inari this week and really enjoyed it. BUT I have an urgent warning for those making the trek:\n\nWhen you reach the big \"crossroads\" area, with the wonderful view of Kyoto, you may be tempted to get ice cream. The only ice cream available at that station is vanilla; soy bean flour; or vanilla mixed with soy bean flour. \n\nIf either of those is EXACTLY what you want, then go ahead and get some!\n\nBut you should know: if you continue up the mountain just a couple more minutes, there's another stand. And that one has ice cream in LOTS of flavors: chocolate, cookies and cream, citrus, soda, mint, strawberry... (I'm going by memory here but I'm pretty sure that list is accurate.)\n\nDon't settle for soy bean flour if you'd rather hold on a tiny bit longer for something else!\n\nThis has been a public service announcement.",

Our AirBnB is near Fushimi Inari so I'm wondering if we can just walk over there upon arrival or will it still be too crowded at that time. I'd like to avoid the crowds as much as possible.",

Forget about getting any photos without people in them at the bottom.  If you time it well going up in the evening, the midway viewpoint has an awesome sunset/night shot of Kyoto.",

            "comment": "While strolling down the Ginza on a close-street Sunday, back in the Eighties, I overheard a young couple ask a kiosk salesgirl for chocolate ice cream. They got back a vanilla cone with chocolate syrup. What followed was a fifteen minute back-and-forth debate on how to pronounce chocolate very slowly. The young salesgirl didn't understand. Do want chocolate syrup or not. As my job was interviewing Japanese all day long, on topics of my choosing, I raised this with my clients. First of all, the salesgirl wasn't hired to be bilingual. If the couple wanted to shop, they should have brought along an interpreter. Secondly, cultures vary, and back then Japanese markets were slowly introducing dairy products to consumers, and began the ice cream fad by only introducing vanilla. Turns out, vanilla instantly became way more favored than any other flavor. The Fushimi visitor I hoped did his transaction in Japanese, understood that while American supermarkets can have zillions of varieties of one thing, that kind of choice is oftentimes severely limited or even missing in places where space is given over to more popular items. During my time there, Japanese ice cream did go on to introduce other flavors, including wasabi, but not in all locations.",

Turns out, there was a restaurant up the side of one hill and he was their ice cream delivery guy. No, he wouldn't sell them along this route. The place had street access and a parking area, but the story translated to me was that his way was cheaper. So he was hired. I think his seniority and relationships had more to do with it. But, for the life of me, I've forgotten where that was!",

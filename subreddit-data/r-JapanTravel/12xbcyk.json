    "postText": "From what I understand, the Kyoto buses have a flat rate of 230 yen. I am with my gf and the first time we got on, it went smoothly after we inserted 500 yen (gave us 40 yen as change). On the way back on the same bus (206) to Kyoto station, we tried to insert a 500 yen coin for the two of us again. It was processed by the machine, but the bus driver didn't let us go down saying we still owe money (i think). So we were forced to insert another 500 yen coin. Ending is that we only got 40 yen as change from the total of 1000 yen we paid for our bus ride home. Is it just me or does this not make any sense at all? The driver didn't waste time trying to explain probably since he didn't know English.\n\nAny clarifications on this is appreciated. Thanks!",

You should be paying exact change in the payment slot and exact change only. \n\nThere are change/note conversion machines on busses (not sure about Kyoto though but ever bus I've been on had it) but you put your non-exact change money in, take smaller money back that allows you to pay exact change, and give the bus driver the exact change from change exchange, but that is a completely separate machine from the fare machine. \n\nThe change conversion machine should've given you 500 yen back in different denominations so you can pay exact and the fare machine shouldn't have given you change back.\n\nOtherwise maybe you went to/from outside the flate rate area? You didn't give destinations. The same bus number can be caught from outside the zone. Just depends on where you were when you caught it.",

My other guess was maybe they biked/walked outside of the zone and thought just catching the same bus number was enough. But some busses do leave the zone. However that other persons comment probably just means they overpaid and the driver was confused.\n\nSo something happened but I don't know what. I don't know where 40 yen came from because the change machine gives all change back and the fare machine gives none. Maybe the bus driver was being nice and handed them the 40 yen directly? And the second driver was confused and also decided to not bother with the over payment.\n\nBut yeah. OP should either buy a card or pay exact change. Individually. Per ticket. Not 500 for both.",

Running low? Don't need to find a machine to recharge.\n\nBring a portable battery charger with you if you are afraid your phone is going to die. The entire population there uses their phone for this very purpose as well. My wife and I had absolutely no issues using our phones as our IC cards when we went last month, and it streamlined our travel immensely.",

I didn't enjoy the idea of having it on my phone, so I instead kept it in a mini wallet on the back of my phone and tapped through.\n\nI never had to deal with filling it up outside of a station because frankly I never paid for my train fare. I had a six month pass that I secured every stop I could possibly want on there, so 200 yen on occasion wasn't draining my pass. I'd also typically put all the spare change I could on it, which helped a lot.",

On one or two occasions, I've seen people put too much money into the box, and the bus driver has had to open the whole side of the machine to give them their change back. Was that what happened the first time? \n\nOtherwise, it's possible that the second driver didn't realise you were paying for two people, or that someone before you didn't put the correct fare in and threw the driver off.",

They are essentially prepaid cards with maximum charge limits of 20,000 yen. 500 yen to buy one is a deposit which you can get the money back I believe but I haven\u2019t tried myself.\n\nUnlike non-Japanese Android (at least the ones I own), any iPhone allows you to read the smart cards so you can get an app to check your balance and transaction history and some apps even export them as CSV file. Currently only Apple wallet can emulate the smart cards so to spend via iPhone you can only use what Apple supports (Suica operated by JR East).",

            "comment": "I too am confused.\n\nfirst, yes, the flat rate per adult person is 230 yen (if it did not change since last november)\n\nthe flat rate does not reach to every single possible bus stop. there are some outside, or requiring an extra charge. they are rare though, and usually outside of where most tourist go around and way outside the city center. you usually take a number when you enter, with which you can calculate how many stops you went and that would be used to calculate the fare.\n\nthe flat rate in the flat fare area is per bus, and you pay it everytime you leave the bus. i.e. if you drive only 3 stations but you have to change bus once to go from a to b and from b to c and then d, you will pay the charge twice, once for each bus exit.\n\nthe flat rate needs to be paid exact change. there is a machine there where you drop the coins in. there is another machine close by where you can change 1000 yen to coins. I am not entirely sure how it goes when you need to pay 230 and you put in 300... if you waste 70 or if you get change back\n\nthere is also a one day bus pass. at least, there still is. it will stop selling in september and be still usable up until april next year. it can be bought at the bus driver, if he has them, there is no guarantee. that will require interaction with the bus driver and is the only instance of paying for the bus in which that is the case\n\n\nic cards are much more convenient when driving the bus, since you just go beep when you exit the bus and you dont have to fumble for coins\n\nnow I dont know what happened. maybe there was a misunderstanding, and maybe you got ripped off. but there is no point crying about spilled milk. just, in the future, be sure to have coins and drop them in when exiting. or better yet, if you still some time in japan, buy an ic card. they cost like 500 yen (or a little more but they come precharged for a little bit then) and you could get some of it back if you spend the time to return them which I would only bother if you have a lot unspend cash on them.  \nyou can also use the ic cards for most regional trains and some vending machines.",

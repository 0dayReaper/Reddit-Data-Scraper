I absolutely adored the area and would definitely recommend to every first-timer!\n\nAlso if you'd switch your plans for the 24th and the 25th you could check out the market at Kitano Tenmagu Shrine before you head to Arashiyama. It takes place on every 25th of each month. I thought it was pretty cool, we walked from there to Kinkaku-ji and then took the train/bus to Arashiyama.",

We also had an excellent steak lunch at Asakusa Imahan - fabulous shabu shabu and Japanese style seating. The lunch set was only about 4500 yen (you pay more than double that for the same at dinner) and they don't take reservations. We arrived 10:55 for 11:30 opening and got in the first sitting, highly recommend for one of your free Tokyo days!",

I'm not sure I would say it is near Arashiyama, but it is a fun flea market.  We went in 2016 or 2017.\n\nI would switch Tokyo Disney to 6/21 if you can.  Why go to a theme park on the week end?  All you get are more crowds and it is not as if you are staying on property.\n\nYou can download the app now and check out line times in advance, they are considerably longer on week ends than week days.  You will also will need the pass if you want to purchase any premier passes.",

Yeah, I am very aware of days of the week, because we are in Japan some of the same period as you and I wanted to be sure to be in Kyoto for shrine flea market lol\n\nWe also are debating checking out the hydrangea light up in Mimurotoji.  \n\nIt costs considerably more, but if you're into Pokemon, there is a limited time Pikachu themed afternoon tea taking place in June in Tokyo and Nagoya.  We're doing it in Tokyo and skipping the Pokemon Cafe this trip because the food is meh.  We're also going to one of the two limited edition Disney Cafes taking place in June.  (Both are outside of the parks.)  I've no idea if the food will be any good, but I am a sucker for limited edition events.",

We reserved with the special Pikachu dessert and one of the drinks.\n\nIt was Timeout or TDR or I can't honestly remember where where I learned about this Disney Cafe:  It might have been SupOsaka\n\n[https://suposaka.net/category/eat/](https://suposaka.net/category/eat/)\n\n(I did a Christmas themed buffet they posted about in Osaka in December and the food was amazing.)  I am looking at the Conrad's Chocolate and Cherry themed tea.\n\n[https://wondermovie.jp/information/](https://wondermovie.jp/information/)\n\nI was shocked because they are serving soy meat balls and a soy burger, which sounds like it might actually be vegetarian!  The merch looks super cute.\n\nFinally, someone on this subreddit shared about the Collab Cafe website.  It's where I found the other Disney Cafe (it's back a few pages) and while the food looks adorable, I am not sure I want two Disney themed cafes and the parks.\n\n[https://collabo-cafe.com/events/category/cafe/](https://collabo-cafe.com/events/category/cafe/)\n\nI am not going to lie the MatsuKen Samba Cafe looks freaking hilarious.  Even if you don't want to go or don't know who he is, just look at the offerings. \n\nEnjoy",

So you might need to move things around if you want to do it, because I think week ends tend to book up more.\n\nWe did the 8500 yen one, cause I want to try the drink and the pokeball.\n\nYou can also look into the take-out tea if none of the dates work for you.  That does have availability for pick up over the week end.\n\nIf you're not planning to get the special set with chocolate Pokeball you can see if any of the Nagoya reservations work for you or try to go on 6/22 when you travel between Tokyo and Osaka since Nagoya is on the way.\n\nWe're going on the day we come back from Kansai, before checking into the Tokyo Ambassador Hotel for Disney.  My friend we are going to Disney with works, so  we will do the tea and then try to meet her for TDR.",

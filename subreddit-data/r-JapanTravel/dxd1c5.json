    "postText": "My son and I just completed our 10 day trip in Japan and we really enjoyed our trip. It was both our first time in Japan and we are definitely looking to come back as there was so much still left to explore. I would just like to offer some tips for other travelers, hopefully to make your visits as pleasant as ours was. \n\n1) Shinkansen and Subway/Bus planning/purchasing can all be done via your smartphone. Before we left for Japan, we set up our iPhones with a virtual Suica card and downloaded the SmartEX app to buy our bullet train tickets to Kyoto and Osaka. We linked our bullet train tickets to our phones\u2019 virtual Suica card and we were able to simply tap our phones to get inside the Shinkansen platforms. No waiting in line, no purchasing beforehand from a company and have to pay them to deliver it to your hotel. Every transit trip we made, whether Shinkansen, bus, or subway, we used our virtual Suica card on our phone and it made everything super easy. There are the JR rail passes that can save you money, but for us it wasn\u2019t much and we wanted the flexibility to take any train we wanted. Some Shinkansen trains do not accept the tourist JR passes. \n\n2) All the shops here even breakfast restaurants seem to open at 10:00-11:00. My son and I are early wakers and usually get up at 6:00 so it surprised us that we couldn\u2019t visit most of the restaurants/shops until later on in the day. We checked out Akihabara at 8:00 and found everything pretty much closed so we were a bit disappointed. Haha. If you do wake up early, instead of shops and restaurants, visit the parks and temples that are open. It was nice to see a bunch of the historic landmarks in the early mornings without having to fight through a swarm of tourists. \n\n3) Visit a local Izakaya, even if you don\u2019t speak much Japanese. If it\u2019s not super busy, most izakaya hosts will go out of their way to help you and introduce you to an array of small dishes. One izakaya owner, who was super sweet pulled out her smartphone for us and showed us pictures of all her dishes to pick from. When my son and I were in Kyoto, one of the most memorable event was visiting a local izakaya there. The small and warm atmosphere of izakayas, and their slower pace of dining is definitely something to experience.",

We had rice, miso soup, fish, assorted meats, stew, salad, eggs, fruit, yogurt, rice porridge, etc. In Kyoto, we found this little cafe that had really good breakfast that was close to our hotel, but I am not sure why we only went the one time. I would definitely recommend them for breakfast it was called Coffee Club. Seriously the toast was amazing.",

We have a portable pour-over basket just in case!\n\nRegarding the app, we all are android so we are just going to get IC cards (I already have one PASMO that a friend loaned me). We are flying to Osaka. Plan 2 days there, then train to Kyoto for 3 days, then Tokyo. We are looking to get Nozomi tickets. How busy was the Shinkansen? We are looking to reserve seats.\n\nIzakaya sounds interesting--I don't recall reading about that!",

Some of them even have hot coffee!\n\nYou can still purchase Shinkansen tickets via the smartEX app even on Android. From the app you can enter in your physical IC card number and then it links it together and you can simply tap your IC card to get on the Shinkansen platform. It\u2019s super easy and fast!\n\nDefinitely use the app to reserve Nozomi train seats. When we took the train it wasn\u2019t that busy. You can reserve a ticket as far out as a month before or even as soon as a few minutes before the train departs.",

Simple check in and out, staff that knew English to an extent, and no worrying if the host will cancel. \n\nSome areas you won\u2019t be able to get by without any Japanese. The only time it was really ever a barrier was at restaurants. Would highly recommend making a note of some common phrases to use though. \u201cKore o onegaishimasu\u201d was probably the most used phrase by us. It basically means, \u201cThis please,\u201d which we used while pointing at things we wanted. \n\nBooked flights and hotels separately. We got a really good deal on our round trip flight and we just booked hotels at hotels.com. \n\nBoth of us probably spent around $650-$700 together.\n\nNot a super down to the minute detail itinerary like some folks do. Personally I think the best way to travel is pick a few locations you want to go to, and play it by ear on how and when you get there. We did a lot of exploring and walking, separate from our \u201citinerary,\u201d which led to us discovering a lot of cool things we had no idea existed. \n\nTo be honest I wouldn\u2019t say anything is \u201cessential\u201d to see. As long as your goal is to have fun and enjoy your vacation, everything will work out. I do recommend trying foods local to the city that you\u2019re in, and going to places you normally wouldn\u2019t go to back home. If a place looks good and you feel uncomfortable going there, push yourself to do it! You\u2019ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain!\n\nGood luck.",

    "postText": "I'll be traveling in a small group for ~1 month later this summer.  We'll be hitting up Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe for the duration of the trip.\n\nOf our group of 4, I'm the only one with a dietary restriction (vegetarian).  I'm aware that it's tough to be vegetarian in Japan, and I'm not trying to make my friends miss out on good food, so for the duration of the trip I've decided to go Pescatarian.\n\nI have 4 main questions:\n\n1) In the event my friends want a meat-focused restaurant (beef/chicken/pork) without vegetarian/pescatarian options, what are some fast food/common restaurant chains I'd be able to find in Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto/Kobe where I could fill up on (preferably vegetarian, but also pescatarian) options before going to their restaurant? Is it considered rude if I come with them to a restaurant, but don't order food/only order drinks/sides?\n\n2) Any particularly good convenience store food that's veggie friendly?\n\n3) Are there any \"must eat at\" restaurants in those cities that offer vegetarian options?  I'm not interested in a vegetarian-only restaurant, but popular places that have options in addition to meat for my friends.  Could be small+cheap or expensive restaurants.\n\n4) Any gotchas I should look out for?  Like common food where even if it seems to be vegetarian/fish based, there is still chicken/beef/etc stock or other ingredients?\n\nThanks for the help in advance!",

            "comment": "oh man, there are soo many options for you for being a full vegetarian, and even more if you don\u2019t mind dashi in some things! all the convenience stores have minimum sandwich, ramen, buns, baked goods, rice, edamame, and onigiri options. There's a really great tiny okonomiyaki place in Osaka called Okonomiyaki Chitose that has a vegetarian (seitan) option (alongside meat and fish options for your friends). There's also a bunch of veggie friendly ramen places, I suggest looking up a few YouTube videos of some vegan/vegetarian vloggers to find the names, but I found a ton of ramen restaurants (and restaurants in general) for my upcoming trip in May by doing this. I would also suggest looking into a buddhist ryokan for lunch for a traditional buddhist vegetarian lunch one day. Surprisingly, most of the Japanese fast food places have a veggie burger option, and there's a Superiority Burger in Shimokitazawa!\n\nBoth Chabuzen and Afuri have a vegan ramen option, Shin Udon has this mind blowing egg/black pepper/butter hand pulled udon dish, Savoy is supposed to be one of the best Neapolitan style pizza places in the world, and you can find inari ekiben at the train stations :)",

            "comment": "You will be fine! Japan has had quite the surge of veggie food places. If you search for the city you are going to be in (or type of food) + vegan on YouTube you will find some good options. Especially since you can eat fish it will make things a lot easier (since you are fine eating Dashi)\n\nCurry - Coco ichibanya has veggie curry which is great. A lot of meat options for others.\n\nRamen - might be a challenge but a lot of places have a vegetarian option. Ippudo, which is one of the popular chain that has a vegan option. Afuri and Soranorio also have options. There are quite a few fully vegan places as well.\n\nokonomiyaki - you *should* be able to get a vegetarian one pretty easily, especially if it\u2019s one of the ones you make yourself. In Osaka there is a great place called Oko which has options for everyone.\n\n\nIn general, you can probably get things like Udon, Soba and stuff like that which just have dashi.\n\nA lot of burger places will have options too.",

            "comment": "For restaurant chains with options, Coco Curry has a vegetarian option. You can also find a fish/shrimp burger  at mooost fast food chains like McDonalds or Mos Burger. \nI have been to restaurants in a group situation where we order to share and it wasn\u2019t a problem that I wasn\u2019t eating everything. But I don\u2019t know how it might play out if you order individually. I have also sometimes asked that the meat be left out for my dish but that\u2019s easier for western dishes like pasta and salads. \n\nJapan has plentiful seafood! Just try to do your research and look up places. I was able to have a kaiseki experience because I informed beforehand that I was pescatarian",

            "comment": "So I'm vegetarian normally, but in Japan I employ three rules:\n\n1. If I can't see the meat/fish in the meal, it's vegetarian.\n2. Takoyaki, unagi, and shrimp are all fine (first two because I like them, third because it's often the only non-meat option in some cases)\n3. If I order something with meat by mistake, then I'll just eat it.\n\nThings like curry (particularly in curry pan) and sometimes ramen will use a meat base despite not having any actual chunks of meat in them. Even out of Japan I eat sweets with pork gelatine so I'm already a very lax veggie, so this isn't too different from that. Most instant ramen will have some kind of meat flavouring, powders, or toppings (you'll see \u725b\u8089,  \u9d8f\u8089, etc all highlighted on the packet). \n\nMy usual conbini go-to are whatever is available of: hijiki seaweed onigiri (most conbini), spicy mustard greens onigiri (I've only seen these in family mart), egg fried rice onigiri (7-eleven is the only one without meat I think), inari sushi (most conbini). 7-eleven also do an amazing simmered tofu in kelp dashi, which they will heat up for you if there's seating but I usually take home with me to heat. The egg/spinach instant soups are a fave of mine, but they do use chicken stock.\n\nI'm currently based in Kobe! Kobe has an excellent bakery culture, so you can easily pick up some delicious bread products in the area. The streets around Nada (JR station)/Ojikoen (Hankyu station) has some good spots, and the shopping street by the west gates of the Hankyu Kobe-Sannomiya station has a really nice bakery (Tommy's Sannomiya - get their fried egg toast if they have it in stock), a 2 Bros Pizza, and a taiyaki place who sell a vegetable curry taiyaki (not on google maps but it's opposite the CoCo bubble tea place). I also like Tabeyoshi, and Dogen for udon. In chinatown (Nankin-Machi) there's Kobe Croquette who do a cream/corn croquette, and there's also two vegan restaurants in the area - Modernark pharm cafe and Yidaki cafe.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m pescatarian and had a fairly easy time eating in Japan. Udon and soba restaurants are always going to have something you can eat. There is dashi in the normal soup, but as long as you don\u2019t order something with obvious meat in it or something with a nonstandard soup it should be pescatarian safe. My default choice is kitsune udon but I like the one with grated mountain yam too. Tempura restaurants are also always going to have options as long as you aren\u2019t worried about what else they fried in the oil.\n\nAll convenience stores have vegetarian and pescatarian onigiri choices. In Tokyo look for Natural Lawson, they seemed to have a better selection of non onigiri vegetarian stuff. \n\nIn Tokyo, Kyushu Jangara Ramen is a normal pork based ramen shop that has vegan ramen that is really good. You can order toppings a la carte so I got it with a hard boiled egg. It\u2019s a small chain, I went to the one in Harajuku. The harajuku branch also has a whole vegan restaurant upstairs but I didn\u2019t try it. Soranoiro in Tokyo station also has a good veggie option.\n\nIn Kyoto, Engine Ramen is super touristy but I liked the ramen anyway, and they do meat and vegan versions",

Here are my must do\u2019s: \n\nTokyo - \nBombay Sapphire was the best Indian food I have ever eaten in my life. Make a booking though. They offer meat and veg. \n\nZen okonomiyaki offers vegetarian and meat options. \n\nTs TanTan ramen - vegetarian only but it\u2019s good. It\u2019s in the station. \n\nKyushu Jangara Ramen - vegan ramen and meat options \n\nCurry House CoCo Ichibanya\n\nTsunahachi\n\nKyoto- \nQue Pasa Mexican was AMAZING and they have the coolest T-shirt\u2019s and hats. They offer meat and vegetarian options. My husband loved this place the most. \n\nChou Chou gyoza. We waited 3 hours in line and I honestly don\u2019t think it was that great tbh.",

    "postText": "Hello! I just returned from a 10 day trip to Japan in which we (my wife and I, both 33) visited Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka with day trips to Nara and Hiroshima. We are well-versed in International travel but we had a lot of anxiety for this trip. This subreddit was incredibly useful! I just wanted to throw out a few things I wish I knew or had been reassured-of before arriving rather than doing a \"trip review\" I see on here a lot.\n\n* **You do *NOT* need a tour guide to visit Japan!**\nMy initial reaction to planning this trip was we should consider booking a guided tour because of the language and culture barriers. I am sure there are some benefits to being in a tour group but for us not having to be beholden to a schedule was much preferred and honestly, a guide was just simply not necessary because...\n* **Not knowing Japanese is really not a problem.** \nAlmost every important sign is in English. I can't think of a time we couldn't figure out how to do something (except order at some restaurants, more on that later)\n* **Absolutely get a pocket wifi.**\nWe used Japan-wireless. Not a plug but it worked great for us. We picked it up at the airport and dropped it into a mailbox before we left. We've never had an international trip where we were so connected and worry free about data\n* **Use Google Maps to get to all your destinations.**\nIt's almost embarrassing how much we relied on Google Maps. One of the biggest benefits is it tells you which platform to be on for most subways. This makes it so we don't have to stare at the line maps to figure out which direction we need to go. There were even times we doubted Google Maps and diverted, only to realize Google Maps was correct\n* **Do some quick research on how to get to your hotel from the airport.**\nSince you won't be totally confident in your knowledge of public transportation the moment your jet-lagged self steps off the plane, have confidence in how to get to your hotel. In our case, our hotel was right next to Shinagawa Station and we flew into Haneda. So I knew I needed to take the Keikyu express train to Shinagawa after buying and loading a Pasmo (or any IC card). Knowing this rather than fumbling through if I needed to take the Keikyu or the monorail and the difference between the two right when we landed was a huge help.\n* **Get an IC card.**\nThis is obvious as everyone recommends it. We used it a ton. I probably spent close to $100 in various things on it and it makes the various subway companies so much easier\n* **Get a JR Pass, if it makes sense.**\nSomewhere online there's a website where you can enter your various destinations and it will tell you if the rail pass makes sense. It did for us, but just barely. But now I know that even if that site said it wasn't worth it, but by a small amount, I still would have gotten it. We used the JR lines quite a bit outside of the bullet trains.\n* **If you get a JR Pass, reserve a seat when you can.**\nThis limits your flexibility but we came back from Hiroshima right after a baseball game ended. We ended up having to stand the entire 90-minute ride back to Osaka after a full day of exploring. This wasn't pleasant.\n* **You need a hookup for high-end restaurants, or extra cash.**\nMost of the nice restaurants do not have an online reservation system like OpenTable. They require someone who speaks Japanese to call during a narrow window of time. Usually only 4+ star hotels have concierges that can do this for you, and some of them require you to already be checked-in before they'll do it for you. There are a number of companies that will do this for you for a fee, often a big fee (like $40+ per person).\n* **Don't stress over where to eat before you arrive.**\nWe booked a nice sushi dinner through our hotel's concierge ahead of time. So I worried about all our other meals. Normally I would mark down restaurants that looked interesting using TripAdvisor or yelp or something ahead of time. There are so many places in Japan these services just don't work well. When you're hungry, just think about what *kind* of food you want and there will probably be a great place somewhere nearby you can wander into\n* **~~Day drinking is kind of not a thing in Japan.~~** **Getting alcohol drinks during the day without food is kind of not a thing**\nWhen we travel, my wife and I are used to popping into bars or breweries in the middle of the afternoon to rest our tired feet and break up the day. While Japan has very relaxed drinking laws, most true bars don't open until the evenings and restaurants that serve alcohol expect you to order food along with your drink\n* **If you love craft beer or cocktails, reconsider your drinking plans.**\nCraft beer and cocktails are insanely expensive. Like, I'm talking 1400 yen (~$14) for a pint of craft beer. Expect to pay at least that for a high-end cocktail.\n* **Highballs seem to be the \"locals drink of choice\" or at least a popular drink to order.**\nThis is an inexpensive (~500ish yen) cocktail of cheap whiskey and soda water. Everywhere you go knows how to make them and they drink easy. So it's good to know if you're somewhere without an English menu.\n* **Use the Line chat group organized in the monthly meetups from this sub.**\nWe never ended up meeting up with anyone but it was awesome to get travel ideas and ask questions along the way.\n* **Step outside of your comfort zone!**\nI put this at the end because I think it's the most important. Before we arrived, I was very concerned about walking in to a bar or restaurant and embarrassing myself or offending the people inside. This was never the case for us. Our absolute best experiences came from us nervously walking into a bar that seemed like we wouldn't be welcomed. \nSpecifically, I'll give a shoutout to a place called Bar Dram in Kyoto. It's on a second floor and the whole place is basically the size of a bedroom. We had a record scratch moment when we walked in and everyone looked at us like \"who the hell are these people\" but that was mostly because none of them spoke good English and were embarrassed by that. (Side note: we discovered that since basically everyone takes English in school, locals are embarrassed when they can't speak it anymore. Like, \"I don't want them to know I took a ton of English lessons and I didn't retain much of it\") But by the end of the night, we made friends with everyone. One of the patrons started crying because \"it was the best time she's ever had in that bar\" and the owner gave us a gift (some barware I had asked a question about). I'm not bragging about our social skills, in fact they are usually poor. All we did was ask questions and be patient when they tried to respond. \nWe had at least two other occasions similar to this where we opened the door to a bar and instantly felt like we shouldn't be there and eventually had an amazing time. For instance, we walked into what we learned later is a very respected yakitori restaurant in Osaka. There was no English menu and the owners spoke no English. While considering our options, a young couple seated next to us asked in English if she could help us order. We told her to please order us their favorites (with no animal internal organs) and by the end of the night we were friends with them and the owners and it was one of the best meals of the trip. So if there's one thing from this to take away, do something that makes you uncomfortable on your trip; it may lead to the highlight of your vacation. And go to Bar Dram in Kyoto.\n\nedit: formatting",

Unfortunately, the same can't be said of most Japanese-made craft beer. Usually it tops out at decent. Once in a while you find something properly good. If you're coming from somewhere in North America or Europe with a good craft beer scene, it's likely you'll be disappointed.\n\nIncidentally, Japanese wine isn't so great either, but there's lots of imported wine available, some of which isn't so expensive.\n\nOf course, Japan excels at sake, shochu and whisky. So definitely try those out if those are your thing.",

They asked us up front if we were just there to drink or if we wanted food and put no pressure on us to order the food. And there were plenty of other places willing to let you wet your lips during the day without a meal too.",

You saved, flew all that way, don't try to skimp on this, because having internet access at all times to find cool things, read reviews, get directions and information is incredibly valuable. Yes, there are offline maps, but they are very imprecise without wifi. For example, since I was in Tokyo for a month, figured I would check out JBS in Shibuya, a bar featuring a ridiculous vinyl collection. I sort of knew the general area, but couldn't find it. Because I had internet, I could google search an image of establishment's sign, found it, and finally saw it higher up on a totem pole of different company logos in a very non descript building. I never would have found it without data. \n\nedit: oh, I got around fine knowing just 5 or 6 words and terms. Sumimasen is by far the most important. It's a must. ",

For example, you'd never say Sayonara to the clerk at a 7 Eleven. When you buy your stuff you would say \"Arigatou\" as you finish paying and it's the same as you leave a restaurant. If you want to make the restaurant owner smile you could give them an awkward \"Oishi\" (delicious) on the way out but again, you wouldn't bother saying goodbye. \n\nRegardless, Japanese are very tolerant of and patient with foreigners and are willing to look the other way on most faux pas they come across and in my personal experience, when they do raise the issue they're understanding of your ignorance and help point you in the right direction ",

It's very helpful in previewing the train timetable and intervals. I used this exclusively when planning transport before my trip. And maybe 60/40 between hyperdia/google during our trip. (Google maps is very useful for identifying nearby stations.) It's a little more powerful in the sense it has more toggles and preview what future trains you can catch. \n\nIt has some nice settings where you can minimize # of transfers, or utilize JR pass (avoid nozomi/mizuho/etc shinkansens), sort by various criteria, give you pricing (especially useful if you have a JR pass but still need to pay a surcharge for special limited express trains).\n\nI highly recommend downloading it. It has a \"30 day\" trial, but you can delete it and reinstall it and it will reset. Also it's for iOS, haven't checked if it's available on Android. Not sure if the desktop site is usable on the mobile browser.",

I believe the physical card you transfer will no longer be functional, and the full balance of the card (including the 500yen deposit) is transferred to your phone.\n\nYou can then re-load the virtual Suica card from a credit card in your Apple Wallet so you no longer need to reload it with cash at machines.\n\nOn your phone it uses a lower level of security than other NFC, so you do not have to unlock your phone to pay with Suica via tapping like you do with Apple Pay. It will also work even if your phone is out of battery and turned off, though possibly only for several hours.",

Some subways aren't part of the JR network, so don't be like me and choose accomodation just because they are close to a station.\n\nEnded up paying more than I expected  because I had to use the subway lines more than I wish to.\n\nPlanning your itinerary organically will also save you a lot of pain.",

They serve it with soda water and add in your flavour of choice (you should get yuzu because it's unique to Japan/Asia). Bonus if you're avoiding or sensitive to lots of artificial sugar.\n\nContrary to Japan's conservative culture, I was very surprised about how nobody looked twice when my wife and I would walk around enjoying a cold one in the middle of the day (sometimes 10-11AM). However, if you did the same thing with food or laughing really obnoxiously, you would get glared at.",

Everywhere you go knows how to make them and they drink easy. So it's good to know if you're somewhere without an English menu.\n\nWait, what exactly do you order then? Do you ask for a hai-ba-ru? Is there a name for this drink and I just missed it?",

Was on the train and my wife and I gave up our seats for an older gentleman. He was very nice, and gave us a very warm smile. It seems this is not very common when we were riding the train as we did this more than once, and the older folks were very kind and warm.\n\nThe odd part of the trip were the amount of people I got blatantly staring at me. More than once some \"office ladies\" would stare and even talk about me, all while holding eye contact. Other times in the malls people would literally walk by and hold eye contact. I always thought this was the opposite of what happens in Japan... I look asian so found it quite odd, but not off putting. Maybe someone could shed some light on what's happening -__-\n\n",

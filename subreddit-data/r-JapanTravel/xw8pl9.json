We want to know some things you wish you\u2019d known before your first trip to Japan. What would you like to go back and tell yourself? What additional things would you pack? What would you add to or leave off your itinerary? What\u2019s some advice you can give to first-time travelers?\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

It\u2019s very easy to end up with a ton of useless \u00a51 and \u00a55 coins, but if you\u2019re consistently paying with exact change, you can keep the number down to only a few. I still have a bag full of \u00a51 coins in a closet somewhere from my first couple of trips, when I was stupid about this.",

My wife and I spent 9 days in Tokyo and we spent about $1500 USD (~ $140 a day) in Dec 2019. This is everything except hotels and flights.

That seems a bit like a COVID change, since before COVID, we were getting like 95% of goshuin written in our books, and we'd only occasionally run into a place that handed us one on a separate sheet.

I think it's important that people should plan if they feel like they need to, but should keep in mind that the plan doesn't need to be followed religiously. The way I went about it is I put the things I REALLY wanted to do at the beginning of the day, and if things took too long or I went exploring, the things at the end of the day got pumped off. This meant I had a plan to follow and was able to explore, but if I had downtime and was lost, I could jump back to the plan.",

Throw them in shrine/temple offertory boxes.\n* Speaking of money...do NOT hand your cash directly to the cashier. Unless there is one of those new-fangled automatic machines, there will always be a tray for putting the money onto, which the cashier will then take and put any change onto to hand back to you. If you hand cash to them directly, they will be confused (but take it, anyway, then use the tray to give you your change lol).\n* Similarly, in some places, if you want to pay by credit card, you place the card in the same tray unless otherwise directed to put the card directly into the machine.\n* Consider collecting goshuincho (temple/shrine stamp books). They're beautiful, compact, and are a way to financially support temples and shrines in Japan. They also make visiting temples and shrines more fun!\n* If you decide to go clothes shopping and want to try something on, know that you are supposed to remove your shoes before going into the changing rooms.\n* When at a sit-down restaurant, servers will NOT come to your table unless you flag them down (or if there's a button on your table, just press it to call for one). This will be strange for those of us from countries where servers are expected to pop by your table every so often to check on you.\n* Last but not least....SLOW DOWN. Seriously. Absolutely go and plan to see some of the big sights and events, but honestly, Japan is such a great country to just wander around and explore. Take some time to just walk around and find the amazing hole-in-the-wall places. Some of my best experiences and memories in Japan are by doing this.",

So having to call people over was second nature.\n\nOn my first trip I ended up at a theme cafe popular with tourists, and one person there was eating alone and for a very long time looked like he wanted help but didn\u2019t know he needed to call a staff member (or was very shy). My girlfriend noticed and got a staff member for him. He nodded his head at us to acknowledge the help.\n\nAlso, sometimes the buttons are actually two buttons, and one is to call staff and the second might get you the check. In those cases there\u2019s usually a butting \u201c\u547c\u201d that calls the staff and then a second one labeled something like \u201c\u9818\u53ce\u201d (receipt).",

I eventually caught on by watching the locals, but yeah, I like to mention this to people if they've never been to Japan before. There is no need to starve at your table like I did, haha!",

            "comment": "In major cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, etc. (basically all the places first-timers often travel), there is food _everywhere_. I mean it. Tokyo has 160k restaurants. That\u2019s insane. Especially when you consider the NYC has 25k restaurants. There are 1.5 million restaurants in all of Japan, roughly the same number as there are in the US, which is multiple times larger. If you\u2019re in a city, you can\u2019t throw a rock without hitting a restaurant\u2014or a whole floor/building of restaurants. And that\u2019s not even counting food available in convenience stores, in the bottom floors of department buildings, or in tiny takeaway stalls.\n\nBecause of this, you really don\u2019t need to plan out your meals. Sure, if you\u2019re heard of a famous place you want to try, that\u2019s fine. Go for it. But you don\u2019t need every meal to be meticulously thought out, and you don\u2019t need to go out of your way for food. If you want ramen or tonkatsu or curry, don\u2019t look up some list online and travel across Tokyo for whatever it recommends. Just go on [Tabelog](https://s.tabelog.com/en/) (or the site of your choice) and search your immediate area. Or heck, just walk around for a couple of minutes near a train station or populated area, and you\u2019ll probably find something interesting.\n\nNote that this _doesn\u2019t_ apply to small towns out in the country. They often have very limited food options (and even limited grocery/convenience store options), but there\u2019s still usually _something_ to be found, and often you stay at ryokan there that provides you with most meals, anyhow.",

It made menus easier, and I was able to have some basic interactions with people. I impressed my tour guides because I knew how to say animal names and colors in Japanese and can say nonsense sentences like \u201cmy pretty cat is green\u201d or \u201cwhere are your chopsticks?\u201d When someone spoke to me, I could sometimes pick out a word and figure out what they were saying.

I can converse basic japanese if I put in a lot of effort but it seems that the lack of practice means it's much easier to process the language in one direction than the other.\n\nAt N4, you should have a decent amount of reading ability. With enough practice, you're going to be good to get by travelling alone in the inaka. I've pretty much studied till around N4 level, then did more of just expose myself more to the media (e.g. making japanese games friends and reading their tweets, playing ff14 with japanese party finders, reading manga in japanese).

For example, at Tokyo Station before the pandemic, the station stamp was located under the big rotunda on the west end of the building at ground level. So, ask any of the uniformed staff \u201cEki sutanpu wa doko desu ka?\u201d(\u201cWhere is the station stamp?\u201d). I have found that staff are usually very excited to point me in the direction of the stamps.\n\nUnmanned stations, rarely, if ever have station stamps. Oddly enough, the only manned station I have encountered without a station stamp is Hida Takayama. Like, I have been to some rather off the beaten path train stations, either as destinations or as connecting stations, and still collected their stamps.\n\nIf you are not at a train station and you want to ask about stamps, you are looking for a commemorative stamp. \u201cKinen sutanpu wa doko desu ka?\u201d (\u201cWhere is the commemorative stamp\u201c).",

Trying to translate a giant block of text will probably lead to a lot of sadness. Japanese is a very contextual language, and while the various translators have gotten better over the years, they are still quite bad with some languages like the East Asian ones.\n\nSimilarly, if you\u2019re trying to use it to translate from English to Japanese, like if you want to show your phone to someone if you want to convey something, keep it simple. Don\u2019t use idioms or very extensive, complex sentences. You\u2019ll have better luck writing your English like if you were a child who spoke one sentence at a time with no conjunctions.\n\nAnd note that google translate would probably be inaccurate even for some simple stuff, like for example if you were trying to ask a souvenir shop owner \u201cwhat is your local specialty?\u201d it becomes:\n\n\u201c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u5730\u5143\u306e\u5c02\u9580\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b?\u201d - which is\u2026not exactly correct (it uses a word for \u201cspecialty\u201d that is almost exclusively used for stuff like college majors/professions).\n\nBut yet if you make the question \u201cwhat is the local specialty?\u201d you get:\n\n\u201c \u5730\u5143\u306e\u7279\u7523\u54c1\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u201d - which uses a word that means \u201clocal specialty\u201d (\u7279\u7523\u54c1 _tokusanhin_) - and the difference was not using a possessive pronoun in your sentence.\n\nUltimately the other person will probably understand either, though will probably be confused first, because English has single words that maps to multiple meanings whereas Japanese can typically have separate words for those things, and that makes the translation between the two quite difficult in software.",

But sometimes you want to double check on hyperdia, it may provide a better route if you're travelling longer distance.\n\n2. Google maps on buses tend to be good for me, and you can use it and the departure time feature to figure out when the last bus is if you're going to a more remote location.\n\n3. Use suica for as many things as possible. Conbini, vending machines, train rides, bus rides (not all buses). You dont want to be lugging a lot of coins around and you will get a tonne if you dont use it.\n\n4. If you go to a decent sized city outside of the big 3 (tokyo kyoto osaka), sometimes there are tourism association nearby the main train station. You can get more detailed information and advise on travelling to further location by public transport. I went to the one near Mito to get information on public transport to fukuroda falls and they had a lot of materials that is helpful.\n\n5. Learn how to read katakana. Hiragana is good too but katakana is very more important in my opinion. Katakana is used for borrowed words from other languages, and being able to read them you can guess a lot of words by their phonetic by comparing them to english. You can piece out words and take a rough guess on the meaning of the signs.\n\n6. If you are planning to move from place to place, consider using kuroneko yamato (also known as TAQ-Q-BIN) to send your luggage. Sometimes you want to visit a few places but dont really need to have your luggage with you? Just pack a small carry on bag with your clothes and ship your luggage to a destination further down the trip, they can hold on to your luggages for a couple of days (I think max is a week?). They can typically send your luggage within the day if you need to. It is handy for trips that are further away, requiring several train transfers or bus rides. You dont really want to be lugging a large luggage around, so you can plan a side trip to less accessible places between 2 big cities without worrying about luggages.",

If you're unfamiliar with the station then it may be hard to find an elevator. I remember my gf feeling embarrassed that we were getting bad looks in Japan, a place known for people being polite at least superficially. I had to make several trips carrying large luggage one by one ss the station was very crowded, I didn't want to go around looking for the elevator, and just took the direct path in front of me.\n\nThe \"airport limousines\" (buses) in contrast take you directly to the door step of a few hotels. Even if you don't stay at one of the hotels that have a stop on the bus routes, I'd take a bus to the nearest hotel and then get a taxi for the rest of the way.\n\nAgain, this mostly applies if you have big luggage, although I would do it even without as I find the overall experience requires less effort.\n\nCan't remember the price comparison off the top of my head but I'll check and add it later on",

Undoubtedly the greatest thing ever made. Also download an offline google maps of the area youre staying in on the app",

Sometimes there isn\u2019t even soap. Also bring a plastic bag with you when you\u2019re out and about because you might have trash to throw away and there won\u2019t be any trash bins nearby. Stand to the left on the escalators at most big stations so people can move by you if they need to and honestly just be direct with where you\u2019re going in busy stations. Make sure to take breaks especially if you aren\u2019t used to walking a lot.",

Sure, you can walk around with wet hands and air dry them, or wipe them on your pants or shirt, but this is Japan! Have some class! You don't want to be that damp looking gaijin, do you? Buy a tenugui. They fold up pretty compact, have multi use because of size and can be a cool souvenir with all the different designs!",

Shin-Osaka is a little out of the way compared to Umeda, even moreso Shin-Kobe compared to arriving at Sannomiya (unless you\u2019re going to the Herb Garden or waterfall). And not all Shinkansen trains stop at Himeji. \n\nHeck, I even once waited longer for a Shinkansen in Okayama to take me to Himeji then it would have just taking the local train.",

    "postText": "This is my second trip to Japan and I found a really good deal on a flight and decided to spontaneously travel, before committing to a new job. \n\nAnyway, my itinerary was planned to have 6 days, but I realized that my arrival would be a day later due to timezone differences, so I had to tweak things.\n\nDay 1: Arrive at 2 PM \n\n-Toho Cinema Godzilla Kabukicho for a quick photo =&gt; Explore Kabuchiko tower =&gt; Meiji Jingu =&gt; Yoyogi Park =&gt; Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden =&gt; See Waseda University and buy a shirt (COVID canceled my exchange program) =&gt; Maybe Go to Akihabara and browse around anime shops at night. \n\n\nDay 2: Day trip to Mt Takao Side \nChairlift =&gt; Yakuoin temple =&gt;  Summit\n=&gt; Miyama Brdige route going down \ncable car down. \nIf I have some spare time:\n=&gt; Nintendo Tokyo (Shibuya) =&gt; Pok\u00e9mon Center Tokyo DX (Near Tokyo station) \n**Forecasted for scattered showers**\n\n\nDay 3: Disneyland\n**On a weekend &amp; forecasted for showers**\n\n\nDay 4: Day trip \nKamakura/Enoshima Day trip (will be getting day pass)\n\nMeigetsuin =&gt; Hasedera Temple =&gt; Kotokuin (Great Buddha)\n=&gt; Hokokuji Temple =&gt; Tsurugaoka Hachimangu\n=&gt; Enoshima Shrine =&gt; Samuel Cocking Garden =&gt; Iwaya Cave\n\n**forecasted for showers**\n\nI might scrap the Enoshima part if the weather gets bad. \n\n\nDay 5:  Disney Sea During the Day =&gt; 7 PM night flight home. \n\n**Potential PM Thunderstorm** \n\n\nQuestions: \n\n- My friends traveled during Cherry blossom season and told me the line for customs was awful, has anyone traveled recently? \n\n- The weather looks awful during most of the days during my trip, which I didn't expect, I've never been to the Disney Amusement parks, will there be a lot of shade? Should I drop my Day trips? \n\n- Also I recently transferred my SUICA card to my iPhone's Wallet app, I was wondering if the Physical card could still be reloaded and used? \n\n- Also as I did plan this spontaneously if you have any general travel/immigration advice/ Don't forgets, feel free to remind me!\n\nThank you!",

Crowds won\u2019t be bad at all in May since it\u2019s after golden week, and the rain definitely tends to keep people away!\n\nYes most rides will be fine running in the rain!! There are definitely a couple that wouldn\u2019t be (journey to the center of the earth is the main one), but overall you shouldn\u2019t have a problem! Parades and night shows will be cancelled if it\u2019s heavier rain though, so that\u2019s a bit sad.",

Night parade is at 7:00 I think at Disneyland. Disney sea has a night show at 7:20. Fireworks are at 8:30 I think\u2026 check the app!",

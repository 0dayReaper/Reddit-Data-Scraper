Was a bit surprised how.. quiet it was?  Subways, trains, lots and lots of times I teased about how all of Japan seemed like a 'shh library' kinda place.  I'm used to friendly, and overly nice midwestern people, so it really seemed a bit.. cold to me.  I speak a bit, ok maybe more than a bit, of Japanese.. but I was only ever really spoken to, 1 time.  A nice old lady selling home made jewerly in Kyoto.  We talked a bit, and it was fun, very sweet lady.  I won't forget her.    \n\n\nOverview of each city..   \n\n\n**Tokyo**, busy, fun, easy to ride and get around using rail pass.    \nLots of things to do, our 7 total days in Tokyo were never boring, or lacking things to do.    \nHarajuku, and Akihabara were our stand out favorite places to just walk around and shop/explore.    \n\n\n**Hakone**, get the Hakone Free Pass, it's worth it.  Our Ryokan was fun, experienced tatami rooms, and futons.  I'm glad it was just 2 nights though. :)  haha  I'm taller, and already have a wimpy back.. so ya.. I like a nice bed more.  Our inn had nice springs, full on breakfast/dinner layouts.. way worth it.    \nA sweet little place, didn't feel nearly as busy/touristy.    \nCable car and the ropeway car to Mt Hakone 10/10.  Definitely worth it.    \n..and we were lucky enough to see Mt Fuji from the ropeway car.    \n\n\n**Osaka**, loved it.  Could've spent more time here.  Soo many fun shopping district areas, so much nice food.  ..and the first place I found TAIYAKI.  Yes oh please.. I loved it.  The custard, or the red bean.  I'll miss those lil fishies.  Osaka Castle was nice, the plum gardens were fun.    \n\n\n**Kyoto**, was my favorite place of the trip.  You could really see the historic difference here.  Buildings, shrines, rivers, the layout.. it all just felt like.. This is the Japan sights I expected and hoped for.  Lanterns, rivers, sakura everywhere.. some places were a bit touristy.. but we just went on some mountain walks when we got people'd out.. was lovely.    \n\n\nI really had a nice time.  Maybe not in Sakura season, but maybe fall.. we'll probably go again in a while..   \nAlso, I used a lot of resources here for food, and recommended spots.. so I want to say thanks.  You guys and this community really made things an extra notch of awesome.    \n\n\nAppreciate yas. :)",

If budget is a concern we didn't exactly use the cheapest rooms for most of our trip and honestly I was perfectly fine with cheap rooms as long as we had our own bathroom. We spent more than $1000 on 2 nights total at Hakone and Shirakowago for example where one could save some more money (both were great experiences and excellent escapes from busy cities).",

Last time when I visited Kyoto, i dropped my wallet on a bus and miraculously found it after 5 days (everything was still inside, I had Yen cash ~ around $500usd and visa cards, ID..). When I found out I dropped it, I went to a police station to report it and left my phone number with them. 5 days later just the day before I left Kyoto, they called and told me to go to another police station in the city to pick it up. It turned out someone found it and brought it to the police near their house. The thing which impressed me the most is that those lost and found things seem very normal in Japan. That is why I had hope to find my wallet back and went to the police to report it.",

There\u2019s lots to do there and you could probably spend two days, but I\u2019d recommend just one so you can spend more time in more interesting places like Tokyo (massive!) or Kyoto (attractions are very spread out).\n\nRegarding the floor, it\u2019s definitely more comfortable than you\u2019d expect! The tatami mat floors are awesome, kinda springy? If you\u2019ve ever done gymnastics or martial sports (boxing, wrestling, etc) it\u2019s a lot like that but softer. And the futons are also comfy\n\nEdit: the majority of the cost for the ryokans are for the full course meals and the (semi-private) onsen baths. It will probably the most expensive lodging unless you book 5 star hotels, but it does come with a lot of perks! Fun to experience for a day but probably not worth for longer",

Everywhere else, I'm hoping to spend around \u00a350-60",

I had been willing to struggle through communicating via my own wobbly command of Japanese , but I think the prospect for embarrassment on her side was just too mortifying for her. \n\nThe big exception to this reluctance is that when you visit m big tourist sites, you could have a chance to chat  with Japanese school groups. You may be approached by a teacher-supervisor who will ask you if you\u2019d be willing to let the kids practice their English on you.

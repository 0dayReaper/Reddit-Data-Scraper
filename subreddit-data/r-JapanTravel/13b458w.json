    "postText": "Hello everyone, we are a couple from Spain, it's our first time in Japan and we're going to stay in Kyoto 2 weeks, but since our plane lands at Haneda airport we'll stay one night in Tokyo\n\nWe'll go to a lot of temples in Kyoto so we want to experience the Tokyo megalopolis, neon, skyscrapers, street food, etc. let's say we want the \"cyberpunk\" vibes of Tokyo before Kyoto's traditional vibes\n\nWe'll land at Haneda Airport at 11am the next wednesday, go to our hotel near Shinjuku station, drop the bags, take a shower and get back to the streets, my plan so far is to start the day from the farthest point and gradually return to Shinjuku \n\nProbably take something fast to eat/breakfast\nGo to Yodabashi Camera to buy some things we'll need\nGo to akihabara before lunch (I don't know if it's worth it since there's a lot of things to do and we are not so otakus) \nEat some street food or ramen (suggestions appreciated) \nExplore the city near Tokyo Tower\nGo to Shibuya at sunset and explore the area, we've booked at Shibuya Sky after sunset (8pm) because we want to see the city night skyline\nGo to korea town since it looks cool and with nice street food or ramen (depending on what we had for lunch) \nReturn to Shinjuku at night to see the Golden Gai area\nBack to the hotel, sleep. \nBreakfast somewhere before heading to the shinkansen station at 11.50am\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAre we missing something you think we shouldn't postpone to our next trip?",

Going to Tokyo Tower is possible, but I would recommend staying around Shinjuku and Shibuya.",

That is already a lot assuming you will eat lunch and dinner in a restaurant (which takes estimated 1 hour each).",

I think it\u2019s good that you left some days more empty so there can be a bit of impulsiveness to your adventure. \n\nFor Day 5 - I went to the Naked Flowers at Nijo Castle back in April. It was quite cold at night and I\u2019d imagine it would be the same in November so layer up! The event itself was beautifully done but we found that you didn\u2019t need to allocate too much time - one hour was pretty much sufficient. Food, tea and alcohol stalls at the very end if you need a little snack. They let you do a bit of sake tasting and I ended up with a nice bottle.\n\nFor Day 6 - it\u2019s my understanding that Kurama Onsen has been closed for some time now!",

Honestly just hearing someone say the schedule is okay is helpful haha  \n\n\nOh awesome, would you say Naked Flowers was worth it then? Not sure if they do different time entries but if so, when do you think would be best?\n\nGood to know about the onsen! Is there a hot springs or onsen near the areas we've shared that you'd recommend?\n\nThank you!",

If you were already in the area or really want to see Nijo castle then its perfect for you. I think we went around 7pm and it was dark enough for the lights to really make an impact :) \n\nIn terms of hot springs/onsen, I have a couple of tattoos so to avoid drama we ended up booking a ryokan with a public bath that allows you to use the bath privately too. I have also heard really good things about Sagano Onsen Tenzan-no-Yu (which is unfortunately not tattoo friendly) so feel free to check that one out!",

Like 15 minutes. Might be easier to just base yourself in either Kyoto or Osaka and do the other city as day trips to avoid changing hotels but it comes down to your travel style.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to adding another day in the Kansai region, I highly recommend visiting Hiroshima. We did it as a day trip from Kyoto and the peace memorial museum and park was one of the highlights of our trip.",

I feel like due to wanting to go to the Gate Hike early it would be best for us to stay near that area... but then I know we'll probably stay out late in Osaka so maybe it would be best to stay there.\n\nDo you have any pointers?\n\nThank you for the info about the Kansai region! We'll look into it.",

If you\u2019re staying out late in Osaka it would be better to stay there as the trains between Kyoto and Osaka end service quite early",

It\u2019s a Korean community in Osaka and it has tons of great yakiniku restaurants. When the doors of the train open in that station you\u2019re immediately hit with the smell of barbecue. \n\nIn your quest for \u201cJapanese pancakes,\u201d I\u2019d recommend trying Fugetsu. It\u2019s my favorite okonomiyaki chain restaurant. I usually get the \u201cFugetsu modan yaki.\u201d Modan yaki is okonomiyaki with noodles added to it. You can find Fugetsu in various parts of the city. There\u2019s even one in Dotonbori directly across from Kani Doraku (the giant crab).",

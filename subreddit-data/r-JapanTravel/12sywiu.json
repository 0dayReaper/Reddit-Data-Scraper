The moment I had caught a glimpse of what he had in his hands, I ran to the hotel and prayed that the automatic door would open fast enough. \nHe didn't dare to enter the lobby, but he was walking around and was giving me the hush sign. \n\nI was discussing the best I could with the entrance lady who was assuring me I should have stayed inside. But frankly, I am astonished someone would pick on strangers simply because they are discussing on the street below. \n\nHe didn't make any noise approaching me and I am pretty relieved I did notice him. But all in the end, should I warn the police that someone might run at people with a bat at this neighborhood ?\n\nIt's Tabist Hiromas Hotel Kotobuki By the way.",

I get that Japan has different cultural norms and *maybe* OP was being somewhat of a public nuisance, but the amount of victim blaming here is kinda insane. If OP had gotten severely hurt or killed, would you still be defending the assailant?",

Especially when they\u2019re doing something like disturbing a lot of different people. The real lesson is that tourists need to be very cognizant in Japan about how they act, because failure to do so results in stuff like this.\n\nOP may not have realized this, but he was probably loud enough so that possibly dozens of people could hear him in the middle of the night. We tend not to think of this act of talking on a cellphone is severe because in the west, especially America, we have a very liberal attitude towards how people behave, and so our solution to loud people is to make our houses more soundproof and put on earphones or whatever. In Japan their solution to loud noises is to expect everyone to comply to strict adherence to social guidelines.\n\nIt may not seem like it, but what OP did would kind of be like if you were in America and you were running around an apartment complex with a megaphone in hand, blaring noise. Would you expect such a strong reaction in that case? Yes, yes you would.",

I can call the police, I can talk to them, I can rally up some other people to talk to them, etc etc. Threatening someone is extreme and I think there are a lot of options to go through until you say 'now violence is the only thing I have left'. \n\nThat said, I think this is all that I had left to say, so cheers and have a nice evening.",

Well I still don't know if I should warn the police about it but I'm rather leaning on the side of denouncing that guy. \nTo be honest, that is the first time I'm travelling alone. On top of that, I was living in the countryside and it's also my first time living in the city for a long period of time.\n\nBut I really didn't expect the walls to be that bad. And I am ready to admit that I might have been too loud since I had earplugs on me and wouldn't be noticing my own speaking tone in that case. Though that's really weird since I was right at the entrance of my hostel and none of the other residents got woken up in the night. As I think myself too, it's true that westerners are usually considered loud on the other hand. And that's why they usually don't wake up through noisy nights. \n\nI think in France, whenever you are living next to an hotel and even acknowledging the barrier language, you would simply hurls insults at the noisy person. Furthermore, could have the police to get your buttocks. That's it. \n\nThe underwear guy running with a bat is a thing that could happen in the country where my parents came from. But it's literally Southeast Asia and I'm just shocked that someone could behave like it's the dampest place of the world.\n\nI am gonna utter this thing quite clear that I experience quite some specks of racism from Japanese culture. I have been refused at a hairdressing salon before entering or some people were fleeing when I was about to ask for some directions. But I would remind you that there were wonderful people too and I'm glad that open-minded people in Japan exist across all ages. \n\nFor example, I went into a fabulous teishoku restaurant where the old lady was in the middle of cooking for other clients but was still trying to attend to my needs. I genuinely thought she was formidable. It's in shinjuku by the way and you can ask me if you want.\n\nSuch thing was to be expected in a country with 120million people. There are good and rotten apples just like everywhere else. But I would like simply some people to reconsider what would it be like to have a relative, travelling alone at the other side of the world, being threatened with a weapon as dangerous as a knife during the night. I don't think that's an appropriate answer in any country. As such, It's something I would never tell my family or they would have a collective heart attack.\n\nThat's why I'm glad to have sorted it out in my head and got it out of my chest for a moment. I would also give my thanks to the people who actually  think it was a rude behavior and took a bit of my side. Since I would treat my equal as I would treat myself.",

The bat is almost certainly there for 2 purposes; defending himself from a possible confrontation that he was about to initiate, and to intimidate. He likely had no intention of actually hitting OP with the bat unless a fight started.\n- Foreign tourists routinely are rowdy and cause annoyances for locals, so there is some baked-in prejudice that exists there.",

I am reminding you that this is not condoning this behavior, I am simply explaining it.\n\nAnd again no, chasing him with the bat worked really well; it produced the exact result that this guy wanted.

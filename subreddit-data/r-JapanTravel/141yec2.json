    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nWill be travelling to Japan for the first time, 3 weeks (Aug 22 - Sep 12). I've done plenty of research and spent lots of time creating this, so I would really appreciate feedback on how feasible this itinerary is. I understand that it is a lot, so please let me know if I can do everything or if I should cut some cities out and stay longer in one place.\n\nI will keep the day-to-day activities brief, as I'm looking for how feasible the dates in each city are with travel times. \n\n**Tues August 22 - Thurs August 24: TOKYO**\n\n\\-Will be arriving on Tues evening via Narita Airport, any suggestions on what to do as soon as we arrive?  \n\\-Planned typical landmark attractions, including a day trip to Yokohama\n\n**Fri August 25 - Wed August 30: OSAKA/KYOTO/KOBE/NARA**\n\nFrom Tokyo - Kyoto: 3 hours via JR Train  \n**-**Staying in Osaka as a base, with last night (Wed) in Kobe  \n\\-Dotonbori, day trip to Nara, watching Hanshin tigers at oldest baseball stadium in Japan\n\n**Thurs August 31 - Sat September 2: IYA VALLEY (Oboke)**\n\nFrom Kobe - Oboke: 3 hours via JR Train  \n\\-River rafting tour, vine bridges, relax  \n\\-Planning on taking public transport around, any suggestions/tips?\n\n**Sat September 2: KOCHI**\n\n\\-1.5 hours away from Iya Valley via JR Train  \n\\-Hirome Market, Kochi Castle, anything else recommended?\n\n**Sun September 3: KOCHI / MATSUYAMA**\n\nBreakfast in Kochi, then hop on the train (\\~3 hours) to Matsuyama  \n\\-Dogo Onsen  \n\\-Main reason to go here is for Shimanami Kaido\n\n**Mon September 4: IMABARI / SHIMANAMI KAIDO CYCLING**\n\nFrom Matsuyama - Imabari: 35 minutes via JR Train  \n\\-Starting as early as the bike rental places open  \n\\-Dolce Ice cream, any suggestions on where else to stop? Was thinking bunny island but heard mixed reviews  \n\\-Stay the night on one of the islands, not sure which and exactly where yet\n\n**Tues September 5 - Wed September 6: ONOMICHI**\n\nFinish the Kaido Tuesday noon and arrive in Onomichi  \n\\-A good onsen bath reward after the biking  \n\\-Senkoji Ropeway\n\n**Thurs Sep 7 - Fri Sep 8: NAGOYA**\n\n\\-Breakfast in Onomichi, then hop on the train  \nOnomichi - Nagoya: 3 hours via JR Train\n\n**Sat September 9: CLIMB MT FUJI**\n\nTake train from Nagoya - Shin-Fuji Station - Fujinomiya Trail 5th Station: (1.5 hours + 2.5 hours = 4 hours total)\n\n\\-Fujinomiya trail takes 5 hours to the summit, so we are thinking of starting the climb around noon to see the sunset/sunrise (do people usually do this?)  \n\\-Stay on hut overnight, continue hike for sunrise  \n\\-(Hoping we can actually ascend, as the website says the last day of the season is September 10)\n\n**Sunday September 10: LAKE KAWAGUCHIKO**\n\n\\-Ascend via Yoshida Trail and transit to resort  \n\\-Relax for rest of day\n\n**Monday September 11: LAKE KAWAGUCHIKO / TOKYO**\n\n**-**Spend morning at Fuji Q  \n\\-Train back to Tokyo (2 hours)\n\n**Tuesday September 12: Fly home!**\n\nAbout us: We are an extremely active couple so lots of hiking and physical activities, nature, scenery, *lots of good food and nightlife*, going off-the-beaten track, but also interested in shopping, drinking (not too crazy) and touristy destinations as well!\n\nGeneral questions:  \n\\-3 week JR pass is definitely worth it for my trip?  \n\\-What data options for phone is suitable for a 3 week stay?  \n\\-If stayed in any of the cities mentioned above, how much time did you need in each city? How much did you budget for?  \n\\-If you've been to Shikoku Island, should we skip Kochi and go straight to Matsuyama from Iya Valley (and have an extra night in Iya Valley *or* Matsuyama)?\n\nI sincerely thank you in advance and look forward to updating a trip report to return the favor of this subreddit!",

It\u2019s a gorgeous area - I hope you have a great time.",

Would you say that 1 night / 1.5 days is enough time, or should we skip Kochi and stay longer? How long would it take to do all of the sightseeing in the area?",

Check if you can still get a hut reservation, they were booked out super quickly this year. \n\nI liked the bunny island, it\u2019s a nice stop for shimanami kaido. There are a couple of hotels close to the ferry port, so convenient to drop off your stuff and then go to the bunny island with your bike.\n\nDogo Onsen is still being renovated, so the main part is closed. The big temple is worth a visit, Ishiteji, unlike any other temple I\u2019ve seen in Japan.\n\nScarecrow village is interesting as well if you\u2019re close to the vine bridges.",

It\u2019s close to the ferry to the bunny island, and it\u2019s a good midway point on the kaido. We woke up early on day 2, went to the island from 8am - 11am (the island is small enough that this was the perfect amount of time) then finished off the kaido by 5-6pm.",

            "comment": "On arrival in Narita:\n\n\\- If you have a JR Pass (which you should look into, seeing the amount of JR railway travel), activate it at the ticket office. \n\nAs we speak, a one-way trip for 1 person Tokyo-Kyoto with the Shinkansen already sets you back 93 EUR. You can use the JR pass on all JR trains, so if you take a 21-day pass, you'll also be able to take the trains to day-trip destinations from your main base in each city. Like Gifu castle from Nagoya or Fushimi-Inari Taisha from Kyoto. It's the full JR railway network. Only some privatised rails are exempt.\n\n\\- Get some cash. Japan is a very cash-based society. \n\n\\- With a JR pass, you can take the Narita express to Tokyo without additional costs.\n\n\\- At Tokyo station, get an IC Card like Suicia. You can use the card to travel within many different cities. It's a rechargable card that you just tab to check in and tab to check out on subway and busses. You put money on it so you don't need to bother with those small tickets and not having the exact amount of cash on hand to pay in busses.\n\nWith the Shinkansen, it is incredibly easy to travel large distances. Tokyo-Kyoto only takes about 2-3 hours. So it really just depends on what you want to do and experience.",

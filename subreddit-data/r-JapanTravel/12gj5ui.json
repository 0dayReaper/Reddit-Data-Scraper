    "postText": "Hello! First time travelling to Japan. It will be our (belated!) honeymoon. I am very much a planner while my husband is laid back and likes to go with the flow. I'm trying not to over-plan days so we have time to explore naturally. Here is what I have planned so far:  \n  \n\n\n\n**Tuesday April 25th:** \n\n\nArrive in Tokyo (Narita) around 5.30pm.     \n\n\nPick up pocket wifi. We are not getting JR passes. Check into hotel in Shinjuku.    \n\n\nTake it easy for the evening/potter about.    \n\n   \n\n\n**Wednesday April 26th:**   \n\n\nExplore/Shop: Shibuya and Harajuku.   \n\n\nGo to a cat cafe (always wanted to go to one).  \n\n\nShibuya Sky booked at 5.40pm.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Thursday April 27th:**   \n\n\nDisney Sea (Tickets booked)  \n\n  \n\n\n**Friday April 28th:**  \n\n\nStudio Ghibli Museum tickets booked at 10am.  \n\n\nPossibly Gotakuji Temple and Shirohige Cream Puff Factory? These seem a bit out of the way. Not 100% on what to do post Ghibli Musuem.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Saturday April 29th:** \n\n\nTeam Lab Planet tickets booked at 9.30am.  \n\n\nTsukiji FirshMarket around 11am.  \n\n\nExplore Akihabara and Asakusa in the afternoon.   \n\n\nSenso-ji Temple (closes at 5)  \n\n\nAnother option for the afternoon is Tokyo City Flea Markets  \n\n  \n\n\n**Sunday April 30th:**  \n\n\nFly from Haneda to Nagoya. Arrive in Nagoya around 9am.   \n\n\nLeave bags in hotel and explore.   \n\n\nI have left Nagoya as more 'chill' days as Tokyo will be very busy.   \n\n  \n\n\n**Monday May 1st:**  \n\n\nExplore Nagoya. Maybe try and book a tea ceremony?  \n\n  \n\n\n**Tuesday May 2nd:** \n\n\nTrain to Kyoto in the morning.   \n\n\nLeave bags at hotel.  \n\n\nNishiki Fish Market.  \n\n\nMachiya Starbucks -Ninenzaka Yasasaka Chaya.  \n\n\nExplore Gion.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Wednesday May 3rd:**\n\n\nFushimi Inari Shrine (early).  \n  \n\n\n\n**Thursday May 4th:** \n\n\nArashiyama.  \n\n\nKinkakuji Temple.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Friday May 5th:** \n\n\nTrain early to Osaka.  \n\n\nLeave bags at hotel.  \n\n\nExplore Shinsaibashi.  \n\n\nDotonbori.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Saturday May 6th:**  \n\n\nUniversal Studios (tickets booked).  \n\n  \n\n\n**Sunday May 7th:** \n\n\nTrain to Nara.   \n\n\nExplore Nara deer park.  \n\n\nTodai-ji Temple.  \n\n\nStay overnight in ryokan.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Monday May 8th:** \n\n\nTrain back to Osaka.  \n\n\nKimono rental.  \n\n\nExplore Osaka castle.  \n\n\nNanba Shrine.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Tuesday May 9th:** \n\n\nCheck out of hotel.   \n\n\nLeave bags somewhere.   \n\n\nFree day - flight leaves 11.45pm from Kansai International.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nI'm aware we are going to be in Kyoto over Golden Week which isn't ideal but we cannot change it. There are some pretty sparse days, as I don't want every day to be jam packed, however welcome more suggestions. Basically is there anything we are missing that is a must do in any of these locations? My favourite things to do are just potter about and look at cute things haha.   \n\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "The way I approached my Tokyo trip was to plan neighborhoods for each half of a day, which was based off of places where I wanted to eat. \n\nThe sites you want to see can act as a framework as you build up your itinerary further. Ok, so you\u2019ll be on the eastern edge of the city for Akiba and Asakusa, so you\u2019re probably going to want to eat dinner over there. Where could you go? Honestly, looking at Google maps at high rated places is a pretty easy way to find great spots. Or use a guide slime Lonely Planet. Or, even if you wanted to be a little more loosey goosey, walk around and see what you want to see in the neighborhoods and peek at restaurants on your walk. Does it look low-key? Do they make something you like? Are you feeling tired and just want to order from a machine out front and give your ticket to a worker and sit and just eat? \n\nI planned each half of the day with things I wanted to see, where I wanted to eat, and some shops I wanted to visit. A little less than half the time I didn\u2019t eat where I wanted, either because my schedule was thrown off, I couldn\u2019t find the place, or I changed my schedule on purpose to fit in something else. One time I wanted to go to some really good ramen place but I was starving and couldn\u2019t find it, so I just went to a burrito place. No shame. I had a plan if I wanted, but it was okay to not do it. I found I felt safer with something scouted ahead of time so it wasn\u2019t 6:00 and I\u2019m hungry and I\u2019m in a new neighborhood pacing the streets trying to find somewhere to go and I \u201cwaste\u201d a meal on something I didn\u2019t like or didn\u2019t want.\n\nThe Edo-Tokyo Open Air Museum is near Ghibli Museum and is super super cool to see. Old buildings that plucked from Tokyo and put outside in a slightly-wooded area for you to explore. You can\u2019t go in most of them fully, but they do have some you can go into, including an old house where you have to take your shoes off for.",

Focus on those things you want to see, then look up other attractions around it that you can visit while you\u2019re in their neighborhoods before or after that place. For me, it was all about making each train ride count. I didn\u2019t want to travel to Shibuya just to see the crossing and then ride somewhere else. I\u2019d go to Center Street and visit some record stores and then eat at a certain conveyor belt sushi spot there.",

Sakae is more trendy and has lots of restaurants but nothing super touristy. I haven\u2019t been to the Ghibli Park so can\u2019t speak about it.",

I think there are fewer people showing off their Harajuku fashion post Covid.  Harajuku was more crowded on 12/30 than Tokyo Disney Sea was on 12/31 and the lines for crepes and other snacks were a good 20-30 people long.\n\nI would think it makes more sense to rent a kimono in Kyoto.  There tend to be more places there with a greater variety in prints.\n\nI hope you have express passes for USJ because you are going the Saturday of Golden Week.  If you don't have express passes expect to find 1-3 hour lines for most attractions.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "For Nara if the afternoon has clear weather and you feel up for a small hike, Mt Wakakusa would probably make for an excellent picnic/sunset spot. It was really lovely when I went last week, though sadly I had other plans and couldn't stay for sunset. I would consider it the \"nature\"-y equivalent of the Shibuya sky sunset slot you have booked.\n\nFor teamlab Planets make sure you have some fairly easily removable shoes and probably wear shorts / clothes than sit above the knee, otherwise you'll have to deal with rolling or holding them up. (And not a skirt, or wear some safety shorts underneath if wearing a skirt).\n\nFor Arashiyama I recommend Okochi Sanso Garden for a really lovely little garden circuit walk, followed by a look out of the Okochi Sanso Gorge Observation deck which should have a nice view of the gorge (this spot isn't accessible from the garden though which google maps would lead you to believe! You have to go around via the north end of Kameyama park)\n\nRegarding Machiya Starbucks, it is really busy. I went past it twice on different days and it was too full to order anything. Still cute to take some photos outside but don't bet on getting a seat and ordering anything.\nKiyomizudera nearby is lovely. Kimono rentals in this area are plentiful and I recommend it over Osaka personally. Make sure you book Kimono rental in advance, it will probably be cheaper to do so as well as save you the hassle of going around and finding places are booked out.\n\nDisneySea be prepared to be there well in advance, park seems to open an hour earlier than advertised and is packed, queues were already reaching 40 minute lengths about 15 minutes before the park opened. Recommend setting up the app on your phone and try to check that it will actually accept your credit card if you think you might try to book express passes for some rides.\n\nUSJ seemed to open 2hrs before the advertised opening time, beyond that there are plenty of other threads and I've written another comment about what that was like, similar to above get the app set up and ready on your phone for booking area tickets.\n\nFingers crossed for you that you have some good weather for Shibuya Sky, my party got super unlucky with rain on both our Shibuya Sky sunset slot and our Tokyo Skytree day :(\n\nFor Fushimi Inari be prepared for a decent climb, I recommend getting there 730 or earlier as there were already crowds when I started at 8am. Don't get caught up taking photos with the first Tori you come across as they will be all over the place. Best views out of there are from the junction halfway up the hike before the loop.\n\nYou'll definitely be able to fit more things on the Fushimi Inari day also. With my 8am start I was done by 930am, I did some things in Nara on that same day.\n\nEnjoy your trip! I'm writing this comment from the Kansai Airport Express on my way home after a 16 day trip and I already miss Japan.. Can't wait to come back again",

So it isnt just the Bamboo grove that you visit. \n\nFor your travel, make sure to search for Festivals in the days you are in Japan. There is always a festival every month.",

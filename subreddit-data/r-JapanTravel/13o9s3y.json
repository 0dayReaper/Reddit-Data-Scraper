I eat a GF diet, so I found some restaurants I\u2019d like to try. Any recommendations for must see or interesting activities are welcome.

Speaking from experience. It\u2019s more than enough space for clothing if you can squeeze laundry in and you can just buy a cheap duffel bag to check on the way back for souvenirs. \n\nFor the Hakone area, there is a a great loop you can do that goes through Owakudani and ends in Gora (if that is where your stay is). This video from Japan guide goes over it: https://youtu.be/sQAa7zMFJKE",

That way you don\u2019t have to carry it all the time but it\u2019s still small enough so that if you do have to carry it (stairs or to put it on a shelf) it\u2019s not that bad, you can also use it to rest your backpack or other small bag on top of. The last time I went I brought a backpack and carry on sized roller, this time I\u2019m thinking I might leave the backpack behind.",

A bit to frequent location change for my taste, but the individual days appear very realistic. \n\nIf you need to store luggage all larger train stations will have lockers, where you can store your stuff.\n\nFor the 7/11 definitely do it, having at least one meal from a konbini is part of the Japan experience. I would not plan that although, i think it will happen anyways at some point of your travel that 7/11, Lawson etc. is the most convenient option. \n\nFor your Nara day trip I would recommend to combine it with the Fushimi inarii shrine, as it is on the route to Nara.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm planning on solo traveling to Japan for 28 days and I wanted to hear some advice on the overall itinerary and possible solutions for the Hokkaido section of the plan. Some emphasis for this trip are general tourism, onsens, and anime sightseeing. Please note that I am using the JR pass as well. Here is what I have so far:\n\n\n\nJuly 27 - Tokyo:\nArrive from airport, get some basic necessities (sim card, etc), rest at hotel\n\n\nJuly 28 - Tokyo/Hakone:\n\n* Visit nearby places from hotel casually\n\n* Get other necessities\n\n* Head over to Hakone by the afternoon\n\n* Rest at Hakone onsens to get rid of jetlag\n\n\nJuly 29 - Hakone\n\n* Rest at Onsens, visit nearby places\n\n\nJuly 30 - Osaka\n\n* Afternoon: Start heading over Osaka\n\n* Get settled down at a hotel\n\n* Visit Dotonburi\n\n\nJuly 31 - Osaka\n\n* Osaka Castle\n\n* Pokemon Center\n\n* Goof off\n\n* Dotonburi\n\n\nAugust 1 - Osaka\n\n* Universal Studios\n\nAugust 2 - Osaka\n\n* Osaka Aquarium\n\n* Goof off at some arcade or something\n\n\nAugust 3 - Okayama\n\n* Early morning train to Okayama\n\n* Morning: Kurashiki Canal Area\n\n* Afternoon: Okayama Castle &amp; Okayama Garden\n\n\nAugust 4 - Kinosaki\n\n* Early Morning: Train to Kinosaki\n\n* Enjoy Onsens and relax for rest of the time\n\n\nAugust 5 - Kinosaki\n\n* Onsens in the morning\n\n* Head over to Kyoto and rest there\n\n\nAugust 6 - Kyoto\n\n* Early Morning: Fushimi-Inari\n\n* Afternoon: Kiyomizu-dera, Philosopher\u2019s Path\n\n* Evening/Night: Gion/Pontocho\n\n\nAugust 7 - Kyoto\n\n* Manga Museum\n\n* Arashiyama Monkey Park\n\n* Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka\n\n\nAugust 8- Nara\n\n* Morning: Kyoto -&gt; Nara\n\n* Day Trip to Nara Park\n\n* Afternoon/Evening - Train to Nagoya\n\n\nAugust 9 - Nagoya\n\n* Osu Shotengai\n\n* Inuyama\n\n* Local sightseeing\n\nAugust 10 - Tokyo\n\n* Akihabara: Game shops, Anime shops\n\n\nAugust 11 - Tokyo\n\n* Comiket\n\n\nAugust 12 - Tokyo\n\n* Kawasaki City\n\n\nAugust 13 - Tokyo\n\n* Shinjuku\n\n\nAugust 14 - Tokyo\n\n* Shibuya\n\n* Imperial Castle\n\n\nAugust 15 - Hokkaido\n\n*???\n\n\nAugust 16 - Hokkaido\n\n* ???\n\n\nAugust 17 - Hokkaido\n\n* ???\n\n\nAugust 18 - Hokkaido\n\n* ???\n\n\nAugust 19 - Hokkaido\n\n* ???\n\n\nAugust 20 - Kanazawa\n\n* Kanazawa Garden\n\n* Omichou Market\n\n* Ninja Temple\n\n\nAugust 21 - Takayama\n\n* Local sightseeing\n\n* Maybe Onsen?\n\nAugust 22 - Tokyo\n\n* Light sightseeing,\n\n* Last minute check if there are any nearby spots I missed\n\n* Get souvenirs\n\n\nAugust 23 - Tokyo\n\n* Get ready for the flight back home\n\n\nAs you can see, the Hokkaido section is kind of blank because I am having a hard time thinking of what to do, and if it is even worth it to go with the short amount of time I have and how expensive it is (additional flights needed). I researched that unlike the mainland where I will primarily be traveling to, the Hokkaido region lacks the abundance of bullet trains/trains which makes it more difficult to travel across the region in a timely manner. Furthermore, I might consider coming to Hokkaido in the winter time in a later date, which makes me doubt whether I should go to Hokkaido even more.\n\n\n\nTo replace this, I have considered a few alternatives. I could add an additional day for Kyoto, or increase the variety of smaller prefectures/cities like extending Takayama to 2 days and visiting Chichibu to see the Anohana bridge. I could also replace the entire Hokkaido section with a plane ride to the Kyushu region, but this also contributes to more plane fees. Or maybe, my plan does not adequately evaluate the days needed for some cities so I could allocate more time to specific regions\n\n\nHow would you rate this itinerary and how should I deal with the potential 5 day supplement of removing Hokkaido? I also would like to note that my plan for Tokyo has been dividing each day to a specific city, and the activities yet are not as elaborate because I haven\u2019t been able to plan it out as thoroughly yet, and I also prefer places like Akihabara to be more casual and explore the city without a strict schedule",

I would recommend going north but not all the way to Hokkaido because it gets more difficult/time consuming to get around there. I went to Sendai, Morioka and Fukushima (Namie, Okuma the small villages near the exploded nuclear reactors) and it was a welcome break from Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. Way less (western) tourists, although that might be a con if you want to meet those while traveling alone.",

Move the Nagoya day to chain with Takayama to give you an extra day in Kyoto. Do day trips to Enoshima/Kamakura, Yokohama, Nikko.\n\nTake in to consideration that you'll likely be accumulating stuff the whole time. \n\nyou probably want to add Nakano Broadway and Odaiba to your plans somewhere, maybe near the end because shopping.",

I found it to be centrally located and my hotel (Vessel Inn Namba) was reasonably quiet.\n\nif you are having trouble filling the Hokkaido days, consider another couple of days in Tokyo. I liked DisneySea but you could add another district or two such as Ikebukuro or Roppongi.",

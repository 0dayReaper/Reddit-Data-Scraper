    "postText": "Just wanted to give everyone a heads up regarding the physical rail pass paper ticket and magnets. I carried my ticket in my pocket along with my Apple magsafe wallet and iphone magsafe phone case and im pretty sure the magnetism corrupted the magnetic data on my pass. I was eventually unable to use my ticket in the automated gate and had to go thru the JR office each time and show them my pass. Not the end of the world but definitely an inconvenience to have to show your pass everytime.",

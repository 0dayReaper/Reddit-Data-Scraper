    "postText": "Hello all!  Wife and I finally get to take our honeymoon exactly 2 years after we originally planned it thanks to Covid.  We are both 30 years old, I turn 31 in Japan and have a special dinner planned.  I know our travel is going to put us in a ton of different places for mostly 1 night, so we will be living out of backpacks mostly, but we have no day trips planned which we hope makes up for it!  The brunt of our travels will be in Kyoto for 5 days, everything else is 1 or 2 nights in different places.  I have been to Japan once about 10 years ago.  Neither my wife nor I particularly like big cities, I grew up outside LA, and we've been to Edinburgh, London, Barcelona, Madrid, Dublin, NYC, ETC.  Every time we are in a major metro area we just don't enjoy it, so we have avoided many major cities (Except Kyoto, because I mean, it's Kyoto).

I went with a friend on my second trip to Japan, and we had fun and wandered into a random street fair after, but we barely stayed 10 minutes at the actual temple.\n\nWhere are you going for the day trip to Mt Fuji? I think that seems a little ambitious for such a short trip.",

Fuji is still TBD because of the weather and what not, but I will likely hire a tour on klook/viator if I'm feeling lazy. If I'm REALLY exhausted, I'll probably just shop and go watch a Tokyo Giants game. Thanks your feedback!",

Make sure you're ready for the line to leave. \n\nHopefully your cardio is up because June 3rd is busy busy doing tsukiji &gt; Odaiba &gt; Ginza &gt; Imperial Palace. That's a long day.\n\nFor tsukiji, bring cash and get there around 8-9am. The tour buses and other tourists get there around 9am and it gets shoulder to shoulder. \n\nUniglo Ginza is pretty far away from Nihombashi where the pokemon cafe/center is. It's a far walk unless you take the train which is still 15 minutes. Get a custom Tshirt at the Uniglo. It only takes like 45 minutes.",

I knew it felt a bit packed hence the reason why I'll likely punt Skytree. Would that make it any better?\n* June 1: Did you go to Shibuya Sky during sunset? If so, do you have a recommended time to book so I can be on the roof on time?\n* June 3: I've been walking/jogging 3-5 miles a day (8K steps). So I'm in decent shape, but yeah, I expect 20K to be the norm for a few of the days. \n* Great tips for the rest, especially since I'll be going to Tsukiji on a Saturday (ack!)",

We stayed at Tavinos which is on the north end of Asakusa which is about 5-7 minutes away from Sensoji temple. If you are staying at the APA you are on the south side and about 5-6 minutes from Kaminarimon gate. \n\nYou should probably do Sensoji then Nakamise-Dori first. Which should get you to the south side near Kaminarimon and then walk to Tawarmachi for the Ginza line to Ueno Station or take the Tsukuba Express to Akihabara. \n\nEither or you can take the Hibiya Line from Akihabara to Ueno and then take the other way back. \n\n\nJune 1st. We tired to get it for sunset but the lines made us miss it. You have to book in advance. There is no time limit so you can just chill up there. They don't allow you to have any food or drink or any bags or anything. Everything has to be put into a coin locker.\n\nJune 3: We walked 20k steps avg each day for all 12 days. There's no sitting or leaning anywhere in Japan. We often had to take breaks at mcdonalds. Don't expect to sit on the subway or anywhere. Dont' forget shoes. You'll be on your feat for almost 10 hours a day.",

It's like a big perogie\n\nWendy's dessert is really good. I like the azuki and mochi with ice cream. \n\nThe lowest day was 15k steps and that was our trip to Kyoto on the Shinkansen. \n\nOur feet were destroyed. Luckily I brought ankle braces to help support but my calves were always on fire.",

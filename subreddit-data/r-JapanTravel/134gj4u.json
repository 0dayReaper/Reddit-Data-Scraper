    "postText": "This is my first time traveling to Tokyo, and I\u2019ve been having a great time. However I\u2019ve never been groped, fondled more in this week then in my entire 27 years of life. It\u2019s really starting to sour the experience. I\u2019m had my butt, vagina, breast groped. Even going under my shirt. \n\nThis has happened on the train, club, bar and just plain street. Pretty much anytime there is a crowd. \n\nThe times that I saw who it was, they would just pretend nothing happened. Staff don\u2019t care.\n\nIs this a normal occurrence?\n\nEdit: Just so people know I have taken preventive measures, I didn\u2019t go out alone. Met with other solo travelers. Avoided rush hours and have been taking Ubers. Staying in Ginza. Have just been wearing plain shirts and jeans. It\u2019s happened in broad day light with lots of people around.",

Avoid rush hour, especially mornings, and after these trash have been drinking.",

I had never seen catcalling in Japan when I was there but I think this is due to their cultural rule \"don't disturb others\" or as scumbags apparently interpret \"don't get caught\" so this would be why I never saw it happen I think .. Sorry for anyone going through this I wonder how Japanese women handle this situation. They probably have a Japanese word for it and with that collective knowledge to draw from on the matter.",

Especially with black people due to xenophobia pertaining to African immigrants and refugees. I wonder if they are more leery of harassing white women because we might be more believed by police. \n\nAre you planning on traveling outside of Tokyo? Hopefully you might have better experiences in other areas. I found people in Kyoto to be very kind. And their transport system is buses not subway based so less opportunity for harassment since people are mostly seated when traveling.",

Now I live in Osaka and I haven\u2019t had any groping still in my year or so living here but I have had 4 encounters with \u201cButsukari otoko\u201d, men who deliberately crash into you (probably some weird sort of power thing) and they go off so fast you can rarely do anything. \nI can always tell it\u2019s deliberate because either I\u2019m trying to move out the way of them when walking and they slam me so hard instead of trying to move themselves too, or I\u2019ve had a few times where I\u2019ve just been standing still and they\u2019ve gone into me full force (once standing in the queuing area for the train and another time I was against a station wall trying to text my friend).",

I am planning on being out in the daytime and back at my hotel for the evening so I am happy to stay there if it is fine in the daytime . I would like to do alot of wandering and exploring and walking in the first few days so just to be close to places to wander around in would be great. \n\nI\u2019ll add Kabuki -cho to my maps so I can steer clear! Is it okay to be around that area in the daytime or a bad idea?",

Not as much trouble as he should have gotten in, but pretty funny.

Im currently in Tokyo F(32) with my best friend F(31) and we have not experienced anything. \n\nI must say we came from a contry that also tends to have a lot of sexual assault so we instinctly follow certain rules that lower this kind of stuff (which is bad as we shouldnt be doing it as this shouldnt happen)\n\nSome tips: never go into the train in rush hour. Wait till you see a train where you can get into a safe place without crowds. Always try to get in the last or first car as there it is where the choffer is. \n\nUse a backpack or a bag that is big enough to cover your behind. \n\nIf something doesnt feel right, its ok to stop so People can pass you or to Just get out of line. Trust your woman instics. \n\nDont go into weird alleys if you are alone\nWalk with confidence as if you know where are you going. Even if you have your cellphone at hand following a map Just look confident.\n\nIf you cant get confidence at that moment, there is a trick my big Sister taught me: Just remember something that made you really mad, something that someone did to you in the past.  Like when you are having a really bad Day and is someone tries to do something to you they Will gonna get it.\n\n\nHope it helps, but remember its not our fault at all. I hate those kind of Men.",

We all commute to Tokyo but can't usually travel together because our schedules are different. I think it'd be safer if we were in a group but it's just not realistic. I wish it wasn't this way but unfortunately there's not much you as an individual can do about it to prevent it. If it ever happens again, make a HUGE scene. I don't care if it's impolite to be loud in public. Literally scream as loud as you can. They think they can get away with it because you won't do anything about it and they won't get caught. Yelling draws all the attention to them and they'll back off and hopefully get arrested by police. I know that when it happened to my friend this weekend, she was in a crowded train station just waiting for her train to come. She was too shocked to speak so he didn't get caught. Also if you aren't aware, trains often have women only cars (some trains only have this during rush hour but other trains have it all day) which are probably a safer way to travel. I usually try to get on that one in the mornings. But I'm SO sorry this has happened to you. It's not your fault at all.",

This older man literally was holding the bar above me and had his whole crotch PUSHED against my butt. I kept trying to at least turn my body a bit sideways but he was super forceful. My husband had gotten pushed in another direction so I was literally staring at him from afar with panic in my eyes!",

I\u2019m traveling with my husband and I\u2019m six months pregnant so I didn\u2019t expect to have much issue as I\u2019m not really doing night life, but that hasn\u2019t been the case. Ive been elbowed in the chest, body slammed by men walking by, and touched inappropriately by an old man when I was waiting to cross the road. I even had a girl kick stones at me today at Osaka Castle. It\u2019s frickin surreal. I don\u2019t know if my pregnant belly is causing people to get annoyed or if it\u2019s that I\u2019m clearly a foreigner but I\u2019m at my wits end and I still have another five days here. I am so uncomfortable that I have started looking at changing my flights to leave earlier.",

Predators find targets who are not used to doing so. It\u2019s easier with men present but try not to take a local train during prime commuting hours. So instead of leaving at 9 and returning at 5, do like 11-8 days and you\u2019ll have space.",

In fact now looking back I think I was groped a little but at the time it did not register. Outside of that and one other minor creepy interaction, people were just staring/saying nice things to me but I do have pretty strong RBF face, I\u2019m tall, and tend to tune men out naturally. I went to Ueno instead of those other areas and had fun (although men were def cheating on their girlfriends and when I realized that I left), I think the more student like vibe was helpful in feeling more comfortable even if they spoke less English in that area.",

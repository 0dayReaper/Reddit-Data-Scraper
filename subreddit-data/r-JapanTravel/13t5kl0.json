Then adding an Akasuka stop on my last day for a nature vibe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4: TOKYO DISNEYLAND**\n\n* 7:15-9AM - Shinjuku to Disneyland\n* 9AM-9PM - Disneyland/Packed Lunch\n* 9-10:15PM - Disneyland Shinjuku\n* 10:15-11PM - Dinner\n\n**Day 5: IKEBUKURO/WARNER BROS TOKYO/SHINJUKU**\n\n* 9:30-10AM- Shinjuku to Ikebukuro\n* 10AM-2PM - Free time/Lunch\n* 2PM-3PM- Ikebukuro to Toshimaen\n* 3-7PM - Warner Bros Tokyo\n* 7-8PM - Toshimaen to Shinjuku\n* 8-11PM - Free time/Dinner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6: UENO**\n\n* Shinjuku to Asakusa - 7-730AM\n* Free time (Sensoji Temple, Asakusa Shrine) - 7:30-9:30AM\n* Asakusa to Ueno - 9:30AM-10AM\n* Free time/Lunch - 10AM-4PM\n* Ueno to Narita Airport - 4-6PM\n* Leaving Tokyo - 9:30PM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. I\u2019m thinking of replacing Ghibli Museum with Odaiba if I don\u2019t get tickets. Would that be a good mix with Shibuya on same day?\n2. Thinking of just going to 2-3 temples in Kamakura since it\u2019s summer (July-Aug) when I go and I do want to go to Shimokitazawa. My partner\u2019s also more fond of the city view than temples. Is this enough time for Kamakura, and would it be ok to only go to Hokokugi and Tsurugaoka?\n3. Since my hotel is in Shinjuku, figured it would be ok to have Kamakura and Shimokitazawa together. Does the sched look ok, and does it give ample time for Shimokitazawa?\n4. On Kamakura and the weather, I\u2019m also prepared to switch it up with Harajuku instead, then switching Day 5 Harajuku with Ikebukuro. Would that make more sense, or would my itinerary be too much city touring?\n5. Let me know if the itinerary still looks too packed. I put \u201cfree time\u201d since I don\u2019t expect to go to all the places listed, so we wouldn\u2019t be too stressed out\n6. I placed Warner Bros Tokyo there given that\u2019s the likely booking time, and Disneyland on day 4 since this is post-weekend\n7. Any food reccs on where to eat after Disneyland? Planning to pack lunch since it might be overpriced there. Current plan is dinner when I\u2019m back in Shinjuku at 10:15\n8. I initially placed Asakusa early morning of Day 6, but it might just be less stressful I go to one place",

You can't just show up and buy tickets to go in. You can stay as long as you like but you can't go into the museum before your set time. Even in Japan you have to buy your tickets a month in advance from 7-11 not at the museum.\n\nIf you are going to be in Harajuku you should go check out Yoyogi park and Majin shrine.\n\nThere is also a national park near Shibuya that is really nice. There is an entrance fee but it's small like \u00a5300.\n\nUeno park is awesome! There are six museums, a zoo (one of my favorites) and at least two shrines. The natural history museum there has the original Hachiko (he was stuffed after his death) on display.\n\nEnjoy your trip!",

Just make sure to drink lots of water. There are vending machines everywhere so it will be easy to get drinks. I always carried a folding fan with me for when I was out and about in the summer there. Picary Sweat is a sports drink (like Gatorade) and can be found in most of the vending machines as well. I'm not big on sports drinks but my husband and daughter both really liked it. Don't expect the malls /inside places to be cool. Yeah they are cooler than outside but usually not by much. Night time is really not any better except that you don't have the sun beating down on you as well. It can feel like you have a wet blanket wrapped around you.",

I did it like that when I went back in 2019 to ghibli museum.\n\nAlso don\u2019t try to buy from the English ticket site. Just open a Lawson ticket account before 10th of a month and then order ticket from Japanese Lawson site with translate. Login and order immediately at 10am JST on the 10th for the next month. Ghibli tickets there are much more available than the tickets on the international site which get sold out immediately within 15 minutes when the reservation window opens.\n\nYou will get a QR code which you can then exchange in a Lawson in Japan to ticket vouchers.\n\nThe international site also has a very annoying queuing system in place even if you try to book immediately when the reservation opens its impossible tp get the date you want.",

It\u2019ll take you an hour to get there from Shinjuku and another hour and a half to get back to Shimokita (including several train changes). It just seems like a waste of time if you\u2019re only going to spend a few hours there. I would either devote a whole day to Kamakura (combined with Enoshima) or drop it. \n\nLike another poster said, if you\u2019re not super into temples, but just want to see one while you\u2019re here, go to Asakusa. \n\nIt makes much more sense to stop by Shimokitazawa on your way to Shibuya from Kichijoji (Ghibli Musuem)\u2026it\u2019s literally a stop along the train line you\u2019ll have to take. \n\nOf course, then you\u2019ll have to spend less time in Shibuya\u2026but Shibuya doesn\u2019t really need six hours imo, unless you\u2019re really into shopping. And even then you\u2019re coming back on day 5 anyway, so you could see whatever you missed the first time around. \n\nOdaiba is being redeveloped, and a lot of the attractions there have been closed and/or are being relocated. TeamLab Planets is open, but it\u2019s not as good as Borderless imo. But you can check the website and see if it\u2019s something you\u2019d still be interested in. Other than, there isn\u2019t much to do in Odaiba besides shopping. \n\nIt\u2019s only a half hour from Shibuya so you could certainly combine the two\u2026but I think there\u2019s a lot of other neighborhoods in Tokyo that would be more worthwhile to check out.",

I would be exhausted going to Kamakura and then Shimokita after \ud83e\udd75\n\nIn the end I guess it all depends on how genki you are and what your priorities are \ud83d\ude09 \n\n\nHappy to help if you need any more advice.",

Odaiba can also mix with Tsukiji if you are interested in that\n\n-  There are temples in Tokyo that strangely you dont include in your trip like SensoJi in Asakusa. There other shrines too like Meiji shrines if you are into those. You can probably skip Kamakura unless there is a burning sight you want to see. Day 6 should not be an issue in the morning.\n\n- The itinerary looks somewhat leisurely in my opinion - looks good!\n\n-",

And yes, would add more temples if I were to skip Kamakura.\n\nThinking of doing Harajuku then Shimokitazawa for that day. Then adding Asakusa before I go to Ueno on the last day. If I plan to leave Ueno at 4PM on the last day, is it possible to still add Asakusa in the early morning, or will my day be overboard?",

Don't let the weather dictate what you will see. I am personally not that into parks unless there is a specific point of interest or destination within the park. For instance, there is this tea shop Nakajima-no-Ochaya in the middle of Hamarikyu that looks interesting. \n\nMaybe feasible for Day 6 is Harajuku  and Asakusa. BUT Asakusa should be done the very first thing in the morning as stores in Harajuku doesn't open until 11AM anyway.  You will also avoid the crowd in Asakusa. I am not sure what you want to see in Ueno or Shimokitazawa. If you have to leave for airport this day, I would keep this day fairly simple.",

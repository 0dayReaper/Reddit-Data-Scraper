Shinkansen takes a bit over 2 hours, so it's doable but personally I'd want to crash in Tokyo. \n\nFor souvenirs I bought a few things in Kappabashi street, which is where you can buy kitchen stuff, knives etc. It's fairly close to Senso- ji. Would recommend Tokuzo for knives.",

Personally I have travelled for more than 24 hrs before so hopefully I would be able to pull this off.\n\nThanks for the suggestions for souvenir shops. I am staying in Asakusa, I will definitely check out Kappabashi street. Is it also worth checking out Don Quijote?",

It\u2019s convenient to go to the one nearby then you can go early to avoid the crowds to actually shop and see things. The evenings are insanely crowded. My first trip I stayed in Shibuya and the location there is the MEGA Donquijote which is even bigger!",

You can probably find an economical yukata there. Also, are you familiar with a jinbei? It\u2019s usually a summer outfit, but relatively comfy and might be better suited for a young child. If all else fails, check out Toys R Us. It\u2019s interesting to see what domestic toys and clothes they have.",

            "comment": "I feel this is mostly a ambitious but sensibly so itinerary\n\nthe 9th of may wont work like that though. thats more like 2 days\n\nand I myself would recommend combining kinkakuji with arashiyama. although I just found out the time to travel from kinkakuji to arashiyama or ginkakuji is more or less the same.\n\nfine, so I will say. north higashiyama as well as arashiyama are both very dense with POIs. finishing a already began day in either, you just pick the one where you either spend less time if you have a second full day for the other location, or go where you would prefer if its you only chance.\n\nor maybe you let the bus decide when you exit kinkakuji, take the next one going either to ginkakuji or to arashiyama.",

    "postText": "Hello! The fam and I (6 people) are here for 13 days and we\u2019d love to make the most of it! So far this is all I have in the itinerary though before I find more things to do (recommendations welcome!). Also,  I'm aware Hilton Tokyo Bay hotel is horrible location wise (already got... informed on the discord lol) (currently in the process of finding a different place!).  I\u2019m wondering: \n\n1. If this is too packed and unrealistic to get done in this time\n2. If there are any huge things/experiences we\u2019re missing\n3. Does the Gion Matsuri Festival start on the night of June 30th or the night of July 1st?\n4. Is day 5 too light (more detailed question located in day 5)?\n5. Does the natural spring Onsen experience differ much from Tokyo, Kyoto, or Osaka? \n   1. We really would love to go to a natural one and it looks like there\u2019s a ton in all these places!\n\nAny tips/suggestions are *greatly* appreciated. Thank you!  \n\n\n# Day 1 (6/27) Tokyo\n\n* Arrive in Japan at 4 AM (traveling from the US so will be tired)\n* Tsukiji fish market (while Toyosu fish market is the current one, we prefer the atmosphere of  Tsukiji (and we hope to get fresh sushi there!))\n* Nap in hotel (Tokyo Disney Bay Hotel (bad location but doesn't seem like fam will budge with changing the location) &amp; wait for rest of group to land (\\~ 1pm)\n* 4:30 - Tokyo TeamLabs Planet\n* Shibuya (Shibuya Sky Scramble, Conveyor Belt Sushi, Ichiran ramen, Nabezo Shibuya Center)\n\n# Day 2 (6/28) Tokyo\n\n* Sensoji shrine, Nakamise-dori street, Kawarana Tile Breaking; Shinjuku Garden, Harajuku, Meiji Shrine, Akihabara, Dawn Robot Cafe, Finish up Shibuya exploration (maybe add Hachiko too).\n\n# Day 3 (6/29) Tokyo\n\n* Samurai Training in Shinjuku (\\~60 minutes), take our time and explore a little more of Tokyo (perhaps finishing what we weren't able to finish beforehand), Food: Gyukatsu Motomura (meat), Hinatoriyama (food by boat), Kaitenzushi (conveyor belt sushi)\r, Wanko-Soba  (conveyor belt soba)\r\n\n# Day 4 (6/30) - Tokyo/Kyoto\n\n* Tokyo -&gt; Kyoto on shinkansen (6 am shinkansen opens, gets there earliest by 8:40 am)\n* Arashiyama area (Sagano Scenic railway, Hozugawa river cruise, Kinakuji - golden pavilion)\n* Nishiki Market; Ginkakuji - Silver temple, Philosophers path; Higashiyama District, Kiyomizu-dera; Try to see some of the Gion Matsuri Festival that starts 7/1! (Does it start on the night of June 30th or the night of July 1st?) ; Sleep in Kyoto Ryokan\n\n# Day 5 (7/1) - Kyoto\n\n* Gion District (Kimono rental!, Hanamikoji Street, Pontocho Alley, Yasaka Shrine)\n* Flowing noodle restaurant - Hirobun (couldn't find one closer to our activities); Kyo-Kaiseki dinner; Sleep in (different) Kyoto Ryokan. Are there enough activities for Day 5? (and if not, do I find more or take from Day 4) \n\n# Day 6 (7/2) - Kyoto/Nara/Osaka\n\n* Wake up early and head to Fushimi Inari Gates\n* Kyoto--&gt; Nara (Deer Park, Nakatanidou Mochi Shop)\n* Nara --&gt; Osaka (Osaka Aquarium (finish 8pm the latest), Tempozan Ferris Wheel; Dotonbori to end the night (If we have energy); Sleep in Osaka)\n\n# Day 7 (7/3) - Osaka\n\n* Osaka Castle\r; Endo Sushi\r; Shinsaibashi Parco Mall\r; Shinsekai; Don Quitoje\r; Umeda Sky building\r\r; Sleep in Osaka\n\n# Day 8 (7/4)\n\n# Day 9 (7/5)\n\n# Day 10 (7/6)\n\n# Day 11 (7/7)\n\n# Day 12 (7/8) Mt.Fuji/Hakone\n\n* Planning on doing one of those half/full day activities so don't currently have details now\n* Sleep in Tokyo (Most of the group sleeps in normal hotels, I (and maybe 1-2 others) sleep in capsule hotel)\n\n# Day 13 (7/9)\n\n* Head to Haneda Airport (stocking up on Japanese goodies)\n   * Flight back to US at 11AM",

            "comment": "I see that you have 13 days and still have not planned day 8-11.. my suggestion is to add one or two more in Tokyo, add one more in Kyoto. The itinerary is too packed and not realistic. \n\nDay 1: In my opinion too tight if you visit TeamLabs at 430PM. Ideally you want to enter Shibuya Sky around 6Pm to enjoy sunset, twilight . It will be 7 or later by the time you get to Shibuya. At this time you will nead to eat too. Too packed. Recommend to explore Odaiba instead. There is Joypolis, Diver City, Gundam Store, a nice park with breathtaking view of Tokyo across the water.\n\nDay 2 - In my opinion, not realistic to jam all that in a day. Just the transit between areas take 30-40 minutes then an area like Meiji Shrine / Shinjuku Goen / Akihabara could easily take 2+ hours each. Rule of thumb in my opinion is 1 area in the morning, finish by 11AM/12PM, explore another area from 2PM-6PM then dinner, and move to final area by 7PM until late.\n\nDay 3 - I think this day is an opportunity to spread your Day 2 itinerary. Maybe Meiji AM, Akihabara and Harajuku.\n\nDay 4 - Gion Matsuri procession peaked at July 17 th. I am not sure if much is going on July 1st. I think July 1st is when they have a meeting. I am not sure how you are going to accomplish a scenic train ride after Shinkansen to Kyoto, a boat ride and still manage to go to Kinkakuji which closes at 5PM. I recommend this day the itinerary to move to Day 5\n\nDay 5 - Hirobun is pretty far. It will eat up 3 hrs return trip. I am not sure if this is your first trip to Kyoto? If so I recommend skipping this one. Recommend having day 4 itinerary here\n\nDay 6 - Nara is a day trip in itself. Osaka aquarium closes at 8PM and takes about 3 hours average.  That means, you bave to be at at Nara station by 4PM. \n\n\nDay 3 -",

            "comment": "The Hozugawa River Ride might be back by July or it might remain closed like it currently is.\n\n[https://www.hozugawakudari.jp/](https://www.hozugawakudari.jp/)\n\nUntil there is an actual re-opening date, I would not plan on doing it.\n\nI am not sure what you are defining as Mt. Fuji.  Do you mean trying to see Mt. Fuji from Lake Ashi in Hakone?  I mean there is always a chance, but that chance is quite low in July.  Do you mean Kawaguchiko and Hakone?  It's really hard to do them both in one day and again, your chances of seeing Mt. Fuji from Kawaguchiko or Hakone are rather low.  Your best chances will be super early in the morning and around sunset.  June, July and August are like the worst months for Fuji viewing between rain and humidity.  Some of your days feel really packed especially your early Tokyo days if you are traveling from Bayside on the Disney monorail into Tokyo proper.  It's a good 30+ minutes when all is said and done into Tokyo Station and then you need to transfer from the Keiyo line which is off in its own location far from all the other JR transfers.\n\nUnless you are planning to nap in a lounge, you will need to book the night of the 26th to get into your room on the 27th before like 3 or 4 pm, and you will need to let the hotel know ahead of time you are actually arriving on the 27th.",

It's like they can also get off at Hatchobori for the Hibiya.  \n\nIt's just an extra long trip to anywhere outside of TDR which they are not going to.  I get that the rooms are larger, but if you're not going to TDR it's a very weird area to stay because it's just a long trip anywhere.  It's not even like the Tokyo Disneyland Hotel or Ambassador,  where you can walk back to Maihama.  Bayside has to take a bus or the Disney monorail back to Maihama.",

And I hate switching hotels with a toddler more than anything, but there is no way in hell I would commute into Tokyo from Disney every day. You have to go on the monorail (which is relatively expensive for what it is), then train from Maihama, most likely into shin kiba, and then transfer at least one more time. Omg PLEAD with your family for the love of god. Also, they definitely won\u2019t let you check in anytime before 3:00. I did 2:45 and our room wasn\u2019t actually ready until 3:30.",

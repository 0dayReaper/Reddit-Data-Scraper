    "postText": "My wife and I traveled to Japan for 3 weeks during Sakura season this year, coming from the USA. We decided to go overboard on spending this trip and visited an Onsen town for an overnight stay in the middle of the trip, to see what it was like.\n  \nBefore I write the report, I do want to note how much we spent for others to know and decide if it\u2019s worth it for them:  \n49,580\u00a5 for the room  (24,640/person)  \n\u201cSuperior Japanese Style\u201d  \n8,400\u00a5 for the private Onsen in the hotel  \n  \nBreakfast was included, but we elected not to have dinner at the hotel. Overall, the USD cost was around ~$460 for the overnight visit, including food, but not including transportation  \n  \nNow, here\u2019s the full report:\nWe were in Kyoto for 5 days, then went from Kyoto Station to Kinosaki Onsen via the Limited Express Train using our JR pass. Getting the JR ticket in Kyoto took a while, but the ride is nice as to be expected from the trains here(travel time is around 2hour20mins~ to Kinosaki). We arrived around 1:30pm.  \n  \nWe had 3 mid-large sized luggage with us, which was a hassle, but after arriving in Kinosaki Station, thankfully it\u2019s very slow and way less crowded, so no problem getting luggage around the station area, even in Sakura season.  \nThe town has complimentary shuttle for many of the Onsen, you just walk out the station gate and there\u2019s a bus stop that they travel back and forth from. Even with the luggage we had, it was fine, plus most people ALSO have luggage.  \n  \nWe got off the shuttle early by accident at the Nishimuraya Honkan, not realizing the hotel was a separate location. The staff from the Honkan were very kind though, and took our luggage for us. Once we realized we had the wrong location, the staff put our luggage in a car and drove us to the hotel for free. The attendant was friendly and spoke some English with us, honestly one of the nicest interactions we had our whole trip!  \n  \nAfter arriving at the hotel around 2pm, the staff took our bags to the lobby and we waited to check in. The process was quick, and they gave us two drink tickets for the lobby lounge, and two 1,000 yen tickets to use at the large gift shop as well.  \n  \nAfter check-in, an attendant escorted our luggage with us to the room, directing us along the way. They didn\u2019t speak English very well, but it was never a problem and again, incredibly kind. The attendant put our luggage up, showed us around our room, and instructed us on where things were, how to use the facilities, etc. They have different sized complimentary Yukata and Geta to wear inside and outside the hotel, if you feel like walking the town in traditional clothing(many people did this, not just foreigners \ud83d\ude05). At the hotel, you give them a time to come to your room and make your beds for you.  \n  \nI want to mention: we were on the 5th floor and it had a gorgeous view. The room itself is quite large and open since it is Japanese style with tatami mat flooring. Excellent bathroom and bath facilities too. We were very pleased with it, plus they had free umeboshi on the desk in the room, which I\u2019d been wanting to try the whole trip!  \n  \nI\u2019ve been to probably over ~60 hotels and have only had a few experiences like this one. The staff are SUPERB, and definitely treat you like royalty while you\u2019re there.  \n  \nNow, our Onsen was scheduled for 5:45pm that day, so we decided to walk around the town and explore for a couple hours. The lobby has a magnificent lounge with a waterfall surrounded by Sakura. We got the season drinks which were strawberry milk / Strawberry soda. Both were GREAT. We left the hotel and walked through the town- whole area has a small river run through it and Sakura planted on the sides, so every step is picturesque. We walked around until 5:20pm and took photos, got snacks and looked for dinner after the onsen.  \n  \nThe Onsen itself was the \u201cRinsen/Chinese\u201d style. They offered 3 different types, Japanese, Chinese, and Bali. The Onsen had a rock sauna built in as well, which was great! Overall, we wish we had a bit more time inside(standard time was 1hr10mins), but the experience was fantastic.  \n  \nAfterwards, we went back into town for dinner, ending up with some Soba. Our first choice randomly closed early for the day, and the Soba was decent as a substitution. The beef in Kinosaki Onsen is supposedly legendarily good, but we went cheap on dinner since everything else was expensive. Plenty of $$$ restaurants if you have the money though. The hotel itself had a list of recommendations in their guidebook in the room.  \n  \nWe retired around 11pm!l Breakfast was from 7:30-9:30am and was in a large hall on the 2nd floor. The spread was AMAZING, full buffet, almost any breakfast item I could think of. Western and Japanese items included, with a lot of local items as well. The apples were SOOO good. I can\u2019t gush about it enough.  \n  \nAfterwards we packed back up and got ready, eventually getting a mug from the gift shop with our complimentary tickets before checking out. Same service when leaving as when entering.  \n  \nSo, overall? Incredibly worth it. We\u2019re going to research another location and do it again next trip. Everything about it made it the highlight of our entire 3 week stay.",

We\u2019ll be headed to Kinosaki (also staying at Nishimuraya Shogetsutei) next week, though while we were planning, we were going back and forth about whether or not the 5.5 hour train ride back to Tokyo was worth going out that far to Kinosaki. Sounds like it will be!",

There are a few things to do in Kinosaki that we missed out on: especially the tram ride. Next to our hotel was a sky tram that takes you above the town and it looked awesome.

However the town let you rent umbrellas and it was great to take hot baths around town in between the rainy weather and drink milk and sit in massage chairs. \n\nWe highly recommend 2 full days at least to enjoy yourselves slowly. We did the ropeway yesterday and it was windy and rain. There were periods where the rain clouds was pushed to the side and the sun came in and the entire town just lit up and looked so nice. Highly worth it!",

Would you have considered a place a bit cheaper to have a better dinner instead?\n\nNot having the other experience of the Ryokan makes it a bit difficult to judge, but I would say we thought the experience was worth the money. In my opinion, the dinner for us was not worth adding on. We value the breakfast so highly because we find it difficult to find a nice breakfast in Japan (in the style that we enjoy). As for why we thought it was so good, I'd say the ambiance and the service were worth it. I'm sure other ryokan also offer similar style and \"feel\", but we just wanted to experience an expensive one for once, since we never do it. I genuinely felt like EVERY step of the way in the ryokan was meant to be an elevated experience (not to sound pretentious..). The next ryokan we go to will be a two day stay, but we definitely won't be dropping \\~$400 a night for it. Normally for us, we try to stay at less than $160 a night or so when traveling (if even that)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You did not mention anything, but did you do any of the public bath in Kinosaki?\n\nEven though it's a normal thing here, both my wife and I are not very interested in public bathing. We didn't grow up with the experience and aren't comfortable with it, sorry I can't provide any insight into how it was at our location =/",

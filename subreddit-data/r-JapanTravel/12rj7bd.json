    "postText": "I live in Kyushu and my family is coming to visit me at the end of May. I\u2019m trying to build a good itinerary based on what they\u2019ve asked to see but I am just as much a tourist in Honshu so was hoping for some comments / recommendations on the Kyoto portion of our itinerary. My family is mostly interested in Japanese history, architecture, and food so the itinerary is very focused on that (and also collecting goshuin lol) Any recommendations for activities / experiences are welcome! I speak Japanese decently well and am comfortable interpreting.\n\nDay 1 - Kyoto (Wednesday)\n\nMeet family at Kyoto station around 11, get lunch in the station and drop bags off at the hotel\n\n* Head to Ginkakuji stopping for dessert / tea at one of the shops nearby\n* Walk along the philosophers path (stopping at Honen-in, Eikando, Shinnyodo Nanzen-ji and Heian Jingu) \n* 4-5 check into the hotel - rest before dinner\n* Get dinner in the Pontocho and bar hop in the Pontocho area (saw some restaurants on tabelog and was thinking about reserving something on there. If anyone has recommendations for good inexpensive dinner spots  (around 2000-3000 yen per person) please let me know!\n\nDay 2 - Kyoto (Thursday)\n\n* Eat an early breakfast at the hotel and head to Kiyomizu-dera\n* Shoot to arrive at Kiyomizu around 7:30 - walk around the temple and the shopping area around the temple\n* Head to the Ninenzaka Starbucks (around 8:30 - 9)\n* Afterward start walking toward Nishiki Market stopping at various temples along the way (ex Hokan-ji, Yasaka Koshindo, and Kennin-ji)\n\n12:00 \u98df\u3079\u6b69\u304d lunch and shopping at Nishiki Market\n\n2:30 / 3ish - Monkey park\n\n* Togetsukyo bridge\n* Tenryuji \n* Maybe bamboo grove depending on time / how crowded it is\n\n(Around 5:00 head back into Kyoto for dinner)\n\nDay 3 - Kinosaki Onsen (Friday)\n\nThis day we\u2019re planning to get up early and head to Kinosaki where we have a reservation at a ryokan. Any recommendations for lunch? I know Kinosaki is famous for crab, but we'll just miss the crab season in May\u2026\n\nDay 4 - Kyoto (Saturday)\n\nWe\u2019re heading back to Kyoto to get back on the Shinkansen line - we will likely arrive around 1 o\u2019clock and will have another half-day to spend in Kyoto. Does anyone have any recommendations for must-sees in Kyoto? I am a bit worried about crowds since this is a weekend day. We\u2019re getting up early the next morning to head to Hiroshima, so I also don\u2019t want to do anything too far out of Kyoto.\n\nAlso! If anyone knows of any good Japanese whisky bars / experiences in the Kyoto area, please let me know. I heard there is a distillery somewhat closer to Osaka but it\u2019s a little bit off our path. \n\nAny restaurant recommendations are also appreciated! Thank you!",

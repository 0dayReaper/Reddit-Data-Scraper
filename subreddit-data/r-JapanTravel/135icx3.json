    "postText": "Hi everyone! We are finishing planning our Japan trip for June and we booked flights to Okinawa from June 21 to June 25 to enjoy some wonderful beaches and sea.  We are thinking of spending those days on Zamami island, since from what we are seeing it's gorgeous and easy to explore on foot (would prefer not to rent a car). We don't dive, but would enjoy some easy snorkeling and swims.\n\nWe read that in Okinawa there is jellyfish and poisonous snake problem and wild beaches are to be avoided - is this true also for Zamami Island? On another thread we read a redditer actually advices to visit desert beaches for snorkeling. Are we going to be safe anywhere or do you have safe beaches to recommend?\n\nDo you think we would be missing something special in Okinawa Island if we spend the whole stay on Zamami Island? Should we dedicate a couple days to the main island and visit a beach there?\n\nFinally, is Zamami Island super easy to navigate by bus and walking, or should be find our accommodation near the recommended beaches? We are trying to travel on a budget, we don't need anything fancy, just a cozy place from where we can easily reach nice beaches and hiking trails and where we can find food nearby.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for any advice!",

Herds of goats cluttered the roads managed by municipal workers. Slowly. Sea turtles can't read the signs prohibiting human-amphibian interaction so you have to swerve around them.\n\nNever saw any snakey things there but I visited in winter when they're sleeping.\n\nFood choices at the port were few but proprietors friendly and food authentic and awesome.",

(I'm a big fan of Kerama Islands.)\n\nIf you are into snorkeling (and if you can change your flight), also consider Miyako Island. Though better to have a car there, too, some beaches are accessible without a car.",

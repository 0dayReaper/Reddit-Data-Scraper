    "postText": "Hi JT. \n\nWell I'm depressed. Back home. Here. In England with the rain, inefficiency, rudeness, filth, shit trains, shit food and shitty people. Cold. Wet. Miserable. But at least I have my time in Japan to fondly think back on. \n\nI don't need to tell you how amazing Japan is, and I don't want to give a blow by blow, bite by bite report of my trip, because that's boring and will make me cry. \n\nSo here's a few thoughts, observations, tips, tricks and things I'd do different next time. \n\nFirst, thank you all. This sub is a great resource for planning. \n\nBut you do need to plan. We had 3 countries, 5 planes, 9 hotels, 3 cities, 3 Tokyo districts, many trains, taxis and one car to organise. For our 3 week trip, our itinerary spreadsheet was a monster. \n\n    Tip 1: Plan well. \n\nPlan far ahead of time, and triple check everything. \n\nAstonishingly, despite the complexity of our trip, everything went perfectly. I put that down to the impeccable organisation skills of my wife, and the reliability of everything and everyone in Japan.\n\nSo Japan. Everything is better. Where do I start? How about with the toilets. Butt blasters, butt dryers, \"privacy\" buttons, auto seat lift, auto flush, heated, auto clean. Parking my ass on the throne at the airport after landing changed my life. I could have gone home then and felt like the rest of the world was far, far behind. But it just got better. \n\nTalking of shit, let's get the bad things out of the way first. \n\nNo. Fucking. Bins. You will find yourself carrying trash around looking for a bastard bin all the damn time. Vending machines usually have bins, but they are only for plastic bottles and cans. Don't use them for your other crap. This may explain why the streets are spotless. The Japanese have learned to not bother buying anything that has to be thrown away after use, so they don't. \n\nThe amount of walking. It isn't a bad thing, but something to be aware of. You will walk a lot if you want to see Japan at its best. According to our phones we averaged 9 miles a day. \n\n    Tip 2: Bring comfy shoes. Pack light. \n\nSmoking. I didn't realize that smoking in bars and restaurants is still allowed. Most restaurants are smoke free, but some did have a smoking section. It seemed bars are hit and miss. We had to leave one because it became unbearable. And we stank for days. For such a clean country, we didn't expect smoking to be so prevalent indoors. \n\nFancy food. Honestly, we were disappointed by all the fancy food we ate. We went to a 3 Michelin star restaurant, a Team Lab dinner experience, a posh ryokan and a fancy dinner at our last hotel. These were $200 a head dinners minimum. All were a disappointment. We are big foodies. It was our honeymoon, so these were some big, special dinners. But none impressed. \n\nFor example the 3* place was a bit bland. Maybe it is down to us not really appreciating traditional Japanese flavors, but on reflection it was more than that. We sat at a food bar, so we were expecting food prepared in front of us. Mastery on display. Beautiful presentation. Exceptional, interesting flavors. But... it was all very samey. Flavors were predominantly umami. Food was prepared in the back room. Drinks were stingy. Service was stilted. And the cost was astronomical. The experience was a bit of a let down. \n\nThen the TeamLab dinner was a joke. Almost as expensive as the 3* place, but food was often cold, badly flavored or really bland. It was cool with the digital projections interacting with every meal, but for the cost, the food should have been much, much better. And the staff more competent. They always just seemed flustered. It's not like the digital art show was a live performance. The software is pretty simple and could do with an update TBH. \n\nThe ryokan and the last posh meal both served their take on \"traditional\" Japanese cuisine. But again, it was samey, a little too formal, a little too stilted, a little too *umami*. I've never eaten so much mushroom, mackerel, walnut and abalone (massive sea snails).\n\nI know it is just our experience. Maybe it was bad luck, and I know it's blasphemy, but the best high-end food I've ever had is still in the UK. London. Cumbria. Manchester. I suppose we're not restricted by tradition or cultural expectation. \n\n    Tip 3: don't bother with expensive posh meals. \n\nCheap and medium priced places were so consistently amazing, they highlighted just how much of a waste of money it was eating posh. The best meal we had was A5 Wyagu cooked to perfection with great complimentary side dishes. But this was at a relatively cheap place found on Google maps, because it was nearby, had a 4.2 and we fancied beef. \n\n    Tip 4: Get food on the fly.\n\nUse our tried and tested method: \n\n&gt; 1. Pick what you fancy. \n&gt; 2. Search google for a place that specializes in just that food. \n&gt; 3. Walk your ass to anything rated 4 or above (there will be many). \n&gt; 4. Eat. \n&gt; 5. Smile.  \n\nMy god the food. I've never had so many \"holy shit\" moments putting things in my mouth as I did in Japan. Even things you'd think would be a bit crap amazed. The Japanese are so damn good that when they specialize, they really really perform. Avoid anything obviously touristy and you will be amazed. From conbini sandos to Mos burger. From ramen to cold soba noodles. From bread to pancakes. From sashimi to steak. Good god they know how to cook. Take a risk. Walk into a place with only 5 seats, a Japanese only menu, and a million year old dude behind the counter. Look confused and lost, and he will make you the meal of a lifetime. Be thankful. Bow. Smile. \n\nAnd the drinks. Wow. Bars in Japan were different to what I expected. Nearly every bar was a tiny room hidden on the 6th floor of some office block with 8 seats at the bar and a master dinksmith wielding the cocktail shaker behind. Never before have I had drinks so unique and customized to my tastes. And they were no more expensive than a mediocre bar in the UK. A great experience. \n\n    Tip 5: Look up. \n\nSee the dodgy looking signs and take a chance. Do yourself a favor, and go be the only person in a bar. Just try and avoid the smoking bars. \n\nTransport. In Japan it is good and bad. We arrived 5 minutes too late at the airport station to pick up our JR passes, so had to work out the Narita Express jet-lagged and confused. This was our first interaction with Tokyo's rail system and it was a head scratcher. But it was also our first interaction with the helpful, friendly, personable Japanese people. We got on the train not realizing we also had to book seats. But rather than tell us to bugger off, like in the UK, the conductor walked us to the machine, showed us what to press, where to put our money, and walked us back to our newly booked seats. So helpful. \n\n    Tip 6: use Google Maps for trains. \n\nIt tells you the operator, platform, line, colour, what car to get on, how busy its going to be and all the stops to expect on the way. It quickly became second nature to check google maps. Pick the best JR route (so we could use our passes) and get on the right train. \n\nTaxis were a little different. Uber was good, but for the places we stayed it was only posh Uber (Uber Exec here) at around $25 for a quick 15 min ride. Expensive so we only used it when the wife was wearing heels and looking pretty. The cars were very nice and the drivers didn't talk. At all. It was bliss. But other taxis were a bit hit and miss with a few... idiosyncrasies.  \n\n    Tip 7: only use taxis if you have to. \n\nKyoto taxi drivers don't know where they are going even if they have the address in Japanese and a map. Uber is expensive. Wait for them to open the door (it will be automatic in most cases). Walk or train if you can. \n\nWe also hired a car. A Porsche 911 for our trip from Tokyo to Hakone. A mixed experience. I'm super comfortable driving on foreign roads and with foreign cars. I do it every trip I do wherever, because driving is always fun and different. I can see how it stresses a lot of people out though. But that moment when we passed the bus, the twisty mountain road was clear, the sun was setting, Fuji-san loomed in the distance, and that right foot met carpet, the flat six howled, the wife squealed... Its a drive I'm never going to forget. 20 minutes of one of the best moments I've ever experienced. \n\nBut to get there we had to fight through Tokyo's traffic, Google maps idiocy, and so. Many. Fucking. Tolls. You gotta pay the toll troll. A 2 hour journey cost about $50 in tolls! Fuel was cheaper. \n\nTalking of fuel. The gas station was the only place my credit card was not accepted. Weird. But everywhere else I tried it was fine. But the Japanese do love their cash. We were aware of this so brought lots with us. It feels like one of the few things they are behind the rest of the world with, but so many of their tills, vending machines and systems are set up to accept cash in an automated and efficient way, I can see why it is still so prevalent. \n\n    Tip 8: Bring lots of cash. \n\nAnd a change purse. You will be carrying a lot of fucking coins with you. My left jeans pocket still seems weirdly light now I'm back to card everywhere. \n\nI have to make special mention to just how clean everything is. How well maintained and how well run everything is. And just how nice everyone is. This is down to respect for your fellow man. Something I think we in the West have forgotten. Not a single bit of graffiti, trash or vandalism was seen in all 3 weeks. Trains were clean, beautifully maintained and so damn reliable. Every city street, no matter how tiny, dark or seedy looking, was safe and clean. I never felt uneasy or unsafe. Homelessness was practically non-existent. \n\nAnd even the worst type of human in the world - the cyclist ;) - was courteous, respectful and careful. Unlike the UK, where pedestrians are mowed down by the thousands by spandex clad accountants called Gavin on \u00a33000 racing bikes fueled by pure emasculation before blasting through the red light so he can post the collision on youtube to perpetuate the anger with his cycling buddies, pedestrians are treated with respect in Japan. A cyclist in Japan may ride on the pavement, but they have no delusions that they're in the Tour de France. They wear normal clothes. The bikes are functional. They travel at sensible speeds. They avoid pedestrians rather than try and move them with abuse and bell pings. Bliss. \n\nSorry. Bit of a sore subject. But...\n\n    Tip 9: Be respectful back.\n\nThe Japanese are, without exception, lovely people. Be lovely back. Try and learn how to say thank you. Bow. Smile. Follow their customs. Be quiet. Give up your train seat to the old lady. Don't tip. Don't be obnoxious. Be polite. Clean up after yourself. And then carry on doing those things when you get home. \n\nWe went at a great time of the year (Oct / Nov). During our three weeks we only had two half days of rain. It was warm but not too hot. The nights were comfortable. And the trees were turning. It was Halloween and we went to Disney Sea and experienced the madness in Shinjuku on the 31st. \n\n    Tip 10: Go at Halloween. \n\nThe Japanese take dressing up seriously. And, despite the business and the madness, you will have a great time. All through October Disney Sea allows cosplay, and so many people did an amazing job. It was surreal having beers with three different Disney princesses at the bar in the Teddy Roosevelt Lounge. \n\nWe moved around a lot because we wanted to see as much as possible. With did 3 different provinces of Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Hakone. You should do the same.\n\n    Tip 11: Don't stay in one place. \n\nWe stayed in a mix of super cheap all the way to super expensive hotels. The cheap room was literally just big enough for the bed, a toilet and a tiny shower for skinny people. Our biggest was as an annex at a ryokan with its own private hot spring bath overlooking the mountains. That was 10x the cost of the first room, and one of the most special places I've ever visited in my life. But experiencing that space was the point. \n\nFor everywhere else, I'd say treat the rooms as a bed, a shower and a place to store your crap. You won't be in the room long enough to appreciate much more. When we go back, with the exception of the ryokan, we will be staying in functional rooms picked for location rather than poshness. \n\n    Tip 12: Get a cheap hotel in a good location.\n\nHotels in Japan are weird. No room service (unless very posh), very few had bars, not one had an iron in a room,  but most had a communal area with vending machines, toiletries and free coffee. They will all check your passport. Cleaning is often optional. Or even charged.\n\nWe lucked out. Our hotels in Osaka and Kyoto were right in the action. A note on Kyoto. It is probably my favorite place on the planet. There are tiny, traditional, beautiful streets woven between the ultra modern with the best little bars, restaurants and girls in kimonos walking around. It was what I imagined Japan to be like. And walking around the city felt like I was in an anime. Just beautiful. Osaka, on the other hand, felt like what I imagined Tokyo to be like. Lights, madness, noise, crazy advertising everywhere. Neon. Animatronics. Food. Smell. Bustle. Perfect. And 13 minutes from Kyoto by bullet train. \n\n    Tip 13: Ride the Shinkansen. \n\nIt is an experience not to be missed. Don't bother with Green Car. Regular slum class is spacious, clean and comfortable. Slamming through the Japanese countryside at 300 mph with Fuji in one window and the sea in the other was an incredible experience. It is so smooth and...\n\n    Tip 14: Get a bento box at the station.\n\nGet there 45 mins early and browse the vast selection. Buy an Asahi. Buy a sando. Buy a posh bento. And have the best travel food ever. How do they do it? How does Tesco charge \u00a35 for a meal deal of stale bread sandwich, \"filled\" with micrometer thin ham and soggy lettuce when Japan can create bentos with self warming rice, fresh, interesting ingredients and amazingly cooked meats? \n\n    Tip 15: Do the touristy things. But turn left. \n\nWe did loads of toruisty things. Shinjuku crossing, Takeshita street, Nara, Disney Sea, TeamLab, Robot Cafe, etc. And they were all worth it. And at plenty of places, if you just ducked down a side alley, or wandered off the main tourist path, you'd find yourself alone on an interesting street or a calm, peaceful forest. Some of our favorite discoveries happened this way. Explore. Get lost. You have google maps to get you back on track. So see what is just to the left of all the tourist spots and you will be super rewarded. At Nara we found a park bench near just one other guy playing guitar, a huge lake before us, the sun high in the sky and no loud American tourists squealing at the deer. It was magical. \n\n    Tip 16: Embrace the weird. \n\nJapan is not the West. Their culture has evolved independently of our influences for a long time. There is a lot of strangeness in Japan, so expect to be... surprised. Be it a small girl dressed as a maid trying to tempt you into a cafe, all the interesting \"art\" in the upper floors of shops in Akihabara, the women only carriages of trains, the occasional squatting toilet, the swastikas (Buddhist symbol), the sometimes extreme politeness, the fashion, the cute signs for everything, the mascots, the good luck charms with massive balls, the vending machines, the capsule toys, the cosplay, the host/hostess bars, their fondness for the Kawaii, their love of youth, their advertising, or their sometimes spectacular hair, respect it, enjoy it, and embrace it. You will have a lot of fun. \n\nI'm probably going to hit the post character limit, so I will stop now, but I'm sure to edit this more as things come to me. \n\nIf you are going soon then I hate you because I am so so jealous. But have an amazing time. It is almost impossible not to.\n\n---\n\nHotels (in Japan - we also did London and Shanghai):\n\n*Tokyo:*\n\nHotel Tavinos Hamamatsucho - Tiny room. Cheap. OK location.\n\nShinjuku Granbell Hotel - Massive room. Middling cost. Amazing location.\n\nHoshinoya Ginza(ish) - Beautiful city ryokan. OK location.\n\n*Kyoto:*\n\nHotel Resol Kyoto Kawaramachi Sanjo - Great little room. Perfect location.\n\n*Osaka:*\n\nHOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi - Really nice hotel. Amazing location.\n\n*Hakone:*\n\nG\u00f4ra Kadan - Just magical. Very expensive ryokan in the mountains.",

I have an Alpha JX bidet - tankless hot water, dryer, heated seat, sittable lid, LED lit, etc. It was about $300 and only needs a splitter on the water line to the tank (no sink connection) and a plug that I ran over to the only outlet near my sink.  No need to hardwire or do anything you can't revert when you move out. It takes about 20 minutes to install and replaces your existing seat.",

You can do that with a shit webcam. This isn't exactly facial recognition level shape matching or even mobile phone level AR.

The whole thing looks super boring like you'd be interested for a few minutes in the first exhibit but then bored out or your mind through the rest of the museum. That's just my opinion, and I'm sure the people who put the interactives together and stuff worked really hard, but it was a waste of time in my eyes \ud83e\udd37",

I specifically look forward to that element of the trip. Smoking-only bars tend to have more local characters in them, maybe thats the part I like.",

Glad you had a smashing time, and I'm pretty sure you're hankering on some konbini sushi right now hahaha.\n\nAgree on almost all of the things here, and +1 on the bentos (seriously, get one of those lunch boxes with dividers in them; those alone will level up the usual sad packed lunches) ,\"look up\" and \"turn left\" parts. And not to be a dick, but the higher-end Japanese food really requires a clean sinus or a lot of experience in tasting the good stuff. First time I was in Japan, my tropical arse got a damn cold and I can barely smell anything. The saving grace was that I was in Osaka, and Dotonbori has this... smell that you will never forget. So yeah, quit the cigarettes for a while before heading back, leave all expectations at the door, and take your time eating the fancy-pants sushi/sashimi to appreciate the ingredients.\n\nIn the meantime, go find katsuoboshi (those thin fish flakes on top of takoyaki or oyonomiyaki) then use them as toppings on a freshly-cooked plate of fish and chips with a cold beer on the side - that's how I scratched my itch until I got back. Next best bet would be Japanese curry; even the common ones are delicious!",

Strip away all the pomp, snobbery, pretentious faff and bullshit please. I don't care. Fancy foods done well should nail taste first. Only when you get that right should you sprinkle the garnish of all that other bollocks for the \"experience\". \n\nYou can hand me a dish with all the posh, expensive, beautifully prepared ingredients you want on it, but if it doesn't taste good then you have failed. \n\nIf you put together a set menu then make sure the flavors differ between dishes. Take the pallet on a journey. I'd say each failed in that respect.",

That's why I said one needs a clean sinus - it's important because most of taste is actually smell. That's why everything is bland if you have a cold. That's not snobbery, that's plain physiology.\n\nNow if anything Japanese cuisine - especially the fish dishes - can indeed be on the subtle side, I'll give you that. I can't quite differentiate one tuna from another TBH, assuming you use the same cut. Otoro (fatty) tuna is another thing altogether though chef-kiss.gif",

He takes you on a journey, and links foraging/forest to plate theory quite strongly in his dishes.

There *are* bins - in every train station, outside or inside near the entrance of every convenience store, *somewhere* in most public parks, next to vending machines.\n\nI guess you if you buy every meal to-go and then eat it as you walk somewhere (technically already a bit of a faux pas in Japan), then you'll have the wrappers, but if you go to a train station or pass a combini on the way, there's a place to dispose of it.\n\nHow do you get so much garbage throughout the day??",

Throwing out a can or cup is the same. As long as it's not a *huge amount*, nobody will notice. That's why many times, the garbage cans are *outside.*",

OK location.  \n\nKyoto:\n\n**Hotel Resol Kyoto Kawaramachi Sanjo** - Great little room. Perfect location. \n\nOsaka:\n\n**HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi** - Really nice hotel.

All Japan Rail Pass from Jun 1 will be able to use the automatic ticket gate. I believe that this also allow reserving seat at the ticket machine too, but that is not clear.\n2. The new service, online seat reservation before voucher exchange, is only available with passes bought from the new online service. Exchange order bought from travel agency aren't eligible.\n3. You cannot reserve seats on multiple trains that have overlapping time or physically impossible connection.\n4. You still need to exchange for the actual pass at the ticket office.",

With Shinkansen running so frequently (especially the Tokaido line) you have much more flexibility to just show up and take the next non-reserved car without having to rush to meet your reservation. And I've never had a problem finding a seat in the non-reserved cars (in fact I usually get an empty seat beside me).",

There were a few times my friend and I were split for a bit because there was no two seats empty.  Also, you avoid the mass rush to find empty seats when you get in.\n\nIf you know approximately when you want to leave or arrive at a certain place, getting reservations is a no brainer.  Just makes things simpler.",

I usually never reserved seats for my wife and I but my friends are not great about getting around in a timely fashion so I made sure to book seats in advance for the main legs where we were taking luggage just to make sure they HAD to get up early and get there on time with us. Also just to make sure we could find a shinkansen with enough seats. I felt bad getting off and on the shinkansen because a few of them had like 2 large rolling bags each while my wife and I make do with 1 each (mine on the small side even).",

I did so in haste, so I asked a stranger whether this train stopped at Hiroshima (not before I misspoke and said \"Hokkaido\"). He said that it didn't, and as we got off at Shin-Osaka, he kindly pointed-out the Shinkansen across the platform going to Hiroshima (which I had already confirmed was the right one via Google Maps). I boarded an unreserved car.\n\nI found an aisle seat (this carriage did end up being standing-room only IIRC), sat through the announcements, only to hear a robotic American voice say something like \"this train is not for passenger with JR pass\". I quickly got up and sidled my way through the standing passengers whilst repeating \"suimasen, suimasen\" only to find that the door was shut and the train had just started moving. \"Shikata nai,\" I said to the people I now had to squeeze pass again.\n\nFortunately that Shinkansen stopped at Shin-Kobe next, so I got out and asked a gate attendant which one I should catch. Ended up catching a Sakura.\n\nSo lesson learned with regards to which services one can catch on a JR pass, but regardless, I think I see your point.\n\nI'm in Kyoto again now and will probably reserve a seat to Tokyo tomorrow, but mainly to get a window seat so I can see Mount Fuji a second time.",

Other countries can't write to the chip. So JR West can check the nationality, but I don't think they can check the temporary visitor status. I think they just take the customer's word for it. With JR East, you can buy the JR TOKYO Wide Pass (that doesn't require temporary visitor) online on a Chinese website and obtain it from a machine. But JR East's other passes that require a temporary visitor status cannot be obtained from a machine, must be obtained from staff. I think this explains it.",

We saved over 15k yen on train fare doing that itinerary on a one week pass. You can make it even easier if you can split your inbound and outbound flights between Kansai International and Narita (unfortunately last time we went it would have cost a lot more for us to do this). The pass isn't really worth it in Tokyo though. You'll never get much value out of it riding the Yamanote line and a lot of the time the subway is quicker, especially if you're trying to get to the opposite side of the city. If I was in Tokyo with a pass I'd use it, but I wouldn't try to plan to have it while I was in Tokyo.

If all you're doing is staying around Tokyo? No it isn't that good, in fact it's a terrible waste of money. If you're taking the shinkansen across the country and back? It represents a significant saving. On our last trip we went Tokyo to Osaka, Osaka to Hiroshima, Hiroshima to Osaka, and Osaka to Hakone on a one week pass. More than likely no extra cost? It would have cost us approximately an extra 15,000 yen. And that's without considering the return trip to Kyoto we did (which we could take the shinkansen for rather than the cheaper rapid service) or the ferry to Miyajima, and I'm sure there's something else I've forgotten that we used it for. Not to mention that it gave us the flexibility to just go on a day trip out of whatever city we were in without worrying about blowing a fortune on train fares.\n\nIt isn't for everyone and I heavily disagree with people making blanket recommendations for it, which I've seen fairly often on this sub. But I also disagree with making a blanket disapproval of it. At the end of the day it's a tool. It's as good as the use you make out of it. If you know where you're going to travel and when and the price of the individual tickets works out as about the same (if the JR pass is only slightly more expensive it's still worth it for the flexibility and convenience it offers) or more then the pass is good for you. If the individual tickets cost significantly less it isn't.\n\nUltimately it's always going to be down to the individual traveller whether the pass is good or not.",

In total it probably would have cost about 122,000 yen but I only paid around the equivalent of 49,000 yen. The day trip to Osaka from Tokyo was only really possible because we had the rail pass, without it would have cost us almost 30,000 yen each.",

It's not a ticketless service --- you still need to collect your seat reservation ticket even if you reserve online.\n\nWhat was not clear (from the Japanese press release) was that whether the online reservation is available during the entire pass period or just before the exchange. And it was also not clear whether you can use the pass to reserve seat at the seat reservation machine.\n\nMy rough guess (based on how it works for standard ticket service right now), is that you would be able to book online all the time, but you still need to collect the reserved ticket at the ticket machine. You can also make a reservation using the reserved seat ticket machine (buy first inserting your rail pass).\n\n&gt;In other words, no more standing in line at the midori-no-madoguchi for reservations like ordinary domestic peons- just click and go?\n\nThere are already service for that --- it's called Smart EX. Unfortunately in many cases it's more expensive using Smart EX than buying ticket individually. Note that most of the people lining up are actually buying something that is more complex than just A to B ticket --- otherwise the ticket machine is absolutely fine.\n\nAlso, JR cannot really make it more convenient for tourist than Japanese --- Japan Rail Pass is already quite a topic of complaint from Japanese.",

Not of course that they are rude or unwelcoming, but they seem never to have grasped the premise that tourism is functionally free money, and among the simplest methods to improve a trade imbalance on the planet because of course historically they have always had that independent mindset.",

This is the existential portion I feel most Japanese residents don't understand- these sorts of unlimited passes encourage tourists to roam off the beaten path and visit more than just Tokyo, Kyoto and Hiroshima.  The same goes for Eurail passes as well- those benefits accrue and trickle down to more than just the big cities and urban travelers.",

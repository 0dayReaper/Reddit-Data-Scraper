You will easily clear 10k steps a day. It's not a bad thing- you'll be walking off a *lot* of delicious food, and you'll be walking in some seriously beautiful places. But you will be walking.",

You're talking about being on the northwest corner of Kyoto and then going to far off Nara, which is an entirely different city to the south of Kyoto.\n\nArashiyama is lovely and one could easily spend a whole day there touring its temples and shrines (with a lot of walking...). But if all you're interested in is the bamboo grove, I would skip it entirely and just spend the day in Nara, which is definitely worth a visit. Kodaiji in Higashiyama is beautiful and has a nice bamboo grove, and while it is a popular site it's nowhere near as crowded as Arashiyama's. You could easily fit Kodaiji into your plan for May 15th. Alternatively spend more time in Arashiyama, visit the nearby monkey park and some of the nicer temples in the area like Tenryuji and Gioji. I would recommend Otagi Nenbutsu as well but if you guys hate walking well... it's a significant hike to get there.",

These are both huge cities. In both Tokyo and Kyoto, it can take over an hour to get from one end of the city to another.\n\nIf traveling to Kyoto is set in stone, then I highly recommend you both sit down with Google Maps for an hour and map out your current itinerary with their transit function. You need to see exactly how long it\u2019s going to take to get from Point A to Point B on each of your days, because I think you\u2019ll be surprised at just how far apart some of these things are from each other, even with Japan\u2019s robust public transit. Where you\u2019re staying in each city will also have a large effect on this.  \n\nAs others have said, be prepared for a LOT of walking. I love walking and have a lot of stamina for it, and I was dead by the end of my trip. There were some days we did 10 miles. If this doesn\u2019t sound appealing to you or your wife, you probably need to look at cutting about a third of your itinerary so you can go at a slower pace. This current pace will have you sprinting across both cities.",

It has so much history and incredible temples. Get lunch at Higashimuki shopping street. Go to Todaiji.\n\nWhen I went last I actually stopped at Fushimi Inari on the way home from Nara too. It was a different experience at night. Everything is lit up and it's super empty. It gives off a very mystical vibe. Highly recommend!",

Even with a reservation you will be waiting for a long time. Make it a flexible item on another day or consider visiting another Kaiten Sushi chain.\n\nMay 12)\n\nAllocate some time for Odaiba (Diver City), there is a lot of cool stuff around there. Check if something is going on at Big Sight on your date.\n\nI\u2019m not a Kyoto expert but May 14 seems crazy: Two spots in Kyoto then off to Nara - doing the whole tour - then back to Kyoto for Ramen.\n\nSame goes for May 15/16. Your itinerary generally is way too tight for my personal liking. You need to factor in time for waiting for a train, sitting on the train, standing in line, walking around (It will be a lot), being a little lost, strolling/checking things out, resting, eating. \n\nAnd my recommendation to everyone: Don\u2019t plan your day around restaurants you see on instagram. &amp; co. You will end up waiting crazy times to eat things that are probably delicious but very overpriced. Japanese have a much larger tolerance for waiting than most westerners. E.g. My former flatmate waited 4 hours for a new burger shop and he usually didn\u2019t even eat fancy food! There are a lot of other places that are just as good, with cool instagramable gimmicks, with better prices, and much less waiting time.",

You may want to look into visiting it, as I'm sure it would be an amazing experience. Or if not, you should be aware that roads will be blocked off and the areas where the parade and general festivities are taking place will be very busy.",

Sunshine city also has that huge pokemon center and other character shops!",

You guys should just go on a cruise in that case lol. \nOverall though I think the wife made some great plans, you will cut back here and there but at least you have good plans. I would highly recommend taking daily walks at home for an hour at a time and then several hours on weekends to prepare both physically and mentally and also to find the best walking shoes to bring.",

            "comment": "For Akihabara, you might want to consider the timing more. Not much is really open before 11 AM, and also most of the stores close at 8 PM there, so it's more appropriate maybe for an afternoon to late afternoon trip, but there's nothing there early morning and later at night. \n\nKura Sushi is nothing to write home about, but it's decent if there's no line and you like the cheese-topped sushi. But there will often be lines during lunch time, so if you find another sushi place that has no lines, just enter that one rather than Kura... \n\nAlso, in Shibuya, the same place as the Jump shop is a Pok\u00e9mon Center, Capcom Store, and Nintendo Store FYI.\n\nFor Gundam Base, IDK if this is a daily occurrence, but when I went last week, I had to go to the place, grab a timed entry ticket, and wait for 4 hours before I can enter... maybe it's better now since Golden Week has passed, though. It's only worth it if you are specifically a Gunpla fan, though, as it is basically just a very large Gunpla store with some exclusive items in stock.\n\nIf you don't care specifically about certain exclusive Gunplas, then the Gundam Factory in Yokohama is actually more impressive. The Gundam actually can move. It also has a store selling some exclusive Gunpla and merch, though the variety is more limited than Gundam Base.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m traveling solo starting June 25 and want to take the long way from Tokyo to Osaka via the Alps so I can do some hiking and visit some onsens and see a different part of Japan. Here\u2019s what I am planning \u2014 the feedback has been great so far and I apologize that my post keeps getting deleted by the moderators. Hopefully this is more descriptive. \n\nDay 1-2: Tokyo\nStay in Shinjuku (have been to Tokyo before). Some of the usual sites and great food while I start to acclimate. \n\nDay 3: Matsumoto by train \nExplore the castle. Overnight at Guesthouse Raicho. \n\nDay 4: Kamikochi and onsen (Hirayu no mori)\nVisit sights in Kamikochi then train to Hirayu onsen to overnight at a ryokan (still researching which one)\n\nDay 5: Takayama\nArrive in morning. Visit the cobblestoned streets lined with charming old wooden houses with small shops, cafes, and restaurants. \nStay in Yamakyu ryokan \n\nDay 6: Alpine route Omachi to Toyama \nFull day with luggage forwarding on the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route via buses, trolleys, cable cars, and ropeways.\n\nDay 7-8 Kanazawa\nKanazawa Castle and the old historical castle garden Kenroku-en Japanese Garden. Geisha district. Stay in Korinbo area at Shaq Bighouse. \n\nDay 9: Nakasendo trail\u2014 Magome \n(Nakatsugawa train station) to Tsumago (Nagiso train station) hike, then Magome bus return. Will start early in day. Overnight Nagoya or Osaka? Is this trail worth it? \n\nDay 10-11: Osaka\nCastle, Dotonburi, etc. Have been previously but only for quick trips from Kyoto. Will head to Fuji after.\n\nDay 12-14: Mt Fuji climb\nFirst night stay in Kawaguchiko to prepare for the climb. Stay at K's House Fuji View. Overnight hike and stay in hit. Descend and head to Tokyo. Should be open in early July. \n\nDay 15: Tokyo\nFinal day and fly home",

Then Nakasendo to Osaka is a goof 4 hours and 6 hours going back from Osaka to Kawaguchiko. You're going to be spending half of your time just getting from point A to point B.",

Only difference is mine starts next week!\n\nYour routing during the Nagano/Toyama prefecture looks to be a little rough around the edges, they don't seem to connect that well together.\n\nLet me share what's mine:\n\nDay 1 - 2: Tokyo\n\nDay 3: Matsumoto / Azumino\n\nDay 4 - 5: Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route via Omachi (1st night in Murodo, 2nd night at Takaoka)\n\nDay 6: Shirakawa-go / Takayama\n\nDay 7 - 8: Kamikochi (1st night in Karasawa, 2nd night at Matsumoto)\n\nDay 9 - 11: Nakasendo trail (Narai &gt; Nakatsugawa)\n\nDay 12: Nagoya / Hikone\n\nDay 13 - 15: Kyoto / Nara\n\nDay 16 - 18: Osaka / Kobe\n\nIt's quite tightly packed but I hope this helps you to plan yours out smoothly.\n\nHappy travels!\n\nEdit: Formatting",

Though I do see that ending the alps portion after the Nakasendo trail positions me better for Fuji rather than Osaka. I may have to decide if I do Osaka or focus on the Fuji climb. \nAldo: what places are you staying in on your trip?",

So I divided the trail into 3 equal portions and booked my accomodation at the end of each section.\nIn my case, I chose: 1) Fukushima-juku / 2) Nojiri-juku / 3) Nakatsugawa-juku",

I just filter using costs &amp; ratings, then I'll decide on the ones with better reviews/amenities.\n\nI like to plan ahead, so I booked mine as soon as I firmed up my itinerary. Which is about 3 months in advance. \n\nBetween the two, It boils down to what your interests lies in.\n1) If you want to immerse yourself in history and culture, I think the Nakasendo trail would be much more suited.\n2) If you want to experience nature and its the breathtaking views, then Mount Fuji would be the better choice.\n\nIn my opinion, since you're already intending to visit the Tateyama range and Kamikochi, why not hike on those mountains instead?",

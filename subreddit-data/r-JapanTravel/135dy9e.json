    "postText": "Day 1 - Landed at Narita and took the Narita Express to Asakusa Station. We stay in Asakusa for 4 days. Had Kura Sushi and did the necessary shopping for essentials at Donki. Donki is 24 hours at Asakusa Rox. We were exhausted and just wanted to get our stuff, eat a no hassle dinner, and try to get over the jet lag. \n\nDay 2 - Asakusa Kimono Rental at 10am. Walked around Sensoji Temple and Nakamisa and then returned the kimono around 1pm. Headed to Akihabara and walked around. Our legs and energy were pretty much sapped from Jetlag. Akihabara was fun and walked up and down. We had Tsukemen for Dinner. Highly Recomend: https://menya634.co.jp/storelist/akihabara/\n\nDay 3 - We started early and headed to Tsukiji Outer Market. We got there around 8:30 and it wasn't as busy. Once it got to 9:30 all the tour buses came in and the area got slammed.  Did have some wagyu skewers/Fresh Tuna/Torched Tuna Steak/Kaizen Don for breakfast. Headed over to Ginza to the hello kitty store, Uniqlo Ginza, Muji Ginza, and then Pokemon Center Tokyo DX. Note: This Pokemon Center didn't get restocked so the store was bare. Should be fine now.  Had very delicious but expensive Omurice at Taimeiken. The one you want is the tempopo beef omurice (3000 yen) it comes with a demiglaze.   https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1302/A130202/13252161/ Got some custom T shirts from Uniqlo and then headed back to Asakusa to have some Oyster Ramen. \n\nDay 4 - Shibuya - Went to Royal Host for breakfast in Asakusa. Was decent but kinda pricy. 2600 yen. We both had western breakfast though. Went to Shibuya Crossing and then Donki to look around before things opened up. Had Yakiniku Like for lunch. Spent some time walking around Shibuya until we had to get to our appointment for Shibuya Sky. There was a lot of line ups but the view is Amazing. FYI You take the elevator from the ground floor outside to the 14th floor and then you wait for your time on the 14th floor and then head up to the 45th or something floor. Stuff your stuff in a locker (Bring change) and then you head up an escalator to the observation deck. You can then roam around and there's the middle where the helipad is. Once you're done, Get your stuff and head to the \"exit\" which is a covered art installation towards the paradise bar and gift shop. Then you'll wait probably 20 minutes to take the elevator down to the 14th floor and then you have to find your way down to the ground floor some how. I think we had Sukiya that night. Shibuya on a Friday Night is CRAZY. \n\nWill type more out later.",

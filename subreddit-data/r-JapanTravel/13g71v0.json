    "postText": "Had some specific questions and hoping you all might be able to give some advice\n\n1. Looking to see a full night sky (all starts, galaxy, etc)---is that decently visible from Ishigaki? Looking at it on the map, it looked like it'd have too much light and drown out the sky (as compared to Iriomote-jima).\n2. As a follow up to #1--I was thinking of trying to camp in Iriomote-jima (for a potentially better night sky), however now sure if I can schedule that without being there? I found a couple camp sites, but all required reservations which seemed to be only able to be done over the phone. My Japanese has degraded over the years to barely beginner anymore so a phone call would be difficult at this point.\n3. How big is Iriomote-jima? Can you ride around it on a bike in a few hours?\n\nI'll be there (landing in Ishigaki airport) from 12Jun - 15Jun. I'm trying to pack as much in during this time as possible since I've got such a short trip. Any recommendations outside of the topics above are welcome and appreciated as well.",

I have been using my American Express travel concierge to book travel and restaurant reservations in Japan, but certain Visas offer travel concierge as well.\n\nI imagine it will be quite hot in June, will biking around be realistic? I am going to Ishigaki and Iriomote a couple weeks after you and the weather looks brutal \ud83d\ude09",

I'm ok with the heat as I've been a lot of much warmer places that didn't have an ocean breeze.\n\nWhat's the best way to get around the islands? I'm still planning but was looking to explore Iriomote more, but I also didn't want to miss fun things on Ishigaki as well. I just wish I had more time!",

I've done a camping trip in the boundary waters between Minnesota and Canada and there was good visibility so I'm excited to see how this compares. I suspect it's likely better just due to location being better removed from lights comparatively.",

It was cheap when we went, but we went during covid so now maybe more expensive. But back then we paid 6000\u00a5 a day including insurance for a small car.",

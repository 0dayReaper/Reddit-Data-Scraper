    "postText": "**Trip report from March 3-16, 2023 (14 days) | Tokyo (6) -&gt; Kyoto (6) -&gt; Tokyo (2)**\n\nHi everyone, I posted an [itinerary](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/10hwr77/revised_itinerary_14day_first_japan_trip_with_3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a while back. Big thank you to everyone who commented with your recommendations. It's now been over a month since I travelled to Japan, and I miss it a lot. Japan was amazing, and has to be my top country to visit. The culture, the people, the food all made it worthwhile. Now that I have time to reflect on the trip, I hope this report can help others on theirs :)\n\nQuick background - Three first-timers in Japan. Late 20's. Interested in Japan culture/experiences, anime, food, nature, shopping. Sibling is travelling from Canada two days earlier before myself and partner from Manila.\n\nPrep for the trip - I used SkyScanner and Google Flights to search for flights, and finalized the bookings through Expedia in order to garner points on my credit card. Accommodations were booked via Booking.com or Expedia depending whichever had a better deal. I read through countless Japan travel posts from Google reviews, Reddit, to Japan travel groups on Facebook to build my itinerary.\n\n**Day 1 (March 3, Friday) - Arrival to Tokyo**\n\n* NAIA to NRT airport. Landed at 8pm. Once we landed, I immediately logged into the airport Wifi to log into my Japan Web account to present the QR codes. Customs/baggage took a total of 30 mins. Went by fairly quick than we expected! Bought our Suica IC card.\n* Narita Keisei Skyliner - \u00a55140 for two people. There was a section to place our check-in luggage in. Ride was about 1.5 hours to reach our hotel in Akasaka. Arrived around 11pm and met up with my sibling.\n* [Hotel Asia Center of Japan](https://goo.gl/maps/nn7V8KuLqoLnVyAS8)\\- Breakfast vouchers were provided for our stay, and my gosh, the selection was delicious! There was a variety of Japanese food offered from katsu cutlet, taiyaki, yakisoba, miso soup, curry, and seriously so much more. Free water bottles and toiletries are available. Location is very central on the map, close to train stations and a 7-Eleven.\n\n**Day 2 (March 4, Saturday) - Odaiba &amp; Ginza, Tokyo**\n\n* [teamLab Planets](https://planets.teamlab.art/tokyo/) \\- Booked the 9-9:30am timeslot via website. We arrived at 9am, and as expected on the weekend, there was quite a bit of a line already. Luckily, it wasn't too long of a wait and we got in 30 mins later. We finished everything by 11am. Gorgeous exhibit for photos. I especially was in awe of the flower garden section. **Note:** There are lockers you can store your belongings and footwear. I suggest heading towards the farthest aisle right away (closer to the exhibit entrance), as a there a less people and to get going asap. Also, there are two pathways at the entrance. Make sure when you complete one pathway, to go back and experience the other. If your schedule permits, try booking on a weekday morning to avoid the crowds.\n* [Tsukiji Outer Fish Market](https://goo.gl/maps/YFFuEMWAwxANkjPe9) \\- 20 min bus ride away. Again, it was the weekend, so it was packed.  Didn't get to eat the many of popular foods, since we didn't want to wait in the long lines. We did try some eel, strawberry daifuku mochi, inari sushi, and deep fried tuna. We also passed by a tuna cutting event, which was very neat!\n* Diver City Plaza + Unicorn Gundam Statue - Originally we were aiming to head straight to the Gundam Statue, but we needed bathroom break and walked into Diver City. I'm glad we stopped by here. We took photos with an Ultimate Muscle figure, checked out the Hello Kitty store, and a souvenir store with anime goods. Then we visited the amazing Gundam statue just outside Diver City Plaza.\n* [Gyukatsu Motomura Koredo Muromachi Store](https://goo.gl/maps/f1u8tAtpYb4w5gEP8) \\- We chose to eat here in Ginza for dinner. Arrived at 5:30pm and were seated right away. A lineup started to formulate after we sat, so arriving around this time was perfect. We all purchased the beef 1.5 cutlet set meal for \u00a52600. I would go for the 1 cutlet next time, as it was very filling! The cutlet just melts in your mouth.\n* Tokyo Tower - Last stop of the day. Arrived around 8pm. We didn't enter the tower, since we already planned Shibuya Sky. There was a lineup for that \"[hidden](https://mihoshappylife.com/2022/05/29/take-instagrammable-tokyo-tower-pictures-secret-photo-location-in-japan/)\" Instagram spot for Tokyo Tower, so we skipped that. We still got a great shot of the tower right beside it.\n* Ended off the night at 7-eleven and tried the popular tamago (egg) sandwich and strawberry whipped cream sandwich. Definitely a must-try!\n\n**Day 3 (March 5, Sunday) - Akihabara, Tokyo**\n\n* Breakfast at our hotel. We left the hotel later than expected (10am), due to myself and my partner dealing with some leftover diarrhea from our Philippines trip.\n* [Jump Shop (Tokyo Dome)](https://goo.gl/maps/cpjvBvCvqAyxDXmq6) \\- Arrived 11am. No lineup. One of the bigger Jump Shop stores in Tokyo. The merch had a bigger emphasis on the newer anime like Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, and My Hero Academia.\n* [Cat Cafe Moff](https://moff-cafe.jp/shopinfo#akiba) Akihabara - Arrived 12pm. Once we got off the station, we spotted this cute cat cafe, and had to stop by. Entrance was \u00a51650 per person for 1 hour. No reservation was required. There were also free vending machine drinks available inside.\n* Lunch at McDonalds. Tried the teriyaki and ebi burger. Oh, how I wish we had these options back home!\n* Dessert at [Hokkaido Ice Cream](https://goo.gl/maps/iEkHyJmSNzkeMALp7). I recommend the Hokkaido melon ice cream flavor!\n* Then we shopped for the next bit. Walked from store to store, and found an absurd amount of figures in second hand shops, and in excellent condition. A must visit for anime lovers!\n* [Roast Beef Ohno](https://goo.gl/maps/ZYKtUWa1tMBiDuWPA)  \\- Arrived at 5pm. Short 15 min wait. A lineup was beginning to form, so I suggest arriving early for dinner. We all got the Japanese Beef Roast Beef bowl for \u00a51870.  The blend of beef with their specialty sauce and rice will make your stomach very content.\n* We walked and shopped a bit more until stores closed, which most were around 8pm.\n\n**Day 4 (March 6, Monday) - Shibuya &amp; Harajuku, Tokyo**\n\n* Shibuya Crosswalk - Arrived at 930am. Visited the Hachiko statue and walked the famous crosswalk.  Felt very surreal to see it in person!\n* [ONE PIECE Straw Hat Store - Shibuya Main Store](https://goo.gl/maps/7a5PXADkhrB7ssXy7) \\- Been anticipating coming here for awhile! There were a couple people with us waiting outside 10 mins prior to opening. For the One Piece lovers, this is where you can take a photo with Shanks holding Luffy's straw hat. If you walk around Magnet by Shibuya 109, you can also find some One Piece advertisement to snap a photo with!\n* [Uobei Sushi](https://goo.gl/maps/RPBRpV7HwyYxfNoM7) \\- You can get \u00a5120 for 2 pieces of sushi. Amazing quality for the price. Very cool conveyor belt sushi experience. The fatty salmon belly and eel are a must.\n* Harajuku - Decided to do a 20 min walk to explore rather than transit. I wanted to check out [Cafe Reissue](https://goo.gl/maps/t5UEmPvtkinVVuPo9) for their customizable 3D lattes, but didn't check to see it was closed on Mondays. But no worries, I had lots of other cafes/desserts saved on my Google Maps.\n* Takeshita Street - Arrived around 2pm. Super crowded. Thought we would stay here for a while, but we did a quick walkthrough instead. I don't think we stayed there for more than 45 mins. There were long lineups for the popular crepes shops, so we decided to have dessert elsewhere.\n* [Maccha House](https://goo.gl/maps/iCVryBebgNspUw1T6) \\- Known for their tiramisu matcha dessert. There are multiple locations.\n* Shibuya Parco - We walked from Harajuku back to Shibuya. Arrived at 4pm to Shibuya Parco, and visited the Jump Shop, Pokemon Center, Nintendo Store and Capcom Store. Surprisingly, there was a Final Fantasy pop-pop store for their 35th anniversary! Having played FF as a kid, it definitely was a memorable experience. We would've spent more time, but we had a reservation at Shibuya Sky at 5pm.\n* Shibuya Sky - A lot of people recommended this place over other observatories. I booked the 5pm time slot for the sunset in advance via [Klook](https://www.klook.com/activity/70672-shibuya-sky-tokyo/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9J2iBhBPEiwAErwpeS1UFmqvY_r-NuFKXuIUMal4pTgg1fgyhMwzZtBdKSIM8flcTQ0a4hoCEvYQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds). There was already a huge lineup, and we waited for 30 mins to get to the top. On every corner at the top, you can lineup for a gorgeous photo. However, we aren't really keen on waiting so we opted not too. Shibuya Sky was amazing to watch the sunset to night fall. If you watched Alive in Borderland, they filmed a few scenes here. Upon leaving, there was another 30 mins wait for the elevator. We left around 7pm.\n* [Ichiran Shibuya](https://goo.gl/maps/UeEz1aTnuSiD3Tkw9) \\- Famously known for their solo ramen eating. The lineup was long, as expected at 730pm. My sibling really wanted to try it, so we waited for almost 30-45 mins. I previously thought it would be overrated, but I quite enjoyed it!\n\nDay 5 (March 7, Tuesday) - Ikekuburo &amp; Shinjuku, Tokyo\n\n* [Sunshine City](https://goo.gl/maps/Sb6P81KDAdTixiQm8) \\- Visited another One Piece Mugiwara store, Pokemon Center, and visited the huge Gashapon store. More shopping around. We blindly tried a tonkotsu resturant in the mall, which was very filling.\n* [A Happy Pancake](https://goo.gl/maps/YRNNRdgocPQsu3vc9) \\- for the fluffy Japanese souffle cakes! The whole trip to Ikekuburo ended around 4 pm.\n* Shinjuku - 15 mins train ride. Checked out the 3D cat billboard, Godzilla, Omoide Yokoncho, and Golden Gai. Very beautiful alleyways. Shinjuku is very lively at night - saw a band playing live music, people driving the Mario karts on the streets.\n* [Ramen Nagi in Golden Gai](https://goo.gl/maps/cjCMHiLFzcB3KW9v5) \\- We were lucky to grab a seat here, since there was very limited seating. First time trying anchovy broth based ramen.\n\nDay 6 (March 8, Wednesday) - Free day - Akihabara\n\n* I previously kept this day unplanned, since I figured we need a rest/chill day to recuperate. I left it open to going back to any city we liked, or feel like we didn't explore enough. In the end, we chose to go back to Akihabara, since we felt like we could shop for ages and wander around. We spent the whole day here shopping.\n* Luggage transport - Before our venture, we sent our a couple of our luggage to our hotel in Kyoto. Our hotel staff were very helpful to do the process for us. We had 6 check-in luggage each, and we only we sent half our luggage. Next time I would send any full luggage straight to our final airport, to avoid unnecessary back and forth luggage forwarding (although I need to research how long luggage is allowed to be kept at the airport).\n* [Unatoto](https://www.unatoto.com/menu/) \\- Unagi is one of my favorites dishes to eat, so I was happy to find they serve unagi don for an affordable price like \u00a51100. It was so delicious, that we came back for dinner. According to google, the Akihabara location is temporarily closed, but there are multiple locations.\n\nDay 7 (March 9, Thursday) - Kyoto\n\n* Mistake #1 - This was the day to activate our Japan Rail pass. However, I forgot to ask for the JR 7-day pass at the ticket counter, and purchased a one way ticket to Kyoto instead. We booked reserved seats for our luggage for around 1pm, and arrived to Kyoto station around 3:30pm.\n* [Hotel Amanek Kyoto Kawaramachi Gojo](https://goo.gl/maps/wgyqsYNgywRJJAVb9) \\- Pros - onsen (not tattoo friendly) available, super relaxing after a long day. From 5-8pm, you can enjoy free drinks including alcohol (although, we usually were out during this timeframe). This location was easy walking distance to places such as Nishiki Market, or Potoncho Alley. The only negative is little room for luggage space, and walkway, but we managed to make it work. There is extra space under the beds to store your luggage.\n* Nishiki Market - We only had an hour to spend since we arrived at 5pm and most shops closed at 6pm. Smaller than Tsukiji Outer Fish Market, but we really enjoyed it! No major lineups, so we got to enjoy a variety of foods. One of our favorite souvenirs was from [Sugi Honey Shop](https://goo.gl/maps/QvN92xRRfiepAEpj7) \\- we tried a sample of their yuzu lemon drink, and ended up purchasing a couple bottles. There was also stand offering sake shots for only \u00a5100.\n* Dinner - Our plan was to eat at Sushitetsu for the \u00a5220 sushi (2 pieces), but there was a gigantic lineup, so we decided to walk down Potoncho Alley and stopped by an izakaya instead. We tried matcha and yuzu flavored beer. Can't seem to find the place on Google.\n\nDay 8 (March 9, Friday) - Higayashima\n\n* Nishiki Market - 1 hour was not enough to explore this market, so we returned again at 10am. Tried tangerine filled mochi, dined in at [Daiyasu](https://goo.gl/maps/TDrGYx612FwqiTJ19) to try their fresh and large oysters, had the best deep fried chicken skin at [Torisei](https://goo.gl/maps/ceGMkezczTcWzqtBA), marinated tako, dango, pumpkin croquette (hard to find on google maps, but was so yummy!)\n* Kimono Rental -  There were so many rental shops on the way to Kiyomizu-dera, so we just picked a random shop that offered affordable prices. The process took a total of 45 mins with our hair included. It was such a great experience to walk around in beautiful kimonos and take photos. Definitely a must do!\n* Walked to Yasaka Shrine, Kodai-ji Temple, Sannezaka St + Ninenzaka St. The Starbucks with tatami mats had all spots taken. I would have loved to wander down these streets at night.\n* Kiyomizu-dera - One of my favorites temple attractions in Kyoto! Absolutely stunning. We began walking back to our kimono rental shop at 4pm.\n* [Yakiniku-Like](https://goo.gl/maps/79XC6FYfnJgStMRu9) \\- known for solo grilling yakiniku. Excellent taste of meat and cheap. Check it out, and get the wagyu combo!\n\nDay 9 (March 10, Saturday) - Nara daytrip\n\n* Nara - Slept in a bit longer than planned. About 1 hour train ride, and arrived at 12pm. Deer are immediately spotted a block away from Nara station. You can purchase crackers for \u00a5200 to feed the deer. Be aware some deer can be aggressive (couple head bumps), but overall one of my favorite experiences in Japan.\n* [Nakatanidou](https://goo.gl/maps/vqjT1b3UUfAMehF6A) \\- the famous mochi making store. You can watch the performance every 15 (?) mins. The mochi was probably the best mochi I have ever eaten!\n* [Okonomiyaki Parco](https://goo.gl/maps/hYaB6VebkU5C8J1Z6) \\- Dined in at 2pm. No lineup. We tried their okonomiyaki and homemade gyoza. Affordable and huge portions for the three of us!\n* Todai-ji Temple - Even more deer in this area! Grand temple for a small entrance fee.\n* Isui-en Garden - We walked here, but didn't get to enter. My mistake, as I didn't know it was 30 mins until closing.\n* We then headed back to Kyoto for dinner. If you're wondering if you could be spend half a day in Nara, then yes! We spent a total of 4 hours (not included transit).\n* [Sushitetsu](https://goo.gl/maps/cSHTAQaLhaFw7eKd9) \\- As mentioned above, there was a huge lineup here for dinner. So this time, we arrived 10 minutes before opening at 5pm. We put our name on the waitlist and still had to wait 30 mins. They had a great variety of sushi! Come super early before opening to grab a spot.\n\nDay 10 (March 11, Sunday) - Osaka daytrip\n\n* Left our hotel at 10am. It was an hour train ride to Osaka Station. Checked out the One Piece store and Pokemon Center close by. Very crowded floor, with a couple queues that weren't too long though. Spent about 1 hour here.\n* [Tempura Makino Nanbasen'nichimae shop](https://goo.gl/maps/4274j45qvJF9KYcQ7) \\- I originally planned to eat at an okonomiyaki restaurant, but we had tried it the day before in Nara. We blindly walked into this restaurant with a 20 min wait or so. This was probably one of my favorite tempura meals we tried in Japan. The affordability, the portion, and counter view was well-worth it. I ate the Makino Tempura Set A with deep fried shrimp, squid, fish, chicken, mushroom, chicken, miso soup, and refillable rice for only \u00a51199! Also, I recommend to add the deep fried egg for a small additional cost.\n* Den-Den Town - For the anime lovers. [Super Potato](https://goo.gl/maps/FqLxqcSvkcmpa68J7) was a nostalgic walk down memory lane for gamers. Retro gaming vibes.\n* Dotonbori - I loved the lively and vibrancy walking around this area. Really comes to life when the sun begins to set, and the lights turn on. So much street food everywhere you walk. I regret not trying takoyaki in Osaka (was so full from lunch). Don't forget to take a photo with the famous running man!\n* [Ten-Ti-Jin \u5929\u5730\u4eba \u524d\u65e5\u524d\u5e97](https://goo.gl/maps/kjhix7ofkzb56p2C8) \\- We weren't quite hungry for dinner yet, so we returned to the Den-Den Town area to shop a bit more. We eventually stopped here for ramen, since there was no line. We liked it quite a lot! The meat was tender, and broth was rich.\n* I really loved Osaka. I felt like one day definitely wasn't enough to explore and try their food. Next time, I would like to eat Kobe beef, kushiage, okonomiyaki, and takoyaki here.\n\nDay 11 (March 12, Monday) - Western Kyoto\n\n* Arashiyama Bamboo Forest - Everywhere I read said to go on a weekday and arrive super early by 7am to beat the crowds. That was the plan, but we were exhausted from yesterday so we left the hotel about 8am, haha. Took about 50 mins to get to the Bamboo forest. Also, this was the only day of cloudiness we faced during the whole trip. I expected there to be a huge crowd by the time we arrived at 9am, but surprisingly, it wasn't that busy at all. It could of been also due to the cold and grey forecast. However, on the way back to the entrance, groups of people began to arrive (9:45ish).\n* [Monkey Park Iwatayama](http://monkeypark.jp/eng-index.html) \\- 15 min walk from the Bamboo forest. \u00a5600 fee per adult. It began to lightly rain. Unfortunately we didn't carry an umbrella with us, but there was an indoor section with a heater on the top of the mountain. You can see an awesome view of Kyoto at the very top. I recommend stopping by here if you get the chance to, especially for animal lovers! You can also buy snacks to feed the Monkeys. Keep in mind it closes at 4pm.\n* Originally we intended to have lunch at [Kameyamaya](https://tabelog.com/en/kyoto/A2601/A260403/26010406/), but it wasn't open even though google said it was. Walked down the main street scoping out restaurants, until we found [Yoshida-ya](https://goo.gl/maps/H2oiKB4vM6Cox8ic8). This place and food was very home-y and comfort like. Warm and tasty rice bowls for a cloudy day.\n* Shopped, walked, and ate many snacks. [Mamemono](https://goo.gl/maps/S2L9xjuHG8U1HQbi6) \\- wondered what the lineup was about, and decided to queue in too. Ordered a taiyaki with a stick of butter for \u00a5350. [Yosiya](https://goo.gl/maps/ZdwccPz7qiYDD8sp8) \\- another lineup. I tried their No.1 recommended item, the yuba (tofu skin) and cheese. I would've grabbed seconds, if I wasn't so full from lunch. Highly recommend! [Kyoto Baum](https://kyobaum.shop/) \\- Tried a small slice of their moist and fluffy soymilk &amp; matcha based cake. I ended up buying two whole cakes to bring back home.\n\nDay 12 (March 13, Tuesday) - Southern Kyoto\n\n* Started the morning with sending half of our luggage to Narita airport. I read that it may take more than 1 day to safely arrive, so we sent it today. Hotel staff were great once again in assisting us with the process.\n* Fushimi Inari - To avoid the crowds, it's recommended to arrive as early as the Bamboo forest. It didn't go as planned. We were occupied with our sending our luggage, and we didn't feel like there was a rush. About 25 train ride. Arrived at 10am. It was crowded as expected at this time. BUT, once we hiked up past the intersection with the city view, there was barely anyone hiking up the loop. We we able to snap solo pictures with the beautiful red tori gates. The whole experience and hiking to the top took 2 hours. It was 12pm by the time we were done. I highly recommend hiking the different pathways. It was definitely worth seeing, especially without the crowds!\n* [Kyozuan](https://goo.gl/maps/Sc7Hqpqavo8W45Jw5) \\- exercise deserved some ice cream. This place offers soymilk based tofu soft serve. One of my favorites flavors I've tried!\n* [Kanoko](https://goo.gl/maps/DZTSWPN54cmrH8Nr6) \\- hungry, we browsed around Fushimi Inari until we found this soba restaurant. Not too sure if I'm a fan of soba noodles, but the tempura and side dishes I received in my meal combo were delicious.\n* Mistake #2 - Around 2pm, I got an email from Booking.com indicating I needed to pay an extra night at our hotel. I thought I had booked 6 nights, but I apparently only booked 5. Good thing we were on our way back to our hotel anyways, so when we got there I just needed to rebook a night through Booking and show the confirmation email. It costed about $200...when it should've been $70 had I not made that mistake. Lesson learned! I advise you to triple check your accommodations right now, haha.\n* Walked around the area surrounding Nishiki Market to do some more shopping and snacking.\n\nDay 13 (March 14, Wednesday) - Asakusa, Tokyo\n\n* Checked out the hotel at 10am. Bought a one-way ticket to Tokyo with reserved seats. We arrived to our hotel in Asakusa around 2pm, but we were early for our check-in (3pm). The staff, however, allowed us to check-in early.\n* [Asakusa Hotel Hatago](https://goo.gl/maps/ivwMCVoDcgBJW56z5) \\- Out of the three hotels, this room was the most spacious! More room to organize our luggage. There is also a period of time in the evening where you can view Tokyo Skytree outside their deck. You could see Tokyo Skytree just outside our room window too. They also serve complimentary tea/coffee, and toast for breakfast (which was very tasty). Location was superb to the nearest subway. Walkable 5 min distance to Nakamise-dori St as well.\n* Nakamise-dori St - Passed by the gorgeous Kaminarimon Gate on entry. It was no surprise of how packed it was at this time. Had some ice cream sandwiches at [Asakusa Ch\u014dchin Monaka](https://goo.gl/maps/jLz3mrgdendiopz27). The final stop to Sensoji-Temple was beautiful! We were lucky to see the cherry blossoms, since we didn't think it would bloom during out trip. Spent around 1 hour here.\n* Tokyo Skytree - Only a quick 10 min train ride away from our hotel. Spent some time at the Jump Shop, and did some last minute souvenir shopping.\n* Returned to the hotel at 8pm so we could check out the view of Tokyo Skytree from hotel hotel's rooftop. Soaked in the view of our final night in Japan!\n\nDay 14 (March 15, Thursday) - Asakusa, Tokyo\n\n* Check out was at 10am. The staff were kind enough to allow us to leave our luggage there while we searched for lunch.\n* Nakamise-dori St - [Funawa](https://goo.gl/maps/2hzSiGT7FUHqMrQx5) \\- Try their sweet potato flavored ice cream! There was also this store selling Yuzu products, but I'm unable to find on Google. Their cold, carbonated yuzu drinks was very refreshing. [Kaminari-Issa](https://goo.gl/maps/nnpKgTDX4Zsgo93e9) \\- This had a huge lineup the day before, so I wanted to try it when there was less people. Offered matcha/hojicha flavor drinks and ice cream.\n* Flight out to Canada from Narita airport. Luggage that was sent from our hotel in Kyoto was easily found at the airport.\n\nBudget for myself (approximate in CAD):\n\n* Flights roundtrip \\~ $1200\n* Accommodations \\~ $500\n   * Hotel Asia Center of Japan (6 nights) \\~ $130 per night (\\~ $43 per person)\n   * Hotel Amanek Kyoto Kawaramachi Gojo (6 nights) \\~ $70 per night (\\~ $23 per person)\n   * Asakusa Hotel Hatago (1 night) \\~ $90 per night (\\~ $30 per person)\n* Activities \\~ $100\n   * Team Labs - $34.05 exact\n   * Shibuya Sky - $18.35 exact\n   * Kimono rental \\~ \u00a54500\n* JR pass \\~ $300 (2x one way tickets)\n* Transportation \\~ &lt; $100? (sorry, didn't keep track)\n* Total without food/shopping \\~ $2200\n* Food/shopping \\~ $1000-2000 (didn't keep track)\n* Total with food/shopping \\~ $3300-4300 (three of us varied with shopping expenses)\n\nMarch weather:\n\n* Early March - chilly, especially at night. I brought a long puffer jacket and a wool coat. The puffer definitely was cozier for the cold. Although cold, I did enjoy the crisp, fresh air.\n* Mid March - there were some really warm days. I remember our daytrip to Osaka, my partner wore only a t-shirt and shorts, while I wore a light shirt and flowy pants.\n* Cherry blossoms - we were lucky to witness some cherry blossoms (or maybe they were plums) in Asakusa where we stayed in our final days in Tokyo. It wasn't in the forecast for early blooming, so I wasn't expecting to see them!\n\nComments:\n\n* E-sim - My sister purchased a sim card at Narita Airport for $45 for, I believe, not even 5gb. She used an e-sim on another trip, and completely forgot to do it for this trip. Luckily she told my partner and I to get an e-sim when we were flying out from Manila. We used Ubigi. It was only $17 for 10gb/30 days. Great for hotspot, and google maps. Will definitely continue with e-sim from now on.\n* Suica card - available at the airport and at train stations. Easy to replenish funds with cash in the machine. English translation option. I used this card often at convenience stores like 7-Eleven and even some souvenir shops accepted the IC card. I loved the convenience of tapping the card without counting change.\n* Google Translate - super helpful app on the phone under Google Lens! Very accurate for the most part. Highly recommend using.\n* Google Maps - this was the only app we used to navigate with. Worked great for us. Some odd times it would malfunction with our location, but generally excellent.\n* Power bank - recommended especially since using Google Maps drains the battery.\n* Double check your accommodations - Especially if you have multiple stays booked! I thought I booked enough nights for Kyoto, but I made the mistake of checking out a day early. As a consequence, I had to pay about $200 for an extra night, when it should've been around $70.\n* Pack way less - I would bring maybe a weeks worth of under garments/socks. We used one of our hotel's coin laundry (although it did take a couple hours to dry). Since the hotels we stayed in provided toiletries and yukata, no need to bring any pajamas too. Note this was for all our the hotels, so I can't say for AirBnbs!\n* Luggage transport - use it if you're bringing a ton of luggage like we did. Trust me, saves you the hassle especially on lugging it around on crowded transit. There are lots of stairs we had to carry them up on at times. Breaks a sweat for sure! Our hotel staff kindly assisted us with the paper work.\n* Keep a flexible itinerary - Don't cramp too much in your day. It's good to have a backup plan, but no need to rush from one thing to the other. There is SO much to do. We found ourselves discovering new spots everywhere we went. Not everything on my itinerary was strictly done in order. Have some leeway in your schedule to consider the possibility of getting lost, which did happen. Especially for first-timers in Japan, it can take some time to be familiar with the transit system.\n* Restaurants - Forgot to reserve? Too long of a wait? Don't worry, you can find amazing restaurants almost anywhere. Some days we blindly walked into a restaurant based on the lineup, or their physical food display outside the store front (lots have this!). Never once did we had unpleasant food. You can find hidden gems this way too.\n* Bring a coin purse - You'll find yourself carrying lots of change, especially if you're carrying cash. Many crane games mostly take \u00a5100 coin. Gashapons are everywhere in Tokyo, and take \u00a5100 coins as well.\n* Wear comfortable shoes - This is a common suggestion when travelling to Japan, and it's true. I didn't keep track of how many steps or km we walked per day, but it was enough to take a couple breaks in cafes/restaurants to relieve our worn out legs.\n* Carry your passport for [tax-free savings](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2450_how.html#:~:text=Tax%2Dfree%20shopping%20is%20available,required%20when%20shopping%20tax%2Dfree) \\- many shops offer tax-free savings when you spend over \u00a55000! Note: the items are then sealed in a bag.\n\nI feel like there's a lot I'm forgetting, but I hope some info can be of use to your future trip! Thanks for reading!",

When they ran out cash, they used the ATMs at 7-Eleven! I believe they took out an extra $500 at least. I heard the rates are really good at 7-Eleven, although I can't confirm since I didn't get to use it.",

And if this means I can go crazy with my shopping in Tokyo to fill up the luggage...well, it must be done \ud83d\ude04 \n\nI also bookmarked some places you suggested! I'm glad to hear that most food places were good and we don't have to line up at all the popular spots :)",

Thank you so much!!\n\nFor Yamato transport (not sure which one each hotel uses), they store the luggage at the airport for up to [7 days](https://faq-en.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/app/answers/detail/a_id/6688). Sorry I didn't know it was only a week, but I hope it works within your timeframe! If not, the hotel to hotel luggage forwarding helps a lot.\n\nI sent an email and they confirmed saying \"Regarding your enquiry, Yamato Transport is able to store luggage only up to 7 days and luggage must be shipped out by the cut-off time at least 3 days before the flight date.\"",

They assist with hotel to hotel, or hotel to airport luggage transport! \n\nIf you are staying at a hotel, the hotel staff can help you fill out the paper work. Super quick and convenient:)",

            "comment": "Tokyo subway pass is generally not recommended as you cannot ride any JR lines with it. The famed Yamanote line that connects all major sights in a circle will not be accessible to you.  The transit system is already as overwhelming - last you want to do is trying to figure out if that or this line works with your pass..\n\nItinerary feels a bit heavy to me. I suggest allocating some to your last day (so it relieves one of your Tokyo days), prioritize what you really want to see as it is unlikely you can see all of it,,,",

            "comment": "Hi actually for 25 June I think it will be hard to fit in yuryo/not worth it as i feel yuryo you need time to enjoy the facilities to make it worth unless you really want to do a 20-30 mins dip and head out.  \n\nI am not too sure of yuryo\u2019s closing time but things in hakone generally close pretty early (about 5:45 is the last call for rides visits etc) I would say if you really want to go yuryo you can maybe fit it before heading on the loop as there is a shuttle bus to yuryo from hakone Yumoto but personally I wouldn\u2019t it as I feel you need time to fully enjoy all of yuryo\u2019s facilities unless you are ok with fast gaming it \n\nbut even with that it would mean when you are at each stop of the loop you might need to leave after a few photos which I personally feel is a waste as there\u2019s so much to do along the loop (gora park, gift shops, meteorological society)\n\nBut this is my personal thoughts having been to hakone last month and I tried fitting in yuryo too but thankfully stayed in hakone for 2 days so I didn\u2019t need to rush but if I had only stayed 1 day I doubt I would have managed to finish the loop",

            "comment": "Tokyo Metro pass is an option but before committing to it, check if all your moves make sense using the metro only as opposed as using JR.\n\nObviously you will have to buy a couple of extra tickets for the airport or to Yokohama as they are not covered by the metro.\n\nWhat you could do is get a Pasmo card (Pasmo Passport is the tourist version available now) and load the metro ticket on it. This way you can use both the metro ticket and anything not covered using the card, so no extra ticket to purchase.",

We waited in a short line but the waitress let us in when a table opened, and the menuhad lots of pictures. Perfect if you are looking for the feel of an older and more traditional restaurant. I recommend bringing cash to Hakone for such places.",

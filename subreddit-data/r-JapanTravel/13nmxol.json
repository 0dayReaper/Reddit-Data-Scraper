    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am visiting Osaka / Kyoto / Kobe in a few weeks. On the last day of the trip, I would have a gap between checking out of the hotel at noon and my flight in the late evening.\n\nMy family (2 adults 1 child) would probably be spending our available time around the Namba area and the premium outlets across the airport. \n\nCan anyone suggest a place for rest (a shower hopefully) at any of these areas, including the Kansai airport?\n\nI have looked up private rooms at the many Internet cafes in Namba, but they seem to only allow adults above 18\n\nMany thanks",

Good views of planes landing from the rotenfuro. No family baths though.\n\nAnd as a bonus just across the street from Rinku Outlet.",

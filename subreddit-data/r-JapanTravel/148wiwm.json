Expect everything to be very crowded. \n\nIt also appears you\u2019re going to Tokyo for a single day and then back to Kansai just for Teamlabs and Shimokitazawa. Why? This is the very opposite of relaxed. You can stay in the larger Kyoto region and find lots of nature if you leave Kyoto. Nara. Mie. Lake Biwa. Osaka is a large city and an easy day trip from Kyoto. \n\nAlso, a bus from Kyoto to Tokyo is NOT three hours. It takes about six to seven hours to drive between the two in a normal passenger car on toll roads. Are you confusing the bus with the Shinkansen?\n\nHow are you getting back from Tokyo to Osaka for your flight?\n\nShimokitazawa is not a place to find deals on vintage clothing. It\u2019s heavily gentrified now. Expect to find \u00a512,000 UCLA sweatshirts from 2009.",

            "comment": "&gt;bus from Kyoto to Tokyo (3.5hour bus ride)\n\nNo. That is much much longer by bus. That's about how long it takes by shinkansen.\n\nAnd if you are only planing to go for a single day in Tokyo, I would save my time and money and stay in Kansai only, try to find thrift stores in Kyoto or Osaka for example.",

    "postText": "I've seen mixed reviews online and on this thread on whether or not the Tsukiji Outer Market or the newer Toyosu fish market are worth visiting, and most posts about this are from 4-6 years ago. Has anyone gone recently, and if so, what was your experience? I don't plan to try and catch a tuna action; I mostly want to get authentic and delicious street food at a decent price.\n\nIs either one more for locals, or did you see primarily tourists (with higher prices accordingly?) Was the food comparable to other places in Tokyo? Thoughts?",

It's fun that you can pick up some bits and pieces of street food here and there, but it's not a place to go for a bargain. It's obviously set up for tourists, so just like any other tourist place, you're going to get tourist prices",

The amount to eat and the variety is enough to warrant a trip but it is a tourist spot, you go there to buy and everyone there wants to sell you something, food was good I am glad I went. People say no locals but there was a spot on the outside of the market that was curry I think, and it had the longest line of all the stalls, all locals and only locals that I could tell.",

Toyosu feels a lot like you are going to a business meeting with some fish.\n\nTsukiji has more charm, has a couple of shrines near by, you can walk through a little park on the way there through a residential area, and enjoy the weather. I suggest going on the early side to avoid big crowds and being punch by the sun in the afternoon. Tsukiji feels a lot like you are going on a stroll in a cute neighborhood with some fish.",

Every stall had line but they move pretty quick. \n\nI will say if you want grilled high quality meat for 2000 yen then there\u2019s a stand that will satisfy your craving. They have different packages of meat that you select and hand it to the man at the grill to cook for you. It\u2019s best to get in that line early as the selections thin out later in the day. We made it to the front of the line around 1 PM and we got one of the last plates available.",

If you are confident in navigating in less familiar space, definitely move beyond Tsukiji.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso not to mention the crowd which can get really bad even during non-peak seasons.",

            "comment": "I went to Tskuji market, but with a tour. The guide took us places that were more local. Those places were in the same area or next to places that had a lot of tourists, but didn\u2019t have many tourists or non at all. However, not all of them were your typical street food. For instance, we stop at a place that sells soy beans cooked in different ways (roasted or sweet), another place that sells snacks (fried sweet potatoes and miso covered peanuts).\n\nI understand that language might be a challenge for those experiences, but there\u2019s much to see and eat outside of the touristy street vendors.\n\nThere were also tea samples and dashi stock samples that I got to try on our way to places.\n\nThe guide also mentioned other places that most locals visit, one that I remember was a beef intestines (maybe not intestines, can\u2019t fully remember) stew. I also walked through some small alleys that the guide mentioned had a cafe for locals.\n\nSo like everything, if you\u2019re willing to explore a bit more and not just follow a line, you might discover some interesting things. I don\u2019t think a tour is required to experience those things, but it helps.",

The first time you\u2019re seeing all kind of exotic vegetables and foods and treats, and its exciting. And then the last time you\u2019re there, you\u2019ve already spent time in Japan and you\u2019re more familair and experienced with all these exotic foods and you know what you\u2019ve tried and  may or may not like. Its fricken fantastic. Note: I gained 10 pounds during my trip while walking 150 miles over three weeks, sooo i may be biased from a food perspective",

But you\u2019re all mostly tourists so I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with doing touristy things. I know a lot of people want to avoid the tourists areas but in a place like Japan, it\u2019s kind of hard to go truly \u201cauthentic\u201d if you can\u2019t speak and read Japanese fairly well.",

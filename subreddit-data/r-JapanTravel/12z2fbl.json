    "postText": "Serious question: if the Tokyo Disney Resorts were closed or didn't exist, and you wanted a comparable entertainment experience for family and school age kids (4-14yo), what would you do and where would you go?\n\nLet's assume it's the same money budget and time budget (all day) from central Tokyo.\n\nIs there an alternative? Is TDR peerless in this space? Is there something \"more Japanese\" or \"better for kids\"? Is TDR just so good that it's worth the hassle?\n\n[Full disclosure: I hate the idea of waiting in innumerable lines after taking transit ~1hr from central Tokyo]",

On Wednesdays they provide instruction in English. \n\nThe other options for me would be Kodomo no kuni (for fun outdoor stuff), Mother\u2019s Farm (for more agricultural stuff), or Puroland on a weekday (super busy otherwise).\n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re \u201ccomparable,\u201d but that\u2019s what I\u2019d want to do. There are also a ton of fun interactive museums, it really depends on your interests.\n\nETA: I could even see doing a daytrip to Yokohama: Cup Noodle Museum in the AM, some place fun for lunch (splurge for BBQ at Dream Door? Or try the Disney Cafe), then go on rides at Cosmo World and/or see the giant Gundam. Do dinner someplace fun like kaitenzushi and stop at the Pok\u00e9mon center before heading back to Tokyo.",

            "comment": "Not the Tokyo area, however, if you are in the Osaka/Kobe area, I recommend Nijigen no Mori! It\u2019s more of an outdoor adventure park with various \u201czones\u201d that are all themed in different franchises. For example, Naruto, Dragon Quest, Crayon Shin-Chan, and Godzilla. I\u2019ve gone during both summer and spring vacation in Japan and it\u2019s never been that busy. \n\nThe activities are more like challenges with some ride-type attractions. They also have quite a bit of English support. I really enjoyed how interactive the challenges were. You also pay admission by the \u201czone\u201d so you can pick and choose what you want to do, however, there is plenty to do at any given area. \n\nOtherwise, Fuji-Q-Highland is about two hours from Shinjuku station. It\u2019s a theme park with views of Fuji. Admission here is really interesting as entering the park itself is free of charge. You then pay per ride you go on. You can also buy an \u201call day\u201d pass to ride as many rides as you would like. It\u2019s nice if not everyone has the same level of interest in every attraction. \n\nFuji-Q also has themed \u201czones\u201d that are included with admission to the park based on various Japanese franchises. \n\nI\u2019ve been to both and can potentially answer other questions as well.",

The scenery there outside is to die for too. It\u2019s not a resort like Disney, but it\u2019s a great day out.",

            "comment": "Maybe I'm biased, since I don't have kids and don't like Disney, but...dude, there is SO MUCH to do in Japan that doesn't rely on going to Disney. Stop by a Disney store if they want Disney plushes and stationery. The only people I've ever heard say Disney is a must-do is a Disney fan, the same way a Pokemon fan would insist on going to the Pokemon Cafe even if the food is bad.\n\nYou can do Japanese cultural things (kabuki theatre, taiko drumming, kimono rentals and then photoshoots in pretty places, festivals where the kids can play games), you can go shopping (do the kids like anime? You're so set it's not even funny), there's wacky restaurants and Studio Ghibli-themed stuff, there's oddball museums, there's TeamLab...\n\nIf you hail from the US then yeah, you can literally say \"We have Disney at home\" but then you're going to have to put out on that end someday anyway. At least Disney at home doesn't come with characters that your kids won't recognize because we don't have them here. Why would you go halfway around the world to do something you can do closer to home? Experience Japan! Whether the traditioal bits, the weird bits, consider experiencing something you can't do or get back home. What that something is depends on your kids' tastes and interests, as well as their attention span, but you could spend a month just looking at \"things to do in Tokyo\" videos and blogs and not even scratch the surface.",

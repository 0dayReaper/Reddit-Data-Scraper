            "comment": "Hey there. Congrats on the wedding! Here are some suggestions\n\nOsaka:\n\n\\-Tombori river cruise (at night) is probably a must in Osaka. They are covered by Osaka Amazing Pass. There are few lines that does this - you can check them out\n\n\\-Other suggestions: TeamLabs botanical garden if you are interested in that. Make sure to check out the food here in Osaka: Okonomiyaki / Takoyaki\n\n\\- Hiroshima is not exactly a day trip per se (it is 2 hours one way / 4 hours round trip). Wouldn't Nara be a better option instead for a day trip?\n\nHakone:\n\nRyokan: are you looking for traditional Japanesse hotel ? If so I found these:\n\nHakone Ginyu\n\nhttps://www.hakoneginyu.co.jp/en/\n\nHoeiso\n\n[https://www.hoeiso.jp/](https://www.hoeiso.jp/)\n\nSenkroyo\n\n[https://senkyoro.co.jp/english/room/room.html](https://senkyoro.co.jp/english/room/room.html)",

            "comment": "I'm not trying to be funny but a trip to Hiroshima on day 2 of the honeymoon? I suppose if you're both deeply interested in history it could be rewarding. But would you not rather do something a bit more fun and lively at the start of your honeymoon than ponder the nature of the cruelty of war?\n\n3 days in Osaka is barely scratching the surface, let alone 2.",

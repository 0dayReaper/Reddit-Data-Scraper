Checking in hotel, visiting T38 Observation Deck, Tokeidai, Susukino, Ramen Yokocho.\n\nDay 3 \n\nVisit Sapporo: Nijo market and Noren Yokocho, Odori park, Tv Tower, Sapporo Bier Garden and museum.\n\nDay 4 \n\nGo to Otaru in the morning and visit the canal, Chuo-bashi, Temiyasen Kaijo. Take train to Noborimetsu, we're thinking around 6pm\n\nDay 5 \n\nNoborimetsu - Hell Valley: Oyunuma river, relaxing at some onsen (I have a few tattoos, any advice/recommendations?)\n\nDay 6 \n\nTrain to Hakodate early in the morning, around 7 \n\nVisit Hakodate: Hakodateyama\n\nDay 7 \n\nVisit Hakodate: Hakodate Asaichi, bay area, Motomachi, Goryokaku if we have the time. \nPTrain to Morioka in the evening (around 3h).\n\nDay 8 \n\nVisit Morioka: bank of Iwate, eating some noodles, Hoonji temple. I had it on my radar already, and recently saw the NYT listed it as a place to visit on this year's list, but I've been checking blogs and I wouldn't say it looks spectacular. What's your take on it? \n\nTrain to Sendai in the evening (about 1h).\n\nDay 9 \n\nDay trip to Matsushima: maybe visit on a bike? bay area, green plaza, Kanrantei tea house, main street, Godaido temple, Fukuurajima bridge, Zuiganji temple. Back to Sendai.\n\nDay 10 \n\nVisit Sendai: Sendai Asaichi, shotengai, Zuihoden mausoleum, Aobayama park, Miyagiken Gokoku. I'm not sure we can fit all of it, but as much as we can. Then taking an evening train to Osaka, as late as possible (almost 5h).\n\nDay 11, 12 \n\nOne day we'll visit Osaka (Osaka castle, Dotombori, eating some okonomiyaki, Umeda Sky) and the other Universal Studios (mainly Mario world and Harry Potter). 1st day is a Sunday, park is open for longer but it'll probably be more crowded. What do you recommend?\n\nDay 13 \n\nVisit Osaka: Ts\u016btenkaku tower, den-den town. Train to Tokyo as soon as possible, around 3h to Shibuya.\n\nDays 14, 15, 16: Visit Tokyo. We visited last time already so we are not concerned about this part of the trip, but a rough itinerary could be:\n\nDay 14\n\nOdaiba, Asakusa (senso-ji, already visited), Omoide Yokocho street, playing some Taiko no tatsujin.\n\nDay 15\n\nWe want to take some photos of Mt Fuji. If wheather is not good this day, we can swap with day 14 or 16. Lake Kawaguchi, lake Saiko and Chureito Pagoda look the most interesting. It would be cool to visit them all but if not possible, which do you recommend? \n\nEdit: we're also thinking of doing this on day 13; departing from Osaka fairly early and stopping in lake Kawaguchi and the pagoda, to not retrace our steps once in Tokyo.\n\nDay 16\n\nTeam labs museum, shopping in Shibuya, seeing some pokemon center, nintendo store, Kabukicho in the evening.\n\nDay 17 \n\nVisit Tokyo: Square enix cafe, last minute shopping in Shibuya. Plane back home in the evening \n\n\n\nGood evening fellow Japan travellers, \n\nMy bf and I will be visiting Japan from oct 25th to nov 11th. We have the plane tickets to/from Narita airport and an airbnb in tokyo from nov 7th to 11th that we cannot change. So those two things are set, and we are deciding on the rest of the trip. We live in Spain and it's highly unlikely we'll go back to Japan in the foreseeable future (too many other places we haven't been to; we're going back now cause Airbnb gifted us the stay in Tokyo).\n\nOn our 1st visit a few years ago, we visited Kyoto, Nara, Himeji, Hiroshima, Miyajima, Takayama, Shirakawago, Tokyo, Nikko, Kamakura and Yokohama also in 2 weeks, so aside from Tokyo, which we love, we'd like to focus on different places.\n\nWhen we first started planning this time around, we talked about going north, but I would love to visit Universal Studios in Osaka, so we thought either we: a) could go just north (either just Hokkaido or that and things between Hokkaido and Tokyo), b) south (Osaka, Shikoku island and Tokyo), or c) a mix (north, Osaka and Tokyo). We've currently decided on the last one (I'm not sold on Shikoku, and USJ looks really good) but I'm worried it will be too much travelling and not enough time on each spot.\n\nInterests: honestly, a bit of everything. Our last trip was a dream. We're into nature but also big cities. We usually do the smaller towns-hikes first and end our trips in big cities to relax, do some shopping, etc. We love the temples, tradicional spots. We love the nerdy stuff, videogames, some anime, etc. Love the food, specially ramen (I'm vegetarian though). I have tattoos. We're in shape and don't mind walking a lot and keeping a pretty tight schedule so we can fit more things.\n\nSince it's peak fall, we'd love to see some autumn leaves.\n\n\nWe're planning on taking a backpack each and travelling as light as we can, although: 1. I like my clothes, 2. we have a lot of photography equipment (professional cameras, tripods, etc.) and 3. Since it's late October - early November, I'm worried it will be cold up north and we'll need thick clothes, so I'm not sure we'll be successful on that.\n\nBut my main concern is about moving around - staying balance: if we do this itinerary, we'll basically  visit cities and middle sized towns from Sapporo to Tokyo, spending little time in each. I've seen itineraries recommend things like Dewa Sanzan or Shiretoko National Park that look amazing, but we would need to spend more time in each place to fit hikes and visiting spots that are not in the city. I'm worried we'll focus too much on urban spots and miss on the authentic, but Im not sure what spots are the weakest in the current itinerary if we wanted to change anything. Any advice?\n\nIf it's a lot, we could always change the plan and do b) although, like I said, Shikoku doesn't look as spectacular to me. We would rent a car and drive around it for about 6-7 days, then go to Osaka then Tokyo. What's your opinion on Shikoku?\n\nAny tips will be welcomed. Thank you for reading.\n\nEdit: feel free to point me to any threads regarding a Sapporo-Tokyo train route. I used the search tool but couldn't find any.",

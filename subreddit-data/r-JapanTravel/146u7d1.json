Nothing is really fixed yet, except for the Harry Potter Studio Tour.\n\n20th and 21st June seem a little all over the place to me (21st seems like it may be heavy too?) , but there are certain exhibitions that I would like to see at the museums\u2026 I don\u2019t mind giving Shinjuku a miss (haven\u2019t found any activities that interests me much there), but I\u2019m not sure if moving some activities from the 21st to the 20th would make it any better.\n\nDo leave recommendations for food/alternative activities if you have any!\n\n\nHere is the itinerary:\n\nMy accommodation is in Odaiba for when I\u2019m in Tokyo.

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI seriously hope you have spent some time looking into when the buses from Nagano city to Ogizawa run, because I'm pretty sure the 8-9 hour estimate is from Ogizawa to Toyama, not from Tokyo to Toyama via the route.  You are a good 2 hours+ to Nagano, then need to take  a bus to either Ogizawa or to Shimano Omachi and take a local bus to Ogizawa (the former is much faster, but I have no idea the frequency of either!)\n\nI think that is a VERY packed day and I just hope you know when the last train back from Toyama is and it gives you time to make it to Shimbashi to transfer over.  I would not want to pay a taxi to Odaiba.\n\nI think the 21st will be long, I think depending on where on Odaiba you are, the Rinkai line will be fastest.\n\nI think June 23rd is going to be exhausting.\n\nHonestly I would cut the Kurobe Alpine Route and give that day to Kansai.  I think trying to do that as a day trip from Odaiba is really challenging.",

Thanks for the response :) \n\nYep, I have looked into the route &amp; transport schedules for the route, and am aware that the suggested duration on the website is for Ogizawa to Tateyama. I\u2019ve also checked into the transport to and from Odaiba, and it seemed to me like the trip was possible (from 6am-11pm.) I\u2019m not very concerned about the last train from Toyama as it seems that they do run quite late (my calculations were not based on the last trains). \nNonetheless, I do agree that it would be packed, and will consider your suggestion to spend a day in the Kansai region instead!\n\n\nFor the 20th-21st, I may actually give teamLab a miss and go to Meiji Shrine/Takeshita Street on the 20th instead. Do you think that would be better?\n20th: Imperial Palace -&gt; Modern Art -&gt; Meiji Shrine/Takeshita St -&gt; Shinjuku.\n21st: National Art Centre -&gt; Mori Arts -&gt; Elephant Studios -&gt; Shibuya.\n\n\nFor the 23rd, it is a lot of walking, as far as I can tell. My group is alright with it though so that is why we kept it like this, but if you have any suggestions, we\u2019ll be open to them!\n\nThanks again!",

Some shrines are always open (like Fushimi Inari) but often temples do have a closing time, it can be a lot.  I just think it could feel like a lot especially with possible rain and definite humidity.\n\nI mean it sort of depends on your interest what you should do?  Just be aware that Harajuku much like Akihabara is an areas that a lot won't open until 11ish or possibly even noon.  Neither are really early morning destinations unless you want to walk around the streets while they are quieter.",

    "postText": " A few months ago I made a post breaking down how much money I have spent traveling full-time over 8 months.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are from the USA and have been traveling for 10 months. Our first 8 months were spent in Eastern Europe and at the end of December we came to Japan.\n\nBoth of us have kept track of every $ spent! I hope to share this info to show that you can travel to unique places on a tight budget! \n\nIn Europe, we used a daily budget of $37.50 or $75 combined. This was not possible in Japan, we did not set a $ amount that we had to be under but we did try to be frugal and the budget was in mind all the time. \n\nIF YOU ARE COMING TO JAPAN ON HOLIDAY I REALLY RECOMMEND SAVING MONEY AND SPENDING IT! \n\nThis was my 3rd time in Japan and my girlfriend\u2019s 1st. In Europe, we did not feel we missed out on much by being on a budget but in Japan, it is a different story. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we had a lot of fun, but there was so much left undone because of the budget. It mostly boils down to food. We ate a lot of meals from convenience stores. We skipped a lot of the expensive seafood that if I was on holiday would have bought without a second thought.\n\nWe tried to always eat the local specialty. Raw chicken sashimi in Kagoshima and Fugu in Shimonoseki are good examples of that. \n\nYou definitely can do things on a budget, we went to Fukuoka the tonkotsu(pork broth) ramen capital of Japan, and ate at some of the highest-rated ramen restaurants, which was very affordable. A lot of major sights and attractions are free. \n\nThis is just one person's spend and we split basically everything. I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions you may feel free to ask or DM me.\n\nLink to Charts: [https://imgur.com/a/ryAt7YT](https://imgur.com/a/ryAt7YT) \n\nAll numbers are in USD$.\n\nIN TOTAL I SPENT $2,768.28 or $58.89 per day. THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION/ FLIGHTS/ RAIL PASS\n\nSome detail about the categories:\n\nAccommodation $1,006.91 - Hostels were the primary accommodation. It was always a mixed dorm and never a private room. 5 nights we spent in an airbnb solely because there were no hostel beds available. 6 nights were \u201cfree\u201d thanks to my cousin who lives in Akita and let us stay with him. I put quotes on that because while he didn\u2019t charge us to stay with him, we did end up paying \\~$130 to take the Shinkansen from Akita back to Tokyo, and bought him a few meals and stuff. 2 nights were spent in hotels because stuff went sideways (more on that later)\n\nActivities $97.73 - Castles, Capybara and Micro Pig Cafes, Ninja Theme Park, Museums, and Onsens.\n\nAlcohol $103.21 - I drank so much more during my time in Japan compared to Europe. I want to say it was because it was so cold out and meeting/socializing with so many other people in hostels. \n\nCoffee $8.34 - This is the occasional coffee from a 7-Eleven or a vending machine. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation. I did bring with me a lot of caffeine pills. I really like how I can wake up and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill and be good to go, they are also cheaper than coffee. My girlfriend doesn't take them primarily because she enjoys drinking coffee so much. The pills are $.03 each. \n\nFood $341.93 - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.\n\nHealth $25.76 - Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.\n\nMisc $14.03 - Kerosene to refill my cousins heaters. \n\nMobile Phone $0 - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States, but my girlfriend does. If I didn\u2019t have her phone to use I would have bought a sim card. \n\nSouvenir $4.08 - I try to buy a magnet in each country \n\nTransportation(local) $184.79 - This is using trains/buses to get around a city. We did not take a taxi or use a ride-share app while in Japan. \n\nTravel $595.96 - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Our flight was paid for with 35,000 American Airlines miles +$5.60. This also includes our 21-day Rail Pass. \n\nCities Visited:\n\n1. Tokyo\n2. Kyoto\n3. Uji\n4. Osaka\n5. Nara\n6. Koka\n7. Matsuyama\n8. Fukuoka\n9. Nagasaki\n10. Kagoshima\n11. Ibusuki\n12. Beppu\n13. Shimonoseki\n14. Hiroshima\n15. Matsue\n16. Yonago\n17. Sendai\n18. Hakodate\n19. Sapporo\n20. Otaru\n21. Akita\n22. Yazawa\n\nThings that went right: The Japanese people are so friendly and welcoming. When the trains got canceled and we got stuck in Yonago, the people working at JR tried everything they could to help us. We walked to 7 different hotels with snow coming down and we must have walked past this one cafe so many times because the old couple who ran it came out to ask if we were ok and the husband walked with us to 4 more hotels and spoke to the people for us to get us a room. \n\nThe couple who sat next to us at the Izakaya in Kagoshima helped us because we had no idea what we were doing. Ended up becoming friends and spent the next 4 hours sharing food and drinking together. \n\nThe random people who would ask if we needed help navigating the train stations. The people are lovely. \n\nWhat went Wrong: The weather. This was to be expected since we flew into Japan on December 30. Our plan was to visit Matsue, and then take the overnight train from Matsue to Tokyo and continue on to Kanazawa. The massive amount of snow canceled those trains, we ended up getting ushered onto a train that went to Yonago and then that got canceled so a lot of people were forced to get hotel rooms (see above for the hero of that story). There was no guarantee we could get out of Yonago because it snowed all night but we got to the station at 5:45 am to try and get the 6 am train and we managed to escape! We did not get to go to Kanazawa because the trains all got canceled and we were afraid of getting stuck there and missing our reservation in Sapporo for the Snow Festival. \n\nWhile the Shinkansen rarely gets canceled the express trains and local trains get canceled all the time due to weather. Something to note.\n\nFavorite Cities:\n\n1. Hakodate - Cool history, good food, very cute.\n2. Kagoshima - Amazing food, the soy sauce there was the best I have ever had. You can eat raw chicken sashimi there (torisashi), I thought it was ok but not great. Sand onsen nearby was amazing. \n3. Sapporo - Big city, the food in Hokkaido is absolutely incredible. Lots of cool day trips to take from here. \n\nSome useful resources: \n\n1. Ramen Database- Also has curry, gyoza, udon, soba, etc. you can search by all time ranking, by year, by prefecture, pretty cool tool and we used it a lot to find some amazing food! Ramendb.supleks .jp\n2. JR pass calculator, you can plan out your route and it will show if it is worth getting the JR pass. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is allowed but we have made and are making more budget-oriented videos about this trip across Japan. You can find that stuff on our Reddit profile. \n\nI hope this helps anyone who dreams of going to Japan but doesn't have a ton of money. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want more info!",

Just confirming, this was for you only right? not your girlfriend? So it would be 2x for both of you? I ask this because you use \u201cour\u201d alot.\n\nLooking at your trip it makes me really jealous. My longest trip to japan was right out of college when i had no money and knew nothing about what to do (60 days) Nowadays we have the money but no time to do more than 2 weeks",

Theres a degree of ambiguity in the post since he traveled with his girlfriend and he mentioned all in price. I think we can also agree traveling alone costs differently from traveling with someone else and cutting the cost in half as well.",

Flight costs can vary and it's your choice to leave it out - air miles can be valued at at least 1 cent per mile, but anyone can earn a bonus of 70,000 when signing up for an AA credit card with a minimum spend of around 3,000 in 3 months or so. For anyone who's not signed up for credit card bonuses for travel or simply haven't used credit, that means OP could have earned both of their's and their partner's round trip flights for spending a thousand a month in regular expenses. Asking OP to factor in that cost of regular everyday spend toward air miles is obviously stupid and I don't blame them at all for leaving that out. You mentioned it and yet someone replies below that it \"left a bad taste in their mouth\". This is a informative and useful post for this sub, the entitlement here is just silly.",

Economy availability is pretty common, but JAL only releases a couple seats to partner airlines (AA being one of them) for award bookings. You can search for availability by using the calendar view when searching award redemptions on AA's website.\n\nThrough a combination of earned points, credit card signup bonuses, and purchasing some points when AA had a ridiculous sale on them in 2020, I just used a total of 280k miles to fly my husband and I first class JFK-NRT-ITM, and am flying back in business class NRT-BOS.

You quickly learn a lot of places are tourist traps and aren\u2019t worth seeing imo. Yea I don\u2019t have it in me at all to quit and do that.

It is really impressive how you were able to travel this much without having a huge hole in the bank. \n\nI saw on another comment that you mentioned you quit your job to travel and I think that from your experience you could give me the advice I need. \n\nIm 22 and I recently graduated from college. I have been working for the past 6 months saving up for a trip to South East Asia. My plan was to quit my current job and travel for 2 months, the thing is, I just got invited to work in my dream job and I\u2019m struggling to decide if it\u2019s worth to pass this opportunity and travel or start working from now and save up more money for a better trip in the future (I already have my round trip to Japan booked but it is refundable). \n\nI would appreciate any type of advice you could give me!",

I don't know how much time you have but I don't think what we did would be helpful to someone planning a holiday.  \n\n\nTokyo/Kyoto/Osaka is the main tourist route for a reason. If you had more time and money I have heard Kanazawa is interesting (tried to go but trains got cancelled). Hokkaido is always fun (even in the snow), Hakodate is one of my favorite cities in Japan.   \n\n\nIf you want to see exactly what we did you can check my profile we are posting a 30-45 second daily vlog of our rail pass journey on Tiktok/IG/YT.",

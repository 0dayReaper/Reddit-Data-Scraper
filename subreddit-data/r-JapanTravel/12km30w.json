    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m doing a South Korea-Japan trip in July and I want to take the ferry between Busan and Fukuoka. I\u2019ve been checking the JR Beetle for months and they still do not have any available ferries for July and I\u2019m getting nervous about this. Does anyone if they will work in July? Or is there any other good ferry recommendations?\n\nThank you!",

It\u2019s think they release the schedule quarterly, it was only for Jan-March when I purchased for this March. Next quarter would be April-June, so it may be a little while before they release July.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about getting seats unless you are particular about where you sit. There were plenty of empty seats on the ferry I took (it was Wednesday though which is one of the least popular travel days).\n\nThey do offer the ferry in either the morning or afternoon depending on the day, so that might be troublesome for scheduling. But you should be okay booking your hotel.\n\nAlso Camellia Line offers a longer service and was open when I purchased. They are overnight from Busan to Fukuoka only (daytime the other direction).",

    "postText": "I know car accidents are generally something you should avoid and all but Japan really made it a pain in the ass. We sideswiped a rock, all by our lonesome, no other cars involved. Didn't think much of it beyond godammit, I gotta pay that deductible now. So we get done with our day and call the accident hotline for the rental car. I get done with that, which took a bit but I expected that. But then they tell us to call the police and make a report. I do that, and they say that they are coming out. Half an hour later they come out to our hotel. We are already out there but they feel the need to go get the man at the front desk. They spend 45 minutes to an hour asking questions, making a report and taking pictures and measurements of the damage. The front desk man thinks the whole thing is hilarious and we get some serious side eye from a group of old ladies. And last but not least they make us drive them to the scene of the accident. And during this whole time I can't help but to think about how I would get laughed out of the station if I tried to make a report like that in the US. But yeah it was an extra big pain in the ass. Avoid narrow roads everyone.",

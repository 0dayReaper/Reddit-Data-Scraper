    "postText": "Posting again, including the planning I\u2019ve done.  Hope I've done it right this time!\n\nFirst, thanks for all the advice so far. Amazing subreddit.\n\nLooking for advice for my style of travel.  \n\nMy general list places to visit are included, with no particular date to be there.  Generally, I am not a huge fan of Shrines, Temples, Castles, Disney, USJ.  \n\nI\u2019ve been to Tokyo and Kyoto 5 years ago.  I LOVED walking around neighborhoods in Tokyo, respectfully admiring how people live, checking out shops/restaurants, etc.  Especially enjoying how people follow rules.  I enjoyed some tourist activities, like Robot Restaurant, Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, and Asakusa.  I was also was fascinated by Bic Camera and Yodaboshi Camera, as I\u2019m a technology nerd.\n\nKyoto was a bit overwhelming for me, as it is a tourist destination, where rules and respect quickly were abandoned.  That said, I especially enjoyed my early morning hike around Fushimi Inari Taisha, as well as the train station, and seeing the original Nintendo Playing Card building!\n\nMy request for the subreddit is to check out what I\u2019ve planned.  If there is a fun tourist activity, neighborhood, shop, or restaurant I should consider, please comment. \n\n***My Itenenary*** \n\n**Osaka April 22 \u2013 26**\n\n* Dotonbori\n* Kuromon Fish Market\n* Nakazakicho neighborhood\n* Sakai (for knife shopping) seeking advice for a place where I can have knives engraved.\n* Floating Garden Observatory\n\nRestaurants I\u2019ve learned about through travel guides which I\u2019d like to try:\n\n* Ohsho (gyoza and ramen)\n* Daruma\n* Udon Sanku\n\nSome stores I want to visit:\n\n* Nintendo Store\n* Super Potato\n* Grizzly\n\nEspecially seeking advice for a Kobe Beef steak restaurant.\n\n**Tokyo April 27 \u2013 May 3**\n\n* Ameyoko Market\n* Nakano Broadway\n* Tsukiji Market\n* Daikanyama\n* Shibuya\n* Shenjuku\n* Farmers Market at United Nations University\n* Jiyugaoka neighborhood. \n* Shimokitazawa neighborhood\n\nMy fav ramen is Oreryu Shio Ramen in Shibuya, so I\u2019ll be eating here a few times.\n\nA friend mentioned Ninja Cafe?  Is this worth it?\n\nEspecially seeking advice on sushi restaurants. Standup, conveyer, or something fancier.\n\nLast, I have saved my SUICA card from my last trip, is it worth transferring to my iPhone or should I keep it just as a card?\n\nThanks so much for any advice. Looking forward to my trip!",

You can transfer it to a mobile Suica but you need an Amex or Mastercard to top up mobile Suica. Visa is not working right now with Japanese apps/websites but using a physical Visa at registers in Japan is no problem.  It\u2019s just an online/app incompatibility with Visa currently.",

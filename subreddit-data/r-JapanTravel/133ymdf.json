I have been lurking on this subreddit for months to learn from you all and the helpful tips have motivated me enough to finally make an account and request your feedback on our trip plans!\n\nTo begin:\n\n* Planning on getting pocket wifi in the airport after arrival\n* Purchased 7-day JR passes to cover our travel between cities and plan to use SUICA in Tokyo - traveling with only carry-ons so not planning to forward luggage\n* In Tokyo we are staying in the Waters Takeshiba area\n* We love sports and nature/sites - very low maintenance when it comes to food so will likely rely on convenience here or things we stumble upon that look good\n* Planning to take an early to bed early to rise approach for the first 5 days to assist with jetlag and to beat the crowds\n\nWe are primarily interested in feedback on the following:\n\n1. Are there any 'watch-outs' you all think we should be aware of with current itinerary items?\n2. Does any part of the itinerary seem logistically impossible?\n3. Any specific recommendations around Hikone or Miyajima areas\n4. Any other comments you think may be helpful!\n\n**May 7 - Arrive in Tokyo (HND) @ 3:55 PM**\n\n* Haneda Airport to Shinagawa Station to Kyoto Station (19:40 departure from Shinagawa Station), check into hotel in Kyoto\n\n**May 8 - Kyoto**\n\n* Arashiyama\n* Tenryu-ji\n* Kameyama park\n* Gioji\n* Return to hotel to wander around  \n**May 9 - Osaka**\n* Universal Studios Japan\n\n**May 10 - Kyoto**\n\n* Fushimi Inari Taisha\n* Hikone\n* Gion/Kiyomizu-dera\n\n**May 11 - Kyoto to Hiroshima**\n\n* Train to Hiroshima Station/Drop luggage at hotel\n* Costco\n* Shukukeien Garden\n* Peace Memorial Park and surrounding area\n\n**May 12 - Hiroshima to Miyajima**\n\n* Staying in Hiroshima - leave on San-yo Line to Miyajimaguchi Station @ 6:25\n* Itsukushima Jinja\n* Train back to Hiroshima, grab bags from hotel, train to Tokyo\n\n**May 13 - Tokyo**\n\n* Shibuya\n* Good Town Doughnuts\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Daikanyama T-Site\n* Yoyogi National Gymnasium\n* Animate\n\n**May 14 - Tokyo**\n\n* Akasaka\n* Kashima Antlers game\n* Tokyo Swallows game\n\n**May 15 - Tokyo**\n\n* Senso-ji Temple\n* Ryogoku Kokugikan National Sumo\n* Akihabara\n\n**May 16 - Tokyo**\n\n* TeamLab Planets in the morning\n* Open rest of the day for whatever we want to add or go back to\n\n**May 17 - Depart Tokyo from HND @ 17:45**\n\n* Open day to do whatever we may have missed\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback!",

    "postText": "Visiting Japan for the first time in late September, and I'm very excited. This is part of a 2-week tour with the 2nd half being in Korea.\n\nI realize before even posting that my itinerary is a bit whirlwind and trying to fit a lot in not too much time. It\u2019s a group trip and these were the destinations decided on by majority vote.\n\nThe purpose really is to just walk around Tokyo, Kyoto and Kawaguchiko, take in the sites and the atmosphere and most importantly, enjoy some delicious food. That\u2019s a BIG one. For each day, I\u2019ve made a list of potential food spots we\u2019d be looking to try (not all of them obviously, but at least a couple). Would love for more recommendations as well.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\n**Day 1**: Arrive in Tokyo, late afternoon. By the time we get to our accommodation, it\u2019ll be early evening. We\u2019re staying in Shinjuku, so we\u2019ll probably just walk around the neighbourhood and take in the vibes. Would like to check out Omoide Yokocho. Food spots on the list: Menya Kaijin, Sushi Zanmai, Gyukatsu Motomura\n\n**Day 2:** Explore Shibuya and Harajuku \u2013 Shibuya Sky, Meiji and circle back towards Gyoen and Yoyogi if time permits. Potential food spots: Ramen Hayashi, Udon Shin, Guykatsu Motomura, Sushi no Midori, Blacows, Viron, Yogoro\n\n**Day 3:** Leave bright and early and take the shinkansen to Kyoto. We will be staying near Kyoto Station. The first day, we will likely be checking out Higashiyama and Gion, and the various temples in the area like Fushimi Inari and Kiyomizudera, and Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka areas etc. Potential food spots: Gion Negiyaki Kana, Izuu, Yamamoto Menzou, Matsunosuke, Yamamoto Mambo\n\n**Day 4:** One more day in Kyoto. Will be checking out the south side of the city. Gonna wake up as early as possible to visit Arashiyama as I\u2019ve heard it gets crazy later in the day. Maybe check out the monkey park as well and do a little walk by the river. Will also check out Togetskuyo Bridge and Kamemeya Park. Potential food spots: Arashiyama Daizen, Unagi Hirokawa, Mister Gyoza, Suehiro\n\n**Day 5:** Back to Tokyo as early in the morning as possible. For the remainder of the trip, we will b e staying in Sumida City. Today\u2019s itinerary is Ginza and the Tsukiji area. We\u2019ll check out the market and visit TeamLabs Planets. Might make a pitstop at Ginza Itoya and Daimaru depending on time. Potential food spots: Onodera (will make reservation), Ushigoro (will make reservation), Ginza Kagari Ramen, Wagyu to Worldwide, Zeitaku Don, Kitsusenya\n\n**Day 6:** Day trip to Kawaguchiko. Not too much planned here \u2013 just wander the town, check out Oishi Park, the Pagoda with he views of Fuji, maybe go up the cable car and hit up an onsen. Depending on weather and how clear Mt Fuji is, we may switch this to Day 7\n\n**Day 7: **Last day in Japan \u2013 we\u2019re planning to spend it around Asakusa and Akihabara. Check out Senso-ji temple, walk along Nakaimise and then down to Akihabara for some of the cool electronics, gaming and manga-related stores. Potential food spots: Curry Bondy, Ayam-Ya, Grill Grand, Edo Fuji, Kamejuu, Fruits Parlor Goto, Noguchi Sengyoten\n\nDay 8 \u2013 we leave Tokyo in the morning and head for Seoul. And that\u2019s that! Thoughts? Any kind of recommendations and suggestions for cool things to see or activities to do are very welcome! And oh yes, always open to more food recs",

            "comment": "Probably not what you want to hear, but I think 7 days is too short for Kyoto to make sense, especially if you're going for a day trip to Kawaguchiko. This has caused you to overpack your Kyoto days, as well. Things are very spread out there and rushing around kind of takes away some of what makes the city so charming. It also cuts your Tokyo time significantly, which really only leaves you the basic tourist spots &amp; neighborhoods.\n\nI would think about replacing Kyoto with Kamakura. You can go for a day trip or an overnight and enjoy next door Enoshima, as well. It's not Kyoto, but it has a lot of the same characteristics that people go to Kyoto for and would, I believe, really reduce a lot of the travel-anxiety you will probably be experiencing with your current itinerary.\n\nI will say, though, at least you're not trying to make a Kyoto \"day trip\" work. It's shocking the amount of itineraries I see posted on here trying to pull that off.",

Mt Fuji visibility will be really low at that time, so it's just going to be an underwhelming town with a lake. \n\nMy honest opinion? You'll be happy to be in Japan. But you're going to leave either somewhat tired/miserable and feeling empty knowing you could've done much better with those 7 days.",

I'd recommend doing the Shibuya sky instead, it's an open air observatory and I thought the open air experience was way better (you'll prob need a ticket in advance)  \nDay 3: if you plan to do all of Fushimi Inari this seems extremely tight, if you're ok rearranging it is open 24 hours",

                            "comment": "Unfortunately Arashiyama and Fushimi Inari are both quite out of the way and on opposite sides of Kyoto, if you did both on the same day you'd have about 90 minutes of transit between them. If you're ok with the transit I think Arashiyama &gt; Fushimi Inari would be the perfect day. You're not really supposed to eat on the transit but there's nothing stopping you from having lunch at a station or something and continuing your journey. The Gion area (Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka) &gt; Kiyomizudera area is quite densely packed with shops, and it's basically next to downtown.  \nIf you don't want to do the forest and shrine on the same day I'd say Fushimi Inari &gt; Gion &gt; Kiyomizudera and you can work your way back to your hotel through the downtown area for a bit",

Also saves you the cost of the return train. Flight connections between Kansai and other Asian airports tend to be much better than to ones outside Asia.",

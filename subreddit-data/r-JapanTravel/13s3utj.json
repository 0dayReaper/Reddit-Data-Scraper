Would like to have a day trip to Fuji but I'm not sure the weather in early June would cooperate. Is Early June good for Fuji, Lake Kawaguchi, etc.\n*Would also like to know people's opinion on best day trip from Tokyo.\n* If you would not suggest a day trip, Any suggestions to fill in this day in Tokyo are valuable. Ginza is recommended online but I'm not too fond of expensive places, and I would like to visit Tsukiji Fish Market so I would like to know if there are interesting nearby areas?\n\nDAY 6\n* Departure - We leave at 11 am so we'll take our time in the morning to just rest and explore.",

            "comment": "We stayed at WeBase Hakata Hostel, right near Nakasukawabata station. Booked a private twin room, but were upgraded to one with 4 beds. The rooms are quite small but extremely clean and modern. The beds are comfortable. There was also a free, but very basic, breakfast. Best of all, it only cost us about 2400 yen per person and night. Our cheapest stay in Japan and we definitely paid a lot more for worse hotels. I'd stay there again for a short stay, and definitely recommend it if you mainly want a place to sleep.",

Dining options are also good but not as good as Tenjin\u2019s. But if you\u2019re more invested on staying in Fukuoka, Tenjin is a better option since the crazy huge underground mall and the buzzing Nakasu district are within walking distance.",

            "comment": "Learned the hard way that there are two Daiwa Roynet hotels near Gion station that are across the street from each other.  One is old work small unit baths (so cheaper) but the one across the street is a new hotel with the large shower/bath/wet rooms.  If your budget allows, opt for the new hotel over the old one. \n\n- [New Daiwa Roynet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GqRTPA2EvRUqnLKW9?g_st=ic)\n- [Old Daiwa Roynet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hwpGGjtUJ63AkoTS7?g_st=ic)\n\nGood general tip to always look carefully at the photos of the bathrooms as that will tell you if it\u2019s an old location of a hotel chain or one of their new builds. Particularly helpful if you\u2019d prefer to avoid the [small unit bathrooms.](https://resources.realestate.co.jp/living/japanese-apartment-bathrooms-explained/)",

Aside from being close to the station, it was well located for most of the other sites via the subway and walking. It\u2019s off the main roads, so was very quiet.",

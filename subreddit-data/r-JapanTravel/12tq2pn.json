    "postText": "Finally went back with 2 companions, 1 of them was her first time to japan. From 30th march to 13th april.\n\n1st day: Landed in KIX at noon, queued for 1 hour to get JR tickets to hotel. 10/10 would not want to repeat this again. Didnt do much the first day.\n\n2nd day: Kyoto. Did the whole kimono, bamboo forest, arashiyama thingy again. 10/10 would not want to repeat. hot, massive crowds, subpar sights and food. pro tip, book your kimono shop near the attractions you plan to visit for your photos, arashiyama was a tad far away from kyoto station.\n\n3rd day: Dotonbori for street food, takoyaki was good. rest were meh. had lunch at Tonkatsu Manger, another meh. went to visit himeji castle with the cherry blossoms, this one was decent. would recommend.\n\n1-3 pics: [https://imgur.com/a/EvzvEI0](https://imgur.com/a/EvzvEI0)\n\n4th-6th day: flew to miyakojima in the morning. loved it. nice beaches, chill vibe, had a car so it was convenient.  I could stare at the ocean for a few hours. Nice chilly weather, soothing sounds and rhythmic motion  of the crashing waves. Managed to get in some snorkeling done on the 2nd day. Miyakojima was really pog, local izakaya was good, cheap and the service staff were so friendly. Glad i made the effort to go there. Took the morning flight to tokyo on the 3rd day there.\n\nMiyakojima: [https://imgur.com/a/9TFH6kG](https://imgur.com/a/9TFH6kG)\n\n6th-9th day: Reached tokyo around 3pm. spent there eating mostly and Disneyland. Disneyland was pog. Tokyo food is really good. I had sushi, yakiniku, ramen, desserts, grilled seafood. yea major yums. generally, i realised the food in tokyo compared to other cities is much better. Took a late train to kofu, sent my luggage over.\n\nTokyo Food:  [https://imgur.com/a/SOpn8MK](https://imgur.com/a/SOpn8MK)\n\n9th-10th day: Kofu, Wanted to visit the wineries but oh my god all the vineyards were bare. I forgot about the seasons. Anyway tried their wines but it was nothing good imo, really dry. Drove down to kawaguchiko the next day, to see mt fuji. got really lucky, it was a wonderful day to see mt fuji, so clear for the entire day. also visited shiraito falls and ended the day at shizuoka. \n\nPics: [https://imgur.com/a/5YpULIR](https://imgur.com/a/5YpULIR)\n\n11th-12th day: Had a morning breakfast at the Shizuoka seafood market but it was disappointing. We took the train to Ito before getting onto a car. Visited dolphins and went for my ryokan stay. One of the highlights of my trip. The next day we just drove around ito before heading back to tokyo.\n\nPics: [https://imgur.com/a/hQkVcpP](https://imgur.com/a/hQkVcpP)\n\n13-14th day: Final 2 days in Tokyo, visited disney sea and managed to sneak in a ramen lunch for my final day before heading back on my afternoon flight.\n\nPics: [https://imgur.com/a/TTFJ78n](https://imgur.com/a/TTFJ78n)\n\nThing I wanna do on my next trip, visit the northen part of japan more i guess. aomori,nagoya. Gonna visit more of the islands as well, wanna go back to kamikochi too. Hope this was helpful.",

So i figured rather than fiddling with the ticket machine when i was on a tight timeline i might as well interact with their service staff.\n\nyou can use ur credit card.\n\nyes that tuna is heavenly, its literally wagyu of the sea when done right. good luck !",

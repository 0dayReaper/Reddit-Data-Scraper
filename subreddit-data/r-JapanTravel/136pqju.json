    "postText": "Fianc\u00e9 and I went to USJ yesterday (the day before Golden Week started, although some locals may have taken Mon/Tues off too). \n\nHere\u2019s what our experience was like:\n\n- Park hours were 8:00 AM open. I wanted to get there earlier to get into Super Nintendo World without an express pass. We ended up arriving around 7:45 and lots of people were already in the park so they must have opened gates at 7. The queue to get in was not bad at all though, honestly 10 min max. \n\n- Forgot that you\u2019re not technically supposed to bring food inside the park \u2014 we bought some from 7-Eleven outside the station but we bypassed the bag check by chance since the food was in our jacket pockets. \n\n- As soon as we got in, I used the USJ app to get Area Timed Entry tickets and saw 10 and 11 AM available. We opted for 10 AM and selected the only slot which was for 10:40. \n\n- We did a couple things with no wait. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like roller coasters so we did the Amazing Spider-man 4D experience (so fun!) and the JJK 4D show (all in Japanese, waiting longer than 15 min wouldn\u2019t be worth it IMO)\n\n- It was about 10 AM when we tried getting into Nintendo World and the ticket officer let us in. There\u2019s a stand for the power bands right past the gate which will likely have a queue \u2014 there\u2019s many more inside the park that probably won\u2019t. Go there instead. \n\n- We personally enjoyed having the bands, it gave us a lot to do just by looking at the available stamps and how to get them. That said, without them, you\u2019d only miss out on the \u201ckey missions\u201d and the Bowser Jr. activity, which are all fun but not regrettable to miss. \n\n- This area was definitely more packed than the rest of USJ in the morning, but nothing unbearable, at least compared to Canada\u2019s Wonderland. For example, the wait to Mario Kart (which was SO good) was a bit longer than an hour wait but the line moves fast and the themed area is entertaining enough. Most people would probably find the express pass to be worth it though. \n\n- We got to Toad\u2019s caf\u00e9 around noon and were given tickets for 2:30. Recommended to go to the caf\u00e9 as soon as you enter the area so you can do everything else while you wait. \n\n- The food was cute and pretty good. Portions are tiny though. If you can\u2019t get in early enough, I\u2019d consider getting food elsewhere in the park (after you do everything you want in this area - cant return after leaving)\n\n- By noon the wait times were pretty much what has been shared already; over an hour. There are water fountains in the line and fans for hotter days, but my back was about to give out lol\n\nOverall, I was happy to spend all of the trip there. If we did roller coasters, the express pass would definitely be worth it and probably necessary. In our case, I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t buy them \u2014 made the power band fee a little easier to stomach :)",

There's a japanese site that predicts crowd levels, but you can google translate the page to English: https://usjinfo.com/wait/pre_callendar.php\n\nIf you go during off season you don't need an express pass, just line up more than 1 hour before opening (because as OP mentioned, sometimes they let people in early) and you can most likely get into Super Nintendo World immediately without a timed entry.  \n\nMy recommended path is Mario Kart -&gt; Toads Cafe -&gt; Harry Potter world -&gt; other roller coasters but of course it's up to preference. You can easily hit up all the big rides *without* an express pass in one day if you don't go on busy days.  \n\nPark is still quite busy even in 'off season' on a weekday though. Also restaurants just outside the park are really good but get crowded after closing.  \n\nAlso hotels nearby aren't too expensive at all, we stayed at Hotel Universal Port and it was cheaper than most AirBNBs at around $60 per person / night, the convenience in the morning is worth it.",

According to that site it's fairly empty though so we must have got lucky.",

With the app, it gives you goals and challenges to chase in Mario kart and Yoshi's Adventure. Not to mention some scavenger hunt stuff like finding all the pixel art hidden in Super Nintendo World, spotting Rosalina with he binoculars, competing on the score board for a high score, finding all the coin blocks etc.",

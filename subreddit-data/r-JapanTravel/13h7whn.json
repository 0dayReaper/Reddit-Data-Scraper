I\u2019m not really sure of the stay at the buddhist temple- we\u2019ll have to wake up at 4am to experience the fire prayer, and that would probably destroy us with the added jetlag  \n5. I\u2019m a vegetarian,my partner is not- so any restaurant recommendations would be hugely appreciated.  \nMany thanks in advance for taking the time to read through this long ass post",

That said, you'd probably enjoy the Advertising Museum too. \n\nDo you know if there's anything worth seeing along the Meguro River since the cherry blossom season is long gone?\n\nRegarding veggie food, I'm not sure what your budget or preferences are. Cheap chain restaurants generally have something veggie-friendly; if you're looking for more traditional/fancier places it's going to require a lot more planning. I have an itinerary in my profile where I talk about this.",

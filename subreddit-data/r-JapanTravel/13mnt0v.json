    "postText": "Here is my report. Number of travellers - 2. Interests: Nature, manga, art. Japanese language level: 0.\n\nPre-arrangements besides accommodation/travel bookings:\n\n1. Ordered Wise card. Arrived in 2-3 weeks. \n2. Ordered 10GB data from Ubigi (phone needs to be compatible). \n3. Arranged special meal - vegan with WestJet airlines. By default they serve meat or vegetarian meals only.\n4. Downloaded Google Translate Japanese - English offline. \n5. Read \"Convenience Store Woman\" book before flight and in plane I started \"The Nakano Thrift Shop\". This book goes well when you are sleepy, and I think Convenience Store Woman makes you understand the culture better. So recommending both books but especially the first one. \n6. I bought \"Japan: A Travel Guide for Vegans\" e-book by Jesse Duffield but didn't read it much to be honest. The parts that I read were helpful though.\n7. Got International Drivers Permit from CAA (I have a Canadian license). \n8. Contacted Yes Yakushima to rent a car in Yakushima. \n\nDay 1 - Narita\n\nLanded in Narita by 16:30 in Terminal 1. I had 2 hours before my friend arrived by a different plane. I exchanged some cash and spent this time running around trying to activate my Wise card.  Instructions said to use the pin code while making a purchase to activate it. So I bought a kelp rice ball in the convenience store on the basement/train floor, but my card didn't go through (had to pay with cash in the end). I asked information desk, but they didn't know about this card, so I bought a coffee in Starbucks. That didn't activate my card either, so I sat down in Starbucks and drank my coffeee and ate my rice ball in a wrong way. There are instructions of how to open the rice ball, but I was too overwhelmed, so I ate the rice and the seaweed separately. \n\nI googled about Wise card, and I found that you need to activate it with ATM. I remembered there was a guy using pink ATM (Aeon?) right where we were waiting for our baggage/doing customs, so I think you can activate it right there. I spent some time trying to find an ATM, in the end I went back to the information desk and they were happy to point me to the machines. I finally activated my card with Aeon ATM and took a free shuttle bus to Terminal 2 to meet my friend.\n\nOnce they arrived, we bought Suica cards. It didn't accept Wise card so we paid in cash. We took Keisei New Line subway and went to Asia Hotel Narita, just 1 station away from the airport. It was a bit confusing which train to take, but there was someone who took a pity on us and confirmed that we were on the right track. \n\nThere were lots of stairs from the station to the hotel, and there was another station with more stairs on our way. We dragged our baggage by hand. The next day I noticed there were elevators, so I think you can avoid stairs after all. \n\nAfter checking in, we bought some food in a Family Mart nearby and went to bed. This hotel had a shared fridge on our floor and a shared microwave on the next floor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 2 - Narita\n\nNext morning we took a train to Boso-no-Mura. It was just 1 station away from Narita Station and you see a beautiful scenery with rice fields and calm environment. Then you walk for about half hour. The trees were gorgeous and we found a secluded shrine on a hill. On our way we also passed a park full of families doing a day camping. Boso-no-Mura was also very busy with families with young children, doing all kinds of activities. I was thinking to rent a kimono as it was advised in a Narita travel video, but it was a warm day and I was already sweating, and it was crowded, so I opted out. I think the price range was 30,00-50,00 yen for a rental. \n\nBoso-no-Mura is a huge complex, so we spent the rest of the day there. We returned to Narita close to the sunset and walked down the Otomesando street and visited Naritasan Shinsho-ji. Something to note is that the sun sets early in Japan. Here in Canada it sets after 8pm, there after 6pm, in May. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 3 - Kagoshima \n\nWe woke up early to catch our 8am flight to Kagoshima. Google maps was acting weird, so we were a bit confused which station we need to go to. There is Narita station and there is Keisei Narita station. We ended up going to Keisei Narita, but there was a train from Narita station as well (Google was just showing that next train departs in an hour, but then later it was showing that next train departs sooner). \n\nWe flew with Jetstar and arrived in Kagoshima shortly after 10am. Unfortunately, there was no time to experience the foot bath outside the airport, because our bus was departing already. We checked in a ryokan in Kagoshima and went to have a lunch in Indigo restaurant. This was a small kitchen operated by 1 person only. As noted in \"Japan: A Travel Guide for Vegans\" book, these kinds of restaurants are extremely vulnerable to go out of business, because it's usually a passion project of someone working a second job. If they are closed on the day you arrive, please don't leave them a negative review just because of that. Anyway. The food was great. There was no menu - just a soup and then a full plate of different kinds of food.\n\nNext we went to the museum to see the permanent exhibition. It was just 3 or 4 rooms and it was underwhelming to be honest. Entry was 300 yen, but I feel like we wasted our time. And you couldn't take pictures (this was the case with most museums and even some stores later in Tokyo). \n\nNext we took a ferry to Sakurajima. I forgot to mention that it was raining hard. So hard that rain jackets were not enough, so we appreciated the offer of umbrellas from our host. On the Sakurajima island, we took one-before-the-last tour bus to the observatory. I am very bad in meteorology, so I thought you could see the volcano from there, but it was still covered with clouds. The bus waited at the observatory for about 10 minutes before going back to the station. We and few other tourists took pictures of... grey cloud walls around us, but it was still cool. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 4 - Yakushima - Waterfalls\n\nWe walked to the ferry station to go to Yakushima. We were greeted by an employee informing us that the ferry was cancelled. He redirected us to the Jetfoil station nearby and let us know that the next ship to Miyanoura departs at 13:00. We went to Jetfoil station and found the earlier ship to Anbo departing at 10:00AM. They had only first class (?) seats left, so we had to pay 1000 yen extra. We were seated in the front of the ship, but all we could see were grey walls again because of the weather. In the end of the trip, the ship was doing some crazy moves on the waves so that was cool at least. \n\nSomething I forgot to mention is that on our way to ferry station, we saw Sakurajima for like 5 minutes. There was a cloud on the sea and I thought the cloud was going down, but it actually went up and covered the volcano again. These few minutes were the only time we saw Sakurajima.\n\nI also informed Yes Yakushima that our plans had changed and now we were arriving in Anbo. They were very fast in communicating and let us know that because Miyanoura and Anbo are too far away, we would have to take a bus to get to Miyanoura. They gave us exact time of bus departure and overall they were very helpful. I felt bad for not booking a tour with them, but hope they get a commission from car rentals. \n\nThe bus from Anbo to Miyanoura was 1000 or 2000 yen per person. So keep in mind this extra cost that may occur due to the weather. Ferry that got cancelled was supposed to cost 5600, and Jetfoil cost 13200 per person + bus. \n\nWe reached Destino car rental office in Miyanoura. They are running a gas station/car wash, car rental, and a cafe-bar at the same time. We had to wait for a while and then I had a brief introduction to our car - how to start it, how to activate parking break, and that's it - the employee had to run back to the bar. \n\nI was expecting a more thorough tutorial, but actually not much was needed. The speed limit within cities is 40, outside - 50. The lines and street signs are marked vividly. The road conditions are great. There was a charger and a dash cam in our car. \n\nWe took our car straight to our accommodation - Morino Kokage cottage near Anbo. It was 15:00 and the check in was at 16:00. We were allowed early check in. The host gave us a tour to this little village of cottages. He was friendly but the way he was talking was a bit artificial. I think he had memorized sentences he repeats to each customer, and if you had watched a few horror movies in your life, you imagination might go wild. But if you had read Convenience Store Woman you will know that this kind of customer service is normal in Japan and no, you won't stumble upon a sinister ritual in the middle of the village when you return back at night. Everything is gonna be alright. \n\nNext, we went to the grocery store Ban Chan and we ate in the parking lot in the back seats of our car. The car had enough room, with tables and cup holders, so it was convenient. \n\nAt 17:45, 15 minutes before closing, we reached Yakushima Anbo Tourist Information center.  I should mention that there was one right turn on intersection where I turned into the wrong lane, but there were no incoming cars, so everything was fine! \n\nThey didn't speak English in tourism center, but they were still helpful. They also have brochures and travel books for Yakushima that you can pick up for free. I asked about Jomon Sugi trail, and they recommended not to go there right after the heavy rain. I already knew from Yes Yakushima website  that the best trail after rainfall is Yakusugi Land, because they have bridges and even if water goes up, it's gonna be safe. \n\nNext we went to Ryujin Falls and Senpiro Falls Observation Deck. This is something I saw in Wanderlust Alley vlog - you can visit these waterfalls if you don't have a full day and you are close to Anbo. It was already getting dark and it was raining heavily. I guess it was not the safest thing to drive in these conditions, but because we were driving slowly - it felt fine. Once we turned to the waterfalls, the only car we saw was a red sport car. The owner lived on the same mountain. We met this car in the following days in the city as well. It was memorable because they were driving fast and were doing maneuvers.\n\nWe exited the car at the Ryujin Falls and found ourselves in the ankle-high water. We were a bit worried about the car, but we had loads of food from Ban Chan, so that was giving us some confidence. There were only some places where the water was this high, overall it was still safe to drive. We wore rain jackets, but we didn't have umbrellas. \n\nNext we drove up to the Senpiro Falls Observation Deck. After the washrooms go to the right to see the waterfall. We spent last moments of daylight there and went back to our car using flash lights from our phones. \n\nOn the way back, I pulled over to see some weird structure of electricity (?), and almost ended in a road trench. Overall, the drive was intense on the narrow road to and from the waterfalls, mainly because of these trenches. Especially at night. \n\nFinally we arrived at our accommodation and the best thing was the shoe drying machine we had in our room! This and the toilet noise cancelling devices were the best inventions I have seen in Japan! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 5 - Yakushima - Museum and Yakusugi Land\n\nWe visited Yakusugi Museum in the morning. The entrance fee was 600 yen. It's an interactive museum where you learn a lot about Jomon Sugi and the cedars in general. You can take pictures and overall I think it's worth visiting. There I also decided we are gonna skip Jomon Sugi trail. We only had 3 days and the museum gave us enough sense and feeling of Jomon Sugi. So the plan changed to Yakusugi Land on the same day, driving around the island the next day, and Shiratani Unsuikyo for the last day. \n\nIn the souvenir shop I bought some cute wooden animal keychains, local orange jam, and a wooden clock. I first  saw this clock near the washrooms, and was happy to find it in the gift shop later. I think the price was 2400. I declared both the clock and the jam to the customs on entry to Canada and they were chill about it. Now the clock hangs on my wall and reminds me of Yakushima &lt;3 \n\nAfter museum we went to Yakusugi Land. On our way we stumbled upon families of monkeys for the first time. I pulled over and after a while a car passed us really fast. That's when I realized it's a common occurrence for locals, monkeys there are like squirrels and bunnies in Canada. First you get excited, then you get used to it. \n\nYakusugi Land entrance fee was 500 yen. Ticket comes with a brochure with a map, same one you can pick up at the Tourism center. We took the longest route that was supposed to take us 210 minutes (3.5 hours) for 4.4km. But it actually takes much longer if you look around, take pictures, etc. There was also an option to hike another 2km to the Mt. Tachu, but we would run out of day light and we were not prepared for such a long hike. Overall, it took us around 5-6 hours. We had a lunch we had ordered from our host - a bento that has 2 vegan rice balls - plain rice and plum. The rest of the bento content went to my friend who eats meat. I also had packed a sandwich I made myself with tofu, bread, and tomato. There was 1 kind of sliced bread in Ban Chan that had no animal ingredients. You will know which one because it looks like a normal yeast bread. There was no knife in our accommodation, but I took it from home with a hiking cutting board and a wrapping paper. (Knife goes in checked-in baggage obviously). \n\nIf you choose the longest route in Yakusugi land, it's physically demanding. You are climbing a mountain. The trail is marked really well with pink ribbons. There were still some moments, especially on the way down, where it took me few moments to figure out where the trail was. Overall I think it's a safe trail and if you pay attention you won't get turned around. There were places where there was no cell service, so if you own a GPS beacon already, I would  recommend you bring it with you or let someone know where you are going. There was 1 toilet close to the peak, but it was only for the disposable packages. We forgot/couldn't find where to buy them in the trail head, so we kept our water intake low. There was no indicated streams or pipes to refill water bottle either, but there are lots of streams and as I read on internet the water is safe to drink there. We met many people on our way. You meet fewer people in the late afternoon, because most of them rely on buses. It was common to greet and thank fellow hikers.\n\nWe finished our trail close to the sunset. The souvenir store was closed already, but the washrooms were still open! Just wanted to mention that there are shorter routes on this trail. It's around the river and it has wooden or stone pavement. It's less demanding physically and you can go back to trail head for the washroom sooner. There are some gorgeous cedars right from the beginning. \n\nOn our drive back we stopped to watch more monkeys. There are also some great views from this mountain road and lots of places to pull over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 6 - Yakushima - driving\n\nThis day we drove around the island clockwise (as recommended). We had the sightseeing spots marked in the books we picked from the Tourist center on the first day. So we knew what to look out for. There are also road signs directing you to these locations and most of them are on google maps as well. Onsen was busy as expected and the World Heritage Listed Coastal Road with Wildlife was full of monkeys as expected as well! After this road there is a section that is very narrow, but there are lots of wider areas where you and the upcoming car can pass each other. But overall it was stressful and after maneuvering you also need to manage to look in the eyes of the other driver and do a \"thank you\" bow. On this road we saw a deer, but there was a car behind us and there was also a car passing from the opposite direction so we didn't really have time to watch it. The car who passed us by the way was an elderly woman and she did it with a great ease. So I think the stress of narrow road goes away with some experience there. \n\nOverall, it took around 7 hours to drive around the island while stopping in multiple locations. Throughout the day, we ate food we bought in the morning in Ban Chan and on our way back, we noticed another big grocery store. I did a left turn at the Yakushima airport to go back to this store, but while being tired, I turned into the wrong lane. The cab driver at the airport jumped out from his car and started waving and hand signalling me to stop. There was no other traffic except me but he looked very upset. I reversed my car and got out of there quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 7 - Yakushima - Shiratani Unsuikyo\n\nThis day we hiked in Shiratani Unsuikyo. Parking was full and there was a person directing you how to park on the side of the road. Entrance was 500 yen. We took Talkoiwa Rock Round Trip Course, 5.6km or about 4 hour hike as per brochure. There were lots of people on the trail, so there were places where you couldn't really look around. As in Yakusugi Land, in late afternoon the traffic decreased. There was a washroom facility at Shiratani Mountain Hut and a water pipe to refill your bottle.   \nThe view from Tsujino-iwaya rock was awesome. \n\nSomehow we were less tired after this hike than after Yakusugi Land hike, and in the Yakushima travel book, they were recommending a sunset spot at Inakahama Beach. With the help of some cold espresso from the vending machine, I found energies to drive there. The sun set behind a closeby island. \n\nInakahama Beach is also a place where sea turtles lay their eggs. This happens at night and the posters there were advertising tours from 8pm to 11pm. It cost 2400 yen per person and it required reservation. The website on the poster was in Japanese, and I couldn't find how to book it in English. Also, I didn't really want to watch such an intimate moment of animals and the price seemed too high. But we wanted to see turtles.\n\nIn the end, right when the tourists who booked this tour and the guides started arriving, we drove away. We were contemplating for a while whether or not to turn back, but in the end we decided to go home. It was tempting since we were already there, but overall I think I didn't want to participate in such tour. Plus we were tired after the hike and we had to pack and get ready for the flight next morning. \n\nDay 8 -  Yakushima - Tokyo\n\nNext morning, we drove our car back to Destino. We filled the tank back to full at their station, so it was convenient. We paid 4100 for gas and 27 500 yen for 4 nights of car rental. They were organized to know that another customer who was returning the car had booked the same flight, so we waited for them and then they drove us together to the airport. The funny thing was that it was the same couple who we basically hiked together with the day before at Shiratani Unsuikyo, unintentionally ruining the backgrounds of each others photos, trying to either pass each other or to let go, but in the end always catching up, and now on the last day we still couldn't avoid each other!\n\nAt the airport, I was concerned that there was only 20 minutes layover from Kagoshima to Tokyo, and I had a checked in baggage. I had a previous experience with Air Canada, where I had a 45 minutes layover between Canadian cities, and when my baggage didn't arrive at the final destination, I was told by an employee \"what did you expect with such a short layover?\". But it was different with JAL, at least for the small Kagoshima airport. The flight got delayed and the layover was even shorter, but they still championed to move my baggage to the next plane and the gate was also conveniently placed right next to the exit from the Yakushima plane. \n\nIn Kagoshima plane, I had a window seat on the right, number K. And I was able to see Sakurajima from the air! I guess you can see it from the left window as well, but it was on the right side. \n\nSomething else I want to mention is that there was a very cute box of tea cakes in Yakushima airport. It was for 700 yen I think. The biscuits were not vegan themselves, but you can use the hard paper box to store your stationary or something else as another memory of this island. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 8 - Tokyo - Shibuya and Meiji Jingu\n\nWe started exploring Tokyo with Shibuya Sky as we were located 2 stops away from Shinjuku Station, so it was in the same area. My friend booked the tickets beforehand as they sell out. I think it was a great start to see Tokyo from above (52th floor). We also went to Meiji Jingu and the souvenir shop there is a high quality. If you visit it in the beginning of your trip, I recommend you buy your Japan themed souvenirs there, as I couldn't find Japan made quality souvenirs anywhere else (Later in the trip, I spent only few hours in Asakusa, and the stores there were selling cheap quality products, made not in Japan).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 9 - Tokyo - Contemporary Art Museum\n\nWe took a train to Mori Art museum. The current theme is school subjects, and in the beginning there is a room about politics and history. There are photos of bomb ponds in Cambodia, depressing reading of the speech of Indian president, photos of public execution places in Syria, and a half hour documentary about sketch artists in Vietnam. I recommend watching this movie, it's called Light and Belief by Dinh. Q Le. I just found it on Youtube as well. It shows Vietnam war from a different perspective and I personally learnt a lot. \n\nThen there is a movie about US propaganda video of Japanese school children during World War II and modern Japanese youth reacting to war crimes footage. And then the exhibition continues with \"philosophy\", \"math\", \"science\", \"music\" subjects. I personally couldn't enjoy any of it because of heavy topics in the history room. That room was very impactful and meaningful, and then rooms full of \"just because\" artworks didn't click with me anymore. Me and my friend discussed it later whether or not it would be better if this room was in the end, but I think overall it was kinda out of place compared to the rest of the exhibition. So maybe it's actually better if you don't watch the Vietnam documentary while you are there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 10 -  Tokyo - Manga museum and Ikebokuro\n\nWe took a train to Toshima City Tokiwaso Manga Museum. Entrance was 500 yen and it included a surprise pin from the current exhibition on the first floor. Both me and my friend are into drawing comics, so we found this museum educational and inspiring. I really wished you could take pictures of exhibition though! You can take pictures of permanent exhibition on the second floor only. \n\nThe rest of the day we spent in Ikebokuro, since it's in the same area. We visited Animate, K-books, and Mandarake stores. Mandarake was in the basement and it was mostly self-published lewd manga of other manga or western comics if that makes sense. K-books was mostly pins of currently published famous manga/anime. \n\nWe had an impression that Animate was mostly B-love manga. It had merch of currently airing anime/manga as well, including sketchbooks, erasers, etc, which was nice. However, the lighting was really strong in that store and overall we felt overwhelmed and it affected our sleep that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 11 - Tokyo - Shinjuku\n\nWe explored Shinjuku and I spent more than 100 00 yen in Sekaido art supplies store. It's just Japanese art supplies are much cheaper there than when you order it from overseas. So I stocked up with markers and sketchbooks for good, also found some new kind of markers and organizers you can't find in local art stores here in Canada, so if you are into arts definitely recommend visiting this store and going to upper floors. \n\nWe also tried Wired Bonbon near Shinjuku station. It was amazing and as a vegan I felt very happy. We took a full course that was for 2200 yen. It included salad or soup, half size main dish, full size desert, and a drink. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 12 - Tokyo - Akihabara\n\nThis day we went to Akihabara with great expectations, but ended up really exhausted and frustrated. I think if you are looking for something that is not being published/airing right now, you might find yourself in a bad place. I was able to get some merch, but I couldn't buy anything worth buying with my fave manga character and I couldnt get any \"promised\" gifts to my friends of other older characters. There were some what I understood used options of figures, but the quality was questionable and the prices were high. I found a figurine of my fave character, but the face was wrong and it was obvious it was a \"fake\" copy. \n\nHowever, I found Ghibli art books for 2500 yen. I bought Totoro and Nausicaa art books. They also had Spirited Away and Laputa. It was heavy and on the last day when I had to carry my suitcase I regretted this purchase a bit. Sketchbooks and these art books made my baggage much heavier. \n\nI also bought a Yona cup ring for 400 yen of some pop up cafe from the past as I understood, and Akutagawa 2D figure stand from Bungo Stray dogs for 1700 yen. This is a standard price for new 2D figures. On the first floor of the same mall there was a gift shop with anime themed sweets, and I bought a tin jar of cookies with Spy Family on it (again for the box).\n\nOverall, we didnt feel accomplished in the end of the day. By sunset, there were tired tourists laying on the ground on the streets as they were no benches to sit anywhere and tired \"maids\" still trying to distribute flyers for their cafes. \n\nI think my advise is - first of all, don't give specific promises to anyone or to yourself. Yes, you might find a figurine from a show that was running 10+ years ago. But it will be used, fake, and/or super expensive. Also, we were not able to find much of shojo merch at all. My friend was looking for Kamisama Kiss and I was looking for Kimi Ni Todoke - we found nothing. That Yona cup ring was a rare find I guess. There were cup rings of other characters from the same show, but they were more expensive for some reason (I guess more rare from collectioners point of view?). We visited all the stores we found recommended in several articles on the internet and ended up with this impression.\n\nWe had lunch at Kyushu Jangara Ramen. It was alright and you get to experience a traditional ramen shop. There were people in suits lined up in queue when we left, so it felt like we visited an important place. \n\nAfter Akihabara we returned to Wired Bonbon on our way back home. This time we took a seat by the window and it had a view on Shinjuku station. We combined the deal menu with the regular menu this time, and in the end they made a mistake in the receipt. My friend communicated it with them politely and they fixed it right away. \n\nDay - 13 Tokyo - Harajuku - Team Lab \n\nFor this day my friend had booked us tickets for Team Lab. We started our morning in Harajuku. There is a Hatchiko bus that runs between Shinjuku, Harajuku and Shibuya. The fixed price is 100 yen so if it's close to your accommodation, it might be worth taking it. It gets crowded but not too much. In Harajuku there was one anime shop on the second floor of a lingerie shop. We went there and bought some last minute anime souvenirs because of our \"promises\". Somehow this store looked better than all of Akihabara and I found an official pin of my favourite character for a reasonable price. I didn't want to buy it, but I got it because it was so hard to find anything of this character. So there is this psychological moment that kicks in when you try to buy anime merch there. \"At least something\" moment. \n\nI also bought a shirt and a bow from a store called Noemie in Harajuku. I was inspired by Japanese fashion trend and wanted to get something in this style. The clothes are made in China. They are reasonably priced and you can try them on before buying. My shirt was 3200 yen and the bow with a heart shaped crystal on it was for 1600. To view a quality Lolita clothes, there is a mall called OIOI in Shinjuku and there is a whole floor dedicated to this style. You can't take pictures and you can't touch anything, so it's more like a free museum. \n\nIf you are a fan of Sailor Moon, there is a dedicated store in the basement of one of the malls in Harajuku. They had sailor moon themed bento boxes and a thermos among other merch. This mall had some interesting clothes as well, but we had to go to other part of Tokyo for our Team Labs appointment. \n\nTeam Labs was as touristy as it gets. Afterwards we tried the famous vegan ramen outside. The price was 800 yen higher if you wanted to eat inside, I guess in more privacy, but we chose the cheaper option. The ramen was really worth trying and it was very different from the Jangara ramen. The downside was that although we were trying to ignore the crowd around, there was someone having a loud video call with their friend nearby. At this point we were so used to more quiet Japanese society, that it was hard to ignore this noise. \n\nAfterwards, we walked in the riverside park nearby. The sun was setting in and after the days of shopping we finally found peace. What was great about Team Labs was that it made us break this frustrating and addicting loop of shopping. So I am grateful that it's located outside of shopping districts. We decided to walk as much as we could, and we ended up seeing Ginza district and Imperial garden. There was also Hibiya park just before the Imperial Palace area, and there you could put your nose in different kind of roses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 14 - Asakusa \n\nOn our last day, we took our baggage to the Asakusa station. Our flights were in the evening. The lockers in the station were full, so we tried a nearby building - Tobu station, as their website said it had more lockers. Bigger lockers were occupied there as well, but the smaller lockers for 400 yen were empty. You could place there a smaller backpack or a bag. There was also an option to store the baggage with Yamato Transport on the first floor of the same building. There is a tourist information desk if you need help locating it, but it's in the end of the first floor of Ekimise mall. You can buy Japanese sweets and handkerchiefs on this floor as well, and in the end I almost missed my flight because we got delayed by choosing last minute souvenirs there. If you buy a handkerchief, the store called Matsuya Ginza will wrap it very nicely for you.\n\nBut before this happened, we visited the famous Senso-ji temple. It was super crowded, but there were many people dressed in traditional dresses and it was nice to see them. There were lots of stores around, but as I said earlier, the quality of products was low. In the end, I couldn't find a store with same quality as Meiji Jingu store, for Japanese themed souvenirs. \n\nI ended up buying a Yukata though. With the belt it cost me 14000. I actually wanted a male yukata, similar to the one we tried in ryokan in Kagoshima, but the store ladies in female yukata store were so nice, including redirecting us to the male yukata store (which happened to have an unfriendly seller), that I decided to choose an experience over a product, so we went back and I bought a female yukata instead. This store was located on the left side of Senso-ji when you are exiting it, a parallel street to the main street. They wrapped it nicely as well. \n\nNext we went to the river park. It had a great view of Tokyo Sky tower. Then we visited Matsuchiyama Shoden and Imado Shrine. It was so peaceful at these places, with almost no tourists and few believers there only. If you have an hour and you don't like crowds, I recommend visiting these places. They are in a close proximity from each other.\n\nWhen we took our baggage and were returning to the station, I suddenly realized that we are running late. The initial plan was to take the train to Narita airport with Asakusa line. That was the cheapest option for only 1300. However, Google showed that the next train would be an hour later, so we ended up going to Ueno instead, taking Ginza line and buying Keisei Skyliner tickets there. In the end, we still got late to the airport and I think it would take me same time or even shorter if I sticked to the initial plan and took Asakusa train. It took us some time to find Skyliner station (it's outside!) and it runs once in 20 minutes only. \n\nI still got on the plane, but it was stressful and it was past the baggage drop off time when I reached the counter. Fortunately, they still accepted my suitcase!\n\n\\-------\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my trip, except the shopping fever. I want to go back and explore more of Kyushu by train and to see more islands. I dont want to ever go back to Akihabara and overall I think we had enough of Tokyo. \n\nI loved the politeness of the people there, Canadians seemed rude afterwards. All convenience stores were accepting cards (at least Wise card) and most other stores as well. Only small shops were still operating on cash only. You get used to the subway system, so you don't need your internet navigation after few days. We didn't ride Yamanote line much, and I think if you choose your accommodation few stations away from the main stations, you will be fine.  \n\nShopping districts are fast paced and might be overwhelming if you are not used to shopping or crowds. You are expected to be constantly moving and there is little to no place to rest, unless you go in somewhere for food or drinks, and those places might have queues as well. There was always a line at Starbucks for example. I don't know what I would change, because once we started shopping, we didn't want to go to any other museums. The products there have this weird psychological effect on you. It's like gambling, you think that the next store will have what you want and the stores just never end. Each building is a mall with multiple stores on each floor. And after few of such buildings your day is gone. \n\nAt least washrooms were free and they were plenty. Vending machines were plenty and drinks were cheap. Rice balls and rolls in the convenience stores were cheap, so you never go hungry. I loved that they are honest with money and the sellers don't push their products on you. I didn't find Japan creatively inspiring like you find Paris, but it's lifestyle inspiring for sure. You want to improve your routine and your style and all that afterwards. I found 2 weeks enough for one visit, and the service and sales industry there have it figured out how to communicate with you when you speak 0 Japanese. Overall, they have lots of stuff figured out and you wonder why other countries can't  be like that. \n\n10/10 trip overall. Thank you for reading!\n\nHere are some pictures: https://imgur.com/a/ZYV37Rf",

Also natto rolls, but its flavour is not for everybody.  Inari sushi was available, vegetable tempura, mushroom tempura. Some stores had fries and hash browns. \n\nYou can also find vegan bread. It's mostly baguettes. And there might be a tofu shop near your accommodation and you can get a block of fresh tofu for cheap. Our breakfast was usually tofu on bread with fresh mint. They call firm tofu hard tofu.",

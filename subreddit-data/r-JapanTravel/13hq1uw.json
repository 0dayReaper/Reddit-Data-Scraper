    "postText": "Here's what I'd do if I were to visit Kyoto again. I'm not sure if this is helpful to people as I'm not super familiar with this subreddit - feel free to upvote or downvote it depending on how much utility you think it has for others.\n\nI'd orient a lot of my trip around the mornings and prepare my backpack, look up the route, pack a breakfast, etc. for the mornings when I\u2019d go check out some temples using the itineraries from japan-guide.com. \n\nI\u2019d definitely see Ginkakuji and walk along the Philosopher\u2019s Path and see other temples there, and eat at Junsei, and then see Heian-jing\u016b Shrine if I had more time and energy. I\u2019d see Arashiyama using the itinerary on japan-guide.com. I\u2019d skip the monkey park in Arashiyama (since you can go to a zoo back home, and it wasn\u2019t that cool, and was out of the way). After seeing Tenryuji and the bamboo grove when they first open, maybe follow the rest of the itinerary on japan-guide.com for Arashiyama - we never tried that part. Ryoanji was cool but sort of out of the way up north. Kinkakuji could be a nice stop after Ryoanji, since it opens at 9am and Ryoanji opens at 8am. Or Ninnaji. Then I\u2019d spend the afternoons and evenings in shops like Nishiki Market or just a local electronics store or department store, and eating food. Even local electronics stores, convenience stores, and Don Quijote were fascinating to us because we are new to Japan. Maybe eat one night in Gion if you\u2019re interested in a nice expensive meal. The food in Japan is incredible. After 2 mornings of seeing temples you\u2019ll probably have had enough temples for a while, but 3 mornings is also a good option, and maybe there are hidden gems if you want to stick around longer.\n\nA note about getting places:\nWe were new to the public transport system in Japan, and our experience is going to be different from someone who has lived in Japan for years. I\u2019d at least take a taxi in the morning if running behind so that I can get there when the temples open, and might take a taxi whenever I\u2019d have to take a bus instead. Taxis are $10-$30 each way, but they save you an hour of time and frustration each way trying to figure out your route and getting lost (although maybe you\u2019re able to figure out how to navigate via bus, we struggled a lot with buses). If the route is only on subway then maybe just take that instead, and walk a bit, as we found navigating via subway easier than via bus (although if you\u2019re staying in Japan a month or more, maybe it\u2019s worth investing the time into figuring out the bus). But consider how much you\u2019re spending on hotels, flights, etc. to be here, and so the value of your time here is even more than if you were sitting back at home. You could get more done in a day and save money overall if you stay one fewer day but take taxis the whole time. Your mileage may vary and maybe you figure out the buses like a pro, but we missed a lot of things in Hakone for instance because we kept taking the wrong bus, and we didn't see as much in Kyoto because we walked a long way instead of just paying for a taxi.\n\nedit: Thanks everyone for the conversation. It would be interesting to hear from others if the buses really are more difficult universally to figure out and not miss than the subway system. It's kind of a mute point in Kyoto since you have to take both bus and subway to get to most destinations, but we're finding it super easy to commute via subway in Tokyo, whereas we had a hell of a time commuting via bus in Hakone. So overall it was definitely harder for us to figure out the buses (plus you can miss your stop for buses even if you understand them perfectly, whereas that seems less likely on subways) but I'd be interested in hearing if that's true for other people too or it was just us.",

Sometimes the actual location would be in sight of the wrong one, but I've encountered ones where there were no bus stops nearby at all. Often I'd just start walking along the route until I found a stop, but it was pretty frustrating.\n\nOverall, I found the bus system in Kyoto pretty chaotic.",

We ended up just taking a random bus to any sort of train station and getting ourselves back to Kyoto JR.",

Even though I had maps printed out with our hotel addresses in Japanese the drivers still couldn't find them on several occasions. Also we ended up having a complete nightmare getting dropped off at Osaka station as each cab dropped at a completely different part of the station and it took us 30 mins to find each other again since only 1 person had both wifi units. Also most taxi apps required a Japanese phone number which we didn't have or we weren't able to download due to country restrictions. The most success we had was with our hotels arranging taxis for us or using Uber, although wait times were 15 mins or so.",

And Heian-jingu is okay. \nSpending a day in Arashiyama is nice. I think Kinkakuji is on the must see lists for a reason. Its out of the way. Indeed, Ryoanji is an option and you can walk, Ninnaji also an option but I would not walk that distance. First Ryoanji then Kinkakuji, thats very smart.\n\nBut I will tell you a \"problem\" there. 99% of posts are \"here is my 6 days in japan, so day 1-4 tokyo, then day 5 kyoto with nara, day 6 osaka then back home\"  \nOkay maybe not that extreme. but most people, they dont have the time to stay a day in Arashiyama, or to explore north Kyoto, and even walking the philosophers path is, if they have never been to kiyomizudera or fushimi inari and kinkakuji and arashiyama, not my first pick. Sure, for some people it would be a better fit. but i dont know those people. and in general, i have to go with the best fit for most, and that is to try to get them to see the unique and most sought after spots. and even then you have to make compromises.  \nyou are in no way wrong, and I would totally recommend for people to actually do, but for your level of thoroughness in exploring a region I would suggest spending at least 3-4 days\n\nI also agree with your assessment of the monkey park. \n\nabout the bus system. you make it sound worse than it is. but, and i have to tell people sometimes as well, it can lead to missing connections, going the wrong direction, and that means that if you think you can get from a to b in 23minutes just because google tells you, it may not be that easy.  \nif people have a really tight schedule they may need to rely on taxi. like you said, it costs money, but it is the fastest and most relieable way.  \nthe subway in kyoto is unfortunately a joke. a not so funny one. they have two lines one e-w and one s-n almost ALL POIs are well outside where you would wanna walk from a subway station. its better than nothing, but there is not nothing, there is bus driving and taking a taxi. even renting a bike. if it fits, it fits, fine, but I would not recommend anyone to \"forget the bus, just take the subway\"  \nanyway, the bus, it can be full, it can get stuck in traffic (so can the taxi), and it takes time to get used to it. and still you might not quite make it the way you were planing.  \nbut its still a viable way, and it takes not too long to understand. I cant explain it well in text, but the important thing is to understand that many stops have 4 stops, depending on which way the bus is going (n,e,s,w), and that bus lines may go two ways, if you know which direction your line is going, then you kinda should know where its coming from and where its going, so you know which bus stop you should wait for the bus.  \nmost people may end up seeing google maps telling them, walk 100m to the bus station, ah yes, and wonder why the bus did not come on time and why it took another route. google maps dont really know too well which bus station, and the resolution is not good enough to be certain that you should be standing 15m on the other side of the road...\nMy point is, it can be worth it to figure them out, but if you have the budget, taxi will usually beat the bus any time, even if its just that the taxi will go where you say, the bus wont...",

Probably it is better than I made it out to be, but taxi is still an option. \n\nI probably didn't phrase it perfectly but my point about maybe picking taxi over bus is that it's more convenient, too, and quicker. Taxi can save you time even if you know you're way around the bus system perfectly (but especially if you're new to buses and / or Kyoto's buses). People should do the math and figure out of saving a half hour of time on their commute is worth $20 or so. If you make more than $50 an hour at work (combined, if traveling as a couple or group) then you add in the cost of hotel, flight, etc., which your time is costing you just to be in Japan, then It's likely worth it to take a taxi instead of a bus. \n\nAnd we can debate whether the threshold is $20 or $50.or something else (see the equation below) for a taxi instead of a bus. I think previous experience with buses in Kyoto or even elsewhere will change that equation so you're not missing as many buses and you save less time. People visiting Kyoto can check the commute times on Google Maps for buses and taxis to their location. But maybe $40 an hour is a reasonable guess. Overall formula might look like:\n\n&lt;hourly wage of everyone who can fit in the taxi&gt; + &lt;cost of flight divided by number of hours on trip&gt; + &lt;cost of hotel per night divided by hours in day&gt; + &lt;cost of food per day divided by hours in day&gt; + &lt;approximate value per hour of time you're taking off work for this trip&gt; ? &lt;one hour saved on commute&gt; * &lt;hourly cost of commute&gt; (I'm not actually sure about this formula, but hopefully it conveys the idea... if someone cares enough I'm happy to work out some examples using it, but I dunno if anyone is even reading this since it's buried in the comments, and maybe the reader still gets the idea)\n\nand if the ? in that equation is a &gt; then take a taxi or if it's &lt; then take the bus. My guess, though, is that the right side comes out higher than the left side for most people visiting Japan, since Japan isn't a budget destination, so in a lot of cases taking the bus can be a good idea. \n\n(That equation doesn't factor in the fun of figuring out the bus system, or the frustration of not figuring it out, but that's another factor people may want to consider, too.)",

You get to bike through small streets and come across unexpected surprises, at the same time getting exercise and getting places just as a fast as a car (you could do the same with a regular bike or Pippa bike share as most of Kyoto is relatively flat, but e-bikes makes it easier for getting to the hilly areas like from Gion to all the temples by the Philosopher\u2019s path).\n\nAs some others have mentioned, the best parts of Kyoto for me has been deviating from what\u2019s recommended on the guides and going into random shops and attractions.

I know a lot of people simply do not have the kind of time (or budget, in some cases, depending on how you like to travel), but that would be the minimum amount of time I would need, ideally.\n\nLast time I went, ew stayed at this cute hotel along the river, and I found this guy right next to our hotel who has this \"bar\" in his garage. Me and my girlfriend just walked in and had a beer with him and his neighbor friend. I'm more \"adventurous\" which is why we walked in, my girlfriend would never dare (being Japanese...). But because she is Japanese, I feel that a lot of things we did while in Kyoto would probably be hidden from foreigners who only visit for 2\\~4 days. She was able to talk to locals and read guides on Japanese sites, which are intended for locals (internal tourism). I think there's a ton of information on Japanese sites that is not easily accessible to non-Japanese.",

            "comment": "Depending on how long your stay in Kyoto is I really recommend renting a bike. I've been twice (2019, and December 2022) and we stayed in a hotel very close to the train station, just a few blocks to the south. There are several bike shops that you can rent an electric bike from for around $20 (Canadian), and they zoom you all over town. The daily charge allows you to drop the bike off at 10pm at night though I recall some places giving two full day rental if your hotel allows for bike storage.   \n\n\nYou get to be outside catching all the wonderfull fresh air, and see so many little nooks and areas along the way! you can find your own path very easily, and the rental company gives you a lock, and a bike parking map to show the free spots as well as the more advantageous pay spots. The pay spots were about 300yen for a few hours, so not too bad.  \n\n\n2019- One day bike took us from the station, up to arashiama, over to kinkakuji, and then over to Kiyomizu-dera area, back to Nishiki Market, and then the hotel. We covered LOTS of ground  this way.  \n2022- 8am bike pick up took us to Fushimi inure, up to Higashiyama area, around the Imperial Palace, Nijo Castle, and Nishiki Pontocho area, before being back and returning the bikes at 10pm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have a few days and plan it our you can cover a lot of space and find all the hidden gems all at once.",

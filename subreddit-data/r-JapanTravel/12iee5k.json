    "postText": "My family had a great time in Japan, and I wanted to give back to this sub since I gleaned a lot of information from you all during my preparation.  My wife and I took our 14 and 13 year old daughters for their first trip to Japan; we'd been there together 16 years ago before we got engaged but the kids have never been.  This is probably my 7th or 8th trip to Japan but most of those were as a kid with my family.\n\nMy priorities in planning were to\n\n1. introduce the kids to Japan overall\n2. ensuring daily plans included something for everyone\n3. expose the kids to a wide variety of Japanese food while ensuring the relatively picky eaters of the family (wife and younger daughter) still were satisfied\n4. not overload each day with activities as teenagers tend to be quite whiny\n5. rent a machiya in Kyoto (a longstanding bucket list item of mine).  The kids have good memories of sleeping on tatami in Taiwan, so I was hopeful they'd enjoy this aspect of the trip as well.\n\n**Food:**  Now, we are lucky to live in Vancouver BC and have a decent amount of good Japanese food available (Ramen, Katsu, Sushi....all of Japan-level quality) and I've been training the kids' palates for years, so I felt they were ready for a decent experience.  If all else failed I could keep the family going on Yoshinoya, combini food, and tempura/soba for the duration of the trip (as long as I fed my wife an occasional croissant).  We only had one restaurant reservation made in advance, at Tempura Endo Yasaka in Kyoto (a place I found on Tabelog, with a reasonably priced lunch menu).  The rest of the time I figured we could plan on shorter notice - which worked out, for the most part.  I very much did try to have a plan for each meal the day before, rather than winging it on the day of.  Wandering the streets trying to find a restaurant that will take 4 while accommodating the whims of picky eaters...is stressful.\n\n**Travel:**  We splurged for a 14 day JR Pass; in retrospect we probably could have saved some $$ by re-arranging the trip to accommodate a 7 day JR Pass to cover the non-Tokyo parts of the trip.  In Tokyo we used the Subway most of the time instead of Yamanote or Chuo lines, so the JR Pass in Tokyo wasn't as useful as I'd anticipated. Still, we have no regrets with how things turned out!  I very much recommend purchasing the JR Pass online despite the slightly higher cost.  Being able to plan out all our Shinkansen trips in advance was important to my mental well being.  I didn't want to worry about not having seats together should the trains get crowded.  And when we picked up our JR Passes at Narita, the attendant handed us our 28 Shinkansen/Narita Express tickets *for the entire trip* as well.  BOOM, no ticket machines, no fuss, no muss.\n\n**Accommodation**:  We AirBnB'd the vast majority of the trip, with only our one night on Miyajima being in an actual hotel. I hadn't started planning our trip until January, so we had some difficulty finding hotel rooms that accommodated 4 at a reasonable price.  But AirBnb had plenty of options, and we had a great experience overall.  One place was a bit difficult to find as the host gave us only an address...which on Google Maps led us to the back of the apartment building.  It only took us 10 minutes to figure it out, though it was a little stressful at the time.  One downside of an AirBnb is not having a hotel concierge to help with dinner reservations.  I didn't think to ask our AirBnb hosts to help us with them; maybe they would have?  The hotel in Miyajima definitely smoothed out the dinner reservation process at a busy time of year...\n\n**Language:**  None of us speak Japanese, though I can fake my way through a few key phrases pretty well (like most Taiwanese of their generation, my grandparents spoke Japanese fluently). And since I'm Asian it was often just enough to get me into trouble...though my Caucasian wife and mixed kids were usually enough of a sign for locals to switch into English quickly.  Because we stuck to the main tourist areas we didn't feel too lost not being fluent in Japanese.  Google Translate helped a ton with anything we couldn't puzzle out.  And taxi drivers responded well enough to the name of a station or temple.  \"Kyoto-eki, onegai shimasu\".  Turns out the kids had been doing Duolingo for a couple of months before the trip; they understood most of what was being said but weren't confident enough to try it themselves until the end of the trip.\n\n**Internet Access:**  We rented a Pocket Wi-fi as we had four phones; I didn't want to deal with the hassle of e-sims for all of us.  Plus, the wife and kids are fairly heavy social media users so having unlimited data (even if throttled) was important.  I got a 3GB/day package from Ninja/Global Wifi; it worked out well for us even if we did tend to max out the data sometimes.  Twice on the trip I left the wifi router with the family while I split off; for these two times I just accepted the roaming charges from my usual carrier for the day.  I did bring along two battery packs which was important for not only our own phones but for the Wifi router; it would only last till the afternoon without a recharge (I kept it plugged into the pack for the morning, so could switch to charging our phones in the afternoon from the battery).  Google Maps, Google Translate, and various other apps made navigation so much easier compared to our previous trip 16 years ago!  Google Maps was my default navigation, it was correct about 90% of the time when it came to transit options.  But I'd always cross-reference with the JapanTravel app (by Navitime), which seemed to have  a better algorithm for transit options specifically, but lacked the map functionality.  Some restaurants (like Sushiro) use LINE for their reservation system; handy to have but it's all in Japanese so take screenshots and use Google Translate on the photo; a bit cumbersome but it works well enough!\n\nOn to the trip itself!\n\nArrived at Narita fairly late, \\~8pm.  Took about an hour to get through immigration; we had our QR codes ready which made things faster, a bit.  There was a huge line for JR passes, but we had no choice but to wait through it.  Picked up four SUICA cards while we were waiting- though don't get them from the machines for tourists as you can't get the value in them refunded at the end of your trip.  Go to the regular SUICA machine just past the tourist ones...loaded them with 2000 yen which was enough for the first part of the trip.  Took Narita Express to Tokyo Station, then Keio line one stop to Chuo City where our AirBnb was (Hotel Vintage, highly recommended).  It's a quiet residential part of the city, and convenient to both Shintomicho and Hatchobori stations.\n\nThat's one thing about your accommodation in Tokyo - make sure it's easy and efficient to get to where you want to go!  From our two train stations we could easily walk to Tsukiji or Ginza, train to Tokyo Station, or head to western Tokyo neighborhoods on the Ginza line, with no more than one transfer.\n\nDay 1:  **Tsukiji Outer Market**, assembled a nice breakfast from items purchased in the Market and at Tsukiji Uogashi; ate at the very nice rooftop eating area of Tsukiji Uogashi - which is a building that still holds a faint echo of the storied Tsukiji Market of old.  The closest you'll get in the Market area, anyways!  Then headed to Yokohama for **Cup Noodles Museum** (for the kids, who enjoyed it), and **Sankeien** garden (wife was very much on the hunt for sakura blossoms) - I enjoyed walking through the gassho-style farmhouse there.  Dinner we decided to try Ippudo back in Ginza for ramen, where we waited maybe 20 minutes for counter seats.  Tablets made ordering easy, it was delicious.\n\nDay 2:  Breakfast from Lawson Station brought back to our room.  Usually consisted of pastries or musubi, and hot tea/coffee in bottles; a common pattern on our trip.  We headed out for **Teamlab Planets** (super fun for the kids...and ourselves.  Had purchased 9am tickets to try and avoid crowds but got there at 8:45am and there was already a long line).  Then headed west to **Shinjuku Gyoen** (needed to reserve an entry time the day before) to get a hanami in; we picked up a tarp at a dollar store and got wonderful  assorted lunch items from Isetan's food hall.  Relaxed and enjoyed the time outdoors....along with \\*a lot\\* of other viewing parties.  Wanted to get supper at Sushiro kaiten-zushi but no reservations available; grabbed a reservation for the next day via the LINE app.  We hit **Yoshinoya** near our AirBnb instead for a cheap, quick, delicious supper that satisfied everyone (youngest doesn't eat beef, but she was happy with the chicken options).\n\nDay 3:  Spent the day to the west.  Brunch at **Aoyama Flower Market Teahouse** in Omotesando, wife loved the beautiful room and photo ops, the kids liked the teas, and i liked the peace and quiet.  No reservations, we were the second party and quickly seated when the placed opened at 10am.  Pretty busy by 10:45...we walked the streets of **Omotesando and Harajuku,** making our way up to **Takeshita-dori** which was fun but also overwhelming.  Had some extra time so walked to **Meiji-jingu** for the kids' first sight of a Shinto shrine, and some more peace and quiet.  They enjoyed learning about the rituals and prayers.  Then on to **Sushiro** in Shibuya for a fun, delicious, and cheap dinner.\n\nDay 4:  Walked around **Ginza**.   Realized I'd left our Ghibli Museum tickets (3pm) back at the AirBnb....so went back to get them while the rest of the family had lunch at **Maizen** in Shibuya.  Got to **Ghibli Museum** just on time (thank goodness as getting the tickets involved failing the \"regular\" way, then a VPN into Tokyo, and a work colleague with a brother who lives in Tokyo).  Of course, the museum was a big hit with the kids and myself, less so with my wife who is not as much of a Ghibli-ophile.  Dinner back at Tokyo Station; it was one of the times where I didn't have a firm plan and trying to wander the hallways of Tokyo Station to find a meal everyone can agree on was stressful.  Soba restaurant was decent, but nothing to write home about.\n\nDay 5:  Morning Shinkansen to Kyoto.  We didn't need to ship our luggage at all as we had a very manageable 4 rollers, one for each of us.  They all fit on the rack above the seats despite two of the suitcases being medium sized (too big for carry on to a plane).  Arrived Kyoto at noon and our AirBnb machiya was ready early.  We dropped off our luggage and went to our long-reserved tempura lunch at **Tempura Endo Yasaka**.  A fantastic meal and experience (I had warned our younger daughter to eat everything or the restaurant would get upset....it worked!).  Then took a bus to and walked the **Philosopher's Path,** explored **Nanzen-ji**, and ended the evening's walk on the **Keage Incline** \\- a great spot for more sakura photos!  Subway back and dinner at a quick neighborhood katsu chicken restaurant.  The whole family loved staying in a machiya, probably the highlight accommodation of our trip.  We got used to soaking in the deep hinoki wood bathtub each night especially after all that walking today.  Kids still holding up to the pace of travel and activity.\n\nDay 6:  **Fushimi Inari** (busy at 8am, packed by 9am), **Arashiyama Grove** (overrun and suboptimal at 10:30am), **Okochi Sanso Garden** (definitely worth it especially after the mosh pit of the bamboo grove),  delicious lunch sitting on tatami while overlooking the river at Kameyamaya, and then the **Monkey Park** which entertained the girls greatly.  Dinner at a kushiyaki place at Kyoto station (delicious and cheap!).  Then went back to rest before going to **Kiyomizu-dera** for an evening visit in the rain.  Nighttime illumination is gorgeous, if you're lucky enough to visit during one of these events.\n\nDay 7:  **Toei Studio Park** visit - honestly a \"B\" level visit to a somewhat cheesy theme park/film set - unless you're a samurai movie fan.  Which I happen to be, so the opportunity to cosplay as Miyamoto Musashi (wig and all) in the park for an hour made this *the absolute highlight of the trip* for me.  We went to **Kinkaku-ji** after that, and then made it back to **Gion** with enough time for the wife and daughters to rent kimonos and walk around **Yasaka shrine** for photos with sakura.  We returned to the Yasaka shrine food stalls for dinner afterwards.  So much choice, a very fun taste of street food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 8:  Said goodbye to our lovely machiya, took morning Shinkansen and arrived at **Himeji Castle** in time for its 9am opening.  Luggage went into storage lockers at the station, plenty available due to the early hour.  Had a lovely wander around, retrieved luggage and hopped back on the shinkansen to get to Hiroshima.  If you can, get reserved seats on the **Sakura line trains** \\- they're in a wider 2-2 configuration instead of the 2-3 seats across on the Hikari trains.  Arrived Hiroshima and the family sacked out for the rest of the afternoon at our AirBnb; we were pretty tired by this point.  Dinner was at Hiroshima Station, we chose the **okonomiyaki stand** with the longest lineup of locals.  Totally worth the 30 minute wait.\n\nDay 9:  Morning train/ferry to **Miyajima**.  Caught high tide (make sure to check the tide tables) on the way over for photos.  Left luggage at hotel, wandered the town, had dinner at a local izakaya that stayed open after the day trippers left.  Stuffed ourselves with anagomeshi and oysters of every sort...\n\nDay 10:  Ferry and train back to Hiroshima, then Shinkansen to Okayama where we stopped to visit **Korakuen** and **Okayama Castle**, before continuing on back to Tokyo.  Arrived in the evening, found the AirBnb in Meguro, and walked the Meguro canal for a bit while eating roasted sweet potatoes from a truck.\n\nDay 11:  Shopping in Shibuya for souvenirs, lunch at **Butagumi** for some of the most delicious tomatoes and pork katsu I've ever had,  **Akihabara** for a taste of anime souvenirs for the kids, and **Shibuya Sky** in the evening (get your tickets months in advance if you want dusk!  We settled for 7:20pm when we reserved a week in advance).  Dinner was a bit of a disaster as we again had no firm plans, and every place in Meguro was *absolutely packed.*   Restaurants were turning people away and we resorted to combini food - while yummy, it was a bit sad as our last supper in Japan!\n\nDay 12:  Flight home from Narita, via Narita Express.  We are exhausted but the kids are sad to leave Japan and are talking about a year in university here, or a gap year after.....I'd say mission accomplished!",

We are traveling to Japan this summer with our teenagers and your report is eye opening - we will definitely look into reserving dining spots ahead of time.   \n\nCurious about you not going to Osaka, did you have a reason why you didn\u2019t choose to go there, especially since your family seemed to enjoy eating?  \n\nRegarding luggage, we will be traveling light as well and will likely use a laundromat.  Even traveling light, we are considering using a luggage forwarding service as we\u2019ve read that navigating the train stations with luggage can be challenging.  What was your assessment?   Also, what were your thoughts on traveling during rush hour, should that be avoided because the trains were packed?\n\nFinally, how did you adjust to the jet lag?  We will be coming from California  so the time change is the same as yours from Vancouver.  Our arrival at Narita is the same time also.  With teenagers, I\u2019m concerned that their internal clock will be screwed up for the first few days of the trip.  \n\nBecause of your tips, we will add Yokohama and the restaurants you mentioned.  Thanks!",

                    "comment": "Not going to Osaka was simply a matter of prioritizing our time in each city and not over scheduling.  And my wife and I went on our last trip; it was all right but not mind shatteringingly awesome (except for the aquarium). To be honest if we had another couple of days I probably would have preferred to go into the mountains or up to Kanazawa for a very different vibe than \u201clarge city\u201d.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have any problems at all navigating the train stations with luggage.  Yes a few subways involved carrying luggage up some stairs but thankfully it wasn\u2019t that common, and we all managed well enough when we needed to.  It helps that we packed on the lighter side (enough clothes for half the trip; we had laundry machines in our AirBnB\u2019s which was *fantastic*).  In \u201ctravel configuration\u201d we each had a roller and a backpack.  Very manageable.\n\nEven during rush hour you could find some less crowded areas (end cars) so I wouldn\u2019t stress about it - though if you have the option, going outside of rush hour is much more relaxed.  I prioritized getting where we wanted to go, though.\n\nJet lag wasn\u2019t too much of an issue, I think because we tired ourselves out enough on the trip that we got a good nights sleep the first night, and that reset us well enough.  And kept a busy schedule so we didn\u2019t have time to get tired during the day!  Coming back was similarly easy (compared to a trip to Italy last year that absolutely wrecked me on the return).  I think the key is timing when you sleep on the plane trip.  We also took melatonin, not sure if it helped but it didn\u2019t hurt.",

If you go for the stairs, single file so people can go past and we had no issues. Just be aware that suitcases on 4 wheels can be fun on trains with standing room only ;)",

There were plenty of seats available then.  I don\u2019t know how quickly they fill\u2026I did see if I could move some seats on the morning of and they were all sold out so don\u2019t wait to the last minute!",

            "comment": "Just had a Tokyo trip early April. I would recommend getting the Suica card on your Apple Wallet, you can easily add it under transit cards, and you can load it up via Apple Pay, if express transit is on, should be on my default, no need to open / unlock your iphone, you just tap it on the train station entrance like its a card. \n\nSecond thing is, if your phone supports it, esims, you can install an esim before your trip, then just activate it when you land. This saved me and my buddy so much time, espesically with the Suica cards in our phones, most tourists were spending so much time trying to buy train tickets, or even load up their Suica cards. \n\nAlso the JR bus if you arrive in Narita early is only 1,000 yen, same amount of time (less than an hour) to go to Tokyo or Ginza.",

Not sure if that\u2019s gotten better since then?\n\nI think eSims are great for one or two travellers, but if you have a family of four, heavy users of data, pocket Wifi is a better deal.  I just checked and 10GB of data over two weeks is 5100Y\u2026compared to 10000Y for pocket wifi for the four of us, 3GB/day then throttled.",

You can try next time you go, just press the + button on Apple Wallet, then look for transit cards, then Japan then add SUICA (there is an option for PASSMO too, but couldnt get it to work, it wasn't accepting any of my cards to load it), then you can use any credit card you have in your wallet to load it up, I used my Apple Card. It also keeps track of your purchases and shows you on the map your route for the ticket, I attached a screenshot of mine. \n\n[https://ibb.co/ZLSf6VQ](https://ibb.co/ZLSf6VQ)\n\n[https://ibb.co/Wfz1N0F](https://ibb.co/Wfz1N0F)\n\nThere is an app called Airalo, which can be found in the app store - [https://www.airalo.com/japan-esim](https://www.airalo.com/japan-esim)\n\n5GB of data for 30 days is $11.50 or 10GB for 30 days is $18\n\nIt will connect to the softbank network, and you just make sure you turn on data roaming for the esim, make sure your actual local sim is off.\n\nJust encase you or your family get separated and there is no wifi the esim comes in handy, there is no local number (voice), only data. I think it comes to about the same, pocket wifi versus esim.",

I would say the massage style felt slightly lighter than the china ones but still great. \n\nI highly recommend doing an onsen or ryokan with onsen near end of your trip. We felt totally refreshed and it was a great way to end the trip.",

When you raise your feet above your heart, it reduces swelling and helps circulate your blood better because gravity.

I had no problems with  my feet at all.\n\nAlso, remember to take breaks - don't walk 30 minutes to a museum, spend 2 hours on your feet in the museum, then walk another 45 minutes  afterwards. Hang out in the museum cafe with a coffee or tea for 15 minutes when you get there, and sit down and take a couple breaks inside the museum.

SalonPas patches can help with sore muscles and you can buy them in pharmacies or Don Quiojte in Japan.  Bring Ibuprofen with you to Japan.  Bring two pairs of very good, already broken in walking shoes and alternate them each day to avoid sore/hot spots/blisters.\n\n- [Health Goods You Can Buy in Japan](https://matcha-jp.com/en/1437)\n- If you like to take a bath at night, you might want to avoid hotel rooms with [very small unit bathrooms.](https://resources.realestate.co.jp/living/japanese-apartment-bathrooms-explained/) Check bathroom photos in a site line booking to confirm if a unit bath or not for the room you\u2019re booking.  \n- I prefer the Daiwa Roynet, Mitsui Garden, Candeo, Cross Hotels, and MyStays hotel chains as they often have larger bathrooms/tubs. \n\nThe number 1 tip for any visit to Kyoto or Tokyo is to lump sightseeing together by district. These are *huge* and very spread out cities. Number 2 tip is to get your one to two must-see/do\u2019s done as early each day as possible.  Then, anything else you do that day, is gravy. Lumping sites together by district will help reduce walking a bit. \n\n- [Tokyo Districts](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-districts/)\n- [Kyoto Districts](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-districts)\n- [Osaka Districts](https://insideosaka.com/osaka-districts/)\n- [Save the places you want to visit in Google maps.](https://www.theunconventionalroute.com/google-maps-saved-places/) \n- Then, zoom out and see where those places are lumped together.  Do *that* specific district/area in the morning and shift to another district/area in the afternoon.  This way you don\u2019t lose time/money criss-crossing the city.  \n- See how long it will take to travel via public transit (or walking if within the same area) between your sites.  You need to account for travel time and add in an extra 15- 20 minutes from what Google Maps says as you may get turned around looking for your entrance/exit or platform in the subway/train stations. \n- Be sure you check opening hours/days in Google maps too.  You don\u2019t want to show up at 8 am to Akihabara only to find all the shops closed or to a museum on a Monday as that is often (but not always) a closed day. \n\nThere\u2019s also no need to recreate the wheel. Use some of these sample itineraries as a guide to plan out your days.  YouTube and TikTok are great for ideas/inspiration, but they often edit videos together in a way that makes it seem locations are much closer together than they are.  Sample itineraries like these, put the main sites together in a logical way logistically and give you a better sense of what is possible to see within a day. You don\u2019t have to follow them exactly, but they can be a helpful starting point to planning your day. \n\n- [JapanGuide: Suggested Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2400.html) \n- [JapanGuide: Tokyo Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3051.html)\n- [Truly Tokyo: Itineraries](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-itineraries/)\n- [Truly Tokyo: Kawaguchiko Day Trip](https://trulytokyo.com/a-day-trip-to-the-mt-fuji-area-lake-kawaguchiko/)\n- [JapanGuide: Tokyo Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3950.html)\n- [Inside Kyoto: Itineraries](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-itineraries)\n- [JapanGuide: Osaka Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4028.html) \n- [Inside Osaka: Itineraries](https://insideosaka.com/osaka-itineraries/)\n- [Nara Itineraries](https://www.insidekyoto.com/nara-itineraries)\n- [HakoneNavi: Itineraries](https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/course) \n- [Hakone Round Course](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5210.html) \n- [Japan Guide: Nikko Itineraries](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3822.html)\n- [Nikko: One Day or Overnight Itinerary](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-tochigi/in-nikko/article-a0003340/)",

When I booked everything in October I started on a weight loss plan and over the intervening months I went from 340 to 300. I had intentions of adding lots of walking into the mix but it was winter and cold and I never really did get to it.\n\nSo, first good thing I did was lose 10% of my body mass (i packed on some pounds during Covid).\nNext was getting the right equipment. I went to a local running/fitness shoe place and had my feet modeled and purchased a pair of Hoka walking shoes with the highest level of comfort. Contrary to what you hear breaking these in we\u2019re not necessary. Believe it or not shoes like this are only good for like 300ish miles of use before not offering the support they used to.\n\nNext: socks. For those people not used to exertion (like me), I talked to my doctor and researched online and I invested in about 7 pairs of 15-25 mmHg compression socks for 3 reasons: 1) I\u2019m on some meds that can cause clots and my flight over was 16 hours and these help prevent them 2) I read they really help with extending your endurance (there\u2019s a reason why athletes use them and 3) it helps with sore muscle recovery. I will stress here that these were 90% most likely my secret to my success. It was like night and day over regular socks. Seriously if you\u2019re going to Japan buy some and use them every day you will definitely notice a difference.\n\nNext: blister prevention. I noticed in the airports and flight over I was getting a few hotspots in my shoes, but I was prepared. I bought these Teflon things to go back on tbe heels of my shoes that smoothed out the interface between my heels and the shoes to stop friction based blisters from happening. I highly recommend doing this, if you\u2019re prone to this issue. I\u2019d always been highly prone to blisters on my heels. This + the smooth compression socks knocked this problem out completely.\n\nSo, you\u2019ve gotten the equipment sorted, and tried a little to prep your body (or not, that part is up to you). Next is a regimen of self care.\n\nEvery night it was: get back from eating dinner, disrobe, bathe in the Japanese fashion. That is, take a shower to wash yourself off and cleanse everything, then fill up the deep bath with the hottest water you can stand and soak in it (making sure your entire lower legs are submerged) for 15-30 minutes. Out of the bath, take an NSAID of your choice. I had to go with aspirin because I mistakenly only packed excessive migraine and strangely couldn\u2019t get ibuprofen at the drug store. Then just relax and wind down and sleep.\n\nThis regimen + the equipment + the prep made me feel like literal superman. I could go all day. I would get up in the morning, walk all morning in my neighborhood of choice, sit down and rest at lunch for an hour, then stand up and go all afternoon, dinner, then wind down regimen. I did stop every now and then where I could to rest if I needed a minute but for some reason had no issue finding places for that? Also there\u2019s always sitting on the train. Lots of bus riding in Kyoto too and lots of the stops have benches there as well.\n\nThe piece de resistance for me though? One of the big reasons I finally decided to be brave and take this trip was because over Covid I heard about the walk from Magome-juku to Tsumago-juku along the Nakasendo trail. Everything I did was to give myself the best chance of doing this hike. I planned it for the first half of my trip, and it was the best experience of my life, even if the first 40% of it felt like I was walking up the side of a mountain. It\u2019s like 6 miles from town to town over a mountain pass, and I did it, and my feet and legs survived (I did end up taking an easier day the next day to recover but that was kind to be of expected after a 10+ mile day).\n\nSo yeah, as a large person, it\u2019s definitely doable as long as you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into and are prepared.",

I don't know what it is, but Japanese shower heads also have way higher water pressure than where I'm from. They're nice for showering and massaging your feet. Hope you're comfortable with full nudity tho. \n4. If you don't have a public bath, go buy some foot bath salts stuff from the pharmacy/DonQi.

If you want more stylist shoes then I would recommend Nike Air Max 1 or 90's.\n2. When and if you buy new shoes I recommend to break them in as your feet will hurt as the shoes will be restrictive until you break the materials in by getting it stretched.\n3. Walk often before your trip to help build your muscles for your trip. You don't want to be sore in your legs or feet while you're there. Might as well be sore at home that way you don't ruin your trip. Walk 1 mile a day and slowly go up if you choose. \n4. While walking in Japan make sure you stay hydrated. Water and oxygen is good for your muscles. There will be plenty of vending machines in Japan so you can stay hydrated.",

I was walking 15-25K steps a day in fashionable tennis shoes, and I had searing burning pain in the bottoms of my feet (not your regular soreness) after a few days. I stopped by a store called \"Aisics Walking\" while I was in japan and got wider shoes designed for walking. They were wider (my guess is equivalent to width 2e in the US) and they made the difference. I immediately felt the searing pain gradually fade, even with walking.\n\nTry and sit periodically, but that can be hard as there is not much public seating outdoors and most coffee/snack shops are filled with sitting tourists.",

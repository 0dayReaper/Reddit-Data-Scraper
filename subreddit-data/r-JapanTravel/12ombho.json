    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm planning a honeymoon trip to Japan in Mid May, and while I have most of the schedule down, I'd like some feedback to make sure I'm being realistic with timelines, or if there's something I may have missed. It's both our first times in Japan, although I've been wanting to go there forever while my husband has recently warmed up to the idea (he thought it was a weird place before he met me heh). I've tried to balance highly planned busy days with lesser planned relaxing days. We did buy the 14 day JR Rail Pass (which I left the \"worth it\" calculation up to my husband).\n\nAbout me:\n\n* 30F, travel style is \"sleep when I'm dead\", does the research, event/museum/restaurant booking and trip planning\n* likes good food, anime, nature, architecture, history, kawaii, snacking on everything, shrines and temples (mainly to collect goshuin.....and for the spirituality)\n\nAbout my husband:\n\n* 34M, travel style is \"rest frequently and take it easy\", takes care of all the practicalities like money exchange, train tickets, etc.\n* likes model trains, technology, science, museums, stationery, shopping (esp high quality items), Sony, robotics\n\nItinerary:  \nNote that we will ship our big luggage from Tokyo to Kyoto (carry on for Kinosaki) and Kyoto to Tokyo (carry on for Hiroshima). **Bold** is where we'll sleep, (brackets) is where we will go for the day.\n\nSat May 13 - Tokyo  \nHotel is in Asakusa\n\n* 2:30pm - Land at Haneda, get esim/JR pass/other necessities\n* 5pm - Reach hotel, pick up food from Family Mart for breakfast\n* 6:30pm - Walk around Asakusa\n* DINNER: Asakusa Yokocho\n* 8pm - sleep\n\nSun May 14 - **Tokyo** (Asakusa/Akiba/Tokyo Skytree)\n\n* 8:30am - Senso-ji and Nakamise-dori, eat from street shops\n* 11:30am - Asakusabashi Kohaku and Marronnier Matsuri, eat from stands\n* 2pm - Akibahara, check out model train stores/anime merch stores, go to Bungubox, wander around Kanda Myojin. \n   * My husband will split up at this time to take a nap at the hotel, so I'll go to Kanda Myojin without him and meet up again for the otaku stuff\n* 6pm - Tokyo Skytree and Solamachi\n   * Not interested in going up the Skytree, instead we'll be doing some shopping at all the character stores\n* DINNER: undecided.....either somewhere within Solamachi or back in Asakusa\n\nMon May 15 - **Tokyo** (Kichijoji/Harajuku/Shibuya)\n\n* 10am - Ghibli Museum (we got the tickets!!)\n* 12:30pm - Lunch in Kichijoji, maybe wander around\n* 2:30pm - Meiji Shrine\n* 4pm - Harajuku/Shibuya, watch the people at scramble square, Purikura no mecca, walk down Takeshita street, Tokyu Hands\n   * I'm not interested in clothes shopping as most won't fit me, so I'm ok with spending more time walking around the area instead of spending time in the stores.\n* DINNER AND DRINKS: nothing specific in Shibuya however I've heard there are a lot of ramen places so we'll try and spring for that. Also would like cocktail bar recommendations. I've seen the Sakurai Tea Experience but I feel neither of us are refined enough in our tea tastes to fully appreciate the experience.\n\nTues May 16 - **Tokyo** (Ikebukuro and Shinjuku)\n\n* 10am - Ikebukuro, Sunshine City, shopping \n* 1pm LUNCH: Shinjuku, Tsunahachi Rin tempura\n* Suga Jinja (aka the \"Your Name\" pilgrimage -&gt; [https://mipon.org/your-name-pilgrimage/](https://mipon.org/your-name-pilgrimage/))\n* Gyoen Park\n* Tokyo Metropolitan Govt Building for the views \n* Golden Gai, Omoide Yokocho\n* DINNER: Izakayas around Shinjuku, nothing specific yet\n\nWeds May 17 - **Kinosaki Onsen**  \nHotel: Morizuya Ryokan\n\n* 8am - Shinkansen to Kyoto, then train to Kinosaki Onsen\n* LUNCH: ekiben from Tokyo or Kyoto station\n* 2pm - Arrive at Kinosaki, walk the streets and eat snacks\n* 3pm - Check into ryokan and relax in onsen\n* DINNER: Ryokan Kaiseki\n* 8pm - more onsen\n\nThurs May 18 - **Kyoto**   \nHotel is in Downtown Kyoto\n\n* 8am - Ryokan breakfast\n* 10am - Kinosaki ropeway (is 2 hours enough for this?)\n* 12:30pm - Train to Kyoto\n* 3:30pm - Check into hotel and relax\n   * I might head out to Nishiki market first before it closes and then come back to relax\n* DINNER: Pontocho street\n\nFri May 19 - **Kyoto** (Nara)\n\n* 6:30 am - hike up Fushimi Inari\n* 9am - take train to Nara\n* 11am - Todai-ji temple, Kasuga Taisha shrine, Necoco general store, Kofuku-ji\n* 7pm - back to hotel, relaxed dinner (department store basement food?)\n\nSat May 20 - **Kyoto** (Arashiyama)\n\n* 8:30am - Tenryu-ji, Arashiyama Bamboo grove\n   * not interested in the Monkey park as husband is traumatized by his past encounters with monkeys\n* 10:30am - Rilakkuma cafe \n   * (if the line is too long, we'll skip this and go for lunch somewhere else later)\n* 11:30am - walk around Saga toriimoto, see the temples\n* LUNCH - something light around Arashiyama area\n* 2pm - Sagano Romantic Train\n* 3pm - Hozugawa Boat Tour\n* 5pm - Fufu no Yu?

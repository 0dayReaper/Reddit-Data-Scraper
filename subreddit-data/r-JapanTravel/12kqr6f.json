            "comment": "Day 2 is way too packed and not doable, unless you just want to speed running every single location. Day 6 is similar, although doable but you won't be able to spend too much time on each site.\n\nConsidering your parents age, you want to make sure they get plenty of breaks in between point of interest.  Especially if it's your first time travelling to Japan as well, you will most likely getting lost/stuck somewhere trying to figure out the transportation etc. And that just means more detour walks. \n\nAlso try to have a rest day in Tokyo for all of you, that doesn't mean do nothing, but more of a give your legs a break while people watching at a neat cafe/restaurant.",

Arashiyama ideally should be a whole day event, Kinkakuji is only worth doing if you are going to Arashiyama. I would say scrap Arashiyama and Kinkakuji, and spend time on some other temples near kiyomizu if you still have energy after that.\n\nUp to you what you want to skip on day 6, try to look at all of them on Google map, have an idea of how far away and how long it takes to go from location to location. Bunch the neighbor attractions together and have a few others as optional.",

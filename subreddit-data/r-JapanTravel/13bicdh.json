If you're going full JR it's about a 4 hour trip each direction. Quite the trek for a day trip, especially with two young kids.",

Could easily spend a day wandering around shrines, museums and eating festival food. \n\nI'm not sure what your plans are for June 7th? It'll be a short journey from Osaka to Kyoto. If you leave early, you could easily fit in a whole day of sightseeing. Might be worth fitting Arashiyama or Fushimi Inari into that day as they're further out of the city and will demand 3-4 hours each. \n\nWhen in Kyoto, go for Gion in the morning, and work your way back via Nishiki Market and Pontocho Alley in the evening.",

(You will need to take a bus from the Kintetsu Station) We did ninja training there.  It was a lot of fun and I sucked which my daughter thought was hilarious.  I would do that over Naoshima.  From what I remember, Naoshima didn't have a lot of kids bicycles (or maybe had none) and taking a bus that runs hourly around the island I think is going to have limited appeal.  \n\n[https://www.akame48taki.com/en/](https://www.akame48taki.com/en/)\n\nWe went in June 2019.  The sweet potato ice cream for sale there is delicious.\n\nMy tween really liked Miyajima.  \n\nThough you could also just add more time elsewhere.\n\nI think June 8th looks a little full.\n\nMy tween loved Yunessun.  It's cheezy and a bathing suit onsen, but she gets shy easily now.  It's in Hakone not too far from Tokyo.  My tween did not like Team Lab Planets outside of the ramen we got there.  \n\nKamakura is always a nice visit (also near Tokyo.)\n\nIn Tokyo we do a lot of shopping and visiting with friends.",

For Osaka, for example, since we were going to USJ we found someplace accessible to it and for Kyoto near the temples we wanted to visit.\n\nTip is to try establish if the rail station nearby has the lines which conveniently take you to the places you want to go. For example we have a station 4 minutes away but it\u2019s not really a mainline station which is about half a mile down the road. So it\u2019s not as \u201con the doorstep\u201d as we would have wanted.",

            "comment": "Is this possible? I guess it could be done but the middle part of Senso-ji, lunch, Skytree plus travel to Shibuya in 3 hours seems optimistic / borderline not possible. Generally trying to hit 3 neighborhoods in one day will be a lot and I think would feel rushed and without as much time to explore smaller sights / shops and stores along the way. We spent a day just on Uneo and Akihabara and another on Shibuya / Harajuku.",

Appreciate the input and will definitely revise our itinerary multiple times as I gather more insights and learn more about travelling in Japan :)",

            "comment": "That's very rushed. Your noon time plan looks unrealistic. Getting across Tokyo typically takes 45-60 mins once you account for the walk to and from stations and waiting for the train to arrive (and potentially getting lost). Also, meals often take longer than expected; in popular areas you're usually waiting in line (or searching for a restaurant that doesn't have a line). \n\nI'd suggest removing Skytree. You can replace it with Shibuya Sky sometime during your 2-6 pm time slot. It's still quite a busy day... I personally don't like doing that much the day after arriving.",

I wasn't really able to factor a lot of things that would consume time when I was making this itinerary but apart from that, I'd probably try not putting strict times on each location and go with writing down few major locations we really want to visit per day and spend time :)",

The walk between Sensoji and Sky Tree is nice and not that long, it\u2019s obviously a pretty easy train ride as well. You might end up taking longer going up Skytree if there is a long line but considering you have a four hour window in Shibuya you have a lot of slack time\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of things in a day, but there are a lot of hours in a day!",

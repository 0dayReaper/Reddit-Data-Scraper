    "postText": "Hello, \n\nHere is the context : I really like an old Turkish singer whose name is Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o. He traveled a lot everywhere in the world, and also in Japan in 1991. My point is, where can I, in Japan, find and could buy an old 1991 magazine, newspaper, \u2026 which talks about Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o (like archives?). Secondly, he released a special album in Japan in 1996. Where could I find this album (special music stores?). In Tokyo if possible.\n\nThank you! (I hope the topic isn\u2019t irrelevant according to the community)",

Maybe you\u2019re right, but in T\u00fcrkiye Bar\u0131\u015f Man\u00e7o sold less than 500.000 copies, but in Japan where the \u201cCD culture\u201d is more expended, he sold like over 1 million copies (but it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s less appreciated or anything in T\u00fcrkiye). So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that would be easier to find a CD in Japan rather than in T\u00fcrkiye. But I could be wrong too.",

There\u2019s four for sale online and most seem to be via physical stores within Japan, so could look them up and see where they are",

    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI'll be traveling with some friends to Japan in late January. Two of us have been to Japan before but both when we were younger with family, so we're treating this as a first-time itinerary for most purposes. Our Tokyo days are very flexible/empty at the moment and not even close to finalized, so suggestions would be appreciated! I think we will do much more wandering on the Tokyo days. Suggestions are also appreciated for food!\n\n**Day 0, Thurs (Arrival):**\n\n* Arrive at NRT 5:30PM\n* Train to Tokyo\n\n**Day 1, Fri (Ginza &amp; southeast-ish areas):**\n\n* Art Aquarium\n* Pokemon Center DX\n* Tsukiji/Toyosu (maybe not both)\n* teamLab Borderless (not Planets! Borderless should be open by Jan)\n* Tokyo Tower\n\n**Day 2, Sat (Asakusa and northeast-ish areas):**\n\n* Sensoji\n* Nakamise\n* Akihabara\n* Train to Hakone\n\n**Day 3, Sun (Hakone):**\n\n* Hakone Round Course (Amasake Chaya, Hakone Shrine, Open Air Museum)\n* Train to Himeji\n\n**Day 4, Mon (Himeji/Kyoto):**\n\n* Himeiji Castle\n* Koko-en\n* Train to Kyoto\n* Heian-jingu\n* Philosopher's Path (Nanzen-ji to Ginkaku-ji)\n\n**Day 5, Tues (Nara):**\n\n* Fushimi Inari Taisha\n* Train to Nara\n* Nakatanidou\n* Kofuku-ji\n* Todai-ji\n* Kasuga Taisha\n* Higashimuki\n* Train to Kyoto\n\n**Day 6, Wed (Kyoto):**\n\n* Arashiyama\n* Ryoan-ji\n* Kinkaku-ji\n* Nijo Castle\n* Sanjusangendo\n* Kiyomizu-dera\n* Gion\n\n**Day 7, Thurs (Takaragawa Onsen):**\n\n* Train + Bus to Takaragawa Onsen\n\n**Day 8, Fri (Shinjuku):**\n\n* Train to Shinjuku\n* Shinjuku Gyoen\n* Suga Jinja\n* Meiji Jingu\n* Tokyo Metro Gov Building\n\n**Day 9, Sat (Harajuku/Shibuya):**\n\n* Harajuku/Shibuya\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Nintendo Tokyo\n\n**Day 10, Sun (Kichijoji):**\n\n* Ghibli Museum\n* Daiya Shopping Arcade\n\n**Day 11, Mon (?):**\n\n* Train to NRT\n* Leave from NRT 6:15PM\n\nWe'll be using a combination of individual tickets and IC for travel. A 7-day JR pass may be an option covering leaving Hakone to arriving in Shinjuku depending on the price at the time and other fees since purchasing individual tickets may be cheaper especially if we decide to use Nozomi trains.",

If we had a suitable replacement for Takaragawa Onsen (see other comment) perhaps we could put a little more time the morning of Day 7 to split up Day 6.",

And it's an hour to bus to gion.  Walking around kiyomizudera and the surrounding area took me 3 hours.\n\nIf you think you can finish in one day, then you're basically spending about an hour at each place without stopping to shop or eat.\n\nYou telling me you're not going to grab matcha at one of the very well known dessert places near kiyomizudera or gion?  I spent an hour just getting matcha and warabamochi.  And I wanted more.\n\nI just don't think it's realistic unless you plan on just looking at something, snapping a picture, and leaving.\n\nWhy don't you spend a night at hakone?  It's a great onsen town.\n\nI also strongly suggest 2 nights at an onsen.  I did one night and I barely got one bath in.",

Total transportation for the day all summed up is about 3-3 1/2 hours, which isn't terrible. I have been to about half of the items on that day and remember most of them only taking an hour to fully walk around as they aren't large - Kiyomizu-dera was closer to two hours.",

Walking around, doing the love stones, entering the womb, doing a prayer, savoring the view, and catching a drink at the fountain will take at least 2.5 hours.  \n\nI think a little background reading will totally enrich the experience.\n\nKyoto is like Paris.  You need to give it some time and breathe it in.  It's very easy to walk and hit up a lot of beautiful areas.  But if you rush you might just miss something beautiful.  \n\nIf you never had Buddhist vegetarian kaiseki (shojin ryori), I definitely recommend that.",

The hotel has mixed reviews online (maintenance issue, condition, etc). If you want to truly experience Ryokan - there is Kinosaki Onsen that is not too far from Kyoto or alternatively in Izu or Hakone which can be part of the trip back to Tokyo on the shinkansen. Also consider spending two nights possibly to relax. Why not combine it with Hakone trip?",

I did read a lot of the poorer reviews, but they seemed to be from a while ago and recent reviews have been better, so I thought it was worth a try. I debated adding it for a while but several friends wanted a place where they could cover up and do mixed-gender onsen, which is few and far between once you remove the \"resort\" places. If you have any recommendations here that fit that criteria, I'm all ears!\n\nWe'll be staying a ryokan in Hakone, probably Hakone Suimeisou, on Day 2 - those not as concerned will also use onsen there. The half board ryokan nights are also on the pricier side, so that's why there isn't an extra day added. I did look at Izu but ultimately decided it was a bit too much of a detour - Takaragawa is a little more accessible because of Shinkansen.",

(Seasoned salts, aromatics etc)... also kobe has one of the best China towns to try a variety of street foods. Lastly the port is quite a nice spot to just hang out at and grab dinner or lunch. \n\nSecondly, arashiyama, fushimi inari AND kinkakuji in a single day sounds like way too much. Arashiyama for most people is a day. I would split this up and do fushimi inari and kinkakuji together in a day and arashiyama another. You get the time to take everything in, get to all of them at better times too perhaps and overall just not rush the entirety of all three places.",

When out there usually isn't a lot of options to sit unless you go to a cafe or restaurant so you could end up being on your feet for long stretches - just something to keep in mind.\n\nThe only thing that stood out of the itinerary is Lake Biwa. I've stayed at Lake Biwa and it's nice - I used it as an alternative to Kyoto - but I'm not sure what you have planned on day 9 to make it worth it?",

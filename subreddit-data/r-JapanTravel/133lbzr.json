    "postText": "We recently got back after 17 days in Japan and completed the following trips on the Shinkansen. \n\nTokyo to Kyoto\n\nKyoto to Nagoya \n\nNagoya to Kyoto \n\nKyoto to Osaka \n\nOsaka to Tokyo \n\nThis is our third time in Japan and the JR pass is great for convenience but looking back, it cost us more to get the pass this time around, and the price is only going to get steeper. \n\nOur previous trip we went from Tokyo to Fukuoka (staying at Kyoto, osaka and Hiroshima on the way) all the way back to Tokyo.   \n\nThat trip was definitely worth it, though under the new pricing that is coming in I\u2019m not even sure if it would still be worth getting one. \n\nRemember to also book for oversized luggage. You will be sitting at the back and your suitcases go behind your chairs. Makes life heaps easier!!!",

For now, you can get close to breaking even with the 7-day pass ( \\~\u00a530,000) if you travel from Tokyo to Osaka and back to Tokyo (\\~ \u00a528,000).  With the 7-day pass increasing to \\~ \u00a550,000 doing the standard 'golden route' alone within 7 days is not enough.  You'd have to add another trip equivalent to going from Tokyo to Hiroshima.  All of that in 7 days.  \n\n You do get some convenience with the JR pass (not having to deal with buying tickets at JR stations), but not sure it's worth the extra cost.  JR also did mention that discounts (to attractions) will be coming with the price increases.",

I felt it was expensive- but made sense to me with the flexibility and ease of travel as a tourist. I am too lazy to plan too much - so this is perfect. But clearly not for everyone with the price hikes.\n\nApparently, Japan is around 84% reliant on thermal power generation of which 37% is oil. With price escalations due to war and inflation, I am not surprised with the decision to hike prices. \n\nhttps://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/special/article/detail_171.html#:~:text=Japan%20depends%20largely%20on%20fossil,fuels%20to%20a%20certain%20extent.\n\n\nI wonder how profitable it is to run the service - though the revenue is quite high. They have ongoing projects to extend the investment which apparently is being halted or delayed at due to increased costs of labour and materials.\n\n[cost increases](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Transportation/Japan-s-next-bullet-train-lines-face-multibillion-dollar-cost-increases)",

But honestly it does not seem like these changes will really be all too useful for a lot of people unless they put some heavy mileage on that pass post-October. It doesn't seem like it will be as easy to even break even anymore, plus the upgrade costs for the two faster trains is just lame. :(",

It only covers JR lines (and I believe certain buses, but I'm not 100% which ones). \n\nFor Tokyo, you can use the JR lines (main ones are Yamanote and Chuo) but not the metro or subway lines. You can try use JR only, but you will need to put up with less time efficient routes sometimes, and certain popular tourist areas don't have a JR line (eg Asakusa, Odaiba, Roppongi). \n\nFor Osaka, it's less useful. The loop line is the main line it covers and that doesn't go to many popular tourist destinations.\n\nFor Kyoto, it's close to useless. Kyoto doesn't have many local JR lines (at least not relevant to tourists) and you are primarily using the buses which aren't covered by the pass.",

Just make sure to put the amount of belongings you need for the amount of time you are without your luggage (clothing, toiletries, money, passport, etc.,) in a separate bag/backpack that you can easily carry with you. But if you prefer having all of your belongings with you wherever you are then perhaps this wouldn\u2019t be the best option for you. \n\n If you\u2019re staying at a hotel, check with the front desk to see if they can arrange this service for you. Many hotels do and if so, you should inform them of where and when you need to have your luggage arrive at your next destination and they will tell you when you should have it shipped. Most destinations are next day delivery but some can be a little bit longer. For example, I shipped my luggage from my hotel in Osaka to my hotel in Tokyo. I wasn\u2019t due to arrive in Tokyo for a few days because I was going to be in Kyoto. Still, they informed me that my luggage would arrive the next day in Tokyo and that the hotel would send my luggage to my room. My hotel basically handled all the arrangements, they filled out the shipping/delivery form, called the hotel in Tokyo to confirm my reservation, then they weighed and calculated the price for shipping my luggage. Price is determined by the number of luggage and their weight. Then I paid, got my receipt which you should hold onto, and when I checked into my hotel in Tokyo, my luggage had already been sent up to my room just like they said it would be. \n\nIf you are not staying at a hotel and at an Airbnb for example, then you can go to a nearby convenience store like 7-Eleven or find a Yamato Transport location near you to arrange this service.",

We'll be doing a round trip from Tokyo to Osaka at least and that usually covers the bulk of a 7 day pass but we'll look into whether we're doing enough travel to be worth it closer to the time. I've certainly questioned the value more and more every time I've bought one but I've always been able to make enough use of it to save some money.\n\nI can't see how it'll be worth it for anyone in the future though. You'd have to be doing some very intensive rail travel just to break even. And the convenience and being able to use the other bullet trains just don't add enough value for how expensive it's going to be. I wouldn't be surprised if it's just scrapped in a few years time as sales are likely going to fall off hard once the majority of tourists catch wind of how poor value it is now.",

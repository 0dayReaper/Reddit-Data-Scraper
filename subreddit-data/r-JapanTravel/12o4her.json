    "postText": "\nHello r/japantravel!\n\nMy travel partner and I are planning an 18-day Japan trip, and the leg of the journey that is tripping us up the most is a travel-intensive 30 hours wherein we\u2019ll be traveling from Kanazawa -&gt; Shirakawa-go -&gt; Takayama -&gt; Okuhida -&gt; Takayama -&gt; Kyoto.  We\u2019d love your feedback on whether this is feasible and worth the rush, and whether we should cut something in order to add time to something else. We\u2019re attracted to the idea of spending some secluded time in the Japanese alps between our time in Tokyo and Kyoto, but it seems kind of counterproductive if we\u2019re stressed about bus deadlines the entire time.\n\nApril 28th to May 4th: Tokyo (including a day trip to Kamakura)\n  \nMay 4th: Travel to Kanazawa (either on Shinkansen OR Tateyama/Kurobe Alpine Route)\n\nMay 5th: Kanazawa\n\nMay 6th:  \n\t\u2022\t8:10 - Bus from Kanazawa  \n\t\u2022\t10:10 - Two hours in Shirakawa-go  \n\t\u2022\t12:30 - Arrive in Takayama, explore for about 3 hours (including lunch)  \n\t\u2022\t16:00 - Leave Takayama  \n\t\u2022\t17:30 - Arrive in Okuhida  \n\t\u2022\t18:00 - Dinner at Ryokan  \n\t\u2022\tEvening - Soak in onsen, either in private or a rotemburo elsewhere (any recommendations?)  \n\nMay 7th:  \n\t\u2022\t7:30 - Breakfast at Ryokan  \n\t\u2022\t8:51 - Bus to Shinhotaka Ropeway  \n\t\u2022\tMorning - Do Ropeway, maybe a mini-hike, and visit onsen for a few hours (either at the base station or the first station of the ropeway)  \n\t\u2022\t12:55 - Bus to Takayama  \n\t\u2022\t14:30 - Lunch in Takayama  \n\t\u2022\t15:34 - Train to Kyoto on the Hida Express\n\nMay 8th to May 12th: Kyoto, including half-day to Nara\n\nMay 12th to May 13th: Temple stay in Koya (so we\u2019re getting a ryokan experience here)\n\nMay 13th to May 15th: Osaka (we\u2019re departing from Osaka)\n\nThanks!",

You\u2019re back ending Kyoto which is the most sightseeing anyone does on their trip, so you\u2019re rushing through the Alps which is supposed to be relaxing only to end up in Kyoto stressed.\n\nCut the rope way and hike and just relax in the onsens and prepare for Kyoto.",

Would you mind elaborating on why it was so underwhelming?\n\nWe\u2019re planning to go from Takayama to Kanazawa stopping in Shirakwa-Go. Is there somewhere else you\u2019d recommend staying along the way instead?",

There\u2019s not that much there\u2026 it\u2019s a few blocks of gassho houses, with souvenir shops and snack stands in between. Even the official tourist map they give out says it takes 2-3 hours to see the entire village.",

    "postText": "My partner(26M) and I(26F) are going on our second trip to Japan and we\u2019ll be going to Hakone and Kawaguchiko for the first time as part of a two week trip in late September. It feels squeezed in, so we\u2019re wondering if this plan for Kawaguchiko and Hakone is too packed/unreasonable.\n\n9/22 Friday; Shinjuku&gt;Kawaguchiko:\n\n- Take an early bus from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko, Check into ryokan hopefully before noon, and have a lazy exploring day around the lake. We plan to book a room at Ubuya so we want to have a good amount of time to spend in it.\n\n9/23 Saturday; Kawaguchiko&gt;Hakone:\n\n-Have breakfast at Ubuya and be out the door 9/10am.\n\n-Take the bus down to Gotemba station and train to our Hakone accommodation near Hakone-Yumoto station to check in. This leg I anticipate will take 2.5 hours so we\u2019d probably be settled in Hakone by 1pm realistically.\n\n- After 1pm, we will just spend the afternoon doing the Hakone loop. We may skip the pirate ship and Open air museum since Owakudani and ropeway are the main things we want to check out.\n\n- Depending on what time the Ryokan dinner is (I heard they even do 5pm dinner for some reason) we may opt out of dinner to have more time to explore. \n\n9/24 Sunday; Hakone&gt;Kyoto:\n\n- not sure if we want to do a ryokan breakfast in Hakone. We might opt out to leave earlier.\n\n-Out the door early morning and head to Odawara where we take the Shinkansen to Kyoto for the rest of our trip. \n\nDay 9/23 worries me a bit. Can you do the Hakone loop in that amount of time?\n\nThanks in advance! First post in this sub :)\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the responses! After doing more research and considering the recommendations, we decided to skip Kawaguchiko for now, go from Tokyo to Hakone, spend the night there, then go about the rest of our trip and when we return to Tokyo near the end out of trip, we have three free days, so we\u2019ll see if we can take a day trip to Kawaguchiko on one of the days when the weather is good!",

Take the train back to Tokyo, and catch the RomanceCar to Hakone. The train/bus combo from Fuji to Hakone can run slower and actually take longer if you miss the bus between the locations, not to mention that the road is very twisty, the bus isn't really a luggage stowage bus, and there are multiple stops. \n\nThe best thing you can do is bus back to Tokyo and swap to the train to Hakone to ensure you're there by 1pm.",

Trains are great, but we\u2019re not very bus savvy. \n\nI think taking the train back to Tokyo is something we will definitely consider.\n\nWe\u2019re also considering a car rental - taking romance to Hakone from Tokyo, renting a car in Hakone, driving it up to Kawaguchiko, then the next morning drive it back down to Hakone to return it. Obviously we\u2019d have to figure that out and do our homework, but it\u2019s good to get an idea of the options we have!",

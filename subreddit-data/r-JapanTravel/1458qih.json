Seems like an instagram selfie trap, curious if you guys consider this a must*\n\nI am not on Instagram but I really enjoyed this. TeamLab Planets was one of the few tourist attractions that lived up to the hype. Allow 2-3 hours for entry and visit.  \n*Day 5- Kyoto*\n\nYour time in Kyoto is limited so I recommend staying near Gion. I booked  a private bedroom in a guesthouse (Gion Koh) but I also considered the hotel Terrace Kiyomizu. Consider packing a carry-on for 2 days and using a forwarding service to send any large luggage from Tokyo to Osaka. This will make getting around Kyoto and Hakone much easier.  \n\n\n*Day 6- Kyoto*\n\n*Early morning trip to Iwateyama Monkey park*\n\nSince you are going to Arashiyama anyway I recommend Sagano Onsen Tenzan-No-Yu and its excellent restaurant. One of the best meals I had in Japan was here. But if you are short on time there is a foot bath in the Randen streetcar station. Buy a ticket in the information booth and receive a free souvenir towel.  \n*Day 7- Osaka*  \n*Super Nintendo World- Only interested in this section of the park, do I need a ticket into USJ + a separate ticket for Nintendo world?*\n\nSuper Nintendo World is crowded and requires a timed entry reservation, which can be made at the park but may sell out. I invested in an Express Pass that included Mario Kart to make sure I got in. Also, there was a time limit in place when i visited but not sure how it is enforced. The other attractions worth a visit are Hollywood Dream coaster, Flying Dinosaur coaster, JAWS, and the soon to be closed Spider-Man. Most of the others are clones of Universal in LA. Skip Yoshi\u2019s Adventure, but don\u2019t skip the single rider lines; they can save you a lot of time.\n\n  \n*Day 8- Osaka/Nara*\n\n*I am interested in sight seeing train options to/from. Any suggestions on a route that may fit this schedule? I noticed the garden and temple close around 5pm.*  \nI ended up taking the JR Yamatoji Line in the morning to Nara and walked to the park from the JR station. The Kintetsu limited express will drop you off closer and the earliest train arrives before 10:00 (but there are no trains on Sunday). Your Nara schedule is doable in 1/2 a day. I explored Umeda/Pokemon/Nintendo stores in the afternoon upon returning to Osaka.",

I went there alone and felt a bit cringe with kids and their grandparents surrounding me. If you just wanna buy Kirby stuff you can directly visit their cafe shop. And if you really wanna try the food pls make sure to book online one month before your trip. \n\nAnd also remember to check the status of Gundam Base in DiverCity before you go. I went there when the Gundam was undergoing maintenance so the Gundam had no head on it!\ud83d\ude2d",

    "postText": "I\u2019m really uncomfortable right now. I tried to get rid of him by changing trains and he has followed me and started walking up and down the train. I\u2019m worried that when I arrive at the station and get of the train he\u2019ll spot me again. \n\nHe tried to invite himself on my day and to my hotel (I gave him some fake info to shut him up). \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure he isn\u2019t from Hiroshima himself as earlier, before he became creepy he was talking about his son in Okayama.\n\nI should probably tell security or something but I\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable about it. Especially not speaking Japanese. Maybe the man is just over enthusiastic or something. \n\nAm I overreacting? I think I won\u2019t do anything now as he hasn\u2019t found me yet, but if he does again I guess I\u2019m gonna have to get help..\n\nVery thankful for all the security on board of these trains right now! At least that makes me feel a little better. \n\nI\u2019m a solo female traveller btw.",

As such, they tend to only pursue cases they think they'll easily win, and they tend to play a much more active role in investigations. Since Japan does not have a plea bargain system, they have to reduce their caseload by indefinitely suspending most of their investigations. That is, the majority of arrests in Japan are not prosecuted.\n\nThe flip side is that cases which are prosecuted are almost universally convicted. This is similar to how federal prosecutors operate in the US, with similarly high conviction rates, though most of those cases don't make it to trial.",

I know you might feel uncomfortable, but your best course of action is to report it. Even if he's just drunk, either the station staff or police can handle him. It could be something as simple as the staff talking to him and letting you walk off, so he can't follow where you go.\n\n If you see/recognize him again and he follows you, I'd definitely find someone to report it too.",

Even English is fine. \n\nI\u2019ve had incidents like this, and one in particular, the guy followed me out of a bar (and he was old enough to be my dad) and wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. I kept walking away from him and just saying \u201cno\u201d to his requests or even ignoring him but he kept begging me. I tried going into a couple of convenience stores and just walking around in them to hopefully lose him or scare him away but he would wait for me outside or follow me inside. Finally I lost it, and in the convenience store with him following me around and harassing me I finally just said very loudly something like \u201cLEAVE ME ALONE\u201d or \u201cGO AWAY\u201d and he slunk out of there with his tail between his legs. These weirdos and creeps generally don\u2019t like attention being brought to them. Even if it\u2019s English and people might not completely understand, they get the gist of it and the loudness and how upset you look and get the message. And the creeps don\u2019t like it when suddenly everybody is staring at you guys. \n\nIt\u2019s better not to go to any dark alleyway, and stay in a public well lit place with people around. If you\u2019re very worried you can even tell the convenience store staff what\u2019s happening or ask them to call the police.

When you mentioned \u201cthe marines\u201d I thought of the US Marines.\n\nUnrelated pro tip: If someone mentions to you that they used\nto be in The Navy Seals or other covert fighting force, they are probably a fantasist. It\u2019s a huge red flag.\n\nThe Japanese self defense force don\u2019t have marines, as far as I know, and tend to be quiet scholarly soldiers and seamen. They are usually quite nationalistic and are not interested in foreigners in general.",

The ones that have tried to talk to me have also been a little weird, but I haven't experienced anything quite like that. I've generally indicated I'm busy so they leave me alone. Being on a train kind of means you can get trapped, so it's probably not the best place to strike up a conversation with a stranger, even in Japan.\n\nI don't think the police are as unhelpful as indicated in other posts, at least in situations like this. I wouldn't hesitate to head to a koban or ask the station staff for help.",

Be safe, stay safe at the end Japan is nice country with good people.\nBtw I am male.....",

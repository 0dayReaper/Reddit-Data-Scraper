    "postText": "Like many people in this subreddit, I also garnered quite a bit of knowledge for my trip to Japan here.  My travel is is also different than many others as my wife and I want to enjoy the pace of life and leisure in the cities we visit.  \n\nI'm also a big anime and Gundam fan and it's been several decades since either my wife or I have been in Japan.  We already had hit many of the major historical and tourist sites on our prior trips and those things really haven't changed so we decided to limit the number of typical tourist attractions.\n\nIn general, most folks are becoming more relaxex about Covid but please be polite and wear a mask on public transit.  I felt really embarrassed as other Americans were coughing or sneezing without a mask in crowded mass transit.  Don't be gross.\n\n# Context: \n\nWe live in the NY metro area and often go back and forth from LA to NJ but also spend time in Taipei and have good friends in Spain we visit for extended stays.  We're fairly well travelled and generally don't enjoy guided tours even though we've been on many.  Our travel style is to try to experience a bit of what it's like to live in the area and explore on our own based on local and researched recommendations but sometimes spontaneous whim.  We don't like to rush and go through the checklist but we're also impatient Northeastern folks and hate waiting unnecessarily.\n\nI love cities in general, part of the reason why I live near NYC even despite the fact that it's changed so much since after the pandemic.  \n\n**If you are more history or natural beauty focused on your trip, skip this report.**    \nWe generally aren't that limited in budget but tend to look for value instead of spending big.\n\n# Accommodations:\n\nWe ended up staying in an AirBNB because of location and space for the price.  We could have stayed in a more typical hotel but the rooms were all so small in comparison to the aparthotel we stayed in near the Tokyo Skytree.  We wanted some of the comforts of having laundry and a kitchen with real typical Japanese bath.  My wife loved taking baths with the bath salts she bought at the drug/cosmetic stores.  If you want to feel a bit more of the pace of life in Japan, definitely do this.  We don't wear shoes in the house so no issues there.  The aparthotel was cleaner than some 5 star hotels we've stayed in.  \n\n# On Sakura/Cherry blossoms:  \n\nOne of the main reasons for the trip was to try to catch the cherry blossoms.  Even though Taiwan has amazing cherry blossom displays as does NJ, we wanted to try to see it in Japan.  They are pretty much everywhere and definitely very nice.  BRING YOUR ALLERGY PILLS!  There is a ton of pollen in the air during this time so be prepared for full blown symptoms if you have a pollen allergy.  \n\nWe did take a lot of photos and some of the typical spots like Nakameguro were indeed very nice in the evening.  This is the FIRST sakura season since Japan reopened so the locals said it was much more crowded than usual.  \n\n# On Anime/Manga/Plamo shopping:\n\nIf you frequent the Gunpla subreddit you'll see me and others posting about the complete lack of stock of Gundam plastic models in Japan recently.  This was absolutely the case in Tokyo.  I hit nearly every store I could looking for Gunpla, all the big names and even the secondhand shops with very little luck.  There are basically zero RGs, very few MGs, and even HGs are limited.  If it's available, it's likely marked up above retail.  \n\nIf you're in the market for the more expensive figures, you may have better luck finding some secondhand deals.\n\nIf you like Shokugan, Gachapon, or crane prizes... secondhand stores like Surugaya are well worth it instead of rolling the dice or hunting for it.  Sure, it's kinda fun to try and play a bit or be surprised but if you're looking for something specific, secondhand stores are where it's at.\n\nWhile I didn't got to Ikebukuro to see the new Animate store, I did hit Akihabara, Shibuya, and Shinjuku thoroughly.  In general, the stock and merch was catering to the most popular series: One Piece, Demon Slayer, Chainsaw Man, Spy X Family, Jujutsu Kaisen, Tokyo Revengers, and some standbys like Dragonball, Naruto, and My Hero Academia.  You MAY get lucky and bump into a popup for a current anime you like but it always seemed like the best merch was usually sold out (Capcom store had ZERO Chun Li anything and the Bocchi popup was barren).  In general, if you see something and it's a price you can live with, **BUY IT**.  It's likely to be gone if you wait.  Definitely check to see if figures you're interested in are actually \"prize\" figures in crane machines.  If they are, it's possible that they are \"prize only\" figures and can vary WILDLY in price with some places charging double or triple some other stores for the same item.  Many suspect this is because of scalpers and the weak yen, I suspect there's some truth to that.\n\nIn general my opinion is that anime cafes aren't worth it unless there's specific merch you're looking for.  The food is generally \"OK.\"\n\n# On Cosmetics and Souvenir Foods shopping:\n\nIf you or your SO is into the cosmetics rabbit hole, there is a ton of choice in Tokyo but popular items will often be sold out as a matter of course.  You will need to do you research into what stores will have certain product lines.  Many of the staff will also speak English or Mandarin.  \n\nFor souvenir foods, the popular and original flavors/varieties are pretty much all locations but if the item states it's location exclusive, it absolutely is, so buy it if you want that specific flavor or variety. Lines move fast so don't be afraid you'll be stuck waiting to buy.\n\n# On Food: \n\nWe generally are spoiled when it comes to Japanese food and have a really high standard when it comes to what we consider \"excellent.\"  Our neighbor was an executive chef at one of the sushi \"pillars\" in NYC so we know what REAL good sushi is supposed to taste like.  We have had meals at the Michelin starred restaurants in NYC as well as the trendy spots in LA and Taipei.  So we have become fairly picky with our money as we know price or popularity doesn't always equate to quality.   When it comes to Chinese food, we're super picky as we're comparing to the best in HK, LA, and Taipei.  Even NYC doesn't really come close to those areas.  In general, Japan has a fairly high base level for food.  Unlike the US, their produce is fresh... but that's true of most countries.  We didn't eat ANY western food because we know we're likely to have had better elsewhere.  If you want to truly experience a culture, EAT like they do as well. \n\nIf you want to try the popular and trendy places, you MUST book in advance if possible OR have a local tell you the process and general expectation for wait times.  That being said, you do NOT need to have reservations all the time to eat well in Tokyo.  But likely, you will have to line up and wait regardless.  They do not do online queues or buzzers in most places, you just have to physically wait during the lunch/dinner rush especially.  Lines can move fairly quickly.  In some cases, they will sell out and simply cut the line off after you've waited for a while.  You can find great places without a long line though.  My wife and I hit a Michelin starred ramen shop early for lunch and managed to beat the rush and it was well worth it.  We went to a few high end izakayas and I highly recommend it as you'll always get a variety of dishes and drinks.  They are very reasonably priced compared with NYC and LA for similar quality.  We did only 2 kaiseki restaurants as those are fairly hard to book.\n\nThe Japanese restaurant diet is fairly carb and protein heavy.  I was glad we had our own fridge to be able to buy some of the beautiful high end Japanese fruit in a meager attempt to balance our diets during this vacation.  Strawberries were in season and quite delicious, especially the daifuku made from them.  Definitely eat what's in season or limited as it will sell out.\n\n**Yokohama Chinatown** was underwhelming.  It's good but not top notch quality and definitely cannot be compared to the best in the world.  I don't understand the Japanese obsession with Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) as the examples they have here are OK, not great.  \n\n**Shibuya Yokocho** was sold out of nearly everything we wanted during the weekend.  It was super popular and the food they did serve was good.  Suggest not visiting on Sundays as the earlier parts of the weekend will likely have cleaned out most of their food stocks.\n\n**Street food stalls** will drain a lot of your time if you want to try the popular things.  There is likely a competitor stall that is selling the same exact thing nearby and is of comparable quality.  I would say go early and try alternative stalls.  Example is that I was able to have Matsusaka Wagyu at a stall with a 4 person line instead of the massive 20+ person line for their famous Kobe competitor.  Tsujiki Outer Market was definitely fun... best to come around 9am-10am to catch some items before the lines get big at around 11am.  But if you're short on time, just skip.  You can get these foods without the wait. \n\n# On Sights: \n\nOur tourist sites we did see were Teamlabs Planet Tokyo, the Ghibli Museum, and the Yokohama Gundam and they were all great in their own ways.  Again, reserve tickets well in advance... all three sold out quickly.  Do your research and know when tickets go on sale.  We hit a popup events as well at random, and these were fun and a nice way to spend your time if you have the flexibility.  \n\nWe had family friends and our neighbor from NJ overlapping our stay in Tokyo so seeing them and enjoying the food and sights in Tokyo together was one of our primary goals.  The best experiences are ones shared.",

They're a bit pricey due to their small portioning.  Very inventive dishes as well.  The manager says he spent time in NY/Brooklyn so I can see inspirations from the trends there.\nDue Italian was my favorite ramen shop... you would think a cheese ramen would be weird but it was really quite good and unique.\nWe went into Tamahide Ichino in Solamachi Skytree on a whim and it really was surprisingly delicious, the oyakudon was so good and juicy.  Heritage chicken is still pretty rare in the US but this felt like what chicken sound really taste like.  Others say it's expensive but honestly the value for such quality was pretty great.",

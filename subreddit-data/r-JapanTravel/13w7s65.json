    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'll be going to Osaka for the first time in July for \\~ 5 days. I will be coming to Osaka from Kyoto. Following Osaka, I am spending a few days in Kobe and Hiroshima. I'm looking for a day trip to add to day 3. I've read some suggestions online, but am unsure which day trip would be the most worth it. Let me know if there is anything I should add/take away from my itinerary. Food suggestions would be awesome as well since I've heard Osaka has some of the best in Japan. Thank you :)!\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Osaka \\~ 5PM from Kyoto  \nExplore Dotonbori\n\nDay 2:   \nOsaka Aquarium  \nShinsekai  \nNamba\n\nDay 3: Day trip (undetermined)  \nKoyasan, Ise, Awaji Island, or Okayama? Other suggestions are welcome!\n\nDay 4: Himeji Day Trip  \nHimeji Castle  \nKoko-enen Garden  \nMiyuki Street  \nRevisit Dotonbori\n\nDay 5: Osaka Castle  \nOsaka Castle Park  \nTower Museum (most interesting floors?)  \nObservation Deck  \nShinsaibashi",

            "comment": "You seem to have split up trips to dotonbori, Namba and Shinsaibashi. Dotonbori is IN Namba. Then, Namba is right next to Shinsaibashi. And, I could probably throw a rock from Namba to shinsekai. My point is, you should just see all of these all at once because they are all in the same area. BTW, that entire area is considered the \u201cminami\u201d (south) area. There are a ton of funky vintage stores and crazy people watching that you can do in America Mura as well. You can pass through there on your way from Dotonbori to Shinsekai. There\u2019s also a high-end boutique shopping street on the other side of America Mura called Tachibana Dori. It\u2019s not as popular as it was back when I used to live in Osaka, but you\u2019ll be very close by. You\u2019ll also be 1 train stop (or a 15min walk) away from Nipponbashi which is the electronics district of Osaka so you may want to check it out. \n\nAlso, Umeda is conspicuously absent from from your list. It\u2019s the other big hub of Osaka in the \u201ckita\u201d (north) part of the city. It\u2019s not as gritty as the Namba/Shinabashi area but it has tons of cool stores shopping centers and restaurants. Look for the underground shopping area. You can walk for a few miles under Umeda and go from building to building without ever going outside. Go to Yodobashi camera if you\u2019re into electronics, I\u2019d suggest going to Yodobashi Camera. If you\u2019re into clothes, check out Hep5 or Hankyu department store.",

            "comment": "Aquarium tips: definitely buy tickets in advance if possible. Or get there earlier in the day. Check website for feeding times of your favorite animals. The ringed seals are delightful to watch getting fed. They are more or less the very last room/area in the aquarium. You can buy a backstage pass for about 1000 yen to look down from the top of the big aquarium tank. I recommend it. Its entrance is near the very beginning of the aquarium. You can see entry times on the website. You can pay as you enter the backstage rather than at the beginning if you prefer.",

Be advised that the scenic train from Shinjuku (Romancecar) is not operated by JR and therefore not covered by the JR rail pass. To get there via JR, you'd have to take the Shinkansen to Odawara and then take a connecting service. There's nothing wrong with either option, just be advised that if you had your heart set on the Romancecar [you'll have to pay extra for it.](https://www.odakyu.jp/english/passes/hakone/)\n\nRegarding Kyoto, I'd recommend seeing Nijo (if you must) on a different day, and doing Kinkaku-ji, Ryoan-ji, Taizo-in and then Arashiyama. Kinkaku-ji is one of Kyoto's must-see sites, and Taizo-in is probably my favourite \"underrated\" temple in Kyoto. All are about a 15-20 minute walk from each other, and are on the way to Hanazono station, from where you can take the train to Arashiyama.",

Plus, it\u2019s always nice to have more sets of eyes (I\u2019m getting a little overwhelmed!). We plan on now doing Kawaguchiko instead of Hakone (husband is adamant we try to see Fuji) and using the Fuji excursion train to get there. \n\nWould you mind if I DM you for some questions?",

            "comment": "I just got back and did Kyoto-Hakone-Tokyo. I would say your itinerary is good. For Kyoto, our least favorite site was the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. It was packed, full of people taking selfies or videos and it was fairly small. But Kyoto isn\u2019t as large as Tokyo so we were able to walk, or take the bus or subway to major sites. For a lot of the major sites, it\u2019s easily accessible by bus if the subway does not have a stop close by. Also, in Kyoto, I would recommend getting to some sites like Arashiyama and Fushimi Inari as early as possible. We got to Fushimi Inari around 8 am and by the time we left at around 9, it was packed with tour groups and students on field trips. \n\nFor Tokyo, for Team Labs, definitely wear shorts or pants you can easily roll up. Also, you\u2019ll find a lot of souvenirs by the Senso-ji temple. \n\nLastly, you\u2019ll need a small coin pouch for all the coins you\u2019ll get. I also recommend learning a few Japanese phrases to get by. It was definitely culture shock for my partner and I because we were so amazed by how respectful, polite and courteous the Japanese were (we\u2019re Americans lol). We just learned basic phrases in Japanese for good morning, excuse me, thank you, I don\u2019t speak Japanese, I don\u2019t understand or I would like one of these please. It wasn\u2019t much but those few phrases and google translate helped us get by for the most part.\n\nHere\u2019s the site I used to learn a few phrases:\n\n[Essential Japanese for Tourists](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-travel-phrases/)",

We actually never left the resort and just wanted a break from all the walking we did in Kyoto before heading to Tokyo. We do regret not spending two nights in total so we could explore the area. We ended up taking a taxi from Odawara station after taking the Shinkansen from Kyoto which was about \u00a53100. We drove through the town and it looked nice with plenty of shops and places to eat. The only negative I have about Hakone is that the ryokans can be a little expensive but ours did include a private onsen, full Japanese dinner and breakfast. I also got bit by some bug on my ankle while in Hakone that ended up getting infected, which resulted in me going to see a doctor in Tokyo and being placed on antibiotics. I thought it was a mosquito bite, but the dermatologist I saw said it wasn\u2019t that and he\u2019s not sure what bit me. So just be careful while you\u2019re there lol.",

It was a bit of a splurge since the price was about $700 USD total for one night for two people. It sounds expensive but it included a full kaseiki meal and Japanese breakfast along with amenities like access to all the communal onsens or you can reserve a private onsen for 45 mins. I recommend getting a room with a private onsen, but there was construction going on when we stayed there last week but it should hopefully be completed by the time of your visit. The ryokan was expanding by building a restaurant. Our room was kaede, which was closest to the construction area, but construction was paused after check-in and resumed after breakfast.",

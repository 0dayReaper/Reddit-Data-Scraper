    "postText": "Hello! I'm doing a solo trip to Japan next month, and I mainly wanted to go to watch the Valorant Masters Tokyo event, but they would not let me purchase tickets to most of the matches, so I only ended up getting two days of tickets... therefore I had to add a lot of things to my itinerary! This is my first time traveling internationally on my own, so I hope all of this is feasible/allows me to meet people along the way! Any advice/critique is welcomed. I do not plan to get a JR pass, but I will definitely be getting a suica card and a pocket wifi device. I would like to add a bar crawl of some sorts, but I am having trouble finding those experiences on sites like klook, so that I could go with other people. I'd also like to fit in some of these activities in the less defined itineraries of my days:  \n\n\n* biking\n* kintsugi class\n* glass-blowing class\n* notebook making class\n* cooking class\n* matcha tea making class  \n\n\nMy full 11 day itinerary:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* June 15 (Thu) - flight day \n   * flight at 6 am to detroit airport, small layover for 3 hours before the main flight.\n   * 14 hour flight to haneda (want to pull an allnighter beforehand and then fall asleep 2 hours into the flight so i can align myself with japan's timezone)\n* June 16 (Fri) - sleep it off - tokyo day 1\n   * Arrival at 1:45 pm\n   * Arrive to hotel by 4 pm (hopefully)\n   * Check in, get food, explore nearby area until bedtime\n   * Stay awake until 9 pm!!!!!!\n* June 17 (Sat) - tokyo day 2\n   * Morning explore tokyo -&gt; harajuku\n   * At night (depending) -&gt; izakayas in omoide yokocho alleyway\n   * Shinjuku for party hardy\n* June 18 (Sun) - tokyo day 3\n   * Morning explore tokyo -&gt; thrifting day p1\n   * At Night (depending) -&gt; shinjuku/roppongi\n* June 19 (Mon) - kyoto day 1\n   * check out of tokyo hotel #1, drop off luggage at kyoto hotel.\n   * Nara day trip -&gt; JR Nara Station - has tourist info and STARBUCKS\n   * Kofuku-ji temple (have to pay to enter some of the buildings)\n      * Central golden hall \n      * Southern Octogonal Halls\n   * Isuien Garden - several tea houses\n   * Todai-ji Temple\n   * Nara DEER Park and Mr. Wakakusa\n   * Kasuga-Taisha\n      * 3000 stone lanterns!!!!\n   * Higahimuki shopping street\n   * Mochiidono shopping arcade\n   * Go back and eat in kyoto, and then check into the kyoto hotel.\n* June 20 (Tue) - kyoto day 2\n   * explore kyoto\n      * nishiki market\n      * kinkaku-ji temple(golden pavilion)\n      * ippodo tea house\n      * kyoto international manga museum\n      * hatchohama/yuhigaura/hamakakezu beaches in north kyoto\n      * uji matcha\n      * KICHI KICHI OMURICE for dinner at 6pm\n* June 21 (Wed) - explore (osaka day 1)\n   * Super mario world and the rest of universal studios japan\n      * get there by 6:15 am\n* June 22 (Thu) - explore (osaka day 2)\n   * Stack up 7-11 food for outdoors adventures\n   * minoh waterfall\n   * arcades\n   * ghibli/pokemon/anime stores\n   * Teamlabs OSAKA\n   * Osaka castle and museum of history\n* June 23 (Fri) - tokyo day 4\n   * check out of kyoto hotel, drop off luggage at tokyo hotel #2\n   * Teamlab planets TOKYO\n   * Tsukiji market (fish and food!)\n   * Anime stuff in akihabara\n   * Thrifting p2\n   * Shibuya crossing\n   * Shinjuku for going out at night\n* June 24 (Sat) - tokyo day 5 - game day/explore in morning\n   * Valorant games at 12 pm (should last about 6 hours)\n   * dinner\n* June 25 (Sun) - tokyo day 6 - game day/explore in morning\n   * Valorant games at 12 pm (should last about 6 hours)\n   * dinner \n* June 26 (Mon) - tokyo day 7 - flight day\n   * Check out of the hotel whenever\u2026\n   * Eat breakfast/lunch\n   * Last bit of wandering in the tokyo area\n   * Take public transit/taxi to HND, get there by 12pm (i hope luggage isnt a big issue carrying it on public transportation)\n   * 1st Flight at 3:25 pm\n   * land 2:30 pm est in detroit, 3 hour layover\n   * Flight again to home!  \n\n\nDefinitely will need to pack one suitcase inside the other so I can bring souvenirs home...",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nSo wait on June 19th are you staying in Osaka or Kyoto?\n\nI think you are underestimating how long it is going to take you to get to Nara, especially if you want to go to your hotel in Osaka first.  It's about 2.5 hours from Tokyo Station to Kyoto Station. but the Hikari (covered by a JR Pass) only leaves 2x an hour.  You then need to transfer and take the train about 1 hour to Nara, you could then look for a locker, and then you need to take a bus or walk a good 30 minutes to actually get to any of the places people want to see  in Nara.  JR Nara Station is quite far from all the tourist sights, Kintetsu Nara Station is much closer, but a JR Pass won't cover Kintetsu because Kintetsu is not JR.  You can then go straight on either JR or Kintetsu to Osaka.\n\nThis is not meant to be rude, but uhh no you are not going to:\n\nhatchohama/yuhigaura/hamakakezu beaches in north kyoto\n\nI don't know if this was from an earlier itinerary and you meant to remove them.\n\nI suspect no one else has looked up exactly where those are, but they're up near Mine, and if you want to go there, that's pretty much an entire day, the only way you could maybe get in something else is with a rental car, and I think that would still be really hard.  The trains in that area just don't run that often and the train stations are not even close to the beaches, you will need to walk 5kms, pay a cab or work out small local buses that will have limited information in English.  you're looking at going to Toyooka and then needing to change for some sort local train!\n\n[https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3526.html?aFROM=2157\\_3525](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3526.html?aFROM=2157_3525)\n\nThose beaches are what you are going to cut from your itinerary.\n\nGood luck!",

I will not be getting a JR pass either, so I will try to take the train to the Kintetsu Nara Station. I am completely fine with cutting stuff out - to be honest I was worried I'd have the opposite problem, and just run through everything too quickly. Thank you!",

They run more often and are faster.  The only reason most tourists don't use them is the pass.  I think you can use Smart Ex to book a roundtrip ahead of time and save some money.\n\nI would just stay in Kyoto or Osaka, not both.  Which one depends on you.\n\nI like Starbucks too, but if you don't have a rail pass just use Kintetsu from Kyoto Station to Nara and you can use Kintetsu back to Osaka as well.  I've used private lines even with a rail pass because sometimes convenience is worth it since the train fares are generally not that much.  I hear there is a special Starbucks in Gion in Kyoto, but it gets terribly long lines.\n\nHeck, I would add in one of the activities you have listed, on your Kyoto day rather than the beaches.  Kyoto is a great place for some of them.  I know I have looked at notebook making classes and various textile themed classes.  I think a lot depends on how long you plan to spend in the manga museum and how long you want to spend in Uji, (and if you want to sightsee in Uji) since Uji is about 20 minutes south of Kyoto.  The actual Matcha farms are outside of town and you will need buses or a car to get there and the buses only run so frequently.  You can buy Uji match in the city part of Uji near the station.\n\nMimurotoji in Uji is a hydrangea temple, and it should be hydrangea season when you are there.\n\nI just think you need to map things out and get some idea of how long you want to spend places (or spend shopping) before deciding a day is empty.\n\nMy tween loves the Pokemon Center in Kyoto.  She prefers the 2 we went to in Osaka and the Kyoto branch to the ones we went in Tokyo.",

It all feels very full, personally I would look up all the transit times for the travel you're planning to do and that might help you see where you have too much. I don't know what to cut, I'm sure it's all amazing, just seems physically impossible!  \nEdit: Physically impossible for me personally I mean - if you're used to walking a lot and don't need as much rest you can probably do it just fine, so depends on your comfort level too.",

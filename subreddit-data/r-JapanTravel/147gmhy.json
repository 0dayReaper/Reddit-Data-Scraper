            "comment": "- Day 4\n\nWhat do you mean with \"Mt.Fuji\"? Where will you be going? Do you mean hiking Mt.Fuji, visiting Hakone or Kawaguchiko, somewhere else? \n\n- Day 6\n\nMany places in Japan close at 5pm, that includes Osaka Castle. You should see Osaka Castle first thing and then spend the rest of the day in Nara so you can enjoy Nara more leisurely without thinking about running back to Osaka before the castle closes.\n\n- Day 8\n\nThese places are not in the same area. What do you wish to see in Higashiyama? Gion? Kiyomizudera? The Philosopher's Path? Try and make some sort of route because Higashiyama can easily take up more than a full day. As above, temples close at 5pm, so start at Kinkakuji as soon as it opens, have breakfast/lunch at Nishiki and then spend the rest of the day in Higashiyama. That's a more efficient use of time.\n\n- Day 9\n\nNote that Enoshima is not in Tokyo. It's a day trip from Tokyo but it takes almost two hours to get there considering the train transfers. Realistically, it's difficult to be there and back and then off to Narita to get there by 4pm, let alone with a visit to TeamLabs and Mailish in the midst. The only way I can see that is if you're up at 6am or something. If Enoshima is truly a must-see, consider doing it as a day trip some other day.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for your comment.\n\nWe're still deciding on exactly what we'll be doing in Mt. Fuji which is why I kept it vague. A tour would be good but the majority are 10-12 hours with most of that being a slow bus ride from/to Tokyo. I haven't been able to find tours that convene and end in/around Mt. Fuji yet. I was also potentially thinking of foregoing any tours so if the weather isn't clear, we can shuffle the itinerary around a bit and try to do Mt. Fuji on the way back to Tokyo. We don't want to hike it, just hopefully be able to see most or all of it.\n\nThanks for the tip on Osaka castle, I had seen some closed at 5 PM but I must've missed that one.\n\nGood question regarding day 8. This trip will be with my partner and friend, and Higashiyama was a location they wanted to see. No clue exactly what they want to see there yet but I can't control every stop at the trip.\n\nI thought Enoshima was only about an hour from Tokyo? If it is two hours each way then yeah we will potentially need to remove this from the itinerary. This was another location my friend wants to visit, I'm not that particularly interested in seeing Enoshima myself. We were planning to be up extra early that day anyway to squeeze the last things in so I guess we'll see.",

I'm pretty happy with our itinerary for Tokyo but I know you can spend a month there exploring without seeing everything.\n\nHonestly with Kyoto, it's not going to be a popular opinion but I couldn't find that much that interests me outside of Fushimiinari Shrine. I know it was once the capital of Japan and must be teeming with history and amazing things to see/do though, and I'm just not aware of it.",

So you\u2019ll need to stop at cafes at the very least to recover! Also commute times/ even navigating station entries and exits is a lot and eats away at your day. Not trying to discourage you but good for thought for your friend too!! It all looks easy on a map but my god it\u2019s challenging going from place to place - we were shocked at the station sizes! It\u2019s a whole mini city underground and while the trains are frequent, getting to the one you need can be a trek. Good luck!! And have the best time!!",

TeamLabs is also quite far out/ random to get to with not a lot around it, and you\u2019ll want to spend at least 2 hours there. Do you have a lot of luggage? How will you take it to teamLabs and then to the airport? Also just look up close times for the parks - I think the Shinjuku one closes at 5pm and it costs to get in so you\u2019ll want to try and get your moneys worth. Those are just some quick thoughts!

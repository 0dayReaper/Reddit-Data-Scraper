I went to Fushimi Inari one time at 6am which was perfect as there was only a few people meandering about. Was there for about an hour or 2 and it started getting busy. This was in the summer. Also arrive at USJ before 8am if you don't have express passes.",

The first time I went to Fushimi Inari I went in the evening and saw the sunset.  It was me and maybe six other people.  It was cool.  Also,  you may want to rethink spending an entire day at Fushimi Inari.  It\u2019s cool but doesn\u2019t really need an entire day.  \n\nThe monkey park is pretty fun.\n\nI\u2019d recommend adding these to Kyoto: Kiyomizu temple, sanjusangendo, Kodaiji.\n\nNara is definitely worth a visit.",

When we were there about a week ago we were arriving to places between 7:00 and 7:30 and there were still dozens or hundreds of people around, depending on the weather and day of the week.",

I never by stuff at the busy streets. Often you can find both food and souvenirs that are the same just down a side street (if you want to be a bit economical).\n\nBasic words for items and \u201cwhere is\u201d makes it a lot easier, the English varies and many restaurants don\u2019t speak English (but they are nice and will try to understand what you want.\n\nHave a really nice trip!",

I was able to pick up nice Japanese yukatas for gifts (less formal than kimonos) for around 5000 Y ($40ish)\n\nAnother gem city you may consider is Minoh. They are known for a lovely waterfall (beautiful hike and monkeys if you are lucky,) and momiji tempura, which is battered and fried maple leaves \ud83c\udf41 (sweet.) You will pass several street vendors frying them up live. And the third and maybe coolest thing is the Minoh Beer Warehouse (craft brewery and tap room, which is rare in Japan.) Really great beers and swag, good pizza and sandwiches too",

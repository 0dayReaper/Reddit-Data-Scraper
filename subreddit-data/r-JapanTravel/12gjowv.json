    "postText": "Hi Everyone, I'm just a bit confused about whether the nohi bus will still be running on **new years eve of 2023.** i'm planning to be in takayama on the 30th of december and go to shirakawago on the 31st of december. But I just wanted to confirm (if anyone knows):\n\n* Is the **nohi bus** still running from Takayama to Shirakawa-go during new years **eve** (31 dec)?\n* Is Shirakawa-go still open on new years **eve**?\n\nI've done some research and from the nohi bus website [https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/highwaybus/kanazawa\\_en/#fare](https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/highwaybus/kanazawa_en/#fare) Their timetable says that \"\u25c6\u2026No Buses operating on Sat, Sun, National holidays, Aug.13-15, Dec.29-Jan.3\" but the **\u25c6 symbol only applied to buses after 19:00 (7pm).** If anyone has traveled to Shirakawa-go successfully during new years eve, please let me know\n\n***Update! (14 April) I messaged the Hida Takayama Instagram page, who said \"unfortunately from 29th December to 3rd January Nohi bus to Shirakawa-go is not running\".***",

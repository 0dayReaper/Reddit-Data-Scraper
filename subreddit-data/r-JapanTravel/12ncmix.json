    "postText": "Hello, please find my itinerary for my next trip to Japan. For information, I\u2019ve lived 4 months in Japan as a student and already travel there mostly in Kyushu and Shikoku. I\u2019ve already been to Kyoto and Tokyo that\u2019s why I decided to skip these cities for this trip.\n\nFor this trip I\u2019ll start from Nagoya and then go to Fukuoka to meet one of my friend who live there. It will be my first time that I'll be there in August, depending on how I deal with the heat I might skip some of the things that I want to see. After all I also go there to rest.\n\nI\u2019ve studied in Nagoya, I\u2019m quite familiar with the city. It will allow me to go back to some of my favorite place and take it easy as I recover from the jet lag.\n\nDay 0 \u2013 04/08/23 : Nagoya \n\nI land at 9 pm, take the train to the hotel, check-in and look for something to eat before going to bed.\n\nDay 1 \u2013 05/08/23 : Nagoya\n\n* Atsuta Jingu\n* Shirotori Garden\n* Maglev and Railway Park\n* Diner in Sakae\n\nDay 2 \u2013 06/08/23 : Nagoya\n\n* Inuyama (Castle and Daishoji Temple)\n* Nagoya Castle\n* Osu Kannon\n\nFor the second part of my trip, I decided to stay in Osaka as I didn\u2019t visit it the last time I was in Japan. I want to have a taste of the city, I\u2019ll take 2 days in the city and then travel from Osaka to the surrounding cities.\n\nDay 3 \u2013 07/08/23 : Nagoya -&gt; Kyoto -&gt; Osaka\n\n* Nagoya Station take the train to Kyoto\n* Gion Area and Kiyomizu-dera\n* Train to Osaka for check-in\n* Dottonbori at night\n\nDay 4 \u2013 08/08/23 : Osaka\n\n* Osaka Castle Park\n* Osaka Tenman-g\u00fb\n* Umeda Sky Building\n* DenDEn Town\n\n\nDay 5 \u2013 09/08/23 : Osaka\n\n* Tsutenkaku/Shinsekai\n* Shi Tenno-Ji\n* Abeno Harukas\n* Sumiyoshi-Taisha\n\nDay 6 \u2013 10/08/23 : Osaka \u2013 Nara Day Trip\n\n* Nara Parc\n* Nara City Museum of Photography\n* Heijo Palace\n\n \nDay 7 \u2013 11/08/23 : Osaka \u2013 Kobe Day Trip\n\n* Sorakuen Garden\n* Mount Rokko\n* Kobe City Hall\n\nDay 8 \u2013 12/08/23 : Osaka -&gt; Himeji -&gt; Matsue\n\n* Leave early for Himeji\n* Himeji Castle\n* Bus/Train to Matsue\n\nFor the third part, I wand to experience a less populated city and take it easy while seeing good landscapes.\n\nDay 9 \u2013 13/08/23 : Matsue\n\n* Daikon Island\n* Yuushien Garden\n* Matsue City Center and Castle\n* Maybe rent a car and explorer the coast\n\nDay 10 \u2013 14/08/23 : Matsue\n\n* Izumo Taisha\n* Hinomisaki Lighthouse if the weather is ok\n* Onsen\n\nDay 11 \u2013 15/08/23 : Matsue -&gt; Hiroshima\n\n* Bus to Hiroshima\n* Peace Memorial Park\n* Hiroshima Castle\n* Baseball Game\n\nDay 12 \u2013 16/08/23 : Hiroshima\n\n* Miyajima Day\n\nDay 13 \u2013 17/08/23 : Hiroshima\n\n* Onomichi\n* Rent a bike and do a part of the Shimanami Kaido\n\nDepending on the weather and how tired I am, I might change for Etajima.\n\nDay 14 \u2013 18/08/23 : Hiroshima -&gt; Fukuoka\n\nIn Fukuoka, I\u2019m meeting a friend, the pace will be more relaxed as I go there mostly to catch up with him and I\u2019ve already visited the city.\n\n* Train to Fukuoka\n* Gion Area\n* Ohori Park\n* Yatai\n\nDay 15 \u2013 19/08/23 : Fukuoka\n\n* Dazaifu\n* Kurume\n\nDay 16 \u2013 20/08/23 : Fukuoka -&gt; Kyushu\n\nI\u2019m still not decided on where to go for 2 days in Kyushu.

If you have some recommandations for a destination not too far (2 hrs) from Fukuoka where I can spend 2 days. If there are some things that are worth visiting and that I miss, please tell me so that I can see if I can fit it in my itinerary.",

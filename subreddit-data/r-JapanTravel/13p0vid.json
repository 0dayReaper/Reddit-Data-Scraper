    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m deep in the planning for our four-years-delayed honeymoon to Japan in early June. My husband is a huge pro wrestling fan and we are going to a NJPW show in Tokyo and a Stardom show in Osaka. He\u2019s also super keen to hit up anything pro-wrestling adjacent while we are there - we are going to the NJPW shop, the Haoming Shop (a wrestling clothier), Ribera Steakhouse (famous with pro wrestlers), you get the picture. \n\nAny other shops, cafes, or restaurants in the world we could add to the itinerary in Tokyo, Kyoto, or Osaka? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Go to the Ribera in Gotanda. That\u2019s the original. It\u2019s in a business district, so the streets are dead at night when they\u2019re open, but it\u2019s still a safe area. The other one is bigger and is usually the one wrestlers go to now, but Gotanda is the one where the 80s gaijins went. I think a half-pound steak and a Coke was like $35. It\u2019s a counter that seats maybe 8 people, so you may or may not get a seat together after a little wait. Vibes are amazing. \n\nToudoukan is technically a pro wrestling shop, but it doubles as a museum of ring-used items. They have a gorgeous display of masks, some of which are signed and bloodied and worth a lot of yen. They have a huge catalog of old magazines and tapes. Neat aisle of little toys and figures. They also have some used t-shirts from various companies. It\u2019s in Bunky\u014d, so it\u2019ll be close to Korakuen (if that\u2019s where the Tokyo NJPW show is going to be). I got a Nakamura shirt and a little Tiger Mask figurine from there.\n\nDef visit Haoming. It\u2019s a bit of a walk but it\u2019s so cool. You have to go inside the lobby of a building and then down the stairs. I think they remodeled it since I\u2019ve been there, but they had a wall of photos of wrestlers that have been there. Shirts are expensive (mine was like 4500\u00a5), but super cool. They also have some neat stuff on display like Kenny Omega\u2019s tights from his 2/3 falls match at Dominion. The workers there are really cool.\n\nYou could also visit the NJPW Dojo if you wanted to add an extra stop. It\u2019s in a residential area, but it might be neat to see the outside of the building where so many pro wrestlers were trained.",

You'll either need to do it on the day (I've done this at Korakuen, lined up an hour early for good seats) or find a third party to do it on your behalf.\n\nNJPW from is easier AFAIK.  \n\n\nFor other things, I'd suggest taking a look at Shinjuku Face - they have various events on quite often and tickets can be bought online.",

They also have a fantastic amount of ring worn gear to behold, a lot of which is for sale if one has that much to spend.  \n\nI was in Japan in March and am a big wrestling fan, so I saw lots of shows etc. If he was at all interested in catching a smaller show, there are ways to reserve tickets with the promotions and/or wrestlers.  One I can think of even has an English form you can email to them to make the reservation (Tokyo Joshi Pro Wrestling).  I'd be happy to answer any further questions as well.\n\nOne other spot might be Korakuen Hall, near the Tokyo Dome.  It's one of the most historic and important venues for wrestling in Japan.  Might be neat for him to see the place where so many big shows have happened, if only from the outside.",

    "postText": "Hello all, In a few weeks we will be going to Japan for the first time and we're planning our transport across Japan. I've read the FAQ and did some research but have some remaining questions. I'd also like to ask you to check if I'm not mistaken about some interpretations (see routes at the end of the post).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will travel from Tokyo to Nagano (Karuizawa) to Kyoto to Osaka and back to Tokyo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Suica website states \"The Suica cannot be used for continuous travel between areas\" and says something about leaving and re-entering.\n\n* Does this mean that I need to step off the last stop of the suica region and then re-enter for the remainder of the trip (with a regular ticket)?\n\nFor example: I travel from Karuizawa to Shiojiri. Karuizawa is inside the [map](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/routemaps/pdf/RouteMap_majorrailsub.pdf) on the suica website: Shiojiri is not. Do I need to get off at J\u014detsumy\u014dk\u014dand and re-enter with a normal ticket?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* When buying a separate ticket for Express trains: what do I do with each ticket? Put the normal fare ticket in the slot at the gates and hold on to the other one?\n* Sometimes when trying to get a route off google maps it'll say something like: Shin-Osaka to Station Nagoya (Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen \"Nozomi 10 Nozomi Tokyo\") and from Station Nagoya (Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen \"Hikari 646 Hikari Tokyo\") to Odawara station.- What does google maps mean that will happen in Nagoya Station? I would remain seated on the shinkansen? Or do I need to re-enter the gates?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe route I'm planning on taking.

            "comment": "&gt; The Suica cannot be used for continuous travel between areas\n\nIt means it will give an error if you continue on the train, which may be or may not be fixable and you end up with a broken IC card until you come back into its primary region.\n\nIf you intend to travel cross-region - you should use paper tickets, local or national passes.\n\n&gt; Karuizawa is inside the map on the suica website: Shiojiri is not. Do I need to get off at J\u014detsumy\u014dk\u014dand and re-enter with a normal ticket.\n\nKaruizawa to Shiojiri would most likely be a trip to Nagano (shinkansen or third-party Shinano Railway) and then taking a train to Shiojiri via Matsumoto. You should generally buy a normal ticket (JR) or tickets for that since you could be losing quite a bit of money on non-continous base fare in the first case.\n\n&gt; When buying a separate ticket for Express trains: what do I do with each ticket? Put the normal fare ticket in the slot at the gates and hold on to the other one?\n\nNormal fare for normal gates. Normal fare and shinkansen surcharge for shinkansen gates.\n\n&gt; What does google maps mean that will happen in Nagoya Station\n\nIt means that you will need to transfer trains within shinkansen part of Nagoya station. And I sincerely recommend using Jorudan or Navitime, rather than Google Maps.\n\n&gt;  (Going to Tokyo teamlab planets)\n\nEvery bit of public transport in Tokyo except Tokaido shinkansen and highway buses supports major IC cards including Suica. You probably should not use it on JR East's run shinkansen since it gets a little more complicated than that.\n\n&gt; (visiting Asukayama Park on our way to Karuizawa)\n\nSuica to Omiya. Omiya to Karuizawa - probably paper ticket is a better idea. \n\n&gt;  (Staying at Shiojiri for a day trip to Narai because we didn't find a place to stay in narai within our budget)\n\nKaruizawa to Nagano depends on a mode of transport (see above). Nagano to Shiojiri - paper ticket with limited express surcharge if using Limited Express Shinano\n\n&gt; (The trip to Narai itself)\n\nWhatever fits your schedule better (with regard to train or cash). Unless it's a highway bus - you probably need to pick-up paper ticket or token for the bus and give it to driver, while exiting and pay your fare in exact cash.\n\n&gt;  (Doing the Tsumago-Magome hike and staying in Magome)\n\nShiojiri to Nagiso: paper ticket; local buses: cash\n\n&gt;    (Going from Magome to Kyoto)\n\nLocal buses: cash; Nakatsugawa to Nagoya - you can technically use Suica for base fare (not recommend it since you will lose money); Nagota to Kyoto: Tokaido shinkansen does not support IC cards\n\nYou should buy tickets from Nakatsugawa to Kyoto, including for Tokaido shinkansen (Nagoya to Kyoto), whether you will use JR Chuo line commuter train or pay surcharge for Shinano is up to you.\n\n&gt; (Sightseeing within Kyoto: Bamboo forest &amp; Shrine)\n&gt;\n&gt; (Traveling to Osaka)\n\nAll important local transport in Kansai is major IC-card compatible.\n\n&gt; (From Osaka back to Tokyo, stopping at Odawara and travel luggage free to Hakone)\n\nYou should buy Osaka area to Odawara ticket (including Shin-Osaka to Odawara shinkansen surcharge). Hakone area transit is covered by IC cards.\n\nAs far as getting to Keikyu-Kamata: take regular JR train to Yokohama station and switch to Keikyu there.",

            "comment": "&gt; Does this mean that I need to step off the last stop of the suica region and then re-enter for the remainder of the trip (with a regular ticket)?\n\nYou would buy paper ticket. You can absolute leave and re-enter, but buying paper ticket is easier and cheaper.\n\n&gt; For example: I travel from Karuizawa to Shiojiri. Karuizawa is inside the map on the suica website: Shiojiri is not. Do I need to get off at J\u014detsumy\u014dk\u014d and and re-enter with a normal ticket?\n\nFor Shinkansen to local line connection you want paper ticket anyway.\n\n&gt; When buying a separate ticket for Express trains: what do I do with each ticket? Put the normal fare ticket in the slot at the gates and hold on to the other one?\n\nPut both in.\n\n&gt; Sometimes when trying to get a route off google maps it'll say something like: Shin-Osaka to Station Nagoya (Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen \"Nozomi 10 Nozomi Tokyo\") and from Station Nagoya (Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen \"Hikari 646 Hikari Tokyo\") to Odawara station.- What does google maps mean that will happen in Nagoya Station? I would remain seated on the shinkansen? Or do I need to re-enter the gates?\n\nThat mean you transfer from Nozomi 10 to Hikari 646 at Nagoya station. You don't need to leave the gate, but you need to change trains.\n\n&gt; Omiya Station &gt; Karuizawa Station: Hokuriku-Shinkansen (Super-express?: Do a one-time setup on Suica + Super-Express ticket)\n\nYou can buy ticketless tickets, but it might be easier to just buy paper ticket.\n\n&gt; Karuizawa Station &gt; Nagano Station: Hokuriku-Shinkansen (Super-express?: Cannot use Suica since it would travel outside the IC card area, so buy 2x tickets at the ticket vendor machine?) Nagano Station &gt; Shiojiru Station: Shinano (Limited- Express: Cannot use Suica since it does not cover Nagano area? so buy 2x tickets as normal?)\n\nYou go to ticket counter and ask for ticket to Shiojiri. The basic fare will be through calculated, and your Shinano limited express ticket will be 50% off due to connection discount.\n\n&gt; (The trip to Narai itself) (Going from Magome to Kyoto)\n\nThe TOICA IC card area starts from Nakatsugawa, so you can use IC card from Nakatsugawa to Nagoya. But again, buying paper ticket direct from Shiojiri to Kyoto will be cheaper. You are allowed stopovers on this route with paper ticket.\n\n&gt; Kyoto Station &gt; Osaka Station: Tokaido-Sanyo Line (Special Rapid: Suica? No additional ticket needed on Rapid (don't know about \"special rapid\"?))\n\nYou don't need any additional ticket on Special Rapid either.\n\n&gt; (From Osaka back to Tokyo, stopping at Odawara and travel luggage free to Hakone)\n\nJust buy paper ticket direct from Osaka to Odawara. But if you use Smart EX, then you need to pay for Osaka-Shin-Osaka separately with IC card.\n\n&gt; Odawara Station &gt; Shinagawa Station: Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen (Limited-Express: Suica + ticket)\n\nShinkansen doesn't work that way. Either you use Smart EX so it's just single IC card, or you use paper ticket.\n\n&gt; Shinagawa Station &gt; Keikyu Kamata Station: Keikyu Main Line (Limited-Express: Suica + ticket)\n\nYou don't need additional ticket for limited express on Keikyu line.",

                            "comment": "Correct, you can get out of stations without voiding the ticket. I am not sure if Nagiso station has automatic ticket gate -- if it does, it would return your ticket when you exit the station. If not, tell the station staff \"stopover\" and they will stamp your ticket for stopover.\n\nFor Shiojiri to Kyoto via Nagoya, the ticket will be valid for 3 calendar days including your start date. So as long as you spent 2 nights or less you will be fine.\n\nThe limited express/Shinkansen ticket don't allow stopover, but basic fare ticket does. That mean, for example, if you are travelling from Tokyo to Kyoto with a stopover in Nagoya, you can buy basic fare from Tokyo to Kyoto, but the Shinkansen supplement ticket need to be separated to Tokyo-Nagoya, Nagoya-Kyoto.\n\nThough I just calculate your fare from Shiojiri-Nagiso-Kyoto and you save like 100 yen so if you prefer simplicity you can just buy ticket separately.\n\nYou can also probably do Shinjuku-Omiya-Karuizawa-Nagano-Shiojiri-Nagoya-Kyoto on single basic fare ticket too with a more saving but I wouldn't want to recommend it because you are going to have to explain the route to the station office.",

So you can use a Suica to travel between Osaka and Kyoto (even though Suica is a JR East Card) but you cannot use a Suica to travel between Osaka and Tokyo (because JR East and JR West are two different regions.)\n\nSome regions have their own special IC card that is not part of this national network. For example, Ayuca is used by buses around Gifu. You can't use a Suica on these buses, nor can you use Ayuca on JR trains. For most transport suituations though, you can use a Suica or equivalent national card.",

You need to pay extra for train tickets such as Shinkansen or limited express trains. \n\nIf your Suica doesn\u2019t work for a particular route just pay for the ticket manually.

In these super remote places it does not you can pay by cash. \n\nLimited express tickets should be bought in ticket machines in train stations. They rarely sell out unless during national holidays.\n\nSuper express is Shinkansen, to be bought on the ticket machine or online on Ekinet or bypassed by having a JR Pass. Transfers usually not required as long it's on the same line. Different types (Nozomi, Kodama, Sakura, etc.) on the same line stop on a different number of stops.",

I know it\u2019s not as big of a deal, but looking for ideas for something fun for Halloween if anything is going on or cool to check out!\n\nMy husband (M35) hasn\u2019t been to Japan since he was 3 years old (his family is from Osaka but we won\u2019t be seeing anyone, long story), and it\u2019s been 13 years since my one and only trip there! Due to this, we are looking at classic sights while also taking our time to just explore. This is my itinerary so far and areas of interest I\u2019ve used to build it. Let me know if I should switch around things! Also if there are other places I might\u2019ve forgotten about, please mention! Last time I went it was with a tour with my school, so this is my first time planning something like this. We want a nice mix of cultural sightings, pop culture, and feeling less stress to hit EVERYTHING.\n\nSaturday Oct 21:\n\nFly to Japan (Haneda)\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSunday Oct 22 Tokyo:\n\nArrive in Japan early evening \n\nCheck into hotel\n\nAkihabara/chill depending on energy\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nMonday Oct 23 Tokyo:\n\nDisney Sea (celebrating anniversary!)\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nTuesday Oct 24 Tokyo:\n\nTsukiji Fish Market (early AM)\n\nHarajuku\n\nShibuya\n\nShinjuku (*edit* added)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWednesday Oct 25 Kyoto:\n\nCheck out of hotel in Tokyo\n\nTravel to/check in at Kyoto \n\nNishiki Market\n\nEikando Zenrinji Temple\n\nPhilosopher\u2019s Path\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThursday Oct 26 Kyoto:\n\nArashiyama Early AM\n\nMeet up with friend that lives in Kyoto\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nFriday Oct 27 Kyoto:\n\nFushimi Inari-taisha Shrine Early AM\n\nGhibli Park in Nagoya if possible\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nSaturday Oct 28 Kyoto:\n\nNara Day Trip\n\nNara Park\n\nTodai-ji \n\nIsuien Garden\n\nKasuga Taisha\n\nCome back to Kyoto \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSunday Oct 29 Osaka:\n\nCheck out of hotel in Kyoto\n\nTravel to Osaka\n\nOsaka Castle\n\nHozenji\n\nDontonbori \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nMonday Oct 30 Osaka:\n\nKuromon Market\n\nUofuku (for uni &amp; oysters!)\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nTuesday Oct 31 Osaka:\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nWednesday Nov 1 Tokyo:\n\nCheck out of hotel in Osaka\n\nTravel to Tokyo/check into hotel\n\nSkytree\n\nPok\u00e9mon Center\n\nAsakusa \n\nSensoji Temple \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThursday Nov 2 Tokyo:\n\nFuji Five Lakes (Kawaguchiko) \n\nFree time for things we might\u2019ve missed/come back to \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nFriday Nov 3 Tokyo:\n\nCheck out of hotel\n\nEither explore Tokyo a bit more or relax at airport. \n\nWill probably send luggage to airport\n\nEvening flight out of Haneda\n\nFly home\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAreas of interest:\n\nTokyo: \n-teamLabs\n\n-Disney Sea\n\n-Akihabara\n\n-Harajuku \n\n-Shibuya Crossing\n\n-Skytree\n\n-Tsukiji Fish Market\n\n-Aichi Expo Park Studio Ghibli Park \n\n(Nagoya under 2 hours bullet train from Tokyo)\n\n-Studio Ghibli Museum\n\n-Bus to Mt.

It's truly an amazing park but it makes for a tiring day, so might be worth considering doing that a different day.\n\nAlso I highly recommend checking out Shinjuku as well, it's pretty close to Harajuku.\n\nHope you have a great trip!",

We chose that day as it\u2019s our anniversary and we went to Disneyworld for our honeymoon, so we thought it was perfect lol from what I remember last time, I stayed awake the whole flight (13 hrs or so, leaving early afternoon our time), and by the time we landed it was early evening. I was hoping with the same flight schedule we will have this time, we should be able to get enough rest before the next day! That\u2019s why I was keeping our arrival date chill if we decide not to do Akihabara that night. I also forgot to add Shinjuku!!",

Personally, I feel really exhausted after a long flight and time zone change, plus I'm also kinda hard core about Disney lol (I do park open to close and try to do a lot). But maybe you guys experience less jet lag and/or can have a more chill park day with extra breaks to take in all the scenery, just something to keep in mind. Honestly you know yourselves best :)",

My husband has no patience, so we will get done whatever we can get done without feeling like we have to do everything lol With it being a unique park, there\u2019s some things we will want to hit, some not. DisneySea looks less packed ride-wise compared to Tokyo Disneyland, and the rides will be where our priorities will be. We would do Disneyland but there\u2019s enough repeats there that we\u2019ve done at the US parks. I\u2019m more excited for the food than anything else! Haha and this is if we can even get tickets!!",

            "comment": "How early will you be in Tsukiji?  Try to squeeze in a visit to Meiji Jingu shrine after Tsukiji and before heading to Harajuku.  It's a very nice serene walk from Harajuku Station's West Entrance to the shrine.\n\nFor DisneySea, what an awesome way to spend your anniversary in!  We visited there for the first time ever a couple of weeks ago on our trip and I can see why a lot of critics say it's the best Disney Theme Park in the world.  The amount of detail put into the theming and atmosphere of that park is mind blowing.  The Mysterious Island section alone was so worth the admission.  Just note if you're taking the Keiyo Line there from Tokyo Station, the platform is a very long walk from the main Tokyo Station building.  That was a big surprise for us when we went.\n\nAkihabara - time this on a Sunday afternoon from 1 PM to 5 PM.  The main street becomes pedestrian only and for me who hails from a car centric city, it was an amazing feeling just shopping from one side of the street to the other without having to worry about car traffic.  It felt liberating.\n\nAs for anything missed or other places to add, maybe Himeji and a visit to the castle there.  Asakusa you can combine with a Skytree visit.\n\nHave a wonderful trip and enjoy your anniversary :)",

Universal studios could be a fun Halloween idea. I thouhht Nara was lovely but could have been done in a day and then had Kobe as something to do for the evening (didnt feel both were worth a day each). Kinosake Onsen and Halone were both lovely places for having that Ryokan and onsen experience. Oh and reserve restaurants where you can. Every good rated food or coffee place on google or TripAdvisor had queues spanning from 1-3 hours",

It\u2019s super packed with tourists, scenic spots are meh and food isn\u2019t remarkable. My fondest memories of Japan don\u2019t include anything kyoto related at all.\n\n3) For Osaka, I suggest a day trip to himeji castle and to skip Osaka castle.\n\n4) nishiki, kuromon and Tsukiji markets are all tourists traps. Seafood is usually pricey and not all are extremely fresh or to die for. The only good experience I had was in Tsukiji market with a dinner reservation at a grilled tuna restaurant.\n\n5) I drove to kawaguchiko from Shizuoka and I\u2019m glad I did. If you do not have a car it\u2019s quite inconvenient once you are there.",

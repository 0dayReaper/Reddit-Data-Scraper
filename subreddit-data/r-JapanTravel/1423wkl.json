    "postText": "Hello, visiting Tokyo for 5 nights in July with my wife and two kids(12 and 14), on our way back to the US from South Korea, figured we would pop in to Tokyo for a few days and extend the trip while we are out that way.  We have rented a place near Shibuya Station. Itinerary is below, would be great to get some opinions. Thursday\u2019s plan seems a little packed but the stop durations and time to travel seem doable (could cut out Tokyo sky tree and move to another day if needed).  Appreciate the read and feedback!\n\nMonday: Arrival Day (around 2 pm) - Haneda\n\nTuesday: Shibuya/Harajuku/Yoyogi Park/Meiji Shrine\n\nWednesday: Odawara Castle Tour 11 am (travel by Shinkansen) - day trip\n\nThursday: Tsukiji Fish Market Tour/TeamLab Planets Tokyo/Tokyo Sky Tree\n\nFriday: Akihabara - anime, electronics and gachapon etc - free style mostly / Imperial Place and Hie Shrine fly by on the way back \n\nSaturday:\nHang in shibuya/Harajuku until need to leave for Haneda airport ~8pm\n\nUpdate/Edit: Suica card for rail travel seems like the move for this short of a stay.",

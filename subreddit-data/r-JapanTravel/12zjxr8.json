    "postText": "**Edit: Forgot to add in my title that there is also a day trip to Himeji after Osaka**\n\nHi all,\n\nI've been fairly active on here in the last few weeks building &amp; editing my own itinerary. I am now just over a week away from my trip and ready for any last pieces of advice or last minute suggestions for things to switch out or change up.\n\nI'm 33, male, solo travelling, from the UK, first time in Japan and don't speak Japanese. I will be doing a 1.5 bagging trip (i.e. just a carry on backpack and a small sling backpack for the days). Trying to travel as minimalist as I find comfortable so moving around will be easier.\n\nThere is a switch up of hotel in Tokyo which although not ideal, I've already come to terms with as being the best option price-wise and considering that I want to experience the hotel I've picked.\n\nI will be getting the following transport passes:\n\n* 7 day JR Pass to activate on day 7\n* Hakone Free Pass (which will also be used as the base fare to go with my already reserved observation seat on the Romancecar\n* Inner city transport will be using a SUICA card which I will buy when I land\n* Narita Express ticket for my Narita Airport - Shibuya journey and the Keisei Skyliner ticket for my Ueno - Narita Airport journey\n\nI also already have a 16 day Mobal SIM card for Japan ready to put in my phone\n\nReady for any last pieces of advice or help.Can people help with the order of anything that seems illogical? I'm not too proud to majorly change anything - I'd rather use my time effectively.

Tickets go on sale at a specific time so I was literally up at like 2am on the dot to buy. Luckily [their website](https://www.e-tix.jp/ticket_giants/en/ticket_pc_en.html) has an English section and is really intuitive. Just looking it, it seems that the majority of the June games are already up for sale so you may want to check it out. Just be aware that there are two main teams in Tokyo (Giants and Swallows). Both play at different stadiums, That website is for the Yomiuri Giants. I wanted to see the Giants to catch a game at the Tokyo Dome which is where they play.",

How are you getting from the romance train to the hotel?\n\nI\u2019m taking a Shinkansen from Tokyo to Hakone, so I\u2019ll be dropped off in Odawara, but was thinking of taking the Hakone -Tozan train to the hotel in Gora to drop off my bags, then, doing the ropeway to Togendai, then the pirate ship cruise on Lake Aishi , Then, looking at the torii gate and shrine, then, back on the pirate ship to Togendai, then the ropeway back to Gora to get back to the hotel.\n\nIs that similar to what you\u2019re doing?",

The rest of the loop sounds practically identical to yours except I'm not doing the return trip on the boat and instead I'm just going to do some more walking after the shrine before getting the Tozan bus back to Gora.",

Google Maps shows it as about a 45 minute walk from the Hakone/Lake Ashi shrine.  Is there a bus you plan to catch?  If so, what bus, and from what stop?\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI know it's a bit last minute but would really love an itinerary check. I\u2019m going with my boyfriend, we can both walk quite a bit (avg 15k steps per day without trying). I've been to only Tokyo twice, this will be his first time in Japan. We both like anime (he&gt;me) and food (me&gt;him), so that will be our main focus. His absolute requirement is to visit all 3 of the life sized Gundams, and my absolute requirement is to do food souvenir shopping in Tokyo Station. We already made a few reservations, and I looked up train/walking times and routes while making this itinerary so I did budget some travel time in between each stop. I also budgeted some wait time for a few popular restaurants. I have a tendency to pack too much in when I'm on vacation because I want to make the most of my time, but now I worry I may have overdone it.

            "comment": "You're definitely packing a lot in, but it doesn't seem unreasonable. Some days seem busier than others which seems fine because it will give you time to recover on the \"slow\" days. My wife and I prefer to walk around cities when we travel and in Japan we can easily hit 20-25k steps, so it's good you're ready to do some walking! \n\nYou've probably read or been told that Arashiyama &amp; Fushimi Inari will be packed. If it matters to you to see them with less people, shoot for getting there 6-7am if you can. \n\nLike you said, it's good to have time for the wait and or be prepared to go somewhere else. So maybe for the places you don't have reservations don't be afraid to eat in a different place. Or stop and get snacks on the way. \n\nI guess if I was trying to nitpick your plan, the days from 6/5 - 6/8 sound kind of rushed and hectic. Could you go straight from Shinjuku to Fukuoka? Then have the consecutive time in Osaka instead of what looks like a layover there and back?",

We originally thought the Fukuoka Gundam Base could be a day trip while we were staying in Osaka, then we realized too late that the nighttime Gundam shows my bf wants to watch end too late and we won\u2019t be able to catch the last Shinkansen back. So we decided to stay a night in Fukuoka. Unfortunately when we booked our Osaka hotel, it was a non refundable booking, so we do have to arrive there on the first day to check in. This means we will unfortunately waste a night of hotel in Osaka, but it\u2019s worth it for my bf to see the Gundam.",

            "comment": "Well, I am your person, I went to all 3 gundam locations in my previous trip (2 weeks ago)\n\n- Day 3: My tips, if you like model kit. try surugaya in akihabara, it is one of many surugaya specialty stores in akiba. It is on the 2nd floor and has many cheap non bandai kit. Also check out bic camera, they usually have 10% discount on model kit. Tbh ignore mandarake akihabara, it was swept clean. Better to try your luck in nakano broadway\n\n- Day 5, I absolutely recommend the decks, I think that is the one you said about retro japanese arcade (I stumbled upon it during my last visit). It was on 4th floor?i kinda forgot, it was a fun place, many shops selling 90s snack. There was trick eye camera museum and haunted house too. Also they have this lucky boxes thingy that I always see on youtube (didn't try it, I don't want to waste money on it).\n\n**If you wanna check what is available on each gundam base, you can check it here: https://www.gundam-base.net/products/index.php?paging=1&amp;order_form=&amp;chara=&amp;brand=&amp;order=&amp;freeword=\n\n\n- On day 6, tbh you can exchange your jr pass when you land. Just go to the counter and tell them you want to activate it on x date, then keep the jr pass somewhere safe. \n\nI suggest to activate it on day 10 so you can use it until day 16. Don't forget that you can use jr pass for the narita express (for day 16). But you need to book them as it is reservation only.\n\nDay 8: you can put in ameyokocho here, it is like 11 minutes from tokyo station\n\nDay 9: 4 hours in gundam factory yokohama is too much lol, you probably will only stay around 2-3 hours max. It will gonna costs you 1650 yen if you want to enter (the shop is inside of it). After looking at the rx78, you can enter to their side building that serve as museum and show. It showed robot assembling rx78 (albeit very simple), don't miss it. And I think the gund-arm open cafe still there? Buy drink and get witch of the mercury coaster\n\nDay 10: kuromon market in the afternoon? I went there in the afternoon during my 2017 trip, and everything closed except few (and those few only have leftover that they didn't sell in the morning)\n\n\nDay 12: canal city is name of mall where gundam base fukuoka located, it hosted ramen stadium where some famous ramen shops located. \n\nTo reach lalaport, you need to use bus (if I am not wrong, 15 mins from canal city)\n\nDay 16 will be very rough going from kyoto to tokyo to narita lol, good luck",

Good advice about Ameyokocho, I will move that too. I did budget a bit extra time at the Gundam factory since we\u2019re also planning on taking a breather at the Gundam cafe &amp; want to go up on the observatory deck too, but good to know if we end up running a bit behind with the earlier activities that it won\u2019t cut into our time at the Gundam base. \n\nI thought about exchanging the JR pass at the airport but decided against it, because we just want to get to our hotel asap cos we want to have our basement food hall dinner before Takashimaya closes lol. That\u2019s why we picked another slow morning on day 6 to exchange our JR pass and reserve seats. The only concern I have with doing it on this day is that it may be a bit too close to when we\u2019re due to activate and use the pass? Do you think there will be enough seats left for us to reserve by then? Also I totally get the concern going from Kyoto to Narita. We\u2019re prepared for the worst and will leave extra early (maybe even moving out at 8am) to make sure we get there on time.",

If you wanna try it.\n\nTbh, for the jr pass, it doesn't take any of your time to exchange the jr pass. It is right next to machine where you need to buy narita express anyway (now the jr pass exchange booth is in one with ticket office. It used to be two separate offices). So just go to the ticket office, exchange your jr pass while buying narita express ticket. Just remember to put the right date.\n\nDon't forget to buy suica, it is near there.\n\nIf you buy your ticket from jr website, you can actually book your seats online ahead of time. I haven't used it but that will solve your problem if it is about booking. I don't think you will have trouble booking your seats during the time of your trip, it is not close to any major holiday (I might be wrong though).\n\nIf you really need it and can't get reserved seats (for example on the last day to tokyo, either no seats or you missed your train). you can try open seats, you might not get any seats, but you can stand.\n\n*Surugaya can be found in many places through out japan. But make sure to check if it is for model kit. I went one that actually about boys love (2 males loving each other), the shop cleck absolutely shocked when she saw a male going into a boys love specialty shop lol. Same with akihabara, they have like 4 surugaya and they all offer different specialties.\n\n** I also recommend Joshin super kids land if you wanna hunt model kit in osaka. If I am not wrong, they offer bigger discount on model kit than bic camera",

It's not that the food is bad, it's just that they're not usually that much better than their peers, if at all.  \nFor good wagyu I can recommend Ichigyu in Osaka (8-10k yen for 2) and Yamadaruma in Kyoto (even better, slightly cheaper).   \nIf you are in Tsukiji I recommend going to the fish port market building next to the market where the toilets are. There's a shop called takashin suisan selling the best otoro I tasted in both my trips including Michelin starred restaurants. Rough around the edges for sure but high quality otoro.",

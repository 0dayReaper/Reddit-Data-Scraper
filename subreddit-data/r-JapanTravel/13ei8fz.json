    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI'm going to Japan next week to go to USJ before the Jujutsu Kaisen ride is gone, but it just so happens that I'll be in Tokyo during the Sanja Matsuri as well. Coincidentally I found out that Design Festa is also going on the same weekend (about 1 hr away) and there's an artist I want to see.\n\n**So my question is:**\n\n* Do I need to allot three full days for Sanja Matsuri, or is it more of a half a day thing?\n* If you have to choose between day 2 and day 3 to sit (stand) through the whole thing, which would you choose?\n* If I want to see the Kagura dance, where do I do that? I saw the schedule but not the place, is everything happening at the Asakusa Shrine?\n* Do you recommend seeing the Sanja Matsuri from Asakusa Shrine or Kaminarimon? I heard the crowd is super bad at the Kaminarimon  \n\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I will be visiting Japan for the first time this November. You might be wondering why I didn\u2019t chose to go to Tokyo/Osaka in my first trip is just because I want to reserve that when I visit again next year with family and friends. \n\nMy focus on this trip is food, koya watching, coffee/matcha (I love going to cafes), and scenic views (I love taking photos of landscapes). I\u2019m also the type of person who likes to take things slow and just chill. As much as possible, I also don\u2019t like changing hotels everyday. \n\nTrip duration: 13 days\n\nDates: Mid to late November \n\nLocations to visit: Fukuoka, Yufu, Kurokawa, &amp; Nagasaki\n\nMode of transportation: Public transportation \n\n\n\n\nItinerary breakdown:\n\nDay 0: \n- Arrival to Fukuoka airport at around 7:30pm \n- Hotel check in\n- Will just have dinner somewhere near my hotel\n\nDay 1:\n- Nomiyama Kannonji Temple \ud83c\udf41 (will take taxi/uber from sasaguri station)\n- Nanzoin temple\n- Canal City\n- Hakata port tower \n- back to hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 2:\n- Raizansennyoji Taihioin \ud83c\udf41\n- i don\u2019t know if I should explore itoshima or just go back to Fukuoka. Looking at google maps, Itoshima is better to be explored by car and i can\u2019t drive.\n- back to Fukuoka and back to hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 3:\n- go to Yufuin\n- explore the city\n- stay the night \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 4:\n- explore Yufuin in the morning\n- Go to Kurokawa onsen by midday\n- explore the area\n- stay at a ryokan \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 5: \n- continue exploring Kurokawa onsen until last bus\n- Travel to Nagasaki\n- Check in hotel at Nagasaki \ud83d\udecc\n- if there\u2019s time, go to Mt inasa observatory (not sure if this is possible though?)\n\nDay 6:\n- Atomic Bomb Museum\n- Peace Park\n- Suwa shrine\n- Nagasaki Museum of History and Culture\n- Meganebashi Bridge\n- back to hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 7:\n- day trip to Shimabara\n- Yuusui-Teien Shimeiso\n- visit the shiba inus\n- Shimabara castle\n- Samirai Residence\n- Omisaki Station \n- back to hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 8:\n- Dejima\n- Glover Garden\n- Oura Church\n- Ouratenbo park\n- Leave Nagasaki and go to fukuoka\n- Fukuoka hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 9:\n- Day trip to Dazaifu\n- visit the areas with Koya first\n- explore area and food trip\n- Kyushu National Museum\n- back to hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 10:\n- Fukuoka castle ruins\n- Ohori park\n- Maizuru Park\n- Miyajidake Shrine (for sunset)\n- explore tenjin area\n- back to hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 11:\n- Akizuki Castle Ruins (will take a taxi from the nearest public transport)\n- Ukiha Inari Shrine \n- Kourataisha for night viewing \n- Honestly don\u2019t know if visiting these will be possible. Not sure if it\u2019s worth it so I might skip the other two if traveling there would be too time consuming \n- back to hotel \ud83d\udecc\n\nDay 12:\n- Yusentei park\n- Buy last minute souvenirs\n- visit places that were skipped (if there\u2019s one)\n- Go to airport \ud83d\udeeb\n\n\nQuestions:\n- Some of the places that I want to visit is not accessible via public transportation. So I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s easy to grab a taxi or book an uber to go to the places mentioned above? Also which among those is worth it to visit?\n- I have the largest size luggage and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s better to use lockers in Fukuoka to store the luggage or just have it shipped.\n- what\u2019s your mode of payment for transportation? I\u2019ve been seeing suica but can I use that to any transportation? \n- where  can I buy sim cards for tourists? I know I can get it at the airport but I\u2019m worried that It might be closed when I arrive. \n- any other places that is worth it to visit for koya watching?\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "Firstly, thank you for choosing Kyushu for your first trip to Japan. It's one of my favourite places and doesn't get the level of attention from tourists it deserves. I flew in to Fukuoka on my first trip too!\n\nYou can use Hayakaken (Fukuoka Airport Suica equivalent) for most of your transport needs, but since you'll be spending a decent chunk of time in Nagasaki you may want to look into getting a day pass for trams. There should be a flat fee of 120 yen per trip, so if you think you'll be taking more than four tram trips in a day, get the pass. I always paid for taxis in cash; drivers in Japan are pretty old school, they seem to prefer it.\n\nIf you're worried about sim cards, you can always buy one before you arrive and have your card sent to your hotel so that it's waiting for you at check-in. I used Sakura Mobile for this but you can hunt around and find the card that suits your needs best.\n\nSeeing Nagasaki in two days is a smart idea: I tried to fit in your itinerary in one day and had to cut out the Peace Museum due to lack of time (I was heading to Hiroshima the next day so I figured visiting the statue alone was enough.) Be warned that Dejima+Chinatown and Glover Gardens can eat up a lot of your time if you're not careful! \n\nSince you're visiting Kyushu and appear to have an interest in historical sites based on your itinerary, I feel compelled to ask: have you considered visiting either Kumamoto or Kagoshima for a daytrip? Both are easily accessible from Hakata station via Shinkansen. Kumamoto has one of Japan's best historic castles while Kagoshima has Sengan-en (garden and historic estate) and a number of attractions pertaining to the Bakumatsu era. I would recommend both if you're able.",

                    "comment": "Thank you! Will check first if I need a day pass for trams in Nagasaki. I never considered it cause I totally forgot about that.\n\nAs for the taxis, I don\u2019t really like cash too much because it\u2019s a hassle to bring so I\u2019m wondering if ubers are better as a mode of transportation? Is it pricier than taxis? I\u2019m also wondering how can I call taxis from areas that don\u2019t really have taxis?\n\nThank you for the warning regarding spending too much time in Dejima/Chinatown and Glover Garden. I\u2019m planning to stay around Chinatown so I can explore it at night for at least 2 nights. I feel like I might spend too much time on Glover Garden though cause I\u2019m a sucker for beautiful places haha.\n\nI didn\u2019t think about buying a sim card beforehand so I really want to thank you again for that. I didn\u2019t think it was possible.\n\nAs for Kumamoto and Kagoshima, I really want to visit those places as well but It might feel a little too rushed to my liking. I\u2019m the type of person who prefers staying at a places for more than a night unless it\u2019s enough for a day trip.",

                            "comment": "Just as a general comment: Japan isn't as cash-dependent a society as it once was (You can use Suica or equivalent for many purchases outside of transport) however it still is so relative to a lot of Western countries. For that reason, it still is a good idea to carry some cash with you, even if it's just 10-15k yen for emergencies.\n\nI can't speak for Uber or other ride-shares, as I used car travel sparingly and mainly walked or used PT. I *can* speak for the reliability of Kyushu's taxis though: when I went to Reigando from Kumamoto station, the driver offered to wait for me there for no extra charge. The reason? He was a massive Musashi fan, so as soon as I asked him to head to Reigando he knew exactly why I was going and was delighted to take me. If you're worried about needing to make a return trip, feel free to ask your driver for advice as to whether he'd be willing to wait or where the taxi ranks are in that area.\n\nGlover Gardens are absolutely stunning and definitely worth getting lost in for a few hours, don't get me wrong! Just be mindful of that possibility if you have other plans that day. If you have 3 hours left and are wanting to see both Glover and Oura, go visit Oura first!\n\nI hear what you're saying about daytrips. I'll be honest and say that Kumamoto can definitely be done in a day, but that Kagoshima is large enough that you probably will feel a bit rushed. However, Sengan-en is a fantastic counter-point to Glover: the latter is a Victorian garden with Japanese influences, while the former is the reverse. It would be a shame to go to Kyushu and miss out on visiting it entirely if garden complexes are something you're into. \n\nMy advice would be to treat a hypothetical Kagoshima daytrip as a Sengan-en daytrip specifically. Take a taxi from the station, focus on that immediate area and tell yourself that if you get to see anything in the city centre then that's just an added bonus.",

            "comment": "Question 1: Are taxis and Uber available in Fukuoka?\r  \nAbsolutely! Fukuoka offers both taxi services and Uber for your convenience. However, it's worth noting that they can be a bit pricey. So, if you're on a tight budget, I recommend exploring the city using its excellent public transportation system. But if you're short on time or prefer the luxury of a private car, taxis, and Uber are reliable options.\r  \n\r  \nQuestion 2: What places are worth visiting in Fukuoka that are not accessible by public transportation?\r  \nAh, I'm glad you asked! Fukuoka boasts some fantastic attractions that aren't easily reached by public transport. Here are a few must-visit spots:\r  \n\r  \nNanzoin Temple: Prepare to be awe-struck by the giant reclining Buddha here. It's a truly mesmerizing sight and one of Fukuoka's top tourist attractions.\r  \n\r  \nDazaifu Tenmangu Shrine: Dedicated to the god of learning, this shrine holds immense cultural significance. It's a popular pilgrimage site for students seeking blessings for their studies.\r  \n\r  \nHakata Gion Yamakasa Festival: This vibrant festival held every July celebrates tradition and showcases stunning floats and lively music. It's a real feast for the senses!\r  \n\r  \nYatai: Don't miss indulging in delicious street food at Fukuoka's iconic mobile food stalls. These Yatai are beloved by locals and tourists alike and offer a taste of authentic Japanese flavors.\r  \n\r  \nUminonakamichi Park: If you crave picturesque coastal views, head to this stunning park. You'll be treated to breathtaking ocean vistas, creating the perfect backdrop for a relaxing day.\r  \n\r  \nOhori Park: Located right in the heart of Fukuoka, this urban oasis is a haven of tranquility. Enjoy a stroll around the beautiful lake or simply unwind amidst the lush greenery.\r  \n\r  \nShofukuji Temple: Immerse yourself in history at one of Fukuoka's oldest temples. This serene sanctuary is a particular spot for Buddhist pilgrims and offers a glimpse into the city's spiritual heritage.\r  \n\r  \nMomochi Seaside Park: This park is a true gem combining captivating ocean views with a stunning city skyline. Take a moment to breathe in the fresh sea air and soak up the natural beauty.\r  \n\r  \nCanal City Hakata: Shopaholics, rejoice! This vibrant shopping mall is a paradise for retail therapy, dining, and entertainment. It's the perfect place to unwind and indulge in some leisurely exploration.\r  \n\r  \nFukuoka Castle Ruins: For history buffs, visiting these ruins is a must. Step back in time and marvel at the remnants of Fukuoka's storied past.\r  \n\r  \nQuestion 3: How can I store my luggage in Fukuoka?\r  \nWhen it comes to storing your luggage, Hakata Station has got you covered. They offer convenient lockers that are accessible 24/7, providing a secure and hassle-free solution. Plus, they won't break the bank, making it an ideal choice for budget-conscious travelers. Feel free to explore Fukuoka without the burden of carrying your bags around!\r  \n\r  \nQuestion 4: What is the mode of payment for transportation in Fukuoka?\r  \nIn Fukuoka, the most common mode of payment for transportation is the Suica card. This nifty little card can be used on trains, buses, and streetcars, making getting around the city a breeze. You can easily purchase a Suica card at any central train station, and it offers a convenient tap-and-go system for seamless travel throughout Fukuoka.\r  \n\r  \nQuestion 5: Can I get a tourist sim card in Fukuoka?\r  \nAbsolutely! You can find tourist sim cards at most major electronics stores in Fukuoka. These sim cards are tailored specifically for tourists and provide the essential data and voice calls you need to stay connected during your adventures in Japan. There are options available on convenience stores, but I believe they are for data only!\n\nI cannot tell you a lot about Fukuoka because it is a place I have never been to yet, but as a foreigner that has lived in Japan for 20+ years, I can help you with your doubts!",

It will let you ride all the Shinkansen and other JR trains for 7 days and I believe the cost is 20,000 JPY (around $150 based on today\u2019s exchange rate). It\u2019s a really good deal and you will make your money back in a few trips (e.g. trains between Nagasaki and Fukuoka).\n\nThe JR pass also makes it easy to add day trips to Kumamoto and Kagoshima since the Kyushu Shinkansen makes it very easy to get to those cities.",

There is a tourist version of the Sugoca card, the page have a link to JR Kyushu coverage https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/sugomon_pass/ if both stations are not in, you will have to get a paper ticket paid cash. JR Kyushu pass is also an option. Local bus might accept IC card, but is not, cash, so check how to ride bus before, like how to understand fare table and always have spare change and 1000 yen notes. You need to put exact fare in the fare box but can break coins and 1000 notes in smaller change.\n\nSIM card you can check to get one that will be shipped to your hotel or at home before you travel.

We've had better luck with it. Otherwise plentiful on arterial roads.\n\nRe: tickets: IC cards function in every station I've passed through, incliding 60yr old trams in Hiroshima (board in the middle, exit forward). There is also a Kyushu rail pass that sounds well suited for your plans - see the JR Pass counter in the JR ticket office, Hakata station. \n\nRe: Lockers: Hakata has some large lockers. One locker bank is quite obvious in the main lobby, but if that's full look for the passage to \"Hankyu\" (shop plaza), and you will not only find two more banks, but also a poorly labeled room through a glass door with many more lockers.\n\nRe: Mt Inasayama observatory: the ropeway station is a 6min/1000\u00a5 ride from the Station, so very accessible. Taking a taxi to the top (or down) is an option, (but requires going around the north side ridge of the mountain). The gondola view is nice, too (and is probably cheaper than taking a cab all the way around). It was beautiful at night; would recommend going just before sunset so you can get day and evening views.\n\nThe Port Tower and museum is not particularly impressive, and im a boat guy. It's also not on a subway line, but is on bus. I'd recommend that time for Hakatamachiya Furusatokan, where they demonstrate the traditional manufacture of Hakataori silk fabric twice/day.\n\nRe: SIM card: we rented a wifi Hotspot, and it has worked well. Has the benefit that I can get text-over-IP and VOIP services (a feature of my carrier) at my existing number, rather than passing a new number to family and critical coworkers.",

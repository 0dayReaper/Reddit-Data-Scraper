    "postText": "Hi Japan lovers :)\n\nWe're a couple (gay if relevant) in our mid-30s visiting Japan for the first time next fall. We've been waiting for this trip for around 3 years !!\n\nOn holidays we like to visit castles and temples, hike and discover nature, meet with local people (hopefully the hours spent on duolingo will be useful), cook and taste new food... Also we're quite geeky : we can't be in japan and miss important anime or video games exhibitions !\n\nAs an archer, I'd like to try kyudo, but finding places fit for non japanese-fluent seems difficult.\n\nHere's the itinerary we thought of (nothing is booked but the flights in/out), do you have any recommendations about places to go, tips for accomodation, things to do, cities in which to spend less/more time... ?\n\n**22/09-28/09 (6 nights) : Tokyo**\n\n* Ghibli Museum\n* parc Ueno\n* national day ?\n* sights : sky street buildng / tokyo tower / metropolitan\n* asaksa : temples\n\n**28/09-29/09 (1 night) : Matsumoto**\n\n* Castle\n\n**29/09-05/10 (6 nights) : Kyoto**\n\n* fushiminari\n* Gold Temple / Silver Temple\n* Nijojo castle\n* yasakajinja --&gt; temple kyomisu\n* Nara\n* Osaka\n* Kobe\n\n**05/10-06/10 (1 night) : Hiroshima**\n\n* Miyajima\n* peace park\n\n**06/10-07/10 (1 night) : Gifu**\n\n**07/10-08/10 (1 night) : Shirakawa-Go**\n\n**08/10-14/10 (6 nights) : Takayama**\n\n* Matsuri\n* onsen (Gero)\n* temples\n* sports day ?\n\n**14/10-15/10 (1 night) : Hakone**\n\n**15/10-17/10 (2 nights) : Tokyo**",

The other most common trip people do from Takayama is Kamikochi, which is a bus there and back. The city of Takayama you can do in one day - don\u2019t miss the Showa Museum for 20th century nerdiness!\n\nBut I would maybe add on another two days in Hakone as it\u2019s beautiful in the autumn, plus it\u2019s a long way from Takayama, and you don\u2019t want to check in late and leave the next morning. Hakone has lots of interesting towns and depending on where you stay, it\u2019s great for walks, there\u2019s some excellent Mt. Fuji views (if you\u2019re lucky with weather) and I found it\u2019s somewhere you just want to unwind with nature or get dangerously hot in an onsen.",

Unless you want to visit many other places around Nagano, I would advise against it because you will lose a lot of time commuting. But I would second the opinion of Himeji Castle. The city is bigger; public transportations are plenty, even on the smaller Sanyo railway.",

            "comment": "Firstly, Takayama is a fairly small place. You can comfortably see most of it in a day, and if you really wanted to do so at a leisurely pace, you could stay overnight. Two nights is approaching overkill, let alone six. I would strongly recommend redistributing time away from Takayama to Osaka and Kanazawa.\n\nSince you're into history/culture, Kanazawa should be a top destination on your list; it's second to Kyoto in terms of historical/cultural appeal with many great historical sites to explore. It's also in roughly the same part of the country as Takayama, but it's much more accessible. When I did my daytrip to Takayama, I stayed in Kanazawa. \n\nYou can theoretically do Nagano and Matsumoto in a day, (I did, traveling from Kanazawa en route to Tokyo) but I'm going to assume that you'd want to see both Matsumoto Castle and Zenkou-ji, which might be a tight-run thing. Consider staying in Nagano rather than Matsumoto as it's more accessible, unless you have a specific place in Matsumoto you'd like to stay at.\n\nKyoto is one of my favourite cities in the world, and given your interests it's likely going to be a highlight of your trip too. Bear in mind though that a lot of temples will stop accepting visitors around 4-4:30 so you will likely have to stagger your visits across multiple days in order to make time to see everything you want. Taking multiple daytrips from Kyoto is therefore unwise given that if you can stay in Osaka and take those same daytrips from there instead. That's why I'd strongly urge you to redistribute some of those six Takayama nights to Osaka, and then see Nara,  Kobe and Himeji from Osaka instead. **You absolutely must visit Himeji if you want to see castles**, Himeji has the best historical castle in Japan!\n\nHiroshima can also be done as a hassle-free day-trip from Osaka, although staying overnight on Miyajima can be a fun experience. \n\nOn Gifu: Normally I would recommend doing Gifu as a day-trip as well, but I am going to assume you two are planning on hiking your way up to the castle. If you feel that you'd like to spend a night there to rest up before/after your hike then by all means, but do be advised that you can comfortably see Gifu in a day without staying overnight. \n\nFinally, since you are spending time in Tokyo, I'd recommend taking a daytrip to Kamakura, Nikko or both. Kamakura is another rival to Kyoto in terms of historicity (Unlike Kanazawa, it *was* the capital of Japan for a time.) and has some lovely temples and shrines along with a beachy seaside resort vibe. It's about an hour out from Tokyo. Nikko meanwhile has some stunning shrines and temples and a national park if you'd like to do a bit of extra hiking.",

Because Nagano has Shinkansen access and is a larger city than Matsumoto (and therefore likely to have more accommodation options) I would recommend seeing Matsumoto from Nagano rather than vice versa.\n\nIf you are planning on travelling directly from Matsumoto to Takayama, bear in mind that would likely involve taking a number of buses; miss one and your screwed. Travelling from Nagano to Takayama however means taking a Shinkansen to Toyama, and then a local train to Takayama, which is much more straightforward.",

I realize it\u2019s so difficult without knowing us but logistically speaking, could that make sense - given the amount of train travel between Nagano and Matsumoto??

Make sure that you are on time or you will not be let in even with the ticket. You can stay as long as you want.\n\nAll the temples and shrines in Kyoto are amazing! Sense you like that kind of stuff get a shrine book and have your book stamped at all of the different shrine/temples that you go to. A book is usually about \u00a51500 which includes the first stamp at the shrine /temple that you get it from. The stamps cost anywhere from \u00a5200-\u00a5500 depending on the shrine /temple. And then you have an awesome keepsake at the end of your trip. You can get it stamped at any shrine /temple that offers stamps thru out the country. \n\nOsaka go to the aquarium! It's by far the coolest aquarium! It is five stories tall and has whale sharks! The castle is totally modern inside but they have some really cool displays so still worth going to and there is a shrine across the street that you can visit after.\n\nThere is a museum at the Peace Park and it's really good. You can rent audio tours for \u00a5300 it is worth it. \n\nEnjoy your trip!",

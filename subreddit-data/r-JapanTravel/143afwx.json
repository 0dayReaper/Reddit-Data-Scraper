Near Kitano Tenmangu Shrine is a hanamachi called Kamishichiken, where geiko and maiko can be seen watching the festival. If you are interested in the festival, it is recommended to visit.\r  \nFor more information on the festivities, read this page (https://kyototravel.info/zuikimatsuri) using your browser's translator function.",

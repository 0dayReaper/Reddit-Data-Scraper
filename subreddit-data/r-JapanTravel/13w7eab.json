    "postText": "I went to USJ a week or so ago on a Saturday and wanted to share some tips I got from my Japanese friend who goes frequently.\n\n**If you arrive before the official park opening time, you can almost always get entry into Nintendo World or Harry Potter Land without a timed entry or express pass if you beeline it to your preferred area after entry.**\n\nWe got to the park bright and early on Saturday morning around... 07:20? There were already hundreds of people lined up. We'd already had our tickets purchased and the QRs ready to go (I bought on Klook and used my American credit card). We were able to skip the queue to buy tickets because of that, and went on to the next queue. Many people were sitting on the ground or eating onigiri, so we did too. They opened the gates early for people who were with a tour group or something first, then for everyone else. Hundreds of people literally sprinting or running to Mario Land. You didn't need to, though. We walked briskly and got in just fine and got onto the Yoshi ride with ZERO MINUTE wait time, then got on it a second time with almost no wait either! When we walked by the Mario Kart ride to get there, it was only a 20 minute wait.\n\nYou're probably only going to get Harry Potter or Mario, not both. We had timed entry for Harry later in the day, so we we still able to do both after all.\n\nHere's the next big tip: **If you tell the ride attendant you want to ride as a \"Single Rider\" (\"Shingaru Raidaa\") they will let you into another lane that is essentially the express lane.**\n\nWhen we were passing the Mario Kart ride, I told my friend we should get in that line now while it's so low. He replied, \"NO I WANT YOSHI\" so we did Yoshi. When we got back to the Mario Kart ride, it had jumped to a 75 minute wait. My friend told the attendant we were single riders and got put into a line in between the regular line and the express line and we passed SO MANY PEOPLE. I think we waited maybe 15 minutes before getting on the ride. The catch is that you will probably not sit with your group members when you go in the single rider lane, but jeez I didn't care too much about that. I'd rather do more rides and not wait in line!\n\nWe also did this with the Spider-Man ride, which is apparently to get wrecked out fairly soon, so ride it while you can! It's awesome and way more thrilling than it has any right to be! We waited maybe five minutes. I think we were put in the actual express lane. It took us longer to walk through the maze of rails that actually wait in line, AND the attendant sat us together on the car anyway!\n\nFinal tip: **Line up for Chef Toad's Cafe (Kinopio's Cafe) by 10:30 to eat a a reasonable lunch time.**\n\nIf you go early like we did, you'll get hungry early. And we wanted that sweet Mario-themed lunch. We waited longer for the cafe line than any other line. It was the better part of an hour, if not more. I got the carbonara which was delicious, but so rich. I was loathe to get a burger in Japan as an American, but in this case, that's what I'd recommend. My friend's burger was quite good. My other friend got the fire flower spaghetti, but we agreed my carbonara was better. It was still good though. We all split the pizza dip and it was pretty good and cute. I wish I went ahead and tried the mushroom soup, but I passed. As far as desserts go, we got the ? Block and the Goal Pole Cake. The Goal Pole Cake blew the ? Block Tiramisu out of the water on taste! The ? Block was very cute and novel, but the taste was meh. We should've gotten the Princess Peach cake to split, or the double chocolate cupcake. However, we were still very satisfied with our Chef Toad experience. The interior is very fun!\n\nWell, that's all I got. I hope it will be helpful to anyone who plans on going.\n\nEdit: Some people have pointed out that you don't need timed entry to get into Harry Potter. My friend took care of that one, so I just assumed. Sorry about that. Some people have also recommended downloading the USJ app to get your timed entry to Nintendo World. I saw conflicting info online about being able to pick which time you can enter when you buy on Klook, so we just went early. It worked out better for us as we were able to enjoy Mario Land before it got crazy busy.\n\nThe main take away from this post might be that you can tell the attendant you're a single rider to (more or less) get the benefits of the express pass without paying for it if you're on a tighter budget.",

The normal queue lines are about 80 minutes.  \n\nFor Mario ride, the normal queue was 135 minutes and require reservation entry (which included in the express pass). It took about 15 mins for us to enter.  \n\nFor Spy X Family cafe, do make reservation beforehand. If you do not have a Japanese number,  just tell them your name,  the queue number you got and what time you need to come back. The moment it was our timing,  we immediately ushered to our seat.\n\nFor the Spy X Family show, do get the brochure early as it is first come first serve basis.",

This site works well with google translate if you don't know Japanese: https://usjinfo.com/wait/pre_callendar.php\n\nIn my experience, if its around a 20 then it'll still be crowded (USJ is *always* crowded) but wait times will be around 1 hour max and you can ride all the big rides without an express pass. I still recommend arriving at least 1 hour early to line up, ideally 2 hours early because sometimes the parks open early.\n\nAnything above 30 and I'd probably consider an express pass.",

You need to be there around 7:30 or earlier to get the ticket. \n\nI think you need about 4 - 5 hours to enjoy all the contents in the Mario area and I recommend you to enter by 15:00. \n\nActually, when you arrive at USJ around 11:00 A.M. on weekdays, you are still able to get the timed entry ticket for the Mario area but you are allowed to enter it around 19:00 - 20:30, which is too late. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to get this timed entry ticket. Download the official USJ app and register your ticket(QR code) on the app then you can apply for the ticket. \n\nIn summary; \n1. Buy one day pass in advance and be at USJ by 7:30 and wait. \n2. Download the official app and register your ticket. Get a timed entry ticket when you\u2019re physically in USJ(after you walk through the gate with your pass, you can get this timed entry ticket on the app).",

We went single rider for both and probably took about 10 minutes. For Jaws my husband and I got sat together anyway. \n\nImportant to note about the express pass is that it does not take you right to the front of the queue. For Mario kart it just took us to the part where you get the helmets and we still had to wait 20 minutes to actually get on the ride. It was much faster than the 135 minute standby queue but I wasn\u2019t expecting to have to wait 20 minutes with express. \n\nOur longest queue of the day was just to get into the damn park. We arrived at around 9am (I know everyone says to go early but our express passes didn\u2019t start until 1pm and our last rides weren\u2019t scheduled until 6:30pm) and it took about 45 minutes to get through the gate. There was soo many people there and it was awful in the heat. Second longest wait was the Toad restaurant. About 30 minutes to get a table and then another 15 for the food. Queues for the Pok\u00e9mon food, butter beer and three broomsticks (11am) were also notably long. \n\nI know the express pass is expensive but we came all the way from New Zealand and it was worth it for us to have guaranteed entry to Nintendo and to not spend hours of our precious time standing in queues. I don\u2019t think I would have enjoyed the park anywhere near as much without express. We get paid while we\u2019re on holiday and we worked out that we earned more than the cost of the express pass during the time we would have spent in queues that day.",

I didn\u2019t know this and about 7 weeks before our visit I looked online and nearly all the express passes during our 5 days in Osaka were gone. That\u2019s why we went on Sunday. It was the only day with passes available. We figured it was better to go on the weekend with an express pass then go during the week without one. Are you able to change your day? \n\nWe ended up with the Backdrop and Spider-Man pass. I didn\u2019t realise until we got to the park that backdrop is Hollywood dream backwards. I don\u2019t like big roller coasters so my husband went on backdrop and regular Hollywood dream twice each (using his and my pass) \n\nI don\u2019t know if they get more stock later on. \n\nWe booked on klook because our international credit cards didn\u2019t work on the USJ website. If you book on klook they automatically pick the times for your rides. This was why our express pass didn\u2019t start until 1pm and we didn\u2019t get to the HP rides until 6pm.

My whole trip is something like the 18th June to the 2nd July - so I'll look in that whole window on Klook and USJ - see if there's any one day that's free for express passes. Klook also seems cheaper than USJ in some circumstances as well!",

Arrived at 7:50 and they opened the park at 8:30 and went straight to Nintendo land without the timed entry as the park has not officially opened yet, managed to ride Mario kart twice (normal line and single rider), yoshi adventure and Harry Potter all before noon. Then after lunch was able to do some of the shorter queues like Spider-Man, Jaws and Jurassic park before doing Hollywood dream twice (normal and backdrop) and minions by then it was closing time.\n\nI think we saved a lot of time by eating mostly quick service meals and ate dinner once the park had closed in city walk. However I would still recommend it as I still tried a lot of the fun snacks like the Pikachu pizza bun, Mario pancakes, green shell yakisoba and various drinks.\n\nEdit: I also got a timed entry for Nintendo land at 4pm which we used to look around again and buy some merch before going back to the park for the final rides.",

But I do agree getting into Nintendo World asap is vital bc that place gets packed as hell. We had the choice of going at 9am or 10am and we picked 10am. Already at 10 Nintendo World had crazy lines. The popcorn bucket line was like an hour long. Then doing the power band stuff takes extra time with people waiting in front of you. If I could do it over again I would get Nintendo World out of the way first and then do everything else later.",

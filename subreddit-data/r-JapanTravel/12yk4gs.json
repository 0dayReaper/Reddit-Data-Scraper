So happy to see this on your plans, it\u2019s a beautiful place (especially the yuki no otani!) \n\nI\u2019d avoid the micropig cafe or any similar \u201cexotic\u201d animal cafe, if you have a look through other posts on this sub you\u2019ll see a fair bit of agreement that they\u2019re not the greatest in terms of animal welfare. AFAIK there are some cat cafes run by shelters that are more legit if you are looking for some kind of animal cafe experience. \n\nHakone is lovely (just did three nights there), I also did a day trip to Kamakura which was great too. I you\u2019re into exploring temples/shrines I would give it a look, Hasedera and Daibutsu are amazing sights IMO.",

I expect it is going to cause a lot of trouble in Hiroshima for regular tourists.\n\nI hope you have your Ghibli Museum Tickets already.\n\nPersonally, I can't imagine the snow monkey park being as interesting in May since it's not snowy then.  The monkeys don't exactly want to go in the onsen when it is warm and often need to be bribed to do so.\n\nI do really like Nagano though.  I've been multiple times.\n\nBTW you're not actually taking a shinkansen most of the way to Osaka.  From Toyama, the fastest way to Osaka by far is taking the shinkansen one station (or the Tsurugi shuttle shinkansen) to Kanazawa (about 20 minutes) and then taking a limited express to Osaka about 3 hours to Osaka Station, though there might be transfer time.  I guess you could also take a Limited Express Hida to Nagoya and then switch to a shinkansen, but there are only 4 Hidas a day and the trip is going to run you like 3.5 hours without even taking into account then catching a shinkansen in Nagoya.  The only way to do the trip almost entirely by shinkansen would be backtracking to Tokyo from Toyama and then taking the shinkansen from there to Shin-Osaka but that would take more like 5 hours just in train travel not including any transfer times and is the slowest method.\n\nGood luck!",

I would give the whole area a few days leeway on either side of the official conference to give time for setup up and letting things go back to normal.\n\nPerhaps you might want to switch it out with Nara?  Getting to Nara from Osaka is 100% doable and there is an early Hikari from Kyoto that goes directly to Hiroshima, I want to say it leaves around 8, but you would need to check.  I took it and made a 10:30 am train to Miyajima and was on Miyajima by 11:30, but I was just doing Miyajima and not trying to go to Hiroshima as well that trip.  (I was traveling with my then 6 year old.)\n\nI like Zenkoji in Nagano and I keep always meaning to go to Togakushi.\n\nI went to Matsumoto as a day trip from Nagano, there is one express train every hour or perhaps more often?\n\nBessho onsen I've heard is quite nice  and I liked the ruins of Ueda Castle, which is easy to visit on the same trip.  \n\nI enjoyed the ruins of Matsushiro Castle and Kawanakajima Battlefield Park, though I visited the latter during Autumn leaf viewing.  I don't know what it is like in May.\n\nI went to Shiga Kogen during February so it was snowy, but supposedly it is nice to hike when the snow is gone and there could still be some patchy snow as the back ski areas are much further up the mountains than the monkeys.  [https://www.shigakogen.gr.jp/english/green/trekking.html](https://www.shigakogen.gr.jp/english/green/trekking.html)\n\nI've not been but Karuizawa it has some nature and birding tours. \n\nI am specifically making sure everywhere I mention is within 1 hour of Nagano, since it makes it easier for the Alpine Route you have planned later in your trip.\n\nI've stayed at the Dormy in Nagano City and the Metropolitan.  The latter was much cheaper than I expected.  I stayed at Hotel Senjukaku near Jigokudani.  \n\nI hope this information helps and sorry about the bad news regarding Hiroshima!",

And I think going from Nagano to Toyama is better as there are way more people coming from Toyama to Nagano from what I saw.\n\nThe Klook tickets costs twice as much as when you buy directly from the website or along the route itself. \n\nMurodo is definitely where you want to be - there are a number of hiking routes suggested and it\u2019s worth doing at least 1 of them. Though Kurobe Dam and Midogihara are quite nice too. \n\nAlso I suggest to go as early as possible to avoid crowds - I think we reach Shin Omachi at around 7:30am and reached Murodo around 10:30am. \n\nLastly, you can consider luggage forwarding from Hotel A in Nagano to Hotel B Toyama so you won\u2019t be bringing a lot of things along the Alpine Route.",

            "comment": "A thought on the Hiroshima/Miyajima day: it\u2019s quite full for one day especially factoring in the fact that you\u2019ll be riding the Shinkansen to/from Hiroshima (roughly 90 minutes each way on the faster Sakura line). If you go to the peace park and ride transit to Miyajima, it\u2019ll take about an hour to get back to Hiroshima station, take a local train to Miyajimaguchi, and riding the JR ferry to the island. Add about the same amount of time to get back to Hiroshima so you can catch a Shinkansen back to Shin-Osaka and that\u2019s a lot of transit time for one day.\n\nOn the Himeji/Kobe day, you can definitely get back to Kobe by lunch but you\u2019d need to get there around when they open at 9 and generally move quickly. We did a guided tour (free English speaking tour guide volunteer) and while a little slower than we otherwise might\u2019ve gone through the castle, it really made it a special experience. I also recommend the gardens adjacent to the castle (Kokoen). Castle with tour took us 2 hours. Garden took another hour plus we had a nice lunch at the restaurant in the garden. Then you have to deal with the less frequent train schedules so you might not get a Shinkansen to Kobe exactly at the right time (roughly hourly departures, plus slower local train options) We got to Kobe around 2-3 and opted for dinner instead of lunch. If you do Kobe beef it\u2019ll be more expensive than lunch, but I think that\u2019s worth it to take a bit more time in Himeji.",

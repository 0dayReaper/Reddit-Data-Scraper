    "postText": "Heading to Japan with my girlfriend this summer for a 5 week study abroad program, will be in Kyoto for what I predict is going to be a busy, crowded tourist summer. We'll be keeping our weekends full with daytrips from Kyoto, but then I have 5 days/4 nights before my flight out on the 6th day from Osaka. I'd like to stay within Kansai, and find someplace quiet for some decompression. I'd also like to stay in the same place all 4 nights. Someplace to relax and do some journaling sounds nice. Don't have a car, needs to be reasonable accessible by train or bus. \n\nIdeas I've had so far:\n\n\n * Shirahama Beach - a resort at the ocean sounds nice but it will be peak season\n\n * Kinosaki Onsen - pleasant place but 4 nights would be too much, right?\n\n * Lake Biwa - there's smaller resorts on the west coast, but might be underwhelming. \n\n * Kumano Kodo - I'm a hiker but my girlfriend is less interested, plus that travel time to Hongu is intimidating. \n\n\nDoes one of these options sound like a good time? Is there somewhere else I should consider? Please let me know!",

Not recommended.\n\nKinosaki Onsen can be combined with Amanohashidate area (two nights each) if you just want a break.\n\nLake Biwa - resorts are on the southern end and Otsu will be busy, but there are enough day trips (Omi-Hachiman, Yasu, Mt.

Get an onsen ryokan or minshuku in Kii-Katsuura and do day trips to Nachi / Shingu / Hongu, so there is only light hiking. Eat lots of tuna, see Kushimoto or Kumanoshi (the Matsumoto Toge hike is great and not difficult at all). Everything fits within the length of the Ise-Kumano-Wakayama Area Tourist Pass.\n\n* Not Kansai but still JR West territory - consider Matsue on the sea of Japan coast? The city is worth a day or two, then there are some culturally interesting day trips (Izumo, Adachi Museum of Art, Yonago/Sakaiminato, Tottori etc.)",

I am not sure it is four days great. I think it could be, if all you want to do is stay in your room and cuddle and maybe take a short walk to get food or jump into an onsen. problem of course is, summer. make sure you have aircon :)\nnow, close to kinosaki is amanohashidate. that is an interesting area. maybe not stay there 4 days interesting, but... i think with exploring kinosaki and exporing amanohasidate and 2 days not doing anything, you could, in theory, pick worse areas to stay in for four days.  \nand you might even find yourself great spots in the area we dont know about. theres bound to be something... but the lack of a car may make this difficult...\nUp there is Ine, the fishermans village. I think its popular for visitors\n\nnow shirahama is very popular. i know that much. i will go see it myself this fall, and i hear its price gouging? for me its the cheapest hotel i have so far booked, so i dont know. anyway. four days, beach, summer, lots of other people will have the same idea. i think there are worse ideas, but i also think only you can know how awesome a 4 day beach holiday might sound to you.\n\nand now to lake biwa. this is the logical answer, because, its such a big area, you could spend more then 4 days. but of course its not that simple. where would you wanna stay. is there an option to use the water, i.e. go swimming? are there any close other attractions? how busy will the area be? could you feasibly travel land inwards onto some mountains to escape the heat?\n\nI can imagine that otsu will be busy, since its closes from nara, kyoto, osaka to get to the lake. it also would give easy access to a mountain for cooling off (Hiezan). the view up there, spectacular, the temples, confusing af. if you go north along the lake, I think it get more \"boring\", but also less busy.  in the middle of the lake is chikubu, an island with a temple. can be a nice day trip (from omi-imazu for example) if you are into that kind of thing. on the other side, there is Maibara and Hikone. I have yet to be in the north east corner so I can not talk to much about that area...\n\nif you find yourself in the area of kyoto and willing to do a daytrip, I would definitely check out Kifune north of kyoto, its been the summer cooldown spot for centuries. a bit up the mountains, in the forest, away from the city heat. people sit on the river to eat in the restaurant for further cool downs. that would be my first \"must do\" if I ever would be in kansai in summer.\n\ngood luck!",

            "comment": "Might be better if you provide a timframe, budget, activities you both like and entering airport and exiting airport for better and more accurate suggestions/advice from people here. \n\nIf you want slow and easy Hamamatsu there are some decent resort hotels around Lake Hamana close to train lines like the Hammanako, or if you are a little more adventurous and don't mind more complicated transportation the row of Onsen hotels next to Hamanakolike Pal Pal Amusement Park like Hoshino Resorts Kai Enshu. \n\nFor Lake Biwa I would go to Hikone.  The castle and gardens ground are awesome  a good hike.  The old town sections are great relaxing places with good atmosphere.\n\nIf you are going to do the Wakayama peninsula you might as well go all in.  Stop by and see the castle in Wakayama City, Shirahama is a great place to visit and yes it will probably be busy, after that definitely, definitely definitely stay at Hotel Urashima in Kii-Katsuura for a few days.  They got these really interesting cave onsens not to be missed.  Stop by next door one station over in nachi-Katsuura, take a taxi with your gf to the Kumano Kodo - Nakahechi Daimon-saka Pilgrim Route entrance.  It's a good hike all the way up to the temple complex across from Nachi Falls and when you leave and are waiting for the bus/taxi to go back to the station stop by Hiro Shrine to get an up close view of Nachi Falls. After your 2-3 day stay at Hotel Urashima head over to Ise and take in both the outer shrine and inner shrine and the old-style commercial street next to the inner shrine.  There is a bus/taxi to take you from the outer shrine inner shrine.  After Ise you can pick a nice resort hotel in Mie like Miyako Resort Okushima Aqua Forest to relax and do nothing except walk on the beaches if you want.  After that you can jet back to Nagoya for some fun in the city.\n\nIf you are going that out of the way to Kinosaki Onsen you might as well stop by in Kobe city hit the waterfront, stay a night up Arima Onsen, stop by in Himeji that has probably the best-looking castle in Japan then kinosaki onsen.   After Tottori and Matsue and Izumo. \n\nAlternatively you can do Kobe, Arima Onsen, Himeji, Okayama, day trip to Fukuyama and the quaint seaside town of Onomichi, back to Okayama, Hiroshima, Itsukushima day trip to Kure. \n\nAnyways Kansai is a big place and we don't know what your timframe is but if it's limited you either do wakayama peninsula or other other half past Osaka and save the rest for the next trip.",

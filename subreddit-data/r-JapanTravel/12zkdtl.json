    "postText": "I just wanted to share an awesome app that I used when I was in Japan for 2 weeks. I originally reserved a pocket wifi for over $100 for my trip, but later I learned about an app called airalo that provides virtual SIM cards for data at an extremely affordable price. Example: I got the 5 gb package for $11.50! They also sell regional SIM cards if you are going to backpack through several countries over a span of time. \n\nThe network speed was very fast, easy set up, and responsive support. Make sure your phone is UNLOCKED and ESim compatible.\n\nEdit: seems like there is some confusion regarding \u201cnew number\u201d with the eSim. Just want to clarify that Airalo doesn\u2019t give you a new number, it only grants you internet connection at your destination. You can use WhatsApp or Google voice to call your loved ones because those 2 apps work over internet connection. iMessages will work as long as you have internet so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue as well. \n\nIf you want a new number and want to call other landline or people who don\u2019t use those apps, look into eSim+, it\u2019s also an app. You pay $7 per month for a new number, and calls and texts are charged on a minute/text basis ( you can essentially call Any country). I used that app to make local calls in Japan ( restaurants, hotels, etc )",

The one thing I saw on reviews was the company has grown very fast so customer service is poor. But we didn\u2019t have any problems. Glad it worked well for you!",

It gave me a server error, was offline for an hour, then came back online and then went back offline again for another hour or so. This was the only time during our 11 day trip that I had any issues with it across Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara. \n\nI would pack a separate battery pack for the pocket wifi. It comes with a battery pack but I noticed it didn\u2019t really charge it. Thankfully I brought multiple large battery packs so I just designated one to charge the wifi pack every 6 hours or so.",

For the 16 days I was there, my Ubigi connected first and I think I tried 2-3 days to get airalo to work as well (because I bought 1 plan to try) but ultimately I gave up trying (also the ios setup guide for airalo was outdated and that tested my patience a bit).  \n\nOverall e-sims are great. I bought Ubigi 10GB for 30 days and despite being the main itinerary lead, I still had plenty of data to spare.",

For some reason, I always find wifi pocket hotspots come up in discussions in Japan travel groups. I never see these available in other countries (at least not as widely as in Japan). Pocket wifi was introduced back in the early days of smartphones when Japan was first to introduce 3G and had different frequencies than other countries. Hotspot was the only way to go at the time. Now, getting a local SIM is much more convenient as there\u2019s no need to carry and keep charged another device. These can be rather heavy, especially if you need an extra battery pack as they drain fast. A lot of you say, \u201cwe are travelling in a group, so it more cost effective that way\u201d, but what happens when you want to split up at any given time. Who holds on to the wifi? With a SIM, everyone has their own connections whether with you or if they step out on their own.\n\nMy advice, go, SIM, unless you truly have no choice (like you phone is locked).",

I used my AIS Thai SIM card to buy a roaming package, 10gb for all of Asia or 12gb for japan only, for 400\u0e3f, about $11.5. Totally hassle free and a lot cheaper, was 5g full speed. Bet if you can get a Vietnamese or Cambodian it should be cheaper also.",

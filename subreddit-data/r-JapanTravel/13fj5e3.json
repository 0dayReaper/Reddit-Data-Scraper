    "postText": "**This discussion thread has been set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel. Please stay civil, abide by the rules, and be helpful. Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* For travelers entering the country on or after April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)). The COVID/quarantine section of Visit Japan Web has been removed.\n* Tourists entering Japan should still have their Immigration process and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration and a QR code for Customs, which can smooth your entry procedures.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

It\u2019s still pretty as you are in a more rural area with rolling fields and there are shops where you can buy lavender goods but it\u2019s too early for the actual flowers. Check recent photos in Google Maps for the places you are thinking of visiting to see what it looks like now. Biei Blue Pond is there but truthfully, I was underwhelmed with that.  Best to combine the flowers in bloom with the pond - but just the pond alone is a long trip.  But if you want a chill day where you sit back and watch the countryside from the bus tour you\u2019re on you might enjoy it still.  Keep in mind there\u2019s tons of great shopping at the Hokkaido airport where you can buy all the same stuff at the normal prices so dont just go to Biei to shop. Just get to the airport 2-3 hours early when departing Hokkaido as the shipping there has everything you\u2019d ever want to buy from Hokkaido pretty much.",

Asakusa is quieter and still convenient, you can access a ton of areas from Ueno Station, which is fairly close to Asakusa.",

I bet this has been answered before, but after a few minutes of google search I couldn't find a clear answer. Most sites say that it does not include calling (which makes sense because its only a hotspot). But if you have wifi calling enabled, couldn't you make calls? Just wanted to clarify so we know it will work. I know e-SIMs are another alternative, but the pocket wifi seems more economical for the unlimited data with multiple people.",

YouTube and TikTok are great for ideas/inspiration, but they often edit videos together in a way that makes it seem locations are much closer together than they are.  Sample itineraries like these, put the main sites together in a logical way logistically and give you a better sense of what is possible to see within a day. You don\u2019t have to follow them exactly, but they can be a helpful starting point to planning your day. \n\n - [Inside Kyoto: Itineraries](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-itineraries)\n\nThe number 1 tip for any visit to Kyoto or Tokyo is to lump sightseeing together by district. These are *huge* and very spread out cities. Number 2 tip is to get your one to two must-see/do\u2019s done as early each day as possible.  Then, anything else you do that day, is gravy. \n\n- [Tokyo Districts](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-districts/)\n- [Kyoto Districts](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-districts)\n- [Osaka Districts](https://insideosaka.com/osaka-districts/)\n- [Save the places you want to visit in Google maps.](https://www.theunconventionalroute.com/google-maps-saved-places/) \n- Then, zoom out and see where those places are lumped together.  Do *that* specific district/area in the morning and shift to another district/area in the afternoon.  This way you don\u2019t lose time/money criss-crossing the city.  \n- See how long it will take to travel via public transit (or walking if within the same area) between your sites.  You need to account for travel time and add in an extra 15- 20 minutes from what Google Maps says as you may get turned around looking for your entrance/exit or platform in the subway/train stations. \n- Be sure you check opening hours/days in Google maps too.  You don\u2019t want to show up at 8 am to Akihabara only to find all the shops closed or to a museum on a Monday as that is often (but not always) a closed day. \n\nHappy Planning!",

Lines can just get long.  \nd) Maybe they have an express pass for a ride they think they will love but they are hoping to do it twice, once via standby and once with their pass.  \nIf you're happy with your express passes and are not worried about going on rides more than once or going on popular rides you don't have an express pass for, you can go later.",

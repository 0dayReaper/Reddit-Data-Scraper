If so, before immediately before or after Kyoto? \n\nAlso, does going to Yokosuka from Kyoto make sense, or would that require me first stopping off in Tokyo only to go back in the direction of Yokosuka? If that's the case, I might push Yokosuka to the end of my trip. \n\nBefore you tell me to skip Yokosuka outright, though, I should say from the outset that at least one night there is essential as its basically a pilgrimage. You can read more about it here if [inclined](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shenmue/comments/13g55kg/comment/jk3iob9/?context=3). I could skip the second night or also do one night less in Tokyo in order to fit in Hiroshima.   \n\n\nJune 3 - Arrive Osaka 9:25 PM   \nJune 4 - Osaka\r  \nJune 5 - TRAIN to Kyoto\r  \nJune 6 - Kyoto\r  \nJune 7 - TRAIN to Yokosuka \r  \n\rJune 8 - Yokosuka\r  \nJune 9 - TRAIN to Tokyo\r  \nJune 11 - Tokyo\r  \nJune 12 - Tokyo\r  \nJune 13 - Tokyo\r  \nJune 14 - FLIGHT TO USA 3:30 PM",

            "comment": "That looks incredibly tight as it is for all the travel you're doing (which effectively is 9 days with a few travel days where you have to also do check-in/check-out of hotels, etc.. Is this your first time visiting Japan and - if so - are you flying in from the US or a destination beforehand? Asking as jet lag may or may not really need to be factored in. \n\nDo you need to stay in both Osaka &amp; Kyoto (as I'm guessing that's what is happening when you say \"train to\"). They aren't far apart so I'd suggest staying in one or the other (depending on what you're wanting the vibe for most), staying close to the right station, and then getting the train between them. That's one way to make your life slightly easier but may not shave off that much effort for the short period of time we're talking.\n\nAlso IMO depends on what your plans are here - but either way I personally wouldn't try to fit Hiroshima into this already packed schedule. Also, do you *need* to stay over in Yokosuka, or could you just day trip from Tokyo? The less moving you/your stuff around between hotels - IMO - the better as the more time you have to actually explore (but if you are only travelling with a backpack, I guess it's less of a concern - unsure as you've not said). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:  Hiroshima is great, but if you decide to try to fit this in you are going to miss out on other things/be exhausted &amp; feeling like you're spending more time travelling than seeing things. At least that's how I think I'd feel with this schedule if you tried to add another spot in. If this isn't your first trip - however - there may be room for cutting/adding.**",

If you were coming from the US, it would definitely be a lot more brutal (especially arriving that late at night)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I absolutely do not need to stay in both Osaka and Kyoto. That's a helpful tip. If that's the case, I might just stay in Osaka because that's where I land late on the 3rd.\n\nOkay cool, yeah I would definitely just make it easier on yourself and stay in Osaka near one of the stations that'll be the best to get into Kyoto from just for ease (I want to say it's Umeda station but I can't fully remember - give it a quick search).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I am also open to not doing an overnight in Yokosuka, at least I think I am. I just want to experience the city both during the day and at night. But I don't have to sleep there.\n\nI personally think you should be able to experience the city both day/night (i guess depending on how early/late you're wanting to stay maybe? and what you're wanting to do?) by just doing a day trip from Tokyo so I personally would consider that - especially if you'll have bags with you. Maybe worth investigating how early you'd want to get there, how you'd get there &amp; back, and cost as well as what you want to do there because obviously if you're wanting to do so much that you need two days, then it would make sense to stay there. No idea what's really there or what you're wanting to do as I've never considered it myself, but if you're just wanting a feel for the place vs doing anything specific, my vote would be for the day trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, a day trip vs an overnight/2 days in Yokosuka still won't - IMO - give you enough time back to properly fit in Hiroshima. Especially if you've never really left the airports of Japan before. Only exception/argument I could see made would be if you genuinely weren't really that fussed about seeing/doing much in Japan except Yokosuka and you were really wanting to go to Hiroshima for a particular reason. Then I guess I would maybe remove some time elsewhere and go to Hiroshima (still a push IMO), but then don't expect to get much out of any of the locations you currently have listed on your itinerary except maybe Yokosuka. You're going to struggle as it is with what you have. Just my 2p.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDefinitely worth writing a trip report once you've done the trip though so others can see how you found your time there :)",

Or think they want one, decide it's not their vibe, and switch to the other with little to no impact (other than the cost of the train fairs they maybe haven't factored in). Definitely no need to travel between. With Hiroshima, they would definitely need to make the decision if they want Hiroshima **or** Osaka/Kyoto as there's a bit less fluidity/ease there. It's still doable to physically do, just wouldn't be fun or a good experience IMO. Too much missing out from all areas (which I think will already happen as is, unfortunately). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompletely agree that - with the time available - it'd probably be better to focus on Tokyo &amp; surrounding areas/day trips completely than trying to fit in Kansai.",

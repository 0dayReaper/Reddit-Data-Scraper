    "postText": "As I've been lurking around this forum for quite a while before going, I thought I'd write a report of how our trip went to give back to this amazing community. \n\nFirst of all, I'd like to say thanks to everyone here for all the extremely useful information! \n\nMe (M30) and my wife (29F) had the chance to travel through Japan for about 18 days. We are both Muslim so we kept to a halal food regime (seafood and some halal places here and there). \n\nGeneral tips:\n- JR Pass: I'd say the JR pass is only worth it if you use the shinkansen (bullet train) for long distances a lot. That being said, it also provides a form of comfort and ease of mind. We had an unexpected change in our itinerary which made us stay an extra night in Tokyo, having the JR pass made this easy for us to just go on another train the next day. We also used it quite a lot in Tokyo and Osaka for smaller distance trips (protip: use the Navitime app to see if your itinerary is covered by JR pass). You could just take a 7 day pass and activate it during the period you would be doing all the long distance travel. \n\n- Get an IC card (Suica/Pasmo). Easy to use and charge and can be used in convenience stores and in a lot of other places. \n\n- don't overcharge your itinerary. Japan is beautiful and has a lot to offer, but try to keep it cool and enjoy the things you will visit. We did an average of 20-25k steps daily and we were not even rushing things.. (pack decent shoes) \n\n- Navigating through train stations might be hard and overwhelming at first (especially the big ones like Shinjuku) but just find your base point and always follow the colors. Google maps is also very handy as it provides detailed information about platforms and what exits to use, etc.. \n\n- Google lens came in quite handy at times! \n\n- luggage forwarding! Such a thing of beauty. Most hotels will help you with the procedure but if they don't, you can just go to a post office or most of the convenience stores help you out with it as well. The prices depend on the size of your luggage from what I've experienced, the distance doesn't seem to matter. \n\n- Reservations: so basically, if you know you wanna go somewhere in Japan, try to book as soon as possible. Almost all of the activities we did (Usj, Disneysea, karting in Tokyo, Teamlab, Ghibli museum) needed reservations well in advance. In kyoto, we even had a hard time finding places to eat because all the good looking restaurants were constantly fully booked. Keep this in mind when going. \n\nHalal food tips :\n- Honolu Ramen (Osaka) - we only tried the one in Osaka and the ramen with the chicken karaage was really good. Highly recommend. \n- Curry Coco (they have locations everywhere) (not halal but provides good curry and seafood/veggie options) \n- Osaka PANGA Yakiniku (Osaka) - halal, good food and they have halal Wagyu. \n\nAlright so here we go :\n\n15/05 - 20/05 Tokyo \n\nWe stayed at the APA Hotel Higashi-Shinjuku Kabukicho Tower. Rooms were pretty small compared to European standards (no closets) but overall the room was clean and all the amenities you'd need (wifi, hair dryer, tooth brush, shampoo, etc). As for the location, Shinjuku station was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and Shinjuku is a cool place to be at generally speaking. It does get a bit hectic at night so depending on what you're into, you may or may not appreciate the vibes. \n\n15/05 - arrival day:\n\nWe arrived at 6pm at Haneda Airport and immediately took a shuttle bus to Kabukicho Tower. Just ask the tourist information point at the airport and they'll guide you. It was 1300 yen per person and it led us almost straight to our hotel. After a long flight, this was a welcome comfort. \nWe checked in and went for a walk in the neighbourhood but we were pretty tired so we went to sleep pretty early. \n\n16/05 - Shinjuku neighborhood, Sumo fighting and karting through Tokyo\n\nWe started off our day having some Japanese brunch in Shinjuku, visited the Don Quijote and went to ryogoku to go see Sumo wrestling (really cool experience and if you stick around the arena you'll see the Sumo wrestlers walking to the arena, they are mostly very friendly and they will accept to take pictures with you). After that, we headed to the karting office and we went for a karting ride through Tokyo (shibuya, harakuju, etc) which was an amazing experience. It was already dark out so driving through these streets with all the flashy Tokyo lights is a must do in my opinion. \n\n17/05 - TeamLab, Asakusa and akihabara\n\nWe headed to teamLab in the morning. It was a fun experience and I certainly don't regret doing it. Some of the exhibitions are really impressive. It was a bit crowded. We headed to Asakusa and wandered around the streets while heading for Senso-ji temple. Really cool temple. \nAfter that, we headed to Akihabara to stroll around and see some anime/manga/gaming related stores. We saw a few cool things and spent some time in the arcades but I was a bit disappointed by the lack of merch for the older manga and games. Everything seems to be about the new and popular anime which was a bit of a let down for me. Headed back to Shinjuku for dinner and called it a day. \n\n18/05 - Disneysea Tokyo \n\nMy wife was super excited to go and see Disneysea so we did and boy we did not regret it! Sunny weather, not too many people and an overall fun experience. Contrary to what most people seem to be saying here, we actually arrived around 10.30 am and the gates were empty. We walked in, downloaded the app and just went to the attractions that had the less waiting time and we ended up doing almost all of them. Thrill wise I'd say we have way better attractions in Europe, but the scenery and details of the park are incredible. The rides are very immersive and beautifully done. I'm not a Disney fan at all but I really enjoyed my time there. A lot of the rides are meant for children as well so you can skip those. I really enjoyed the Indiana Jones, the horror tower and the volcano one. \n\n19/05 Ginza &amp; Shinjuku\n\nOriginally, we had planned quite a lot for this day, but my wife wasn't feeling great in the morning so we decided to sleep in and head out a bit later. We went to Ginza, visited the huge Uniqlo and did some shopping there. We then headed back for a calm night, had some fun in the arcades and finished up. \n\n20/05 - Kawaguchiko \n\nWe took a bus in the morning at Shinjuku station to kawaguchiko and stayed in a Ryokan with a public onsen with a view on Fujisan. We really loved the atmosphere here as it was completely different from Tokyo. So calm and peaceful. We stayed at the hotel, we booked a private onsen and had a relax day/evening. \n\n21/05 - kawaguchiko lake &amp; arakura Sengen Shrine\n\nWe checked out of our hotel, headed to the station and took a train to the arakura Sengen Shrine stop. We went up the stairs (not too hard but it was hot so stay hydrated!) and enjoyed the magnificent view of Mt. Fuji with the shrine. It was a bit crowded and it was getting worse as time passed on. We decided to head down and go to Honcho Street. Nothing special about the street in itself, it just has a pretty cool view of fuji. \nPlease be aware that fuji can get shy at times and is not always visible on a cloudy day. Don't lose hope, the clouds move around and you'll get to see fujisan. After that, we decided to head to the kawaguchiko station, rented some electric bikes (highly recommend) and we did the full tour of the kawaguchiko lake. It took us about 2.30 hours with stops and the electric bikes made it an easy and enjoyable experience. Cycling around the lake with the different parks and the mountains and mt fuji in the background is a magical experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone going to this region. \n\nWe headed back to the station, took a bus back to Tokyo and we were supposed to head to Kyoto but due to traffic delays, we missed the last shinkansen and booked an extra night in Tokyo. \n\nThis is the first part of our trip, I'll get back to the next part (Kyoto and Osaka) another time but please feel free to comment if you want more details on some aspects.\n\nEdit : I forgot to add, for the karting you will be needing an international drivers licence or you can get yours translated in Japan. Someone did it for us so unfortunately I don't have the details on where exactly you can do it but I could find the info if needed, just send me message and I'll see what I can find out!",

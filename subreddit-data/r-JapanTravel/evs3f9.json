PLEASE READ THE LINK ABOVE, OR OUR SUMMARY BELOW:**\n\n&gt;**\"The Cabinet on Tuesday approved a bill that would enable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency, if needed, as Japan scrambles to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Abe, who faced criticism for being too relaxed in his initial response to the outbreak, has sought the power to prepare for a \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d**\n\n&gt;**\"Moreover, the prime minister has extended a government request to event organizers nationwide to refrain from holding such gatherings by about 10 days. The request was initially until March 19.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"The legal change would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency lasting up to two years if coronavirus infections spread rapidly across the country and fears are raised of a grave impact on people\u2019s lives and the economy.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"Once an emergency is declared, prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for schools to close and events to be canceled.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"Local governments can also demand that essential supplies such as medicine and food be sold to them. They can temporarily take over private land and facilities to provide medical care.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"Abe has already requested that schools across the nation close and big sports and cultural events be canceled or postponed. But under the current law, the government does not have the legal power to enforce school closures or event cancellations.\"**\n\n&gt;**\"The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and the Democratic Party for the People say the prime minister should seek prior parliamentary approval before any declaration of a state of emergency.\"**\n\n**Once again, *this bill does not enact a State of Emergency for the country*, it merely means to reflect and strengthen the laws put in place from previous viral outbreaks in Japan.**\n\n**Also of note is the [recommendation by a panel of experts to continue closures for another 10 days beyond what has already been noted](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/29c7cf7a3604-urgent-abe-extends-request-for-event-cancellations-amid-virus-spread.html) in the comments. We will be updating the closures thread as necessary as companies extend the break.**\n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 03/08**\n\n**Border control increase begins today in Japan.** [**NHK has an article on the general guidelines for border control at this time.**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200309_01/)  \n\n**We have reprinted the article in full below.**  \n\n&gt;Japan increased border control measures on Monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\n&gt;**The government is asking people arriving from China and South Korea, including Japanese nationals, to stay at home or other private accommodation for two weeks at their own expense.**\n\n&gt;**Officials are asking those travelers to refrain from using public transportation, including planes, trains, buses and taxis, and use private or rental cars from the airport of their entry to their homes or accommodation facilities.**\n\n&gt;Visitors are asked to declare to quarantine officials where they will stay during the first two weeks as well as their means of transportation from the airport. They will be asked to remain at the airport until arrangements are ready.\n\n&gt;During the two-week period they will be asked to check their health daily. If they develop a fever and other symptoms they are asked to call a consultation center and visit a designated hospital.\n\n&gt;The measures are expected to remain in effect until the end of this month. **They are not legally-binding, but the health ministry is asking for cooperation.**\n\n**Once again, we would advise if you have a stopover in any of the affected countries (China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau - named specifically.) that you contact your airline to change your flight as soon as possible. These measures will be in force until the end of this month at the very least.**\n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 03/06**\n\n&gt;[**\"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: \"We will ask people entering Japan from the two countries to stay at places designated by the quarantine chief for two weeks and not to use public transportation systems in the country.\"**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200306_02/)\n\n&gt;**A more in depth explanation of the restrictions is explained** [**here.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/05/national/japan-quarantine-arrivals-china-south-korea/#.XmHjSyhKiUk) **We have reprinted the article below:**\n\n&gt;\"Japan will request that people arriving from South Korea and China be quarantined for two weeks at designated facilities in Japan to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday.\"\n\n&gt;\u201cWe will strengthen immigration quarantines on people from the two countries,\u201d Abe told a Cabinet-level task force meeting on the virus.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe will ask them to stay in designated areas for two weeks and not to use public transport in the country.\u201d\n\n&gt;\"The measure will take effect at 12:00 a.m. on March 9 and last through March 31, he said.\"\n\n&gt;\"The government is calling for tourists from China, where the virus emerged and South Korea, which has been hard hit by the outbreak, to put off travel to Japan and will cancel visas for travelers from the two countries, Abe said.\"\n\n&gt;**\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of in-bound travel from China and South Korea, we will limit arrival destinations for aircraft from the two countries to Narita and Kansai airports,\u201d he said.**\n\n&gt;**The visa suspensions will effectively ban all Chinese nationals from entering Japan.**\n\n&gt;**\u201cWe will suspend transport of passengers by ship and cancel temporary and multiple-entry visas that have already been issued,\u201d Abe said.**\n\n&gt;**Flights from China and South Korea will be able to land only in Narita Airport near Tokyo and Osaka\u2019s Kansai Airport, he said. Abe also said that bans on entering Japan will be expanded to foreign nationals who have been in any part of South Korea or Iran.**\n\n&gt;**This appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus.** [**The NHK has posted an article on the other measures of the bill,**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200305_50/) **and how it will allow the Government to enact a State Of Emergency - giving them the power to \"control some businesses' operating hours, close schools and instruct people to stay indoors. Authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners' consent for medical purposes.\"**  \n\n**In short, if you are a Korean or Chinese National, you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine. Any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either Narita or Kansai Airport, starting March 9th, and lasting until March 31st. It will also include visitors from Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Japanese Nationals coming from these countries - we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas. Entry Visas are being cancelled, for China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border, and could be sent home after the 14 days are up.**\n\n**If you have a flight with a stopover in either country, you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct, or re-route through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine. We have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded OR included in this requirement, but it's better to be safe than sorry.**\n\n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/29**\n&gt;[**More temporary closures and cancellations have been added to the list, please click here to go directly to the comment. We are updating this list as information comes in, and have split the lists by area.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/evs3f9/japan_travel_the_2019ncov_and_you_guidelines_on/fih7ih7/) \n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/28**  \n\n&gt;[**The Japanese Government has rolled out requirements to help curb the spread of the virus, as the next two weeks are crucial for transmission within the country.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/25/national/science-health/japan-guidelines-covid19-coronavirus/#.XlaKGChKiUk) Presumably, this is why we are currently seeing an increase in closures and cancellations by locations that would normally draw crowds of tourists and locals, such as museums and sports events. \n\n&gt;The Government is asking people to take even more care when in public with frequent handwashing and sanitizing, and wearing a mask if you plan to be out in large crowds for long periods of time. **As tourists, you should consistently perform with the utmost caution to follow these rules to help prevent yourself from catching the virus.** [The NHK has provided a very helpful article](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/877/) (with video!) that explains how to wash your hands properly and thoroughly to help break down the chain of bacteria and viruses, and how to wear a mask properly to help stop the spread of infection.  \n\n**We'd like to remind you that while these measures are effective when applied consistently, they will not necessarily prevent you from catching the virus in the aforementioned \"large crowds\" that the Health Ministry is asking people to avoid.** This information is intended as a guideline to help prevent transmission, but certain risk groups should see this as a warning that the Government is expecting things to get worse before they get better, and they should closely look at the options for travel, as **the best method for not catching COVID-19 in Japan is to not go at this time.**   \n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/23** \n\n**[The CDC has raised the alert level for travel to Japan to Level 2.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/coronavirus-japan) This means they are advising that tourists practice enhanced measures to protect themselves from the spread of the virus. Please check the link above for more information. If you are older or have pre-existing health conditions, the CDC now also firmly recommends reconsidering travel to Japan.**\n\n&gt;**If a potential quarantine on arrival home after your trip would disrupt your life enough to cause hardship (job loss, arranging last minute care for family/pets, possible transmission to vulnerable individuals) we firmly recommend that you postpone travel at this time.**\n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/21**\n\n**Transmission and hospitalization in children under the age of 10 has been confirmed in Sapporo, with 3 recent cases being revealed.** The Japan Times has more information [here.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/21/national/hokkaido-coronavirus/#.XlAjvFNlAwA) One child is a preschooler who returned from Wuhan with his parents on a chartered evacuation flight in January, and the child is recovering from a mild infection. The other two cases are local to Hokkaido, one is under the age of 10, the other is presumed to be a bit older, but reported to be elementary school aged. Both have been hospitalized and are recovering.  \n**We would urge you to confirm with your pediatrician or family physician before travel with children to Japan in the face of this news. It has been reported that children are not often afflicted, or may have mild symptoms, but that does not equate immunity to the virus - as shown here.** \n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/04:**\n\n**The JNTO (Japan National Tourism Organization) is advising any and all tourists arriving in Japan to have travel health insurance in case they require treatment or hospitalization as a result of contracting the virus. The Government of Japan *will NOT cover the costs* associated with treatment during this time, and you *will* be required to pay out of pocket should an infection occur, and you have no insurance.**  \n\n[**More information can be found at the following link from the JNTO, along with links to companies that will provide travel health insurance IN Japan on arrival.**](https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/)  \n\n**We strongly recommend you add Trip Cancellation *and* Travel Health Insurance to your budget before you depart - for precisely this kind of occurrence. Please take the time to research travel insurance, and confirm with your bank or personal health care plan what is covered, or not covered, and purchase a plan that meets your needs in accordance with your trip.** \n\n##**TOURISM UPDATE 01/31:**\n\n**The NHK has published an article reporting that JNTO has a phone number to call should tourists *currently in Japan* require assistance. We would not recommend contacting this number if you are not currently in the country, as this line is intended to assist with possible cases and have them directed to medical facilities for treatment.** [The article has been removed, but we have a link to the phone numbers here.](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200131_41/amp.html) There is also a link to the JNTO for further information, if needed.\n\n&gt;**\"The Japan National Tourism Organization is offering phone consultation services for foreign tourists who are concerned about the new strain of coronavirus.\"**\n\n&gt;\"The Japan Visitor Hotline offers 24-hour services in Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean.\"\n\n&gt;**\"The hotline can refer callers who may be infected with the virus to the nearest medical institution.** It also provides information on measures to prevent infection such as hand washing and gargling.\"\n\n&gt;\"The organization encourages foreign tourists to call if they have any concerns.\"\n\n&gt;**\"The hotline number is 050-3816-2787.**\"  \n\n**Calling from Overseas?

How does it affect me?\"**  \n\n \n[**The FAQ from the CDC on COVID-19 is here.**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html)  \n \n[**The symptoms more frequently noted include the following:**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html)  \n\n&gt;- **High fever.**  \n\n&gt;- **Shortness of Breath.** This is an absolute call to health authorities, if you or anyone in your travel group experiences this symptom you should be notifying staff of your hotel/hostel right away for medical assistance.  \n\n&gt;- **Coughing, with or without phlegm.** If you begin to cough, and feel very congested in the chest quickly, do not delay in notifying health authorities. Pneumonia is one of the reasons why this flu is deadly in certain people, and the CDC has already recorded an instance in China where a healthy 36 year old victim died from pneumonia brought on by the virus. **There is currently no treatment for this virus, aside from supportive care to relieve symptoms. Any cases diagnosed with pneumonia are generally hospitalized.**  \n\n[The recommendations for curbing the spread of COVID-19 is detailed on this page.]( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)   \n\n**Major risks with this virus are:**\n\n&gt;- **Transmission from person to person has been noted in Japan.**  \n\n&gt;- **It can take up to 14 days before you show ANY symptoms**, meaning that your body is shedding the virus in bodily fluids such as exhalation (commonly called aerosol), mucus from the nose and mouth, and fecal matter.  \n\n&gt;- **Carriers of the virus can be asymptomatic** (not showing any symptoms like sneezing/coughing) while they are transmitting the virus to others.  \n\n**The crux of curbing any virus is to wash your hands, or use sanitizer on a frequent basis when touching items in public. Also:**   \n\n&gt;-  **Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have not been washed or sanitized.**  \n\n&gt;-  **Cover any coughs or sneezes with your arm, and/or a tissue. Throw the tissue away, and wash your hands afterwards.**  \n\n&gt;-  **If you are opening doors and wish to avoid picking up anything from door handles, use your elbow or foot to push the door open if possible.**   \n \n##**\u201cI\u2019m traveling to Japan in March/April/May. Should I cancel my trip and reschedule?\u201d**  \n \n**If you are travelling from China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, or Iran, please pay special attention to the update from 03/06. Japan is currently moving to block tourists from those regions to control the spread of the virus within the country. You will be quarantined and possibly sent home after the 14 days is up, as travel visas for those countries are being cancelled as of 03/09. Please contact your airline for more information. In the CDC Level 2 Warning above, they have specifically advised that individuals with pre-existing health problems look to cancel any non-essential travel to Japan at this time. We have noted other instances in the** [**FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel#wiki_.22i_need_some_information_about_the_covid-19_situation_in_japan._what_do_you_know_at_this_time.3F.22) and provided further information. Some examples include:**  \n\n&gt;- **If you have a compromised immune system, have asthma, are prone to serious lung infections, are long-term heavy smokers, or reside full-time with anyone in your home that has any of those health concerns.**\n\n&gt;- **If you are traveling with anyone under the age of 5, or over the age of 50-60, and/or they would be considered in a risk group for the seasonal flu.**  \n\n&gt;- **If you do not have a Trip Cancellation, or Travel Health Insurance package prior to departure, you should strongly reconsider not purchasing it prior to leaving your home country. On February 4th, the JNTO confirmed that tourists without travel health insurance would not be covered by the Japanese Government for treatment if infection occurred, and the patient will have to pay out of pocket for any treatment required. Please see the FAQ for information on obtaining insurance on arrival in Japan from either Tokio Marine, or Sompo Japan Nipponkoa. Note that you will only be able to access either website linked through JNTO on arrival in Japan.**\n\n&gt;- **If you are in any way concerned about contracting an illness that would put you out of commission for your entire trip, and may require hospitalization. Some users have already informed us that they are being told they would be subject to a mandatory 14 day self-quarantine at home on return from their trip. If you would not able to comply with those restrictions on arrival from Japan, (work, family, pet responsibilities for instance) you will want to seriously reconsider your trip.**\n\n##**\u201dI\u2019m traveling for the Olympics!

Im actually not too worried with the travel there. But more worried if shops are open for us.\n\nThanks!",

Chase said they could only give me a travel credit for the full amount I paid to be used by the end of the year on united/ana flights I believe. No more change fees for united now.  Both hotels and flight were nonfundable but ultimately was able to get refunds for them both. Given the worsening situation here and now the strange travel ban for all of Europe, things aren't looking too good for traveling anywhere at the moment. Going to try and rebook for October when more flight deals show up . Best of luck everyone.",

Planning to reschedule for a year from now, had free cancellations in hotels and ryokan. Last step is to officially cancel the flight (AA bought but traveling by JAL) and hope credit card will reimburse the cancellation fees. (Let me know if you have questions about any of this)\n\nWe made the decision a couple of days ago. 2 weeks ago we were set on going, even a week ago, and we were one of those people that were not concerned about the virus or getting it and we kept checking this sub and every news of it. We finalized our decision from just the overall uncertainty of everything that could happen that is out of our control, closures, quarantines upon return or during there. There is just too much that could go wrong and we'd constantly be worried about flights being cancelled on the way back or things changing one day to the next. Additionally, we had travel before and after the trip for work and anything that would jeopardize that would not be ideal at all.",

They said that they will most likely be able to refund it after I send in a dispute since it's an \"unforseen circumstance\" especially seeing as I bought it so long ago. But basically I haven't done this yet, trying to wait it out a little bit more to see if AA cancels their flights and I don't have to go through this route.",

I will regret this for the rest of my life but my partner\u2019s anxiety about travel was too stressful for me to deal with. A last minute solo vacation was imminent and I\u2019d be the bad guy for leaving them behind.\n\nI got a full refund to my card, although confirmation is a few days out. My process was not so easy, I could not cancel online or through the delta app due to systems being down. I waited on hold for 90 minutes and the rep said they would give me credits equal to my flight cost. I had until September (12 months after the purchase date) to use the credits. I asked about a full cash refund and was put on hold while he talked with a supervisor. I think the rep had my back, they couldn\u2019t issue a full refund, unless, either of us had \u201cquestionable health\u201d.I took the opportunity and said my boyfriend is sick often. Hey then confirmed \u201cso they have a compromised immune system? I\u2019ll put you on hold to finalize\u201d. They did so and the call dropped at which point our flight couldn\u2019t be found on my trips. After 90 more minutes on hold we confirmed the flight canceled. \n\nI was told they would not issue a full refund on normal cancellations. So if you try to cancel tell them it\u2019s due to health reasons. They did not ask for proof. They do not want to give you full refunds. I know it\u2019s dishonest but I wouldn\u2019t have been given a refund if this rep didn\u2019t go out of the way to help. Good luck!",

I'm already very sick with what I strongly suspect to be COVID-19 and I'm not sure I will recover in time. \n\nI'm using AllJapanTours for a guided tour for the first half of my trip and they emailed me today saying they are waiving fees to postpone their tours for a very limited period, so I went ahead and rescheduled to November - nothing but great things to say about the company's customer service (and no, I'm not shilling for them, just have been very impressed with them). Still trying and waiting on getting a refund for my flights (JAL booked through Expedia) and have gotten refunds for all the activities I booked.\n\nFor me it wasn't the closures (most things I wanted to do were still open), catching the virus, pandemic declaration, or even the mandatory self-quarantine imposed by my job, it was just the uncertainty of it all - nobody has any idea what could transpire in the next few weeks (or even in the two weeks I'm there). It's a gigantic bummer because I was really excited to see the cherry blossoms, eat amazing food, go hiking, and get a tattoo there, but autumn is my absolute favorite season anyway so I'm optimistic that I will have the experience I've wanted since I was a kid at that time.",

We'll be in Bali for the remainder of the month. Do we go do we not go, anyone already in Japan have any thoughts? We aren't too concerned with seeing museums and attractions that would be shut down to the public. As long as we can visit temples, nature, and meet other travelers in our hostels we have booked, we would have a great time. 14 day quarantine upon return to the states is our biggest concern due to asking for more time off from our jobs which will be tough. Do you think our experience of Japan will suffer immensely - are people not going out to bars/restaurants and therefore giving an altered perception of the big cities ie: Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot to consider but any insight is appreciated. We need to make up our minds soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

The virus wont stop me from enjoying a good meal and a refreshing drink, and as you say, smaller crowds will work in our favor.",

Still very much crowded in those areas but mostly locals and some tourists here and there. If you're trying to buy tax free at any store you'll notice that the lineups are close to none (due to lack of Chinese/Korean tourism). \n\nI went for sushi lunch at Uobei (I never went at lunch before so I'm not sure if the store being half full if normal? I was still in Shibuya and passed by around dinner and there was a lineup at that time. Also passed by Flippers pancakes in the afternoon, there was one other table of tourists other than myself and the store was about 80% full. There was sanitizer coming into the store as well. Later that afternoon I visited the Starbucks near the scramble but it was at full capacity so we decided to head to L'occitane cafe, got seated about 10 minutes later, the cafe was at full capacity, one table to tourists aside from us again, the rest locals. \n\nI had dinner at an Izakaya in Shibuya and it was mostly all locals and filled up before 7pm. I also noticed in these three areas a lot less people were wearing masks compared to the areas I visited the last two days even though it was much more crowded.",

I figure I'm probably gonna get it at some point whether I travel or not. My concern is If either Japan or my home country (U.S) will make some drastic changes while i'm there. Originally I was worried that I would go and while there the U.S would deny me re-entry or something like that. Now with the U.S with more cases and soon to be drastically more cases than Japan. My concern is more that Japan wont let Americans enter in the first place to protect the Olympics. Luckily I booked everything with the ability to cancel for a full refund so I will probably hold on to my reservations until it gets a little bit closer the departure date but I'm finding it more and more unlikely that things are going to be much better by then. Thinking about re scheduling for November. What a freakin' Pain this has been!",

We have put forth a lot of time and effort planning this trip for it to be cancelled/postponed. Obviously we will evaluate the coronavirus climate and make the smartest decision possible. The biggest concern for me is getting to and from Japan and fear of quarantine. From what I can tell from the travelers either currently in Japan or having just returned - things are (mostly) business as usually once you get there.\n\nWhat is everyone else's feelings that are traveling at the end of March? What is the \"make or break\" decisive factor for you? I am ultimately awaiting the CDC's judgement closer to our trip which I suspect will be largely based on the number of cases and the rate of change in the country.",

Am I safer in NY or on the beach in Bali? Where would I rather get hospitalized?

I\u2019m covered for getting sick and for travel interruptions. I bought the policy before this was news. Interestingly this policy is not for specific countries so I could go and then say I wanted to travel to Thailand but couldn\u2019t because of their Japan related mandatory quarantine. Which is in fact what happened except I can\u2019t make this claim now because the trip needs to start first before it can be interrupted (that was the actually inquiry and the answer). Plus I need to be in Japan first in order not to be able to go to Thailand \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Wouldn't mind getting stranded there so much, as long as we get there ok!",

We got full refunds from places that were non-refundable by writing and explaining concerns about lock downs. We got pretty much all of the non-refundables back on accommodation, that was 1.5 weeks ago, before Japan locked down Korea even, by writing to both hotel and [booking.com](https://booking.com).",

I guess the thing I\u2019m worried about the most is being quarantined coming back to the US after our trip to Japan. Has anyone dealt with this? Is it only if you show symptoms? I was talking to my mom about it and she said everyone coming back into the US from outside counties is being quarantined for 2 weeks which doesn\u2019t seem possible to me. How can ALL travelers be quarantined? What is your experience with this?",

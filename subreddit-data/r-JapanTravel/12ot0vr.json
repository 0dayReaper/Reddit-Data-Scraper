            "comment": "Although you have put very specific timings, I am sure from the very beginning your timings will be off:\n\nYou don't allow enough time to look around each place, and you're not considering the crowds. \n\nYou don't allow enough time to get to each place, especially figuring that you aren't exactly familiar with how to walk somewhere, how to move around in the station and which train to catch. Besides you are not going to be the only people on the street. Just navigating through the crowds of tourists is going to take time. Last Friday I was walking from A to B in Shinjuku, I can normally walk there in five minutes, but it took 15 because there were so many tourists around. \n\nYou are not taking into account the fact that you may not get into a restaurant or there might be a long line you have to wait in, or service might take longer than usual during busy times. Sure you can go somewhere else, but especially as vegetarians, it will take you longer to find an alternative place. \n\nI'm not going to comment on the specific places, but you should definitely have your Plan B where you have an idea what you're going to cut out each day to get you back on your schedule if that's what's important",

I have a back up in mind where I have highlighted four of the highest priority places each day, in the morning, afternoon, evening and night.\n\nIf any of the other places on the itinerary takes longer than expected, the idea is to skip some of the places and jump to next high priority place in the itinerary.\n\nAnother thing that I have done is to make reservations at most places that accepted it. The ones that do not, are the ones that I\u2019m willing to skip in case of unexpected delays.\n\nThanks u/DwarfCabochan appreciate the feedback :)",

Most of the areas had Indian Restaurants in abundance, which is why I chose them. \n\nOther good restaurants that I found were Uzu Ramen, Pigneto, Jade Room, CoCo Ichibanya which I have included.\n\nI had chosen Indian out of lack of options. Would love to hear what else can be tried. I searched most places have food made with broth that isn\u2019t vegetarian",

By all means have a list of stuff you want to do, but just take it as it comes. If you miss stuff because you\u2019re enjoying yourself too much, then that\u2019s how it is. Something to do in a future trip. Also, don\u2019t forget to keep an eye on when the last train leaves each day, or your \u201cExplore the arcade games at Namco until 12am\u201d might turn into \u201ccheck out a manga cafe until 5am\u201d\n\nSide note, if you\u2019re buying IC cards at Haneda, odds are you\u2019ll wind up with Pasmo cards rather than Suica. The two are (almost) completely interchangeable, so the difference is fairly academic, just letting you know so you don\u2019t get confused.",

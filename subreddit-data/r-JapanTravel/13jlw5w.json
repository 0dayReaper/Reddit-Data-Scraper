    "postText": "Hi y'all! My husband and I were married in October 2021 and had to put off our honeymoon in Japan until this summer. We're very excited about this opportunity, so I want to make sure we aren't being overly optimistic in our itinerary. We are equally interested in nerdy pursuits and cultural/historical sites. \n\nHere are our initial plans: \n\nTuesday, July 4\n\n* Land at Haneda at 4 p.m.\n* Check in at the hotel (Akihabara area)\n* Maybe visit a sento if we feel like it\n* Eat dinner and crash\n\nWednesday, July 5\n\n* AM: Yanaka Cemetery and the Shitamachi Museum\n* PM: Tokyo National Museum and dinner at the Vampire Cafe\n\nThursday, July 6\n\n* AM: Explore Akihabara\n* Lunch at Pokemon Cafe\n* PM: Open\n\nFriday, July 7\n\n* Shinkansen to Kyoto\n* Drop luggage at hotel in Central Kyoto\n* Nishiki Market\n* Our initial plan was to attend the Tanabata Festival at Jishu-Jinja, but it looks like the shine is closed for renovations this year. Does anyone know another Tanabata event celebrated on 7/7 in Kyoto?\n* Explore Ninnenzaka and Sannenzaka\n\nSaturday, July 8\n\n* Train to Nara\n* AM: Todaiji Temple\n* PM: Nara Deer Park\n* Train to Kyoto\n\nSunday, July 9\n\n* AM: Nijo Castle\n* PM: Kyoto Imperial Palace and Yokai Street\n\nMonday, July 10\n\n* AM (Leave before 7): Fushimi Inari\n* PM: Kennin-Ji temple \n\nTuesday, July 11\n\n* AM: Nanzen-Ji Temple Complex, Philosopher's Path\n* PM: Honen-In temple\n* Shinkansen back to Tokyo\n* Check in at hotel in Shinjuku\n\nWednesday, July 12\n\n* AM: Imperial Palace and Tokyo Station\n* PM: Shinjuku Station, 3D cat, Shin Godzilla statue\n* Night: Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, Omoide Yokocho\n\nThursday, July 13\n\n* AM: Meiji Jingu, explore Harajuku\n* PM: Visit Mega Don Quijote, see Shibuya Crossing at dusk\n* Night: Golden Gai or Kabukicho\n\nFriday, July 14\n\n* AM: Tokyo Skytree\n* PM: Denboin Street, Nakamise Street\n* Night: Kaminaron Gate, Sensoji Temple\n\nSaturday, July 15\n\n* AM: Sunshine City\n* PM: Otome Road\n\nSunday, July 16\n\n* Open\n\nMonday, July 17\n\n* AM: Studio Ghibli Museum\n* PM: Nakano Broadway\n\nTuesday, July 18\n\n* Open\n* Depart from Haneda at 5:45 pm\n\nDoes our schedule look realistic?\n\n  \nI am also interested in suggestions for where to see live music.

Maybe take the train to Osaka for the afternoon and hit up dotonbori for the evening. Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara are all close together by trains. You could get a quick taste of both nara and Osaka in one day.\n\n\n\nWhile in Kyoto, add in Renge\u014d-in (Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d) Temple. It will blow your mind.",

If you are actually a vegetarian (or vegan) food can be much tricker.  the Pokemon Cafe has very very little that is vegetarian and I think outside a few drinks nothing vegan.  The food is mediocre at best, I've gone multiple times, my tween is really into Pokemon.  We're trying to fancy tea set from the Strings and hoping the food quality is higher, but I think it is over before you arrive in Japan.\n\nMy tween loves T's tan tan ramen and would eat there most meals in Tokyo if I let her.  There are branches throughout Tokyo.  It is vegan.  If you allergies to sesame don't go!  I preferred Uzu ramen, also vegan.  We went to the one near Planets, but I hear there is one in Kyoto as well.  \n\nThe Ghibli Museum in Mitaka has nothing vegetarian except ice cream and maybe the french fries.  The new park in Nagoya seems to cater more for dietary restrictions.\n\nYou can look at Happy Cow to see what is out there for food.\n\nGood luck!",

We are heading there early to mid June and I tried to get one since my daughter likes Pokemon... But it completely booked up within 30 seconds of opening up.. at all three times it opens up (6pm just, 6:20pm just, 640pm just)... Which is literally 4am my local time \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI'm guessing they accept walk ins but there's no guarantee?",

It's trial and error but getting a spot for 2 people isn't too bad. It took me two days of getting up at the crack of dawn and refreshing over and over to make the reservations. My advice is don't try to reserve for more than 4 people at once (really limiting your options), 2 people is easiest, and refresh refresh refresh! I also got the reservations for the Osaka cafe rather than Tokyo.",

When visiting Yanaka cemetery I would visit Yanaka itself, which is a pretty cool area not so often frequented by foreign tourists \n\n2. Depends on your budget and interests, but I would spend less time in Tokyo and do a side trip - Koyasan near Osaka; Hakone, Kawaguchiko, Nikko or Kusatsu near Tokyo (preferably overnight).\n\n3. Not sure what is the goal of visiting Sunshine City, it's just a huge building, views are inferior compared to MG building or Shibuya Sky",

    "postText": "Mini-Trip Report in case it helps someone avoid disappointment.\n\nJust tried to go to Osaka aquarium today, May 4th at 2pm and it was an estimated 4 hour wait to get inside. I never even considered it would take that long. Every guide I saw said it would be very busy and crowded during golden week but that you only needed to allocate 2-3 hours for the entire excursion. \n\nNot posting this to complain, I just felt like I tried looking up info about the aquarium and would have liked to have seen a warning about the wait times being several hours long. So I\u2019m posting to report that is the case for anyone else trying to look into it.\n\nThe very kind staff also said they expect similar crowds tomorrow all day. \n\nI, and my group, planned our vacation poorly wish we did Osaka and Kyoto last week and Tokyo this week. Our fault .",

One full week was spent travelling in Hokkaido. I found it to be a lot more relaxed over there.\n\nI'm from Canada and our lifelong goal is to see much of the world. We dipped into Europe for the first time ever last year and spent a couple weeks in Spain. I can also see what you're talking about with the people having better relationships.

We didnt come in with any expectations and it was nice that the place was nearly empty, so this may have framed our experience.

We must have really hit the sweet spot because we hardly had any issues with crowds. And we did a very typical route (I recently posted a detailed trip report in 2 parts on this sub). Yes some instagram/blog recommended restaurants had crazy wait times but we just went somewhere else or if there was somewhere super hyped that we wanted to eat, we went at opening time to ensure a seat. I usually hate traveling during any destination\u2019s \u201chigh season\u201d, but I am so happy we went to Japan despite the crowd fear",

There were 2 restaurants we attempted and left bc of lines (Shin Udon in Tokyo and Sushi Taka in Kyoto- went back to Sushi Taka at opening the next day and was instantly seated).  Otherwise was not crowded (for us). Sorry that you had a negative experience though! We are early risers so maybe that helped, and I guess \u201ccrowds\u201d is relative so if you were there at the exact time we were and had crowd issues, I did not mean to offend or invalidate your opinion. Just posting this response because the reports I heard caused me significant anxiety before arriving in Japan (and it isnt like we could change things bc everything was booked) and I was pleasantly surprised",

The tourism was mostly domestic because they were offering incentives to citizens, but hardly any other tourists. It made the major tourist traps really stick out as those were the only super crowded places and the only places I saw more than a few foreigners. Plus the hotels were still so cheap. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to replicate that experience again.",

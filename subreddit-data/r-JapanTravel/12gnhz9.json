Since identity checks seem to be huge in Japanese events and concerts so I'm a bit worried that I might not be able to enter the venue if I get my tickets from them. \n\nWould definitely appreciate if anyone could share similar experiences or advice if they were in such situations too. :\")",

Though from personal experience a lot of the e-tickets are linked through the phone number/account, so curious how you'd get the ticket.\n\nThough if getting the actual ticket on your device is not an issue, the only time to worry is they use face reg, but otherwise you should be fine.",

I used them for a ticket lottery this week, and they won tickets for me, though I\u2019m starting to feel kind of concerned. I sent the money and was told they were purchasing the tickets on Monday. It\u2019s now Thursday and I\u2019ve sent two emails asking for confirmation/expected shipping time and they aren\u2019t answering at all. They\u2019ve been a little slow about communication this entire time to be honest but radio silence for three days after sending them a large amount of money has me worried I\u2019ve made a mistake.",

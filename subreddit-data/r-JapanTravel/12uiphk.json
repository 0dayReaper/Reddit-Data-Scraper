    "postText": "  Hi everyone!\n\nMy wife and I are traveling to Japan for our honeymoon a month from now and it\u2019ll be our first trip. I\u2019m both extremely excited and nervous at the same time.\n\nWe are going to treat this trip as if it\u2019ll be our only chance to go to Japan, so I\u2019m hoping to make the most of our days there. At the same time, it is our honeymoon, and we want to enjoy everything rather than spend the whole trip exhausted.\n\nHopefully we chose a good time between Golden Week and the rough summer weather. We live in Florida, so the humidity hopefully won\u2019t be too much of an issue. \n\nWe are in our early 30s and in pretty good shape, so walking shouldn\u2019t be an issue. We did purchase the JR Pass, so that\u2019ll help of course.\n\nMy wife is pescatarian, so we\u2019ve already printed out and laminated cards to have ready at restaurants. From what I\u2019ve read, eating pescatarian over there is significantly easier than vegetarian or vegan.\n\nHousing and transportation should be covered, but nothing is set for food other than trying everything. Raman, sushi, kushiyaki, okonomiyaki, etc.\n\nAs for general interests, we just really want to enjoy the culture and experiencing living in the country for a while. The wife is a big coffee drinker. I'd love to check out the nerdy things like Godzilla, retro video games, and some anime.\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nDay 1: May 22 - Arrival in Tokyo  \n\u00b7 Arrive at Haneda Airport (HND) at 3:25 PM JST  \n\u00b7 Activate Ubigi eSIM within the app  \n\u00b7 Obtain JR Pass using JR Pass Exchange Order voucher  \n\u00b7 Obtain Suica IC cards for each of us  \n\u00b7 Transfer to hotel, Grand Nikko Tokyo Bay Maihama  \n\u00b7 Grab dinner and explore the Ikspiari area\n\nDay 2: May 23 - Tokyo DisneySea  \n\u00b7 Arrive at Tokyo DisneySea by 8:00 AM  \n\u00b7 Return to hotel in Maihama for the evening\n\nDay 3: May 24 - Tokyo to Kyoto  \n\u00b7 Check out of the hotel and take Maihama Station to Tokyo Station  \n\u00b7 Take a shinkansen to Kyoto  \n\u00b7 Check into Kyoto Hotel  \n\u00b7 Visit Nijo Castle and the Kyoto Imperial Palace\n\nDay 4: May 25 \u2013 Kyoto (Hiroshima)  \n\u00b7 Day trip to Hiroshima  \n\u00b7 Take the ferry to Miyajima  \n\u00b7 Visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and Museum  \n\u00b7 Return to Kyoto for the evening\n\nDay 5: May 26 - Kyoto  \n\u00b7 Check in to Ryokan  \n\u00b7 Reserve private onsen bath  \n\u00b7 Explore the Fushimi Inari Shrine  \n\u00b7 Visit the Kiyomizu-dera temple\n\nDay 6: May 27 - Osaka  \n\u00b7 Check out of Ryokan and take train to Osaka  \n\u00b7 Check into Osaka Hotel  \n\u00b7 Explore the city  \n\u00b7 Shinsekai neighborhood  \n\u00b7 Jan Jan Yokocho arcade\n\nDay 7: May 28 - Osaka (Nara)  \n\u00b7 Take a day trip to Nara  \n\u00b7 Visit the Todai-ji temple and the Kasuga-taisha shrine  \n\u00b7 Return to Osaka for the evening\n\nDay 8: May 29 - Osaka  \n\u00b7 Visit the Osaka Castle  \n\u00b7 Umeda Sky Building  \n\u00b7 Shitennoji Buddhist temple   \n\u00b7 Explore the Dotonbori area\n\nDay 9: May 30 - Tokyo  \n\u00b7 Take a shinkansen back to Tokyo  \n\u00b7 Check into the Shinjuku Airbnb  \n\u00b7 Explore Shibuya  \n\u00b7 Visit the Hachiko Monument  \n\u00b7 Take in the view from the Shibuya Sky observation deck at Miyashita Park\n\nDay 10: May 31 - Shibuya  \n\u00b7 Shibuya Crossing   \n\u00b7 Shibuya Parco Mall  \n\u00b7 Uobei Sushi conveyor belt  \n\u00b7 Visit Senso-Ji temple  \n\u00b7 Visit the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\u2019s 45th floor observation deck\n\nDay 11: June 1 - Harajuku  \n\u00b7 Visit Harajuku  \n\u00b7 Visit the mini pig caf\u00e9 (make appointment)  \n\u00b7 Yoyogi Park  \n\u00b7 Meiji Shrine behind Harajuku station  \n\u00b7 Takeshita Street\n\nDay 12: June 2 - Shinjuku  \n\u00b7 Nakano Broadway at Sun City Mall  \n\u00b7 Check out Godzilla on the top of the Gracery Hotel/Toho cinema building  \n\u00b7 Golden Gai vs Omoide Yokocho?\n\nDay 13: June 3 - Asakusa and Akihabara  \n\u00b7 Check into Akihabara Hotel  \n\u00b7 Explore TeamLab Planets (make reservation)  \n\u00b7 Red Tokyo Tower (VR Center)  \n\u00b7 Visit Akihabara  \n\u00b7 Explore Super Potato  \n\u00b7 Visit mAAch ecute Kanda Manseibashi\n\nDay 14: June 4 - Departure from Tokyo  \n\u00b7 Store luggage in the lobby and check out of the hotel  \n\u00b7 Visit Asakusa and check out the Tokyo Skytree  \n\u00b7 Visit the Sensoji Temple  \n\u00b7 Pick up the luggage from the hotel and head to Haneda Airport by 2:30 PM  \n\u00b7 Depart from Tokyo at 6:25 PM JST and head back home",

And luckily, we land in Japan relatively early on the 22nd, so we'll make sure to get plenty of sleep that day.\n\nThanks for the heads up!",

Give yourself a few easy days after arrival while you recover from the flights and adjust to the time zone.\n\nIt probably would be better to do your day trip to Hiroshima from Osaka, as the train trip there will be a bit shorter. I'd suggest playing with different options in Google Maps or similar.\n\nChanging hotels in cities is usually a waste of time. Remember that it takes time to pack up your room, check out, travel to the new hotel, check in, and unpack your luggage.",

Hopefully it won't be too much of an issue.\n\nAs for Hiroshima, I know it means something different to a lot of people, but how worthwhile would you consider the stop and is it possible to do as a day trip?\n\nThanks again!",

I've been there in the afternoon, sunset and night. The lines get crazy. It's an  easy process on their website, but it looks like you can only purchase a week in advance. I'd also check the weather, so if it's a nice day, you'll even see Mount Fuji!",

            "comment": "I found Nara to be a snooze, particularly the deer park.  OTOH, I thought Tsurumi Ryokuchi park in Osaka was wonderful, but that's just me. If you're a fan of okonomiyaki, Kiji in the basement of the Umeda Sky is excellent. \n\nIMO, you're trying to do too much with the Peace Memorial Museum AND Miyajima on the same day, especially as a day trip from Kyoto.\n\nFirst of all, Hiroshima is a 2-hour train trip from Kyoto. That's 4 hours of just travel, roundtrip. The Peace memorial is 10-20 minute ride/walk from Hiroshima Station. To use your JR Pass to get to Miyajima, you have to take a 30 minute train from Hiroshima to Miyajimaguchi, then a ferry to Miyajima. That's a lot of backing and forthing, but if you're young and energetic, go for it.\n\nSecondly, I just got back from Japan and both Hiroshima and Miyajima were insanely crowded. We stayed overnight on Miyajima and I can tell you, the difference between early morning before the tourists arrive and midday, is night and day. Getting up early and taking the ferry will yield you the opportunity to experience some tranquility, otherwise forget it. \n\nI'm ambivalent about the Peace Memorial Museum. On one hand, it's an important milestone in the course of civilization and should be given the time and respect it deserves. On the other hand, it's quite large and attracts huge crowds, including tour groups and school groups and you end up shuffling along with (largely unmasked) crowds, and are unable to spend a significant amount of time at any one exhibit and you'll be jostled and jabbed.",

On one hand, it's our honeymoon and we shouldn't go anywhere \"just because\". But at the same time, I'm afraid of FOMO.\n\nMaybe we'll just play that part of the trip by ear, see how we're feeling and decide if we want to just stay in Kyoto for the day.",

Let your moods decide how much or how little to do on any given day. \n\nI know you\u2019re going to have a wonderful time and a memorable honeymoon, how I envy your youth.",

The current crowds in the area are due in part because of interest in the city in the lead up to the G7. You'll be visiting right after the G7 finishes so it should be much quieter. \n\nI would rearrange your day in Hiroshima however, the Peace Museum and surrounding sights tend to close early in the day so I would visit those first. Also from the Peace museum there is a direct ferry to Miyajima, which makes transportation to the island easy. Miyajima Island never closes and the last ferry leaves close to 11pm so time is less of a restraint on the island, plus the sunset behind Itsukushima Shrine is beautiful if you stay late enough to catch it.",

    "postText": "Hey there! \nMy partner and I will be on Lake Nojiri (Nagano) for a few days, and I saw that you can rent a small boat (2 people) for fishing and going around the lake.\n\nI understand that locals often come and rent a boat, however they need their boat licence (recreational Skipper's Licence) to get one. \n\nI have an Australian Skipper's ticket, and was wondering if it was possible to use it in Japan, or have some sort of transfer done?\n\nOr, perhaps I misunderstood and I don't need a licence. Thanks in advance!",

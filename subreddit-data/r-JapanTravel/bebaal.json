    "postText": "Hey everyone, I just got back from my trip and wanted to share a rant (?) that happened in Kyoto. \n\nKyoto was amazing by the way, my friends and I were walking down Gion after our tea ceremony (Camellia Flower Tea Ceremony if you were interested). The streets were really crowded but it was expected because of cherry blossom season and well...it was Kyoto. Tons of tourists were dressed in beautiful kimono and we enjoyed looking through the fun stores. \n\nSuddenly there was a huge commotion in the crowd I was attempting to navigate through, I turned around to see what everyone was gawking at and was immediately smacked straight across the face with a selfie stick someone was wielding. The lady noticed but completely ignored me and basically launched herself at a poor geisha that was speed walking to her destination. She kept her head down and politely asked people to let her pass, but these blood thirsty tourists went as far as to blocking her path to get a picture and the selfie stick lady grabbed onto her sleeve and begged in broken Japanese for a picture. The poor geisha politely declined and as she basically ran off, a hoard of tourists chased after her with their cameras, phones, and children. It was like watching a scene from the Walking Dead, my friends and I watched the whole scene in complete shock. I had a nice sized knot on my head from the selfie stick, but I was more bothered by how the young woman was treated. \n\nNow for the tip which may seem obvious, please leave the geishas alone when you\u2019re in Kyoto. Some are able to stop and take pictures, but many are trying to get to classes and all the tourists slowing them down can cause a major inconvenience to them. If you see a geisha, politely ask for a picture and respect her space if she declines. They are doing their jobs and as visitors, we must keep in mind that many of them are young and a hoard of strangers grabbing at them is terrifying. Japan is a wonderful place to visit, let\u2019s just keep it peaceful and fun for the people living there too.",

I feel sorry for those poor geishas. I get that the sight of a geisha is wonderful especially to those of another culture, but they aren't some statue you can take a picture with whenever...for the rest I hope you had great fun in Kyoto!",

No one blocked their path from what i could tell, but it must suck to be constantly bombarded like that. I didn't even get a photo. I was just like...'hmm, neat'.

When you visit a shrine, please ask first and do not take pictures of the monks and especially not the shrine girls who are often students or family of the owner without asking first. Don't touch the statues and such unless you are supposed to. They also said that even Japanese people will often break a twig off the cherry trees or take some flowers before they have fallen during cherry blossom viewing season and at festivals without thinking how it damages the old trees so it is not just foreigners. Please come to Kyoto politely because it is wonderful!",

In my honest opinion, I hate them and wish they didn't even exist.\n\nI've heard some horror stories of maiko and geiko getting harassed in Kyoto. Some of the maiko also wear tall geta called okobo that are difficult to run in, so if people chase a maiko while she is wearing them, she risks falling and hurting herself. Also, those kimono and accessories are tens of thousands of dollars and some are quite old. People risk damaging them if they grab them. So yes, just leave them alone, especially if they look like they're in a hurry.",

However, if she's not in a hurry and you have your camera out and she looks receptive, then it's fine to ask. Also, it's best not to stop her in crowded areas, as it invites a mob to start taking pictures, too.

I just came back from Kyoto recently and definitely noticed that there\u2019s a lot more tourists there that seem to not care!\n\nFor example, a friend of mine saw a large sign that asked visitors to not litter and under it written in English was something along the lines of \u201cmaybe if you put some f***ing trash cans.\u201d It\u2019s crazy how inconsiderate some tourists can be considering what a beautiful place they\u2019re visiting!",

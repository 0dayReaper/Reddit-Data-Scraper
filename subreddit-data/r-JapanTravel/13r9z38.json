    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI just finished a solo cycle trip across Japan; travelling from Sapporo to Fukuoka which required just over 2000km of riding.\n\nI started on the 5th April and finished on the 22nd May (with various rest days and just over a week off for Golden Week).\n\nHere is the route I took with a short summary of what it was like:\n\n1. Sapporo \u2192 Kojohama: Quite a long route with a steady incline towards Chitose. I didn't realise that Noboribetsu was a bit further but since it was my first day cycling, missed out this time as I went straight to the hotel to rest.\n2. Kojohama \u2192 Toyako: Pretty hilly ride with the last part heading into Lake Toya being the hardest part (especially if you've been cycling all day).\n3. Toyako \u2192 Yakumo: Probably the most mountainous route of the trip with series of tunnels and windy roads. Not much to do in Yakumo besides some bars and snack bars.\n4. Yakumo \u2192 Hakodate: Straight forward but mainly along the highway. If you choose to take the bullet train to Aomori, you don't need to go into Hakodate city. But if you proceed to the port, make sure to carb-load at [Lucky Pierrot](https://luckypierrot.jp/en) once you're in the city!\n5. Aomori \u2192 Odate: I went via Hirosaki to check out the cherry blossoms near the castle. It was relatively flat until the last mountain into Odate. Look out for cute Akita dogs at the [Akita Dog Museum.](https://akitainu-hozonkai.com/)\n6. Odate \u2192 Noshiro: Nothing but a highway and an uninteresting route.\n7. Noshiro \u2192 Akita: [Nanohana Road](https://www.akita-tourism.com/member/index/sakura04/en) is really nice to check out if you're there during the cherry blossom season. I also went via Oga to look at the [giant statues](https://oganavi.com/spot/94/).\n8. Akita \u2192 Yurihonjo: A nice coastal route. Unfortunately I couldn't find much to do in Yurihonjo.\n9. Yurihonjo \u2192 Sakata: Pretty chill ride. The [TDK Museum](https://www.tdk.com/museum/en/) is worth checking out if you don't mind a slight detour.\n10. Sakata \u2192 Murakami: Another coastal route. The [Kamo Aquarium](http://kamo-kurage.jp/) with a large collection of jellyfish was worth checking out.\n11. Murakami \u2192 Niigata: A really nice coastal route again. Was looking forward to CoCo Ichibanya Curry (couldn't find it since Sapporo). Also did some [sake tasting](https://www.ponshukan.com/en/) at the train station.\n12. Niigata \u2192 Kashiwazaki:  A coastal route but once arriving in Kashiwazaki, I couldn't find much to do.\n13. Kashiwazaki \u2192 Joetsu: A coastal route where you'll see some power plants along the way. If you don't mind pushing your bike up a massive incline, there's a nice [scenic spot](https://www.koibitomisaki-niigata.jp/).\n14. Joetsu \u2192 Itoigawa: [The Kubiki Cycling route](https://discover-itoigawa.com/see-do/places-events/kubiki-cycling-road/) is really nice. You'll need to catch a train at the end (see below).\n15. Asahi \u2192 Toyama: The [Toyama Bay Cycling](https://www.mlit.go.jp/road/bicycleuse/good-cycle-japan/national_cycle_route/toyama-bay_en.html) course is really nice. You'll pretty much stick to this until you get to Toyama City (you'll need to divert off the course to head into town).\n16. Toyama \u2192 Kanazawa: [Takaoka Buddha](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7530.html) is worth checking out if you don't mind a slight detour.\n17. Kanazawa \u2192 Fukui: I headed straight towards there. However, this had a really narrow and long tunnel I had to cycle through. I wasn't mentally prepared but got through it but left me quite scared of tunnels.\n18. Fukui \u2192 Tsuruga: I headed west to the coast via Echizen as heading directly south would be a mountainous and more risky route. Though once you're about to hit Tsuruga, you'll need to go on the highway.\n19. Tsuruga \u2192 Makino: Just one big mountain. I had to push my bike up a fair bit unfortunately.\n20. Makino \u2192 Kyoto: The [Lake Biwa course](https://www.mlit.go.jp/road/bicycleuse/good-cycle-japan/national_cycle_route/biwaichi_en.html) is really nice but you'll not be besides the lake the entire time and the route is also part of the highway. Once you get to Otsu, it's pretty hilly towards Kyoto. I actually got lost behind Kiyomizu-dera (Google Maps had no idea where it was lol) and had to go around but eventually got to where I needed to go.\n21. Kyoto \u2192 Kobe: Via Osaka Castle. The route from Kyoto to Osaka is pretty straight forward with a bike path most of the way. However, there are many annoying barriers you'll need to get past. You'll need to get off your bike and walk through them. However since I had big bags, I had to lift them over (which was really hard). Once you get to Osaka, cycling to Kobe is pretty straight forward as well and you'll be in the city the whole time.\n22. Kobe \u2192 Himeji: [Akashi Bridge](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3559.html) is an amazing sight to behold. Otherwise, a nice coastal route.\n23. Himeji \u2192 Kurashiki:  A pretty long one but straight forward as well. You can go via Okayama and check out the castle.\n24. Kurashiki \u2192 Onomichi: Took it easy before [Shimanami Kaido](https://www.mlit.go.jp/road/bicycleuse/good-cycle-japan/national_cycle_route/shimanami_en.html) as there wasn't much to see besides some ports.\n25. Onomichi \u2192 Omishima (Shimanami Kaido): One of my favourite cycling routes. Took some of the Island Explorer courses. Had a nice [burger](https://burgergoroken.com/) and stopped at the [Cyclist Sanctuary](https://www.skr.mlit.go.jp/kikaku/88-kei/en/scenery/58_ehime.html) to take lots of photos and stayed there for the night.\n26. Omishima \u2192 Imabari (Shimanami Kaido): Unfortunately it was raining so headed straight to Imabari via the main course by following the blue line.\n27. Imabari \u2192 Matsuyama: Pretty chill route with lots of people cycling when I was there. Nice pit stops along the way.\n28. Hiroshima \u2192 Iwakuni: Stopped by [Miyajima](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3401.html) along the way. Otherwise, pretty straight forward ride. [Kintai Bridge](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6177.html) was worth checking out as well where there's a small shop that sells many flavours of ice cream.\n29. Iwakuni \u2192 Hikari: Follow the coast towards Hikari. You can go straight for a shorter route but the coast is much nicer.\n30. Hikari \u2192 Hofu: Stick along the coast. It gets hilly around Heta. [Hofu Tenmangu](https://www.visit-jy.com/en/spots/14780) was a nice shrine to visit.\n31. Hofu \u2192 Ube: There really wasn't much in Ube. A bit of air pollution to be honest. Though I did sleep in a [shipping container](https://hotel-r9.jp/hotels/ube/).\n32. Ube \u2192 Kitakyushu: Stop by Shimonoseki along the way. [Karato Market](https://www.karatoichiba.com/) has lots of fresh sushi and seafood. To get across to Kyushu, you'll need to pay a 20\u00a5 toll fee which you put into a box. Take the lift down to the [Kanmon Tunnel](https://www.visit-jy.com/en/spots/10471) and you'll need to walk your bike across. Once you're on the other side, take the lift up and ride towards Kokura which was a bit hilly.\n33. Kitakyushu \u2192 Fukuoka: Pretty hilly towards Fukuoka. But at this point, I just rode straight into the city, found my hotel and went to bed.\n\nAlong the route, there were some parts where I could not ride my bike. Here is the list of options I took:\n\n* **Hakodate \u2192 Aomori:** I took the [ferry](https://www.tsugarukaikyo.co.jp/global/en/) at Hakodate Port to Aomori Port. I arrived at the port and went to the ticket office to reserve my spot and my bike.\n* **Itoigawa \u2192 Asahi:** From Itoigawa to Asahi (which is near the border between Niigata and Toyama prefecture), the road is narrow and windy with lots of tunnels and traffic. However, there is the option to take the [Cycle Train](https://www.echigo-tokimeki.co.jp/information/detail?id=1610) where you can bring your bike on the train without having to pack it up. It is around 300\u00a5 for the bike plus the cost of the ticket.\n* **Onomichi \u2192 Mukashima:** To start the Shimanami Kaido, you will need to take a boat to the first island of Mukaishima. It will cost around 100\u00a5. There are three points you can take it from in Onomichi.\n* **Matsuyama \u2192 Hiroshima:** I took the [ferry](https://setonaikaikisen.co.jp/language/en/cruise/) to Hiroshima as that was the route I wanted to take. You will need to take the standard ferry option as the speed boat option will not allow you to bring on the bike (unless you have a foldable bike).\n* **Miyajima:** I decided to check out Miyajima along the way from Hiroshima to Iwakuni by cycling to Miyajimaguchi Station and taking the JR boat to the island. You will need to pay an extra 100\u00a5 or so to bring the bike on the boat.\n\n# Preparations\n\n* I am in my mid-30s and work in an IT office job and I don't really cycle often back home besides commuting from A to B. I didn't really train or prepare for this cycle either (due to time constraints of work) though I would say I have an average level of fitness. In hindsight, I should have done some practice to ensure I was prepared physically for long-endurance rides.\n* I bought my own road bike from Australia. I flew with Japan Airlines (from Melbourne to Narita) which allow 2x 23kg checked in luggage. I called them to tell them I would bring the bike and they were able to confirm a spot for the bike (as oversized luggage). As the total dimensions was under 240cm allowed for oversized luggage and under the weight limit, they didn't charge me extra.\n* For the cycle, I had two pannier bags, a duffel bag, a backpack and a bumbag. I bought a pannier rack of Amazon which I could clamp onto my road bike (as it couldn't attach the ones you normally buy from bike stores). In total, I was carrying around 25kgs of luggage on my bike.\n* Once I arrived in Japan, I didn't want to carry my bike around Tokyo for a few days (wanted to hang around Tokyo to see friends and I was also flying out of Haneda) so I sent it via courier with [JAL ABC](https://www.jalabc.com/en/hands-freetravel/airport-baggage-delivery/to-the-airport.html) (just outside the terminal). Note the other delivery services (e.g. Yamato, etc) won't deliver your luggage if it is over a certain size. It is also quite expensive to do so though so if you plan ahead, you can check it in as oversized luggage with domestic airlines. It is a first-come-first-serve kind of thing so you will need to go to the airport ahead of time and check it in otherwise, they will ask you to find an alternative option (at least this is what JAL Domestic will do).\n* In terms of a data sim, I used [Sakura Mobile](https://www.sakuramobile.jp/travel/) which had coverage pretty much the entire time I was riding. The only times it would drop out was when I was in a remote location (e.g. on the coast) or in a long tunnel.\n* The route itself was me seeing a map of Japan and putting in the cities town I wanted to travel through and making sure there were accommodation options using Booking.com and Google Maps. On the day, I open Google Maps, set the destination via walking and follow the dotted line while making my own decisions on whether to divert from it to either go down a quieter street, see something interested that appeared on Google Maps, etc.\n* Have an emergency/back-up mobile phone. I use an Android phone mostly but have a iPhone as a backup (it remains off in my bag and I don't really use it). If you have an iPhone in Japan, you're pretty likely to get it fixed at a repair shop. However from my experience, getting Android phones fixed is much, much harder.\n\n# Learnings\n\nI thought I would share some learnings (some of them are very obvious but I hope you will find them useful)\n\n* Japan is (unsurprisingly) very hilly. I'm from Australia where it is generally flat most parts. However, riding across Japan you will face many sudden inclines and hills.\n* If you're travelling in smaller towns and the countryside, a lot of people do not speak English. Be prepared to use Google Lens or speak Japanese.\n* Along the route, there are many picturesque places to see along the coast, fields, mountains, etc. However most of the time, you will be riding through cities, towns, highways, etc.\n* Be prepared for unpleasant smells (e.g. manure in the fields, farmers burning crops, car/truck fumes in tunnels, etc).\n* The roads in the countryside are not well maintained with many cracks and pot holes on the roads and footpaths. You will need to be vigilant on the road to avoid any punctures.\n* In the countryside, there are convenient stores but not as many as you would find in urban areas. Plan your route ahead and make sure you're well supplied.\n* Note that if you're in the middle of nowhere (i.e. in between towns, cities), you're really on your own. So it would help to know first-aid and how to fix a puncture.\n* Getting my bike serviced, cleaned, tuned, etc once I was in a town or city was pretty easy. I simply put \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u4fee\u7406 into Google Maps and would find various options.\n* Most bike shops will be able to help you. However in my experiences, a few did not have experience with road bikes as they only dealt with mama-charis.\n* In my experience, if a bike repair shop is too far away, a bike rental shop will help you if you're after a quick pump or something quick.\n* Once you're in a smaller town, meal options will be limited. You will need to resort to going to a convenient store for dinner. Restaurant options are limited and you will most likely need a reservation.\n\n# Accommodation\n\n* I booked mainly cheap business hotels and hostels/guesthouses every night. I booked ahead of time based on the itinerary above. As it was a solo trip, I didn't want to camp alone nor deal with the hassle of reserving campsites ahead of time.\n* All the accommodations were able to safely store and secure my bike. I would send them a message in Japanese notifying them I would be bringing a bike and they were really helpful. They would either allow me to store it in their staff/guest parking area, somewhere near the front desk where I would lock it or even bring it into my room (though it would be cramp but it allowed me to prepare for the next day easily).\n\n# Navigation\n\n* I mainly used Google Maps to help me along the route. Most of the time, I would use the \"Walking\" route and follow along the line. However, I use it as a guide rather than following it directly as at some points, it will make you go down people's private properties, dirt roads, etc. Use your instincts and look around or ahead on Google Maps to see if there are options to progress forward.\n* If you want to know if a route will be hilly, set the starting point to somewhere ahead of where you are located and the destination where you will be heading. There should be a \"Preview\" button which will show the elevation of the route.\n* The \"Cycle\" option on Google Maps only works in some prefectures. I only saw it work in Osaka and Fukuoka.\n* I tried various cycling map apps (even tried the premium version of some that offered free trials) but found them not to be useful.\n\n# Safety\n\n* ***Always wear your helmet.***\n* Most of the time, I did not feel like I was in any danger. Though I have had experience riding next to cars and trucks so if you haven't done it before, it would be worth getting use to it.\n* Most of the times, vehicles will proactively avoid you on the road if you're riding in the far left of the lane.\n* Avoid riding at night in the countryside as the roads are poorly lit (some cases, none at all). If you must, make sure you are visible and have a sufficient light source while riding.\n* If there is a narrow road, vehicles will slow down behind you and overtake in the oncoming lane if it is safe to do so. However if I notice there is a lot of oncoming traffic, I would pull over and hug the left of the road to allow them to pass to not hold anyone up.\n* The most dangerous situation I was in was riding in extremely long and narrow tunnels as the vehicles will come extremely close to you while they are overtaking. Most of the time, there will be a footpath for pedestrians which may be on either side of the road. Back-tracking and crossing to the footpath in this scenario is highly recommended. If this is not the case, make sure you are visible (lights, high-vis gear, etc) while in the tunnel and always ride with the traffic.\n* Throughout the entire trip, I would leave my bike and all my bags that were strapped to the bike outside of convenient stores and restaurants (in the parking area if available); ensuring not to block any entrances, people, vehicles, etc. I had a U-lock which I would use to lock the back-tire with the frame. Nothing was ever stolen and I had no issues.\n* Be wary of the elderly (pedestrians and drivers). I always slow down when I approach an elderly walking on the footpath as they made suddenly stop or move into the middle of the path. With drivers, always make eye-contact if you're approaching an intersection or crossing. Even if you have the right of way, sometimes drivers will just drive through.\n* Be aware of other cyclists (especially in the cities). You will see many cyclists doing the wrong thing (e.g. talking on phones, wearing headphones/earphones, not wearing helmets, waiving through people, etc). It's quite unpredictable how they will move so if you're heading towards another cyclist and they're on the footpath, slow down and make sure there's enough room.\n\nI hope this report will help others who are looking to cycle across Japan in the future. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them in the comments.\n\nI will also continue to edit this post with more information and links that I found useful.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you very much for reading my post. :)",

I live over in Ishikawa (not far from Kanazawa!) and I'm an avid cyclist. I race on the road for a team here in Japan, and one day I want to ride the length of the country like this. \n\nThe tunnels in Japan really are no joke. Thankfully a lot of them don't have too much traffic, but there are some wild ones for sure where you're in there for 3+ kilometers. It's my wife's least favorite part of riding here. \n\nDo you happen to know the exact dimensions of our bike when you were flying with it? We had a friend visit recently and JAL (and Yamato) refused his box. He's \\~195cm tall and rides a XXL... I think his bike was oversized luggage. My wife and I are both shorter and have bike bags that are under 200cm so we have shipped with Yamato. I was surprised when my buddy got denied at both. \n\nIn the future you should look into a service like Strava if you've haven't heard of it. They have a global heatmap feature that lets you see where other cyclists ride their bikes. It's very handy for planning routes through areas you don't know much about.",

I also went down to my local bike store in Australia and they gave me a box to put it in for extra protection. Wrapped some bubble wrap around it and it was good to go.",

Stayed vigilant and everything was all good.",

Two years ago it was very early, then last year it was pretty dry.  \n\nI feel like so much of the \"unsafe\" thing is about how Japanese people are with biking.  Apparently all Japanese kids take a safety lesson at school and then promptly forget everything.  Ignoring stop signs, barreling through intersections, never looking at the side streets when riding by, etc..  And of course no helmets... I ride my bicycle to get around our city and I'm always watching what's going on because just so many walkers, bikers and drivers seem to have zero awareness of their surroundings.",

With these services in Japan, you will be able to get help from them and stuff but I'm not too familiar with all the options available.\n\nRoad bike is definitely better if you're looking to cover the distance but with the many potholes, cracks in the road (especially on countryside roads), you will be looking at the road a lot to ensure you don't get punctures. There were even some points where I had to backtrack or walk my bike as the road turned into a gravel road with little warning.\n\nWith the gravel bike, you'll go slower but you won't have to worry as much about a lot of the above.\n\nEDIT: If you are also looking for a route, you could do Tokyo to Wakayama via the [Pacific Cycling Route](https://www.mlit.go.jp/road/bicycleuse/good-cycle-japan/national_cycle_route/pacific_en.html) then work your way to Hiroshima via a similar itinerary to mine.",

    "postText": "Thanks to the lovely u/Chexis I had a wonderful time today. He offered to hang out for the day after I was rattled and walk me home after New Years. We went to the Pok\u00e9mon Center in Ikibukuro, had some great food, and a great kick off to 2020!\n\nI also found a few new routes to my hotel that feel a lot safer and I\u2019ll be taking those from now on. Thanks for everyone who chimed in with helpful advice, words of encouragement, or help. This subreddit has been wonderful and I\u2019m so glad I found it, happy new year everyone!",

Even though Japan is super-safe that doesn't mean there's ZERO chance of problems!",

This old guy came up to me and told me I was cute, and tried to put his arm in mine. But I yelled in Japanese \"Get away from me you old pervert!\" and he said \"gomen nasai\". LOL. It would not surprise me if he makes a habit of this. Did you go to the police? I wouldn't blame you if you didn't since they often don't give a shit about things like this, but at the same time, I really wish the crime stats on such things were more accurate. :(",

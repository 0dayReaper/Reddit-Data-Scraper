    "postText": "It was a long trip. This is a long post.  Apologies in advance.\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS (Days 1-14 of 28)**  \n**KYOTO**\\--**Kiyomizu** temple; **Nanzenji** temple; **Nijo Castle**; **Sanjusangendo** temple; **Shugakuin** Imperial Villa;  **Kinkakuji** (Golden Pavilion); **Fushimi Inari** shrine; 184th Kamogawa-Odori **geisha show**  \n**HIMEJI**\\-The **castle and garden**.  \n**NARA**\\-**Todaiji** temple  \n**UJI**\\-**Byodoin** temple  \n**IZU KOGEN**\\--**Jogasaki Coast** nature trail\n\nTOKYO, Monday 5/8\n\nWe arrived mid-afternoon at Tokyo/Haneda, right after Golden Week ended. It turned out to be, coincidentally, the day when the Japanese government officially downgraded the Covid pandemic to the level of a seasonal flu.\n\nFresh off a 13-hour flight and experiencing Japan for the first time, we went from touchdown to hotel check-in in something like 90 minutes, braving an almost-rush-hour crush on the Keikyu Line train from the Terminal 3 station.  \n\nExperience has taught us that meticulously planning every step of arrival in a new country is crucial to avoiding confusion, getting lost or simply wasting time.\n\nPre-loaded Suica cards on our smartphones led us straight to the train without standing in any lines.\n\nWe' chose the Shinagawa Station area of central Tokyo to spare our jetlagged selves another leg of indeterminate length--four or five hours at least--to reach our Kyoto base. Shinagawa is a straight shot--no transfers--from Haneda and a great place to catch a bullet train.\n\nIt was a geezer move that gave us plenty of time to familiarize ourselves with the layout and operation of one of Japan's busiest train stations. \n\nBefore crashing for the night, we'd taken care of some business by getting cash from an ATM and picking up reserved seat tickets for a post-Kyoto leg. We used a JR Railway ticket machine to print out the tickets, using QR codes emailed to us the previous month when we bought the tickets online directly from JR-East railway (we avoided costly middlemen in all our travel and entertainment purchases, something that requires planning but is easily doable from abroad).  Like all our electronic machine transactions in Japan, there was an English language option on the touch-screen.\n\nA machine also checked us in at the Prince Hotel Shinagawa, part of a modern high-rise development, chosen mainly for convenience. It's a one-block walk from the train station and was perfect for a couple jet-lagged Japan newbies. What we got, for the princely sum of $116 USD, was a spacious (by Japan standards) room on the 34th floor with a dead-on view of Tokyo Tower. Dinner was carryout sushi from the Queen's Isetan department store on the opposite side of the station, plus beer and sake from a convenience store, all consumed in the hotel room with Tokyo's skyline at our feet.\n\nKYOTO , Tuesday 5/9\n\nOn the advice of an old Japan hand, we made Kyoto our base for the first two weeks. It worked well. We explored a fabulous city, took three day trips (Himeji/Osaka; Nara; Uji) and left town wishing we'd had time for more.\n\nWe expected our first full day to be a blur, due to jetlag, but it wasn't too bad. Following advice from this sub for first-time shinkansen travelers, we got to the station an hour early.\n\nWe bought far enough in advance on the Smart EX app to get a slight discount. We booked back row seats on the right-hand side for easy luggage storage but discovered that both our bags (including my larger one, which measures 142 cm \\[L+H+W\\]) also fit on the overhead rack.  We never had luggage problems on trains during our trip.\n\nOur train to Kyoto had great Fuji views, our first. After depositing the bags in a Kyoto station storage locker (rented with the smartphone Suica card), we made our first sightseeing stop: Toji Temple, a quick subway ride and walk away.  \n\n**About picking hotels**\n\nWe used triangulation to pick hotels; that is, cross-checking information from various sources to give us the best possible chance of getting a good place at a decent price. Sources included a handful of   guidebooks from the public library, Trip Advisor and this sub.\n\nSolaria Nishitetsu Hotel Kyoto Premier ($221 USD per night with massive breakfast buffet, best of the trip) turned out to be a great base.  We paid extra for a room facing the Kamo River, a popular gathering spot for locals, tourists and joggers. We benefited from early booking (more than six months in advance, shortly after Japan began opening up).  Inflation and other factors have since raised the price of the same room by about 10 percent.\n\nThe newish (opened in 2017) hotel attracts mainly Japanese/Asian travelers who, like me, enjoyed the onsen in the basement. We also put the coin-operated washer/dryers to good use.\n\nKYOTO, Wednesday 5/10\n\nUp and out, thanks to jetlag, shortly after 5 a.m., walking deserted streets to the foot of magical Kiyomizu temple, arriving just as it opened at 6 a.m.  We were back at the hotel for breakfast by 8, after walking down the picturesque, cobbled streets of Sannenzaka, shops still closed, with more tourists starting to trickle in. \n\n**About choosing sightseeing spots**\n\nI'm a sucker for ratings, assuming they're done well.  So, guidebook must-sees, like DK Eyewitness's or Lonely Planet's,  star ratings in the Michelin Green Guide to Japan or in the downloaded Gateway to Japan guide (a steal at $10 and in your pocket for free on Kindle app)  and, finally, Japan Guide's recommendations helped guide our steps.\n\nThat's how we ended up spending the afternoon at Nanzenji, a must-see Zen temple, which, like Kiyomizu, is laid out at the foot of the mountains east of town.\n\nLunch this day was at Junsei, a yudofo (boiled tofu) restaurant we stumbled onto near the temple. We used wooden sticks to skim the surface of an iron vat filled with simmering soy milk, that was set before us over a gas flame.\n\n**About finding restaurants**\n\nIf you've never been to Japan but lurk on this sub, you've already heard that it's practically impossible to get a bad meal.  We booked a handful of places before leaving home but agree with others that you rarely need to do that to eat well. If you're determined to hit a place that's highly popular, often with deep-pocketed foreign tourists, reservations may be required.\n\nWe're foodies, up to a point, but Japan's profusion of starred Michelin restaurants was wasted on us. We've learned over the years that we seldom enjoy paying the inflated cost. Over four weeks, we ate once at a Michelin one-star, chosen for other reasons.\n\nThat said, Michelin's Bib Gourmands (good, affordable restaurants) never disappointed us.  They are plentiful in Japan, especially in Kyoto and Tokyo, and worth seeking out. Most of the time, though, we picked places to eat by cross-checking Google (asking for \"soba noodles\" near me, for example) and Tabelog, the indispensible crowd-sourced Japanese website (we looked for places in the 3.5 range).\n\nNon-speakers of Japanese can have a hard time making reservations.  We found that we could make them in advance from abroad through services like TableCheck (and an apparently expanding number of others aimed at tourists, usually charging a fee; sometimes small, sometimes steep). On the ground in Japan, we sometimes reserved for free through Google and Tabelog (at random places which you can find on Google or Tabelog restaurant listings);  they were always honored. We also asked hotel reception desks for reservation help on occasion. We went to a couple restaurants in person and booked a table for later.  But the easiest and often best way to get in is simply to arrive on the early side for lunch (by 11:30 or so) or dinner (between 5 and 5:30). More than once, we walked right into a place and were seated, only to discover lots of people waiting in line outside when we left.  That said, if you're looking for an above-average meal on a Saturday night, especially in a popular location, you might want to book in advance.\n\nKonbinis (convenience stores) are cheap, good and extremely reliable sources of takeout.  And though we liked what we got there (mainly onigiri), we wound up relying on them less and less as the trip went along. The same was true of department store basements, which lived up to their reputation as fantastic food sources, for locals and tourists alike.  We learned that we could often eat for the same amount or less in restaurants geared to locals or foreigners on limited budgets, rather than chowing down in our hotel room.\n\nKYOTO, Thursday 5/11\n\nWe hit Nijo Castle in the morning and Sento Imperial Palace, one of several attractions we reserved in advance through the Imperial Household Agency.  All were well worth it (and free of charge).  The agency [website](https://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-event/) explains the rules, which vary somewhat from site to site.  We also toured Kyoto Imperial Palace.\n\n**About navigation**\n\nJust as the Google Translate app (and similar devices) have broken down language barriers, several travel apps have vastly simplified the business of getting around.  Google Maps was our basic navigational tool and it rarely failed us. Another app that helped work in concert with Google Maps was Navitime's Japan Travel guide.  Both provide alternate routes, detailed information on trains and stations and much more. Sometimes, when we popped out of subway station, we'd check the compass app on the smartphone to make sure we were heading off in the right direction.  It doesn't hurt that public transit throughout the country increasingly uses English or romaji to translate Japanese. Over four weeks, we only found one place where we had trouble deciphering the destination signs on buses (oddly enough, in Himeji, a tourist magnet).\n\nKYOTO, Friday, 5/12\n\nA busy day started at Katsura Imperial Villa. Like other Imperial Household venues, a guided tour (in Japanese, but with free English audio guide) is the only way to see the place and its beautiful gardens.  \n\nWe also caught a kabuki for beginners show at sumptuous Minamiza Theatre--tickets purchased online in advance--after briefly stopping by bustling Yasaka-jinja shrine down the street.\n\nDinner was our priciest splurge: Itoh, a serene, traditional style steak house in the atmospheric Gion neighborhood.  We hadn't initially planned on eating Kobe beef, since we've pretty much given up beef in our everyday lives, but we were persuaded by a family member who correctly posed the question: If not now, when?  Worth the steep tab ($264), not least because our table overlooked the tiny Shirakawa canal, the service was great and now we can say we know what Kobe beef is all about.  Like buttah.\n\nKYOTO, Saturday 5/13\n\nWe were at Sanjusangendo when it opened and glad we'd gone. The display of 500 life-size, gilded 1000-armed kannon in Japan's longest wooden structure was unforgettable.\n\n We're museum people--either you are or you ain't--and the special exhibition at Kyoto National Museum on the 850th anniversary of the founder of Shin Buddhism was well worth it.  Unfortunately, like most Japanese museums, photos were prohibited inside.  In this regard, technically advanced Japan lags much of the civilized world; even Old Europe has greatly loosened such restrictions in recent years.  Smartphone cameras can be a nuisance to other visitors, but they are a quick and easy way of capturing what you've seen and preserving it for later study.\n\nLunch was at Vegan Ramen Uzu Kyoto, a Bib Gourmand and the weirdest place we ate.  Expanded availability of vegetarian ramen is a promising, healthier trend, and we enjoyed it at several places in Tokyo and Kyoto. A TableCheck reservation, made well in advance, got us seats at this cutting-edge spot.  Dining is at a polished black surface in a darkened room bathed by the illumination of a giant, swirling teamLab artwork. Pricey but good.\n\nKYOTO, Sunday 5/14\n\nWe're horseplayers and enjoyed a day at recently reopened Kyoto Racecourse, capacity 120,000.    Betting is easy; just stop by the information desk for instructions in English.\n\nDinner at Tiger Gyoza Hall was lively, inexpensive and delicious.  It was the only restaurant on our trip that we visited twice; reservable on Google.\n\nKYOTO, Monday 5/15\n\nNo place put us through more hoops than Kokedera, better known at Moss Temple. It was well worth the difficulty of getting a needed reservation; if you do it by mail from abroad--the least expensive way to go--you need a couple months head start (and an International Reply Coupon, which you have to buy online from the Swiss Postal System). We got there and back via city buses.  Along the way we crossed Togetsukyo Bridge in the very congested tourist hotbed of Arashiyama.  It didn't make us regret our decision to skip the area.\n\nAfterward we visited Ninnaji temple. Ryoanji temple and its famous rock garden (where noisy fellow tourists made a Zen experience impossible) and Kinkakuji, the incredible Golden Pavilion.  The place was jammed but crowd control is excellent and we're glad we made it.\n\nKYOTO, Tuesday 5/16\n\nShugakuin Imperial Villa, a vast imperial property of gardens and buildings (which you cannot enter) on the northeastern outskirts, was our favorite Imperial Household Agency site. We felt fortunate to get advance tickets through their lottery but saw that same-day tickets were also available there and at other Agency sites; it would be a long way to go, however, if all tickets were gone on the day you wanted to enter. Since we made a conscious decision to visit Japan after the cherry blossom and Golden Week crowds were gone, we have no idea what things are like during busier times.\n\nWe strolled the Philosopher's Path after lunch.  Perhaps if it had been a quiet early or cherry blossom time, we might have been blown away.  Instead, it was a rare disappointment. It struck us as a very conventional touristy trail; nothing special at all.\n\nOn the other hand, Ginkakuji (Silver Pavilion), near one end of the path, lived up to the hype. We capped the day by off by catching the procession of Aoi Matsuri, or Hollyhock Festival, one of Kyoto's three big annual festivals. The parade of hundreds of elaborately costumed people, some on horseback, highlighted by a pair of ox-drawn carts, was a hoot.  What surprised us was the absence of music or any sort of percussion. \n\nHIMEJI and OSAKA, Wednesday 5/17\n\nA shinkansen whisked us to Himeji for a tour of the incomparable castle and impressive gardens. We took advantage of the unique [Himeji Castle English Speaking Guide](https://i-guide.jpn.org/) service, which generously provides personal tours with an area resident, in English, at no cost (book online in advance). \n\nLunch was at Mentetsu, a very good ramen shop at a mall located between the train station and the castle.  Recommended.\n\nWe finished the excursion at Osaka's famous, crazy Dotonburi neighborhood, a cross between Times Square and Disney. Dinner was our first okonomiyaki, deliciously prepared at Okonomiyaki Mizuno (a Bib Gourmand).  We're allergic to standing in line---life is too short--and we never waited more than 30 minutes for a table on our trip.  They took our order at Mizuno while we were in line, and it was prepared before our countertop seats shortly after we got in.  *Oish\u012b!*\n\nUJI, Thursday 5/18\n\nUji is renowned for its tea and Byodoin temple, best known for its elegant phoenix hall, which is pictured on the back of the 10 Yen coin. It was a great day trip, including lunch at a traditional local soba shop that served cold noodles sobayu style; you pour hot soba stock--the cloudy water the noodles were boiled in--into what's left of your soy-based dipping sauce and drink the (supposedly) healthy brew.  Definitely the way to go. Mampukuji, a Zen temple, was a worthwhile stop before we caught a train back to Kyoto.\n\nNARA, Friday 5/19\n\nOur first day of heavy rain failed to dampen the visit to one of the best places on our trip.  The town, a tourist favorite because, or in spite of, the overpopulation of overly friendly deer, is well-described elsewhere.  We toured Todai-ji, with its giant Bronze Buddha, had lunch at the cute and delicious Pizzeria Trattoria Magazzino (Bib Gourmand) and checked out Kohfukuji temple, too. \n\nKYOTO, Saturday 5/20\n\nFushimi Inari shrine, on almost every Kyoto must-see list, lives up to its reputation.  We followed good  advice from this sub and arrived early, a few minutes before 8 a.m. Already, crowds were building.  We detoured from the main path through thousands of torii gates and wandered instead up an almost totally deserted sylvan trail on the south side of Mt. Inari, past bamboo groves, a few minor shrines and some houses.  After about 45 minutes, we reached a set of stone stairs to the summit.  From the top, we took the main path down, dodging the stream of fellow tourists as best we could and gaping at the gates and the view from the halfway point.  We highly recommend this alternative way of seeing the best of two Fushimi Inari worlds.\n\nWe celebrated our last full day in Kyoto, and our 40th wedding anniversary, with a memorable kaiseki lunch at Hana Kitcho, a Michelin one-star booked weeks in advance from home.  The beautifully decorated private room, attentive service, imaginative presentation, museum-quality stoneware and delicious food were certainly up to one-star standards.\n\nThe minute that advance online tickets went on sale for the 184th Kamogawa Odori, I jumped on them. The tourist-oriented geisha dance performance is held in May at a theater that overlooks the Kamo River.  We were lucky to have been given seats in the front row and when one of the geishas tossed a white cloth package in my direction I snatched it.  I now have an unexpected souvenir, a cloth banner autographed by the geisha herself. The fantastic show will remain in memory.\n\nIZU KOGEN, Sunday 5/21\n\nWe left Kyoto for the Izu Peninsula and what turned out to be the best single night of our trip. Hanafubuki, a modern ryokan I learned about on this sub, was everything we could have wanted. It features 9 private outdoor onsens on beautifully landscaped property and elegant guest rooms with fluffy futons for sleeping on tatami mats. The ten-course dinner was exquisite. Breakfast, a seven-course feast that featured whole grilled horse mackerel and golden-eye sea bream, was simply amazing.\n\nIZU KOGEN, Monday 5/22\n\nA short walk from the ryokan is the scenic Jogasaki Coast nature trail, a rugged stretch of rocks and pounding surf.  A guy I met there who introduced himself as Zeus, a Japanese native currently living in California and in town to visit his parents, compared the coastline to Monterey Bay.  We could have used another night to allow us to explore the trail at greater length.\n\nLunch was at a great local restaurant, walking distance from the train station, Honke Maguroya,  featuring local fish and top-grade tuna.  The wasabi rhizome, which you grate yourself, is a tipoff to the quality of the sushi, but the prices are extremely reasonable.  Recommended.\n\nFrom there we headed back to Tokyo and the remainder of our trip. Highlights and a full (too full?) final report coming soon.",

Before my last visit to Japan (2017), I had booked 13 days at one particular hotel, so I asked them via email if they might be willing to make a reservation at Saihoji on my behalf. They replied that they would, with the caveat that \"We will ask for 124JPY for postcard fee, and you will be paying 3000JPY per person when you visit the garden.\" And indeed, when we arrived at the hotel, the clerk asked (rather apologetically) if we could please pay \u00a5124 upon checking in to reimburse them for the cost of the postcard! Which of course we did, very happily.\r  \n\r  \n(That was the late lamented Palace Side Hotel, which was closed during COVID and has not reopened. As an older \"business hotel\" the amenities were admittedly a bit basic, but their rates were great, and their customer service always exceptional.)\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, I'm mentioning this because \\*possibly\\* if anyone here is planning to make advance reservations with a Kyoto hotel (ideally for multiple days), you may find the staff there willing to reserve a date and time at Kokedera on your behalf, if you ask very nicely and offer to reimburse them for whatever expense they incur.",

            "comment": "Osaka\n- Tombori river cruise - I think this is way better sundown. At least 730PM or 8PM sailing. Tickets should be exchanged early in the day (1hr prior opening) as it sells out fast. Alternatively, I found you can book Wonder cruise online which is also covered by OA.\n- Museum of living in Osaka looks interesting and on our to do list part of OA\n- try at least HEP Ferris Wheel..during the day is fine\n-  Dont forget to try Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki while in Osaka.\n- I looked into Osaka castle boat and was considering, but this looks so meh as your view is the castle which is better seen from ground level anyway. Any reason why you want to try it?\n\nKyoto\n- I think it may be better to spend more time in central Kyoto like Kiyomizu Dera, Gion, if you are pressed for time and maybe Fushini Inari later in the day. Bamboo grove can be skipped.",

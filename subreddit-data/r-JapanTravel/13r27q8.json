The first three weeks I'll be in Tokyo and my plan is to eat a lot of sushi, go to arcades, gaming museums, see some Nintendo stuff, visit theme parks, go clubbing (techno / house) and do the usual sight-seeing at a relaxed pace. I'll plan the rest of my trip when I'm in Tokyo, so far Kyoto and Osaka are on the list.\n\nAs for me; I currently work as a self employed data engineer which allows me to travel quite easily. I'm a former gymnast and still teach, but not full-time anymore. I have a skydiving license so I would actually like to try to get a few jumps in when I'm in Tokyo.

My main focus of this vacation besides de stressing from my job is to explore Japanese culture both traditional and modern, which is why I\u2019m hoping to visit some museums (National Art Center in Roppongi, Tokyo Met Art Museum or Tokyo National Museum), temples (Senso-Ji, Zojo-Ji), and a lot of shrines (Hanazono, Nezu, Meiji Jingu, Koami, Inarikio, whatever shrines I stumble into).\n\nI don\u2019t drink alcohol, but I am looking forward to checking out Tokyo\u2019s culinary scene, especially the Sushi and Izakaya places, and even quirkier places like maid cafes. I\u2019m also cool with exploring different parts of Tokyo and choosing random restaurants or stalls to get food from. So if you want a new buddy to accompany you on your gastronomic journey in Tokyo, I\u2019m glad to be that guy.\n\nAs a gay man, it would also be nice to meet fellow LGBT tourists or locals and explore places in Tokyo that are popular among the LGBT community. I have heard that Shinjuku Nichome is full of establishments catered towards LGBT, so I might briefly check that out, and I\u2019d be eve more glad to make a new friend there.",

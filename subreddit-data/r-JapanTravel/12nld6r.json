In effect that gives me one more full day in Tokyo (Monday 22nd) towards the end of my trip.",

I've no idea if it will be the same for the G7 though.  I want to say it was a day or two on either side of the conference.  I don't know if locker banks were closed on Shikoku, Kyushu, or Hokkaido, as I did not visit them, but I would not be surprised if it was countrywide.\n\nThe G20 was in Osaka, but I left the Kansai region in advance of it to sightsee in Tokyo and Tohoku.  Lockers were closed in Tokyo and in Koriyama which is quite far from Osaka.\n\nGarbage receptacles on shinkansen and limited express trains as well as on station platforms were also closed.",

But someone mentioned that Miyajima may have businesses close on May 17 ahead of the hard closure on 18. I would think the island may actually be busier on the 17 since last day open. Thoughts?",

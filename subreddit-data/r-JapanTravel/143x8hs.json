    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nSo my (21f) kids (M/F), both 6, about to turn 7, are obsessed with Japanese culture. Their favorite movies are Studio Ghibli. Their favorite characters are Kirby, Pokemon, Sanrio, etc. I've always felt like Tokyo would be a dream for them, and I've told them about it and they've been begging me to go. Recently, we traveled to Spain with my parents and they loved it despite barely doing any kid-specific activities. They loved exploring, listening to the guides, and feeling included. The flight was 8 hrs from FL with a connecting 2 hour flight in Morocco to Spain. The kids did well, my family and I had bad jet lag but they were perfectly fine! So for Tokyo, the flight is 18 hours in total. I'm worried about myself and my bf, but more worried about the kids experiencing the same jet lag. \n\n**Wednesday**: For the first day, we will be arriving in our hotel at around 6 PM. So we will be exploring Tokyo around our hotel, finding someplace to eat, and going to little arcades. We want to visit a Don Quixote, I'm hoping I can buy something we can have as breakfast for the following day there?\n\n**Thursday**: I booked a one-day tour of the basics of Tokyo in an air-conditioned bus. We are to be at our meeting point at 7 A.M. We *pass* by Kabukicho, Takeshita Street, National Diet Building, Akihabara, Ameyoko Shopping District, Kappabashi Dougu Street, the Tokyo Tower, Japan National Museum, Roppongi, and Tokyo Mode Gaukuen. We *stop* at Meiji Jingu, Imperial Palace, Sens\u014d-ji, Asakusa, Tokyo Skytree (with entry), Odaiba, and the Rainbow Bridge (we will be taking a cruise under it). Once we are done with our tour, we will be eating and going to arcades before finishing the day.\n\n**Friday (kids' birthday)**: Start the day with the Ghibli Museum. Eat breakfast at the Straw Hat Cafe. Visit Inokashira Park, canoe in their lakes, see bird sanctuary and aquarium. Lunch at Hachu Cafe, a reptiles cafe (kids LOVE reptiles). Tokyo Character Street up next for some birthday gifts, followed by Pokemon Center Tokyo DX. After this, I found a reality VR escape room I was hoping we could go to, along with an arcade nearby just in case. Next, visit Yamashiroya. We will see Ueno Park which is close by and head out to eat dinner at Ninja Tokyo. After this, teamLab Planets Tokyo.\n\n**Saturday**: I booked a tour of Hakone and Mt. Fuji. It takes us to the Fujisan 5 Gome and Gotemba Premium Outlet before taking us to the Hakone Ropeway, which is an aerial sightseeing gondola ride. After that, it takes us to Owakudani, and then the Hakone Pirate Ship, which we will ride on. When we get back to our hotel, I was thinking of having dinner and then heading to the Samurai Museum for the night. Apparently the costumes can be worn by visitors?\n\n**Sunday**: I booked another tour. We go to our meeting point after eating breakfast at a caf\u00e9 nearby. The bus takes us to Nikko Toshogu, Kegon Falls, and Lake Ch\u016bzenji. Once we get back to the hotel, our plan is to go to Hard Rock Cafe Tokyo (it's a thing for my son where he wants to visit every Hard Rock Cafe in every place we go to) and then check out the Tokyo City View in Roppongi Hills. \n\n**Monday**: Here is where we may have an issue. Check-out time is 11 A.M. The flight leaves at 6, almost 7 P.M. I was thinking we go to DisneySea until 5 and then head out to Narita airport. I was strongly debating whether or not to go to Disney since we live close by to DisneyWorld, but I opted for DisneySea because of it's uniqueness. The kids are aware the trip is happening but do not know this exists so this would be a super cute surprise for them since tbh we haven't gone to Disney that much.\n\nI basically need tips for my plans, or if you think something isn't worth it, or if maybe it's too much for kids. I love itineraries. I made our Spain one and I would like to have it perfected because honestly it's way less stressful for me and more comforting through the jet lag :') Thank you all!!!!",

I admire your ambition and am all for kids traveling and seeing the world (we've been flying with ours around the world since they were babies), but this seems a little too ambitious.\n\nDo I think it's a good idea? Bluntly speaking: No, for several reasons. Japan is a lot further from the US than Spain, both in travel distance and culture and time zone. It sounds like you had help for your Spain trip that you don't have here; it also doesn't sound like you have much experience traveling internationally. Flying 36h to spend about 100h (most of which on buses) in a completely other time zone is insane to me, and I can travel hard and have very little jetlag issues as I'm used to having a very irregular sleep schedule. \n\nWhat would I do instead? Find the time / money to do a proper trip to Asia with the kids. Ideally 14 days or more, but definitely no less than ten. Expose them to the other culture, not have them sit them on tourist buses for most of the time -- navigate public transit, see what Japanese people (incl 7 year old kids) do every day, eat their food, do some local activities, etc.\n\nETA: I hope this doesn't come across as mean. I think you are trying to do a really cool thing for your kids, but going from a Spain trip (with backup help) to a Japan trip (without it) is a *really* big jump.",

Do you think Tokyo for 5 days, excluding the activities I had proposed in the itinerary, is a bad idea for their birthday? Should I wait until they are older? Thank you for the honest advice, I appreciate it a lot! It saves us from a potentially draining experience",

I totally would have considered this as a solo trip when I was 21, so I get it -- but even without kids I think I would have regretted it deeply. \n\nWe are a transatlantic family and I've done such short trips to Europe myself and would possibly consider doing it with our kids if the occasion was right. But flying to any Asian country from the US east coast is an ordeal. 5-7 flight hours vs 14 flight hours is a completely different experience; same for 5-7 hours time difference vs 13 hours time difference.\n\nI also don't think it's cost-effective at all. The flights cost so much -- esp. for 4 people -- but the flight cost is the same no matter  how long you stay. That's why my recommendation would be to find some time to go for 14-21 days in the future instead. (It doesn't just have to be Japan, you could do multiple east Asian countries in that time.)",

We were in Spain for four full days only, so when we returned to the airport, it felt way too soon to be doing the flight all over again. It was exhausting for all of us so this was actually a concern for me with this trip. If I do it in the future and can go longer they would definitely enjoy it more and feel less stressed, also me as well. Thank you :) The backup plan is instead of Tokyo, just taking them to Universal Studios or Volcano Bay that's 3 hours away from us :)",

If you did this for their 10th birthdays and spent 8-9 days, I believe all of you would enjoy the trip (and be able to retain the memories) far more. As-is, it\u2019s just far too packed for anyone to appreciate what they\u2019re seeing. In the meantime, you could spend time bringing them to Japanese restaurants and cultural experiences near where you live, so they can form favorite foods and learn a few words and phrases, then when they actually travel to Japan they have a wider range of things to look forward to seeing.",

There is always a chance you might get in if people last minute cancel reservations but a larger group (4) is less likely than a single person.\n\nIf money is no object, there is a limited time Pikachu themed tea.  It's a lot more expensive than the Pokemon Cafe and it is limited, so depending on your dates you will completely miss it.  It does not have child discounts.\n\nI will assume you have also booked the Ghibli Museum if you are going in June, or if you going in July or August, know how to book the Ghibli Museum.\n\nWe use to live on the East Coast.  My tween has been to the UK and been to Japan (multiple times)  Jet lag to the UK (or across the US) doesn't usually affect her much.  Jet lag to Japan is a completely different story.  It's a 14 hour time change from the East coast.  That's a big change.\n\nIf your flight is leaving at 7, you need to be at the airport by 5.  So no, if you want to do Sea, you need to leave by 4 possibly 3:00 to make sure you actually get there on time.  Last time we were there, luggage drop-off took forever, and the lines for security were quite long.  I guess if you are flying First or Business Class it won't be an issue, but if you are in Economy, I think you are not giving yourself enough time to get to the airport and go through security.\n\nI admit, I don't get the obsession with Don Quixote so many tourists have, but I don't remember it having much in the way of breakfast items unless you are planning to eat chips and candy for breakfast.  If that is how you roll, I get it.  We have been known to do Mister Donut for breakfast.    I do now mostly try to book breakfast inclusive rates at hotels.  I find most hotel breakfasts have something we both like, and eating a nice breakfast helps us get through the day.\n\nI personally wouldn't want to do all those tours.  I can't imagine my kid wanting to do them either, but everyone likes their own things.\n\nGood luck!",

I typically go on international trips with my family, who is older, and enjoys all the tours. I guess it's what I'm used to when we go to a new country. When we went to Spain, the kids would sleep or go on the iPad during the long train rides. They didn't cause us trouble and had fun together, but honestly it could've been them making the best of the situation. I want them to have fun.",

                            "comment": "I know someone above was recommending 14-21 days and adding in countries, but I think you could do 10 days as a starting point and make a trip work now.  My tween's first trip to Japan she was 5.5 and we did the trip for 10 days.  I'd been to Japan before, so I had some idea what I wanted to do with her and what I thought she would enjoy.  However, we also had direct flights from our East coast location.\n\nYou could also look into breaking the trip up with a few days in CA or Honolulu before continuing onwards to Japan.  My kid tends to be fine with 10 hour flights, but around hour 11 starts asking when we are landing.\n\nI'm older.  I don't enjoy most tours.  I like being able to stop and see things when I want to see them and not be on a forced schedule.  I certainly let my kid use her electronics on long train trips or in the car, but if you're spending most of your day in transit, how much of the other country is your kid actually experiencing?  The Kawaguchikjo tour and the Nikko tour have to start around 8 am and probably go to 6 or 7 pm.  Those are just long days of touring.\n\nYou don't mention what season you are interested in going and honestly that does affect things.  Mt. Fuji viewing is much worse in the Summer, doing a long expensive day trip just to see Mt. Fuji in the Summer might not be worth it.\n\nMost hotels offer some sort of breakfast.  They vary from something simple and Japanese styles to enormous buffets.  We're both picky eaters and we can still generally find something we like in the buffets, even if it's just yogurt, toast, some fruit and a pastry.  I find jet lag turns us into morning people, so being able to eat a nice meal at 7:00 am is ideal, rather than having to go out to a combini and look for something.  Most cafes don't open in the morning in Japan.  Many open at 10 or 11.  Finding places open before 9 can be very limiting.\n\nI agree with the person who mentioned most animal cafes don't have actual food to make a meal.  We've done two and pretty much all we got are drinks.  I would also check any age requirements for the cafes ahead of time.  I know some of them do have them.\n\nPersonally, I would do Disney Sea on their birthday.  I think it's more celebratory.\n\nI would pick different activities based on when you are looking to go.  Japan has 4 seasons, and some locations are just better during certain seasons.\n\nThe Pokemon Centers give out a special code for a free pokemon in whatever the latest game is, if you visit during your birthday month.\n\nThat's the other thing, you said your kids love Pokemon, Sanrio, Kirby, and Ghibli, and outside going to the Ghibli Museum assuming you get your tickets in advance and one Pokemon shop, you're so busy touring you don't have a lot of time to shop.  If you can't get into the Pokemon Cafe and you don't want to pay 5800 yen + per person for the Pikachu tea (or it's over) you can go to Pokemon Sweets.  Kirby has some sort of take out at the gift shop that sells out fast, there are Ghibli shops outside of the Museum and the Totoro cream puffs shop.  There is a Sanrio Cafe and lots of shops.\n\nCrowds at any given Pokemon Center can vary wildly.  My tween is super into Pokemon so I've been to a lot of them.  They can even vary within a few hours.  When we got to the Skytree one, they were limiting entrances and the line to the registers was 20-30 minutes long.  We left and came back later and it was a lot less crowded.\n\nReally stop to think about what you want to do and what they want to do and be realistic.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Monday sounds incredibly stressful to me. Personally, I can't recommend going to Disney right before a flight. If you do go, I think you'd need to leave earlier than 5 pm. Whether you go by train or bus, you'll also be dealing with traffic on a weekday, and it's best to arrive 2 hours early for international flights. Japan is packed with tourists right now, so customs and stuff will potentially take some time. Not to mention, an entire day walking around, only to get on a 18 hour flight... Unless you fly first class, in which case, maybe not so bad lol. Also, where is your hotel? That could potentially add even more travelling time to your day.\n\nAlso, what season? Maybe I missed it, but if you're doing this in summer time, it's going to be brutally hot. Since you live in Florida I suppose you might be used to it, but... you do a lot of walking outside in Tokyo.\n\nI'd recommend shifting Team Lab to Wednesday, to free up some time on the birthday but still allow the trip to end with a fun event.\n\nAlthough, personally, I'd treat the last day the same as the first day, and be very laidback about it. But that's just me.",

We might be too tired to even want to go since it is our last day, but since we have to check out of the hotel at 11 AM and don't leave until 7 I thought it'd be a good way to pass the time. Maybe we should skip out on it and take it easy. \n\nThank you for the tips :) I will be changing up the entire itinerary bc it's too much for the kids I think, after reading all these comments. I definitely do want to take them to the Ghibli Museum for their birthday because I know they'd love it, and then the Ninja Tokyo restaurant. I can shift Team Lab to Wednesday and remove the tours so we're less packed",

Again, even as an adult I factored in nap time to my Japan plans. \n\nThis is a personal opinion, so feel free to ignore, but for a short trip like this, I would worry less about trying to see a little bit of everything and instead try to get some quality time at a few things.

Take just your first two full days in Japan and spread that out over trip and you will have a packed itinerary.  Just for example, Asakusa and Sensoji is all about walking down the shopping street eating treats and buying tourist \"stuff\". It's really not a 10 minute stop on a bus tour.  Same with others on the bus tour you have planned.  \n\nAlso, jet lag to Japan is brutal.  I never had trouble flying from the US to Europe or returning to the US from Japan.  But flying into Japan, jetlag for days.  You will be up at 3am the next day and by noon, ready to sleep. It's so bad that we are flying to visit relatives in the US this winter(we live in Japan) and we are cutting stuff out of our trip and returning 4 days early so my wife can have recovery time before she returns to work.",

You're underestimating how long it takes to get around Tokyo, if I'm honest. Narita airport is over an hour away from Tokyo, for example.\n\nSimplify it out a bit - personally I'd cancel the Thursday and Sunday tours. Tokyo is best explored, not seen. Do DisneySea on Sunday (yes it's a weekend day but it's Disney so it'll be busy either way). \n\nOn Thursday, choose a couple of things from the tour that you'd like to do - possibly start with Meiji-Jingu, walk out to Harajuku/Takeshita Dori, move to Odaiba for the cruise, end your day around Shibuya for arcades (assuming this is where your hotel is). \n\nFriday - I cannot tell when you are visiting. Please make sure you have all of your reservations in order (most open bookings at least 1 month in advance). I think this day is way too busy. Ghibli Museum is in Mitaka, which is quite a way out. Ghibli -&gt; one themed cafe (MAYBE two) -&gt; Pokemon Center (I spent about 45 minutes queuing just to pay in Osaka Pokemon Center not too long ago) -&gt; TeamLabs Planets.\n\nMonday - Your flight is from Narita, so north of Tokyo to max out your day. Start in Asakusa/Senso-ji, move to Ueno for Yamashiroya (and a big Donki on the Monday because it's the place you'll buy the fun kitkats as gifts to bring home, and not a breakfast spot. Ff you're eating in your hotel, a convenience store is going to be a good breakfast spot. It is not uncommon for me to have a Mister Donut breakfast also). See Skytree as your final thing before leaving for the airport.",

I was given a \"Ticket\" with a time slot and had to come back an hour or so later. The shop was full, some things already sold out, and it would have taken an hour to reach the tills. I left without buying anything. Pokemon Center Shibuya was way better.\n\nThere's also a small Pokemon Center at character street, there was a line to get in, but not as bad.",

            "comment": "To echo what a lot of people are saying, yeah that schedule is FAR too busy. Having came  back from Japan 2 weeks ago I can tell you that two 7yo kids won't be able to hack that much in a single day. May be your kids are far more energetic and motivated that I presume, but our own schedule left us (two 30yo) pretty drained each day.\n\nOur biggest \"what will we do differently next time\" is to pace things out a bit more, our first 5 days alone in Tokyo was full stream ahead. \n\nOn the day we went Ghibli Museum our itinerary was packed like your own. Teams Labs Planets in the morning, Ghibli at noon, took a walk around the park before our alloted time, lunch at straw hat, back to Tokyo, explored Shibuya a bit (by this point we were already getting tired), then off to Roppongi for a Omakase meal, before heading back to our hotel in Ginza. This was day TWO and we were  knackered and it was already sinking in how tired we we're going to be for the rest of this packed holiday.\n\nSo yeah, I believe your kids would love it, but they, yourselves for that matter, might to be awake enough to enjoy to the fullest",

On the first day, the kids would be out cold by 6 pm, and awake at 2 am. The next day was 30 minutes later. I would take a walk with the kids at 2 or 3 am, and watch freight trains rumble by.\n\nIt would typically take 5 or 6 days to get them back in Japan time.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re coming in late July and August, most of the places you want to go will be packed. Especially DisneySea.",

The flight alone will be exhausting and all new impressions have to be processed.  If you had only planned half of it, that would be more than enough.  I can already see how the whole family is just arguing because everyone is so exhausted.\n\n Why not do a Ghibli Film Marathon for the birthday?  In some cinemas you can even rent halls.  Then just popcorn for the whole family and watch the child's favorite movie.  Then you can still go to Disney Land, just the closer one.  How about Paris?\n\nMy advice: Postpone this for 10-11 years and save yourself and your child an incredibly stressful time.",

            "comment": "The Friday seems a bit packed. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably checked but the Ghibli museum opens at 10am and you should book tickets in advance. Depending on where you\u2019re staying, it could take you like an hour to travel there. Tokyo is really spread out. You might spend a couple of hours at the museum but some people end up spending a lot longer just exploring and enjoying the exhibits. The queues for the cafe/food can get pretty long too. When I visited, we didn\u2019t even bother trying to get food because of the queues lol and this was back when the country still wasn\u2019t open to tourists (I live here). It will probably be well into the afternoon by the time you\u2019ve finished up there, visited the park, done those activities then spent time at the animal cafe. From there to the character street it\u2019s about a 45 minute train journey. Then from the Pok\u00e9mon Center Tokyo DX to Yamashiroya it\u2019s 18 minutes on the metro. Of course there are wait times to include for things such as the Pok\u00e9mon Center if it\u2019s really busy, if there are any delays with the trains etc. If you\u2019re planning to go to Ninja Tokyo then that\u2019s 30 mins on the train again. From there to teamLab planets it\u2019s about 35 minutes estimated on Google maps. This isn\u2019t even including that VR experience that you mentioned or spending time at Ueno park. Obviously you know your kids best but I feel like that\u2019s a lot of travelling on trains and walking, and some of these trains can be PACKED so you don\u2019t always get a rest in the travel time. I\u2019d say pick out a few main activities that you definitely want to do, such as the ghibli museum, and (as you\u2019ve said in another comment) just keep some ideas in mind for the itinerary if you do end up having time to fit them in. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know specifics about that reptile cafe but a lot of these animal cafes don\u2019t actually have a wide variety of things to eat and drink because they\u2019re more of a novelty place. So, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll get a proper lunch there. I went to the mipig cafe and they sold coffee, tea, orange/apple juice and donuts. Just as a heads up. \n\nHave you heard of the Unko museum in Odaiba? It might be fun for the kids. I\u2019ve been and it isn\u2019t very big but it was quite a funny experience.",

You have twice as many things planned per day as we were able to achieve before kids tapped out on every day.\n\nFor our birthday we had teamlab planets first (9am), then little zoo by ghibli, and ghibli museum (2pm) and that burned everyone out (teamlab was 5x more interesting to the kids than ghibli, and they know every movie by heart). We went to a cake shop in shinjuku-5 and bought 3 small cakes to split between our group of 7.",

            "comment": "Tokyo with similar aged kids has been great this week! Two ideas - plan around jet lag, and leave more \u201copen\u201d space for exploration to see non-tourist culture. I\u2019d recommend a daily structure on how to tour vs. what to tour:\n\nYou\u2019ll probably be waking up around 2-5am, and be ready to crash 6-8pm. I say knock out your \u201clist\u201d before say 2:00, and leave your afternoon more flexible. Plan great meals for lunch, as dinner will likely be an experiment in fatigue. You\u2019ll get a metabolism boost when you eat lunch, giving you some energy to go explore for another short burst. At this point in mid afternoon, have an option to find your walking distance \u201cLocal\u201d attraction. For us, it was the national garden in Shinjuku. Go rest, process, enjoy a time without a check mark.\n\nAt this point in the afternoon, we were mostly burned out and made plans accordingly. One day during this time, the kids just wanted to go back and rest in the apartment.  My wife and I randomly walked to a liquor store for a bottle of sake, well off the beaten path in shinjuku. We walked the tiniest maze of streets in a  neighborhood full of unique houses all crammed together. We passed a college dorm and some young students. We saw a Japanese mom shoo\u2019ing her kid out the door for school, and the kid turned around a flipped her off. The liquor shop was run by this great older woman. Great experience!\n\nIn short, leave the possibility for some chill time in the afternoon. You\u2019ll have a great time!",

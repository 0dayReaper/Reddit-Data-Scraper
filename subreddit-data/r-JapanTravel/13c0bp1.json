    "postText": "Hello, I will be traveling to Japan in September with my partner. This will be my third time there and my partner's second time so we added in a few new activities to make things more exciting. I've tried to balance the schedule so there were days that were more relaxed and days where we had a more packed itinerary.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is there a JR Regional Pass that would cover Tokyo -&gt; Kamakura/Enoshima-&gt; Hakone -&gt; Osaka -&gt; Tokyo? OR Should I just get the JR 7 Day pass?\n   1. If I do get the JR pass, what trains/lines would be covered if I want get to Hakone from Tokyo and again, from Hakone to Osaka?\n2. Currently, I have Kamakura/Enoshima as a day trip from Tokyo, would it make more sense to stay overnight in Kamakura THEN travel to Hakone? (\\*Looking at google maps, it seems it's easier to commute to Hakone from Tokyo)\n3. I'm also looking for recommendations for a nice Ryokan to stay in Hakone. Preferably something within $400-500 a night for two people, that is inclusive of dinner and breakfast, and with a hot spring on site. I currently have a reservation at Hakone Ashinoko Hanaori but I'm open to other suggestions!\n4.

            "comment": "If you are only going to Osaka and back, you do not need a JR pass. Hakone is better reached on Odakyu.\n\nSpeaking of Kamakura, if all you are going to visit is the Buddha and Hachimangu, you could as well just not visit it. These temples are crowded and not that interesting to start with, while ignoring other temples in Kamakura is a waste. In Enoshima visit the caves too.\n\nStaying in Kamakura is OK, but it requires a transfer which you don\u2019t need. Kamakura and Enoshima are easily done as day trips from Tokyo and moving a hotel makes no sense.\n\nIf you arrive at 1PM to Owakudani there is no way to head to Osaka at 2PM. Besides since you take the ropeway, your station of departure will be Togendai, most likely. The train to Osaka departs from Odawara, and you will first need to get there.",

I think the JR pass would be valuable since the trip from Hakone -&gt; Osaka would cost around $135 and the trip to Osaka -&gt; Tokyo would be around 150$ and I'm sure I could spend the remaining on other train rides. Unless I'm missing something?\n\nFor Kamakura, what would you recommend seeing? I'm just going off of Google for recommendations. I'm trying to do Kamakura and Enoshima in a day, would love to see the best of both areas.",

            "comment": "I've been planning a very similar itinerary for my honeymoon, from Tokyo to Kamakura/Enoshima/Hakone, and then Hakone to Osaka.\n\nThere's a [Hakone Kamakura Pass](https://www.odakyu.jp/english/passes/hakone_kamakura/) which is valid for 3 consecutive days and covers the travel between Tokyo (Shinjuku) and Kamakura/Enoshima and Hakone (including the Hakone Loop), with unlimited use of the Odakyu rail network. \n\nIf you check out this [sample itinerary](https://www.odakyu.jp/english/sightseeing/itineraries/hakone-kamakura-3-days/), it shows you how you can get between Kamakura/Enoshima and Hakone.\n\nI'm also thinking of staying in Kamakura/Enoshima for 1 night, and Hakone for 2 nights, rather than doing day trips from Tokyo.\n\nAs for Hakone to Osaka, I'm thinking of just purchasing a Shinkansen ticket if a JR Pass is not worth it for me as per my itinerary (which it likely won't be).",

Bullet Trains (Shinkansen) will help you get to Hakone from Tokywhereo,  you could use the Kodama to get off at Hakone, and use the same Kodama Shinkansen to get to Osaka. \n\n2. You should stay at Kamakura first then travel to Hakone. \n\n3.

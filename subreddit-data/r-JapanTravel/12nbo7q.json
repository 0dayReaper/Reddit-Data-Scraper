    "postText": "We are two guys (30s and 40s) who unfortunately realized well after buying our air tickets that we'll be visiting over Golden Week (4/28-5/4).\n\nIt'll be my friend's first time in Kansai (my third), so we're still going to visit many of the major attractions. I know how to get around but have never been there over Golden Week, so I was wondering if there's anything we should watch out for or anything in our itinerary you think we should change?\n\nWe both like historical sites and don't mind walking. My friend is also into manga and anime. We enjoy good food, too, and may want to try kaiseki one night. We also have some targeted shopping (outdoor gear/clothing, electronics). Any alternative suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n\nWe're spending the first 2 nights in Osaka near Namba, next 4 nights in Kyoto next to Omiya.\n\n**Friday 4/28 - Osaka**\n\n* 8am - arrive at KIX\n   * Get Osaka metro 1-day pass and Haruka Kyoto-to-KIX ticket\n   * Take Nankai Main Line to Namba\n   * Leave luggage at hotel\n* Lunch - Kuromon Market\n   * I've heard it's best to go before 11am? In which case we might push this to Sunday\n* Afternoon\n   * Osaka Castle\n   * Osaka Tenmangu\n   * Umeda - Pokemon Center (or after Umeda Sky Building)\n* Sunset\n   * Umeda Sky Building\n* Evening\n   * Shinsaibashi\n   * Dotonburi\n\n**Saturday 4/29 - Nara**\n\n* Day - Nara\n   * Nara Park\n   * Todaiji\n   * Maybe walk inside/around Mt. Kasuga Primeval Forest (?)\n   * Horyuji (?)\n      * Is there time and is it worth it?\n      * Is it different enough from Todaiji?\n* Night - back in Osaka\n   * Tsutenkaku\n\n**Sunday 4/30 - Osaka, Kyoto**\n\n* Morning / Lunch\n   * Kuromon Market (?)\n   * Sumiyoshi Taisha\n   * Tennoji Park + Shitennoji\n   * Denden Town / Ota Road\n* Afternoon / Early evening\n   * Head to Kyoto\n* Night\n   * Dinner + stroll near Kamo River\n\n**Monday 5/1 - Kyoto Northwest**\n\n* Arashiyama\n   * Bamboo Forest\n   * Okochi Sanso Garden\n   * Tenryu-ji\n   * Lunch around Togetsu Bridge\n* Sagano scenic train to Kamoeka (?)\n   * Not sure if the river boat ride will be back by then, but if not, we might just take the normal  train back\n* Ninna-ji (?)\n   * By the way, is the PiPPA bike rental system in Kyoto any good?\n* Kinkaku-ji\n* Kitano Tenmangu (?)\n* Dinner near Demachiyanagi + stepping stones at the river\n\n**Tuesday 5/2 - Kyoto Southeast up to Gion**\n\n* Fushimi Inari\n* Komyo-in or Tofuku-ji (?)\n* Kiyomizu-dera\n* Sanneizaka + Nineizaka\n* Kodai-ji\n* Gion\n* Dinner + shopping + strolling nearby\n\n**Wednesday 5/3 - Kyoto Northeast down to Gion**\n\n* Ginkaku-ji\n* Philospher's Path\n* Eikan-do (Zenrinji)\n* Nanzen-ji or Heian Shrine (?)\n* Shoren-in + Mausoleum\n* Yasaka Shrine (?)\n* Nishiki Market\n* Dinner + shopping + strolling nearby\n\n**Thursday 5/4**\n\n* 10am Kyoto Station to KIX\n   * Doesn't look like there's enough time in the morning to really do anything, so we'll likely just take it easy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rainy day backup plans**\n\n* Osaka - any suggestions?\n* Kyoto\n   * International Manga Museum\n   * Other ideas?",

If anything it just became kind of a funny story, and resulted in lots of good people watching opportunities.\n\nThere's been 4 years an a global pandemic since, so the popular Golden Week attractions might have changed. However, the only places from your itinerary I remember being straight up \"this is not a good time\" crowded were Fushimi Inari and Nishiki Market.\n\nAt Fushimi Inari we ended up making at as far as the start of the shrine gate trail before deciding to peace out. Instead we went to a nearby sake museum and distillery which was great and pretty quiet. Your Fushimi mileage may vary, but definitely recommend this as a back-up.\n\nWe did still walk through Nishiki, but didn't stop to buy anything. We came back later in the evening when the stalls were closed but restaurants and bars were open and that was way more pleasant.\n\nYour friend will probably take it in stride, as they'll have nothing to compare it to.\n\nWe also visited Nara deer park, dotonburi, gion, and the bamboo grove that trip and they were popular but I wouldn't say crowded or unpleasant.\n\nWe booked our shinkansen tickets at the station a day or two before travel, and never had any problems here either. There were daily features on the news about people having to stand, but we never saw or experienced it. (Plus, coming from the UK: having to stand on a crowded train is a normal Tuesday, rather than an annual news worthy event).",

I personally wouldn't revisit Fushimi Inari, but my friend can't be dissuaded haha, although at least we'll go first thing early in the morning.\n\nIt's also reassuring to hear it wasn't unpleasantly crowded at the other places you visited.\n\nI've had the same experience at Nishiki Market as you did, I guess it can't be helped because the street is a bit narrow to begin with, although I do like that it has quite a few crossroads in between that allow you to escape in short order instead of being forced to squeeze through to the end.  \n\n\n&gt;(Plus, coming from the UK: having to stand on a crowded train is a normal Tuesday, rather than an annual news worthy event).\n\nHahahaha, thanks for that.",

Expect a massive crowd in each and barely able to move around comfortably at all around the main attractions.\nI was just in kamakura on a weekend day and it was already unbearable around the main area by Kamakura station up to the temple.\nYou might wanna consider visiting smaller, lesser known places and focus on the beautiful countryside.",

Kyoto is so beautiful anyway almost wherever you go, so I feel it's hard to get disappointed even if we don't get to see all the main attractions. Let's see. Thanks!",

Japan is always busy, especially on the weekends. And even more so now that japan is literally getting a million tourists nearly each month. I\u2019m going in June and didn\u2019t realize that June is their rainy season until I already booked everything. But I\u2019m not gonna let that ruin my trip lol. As long as I can get a single day without rain to wear my kimono at Asakusa, I don\u2019t care. People also keep warning me of the hot and humid weather (I\u2019m from the midwest, the only summers we get are hot and extremely humid ones) so I\u2019m not stressing about that either. Just enjoy your trip, with the expectation that it will be very crowded and busy.",

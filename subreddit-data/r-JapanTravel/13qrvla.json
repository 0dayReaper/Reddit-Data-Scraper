    "postText": "Hey all!Im planning an early itinerary for my second trip to Japan from early august for about 3 weeks.  Suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\n\\--These are my current questions:\n\n* Since I am meeting separate groups of people in the middle of the trip, I am in a dilemma on what is my best budget for travel expenses such as JR pass, metro pass etc.  I am looking at a 14-day JR pass from Day 3 to Day 16 since it covers most of my long-distance rides and the remaining will be by metro passes/ic cards.\n* I have Day 11 and 12 open at the moment which I will go on a solo trip, currently I have Fuji/Shizuoka in mind as it is on the way towards Nagoya from Tokyo, any recommendations on where I can possibly visit without spending too much (SGD$75/day)?\n* My primary accommodations are mostly Airbnb which are priced at a good rate and the privacy, would you recommend to swap to hotels since it allows for luggage services?\n* Any other important/key travel tips to know?

            "comment": "\nJust wanted to point out Day 19 to 22 in Yokohama. Were you going to change hotels and stay overnight in Yokohama? I would recommend you just do a day trip from Tokyo. You can do cup noodle museum and gundam factory easily in a day (probably 1.5 to 2 hrs at cup noodle factory and ~1 up to 2 hrs at gundam if you wanted to see all the different motions) . Not sure what else you wanted to see at Yokohama but can probably eat in and see Chinatown as well in between the two attractions.\n\nMaybe you can do other day trips for Day 20 and 21 from Tokyo such as Kamakura, Enoshima, etc",

It's better to have amanohashidate as a separate day plus something like Ine or Kinosaki as they are at least close by. But this is provided that you stay localy there otherwise you will spend most of the day on the train.",

Commute from Tokyo might take you around 4 hours and commute from Takayama to Shin Hotaka ropeway takes roughly more than 100 minutes one way.\n\nAlso if you plan on going to Shirakawa go, Hida Folk village is not a must.",

I was thinking of getting to Takayama by afternoon then spending the day there. Maybe I\u2019ll scrap the rope way and enjoy the other three\n\nOr maybe I can just do the ropeway",

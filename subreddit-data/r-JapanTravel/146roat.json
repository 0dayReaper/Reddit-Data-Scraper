    "postText": "\n  \n\n  \nI was hoping to bike to Hiroshima, but because of the G7 summit, many public roads and most of the sights I wanted to see were closed. I take the alternative path by taking the ferry to Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku. It was a nice ride and I was able to see the sea! Once in the city, I explored and went up to Matsuyama Castle. The city was built around the Castle about 400 years ago. The view from the top is amazing, you can really see everything from the town to the mountain ranges and the ocean. Because Matsuyama loves oranges there was a drinking fountain with orange juice and I was able to get some orange-flavored ice cream! \n  \nAfterwards, I headed to one of Japan's oldest public baths, Dogo Onsen. This was a 3000 years old Onsen. I wasn't able to take photos or videos to show you guys but it was deeply refreshing. It helped me relax after all of my biking.   \nI biked to Imabari a city known for shipbuilding. The city was packed because of a convention. Every hotel was booked except for one called hotel riverside. The check-in desk asked me how many hours I wanted to say, which was odd. Once I checked in I realized that this was a love hotel, a hotel where couples spend a few hours for Private time and leave. I was a bit caught off guard by the contents of the room. I met another solo traveler there named Mashashi, he also couldn't find a place to stay haha. He was kind enough to take me to a nearby BBQ place and buy me dinner. He was visiting from Tokyo, I hope I can meet him again when I get there. Each parking space had a curtain covering the guest's car (see photos for visual), there is a big emphasis on privacy in Japan.  \nThe next day I continued my trip to the Setonaikai national park. There is a chain of seven Islands with bridges connecting Shikoku to Honshu. I truly can not describe the beauty of this park. The air was clean, the water was bright and the views were breathtaking. I attempted to take photos along my path but they do not do the park justice. I have visited 46 countries and this was the 2nd most beautiful trail I have seen. \n\nAlong the way, I took a short detour with a ferry to \u014ckunoshima also known as rabbit island! There were hundreds of rabbits running around I spotted them and gave them some carrots. They were very cute and friendly. The island was also used to produce chemical weapons during WW2 and is now home to many ruins of the Japanese Imperial Army.\n I continued my ride and ended this chapter in the city of Fukuyama. Onto Osaka soon!  \n\n\n  \n[PHOTOS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xdg9iV_IacV04salW8iL5YYivbnwfHM0?usp=sharing)\n\nI also have a vlog of this post, but I'm not allowed to post it here. It's in my bio if anyone wants to see it.",

A lot of love hotels have covered entrances for the same reason, minimises the chance of someone being clearly seen entering or leaving. Not saying privacy isn't a thing in Japan, but love hotels are a special case.",

The castle is one of the best that I\u2019ve been to in Japan as well, plus the views that you mentioned. Thanks for posting!",

One day a Heron who injured his shin found a hot spring. He soaked his shin every day in the hot water and slowly healed and flew away. The spring became known for its healing properties by the locals.  \n\n\nMy legs have been quite sore so the spring helped me relax. Japanese onsens are segregated by gender and any clothing/ bathing suits are not allowed. I usually try to spend about 30- 40 mins in the water to decompress. It's a great experience!",

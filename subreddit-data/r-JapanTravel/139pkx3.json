If you have any suggestions or attractions to add I'm open to hear your opinions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also want to ask if you think a budget of 3000$ USD (excluding international flights) will be enough for this trip or if I should decrease the number of days. For transportation we will be using a 14 days JRP during this trip.\n\nYou might notice that some days are packed, but the must visit will be bolded and anything else can be dropped if we didn't have enough time.\n\n# Tokyo\n\nDay 1:\n\nArrive\n\nDay 2:\n\n* **Shinjuku**\n   * \\- **Shinjuku Gyoen**\n   * \\- Hanazono Shrine\n   * \\- Samurai Museum\n   * \\- Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buildings\n   * \\- **Nakano Broadway**\n* Ginza\n   * \\- Yanaka Ginza\n\nDay 3\n\n* Tsukiji fish market\n* **teamLab Planets**\n* **DiverCity Tokyo Plaza**\n* Odaiba (Trick art museum?) only if there is time\n* **Go to Takayama**\n\n# Takayama+ Kanazawa\n\nDay 4 Takayama\n\n* **Hida no Sato**\n* **Takayama Jinya**\n* **Sanmachi Suji (Old Town)**\n* **Higashiyama Walking Course**\n* Kusakabe Heritage House\n* Hachiman Shrine\n* Stay the night at Takayama\n\nDay 5 Shirakawago\n\n* Takayama =&gt;

Also, I saw you said typhoid season which did give me a good laugh because I\u2019m assuming you mean typhoon season. I hope to god there isn\u2019t a typhoid season here or I\u2019ve been living under false pretenses. For that, I\u2019d say just download an emergency app that will send you warnings ahead of time so you can know and plan accordingly. Definitely not fun to go outside during a typhoon!",

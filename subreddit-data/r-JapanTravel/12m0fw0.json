Do not put stamps, stickers, or write on the pages yourself. I keep a separate sheet of paper in the front of the book and make a running list of the places I got each Goshuin.  When the book is full, *then* you can go back and write the location of the Goshuin into your book or just a small number in the bottom corner to correspond with your table of contents sheet.  \n- Check out some of the gachapon (capsule toy) arcades. Be sure to take your toy out of the capsule and place it in the recycle bag/bin by the machine.  Capsules will quickly use up all the space in your luggage but the toys are quite small.  \n- [Paid: Tokyo Shop With Most Gachapon in the World](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/this-new-tokyo-shop-has-the-most-capsule-toy-machines-in-the-world-022521)\n- You\u2019ll also find travel themed gachapon in places like major train stations or sites like Arashiyama in Kyoto. These will be themed such as pandas to represent the zoo in Ueno or famous places in that city/region.\n- When you get home, super glue magnets to the toys to make fun mementos for your fridge.",

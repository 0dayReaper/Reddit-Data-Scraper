            "comment": "IMO the kyoto days are a little ambitious in terms of number of attractions / day. I agree with the commenter that suggested Tokyo -&gt; Kyoto as later in November you will get better fall colors. It could be fine though if you guys like to get up early (which I highly recommend in Kyoto) and maintain a good pace. But on the flip side, less time to wander and get lost. \n\nI think beyond what you have, it just depends on your interests - ie, day trips to Nikko, Kamakura, etc could make sense if you think you'd be \"city'd out\" by that point, but on the other hand, you might prefer to spend every second exploring the dense areas of Tokyo. \n\nFor me, I'd adjust the 1 day in Ebisu shopping, 1 day in Shinjuku shopping, 1 day in Shibuya shopping, etc - unless that's your dominant interest by far, I'd say a couple hours of shopping a day and then do some sightseeing and attractions. If shopping is the priority, then yeah I mean those are all good choices.",

It also really depends if we can tickets for the Sagano railway and boat ride. We aren't too crazy about temples and more city people but we did add Mitaka to see more fall colors.  \nWe did add a lot of shopping lol but that's just generally 2-3 hours in the day. Just need to figure out what else to do.",

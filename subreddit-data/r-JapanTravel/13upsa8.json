            "comment": "Oooooooh.... Yikes.... Honey nooooooo.\n\n\nI hate to tell you but this plan is a -1/10 at *least*\n\nFor two weeks you should really aim for just Tokyo/Osaka with a few day trips to like Hakone/Kyoto. \n\nPutting fuji-hakone, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Takayama, BEPPU?! and Nara on a 14 day trip is a huge mistake. I really hate to tell you this but absolutely 100% revise your trip. Most of these are not daytrips. Hakone/Fuji can be an overnight from Tokyo. Nara can be a daytrip from Osaka. The rest not so much. Allotting one city a day just about with the constant time wasted on transit is way too much. Most of your trip will be commuting rather than exploring. I didn't see your interests being sitting on trains and busses looking out the window but rather ' culture, nature, history, and art.'. You will barely be able to enjoy your trip with how much you have to spend on transit. \n\nStarting off strong. Your Fuji/Hakone day has you going to Gotemba from Shinjuku? Why? It would be better on time to just go straight to Kawaguchiko from Shinjuku. Gotemba is on the opposite side of Fuji from Shinjuku basically. You would be going to Gotemba for no reason only to back track to where you were kinda. Instead of doing 1, 2, 3, you'd do 1, 3, 2. \n\nIt would be better to do Shinjuku -&gt; Kawaguchiko -&gt; Hakone.\n\nBeppu is not a day trip from Osaka. Maybe from Hiroshima but Osaka? No. It takes roughly 4 hours to get there so that's 8 hours of your day on a train. \n\nCut out Nagoya, Cut out Beppu, Cut out Takayama. I'd even cut out Hiroshima if you're not staying overnight tbh. Stay in Tokyo and Osaka for the additional days you get from taking those places out. Then you can do your overnight trip to Hakone and your day trips to Kyoto and Nara with ease.",

I suppose I can cut off Beppu and replace it with full day in Hiroshima instead.\n\nI wasn't aware that I could just go straight to Kawaguchiko from Shinjuku either! My searches pointed me to use buses to gotemba instead of trains...\n\nCutting Nagoya &amp; Takayama off, Should I instead go with something like this, then?  \n\nday 1-2 : Tokyo\n\n\nDay 3 : Mt fuji (Lake Kawaguchi, via Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko), travel to Hakone hostel\n\n\nDay 4: Hakone\n\n\nday 5-9 : Osaka (use as base for day trips to Kyoto &amp; Nara, if that's possible?)\n\n\nday 9-10: Hiroshima  \n\n\nday 10-14: Tokyo",

I honestly think you\u2019d enjoy everything soo much better if you spent more time in the hub cities and sticking to the closer day trips that you\u2019ve outlined here. Less time commuting and more time to explore. You don\u2019t have to park and unpack soo much and worry about putting stuff in lockers. I know how it feels to want to see all the places but what you lose to achieve that isn\u2019t really worth it imho. \n\nThis adjustment is a great start and I think you\u2019ll find plenty to fill up your days without being rushed before",

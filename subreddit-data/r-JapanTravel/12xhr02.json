    "postText": "**Day 1 (September 23, Saturday): NARITA AIRPORT \u2192 UENO HOTEL**\n\n&gt;***Question: We will be arriving at Narita Airport around 8:10 PM and I have seen people saying that it may take us 2 hours or probably more inside the Airport. Can anyone suggest if it's best to just go ahead and complete the trip going to Tokyo the same day we arrive? We don't really mind another extra hours of travel time going to our Accommodation in Ueno.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2 (September 24, Sunday):  HOTEL \u2192 ASAKUSA \u2192 UENO \u2192 HOTEL**\n\n* Start at 8:00am, eat breakfast at nearby Kombini or Cafe\n* Senso-Ji Temple\n* Nakamise Street\n* Kaminarimon Gate\n* Sumida River\n* Tokyo Skytree - ***optional***\n* Ueno Park - ***optional***\n* Ameyoko Shopping District\n\n&gt;***Question: I removed the timestamps and thought that it would be best to list major places/attractions we want to visit, also factoring in the travel time, queues we will be having all throughout the day, lots of walking, etc., can anyone confirm how doable or manageable our day 2 is? I'll appreciate any suggestions and feedback here!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3 (September 25, Monday):  HOTEL \u2192 DISNEYLAND \u2192 HOTEL**\n\n* Depart at 7:00 am - Train going to Disneyland, Maihama \n* Spend the rest of the day here with Family.\n\n&gt;***Question: There's a lot of things I haven't thought of on our day 3 but we're wanting to visit Disneyland as early in the week and do it on a weekday to hopefully avoid a tons of people. Can anyone confirm any things we should consider before going to Disneyland? or anything we should know? Thanks!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo everyone in this community that acknowledged and provided their insights and inputs to make our first trip to Japan better! Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude43",

For the record my flight arrived at 7:30pm to HND and I arrived at my hotel at 10:30pm. BUT if any of you have mobility issues then traveling with large suitcases might be more difficult.\n\nJust set GPS Narita 11pm to Ueno and see what your options are. If you guys are lucky and catch the final train of the skyliner at 11pm then it's just one hr to Ueno. If not, the last limo bus leaves 11:25pm and you'd need to transfer to last JK train at 00:43am, and you'll still get to Ueno in 1.5 hr so not too horrible. Just let your hotel know you'll be checking in very late.",

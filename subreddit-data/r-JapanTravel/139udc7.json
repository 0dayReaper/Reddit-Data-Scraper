    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI posted and asked for opinions on my itinerary yesterday but the post was removed, most likely because it was pretty bare bones and the post overall was pretty rushed.\nI was however able to read a few very helpful replies before my post was removed and i have since made some adjustments to my plan and added some of the activities we are interested in.\n\nThis whole trip came about very suddenly when i was able to get some time off from work with very short notice and we decided to just go for it with about 2 weeks to spare. My biggest concern right now is figuring out how the whole train system works and how and when to make seat reservations but im will be reading up on this after writing this.\n\nThe travelers are myself M33, my wife F29 and our son 1,5 and we are starting our trip from Shanghai where we live. \n\nI will preface by saying that after being an expat in China for a few years we have seen our fair share of temples and shrines so we will focus most of our attention  elsewhere.\n\nIm hoping to get some opinions on our itinerary and hopefully detect some planning conflicts while it is still possible to make adjustments. we are also very grateful for any tips and tricks or suggestions you might have about things to see, do eat or experience.\nBecause we are traveling with a small child we try to keep the schedule light and flexible for most part and obviously we will not be needing any tips on bars and nightlife.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMay 12: Arrive Osaka Kansai 13:20\nPrepare \"Visit Japan App\" in advance, pick up our 1-week JRpasses, pocket wifi and ICOCA cards. Worth getting the \"Osaka amazingpass\"?\nMake our way to Osaka Hotel Granvia in Umeda. (Stay 2 nights)\n\nMay 13: Full day in Osaka\nMight use the \"Osaka amazingpass\" to get around if we decide to go for it, otherwise we will use our ICOCA cards. Places of interest are Dotonbori, Kamigata Ukiyo-e Museum, Umeda sky building and just any interesting malls, stores or parks we happen to run into. If the weather is poor we might go to the Osaka Aquarium or the Cup noodles museum.\n\nMay 14: Hiroshima &amp; Miyajima\nTrain to Hiroshima (activate the JRpass) to see the Peace monument and whatever else the city has to offer. Take the ferry over to Miyajima and spend a few hours exploring and of course see the shrine. Spend the night at Hiroshima FAV HOTEL.\n\nMay 15: Himeji &amp; Kyoto\nTrain to Himeji to see the castle and maybe eat before heading on to Kyoto where we will be staying at the APA Hotel Kyoto Gion Excellent for 3 nights. The rest of this day will be spend exploring the immediate area around the hotel and settling in.\n\nMay 16+17: Kyoto\n2 days to see the most popular tourist attractions such as the Fushimi Inari-taisha, Kiyomizu-dera, Golden Pavilion, Higashiyama Ward, Arashiyama and maybe the SAMURAI &amp; NINJA MUSEUM. we have not planned the order of activities yet and for food we plan on just take it as it comes and just eat when we see something we like.\n\nMay 18: Tokyo\nTrain to Tokyo, check in at the APA Hotel Higashi Shinjuku Kabukicho Tower, 4 nights.\nFirst day again will be spent finding our bearing and explore kabukicho area and whatever else we come across. Again we are trying to not pack our days full so we can tend to the toddlers needs and take things as they come.\n\nMay 19+20+21: Tokyo\nAgain we have not planned our days yet but rather been gathering things that interest us and been adding to a list, a few things are the Muji flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo Skytree, Sensoji, Akihabara and so on. more research and planning required.\n\nMay 22+23: Kawaguchiko\nWe will try to get on the Fuji excursion express train to Lake Kawaguchiko where im hoping to find a budget friendly ryokan for 2 nights. we might get the mount fuji travel pass and get around to a few vantage points to view Mt Fuji from a few different angles. we are also considering attending the shibazakura flower festival and/or Fuji Q Highland theme park. I hope to have a relaxing time here.\n\nMay 24: Head back to Tokyo\nNot sure how to spend this day yet but we might have unfinished business or just have a slow day. At the end of the day the plan is to end up at a hotel either near Disney resort or with good transportation routes to get there.\n\nMay 25: Disney\nEither Disneyland or Disneysea. Im more interested in Disneysea but i think Disneyland might be more suitable for a 1,5 year old so we are currently leaning towards land.\nAt the end of the day, return to the same hotel where we started the day.\n\nMay 26: Home trip\nMake our way to Haneda airport for our 14:30 flight.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI appreciate every comment on this plan as i am quite nervous for our first proper trip with our son and i feel like i have not had enough time to research everything well enough. Thanks in advance!\n\nPS i would especially appreciate recommendations for where to stay in and around lake Kawaguchiko and Disney resort. and any tips about how to get around with trains and subway would be a huge help.",

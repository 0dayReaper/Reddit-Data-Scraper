    "postText": "My girlfriend is finally taking the trip of her dreams to Tokyo (from Florida).  She has always wanted to visit it and planned out a very detailed itinerary.  The first few days, she was living her dream.\n\nUnfortunately, a chronic ankle injury has flared up due to all the walking in Tokyo.  She currently feels trapped in her hotel room because she is unable to walk reliably.  She is going to a pharmacy when it opens to see if she can get crutches or something, but I don't know if that'll work.  She also does not have health insurance.\n\nThis trip was taken from her by various abusive people in her life, on multiple occasions.  Now she believes that she has taken it away from herself and is seriously implying that she will commit suicide in Japan.  \n\nI am worried about her mental and physical health.  I'm still in Florida, so there isn't much I can do to help.  Does anyone have any ideas on resources in Tokyo that I can leverage to help her?\n\nThanks so much for any help you can provide.",

It was \u00a380 (I think about $100) at the time so didn\u2019t go through the insurance as that was cheaper than my travel insurance excess was. It was difficult but I was still able to get around Tokyo and try and make the most of my holiday. Hope she\u2019s ok.",

Due to the stress of all this I got a really nasty cold sore so went to a clinic next door to the hotel on my last day, they informed me it was a private place but still sold me some antiviral cream at a quarter of the price it would cost in the UK, incredibly friendly too, it was a tiny thing but it meant a hell of a lot considering how shit I was feeling lol.",

The station itself is 5 stories with the Termina department store and tons of food options. Location of the hotel is next door to some of the love hotels and cabaret night clubs so it can feel red light district a bit at night but you never feel not safe even walking around at 3am. \n\nLaundry: 300 yen for wash and that comes with detergent. 100 yen for every 30 minutes of dryer time.\n\nThis was my second visit to the hotel and we just finished 5 nights at Moxy.",

They are now over the counter in the US as well, but were not in '07.  She should get some and put some on her ankle and keep it elevated.  If she is not tattooed, look into a day of going to the onsen, I find that helps enormously with aches and pains.  \n\nI don't know how to help with the suicidal ideation, outside of having her call one of the numbers already supplied.",

The accident was all my fault, I was not careful going down from the top. I was just lucky it was only a finger and I hadn't slipped and cracked my skull open.  It didn't even ruin the trip, I still had a lot of fun and learned about Japanese medicine.\n\nI think the important thing is, even without medical insurance, if your GF is suffering she should see someone.  It's no where near as expensive as in the US, even without any medical insurance.  At this point a lot more places take credit cards too, so she shouldn't have to worry and can just work on feeling better.\n\nSometimes, just seeing a doctor and being told what you need to do can help you.  I think seeing someone and hearing it is going to be OK, might cheer her up.  \n\nJapan can be really lonely if she is there by herself.  \n\nI hope she gets the help she needs and if she needs more rest, I think those bus tours sound like a great idea.",

Since she\u2019s going to a pharmacy tell her to look for a compression sleeve / ankle brace or if it\u2019s really bad a cane, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have some there to help with walking, also try to keep her ankle elevated when resting (maybe prop a pillow or two under her foot while in bed), if she\u2019s wanting to explore take small breaks every now and then so she doesn\u2019t overwork her ankle. I really do hope she enjoys her time while she\u2019s there even though she is injured, please let her know that if she needs someone to talk to my DMs on here and insta (same user handle) are always open and I want to hear all about her dream vacation when she\u2019s back home! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

The nearest cat cafe, hedgehog cafe, etc. There are places where you can just chill and people watch. Taking to e to slow down is part of the greater Japanese culture.  Sure, not the Tokyo office worker but overall an appreciation for things is there.  If you slow down you get the cultural immersion part of travel vice the constant site seeing tourist stuff. \n\nI strongly recommend building some itinerary ideas for her. If she's that down she thinks she can't do anything.  Show her the things she can do.",

            "comment": "It seems your gf is depressed. I think the priority is her mental health rather than the physical (yes she can't walk normally but she won't die if her ankle is not fixed right now) and depressed ppl have a tunnel vision of seeing things so you can't reason logically with her.\n\nI am not a professional but i think if she lives alone she needs to leave the hotel room (japan hotel rooms are smaller than normal hotel rooms) and talks to ppl. Even limping and sitting in a cafe all day people watching is better than staying inside a room alone.\n\nIt is the sakura season but too bad the weather seems to be bad right now, otherwise just sitting in the park watching the sakura is possibly one of the best moments in life. \n\nSorry i digress, it is best if you can go to Japan asap to meet her and stay with her, if not, see if any redditers or other volunteers can help. Companionship would be very important right now.\n\nGod bless you and your gf.",

I don\u2019t know the full thing, or her but there\u2019s also a chance she\u2019s just saying that out of the heat of the moment. Not that that should change how you handle it, but she needs someone else is what I\u2019m saying regardless.",

            "comment": "I had a back injury that threatened to ruin a vacation once and they were able to give me some medication at urgent care that helped but it took about two days.  I was able to walk around at least so it was a miracle!  Also, if she is actually suicidal, like she has an actual plan, you need to call emergency services and she needs to go to the hospital.  That sounds like a nightmare in Japan though so hopefully it doesn\u2019t get to that point.  \n\nI also wonder about a tour she could do.  There was a trip report a few days ago from a mobility challenged group and they had scheduled a driving tour and were able to request how much they wanted to get out.  I\u2019ve had the time of my life on those hop on hop off buses.  There are still options for her!  And she should definitely still enjoy the food if there are restaurants that deliver.  Maybe you could get her a gift certificate for that if they do it in Japan.\n\nHang in there.  That is really good you are trying to take care of her even though she\u2019s so far away.  She is very lucky to have you!",

            "comment": "I arrived in Japan on March 18th and I knew something was wrong right away when I got out of the airplane. Either I pulled something or I'm just that weak (fat ish), my calf/knee/leg muscles were in agony. On my first full day, I had two Charley Horse, one on each calf. Luckily for me, I was with my group and my friend helped me out a lot there. Mentally and physically I was so disappointed in myself and I wish I would have done things differently. My group didn't need to say much but they encouraged me by simply waiting for me when I was slow. I think your girlfriend just needs some positive reinforcement.  \n\nWhat helped me was my group didn't care and were willing to wait for my slow ass when we were walking somewhere. I was pretty much limping in pain every single step. I feel like what could help is to go to an. onsen (hot springs) or/even using ice pack or just taking a hot bath at the hotel. Even to this day, my entire leg is sore/tired but it's not as bad as what it was.\n\nI'm actually in a hotel near Akihabara (10 min walk) until the end of the month. Seems like there are many people who offered to help and some of them are women so it's best for you to not ask me for help (am a guy). The only thing that I feel like I can help is I maybe can try to find some things she might be interested in. \n\nI'm a weeb and for my last couple of days, I'm going to all the anime/manga related places, Ikebukuro, Nakano, Shibuya, etc. This is a huge leap of faith if you want my help for this part for both parties. Obviously, no guarantee I would be able to find some things or whether I will have additional space in my luggage. I have my own priorities. \n\nAdditionally, I will keep my receipts and all but I don't think I would be willing to show my credit card statements since I don't want to be paid back in Yen. If you want my assistance in this, you would have to be willing to pay whatever the price (no proof of cost in USD) it cost me and shipping. \n\nI just sympathize with your girlfriend because it happened to me recently. I'm sure her pain is worse than mine but yeah. If you accept, please send me a DM with list and I will try when I have time. Please don't make me regret this. \n\nI hope your girlfriend is doing okay now.",

Either way, she has no one to blame but herself.\n\nIt\u2019s not what she wants to hear but it\u2019s what she needs to hear from you.

If she has mental issues and is suicidal, it's not as easy as decide to make the best out of a sad situation. She needs to feel heard and understood and her discomfort should not be minimized. She needs to talk to a therapist or a psychiatrist and have her ankle fixed and go back home in her comfort zone, and work on her issues for long-term healing so next time she's ready to deal with this kind of situations.",

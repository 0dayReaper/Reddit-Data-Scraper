    "postText": "Hello! I am going to solo travel to Japan from 19 July to 22 August this summer. I am 20 years old and I have never been in Japan before, but I am fascinated by its culture and it's been a dream of mine visiting Japan.\n\nI've put out this itinerary for my trip. I don't have yet an exact idea of what to do each single day specifically, as I want to keep things a bit more flexible and I will have to work remotely during my stay. I'd love to hear some thoughts and suggestions from more experienced travelers, so if you have any, please share!\n\n**Tokyo** \\- 4 days (19 July 20:00 - 22 July)\n\nArrive at Narita Airport at 20:00 Japan time, I'll probably be quite exhausted and I will only eat something and go to my hotel.\nI will come back to Tokyo for 5 more days at the end of my trip.\n\nGeneral things to do and places to visit in Tokyo:\n- Sensoji temple\n- Kagaya bar\n- Akihabara\n- Harajuku\n- Togo shrine\n- Shiba park\n- Zozoji temple\n- Tokyo metropolitan government building\n- Koishikawa Korakuen\n- Side trip to Yokohama\n\n**Hakone** \\- 2 days (23 July - 24 July)\n- Lake Ashinoko\n- Hakone Onsen\n\n**Nagoya** - 3 days (25 July - 27 July)\n- Nagashima Resort\n- Nabana no sato\n- Nagoya castle\n\n**Ise** - 1 day (28 July)\n- Ise Shima\n\n**Nara** - 1 day (29 July)\n- Nara park\n- Todaiji Temple\n\n**Kyoto** - 5 days (30 July - 3 August)\n- Fushimi inari shrine\n- Tenryu-ji temple\n- Gion district\n- Nijo castle\n- Philosopher's Path\n- Kyoto Tower- Enryakuji Temple\n- Kiyomizudera Temple\n- Kinkakuji\n- Ginkakuji\n\n**Osaka** - 5 days (4 August - 8 August)\n- Dotonbori\n- Osaka castle\n- USJ\n- Osaka aquarium\n\n**Himeji** - 1 day (9 August)\n- Himeji Castle\n- Mt Sh\u014dsha\n\n**Okayama** - 2 days (10 August - 11 August)\n- Korakuen Garden\n\n**Hiroshima** - 3 days (12 August - 14 August)\n- Peace Park\n- Itsukushima Shrine\n\n**Kanazawa** - 2 days (15 August - 16 August)\n- Kenrokuen Garden\n\n**Nikko** - 1 day (17 August)\n- Toshogu Shrine\n- Rinnoji Temple\n- Kagon Falls\n- Senjogahara Hiking\n\n**Tokyo** - 5 days (18 August - 22 August)\n- Summer Sonic\n\n\nIf you have anything to add or suggestions, please share!\n\nI assume that for these trips I better get the 21 days Japan Rail Pass and activate it at the end of my initial stay in Tokyo (although it still won't cover the entirety of my trip). Perhaps it's more convenient to buy two 7 days JR pass, activate the 7 days pass at the end of my initial stay in Tokyo and then activate the other at the end of my stay in Kyoto?\n\nLet me know if you think the length of each stay is appropriate and if you have any tips about accommodations, as I still have to look for that.\n\nThanks a lot!",

You can take a bus from Himeji Station to the base. From there you can walk up (about 40 minutes) or take a cable car (\u00a51500 round trip?).\nYou could spend about half a day at each place.",

If you land in Nagoya, why do you go to Tokyo first just to then go back to Nagoya and go again to Tokyo... that make no sense.\n\nHere is what I would do. Start by Nagoya, then go to Ise, Nara, Kyoto, while Osaka is next to Kyoto, save it for later. Himeji, Okayama, Hiroshima, Osaka. The reason to put Osaka here is to avoid wasting a day in the train from Hiroshima to Kanazawa. Kanazawa, Tokyo, day trip to Nikko, overnight trip to Nikko, like check out of Tokyo hotel, ask them to keep your luggage and go back to the same hotel after going to Nikko for a night.\n\nAs for JR Pass, try to calculate first. Having a bad order in your plan will just make it more expensive and it will \"justify\" the JR Pass. The Ise to Nara/Kyoto can be done on Kintetsu train, so check the Kintetsu pass. If you are able to do leave Kyoto and reach Tokyo within 14, that might be better for only 14 days pass, but still calculate and compare to cost of individual tickets. Nikko can be done with Tobu Nikko Pass and Hakone with Odakyu Hakone Free Pass.",

I'd suggest to grab a map and trace your route based on a desired a path. Likewise, those 1 days checkins ... it's way better to choose a base and try to do day trips where it makes sense.\n\n\nHope it helps.",

Adding the trip cost, \\~3650\u20ac, but I'm not sure",

(not a lot of ways to make money matter of fact your gonna have to live there to make money.   but if you have some money saved up and some how manage to snag a ship over to this county. enjoy the small towns then probably leave before you end up with no food. \n\nsome may say i\u2019m wrong and idgaf it\u2019s the hard truth (or sad if you want to call it that). save your money ((or are you not smart enough to do that either)) and just go to the beach or something (way more enjoyable in my opinion)\u2026\n\n\n\nnow to all the anime lovers\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\ngo watch some \u201c\u30c9\u30e9\u3048\u3082\u3093\u201d\n\ni remember watching that as a kid. if you know you know. \n\n\n\n\n\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f",

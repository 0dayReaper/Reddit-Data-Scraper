A few comments \n\n&gt;15:00 - 17:00 - Visit teamLab Borderless (via Yurikamome Line)\r  \n\r  \n17:30 - 18:30 -\r  \n\r  \n19:00 - 22:00 - Daikoku car meet tour  \n\n\nNot too sure what daikoku car meet tour is, but a quick google shows its in yokohama, which is a fair distance away from Tokyo. Do consider the travel time required   \n\n\n&gt;Day 6: Osaka (July 23)\r  \n\r  \n09:00 - 10:00 - Breakfast at the hotel\r  \n\r  \n10:30 - 17:00 - Visit Universal Studios Japan\n\nI would suggest skipping breakfast entirely and heading to USJ earlier. Unless you've been to USJ before or intend on skipping some of the more popular areas of the park such as super mario world, I would advise allocating more time to USJ since they do let people in earlier. This is even if you hold an express pass.   \n\n\n&gt;Day 7: Day trip to Kyoto (July 24)\n\nImho, day 7 is too packed. If this is your first time going to the listed areas, do reconsider and prioritize which places are a 'must see' for you as it is highly unlikely an hour and 30 minutes is enough for the areas you've set. Fushimi Inari in particular will require more time if you intend on hiking and taking lots of pictures.   \nDo you intend on cabbing from Fushumi to Kiyomizu? It is quite an uphill walk to the temple if you're taking local transport, I'd say it takes maybe 45 mins\\~1 hour to reach Kiyomizu from Fushimi.  \nOn the topic of distance, do note Nishiki market to Kinkaku-ji is quite a distance. If you're using regular local transport, it'd take about 45mins\\~1 hour.   \nAlso, Nijo Castle closes at 5pm, iirc the entrance closes at 4pm.  \n\n\nEverything else looks good! Hope you have plenty of fun",

                            "comment": "Two main sightseeing sights in Kyoto would be nice and comfortable, three would be pushing it but doable and four is extremely unfavorable.Thus, as I've mentioned, try and see which places you think are a must for you to visit out of the four (Fushimi, Kiyomizu, Kinkaku &amp; Nijo castle). Simply remove any one of these places from your current schedule and it would be much more feasible.\n\nDo you want to see Kyoto with a stunning overhead view (amongst other things of course)-&gt; Kiyomizu  \nPass through an uncountable number of beautiful tori gates? -&gt; Fushimi (There's a nice view here as a plus, but requires some hiking)  \nBig fan of history/culture and finding beautiful carvings? -&gt; Nijo castle  \nGetting a little biased here, but I can't find any plus point for Kinkaku ji. Of course, the place is beautiful but it's a very confined space with very few spots where you can actually view the temple. Photographs and videos of the place on google are pretty equivalent to what you'd see when you're there, a stark contrast to the other places mentioned above that have hidden perspectives and tiny gems you would not be able to find easily on google.\n\nThat being said, don't let my opinion on kinkaku ji sway you! It ultimately boils down to what you wish to do, but my recommendation on limiting it to just 3 spots still stands. I'd be happy to answer any more doubts =)",

I would get there a lot earlier than 9 am.  We overslept when we went to Sea on the 31st and got to the parks around 9 am, we then waited a good 30-45 minutes just to get in and by then all the Premier Passes for Soaring were long gone and there were limited times for Toy Story Mania.  Disney tends to have shorter lines than USJ, but we're still talking about 180 minute lines.  (We didn't go on Soaring lol)  I am using Sea since I went there more recently, but Land gets very long lines as well, especially for Splash Mountain in the Summer and the new Beauty and the Beast ride.  Heck, you can easily wait 20-30 minutes just for popcorn because it's a huge thing there.\n\nI agree with u/Toxic__Apple, you want to get to USJ WAAAAAAAY before 10:30 am.  you're going on a Sunday and if school vacation isn't when you arrive, it will be school vacation on the 24th!  I expect the parks will be packed and even if express passes you want to be there early.\n\nGood luck!",

I think it might be the busiest time of day for nishiki\n\ngoing to kinkakuji, nah, thats 45mins, not 30. 1.25h for kinkakuji will be fine\n\nhalf an hour to get to nijojo, fair, last entry is 4pm, and they will close at 5pm. to get there before 4, you need to take the 3:20 bus (12) from kinkakuji, so more like leave kinkakuji at 3:15 at the latest\n\nyour dinner and tower is fine.\n\nNow, I cant say you cant do this day like that. but I wouldnt want to try. honestly, if you only got one day in kyoto, maybe forget nijojo and possibly also nishiki. thats still full all things considered, and a lot of time wasted traveling all over kyoto, but you still could spend more time in higashiyama which is a lovely place to be in kyoto. to do so, head to kinkakuji after fushimi and then head to kiyomizudera\n\nand about being lucky. \n\nif you know kyoto and the bus system planing to take a bus # at a certain stop at a certain time and walk to where you wanna go, you can do so in the time that it should take\n\nif you dont know kyoto, you will be searching for the bus station. you will either head to the bus stop way before you need to, or you will miss a bus. you will take a bus going the wrong way. you will take a bus on street 186. or during rush hour. and the bus will sit in traffic and you will miss your connecting bus.  \n\nwhen google map says you need 25minutes from a to b, then that is a best case scenario. and you need a lot of luck to get that if you are struggling with the public transport system.  \nheck, even I need to make sure I take the correct bus, dont get stuck in traffic, and make my connections...\n\nand I did not see anyone else mention it. if the other days are just as tight as kyoto, that means you will be going more or less nonstop. thats a lot on your feet/walking. in juli. I think it is very possible that your body wont even have the stamina to do your day 7 on day 7.\n\nwell, good luck",

I dont know what you are most looking for. also, while being inefficient, hitting fushimi, kinkakuji and higashiyama with more exploring to do in higashiyama, maybe with an evening in gion (which might not work when you need to go to osaka) is pretty much hitting all the high notes in one day. of course there are others, but you need to make compromises.",

There's no set time for when the car meet is going to stop but that was it for us a couple weeks ago so be aware you can't plan that in. We also rented a car to go (partner very into the car scene) so you'll want to factor that in as there's no public transport there. Taxis are possible but some can be picky with having foreigners.\n\nIt's personal preference with how into anime/weeby culture you are but I wouldn't say 2 hours in Akihabara is enough. You can spend half hour to an hour just in Yodobashi Camera without reaching the anime shops! Den Den Town is similar although you probably would be fine with just 2 hours as it is smaller.\n\nFor me I found making a visual map of where I'm planning to go made it a bit easier to figure out what I can do in one area. I'm sure there's some better options but I used the Google My Maps feature to mark down where I'm going and that helped put in perspective the plans. It's a little tricky to use though but it would help you especially trying to fit in everything see visually what can be done and in what order.",

Will give Google My Maps a try",

Especially since you\u2019re going right back to Tokyo the next day to catch the Shinkansen?  Yokohama is easily do-able as a day trip from Tokyo.\n\nAgree with the others about revising Kyoto.  I would recommend starting at Fushimi Inari, going to Kiyomizu-dera, walking around Higashiyama, and then heading up to Nanzen-ji and doing the Philosopher\u2019s walk for a bit.",

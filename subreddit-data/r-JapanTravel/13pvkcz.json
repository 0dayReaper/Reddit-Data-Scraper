    "postText": "Hi guys! Been researching and fixing up our trip, but not sure if the routes I placed are the most sensible and if my sched is too tight.\n\nPreferences - skipping Mt Fuji since we\u2019re going on July and we probably won\u2019t see it anyway. My girlfriend prefers the urban vs going to temples or parks. Disneyland, Ghibli and Harry Potter are what she\u2019s most excited about. \n\nTo me, I want to ideally have a more chill and loose itinerary, but also don\u2019t want to miss out on the must sees. Lastly, I made the itinerary thinking our trip is too short to plan anything outside Tokyo. Day trip reccos would be good too if it fits :)\n\nThanks!\n\nNote: Asterisks are the spots I feel either don\u2019t make sense in the itinerary, or I\u2019m not too interested in\n\nITINERARY\n\n1- (In Tokyo by 2PM)\n\nShibuya - Shibuya Crossing, Yoyogi Park*, Shibuya Sky (before sunset)*, Hachiko, Pokemon Center, Mega Donki, Nonbei Yokocho\n\nShinjuku - Kabukichon, Omoide Yokocho\n\n2- \n\nAsakusa - Kaminarimon Gate, Sensoji Temple\n\nUeno - Ameyoko, Ueno Park, Ameyokocho\n\n3- \n\nTokyo Disneyland\n\n4- \n\nGhibli Museum, Legoland\n\nTsukiji Fish Market\n\nChuo-dori*\n\nOdaiba*\n\nAkihabara*\n\n5- \n\nWarner Bros Tokyo\n\nShibuya - Meiji Shrine, Takeshita St*, Harajuku, Tokyu Plaza*\n\n6- (Leaving Tokyo 7PM)\n\nKichijoji*\n\nKoenji*\n\nShinjuku\n\nCurrently booked in Shinjuku.",

            "comment": "I recommend putting these locations onto a map, because you are kind of all over the place.\n\nFor instance:\n\nYou have Ghibli Museum and Legoland grouped together when they are on total opposite ends of the city. 1.5 hours by (multiple) train. Legoland is in Odaiba, but you have Odaiba as an asterisked place on the same day.\n\nKichijoiji is right next to Ghibli, but you have it on a different day.\n\nI think you have way too much going on on Day 1, too.",

            "comment": "In general I recommend skipping Parks... As nice as some of them are you don't typically get the feeling that \"I can only get this view here and nowhere else.  Plus you are going in July.  Opt for spots with AC instead of humid heat at a park.\n\nUnless Disneyland is a must go for you, I'd suggest DisneySea instead.  It's cater for older audience and it's one of a kind.  You have Disneyland all over the world, and to me they are similar.  Same with Legoland Discovery Centers they are all over the world too.\n\nCheck out my post that I posted yesterday. I organized my trip by Tokyo area.  Funny your Day 4 looks similar to one of my days but I am doing Ghibli in the morning have lunch somewhere then TeamLab in the afternoon, and Odaiba in the evening.  For Ghibli museum, be ready to have a backup plan.  The reservation process is atrocious - - I could not get a spot using the standard foreign visitor process.  Luckily I didn't give up and manage to secure a spot using the Japanese Lawson process (everything in Japanese).\n\nIf 2 to 3 days of Shibuya/Harajuku is too much, you can consider a day trip to Yokohama.  It's only 30 minutes away.",

It's also a \"discovery centre\" meaning it's more like a children's play centre/video game arcade.\n\nThe proper Legoland theme park is in Nagoya. It doesn't have the same restrictions but it's attractions are heavily designed with children in mind.",

This was the case for the square enix cafe and the Kirby cafe, possibly the Pok\u00e9mon one too.\n\nAppointments open up on like the 10th of the month before at 10am Japan time. Do some research for details. For example if you are going in July then book on the 10th June.",

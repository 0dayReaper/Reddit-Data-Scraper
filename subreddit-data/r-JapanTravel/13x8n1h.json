    "postText": "I stumbled across a flight redemption to Japan (35k points economy United) for August 8th. So I'm just starting to plan now, I ran a prompt through GPT asking what should I do and thought I would ask you guys for other suggestions. I'm not firm with a day to day schedule yet so I'm more so interested in just a list of places you recommend/ amount of days to stay in the city, if possible.\n\nI'm also curious do you think USJ/ Disney Sea is worth it? Ill be going with my girlfriend our interest rank as\n\n1. FOOD\n2. Nature\n3. Anime\n\nThis is what the robot overlords suggested let me know what you guys think! I can already tell you days 25-30 are a bit unrealistic. Our original plan was 3 weeks so im not sure what to do with the extra days at the end... Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Arrive early, go to the places you wanna see, head back to your onsen and relax, eat, and maybe go see some other stuff, and then the next day you can go look see anything else you want to do. If you just wanna wind down, then by all means stay for three days and enjoy the onsens.",

So if you don't have a strong interest in going then you may walk away frustrated.\n\nHakone - There isn't a lot to do there so 3 days might be 1 day too much unless you are happy to just sit and relax.\n\nKyoto/Nara/Osaka - You have around 9 days here which feels long based on what you have. There are a lot of days trips you can do but maybe consider adding another stop.\n\nHokkaido - After Hiroshima go straight to Hokkaido instead of via Tokyo. You should be able to fly there from Hiroshima or Osaka.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s looks like most of your itineraries are outdoor, while it\u2019s good for general time of the year but August is going to be humid and hot as hell, it will hover around 33-35 at peak, while average day not lower than 30\u2103. \n\nSo my advice is to exclude any long outdoor activities and put some balance for indoor + nature (forest, mountain etc). For example, you don\u2019t have to go to Disneyland / USW, not only august a summer vacation, which means insane crowd, and it\u2019s going to be very hot and you may not enjoy the experience. Look for more summer activities is my best advice.\n\nFor Kyoto, tbh you itinerary can be done in a day. I have a day trip to Kyoto before, and managed to visit most of the hot temples and shire, excluding Arashiyama. I think if you do not want to be that rush, 2 full days should be more than enough for your Kyoto itinerary. Same for Hakone too.\n\n\n Also, shades shades shades. Many foreigner underestimate Japan\u2019s summer heat and ending up not enjoying their stay because they are less prepared. Bring hat, sunscreen, sunglasses, buy some cold spray and a tumbler to store cold water.",

Find the rock bar Mother in Kabukicho. \n\nShinjuku Pit Inn does afternoon \"jazz\" it's like 1000 yen and you get a free drink, it will be unique if not good, usually very experimental that time of day.\n\nDon't be afraid to explore up several levels in buildings, it gets cooler/weirder the higher you go oftentimes. Shibuya especially has some strange things on like the 10th floor just go poke around.\n\nHave no fear, use your gaijin card, play dumb and you can go anywhere until they stop you. \n\nDon't follow the touts to any bars obviously but do engage them in conversation they're often quite fascinating.",

Hard to put a finger on why. It felt like there wasn\u2019t a lot of life. Lots of food stalls were not open, some rides were still closed from the Covid era, and overall it didn\u2019t feel like there was a lot of life. \n\n- USJ was a lot of fun for Super Nintendo World alone. Also did Harry Potter World briefly and enjoyed it. Ride a couple other rides.\n\nGlad I did both but I preferred USJ.",

Kanazawa is also great. \n\nBeing up there and seeing the mountains drenched in clouds and going through all the post towns with little to no other tourists was the best thing I've ever done in Japan. I went to Kyoto for the first time in about 8 years directly afterwards and was shocked at the amount of people everywhere (still a must see!) but I could barely handle it there.",

    "postText": "Date of travel: Apr 07\\~22, 2023\n\n**Background -**\n\nI\u2019ve been to Japan twice before but my husband had never been. So I chose the most popular first-time route in Japan. He\u2019s a big Pokemon fan and got into Gundam last year so most of our time in Tokyo were planned around these two things. Our budget is around $7k (since it\u2019s our honeymoon we don\u2019t mind spend a little more) and ended up spending about that amount.\n\n**Tips -**\n\n1. Most hotels won\u2019t let you check in before 3pm (we were only 30 mins early and still needed to wait until 3pm) but they do store your luggage.\n2. Use Yamato Transport to deliver your large luggage to the next hotel when you travel between cities. It\u2019s pretty cheap (around $20 for big luggage from Kyoto to Tokyo) and saves the trouble of carrying it around the subway. Your current hotel or 7-eleven usually can help you fill in the form.\n3. Temples &amp; shrines in Japan close pretty early (about 4-5pm) so plan accordingly.\n4. Restaurants in Kyoto also close really early, we had a hard time finding good restaurants after 8pm near our hotel (Omiya/Shijo). Try book hotel near Shijo/Karasuma or Kawaramachi, might be easier there.\n5. Good restaurants always have lines, try get there before lunch/dinner time to avoid waiting.\n6. Google map is enough for getting around. Pay attention to the platform information for navigating through the station.\n7. Coin &amp; cash was essential and you can spend the leftover at convenient stores or at the airport.\n8. Like many other posts say, bring small trash bags with you. It's hard to find trash cans.\n9. I brought my water bottle but didn\u2019t use it once\u2026 Several hotels gave us free bottled water every day. Plus, the drink &amp; snack in convenient stores were too attractive to just drink plain water! Be sure to check FamilyMart/Lawson/7-11, they are awesome.\n\n**Pre-travel -**\n\n1. Since my husband\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t support e-sim, we decided to rent a portable wifi. Got it from ivideo for $41 (including $8 shipping fee to our first hotel in Osaka) for a month (100G, no daily limit). It\u2019s pretty light and also came with an extra battery, which was extremely helpful. We usually drain the first battery around 3pm and just switch to the other one. The connection was great, we had no trouble throughout the trip except for some Mt Fuji areas. And at the end we used 53G in total.\n2. I installed Tabelog app. I\u2019m Chinese so I can read the majority of the food category &amp; store name &amp; basic info (mostly in Kanji) on there. Very helpful to find food nearby &amp; if they are open &amp; if they need reservation. It also has an English web version but the app version is way better.\n3. I researched extensively and made many reservations/tix, including restaurants, performance, buses &amp; trains. Will point those out in the itinerary.\n\n**Itinerary (very long and detailed\u2026) -**\n\n**Day 0 - LAX to Haneda (arriving at 3pm), then to ITM**\n\nWe got the United/ANA flight that only has 90 mins layover at Haneda, in which we need to get through the immigration &amp; custom, get luggage, go to Terminal 2, re-check the luggages and get throughs security again. I thought for sure we wouldn\u2019t be able to make it but somehow we did\u2026 with extra time to buy some Tokyo banana lol. The process was super smooth and the staff at the airport were very helpful. But definitely don\u2019t recommend to have such a short layover.\n\n**---------------------------- Osaka ----------------------------**\n\n**Day 1 - Arriving in Osaka**\n\nTook the airport limousine bus to hotel. Went to Dotonbori for food. It\u2019s great if your hotel is walking distance to Dotonbori, so easy to get food at night!\n\n**Day 2 - Cherry Blossom Street &gt; Osaka Castle &gt; Umeda &gt; Dotonbori**\n\nWe adjusted to the time difference pretty easily. Didn\u2019t have any problem sleeping or waking up.\n\nIn the morning we went to the Japanese Mint Bureau Cherry Blossom street (free, pre-registered). More than 100 sakura trees on one street. It opens one week a year (date posted in March) and you can register timeslot through the Japanese page. Great place to visit for some late cherry blossom.\n\nThen we walked to Osaka Castle. Umeda area in the afternoon to see Pokemon Center &amp; Nintendo Store. We regret not buying anything at Pokemon Center Osaka because among the 5 PC we visited this one had the best inventory. So if you\u2019re a Pokemon fan, don\u2019t hesitate if you see anything you like! Late afternoon back to Dotonbori area and enjoy walking around all the fun little streets.\n\nGood Food: Unagi bowl at Igaki near Osaka Castle. Harbs cake at B1 of Daimaru.\n\n**Day 3 - Namba Yasaka Jinja &gt; Nara one-day trip**\n\nWe walked to Namba Yasaka Jinja in the morning since it\u2019s not far from the hotel. Pretty small shrine but has an interesting lion-head building (which swallow evil spirits plaguing you). Then on our way to Nara. I recommend taking Kintetsu to Nara, their station is closer to the attractions. Our route was Kofuku-ji &gt; Kasuga-taisha &gt; Wakakusayama &gt; Todai-ji. You can pretty much walk to all the spots.\n\nGood Food: Japanese BBQ at Torachan Hozanjiyokocho, Dotonbori. Good quality with decent price.\n\n**Day 4 - Universal Studio Japan**\n\nWe mostly went for Nintendo World. I got the tix beforehand with guaranteed Nintendo World Entrance on KKday but it only allows us to enter around 1pm. We arrived at Universal around 8:30 am and got the timed Entry tickets (for 10:30 am) through their app pretty easily. It was the right choice because we spent our whole day there. Wristband is a must-have! We borrowed my friends\u2019 wristbands and played all the related games. Also enjoyed the cute food at Kinopio\u2019s Cafe (need to get timeslot ticket at the door).\n\nGood Food: Yakisoba &amp; Okonomiyaki at Fukutaro Nippombashi.\n\n**---------------------------- Kyoto ----------------------------**\n\n**Day 5 - Transit to Kyoto, Kamo River &gt; Kennin-ji Temple &gt; Miyako Odori**\n\nGot to Kyoto around noon and went for lunch. Wandered along the Kamo river afterwards. Then walked to Hanamikoji Street. There\u2019s a very quiet and beautiful temple (Kennin-ji Temple) at the end of the street without many tourists. Worth a visit if you\u2019re at the area. Then it\u2019s time for the Miyako Odori show. It\u2019s a 1hr Geisha dance performance held only in April. I booked the tickets beforehand but it\u2019s probably okay to purchase it onsite. We rented the English guidance machine to better understand what\u2019s going on, which was very helpful.\n\nGood Food: Sukiyaki at Moritaya Kiyamachi (pre-booked), highly recommend! The food was great but the experience was the best. You eat in a traditional Japanese room with waitress in kimono cooking the sukiyaki. It was very peaceful just sitting in the room.\n\n**Day 6 - Yasaka Shrine &gt; Maruyama Park &gt; Higashi Hongan-ji**\n\nIt\u2019s our kimono rental day but it was also raining a lot\u2026 So pretty short day for us. Basically just wandered around (which I think is the best way to tour in Kyoto, if the weather\u2019s good!).\n\n**Day 7 - Kinkaku-ji &gt; Kitano Tenmangu &gt; Arashiyama**\n\nKinkaku-ji is beautiful but it\u2019s only about an hour of walking-around. Took a bus to JR and ride to Umahori Station (not JR Kameoka!). Walked to the Torokko Kameoka station and got on our Sagano Romantic Train to Arashiyama. I booked the ticket beforehand on JR West website just in case, but I think you can get the ticket at the station if it\u2019s not peak season. The scenery along the way was awesome!\n\nWhen arrived at Arashiyama station, we walked through the bamboo forest to the Arashiyama Main Street. Had lunch and enjoyed a nice little walk on Togetsu-kyo Bridge. Then we went to Tenryu-ji, beautiful temple with a big gorgeous garden. Walked a little more near the bridge to take in the scenery. Then ride Randen back to hotel.\n\n**Day 8 - Kiyomizu-dera &gt; Nineizaka/Sanneizaka &gt; Rengeoin Sanjusangendo &gt; Tofuku-ji &gt; Fushimi Inari Taisha**\n\nMore temples &amp; shrines! Highly recommend Sanjusangendo, which has 1000 buddha statues in it. It\u2019s astounding. And of course Fushimi Inari Taisha is a must-visit for first-time visitors.\n\nGood Food: Kobe beef teppanyaki at Mouriya Gion (need reservation). Again, like sukiyaki, the experience was awesome: the chef cooks in front of you on the iron surface. My husband loves steak and he said this (A5 Kobe sirloin) is the best he had ever had.\n\n**---------------------------- Mt Fuji ----------------------------**\n\n**Day 9 - Shinkansen to Tokyo &gt; Senso-ji**\n\nWe got non-reserved Shinkansen ticket and had no trouble finding seats (car 1-3 are for non-reserved). It was pretty empty on a Saturday morning. Unfortunately it was raining hard all the way from Kyoto to Tokyo this day. We walked to Senso-ji, took a look, had some food and went back directly to hotel.\n\nGood Food: Shaved ice at Asakusa Naniwaya (they can customize the flavor)\n\n**Day 10 - Bus to Kawaguchiko &gt; Cable car to Tenjozan Park &gt; Boat &gt; Kukuna Hotel**\n\nFor Fujikawaguchiko, I booked two onsen hotels 2 months before our travel date (because the good ones are hard to book!) and can only hope that the weather would be good on those days. Extremely lucky for us, we got 10/10 visibility on Mt Fuji on both days. If you are flexible on your day to Fuji, check [https://fuji-san.info/en/index.html](https://fuji-san.info/en/index.html) for the visibility forecast.\n\nGot to Kawaguchiko, walked alongside the lake to the cable car station. The cable car ride was short but the view at Tenjozan Park was awesome. We spent two hours just appreciating the beauty of Mt Fuji. Then we ride the cable car down and went on the sightseeing boat ride. I don\u2019t recommend it much\u2026 About 20 mins but similar view.\n\nThen we walked back to our hotel Kukuna and checked in. It\u2019s not the best onsen hotel but when you open the automatic curtain, Fujisan is right there! The view is just impeccable. I booked the 2 meal + 1 night stay option. The food was good too. Dinner is courses (rather small portion but nice presentation) + buffet and breakfast is buffet. Also, their public outdoor hot spring was great! Good temperature with nice view of Fuji. Go early in the morning to avoid crowd if you\u2019re shy and don\u2019t want to be naked in front of strangers:)\n\n**Day 11 - Music Forest Museum &gt; Oishi Park &gt; Wakakusa-no-yado-Maruei Hotel**\n\nWe got lazy from all the hot springs and resting and nice food. So we didn\u2019t do much this day\u2026 Just went to the music box museum and Oishi Park. The museum has some impressive automatic music instrument, check out the organ hall performance if you\u2019re there.\n\nWe changed a hotel for this night because I want to have a more traditional Japanese style experience too. In this hotel we got Kaiseki for dinner &amp; breakfast (consists of multiple small portion food) and slept on tatami. Again, not the best onsen hotel but decent experience.\n\n**---------------------------- Tokyo ----------------------------**\n\n**Day 12 - Back to Tokyo &gt; Akihabara**\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel we took the bus back to Tokyo and started our nerdy part of the trip. My husband loves Akihabara, all the stores selling trading cards and toys and random electric cords. For this day we mostly wandered around and see what\u2019s there.\n\nGood Food: Soba ramen at Tanaka Ramen near Akihabara.\n\n**Day 13 - Teamlab Planets &gt; Kawasaki Robostage &gt; Gundam Base Tokyo**\n\nOdaiba area day. Teamlab Planets need book tickets beforehand. It was cool but I wish the ticket was cheaper. It was shorter &amp; smaller than I expected (two rooms were under maintenance when we visited). Then we took bus to Odaiba park. Walked around and went to Kawasaki Robostage, which is a small exhibition place for robots. Unfortunately there were a group of students in there so we couldn\u2019t get in. Still, seems cool looking from outside! Then we went to Gundam base finally. Husband\u2019s happy shopping time while I wandered to Uniqlo. And don\u2019t forget the Unicorn outside. Be sure to check the showtime! During daytime the gap is long. The performance was not that impressive though\u2026 compared to the moving Gundam in Yokohama.\n\nGood Food: Omakase at Manten Sushi (need reservation). Good sushi for good price (about $50 per person for about 24 different things).\n\n**Day 14 - Pokemon Cafe &gt; Imado Shrine &gt; Senso-ji &gt; Gundam Factory Yokohama**\n\nPokemon Cafe is the one place you NEED to reserve, a month exactly before your visit date. I stayed up til 2am PST (6pm JST) to get the reservation. And it\u2019s definitely worth it! Food was so-so but looked cute. Near the end of our timeslot (90 mins), Pikachu chef came out to greet the customers and danced. It was extremely cute. The merch sold in Pokemon Cafe was not sold in the pokemon center, so be sure to check it out before you leave. We were surprised that the Pokemon Center DX next door has no Pikachu plush\u2026\n\nAfterwards we went to Imado Shrine (lucky cat shrine) and Senso-ji to get some souvenir. Then we rode the Asakusa line to Yokohama. There was another pokemon center in Yokohama in the mall right outside the station. So we went to check it out. Still, not much difference from the DX. Extremely low stock on Pikachu. We got to Yokohama Gundam Factory about 5pm so we can see the performance both in daylight and at night. That was such an impressive show. It gave me goosebumps even though I\u2019ve never watched a Gundam show. Be sure to check out all the different shows. All of them are great.\n\n**Day 15 - Ikebukuro &gt; Shibuya**\n\n2 more pokemon center today and we didn\u2019t see any pikachu plush! Seriously?\n\nChecked out the Shibuya crossing and just walked around to do some shopping.\n\n**Day 16 - Akihabara again for final shopping**\n\nFinal day of shopping. For Gundam, recommend Surugaya Akihabara Plastic Model Hall. There were two Surugaya stores right by each other. One of them had very good inventory of Gundam (according to my husband). Also Otachu No.4 shop (specialized in Gundam), good selection. Sadly we still didn\u2019t find MGEX Strike Freedom in any store:(\n\nLeft around 4pm for our 9pm flight from HND.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Coming back -**\n\nIn post-travel sadness\u2026 I miss all the cute dessert/snack in the convenient stores! All the good food. Akihabara. All the tranquil temples (that had few visitors). And the super polite staff at the airport/store/hotel. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll go back to Japan again sometime and I can\u2019t wait for it!",

It was very very cool, especially at night with all the lights on. Their store only has exclusives though so not many options.\n\nFor buying options, Gundam base at Odaiba of course has good stuff. Otachu Akiba No.4 ([https://twitter.com/otachu\\_akiba4](https://twitter.com/otachu_akiba4)) is great. They post their new inventory on twitter a lot so it's easy to check. And Surugaya Akihabara, they have several stores there, only one of them has great selection.\n\nOtherwise, depending on the timing, I heard Yodobashi Akihabara sometimes has good options but we didn't see any...",

That's it! \n\nWe sent it on the 15th and I think the tracking showed it arrived in Tokyo on the 16th. So max 1-2 days btw Kanto/Kaisai. We were away to Mt fuji for a few extra days so I asked to deliver on the 18th on the form. It was held at their Tokyo store and got delivered on time. I think they don't work on Sunday though so that might make it slower.",

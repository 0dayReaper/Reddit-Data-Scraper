We arrived quite late the first day (like 6-7pm to our Airbnb) so we grabbed some food in a Japanese BBQ place called Kite-Ya and that was really tasty. Then walked to the memorial peace park at night. We went back in the day to go to the museum but glad we saw it of an evening - much quieter and a different vibe about it, very humbling. So in the day, we arrived at the museum (part of it is closed due to refurbishment) but we still saw and read loads about the atomic bomb so I'd recommend spending about an hour or so there. It was 200 yen per person. Before that we got some pastries at a little bakery called Roti - very nice. But similar to all the other bakeries we saw so I'd check at least one of them out for food if you're low on time! \n\nWe headed to Miyajima at around 12:30 and stayed there until about 8pm. We arrived at the island, got loads of water, than began the hike up Mt Misen. It said about 90 mins but with the heat and having to stop now and again it was about 2.5 hours total. It's better to see the torii gate (above in photo) at high tide so we hiked the mountain first and came down at about 5pm and watched the sunset / ate. \n\nWe also went to an arcade in the mall at Hiroshima in the night - very weird and fun! We played Mario kart and some other fun arcade games, and fairly cheap. Can't recommend much else as we just didn't have the time but really enjoyed what we did do there. ",

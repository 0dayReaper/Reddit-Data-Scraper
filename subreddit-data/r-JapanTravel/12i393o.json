    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m leaving for Japan with my parents (70s) in two days and am still trying to figure out our options for a day trip from Kyoto. I do have an itinerary for Osaka, but I\u2019d like to give my parents one or two other options. They\u2019re good walkers, but we\u2019ll avoid mountainous hikes and we\u2019ll probably walk 5-6 miles per day. We don\u2019t speak Japanese, but I know a few key travel phrases and I have always relied on the kindness of strangers (and the power of Google translate). They aren\u2019t interested in onsens. With those guidelines in mind, where would you recommend we go?\n\nAlso, if you\u2019ve been to Kurashiki would you recommend it? How long did you spend there?",

Fushimi Inari would be the easier walk of the two with the hike up the mountain calibrated to only going as far as you feel up to. This was one of my trip highlights. Nara was a very nice town with feeding the deer and an impressive Buddha at Todai-ji.",

            "comment": "I don't know if you have it on your Osaka itinerary yet, but Himeji Castle is very easily accessible by train. It has some very steep stairs inside, but even just staying on the outside of the castle and checking out the beautiful gardens is worth it! We got there early and registered for the English tour.\n\nYou can even stop for some Kobe beef in Kobe on the way back. There's a \"mall\" near the Shin-Kobe station that has tons of Kobe beef restaurants, and if you go for lunch, it's much more affordable.",

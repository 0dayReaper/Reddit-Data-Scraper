    "postText": " \u200bI am traveling solo to Japan for the first time this weekend. I am 29F and Hard of Hearing. I require lipreading to understand speech, so I cannot understand people wearing masks at all.\u00a0\n\nI think I will be mostly covered using Google Translate to write out I am Deaf, but I am wondering how willing people in Japan would be to write out what they need to say to me. I would ideally just hand them my phone to type what they are saying in japanese (in the translate app) or English, but due to what i am reading about etiquette in Japan, i do not believe they would be willing to do that.\u00a0\n\nI am mostly worried about issues going through immigration and customs when I arrive at KIX. I am wondering if the immigration officials will be difficult like in other countries and not helpful with my disability. This is my first time traveling internationally since 2019, so I have never had to deal with the abundance of masks in a non English-majority speaking country.\u00a0\n\nIs there anyone else on here that is Deaf/HoH, or with speech/auditory disabilities that have figured out the best way to communicate in Japan? Any relevant advice from Hearing folks is also welcome.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance!",

Most japanese will know the symbol. \nMind you that facemasks are not required in japan anymore, so more and more people are walking around without a face mask. But seeing as japanese speak/pronounciate english words diffrently reading lips will not help. \n\nFor communicating I would print a card with \" I am deff please write your respons\" and hand over you phone with google translate or similar.",

English menus so you can just point, for example. \n\nAs you said, I think it's a good idea to have something pre-translated by Google translate that says you cannot hear. Maybe have a whole set of \"flashcards\" on your phone premade with phrases that will probably be useful. \n\nThe fact that you are hard of hearing, does that also affect your ability to speak? Then certainly you will have to have some ready-made flashcards for useful phrases. \n\nWhat airline are you flying with? I see that ANA provides assistance at the airport for those with various conditions including being hard of hearing or deaf. It also mentions and shows an example of communication boards that are at immigration and security  \n\nhttps://www.ana.co.jp/en/jp/guide/flight_service_info/assist/hearing/",

I wear hearing aids, but largely rely on lip reading to understand speech. \n\nI did have the idea to have some flashcards made with a few key phrases in japanese. Thanks for reminding me of that idea. \n\nI'm flying with JAL Airlines.

Looks like they can help you. \n\nhttps://order.jal.co.jp/request/en/hearing?country=ar\n\nI'm sure you'll have a great time in Japan. All of the train platforms in the cities have electronic sign boards that give information in Japanese and English. On the trains themselves, there are also electronic signs in English above the doors that tell you which station is coming up etc. \n\nLots of money was spent to prepare for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics that never materialized. At least the money on infrastructure for transportation was of lasting benefit. \n\nJust make sure you look both ways before you cross the street. Some drivers try to run a red light and you might not hear.",

This worked very well for my friend, who has odd allergies and doesn't speak a word of Japanese.\n\nPerhaps you could do something similar? When you need to talk to someone, show them the card so they know what's up. Maybe have it written that you require the other person to either remove their mask or write things down. You could carry around a notepad and pen for this purpose.\n\nPeople using translation apps is pretty common, too. It would not be rude to communicate this way. I did this at a train station when there were issues with my Suica card (I have very basic Japanese ability but this subject was far beyond what I can manage lol). The station staff also used a translation app because it was beyond her English ability.",

They\u2019ve had type-to-translate gizmos for decades, so I\u2019d think people would be willing to help so long as everyone is patient.  \n\nAlso, the cities are very disability-friendly. There are guides on almost all the sidewalks for those who are blind, kneeling busses, wheelchair friendly like 95% of places I\u2019ve been.

I remember my first trips to Japan where I didn't know any Japanese and honestly you can easily get by with the good ol finger point to what you want. No one is really going to bother having much conversation with you as a tourist. Handing your phone and writing things down I think you'll find to be a complete waste of time once you're in Japan unless it's a pre-planned situation that you know is super important (i.e allergies). \n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you can tell someone is trying to have some in depth conversation you can easily mime pointing to your ear and doing the \"X\" with your arms after if you can't hear/understand anything and they'll back off. But really most of what people will say to you is just spiels you don't really need to answer for. Just point to what you need, take it, and go. Or handover your passport when checking in, take it, and go. Most tourist based stuff is really fool proof to accommodate for language barrier. Foods have visuals and so forth. Unless you're like in some super non-touristy area that isn't even able to accommodate your basic language barrier anyways you should have no problem.\n\nI didn't really talk much on my first few trips and even after becoming conversational I still didn't bother talking much and again most of what is said is just trivial spiels that they HAVE to say but never saying anything worthy of listening to but that's just me.",

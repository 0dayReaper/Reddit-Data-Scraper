I would also warn you that unless you (and the other 5 people in your group) are absolute temple fanatics, I don't think you will enjoy seeing more than 2-3 temples per day, especially not multiple days in a row. The day in Nara for example, Todaiji is great, but you don't need to see 6 temples in one day, especially not if you just did like 4 in Kyoto on the day before. I would try get some more variety in the itinerary.",

            "comment": "I was just in Japan with a group of 6, four adults and two small kids, and I think a few of the big things this itinerary isn\u2019t accounting for are:\n(1) Travel between locations is going to take longer than anticipated. Google maps may say it takes an hour to get from Osaka to Arashiyama but that\u2019s only if you don\u2019t get lost in the train station, make every train connection. I\u2019m not sure the physical shape of your mother but if you need an elevator this is going to more time, so anticipate 1.25-1.5x the anticipated time to travel between places.\n(2) Meals with a group of 6 isn\u2019t easy, a lot of places will have 30-40 min waits especially around meal times for larger groups. \n(3) Your itinerary factors in a lot of travel and walking, I hope your group is prepared for 6-8+ miles of walking a day.\n(4) Kyoto and Nara are just a little too ambitious, you just won\u2019t enjoy yourselves if you\u2019re rushing from place to place. I would either move things around or limit Kyoto to the 2-3 things that you really want to see. In Kyoto, Arashiyama, Fushimi Inari, Kiyimizudera, and Kinkakuji are each pretty much half day activities especially if you want to take the time to enjoy them. Sure you can rush through them respectively just to say you\u2019ve been there but you\u2019ll be defeating the point of visiting them. In Nara, I\u2019d limit the temples as well, I would recommend Kofukuji, Kasuga Taisha, and Todaiji, I think this is reasonable.",

            "comment": "I think for 6 people with elderly renting a car is better because it is much cheaper and more convenience for the elder people. I was visited Japan with similar itinerary in December with a group of 3 people and my mother also in a similar age. What I did was renting a car to drive from Kansai Airport, Kyoto, Takayama, Shirakawa-go, Nagano, Fuji, Nagoya, Nara then comeback to Osaka. My trip started from 7 December to 13 December. I was landing on 6 December at 9 PM and departing from Japan on 14 December at the morning.",

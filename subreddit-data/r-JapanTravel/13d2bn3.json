Plan is: Land, spend two days in Tokyo before heading to Kyoto, which will be our \"base\" for 8 days, then back to Tokyo for the rest of the trip. Crossing fingers that we can get our JR Pass before the price hike! \n\nTo do a lot of the things we want to in the Kansai region we scheduled about 8 days and later on we'll be going to Yokohama too so we thought it better to get the 14 day JR pass. Everywhere we're staying has luggage storage. \n\nWould love to know if what we have is doable, need to modify a little or even if there's places highly recommended we should try and fit in on days that may be lighter. \n\n\nDay 1| \n---|\nLand in Japan (Haneda) \u2013 2:00 PM|\nCheck-in Hotel| \nShinjuku \u2013 Gyoen, Golden Gai, Kabukicho| \n---|\n**Day 2  \u2013**|\n All Day- Shibuya (Crossing, Nintendo Store, Disney store, etc.) and Harajuku(Meiji Shrine, explore) |\n---|\n**Day 3  \u2013**|\nTravel to Kyoto in the morning.

            "comment": "A day in West side of Tokyo sample plan.\n\nTokyo resident here. I posted for the other a few days ago. So will post here for you too.\nIn your case, Day 2.\n\nIt is easy to put together west side of tokyo.\n\nLike this\n\n1.Meiji shrine\n\nGet off Yamanote line at Yoyogi station\n\nGo to Meiji shrine from west exit of station to nearest entrance. Do not use google map \u201cMeiji jingu\u201d\n\nUse it heading \u201cMeiji jingu Kitasando torii\u201d Through the torii(Gate) follow the road to center of Meiji jingu. (15 minutes walk from station. Meiji jingu is HUGE)\n\nThey have many entrance and each one a mile apart. Google map seems to direct you far side gate.\n\n2.Harajuku\n\nFrom center of Meiji jingu, you heading another gate to exit \u201cHarajuku guchi\u201d when you exit, Harajuku station is in front of you. So you can easily go to Harajuku Takeshitadori.\n\n3.Shibuya\n\nAfter walking Harajuku, go back to Harajuku station and ride Yamanote-line to Shibuya. it\u2019s one stop. Enjoy Shibuya\n\n4.Shinjuku\n\nAfter shibuya, go back to Shibuya station and take yamanote-line to Shinjuku\n 3rd stop only takes 7 minutes.\n\nSo this way you can go around in one day And you only riding Yamanote-line. Simple.\n\nWhen you plan always go shrine or temple 1st. They opens around 6am so You can use day longer.",

We are going to rely on Google Maps a lot, so that's really helpful. \n\nI'm surprised we can visit all of those places in one day! We are staying in Ginza, so maybe we will explore there the day we land. Then we will follow your plan for day 2! Thank you for this!",

Sensoji (Asakusa).\n\n\n    You get off at Asakusa station on Ginza subway line or Asakusa sbway line or Tobu skytree line.\n\n     It is nearest to Kaminari mon.\n\n    (If you Take Tsukuba express line, you will be at another Asakusa station and you will be going  Sensoji from the side (Not through Kaminari gate)\n\n\n2.Tokyo Skytree and Soramachi shopping mall\n\n\u3000\u3000[Skytree website in english](https://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/).\nand.\n     [Soramachi website in English](https://www.tokyo-solamachi.jp/en/)\n\n\n     Take any subway (Asakusa line, Tobu skytree line or tobu nikko asakusaline) from Asakusa station near Kaminari gate.

You will hit Matsuzakaya department store. The turn right.\nThen you hit big street \u201cChuo Dori\u201d. Take left turn. Go strait. This is the main street of Akihabara. In 500m Akihabara starts. \n\nFrom Ameyoko to end of Akihabara, 1.2km.\n\n\n4.Akihabara\n\n   When you see maid on the street you know itis Akihabara.\n  Akihabara shops and restaurants are open 11am , close 8pm. (some bars will open at night)\n\n Maid cafe, shops for teck geeks, anime shops, are there. \nReminder Ikebukuro town (North west side of Tokyo) also have many anime shops too)\n\n\n5.Ginza\n\n After you done with Akihabara.\n Take Hibiya subway line to Higashi ginza staton.\n  6stop 12 minutes.\n  \n  You will be at East end of Ginza.\n  Walk toward West for Enjoy Ginza.\n\n  \nThose in one day.\nBut if you are really into Anime, Arcade games or Tech, you will need one full day for Akihabara.",

You can probably stay 2 nights and do the day trip to Nara from here if you like.\n\nDay 4 - Morning in Osaka before going to Hiroshima. Explore Hiroshima in afternoon.\n\nDay 5 - Miyajima - I think you need close to a full day here so going as a day trip from Kyoto is hard. Overnight in Hiroshima\n\nDay 6 - Travel to Okayama. Leave luggage in storage at station and explore. Head to Kyoto in evening.\n\nDay 7-10 - Kyoto",

We haven't booked our hotel yet for Kyoto cause we're on the fence with this.\n\nWe were leaning more towards Kyoto to keep our luggage in one place, but we're more open to hopping around now. The more we've been looking into it, the easier it sounds to get around in Japan with luggage which is a relief. \n\nAt least I think spending a night in Hiroshima is a great idea since it's almost a 2 hour ride by Shinkansen. Will definitely revisit this with my SO.",

There are a couple of other museums less than 10 min. walk as well. \n\nIt may seem weird to recommend an Indian restaurant when visiting Japan, but I'm going to do just that. Arati (aka Sundar Mahal) has tasty Nepalese/Indian curries with good lunch specials and is walking distance from the castle/garden. If that doesn't strike your fancy, there are a ton of Japanese restaurants in the same area.\n\nDaiunji Temple has a small street festival the 23rd of every month, so it appears you'll miss that.\n\nIf you really want to get away from other tourists and see the real Japan, you could also rent a bicycle at Okayama station and do the Kibi Plain trail. It passes by a number of temples and shrines and through farmland and neighborhoods. \n\n* Do not go to the Ikeda Zoo; animal welfare is not a priority there.\n\n\nKURASHIKI\n\nLess touristy idea; you could go bowling across the street from Kurashiki City Hall, which I always thought was some bizarre architectural mix of an Italian campanile and a tissue box. Really, it looks like a giant love hotel.\n\n\n(edited to fix janky formatting)",

    "postText": " Hey everyone,\n\nI'm going to Japan in June and wanted to see the Toyko car scene. I've heard and seen a lot about Daikoku PA and seen some posts here before but wanted to get some specific updated information.\n\n1. I found the timings are usually Friday/Saturday nights? We were planning to get there for 8pm on a Saturday. Is that a good time or is there any place where meetup times are communicated/scheduled?\n2. Is there any groups/pages with info? Facebook/Discord groups/servers??\n3. I've heard you can't get there by public transportation. I'm willing to taxi there even if it's expensive.. Would you also be able to get a taxi from there back to the hotel when it's late? I heard people say they've gotten stranded there or that you can only go here if you have your own car...\n\nAppreciate any information. Super excited to see some crazy cars in Tokyo :D",

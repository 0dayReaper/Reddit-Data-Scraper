Add another 1hr to get to base camp.\n\nTo reach Mt Fuji station 5 (the start of the climb) is another 1hr by bus from the station.  I think it was around $20 return. ",

You buy your tix at Otsuki TO Kawaguchiko and back then reboard the JR train back to the Tokyo area or where ever your connection is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you arrive at KS you will see a bunch of buses, Green, red, blue line etc. These will take you to diferent areas around the base of Mt. Fuji and to the other lakes. Once you get off the train, there is only one entrance to the station head straight thru and you will see the buses. Turn right ouside and you will find vending machines and the lines for the buses. Past that is the ticket sale booths and past that is the toursim office. You can find hard copy maps and nice attendents who speak an assortment of languages to help travlers pick which bus to get on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDirectly ac\b\b\bcross the way is a small store and on top is a restraunt, that on a clear day offers a very nice first picture of Fuji-san!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps, feel free to PM me!",

(after learning the Fuji 5 lakes pass was not much more than the Hakone pass).\n\nIf you have a few minutes, I'ma sling some late night questions at ya. Is there a certain spot to rent a bike from that would be the cheapest in that area, or would most any be similar in price? And is that just the best way to view it or is walking around / using the Fuji pass just as good? (I love to bike but I don't know how the other options are)\n\nNot the guy you replied to, but thanks for the bit of info regardless!\n\n",

Some hotels may even have a bike you can borrow for free or a small charge. \n\nWalking is fine too, Kawaguchiko isnt that big.",

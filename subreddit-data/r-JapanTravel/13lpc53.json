    "postText": "My friend and I tapped our mobile suica cards in Osaka this morning, and started a 4 hour journey where we transferred lines once in Matsusaka to a local train bound for Owase.  When we arrived at our destination, we could not use our mobile suica cards.  We were able to pay for the journey from Matsusaka to Owase in cash, but were told we would have to return to Matsusaka to pay for our journey on the Kintetsu Line, which we do not have the time to do.  Our mobile suica cards are still \u201copen\u201d from when we started our journey in Osaka.  Does anyone have any advice for what we should do?  Thank you very much.",

Matsusaka to Owase is not only outside of IC card area, but it's also run by a different company, JR Central vs Kintetsu where OP began their journey. Some companies have agreement with each other where they could collect fare for each other, but JR Central and Kintetsu don't, so JR Central can't fix the card for OP. They have to return to Kintetsu to fix and pay the unpaid fare.\n\nAs mithdraug, this is the worst case possible.",

If you put any kind of paper ticket (like the Japan Rail Pass) through the gate machines, it will spit it back out at the other end, so don't forget to grab it! I didn't realize this when I took the Tokyo Monorail from Haneda Airport, so when I went to leave, I had nothing to put through the gates that would allow me to leave!  I spoke to a security guard who waved me through, but he told me not to forget to grab the ticket next time!",

Like the Shinkansen side is a different station as the local side, so you have to pass a transfer gate between the Shinkansen and the local side, or have to use a gate to exit one and a different gate to enter the other.\n\nWhen you use a transfer gate, you will exit one station and enter the other at the same time, so doing it with an IC card both actions are performed at the same time.",

Sometimes, you have to pay inside the train like a bus fare, and you will be delaying the whole train schedule if you've done something wrong and are confused. But this mistake also happens with Japanese tourists, so don't be feel too guilty if it does happen.",

I suppose you could also consider your mobile suica a complete loss, delete it, and restart with a new one (if there isn't much money on it currently).\n\nI'm assuming you took a Kintetsu Limited Express from Osaka to Matsusaka, tapped your suica at the gate in Osaka to cover the base fare, and either paid the limited express surcharge on the train or bought it ahead of time at the machine (surcharge only)? In the future (and for anyone else reading this), I normally recommend buying the full limited express ticket (base fare + limited express surcharge) before getting on the train. It avoids confusion like this. If you need to take a limited express train and are at all confused as to how ticketing or transferring along the way will work with a suica, just get a ticket to avoid worrying about it. In this case, if OP had had a full ticket, the Kintetsu fare would have been paid, and this would be easier to resolve.",

Both, the origin and destination stations have to be located inside the IC card coverage area. Furthermore, it is not possible to use an IC card to travel between disjoined IC card areas. For example, you cannot use it to travel between Tokyo  (Suica area) and Numazu (TOICA area), even if they are just nearby. You will possibly get jammed inside the gate.",

The station workers told me I couldn't fix it until I returned to Tokyo (which wouldn't be for a whole week \ud83d\ude05). Paying for tickets with cash wasn't a big deal, though, so it was all good. Actually, I was still able to use the card on vending machines, but I'm not sure why, so YMMV.",

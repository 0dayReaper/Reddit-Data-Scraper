            "comment": "In terms of the quality of mountain huts in Nagano, I would rank the regions as follows.\n\n--Yatsugatake: A+  (Food standard incredibly high)\n\n--Northern Alps: A (Solid huts in general)\n\n--Central Alps: B (pretty basic)\n\n--Mt. Kobushi: C (also pretty basic, forgettable)\n\n--Southern Alps: C- (I'm looking at huts operated by the draconian Tokai Forest. Others are fine.)\n\nEvery hut in Yatsugatake offers something unique whether it's grilled chicken, fried sweet bread, beef stew, or curry. Some of them are stylish, with a proper piano and a cozy fireplace.\n\nAnd the deeper you go into the mountains, the more mature and chill the guests are. My favorite was the Suisho Hut where everyone looks like they could climb Mt. Everest and back. With some Japanese, you can hear stories of crazy adventures from these guests.\n\nI would not recommend the Southern Alps around Hijiri and Akaishi for beginners. There's a lot of beauracracy, a lot of planning, and a lot of money involved.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,  I've made up the general itinerary below and was hoping to get some feedback.  I am not making firm decisions on restaurants at this point,  mostly just wanting to set my neighborhoods/areas and get any additional feedback of other fun things in these areas or if I'm planning too much on a given day. \r\n\n\r\nRight now my biggest dilemma is doing Shibuya on a Saturday but the Aoyama Farmers Market seems fun and is only open Sat/Sun. Not sure if it's worth it to basically switch Saturday and Monday and keeping Aoyama Market on Saturday or skip it altogether.\r\n\n\r\nIt will be me (Male 30) and my friend (Male 32). We both like anime so we would enjoy anything that relates to that.  Also,  we will be staying in Ginza.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday 11/29\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTravel \u2013 Koya to Tokyo\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTravel \u2013 Stop at Fuji if clear\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGinza \u2013 Check into Hotel\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGinza \u2013 Dinner and drinks\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday 11/30\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShinjuku \u2013 Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShinjuku \u2013 Suga Shrine (Your Name steps)\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShinjuku \u2013 Isetan\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShinjuku \u2013 Tokyu Kabukicho Tower/Godzilla Statue\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShinjuku \u2013 Tokyo Metro Building (observatory)\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShinjuku \u2013 Golden Gai/Omoide Yokocho\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday 12/1\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGinza \u2013 Hamarikyu Gardens\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGinza \u2013 Pokemon Caf\u00e9\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAsakusa \u2013 Tokyo Skytree\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAsakusa \u2013 Hoppi Street\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAsakusa \u2013 Senso-ji\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday 12/2\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShibuya \u2013 Aoyama Farmers Market\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShibuya \u2013 Meiji Jingu\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShibuya \u2013 Shibuya Crossing and Hachiko Statue\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShibuya \u2013 D47 Design Store\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShibuya \u2013 Shibuya Sky\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday 12/3\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUeno \u2013 Tokyo National Museum\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUeno \u2013 Ueno Koen\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUeno \u2013 Ameyayokocho\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAkihabara \u2013 Chuo Street and Stores\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRoppongi \u2013 Roppongi Hills\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRoppongi \u2013 Keyakizaka\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday 12/4\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTokyo Bay \u2013 Teamlab Tokyo\r\n\r\n\u2022\tToshima \u2013 Pokemon Center\r\n\r\n\u2022\tToshima \u2013 Animate Ikebukuro\r\n\r\n\u2022\tToshima \u2013 KitKat Chocolatery\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGinza \u2013 Dinner \r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday 12/5\r\n\r\n\u2022\tLast minute shopping/food\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHead to airport",

If you don\u2019t plan on buying much or going to several stores you could probably spend less time, but you wouldn\u2019t have time to peruse quite  as much as you might otherwise like. \nOtherwise Akihabara is a nerd haven and it would probably take days to see everything there.",

Books, cd / dvd, anime figure, games, toys, model kit, idol stuff, etc.\n\nFor me, I would delete the whole sunday section and just put akihabara in there, maybe nakano broadway first then akihabara as many shops in akihabara close late\n\n*And during sunday, they close the road so it is pedestarian only road",

Just realized I'm not driving in Gifu at all, but Awara, Ishikawa, and Toyama prefectures.",

You pay when you\u2019re ready to leave but you can\u2019t go in and out as you want. Of course if that\u2019s what you want then that\u2019s up to you but just want to make sure you know! And there are definitely ones that let you stay like a regular hotel but might just take some researching to find.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nJust make sure to spend time researching the times of the train from Toyama to Takayama.  While the bus between Kanazawa to Takayama is not covered, the times are much more readily available and the times from Toyama to Takayama are PIA to find, which is why I am not sharing them, as I misplaced the webpage I found.  Back before Hyperdia died, there were 8 trains a day from Toyama to Takayama, 4 are locals and 4 are Hidas.  Some of the locals get in within 30 minutes of the Hidas, you just get a layover in Inotani or Hida Furukawa.  There are no additional trains, post Hyperdia dying, they're just harder to get the schedule for now.\n\nI am very aware of this because I missed my Hida from Takayama to Toyama and I had to wait a good almost 3 hours before I could get another train because there was just nothing else.  Toyama Station is super clean, but it just had very limited shops and such and having a long layover there won't necessarily give you the time to really leave the station.  I will say I think the Takayama to Toyama leg of the Hida is more scenic than Takayama to Nagoya.\n\nI also think Hida no Sato was much more enjoyable than Shirakawa Go.\n\nMake sure you don't need a reservation for the Capcom Cafe.  I think they're overall easier to get than Pokemon or Kirby, but you still might need one.  I had a good friend who went to the one in Umeda in December when the theme was Phoenix Wright cause they're a huge fan.  We went to the Capcom Store in Shinsaibashi with them.\n\nI've never stayed at a Love Hotel, so can't comment on that.",

I'm using a combo of Google maps, Japan official, and Navitime for transit times. Is that enough?\n\nI'll check what the collab cafes are when we go, it's not a big deal if we can't go.",

                            "comment": "I men I wouldn't take the train just for fun, but if you are using a JR Pass to get from Kanazawa to Takayama, you need to take a shinkansen to Toyama and then a local or a Hida Limited Express to Takayama and the Hidas are nicer, because in general Limited Express trains are nicer than regular trains.  Navitime is usually really good.  I find Google Maps is great at showing the best route at the exact time you are looking at it.  Whether that is the best route 20 minutes later it won't tell you.  This can make a huge difference because sometimes the best route is waiting 20-30 minutes for an express or a direct train vs. some long and convoluted route.  \n\nSo if you keep seeing locals only between Toyama and Takayama move your times around until you see a Limited Express Hida.  I would try to make that work and know all the train times, in case your ramen meal takes longer than you expect, cause it would suck to miss the last train.  You don't want to get stuck in Toyama if you have an overnight reservation in Takayama.\n\nMy tween loves Yunessun.  It's really cheezy, but fun.  Hakone should be gorgeous when you are there because it's hydrangea season, and Hakone is a hydrangea destination.  We plan to go to Yunessun on either 21st or the 22nd.",

            "comment": "&gt; Stop at Fushima Inari Taisha temple on way to Arashiyama (does this make sense?)\n\nIt's not exactly \"on the way\", but if you don't have any other plans for that day, it's perfectly reasonable.\n\n&gt;Day 4-\n&gt;    Philosopher\u2019s Walk, Kyoto \n\nPhilosopher's Path is on the complete other side of the city than Arashiyama. I would move it to Day 5 instead.\n\nDay 7 seems a bit all over the place. I suggest you pick out 2-3 main things you want to do and then look for other things nearby.\n\nIf I were to move things around:\n\nDay 6:\n\n* Afternoon: Check into Shibuya hotel then visit Disney Shibuya Store &amp; Shibuya Mega Don Quijote\n* Evening: Ninja Restaurant then Akasaka or Roppongi nightlife\n\nDay 7\n\n* Morning: Nakamise Market, Kappabashi Street\n* Afternoon: Sakarai Tea Experience (I'm not familiar with how long this takes), lunch/shopping in nearby Omotesando\n* Evening: Either Shinjuku or Shibuya nightlife\n\nDay 8: \n\n* Morning: Tsukiji Market (&amp; maybe Ginza)\n* Afternoon: Teamlab or Skytree\n\nI also agree with the other comment that you should avoid the owl cafe. Animal cafes in Japan have varying levels of animal welfare, but owl cafes are generally considered one of the worst. If you want to go to an animal cafe do a little research to see if the animals are given plenty of time and space to rest away from people, and whether the animals seem to be enjoying themselves or just tolerating it. (I could write a whole post about what I look at when considering an animal cafe, but this is the gist of it.)",

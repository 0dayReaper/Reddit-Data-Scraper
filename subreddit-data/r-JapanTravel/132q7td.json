I\u2019ll be in Hiroshima this coming Saturday and wondering if anyone has experience on how to get there? \n\nI\u2018ve been planning on doing Hiroshima (Sat), Miyajima (Sun), \u014ckunoshima (Mon) and then travelling to Osaka once done at the island. I have a JR pass but saw something online about some of the trains not being available/more stops to endure? \n\nWould it be best to swap the Miyajima and \u014ckunoshima days for a more direct route to Osaka?\n\nFor reference, travelling to Hiroshima Saturday morning from Tokyo so any recommendations on how to structure these days would be great \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

Was based in Fukuyama, took the Shinkansen to Mihara, then Kure line to Tadanoumi and boarded the ferry there. \nThe island is lots of fun, not just because of the bunnies. Have you ever played the computer game \"Far Cry\"? Vegetation and ruins there look exactly like the world of Far Cry. :)\n\nSince Mihara is at the Sanyo Shinkansen Main Line, you should be able to go from Hiroshima to Tadanoumi via Kure line (which starts/ends in Hiroshima) in the morning, visit bunny island, then take the Kure line to Mihara and hop on the Shinkansen to Osaka there in the evening. \nLuggage might be a challenge, but I believe there are luggage transfer services for tourists.\n\nAnother option is Hiroshima -&gt; Mihara (store luggage there?) -&gt; Tadanoumi in the morning and Tadanoumi -&gt; Mihara (collect luggage) -&gt; Osaka in the evening",

Apparently they're harmless but if you're from Europe like me where spiders aren't that big and plentiful you might be a bit shocked. They're everywhere in Japan (and South Korea as well) but there were way more on this island.",

But I went to South Korea last autumn and Japan autumn 2017 and the amounts of HUGE spiders everywhere was... An experience. I wish I wasn't scared of them but for some reason they terrify me \ud83d\ude2d. Like the little spiders that are in the plants in the Netherlands aren't scary to me (but the big-ish house spiders are). Also they aren't everywhere above your head in the trees either. Like I literally had to duck to not get in the face by spiders on Bunny Island because we were going up a small trail to the top where the lookout is.",

They're EVERYWHERE in nature areas but they also appear in the cities (usually attached to things like fences and street lights / any place where they can make a web. In Korea I saw many at bus stops right above people's heads in quieter areas). The wiki page says the female bodies can grow up to 25mm but I'm sure I've seen bigger.",

As for size, their body is about the size of a female pinky finger, and with their legs they'll cover the space of a human hand.\n\nThis might sound big (and probably is bigger than you're used to), but these spiders should only be a surprise if you're from Europe. I've heard they're native to lots of Asia and North America. And as I said, they are chill. Just sitting in their webs. I'd be more concerned about Japanese cockroaches, which are gigantic - and fast. :D",

This species apparently hatches in spring at which point they'll be tiny babies and they'll grow bigger until they die at some point in autumn.\n\nI will say that I was in Japan in November 2017 and there were so many of them, so I guess it varies per year if the other poster didn't see many in October. I'll be going to Taiwan next November so I'll have to see if there's this many spiders there as well. They do look pretty in their terrifying way.\n\nAlso I've never seen a cockroach in Asia and I've been there many times. I've even lived in Beijing for 7 months (including the entirety of autumn and I didn't see many spiders there for some reason).",

After arriving in the morning, I walked around the island and visited the Poison Gas Museum (and fed the bunnies of course :D) and for the afternoon I went to Onomichi, which is a town to the east. There's a hill close to the train station where you can either walk up or take a cable car, and you have a pretty great view over the city and surroundings.\n\nAs for Miyajima, I have no idea about your physical fitness, but if you don't mind some strenuous exercise and are in good shape, I propose you climb up the mountain there by foot. There's a great paved trail up, the cable car is fairly expensive, and it's just an awesome feeling to have climbed the mountain (535m!) to then enjoy the view over the Seto Inland Sea.",

The only thing I'll add is that the RETURN ferry can depart from two different piers at different times. We missed our return ferry because we defaulted to the same pier we arrived at. \n\nLater in the day it seems they run a smaller return ferry from a different pier so pay attention to that. But it's not a huge deal they're within 15 minutes walking distance of each other.",

Be careful since it stops at 6pm or something.\nI had planned to spend the night at the island's hotel with a friend and it proved to be the correct choice for us - we were lucky to get the last ferry of the day to get to the island and we were not pressed for time after that.\n\nedit: of course you could also come from Hiroshima's side, and I heard there are buses in addition to the trains: you might want to look into that!",

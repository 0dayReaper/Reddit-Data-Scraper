Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements\n\n* Japan allows visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* For travelers entering the country on or after April 29, 2023, Japan no longer requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test ([official source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)). The COVID/quarantine section of Visit Japan Web has been removed.\n* Tourists entering Japan should still have their Immigration process and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration and a QR code for Customs, which can smooth your entry procedures.\n* **For more information about Visit Japan Web and answers to common questions, please see [our FAQ on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visitjapanweb/).**\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

The most straightforward plan that we have right now is taking the Narita express to Tokyo station, then taking the Shinkansen to Nagoya. Should be easy right? The problem is that we\u2019re arriving at Narita really late. \nLooking at the Shinkansen, the last train heading to Nagoya from Tokyo station is at 10pm. The Narita express we need to make is at 8:45pm, 45 minutes after landing. It is about a 55 minute ride, which we can assume that arrival at Tokyo station is at 9:40pm which leaves us with 20 minutes to get tickets and head to the bullet train on time. It\u2019s going to be our 2nd time traversing Tokyo station and we know it\u2019s going to be a maze to deal with.\n\nMy questions are: is this plan plausible? The window of time that we have in between each travel change from plane-&gt;Narita express-&gt;Shinkansen seems super tight, and missing one could mean having to book a hotel or something. Is there any other options? A potential plan B? Thanks guys for any help.\n\nEdit: I would also really love any resources that can be of help when it comes to navigation. We can\u2019t afford to get lost at Tokyo station. Directions or any maps would be awesome.",

If I'd visit Kobe, then it would have to be tomorrow morning (Osaka &gt; Kobe &gt; Mount Kurama &gt; Tokyo) but not sure if that is a little too optimistic. Is Kobe definitely worth it?

It isn't because they were doing anything in particular or looking suspicious - it's just that they look foreign.\n\nI suspect that it's more like a \"make work\" type thing or even a quota / productivity benchmark that needs to be hit.  \n\nSince the tax-free process still centers on scanning a passport it's advantageous to carry the passport at all times for that purpose.

I did go to a cute okonomiyaki restaurant in Gion area; arrived at 5.30 ish and waited 30 mins for our table. By the time we left, the line was at least 2 or 3 hours long.",

Basically, I think it was as busy as it could be (tickets for Japanese locals appeared to be sold out as well.)\n\nIn terms of lines - the line up to get into the Warehouse was really long however it moved smoothly once the entry time was hit.  I reckon the back of the line probably got in 15 minutes or so after the line started moving.  \n\nThe shop itself was packed.  As in it was hard to walk around but other than that it was okay.  The lineup for the cash registers was about 5 minutes? Maybe ten but I think it was shorter than that.  \n\nInside the warehouse some of the areas had longer lines.  The line for one of the main exhibits was probably a 15 minute wait to get to the start of it.  That was mainly due to people taking pictures at every display.  That was the main reason for the lineups inside the Warehouse:  picture taking.  If you don't care about taking pictures it isn't that bad - you can bypass most of the lines except those for getting into an exhibit area but once you're in you can move through it fairly fast if that's something you're interested in.  We still went slow and looked at all the various things plus we did get a few pictures in with the displays.",

So, if I'm understanding correctly, rail passes can last 7 days?  I'd need it starting the 2nd day, right?  \n\nSo, my questions:\n\n1. When and from where should I order the rail pass and which one should I get?  And then how do I activate it so that it starts on the 2nd day and not the first.\n2. How do I get from Narita to Akihabara that first day?",

No one talked about the places I want to visit... here was the post I wanted to make but the auto mod deleted it....\n\nI have a lot of ink. I have both sleeves done and half of both my legs done. I am going to Japan for 3 weeks at the end of June so it will be hot. I was making reservations and looking into things.. I know I cant go in most bath houses. But when I got tickets for the Gundam factory I saw this in the rules \"No Wearing inappropriate clothing, or clothing that displays tattoos..\"\n\n...Could I wear a sun dress? I was planning on only bringing light clothing and a rain jacket. I really don't want to wear a sweater in the summer three weeks. I cannot cover up my tattoos with the second skins or whatever its called cause it would be uncomfortable cause of the amount of skin I would have to cover. Would they really not allow a foreigner inside because of tattoos? Or do they just mean offensive tattoos? Has anyone else gone in places with tattoos? I'm not a gangster or anything and my tattoos are colorful and anime themed.\n\nI am also going to Universal Studios, Ghibli museum, making of harry potter and the Pokemon cafe. Will I basically have to wear a sweater and pants everywhere or do they understand that I am a tourist and not a gangster?\n\nI am also going to Okinawa for a week. I heard online you cant even have tattoos on the beach. Am I allowed to go swimming in my swim suit? I was planning on swimming around American village and then going one day to zamami island. Do I have to buy a wet suit or can I just wear my normal swimsuit? Maybe I am just worrying too much but I don't want to upset people or start any trouble. Thanks!",

It's shops and arcades are it's main attraction... you don't need a guide for that kind of stuff, and you'll want to browse at your leisure, not have a bunch of people tapping their feet waiting for you.",

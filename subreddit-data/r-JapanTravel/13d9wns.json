I'm \\*not\\* a polemic animal abuse activist type, but the two cafes I ended up visiting in Japan both gave me pause, and in hindsight I regret even the little support I lent the industry by visiting, based both on those experiences but also what I've learned since (I went in part because there are a few in my local area back in the US that are very reputable). I went to a shiba cafe on my first trip to Japan that seemed pretty good all things considered, good staff to customer to dog ratio, the only thing that struck me as a bit off was what seemed like a fairly untrained staff. But the owl cafe I visited I definitely regret. The owls weren't chained or anything, and on the whole I think the place was earnestly trying to do their best. The main problem (besides the fact that it's just not really an ideal situation for owls in the first place, not enough space for each owl, no real \"room to escape\" if feeling overwhelmed) was that the staff were too shy to intervene when individual tourists would be too \"touchy\" with the owls. There were definitely some dumb tourists who really didn't understand how to interact with the owls, and you could see that the staff \\*wanted\\* to step in, but were nervous (likely not wanting to upset guests, upset their boss, etc.)",

            "comment": "the hasami and arita pottery festivals are held at the beginning of May every year, so you will miss them. They are both very quiet small towns but you could certainly buy some pottery any time of year. I think for the days between Fukuoka and going to Okayama/Himeji/Osaka you should just pick one city in northern Kyushu, whether it be Beppu, Nagasaki, or Kumamoto and stay there for a few nights. I am biased, but i recommend Nagasaki as it has an interesting vibe of western/chinese/japanese fusion and two or three nights is a perfect time to stay there. i found kumamoto to be kinda bland to be honest, i.e. there wasnt anything that differentiated it from any other mid-size japanese city. I've only spent 3 days in Kumamoto though. Beppu is cool for the onsen.  \np.s. what do you want to see in Hagi? It seems very out of the way (off the shinkansen path)",

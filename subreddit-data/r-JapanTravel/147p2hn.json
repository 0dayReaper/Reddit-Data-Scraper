    "postText": "Dates: May 25 - June 1  \n**Some Background:**   \nJapan has been a dream to visit for me for almost a decade. So in 2018, I finally had the money to do the trip. For the visa, I needed Flight and hotel booked. Did that, applied for a visa. Denied. They don't even give you a reason. I did extensive planning for that trip. It was for 28 days and it was a dream trip that I carefully planned for over 3 years. I was devastated and honestly heartbroken. I lost a significant amount of money as flights were partially refundable and with hotels, some hotels were not refundable at all.  \n**Visa:**   \nIn the last 5 years, my financial situation has gotten better, and my 60 page passport is almost full. In April and thought I'd just give it another try. Just made sure I booked everything cancellable. For flight tickets, I used a site called visareservation. For hotels, I paid fully but they were all cancellable.   \n3 days later, I got a 14-day single entry visa.   \n**Planning:**   \nI did not expect to get a visa after my last experience. So I had no solid plan. I just cancelled all the hotel bookings first that I made for the visa to get the refunds.   \nI also could not use my old plan. Lots of things have changed in the last 5 years. Also it was made for a 28 day trip and backpacking alone. This time I was going with my GF for a much shorter duration. So the plan is to do the very touristy stuff in this short span, and maybe visit again next year.   \nCell Phone: We got the Ubigi eSIMs. I got 50GB and GF for 10GB. By the end of 8 days, I hadn't even used 10GB.   \n**Payments and currencies:**   \nThe 3 cities I went to are the most touristy cities. So card payment option was available in 99% of the places. I took about $150 worth of JPY.    \n**Getting around:**   \nI took taxi twice during this trip. Everything else was only public transport. Google maps was accurate every single time. However, it does do weird routes from time to time. Even when you want to do least walking, it would get you to walk a bit to save money. Had to get around this by setting the destination of a specific station next to the place you want to go.   \n**Taking care of my legs:**   \nI did so much preparation in anticipation of this trip. I went to so many places and almost everything was through public transport and foot. So without good feet, it would've been impossible.   \n**Stats:** According to my Apple Watch, I'd walked for 110km, or 150,000 steps in the 8 days. An average of 13.75km per day. It does not account for the difficulty in standing in lines, train, stations, etc. I would not recommend travelling like us if you're older than 35 or not physically fit.   \n**Shoes:** Ultraboost 22. Tried a whole load of shoes before the trip but I could not make up my mind. So I just went with ultraboost that I've been using for 7 years now. Got the Ultraboost 22 in the outlet for just 5K INR.  Got it 2 weeks before the trip and I clocked in 100km to break the shoes.   \n**Preparation:** I am somewhat fit. I hit the gym at least 4 times a week. But I don't have the best diet and I focus more on weights rather than cardio. So for two weeks leading up to the trip, I took up continuous walking. Every day I'd walk on the treadmill for 2 hours straight at a steady pace. I'm not sure if I would recommend this to others as I'm not sure if it really helped me. At least it helped with breaking the shoes in, and made them more comfortable in time for the trip.   \n**Kinesiology tape:** We took Kinesiology tape and practiced various ways of taping right before the trip. It was very helpful for things I could not anticipate. Like I did not have significant pain in the first 3-4 days. But on the 5th day I had pain in my heels. I knew exactly what to do and it definitely helps.   \n**Salt Baths:** Again, don't know if they really help. Got Epsom salt and took relaxing bath in the bathtub every night.   \nTheragun Mini: Expensive, but I really love it. Helps with massaging your pain points when you get back to the hotel after a really tiring day.   \n**Terms:**   \n**Goshuin**: All temples in Japan make hand-made stamps with specific prayers and blessings. It was fun to collect these and learn their meanings.   \n**Goshuincho:** Book for collecting Goshuins.   \n**Ema:** Again, all temples have a wooden plank called Ema. They have cute art on one side, and a blank canvas on the other side. You write your wishes and tie it in the temple. Some Emas are for specific purposes, while other are generic.   \n**Trip:**   \n**Day 1:**   \n5am flight from Bangkok and reached Tokyo Narita at around 3pm. Took an hour to finish immigration and get to my bag. Have heard nightmare stories of Narita being super slow. Guess I was lucky to be outside in an hour. As always, being the only brown guy, I get 'randomly' selected for additional baggage check. They scan my bag a couple of times and let me go.   \nTook the Kensei Skyliner from airport to city. Very comfortable, and fast. From Ueno, Akhibara is just one stop. Took the train to Akhibara station. Booked Akhibara Washington Hotel. It is right outside the station and very easy to access.   \nChecked in, left our bags and asked the hotel to leave it in our rooms. It was about 4pm now. The first part of my plan was to go to Imado-Jinja Shrine. Which closes at 5pm and it is a 1km walk from its closest station. So we took a taxi and got there by 4:30. Just as the girl working at the reception was ready to close down.   \nImado-Jinja is a popular shrine for couples to get married, or married couples to stay together. My interest in the temple was that it's super cute and cat themed.  Anyways, the girl at the reception was kind enough to wait for us to make our purchases, trying to explain everything in her limited English.   \nBought a really cool-looking Goshuincho on which the receptionist drew the Goshuin. After our purchases, she locked up and followed us outside. She stayed back to explain a few things about the temple and took photos for us.   \nAfter this, we took the train and went to Tokyo Skytree. We were not interested in the sky tree itself, but we were interested in checking out a few stores in the mall: The Pokemon store, Harry Potter store, and Ghibli store.   \nAfter this, we headed to Ginza. It was almost 8pm when most stores start closing. So we just headed to the Ginza Uniqo to get some shopping done. With tax refunds, Uniqlo in Japan is insanely cheap. Like most products are 50% the price.   \nAfter this, we walked to the Ginza Ichiran. Ichiran is my favourite Ramen chain that I loved visiting in Hong Kong multiple times. Ichiran is the chain that introduced me to Ramen. So I had to visit it in the first day. The restaurant is open 24 hours. At 10pm, it had a 1 hour line. We stood in the line. It was an amazing feeling when we finally got in and the smell hit our noses.   \nSatisfied, we got back to the hotel super tired. At this point I'd not slept in about 48 hours. But the excitement got me going.   \n**Day 2: Akhibara, Shujuku**  \nAkhibara in the morning. Visited stores such as super potato, Mandarake, and M's pop life. Visited Akhibara Gachapon Hall. Spent a good amount of money here. At the time, it seemed amazing. But over the 8 days, I stumbled upon more such stores, that this was not even in the top 3 stores. Not sure why this shop is popular. It was not even 25% the size of the other stores I visited. Had a decent collection though.   \nWrapped up Akhibara trip with the Kanda Myojin shrine. The shrine is a bit touristy for sure, but it is one of the most important shrines in Tokyo. Loaded up on a bunch of IT charms, Pet charms, etc. Got a really nice Goshuin and Ema here.   \nIn the evening, we went to Shinjuku and Kabukicho. First visited Hanazono Ninja shrine. They give out an amazing Goshuin in which, the shrine is cut into the paper. Visited a few stores in Shinjuku like the Disney Store and took a photo in front of Godzilla. Visited the new Kabukicho Tower. It looked nice, but nothing much to it.   \nNext, walked back to Shinjuku Omoide. Tried visiting a couple of restaurants I read about, but they said they were fully booked. So finally entered a grill shop that seemed somewhat nice, and had a free table. Got a few skewers. Menu said buy 1, get 1, and the staff confirmed it. Finally, the bill was huge. What ended up happening was, you don't get the second skewer for free. Instead, you are buying 2. I'm pretty sure this is some kind of a scam. By the end for a few skewers and a couple of beers we got a bill of 10K. Something I can afford to lose. So just paid the tab and walked away. Didn't want this to spoil my holiday.   \nNext, walked back to Golden Gai. Not too crowded, but pretty much all the recommended bars were full. Finally, we stumbled upon a bar called 'Deathmatch in Hell'. Another famous bar. We got in just as the bartender opened it. We got seats and the bar was full in just 5 minutes. Amazing bar with an amazing bartender. After getting scammed at the previous place I was happy to get drunk in a nice bar like this one. All drinks were flat 800 Yen.   \nHeaded back to Ahkibara, visited the Akhibara Don Quijote. Did some heavy shopping as the shop is right next to our hotel.   \n**Day 3: Harajuku, Shibuya**  \nStarted the morning with a visit the Meiji shrine. A nice walk in the gardens and an equally good shrine. Next stop, Harajuku. Did a bunch of streetwear shopping. Hidden within Harajuku is the Togo Shrine. When I went the temple was empty and I had to ring the bell to get the receptionist. The temple is partnered with Hello Kitty. Bought the Hello Kitty Goshuincho that comes with Hello Kitty Goushin. GF also got a bunch of Hello Kitty charms.   \nNext up, went to Shibuya by walking through Cat street. Visited the usual shopping spots like the Disney Store, loft, etc. Visited Pokemon store and Nintendo store, but they were very hard to navigate. Insanely crowded. I really wanted to buy some stuff. But I got claustrophobic very quickly and I left. Had dinner at Uobei bullet sushi. Good prices and good taste. Post dinner, visited the Mega Don Quijote and did some more shopping, before heading to the hotel.   \n**Day 4: Kyoto**  \nWoke up early and took the Nizomi Bullet Train at 7am. It's the fastest bullet train. I used the smart-ex app to pre-book the ticket a week ahead. The benefit of pre-booking was, I got Green Class (First Class) tickets with oversize baggage for the same price of regular tickets. Definitely a good deal. You can also use the QR code from the app to board trains. But I collected tickets from terminal the day before. Most JR stations will have machines where you can collect tickets. Only problem of this app is that they only support cards from specific countries. Good luck if you don't have a card from a supported country. Sat on the right side to check out Mount Fuji. It was definitely a good experience.   \nThis was a long day. We reached Kyoto at around 9am and checked in to our hotel Ibis Styles Kyoto. It's right next to the Kyoto station and very convenient. Took Taxi to Kiyomozu Dera temple.   \nAfter the temple, walked through Sannen Zaka street and Ninei-Zaka streets. A bunch of street food and shopping here. There's a Ghibli store here which has a totoro themed Goshuincho. I used this book to collect all Goshuins in Kyoto. Also visited the Starbucks store. It was a nice looking store, but a bit disappointing at the same time. No exclusive drinks or collectibles for this store.   \nAnyways, back to walking. Next stop Kodai-Ji temple and a couple of temples around it. Next, Mauyama Park and Yasaka Shrine inside it. The park also had a hot dog stand which was our lunch.   \nNext, Nanzen-Ji temple. It was quite a walk and we got a bit lost. We stumbled across Awata-Jinja in a small street. Again, no crowd and I had to ring the bell to get the receptionist. They give out a really cool samurai-themed Goshuin and Ema.   \nFinally got back on track and went to Nanzen-Ji through Keage Incline. Just got in time before the temple and the gate closed for the day.   \nNext up, to the train to Pontocho district. I was very badly prepared. I wanted to visit this restaurant called Kichi Kochi Omurice. I assumed this would be a bit like street food. I should've done better research. The street is extremely touristy, with huge lines for most good restaurants. They were also a bit expensive. In my case of Kichi Kichi, they said I had to make reservations at least 2 weeks ahead.   \nAnyways, I was frustrated with this and could not find a decent restaurant to have my dinner. Just hopped to McDonalds and got my dinner. I didn't want to deal with finding restaurants after a long day. Got back to the hotel and that was my day 4.   \n**Day 5: Kyoto**   \nDay 5 was an early day again. Kyoto is mainly for its shrines and temples, which open early and close early.   \nThe morning was Fushimi Inari. I did a lot of research into this as there is very little information beyond the first stop, Okusha Shrine. Very few people move beyond it. The mountain has a total of 6 Goshuins and they were not easy to find at all. But it was one of my best experiences trying to find them. Some were in off-beaten paths and each had a good meaning. Anyways, I did the complete hike. GF was exhausted by the second crossroads. So she found someplace to sit and asked me to go ahead. An hour later, I made it to the top and was back to the crossroad. Hike down along the side path was fun with more shrines.   \nIt was about 1am by the time we got to the train station at Fushimi Inari. We went to Nishiki Market next. GF is a huge fan of seafood while Im the opposite. She had a good 1-2 hours of eating marine life I've never before seen in my life.   \nWe wanted to go to Gion District next. But we still had a lot of time and didn't want to go too far. So we stopped by Matcha House. This place has gotten Insta famous in the last few months and there was a huge line outside. Normally I would never be interested in such places. But we had time to kill so just went ahead with it. After 45 minutes we got in and ordered matcha and Matcha Tiramisu. Taste was amazing. Would recommend if you don't mind wasting time standing in a line.   \nAnyways, by now GF had some sort of a mild allergic reaction. It was all the seafood she ate before this. She said inside of her mouth and throat was burning and was very uncomfortable. Her meds were back at the hotel and she didn't want to cut the day short. So we went to a nearby pharmacy and tried explaining with google translate. Pharmacist initially thought it was some skin allergy and gave us a cream. After some more explanation, she understood and gave us another medicine. GF took them, and said it didn't help. She wanted to go on though. Something to keep in mind: Keep your allergy meds on you if you're going to try new foods.   \nWalked around Gion District, looking at the cool buildings around. It was about 5pm now and we had nothing else to do. Walking past Gion Corner, GF wanted to check the show. It was a bit expensive. If I remember correctly 6,500 yen per person. Anyways, I was in the mood to spend money and checked for tickets online. Still had lots of tickets for the 6pm show and I booked them online.   \nNow we had 2 more hours to kill. The weather that day was incredible. It was cool, cloudy, and light rain throughout the day. Gion and its surrounding areas looked magical that evening. We walked around, tried some cafes and it was 6pm already.   \nWalked back to Gion Corner at 6pm in time for the show. It is a 1 hour showcase with 7 different traditional performances like the tea ceremony, and maiko dancers. Im not a huge fan of performance arts, but GF enjoyed it. After the show, we took the bus back home. We were exhausted once again.   \n**Day 6: Osaka**  \nWe finally didn't have to wake up super early today. Got ready at our own times and we took the JR train to Osaka. Im not saving a lot of time by taking the bullet train so opted against it. Booked our stay at Ibis Styles Osaka Namba which was about 4-5 stops from the Osaka station. From the Namba station, it was another 600 meter walk. It was really hard to do the walk with our bags.   \nDropped our bags at the hotel and took the train to Osaka Aquarium. Went to the Ferris wheel first as there was no crowds. The aquarium itself was amazing. Been to a few aquariums in other countries, but this one was really good.   \nGot back to Namba and took the mandatory Gulico Picture. For dinner, we went to a Japanese Grill Buffet that we made reservations for in the morning. Once that was done, we went shopping in Don Quijote. Namba has 3 Don Quijotes and we went to all 3 of them. The one by the river is the worst. It's tiny and super crowded. The other 2 Don Quijotes were much better and had the rare Kitkat and Pocky flavours that I was looking for.   \n**Day 7: Universal Studios Osaka**   \nUniversal Osaka has been on my list for a long time since they opened the Nintendo World. Pre-boked tickets through Klook. The website said that the park opens at 8am. Reached the park at 7am and there was already a huge crowd. Easily 1K+ people. I was worried that the park is going to be overcrowded so went to the counter and enquired about the express pass. It was 23K per person for 7 rides. Visiting the theme park has been on my list for a really long time and I didn't want to miss anything. So bit the bullet and bought 2 express passes. 46K down. And it was just the start of the day for my poor wallet.   \nWe first went to the Harry Potter world. Bought wands, butter beer, and random stuff from the shops. The wand itself was a waste of money for sure. There are 7 specific parts of the park where you can wave the wand for special effects. While the special effects were good, there is a line to try out in each part, and it's really hard to get the special effects to work. Was frustrating at times. The rides themselves were amazing and we had a quick ride as we had the express pass for those.   \nNext up, we ticked off a few things that we had express rides for. Like the spider man ride, Minions ride, and some anime ride.   \nFinally, it was our time to get into the Nintendo World. Got the power-up bands at the entrance and off we went. We had express pass for both the rides. The first AR ride is probably the most hyped one. But not sure what the hype is all about. It was cool. But not cool enough to wait in a line for 2 hours. The second ride was also meh and was for kids. But had a 90 minute line without express pass. However, the Nintendo World itself was amazing. Finding blocks, scoring points, and playing the mini-games was amazing. Finally, had a late lunch at the restaurant inside Nintendo World. Another annoyingly long line and very expensive food. The food itself was great though.   \nVery soon it was 6pm and we had to get going. It was the last night and I wanted to end with Ichiran again. Visited the Namba Ichiran. Another 1 hour wait, but totally worth it.   \n**Day 8: Back Home**  \nLast day of the trip, we checked out and left our bags in the hotel. Took the train to Osaka Castle which was a decent experience.   \nTook the train back to Kuromon Market where GF tried more sea food. This time a bit more careful with her selection and meds in hand. Satisfied, walked back to the hotel, picked our bags. This time we made sure to take a taxi to the train station.   \nNamba to Osaka Kansai Airport  \nTook the limited Express Rapi:t. It's a bit expensive but convenient from our stop. Was at the airport in 30 minutes.   \nOsaka Kansai Airport is definitely one of the weirdest airpots I've ever been to. The flight was from terminal 2. You can take the free shuttle from Terminal 1. It was a 10 minute drive. Terminal 2 itself was a tiny building. The airport has no lounge, one small duty free shop and just one restaurant that closes at 7pm. Anyways, GF had pre-purchased duty free stuff on the website and picked them up. I did some more Pocky Shopping and took the flight back home.   \nOverall the Kansai airport was both good and bad. The bad part was that it is tiny with no amenities. They open the gate, and you just walk to the flight. But the good part: no crowds. I've heard nightmare stories of people waiting 2-3 hours in Tokyo airports to get through security and immigration. With this airport, it took me just 5 minutes. So yeah, I think I'd choose this airport again if I had to, but go very late as there are no crowds to deal with.",

On a normal day I walk 8,000 to 10,000 steps even though I work in the office. I can't imagine what could lead to the situation where 35 years or older man has a problem walking 20.000 steps per day during holidays.

Visa denied. Now when I applied again I had to show my clients paying me well over $60k a year and had to prove I had another $50k liquid in my bank account. \nIt sucks.

In Tokyo I really liked the bunkyo center as well as the Asakusa tourist information top floor, it wasn't that high but had a good view of the Temple in front",

After the refurb you can see in all directions (just about) for free, with Shibuya skyscrapers to the east, possibility of seeing Fuji to the west, and low density residential all around meaning you can see for miles. Daytime and nighttime is nice. You\u2019ve also got a posh restaurant run by Hotel Okura now, Setagaya Public Theatre and a small art gallery downstairs, and you can access it by the super cute Setagaya line too.",

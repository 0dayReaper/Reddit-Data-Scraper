    "postText": "**This discussion thread has been set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel. Please stay civil, abide by the rules, and be helpful. Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**\n\n## Japan Entry Requirements and COVID Requirements\n\n* Japan has resumed visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).\n* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).\n* **If you are arriving in Japan on or before May 7, 2023,** you will need to have three doses of an [approved vaccine](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_vaccine.html) or submit [a negative COVID-19 test result](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_test.html) ahead of your departure to Japan. For the vaccine doses, there are no timing requirements as long as you have three doses of an approved vaccine (see [top of page 10 here](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/001002920.pdf)).\n* **If you are arriving in Japan on or after May 8, 2023,** you will not be required to present a vaccine certificate or negative PCR test ([official MHLW source](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html)).\n* Tourists entering Japan should get their COVID document checking process, Immigration process, and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration, a QR code for Customs, and a blue \"Review completed\" screen for COVID fast track (no QR code) once approved. (See below for more info.)\n* Travelers connecting through Japanese airports and staying airside for their connection do not need to complete any visa, entry, or COVID procedures.\n\n## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates\n\n* As of March 13, 2023, [mask usage is left up to personal choice and preferences in many circumstances](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/03/13/national/japan-mask-rules-caveats/). The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions. Additionally, Japanese airlines still require masks in most circumstances.\n* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won\u2019t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.\n* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you\u2019d like to visit before arriving.\n* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.\n* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).\n\n## Visit Japan Web Info and FAQs\n\n[Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/) (VJW) is an online document-checking system introduced in December 2022. It allows you to pre-enter all of your Immigration, Customs, and COVID vaccine/test information before arriving in Japan. To make the entry process as smooth as possible and prevent any issues, we recommend filling it out and obtaining the QR codes provided by the service.\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions regarding filling out the VJW sections:\n\n**Can I put multiple family members under the same Visit Japan Web account?**\n\n&gt; All adults should have their own VJW account. Family members on the same account should only be either minors or dependents incapable of filling it out on their own.\n\n**How far in advance can I fill out Visit Japan Web?**\n\n&gt; Officially speaking, you can use Visit Japan Web for trips up until the end of the year following the current year. For instance, in February 2023, you can register a trip with a date up to December 2024. That said, your information will be wiped if you don't sign into Visit Japan Web at least once every 18 months.\n\n&gt; Practically speaking, there's no real need to register more than a few months or weeks in advance, as the information gets reviewed and approved within hours or days.\n\n**What flight number do I use?**\n\n&gt; You should use the flight number for the flight _landing in Japan_. So, for instance, if you have a flight from New York City to Seattle and then from Seattle to Tokyo, you use the flight number of the Seattle to Tokyo Flight. If you are on a codeshare flight, you can use either the carrier you purchased through, or the operating carrier. For instance, if you are on American Airlines #4065 and it codeshares with JAL #001, you can write either \"AA 4065\" or \"JAL 001\".\n\n**What do I put down for my intended address? What do I do if I'm staying in multiple hotels or accommodations over the course of my trip?**\n\n&gt; You should use the address and contact information for your first hotel/hostel/Airbnb/etc. You don't need to provide multiple addresses.\n\n**On the quarantine procedures page, it has a \"Time remaining to complete registration: XXXXXX\" notification, but I've already submitted my vaccine certificate and my screen is blue. What do I do?**\n\n&gt; You don't have to do anything. This timer is for submitting a test for approval, which you don't need to do if you submitted vaccine information. Basically, it's bad design/programming.\n\n**Will I still get a \"temporary visitor\" stamp in my passport if I use VJW? I need it for the JR Pass and tax-free shopping!**\n\n&gt; Yes, you will still get a temporary visitor stamp in your passport. Tourists who fill out VJW still see an immigration officer at a manned immigration station and receive their stamp.\n\n## Quick Links for Japan Tourism and Travel Info\n\n* [/r/JapanTravel Discord](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n* [/r/JapanTravel Resources Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/resources/)\n* [Immigration/Customs Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airportimmigration/)\n* [JR Pass Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/)\n* [IC Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/)\n* [Luggage Forwarding Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/luggage/storageandforwarding/)\n* [Phone/Internet/SIM Card Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/technology/internet/)\n* [Prescription Medication Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) (Recently Updated!)",

However on the same page where it says to watch out for those 'special' vending machines ([Link Here](https://smart-ex.jp/en/entraining/ticket/place/)), it says this as well: \n\n* \"picking up tickets at the ticket vending machines in main JR Central, JR West or JR Kyushu stations. **Also, you can pick up your ticket at the ticket vending machines of JR East stations within Tokyo ward area**, Yokohama city zone, Kawasaki station, Odawara station and Atami station.\"\n\nDoes that imply that there are these other special \"EX\" vending machines at JR East stations like Shinjuku or that you can use regular machines in JR East (eg, Shinjuku) to get those tickets? Thanks, it's just a bit confusing.",

I am from the US and will be arriving via Haneda Airport. At first, I was thinking I was going to exchange money in the US before getting to Japan, but it sounds like I can get a better exchange rate in Japan. Where in the airport should I go to get yen? Is there anyplace where I can just provide my debit card and get yen? Or will I need to bring USD in and physically exchange that? Sorry about all the questions within this post!",

I\u2019d prioritize bringing two pairs of comfortable walking shoes/sneakers.  If one gets wet you can wear the other while that pair dries.   You can also buy a cheap, see thru plastic umbrella from any convenience store if m/when needed.  Umbrellas are better than rain coats since you fold them up and leave them outside the door of a shop/store when you go in so you don\u2019t drip water all over the floor.  Leave your leather bags/shoes at home and bring fabrics that are water resistant or will quickly dry if you hang up in your room overnight.  \n\n- [Complete Guide to Surviving Rainy Season](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0002433/)\n- [JapanGuide: Rainy Season](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2277.html#:~:text=In%20most%20of%20Japan%2C%20the,Okinawa%20about%20one%20month%20earlier)\n- [Visiting Japan in June](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0004546/)\n\nStay flexible with your plans for each day during rainy season.   Change up your itinerary as needed to take advantage of the sunny times to do outdoor activities and in Nagasaki the Peace Museum is a great option on a heavily rainy day as you can spend at least 2 hours there.  But the shrines/temples look gorgeous in the rain, hydrangeas and irises will be blooming, and at night you can get some interesting pictures of light reflecting off the wet pavement.",

We left for miyajima on our second full day in Japan so I was still struggling pretty hard with jet lag.\nWe left shin-osaka around 8am and went straight to miyajima. We did street food, looked at the torii gate and ropeway/hike to mount misen before we checked into our hotel around 4pm. Then walked around the island a bit at night. Next morning we went into itsukushima shrine early enough to beat most of the day trip crowd, daishoin and a couple of shops on our way to the ferry. We took the faster boat straight to the peace park. Looked at the atomic bomb dome, walked through the park, went to the museum and had lunch at a bakery we found. Got to Kyoto completely exhausted but I would do it again.\n\nOnly things I had hoped to do that we didn\u2019t get to do was to hike down the mountain instead of ropeway round trip. Not sure if the time it takes is really much different but I was pretty tired. Also did not get to eat Hiroshima okonomiyaki because the convenient spots had an hour or more wait when we got there.",

Service workers are trained to always be nice and Japanese people are generally not that outspoken so they might have been uncomfortable but not said anything. \n\n(Not that there is no tipping, Maids and Hosts sometimes get a cut of the money if you buy them a drink for example and they encourage you to do so)",

These can take a couple of hours to resolve. Depending on airline policy (such as their flat tire policy or your frequent flyer status) this could end up being very expensive. \n\nOf course, most of the time it works perfectly. So it depends on your risk tolerance really.\n\nBy the way, Google Maps assumes you use the Nozomi; if using JR Pass you have to take the Hikari which is both slower and less frequent.",

Post-COVID, it seems that 4 hours is the general recommendation for international flights so I would follow that just in case.  I just like to get there earlier for peace of mind. But it depends as well on how busy your airport is. I fly out of Los Angeles so it\u2019s usually quite busy and I\u2019m assuming Houston might be the same. If you check in for your flight online and get your boarding pass digitally before you arrive at the airport, that can save you some extra time as well. You should also read or post in the r/Flights community to see if other people have experiences flying internationally out of Houston. Have a great trip!",

It is a pleasant trip, speaking more from an opportunity cost perspective. \n\nPersonally I would split the four days between some combination of Hiroshima/Miyajima and Kanazawa/Takayama. The ride between Toyama and Nagoya on the JR Hida is very scenic during peak foliage.\n\nBTW I would have preferred to schedule the trip the other way around because Kyoto foliage peaks closer to end-November and it is wonderful, whereas Takayama peaks closer to early November.\n\nFor Mt Takao I suggest taking the chairlift (not the funicular), this only goes up halfway so there is still a good hike, you skip the most boring part of the hike, and the view coming down is wonderful. It also saves time and legs for more exploration in Tokyo.",

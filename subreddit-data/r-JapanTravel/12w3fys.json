    "postText": "Today\u2019s question is: What is your favorite beach in Japan?\n\nInevitably when talking about beaches in Japan - the conversation about best places in the Ryukyu Islands - Miyakojima, Ishigaki, Kerama Islands. But some people prefer less leisurely activities - surfing, kayaking, paragliding... \n\nSo tell us, what is your favorite beach in Japan.\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

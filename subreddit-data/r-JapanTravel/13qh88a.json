Great dinner too.  \n\nOr, try Guesthouse Raicho in Norikura just outside the park.  It\u2019s up the hill from the Norikura Bus Terminal so easy to get to via the Alpico Bus route and you can bus straight into Kamikochi from there.  I wrote about it in this trip report. \n\n- [Summer Long Weekend in Matsumoto and Waterfalls in Norikura (Nagano)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/piyive/summer_weekend_in_matsumoto_and_waterfalls_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nFor where we stayed in Takayama, see my trip report. \n\n- [Takayama: Autumn Weekend (Gifu)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mg8ir9/autumn_weekend_in_takayama_gifu_prefecture/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAnd if looking for a good snow/ski town, don\u2019t overlook Nozawa Onsen. \n\n- [Snow Weekend in Nozawa Onsen](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/t33lt8/snow_weekend_in_nozawa_onsen_nagano/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

Maybe travel hadn't fully awoken yet soon after the travel restrictions were lifted, but it was 50\u20ac per night, and the hotel had a top floor public open air bath with some great views. The hotel also had tatami floors pretty much everywhere. A bit touristy, but hard to beat the price. A few minute walk from Takayama station.",

It was early March, so Kamikochi must have been closed and it would have been considered the off-season. I felt like I had the whole ryokan to myself and I loved my stay. The onsen was beautiful, my dinner and breakfast were absolutely delicious, and I loved walking around the village.\n\nI got there by the [Nohi Bus](https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/english/routebus/) from Matsumoto Bus Terminal, with a transfer at Hirayu Onsen. I think the ryokan was around the halfway point between Hirayu Bus Terminal and the Shin Hotaka Ropeway.\n\nIt looks like if you want to go to Kamikochi from Ryokan Gizan, you will have to make a similar transfer at [Hirayu Bus Terminal](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hirayu+Bus+Terminal/@36.1909541,137.5517022,21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d49ef77faa0d9:0x8b736374939df8fe!8m2!3d36.1909741!4d137.5519519!16s%2Fg%2F11ptrbdy6s?shorturl=1) and takes a little over an hour. I actually liked the Hirayu terminal, there was a well-stocked convenience store and a local specialty meat-bun stand downstairs, and an indoor/outdoor onsen upstairs. On a clear day, the view in the parking lot of the surrounding mountains and forest is beautiful.",

Onsen was really lovely, and they had an in-house masseuse you could book via QR code that was amaaaazing after a couple of weeks of travelling and sore legs (they're not part of the hotel, but are based in the hotel).

It does get foreign tour groups, but it only made the breakfast buffet busier.  \n\nIt has two floors of onsen, and that is why you stay there.  The onsen are really nice especially when the mountains still have snow on them.\n\nI've stayed at the Konashidara Campground in Kamikochi.  We paid for a Cabin A.  It was quite affordable and had a private toilet.  It was a ton of space, but we did have to cook our own meals.  It rained the entire time we were there and I would not recommend the campground in the rain.\n\nWe stayed at Nakanoyu right outside Kamikochi.  At the time, they offered a free shuttle from Matsumoto to their ryokan, as well as an early morning shuttle to Kamikochi itself.  They tried to work with our dietary restrictions.  It did feel a little rundown.  I'm not sure I would stay there again.",

I especially liked the interior design and the complementary sake tastings each night. Walkable from the station, and it was located right next to the old part of town. \n\nI was worried about going to Takayama without a car but I'm really glad I did it. There's plenty of busses, but check the times because they don't run at night (this was in fall, it might be different). I did the hida no sato village, a day just wandering around the town (this was plenty, but I enjoyed \"time off\" like this during my trip) and took the bus to the shinhotaka ropeway. It was already snowy at the top in November, but I still hiked the path a while before turning back. I stopped on the way back at hirayu no mori as they open their onsen to day visitors. Then took a bus straight from there to Shinjuku, which was a really good (and cheap) option imo.",

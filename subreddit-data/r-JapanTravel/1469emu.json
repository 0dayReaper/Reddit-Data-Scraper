    "postText": "Hello! I will be traveling to Japan in July and am looking for feedback on my Kobe/Hiroshima itinerary. Prior to this itinerary, we would have already stayed in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. Please let me know if there is anything I should add or remove. Food recommendations are welcome :).  \nThank you!\n\nSunday, July 23: Kobe Day 1  \nTime TBD: Arrive in Kobe from Osaka   \nExplore Harborland  \nEat and explore Chinatown  \nRest\n\nMonday, July 24: Mount Rokko (would it be better to visit Arima Onsen first)?  \nI considered hiking up, however, I'm not sure that would be great in the summer heat.   \n9:30 - Arrive at Nunobiki Ropeway  \nWalk around Herb Garden, then head to the observation deck  \nTake Rokko-Arima Ropeway  \nExplore Arima Onsen  \nDinner  \nBack to Kobe (take bus from Arima Onsen? Is there another option?)\n\nTuesday, July 25: Hiroshima  \n\\~11:00 AM Arrive in Hiroshima  \nDrop off luggage  \nLunch  \nVisit Shukkeien Garden  \n\\~3:00 PM check into hotel  \nWalk around Kamiyacho  \nDinner\n\nWednesday, July 26: Peace Memorial Park  \nPeace Memorial Park Museum  \nExplore Peace Memorial Park  \nAtomic Bomb Dome\n\nThursday, July 27: Miyajima Island  \n\\~8:00 AM: Head to Miyajimagushi Station  \nBoard the ferry  \nMount Misen Ropeway, then 30 min. walk to summit  \nPossibly stop at Sanki-gongen-do Temple   \nMount Misen Observatory  \nTake ropeway back to the bottom  \nVisit Daishoin Temple or Itsukushima Shrine (are both worth it)?  \nDinner  \nDepart Miyajima via ferry by 6:00 PM  \n",

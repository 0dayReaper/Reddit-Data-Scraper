    "postText": "   I thought I had planned things out well, but after not getting the reservation times we wanted and shuffling around the schedule for when my son naps I realized the Itinerary got out of hand. I was hoping some of the more experienced travelers could help us see if this itinerary is still doable. We are trying to do a little bit of everything since we are limited on time and we are leaving in less than 2 weeks.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. If I plan to go to the Senso-ji and Asakusa-jinja Shrine would I miss out by skipping Meiji Jingu Shrine and Yoyogi Park?\n2. We have reservations for Shibuya Sky Already, so would it be more beneficial to skip the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building to visit Shinjuku? or maybe Ueno Park?\n3. My son and I are big anime and super sentai/Kamen rider fans so it sounds like we should aim to spend a lot of time in  Akihabara, but is getting there at 6 PM one of our days enough time? \n\nItinerary:\n\nDay      1: Sunday \n\n* 1:00 PM - Arrive at Narita Airport. (Clear customs, get luggage, get lunch/snacks, obtain pocket wifi/Suica cards, and ship luggage to Hotel.)\n* 3:00 PM - Leave Airport and take the train to Oedo Onsen Monogatari Urayasu Mengekyo \n   * No Reservation Needed\n* 9:00 PM - Find dinner at a local restaurant in the area\n   * Stop at 7/11 get some snacks near hotel\n* 10:00 PM - Return to the hotel.\n* Day      2: Monday \n* 7:00 AM - Wake up at the hotel.\n* 8:00 AM - Head to Ryogoku Kokugikan National Sumo Arena for Sumo Match\n   * \\*Reservation and Match starts at 8:30 AM\\*\n* 9:00 AM - Leave for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building \n   * \\*\\*\\*Or maybe head to Shinjuku?\\*\\*\\*\n* 10:30 AM - Leave for the Meiji Jingu shrine and Yoyogi Park \n   * \\*\\*\\*Maybe Cut this since we will be going to Senso-ji and Asakusa-jinja Shrine\\*\\*\\*\n* 12:30 PM - Leave for the Takeshita Street in Harajuku (Get Lunch)\n* 3:00 PM - Leave for Shibuya and see JUMP store, Nintendo Tokyo, MEGA DON Quijotes, Pokemon Center, and Hachiko Memorial Stature\n* 5:30 PM - Head to Shibuya Crossing and Shibuya SKY \n   * \\*Reservation is for 6PM\\*\n* 7:30 PM -Head to Yakiniku (Grilled Meat) Motoyama Shinjuku\n   * \\*Reservation is at 8PM\\*\n* Day      3: Tuesday \n* 7:00 AM - Wake up at the hotel.\n* 8:00 AM - Leave hotel for Tsukiji outer market \n* 10:00 AM - Leave for TeamLab Planets TOKYO\n   * \\*Reservation is for 10:30 AM\\*\n* 1:00 PM - Check out the Unicorn Gundam Statue in Odaiba and get Lunch\n* 4:30 PM - Visit Fuji Television Network \n   * \\*This is just a quick stop to take a picture like in Digimon\\*\n* 5:00 PM -Leave to Explore Ginza to go to UNIQLO Ginza, Nissan Crossing, Kabuki-za, etc.\n* 7:30 PM - Leave for Dinner at Koshiji Fugu Restaurant \u6d3b\u3075\u3050\u6599\u7406 \u8d8a\u8def  \n   * \\*Reservation is for 8PM\\*\n* Day      4: Wednesday \n* 7:00 AM - Wake up at the hotel.\n* 8:30 AM - Leave for the Imperial Palace( 9AM the first 300 people get free tour) \n* 9:00 AM - Leave for the Nakamise Shopping Street \n   * \\*Get Lunch here\\*\n* 11:00 AM - Visit the Asakusa Culture Tourist Info Center  \n* 12:00 PM Leave for Senso-ji and Asakusa-jinja Shrine \n   * \\*Reservation for a Family Kimono from Aiwafuku ([https://aiwafuku.com/qa/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/aiwafuku.com/qa/__;!!KZqq5pzTuXXlyJ9BfQ!Y8oSJeDB--h_-w4etPPzvYLiKs6Lbm00cclDtsN3o8xBZ9fD_UVUuEPyRJ25sDPMj_pDP2pPa_bdPXps4IU$)) is at 12 Noon\\*\n* 2:00 PM Head to the Ikebukuro for the Super Sentai Restaurant, Kotsumeitoikebukuroten, Gashapon Ikebukuro \n   * \\*\\*\\*Leave for Ueno Park\\*\\*\\* I don\u2019t think I can fit this in\n* 5:00 PM -Leave for Ameyayokocho shopping street\n* 6:00 PM - Head to Akihabara \n   * \\*At some point go to Gyukatsu Ichi Ni San for Dinner\\*\n   * \\*No reservation require\\*\n* Day      5: Thursday \n* 8:00 AM - Wake up at the hotel.\n* 10:00 AM - Check out of the hotel and head to Haneda Airport (average travel time: 60-90 minutes).\n* 5:00 PM - Flight departs from Haneda Airport.\n   * \\*Hang around the Airport I read there's a lot to do\\*\n\nAny help or advice is appreciated, thank you for your time.",

            "comment": "Very full days but probably doable - I would just note that if you\u2019re not familiar with the transit system I would err on giving yourself more time. Some of the scheduled leaving times around your reservations are a little tight for my personal travel style. Google maps may say one thing, but it could take you much longer to find platforms, figure out lines, have the train times sync up, and get to destinations from the stations, especially if you\u2019re in a group (with a child of napping age as well!).\n\nIf you have someone who really knows the transit/is comfortable reading and powering through directions (and corralling stragglers) please disregard this. I just personally try to be 10-15 minutes early for anything I have reserved.\n\nA side note - I really love Meiji Jingu Shrine. I find it unbelievable that such a quiet and peaceful place exists within Tokyo. If it\u2019s too far out of your way though, I suppose it can be skipped.",

This will at least have some more time for Monday. \n\nI also cut out Ameyayokocho and Ueno Park for Day 4, to add more time in Akihabara. I am trying to find time to add Ameyayokocho back in but if I can't its okay.\n\nIt seems like a lot of places close after 8 PM so some people have suggested cutting out or changing where we were going to eat so that we had more time to explore. At least to do things that would be good for a family with a little one. For example, I know nighttime Golden Gai is an awesome thing to do but isn't really a great place for my son ha.",

I spend a whole afternoon there (and I am just into video games, not into anime) and still felt like I could have spent several more hours there. Just so you know :) Have fun!",

I enjoyed seeing Senso-ji early in the morning before everything \u201copened up.\u201d Meiji Jingu impressed me - I enjoyed the walk through the park and the shrine itself.",

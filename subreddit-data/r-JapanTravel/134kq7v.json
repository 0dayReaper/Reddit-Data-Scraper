If you're lucky and check the website fairly often then maybe you still get some options by selecting the date that you want to go to. \n\nIt will say it's full but you can still select a date to see all the timestamps. The only way to get a reservation now is to check that day multiple times to see if you're lucky enough that someone has just cancelled their reservation.",

We were able to put the Suica card on an iPhone. Can we both use the one Suica card for two people? Or does everyone need their own?",

The bamboo forest is in Arashiyama, the western district and about a 20-30 minute train ride from Kyoto Station. Nishiki Market and the palace are in central Kyoto. And then Gion is in the eastern district. If you'd like to walk around in kimono, budget some extra time because walking in kimono naturally restricts your movement and your steps become smaller. For one day in Kyoto, I would choose one area and stick to it.\n\nFor kimono, what do you mean by voluptuous? That being said, there are some places that do have plus size kimono, but do know that plus size in Japan isn't necessarily plus size as we know it in North America. Still, it's best to e-mail the rental companies in advance to ask. If you give them your widest measurement, they'll be able to tell you if they have kimono that will fit you. Just Google \"plus size kimono rental in Kyoto\" and you should get some hits. FWIW my widest point is about 40\" around and with some finnagling, I can wear a standard kimono. A few inches more than that should also be fine, but beyond that, you're probably going to have to e-mail the rental companies to ask.",

In spring, it's not unusual to wait for 2-3 full buses to leave before you can board a bus to popular tourist areas like Gion. So, it's worth factoring in a little delay and hassle just moving around when you're planning adventures. \n\nArashiyama and Gion are on very much opposite sides of the city. And, each area has a great deal to explore, you could easily spend 3-4 hours in both just walking around. \n\nAs to kimono, they are beautiful, but they aren't comfortable for sightseeing. \n\nThey're meant to fall elegantly on a relatively straight up and down form, so if you're a little more curvy, they may bind towels around your waist during fitting to create an aesthetically more suitable shape. Then, you have 1-2 inner layers draped over you before the kimono itself. And, a wide, stiff obi roped very firmly around your midsection. If you're not already a slender person, this can make it quite uncomfortable to sit down as you're very much bound up with little room for manoeuvre. You're not able to walk freely, it's more of a half step shuffle, angling your feet as to not open your kimono. \n\nSo yes, rentals are great for special events and photographs, less so for extended walking around \u263a\ufe0f \n\n(It may be worth checking out yukata instead and purchasing a relatively affordable set, they're much more comfortable and wearable!)",

You can't do all 3 but if you plan things right, you could manage 2 of the 3.\n\nAs for kimono, how comfortable they are really depends on your tolerance. I collect kimono as a hobby and wear them on occasion. I can wear them all day if needed. However, I think what's the most difficult is the footwear. My friend and I did the kimono rental thing and her feet were in a lot of pain walking around all day in zori. I would consider even asking the rental company if you can just wear your own shoes if you plan on walking around in kimono.",

If you've ever been to an Asian supermarket, imagine something similar....except shoulder-to-shoulder crowded with people.\n\nOP's plan was to visit Nishiki Market *and* the Imperial Palace *and* Gion *and* the bamboo forest. They're all very spread out. I would say it'll be fast-paced but it's certainly possible to do Nishiki Market plus Gion/Higashiyama in one day, but definitely not Arashiyama in addition to all that.",

I don't think we're going to go to Arashiyama or Nishiki Market, but why would it not be possible to do something like start your morning in Arashiyama, have lunch somewhere, go to the palace for an hour or two, then take the bus/train to Nishiki Market walking to Hanamikoji Street to Nineizaka/Sanneizaka ending up at Kiyomizu-dera? How much time do I really need on these shopping streets? We are not big shoppers and would likely just peek into a few and take in the atmosphere. That route is only 30-40 minutes of walking and actually looks quite pleasant.",

It's relatively far out from most of the other Kyoto sights.\n\n\n2. Kyoto is usually insanely crowded. All of the places in question are famous and popular, so you can't walk quickly because there are too many people. If you want to take a picture of something, be prepared to wait for some of the crowds to move so you can get a clear shot.\n\n\n3. As I said, public transit in Kyoto is very lacking and relies a lot on buses. Foot traffic is busy, as I said, but so are the streets. Buses get snarled up in traffic easily and can take longer than expected.\n\n\n4. There is actually quite a lot in the Arashiyama and Higashiyama areas. You might have only the bamboo forest on the itinerary, but what if you end up liking the area and feel like staying? Higashiyama is the same - lots of little streets, shrines, and temples to possibly explore.\n\n\nI guess theoretically, you could do all those things in a day but it would be a shame not to leave some time to just....explore? I've been to Kyoto several times and on my last time, randomly found a temple dedicated to boars and it had tons of cute boar statues and merchandise. I was unexpectedly charmed by it! I never would have found it if my friend and I weren't just wandering around.\n\nIf you've never been to Kyoto before, budget time for getting lost, getting distracted, accidentally taking the wrong bus, or just getting caught up in the crowds. It's not always the easiest city to deal with.",

Took a bus to Nanzenji and wandered up to Ginkakuji. Took all morning and a little bit of the afternoon but I was also taking my time (I also went to find a couple of smaller temples but it was a public holiday and they were sadly closed). I imagine you could do Ginkakuji to Nanzenji in a morning pretty easily.\n\nKinkakuji is often considered a must for people but I'm probably in the minority in thinking it's overrated. If you've seen a picture of Kinkakuji on the Internet, then you've basically seen it. It's far from everything and when you get there, you fight a crowd of other tourists to take the same picture everyone else has. However, I know many many people who don't feel that way about it and think it's beautiful enough to warrant the trek out in that direction.\n\nI love Arashiyama but it's far. I would hate to take a 20-30 minute train out there just to see the bamboo forest, which only takes maybe 30 minutes max. Best to do something else in that direction, like the monkey park or some of the other temples there, to make it worth it. With that in mind, I would budget at least half a day there.\n\nI liked Nijo Castle personally. I liked hearing the Nightingale Floors and seeing all the painted screens. The plum blossoms were also in bloom when I went. However, I can see some people feeling bored with it if you're not into those sorts of things.\n\nI've never been to the Imperial Palace, honestly, so I can't comment on it.\n\nKiyomozudera is large, has gorgeous views, and has some interesting parts to it, so I feel like it's worth it.\n\nNanzenji is unique with its aqueducts, so I really like that temple.\n\nOn my last trip, I went to Eikando Temple nearby, which is famous for its fall foliage. I was there in February, though, so it was pretty empty. It's a large temple, though, so I had fun wandering around.\n\nYasaka Shrine in Gion is lovely at night. It's famous for its dance stage with a bunch of lanterns that get lit up after dark. It's rather boring in the day, though.\n\nIf you're still feeling energetic, you could check out Fushimi Inari Taisha. It's open 24 hours a day and is best before or after the majority of the tourists go, so basically, early in the morning or at night (but if you're there after dark, bring a flashlight or a fully charged phone because it's a lot of stairs and not much lighting). It's only a quick train ride south from Kyoto Station.",

Depending on how large/how much luggage you have, there are coin lockers in most train stations to stash things in. We traveled with 35L backpacks and were able to fit them into the smaller lockers. We used Suica on our phones and could load more money on within seconds using a stored Mastercard. There are known issues with Visa and they will not work using this method. We bought our JR passes from Klook and had no issues, I can't see why amusement parks would be any different.",

The bags tend to last a few International trips for me, before they get damaged, but they are the cheapest large suitcases I know of in Japan.  \n\nIn general, it is always cheaper to bring a bag as a check in than to mail it to the US.  Even if you have to pay $50 for another check in, it's likely going to cost you more than that to send stuff to yourself.  \n\nIt tends to be much harder to book window seats on the Fuji side of shinkansen, but I'm also not sure that you will even be able to see Mt. Fuji since sunset is at 6:40 pm.\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "To people travelling to Japan recently, from when the airplane lands to you being able to get out of the airport, how long does it take roughly? (getting luggage, immigration process, etc.)\n\nAsking this question cuz I'm supposed to land at 1.05pm and thinking to book another flight to Osaka intl. airport at 4.15pm. Not sure if that's cutting too tight.\n\nThank you all!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for helping everyone, we decided to book that plane \ud83d\ude00",

Having to do the full check-in process and/or change terminals would definitely add more time.\n\nThat said, three hours is a bit of a gamble.

Assuming you're going international into NRT, you *may* need to change terminals (which I'd expect to take \\~20-30 minutes all in) so that's another thing to factor in if you hadn't already and then go BACK through security, bag check, etc. (I'm guessing you already factored that in, but wasn't 100% sure if you were just thinking of luggage, immigration, etc. for entering Japan as opposed to checking in to a domestic flight). \n\nAnother consideration to make is if your departing flight into Japan changes its time. Assuming your booking these flights independently from each other (vs connecting flight), that's another risk worth assessing as well as other small delays like landing too early or slightly late and needing to wait for a parking spot (so to speak).\n\nFor me, just over 3 hours would give me more stress than I'd personally want to deal with (I'm currently trying to look into something similar-ish where we'll likely just fly early the next morning instead), but I'm very risk averse.

You can take the Chuo line to Tokyo Station and then walk, but it's going to take you a minimum of 30 minutes total, probably more like 45, since you also really don't want to miss your reservation.\n\nAs has been mentioned, Team Lab Planets is near Odaiba and no where near Asakusa.\n\nIf you are staying at the Oriental 2 nights, I don't know why you wouldn't plan to go to USJ on your second day when you're not coming from Kyoto.  I think it will take you a while to drop off your bags and get to the park, and that is time that is better spent getting to the park as early as possible.\n\nI think some of your days are full and unless you are use to heat and humidity, I think you underestimate how much it can wear you down.\n\nGood luck!",

It might be a better use of your time to visit the shrine the morning of the day you go to Nara - potentially the same day you transfer to Osaka.\n\nAlso agree with others that day 4 is way too packed. I don\u2019t know about them all but many places are not open very late. July 1- August 13, [Kiyomizu-dera](https://www.kiyomizudera.or.jp/en/location/#OpenHours) closes at 6:30 pm. It is a pretty large complex that I would allow at least one hour to walk through.",

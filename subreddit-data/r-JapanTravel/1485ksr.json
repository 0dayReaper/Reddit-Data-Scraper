    "postText": "Hello everyone! Like so many others, I will be travelling to Japan for the first time on 11/29-12/11. I have never planned a trip at this caliber before so I'm extremely nervous that I will forget something essential.  \n\n\nBelow is my tentative (and very messy) itinerary. Attractions at each location aren't in any particular order. Any item with an asterisk (\\*) is there if I have time, not mandatory.\n\n11/29 - Touchdown at Narita @ 5:30pm\n\n\\- Train to Tokyo to check in, relax, and explore if there is time\n\n11/30 - Tokyo - \n\nNakano Broadway  \nShinjuku  \nMeiji Jingu  \n\\*Nintendo store  \n\\*Starbucks reserve  \n\\*Ghibli Museum\n\nI'm thinking about adding another day here and adjust the rest of the days. Is it worth it?\n\n12/1-12/3 - Kyoto\n\nTravel to Kyoto\n\nKinkakuji shrine  \n\\* Gion district  \n\\*Sanneizaka  \nKiyumizudera  \nFushimi Inari\n\n12/4 - Hakone\n\nTravel to Hakone at 9am (maybe earlier?)\n\n\\-  Planning to send my luggage ahead to Osaka and just bring a backpack  \nHakone loop   \nCheck into ryokan in Gora  \nRelax for the rest of the day\n\n12/5 - 12/7 - Hakone/Osaka\n\nTravel to Osaka\n\nDay trip to Nara  \nKatsuo-ji  \nHimeji Castle  \nOsaka Aquarium  \nDotonbori\n\n12/8-12/11 - Tokyo\n\nTravel back to Tokyo\n\nTokyo skytree  \nSenso Ji  \nUeno Park  \nAkihabara  \n\\*Pokemon store  \nteamLab  \n\\*Gundam statue  \nDisney Sea\n\n12/11 early evening   \n\n\\- Travel back to Narita for flight back home\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions that I have:\n\n1. How do the sending of luggage work? Do you talk to someone at the place you're staying currently to send your luggage to the place you will be staying?\n2. I'm completely lost on which mode of transportation would work best. Suica? Icoca? JR pass viable with this itinerary?\n3. I'm looking to get a Goshuincho as a souvenir. Where is the best place to get one early with unique covers?\n\nThank you so much for any suggestions, critiques, and helpful notes in advance!!",

Himeji is not even close to Osaka - and why go to Kyoto just to come back to Hakone which is just an hour away from Tokyo? \n\nYou should do Tokyo-Hakone-Himeji-Kyoto-Osaka-Tokyo. Unless of course you\u2019ve made reservations in which case you do you. \n\nHimeji is a nice town but you don\u2019t have time for it so just stop for a few hours, visit the castle and move on.",

Even the cheapest option using the Hanshin and Sanyo railways can get you there in an hour and 40 minutes; it\u2019s really not bad at all, and a day trip there would be very reasonable. Heck, I see people suggesting Hiroshima day trips originating from Osaka all the time on this sub (which absolutely boggles my mind).\n\nI also don\u2019t see Himeji on the current itinerary; was it deleted?",

You can get it on Apple pay (or Japanese Android phones) or a physical card. And it's useful for other things like vending machines. Get one regardless of your JR Pass plans for train and subway lines that aren't run by JR. \n\nJR Pass you'll want to do some maths. Put your bullet train trips into google maps and check out the pricing and compare it to the price of the pass for a rough estimate. If you do go with it, please be aware the price is about to skyrocket in October. However you can buy a JR Pass exchange order that's valid for 3 Months, so if you want to get one, if I were you I would buy a exchange order in September and swap it over for a real pass when you're there.",

For any sizeable distance (eg, not same-city), your bags will take one overnight to arrive so you will need a separate smaller overnight bag for that evening. The hotel will tell you when your luggage needs to be at the front desk to be in time for pickup (eg 10am). \n\nWe sent bags from kyoto to hakone because we wanted to day trip in nara before heading to hakone and because getting to hakone is a multimodal trek (bullet train to nagoya, separate bullet to odawara, local train to hakone yumoto, bus to our hotel). So our second to last day in kyoto we took the luggage downstairs before 10am, spent the day/night in kyoto with overnight bag and then the following morning went to nara and then back to kyoto station to connect to our hakone leg. Luggage was in our hotel room at hakone like magic.\n\nWe also did it from hakone to tokyo because we wanted to check out, do some hakone museums and then go straight onto romancecar train without having to return to hotel.

            "comment": "I just came back from a very similar trip but we put Hakone between Tokyo and Kyoto. I went Tokyo - Hakone - Kyoto - Tokyo. We travel to Nara and Osaka by train from Kyoto. We got the JR pass, but I hear it will double in price in Oct so I'm not sure if it's worth it. JR Pass allows you to book your seat including the Shinkansen. We also fly into Haneda so we can take the monorail directly from the airport (fast &amp; easy). Most luggages up to the 29\" usually fits.\n\nFor Hakone, get the Hakone Free Pass (not free, just the name) and do the whole loop in a day.\n\nHere is the itinerary we follow for Hakone: [https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/course/244](https://www.hakonenavi.jp/international/en/course/244)\n\nFor luggages, call your hotel and ask if they accept deliveries. We found that some hotel will help you, but there's always a Yamato delivery service. In most cases we use their 2 day delivery service. For example, I ship my luggage from Tokyo to Kyoto and bring a smaller bag for my trip to Hakone.\n\nWhat you usually need for the delivery service is the destination hotel's address in full Japanese. In my situation, the workers at Yamato helped me a lot writing the delivery bill and I just have to write my name and phone number.\n\nAlthough we do get JR pass, we notice a lot of the subways will still require Suica or you can buy the ticket at the machine. The JR office at the airport should have a \"Welcome Package\" Suica where there is no charge for the card and you just have to fill in with the money and valid for 1 month. You can also use Suica at every Family Mart and 7-Eleven. Most of these convenient store are open 24/7 and have great selection of food and drinks.\n\nDownload the Navitime App and it will help you get around. If you have JR pass or other passes, it will take that into account when routing your trip. Navitime + Google Map is the best combination for getting my way around. If you do want a Shinkansen route, make sure you choose the station as Shin-Osaka instead of Osaka.",

            "comment": "If I was you as a solo traveller I'd want to give myself plenty of time to explore and wander. You're not shunting a family round, desperate to keep everyone entertained 24/7, so use the freedom you have. For instance, your trip seems very heavy on established attractions, which is cool if that's what you want, but 2 weeks isn't a long time. Make sure you give yourself breathing room just to wander around Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka. They have so much to offer and so much to stumble upon.\n\nFor example, instead of heading to the comically corporate Starbucks Reserve spend a little bit more time in Nakano, explore some of the winding backstreets next to the broadway- find a little cafe and just chill for a bit. You'll find the quiet little joys Japan has to offer much more memorable and come back with some nice stories to tell.",

            "comment": "Sending luggage with assistance by your hotel varies. Not all hotels will do this. You\u2019ll want to confirm before booking whether they can send luggage for you.\n\nHowever, the Japan Post will deliver. Most hotels will receive prepaid luggage delivery sent from the post office. (You\u2019ll want to confirm as well that your hotel will receive luggage. Should not matter what service delivers.) \n\nYou can go to the post office and request a form for [Yuu Pack](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/service/you_pack/index_en.html) (despite that this site doesn\u2019t say luggage specifically, that is how you do it). You fill out your name and current hotel as your address, then your name again and the next hotel as your address, with your check-in and reservation date. You also fill in what date you want your luggage to arrive. Best to make it at least 1 day in advance in case of unexpected delay. Then you pay a reasonable low rate to deliver. Depends on the size of your bag. I think we spent $40 to send one large suitcase and two small duffels.\n\nAnother option for similarly low prices is to go to the [SAGAWA luggage delivery](https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/servicecenter/kyoto_station.html) counter. They will provide the same service. Likewise with [Takuhaibin](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2278.html).\n\nWhether you go through your hotel or another service, make sure you contact the hotel you are sending to and let them know your luggage will be delivered.",

Itineraries like this make me tired and stressed just by looking at them.\n\n&gt; I have never planned a trip at this caliber before\n\nIf you haven't planned a trip like this before, why make it so ambitious. We spent a full 12 days in Japan and only visited Tokyo and Kyoto. I could easily spend another 12 days in the same 2 cities and not repeat anything because there is just so much to see and do in each city. Jumping around like this makes no sense to me, especially if you are not an experienced traveller and don't speak language.",

No worries though, I will definitely enjoy each location and not gonna rush around trying to hit all the spots. If I finish one item on my list and I have time for more, at least I have something waiting for me (on my list) rather than doing research on where to go next and how to get there during the trip. I think for this trip, is more of a taste-of-japan kind of trip. I don't doubt that there are plenty to do in the larger cities. And I'll be a bit more experienced on what to do the next time I come.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI would think it would make more sense to go Tokyo to Hakone to Kyoto to Osaka rather than wasting the time going from Kyoto to Hakone to Osaka to Tokyo.  You could do Tokyo to Kyoto to Osaka to Hakone to Tokyo, but if you plan to shop in Kansai, I would go to Hakone first.\n\nOdawara (the JR stop closest to Hakone-Yumoto Station) is 30 minutes by shinkansen or 81 minutes by local train from Tokyo Station.  It's close to 2 hours from Kyoto and Osaka.  Osaka is 30 minutes to 1 hour from Kyoto by local transport depending on your starting point and ending point within Osaka.\n\nWhy waste time going backwards for no reason?\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1 Yes, most hotels offer this service.  You would need to make sure it is offered by your hotel ahead of time.  I know there are hotels that don't offer it, I've just never stayed at a hotel that didn't.\n\nSuica and ICOCA and PASMO are just IC cards.  [https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359\\_003.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html)\n\nThey are just prepaid cards so you don't need to calculate out train or bus fares every time you get on a train or bus.  You only need one IC card unless for some reason you want to make them into souvenirs and collect various ones.  But you don't need multiple ones.\n\nGenerally, you will take a shinkansen between Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka.  How you get between Kyoto and Osaka will depend on where you are staying in both.\n\nFor Goshuin, I would do a search.  I know there are past reddit threads as well as websites showing various covers.  The covers really can vary a lot.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/eu1v35/looking\\_for\\_interesting\\_and\\_unique\\_goshuin\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/eu1v35/looking_for_interesting_and_unique_goshuin_and/)\n\nI think that is the thread.",

Thanks for that advice!!\n\nYou put me at ease in terms of the IC cards. I though each card was accepted in certain regions so I would need multiple travel around their respective regions.\n\nI'll look into that thread. Thank you! I originally wasn't planning on getting that book, but as I was looking into the temples/shrines and just seeing how beautiful they are, I started adding them into my list. And that book sounded like a great item to document the places I've been to.",

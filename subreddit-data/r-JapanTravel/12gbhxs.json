    "postText": "So like many others on this subreddit, I was a bit concerned about getting to Super Nintendo World especially after having to purchase tickets through Klook (we were unable to use the USJ app or the official website to buy tickets, even with the Safari + Amex Apple Pay combination that worked for many others). We also bought tickets too close to the date to be able to buy express passes, so we were SOL there. Our only hope was to get to the park early and see what we could scrounge up for timed entry tickets.\n\nTurns out if you get there early enough, you don\u2019t need timed entry tickets and you can walk straight into the park, which was what we did! But by \u201cearly\u201d, I mean earlier than you think. As a caveat, my SO and I woke up at 5AM to take the train to the park by 6AM (opening time was 8AM); when we got there, hordes of people began to run from the Universal City train stop to the Universal queue. Mind you, this wasn\u2019t even a queue for entry- it was the secondary queue for the primary queue to the gates of the park. By 6:15, there were already incredibly long lines out the door, but we were close enough to the front that it wasn\u2019t too much of a concern. However, if you weren\u2019t able to grab express passes like we did and really want to cross off Nintendo World from your bucket list, getting there at 6AM is probably your safest bet.\n\nAt 7AM they started letting people in. We made a beeline for Nintendo World and followed the mad rush of Mario and Luigi hats to the area. (Ran straight down the main road and took a right until we saw Jurassic, and then another right) To our surprise, when we got there no one was checking timed entry tickets, and were waving at us to go into the green pipes. We got into Nintendo World around 7:45 and almost immediately got on line for the Mario Kart ride, which was only a 15 minute wait. We then hopped on over to the Yoshi ride which was a slightly longer 20 minute wait, but nothing like the 60 minute waits the rides turned into later on in the day. I personally don\u2019t think either ride was worth more than a 30 minute wait but it was a cool experience.\n\nWe lined up for Toad\u2019s cafe at 8:45AM for a 9AM opening; by then, there was already a long line for the restaurant which moved at a decent pace. We placed our orders and were seated by 9:30. The food was absolutely adorable and we enjoyed the mystery box tiramisu most of all. \n\nWe opted not to get the wristbands because by the time we had gotten out of the cafe, the queue for wristband challenges were also incredibly long. We opted to browse the gift shops and spent a lot more money than we want to admit, but everything is just so cute and I wish I could have bought out the store.\n\nWhen we got out of Nintendo World, the line was even longer and staff had began checking for timed entry passes. When we checked later at 11AM, the timed entry passes were all gone on the app. (But when we checked around 10, there were timed entry passes available for 1, 2, and 3PM.) All in all, we are happy with our experience and we got to enjoy a relatively empty park for a couple of hours before the true crowd came in.",

We got to Nintendo World at the ass crack of dawn and got super lucky with the wait times, but when we got out of the Nintendo World area, lines for other rides in other areas of the park were already super full with an average of 60-90 minute waits. \n\nThat being said- if I could do if again, I\u2019d get express passes for a different ride like the Hollywood Dream or Jurassic World (I\u2019m not a huge fan of coasters so it wasn\u2019t too much of an issue but my SO was sad we couldn\u2019t go on!). We\u2019d get there closer to 6AM than 6:15, run to Nintendo World, do what I did today, and save money on the express pass for Nintendo World at least- then I\u2019d use the express pass for another ride. I\u2019m from the States, so the rest of Universal wasn\u2019t too much of a priority for me since I can always experience a similar time in Florida/the Americacore themes were a bit too familiar haha. But Nintendo World is only available in Japan, so we definitely prioritized that.",

Spiderman, Harry potter forbidden journey and Jurassic Park are great fun so long as you don't mind not understanding the Japanese dialogue. If you do mind, I would advise trying those rides at other Universal studios parks as these rides are identical in a number of the parks AFAIK. \n\nThat being said I don't think any ride at USJ is worth an hour or more of lining up. The Hollywood dream rollercoaster had lines above 90 minutes all day long so I never tried it, seemed like fun though.\n\nHarry Potter area much like Nintendo area is a nice and decently immersive experience.\n\nFor anyone that's really into rollercoasters, I can't recommend FujiQ Highland enough. Much less busy and incredible rollercoasters.",

We were able to walk in to the Happiness Cafe in the Minions/San Francisco area of the park.\n\nIf you are going to USJ or Tokyo Disneyland and you want to eat a full meal, book reservations for the restaurants.",

I don\u2019t think there was anything for the next few days, if I was looking at it correctly.\n\nWe ended up getting snack foods until dinner time when we found a \u201cChinese\u201d restaurant on that same side of the park that had some excellent noodle bowls (ramen) and had no reservation requirements. They had wax food by the door to pick your meal and someone with a ticket pad moved down the line and took your order where you paid and the counter at the back passed your meal out on a tray. You took it outside to eat. They blew our minds with the [soft boiled egg](https://imgur.com/a/GjKAc8Z)\u2026",

This all sounds super sad and miserable. I knew it was popular, but damn, I didn\u2019t know this was so oversaturated to the point of ruining the fun for so many people.\n\nPretty disappointed and now I might be discussing not going anymore with my husband and trying to get a refund on the tickets. I hate that in the modern world you need like five different tickets to get into a theme park, waiting, lines, reservations on apps and phones, it\u2019s just a mess and really sucks the fun out of these things.

I honestly feel sorry for the daughter and his wife, but you as a father should know better how to word it better rather than making these accusation\n\nWe know who the bigger person was (my partner) I would not stand by anyone who talks shit to my partner after today. So if I ever meet you again you have warned and if you read this you know who you are. \n\nI honestly don't understand what you achieve when you get through the gates before 2 people and when you will most likely be in line regardless of the attraction if you are not the very first one who are first there\n\nDon't let my experience deter you, just line up and enjoy your day. Just go straight to the super mario land and first thing in the morning and you will be set followed by rest of the attractions of your preference.",

What do you all think of my are of scoring a pass (aka timed ticket) to Nintendo World at Universal Studios?\n\nI have looked at the 'express pass' but the cost more than doubles the standard entry to Universal which is out of my budget. So from the looks of it I am left with only a standard Universal Ticket entry and then trying to secure the Nintendo World entry via the Universal Studios app &amp; hope they aren't all allocated.\n\nFrom reading this post and others it appears that Universal is SUPER busy and even if you rock up before the park officially opens, chances are low to score a Nintendo World pass  (main attraction for universal studios to me - not worth going if can't see Nintedo World).",

My uncle who's with them is a HUGE Nintendo fan but they don't really have an express pass so I can only hope they get in and can enjoy it...\n\nSorta weird question, would you happen to know if the kid's meal from Toad's Cafe can be ordered by well, not kids?",

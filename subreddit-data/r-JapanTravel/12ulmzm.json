    "postText": "I  am planning a 10 days one way trip (early Oct, 2023) from KIX to NRT  covering Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Hokane and Tokyo. Initially I wanted only  Tokyo and Hokane only but 10 days I can cover more and I don't want to  do round trip between Hokane - Tokyo. Will the following make sense? I  am traveling with my mother in law and I doubt she would want to walk as  much as my wife, her friend and I would.\n\nDay 1:\n\n* Arrival at KIX airport in the afternoon\n* Travel to Osaka\n* Check into accommodation in Osaka\n* Evening: visit Dotonbori for dinner and explore the area\n\nDay 2:\n\n* Morning: visit Osaka Castle\n* Afternoon: visit Shitennoji Temple and explore the surrounding area\n* Evening: free time in Osaka\n\nDay 3:\n\n* Morning: travel to Kyoto\n* Afternoon: visit Fushimi Inari Shrine\n* Evening: check into ryokan in Kyoto and enjoy the onsen\n\nDay 4:\n\n* Morning: visit Kiyomizu-dera Temple\n* Afternoon: explore the Gion district\n* Evening: visit Yasaka Shrine and its lantern festival\n\nDay 5:\n\n* Morning: travel to Nara\n* Afternoon: visit Todai-ji Temple and its famous Great Buddha statue, and explore Nara Park\n* Evening: travel back to Kyoto and enjoy the nightlife\n\nDay 6:\n\n* Morning: travel to Hakone\n* Afternoon: check into your ryokan in Hakone and enjoy the onsen\n* Evening: free time in Hakone\n\nDay 7:\n\n* Morning: visit the Hakone Open-Air Museum\n* Afternoon: take a boat ride on Lake Ashi and a cable car ride up to Owakudani Valley\n* Evening: return to your ryokan in Hakone and enjoy the onsen\n\nDay 8:\n\n* Morning: travel to Tokyo\n* Afternoon: check into accommodation in Tokyo and explore the Shinjuku district\n* Evening: free time in Tokyo\n\nDay 9:\n\n* Morning: visit Tsukiji Market for breakfast and see the famous tuna auction\n* Afternoon: visit Meiji Shrine\n* Evening: visit Shibuya Crossing and experience the neon lights and energy of Tokyo\n\nDay 10:\n\n* Morning: visit the Imperial Palace East Garden\n* Afternoon: visit Odaiba and enjoy the views of the Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo Bay\n* Evening: travel to Narita airport for departure flight at 5 pm.\n\nIs this too loose or I can pack a few more destination? The daily activities are not in particular order, feel free to suggest.\n\nI have 2 concerns:\n\n\\-  What kind of transportation arrangement I should make? If JR Pass worth  it for my trip? I was told to combine a few passes but I have no idea  where to start.\n\n\\- Luggages - when we move around the country and staying at different places, show should I manage the luggages?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "In general, this seems too busy for 10 days. Most people do this 'golden route' itinerary over about 2 weeks. I'd suggest dropping a couple of destinations.\n\nAs some specific comments:\n\n* The Tsukiji Fish Market closed several years ago. The fish auctions relocated to a new market, and seem to be much less accessible to tourists.\n* If your flight from Narita departs at 5, you'll need to leave central Tokyo by about 1pm, so day 10 isn't doable.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by your question about luggage. You can store luggage at hotels before and after you check out of them, and there are luggage lockers at most large train stations.",

            "comment": "Does not seem too bad, the content of each day seems realistic. Maybe appart from day 10, especially if they want to leave luggage somewhere and pick it up before going to the airport. In that case doing something close to the hotel in the morning of departure May make sense.\n\nTrue about the wholesale market being close. Now the market (toyosu) is not freely available to walk around but they have a viewing deck for the tuna auction, that is if you wake up early enough to get there on time (and figure a way to go before the train run).\n\nI think they ask what to do with luggage to move it. There is two main options, you move it yourself and bring it before check it, leave it after check out or put in locker. The other option is luggage delivery service. You can usually do it from hotel to hotel or airport to hotel, it\u2019s also not same day delivery in most case. For Hakone, you can get it shipped between Hakone-Yumoto station and your accommodation (same day delivery if you are in time). This way you do not have to mange your luggage in the train/bus. Honestly, I am always moving my stuff myself as it is a manageable size.",

            "comment": "We just got back from a similar trip last week, though we started a Tokyo and moved east.  We took 2 weeks to do ours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPass definitely not worth it.  We didn't get a pass for ours and pass is really only worth it if you are doing a return trip on Tokaido line (Tokyo to Kansai and back) or going somewhere further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf doing 2 days in Hakone think about the Hakone free pass.  Depending on what time you get in/stay in Hakone maybe do the open air museum in the daytime first day.  It took us 2-3 hours to do.  Otherwise you might want to start the loop with the boat, ropeway, cable car then train down or walk from Gora to the open air museum ( 1 train stop down or about 15-20 min walk)  Or start with open air and continue the loop by going to Gora, cable car, etc.  Make sure you have dinner arrangements probably at the Ryokan, at least in Yumoto stuff tends to close early (I think we found 2 restaurants open past 7).  Boat ride is about 45 min -1 hour and you are probably waiting +/- 30 min to get on depending on how busy it maybe worth it to pay the addl 400 yen to get the vip boat( if you get the free pass).  TBH if you get to Hakone Early enough you can probably do most things in 1 day.  For this leg it might be worth it to pack your Hakone clothes and ship the rest of your baggage to Tokyo( it will probably be at least 1 transfer most likely from Odawara if not more),  we loved not making this leg with our big bags. It cost us anywhere from $15-25 per bag depending on size/weight. Hotel front desk  in Kyoto should be able to help.  We only did 1 night since Ryokans here tended to be pretty pricey, but if you really like ryokans then by all means do 2 nights.  I felt like a day and half was plenty and we really could have done 1 day had we planned a bit better (did open air museum first, got to the top of the mountain around 4 ish and ran out of time to finish the loop so we backtracked and redid loop the next morning( it probably cost us 1.5 to 2 hours thoguh its a nice train ride).  We were out around 2pm ish after a hike from boat area to Amesake tea house and bus back to Yumoto ( check the bus times it only comes once an hour so that can kill a lot of time if you are waiting for it).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne other thing to think about, depending on how big your luggage is,  go from Osaka -&gt;Nara -&gt; Kyoto.  It will cut down on at least a 40 min train ride,  Can probably throw luggage in a locker in Nara.  If you are only gonna hit Toda-ji and Nara park you can probably speed run it in like 2-3 hours.  We ended up doing that after going to Yoshino the morning til after lunch (it was Cherry Blossom Season).  Got there at 330-4, hit Toda-ji, walked around the park and fed deer, found dinner close to the station then got back to Kyoto Station probably around 8:30-9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRe: Tokyo - We did Toyosu for breakfast, you just kinda look through a window so its not that interesting imho.  If you are tight on time I would second maybe skipping that/Tsujiki.  If you are doing Meiji Jingu, it might be worth allocating a little time to walk Harajuku/Omotesando since they are right there.  We also really enjoyed Asakusa/Skytree.  Give yourself ample time for Tokyo Station the last day cuz its a maze if you aren't used to it( like seriously 45-1 hr if you are buying your tickets to Narita there.  The NEX train is at the very bottom if I recall and about 3000 yen per person as of this past March.  If there are 4 of you and your baggage isn't huge maybe a taxi is better though no idea how much that would cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck and Enjoy your trip!",

If time allow on the arrival, I want to do Open Air Museum, Ropeway to Owakudani Valley. Next day take the bus from Gora south to Moto-Hokane, Heiwa no Torii, Pirate Boat, Ropeway back to Gora and stayed for a night at a cheap inn in Gora or Hakone-Yumoto.\n\nIn Day 9, I plan to visit Tsukiji Outer Market, Sushi Dai at Toyosu, and Ariake. I might adjust my stay at Villa Fontaine at Ariake and I can do some shopping and see the rainbow Bridge.\n\nIn terms of luggage, we are likely carrying at 4x 27\" and maybe a couple of hand carry. I would definitely utilize the luggage transportation service between hotels or locker. I just worry the 27\" luggage will have a hard time finding empty ones.",

    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m in the process of planning our honeymoon (yay!) which we will be spending around 3 weeks in Japan. I\u2019ve been 3 times before, but it\u2019ll be my fiance\u2019s first time.\n\nThe trip will be in early April, 2024. I want to plan the trip to be fairly slow-paced and romantic. Interests-wise, we both love nature (forests/ocean/mountains/waterfalls, all that good stuff), traditional art and architecture, gardens and a little bit of retro manga/videogames but that\u2019s not a priority.\n\nWe\u2019re both artists and want to be able to sit in most locations for a while to paint the scenery and relax. I'm very keen to see the cherry blossoms and ukiyo-e museums, fiance is keen to see Zen gardens and anything Street Fighter related (?)\n\nWe're a bit on the older side, so stuff like nightlife and partying is not a priority. We're more keen to just have a chill and quiet time (sakura season crowds aside).\n\nDespite having already visited Japan 3 times, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m great at planning, and my previous trips have involved wasting a bunch of time and also winding up not visiting a lot of things on my lists because I ended up too tired, lol. So I\u2019m posting this in the hopes I can get some feedback on things like:\n\n\\- Are we missing anything crucial for a first-timer?\n\n\\- Are we travelling too slowly? Are we travelling too FAST?\n\n\\- Does the flow of travel make sense, and do the things I\u2019ve chosen for each day make sense transit-wise ie are they not too far apart from each other?\n\n\\- Flights and accommodation are already booked, though I can change accommodation if necessary.\n\n\\- Has anything changed since my last trip in 2019 that we need to know about? For instance I heard that Hyperdia doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\n\n\\- I also know that the JR pass is going up excessively in price, so I have done some research and looks like it might be worth getting a few regional passes instead? Feedback/advice on this would be welcome!\n\nOkay, so here is what I have planned so far!\n\nThings with the star (\u2b50\ufe0f) emoji are unmissable, and everything else is \u201cif we have time/feel like it\u201d.\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback!!\n\n**PRE-TRAVEL**\n\nPurchase JR East Tohoku Area Pass and JR Kansai Wide Area Pass\n\nPre-purchase Tokaido shinkansen tickets on SmartEX\n\nSet up Ubigi e-sims on phones\n\n**Day 0 (Tuesday)**\n\n\\- Flight lands at Narita Airport at 18:35\n\n\\- Check into hotel in Kinshicho for 5 nights\n\n**Day 1 (Wednesday)**\n\n\\- Asakusa (\u2b50\ufe0fSenso-ji, Sumida Park river walk to look at cherry blossoms)\n\n\\- Shinjuku (Shinjuku Gyoen, New York bar, Golden Gai)\n\n**Day 2 (Thursday)**\n\n\\- Harajuku (\u2b50\ufe0fMeiji Jingu, Ota Memorial Museum, B-Side Label)\n\n\\- Shibuya (Scramble Crossing, \u2b50\ufe0fCapcom store, Sakura Street)\n\n**Day 3 (Friday)**\n\n(Day trip to Nikko - purchase Nikko World Heritage Pass)\n\n\\- Shin-kyo Bridge\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fToshogu Shrine and surrounds\n\n\\- Kanman-ga-Fuchi Abyss\n\n**Day 4 (Saturday)**\n\n(Activate JR East Tohoku Area Pass)\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fKoishikawa Korakuen garden\n\n\\- Akihabara (Mandarake, Super Potato, etc)\n\n**Day 5 (Sunday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fSumida Hokusai Museum\n\n\\- Travel to Sendai / check into Sendai hotel for 3 nights\n\n\\- Free time in Sendai\n\n**Day 6 (Monday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fYamadera temple\n\n\\- Optional: cherry blossom viewing in town\n\n\\- Optional: Zuihoden Mausoleum\n\n**Day 7 (Tuesday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fMatsushima bay, Fukuurajima\n\n\\- Saigyo Modoshi no Matsu Park\n\n**Day 8 (Wednesday)**\n\n(JR East Tohoku Pass expires)\n\n\\- Travel to Hakone in the morning / check into Hakone ryokan for 1 night\n\n\\- Free time in Hakone Yumoto, Gora\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fEnjoy fancy ryokan stay in Gora\n\n**Day 9 (Thursday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fHakone ropeway to Togendai Station\n\n\\- Hike from ropeway terminal to Hakone Shrine and Old Tokaido Road via Ancient Cedar Avenue\n\n\\- Travel to Kyoto / check into Kyoto hotel for 6 nights\n\n**Day 10 (Friday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fFushimi Inari Taisha\n\n\\- Gion (Yasaka Jinja, Shimbashi Street, Hanamikoji Street)\n\n**Day 11 (Saturday)**\n\nHalf-day trip to Sekigahara (fianc\u00e9\u2019s special interest/request)\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fVisit Sekigahara battleground\n\n\\- Sekigahara Memorial Museum\n\n\\- Afternoon in Kyoto: Daitokuji temple\n\n\\- Optional: Philosopher\u2019s Path\n\n**Day 12 (Sunday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fRyoan-ji\n\n\\- Higashiyama, Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Yasaka Koshindo shrine\n\n\\- Kiyomizu-dera\n\n**Day 13 (Monday)**\n\n(Activate JR Kansai Wide Area Pass)\n\nDay trip to Nara\n\n\\- Todai-ji temple, \u2b50\ufe0fNara Park, Naramachi\n\n**Day 14 (Tuesday)**\n\n\\- Arashiyama (\u2b50\ufe0fBamboo forest, Tenryu-ji, Gio-Ji, old street, etc)\n\n\\- Manga museum\n\n**Day 15 (Wednesday)**\n\n\\- Travel to Takamatsu\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fRitsurin Koen\n\n\\- Check into ryokan in Takamatsu for 2 nights\n\n**Day 17 (Thursday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fMegijima/Ogijima Island\n\n\\- Explore Takamatsu town, castle etc.\n\n**Day 18 (Friday)**\n\n(JR Kansai Wide Area Pass expires)\n\n\\- Travel to Okayama\n\n\\- Stopover in Okayama (\u2b50\ufe0fKorakuen garden)\n\n\\- Return to Tokyo\n\n\\- Check into hotel in Ginza for 4 nights\n\n**Day 19 (Saturday)**\n\n\\- \u2b50\ufe0fVisit my friend\u2019s cafe (in Minamiazabu)\n\n\\- Optional: Tokyo Tower\n\n\\- Optional: Shinjuku (stationery shopping, Omoide Yokocho)\n\n**Day 20 (Sunday)**\n\n\\- Nakano Broadway (retro anime merch)\n\n\\- Free time (this was going to be Ghibli Museum, but we baulked at the process needed to get tickets - would love some advice on how to fill this in?)\n\n**Day 21 (Monday)**\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fDay trip - Kamakura\n\n\\- Daibutsu hiking trail\n\n\\- Kotoku-in\n\n\\- Cape Inamuragasaki\n\n\\- Komachi-dori\n\n\\- Tsuruoka Hachimangu\n\n\\- Hokoku-ji\n\n**Day 22 (Tuesday)**\n\n\\- Free time before flight\n\n\\- Optional: shopping at Itoya, Tokyu Hands\n\n\\- Optional: Hibiya Park or Imperial Palace gardens\n\n\\- Or do anything else we missed out on previously?\n\n\\- Travel to airport to return home\n\n\\- leave city by 4pm, be at airport no later than 6pm.\n\n\\- Flight departs 20:05\n\n(Edited for formatting issues, I'm a Reddit noob)",

It has world class museums ( with Monet and other famous artists), amazing galleries, public baths, coffee shops etc. You can take a bike there or use buses to get around.",

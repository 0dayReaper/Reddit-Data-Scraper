    "postText": "Hi! I'm 25F traveling to Fukuoka with my 58 y.o. dad next week. It's our 4th time in Japan but first time in Fukuoka/Kyushu. Would love to get your inputs on our itinerary and some advice on some stuff at the bottom of my post: \n\n**Day 0:** \n\n* ETA to hotel (Hakata) - 6PM\n* Canal City Hakata (Open to recos for food around the area)\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n* Fukuoka Castle\n* Ohori Park\n* Lunch at Sand Goto/Chabukama\n* Homachiame Coffee or Apartment Coffee Door\n* Fukuoka Art Museum\n* Dinner at Udon Biyori\n* Dessert at Medetaiya ropponmatsu/Hep Donuts/Ropponpon\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n* The Shops Daimyo\n* Lunch at Shin Shin\n* Manu Coffee\n* Tenjin Underground Mall\n* Dinner at Yatai across Tenjin: Kokinchan, Genkai, Yatai Mamichan\n* Dessert at Hakata Hiiragi Taiyaki/Nana's Green Tea/I'm Donut\n\n**Day 3**\n\n* Tochoji Temple &amp; Hakata Machiya Folk Museum OR Fukuoka Asian Art Museum before we fly home in the afternoon. Open to food recos in these areas.\n\n\\--\n\n**Also looking for advice/recos on:**\n\n1. **Pocket wifi vs. e-sim:** I'm thinking of using Ubigi. I see people recommend this but it only has 8 reviews on istore so..\n2. **Summer/rainy season essentials/etiquette:** I'm from the PH where it's very hot and humid so I was wondering if I can just wear the same outfits or if it'd be cooler there at that time. When it rains, are there places that lend umbrellas or is it something that I'd have to buy? Where do you put them when you enter a mall or resto?\n3. **Local fashion brand (womens):** I'll be doing some shopping so I wanted recos on Japanese clothing brands other than Uniqlo or GU (but around the same price points)",

Ensure you dont leave maps or the like running in the back ground Not sure if the deduct data in set package size each time you use the net. \n\nWe saw lots of people with cheap clear plastic umbrellas. I did see some for sale at what I thought to be quite cheap. We had packed our own for convenience.\n\nMany restaurants shops etc will have places to leave your wet umbrellas. No problem.\n\nSummer there was shorts and T shirts for me. Not blazing hot, but hot enough and quite humid in summer.",

It\u2019s worked well so far and easier than carrying around a pocket wifi which I\u2019ve used on past trips. \nI got the 50gb 30 day plan but doesn\u2019t look likely that I will use it all!\nUbigi gives you referral codes when you buy a plan, let me know if you want me to share mine, it gives you 20% off I understand.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty hot and humid at present, I haven\u2019t had the need to wear more than one layer.\n\nWe found a lot of places (incl Fukuoka Art Museum ) are closed on Mondays, so something to keep in mind for your itinerary.\n\nMost stations/malls/museums have plastic umbrella covers you can use (and reuse). \n\nWe are catching the ferry from Hakata to Nokonoshima flower park island tomorrow :)",

Tried to set it up earlier and I\u2019m stuck at \u201cwaiting for Ubigi cellular connectivity\u201d which I suspect isn\u2019t working cause I\u2019m not there yet. \n\nand thanks for the heads up on fukuoka art museum! I have a question on that actually. Not sure if you have inputs here but would you know if it\u2019s worth going both to the Fukuoka art museum and fukuoka Asian art museum?",

            "comment": "Some feedback:\n-  Day 3: Definitely enough time for Parco mall if you explore Teamlabs first thing in morning\n-  Day 4:  Skytree is the highest but inferior compared to Shibuya Sky or Mori observatory. Recommend including Shibuya Sky or Mori to day 3\n-  Day 5: You are going to Kyoto and didn\u2019t bother to check the famous temple and sights in the city? I think its a missed opportunity. \n-  Day 6: Not ideal to stay in Kyoto if you are visiting USJ today. You want to be early in USJ to maximize your day\n\nOverall my feedback is wow. You only have 9 days since day 1 and last day is essentially for travel and with 2 full theme park days, leaves you 7 days for Tokyo-Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe-Nara . Too many places while missing so many attractions in Kyoto.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Remove Kobe from the list\n- Visit one of the theme parks to have more time if needed\n- Stay extra day in Kyoto, you are missing so many aspects of Kyoto\u2026 gion, kiyomizu deea, arashiyama, torii gates, etc.\n- If possible, fly out of KIX?\n- There is really not many interesting Onsen near Kyoto. There is Spa world in Osaka however\u2026",

This is fantastic stuff!\n\nDay 3: teamlabs is first thing and I don\u2019t mind going first thing.\n\nDay 4: I\u2019ve heard that as well and will more than likely switch it to shibuya sky. \n\nDay 5:  we are very much foodies so that comes first, as much as I\u2019d like to see more of the historical aspect I really wanted to see Osaka and Nara. \n\nDay 6: I thought USJ was close to Kyoto? Would there be a better location for staying? \n\nI have some time on the last last day before heading to the airport. It\u2019s an afternoon flight but I didn\u2019t really want to book anything to avoid possibly missing my flight but there is some time there.\n\nI really want to avoid missing Kobe because we are excited for the beef. I\u2019d be willing to scrap USJ if needed but it seems fun. Can\u2019t fly in from anywhere else. I can however remove some hot springs to make more time if needed or for better options.",

                            "comment": "Spoiler: Kobe beef is not from Kobe city. It's from Hyogo prefecture. It's called Kobe beef because the promotional/certifying agency is based there.\n\nJapan actually has several varieties of very good quality beef, and you can get in more than most cities. No need to go to any specific city.\n\nhttps://sugoii-japan.com/different-types-of-wagyu-beef\n\nUnless the restaurant is personally meaningful, I suggest not planning your trip around restaurants. Just explore and sit down in any one that looks interesting. As long as the online reviews aren't terrible, you'll likely have a good time. I've only ever booked a handful of restaurants ever, and only 2 I thought was worth the effort to arrange my itinerary around. One was an omakase restaurant that sat just 8 people, the other was Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai's restaurant (even managed to meet the man himself).",

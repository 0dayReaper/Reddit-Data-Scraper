Easiest would be Nozomi to Kyoto and then JR Hashidate to Amanohashidate station, but it doesn't fully mesh up with my plan to get a JR Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass. The pass is not valid for the Shin-Osaka to Kyoto part of the trip. It's been hard to find out what exactly happens if I try to pay with the pass for a Hiroshima-Kyoto-Amanohashidate trip. Is it possible to pay a little extra just for the non-pass-covered part? Alternatively I could change trains earlier, but that'd be at least one train change more. Any logistics tips for this part welcome.\n\nI assume Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass is most cost-effective for this? If I fly directly to Hiroshima and activate it on the day of leaving out, Hiroshima-Amanohashidate-Osaka makes it pay off plenty well.\n\nI was thinking of stopping by Meiji-mura in Nagoya on the way from Osaka to Atami, but with it being a bit far away from Nagoya station, think I'll just skip it and have a relaxing day in Atami.\n\nAre the locations otherwise reasonably placed in relation to each other? Most places are 0-1 train change rides away from each other. How about time dedicated per each location?\n\nInterested in seeing some scenic vistas (hence two of the Three Views of Japan / Nihon Sankei, Mt. Omuro and Jogasaki coast).\n\nCriticism appreciated.",

We didn\u2019t realize this until we were at Kyoto and the lines for the ticket machines were crazy long (the line for someone to help you was even longer). It made the situation pretty stressful as we only had 25 minutes to change trains! \n\nI think you can just buy a separate ticket from Shin-Osaka to Kyoto? It shouldn\u2019t cost that much extra.",

I'm surprised more people don't do this for some reason. (Cost, I suppose.)  \n\nEnjoy your trip!",

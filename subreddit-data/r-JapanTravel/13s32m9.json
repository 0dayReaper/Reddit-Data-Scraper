Snow-covered leafless trees and frozen earth nature, of course. \n\nThick parka like coats, heavy gloves, mufflers, and snow boots should come with you.",

The whole area is beautiful. Fall is really the best time for that area, but it's nice in the winter as well. You should check for strawberry picking while you are there as well. Strawberries are a winter fruit (grown in green houses) in Japan and a lot of them are grown in Nikko.",

Another nice small town but it's super quiet especially in winter. \n\nAny reason you are skipping Tokyo and basically only staying in Nikko and Aomori? It's an odd itinerary for a noob.",

Nikko is best in fall and Aomori is best as a base for skiing. I've been to those places for those reasons but wouldn't go to Nikko in winter or Aomori just to hang out in snow. Hakkoda is a really cool mountain but best explored on skis. They do snowshoe tours up top but it's usually a blizzard whiteout up top. Make sure you bring very warm clothing for adventures up there it's no joke. \n\nIf winter is and nature is fix you're looking for why not go to Sapporo and hit mountains around there? Sapporo is a great city too and winter-centric.",

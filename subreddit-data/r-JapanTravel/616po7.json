They're somewhat spread out throughout the garden and not really a real indicator of blooming status. Most regular trees are just now starting to bloom, the bigger groves of the garden have some branches sprinkled with blossoms and the odd tree in full bloom, but nowhere near as impressive as it'll be in a few days/a week. [Some pictures of yesterday.](http://imgur.com/a/mj5l0)       \nYoyogi Park and Naka Meguro are both still pretty bare right now, so if you're looking for at least some full bloom trees Shinjuku is the place to be at this weekend. I think starting today they'll check bags on entry, so don't bring any booze for hanami and try one of the secondary entrances to spread out the load if the main one has a big line.",

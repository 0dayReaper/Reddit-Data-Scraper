    "postText": "*TL;DR - As a first-time visitor, I thought visiting Japan under the current conditions was still worth it.*\n\nYes, hello, it is I, one of the [8000 foreign tourists](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220810_02/) Japan\u2019s had since opening for group tours, here to tell you about my trip. Obviously, I am only one person with one experience, one company, and one tour guide, and you may hear things from other folks that don\u2019t line up with my experience.\n\n**The Road To Japan**\n\nMy husband and I started looking at tour options on June 10th under the assumption that some companies might not start booking before then. Due to work constraints, we had a predetermined three-week block we were looking at, and a quick day\u2019s search found only one company that offered a long-ish tour during that timespan. The actual dates for the tour we ended up with were July 24-Aug 3.\n\nAs soon as we paid for the tour, the company started reaching out immediately about next steps. First step was sending them passport copies - this was for ERFS registration. This was done completely on the company\u2019s end. I submitted the passports to them on a Friday and the ERFS certificates were ready on Monday.\n\nThe next step was applying for our visas. This was the most stressful - or at least time-consuming - part of the process. I found two different lists of requirements on the consulate\u2019s website, both of which had at least one item not found on the other. The full list of items we ended up submitting were:\n\n* Passports\n* Visa applications (with photos - we just got standard passport photos from Walgreens)\n* ERFS certificates\n* Flight confirmations for both the arriving and departing flights\n* Bank statement\n* Proof of being tour members (provided by company)\n* Tour itinerary (provided by company)\n* Description of COVID measures the tour was taking (provided by company)\n* Hotel list (provided by company)\n* Guide contact info (provided by company)\n* Authorization form for me only (my husband went to the consulate to apply in-person, so this allowed him to apply on my behalf)\n\nHad we mailed in our applications, we would have needed a mail liability form - which states they are not responsible for items lost in the mail - instead of the authorization form.\n\nHe applied for our visas on Friday, July 1st and was told to return on Monday, July 11th to pick up the passports with visas. These were ready at that time.\n\nCOVID screening was all done via the mySOS app. The app\u2019s screen color indicates progress; after travel information and vaccine records have been reviewed and approved, the red screen turns yellow. After submitting a negative PCR test (within 72 hours of departure of the actual flight that will land in Japan), the screen turns blue.\n\nAlso we were required to buy travel insurance, but the government never checked on that, just the tour company.\n\nProcessing at Haneda Airport was just the COVID/mySOS checkpoint (which everyone entering Japan has to do) and the immigration stuff that was probably always there.\n\n**Actual Experience In The Country**\n\n(We got off to a weird start with a weather-related missed connection that resulted in us getting to Japan a whole 24 hours after we were supposed to. Thankfully, arriving on a day after the one we\u2019d put on all our forms did not set off any alarms, though we did have to get a second set of PCR tests at a layover airport since our original tests were going to expire.)\n\nQuarantine: No, we were NOT required to quarantine on arrival due to coming from a [blue](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border\\_category.html) country. Folks coming from yellow and red countries may still need to.\n\nMasks: Yes, though not precisely enforced? There was one family in our group who were frequent masks-below-the-nosers and no one spoke to them about it. But otherwise everyone was consistent about wearing them properly and even followed residents\u2019 lead on wearing them outside in 100 degree heat.\n\nDisinfection: We were required to use hand sanitizer each time we got back on the tour bus, and everyone used all the sanitizer stations we ran across while out and about.\n\nSupervision: Not really! At the end of the day\u2019s scheduled stops, the guide dropped us at the hotel and just told us when to meet him in the morning, and whatever we wanted to do until then was up to us. We also had a full free day in Tokyo, as well as small amounts of free time at individual tour stops. Which I imagine is how tours have always worked?\n\nExtensions: It does sound like we could have added on a few free days at the end of the tour; most of our group was headed back to Tokyo for a day or two after the end of the official schedule. So ask your tour company, it can\u2019t hurt!\n\nOtherwise our experience was probably the same as any pre-pandemic tour, with two exceptions:\n\nNumber of people: Obviously, we did not run into many other tourists! We saw one or two other obvious groups in Kyoto, but that was about it.\n\nLanguage: You can tell that most businesses (specifically places like restaurants and non-tourist stores) have not had English-speaking customers in a long while. My husband can read quite a bit of Japanese (all three systems), but has only a very basic speaking ability while I have essentially none, so we had a few rough interactions. To be clear, there was plenty of patience on both sides, it just got complicated sometimes.\n\n**Was It Worth It?**\n\nIf I had to do it over again, I would have pushed back the trip a couple months just due to heat, but otherwise, yes, I think the trip was worth it. As a first-time visitor, it was nice to have sort of a sampler of locations; we would have liked more time at several of our stops, but the evenings did allow for that a little bit. Also, we were our tour guide\u2019s first group in two and a half years, and at the end of the tour he cried because he was so happy to be back at his old job. I hope Hide-san continues to get eager visitors to show around!",

Having some free time after the tour schedule is really crucial, I think, as some of my most magical moments each time I've been to Japan have been unintended discoveries while on my way to or from something I'd planned to do. So glad y'all got to go, and that you had a good experience.\n\nThe burning question I have: what were your top 3 highlights of the trip?",

Some parts sound v similar, others a bit different in my experience. \n\nI had a pretty different experience applying for the tourist visa (bank statements?). We submitted way less info. Basically just an application, copy of flights, and our itinerary along with passport and the ERFS. I think that each consulate has its own procedures / requirements.\n\n For our consulate there was no in person application and we received the visa via the mail in 6 days. Very minimal fuss - very straight fwd. \n\nMy wife and I did independent tours. No buses or other people. We would meet our guide at the hotel. Took trains to the sites / areas we wanted to go to. We also came up with our own itinerary. Ie - \"shopping tour of Ginza\". \"Backstreets of harajuku\" etc. \n\nWe also had the benefit of previously spending several months of time in Japan over the years. So for a first timer, this may not be the best route....\n\nWe had every morning and evening free and like OP mentioned we were able to add/ask for some free days in between which is huge because doing a tour every single day can grind on you. I don't think people quite understand this ...you are allowed to be on your own in Japan as a tourist. Some tour companies willl permit this, others will not (because they want to charge you everyday for a guide - somewhat understandable). It's absolutely worth shopping around and finding a company that suites your wishes / needs.\n\nWe booked our own hotels via agoda and stayed in a 4 star hotel by Shibuya station for around $70 a night.\n\nDue to the heat on some days, we asked to modify our tours and shorten them up a bit, which everyone agreed was a good idea (ie walking 6 miles in 102 heat - not the best)\n\nThe only big difference for us compared to the last times we have been to Japan is not being able to take a train to/from airport. That struck me as weird, given we were taking trains everyday during our trip. But maybe the extra $$ goes to help a driver and the tour company - so happy to help \ud83d\ude00 \n\nMy costs for two weeks with my wife were approx $1500 total. Ie $750 a person. That is cost for the tours / guide and private airport transportation. Nothing else. It would have been much less but one of our flights was via Narita and that is not a cheap taxi.",

They confirmed this was permitted under the current guidelines. Of course you can choose to not do something. \n\nThe rep from the tour company further commented that there is \"more understanding\" for the tourists wishes and plans these days.\n\nSeems weird to downvote actual current tourist experiences while currently in Japan vs others pure speculation of what *might* happen (ie. the police !?!?!)\n\nIn my expierence while here it feels like all of the paper work / application process is meant to intimidate potential visitors - but if you are willing to do the work, you could have a relatively easy and *mostly* independent time in the country if you do a bit of work on your own.\n\nIt seems like there are folks in this sub who love to doom post about all the restrictions while never having attempted to go through w/ the application process nor have any first hand experience as a tourist this year \n\nI think everyone forgets that half a million foreigners (on work, family and resident visas) already entered the country from Jan to June 2022. Police are not going to hunt down westerners asking to see their tour intinararies.\n\nEdit : some words",

When we narrowed it down to that small handful - we compared the costs and quotes and picked the one we thought understood our requests the most.\n\nThere were a whole lot of considerations on both sides along the way and that's why I don't want to post \"ohhh, just email company X and you'll be all set\"\n\nSince the posts I have already received 15+ private messages asking for their specific contact info. I don't want to dump a bunch of internet strangers upon them. It's not to keep it all to myself but rather have interested tourist reach out and speak for themselves as each individual tour situation is different.\n\nI didn't have any inside top secret info beforehand. The company we chose ended up being on the top half of the first page of Google results. They are super well established. \n\nHowever, I do think our past history in Japan and super familiarity with the visa process and quarantine procedures made this much easier for us and the agency and that might not be the case for everyone.\n\nFolks need to describe in great detail exactly what you do and do not want to do and make it VERY personal and that needs to be worked out in advance.",

How long did it take you to register all information in the mySOS app and how long before departure did you start?\n\n2. I've heard some chatter about the mySOS app spawning a 14 day countdown timer, causing sweats for folks who start their registration too much in advance. Can you confirm this timer?\n\n3. Did you use the [visit Japan web] (https://www.digital.go.jp/en/services/visit_japan_web-en/) service for immigration/customs at all? I have seen this pop up on the website of my embassy but I have not heard a single soul about it online, so it is making me slightly worried about when to start filling things in.",

Once it expires you have to start all over again. All the docs I uploaded were approved in less than 3 hours. Don't sweat it..wait for your PCR results and then upload everything at once.\n\nThere is no immigration app for tourists. There is however a customs app. You can fill it out day before you leave. Takes about 4 minutes. You get a QR code and you can scan that vs filing out a customs form.\n\nYou still have to goto the customs agent and they ask for passport and can go through your bags etc",

Good to hear there was some free time and a nice bonus of less other foreign tourists.\n\nI still think back to my first trip to Japan back in the 90's and how everything looked so futuristic. Sure Japan might not have the same tech dominance as it once did, but the culture is so unique.",

More so to emphasize to those on the fence that Japan WHV during corona is likely worth it and such programs should be expanded. I was among the first WHV holders to enter during corona so I was super lucky. I spent a year and three months throughout corona living in big cities and exploring nearby branching cities, sometimes the hotels were as cheap as 1000 yen per night. At some points I could find housing in Fukuoka for 30,000 yen per month and spent 20,000 yen for unlimited travel across Northern Kyushuu (4 weeks x 5000) every weekend. \n\nI was being reckless at some times but such travel can be safe with the right precautions and knowledge. Wear N95. Take LEs at non peak hours. Travel the most between 2 weeks and 3 months after your shot and boosters when you are least likely to get infected. \n\nOtherwise, working holiday is a great program and extremely healthy for the both of the host countries. Long term travel is better for the environment and can help tourists and locals alike navigate culture shock. While working on agreements that help both economies look for long term ways to mutually enrich themselves. If your country does not have a working holiday agreement with Japan I encourage you all to write letters to your representatives. Tell them about the tourist limits, highlight how working holidays can benefit both countries and be an environmentally friendly alternative to fast travel and safer during pandemics.",

I have a little experience with tour packages since our school had an international tour pre pandemic and we followed a tour package our agency set out for us. \n\nBut i have heard some conversation whose procedure is somewhat different from mine. They said that you are not allowed to get out of your assigned accommodations. \n\nI know you mentioned that your tour guide dropped you off in your hotel and told that you can just meet them the next day, and what you do the rest of the night was up to you.\n\nbut just to be sure, no one in the hotel/accomodation nor the tour guide barred you from getting out of your hotel/accom to wander around the neighborhood right? Im contemplating if taking the tour packing is worth it. \n\nDont get me wrong, im fine with tour packages, i had already experience it pre pandemic and I know what to expect in the scheduled tour. but what im worried is when you're not allowed to get outside of your accomodation after the scheduled tour of the day to wander around the neighborhood.",

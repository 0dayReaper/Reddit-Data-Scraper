    "postText": "Hi hi, I will travel to Japan on mid to late September and land in NRT, and planning to go straight to Hokkaido via train for sightseeing and culinary trip. \n\nI have some questions and I hope you can give me some perspectives:\n\n\\-Is Hokkaido worth to go in September for 3-4 nights? (considering the journey length from Tokyo).\n\n\\-Should I go straight for Sapporo and make it a base for the whole trip or stay at Hakodate for 1 night? Is there anything interesting to do in Hakodate?\n\n\\-I want to go to Farm Tomita but I understand the Lavender season will be over already, so is Furano worth a daytrip from Sapporo at that time?\n\n\\-Is Yubari Melon still available to buy on September?\n\n\\-Can I hope to see autumn foliage in Daisetsuzan at that time of the year?\n\n\\-Any other tips?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf, in the end, the time is not ideal, I'm thinking of going to Chugoku or Kyushu instead, and reserve Hokkaido for Winter trip in the future. \n\nThank you!!",

Higher up like Daisetzusan September/October probably better.\n\n3-4 days is short. I would recommend flying using the domestic travel fares. Is cheaper, faster, and more convenient if you are already at NRT. \n\nHakodate mountain view is nice. I didnt spend much time there. Depends on what your interests are.",

I would recommend a flight over the train.\n\n3-4 nights will let you do things around Sapporo. But you would probably need more time if you wanted to see other areas (will need to rent a car).\n\nWeather was fairly cold in mid October. I\u2019d expect it to be warmer in September but probably a good idea to have a jacket or some warmer tops.",

It\u2019s cheaper (and way faster) to fly, especially if you\u2019re concerned about time.\n\nThat being said, Hakodate is beautiful, and I would definitely prioritize that over Farm Tomita at that time of year. The view from Mt. Hakodate is one of the best city views in Japan.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re thinking of doing Hakodate, Sapporo, and Daisetsuzan within 4 days\u2026 it\u2019s doable maybe but Hokkaido is absolutely huge and those are in such different areas of Hokkaido.. better to stick to the Sapporo area and check out Otaru, Noboribetsu, and things around Sapporo. \n\nTL;DR Hokkaido is 100% worth a visit but you might want to focus your itinerary a bit more \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

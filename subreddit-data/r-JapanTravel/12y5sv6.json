    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nGolden week is near and although I work that week, I will be off the one after so no much travel should be going on.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been wanting to go to Tsushima just for the experience and yeah because of the video game. Now, my Japanese level takes me to a bar, asks for beers some food and the bill. Could I survive there with a very basic Japanese level?\n\nAlso, how difficult would be to wander around the place by myself without a car? \n\nHas someone gone there that can give me some insight?\n\nElse I will check some tourist information center and see if there is any available information in English. But I wanted to ask here just to see if someone has any experience.\n\nThank you all f",

It's about 70km from tip to tip, so it's a serious slog if you don't have transport organised. I'd suggest at least having a basic itinerary (with transport options) of things/places you want to see - yes, it's nice to go off the beaten track, and if you don't mind finding only more beaten track, then it should be fine. Just don't expect a lot of history other than some ruins - and forget the fields of flowers and long-grasses :-) .  Sorry you didn't get a lot of help, but let us know how it went if you go.",

But people need to go in with open eyes that game devs make crap historians (and that generally is a win-win). Edit - oh, and not only did I platinum Odyssey, I also did GoT. I am very happy to separate gaming from reality. :-) On a similar note - I actually also really got into Ghostwire Tokyo (as I lived not far from Shibuya for 3 years, and whilst this is a cartoon/reality adjacent version, it captured enough feels for me to get into)",

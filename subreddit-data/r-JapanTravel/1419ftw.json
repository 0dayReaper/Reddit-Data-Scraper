    "postText": "As we all know the coming changes to JR Pass will likely make the nationwide pass obsolete for all, but the most cunning (or very niche) visitors - we foresee changes to the way people approach to Japan with increasing focus on staying in the cities, which enable them to make a full use of regional passes, or to take advantage of many day trips.\n\nWe'd like you to share your ideas for using those hubs to the fullest for short-term and medium-term tourism-related stays, including your ideas for itineraries, day trips, eating out, entertainment and just having a general fun all around.\n\nToday we'd like to discuss Sendai, which is the largest city in Tohoku and also a major transport hub with links to the western and northern part of the region. While **Sendai Airport** might be a good way in for people coming from Hokkaido, Kansai or farther afield, **Tohoku shinkansen** is your way in from Tokyo.\n\n|**Info Panel**|**Sendai**|\n|:--|:--|\n| Main transport hub | Sendai (JR, shinkansen, subway, bus terminal) |\n| Airport | Sendai Airport (direct train, buses) |\n| Entertainment district | Ichiban-cho |\n| IC card | Suica (major), icsca (non-major) |\n| Peak season | Early August (Sendai Tanabata Matsuri) | \n| Day trip destinations | Matsushima Bay, Yamadera, Hiraizumi, Geibikei Gorge |\n\nPlease note that all 10 major IC cards are compatible with whole icsca transportation.\n\n*(This post is part of a discussion series set up by the moderators of /r/JapanTravel.

The area around Sendai Stations has many shopping malls and restaurants within walking distance thanks to a huge elevated walkway over most of the streets around the station.\n\nYou can be as far as Hakodate in a little over 3 hours with the right Shinkansen. Tokyo is just 1 hour and 40 minutes away.\n\nIt's a bit of a niche recommendation, but I really enjoyed the [Supernova arcade](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kZyMNKnuF5wg9rTXA) which is about 30 minutes by bus from Sendai Station.",

Then when we\u2019re leaving Nikko, activate the JR East pass and travel to Sendai where we\u2019ll spend three nights. \n\nAs a day trip, the next day we\u2019ll travel to Matsushima, take a boat tour, and then travel down to Shiogama. \n\nOn the following day we\u2019ll travel to Yamadera, I think we\u2019re looking at this small hike: https://en.japantravel.com/yamagata/the-omoshiroyama-yamadera-trail/45322.\n\nWhen we leave Sendai, we\u2019ll travel to Aizu Wakamatsu and stay in our splurge ryokan for the trip: https://www.mukaitaki.com/s/\n\nAnd finally, back to Tokyo - and that covers all 5 days of the pass! I hope it works out as well as we hope it does, and maybe our planned itinerary will help you as well.",

There is also a discount on the Aizu-Shinjuku bus if you buy it a bit in advance, which can be nice if your Tokyo lodgings are on the west side of the city. In fact, Matsushima and Yamadera day trips do not need the JR East pass as they are covered by the much cheaper Sendai Marugoto Pass.\n\nSo if you like, you can get a few more days in Tohoku - just be back in Sendai by day 5 of the pass.",

But I want to put out some ideas for \"pass value maximization\" especially if one would prefer to spend more time in Tohoku:\n\n**Option 1**\n\n* Pass day 1: Nikko - Sendai (or other Tohoku hub such as Morioka, Aomori, etc)\n\n* Pass days 2-5: do non-Sendai stuff. If you prefer to base in Sendai the whole time, this could take the form of long day trips to Kakunodate, Hiraizumi, Naruko Gorge etc depending on personal interests. If you base somewhere else, same idea. (November is not the right season, but one possibility could be to base in Aomori and do Oirase Gorge and Resort Shirakami for instance)\n\n* Return to Sendai by night 5. \n\n* Days 6 and 7: Use the Marugoto Pass for Yamadera and Matsushima\n\n* Days 8+: Bus to Aizu, day trips around local attractions via the Aizu Gurotto Card \n\n* Bus to Shinjuku \n\n**Option 2: similar to above, but taking advantage of the 5500 yen Tohoku domestic flights for foreigners**\n\n* Day 1: Nikko-Aizu (railways not covered by JR Pass but supposedly very scenic in the right season)\n\n* Days 2+: reverse of above itinerary - activate JR East Pass when you are done with Sendai local stuff and want to go onwards. Because you are starting the pass from Fukushima prefecture, you could even consider the 6 day/24k yen Tohoku-South Hokkaido pass (ie the same cost per day as the five day JR East Pass) which lets you see Hakodate as well. \n\nLast day of pass: arrive in Aomori/Akita, spend the next few days doing local stuff \n\nDay X: fly from Aomori/Akita to Haneda airport",

This is new-ish museum opened in 2020. It's also notoriously hard to access, but doable as half or full day trip from Sendai. It's probably easier to do from Iwaki, but I don't think most people will consider Iwaki a hub. From Mito and it's not that much different from Sendai.\n\n**The museum:** You probably want about 2 hour here. I only spent one hour and has to skip to first introductory movie due to time limit. The English is minimal to medium, though, and it focuses mainly on the effect and the recovery effort of the nuclear disaster.\n\n**The access:** The closest train station is the Futaba station on the Joban line. There's [shuttle bus](https://touhoku-access.com/route_futaba.php?) from the station to the museum, but it's not that well connect with the train. All 3 round-trips of the Hitachi Express to/from Sendai stops at Futaba station. But the timing is so bad that you can't take the express both way. There's about one local train every two hour to/from Sendai, and you need to change at Haramonachi station.\n\n**NOTE:** Futaba station is part of SUICA Tokyo Area, while Sendai station is part of SUICA Sendai Area. You cannot use IC Card between Futaba and Sendai. And since Futaba station is unmanned most of the time there won't be staff to help you either.",

I very much do not recommend animal cafes, it'll make you pretty sad for them (maybe some cat cafes are probably fine). \n\nThis advice isn't born of some ethereal ideal of \"animals should be in the wild\". I mean I don't think chaining owls to fake trees trapped in a tiny darkened tokyo-sized apartment is a good time for them. \n\nI've been to one in the past and that's what it was. Multiple times a owl would fall off, and then hanged by it's leg flapping around like crazy until a staff member rescued it and put it back on it's assigned branch that it's chained to. \nThat and a few other small stories about seeing trained animals treated badly for entertainment. \n\nYou'll have a better time with the deer at Nara, at least they get to walk about outside.",

I don't even think a 7 Day Pass makes sense for you. A 14 Day Pass **definitely** does not.\n\nAlso, please give a second thought to Go-Karting, as it's generally thought of a dangerous and fairly asshole-ish tourist activity.",

Kyoto was by far our favourite place. Mixes old and new perfectly and probably our fav foodie place. But we dont eat meat so we just found kyoto to have a large selection for us. \nNara park was pretty boring. Cant take shinkansen. So its a 40ish min train. You see deer eh and theres a muesum full of buddhas. For the limtited time there thats a toughie. The bamboo forest area is nice. We rented a kyak over the bridge and went up the river. Found it so tranquil and amazing its def a top exp. Boat vender pull aside so you can get on it if its your poison and just vibe away. Bamboo forest was also a bit underwhelming. Its not nearly as nice as instagram and swarmed with thousands of people. But its touristy. Its fine. Its part of the exp but dont expect to blow loads over it. The 1000 gate shrine thing in kyoto was cool. Thats a must. We saw the golden temple too. That was okay. Out of the way and your done in 30 mins. We stayed in gion which is good. Theres a temple at the back of an old street. Has a place you can walk throguh and its really nice. The end has a giant roof Muriel of dragons. Def a vibe. Anyway have a good time. If you go themparks dont skimp on the fast pass",

However if you have a lot of luggage, it may be better to take the Shinkansen.",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nWhen you say Mt. Tateyama, are you saying you want to do the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine route or do you mean something else?\n\nI think some people might be missing that part of your trip since going Tokyo to Nagano, Toyama to Tokyo, and a round trip between Tokyo and Kansai, probably does tip you into a 14 day pass being worth it (at least if you order it from a travel agency and get the lower price than from JR direct.)  You're going to be spending 20,000 yen alone doing the Tokyo to Nagano and Toyama back to Tokyo leg.  \n\nI think doing USJ and the aquarium will be quite hard in one day.\n\nUnless you have specific reservations for things, it might make more sense to do: Tokyo to Nagano (go to Alpine route stay overnight) then go to Toyama, then from Toyama got to Kanazawa and from there take the train to Kyoto.  It seems silly to backtrack over two hours from Toyama to Tokyo, when you can go 20 minutes onwards to Kanazawa and still have a 2.5 hour trip to Kyoto.  You could also then save some money by getting the Arch Pass (though you would need to calculate it out, you might be better off without any pass!) for the trip and could then just pay out of pocket for the trip from Osaka back to Tokyo and then have a few days in Tokyo before your last night in Narita.  It also might make it so you can visit USJ on a non-week end, assuming you do not have tickets ahead of time or express passes ahead of time.\n\nIt would definitely save you money and time.\n\nGood luck!",

We unfortunately have booked our accomodations due to the increasing prices as we get closer to our trip so we'd have to do Tokyo &gt; Nagano &gt; stay the night at Mt Tateyama &gt; Toyama &gt; Tokyo. We also had some other considerations and thus, pushed this to the earlier part of the trip. Was hoping to see if there's any other items that we can shift around during our time in the city. But thank you\\~ Any tips for heading up to Mt Tateyama? :)",

I just noticed that you had that in the early part of your itinerary and all the people posting about rail passes seemed to have missed it because they were only talking about trains in the Kansai area of your trip.\n\nI get price increases, but I would still see if the price increases actually negate any savings by being able to use a different rail pass or no pass, at all since you would be spending considerably less on transportation.\n\n(Tokyo to Nagano, Toyama to Kyoto, Osaka to Tokyo and your Narita roundtrip.)  The Alpine Route itself is not covered by any JR Pass since it's not on JR.  It would also give you the chance to visit Kanazawa, on your way to Kyoto.",

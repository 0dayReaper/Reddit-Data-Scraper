    "postText": "## What Are Goshuin?\n\nHi, welcome! _Goshuin_ are temple and shrine stamps that are written in special books called _goshuincho_. Many people collect them, as they are proof that you visited a temple/shrine, and they also make a unique and beautiful souvenir of a trip. If you want to know more about what a goshuin is or how to start collecting them, check out my previous guide on [receiving and collecting goshuin](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/6wyt0z/guide_temple_and_shrine_stamps_aka_what_are/). In terms of the basics, that\u2019s still relevant and up-to-date information. I also followed that guide up with some information about [finding unique and interesting goshuin](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/eu1v35/looking_for_interesting_and_unique_goshuin_and/). Again, the information in that guide is relevant even a few years later (although special goshuin constantly change, so you probably won\u2019t see the ones pictured in my post).\n\nFor this post, I wanted to make some short, post-reopening comments on collecting goshuin, primarily concerning minor changes I\u2019ve noticed. I\u2019ve returned to Japan twice since the country reopened in October 2022, and I received goshuin on each trip (about 40 or so of them between the two trips).\n\n## Goshuin and Goshuincho Cost\n\nBefore the pandemic, most goshuin cost 300 yen. There were some that were a bit cheaper, and some that were a bit more expensive (especially from famous temples/shrines or if they were limited-edition versions). These days, I\u2019ve noticed the cost for many more of them has gone up to 500 yen. You\u2019ll still see a decent number of places charging 300 yen, but you\u2019ll see a lot more charging 500 yen than before. And for special goshuin (limited edition, holidays, unique paper, etc.), they can be as much as 1000 yen each. \n\nSimilarly, goshuincho seem to have suffered some cost increases. I used to see books for as little as 800 yen, and the top end tended to be 2000 yen (special editions, more unique art on them, wooden, etc.). But these days, it\u2019s not uncommon for the base price to be 1500 yen and the top end to be as much as 3000 yen (or more).\n\n## Written into a Book vs. Separate Papers for Goshuin\n\nAs you probably know, goshuin can come in two forms: written directly into your book by temple/shrine staff, or as a separate piece of paper that you buy and need to paste into your goshuincho later. This separate goshuin page is called kakioki (\u66f8\u304d\u7f6e\u304d), and you might hear staff tell you that's the only version they have and ask if it's all right.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I didn\u2019t find myself receiving a lot of goshuin as separate papers. It happened more often for limited edition ones, but for \u201cregular\u201d goshuin, they would usually write it into my book. I\u2019d say that maybe 1 in 20 of my pre-pandemic goshuin were separate sheets of paper. In the past six months, it seems more like 50% of them are pre-written sheets of paper meant to be pasted in later.\n\nSo if you find yourself encountering this more often, it\u2019s not unusual. Luckily, pretty much any medium-sized convenience store stocks glue sticks, so it\u2019s cheap and easy enough to paste the goshuin in as you go!\n\n## Shrine and Temple Hours\n\nThis is a very minor thing, and it might go away as the country opens up more and more, but I did notice that some hours for temples/shrines seemed reduced. It used to be that pretty much any temple/shrine that wasn\u2019t super, _super_ tiny would have someone staffing the sales window between 8am and 4pm.\n\nOn my trips in the last six months, I noticed a lot more temples/shrines closed on certain days, closed over lunchtime, or seemingly closed at random. This likely wouldn\u2019t be the case for any of the really major tourist destinations, but if you\u2019re walking through a neighborhood with a medium-sized or smaller shrine/temple, you might find yourself unable to receive a goshuin from it.\n\n## Himekat, show us your goshuincho!\n\nWell, since you asked. (:  On my last trip, my husband and I used [these two wooden ones](https://imgur.com/VkFkerp) from Loft (you can get them on the stationery floor), as well as [these two beauties](https://imgur.com/jsQ5VX5) from [Kumano Nachi Taisha](https://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/kumano-kodo/world-heritage/kumano-nachi-taisha/), which we visited on [our trip through Wakayama](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/126tnzh/trip_report_wakayama_city_shingu_nachi_falls/).\n\n**Edit:** I also wanted to add a thank you to all the people who've sent me PMs about my guides or have thanked me for them over the years. I tend to get at least one a month from someone who started or is about to start collecting goshuin, and I'm glad my guides are helpful! It's really heartwarming to see how happy it makes travelers.

There were multiple goshuin to choose from at the shrine, but they did not advertise this one. The only way to get it was to buy the Hello Kitty goshuin-cho, and pay extra for the one that had that particular goshuin already written inside (it's not a loose page glued in, it was just done in the book in advance). You could also buy the blank books, but obviously I wanted one with the Hello Kitty goshuin already inside. The price difference between the two was the same as the price of a regular goshuin. \n\nAnyway, I got some other cool goshuin on my trip but this one is for sure my favorite! Definitely the most unique and it feels extra special because it was kind of a \"secret\".",

It made us appreciate the temples more, talk to temple staff more, and visit more temples to find more goshuin. It gave us new ways to learn about the temples/shrines because we\u2019d want to know what/whom the goshuin were dedicated to. The goshuin book is also probably the memento we will cherish the most because it\u2019s like a scrapbook of all the temples/shrines we saw in the order that we saw them. It became such a joy passing by a temple/shrine and poking in to see if they had goshuin. One of my favorites was the sort of out-of-the-way shrine in Osaka where the man was absolutely delighted two foreigners had come in to ask for goshuin. What an amazing experience it was.",

If neither of those things exist and the book is the exact same on both sides, you can open it from either direction. Or if one side is highly decorative compared to a plainer side, the decorated side is usually the front.\n\nFrom there, you open it and use it right-to-left, although no goshuin go on the cover pages themselves. I made a [short video to demonstrate](https://imgur.com/a/iifAqIp) using one of my own books from Loft. Forgive my poor opening of the book where I didn't unfold it all the way, but you'll see that I opened it from right to left, there's a first blank page (the cover page, which isn't actually a page), and then there are goshuin in order from right to left. \n\nI'm not sure if Meiji will hand you a loose-leaf goshuin or write it in. If they write it in, the staff who writes the goshuin for you will also know where to start it if you hand them a blank book.",

Ones like the the [Seven Lucky Gods Pilgrimage in Tokyo](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/tokyo/temples-shrines/shichifukujin-meguri-the-7-lucky-gods-pilgrimage-in-tokyo) or the [Tokyo Jissha](https://blog.japanwondertravel.com/tokyo-ten-shrines-5726) are short and can be done in a day or other the course of a few days as you explore the city. Longer ones like the [Shikoku Pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage) and [Chichibu 34 Kannon Pilgrimage](https://en.chocotabi-saitama.jp/magazine/48) are a more dedicated process, but can be done in parts. There are already enough variations that I wouldn't make my own. I just encourage people to get goshuin as they visit temples and shrines.",

Although we ended up getting another at Eko-in, and that one wasn't on the map. I think we got 6 total on Koyasan, plus they have those cool cedar books there",

Photos of man hole covers\n\nAt least the other 2 are free! Haha all joking aside, looking for pretty goshuin books at temples have been so much fun",

            "comment": "I want to start collecting goshuins on my next trip in october and was wondering if someone can answer some of my guestions which popped up while researching. \n\nI have social anxiety so asking for these in a different language will be a challenge in itself but I hope some answer will help ease my fear a bit, since I really want these as a memento for my trip.\n\n1. I\u2019ve read quite a lot that it\u2018s rude to ask for a goshuin as soon as you enter temple grounds and should pray before you get one. As goshuins become more and more popular even among tourists is this something still considered rude?\n\n2. Is collecting goshuin in general something someone can do with absolute basic japanese (thank you &amp; goodbye)?\n\n3. How do I know if they only offer loose goshuins? I don\u2018t want to stand there confused when they\u2018re trying to tell me in japanese that they don\u2018t offer a written one in my goshuincho.\n\n4. So how do you go about storing the loose goshuins when you\u2018re on the go? And is there some etiquette when recieving these? (e.g don\u2018t stash them immediatly into your bag or smth?)",

                    "comment": "1. To follow the religious traditions as closely as possible, you should always pray before receiving a goshuin. Does everyone do that, practically speaking? Probably not. And at large or even medium-sized temples and shrines, no one will notice either way. But it _is_ the proper thing to do, as receiving goshuin is part of a religious pilgrimage. Some places will even ask you if you\u2019ve prayed before they give you a goshuin, or they will indicate that you should pray while they write it (since sometimes they take your book into the back in order to do it).\n\n2. I\u2019d say you can definitely collect goshuin in a lot of places with basic or minimal Japanese. At small shrines/temples or out in the countryside, it might be harder, primarily because where and when to get the goshuin might not always be obvious without being able to read. If a human sees you with a goshuincho, they are generally helpful and direct you. But if you show up to a mountaintop shrine, and there\u2019s only a scrawled handwritten note present, it may be harder to figure out what to do. (That\u2019s a true example\u2014we once hiked to the top of a hill only to read the note in Japanese that referred us to a nearby shrine at the bottom that did the goshuin for that place in addition to their own.) But in cities and touristy areas, it\u2019s easy enough to collect goshuin, and staff are pleasant to interact with and will pantomime anything they can\u2019t convey directly.\n\n3. You might not know until you go to buy one. There are sometimes signs (often in Japanese), but sometimes they simply ask you at the window if a loose goshuin is okay. If you don\u2019t speak Japanese, they will usually hold one up in demonstration.\n\n4. There\u2019s no real etiquette, except to store it where it won\u2019t get bent or destroyed. They usually come in a protective bag. I tend to put mine in my goshuincho for safe keeping, or if I have a sturdy shopping bag or other notebook with me, I might put it in there. Anywhere it\u2019s safe, really.",

You go from \"I'm scared, how do I do this??\" to \"fine, I'll ring this tiny little doorbell on the side of what looks like a person's house in order to get my goshuin\" pretty quickly! I would recommend getting your first couple at bigger shrines/temples (places like Senso-ji and Meiji-jingu), then it will feel easier.",

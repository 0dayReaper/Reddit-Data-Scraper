            "comment": "That is a huge number of days to spend in Tokyo, I would consider spending more time in Kyoto/wider Kansai or in Hokkaido (which is huge, not so easy to get to, and much more than Sapporo) or a different region of Japan if you decide to can Hokkaido.\n\n&gt; better days of the week to go to Hakone or Nikko\n\nNot weekends. In the case of Hakone, see if you are lucky and there is a clear day where you can see Mt Fuji (it will be covered in clouds for most of August).",

            "comment": "Hakone - the best time to go is when you have clear skies so you can have nice views of Fuji\n\nShibuya crossing - Maybe overrated but its right at the station and Shibuya is worth checking out in the arvo/night so you might as well watch it for a few minutes\n\nFushimi Inari - It doesn't close so you can go anytime but the general advice is to go early morning (7am) to avoid the crowds. Also in summer it will be hot, so early is more tolerable. I would go on 17/8 prior to Arashiyama.\n\nFlight to Sapporo - you will just check your luggage in or carry on. Some budget airlines might require you to pay for check in luggage.\n\nOverall you could take 1 day off Hiroshima and 1 or 2 off Tokyo and see another town/city if one interests you.",

Perhaps you'd go to the must-visit places in Tokyo - the Sensoji Temple, Meiji Jingu, the beautiful Jiyugaoka, and more ideas here [https://gowithguide.com/japan/tokyo](https://gowithguide.com/japan/tokyo). Hope you enjoy your travel!",

            "comment": "A few recommendations based my my experience and some others I know of:\n\nWhile you\u2019re in Tokyo, take a day trip to enoshima/shichirigahama. It\u2019s pretty out of the way but popular among Japanese local tourists. You get a nice view of the beach and Mount Fuji if it\u2019s clear out. You can also check out Yokohama\u2019s Chinatown and Kamakura while you\u2019re in the area.\n\nFor Tokyo, I\u2019d recommend asakusa which has a major shrine called Senso-Ji, as well as the sky tree, which was better than shibuya sky in my opinion\n\nFor shibuya sky, make sure there isn\u2019t a single drop of rain, because it will be cloudy and they close the roof deck at the sight of any rain at all.\n\nI didn\u2019t go, but my parents said the Kyoto bamboo forest was eh and the romantic railway was a complete waste of time. I listened to their suggestion and didn\u2019t go, so I can\u2019t give you my opinion, but that\u2019s what they told me.\n\nWhile you\u2019re in Osaka, check out nipponbashi. It\u2019s honestly just a more practical version of Akihabara in my opinion. Less crowded, more cool stores. There\u2019s a cool little street where all the vendors sell to kitchens and restaraunts, so you can get some cool cookware and stuff like that.\n \nAfter you get off the pirate sightseeing ship in hakone, maybe walk to kuzuryu shrine. It\u2019s pretty charming and had the best ema (little wood thing you write wishes on at shrines) I found while in Japan.\n\nFor Kyoto, fushimi inari is nice but make sure to stay on the trail, I saw a sign that said nature trail and was like oh cool a little offshoot and then ended up getting lost for around an hour.\n\nFor one of the days you\u2019re in Hiroshima, take a day trip to Fukuoka. I\u2019m assuming you have the JR pass, so it\u2019s about an hour out on the Shinkansen. Make sure to go relatively early. I thought it was one of the best places I went in Japan all together. Tenjin was a nice city-like area, and Oohori park was awesome. Fukuoka in general felt like Japan if it were more like the US.\n\nI never went to hokkaido, but I have a strong feeling 4 days is too long. I may be wrong though, as there\u2019s Hakodate and Sapporo, but still. May as well check out Sendai with one of those days. If your girlfriend loves katsu, check out \u3068\u3093\u304b\u3064\u3064\u304f\u3057 (tonkatsu tsukushi) in Sendai. Easily the best tonkatsu I had in Japan, and satou-san who runs it is probably the kindest man I met while there. Only other things to do in the immediate Sendai area are the castle ruins (more of just a view, which was nice), and taking day trips out to nature attractions an hour out. If you\u2019re thinking about the cat island, the entire town surrounding it closes at like 1PM, so you basically have to get there before 10 to make the ferry. \n\nGood luck and happy travels",

            "comment": "Try to go to Hakone when it's clear out for those gorgeous views and I would try to avoid 11/12/13 for Hakone (Aka Friday, saturday, sunday). It's a holiday and long weekend for Japan these days. You might see more foot traffic than usual + some places might be closed, etc. \n\n14 days in Tokyo might be excessive, but I'm sure you could find stuff to do. My first time ever going to Japan with friends, we spent 12 days in Tokyo and were able to do a lot of stuff, and still had places we wanted to see. We also didn't do day trips to farther away places.",

            "comment": "Definitely spend the night in Kyoto. It is a beautiful place. I have been there twice (7 days total), and I would go back in a heartbeat. Definitely get some temple food, tonkatsu, and kaiseki food. The best tonkatsu and tofu I've ever had was in Kyoto.\nI didn't like Osaka at all, but maybe we didn't do the right things. We don't have any interest in amusement parks or rides.\n\nI am going to Hokkaido very soon, so I hope it is worth it!\n\nTokyo is an amazing city. Endless things to do.  I just visited for the 3rd time, and it is still overwhelming (in a good way). I've had a ton of great food in Tokyo. Teki is an amazing Yakitori place in Ginza. The chicken is a rare breed that tastes nothing like chicken elsewhere. Make reservations for dinners if you can.\n\nAlso, definitely make sure you are in top physical shape before your trip. It will make a huge difference in your enjoyment.",

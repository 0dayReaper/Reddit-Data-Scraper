    "postText": "I thought I would share this experience since I've heard over and over how expensive Japanese healthcare is for foreigners. Long story short: my wife has a long-standing condition that can cause brain swelling and then seizures. If it happens, she need to be tested with steroids to reduce the swelling. Since this is a preexisting condition, it would not be covered by travel insurance.\n\nWell, she had a small seizure in Hiroshima so we went to the ER. I think we were there for about two hours, but neurology would not prescribe steroids for her since her seizure was over before we arrived. We declined labs or imaging. The total cost to is for the evaluation was 5900 yen, or about $45.\n\nIt was frustrating not getting the care she needed, and we've increased her standing dose of antiseizure meds until we get home, but it was much cheaper than I expected.",

Before I moved to Japan, I was visiting and needed an x-ray, total cost was something like 4000 yen.  I could not even visit a doctor in the US for less than that, let alone get an x-ray.  And all that was with zero insurance in Japan.",

Had a docter in the US offer to fuse my ankle bone together without a diagnosis. Turned out to be a bad sprain and not require surgery. Capitalism may make it seem like the medical is the best in the world so they justify the price but man, Japan was eye opening and some of the longest and healthiest older people in the world.\n\nThe kinda annoying part is that everyone in Japan will complain how expensive going to the docter will be, like the 600 dollars, im immeasurably happy snd they kept apologizing for the high price.",

I was passing a kidney stone one time and had no pain meds, muscle relaxers or anything.  We had my husbands TENS device with us and I was in so much pain I put 4 of the larger pads on my back and cranked it up super high.  It masked the pain pretty well.  The TENS feels like shocks, but compared to the waves of intense won't quit pain it was very bearable.   I have actually used the TENS device again on another occasion at the ER when I was passing a stone and didn't have meds and had to wait a few hours to be seen.   I know you can't take oxy/hydrocodone into Japan so maybe having something like the TENS machine on hand might help in case you have to pass a stone in Japan.   You could always see if it's something that possibly could work for you next time you have a stone.",

If you don't live in Japan, there's no way to track you down for non-payment. \n\nAnd, anyway, you only had an exam. That's going to be \"cheap\" without Japanese insurance. (Exams for those with Japanese insurance are 30% of what you paid.) For example, the pre-insurance price for the monthly medications my husband and I get is around \uffe550,000 \u2014 and that's for basic meds. So, if you aren't a resident with Japanese health insurance, you'd have to pay that full price OOP. \n\nBut think about it logically: The more services you require, the more expensive the care will get. If you had an emergency and needed surgery or something more serious? I could easily see a non-resident racking up a \uffe51 mil bill. (Pre-insurance price for my husband's wrist surgery was something like \uffe5850,000 \u2014 and that wasn't an emergency situation.)",

You MUST arrive to a hospital via ambulance. The 14 sutures and knee x-ray only cost 85,000 Yen. \n\nMoral of the story: if you are injured in Japan you MUST call the ambulance, they is no other way to ensure treatment.

My symptoms were the common cold and fever, but they did a x-ray and swabbed me in fear of pneumonia or other unknown viruses. Collected the usual medications and my bill came up to 30,000+ YEN. Absolutely shocking but luckily I was able to claim for insurance.",

Their bill was only 5900yen for a visit to a neurology specialist, when I only visited the general doctor in the ER. \n\nFrom where I\u2019m at, visits to my local A&amp;E would only cost 1/3 of my 30,000 yen bill.",

Just to put it in perspective, my two-day hospital stay was less than half the price of what it cost a Japanese Intl-student in WA State for a bottle of Tylenol at the ER after he was hit by a baseball. I don't get it.",

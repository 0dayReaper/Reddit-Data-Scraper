I've never looked back!! I love how fresh it makes you feel and I couldn't imagine life without it now. Not to mention, the seat warmers are a godsend in the winter and I adore the water sounds when using public toilets as I have anxiety and would avoid public restrooms at all costs in the US. But now I feel just as comfortable using a public one as I do the one at home, as long as it's clean and not a Japanese style one! \n\nPoint is, America does bathrooms entirely wrong. I don't know what's wrong with them, but they should really do something about that. Luckily for me, I'll be staying in Japan for the foreseeable future. Hopefully forever. But if I ever did have to leave, toilets and public bathrooms in general will be what I miss quite possibly the most.  With the small exception for the fact that they often don't have soap or paper towels. (Come on Japan, really? Why are you like this...)",

I'll never forget sitting down for the first time totally expecting a cold, cold seat on a breezy December night, only to get a warm and cozy throne. Loved it",

I came in the summer and thought it was strange that it always seemed like someone had sat on the seat before me for so long, even if no one had seemingly been around. I didn't figure out it was heated seats until winter. Most pleasant surprise as well as realization that in fact, people had not been reading newspapers on toilets all the time, occupying the seat for 20 minutes or more before me. ",

    "postText": "**Tags: Advice &amp; Recommendations**\n\nI am truly grateful for any help that anyone can offer me on this one.\n\nIt brings me immense joy to share that I have finally made the decision to book a trip to Japan. Ever since my childhood, it has been my biggest dream and a personal mission of mine to visit that beautiful country.\n\nIt fills me with immense excitement to say that I have finally taken the plunge. Life is short, and I have recently realized the importance of pushing myself out of my comfort zone and exploring the world around me. There are countless reasons why I am thrilled to embark on this journey, but I want to convey to anyone reading this that this trip to Japan is the realization of a lifelong dream, and it means the world to me that it is finally happening. I am dyslexic as well, and I find planning all of this a bit overwhelming. Please accept my apologies in advance. I would greatly appreciate the best guidance you can provide.\n\nAppreciate if you save this post and help me as I edit and update this\n\n**Let\u2019s get into it:**\n\n**Budget:** There is no real limit, but I want to get the best value for my money while being mindful. I am looking to spend more money on experiences, creating memories, and enjoying moments.\n\n**Arrival**: I arrive in Tokyo at Haneda airport at 22:30 on the 1st of **December**\n\n**Departure:** Sunday, 24 Dec 2023 00:05\n\n**Bag:** The Tropicfeel Shelter 30L backpack extends to 66L and including a personal bag that will be packed into the backpack. Another option is to buy luggage to check in when returning or to post items back.\n\n**Clothing:** TBC\n\n**Jackets:** **Heat:** (Thrudark) Centurion Alpine Jacket **+ Rain:** (Thrudark) SF Raid Jacket\n\n**Walking:** ~~Dr Martens~~ Trainers. Any recommendations?\n\n**Suica Card:** Order and to be delivered to me.\n\n**Sim Card:** 31 days Unlimited data Mobai (no calls or text)\n\n**Solo travelling**\n\n**Government website to upload my details:** [https://www.digital.go.jp/en/services/visit\\_japan\\_web-en/](https://www.digital.go.jp/en/services/visit_japan_web-en/)\n\n[https://highway-buses.jp/](https://highway-buses.jp/) \\- **Highway buses. Useful**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Questions:**\n\n**Q1)** I find planning a 3-week itinerary for my trip very overwhelming, but I have been scouring the internet and have come up with a rough draft. However, I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide in modifying it to make the best possible use of my time in Japan. I consider myself a bit of a nerd and am passionate about technology, gaming, and Japanese history, particularly the life of Miyamoto Musashi and the samurai. I mention this to give you an idea of my interests and help guide our decisions in crafting this.\n\nAs I move along this year, I will be editing and updating this post to tailor my itinerary with your invaluable assistance (please)?\n\n**Q2)** The price of the JR Rail Pass is going up significantly, which is a little worrying. The plan was to spend money on a 2-week pass and use the remaining time to explore Tokyo with day trips. Is this worth getting for what I am planning?  - **Pending update until October when the prices go up**\n\n**Q3) Need to be at the airport before 8pm. Will I make it to Tokyo from Hiroshima on time on the 23rd before my flight on the 24th December at 00:05? It says nearly 4 hours to go from Hiroshima to Tokyo. Considering morning train**\n\n**Q4) Have you considered using GetYourGuide to book day trips? I'm wondering whether it's worth booking a day trip through an app like GetYourGuide or Klook to visit Mount Fuji, for example, or if it's better to just take transportation by train or bus to Kawaguchiko Station instead?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where I have booked:**\n\n**Tokyo:** Hostel - UnPLAN Shinjuku\n\n**Kyoto:** Hotel - SMile Hotel Kyoto Shijo\n\n**Osaka:** Capsule Hotel - Cabin &amp; Capsule Hotel - J-SHIP\n\n**Okayama:** Hotel - ARK Hotel\n\n**Hiroshima:** Hotel - Hotel Granvia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sanity Check for booking accommodation**:\n\nTokyo: ====================&gt; 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 December\n\nKyoto:  ====================&gt; 9, 10, 11, 12,, 13, 14 December\n\nOsaka:  ====================&gt; 14, 15, 16, 17, ,18,, 19, 20, December\n\nOkayama: ====================&gt; 20, 21, December\n\nHiroshima: ====================&gt; 21, 22, 23rd, December\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The main things I would like to see are list the things you want to see:**\n\n\u00b7 Pokemon Center Tokyo DX\n\n\u00b7 Pokemon Caf\u00e9\n\n\u00b7 Maruzen Bookstore\n\n\u00b7 Samurai Museum\n\n\u00b7 Final Fantasy Cafe\n\n\u00b7 The Tokyo Anime centre\n\n\u00b7 Universal Studios Japan\n\n\u00b7 Ghibli Museum\n\n\u00b7 Tokyo DisneyLand\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3 Week rough itinerary \u2013 To Be changed with help:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tokyo (5 days + 3 for day trips)**\n\n**Day 1 in Tokyo \u2013 Shibuya and Harajuku - 2nd December**\n\n\u00b7 Shibuya crossing\n\n\u00b7 Shopping in Harajuku\n\n\u00b7 Purikura\n\n\u00b7 TBC \u2013 Help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2 in Tokyo \u2013 Ikebukuro and Meiji Shrine -  3rd December**\n\n\u00b7 Shopping in Ikebukuro:\n\n\u00b7 Tokyo Pokemon Mega Store:\n\n\u00b7 Meiji shrine\n\n\u00b7 TBC \u2013 Help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3 in Tokyo \u2013 Asakusa and Akihabara  - 4th December**\n\n\u00b7 Sensoji\n\n\u00b7 Akihabara\n\n\u00b7 TBC \u2013 Help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4 in Tokyo \u2013 Koto City  - 5th December**\n\n\u00b7 Teamlab Planets and Teamlab Borderless.\n\n\u00b7 Gundam base\n\n\u00b7 TBC \u2013 Help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5 in Tokyo \u2013 Tokyo Tower and Roppongi  - 6th December**\n\n\u00b7 Zojoji Temple\n\n\u00b7 Tokyo Tower\n\n\u00b7 Mori Art Museum\n\n\u00b7 Nogi Shrine\n\n\u00b7 Tokyo City View\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6 \u2013 Nikko (Day trip from Tokyo)  - 7th December**\n\n\u00b7 Shinkyo Bridge\n\n\u00b7 Rinnoji Temple\n\n\u00b7 Toshogu Temple\n\n\u00b7 Kegon Falls\n\n\u00b7 Ryuzu Falls\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 7 \u2013 Hakone (Day trip from Tokyo)  - 8th December**\n\n\u00b7 Hakone Shrine\n\n\u00b7 Hakone Open-Air Museum\n\n\u00b7 Owakudani (Boiling Valley)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 8\u2013 Mt Fuji** **(Day trip from Tokyo)  - 9th December**\n\n\u00b7 Chureito Pagoda\n\n\u00b7 North shore of Lake Kawaguchiko\n\n\u00b7 Oshino Hakkai village\n\n\u00b7 panoramic ropeway,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9-13:** **Kyoto  - 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th - December**\n\n\u00b7 Fushimi Inari Taisha\n\n\u00b7 Higashiyama and Gion\n\n\u00b7 Kinkaku-ji\n\n\u00b7 Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\n\n\u00b7 Arashiyama Iwatayama Monkey Park\n\n\u00b7 Kyoto Tower\n\n\u00b7 Kiyomizudera\n\n\u00b7 [Kyoto Samurai and Ninja Museum Experience](https://mai-ko.com/samurai/?fbclid=IwAR3BM0DjiEjzxeq4gMJVUtBzJP9U78ex20QN_7C_0SanSfZmQqzL7XPPZbs)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 14-16: Osaka - 15th, 16th, 17th December**\n\n\u00b7 Umeda Sky Building\n\n\u00b7 Osaka Castle\n\n\u00b7 Shitennoji Temple\n\n\u00b7 Shinsekai\n\n\u00b7 Kuromon Market\n\n\u00b7 Minami/Dotonbori\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 17: Nara \u2013 (Day trip from Osaka - staying in Osaka) - 18th December**\n\n\u00b7 K\u014dfuku-ji temple\n\n\u00b7 Isuien Garden\n\n\u00b7 Todai-ji\n\n\u00b7 Kasuga-Taisha\n\n\u00b7 Nara Deer Park\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 18 Kobe \u2013 (Day trip from Osaka - staying in Osaka) - 19th December**\n\n\u00b7 Ropeway up Mount Rokko\n\n\u00b7 Soraku-en Garden\n\n\u00b7 Kobe Port Tower\n\n\u00b7 Nada Sake Museum\n\n\u00b7 Try Kobe Beef: I do a carnivore diet\n\n\u00b7 Kobe Luminarie\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 19:**  **Okayama - 20th December**\n\n\u00b7 **Himeji Castle**\n\n**Day 16:**  **Okayama**\n\n\u00b7 Okayama Castle.\n\n\u00b7 Korakuen Gardens.\n\n\u00b7 Kurashiki - Explore\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 20: Hiroshima - 21th December**\n\n\u00b7 Atomic Bomb Dome\n\n\u00b7 Peace Park\n\n\u00b7 Shukkei-en Garden\n\n\u00b7 Hiroshima Castle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 21: Miyajima Island ( Day trip from Hiroshima - staying in Hiroshima)**\n\n\u00b7 Giant Torii.\n\n\u00b7 Itsukushima Shrine.\n\n\u00b7 Five-storied pagoda.\n\n\u00b7 Daisho-in Temple.\n\n\u00b7 The Ropeway.\n\n\u00b7 Travel back to Tokyo?\n\n\u00b7 [https://www.aqua-net-h.co.jp/en/heritage/?fbclid=IwAR17A-Tbe3qMkWAjBF7kfM9fBBjodZdETmWc-aRoM3MakD\\_8JYnLppJKpbE](https://www.aqua-net-h.co.jp/en/heritage/?fbclid=IwAR17A-Tbe3qMkWAjBF7kfM9fBBjodZdETmWc-aRoM3MakD_8JYnLppJKpbE)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 22: Tokyo?

I haven't had a chance to look through your itinerary, but I noticed you brought up the Tokyo Klook pass, so I just wanted to do some quick calculations based off of a few things I'm planning on doing for my trip in August.\n\nI'll be doing Shibuya Sky, Skytree, Tokyo Tower, and Disneysea. In yen, that comes out to about \u00a518900 which is about $138. Adding those in on Klook gave me $128. So it saves $10 for me. I don't know what you'll be doing, but personally, I prefer the freedom of deciding in the moment instead of locking in with the klook pass and feeling obligated to do something. If it saved me more, I might feel different.",

I can say that I've made some major changes through out the planning process, so I'd recommend not even worrying about paying for anything attraction related until maybe a month or two in advanced for reservations.",

Put it on your apple wallet if you have an iPhone, otherwise buy one at the airport.\n\nWith the price increases on the jr pass the 14 day pass would probably be more expensive than buying the individual tickets.  The 5 day JR west Kansai- Hiroshima pass activated on day 15 would save you money though. https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/kansai_hiroshima/ \n\nFor the Shinkansen tickets you need to buy individually, if you want to buy them in advance use the SmartEx app/website, which is the official JR Central ticket site. Don\u2019t buy them from any reseller like klook\n\nI used booking.com to make most of my hotel reservations when I went in February. Had no issues and it was nice to have all my reservations info in one place. They have listings for hotels and hostels. Try to look for refundable reservations only in case your plans change.",

            "comment": "Hello, I\u2019m Japanese. I have some suggestions.\n\n1. You wouldn\u2019t need thick winter jackets. Japan usually gets really cold in January and February. Additionally, the inside of buildings are kept quite warm there. You may feel too warm if your jackets are thick.\n\n2. Wear sneakers, or at least, take a pair with you. In Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, you will be walking insane. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Dr. Martens\u2019 boots, but if they are one of your most comfortable pairs of shoes, it will be fine.\n\n3. Look into Airbnb. They are much cheaper and sometimes more convenient by having a washer, microwave and kitchen in the room. Avoid booking a place near the highway and railway. It can be noisy. I always use Airbnb when I visit Osaka, and I\u2019ve never had a negative experience.\n\n4. Check out [Kobe Luminarie](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1040/). You don\u2019t want to miss it when visiting the city in December.\n\n5. I\u2019m from Okayama, and I would get rid of Kibiji cycling if I were you. Instead, I would put Kurashiki. It may be even a good idea to spend a whole day in Kurashiki because you will have seen one of the most beautiful castles in Himeji before visiting Okayama. The Korakuen Garden is beautiful, but I feel like exploring Kurashiki could be more fun and meaningful to you.",

Knowing that, you would want to decide whether or not you spend another day in Hiroshima and Miyajima after your Tokyo portion has been done. I would do that if I were you. If you feel like you would need more time in Tokyo when leaving the city, you can go ahead and shorten your Hiroshima stay. Because you have 2 weeks between your Tokyo and Hiroshima portion, you can make a change with no problems.",

There are some places I want to visit in the city, but the thing is that I don\u2019t plan much ahead of time. This is because I know Osaka and Kyoto well; therefore, it\u2019s totally manageable for me to plan stuff in a last minute. Will let you know. ;-)",

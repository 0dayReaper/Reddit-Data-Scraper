    "postText": "Firstly, this sub has been super helpful for our planning. Huge thank you to you all!\n\nSome background: we are a group of 5. One of us has lived in Japan for 1 year. He is a fluent Japanese speaker. However, since he is vegetarian, we will often be eating separately as many restuarants in Japan unfortunately don't offer Japanese options. Besides him, two have been to Japan for fourism 2-3 times. Two are completely new. Any advice or tips on how to travel in groups and how to handle the different dietary requirements situation would be appreciated.\n\n**Itinerary**\n\n24/05/2023 Tokyo\n\n* Arrive at Narita Airport at 1:05 pm.\n* Arrive at Accommodation in Sumida City via Skyliner \n* Have dinner near Hikifune station\n* See Sky tree in the evening\n\n25/05/2023 Tokyo\n\n* (Half of the party arrives in the evening, so we want to go to a less \u2018must-go\u2019 area)\n* Visit museums around Ryogoku \n* Visit some coffee shops or restaurants around Kuramae across the river, including the famous Pelican Cafe\n* Maybe visit Kiyosumi Shirakawa if we have time\n* Meet up with people arriving today near Hoppi street (within walking distance to accommodation) for dinner at an Izakaya.

All of accommodation have already been booked. However, they are almost all cancellable. So if drastic changes are suggested, we are willing to consider them. The Kyoto period is flexible as well, if other day trips, such as Osaka, is suggested, we will appreciate it. The reason we are not visiting Osaka is because the friend who has lived in Japan for a year is not a fan of the city. But I suspect it could be a mistake since he doesn't eat most Japanese food and Osaka is known for food. But if we were to visit Osaka, I am not sure what replace it with. Please let me know if skipping Osaka is a mistake.",

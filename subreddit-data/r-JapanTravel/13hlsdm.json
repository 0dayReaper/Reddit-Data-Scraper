    "postText": "Putting together a somewhat spontaneous Tokyo/Kyoto trip May 23 - June 5 and I'm trying to make an itinerary.  2 things I absolutely want to do is go see a Sumo match and a Japanese baseball game.\n\n**Sumo**: There's a summer basho tournament at Ryogoku Kokugikan from May 14-28, but all the tickets are sold out on the only site I could find that sells them ([PIA/Ticket Oosumo](https://sell.pia.jp/inbound/selectTicket.php?eventCd=2307491&amp;rlsCd=025&amp;langCd=eng)).  Is there a secondary market for these events?  Or, where is a reputable site to purchase tickets to the morning practice rounds if I can't get a proper ticket?   Is it worth doing any of those Rakuten tours?\n\n**Baseball**: I think I figured out how to buy tickets for the Tokyo Giants, but my options are either a 2pm day game against the Nippon-Ham Fighters on Friday 6/2 or one of their 10pm night games on that Friday (doubleheader) or Saturday.  I have to assume the night game has a better atmosphere but I'm not sure if I want to spend one of my last weekend nights at a baseball game.  Has anyone been to a night game for the Giants, what's the atmosphere like at night?\n\nWould also appreciate any other tips/etiquette I should know about attending a sumo/baseball match!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I could be wrong but I have never heard of a 10pm game as the finishing time would be problematic due to the subway (Tokyo Metro) closing time.\n\nRe: Sumo - Pre-COVID, you could go to the Kokugikan early in the morning and get cheap seats. However, I don\u2019t know if this is still the case.",

The Giants are the biggest team but if you don't support them then you dislike them the most. Basically they are the Yankees.\n\nEither would be good experience though and there are no bad baseball stadiums in Japan  In my view the best experience for baseball is:\n\n1. Hanshin Tigers\n2. Yokohama Baystars\n3. Yakult Swallows",

They're doing pretty well this year so the atmosphere is especially great right now!   \nKannai/Sakuragicho/Minatomirai area overall is a pretty nice option to just hang around for a more chill and relaxed day, but for more touristy stuff, Yokohama Chinatown is literally right by the stadium, and the famous Nissin Cup Noodle Museum is pretty close too.       \nOr for a more active option, you can visit Kamakura/Enoshima area in the morning, and easily pop by Kannai for a Baystars night game on your way back to Tokyo too! (tip: take JR Keihin-Tohoku Line from Ofuna on your way from Kamakura/Enoshima area!)",

Match started at 6pm and finished around 9.30pm due to a tie at the end of the 9th innings, so it went to a 10th.

I have no idea what\u2019ll be like, but I am led to believe it\u2019ll be fantastic.  There was a Redditor yesterday on this sub who had over-ordered tickets and was trying to sell them. I can\u2019t remember the date they were offering, but it might help you?",

JapanBallTickets posts a nice calendar with the games for all teams in Japan in Japan Standard Time, refer to this to make sure the game time is correct (others have correctly noted games typically start at either 14:00 or 19:00 JST).\n\nCheck out r/NPB also.

I normally find baseball ga to be boring, but absolutely loved the energy, cordiality and liveliness of Japanese baseball.   We sat by the opposing team\u2019s cheering section and it was just fun.  There\u2019s no antagonists rivalry, but just lots of love of the game.\n\nA couple other things we noticed was (1) no hot dogs and (2) how incredibly clean and organized everything was.  As we left, the trash sorting was next level.  You empty out the contents of your food &amp; beverage containers before discarding the containers in the appropriate trash bins (sorted by type). \n\nWhile we managed to find our section just fine, finding our seats wasn\u2019t as easy.  But in their typical fashion, if you ask someone, they will kindly guide you to your seats.  Hope you manage to make it to the game; you\u2019ll have a blast!",

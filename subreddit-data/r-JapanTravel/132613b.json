    "postText": "Hi all! My wife and I are planning a trip for November. We will be bringing our daughter who will be 1.5 years old. This will be my wife's first time in Japan. I've been once before to Osaka/Kyoto/Tokyo so I will be somewhat familiar with the areas we plan to visit. Obviously with the baby we will be limited in how much we can do but we plan to take it slow and day by day, and I've tried not to pack too much into any one day. So far the only thing we have booked are flights. Would love to hear any feedback or recommendations for our itinerary! We both love food, I mostly just enjoy seeing cool things and places, and my wife loves anything stationery related (pens, notebooks, stickers, stamps, etc.)\n\nOverall the plan is to fly into Osaka, plan to spend about half the trip in Osaka/Kyoto area, bullet train to Tokyo, spend the remainder of the trip there and fly out from Tokyo. We plan to use Osaka/Kyoto/Tokyo as our main hubs to stay but are open to spending a night or two elsewhere if it makes sense to do so, and is not too far out of the way or difficult to get to with the baby.\n\n**Day 1**\n\n* In flight all day\n\n**Day 2** \n\n* Land in Osaka late afternoon\n* Check into accommodation and hang around the area (any recommendations for best place to stay in Osaka? I was thinking around the Namba area.)\n\n**Day 3** \n\n* Osaka Castle\n* Shinsaibaishi\n* Dotonbori\n\n**Day 4** \n\n* Nara daytrip\n\n**Day 5**\n\n* Free day in Osaka\n* Maybe Osaka Aquarium or USJ, but we're not chomping at the bit to go there\n\n**Day 6**\n\n* We were thinking of trying to find an onsen or ryokan to stay at for one night around the area. Preferably one with a private open air bath within the room (I know those are rare and pricey in this area). Any recommendations? My research has led me to Sansuikan just outside Osaka or Sumiya in Kyoto. When we were planning this trip before the baby was in the picture I wanted to go to Kinosaki, but I'm not sure if it would be worth it with the baby in tow. Thoughts?\n\n**Day 7**\n\n* Kinkakuji\n* Ryoanji\n* Arashiyama, bamboo forest\n* Any recommendations on where to stay in Kyoto? Was thinking close to Kyoto Station.\n\n**Day 8**\n\n* Fushimi Inari\n* Nishiki Market\n* Gion\n\n**Day 9**\n\n* Kiyomizudera\n* Free day in Kyoto\n\n**Day 10**\n\n* Shinkansen to Tokyo\n* Recommendations for where to stay? I know it doesn't matter all too much since the city is well connected with the metro.\n* Check in accommodation and settle in\n\n**Day 11**\n\n* Ikebukuro/Sunshine City\n* Shinjuku\n\n**Day 12**\n\n* Asakusa\n* Akihabara\n\n**Day 13**\n\n* Odaiba/Tsukiji (would like to do omakase if possible, any recommendations here?)\n* Maybe teamlab planets?\n* Ginza\n\n**Day 14**\n\n* Day trip to Yokohama, Kamakura\n* Ramen museum\n* Chinatown\n\n**Day 15**\n\n* Meiji Shrine\n* Shibuya\n\n**Day 16**\n\n* Maybe Ghibli museum if possible? My wife is a big fan. I've heard mixed reviews of the place.\n* Other than that no plans, free day in Tokyo\n\n**Day 17**\n\n* Free day in Tokyo\n\n**Day 18**\n\n* Flight home\n\nThanks everyone for your time and feedback!",

                    "comment": "Ginza used to be next to Tsukiji, now the market has moved to a new location and far less interesting, although drunk tourists made the location much less viable in recent years. I used to like to visit it before work when it was more open. \n\nThe shinkansen goes to Shinyokohama station, not Yokohama. It's not a long trip or anything, but it's directly where you want to go. If you want to visit Yokohama it's really easy from Tokyo, but you can pick your hotel to make the trip a little easier if you want. I don't think the time saved would be worth changing hotels again. \n\nIt's only about 35 minutes to Kyoto for 400-500 yen or so depending on where you are on Osaka. It's easy enough to head up there if you want to see more things in Kyoto. If you are looking for the early start to avoid crowds, staying there is probably better. I find Osaka quite fun though.",

Do you have accommodations booked yet? Or when do you think you'll have them booked by? I'm nervous about bookings filling up fast.",

Have you used this service before, and how painless is it?",

That might be more trouble than it's worth. \n\nI use the delivery services all the time in Japan for bags, scuba gear, snowboard stuff, even just clothes and stuff when visiting friends. It will be delivered overnight. If you are staying in hotels you can have it sent directly to your next place. Just talk to the staff at the hotel when you check in about how to do it. They'll help fill out the form and arrange to have it picked up by one of the delivery services.",

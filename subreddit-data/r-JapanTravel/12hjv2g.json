            "comment": "The JR pass is great for traveling across country, but I highly recommend you get a Suica or PASMO card for using the local subways and trains, especially in Tokyo. You can buy and reload them at any station and all you do is tap them as you go in and you\u2019re set. All the different ones work everywhere, not just Tokyo. You can also use them to buy stuff from vending machines, convenience stores, and arcades. If you have iPhones, you can also put them in your Apple wallet so you tap your phone instead of the card, but be careful doing that because there\u2019s a bug going around where you can\u2019t reload the card if you put it on Apple wallet. The exception is that you can reload Suica specifically, but only if the card you\u2019re using to fund it is a MasterCard\n\nSo my recommendation is to use the JR pass wherever you\u2019re able, and then get a Suica card to use where you can\u2019t. If you have a MasterCard and an iPhone get Suica 100% but if not, PASMO also works if you stick to using the physical card or preload it with enough yen to last the whole trip",

I\u2019m planning to try it on my trip, but it shows you where you can get discounts or little free gifts by showing a qualifying ticket.",

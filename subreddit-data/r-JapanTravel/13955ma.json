    "postText": "I have a rough outline of a upcoming solo trip in August, 8th through the 13. I know my dates are around the OBON holidays I hope it isn't crazy packed everywhere. I intend to get a JR pass from their website so I can book all my expected Shinkansen trips in advance. I work overnights on east coast time so it should help offset some jet lag as I already don't know what time of day it is. I'm super open to being flexible with my days if I can get \n\nDay one Aug 8th -\n\nLand in Osaka around 2:30 pm. I'm not sure how long ill be in the airport but I estimate 2 and half hours to get through customs, exchange some money, and pick up my JR pass. My hotel is the near the Hakura stop in Tennoji so based upon what time I leave the airport I want to either drop my bags of or head to the Pok\u00e9mon caf\u00e9 directly if I get a reservation for last seating of the day. In any case ill end the night checking out around Tstenkaku.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay two Aug 9th -\n\nUniversal Studios. I aim to be there I'm not sure if I should upgrade to the express pass since ill be able to use the single rider pass. Any thoughts on this would be helpful. I intend to get there a least a hour before the official opening to grab something to eat while I wait, I heard they don't allow outside food into the park, and in case the allow folks in early. I'm aiming for Super Nintendo world first and foremost; The No Limit parade, and Jurassic park. If I can see anything else afterward I'll do that. After the park ill head to Dontonbori area to eat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 3, Aug 10th -\n\nI'll start early and head to Namba Yasaka Jinja. I then have a ticket to the Tower of the Sun. Depending on how I feel I might head to LaLaport ExpoCity or head directly to nara to see:  Todai-ji, Ujimido and get some mochi at Nakatanidou. My time is a bit nebulous around here and what to see based upon how day goes. I want to check out Teamlabs and at least see Osaka castle.  If I get the ticket I gonna take the Sunset Seto overnight to Yokohama for my next leg of my stay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 4, Aug 11th -\n\nI'm not sure what I'm doing this day concretely. The Pok\u00e9mon world championships are from the 11th to the 13th in Yokohama so I waiting to see what's in store. Alternately I can head to Hakone Open air museum directly from the train arriving in Yokohama. \n\nDay 5, Aug 12th -\n\nI'll head to Tokyo. I'll Start the day with Meiji Shrine. Then Nakono Broadway. The Yoyoi Kusama Museum. Akihabra shopping then back to Yokohama.\n\nDay 6, Aug 13th -\n\nGundam Factory and the Pok\u00e9mon Championship.\n\nDay 7, Aug 14th -\n\nImperial Palace, Tokyo Tower, Unicorn Gundam in Odaiba and Odaiba beach\n\nDay 8, Aug 15th -\n\nA free day to do some laundry and (early or late) and find check out some shines and eat at Yokohama Chinatown.\n\nDay 9, Aug 16th -\n\nCheck out and head to Kyoto as early as possible. I want to check into my hostel visit the pokemon center in Kyoto, its a short walk from where i'll be, and head back out to see the Gozan no Okuribi. \n\nDay 10, Aug 17th-\n\nHead to Fushimi Inari at first light so i can make it to the top before the crowds (or at least half way up). Kodai-Ju Zen Temple. Kameya Kiyonaga for some sweets. Heian Shrine. I'll pick something up to eat as dinner at Nishiki Market.\n\nDay 11, Aug 18th-\n\nI'm torn on where to start my day. Either Kinkaku-Ji, The Bamboo Forest or the Monkey park. In any case I don't think I can see all three as the next thing I have planned is another theme park, Toei Kyoto Studio park and I think the earlier I'm there the better my day will be. \n\nDay 12, Aug 19th-\n\nI head to Hakata first thing. I arrive at my only capsule hotel of my trip. I check in and stuff what can into the storage locker. I want to book a reservation to the Kirby caf\u00e9 and also see the Gundam at Gundam park Fukuoka. \n\nDay 13, Aug 20th-\n\n6am Hello Kitty Shinkansen to Hiroshima to see the peace memorial and the castle. If I have time I'll stop off at Himeji to see it's castle and lastly back to Osaka for my late night flight.",

            "comment": "Day2: are you sure you wanna quit early? You can be in there until like 9. plus sometimes you can the afternoon slot (my slot was at 4.30), so you need to wait until that time to enter nintendo world then queue like 1 - 1 1/2 hour for koopa challenge, 30 mins - 1 houe for yoshi adventure.\n\n\nDay 5-8: on day 5, no way you can do everything in there. Return trip yokohama - tokyo is like 2 1/2 hours. Nakano broadway to akihabara is like 30 mins. Not sure why do you wanna stay in yokohama. Just stay in tokyo. You can do gundam factory and china town in one day (I am sure you can also do the beach too).\n\nDay 9: IMO, just do tokyo, fukuoka, osaka. Osaka to kyoto is like 30 mins and you can do day trip like that.\n\nIf not tokyo, fukuoka, hiroshima, kyoto, osaka. Trust me, it makes more sense this way, I also went to gundam side F fukuoka, diver city odaiba and gundam factory yokohama 2 weeks ago, so yes, I already experienced it.\n\nIMO:\n\nDay 1: stay in osaka \n\nDay 2: activate 7 days jr pass to tokyo (2 1/2 hours)\n\nDay 2-6 tokyo (stay 5 nights)\n\nDay 7: to fukuoka (5 hours), stay 1 night\n\nDay 8: to hiroshima then to kyoto (jr pass ends here)\n\nAfter that stay in kyoto, then to osaka.\n\nThis way you can maximize your jr pass. If you do it your way, you will pay around 18K yen more. *The 7 days jr pass only costs 29K vs 14 days jr pass 47K yen",

                    "comment": "Day 2. Yeah trying to figure out USJ I'm a bit of a fluster. I'm going to be buying through the app directly so I'm not sure if I should get an express pass with timed entry for rides or just get a regular pass and get on single rider lines. If I'm early enough to the park I should be able to either get into the nintendo area before they are doing timed entry and/or use the app to get a early enough timed entry slot to the area. All the other rides are secondary and by time I go the current anime theme area will have switched over to something new. I'm not a Harry Potter fan so I'd more than likely skip that area. Last year I ran into train station in London that has the 9 3/4 train platform and was so confused as to why folks were standing around next to a wall trying to get a picture\ud83d\ude05 .\n\nDay 5-8 I'm staying in Yokohama because it's the cheapest deal I could find, it's nearer to the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships at the convention center, and hopefully they bring back the Pikachu Outbrrak this year I'd be around to see the festivities. I also set up this trip around these festivities. Also I really want to ride the Sunrise Seto overnight. With that said your itinerary is a heavy consideration.",

It will be really tiring, just saying.\n\nYokohama also have cosmo world and ramen museum if you want to add more activities.\n\nIf you still wanna do your itinerary, then I suggest you to buy 14 days Jr pass.\n\nExpress pass can be a gamble. I bought it and the park was kinda empty that almost everything below 30 mins (even koopa challenge only like 60 mins). The only upside is that you guaranteed to enter nintendo world",

I'll look it up. \n\nYeah I was thinking about the 14 day JR pass. I'm staying at pretty cheap location so it'll balance out the cost.\n\nIt really is a gamble with the express pass.",

            "comment": "3. You are looking at 100 minutes to get from the park station to Nara, so over 2 hours from somewhere in the park to the nearby sites. I'd skip going to Nara on this day. Kyoto will be easier to get to from the park I think, but you'll need a bus to get to Ibaraki station or something. You'd be better off heading back down to the castle, but it's still a bit of a trip from the park. \n\n4. I really like the Open Air museum, but that's 90 minutes from Yokohama using a combination of train and bus. Seems like a bit of a pain. Make sure you'd actually get there early enough to have to enjoy it. \n\n7. Do you check the guide books? The imperial palace gardens are closed on Mondays and Fridays. I don't really think it's worth visiting. I think there are better gardens around.",

Even with visiting the Tower of the Sun when they open going to Nara is a bit of a stretch. I guess I'll stay around Osaka hit the castle up along with secondary and tertiary places on I've marked out around Osaka.\n\n4. I intend to catch at Yokohama Station when the Sunrise seto arrives at 6:33 for a train to the open air museum. I should arrive in the area around the time they open I can maximize my time and avoid crowds. I've also thought about going to Owakudani since I'll be in the area. So I can spend the better part of my day in Hankone area then head back to Yokohama to check in and see what the evening can bring me.\n\n7. You right I got the days mixed up in my planning between Navitime and what's in my Google calendar. But that's good to know about the gardens I'll think about switching it out, I was supposed to visit it on day 8 in anycase.",

If you must go, get the fastpass just to help prevent heatstroke. Make sure to always drink water, cover your head, rest somewhere cool periodically, and don\u2019t try to push yourself too much. Heatstroke is no joke. August is a brutal time of year to be a tourist in Japan.",

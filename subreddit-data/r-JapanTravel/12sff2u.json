    "postText": "Hi everyone, a friend and I will be traveling to Japan in a couple of weeks for the first time and wanted some feedback on our itinerary (especially for the Hakone/Kyoto portion, where I feel it might be too ambitious). \n\nUnfortunately the start of our trip will be during Golden Week but some people here said it's not as bad in Tokyo (where we'll be starting our trip). We'll also be packing lighter coming in to allow for clothes/souvenir shopping. \n\nWe don't have much planned in terms of food/restaurants -  we've heard the more popular spots need reservations but we're not that picky - we definitely want to experience a BBQ/all-you-can-eat type restaurant though.\n\nHere's our current plan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**May 4 (Arrival Date)**\n\nArrive at Narita Airport in the afternoon (14-hour flight)\n\n* Pick up JR Passes, Suica cards, and rent pocket wi-fi\n* Check into Shinjuku hotel, get settled, local restaurant, maybe shopping if there's enough time or we're not jetlagged?\n\n**May 5 (Shinjuku)**\n\n* Tokyo Metro Gov Building\n* Shinjuku Gyoen Park\n* Shopping\n\n**May 6 (Shibuya)**\n\n* Harajuku\n   * Nezu Museum\n   * Meiji Shrine Area? Shopping?\n* Yoyogi Park\n* Shibuya Sky (5 p.m. reservation)\n* Parco Mall (Nintendo Store, etc)\n\n**Sunday, May 7 (Team Labs/Akihabara)**\n\n* Team Labs (10:30 a.m. reservation)\n* Akihabara (we're semi-casual video game/anime fans)\n\n**May 8 (Asakusa)**\n\nA more relaxed day for our last day in Tokyo\n\n* Nakamise and Dempoin Street\n* Sensoji Temple area\n* Hoppy Street for food\n* Sumida River walk? Is Tokyo Skytree worth it?\n\n**May 9 (Hakone)**\n\n*(Forward luggage to Kyoto, traveling light to Hakone)*\n\n* Travel to Hakone (buy free pass in Odawara Station\n* Take upper train for scenic view on the way to Gora\n* Hakone-Tozan Cable Car, Hakone Ropeway down to Togendai Station\n* Sightseeing cruise over to Moto Hakone Pier\n   * Relax and eat here\n* Hakone Shrine, Detached Palace?\n* Make our way to the ryokan (which is near the Hakone Open Air Museum)\n\n**May 10 (Hakone/travel to Kyoto)**\n\n* Hakone Open Air Museum\n* Travel to Kyoto and check into hotel\n* Eat, relax, shopping maybe?\n\n**May 11 (Central Kyoto)**\n\n* Nijo Castle\n* Nishiki Market\n* Kinkakuji\n* Ginkakuji and Philosopher's Path? (East)\n\n**May 12 (Western Kyoto)**\n\n* Arashiyama Bamboo Forest\n* Tenryuji Temple\n* Togetsukyo Bridge to the Monkey Park\n\n**May 13 (Osaka)**\n\n* Shopping in Osaka Station\n* Umeda Sky Building\n* Osaka Castle\n* Shinsekai\n   * Any time to visit Abenos Harukas (skyscraper/shopping area) beforehand?\n\n**Sunday, May 14 (Nara)**\n\n* Kofukuji\n* Nara Park\n* National Museum\n\n**May 15 (Last full day - Kyoto/Osaka?)**\n\n***(Should we be forwarding luggage back to Tokyo for our flight back the next day? At this point, we'll have 2 suitcases each with a backpack/duffel bag as well but we've also never used the service so it's still a foreign concept to us)***\n\n* Fushimi Inari Shrine\n* Dotonbori if we couldn't visit after Shinsekai on May 13\n\nThis will be a catch-up day for anything we either didn't do or want to revisit. We're open to suggestions as well. Maybe sake tasting somewhere?\n\n**May 16 (Travel back to Tokyo/Departing Flight)**\n\n* Train from Kyoto to Tokyo\n* Pick up luggage if it was shipped the day before\n* Flight in the late afternoon, at 5:30 p.m.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance, everyone!",

            "comment": "I just got back and am going to do a write-up soon, but a couple tips from my experience:\n\n1. Hakone deserves 2 nights in my opinion, especially if you're staying at a ryokan. Our check in was at 3, with an early dinner at 5:30. That didn't leave us with any time to go explore the town/mountains. The next day we had breakfast, and then checkout was at 10, which also doesn't leave you with time before you all have your luggage with you. There are lockers at the Hakonemoto station, but they were too small for our luggage, so there's nowhere to put your stuff to enjoy the boat and rope line. I saw you were travelling light to Hakone - I think that's smart. If you add an extra day to Hakone, your luggage shipment will have more time too.  \nBut the biggest issue is that the bus system there is pretty horrible. It's very hard to use with Google Maps because most of the stops aren't listed in English on Google for some reason, and it's hard to know what bus is going what direction (there are no platforms listed like on trains). Some buses were even too packed to board. The buses ended up eating hours of our day.  \nDo yourself a favor and just stay for two nights. That area is so worth it, and we regretted not spending more time there. Your schedule looks way too packed only because it doesn't consider the crazy times to actually travel up and down the mountain by bus.\n2.  Fushimi Inari shrine is incredible, and the payoff for waking up and doing it early without big crowds is legitimate. I definitely suggest gearing up for 2.5-3 hours of hiking if you're going the back way through it. It was great.\n3. My group was pretty nerdy and expected to spend a day or more browsing Akihabara, and we just.... didn't enjoy it. It's pretty washed up, and seemed like the same anime statue store 100 times in a row. Super Potato was cool, but realistically, we're not going to buy and play any Japanese games, so it was just interesting. Unless you're very big fans of anime statues, or interested in browsing what is essentially a gaming museum, have a second set of activities planned nearby in case you get bored. I'd personally go so far as recommending you skip it.\n4. Tokyo Skytree was fun for my group because it has a pokemon center, a kirby cafe, a Jump store, a Harry Potter Store, a Marvel store, and good food on the lower levels.\n5. I recommend starting your Teamlab day with a very early wakeup and going to Tsukiji Market for some food in the morning. Get there around 7:30-8, browse the stands before it gets too busy (it will already be somewhat busy), and then Teamlab is about a 30-40 minute walk away by my memory. Incredible food, tons of variety, my group loved it.\n\nOne man's opinions, you'll have a great time no matter what you do. Enjoy!",

Looks like I'll have to do some adjustments to the Hakone portion of the trip, maybe offload some things to the 2nd day if we can't extend our stay. The way things are now, we'd probably miss dinner at the ryokan.\n\n2. Glad to hear about Fushimi Inari, it's a good thing we have almost a full day for that area.\n\n3. We're not big on anime statues and probably won't be buying Japanese games. Fortunately we only have about half a day dedicated to Akihabara so we'll play it by ear.\n\n4 &amp; 5. We'll look into both, thank you.\n\n\nLooking forward to your write-up, I'm glad you had fun!",

            "comment": "It looks good and fun! I do share your concern for the first Hakone day. For reference, we did something similar but our itinetary looked like:\n\nDay 1\nArrive at ryokan in Gora area late afternoon\nDinner\n\nDay 2\nBreakfast\nStart around 11am from Gora\nCable car\nRopeway \nTurn back (ropeway and cable car), return to Gora around 3pm\n\nWe were planning to take the boat after the ropeway and then return the same way we came, but the boat return trip would take about 2 hours and we were worried about missing the last cable car around 16.45 (and they announced they might close the ropeway early because of strong winds). Of course we did start rather late around 11am, but depending on the mode of transportation you're planning to take, keep in mind that the cable car and ropeway close around 5pm.\n\nThe Hakone Loop was beautiful, but also very crowded so you may need to wait a bit to go from one mode of transportation to the next. \n\nTo travel to Hakone I recommend the Romancecar. Try to book tickets on the observation deck, you get great views that way. You can go from Shinjuku to Hakone-Yumoto and buy the Hakone Free Pass from Hakone-Yumoto. Then transfer to the Hakone Tozan train to Gora.\n\nLuggage forwarding: we had great experiences with this, but found it too risky to do it for the airport. Timelines look like: deposit luggage early morning or night before, receive it the next day around 2pm. But could be later. If you plan to take the shinkansen on May 16, you can book seats with extra luggage space and bring even large suitcases.",

Some shops started closing right at 5pm, but plenty were open till 5:30 (when we left).\n\nTokyo Skytree was a good experience for us, but it was also the only observatory deck we went to, so take with a grain of salt.\n\nHope you have the best time! :)",

    "postText": "As the title says, I recently returned from Japan and I had the time of my life. Everything from the food, culture, Japanese people's politeness and the craziness of Tokyo...It was an absolute blast. Super keen on getting back out there again for longer. I'll definitely be more well prepared to make journey much smoother, which I'll go into more detail below. I spend 11 days in total in Japan which was spread across Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. I also travelled solo.\n\n**Airport**\n\nRegardless of what airport you fly into, you'll want to take the public trains into Tokyo. Taxi's are notooriously expensive in Japan and should only be used in emergencies. This is assuming you are on a budget, otherwise go crazy.\n\nIf you can, I highly advise you to fly into Haneda as it'll make your journey much shorter and easier to get to Tokyo. Narita is nowhere near Tokyo and you'll have to take a long train journey to Tokyo station most likely which is a pain to navigate even without being jetlagged.\n\n**On Arrival At Airport**\n\nSo there are a couple of things you want to do when you touch down. Buy a Sim Card and get a Pasmo/Suica card.\n\n* So I tried to cut costs and buy a sim card once I got closer to my accomodation. Although it saved me money, it was a pain getting to my accomodation relying on free wifi and directions I prepared before my flight. I would say buy a sim card at the airport. Make sure your phone is unlocked.\n* The other thing you'll want to do is get a pasmo/suica card. Not sure the difference between the two but the method is more or less the same. Load the card up with money and you can use that for travel, vending machines etc. Trust me it'll save so much time and hassle!\n* The other thing I'll reccomend is taking out a lot of cash. If you're buying the Pasmo/Suica card I believe you'll have to have physical cash to load them up. I'll say take out around $200 worth for now. Although a lot of places in Tokyo accept card, the country is still a cash based society so you'll almost certainly come across establishments that only take cash.\n\n**Commuting**\n\nUnless you are willing to blow a ton of money during your trip, you will be depending on public transport during your trip. In all three cities I visitied, I was using public transport several times a day. There is also the Shinkansen to get from Tokyo to the Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto). It's great and an activity within itself.\n\n**Other notes**\n\nYeah so Japan's culture is different from the west. So try your best to assimiliate, look up videos on Youtube on what to expect and do. Learn some Japanese as well. These aren't a must but you don't want to look like a\\*\\*hole. Sooner you start the better.\n\n**Itinerary**\n\nDay 1: Arrived in Tokyo and settled in. Stayed in Shinjuku. Walked around Shinjuku, avoided the scammers in Shinjuku (wasted some of their time by having pointless conversations). Had some ramen and hung out with fellow solo travellers in Golden Gai.\n\nDay 2: Checked out Tsukiji Market for some delicious fresh seafood. Ventured off to Akihabara to check out the nerd culture and play some games. Ended the night in Golden Gai before going to a batting cage.\n\nDay 3: Visited Asakusa for temples and shopping in the area. Went to Shibuya in the evening to check out the crossing and ate some sushi from a conveyer belt resturaunt. Had a nap before heading to Roppongi for a bar crawl. Ended up in Shibuya again for an Izakaya (specialised in chicken skin) and nightclub (Womb).\n\nDay 4: Woke up late from being exhausted from the previous night. Checked out Ikebukuro for sunshine city. Had Wagyu beef for dinner in Akihabara.\n\nDay 5: Checked out Teamlab Planets (very cool). Wandered around Shinjuku some more (Don Quiote store is fun) before going to an anime themed bar in Nakano. Ended the night at an Izakaya in Shinjuku, Karaoke and nightclub (Warp).\n\nDay 6: Slept in for a bit before heading to the Shinkansen to Osaka. Got myself a bento box for the journey. On arrival in Osaka I checked into my hostel around Namba area and I had curry at a buffalo curry place (forgot the name). Explored Dottonbori for a bit and tried some street food.\n\nDay 7: Went to Universal Studios Japan. Such a fun experience but the food was poor. If you go buy the express pass as it will save time. Went back to Namba area after for some Shabu-shabu (hot pot) before going to a karaoke and club (Giraffe).\n\nDay 8: Took it easy and checked out Osaka castle. Had some more food in the Dottonbori area before going to a bar to chillout. Had an early night for the next day.\n\nDay 9: Day trip to Kyoto. That's right I only did a day trip. However, I managed to check out a lot of the main sights (Fushimi-Inari, Ginkaku-Ji, Gion, Arashiyama). It was very crowded so had to depend on a taxi to get to Kyoto station. Ended the day with some drinks at a bar and went to Giraffe club again.\n\nDay 10: Train back to Tokyo. Grabbed another bento box. Stayed in the Roppongi area which is a rather bougie area. Relaxed at an Onsen (public bathhouse) which was uncomfortable until you get in the bath. Highly reccomend. Had some Sushi before heading to bed.\n\nDay 11: Last day in Japan. My flight wasn't until late night so spent the day checking out Ueno and doing some shopping (lot's of snacks). Ate as much food as possible before getting the Narita express to the airport.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it. I feel like I did a decent amount whilst leaving enough time to just explore and not feel pressured to stick to a plan. Honestly, there is a ton of stuff to do in Japan and some of my favourite nights were when I just had an open mind. My favourite areas in Tokyo were Tsukiji Market, Shinjuku and Shibuya. I reccomend staying in the Shinjuku area if you are into nightlife and good food. Otherwise, check out Asakusa which is more chill but has tons to do. For Osaka, I would say stay in the Namba area if you are into nightlife.\n\nOverall, Japan was a blast with so many cool things such as vending machines (which actually work), their obsession with Gatcha toys and the variety of foods they have on offer. I definitely want to check out this amazing country again.",

So you'll want to get a ticket before getting on the train, rather than just wandering over and sitting in a random seat.  I hear you can do this via the ticket machine these days, though that's new since the last time I was there.  But it was still pretty easy to go up to the ticket counter and show them my JR Pass, and say \"I want to get on the (time) Narita Express to (location)\".",

So yes, you have to activate the JR Pass in order to use it to ride the Narita Express.  If you'll be leaving before the pass expires, you could use it to get back to the airport, though.\n\nAll the seats on the NEX are reserved, though, so you do need to get a seat reservation, rather than just stroll onto the train and sit in a random seat.  :)",

There's never been a problem using foreign credit cards in stores. \n\nThere has always been some issues with certain websites due to 3D secure, but what changed in early August was the inability to charge PASMO and Suica on smart phones with foreign issued Visa and MC credit (not debit) cards. It was/is particularly irritating for those of us who use a card like Chase Sapphire, which gives bonus points for travel related expenses. \n\nSince August, MasterCard is kind of hit and go but Visa is still an issue. AMEX has always been OK. All parties involved, Visa, PASMO, Suica, Apple, all say that there shouldn't be a problem and that it's not on their end. (again note please that we are only talking about charging of mobile pasmo and Suica with Visa credit cards)",

Reach out to T-Mobile and ask. You don\u2019t strictly need to let them know you\u2019re \u201croaming\u201d as long as you have what\u2019s called \u201cSimple Global\u201d on your plan, so ask if you have that specifically. \n\nYou won\u2019t need an eSIM if you do unless you want a backup network to fall back on. If you\u2019re on Simple Global, you\u2019ll be on 4G LTE speeds (not 256kbps) for 5GB per billing cycle, after which it\u2019ll drop down to 256kbps but still be active. Ubigi offers 5G speeds and you can get it in small amounts to supplement areas where T-Mobile might not work well.\n\nIf your phone is compatible with eSIM, it\u2019ll also be new enough to work with IC tap points just fine. \n\nHope this helps.\n\n-edit: I double-checked, you\u2019ll have data in Japan only if Magenta Military is like my plan in that it\u2019s an alternate version of Magenta MAX. I see there\u2019s \u201cMagenta Military\u201d and \u201cMagenta MAX Military\u201d, I assume you\u2019d need Magenta MAX Military. Otherwise, it\u2019ll only work as I described in \u201c11 European countries\u201d",

It's Maihama Station which is connected to Tokyo Station on the same line (I think it's called JR Keiyo Line). Not worth using a day of the JR Rail Pass on it since it's so close. You can put it into Google Maps to estimate the fare.\n\nKawaguchiko - tldr you can take JR from Shinjuku Station to Otsuki and can use the JR Pass for that section. Then you will have to change trains to a different train from Otsuki to Kawaguchiko and pay for that portion.\n\nOR, take the Fuji Excursion which is simpler and less transfer, but there's only like 3 trains per day each way.

Intracity travel won\u2019t be more than 1,000 yen per day especially if you are efficient and group your activities per area without doubling back, most Tokyo metro would only be 200 yen per trip.\n\nI use Japan Travel Navitime to get the fares benchmark. One way Tokyo to Osaka should only be around 13-14K yen. Tokyo to Kawaguchiko is only about 2,500 yen and a portion of that isn\u2019t covered by JR (Otsuki to Kawaguchiko).  Kawaguchiko to Kyoto is almost 10K yen. Kyoto to Osaka can be done less than 1,000 yen and you go directly to city center. Osaka to Nara is also less than 600 yen one way. Osaka to Hiroshima is almost 10k.\n\nMajor trips add up to less than 50,000 yen. 21 day pass is 66,200 yen. Will you be using 16,200 for intracity travel on JR lines only? Remember that there are many intracity lines that are not JR. My guess is that you will end up saving just paying for the trips individually and intracity travel by Suica, where you can get to use it on non JR lines.",

Vibes were great, I found some Japanese people wanting to talk to foreigners, its just difficult with the language barriers. It wasn't too crowded. It usually got busy from midnight onwards (clubs close at 5am). My favourite was Womb in Shibuya and Giraffe in Osaka. They cost quite a bit though. Anywhere from 2000 yen upwards.",

The hyperdia website is no longer showing timetables. \n\nI'd like to have the exact times for when and where to get on and change trains. Will be there end of the month for three weeks. So hyperdia shows the train to take and how long and where to change and get off, but not at what times of the day. When I try any of the other apps they give different times and trains as hyperdia and they're not as user-friendly. Also the connections are never as good as hyperdias. I'd like to reserve my trains but really having a hard time with this. I know you can go to the info booth at the train stations, however I would rather not \"waste\" any time going there.Also I think the crowds will be crazy. I noticed you can see times when reserving online with JR Pass.net, but that is always just for 1 train, so I have to figure out transfer to next train, etc. I'm from Germany and travel a lot all over the world. I just don't believe that it can be that difficult to get this done in advance. Especially with Japanese efficacy in public transport.  Any recommendations?",

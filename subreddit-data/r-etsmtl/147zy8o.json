Sucked, but it was my beater bike, the one I really just used to go out at night and didnt really mind about it so I didn't call the cops... \n\nFast forward about 3-4 weeks later, I see what appears to be a homeless guy walking in the street with MY bike (it has sick stickers from CTN student body so I knew it was mine) I'm sitting in the Metro grocery having lunch with ny buddy when I see him so I just yell HEY THATS MY BIKE and start running out the door towards the guy accross the street. Immobilized the guy, both hand on my bike, he isnt letting go. I tell him look guy, this is my bike, I'm not letting it go, He says he bought it for 100$, I said go get a refund then cause this bike was stolen from me, and if you make me ask you again, I'm calling the cops. Soon as I mentioned cops he ran away, never to be seen again. \n\nAnd that kids is the story of the stolen bike!",

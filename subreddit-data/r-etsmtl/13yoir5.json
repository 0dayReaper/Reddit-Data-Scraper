I personally applied 2 weeks before start of semester of winter but for fall and asked them in the submission(theres an option to leave a note) if they had a place for winter. They did and I got a place 2 weeks prior to the semester starting. Honestly it's kind of random and you might have to be somewhat lucky.",

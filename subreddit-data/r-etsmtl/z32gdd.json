First and foremost, is to check with your university if there are ressources that allows you to transfer or study in a Canadian university without fully paying your studies(or at least a % of it). Otherwise I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much else you can do, you\u2019ll always have to pay for a lot of things while living here anyway (the airplane tickets, food, housing,books, calculator, etc). If you have specific things to ask me you can DM me.",

It's not free but it's not too expensive compared to other options. Rent can also be less expensive outside of the Montreal area which could be good in your situation [link to info about new tuition and eligibility conditions ](https://www.quebec.ca/en/education/study-quebec/financial-assistance-international-students/exemption-additional-tuition-fees-depending-program-region)",

    "postText": "**Center Hardware and Supply** (.6 Miles, 11 Min walk) - Very good hardware store, has almost all the hardware supplies I could possibly need. Don't come here for wood if you need a wide selection, otherwise, great store.\n\n**Discount Builders Supply** (1.3 Miles, 26 Min walk) - *Tons* of wood! Maybe not as well stocked as a Home Depot, but they will most likely have everything you need. I was able to purchase 4 ft x 4 ft birch plywood for only 15 dollars there. Downside is, it's a long walk. The distance to the 22 on Mission and 16th Street isn't too bad though.\n\n---\nIf you have any recommendations that aren't listed, please feel free to comment here.\n",

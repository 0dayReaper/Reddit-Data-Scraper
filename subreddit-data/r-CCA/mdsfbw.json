My EFC is and pretty much always will be 0, but I could make the argument that our financial situation has gotten worse since filing due to COVID-19. I'm an incoming freshmen in case that changes anything. My financial aid counselor basically said my fafsa aid won't change but my CCA schlorship could be reviewed if I appeal.",

If so, you could let CCA know you're considering them if they are giving you more in scholarship, and maybe CCA would match?\n\nI would appeal for a review regardless, because if they say there is any chance you can get more money that would be the way to do it.\n\nGoodluck! Don't have much more advice I can give. \n\n(I graduated from CCA in 2013 and do not work for the school)",

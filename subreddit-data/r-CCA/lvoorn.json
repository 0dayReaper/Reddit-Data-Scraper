    "postText": "Hey, so I am a high school senior currently trying to decide where I want to go for college. I definitely want to go to art school. I have gotten into Pratt, SVA, MICA, SAIC, Otis, SCAD, CCA, and some other schools like that. I want to go into animation (probably) but more of like the visual development side. I am also interested in illustration and definitely want to make my own work, and maybe a graphic novel, on the side. My top schools are RISD and CalArts but I haven't heard back from them yet. I had a few questions for anyone who is at CCA rn, because I am seriously considering it \n\n1. How is the program at preparing you for the animation industry, both skill-wise and connection-wise? \n2. How is the social life? I don't mean parties, more like the general atmosphere of the people there. I'm pretty quiet and am looking to make friends with people. Is it easy to make friends at CCA? What kind of people go to CCA?  \n3. How is the vibe in classes? I want to be around people who genuinely care about art and learning and getting better, not people who are just there for a grade or to mess around. I am also wondering about the liberal arts classes, and how they are. I am a pretty dedicated student and I have a lot of interest in history, literature, and some other academic subjects and I was wondering if I could pursue those interests at CCA. \n4. In my research I have seen that there are a lot of problems at CCA. Not in the academics or professors or anything, but the school itself. Apparently it's really unsafe, the dorms are broken down, the food is bad and expensive, and campus security is nonexistent. Is this really true? If it is, how much of a problem is it?",

            "comment": "Hello! I'm currently a 3rd year Animation student at CCA. I'll answer your questions to the best of my ability (and take them with a grain of salt, as I'm just one perspective). I'll start by saying that I did get into CalArts and Otis, but ended up choosing CCA due to budget considerations.\n\n1. Connection-wise, many animation faculty are currently or were previously working in the industry, including Pixar and other 3D graphic/ effects studios. The main thing here is you'll want to actually get to know them, go to office hours, etc. to build a relationship which could actually help you in the industry. Just having them as a teacher isn't enough. Skill-wise, in my personal opinion, CCA does a pretty good job, most notably with their Junior and Senior projects, where students have to budget their time to create a short animated film on their own or with limited help. There are also options in regards to what classes you can take if you want to specialize, like sound design, acting, and character development, but there's classes that all animations majors have to take as well. Notably, however, CCA allows for individualized majors, where you can take almost any class from any major as long as you get it cleared with faculty- so you could take a hybrid animation/ illustration course load. Do try to get student accounts of individual teachers, as they're not all created equal.\n2. As someone who is kind of awkward/shy, you'll have to put in the same amount of work as anywhere else to get to know people, but the overall atmosphere of CCA is very open, kind, and supportive. Everyone is here for the same reason, all going through similar stuff.. lots of stuff to help with connecting. I recommend getting involved in Animation club early on. As far as the kind of people who are at CCA- lots of nerds, and lots of people who are here because it was their best chance at going to art school, so most folks really care about being here. \n3. See above- this isn't universal, but I'd say the majority of people genuinely care. The required art history, English, etc classes can be really dull, but the more advanced literature classes can be great.\n4. This will be from the perspective of the Oakland campus- but be aware that the school is planning to permanently migrate to the San Francisco campus exclusively, and retire Oakland campus. I have never lived on campus, so I can't speak to that. The on-campus food is overpriced, but there's multiple other options nearby (Wendy's, Safeway). I have actually gotten to personally know campus security, and while they can be stretched thin, they are a great resource if you're willing to get to know them. Use their escort services around/ off campus if you have the time to wait for them. I've never personally had a safety issue, but I've heard of muggings, etc. from other students.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

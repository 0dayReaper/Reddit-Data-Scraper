    "postText": "Below are notes that I took from the Graduate Student Orientation, they may be kind of scattered, but I have tried to organize them to the best of my abilities.\n\n------\nLearning\n=======\n* 20% of graduate students are from another country\n* Engage at CCA, do projects with community partners\n* Work close with the faculty\n*Sharing is caring\n\n**Need a ride somewhere? Try [Casual Carpooling]**(http://www.ridenow.org/carpool/)!\n\n------\nFinancial Aid\n=======\n* **Must** apply each year for financial aid!\n* May petition once a year for *more* funding.\n* If the cost of tuition goes up, the amount of financial aid does not.\n* If you take out a private loan, or are wondering about loans, make sure to check out the people you're getting it from @ [http://www.nslds.ed.gov/](http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/)\n*You are able to exclude your Work Study income for your FAFSA\n\n------\nResources\n=======\n* There is free, web hosting at [POMO](http://www.pomo.cca.edu) and [DADA](http://www.dada.cca.edu) for CCA Students\n* For information on technology resources, visit [technology.cca.edu](technology.cca.edu)\n* ** Orientation for Labs and Shops happens in September when school starts. DON'T MISS THEM!**\n\n------\nLibrary\n=======\n* The Library's website can be found at [Library.cca.edu](library.cca.edu)\n* The SF library doesn't have very much fine arts materials, what they do have is Any exhibition catalogs within the past 5 years.\n* You can renew your books online at the library's website! You can also activate your reading history online as well, so you can keep track of what books you've checked out.\n* **HOW TO ACTIVATE YOUR READING HISTORY ONLINE**: On the library home page go to renew books. Log in and click on to reading history. Choose to opt in. The computer will keep a list of your checkouts which you may maintain or edit. - Michael. Simpson Library\n* Grad students may have up to 20 items out at a time, with renewal up to 3 times.\n\n------\nSecurity\n=======\n\nIf you ever feel like you are unsafe, and need an escort, CCA will gladly provide one. They will walk to any destination with you up to 15 minutes away (30 minute round trip for them)\n\nThe numbers are\n* SF - 415-726-2061\n* Oakland 510-385-1821\n\nIf you happen to forget, you can look on the back of your student ID.\n\nAlso, CCA is now a **No smoking campus**. That's both kinds.\n\n-------\nhope this helped someone, if you have any questions feel free to ask and hopefully I can answer them. If I can't, I'll find someone who can.",

I know that CCA has a high acceptance rate, but I was wondering what I should focus on and include in my portfolio to increase my chances to get in. I was also wondering if the essay plays a major part in getting accepted.\n\nSide Question: But I am interested in the animation program in CCA, and I was wondering if it was good?",

            "comment": "Hiya, I was recently accepted into CCA's graduate architecture program. I start in the fall but can share my experience with the application.\n\nFor the MArch program, the most important thing is the portfolio. The essays are important too, but all the guidance I received was to focus most of my time on the portfolio. They want to get to know you, how you tick, what motivates you. Focus on getting that across in each piece of the application.\n\nThe admissions department is incredibly helpful and provided fantastic feedback on all parts of my application. They were happy to review things well before submission (they aren't on the application review board, but they are in close contact). I'd say reach out to them, and they can even connect you to a professor.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "i can\u2019t answer all of these questions as I graduated a bit ago, however I found making friends at CCA pretty easy! I was a studio art grad student, who also was co-director of the graduate student alliance, which I was able to meet many people in different majors through. For undergrads, I believe the Chimera council also puts on events.\n\nAttend as many of the lectures that you can! Even if they aren\u2019t illustration lectures. I learned more from attending lectures for other focuses than I thought I would, and it\u2019s also a decent way to meet people.\n\nThere are lots of clubs at CCA, official and unofficial. Feel free to reach out to the student life department to get more info!\n\nI think the main problem I faced as a student, and after being a student, was money. CCA isn\u2019t cheap and they aren\u2019t great at giving scholarships to the vast majority of students. I knew people that really struggled to survive during school, and most moved away after graduating. I\u2019m still struggling to pay for CCA. I would *highly* recommend going to a financial adviser, maybe one not affiliated with the school, to explain just how the loan payments may affect your future. It is, in my opinion, the biggest obstacle the school (and many other private art schools) face\u2014the debt they leave their students under.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I am interested in getting a Master's but I am a bit unsure about which universities to apply to.  In my experience students and staff have pretty different views, so I thought it would be worth a shot to post some of my questions here (and on the communities of the other universities I'm considering):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How well can you live there without a car?\n2. What is the living cost really like? \n3. Is the international department helpful?\n4. Are there a lot of networking opportunities?\n5. Are there many job opportunities for international students?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance to whoever replies to this! :)",

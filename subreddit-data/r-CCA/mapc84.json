    "postText": "Hi! I have been looking into to transferring to CCA either this spring or next Fall. I want to go into animation so this means I\u2019ll be on the Oakland campus. I have heard some things about the Oakland area but I wanted to hear it from people who have actually lived there. I feel like it would be a nice place but my family thinks otherwise.",

It would be very expensive to live around the school these days I'd imagine.\n\nI'm not sure about the cost around the Oakland campus, but I know plenty of people who live in Oakland and I wouldn't let your family scare you away from the area. It's nice. Parts of it are getting outrageously expensive. I would take a stroll on over to /r/oakland for better insight.\n\nBoth campuses themselves are safe. They both have security. When I was at the SF campus the guards will walk you to a bus stop / your car at night if you stay late. I never have had a safety issue on campus personally.",

            "comment": "the oakland campus is in rockridge which is a pretty safe neighborhood in oakland.  in 2017 and 2018 we would have like one incident per semester where a student would be walking home from the studios at night with a lot of checked out equipment and they got the equipment taken from them.  \n\nThis is extremely rare but it\u2019s a risk that\u2019s present in any college with an urban campus in a large city.  You can request campus security to walk you home within a certain radius and they can walk you to the BART station if you feel unsafe for any reason.  I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it as long as you use your head.  Plus, oakland has changed a ton, and it\u2019s generally become a very safe place, especially around campus.\n\nYou\u2019re right that the oakland campus is closing, the  transition to the new san francisco campus was supposed to happen in 2022 but it\u2019s been delayed a lot and I\u2019m not sure when the expected completion date is scheduled for now.  By the time you come here, a lot of your classes will be on the san francisco campus, but with remote learning I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll have to make the commute to san francisco if you\u2019re primarily in oakland.  Hopefully you\u2019ll get a chance to take classes on the oakland campus for a few years, it\u2019s really beautiful and it\u2019s a shame the school\u2019s giving it up. \n\nThe first year program is completely in san francisco now, so if you\u2019re transferring into it, you will be there for a majority of the time.  \n\ni\u2019m a 4th year architecture student at cca for reference",

    "postText": "I'm a journalist with San Francisco magazine and I'm currently working on an article covering San Francisco's art school graduates from the class of 2006. Our goal is to create a comprehensive \"reunion\" piece to show where former art students have ended up a decade post graduation. We'd like the piece to portray the full spectrum, showcasing both the students who have become established artists as well as those who have opted for a different field entirely. If this project sounds like something that either yourself or someone you know would like to be featured in, I can be reached at ghacia@modernluxury.com. ",

    "postText": "Hey guys, my name is Adam, I gonna be a senior at Pitt (Neuroscience major), and I'm starting a website: http://www.collegeanswerz.com/.\n\nI intend for it to be a place for college applicants to go, and trust to give them everything they need.  Answer basically any question they have, and provide any resource they need.\n\nI think that what separates this from sites like Princeton Review is that most college reviews ask questions of the reviewers that are too general.  This leads kids to omit certain information.  Information that college applicants would want to know!  I thought hard about what kids would want to know (and asked other people), and I came up with a bunch of questions.  I think that if I could get people to answer them, this would be a great resource for college applicants to get their questions answered!  If you could answer some questions for Hamilton, I'd be extremely appreciative!\n",

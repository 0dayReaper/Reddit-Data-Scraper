    "postText": "Hi, senior here. I recently got accepted into Hamilton College, and I was wondering what the vegetarian options are like for on campus dining.  I read a bit online about \"Green Monday\" and was a little bit confused as to what that actually entailed? On other days of the week are there very few vegetarian options?\n\nThanks,\nJohn",

I also lived in the CoOp for my junior and senior years (a housing option for people who want to cook their own food- you live with 20 people and cook dinners for each other- and the food was vegetarian all the time.)",

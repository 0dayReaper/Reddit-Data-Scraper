    "postText": "Hi, so I was recently admitted to Hamilton College and didn't receive too much financial aid. it costs a lot for my parents and I was wondering if Hamilton is lenient with financial aid if I negotiate the aid package with them. Does anyone here have any experience with this about requesting more aid?\n\nThanks in advance ",

They based the original offer on the high \u201csavings\u201d that the calculated. I told them how much we actually had and sent the 1099-int forms in. They approved our appeal. ",

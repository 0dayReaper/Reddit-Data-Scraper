I know that getting out of the waitlist may be hard af, but why not to try everything possible, cause I realized that Hamilton has been really kind and awesome compared to other unis I applied to. So, I wanted to ask my questions for some students to make my loci more insightful and good-looking, may I reach out to somebody here?",

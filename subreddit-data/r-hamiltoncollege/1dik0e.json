I'm somehow going to be done with finals before C&amp;C Day kicks off, saw Macklemore was coming, and was hoping they were running it like always--out on the turf, come as you are, just don't bring any open containers and it's all good.",

Which, of course, will backfire and result in everyone getting blitzed for all of Friday AND Monday.\n\nbut fuck them anyway.",

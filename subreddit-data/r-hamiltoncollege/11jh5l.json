Going to Opus, a walk in the glen, and going to the Japanese restaurant are classic, of course, but has anyone been more creative?\n\nAlso, how have people fared in the dating world? Do you find it hard to find girlfriends or boyfriends? Does your gender of choice tend to want a relationship that is too serious or not serious enough for your tastes? Other thoughts?",

Good/bad location will depend on which classes you are taking and your other activities. Any insight on these and we can try to give you a better idea!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut in general: Dunham = central and social but not nice, Major and Keehn = dark side, decently social but far from sport/sciences, Wertimer and other greyside = small but close-knit dorms, far from buildings but generally nicer rooms",

Stereotypically, Light side is more stem and econ majors and athletes, while Dark side is more arts and humanities people. Or, as I've heard said, Light side is salmon shorts, Dark side is septum piercings. There's also Grey side, which is a catch-all term for everything down the hill like Wertimer. Some of this arises from convenience--the science center and the arts building are pretty much on opposite ends of campus, so people live near one or the other for convenience--while part of it is just from people liking the vibe of one side better than the other.\n\nIt's not like a super deep social divide, don't worry too much about it, but there are definitely different cultures to the two sides of campus.",

Dark and light sides just refer to the halves of campus (dark side = old Kirkland/ women's college with the concrete buildings, light side= traditional Hamilton campus with the stone buildings) and each have their own personalities. The Dark side tends to be more artsy and humanities and the light side tends to be more sports, sciences and economics. Of course these are NOT hard and fast rules, just generalizations, especially for first years since they don't get to pick where they live. Hope this helps!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, I graduated recently but happy to help where I can.",

If you wanna live on light side (which most STEM, Econ, gov people do) I\u2019d say South, but if you\u2019d rather go for dark side (art, humanities, communications) Major and Keehn are your best bet.\n\nSouth: great location, close to biggest dining hall (commons), close to library and Lit, Math, Philosophy/Classics, and Science buildings. They do quads, have private bathrooms, and there\u2019s a kitchen per floor that the entire floor shares. \n\nKeehn/major: close to 2nd dining hall (McEwen, which is the \u2018healthier\u2019 one but has more limited food options) but also to Opus cafe (yummy food) and diner plus pub (two great choices for food lol. Pancakes, burgers, etc) Close to KJ, which has Gov, Econ, history, and film classes. Also close to the art and music buildings. I should add that I think an old building in dark side is being converted to a new Lit/Creative Writing building for the fall.",

            "comment": "Depends on if you are STEM or Humanities oriented. If you like humanities a dorm like Major or Keehn is great. If you like stem North, South, and Dunham are all closer to the science center. Dunham and South are very central. South is quads and 6-pulls only, but you get a private bathroom. It also doubles as an upperclassman dorm so there\u2019s a fair amount of parties. Dunham is great if you like to party and be social and has both doubles and quads. North has triples and doubles. I think Keehn and Major are double only but I\u2019m not 100%. \n\nDown the hill is Wertimer and Wally J. Those are a trek. Nice dorms but no thanks. \n\nI was a first-year in South this past year and being 10 feet from the main dining hall and 3min from the science center was amazing. Also private restrooms are a great thing (except you have to clean it).",

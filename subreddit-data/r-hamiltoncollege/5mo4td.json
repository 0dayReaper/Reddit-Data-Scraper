    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a high school senior who just applied to Hamilton a few days ago. I intend to major in computer science, and while the research I did definitely showed the academic strength of Hamilton overall, I wasn't able to find much regarding actual students talking about the program.\n\nIs anyone currently studying CS, or knows someone who is? I'd love to hear whatever you have to say, good or bad.\n\nThank you very much!",

            "comment": "Hi! I am not a current student, but I semi-recently graduated from Hamilton with a major in CS.\n\nFor me, the Hamilton CS program was great. I didn't come into the college planning to major in CS (I was initially biology/pre-med) but I took a CS class for fun early on and really loved it. After taking a few more classes I decided to major in it.\n\nThe CS department is relatively small, with only 4 professors during my time there. The downside of this is that while all the core classes are there, there probably aren't as many options for more specialized classes as what you might find at a more tech oriented college with a large CS department. But, this also made for a great community within the department. I felt the classes were high quality and I learned a lot through both the in class lectures and the assignments outside of class. The professors take the time to get to know all their students and are available in their offices outside of class if you ever need something. I've really only heard good things about the department from other students majoring in or just taking classes in CS.\n\nAnother big plus of the Hamilton CS department is its focus on having student teaching assistants as a resource. The department hires a number of students as CS TAs to help both during lab hours in many of the classes and to host TA hours every night where students can come and get help on their assignments. The TA hours are very popular and, even if you don't use it as a resource, if you get the chance to become a TA yourself it's a great learning opportunity getting to help teach other students.\n\nOne potential downside of going to a liberal arts college in general for CS is that there likely won't be any CS related career fairs directly at the college. This just means you will have to be more proactive when looking for internships and full-time positions. I got lucky in that I got to attend a conference outside of the college which included a great career fair, but I ended up getting my full-time job by applying online, so it's definitely possible. I don't see this as a big downside, just something to be aware of.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a liberal arts college with a strong CS program I highly recommend Hamilton. I can't compare with other colleges very well because I only went to Hamilton, but I really enjoyed my time there and learned a lot in CS, in the other courses I took, and the extracurriculars I participated in outside of the department. \n\nIf you have any specific questions, feel free to ask!\n\n",

Although I think they're actually getting another professor soon. \n\nIf you're not worried about not going to a technical school, then hamilton's a great place to study cs. \n\nPs ask about bacon explosion \n\nEdit: also worth noting, the professors themselves will tell you Hamilton has many other college (especially technical schools) beat when it comes to applying for grad school because they get to know the students very well. While this general at Hamilton, the cs department in particular is very close knit. They're able to write incredibly good and thorough recommendations. ",

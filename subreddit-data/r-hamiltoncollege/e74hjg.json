While the sport/greek parties definitely occur, they are typically at an open venue and have an inclusive atmosphere. if those types of people aren't your scene, the independent style of students definitely have suite parties and things of that nature. because of hamilton's social hosting policies, there are a handful of sites that groups can rent out to host events for a few hours and those are typically open to everyone.",

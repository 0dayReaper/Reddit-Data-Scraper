    "postText": "I am in the process of writing my Why Hamilton essay, and one thing that really intrigued me was the Great Names series. I looked on the website, but I couldn't find any information on the details of how the series works behind the scenes. Are students involved in deciding who to invite? Are there students who do things like pick the speaker up at the airport? I was thinking there might be a student organization called \"Great Names\" or something that coordinated all of that, but I couldn't find one.\n\nIf there is an opportunity for students to help organize these events, I'd like to do that, and I can write my essay about that. But if it's all handled by the administration and students are just invited to listen to the speaker speak, then it's probably not an interesting enough aspect of the college to write an essay about.",

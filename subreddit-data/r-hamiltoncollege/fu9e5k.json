I probably could have managed it if I knew what classes I needed before registering for freshman classes but I didn\u2019t have a plan till sophomore year. Different majors have different requirements though and some classes you need aren\u2019t offered each semester so you have to plan ahead.",

Should expect to have very limited free weekends in the spring, theres more flexibility in the fall. Women\u2019s team is nationally ranked and is a very tight knot team. Men\u2019s team is also very close, not as prestigious of a team (though they\u2019re still dedicated to the work). The two hang out but aren\u2019t super close. If you\u2019re okay with going less frequently (the team has a strict 24-48 hour rule) but are looking for a group of friendly hardworking people to hang out with, then the team could be a good fit.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t let the time intensive part scare you off. If your interested, give it a try. If you end up deciding you don\u2019t want to do crew later on, plenty of people switch around and try new sports. There\u2019s a bunch of club teams including canoe, sailing, soccer, frisbee, and rugby. A lot people don\u2019t play the sport they do until they get to Hamilton. I personally was gonna play squash but decided to join rugby instead.",

I\u2019m a very outdoorsy person who would like to spend a great deal of my free time doing outdoorsy things, but I\u2019m naturally good at rowing and have a lot of family pressure to do it. It\u2019s a tough decision, but thank you and your friend so much for this insight!",

I got a summer research position in the biology department simply by reaching out to a professor I was interested in working with. I'm still not sure how this will all work out because of the pandemic currently but maybe it will work out for next year.",

It requires foresight and planning more than anything else \n\n4) rowing team kids are alright, can be cult-y at times\n\n5) the glens are super cool and woodsy, this part Upstate NY is very rural/agrarian which might be more or less outdoorsy depending on how you feel about it.  Adks are a quick drive away, not sure how many/ if any school sponsored trips will be happening now though\n\nSorry for the late reply.  Hope your first semester starts off well!",

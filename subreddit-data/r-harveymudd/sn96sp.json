Is the bathroom just one toilet, one shower, and one sink, or is it larger?\n\nHow difficult is getting a single?\n\nHow difficult is getting a room in East dorm?\n\nIs there a form freshmen will fill out to determine their roommate and dorm?\n\nThank you for your time and help :)",

            "comment": "Most rooms are doubles, and yeah it\u2019s usually one toilet shower and one sink. All of this is assuming you aren\u2019t talking about a suite. It\u2019s very difficult to get a single as a freshman unless you have extenuating circumstances. It is not that difficult to get a room in east dorm. Yes there is a form freshmen fill out to determine roommate and dorm.",

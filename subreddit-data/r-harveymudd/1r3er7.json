    "postText": "Hey all, a bunch of alumni up in Redwood city have been working on a game we just released on kickstarter. [Rumrunners](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/palominolabs/rumrunners) is a digital board game (i.e. you use a smartphone, but it's not a words with friends or car racing or shooting people in the face sort of thing).\u2002 The general idea is similar to [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29), [Werewolf](http://www.brenbarn.net/werewolf/rules.html), and [The Resistance](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/the-resistance), but while it shares mechanics with those games, we've designed a wholly different game, taking advantage of the fact that it's played on a smartphone.\n\nBeing a digital board game allows us to do things that would be difficult in the real world, like a special ability to secretly alter another player's votes.\u2002 The digital nature of the game also automates the frustrating &amp; error-prone parts of physical games.\n\nWe've got a [print-and-play](http://www.rumrunnersgame.com/print_and_play_1.72.zip) version that you can play, but remember its only an prototype of what we're going to build. We're also running a playtest at Mudd this weekend, so we're hoping a bunch of you show up for that.\n\n",

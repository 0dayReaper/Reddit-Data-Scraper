Certainly there are some of them that have a particular opinion about Mudders and choose to only look south for romantic endeavors, while others may be attracted to the more stereotypically nerdy type found on the other side of Platt Blvd.  Parties are a great way to meet people outside your normal social circle.\n\nMyself, as a man who attended Mudd, I found that there was an abundance of amazing, beautiful, and super intelligent women right there on campus, so I didn\u2019t need to go far.",

I did get annoyed with the backhanded compliment, \u201cOh you don\u2019t seem like a Mudder!\u201d\n\nIt will likely be the best/easiest time in your adult like to meet new and different people!",

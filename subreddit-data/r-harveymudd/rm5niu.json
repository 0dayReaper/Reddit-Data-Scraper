    "postText": "Hey guys I was wondering if there was any reason why such an established university like Harvey Mudd does not seem to have any UROP exchange/SURF programs besides the CS program? I know the university receives a lot of NSF funding so I thought there might be a lot of exchange research programs that might be offered during the summer like with other universities in California. \n\nIf anyone else knows about some research programs at Harvey Mudd or affiliated with them that could be worthwhile for an exchange feel free to reach out!",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a 19-year-old from Singapore and I applied to Mudd last year for engineering (got rejected) but since then, I have started taking a deeper interest in coding. I still have no real experience or expertise in coding languages because I spend most of my time in the army (serving my conscription atm) but I want to know if HMC's Comp Sci major starts from scratch or if it requires prior knowledge and expertise in coding languages. Looking for any help in making my decision to send out another application this year! thanks",

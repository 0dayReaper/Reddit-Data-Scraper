Baldy \\~ 20 minutes away and the view is much better up there (just have to find an upperclassman/friends to drive but this was always easy since it's a popular thing to do). If you wanna go all out, Joshua Tree National Park has an INCREDIBLE sky at night. The park is \\~90 min away but again you'd be surprised at how easy it is to get mudders to abandon their work and go do something fun with friends (or  at least that was my friend circle/dorm).",

If the Astronomy Club is still alive, get in touch with them, and you guys can easily plan trips to J-Tree, Mohave desert, or Death Valley (as we did fairly recently). Death Valley has one of the darkest skies in CA, in spite of Vegas being nearby.",

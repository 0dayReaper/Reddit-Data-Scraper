CS 140 homework felt like doing hard coding challenges each week. You didn\u2019t actually code them but figuring out the algorithm is the main challenge for interviews. CS 70 helps but I\u2019d expect you to struggle on many mediums and most hards if you stopped at 70 and didn\u2019t do 140. Basic graph algorithms like shortest path/topological sort are mainly covered in 140 (graph theory isn\u2019t that relevant which is 55).\n\nDP, divide and conquer, and graphs are all common areas for medium/hard problems and all 3 are things you won\u2019t have much algorithm experience without unless you do 140.",

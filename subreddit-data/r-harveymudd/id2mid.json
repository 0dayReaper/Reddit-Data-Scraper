On the other hand, I've spent 2 year on this project, and have put blood, sweat, and tears into working on it, all literally (scalpels are sharp and superglue sticks really well), and while it's not directly related to what I want to study, I think it shows my passion and interest, and general working on writing scientific papers and working with R that might look good? I don't know what do y'all think?",

It's not going to be read by professors to critique your methods; it will be read by an admissions committee and it will show your dedication and experience!",

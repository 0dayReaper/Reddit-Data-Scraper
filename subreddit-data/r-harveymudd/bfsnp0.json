    "postText": " I'm a high school senior deciding between Mudd, Johns Hopkins, and CMU, and the basis for my decision strongly rests in potential for undergraduate research. However, I feel like I have a limited perspective on what that actually looks like in practice. Can anybody share their personal experiences or insights with undergraduate research (particularly STEM oriented)? If anybody is willing to share their experience some helpful details would be:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Your major/field of interest\n\n\\- The topic and details of the research you were involved in\n\n\\- To what extent were you actually able to contribute (i.e. what did you do/what was your role)\n\n\\- Any experience publishing\n\n\\- How did you get the opportunity and how easy was it to do so\n\n\\- Any other takeaways from your experience\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I just graduated in 2018 as a physics major. I spent two years working in an engineering lab on MEMS and nanofabrication tech. The first year, I was the only student in the lab and spent my time developing tools for nanofabrication - I was designing components, machining them, designing the electronics, and programming the controller. The next year, I used the systems we had developed to work on a MEMS project - using common nanolithography techniques and chemistry. I was the lead on the project, so even though it didn't pan out I got a lot of experience doing all parts of research - lit review, designing experiments, working in a lab, analyzing results. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty sure if I had gone anywhere else, I would never have had such a great opportunity. In addition to just getting research on my resume, I got experience actually leading the research, which was invaluable to making the decision to go to grad school.",

Mudd's mission is to teach/create/graduate well-rounded scientists and engineers, so excluding or underweighting people with a broader HS and extracurricular background would seem contrary to that goal.\n\nIt's a common app now, isn't it? Apply if it seems like a good fit for you.",

So I think showing interests in both even if it\u2019s more towards humanities activities (but getting good grades in stem subjects) might make you stand out.",

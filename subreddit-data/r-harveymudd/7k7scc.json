    "postText": "Thanks in advance for answers. I will be visiting LA soon, and have a few questions. Is HMC worth visiting? (Will my perception of the school change? Will I want to go more? Am I more likely to be admitted?) If so, what should I see? I am interested in Robotics, MechE, and Physics. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Well, school's out until mid January. The main reason you'd want to come to visit HMC is to get a first hand look at the culture, which will be impossible for the next four weeks. So if you're leaving LA within the next four weeks, I'd skip a visit. Consider talking to current students (like myself) about experiences at HMC if you want to get a sense of that culture. ",

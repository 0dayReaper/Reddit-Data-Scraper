    "postText": "TL;DR - join us here (https://discordapp.com/invite/jpYFF3T) for a series of \"virtual visiting days\" to replace spring college visits, and fill out a form (https://forms.gle/2ZtHUhjAgtZ5MrNj9) if you'd be willing to help out as a channel mod for Harvey Mudd\n\nHi friends, I'll keep this short and sweet -- I graduated from Williams in 2018 and know a number of current high school seniors who are in a tough spot for a huge decision. There is a real need for prefrosh to connect virtually with current students, recent alums, and each other given that COVID-19 is leading to colleges shutting down their visiting days across the nation (Unfortunately, Virtual Visiting Days is currently only operating for U.S. colleges). We have students/alums from quite a few colleges (~50) at the moment on the server and hope to expand in the following days. We currently have NO Harvey Mudd representatives, so would really really appreciate it if some of you would consider helping out. Details below:\n\nThe event will take place on Discord on the weekends of April 18 and 25, essentially in the form of text and audio threads for each school. There will be opportunity to connect individually as well via direct message, but that's on a more ad hoc basis. The commitment for channel mods would be verifying that newcomers to your channel are actually connected to Harvey Mudd, either prefrosh (checking that they have an admissions letter), current students (active .edu email or student ID), or alums (Linkedin or alumni.edu email) ! You can get involved by clicking on the form link above and messaging one of the mods on discord, me (jersey454) or starfleet_rambo. We will automatically assign the first person from each school in the channel as interim mod, but we\u2019ll change that as soon as a real mod volunteers. The discord is currently active, so join us there even if you\u2019re not interested in being a mod!",

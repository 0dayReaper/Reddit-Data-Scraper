    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am an applicant to HMC ED II because I love the school so much and I did not know about it before (international student relying too much on rankings). However, I have the problem that I was not that interested in language and arts until my senior year so I don't have activities related to that while I have a bunch of others related to sciences and especially mathematics. Therefore, I don't have any way to show my starting love for language and arts, and I am scared that HMC will reject me solely because I can't demonstrate this love. I am particularly fond of history, philosophy, and TOK, because  I love the deep thinking and analysis and the connection to our lives. My transcripts can show this because there is a trending increase. On the other side, my language subjects are awful, just passing, and this is because the teachers grade really really harsh (half of the class do no pass). Therefore, any chances for me? And has anyone entered HMC without doing activities that show their love for humanistic subjects? Thank you so much in advance!!!",

But yeah, I will definitely write about my love of humanities in the essays. Thank you so much!!",

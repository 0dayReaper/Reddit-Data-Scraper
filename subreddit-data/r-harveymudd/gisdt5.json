I\u2019ve never visited and I don\u2019t know many students at the school, so could anyone elaborate on what exactly people mean when they say Mudd is for certain people? Like what kinds of people would fit the school and why? I\u2019m trying to decide whether or not HMC is for me (just got off the waitlist).",

            "comment": "I think Mudd has really taken on a very supportive atmosphere as of right now (rising senior). There's definitely people with really unique interests and people work hard for sure but there's honestly a bit for everyone in terms of culture at the Claremont Colleges through 5C parties and clubs. I run a club on campus and definitely spend a lot of time hanging out with people from Mudd and the other campuses. There's definitely communities for a lot of different things that have sprung up over the last 3 years I've been here.\n\nTag yourself, I'm \"spend hours each night playing beer pong\"",

For instance, you don't have to have a three-dimensional chess board, but if you meet somebody with one you may want to play a game.  3D chess may not be for you. You may want to try out the unicycle club or the ultimate frisbee team. Or spend hours each night playing beer pong.  \n\n\nYou'll have lots of opportunities at your fingertips, and you can experience as much or as little as you want.",

            "comment": "My general take on it is that students are bright, hard-working, and passionate. The culture is for the most part built around this, so courses will push you hard, but there's also plenty of support. Some people like this \"busier\" type of environment, while others might prefer a lighter courseload to have more time to focus on extracurriculars or personal projects.\n\nEven having had a good few years to reflect on it, I still agree that Mudd is for certain people: those who are driven to get a good STEM education, and who are hard-working enough to buckle down and get things done. Beyond that, I found nearly every kind of interest among students, and lots of personalities. You've been admitted, so you are bright enough to make it at Mudd. But Mudders generally take on extracurriculars, which can make the workload crazy at times. If that's the kind of place you see yourself, then I'd seriously consider accepting. Otherwise, there is a better fit, and that's okay too.",

There is a rigorous technical core, as opposed to other schools whose core curriculum is more humanities-heavy. I also find that it's a bit more close-knit than the other schools. Two examples are dorm cultures, and the observation that HMC students tend to show up for reunions more than most other claremont schools. \n\nWhether it is better for you or not is a question of your personal interests; it cannot be answered in a vacuum.",

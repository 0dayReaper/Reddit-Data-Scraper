She is a CMS athlete, passed all her first semester pass/high pass/no credit classes with one high pass, is applying to be a mentor for her dorm next year so must not feel stretched too thin yet, and is having the time of her life. She says everyone is doing homework/studying so it\u2019s not like you are missing out while everyone else is having fun. She doesn\u2019t party during the week and will try to grab a chance for an early night or a quick nap when they present themselves. She was already used to managing her time with her heavy training schedule through high school. I think she and her friends are working hard AND having an absolute blast.",

            "comment": "You can definitely use electives to wind up knowing all the stuff in most MechE majors. I went to grad school with a bunch of MechE majors and felt like we knew all the same stuff. All Mudd engineering majors are required to learn thermo, controls, solid mechanics, and materials. You just add in fluids and that's most of the typical MechE major core.  Add your favorites from dynamics, vibrations, and microPs/mechatronics, and you can even wind up with the equivalent of a pretty specialized MechE degree.",

If I recall correctly, I think you need around 3 electives, and I'd say just fluids (1 out of three required electives) gets you to a decent MechE major.  So that leaves you two more required electives to subspecialize. And many people are able to fit in a few classes beyond the required credit count, though you won't know if that's the case until you've had a few years to see how you're taking to the rigors of Mudd.\n\nAnd honestly a HUGE fraction of people wind up studying not quite what they thought they might want to study as high schoolers, and the beauty of the general engineering major is you can use electives to build a program that doesn't fit nicely into the boxes at other schools (ME, EE, CivE, etc). You could decide to be a MechE that wants to work on robots, and take a few EE or CS courses instead of ever taking fluids, for instance. But if you do in fact decide to try and build a \"traditional\" ME major, Mudd can get you pretty close.",

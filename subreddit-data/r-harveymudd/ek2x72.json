CS is your *main* interest, but you'd like to do some classes in business as well.\n\nIn which case, this sounds like a great idea! Ask admissions if they could put you in contact with someone who's done business classes off campus. It's incredibly easy to take classes off campus. You just sign up for it and you're in. I took 2 years of Japanese at Pomona like that.",

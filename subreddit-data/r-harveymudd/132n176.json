    "postText": "Hi, my top choices for college are currently the Turing Scholars Program at UT Austin ([https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars)), and HMC. I am planning to study CS, and I'm also very interested in AI/ML. Also might wanna get involved with a tech startup some time.\n\nI really felt that I clicked Mudd's culture (lots of fun traditions, and an overall free-spirited vibe) after visiting during ASP, and I also really enjoyed the weather and food. I'm a cs person, but I love being around people passionate about STEM.\n\nI feel I am leaning towards Mudd, but have a few reservations:\n\n\\-not having access to undergrad research early on, esp AI research  \n\\-workload too much and preventing me from having time for fun  \n\\-not being able to take the classes I want for cs due to prerequisites/limited slots  \n\\-im pretty extroverted, so im wondering if people tend to be pretty introverted at a school like mudd  \n\\-limited startup scene  \n\\-wont be able to get cs internships as a freshman or even as a sophomore  \n\\-im bad at time management and i might fall behind and have a shit gpa which exacerbate my last point",

            "comment": "Point by point,\n\n- A lot of frosh do CS research over their first summer. It's not *guaranteed* but you probably can if you want to.\n- the workload is heavy, but there's still time for fun. Does require some time-management though.\n- Just about everywhere has problems that CS is becoming more popular faster than they can hire new profs. As a Mudd CS major, you have priority for Mudd CS classes. I found this wasn't really a problem.\n- There are plenty of extroverts, as well as plenty of introverts. Plus those sorts of things aren't nearly as set-in-stone as you think.\n- Can't really speak to this, as it wasn't something I was interested in. But there are resources for entrepreneurship and Mudders that found startups. Plus the Alumni network in CS is pretty good. Surprisingly so for how small Mudd is.\n- Plenty of people get CS internships frosh/soph years. I did both years. For frosh year it helps to have HS CS experience but by soph year that's not necessary. If you can't get an internship, you can probably get summer CS research.\n- This is hard, but there are plenty of resources to help you succeed. Working with friends helps a lot.",

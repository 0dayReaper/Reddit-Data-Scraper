            "comment": "I graduated in Math/CS in 2012.\n\nMudd is difficult in the sense that professors generally push you hard. The workload is significant, but there is ample help through office hours and tutors. The material is sometimes hard to grasp but professors usually explain topics well enough that it wasn't a huge problem for me.\n\nIn terms of whether CS or Math/CS is harder, that depends on what your strengths are. It's true that Math/CS is more theoretical, but overall CS at Mudd leans quite theoretical, since they have few systems profs (and a whole lot of PLs profs). Good proof writing, clearly-explained reasoning, and disciplined programming style will be core concepts that you are expected to build throughout your time at Mudd.\n\nDon't study over the summer. You will learn what you need to when you get here. Mudders tend to do a lot over their summers, so you may want to consider simply enjoying your last summer of relatively few commitments.\n\nMudders tend to have ample time for extracurriculars. I know of very few students who went all the way through without taking part in extracurriculars, and in fact, I would go as far as to argue that the stereotype of always-busy Mudders stems more from taking on too many extracurriculars than on too many classes. It is a rather strong part of the culture, as the community is still largely student-governed. Personally, I did a great deal of music while I was there (8-10 hours a week). There are also many social activities going on around campus and at the other Claremont Colleges.\n\nMudd's financial aid is comparatively quite good, but it is still one of the most expensive colleges in the country. If you applied for financial aid, you should get a separate letter soon with a financial aid offer, and you can discuss this with them either remotely or in person during a visit to campus.\n\nHopefully that helps - PM or respond if you have any other questions!",

Many employers (those that show up at career fairs) know this, and if you're going into industry your GPA doesn't really matter anyways.  It matters more for grad schools, but Mudd sends a letter with your transcript explaining about the lack of grade inflation and some grad schools know Mudd.",

                                            "comment": "&gt; do students have time to play sports?\n\nYes.  Classes do take up a lot of time, but not so much that you can't do anything else.  Having time for things is more a matter of deciding what to prioritize, and if sports are important to you that's definitely an option.  Personally, I've completed in intermural Inner-tube Water Polo most semesters I've been at Mudd, and did Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee my frosh year.\n\n&gt; Does Mudd have soccer\n\nYes.  There is intermural soccer most semesters and several soccer PE classes (I took one frosh year and liked it).  There is probably soccer at a higher level than that (club / team) but I don't know because I've never looked into it.  I can check if it's important to you.\n\n&gt; What are some typical extracurriculars for a Mudd student\n\nWell, I can't really speak for typical, but here is what I do (in no particular order).  I don't think I'm _too_ atypical... :)\n\n1. DUCK: this is Harvey Mudd's improv group.  We practice for two hours once a week on Sundays and also put on shows every month or so on average.  I'm not as active in this as I used to be, but I'm trying to get back into it because I enjoy it (I stopped going because I was in a relationship that took up a lot of my time).  I've been to three of the last four meetings.\n2. Clarinet: I'm taking clarinet lessons through Pomona music.  In some past semesters I've done chamber music or been in the orchestra, but this semester I'm just doing lessons.  I've had time to do something clarinet-related every semester I've been here.  Technically this isn't extracurricular because I am taking classes and get credit, but it feels like it should count.\n3. Choir: I'm in the Scripps choir and have been every semester since my sophomore year.  Also technically not extracurricular.\n4. HvZ: once a semester there is a campus-wide game of humans versus zombies.  It's only a week per semester, but it's a ton of fun.\n5. ITR Games: this is a game where we run around the tunnels of the Libra Complex after midnight playing tag-based vaguely-roleplaying games and dueling with duct-tape \"daggers.\"  I ran this my sophomore and junior years, and now that I've handed it off still try to go to them.  If you come to ASP (which I highly recommend) definitely come to ITR Games.\n6. Hiking: recently I've been going on a lot of the hiking trips run by Adventure Club.  They're a lot of fun.\n7. Effective Altruism club: we meet every Sunday to discuss the most effective ways to make the world a better place and what that actually means.  I've been coming to a lot of the meetings recently, and I feel like I always come out of it having learned something interesting.\n8. 5c menu and course scheduler: I maintain a couple of websites, menu.yancey.io and scheduler.yancey.io, which are useful for people at the 5Cs.  The sites are relatively stable now so they don't take as much time as they used to, but sophomore year I put in several hours per week on them.  There's a really great CS elective \"programming practicum\" that is basically just spend four hours per week on your own CS-related projects and document your work for one credit, which I've taken a couple of times to work on my web-apps.  \n\nThere are probably things I'm forgetting.  Plus I spend a bunch of time just hanging around East (my dorm) having interesting conversations or just watching whatever random crap someone's showing in the lounge.  The point being, there is definitely time to do things other than work and there are plenty of cool things to do; you just need to decide what's important to you and focus on that.  ",

There's weekly study sessions hosted by upperclassmen for all of the core classes, so you shouldn't have any trouble getting help if you find yourself struggling -- you just have to reach out for it. \n\nI think which major is harder depends on what your interests are. CS/math is a lot more theoretical. If you like the theory stuff, then you should go for it! If you don't, then pure CS is probably better. Either way, you won't have to decide your major for a while so you have plenty of time to talk to upperclassmen about their experiences before deciding. \n\nI have more free time than I expected! Some weeks it really is just work all the time, but usually I have a couple of hours to myself each day. I think this is generally the case -- there's a lot of thriving Mudd clubs, and the parties are always packed. \n\nThe financial aid office is very generous with need-based aid. I'm not sure how their merit-based aid works because I didn't apply for it. \n\nI hope that helped. If you have any more questions, feel free to send me a message! ",

I think functional programming is taught in other classes as well, but it's not something that you would find a whole class on (any more than you would have a class specifically on object-oriented programming). \n\nI did a little searching, and I don't think there's currently a cryptography class offered at HMC. However, there have been in the past, so if it's a hobby-level interest you shouldn't judge the CS program just based on that. If you want to actually go into crypto professionally though, then Mudd probably isn't your best bet. On the other hand, there could be classes that cover it but don't advertise that they do. It might be worth it to email the CS department head and ask. \n\nHere's a list of the current CS offerings (there's also more information about the CS and CS/math majors on the same site): https://www.cs.hmc.edu/program/course-descriptions/\n\nEdit: Never mind, the guy above me knows what he's talking about.

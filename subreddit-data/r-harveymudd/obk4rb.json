If you fail to distinguish yourself somehow, I'm sure you'll blend in with everyone else.   \n\n\nIf you do go, buy a box of 32 lb. card stock to print your resume on so that everything about you is memorable, right down to your resume. It is also easier to pick out in a pile. Ask others to review your resume (eliding GPA, of course) beforehand. Practice a pitch, something to the effect of, \"Good afternoon, I'm Lem. It's nice to meet you. I'm interested in a full-time position on the intelligent systems team. Can I tell you about what I did last summer that I believe is related to some of your ongoing projects?\" Do that correctly, and the person you're speaking with will recognize you as a high-value mark before you've even finished shaking hands. If your resume goes in a special box, you'll know you've done well.",

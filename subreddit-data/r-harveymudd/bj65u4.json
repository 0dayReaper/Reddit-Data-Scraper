Use that to your advantage - bond with your classmates and professors, and try not to let it crush you. But also - give yourself some slack. It is totally okay not to get everything, to need help, to be having a harder time than your peers. Your self-worth comes from so much more than your academic performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave fun. Go to parties if that's your thing, don't if it's not. Remember that mudd is a small school, and while people are generally fun, forgiving, and interesting, if you make a bad mistake you will see these people around for the next four years. Try to get out to LA or to the mountains/nature as much as you can, schedule time away from homework if you have to. Enjoying these off-campus activities does a lot for your sanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are female, nonbinary, a person of color, or have another marginalized identity that is important to you, try and find solidarity with others like you. The rigors of mudd can be worse for those of us outside \"the norm\". A lot of campus activism has happened over the past few years by these students so I hope things are better than when I attended. Be prepared to deal with the shit the world gives you, but in many ways I also found mudd to be more supportive of me than other places, so your mileage may vary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake care of your health, and if you have existing mental health conditions or another chronic health condition make sure you have it managed now, before you start. Access to MH services especially can be slow on campus. Don't feel ashamed to need something different than in the past, or to ask for some assistance. Mudd can do a number on you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI loved my time at mudd but continue to feel very conflicted about some of the effects its specific system had on myself and my friends. You will live in a contradiction the next four years - enjoy the good moments (there will be a lot of them!) and do your best to weather the bad with people you care about. If you were accepted, you deserve to be there. Good luck!",

Honestly, I mostly loved that mudd is small, because you get to build up both causal and strong relationships over four years (and even after!). Having a good sense of humor about the inevitable awkward situations is really valuable. \n\nThat said, I was an embarrassing and stupid frosh, and had a handful of relationships end poorly/awkwardly, and I just had to deal with seeing those folks around for the rest of my time. It was fine, but I learned quickly (not quickly enough) about the consequences of my actions. I don't really have advice about this besides not being an idiot (even though I also learned a lot from being an idiot, and also mistakes are inevitable and kinda fun sometimes). Find some friends who will be there for you through all of it - in my experience, this isn't very hard to do.",

When it comes to HSA classes, don\u2019t be discouraged from taking some classes with your friends, even if they aren\u2019t your top choice. Some of my favorite classes were the film/reading/discussion based classes I took with my friends, because we could take those discussions outside of the classroom and learn more about the material and each other. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to have study partners.",

Take your classes seriously, and your mental health more seriously. I half assed my way through my first 2 years (for a variety of reasons, both from mental health and general idiocy) which was a huge mistake. Luckily I salvaged myself.\n\nOn the flipside, try new things. Meet as many new people as you can. Break out of your comfort zone. Go to parties. Do drugs (within reason). edit: also, take a step back from time to time, and evaluate your behavior. When parents aren't around, the only person keeping you in check is *you* and you need to learn how to do this at some point if you want to live a fruitful life. \n\nOn the subject of HSAs - take things that are interesting, not things that are easy As. They're much more rewarding, fun, and imo, subjectively easier, since you're more motivated to work for them. I took like 5-6 writing-intensives (you'll learn what that is, but basically it means there's a fair amount of writing).",

But also, take the time to consider your own personal boundaries, whether that relates to drinking, drugs, personal relationships, whatever. You will be faced with choices, and it\u2019s better to have thought about them before making an in-the-moment decision you might regret. I was a very suggestible freshman, and I don\u2019t have any huge regrets, but I did make some questionable choices from time to time.",

For a lot of people this is the first time being away from parental figures for an extended period of time, and the only person keeping that person in check is themselves. Self-reflection is important. I made a lot of dumb decisions but learned something from them - meanwhile I have friends who've long graduated but still haven't learned how to self-moderate. And I'm not talking about in the partying/drug sense. Oddly, the people I know who did the most drugs at Mudd (who survived and graduated) are the most in-touch with themselves of people I know.",

            "comment": "My husband double-majored and overloaded every term and even audited more courses on top of that to get around the credit cap, but he always says that in retrospect he wishes that he had done fewer classes but taken more time on them to get more out of them. Projects are really important, both to learn and for your future opportunities, so try to get research or internship opportunities during the summers.\n\nI think it's really important when doing homework in groups to be able to self-reflect at the end and consider whether you actually understand it now or if you just got to the answer with helps from your friends and if you did a similar problem by yourself right now you still wouldn't know how to do it. It's important for the learning process to work with others (and more fun too!), but it's also important that you try the problems on your own first and are honest with yourself about whether you understand them or not. And if not, don't be shy to approach the professors and ask for help during office hours. For example I got weekly 1-on-1 extra practice with Professor Sparks during E&amp;M, and it really helped. Access to the professors, and professors who care about helping their undergraduate students learn,  is one of Mudd's strengths, so take advantage of it.\n\nLastly, I think it's important to prioritize sleep. You can't learn things if you're not sleeping enough. It can be hard to do because there's so much fun stuff going on and you'll be really busy, but I wish that I had taken better care of my health while there.",

You don't have to work nonstop, but you better work as hard as the average if you want average grades (C's).\n\n- Max out your credits as a sophomore/junior, but not as a freshman or senior. Use the senior year to get ready for industry or get ready for grad school. \n\n- HMC will not attempt to prepare you for industry. Focus more on internships than work-study. Work-study jobs, even over the summer, do not really prepare you for industry.",

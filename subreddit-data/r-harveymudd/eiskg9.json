    "postText": "Prospective HMC student here!\n\nI've been doing research online about hmc and it's looking like one of my top choice schools to apply (I'm a Junior in HS rn). I also found some information on a \"clinic\" programme which gives you hands-on experience that looks great, but I can't find any further information as everything is locked on the hmc website \ud83d\ude05.\n\nDoes everyone get an opportunity to be a part of the clinic programme or do you have to apply and get selected? And I've heard its a mix of first-years to senior students, so is there a limit to the number of years you can be a part of the programme or free for all?\n\nThanks for the help! :)",

I spent my time working for Raytheon on a couple different methods of calibrating Earth-imaging satellites.\n\nWhich involved sitting in a beach chair all day as the sun passed overhead and measuring the intensity of light with a photometer so that we could calculate how much of the light would be absorbed at different inclinations.\n\nThat part was so relaxing I even took it on vacation with me so I could have an excuse to sit still on the beach all day.",

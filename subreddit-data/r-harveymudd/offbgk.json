My high school didn\u2019t have homecomings and I missed out on hs prom senior year due to covid and I really want to make up for that lost experience lol\n\nWhat will the party scene look like next semester? Will there be social distancing guidelines? I heard we can\u2019t eat at other schools\u2019 dining halls but can we go to other schools\u2019 parties?",

We spent days curating a playlist and at the time it was really just a Case Dorm party. \n\nWhat is it like now? Is it a 5C party?",

They can't make it 5C cause it already gets almost dangerously crowded in Case courtyard as is. Definitely one of the most popular parties.",

Think Bohemian Rhapsody and Piano Man  and other karaoke standards.\n\nWe'd play the playlist, have a bunch of drinks, play beer pong, and \"Sing Along\" to the music.",

Yule Ball at Pomona and Wedding Party at CMC are kind of formal/prom-ish, people dress up and sometimes bring dates.\n\nI haven't heard yet how the consortium plans to navigate parties this year. They might be a little less enthusiastic about having the student governments fund big events, but I can't see them forbidding people from attending things on other campuses (or succeeding if they tried).",

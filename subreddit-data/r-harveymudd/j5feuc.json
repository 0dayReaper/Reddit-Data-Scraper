                    "comment": "I want to second this. Mudd students can take classes from any of the Claremonts. This significantly widens your options, because Mudd has limited music-related classes. I know that Pomona has a Jazz ensemble and a course called History of Jazz. Additionally, this Scripps website (https://www.scrippscollege.edu/departments/music) has info about their music program. \n\nHere is a list of HSA classes that are associated with Mudd, you can scroll down to find the Music section. Unfortunately the Jazz Improvisation class was taught by the recently passed Professor Keller: https://www.hmc.edu/hsa/hsa-course-descriptions/. This is not an exhaustive list of classes available to Mudd students because it does not include Pomona classes (which you can take). I would recommend searching the course catalogs of all the Claremonts to get a better idea of your options. \n\nAnother great resource at Mudd is the ability to take free (well, the cost of tuition) private lessons through Pomona college. They will even loan you an instrument if necessary. Depending on your instrument, you may be able to find someone to work with you on improvisation through the lesson program. \n\nOne of the cool profs who teaches interesting music classes is William Alves. You can find info about his work and the classes he teaches here: https://www.hmc.edu/hsa/faculty-staff/william-alves/. \nI hope this helps you answer your question, it\u2019s great to see people interested in the HSA component of Mudd!",

But some things I'd check- \n\nProf Keller's into jazz and looks like he's working on improv software https://www.cs.hmc.edu/people/Keller\nAt one point he had an improv class. http://catalog.hmc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=1&amp;coid=343  Hard to say how often that would be offered, but if you're interested I'd go talk to him about it.\n\nProf Alves is one music prof on campus. https://www.hmc.edu/hsa/faculty-staff/william-alves/\n\nI'm not sure if there are other profs in Humanities &amp; Social Sciences specilaizing in music.\n\nAnd you've got all the other colleges where you can take classes.\n\nhttp://www.jointmusicprogram.org/\n\nedits:  looks like there's still a jazz ensemble mentioned on https://www.hmc.edu/campus-life/student-organizations/\n\nAnd I suspect you could take off-campus music classes outside of the joint music program, but you'd want to inquire directly",

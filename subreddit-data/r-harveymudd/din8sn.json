    "postText": "Hopeful international CS applicant here! Ever since finding out about HMC, I just loved it. Small school size, undergrad emphasis, HSA policy, Claremont... But as an international, I almost certainly know that if accepted, I would be paying full price - no financial aid. My financial situation is good enough to just barely scrape by all 4 years of fees if I get a part-time job but I'm uncertain if I should invest so much. Because of the \"barely scraping by\" thing, I'm leaning towards UCB on the financial aspect. I know HMC's ROI is one of the highest in the country - is that actually true? (@ alumnis) I just don't want to be in a spot where I'll be suffering financially when all the money I put in doesn't pay off well.",

            "comment": "Glad you like the school! :) Working part time is more doable in certain semesters than others. I worked part time as a grader and tutor at Mudd. It wasn't always easy, but I recommend that path as you work right on campus. Certain jobs (front desk at the Mudd gym, etc.) don't always require constant attention either, so you can do your homework in the downtime.\n\nAs for ROI, I'm not quite familiar with all the data that goes into that number, but here's what I do know. It depends on what you want to do. Most engineers who graduate to a job earn between $70-$80k. Most computer science majors who go to big 5 companies earn well into the lower 6 figures, as in $110-$150k range, with huge signing and relocation bonuses.\n\nThat's not to say that engineers can't \"catch up\" in salary later in their careers, usually after grad school in engineering, nor is it to say that pay should be your only focus when deciding on a career path.",

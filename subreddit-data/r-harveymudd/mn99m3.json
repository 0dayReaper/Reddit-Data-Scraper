I called the office of financial aid and spoke with the people there, they were able to make it work out for me. I'm a little hazy on the details, there was some increase in loans, but also they found some scholarships under the couch cushions that I qualified for.",

I don\u2019t have parents and would have no plan b to go back home to after college if broke. I do believe seattle pacific can give me good education and i can stand out as a good student there versus harvey where i think i will always be behind the other kids.",

It's best to save as much money as you can during these 4 years than pay hundreds of thousands of dollars. Have you tried negotiating your financial aid package yet, though? I've heard a lot of success from current students in the c/o 2025 Discord.",

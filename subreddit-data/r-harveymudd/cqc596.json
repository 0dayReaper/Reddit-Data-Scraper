            "comment": "Well, Mudd is a really good school for CS/Math, but I'm sure you already knew that. There's quite a few tutoring positions available through the CS department, if you're interested in that kind of work experience.\n\nAs for soccer and entrepreneurship, depending on what you're asking for, you'd probably have to look at one of the other Claremont Colleges for courses or activities, but it's very easy to sign up at another campus. The real limiting factor is whether or not you have the time and energy to go and do that, after a 50 hour work week, rounding down.",

I'm actually doing a double major in CS and Economics (through CMC) at the moment and while it is a challenge to plan courses and manage the work, it's definitely possible. There's also a bunch of 5C groups focused on entrepreneurship and business in general that you can be a part of if you go to the Claremont Colleges. PM me if you had any other questions!",

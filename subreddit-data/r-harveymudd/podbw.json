However if a customer you are assigned to is having problems or has a lot of questions the expectation is that you do whatever you need to do to help the customer out and answer their questions. The key there is to remember that employees at Epic are very helpful and friendly so help is always available.\n\nAs a new technical services person you would be assigned to a particular Epic application such as our scheduling system or our medical records system. The expectation is that you would stay in that role with that application for at least a year and a half. However it is definitely possible to move to a different application team particularly if the need on the team you are moving to is great. Movement between roles (e.g. technical service to developer or quality assurance tester to technical services) are not impossible, but are much rarer. \n\nThere are also possibilities for leadership roles as a technical services person after just a few years at Epic. For example there are folks who coordinate the efforts of all the technical service people assigned to a particular customer, folks who are team leads for small groups of other technical services people, and technical services folks that have a particular area of expertise, such as upgrades or getting customers to use new functionality.",

Message me if you would like more info about the city.  \n\nFor the record, before deciding to go to grad school, I did a phone interview with Epic (I decided not to pursue it further).  I don't know anyone who actually works there.  It seems like a pretty cool company - from the outside, it looks like they treat their employees well.  But from what I remember, it doesn't seem like a terribly challenging environment (especially for a Mudder.  You may not realize it yet, but having graduated from Mudd puts you in the top few percent of technical people).  You're more likely to end up doing customer service and documentation.  ",

    "postText": "hi everyone, I'm in a little predicament here and i need some advice. I'm a high school senior in oregon and I got into both oregon state university and harvey mudd college. I'm majoring in computer science.\n\nosu would cost about 20k/year after scholarships and grants, while harvey mudd is about 35k/year. I'm planning to ask for more aid from Mudd though. my parents will not help pay for my tuition if I decide to go to Mudd, but theyll help with OSU if I choose to go.\n\nharvey mudd has the highest avg starting salary in the US at about 90k/year, which makes me think that the 35k a year might be worth it. but going to OSU would mean a lot more stability, since I am pretty much guaranteed a job at Intel because of my father. Mudd is near a lot of good tech companies though, so I'm saying the risks and rewards are both higher.\n\nif they were the same price I would definitely choose harvey mudd, but I dont know if the 15k increase is really worth it. \n\nany insight or advice or your own experiences would be greatly appreciated! thank you.",

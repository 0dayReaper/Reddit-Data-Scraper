Note that students don\u2019t commit to a specific major when coming to Mudd, and you don\u2019t have to declare a major until the 2nd half of sophomore year (also freshman are not allowed to declare majors). There are no barriers like GPA requirements when declaring/switching, you just have to declare it through a form and you automatically get assigned an advisor. If anything, it may be much harder to get into certain classes unless you declare, such as for many upper level CS classes which require you to have some variation of a CS major (CS, CS/Math, MathCompBio).",

            "comment": "Depends on what major to what major, as well as what stage you're at. The more requirements a major has, the more difficult it is to swap to it.\n\nYou're pretty much free to do whatever until fall semester of sophomore year, after which you probably want to specialize. Past that, it depends on the major. I've not heard a single successful case of swapping into engineering from anything, but plenty of students swap out of engineering, most commonly to CS. This can be done as late as fall semester of junior year. If you're pushing beyond that, it starts getting dicey.",

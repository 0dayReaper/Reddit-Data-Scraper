I don't think you can go wrong with either option, but, leaving out the size of the Biology programs (which I cannot speak to), I was really glad I did my undergrad at Mudd instead of at Cornell.  The student culture at Mudd was insular and positive in a way I haven't found since.\n\nJust one Mudder's two cents! :D",

                    "comment": "Actually the research opportunities at Mudd are far better experiences than at a school like Cornell where undergrads would work for a grad student or post doc. At Mudd all the professors still do research, but they need to work with exclusively undergrads. That means you can be a first author on a paper, you learn how to actually do research, and your letters of recommendation are actually meaningful. There's a reason that Chem and bio majors at Mudd have a basically 100% admit rate to R1 PhD programs.\n\nAs far as collaboration, everyone takes core the first 1.5 years, so major won't impact who you are working with. You'll have friends who are engineers, cs etc. But the classes for biology aren't typically going to have the kind of late-night problem sets that you all do together in Plat. Instead, you'll have labs and research which are a different kind of collaboration, often more about working collaboratively with peers and professors to solve research problems: aka the kind of skills you need for grad school.",

I'm into Robotics, CS and music, but I don't want to give too much information about myself. Do you guys have any tips for what I should include in my personal statement or \"Why Harvey Mudd\" essay?\n\nI know this place is pretty dead, but hopefully someone finds this!",

It'll give you a ballpark estimate of where you're likely to make it into. Achievements in robotics and CS will help the most but nothing short of an Olympiad medal will guarantee admission. (Will Olympiad medals even guarantee admission to Mudd? I don't know, but those basically are a free-ish pass to the top technical schools as far as I've seen.)\n\nWhat I'm trying to do here is to bring your expectations down just in case. Maybe you're the perfect Mudd student (whatever that means), maybe you're dreaming about Mudd - whatever the case, admission or rejection is not the end of the world. If you're smart, you'll make it  anywhere after, so don't stress too much about it. Keep your head down, your legs moving, and make sure your personal statement says things you want it to say - make sure it conveys what you want it to convey. Best way to do this is to show it to someone you don't really know and ask them what they thought it was trying to say.",

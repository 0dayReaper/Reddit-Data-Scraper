            "comment": "I am a long time gone from the application process.  But here's what I have to say:\n\nPart of the beauty of Mudd is that you get a broad-based technical education.  You're not going to know what you want to study in particular in your 3-4th years until you get some exposure to things in the first couple of years.   Lots of people think they are one thing when they arrive but get interested in something else when they are working through the core classes.  \n\nHeck, you might find yourself interested in the intersection of CS with biology or chemistry -- and that's something that you might not access if you don't get a little exposure to those things.  \n\nI wouldn't worry about it.",

Some Mudders, including myself, didn't/don't even know what they wanted to major in when they/I enrolled. \n\nI think you'd be well served by dancing around the Mudd mission statement. Harvey Mudd wanted graduates of his college to understand their impact on the world. You're heading into CS wanting to solve real-world problems (as long as those problems have nothing to do with gaming or crossing the uncanny valley, they seem real enough),  so I think you're on the right track.",

Just to maybe offer some new info, Mudd cares about the holistic view, people with broad interests and passions. The reason I went to Mudd in the first place was because I had no idea what I wanted to do but I thought Mudd could help me figure that out and it did. For my Why Us essay at least I wrote about how I had no idea what I wanted to do and how I loved the humanities and sciences and Mudd is one of the few schools that would give me time to explore and allow me to pursue all my interests",

    "postText": "I'm currently very conflicted because I had committed to mudd but recently got off the waitlist at CMC where I would be doing their economics and engineering dual degree program with mudd. Not many people know much about the program so I dont know how feasible it is. I love Mudd and the core curriculum but I also had wanted to double major in public policy which I understand is an impossible task to pair withe engineering at Mudd. Does anybody have any advice or know anything about the dual degree program?",

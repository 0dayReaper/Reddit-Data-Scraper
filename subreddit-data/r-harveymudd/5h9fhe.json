I come from a school where jokes about suicide because of poor grades is common; is there something like this I will encounter here? (if I get accepted, ofc)",

            "comment": "Parties at Mudd can be pretty nuts; crazy things happen when you give engineering students a social events budget (I don't want to give you too many spoilers). Most students don't have cars, and as such you can find yourself in kind of a bubble.  Different dorms will have different vibes and as such have rivalries of sorts (North has the ex-jocks, Easties don't shower and play D&amp;D, Westies like to burn things, South has the unicycle club, etc.) and there will usually be people socializing in the lounges or courtyards well into the night.\n\nThe joke at Mudd is the three S's: Sleep, Study, and Socialize. Choose two.\n\nThere used to be another joke about the Ratio. The Ratio (note the capital R) always referred to the male:female ratio of the incoming class. It stopped being a joke once the ratio approached 1:1. ",

There isn't really a big sports program at Mudd (combined teams with Claremont McKenna and Scripps), but North and West have a \"Broomball\" game (drunken mob rugby/handball on ice) they hold every semester, and there's an inner-tube water polo tournament each year, but for the most part the dorm sport is Beer Pong.\n\nWest is the host of some pretty raucous events. For instance: Noisy Minutes. Finals week of each semester is all quiet hours except for 15 minutes each evening. In the West dorm courtyard, they tend to take axes and crowbars to old air-conditioners, refrigerators, couches, anything they might want to destroy. Winter semester they've set fire to Christmas trees (when they're dry the flames reach higher than the dorm).  The most creative burning I've heard of by a Westy was before his time at Mudd, and involved a scale model of the pentagon and a flaming model plane. \n\nThere are students with cars, and befriending them is a good way to get off campus. A friend of mine was from Irvine, so we'd occasionally head that far to spend an evening in a hot-tub, or go even farther to spend a day at the beach.\n\nHowever, there will also be times when you and your suitemates are so overloaded with work you'll still all be up and working at midnight (great time for a rum and cigar break).",

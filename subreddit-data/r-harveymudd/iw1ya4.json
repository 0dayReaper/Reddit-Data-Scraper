    "postText": "I\u2019m applying to Harvey Mudd for CS, and there\u2019s lots of things about Mudd that I like (HSA requirement, clinic program, supportive community, close relationships w professors, etc), but I\u2019m concerned about the student life and workload. Coming from a small, private, newly established high school, I felt limited in the opportunities I had in terms of clubs and traditions. I enjoyed the community, but I didn\u2019t get the actual high school experience my other friends got at big, public schools, and students didn\u2019t have much school spirit because sports weren\u2019t big at my school. For college, I want to go somewhere where the CS program is good, but where I can be involved in extracurriculars and have a social life. Does the workload at Mudd and the small school interfere with the social life? Is there lots of school spirit and fun events? For reference, I\u2019m comparing Mudd to schools like Berkeley and USC, where academics are top notch but students can have fun outside of academics.",

I definitely think you might have to give up some free time to join a lot of clubs but they\u2019re all really fun and worth the time commitments (especially prank club and muddraker!!)",

            "comment": "Your social life can be whatever you want it to be, to a point. There are plenty of organizations and leadership opportunities (including at the other colleges) that you can get involved in -- there's a club fair early on in the year where you can meet people. You won't get huge sports games and stuff (although idk, watching dorms play inner tube water polo against one another feels pretty spirited). There are various Mudd-specific traditions and parties (sometimes even dorm-specific). \n\nTldr: will you get a full college experience at Mudd? Probably. Remember that many Mudders cite \"the people\" as a reason to choose the institution, as well as what they miss coming out.",

I go to a big public school instead and kind of hate the inpersonal environment.\n\nI suppose I'm not in a position to say this but... do try to make the college your home. You'll be there for a while, make it at least enjoyable. Since you're probably at least a sophomore now, hopefully any sadness about this has disappeared.\n\n&gt; How do you like it there?\n\nI haven't been here for long, but the people are nice. Staff, students. I enjoy the environment. School has yet to start this year for me.\n\n&gt; What do you do?\n\nWell right now I'm just waiting. :P But in general study. Of course studying. Work on projects. I'm still in the common core, but planning on declaring engineering, CS being a possibility though.",

            "comment": "It really depends on a lot. Look, if you're admitted, you certainly have the intellectual capacity to get through classes at Mudd in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe problem is that most Mudders aren't the type to go to class, do their work, hang out with their friends, and do nothing else. They do extracurriculars, or side projects, and a bunch of other things. In addition to a work hard, play hard mentality, many Mudders see the place almost like a kid would a candy store - there's so much cool stuff to do, but not enough time to do all of it. As a result, a lot of people end up overcommitting themselves, and end up stressed as a result.\n\nSo, in summary, the amount of work is probably more than what you might find at some other colleges, but not insanely more so. The problem is just that you're likely to try to do a bunch of other stuff along with a curriculum, and that's what gets you.",

            "comment": "If you're admitted, you definitely have a fair shot of completion within 4-5 years. I think for admitted students, there's a graduation rate of about 80-90%? I wouldn't say it's easy, though. For an engineering major, a normal courseload (~15 credits) could be a 60-70 hour workweek in your 2nd/3rd year.\n\nSomeone mentioned getting caught up in too much as one of the main dangers. I would add to that - falling behind, I feel is the biggest danger in my mind. I know plenty of very capable students miss one class, or one homework, and it starts this positive feedback cycle of demotivation and falling behind. Obviously, the most likely way of getting into that situation is overcommitting.",

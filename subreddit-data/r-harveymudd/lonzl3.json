They have this awful form requesting the course description for **every** class you have ever taken in undergrad or grad school. I am having a horrible time finding info for two courses I took at HMC. Does anyone have the course description for either/ both of these classes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3HIST178 HM SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY &amp; GENDER Fall 1998\n\n3HIST179 SHM MODERNITY AT THE MILLENIUM Spring 1999\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have a Claremont Colleges course catalog for around that time, these might be in there. Very appreciative if you have info for one or both. Online archives only date to 2012.",

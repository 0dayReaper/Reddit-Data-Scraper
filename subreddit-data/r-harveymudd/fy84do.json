            "comment": "I graduated in 07, so there's a new dorm or two since then, and my information might be outdated.\n\nThe 4 dorms closest to the academic end of campus are the oldest. East is the oldest dorm. It was actually named after Mildred Mudd, but people called it East because it was on the East end of Campus. West was called West because it was built West of East, North was called north because it was North of East, and South was called South even though it's in the North-West corner of the inner dorms.\n\nI spent my first two years in North, and my last two in Atwood. In North you'll find the people who played at least one sport in high-school. It's the closest you'll find to jock culture. The Dorm Meatings \\[sic\\] consists of discussing arrangements for upcoming parties, giving each-other shit, and drinking lots of beer. After the meatings, interested parties will go around to the other dorms and yell \"NORF\" until people come out to say hello. When they get to East, the yelling consists of the phrase \"Mildred was a hooker!\" to which the Easties reply, \"but she wouldn't have you!\"\n\nEasties don't tend to drink or party much, but they do play DnD, and avoid showering. We did manage to engage a few of them in a feigling fight (drinking single-shot bottles of fig liquor then throwing the bottles at eachother across the quad), and when my friend drunkenly locked himself in their bathroom they were nice enough to take the door off at the hinges to get him out.\n\nWest is host to parties like Trick or Drink (exactly what it sounds like) and TQ night (which features the senseless destruction of hundreds of lemons, but the most iconic West tradition is the hosting of Noisy Minutes. Every semester finals week is designated as quiet hours,  so people can do take-home tests in peace.  Except 10 minutes each evening, during which interested parties gather at West for more senseless destruction. People haul out their broken air-conditioners or minifridges, and people go to town with sledgehammers, baseball bats, etc. One time they bought a cheap used car to destroy. Another they lit a Christmas tree on fire with a molotov cocktail.  Good times all around.  North and West also have a \"Broomball\" game they play without brooms, it's basically rugby on ice with 80-man teams.\n\nSouth is host to the Unicycle Club.  Parties at south tend to be private events rather than campus-wide or 5C parties. It's pretty quiet there.\n\nThe layout of the inner dorms is all the same. Mostly doubles, with two doubles sharing a bathroom, but the back hall features some singles (which you won't get as a freshman), and the dorm lounge.\n\nMost of the outer dorms feature suites (multiple rooms connected off a common living area). The Atwood suites have 4 singles and 2 doubles (one of which could be a triple), and two bathrooms. In addition to the suites, on two sides Atwood also has \"column doubles\" that are connected by a back hall with a room for the toilet, and another for the shower. When my friends and I lived there we built a beer pong table for the back hallway that was stored on the ceiling and could be played at variable heights.\n\nI forget the layout of the rooms in Case, but it's the one dorm with large-scale bathrooms shared across a floor.  Case throws one of the most ambitious parties of the year, Slippery When Wet, in which they plug up the drains and build a lake in their courtyard, complete with a waterfall from the second story. They also serve gin and tonics and have blacklights everywhere to encourage people to wear white shirts and dance under the waterfall.\n\nLinde is now on the East end of campus. I lived there for a summer while I was a tour guide. I don't really remember the ratio of singles to doubles in the suites there, since we weren't at full occupancy, and we were drinking a lot. Linde tends to throw some interesting invitation-only parties like their lingerie party, or The Keg That Never Existed (wherein on the night of daylight savings time changeover a keg gets finished between the hours of 2am and 2am).\n\nSontag had just been built by the time I graduated, so it hadn't had the chance to establish a culture yet. However, it was the only dorm with in-suite kitchens so I think people with dietary restrictions and married couples were given preference.\n\nI haven't been back to campus since they built Drinkward.\n\nWhen you get through your first year, let me know if anybody is still throwing the party my friends and I started, [Spring Cleaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai_MTzHvy1o) (in which people bring their alcohol to clean out their bars at the end of the school year).",

            "comment": "Since no one's mentioned anything about Drinkward let me weigh in. I was a Sontag frosh, spent my sophomore year in West, and my final two years in Drinkward. \n\nNow, Drinkward is known as the \"no culture\" dorm (a combination of it being new and not having established any form of enduring culture, and being full of seniors who just want to graduate and leave). In fact, we literally used the \"no culture' tag as being our culture. \n\nNow, the thing is, we had a very solid friend group, and this \"Drinkward Table\" thing going, where we -- seniors, frosh, sophomores, etc. -- would get together at the dining hall and have meals. Given the composition of our group, we tended to discuss controversial issues which are all too often quashed at a liberal arts college like Mudd (sad, I know). Drinkward had a weekly BBQ thing, which was fun, even though I attended few. A few parties here and there that aren't overly noteworthy. \n\nThe layout is as follows. Two three-story building blocks. One has the \"O's\" where you have singles, doubles and triples, and each floor has a lounge where you can study/get together. The other building has the dorm lounge on the bottom, which is underappreciated. It's a really nice space, where the mentors organize events, people with no access to kitchens cook, and others study (or play board games or ping pong before the ping pong table gave up on us :/). There are study rooms on the side and a communal laundry room. The rest of the building is full of suites, and one of the reasons I loved senior year so much was because of my suite, and the sheer amount of fun we had -- from late night conversations to clocking in 70 hours of video games, to having some drunk fun. But that's more personal.\n\nThe building is well-maintained, and people who complain, are in my opinion a little snobbish and unaware of just how lucky we are to have a regularly-cleaned, liveable space with nice facilities. The AC situation is a little messed up, especially in the O's. Laundry is chill. Each floor has a laundry room, except for the first floor which has two. \n\nWhoaaa this was long! Anyway, feel free to PM me, especially if you end up in Drinkward. I was heavily involved with guiding frosh through their academic stuff, and would gladly like to help, if that's needed :)",

            "comment": "l can give it a shot. Current sophomore, back home due to the virus so this is from memory. \n\nParty dorms: West, North, Linde \n\nQuiet dorms: South, East, Sontag \n\nEveryone else is in the middle. Case throws some huge parties but is otherwise quiet. \n\nEast is more or less the gamer/introvert dorm. I live in East so I can answer East-specific questions. \n\nThere are people of all stripes in the different dorms though. \n\nThe inner dorms (East, West, North, South) are set up with a central dorm lounge. Every two dorm rooms are connected by a shared bathroom; they're cleaned semi-regularly by the dorm attendant which is really weird at first but you get used to it. \n\nCase is a traditional hall style dorm, with communal bathrooms for each hall. \n\nAll the other dorms are suites: dorm rooms with a shared common area including bathroom. Some have kitchens, which depends more on the suite than the dorm. I can't remember which off the top of my head, other than that all of the Sontag suites have kitchens. \n\nSouth, Case have communal kitchens for the whole dorm. The other inner dorms don't have kitchens. There's at least one other dorm with a communal kitchen but I don't remember which. \n\nBut if you live at a dorm without a kitchen and really want to cook something it's easy enough to just go to another dorm and use their kitchen.",

I'm not sure; people generally figure out their own situations, so it's not something you hear about without being in the dorm. Suites are coed by default unless you ask to be placed in a single gender suite. I think if you get placed in an inner dorm your suitemates will be the same gender as you by default but I'm not sure (I lived in Case frosh year) \n\nYour roommates will be your gender your frosh year, but after you can room with anyone you like (this isn't that common, but it does happen, I have a pair of, as far as I know, platonic male/female friends living together). \n\nCase also has a gender neutral bathroom on each floor. I think most buildings have some sort of gender neutral bathroom -- like the ones in Sprague and Keck definitely are -- but I'm not sure.",

    "postText": "Hey fellas,\n\nI\u2019m a prospective student (junior). I\u2019m big on math and CS and I visited yesterday. I came in expecting disappointment but I kinda fell in love with it. The picture the tour guides painted was super in line with what I want because I know I wanna do STEM but I don\u2019t know what I wanna do. Culture wise it sounded fun, but I wanna know what you guys think about the culture/social life.\n\nNinja edit: anyone know if there\u2019s an active DnD club?",

You can stay in your room, you can have a close-knit friend group, or you can go all over the 5Cs and meet tons of people (assuming you have the time), it's all up to you but the options are there. \n\nMy personal experience: I was in west. I burned things, broke things, practically became an alcoholic, did all sorts of various \"things\", listened to music exceptionally loud at all times of the day, did a fuckton of homework, learned how to balance work and life, and had an absolute blast all in all (after having a super innocent, hard working high school time). It was an interesting time. \n\nBut that's 1/9 of the school only, your experience absolutely doesn't have to be that. It's a super open, nonjudgmental, non-peer-pressuring community. It's a 200 person class, so you know almost everybody all too well, and depending, the grades above and below too. Bear that in mind, it's not like a university where 90+% of the people you see on a daily basis are strangers. I liked the intimacy but it drives other people crazy. \n\nI'm sure you've heard the whole thing about the dorm subcultures. They're mostly accurate. There's definitely a variable amount of inter-dorm activity.\n\nIf you want to play DnD, IDK about a club but I'm sure a ton of people in East or South or Case play, even some Westies I knew dabbled.

There's a lot going socially for such a small school and, as was mentioned previously, you can also hang out with students from the other 5C's. \n\nAs for DnD, I know of at least four games that my friends are involved with from many different dorms. One game being planned actually has some profs in the party.",

Currently, the core can be very difficult if you don't have enough preparation. I came in having taken AP calc, physics C, AP computer science, and multivariable calculus and I did ok in core. Students without so much prep struggled with the amount of work. After core though, the workload evens out significantly. Either we've acclimated or its gotten better.",

The academic environment is very collaborative, and we're all in the same core classes, so this is where I met most of my classmates. A lot of students also prioritize some work/life balance over finishing every problem on the problem set.",

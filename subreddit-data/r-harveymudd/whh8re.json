My mates who never strayed south of 12th started feeling pretty isolated\u2014it's a small place after all!\u2014and a lot of the best \"house\" parties I went to were at Pomona or Pitzer. Even if you don't have a reason, just walking is a great way to meet random people!",

Others are open to all five colleges (5c). Back when I went to Mudd it had a serious gender imbalance problem (the joke was the ratio was pi to one).  Scripps, a women's college, was next door, so for some events it made sense to do 2c: Mudd + Scripps.",

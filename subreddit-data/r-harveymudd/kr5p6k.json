But I wouldn't be all that discouraged with even a B-, to be honest. All of these classes are *quite* time intensive in my experience, especially E80. What makes them difficult is not necessarily the content or grade deflation, but the amount of blood, sweat, and tears you have to put in to get the work done in a decent fashion.",

These classes are very, very time consuming and difficult for everyone, and frankly, the content you learn is tangentially applicable to CS, at best. Recommend you take CS70 or similar at Mudd, instead. I know everyone does it, but that's the best you can do for yourself.\n\nE4 is about design principles and has you machining. The design exercises are cool, but it's... really not that special.\n\nE79 is signals and systems, and only the intro at that. Good for understanding control theory and analog electrical engineering, but almost no use in conventional CS.\n\nE80 is an absolute gauntlet of a course and teaches you engineering research skills. The lab kind.\n\nE85 might actually not be a bad pick. If you ask me, too few software engineers know the ins and outs of how a computer chip works. Too often, I've heard that nything at the C level or lower is just \"too low-level\" to them. Which is fair, but this stuff can give you some great insight into how you code.",

I want to know the ins and outs of computers and the like; the whole reason I came to a liberal arts school was to obtain a well-rounded education. So I\u2019ll take your advice and maybe try a couple of the classes first before even thinking about taking the others\u2014which I likely won\u2019t but this will at least give a good idea of the engineering courses. I think I\u2019ll probably try E79 or E85 first, however, as you said, they are time consuming. While taking classes like CS, Physics, and Stats, would you recommend I take both of these (E79 and E85 or E79 and E4) in one semester (this would be Fall 2021)? Or would that be a disaster waiting to happen?",

It's an option to try both and then drop one if it's too time consuming, to take it again the next semester. If I were to do two and I was already stressed out, I would probably go for E4 and another class? Especially if there's no hammer. That thing takes like 50 hours.\n\nPersonally, I probably wouldn't say it's a disaster waiting to happen, but that's something better evaluated from your point of view. What I can tell you is that E79 and E85 will require at least 10-15 hours of work each week, if you're keeping decent pace with the material. E4, with no hammer... Probably less than 10. I would DM the other poster about how COVID affects these estimates, or if I'm off entirely.",

I don't plan on taking any of the Engineering classes until Fall 2021 so I don't think COVID would affect any of them, assuming we're on campus of course. But now that you've quantified the workload a little bit, I will definitely take a more level-headed approach in selecting what to take. Thanks for all the help! :)",

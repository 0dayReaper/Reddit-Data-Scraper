In that survey you'll answer some questions about what type of person you are and any needs you have. I think there might have been a question about whether you prefer a single. There are a small number (it was 11 during 2014-2018) of singles available to frosh in South Dorm, but I'm not sure if there's anything you can do to ensure you get one",

I live in a single and there are a considerable amount of singles here (mostly within suites, I believe), but there are definitely shared rooms (the Fishbowl rooms, to begin with). That being said, I requested a single and got placed in South, so I think your chances of getting placed in a single here are good, especially if your answers to the housing survey mesh well with the general personality of South.",

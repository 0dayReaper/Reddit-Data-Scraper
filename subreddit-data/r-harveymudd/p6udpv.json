    "postText": "I'm in 12th grade. I've been doing the IBDP for two years now. I don't know if it's because of the pandemic but this whole 'rigorous course' thing is killing me. I want to ED to Mudd but I heard it's extremely academic oriented with no time for much else. Just like the IB, but much harder. Maybe I'm just scared, but should I still go for it? \n\nI know the value of studying in a stressful curriculum. There is so much that the IB has given me, but I don't know if it is worth going through everything x10 for another 4 years.",

            "comment": "from a current Mudd student: it _is_ quite busy, but also it's possible to make time for other things.  The main thing is that you have to be a lot more diligent about managing your time, avoiding signing up for too many things, and setting aside time for \"life\" things.  There is room for non-academic things, but unlike at other places here you have to be a lot more mindful of finding time for it.",

I did it, and I graduated (eventually), but after a lot of ups and downs and extreme stress that eventually left me with the beginning of some chronic nervous system/immune problems that I'm still working through years later. I can't say I regret it, exactly, but I would hesitate to recommend it. That's my official line about Mudd.",

If you're ALREADY stressed, I'd be worried about how that translates. But I'm a few decades out of date at this point, so grain of salt.",

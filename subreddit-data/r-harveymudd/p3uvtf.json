On campus, you are never more than a 10 minute walk away from a piano. Downstairs in Platt, there's the jam room, which has a drumset, which is great for stress relief. \n\nIf your child needs a _grand_ piano, I believe Scripps has a few. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if those are readily available to Mudders or if you need to sign up for access by taking a class or something. I hope someone else can chime in about pianos on the other campuses. \n\nSource: I am a Physics '17 alumna",

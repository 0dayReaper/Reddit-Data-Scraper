            "comment": "Soon-to-be-graduating senior here. While the academic workload at HMC is greater than that of probably 99% of other colleges, it is (usually) totally doable so long as you manage your time well. Throughout my years here, I've pretty much always had enough time for clubs and other activities (outside of midterm and finals seasons, anyway). Some majors are more demanding of your time than others; engineering is definitely the most demanding and CS and biology are probably the least (but still very demanding). The first semester at Mudd, especially with recent changes to the core curriculum, is comparatively light work-wise and leaves plenty of time for socializing and club activities. \n\nThe academic environment at HMC is highly collaborative; everybody helps everybody with their work and this is possibly HMC's best quality. It makes a huge difference compared to schools like Caltech, which has similarly rigorous academics but the students are very competitive. Beyond collaboration, there are plenty of academic resources, from tutoring for just about every STEM class to direct assistance from the academic deans. It really does feel like the whole community wants you to succeed academically.\n\nI haven't experienced any bullying myself at HMC. I've heard of a few instances but as a whole they are quite rare; I'd guess we have less bullying than most colleges. Everyone here is nerdy to some degree, so you definitely won't get bullied for being a geek.\n\nHMC's Office of Health and Wellness has plenty of resources for mental and physical health. Beyond that, all students at the Claremont Colleges have access to Monsour Counseling and Psychological Sevices, which offers free and confidential counseling. I never made use of these resources myself, however, so I can't comment on their effectiveness.",

At other less rigorous schools, I wouldn\u2019t worry because it wouldn\u2019t be as rigorous. She does best when her teachers are very involved and caring. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I don\u2019t think UC is best for her. \n\nWould Pitzer be a better option?

Is this common and is Mudd generally ok with that? Is there any pushback?\n\nIt might be possible? I mean, there's some weird create-your-major stuff, but at the end of the day, you will need classes and professors relevant to that field. I'm not a bio major, so I wouldn't know, but I would doubt it as the bio dept. at Mudd is probably the smallest there.\n\n&gt;Regarding the core curriculum, my kid does not like CS at all. Is everyone required to take it? And if yes, is it possible to get tutoring if stuck?\n\nYes, as well as many other sciences. There are wonderful tutors. Personally, I hated biology, but I'm glad I studied the basics. The same applies evermore for CS, as every field will need to know the basics of how computers work.\n\n&gt;Have you known anyone who dropped out bc they couldn\u2019t handle the rigor or couldn\u2019t pass a class? Does Mudd allow the student to retake the class to pass?\n\nYes (many), and yes. Sometimes people will take an easier version of the class off-campus. You will still get the first failing grade on your transcript, same as other schools.\n\n&gt; She does best when her teachers are very involved and caring. \n\nIf anywhere, Mudd is the place for that. The professors are generally *very* caring despite holding high standards. They're all there to teach, since Mudd is a college only.\n\n&gt; Would Pitzer be a better option? I\u2019m not implying it\u2019s less rigorous but it doesn\u2019t have that Mudd core.\n\nWe can mozy about and pretend there are no differences in rigor, status, etc. but the fact of the matter is there is. For STEM subjects, Mudd is more rigorous than Pitzer, and that comes with its pros (better understanding of material, better preparation for future grad school/industry) and cons (more work, more stress, lower grades).\n\n&gt; We don\u2019t really care about the prestige but really need an environment where she can thrive and make lifelong friends. And look back at college with fond memories.\n\nHonestly, I've gotten questions about whether or not Mudd is ABET accredited so I'm not sure about prestige anymore, anyway. But I do love all my friends that I met there and hang out/travel with them very often.",

            "comment": "I used to teach at Mudd until recently. The workload is tremendous, but so are the career outcomes so I am pretty torn on if the ends justify the means.\n\nDuring my three years there I never heard of any bullying and my students seemed friendly with each other. A big benefit of an institution with only 900 students is that there is a pretty strong sense of community. This is not something I saw when I attended large state schools for undergrad and grad school.\n\nThere is definitely mental health support. But they usually require a student to be proactive in seeking them out. Even if a professor or dean throws a life raft, the drowning student still needs to grab it.\n\nLastly, because it is small, hiring places an emphasis on instruction so professors are (mostly) great teachers and mentors. That is definitely not my experience at big schools where research is the primary focus and instruction, inclusivity, and personability are after thoughts.\n\nAll in all I think mudd is a top tier institution for science and technology, but student workload is a major concern of mine. Several years ago, a third party auditor wrote something to the effect of \"students at Mudd don't have time to pursue the pleasures of the flesh.\" I know this is being addressed, but it requires a cultural shift which inherently takes a long time as professors can remain at an institution for 35+ years.",

                            "comment": "&gt; So it\u2019s ok to work on homework with others?\n\nIt's highly encouraged in most assignments for most classes at Mudd, which in my opinion is the right way to do things, and probably one of my favorite things about Mudd. It's never too early to start throwing people at each other and teaching them how to interact and cooperate.\n\n&gt;But is there any hierarchy among kids who are more academic than others?\n\nThere always is. But the key is to find a group of people who have the same mindset as you and compatible working styles. And not being in the nerds amongst nerds study group is not detrimental for doing quite well. In my case, I think not being in that group helped me be more independent in my studies rather than completely relying on gleaning from intuition others have gotten through their own hard work, which is indispensable the moment you leave the classroom, and very helpful even within the classroom.\n\nFor me, I learn more commandeering my own smaller ship than be a deckhand barely holding on to a large ship.\n\n&gt;Like if they think you need more help, would they still be ok with you joining their group?\n\nThere might be hierarchy (groups will exist and ultimately at least one of them is very academically-inclined even for Mudd), but I would refrain from stating there is superiority. From what I saw, the smartest kids were always also the nicest and most willing to help.\n\n&gt;I feel like Mudders are good at everything?\n\nNot true! Everyone comes in with their own background, and varying degrees of fullness. I was able to help others in software and physics, but would often require help in biology and chemistry. It's all about helping your friends fill in their gaps and receiving help in your own gaps.\n\n&gt;but her character and personality fit in with the spirit of the 5Cs.\n\nIf you asked me, this is more important than academic this and academic that. You can catch up on academics, if behind relative to the population. But not fitting in will last forever.\n\nThat said, do *not* underestimate the academic workload. Having to catch up *and* keep up at the same time can be stressful, and I've seen it shatter people's confidence - especially my friends who were used to breezing through high school with full scores and then suddenly hitting walls where they used to be strong. My advice would be to check in often.",

She had imposter syndrome when she first arrived, but has found it to be manageable so far and a good fit. She appreciated that the first semester was pass/fail as it took a bit of the pressure off. She takes advantage of all the support and collaboration opportunities for studying and has made some great friends. \n\nShe is in a suite-style dorm with one freshman, one sophomore, two juniors, and a senior and loves that she\u2019s friends with students of all ages.  She hasn\u2019t mentioned any bullying and has similar traits that you mentioned in your daughter. She participates in a bunch of intramural sports with Mudd and Scripps students, is on a 5C\u2019s club team, does paint nights with Dean Chris, and appreciates the opportunity to get to know students at the other colleges. \n\nIt\u2019s been great so far!

As a parent I\u2019m not sure if getting accepted means the student ought to go if that student is not the strongest in terms of math compared to the others accepted. I think it\u2019s called imposter syndrome (?) where academically you think or are not really on par with your peers but you have other attributes that would make Mudd a better place. Those attributes are not academic more personality traits (outgoing, kind, nonjudgmental, empathetic, very collaborative). We just know a few upperclassmen and kids who have gotten in. These kids in high school were studying math that was college level, beyond Calculus 1-3. And my kid is on calculus as a senior. \n\nHow would Mudd know that the student can thrive and graduate? How do we as parents go about determining if a Mudd-level college is really the right place since the school is known to be extremely rigorous?",

The first year is set up to bring all students to a similar baseline, even if they don\u2019t have the same academic background. There are remedial classes with no stigma attached. I took college level math in high school and still took a remedial calculus class because it had been too long since I had taken it the first time.\n\nAgreed on the bullying, I really didn\u2019t see any while I was there.

I don't know anything about HM specifically but I do know that other students have appealed their rejection letters successfully at other schools. You'd need the support of your guidance counselor and additional teacher recommendations. Plus, the person I know who did this received acceptance to their appeal late in the summer. Not sure if they lost their deposit to the school they did accept a spot.",

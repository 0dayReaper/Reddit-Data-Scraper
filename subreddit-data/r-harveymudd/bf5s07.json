    "postText": "I was lucky enough to be admitted to both Johns Hopkins and Harvey Mudd, but I can't decide which one to attend. The price is the same, and I like the atmosphere of both schools equally (even though they're quite different). My interests are in math, CS, physics, biology/medicine, and neuroscience, but I'm not exactly sure where I want to specialize. As of now, I'm thinking that some sort of bio/physics/CS combination would be my best bet, as it would give me a solid foundation that might prepare me go into any of the aforementioned directions in grad school. The potential for undergrad research is a huge factor for me. Also, in terms of post-grad plans I'm strongly leaning towards getting a PhD and doing research but I'm not entirely opposed to going straight into industry. Any insight regarding the pros and cons of either or any thoughts that could help me choose would be much appreciated.\n\ntl;dr - Hopkins or Mudd?",

            "comment": "Mudd is fantastic if you're interested in interdisciplinary studies, it's very easy to cross enroll between departments and other schools in the 5Cs (except for CMC). Idk if that's true for John Hopkins or not. Additionally it's extremely easy to get research experience over summers at Mudd, even as a freshman. As for your postgrad plans, you're probably going to re-evaluate once you actually enter college, but Mudders generally have a fine time both getting jobs in industry or going into grad school, though note that there's minimal grade inflation (and tons of requirements) so GPAs at Mudd tend to be slightly lower than at a standard university, again, Idk how it is at Hopkins. Another slight downside is that Mudd's bio department isn't very large. \n\nBut you're asking a Mudd subreddit, obviously the answers will be biased but I had a helluva time at Mudd and would recommend... as long as you enjoy studying.",

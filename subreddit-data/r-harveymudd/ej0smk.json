I could try and get my 8 meals in a week, since I sometimes went out on the weekends, but it's not incredibly cost effective. With a price of $4222, eating all your 16 meals a week with 16 weeks in a semester comes out to $16.49 each meal. It's buffet, of course, so you can eat as much as you want, but it's really difficult to squeeze out all $32 of food every day, with another 2 a week for $16 breakfasts. I won't post about some sketchier tactics to get less ripped off by the dining hall, but there's things you can do.\n\nIt's not super easy to cook in dorm unless you know you're in a suite with a kitchen. For groceries, drive to Von's up the street is the best bet.",

    "postText": "Hi there. I am an engineering student at Georgia Tech who will be working the spring semester in Claremont California. I figured I would start my housing search with Harvey Mudd since it is in town. I am looking for a place in town to live while I work. I am decently likable and dedicated to a clean common space. If you know of any housing available or have any tips on where I might find an inexpensive place to stay, any help would be greatly appreciated. We are all college stusents we know a thing or two about finding a place to live.",

            "comment": "I'm sure some current students will attempt to help (personally, I graduated 10 years ago), but a significant percentage of HMC students ( not sure the exact number now, but it felt &gt; 95% in 2003 ) live on campus. There are a few nearby housing options that may pop up, but off-campus living isn't a very common topic at HMC.\n",

Since we have committed to growing our student body, more and more of us are going to have to move there until we get the new dorms (also approved) built out. That might be something to look into.\n\nI also know of at least one dude who went in on a house with some folks from Pitzer and just lives there instead of in the dorms. I don't think the administration will let students not enrolled in any of the Claremonts live in Mudd dorms, however.",

            "comment": "I chose Mudd because I didn't get in to Caltech.  I majored in CS ('03).  What I didn't like was how tough most all the classes were and how many credits you needed to graduate (128 vs 96 for the other Claremont colleges). But looking back I feel like I actually learned a shit-ton and turns out getting a thorough and robust education is really helpful in grad school and industry.  I liked the community: everyone worked really hard *together* (I didn't feel like students were in competition with each other) and we partied together even harder.  [Though, I did develop a drinking problem.  Ooops!]  Also, lots of research opportunities as an undergrad, which I did not take enough advantage of.\n\nI would absolutely recommend it, as long as you're willing to work really uncomfortably hard.\n\nWest is best. Screw the rest! ",

            "comment": "My junior year in high school I competed in the AMC and got the top score in my school. Most schools weren't interested yet because I was a junior, but Mudd sent me their junk mail brochure. I understand it's since been redesigned, but the version back then was neon blue wand pink with a big yellow \"Junk Mail\" stamp across the cover. Very eye-catching.\n\nAnyway, the next year when I was looking into schools and had boxes of recruitment material to sort through I got the Junk Mail brochure again which reminded me of the name. I then got lists from my high school guidance counselor of the top 50 schools in math, physics, and engineering, as well as a list of schools that were just great places to be. Mudd was on all four lists.\n\nAnyway, it was enough to get me to take a tour of the place on my west coast swing and fall in love. ",

            "comment": "I chose HMC because I wanted a broad education in the sciences and in engineering.  I wasn't sure what kind of engineering I wanted to do until about halfway through Mudd (and a couple years after that I changed my mind!)  On the one hand, I am very glad that I got the chance to learn about chemical engineering, computer engineering, electrical, materials, etc (as well as chemistry/physics/etc).  But on the other hand, the breadth in the core curriculum (as well as the ridiculous number of humanities required) limits the depth available to you as an undergrad.  \n\nI also chose it over other schools due to the small community.  I felt very comfortable there, and I got to know many students and faculty very well.  I don't know exactly the state of the honor code - it was going through some turmoil as I left due to growing pains, but having that was very important to me.  \n\nThe good: a great education, broad groundwork in many different fields.  Good community, professors who actually care (compare to many other schools).  \n\nThe bad: lack of depth in engineering fields.  You only get 3 electives :-/\n\nI didn't realize it until well after graduation, but HMC (at least when I went there a few years ago) is an extremely theoretical program.  So many equations, simulations, etc.  Yes, there is Clinic, which is supposed to give you a real-world engineering experience, but that never seems to turn out exactly as planned.  I swear I spent more time working on presentations and reports than actually doing engineering work.  \n\nThat said, I've heard that they revamped the Core curriculum after I left, and now it includes lots of interdisciplinary courses with more applications.  That's probably a good thing - I don't know too much about Core now.  \n\nIt is _hard_ work.  The school also has name recognition only among certain companies.  Google, Laserfiche, and a few others know and love Mudders, but it often doesn't have the name recognition that a lot of other schools have.  A lot of people outside of California don't know it and probably think of it only as a small engineering school, when it's actually one of the top programs.  \n\nMy advice, regardless of where you go to school:  if you want to be employed after college, major in engineering or CS.  The people I know who studied physics, chemistry, and biology are either in grad school or unemployed, for the most part.  ",

    "postText": "hi! so I committed to USC a few weeks ago but was recently admitted to Mudd off the waitlist. I have until tomorrow 12pm to decide which school to go to and I\u2019m having a LOT of trouble, in part because USC will cost about $15-20k/year less than Mudd since USC is giving me $30k/year in merit aid while HMC is giving me $15k in need-based. My parents tell me this shouldn\u2019t hold me back but I still feel really bad. I\u2019ll be a CS/engineering major but I also really love language (thinking about either a linguistics or a literature minor). Can anyone tell me why they chose Mudd, or just offer advice/opinions on my situation?",

My mom said if I flipped a coin, in the instant I saw the result I\u2019d feel relieved or disappointed, and that would tell me the right answer. \n\nYou can try it! Ultimately I\u2019m a believer that there is almost never one right choice in life. They will probably both be great options for you. You just have to pick one and then not second guess it, but make the most out of the option you chose. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Mudd was my top choice so once I got in I essentially committed that day!  I chose Mudd because of the small class sizes, abundant student research opportunities, strength of the education, and the fact that when I visited, I felt I was surrounded by many others who were also passionate about math and science like me.\n\nMudd taught me so much about math and science and reinforced my passion for it. It was HARD  but it pushed me to do better. Many professors are very caring and I felt supported by them in the majority of my courses. I thought the social aspect of Mudd was great and there was always something to do or people to talk to.  It's a SMALL school and there is a sense of community on campus that I certainly miss now that I am at a much larger graduate institution. \n\nPersonally, I loved my time there.  Mudd isn't perfect but it was what I was looking for in an a college experience. I feel very prepared in grad school and confident about my abilities having gone through Mudd. \n\nBest of luck with your decision!",

            "comment": "Hey! So I'm currently a rising Sophomore at Mudd, and I can tell you that this past year has probably been the best year of my academic life. The students and the professors at Mudd just form such an amazing community that are willing to support you and guide you every step of the way. Also, Mudd is part of the Claremont Consortium as you probably know. This means you can take classes at any of the other 4 Claremont Colleges (Pitzer, Pomona, Claremont McKenna, and Scripps), so following your passion of languages shouldn't be a problem at all. In fact, Mudd requires every student to concentrate (or minor) in a non STEM discipline to graduate.\n\nPersonally, why I chose Mudd was largely because of how unique the experience they offer is. It is literally the only liberal arts college with a heavy focus on STEM, such that every student has to do the core (which includes 1-3 classes in Physics, Chem, Bio, Math, CS and Engineering), while also making sure that 1/3 of their classes have to be unrelated to STEM. In addition to this, the spirit of collaboration and community at Mudd is truly unparalleled. This is enhanced by the fact that there are only 200 kids in your year and all 200 of them take the exact same classes as you in the first year. This results in getting to know a vast majority of people in your year very well. Lastly, because of being a small undergraduate only college, professors are always willing to talk with students about literally anything and are always open to doing research with students. Also, the professors are absolutely brilliant (as an example look up Prof. Zach Dodds on rateMyProfessors.com - he is an absolute legend).\n\nIn the end your choice has to depend on what you want from your college experience and of course the financial aid. If you want a large college experience with Greek life etc., then you should probably go with USC; however, if that is not the case, Mudd is definitely the place as long as you're willing to work hard and you're okay with the financial aid. I hope that helps! Feel free to PM me if you have more questions and hope to see you at Mudd in the Fall!",

            "comment": "Of the schools I got into, only Cornell ranked above Mudd as far as my preferences went, but Mudd literally offered infinitely more financial aid (like, 45k v. 0k), so it was a no-brainer. \n\nNow, I chose Mudd compared to the other schools, because back then it mattered a lot to me to be admitted into a selective school that has the prestige. And you will notice that the incoming admitted pool at Harvey Mudd is always exceptionally strong, in terms of test scores, class rank and grades, and I certainly felt that I was surrounded by brilliant individuals, while there. \n\nNow, the name Harvey Mudd definitely doesn't get thrown around as often as many of its likewise prestigious peers, in and out of state, but for those who are aware of the academic rigor at Mudd, it stands out, for sure.\n\nAs for advice, yes, I get that you feel bad regarding the extra 15k or so, and that's valid. But Mudd and USC, while both being top schools, differ in so many ways, that I personally think you can get an answer by asking a few questions: \n\n1) Do you want to be in a small-sized school, where you will end up knowing almost everyone in your class year? Mudd is wayyy smaller, and while I can't vouch for USC, regardless of your inclinations (more nerdy v. more jock type), you will find a group of friends at Mudd who will share your interests and passions. \n\n2) Do you have an end goal, yet, as in job v. grad school? Mudd's grading is a little harsh at times, but from experience, classes like CS are very heavily homework-weighted (v. physics, for instance), and people tend to graduate with higher GPAs (v. for other majors). Plus, the average GPA at Mudd has been on the rise, from low 3's a few years back to around 3.4, now. Both schools have excellent reputations as far as CS and engineering go, and once more I can only vouch for Mudd -- so many of my friends scored internships at prestigious companies while at Mudd, and likewise for jobs. Grad school? A little trickier. My GPA was close to the Mudd average, and while I was lucky to get into one of my top choices for grad school, I got rejected at others, and I feel like my grade may have had a part to play. Now, if you're at all considering a CS+Engineering double major, let me tell you that no one does that at Mudd -- because it's an incredible amount of workload, and you will need to take too many classes each semester. You can either 1) create your own major, like robotics, with courses from both, 2) major in CS and take engineering electives, or vice versa. I took a few engineering courses, and let me tell you, the engineering faculty is absolutely fabulous. Throwing in names for good measure: Dato for materials, Bassman for systems, Clarke for robotics, and back then, Little for design, just to name a few. Also, given your interest in the humanities, there are plenty of on- and off-campus options (like at Pomona, etc.) that you'd very much appreciate!\n\n3) While I did mention Mudd is a place where you will find folks with the same interests, and you can party often, if that's what you'd like, there is no doubt that USC has more of a \"party school\" vibe v. Mudd being more of a \"nerd school\" vibe. For one, no frats and sororities. Next, the average Mudder is quirky and a little awkward, socially, versus the average USC student. Plus, while some at Mudd are into sports, and the 5Cs (Claremont Colleges) have two athletic teams, USC is on a whole other level when it comes to athletics. That, I think, is pretty obvious. \n\nUltimately, I really think you're choosing between two great schools, so can't really go wrong. Best of luck choosing, and I know it's a tight deadline, but feel free to reach out if you so wish. \n\nClass of 2019 alum here, physics major.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a prospective (but still not fully decided) Physics major looking into rigorous colleges with liberal arts/allows you to switch majors more fluidly. I came across Harvey-Mudd, but I personally enjoy bigger schools closer to a big city, and it seems like finding things to do outside of campus and not making academics your whole life isn't really big (I'm way too prone for stress). Also, the fact that other ways to extend yourself like sports and sororities/fraternities don't really exist, so it really seems like all academics. I'm not sure whether I want to ED for HMC, do you guys think it would still worth it?",

Sorta depends what you\u2019re looking for in a Greek system to know whether it would scratch your itch. A small school can provide a sense of community that students at larger schools rely on Greek communities to fill. There are plenty of parties and social activities centered on the dorm communities.\n\nThe academics are certainly challenging. And managing stress is something that can be quite challenging.",

It\u2019s a good school but it really often is all academics with very little time for much else. It\u2019s known for being hard and incredibly stressful. I agree with what the other comment says for the most part. Definitely still apply but maybe wait for a tour if you can get a feel of what campus is like if you want to do ED",

Haven't managed to find any updates on it other than this article.\n\n[https://www.hmc.edu/about-hmc/2018/11/15/hmc-students-are-building-an-airplane/](https://www.hmc.edu/about-hmc/2018/11/15/hmc-students-are-building-an-airplane/) \n\nThanks!!",

See the video attached.\n\nThe plane performed beautifully.  Controls are well balanced, with no heavy wing.  No fluid leaks.  We have some excellent workmanship on many systems!  This is the start of 40 hours of phase 1 testing.\n\nWe are troubleshooting elevated carbon monoxide levels.  We\u2019ve sealed every path we can find and are still seeing 100-200 ppm during runup, but the levels appear to go down in cruise flight.\n\nHooray for everyone who contributed to the build!  After the pandemic subsides, please come see the plane.\n\nDavid Harris",

Unfortunately a lot of people from the other 4Cs (and Mudd itself) want to take CS classes at Mudd so they do fill up quickly to say the least. However, as a CS major you would be guaranteed the classes you need to fulfill your requirements and besides being a bit of a headache it should be okay.\n\nWhat I *would* be worried about is that Pomona has it's own CS program, and from what I've heard (someone correct me if I'm wrong) they want their students to take their CS classes at Pomona and not at Mudd. I believe this is because the curriculums are taught in a very different way at each school. You might be able to take a CS class at Mudd as an elective but idk if it would count towards your major and it might be hard to get into. Again, this is a Pomona-specific problem and I do know plenty of people at CMC Pitzer and Scripps who major in CS at Mudd if you want to try to go down that route instead.",

    "postText": "I'm a senior and I'm applying to Mudd right now. I saw on the common app that there's an option to turn in \"mathematical or scientific endeavors or research abstracts\". I haven't exactly done anything like that, would that be a big disadvantage? I did do one thing last year that's sort of just conducting a survey and using the results for data processing but it's not exactly a scientific endeavor or a research abstract. I have a pretty good GPA and an alright SAT/ACT scores but nothing super attractive, so I don't know if this would make or break me.\n\nThanks! ",

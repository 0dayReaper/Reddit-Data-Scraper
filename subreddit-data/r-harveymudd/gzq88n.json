            "comment": "2020 grad CS/Math here\n\nHigh school -&gt; Mudd\nMy transition was rough. My school didn't have many stem offerings, so I started off behind in pretty much everything. First semester being P/NC was essential for me to be able to catch up.\n\nRigor\nThen core is just very challenging and time consuming. I had to drop extracurricular activities, which initially wrecked havoc on my mental health. That got better tho once I started making friends (not my strong suit). In my experience, people tend to act like they're getting better grades than they are (whether that's by what they say or by doing extra activities you couldn't fit into your schedule), so just worry about how you're doing and don't get caught up thinking everyone else is having an easier time.\n\nBurnout\nI was really burned out at the end of sophomore year. Junior year was better because I got to take more electives. I wouldn't say I'm burnt out now. I had a good senior year: finally no roommate, electives, fun clinic project. I was applying for jobs last fall and had one by early spring. I know if that hadn't happened I'd likely be more stressed. I'm excited about my future right now and eager to start work soon\n\nMental health on campus \nI pretty much kept to myself so I'm probably not the best person to comment on the whole campus. I have tried using all the available resources on campus and they're honestly all pretty hard to get into. If you want to use any of them, it's best to try to set things up before the semesters start\n\nHumanities \nI'd say it depends on what you're trying to study. I did a linguistics concentration. It was very hard for me to get into classes because Pomona's dept is overwhelmed and gives priority to Pomona and Pitzer students. I don't really know how it is for other concentrations. I did get to take other very cool humanities classes just not in linguistics.\n\nWorth it?\nIf you asked me at graduation I would have definitely said yes. I'm already very pleased with how things have worked out for me. But I've already started to notice what being over the stress from Mudd has meant for my physical health. I'm sleeping in more than 3hr blocks. No more headaches, anxiety attacks, or digestive issues. Idk I think for Mudd to be worth it you need to be able to evaluate how you want to balance your grades and extracurriculars (for most, one has to give). I also think having some future goal in mind helps. It doesn't even have to stay the same all four years. My first 2 1/2 years I wanted to go to grad school for math and worked toward that. Then I switched to wanting to be a software engineer. I think it helps to have a clear reason you're putting yourself under stress.",

                            "comment": "Jobs:\n\nOnline mostly. I applied both in California (LA and San Francisco) and my home state (soutwest). I got more responses from places in California. The job I ended up taking I got thanks to my clinic advisor.\n\nI got lucky with profs helping me out because I didn't really do much in the way of cultivating relationships.   A math prof helped me get a summer research position because I did well in his class (didn't interact with him otherwise). He showed me how to search for positions, wrote me a recommendation letter and  reviewed my personal statement. I honestly wouldn't have known to apply for that if he hadn't reached out.  Then I also didn't go out of my way to get help from my clinic advisor (a cs prof). 2 takeaways: Mudd profs will take note of hard work and try to help you and given that, I bet I could've gotten more help if I had actually reached out even just by going to more office hours \n\nI didn't take advantage of this because I didn't know about it, but join the Alumni linkedin page early. People post internship opportunities in there. You can also look through the members to find someone doing what youre interested in and try to reach out. Alumni have been talking about helping current students out more because of covid. Hopefully that trend would continue \n\nBurnout\n\nTldr: I made a very stupid scheduling decision sophomore spring\n\nSophomore spring was a hard semester for me. For tech classes I was taking the first non-intro major requirements: CS70 Data Structures, CS81 Computabilty and Logic, and MATH131 Real Analysis. Then I also had a math elective. This schedule would've meant that I only had 3 required major courses left and would just be taking electives otherwise. This was a bad idea for me. I highly recommend not taking 3 required tech classes.\n\nCS70: very long homework assignments (6-10 hrs for me). You also have to do all work with a partner. I recommend locking who you're going to work with down early. I had very, very bad experiences with randomly assigned partners (which made the class really awful for me)\n\nCS81: not a bad class. I just hated the way the prof taught and didn't get anything out of lecture. In retrospect, I probably wouldn't have taken the course that semester because of the prof. Some courses will have more flexibility (still just within a semester or 2) of when you need to take them by. CS81 has some leeway, but you want to take CS70 as early as possible because most of the cs electives require it.\n\nMATH131: easily the hardest math class I've ever taken. I also knew it wasn't going to be a strong class for me going in.\n\nYeah, all these classes are known for being difficult, so signing up for all of them at once + another math class was very, very dumb of me. Before this semester I thought major advisors were supposed to have your back on not letting you do this sort of thing to yourself, which was naive. I wasn't having academic issues so most of the advising meetings were just about making sure I hit the credit count. I should've taken responsibility for making sure my schedule actually sounded feasible for me. They share a spreadsheet with freshman showing a minimal graduation track for every major. I recommend sticking to that, the semesters look pretty well balanced",

            "comment": "I was pretty used to college classes coming in (I ended up taking a lot of college-level classes due to my high school having a very limited selection of classes). The transition was still rough for me, partially because now *all* of my classes required that increased level of work and partially because I *way* overcommitted myself in my first semester. Beyond academics, I was spending about 17 hours a week in extracurriculars, which I would really not recommend.\n\nAfter that adjustment period, dealing with the rigor of Mudd wasn't too bad. For me, it was mostly about not doing too much in the realm of extracurriculars; some courses were rough but I never had a semester with more than 1 or 2 really tough courses.\n\nIn terms of senior burnout, I felt it hard, but I think that was largely due to my senior fall semester being consumed with grad school and fellowship applications, causing me to overcommit myself again. I basically ended up doing the minimum possible in my last semester.\n\nI don't know what mental health of students is now (I've been out for almost 10 years now), but when I was there, I'd say most of it was related to stress stemming from trying to do too much in terms of academics, extracurriculars, or both.\n\nFinally, I was able to continue to pursue my humanities interests, though it was definitely tough in terms of time management. Because my concentration was music, I found that the workload in most weeks was pretty regular (not so for my STEM courses, unfortunately). I'd say it was definitely worth it - I had a great time and learned a ton - but it wasn't easy.",

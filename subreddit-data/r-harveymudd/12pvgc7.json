    "postText": "Hello! I am a recently admitted student to the Mudd class of 2027. About two weeks before college decision day, I want to hear from current and former students about their experience at Mudd. I devised a list of aspects I'd like to see at Mudd:\n\n**Academics**\n\n* Well-developed and known computer science/engineering program\n* Have multiple opportunities to study artificial intelligence\n* Able to conduct research with professors who are top of their field\n* Small classroom sizes and low student-faculty ratio (especially within computer science)\n* High average salary after graduation\n* High student acceptance into top graduate programs\n* Have professors who value their relationship with students\n* Taught by professors and not teaching assistants (TAs)\n* No grade deflation (inflation is preferred, but stable grading is fine)\n\n**Location**\n\n* Comfortable weather and tolerable seasons (coming from the hot south)\n* Low travel costs and duration\n* Within or nearby a city with many shopping and entertainment options\n* Relatively inexpensive place to live or own a vehicle\n* Beautiful campus in the middle of nature (trees and ponds)\n\n**Student Life**\n\n* Excellent dining hall food with various options\n* Interactive dorm life and community\n* Clean and modern dorms with air conditioning\n* Large student involvement within clubs and organizations\n* Lively and social campus with happy students\n* Non-stressful or non-competitive environment (common student collaboration)\n* Massive college spirit and pride to attend their university\n* Welcoming community where the majority supports LGBTQ+ and minority rights\n\nIf anyone is willing to read my list and advise me on whether Mudd is the best or worst school for me to attend, it will help with my college decision. I would love to hear firsthand stories that should entice or repulse me from Mudd. For reference, I am still considering Vanderbilt, Cornell, and Rice. If someone does not have enough knowledge of Harvey Mudd but does of any of the other colleges I'm considering, feel free to list the pros and cons of that university.",

            "comment": "I'm 20+ years removed from campus so my answers might be a bit stale, but...\n\nAcademics\n\n* Well-developed and known computer science/engineering program - well-developed sure, and well-known to the right people\n* Have multiple opportunities to study artificial intelligence - see the course catalog for offerings, https://catalog.hmc.edu/. It's also possible to do independent research with a prof\n* Able to conduct research with professors who are top of their field - with profs absolutely, not sure how you'd measure \"top of their field\". If that kind of name recognition is important, maybe Mudd isn't a good fit...\n* Small classroom sizes and low student-faculty ratio (especially within computer science) - some intro courses may have the majority of your class in it (~200 people maybe?) but more advanced courses should have a good teacher/student ratio\n* High average salary after graduation - https://lmgtfy.app/?q=highest+mid-career+salary+colleges\n* High student acceptance into top graduate programs - HMC is well-regarded in the academic world\n* Have professors who value their relationship with students - certainly when I was there.\n* Taught by professors and not teaching assistants (TAs) - 100% prof instruction when I was there. My recitations were taught by profs as well. TAs graded assignments and held extra office hours.\n* No grade deflation (inflation is preferred, but stable grading is fine) - Known for having no grade inflation. I'm not sure I've ever heard of grade deflation (curves getting worse over time? so an A in 1990 is a B+ now?) but Mudd might not be a good fit if you're looking for a gentleman's A.\n\nLocation\n\n* Comfortable weather and tolerable seasons (coming from the hot south) - https://lmgtfy.app/?q=claremont%2C+ca+weather\n* Low travel costs and duration - There are various options on the time-cost continuum. Walking vs. private jet.\n* Within or nearby a city with many shopping and entertainment options - I can't think of any major metropolitan areas within an hour's drive of Claremont.\n* Relatively inexpensive place to live or own a vehicle - Dorms are cheap (and you will probably be able to live on-campus for four years) and I'm not sure how different vehicle ownership cost varies by location\n* Beautiful campus in the middle of nature (trees and ponds) - The campus is beautiful, warts and all. There's a botanical garden close by, and wilderness and 10k+ ft mountains are also close.\n\nStudent Life\n\n* Excellent dining hall food with various options - Many cafeterias around the colleges. Rated in the top 10 from College Student Dining magazine.\n* Interactive dorm life and community - I'm not sure how dorm life could be anything but \"interactive\". I suppose it's up to you to go outside. Get off the VAX...\n* Clean and modern dorms with air conditioning - Rated in the top 10 from College Student Living magazine. #1 for fire resistance, and #3 for proximity to a Walmart where you can buy a window air conditioner. #1 for amazing cleaning staff, but you should really take care of cleaning your own dorm room.\n* Large student involvement within clubs and organizations - There are plenty of student clubs.\n* Lively and social campus with happy students - Campus was quite lively, especially on weekends. There are ~800 people and you'll get to know many of them. Happy students? Lots of work to get done, that can contribute to elevated stress levels.\n* Non-stressful or non-competitive environment (common student collaboration) Stress is high, but when I was there we recognized that we were all in the struggle together, so everyone was supportive. Help was easy to find\n* Massive college spirit and pride to attend their university - Pride? Yes. Spirit? Meh.\n* Welcoming community where the majority supports LGBTQ+ and minority rights - Pretty inclusive while I was there, I'm sure this has only increased over time.\n\n&gt; I would love to hear firsthand stories that should entice or repulse me from Mudd\n\nYou want us to write a persuasive essay for you? This sounds like a job for ChatGPT. I don't have my account handy so we'll try Google's version:\n\n    There are many reasons why you should attend Harvey Mudd College.

            "comment": "I graduated in 2019 so don't know how things changed during the pandemic, but at least as of when I was there:\n\n**Academics**\n\n -  Well-developed and known computer science/engineering program\n   - Yes\n -  Have multiple opportunities to study artificial intelligence\n  - Yes\n -  Able to conduct research with professors who are top of their field\n  - Mudd is undergrad-only, so professors generally prioritize teaching over research and do research with undergrads instead of grad students. This is good for the quality of teaching at Mudd and good for your opportunity to actually be meaningfully involved in research, but it does mean that professors aren't going to be at the top of the field research-wise.\n -  Small classroom sizes and low student-faculty ratio (especially within computer science)\n  - Yes\n -  High average salary after graduation\n  - Yes. This is something Mudd is especially known for.\n -  High student acceptance into top graduate programs\n  - Yes\n -  Have professors who value their relationship with students\n  - Yes. This is something that is especially good at Mudd because it is small and undergrad-only.\n -  Taught by professors and not teaching assistants (TAs)\n  - Yes. TAs are fellow students, and are only involved in grading homework and running tutoring sessions to help with homework. Professors teach all lectures and discussion sections, and have office hours.\n -  No grade deflation (inflation is preferred, but stable grading is fine)\n  - Mudd is generally known for *not* having any grade inflation, although I've heard that may have been somewhat relaxed during the pandemic. Mudd is hard, and most people have several Bs and Cs on their transcript. If you want somewhere you can get an easy \"A\", Mudd is probably not the right school for you. On the other hand, employers (and grad schools) that are familiar with Mudd (which is surprisingly many) know about this and account for it.\n\n**Location**\n\n-   Comfortable weather and tolerable seasons (coming from the hot south)\n  - Southern california weather is amazing. We don't have nearly as much in the way of \"seasons\" as most of the rest of the US. Since Mudd is inland it can get kind of hot in the summer, but it is a dry hot which is much more tolerable. Generally 55-85 F for most of the year, and usually in the 60s-70s.\n-   Low travel costs and duration\n  - Um ... to where? Ontario airport is close and easy to fly in/out of, and is pretty well connected to most major airline hubs. LAX is a bit more of a schlep to get to, but has reasonably-priced flights to just about everywhere.\n  - Or did you mean around campus / etc? Student housing is all in dorms on campus, which are a very short walk / longboard ride from the academic buildings. Mudd's campus is very small, and the entire Claremont Colleges fit in about 1 square mile. Everything is walkable in about 20 minutes or so, and if you're in a hurry you can bike. \n-   Within or nearby a city with many shopping and entertainment options\n  - Well, you're about an hour from most of Los Angeles...\n    Also, downtown Claremont is a 5-minute drive or 30-minute walk and has restaurants and a movie theatre and generally has stuff. And there are other stores around, etc.\n-   Relatively inexpensive place to live or own a vehicle\n  - \"Live\" -- 99% of Mudders live in the dorms (you're required to the first year + unless you have a good reason not to), and unless you're in a dorm with a kitchen (which is not most of them) you're required to be on the meal plan. So most of your housing+food costs are [the room+board cost](https://www.hmc.edu/admission/afford/cost-of-attendance/). \n  - \"Own a vehicle\" -- Frosh are not allowed to have a car on campus. After that, parking permits are relatively affordable. Idk what insurance is like but probably not too different than anywhere else. Gas is kind of expensive, but not too bad. Generally, I would recommend not having a car and relying on Zipcar / trains / walking / biking / friends with cars. It's not practical to drive around campus (too small / not enough roads through it) so you'll only use the car to leave campus and you'll probably end up wanting to spend most of your time hanging out on campus with your friends.\n-   Beautiful campus in the middle of nature (trees and ponds)\n  - It's a very different sort of nature than you'll be familiar with coming from the south, but IMO beautiful in its own way. Mudd's campus may not be the prettiest (our mascot is literally a concrete wart), but you can easily wander around the other 5C campuses. Scripps and Pitzer both have IMO very pretty campuses in their own ways and are right next door. Also, there are several nice hikes in the nearby mountains (in San Bernadino National Forest / the foothills).\n\n**Student Life**\n\n-   Excellent dining hall food with various options\n  - Disclaimer: I heard this changed somewhat during the pandemic, but is probably back to how it was? Not sure. In any case, when I was there --\n\n      Your meal plan gets you into any of the 7 dining halls across the 5 claremont colleges. Different dining halls are actually run by different catering companies and effectively compete for your meal plan dollars, and so they are all forced to keep quality high. The dining hall food is *very* good and you have a lot of options, and if you don't like it you can go to a different dining hall. Check out https://menu.jojodmo.com/ for their live menu.\n-   Interactive dorm life and community\n  - Yes\n-   Clean and modern dorms with air conditioning\n  - Yes. Some of them are somewhat aging, but they're all clean and nothing at Mudd is older than the 1950s (when it was founded). All buildings have air conditioning in every room.\n-   Large student involvement within clubs and organizations\n  - Yes\n-   Lively and social campus with happy students\n  - Yes\n-   Non-stressful or non-competitive environment (common student collaboration)\n  - Yes. This is something Mudd is especially good at -- there is very much a culture of collaboration. However, it can still be stressful at times because Mudd is hard.\n-   Massive college spirit and pride to attend their university\n  - People are definitely proud of being a part of the Mudd community. On the other hand if \"spirit\" refers to sports stuff, most people don't care about sports (we don't even have our own team -- it's shared with Scripps and CMC and mostly run out of CMC).\n-   Welcoming community where the majority supports LGBTQ+ and minority rights\n  - Yes",

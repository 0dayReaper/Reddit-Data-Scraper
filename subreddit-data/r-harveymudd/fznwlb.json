    "postText": "I was curious about the Common Core revision process. According to [this](https://www.hmc.edu/core-revision/2020/03/23/community-update-on-the-core-review-mar-2020/) community update from last month, there are several proposals that are being voted upon.\n\nI know that they are testing a new mathematics Core this year, but I was wondering if anyone was aware of the details of any of these proposed changes. I am very interested. Thanks!",

They are yet to be decided on so there's not a ton of specifics as of now.\n\nEdit: grammar",

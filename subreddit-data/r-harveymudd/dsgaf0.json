I fell in love with the school and its community on my visit, and its why Mudd is my top choice school. I just wanted to see if, with the school being relatively newer compared to some other schools, how its being seen by the public.\n\nI'm completely aware that, to the people that matter, Mudd is one of the best STEM schools in the country. Prestige is just something I was curious about more than anything.",

With that in mind, would you say its reputation is growing faster than other schools?",

I liked that we didn't have graduate school and stayed small, but you can imagine how that limits the recognition.\n\nI'm trying to do my best and make a name for Mudd ahaha, but don't expect it to blow up over the course of a few short years. As /u/mikasaur said, people who know Mudd know Mudd. Otherwise, it's just another name in the myriad of college names.",

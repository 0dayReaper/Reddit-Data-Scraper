Are people open to psychedelics and how common is their usage here? (Specifically shrooms, but also acid)",

If you mean the former, my experience is that few students are willing to try it (this was from my time there around 10 years ago), though you will almost certainly be able to easily find students who use psychedelics. It's not like those students are everywhere though.\n\nMy experience with Mudd is that while they don't condone the use of illegal psychedelic substances, they won't be sending around people to check and usually don't try to stop you unless you present a danger to yourself and/or to others. That being said, if you are involved in any incident that gets the police involved, Mudd will not help you. (Pomona is known to bail their students out of jail, but Mudd does not.)",

It's probably less open than a stereotypical state school but dorms like West, Linde, and maybe North probably have a high majority of people who are very open towards their use. Definitely were a few days where I felt like half my dorm was tripping.\n\nThe school's policies are extremely lax as long as you aren't an idiot about it.",

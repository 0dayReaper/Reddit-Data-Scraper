    "postText": "I'm looking to apply to Harvey Mudd and have a solid application with a 3.9 unweighted GPA and strong extracurricular activities. The only part of my application that falls flat is my standardized test score. I have a 1400 on my second attempt, which is below the school average. I'm also trying to get in for early admission. Should I opt out of sending my score or would it be better to just send it in?",

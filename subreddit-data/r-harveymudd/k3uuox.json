I got an internship between freshman and sophomore year with just 60, but it was a small local company that didn\u2019t have a ton of applications and the job was mostly hardware. Unloading and racking servers, etc. 60 used to teach queues, stacks, DFS, BFS, etc so I had some data structures. \n\nI was able to get a PM internship and Microsoft between sophomore year and junior year with 70 (and 80) but honestly 70 didn\u2019t help as much as my previous internship did.",

I'd taken 70 by the time the internship started, but it would have been a massive help in the interview process. \n\nSince graduating, I have read through stacks of resumes, including a lot of Mudders'. I will say a lot of people scan for \"data structures\" or an equivalent in the relevant coursework section, so the extent to which CS70 is necessary depends on your mode of application. If you have a charming elevator pitch that earns you an interview that others would have to stand out in a stack of resumes to get, CS60 might be enough.",

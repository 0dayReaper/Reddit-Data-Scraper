    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am currently a senior in high school and am deciding between Harvey Mudd and Northwestern for ED. I\u2019d say I am currently leaning towards Harvey Mudd but I (and especially my parents) have a few large concerns that would like to be addressed if possible.\n1. Is HMC really as stressful as it is made out to be? I\u2019ve heard the suicide rates are very high because of the pure pressure you are put upon at HMC with all of the grade deflation and stuff. I\u2019ve also heard that you won\u2019t really have time to do anything else (hobbies, exploring the city, etc) apart from your studies. Like to a point where you won\u2019t even have one free day a week to do whatever you want. Is this true?\n2. There is a very narrow field of study at HMC. It is basically CS (and a couple of engineering) majors only. As of now, I want to major in CS, but what if I changed my mind and wanted to major in let\u2019s say economics or data science instead? HMC doesn\u2019t offer these majors so would I not be able to graduate if that was the case? Or would I just have to grind out a CS degree even if it took a huge toll on me? Or would it be pretty easy to transfer to let\u2019s say CMC if I wanted to do economics instead?",

            "comment": "2019 alumn here -- from my recollection and when I was there... \n\n1. It's hard, but not *that* hard. Most of your time and focus will be classes, homework, and studying, but you will have time to do other things too. I don't know about a whole free day a week, but certainly an hour or two most days and more than that on weekends...\n\n2. Mudd only offers STEM majors -- CS, Engineering, Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and a couple of joint majors. But you can also do an off campus major and do any major offered at one of the other Claremont Colleges. It's not very common and from what I heard can be complicated to figure out and maybe hard to get into intro classes, but I knew a few people that did while I was there, including someone who majored in Econ through CMC. And of course there are several Pitzoids and Scripsies that major in CS through Mudd.",

Most majors at Mudd are indeed CS or engineering; however, the hard sciences are still quite good. If you wanted to major in econ or data science, you could, but you likely have to pivot from a major at Mudd (i.e. CS -&gt; data science). I don't think off campus majors are common, and I probably wouldn't recommend it?",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a Senior this coming school year hoping to apply to HMC and I'm still trying to solidify my schedule. Right now, I have a lot of coursework and extracurricular commitment, so I'm not sure if I can get AP Calc BC into my schedule.\n\nHowever, I was wondering if students need to take through Calc BC in order to be prepared for HMC? Thank you so much!  \n\n\nEDIT: To clarify - I'm a rising High School senior, and I have taken Calc AB. I'm wondering if I need to take BC as well in order to be properly prepared. Thanks!",

A year is a long time to remember math when you don\u2019t use it, and you will be expected to have a very firm grasp on calculus.\n\nI took BC my junior year of high school, and I ended up electing to take remedial/catch up calculus at Mudd in addition to the core calculus class to help myself remember what I\u2019d forgotten. So with just one year of calc a year ago, you\u2019d be in a tougher spot.",

Or would it just be better overall to continue calculus through the entire year (instead of stats) since it's pretty easy to forget math?",

Core seems to do a good job of \u201cevening out the playing field\u201d. I won\u2019t worry about it, essays are IMO much more important.",

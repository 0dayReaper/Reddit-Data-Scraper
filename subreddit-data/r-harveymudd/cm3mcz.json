    "postText": "Hey guys!\n I'm applying to college this year and my counselour advised me to apply to HMC on early decision since I'm interested in computer science. However, I found online that the admission process is very xompetetive and that they don't provide much financial aid for internationals such as me, are these claims true? And also what is the average acceptable sat score?",

            "comment": "Well HMC is a very good school and any good school in the US is going to be competitive to get accepted to. Same goes for financial aid for international students. Schools have a limited amount of money available to give to internationals so it's hard to get. On the other hand, they do want diversity so that works in your favor a little. For SAT scores I would say you definitely want a very good score on the math (as in above 740) and at least around a 700 on the English section, but it's not the most important factor in your application. Make sure you take the appropriate SAT subject tests too.",

I was under the impression that it is difficult to get financial aid as an international student anywhere in the US. (I am from the US so I don't know.) \n\nAdmission to Mudd is indeed very competitive. The admission rate for early decision applicants is much higher though than for regular decision.\n\nFor any early decision school, you should really make sure that you think it is a good match for you before making such a commitment.",

            "comment": "I had a very positive experience at Mudd and would make the same choice again.\n\nThat said, the general engineering degree can be a blessing and a curse. You graduate with more breadth than most but not very much depth in your area of focus. This can be incredibly helpful in deciding what to do for grad school, or knowing what career you want, but can also put you at a disadvantage wrt your peers who have been concentrating on one thing for more than two years. But this might not be too important -- new college grad positions usually require some initial training.\n\nIt can also make it more difficult to course correct if you want to switch away from your initial career path out of school. I started in manufacturing engineering and wanted to switch over to EE, but found that an MSEE was needed to actually make that switch.  I didn't have related experience and my degree was only somewhat relevant.\n\nBut I know my way around mechanical design, which hasn't really helped in my career, but has enabled some fun projects at home.\n\nShould have paid more attention in stems. Turns out that stuff is useful when you least expect it!",

                            "comment": "Ah.\n\nI made a lot of good friends at Mudd who I still hang out with and see today, ten years later. I have a lot of fun stories that came out of Mudd.\n\nIt was also the most incredibly stressful part of my life. Much of it due to the immense workload they place on students. My senior year there were days or weeks at a time where I didn't really sleep in the normal sense. I would take naps when I could, but getting a solid 8 hours didn't happen often. This then starts a feedback loop because without sleep you're not an effective student, and when you're not an effective student you have to work more/longer to keep up. And then you lose more sleep. And so on.\n\nI also had a compounding life event my junior year which made things worse. It is hard to know what Mudd life would have been like had that not happened. \n\nI did not go to grad school and I graduated in 2009, which was a terrible year for the job market. It was hard to find a job and I entered a field that did not really use any of my education I received at Mudd. I could have taken CS5 and CS60 and then started at the job I started at. Though I suppose the point of a liberal education is to teach you how to think and learn, not necessarily put direct lessons to use like in a trade school. I had a very low salary compared to what I thought I was going to get out of Mudd ($50,000/yr in the SF Bay Area). \n\nI don't know where any of my coworkers went to school. No one gives a shit in your job. They just want you to be good at what you do. Maybe grad schools care. But I didn't go so I wouldn't know. \n\nI don't know. I'm going back for my ten-year reunion this weekend so obviously there's some nostalgia within me. But whenever they ask for donations I give only a small amount, and I always write that I want them to put it towards leisure and fun activities. \n\nI also know people who never pulled all-nighters and got enough sleep to go for morning runs. And they actually did very well. Maybe they were just better at time management than I was. Probably so. And I know people who don't regret it for even a second. \n\nI would ask yourself why you want to go to Mudd. If it's just because you think it'll look good on a resume someday then think very hard about that. If you know you don't have the best time management skills think very hard about that. Also know that life is not about achievements but about the relationships you make and the time you spend with friends and family. You'll develop those relationships at Mudd, but a lot of it comes from the cameradie of making it through Mudd. \n\nI could type on and on. If you want to have a one-on-one convo about it I'm happy to do that with you at some point. PM me.",

            "comment": "I think most people would agree that there is a lot of work, so most people are sleep deprived (at least certain semesters) and some people get really burnt out. It's fine if you have a good support network and are doing well, but if something bad happens it can make it really hard to cope (for example, I developed an autoimmune disease while there and it was a really hard semester for me to stay on top of things while going to the hospital for a lot of tests). The core classes can be really hard for some people, so you might work hard and still get C's or something, and that can be really hard for your self-esteem.\n\nI had a very good experience there-- mostly enjoyed my classes, did not have my self esteem hurt (not that classes were all smooth sailing, but I always made sure to meet with professors if I was having trouble), made great friends, really liked research. I did have some semesters where I'd have 6 hrs/night of sleep most nights and 2 hrs one night a week. However, I usually took 18.5 units, generally with an additional course that I was auditing, a couple PE classes, and a multiple clubs/work study, so it was partially my fault that I was getting so little sleep. Had sleep been my priority, I think it would be possible, but it would've meant I missed out on some things that were important to me. Anyway, I do remember some really hard times of stress/exhaustion, but overall I was really happy to be there still. My husband went to Mudd too (though that's not where we met!), and he enjoyed it as well, but he also overloaded every semester and always says he wished that he had just taken fewer classes and spent more time on each to really focus on them and learn more.\n\nIn retrospect the part of Mudd that served me the least is that by not having grad students, I really didn't know what I was getting into when I chose to go to grad school. Also, I had an inferiority complex because I had actually had very few classes in the field I chose for my PhD due to doing a split major, studying abroad, and taking all the core and humanities classes. I felt really behind everyone in my grad school cohort, and that impostor syndrome stayed with me and really impeded my progress.\n\nHowever, in retrospect I do not think that I was less knowledgeable than the average person in my cohort, it's just that it's easy to look at the best of everyone and the worst of yourself (like in a discussion group, everyone brings up something that they know, and so you assume that everyone knows ALL those things, whereas actually probably everyone just knows ONE of those things). And the fact that there were no grad students at Mudd is one of its best features-- you can graduate being on papers, even as a first author which is basically  impossible elsewhere. After going to grad school and seeing the role of undergrads in our labs and how removed they were from professors in their classes (with us as TAs) I felt really bad for them. \n\nI think it's important to think about your support network and your personality... what would you do if you were getting a bad grade in a class despite working hard? Would that break you or would you be able to focus on what you're learning instead of the grade? What do you do when you have to take a class that you don't really like, but it's required? How good are you at managing time?",

I have great stats but since I\u2019ve recently found my passion for stem my ecs are lacking.\n\nAnything is helpful!\n\nAlso curious what your ecs were?",

My GPA was good in general but below the average for Mudd accepted students, and my ACT was 35. I'm super into the arts, so my ecs were choir all through high school and musical theater through most of high school as well, as well as a 3-year research course at my school (STEM).\n\nMy first semester is going well but a couple pieces of advice: If you're used to being the smartest kid in your class, give up on that, that's not how it works at Mudd. The environment is collaborative not competitive and no one is the best at everything. Also everyone is busy all the time so you gotta fight for the free time you have. Overall I've found my time at Mudd to be super socially and academically fulfilling tho.",

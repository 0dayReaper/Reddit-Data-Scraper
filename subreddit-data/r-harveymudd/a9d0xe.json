I\u2019d say the majority of cs classes I\u2019ve taken I have worked in pairs for a lot of the assignments. Also not many classes curve. Often tests are hard, but the curve is pretty minimal so if everyone does well, then everyone gets A\u2019s. Level of stress should likely decrease in the near future as they\u2019re working on revamping the curriculum due to heavy stress complaints two years ago.",

One change I know is they plan on no longer doing half semester math classes as part of core. The amount of time required for math is still the same (3 semesters), but they hope that by not cutting it up so much it won't have as many tests and feel too fast paced. Content wise the only math dropped is stats (mostly for being strongly disliked and people feeling they don't learn much in it). Not sure what other changes will occur.

    "postText": " Hello! I'm an international applying to HMC and a supplement essay prompt has put me in deep confusion. The prompt says \" Tell us about your dream HSA class\", I've done some research about the available HSA classes, but my concern is: should I write this essay about some of the available HSA classes at HMC or just describe my ideal HSA class? And if its the secons option, is it ok for me to make a refference to some exisisting HSA classes?",

            "comment": "You should describe your ideal HSA class.\n\nYou can reference existing classes if you want to, but the purpose of the essay is not to talk about which of the HSA classes you will want to take if you are admitted. If you do choose to reference existing classes, I personally would limit it to certain aspects of these classes you find particularly appealing, and then perhaps talk about how you would like to see those aspects implemented in your ideal class.",

Show your desire to learn. And make it interesting while you're at it. If you can do this with an essay about a class that already exists, go for it. But the route with... more options and methods to show that is probably not that. That's all.",

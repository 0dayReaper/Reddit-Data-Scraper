    "postText": "I am trying to decide between UCLA or Harvey Mudd for studying biology. Assuming fees is not a consideration, how would you compare two schools especially for research opportunities and breadth of biology options. I see that very few kids at HM study bio. Any help will be helpful.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not a biology major, so I won\u2019t be the most helpful. However, I think the perks of choosing Mudd over UCLA is going to be having really hands-on and personal experiences with the department in terms of research, professors, and courses. Considering there aren\u2019t many bio majors at Mudd, you basically get the entire department to yourself and you get to know everyone and grow close to them. (Mind you there aren\u2019t a lot of pure bio majors but there are plenty of biochem or math+cs+bio, which are more popular.) Anyways, I\u2019d imagine this tight-knit community will be super amazing when you apply for grad schools and need recommendations from professors.\n\nOn the other hand, the perks of choosing UCLA over Mudd for bio is that you have so many more interesting courses and research to partake in. I know my roommate was quite upset at the small selection of bio classes he could take, so you should keep that in mind. There\u2019ll also be a lot more research happening that is perhaps more cutting-edge and fascinating, but I\u2019ve heard it can be hard to compete with other students.\n\nAt the end of the day, UCLA has way more options than Mudd. However, Mudd will give you personal attention and sort of hold your hand throughout your time here, which is amazing and why I\u2019m glad to be here. If you\u2019re good standing on your own tho and you\u2019re one of the better students, then UCLA may have more to offer. Also, not to dog on Mudd too much, but you may feel left out not being a CS-flavored or Engineering major since the school and students focus on those things.",

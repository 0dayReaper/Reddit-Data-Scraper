    "postText": "I'm from Norway and study mathematics here at the moment, but I'm considering applying for a transfer to HMC. I'm looking at the math courses available and I do not really know how credits work at US colleges. Most of the 3 credit courses seem to be full semesters, so I'm assuming that's always the case for 3 credit courses (proof by induction would probably serve better than an assumption but whatever). My question is this: how many courses do students at HMC take per semester if they take the \"normal\" amount?",

I've been in contact with HMC and as you say, two years at my current university would equal one year at HMC, mainly because my university is very focused in its adademic programs, unlike a liberal arts college. \n\nHowever, I will also look into the possibility to being an exchange student at HMC for one semester, maybe even two. That is the reason why I asked about the courses, because in order to do so, the first step for me is to acquire a pre-approval for a set of courses that I would take. I will look into the exchange-student possibility regardless, but do you know anyone who has been visiting HMC for a semester or two as an exchange student?",

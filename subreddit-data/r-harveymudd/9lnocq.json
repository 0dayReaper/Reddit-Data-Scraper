You couldn't go to the job fair and not feel as if you made the wrong choice, picking anything but CS. Further, the CS job fair isn't exclusive for the students, just the companies. By all means, if you wanted to, you are allowed and encouraged to attend the CS fair as a non-CS major.",

When I was a student I had plenty of support from the CS department and from the general career services department and was very satisfied with my internships.\n\nSome particulars I know of: Yelp's engineering department has a ton of Mudders (the new head of engineering, Jason F., is a former Southie) and DreamHost is founded by and largely run by Mudders. There are also Mudd alum groups at Google and Microsoft if you're more into megacorps.",

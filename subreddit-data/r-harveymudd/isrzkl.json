            "comment": "I'd have a really good answer to the question \"Why Mudd?\" It sounds so obvious, but a strong response goes a long way. Steer clear of answers that dwell on why you're pursuing STEM. It goes without saying that you're interested in STEM if you're applying to Mudd. Your interviewer wants to hear why you're interested in _Mudd_. Some scaffolding questions you might consider: \n\n- Where do you want to be professionally in 5, 10, 20 years, _and how will Mudd help you get there?_\n\n- What impact do you want to have on the world, _and how will your Mudd education help you achieve that?_\n\nBe sure to hit the italicized portions. Your passion for STEM should help motivate your explanation for why you want to go to Mudd.\n\nAt the end, your interviewer will almost certainly ask if you have any questions for them. Not having any is a red flag that you're not really interested, so be sure to ask something. \n\nFor generic interview advice, Google typical interview questions and make sure you've at least thought about them. You might be asked about a time when you struggled with teamwork or failed to meet an objective, and handling these questions well demonstrates maturity and humility. You want to seem confident in your abilities but not arrogant. Reflecting on things you could have, and more importantly _will_, do better is good. Don't be afraid to be honest. Mudd is hard, and you will need to have a growth mindset to succeed. Put that on display so your interviewer knows you can succeed and be an asset to the community. \n\nIf you struggle with anxiety buildup right before important events, stand in a power pose (like a super hero would), and breathe for 5 minutes beforehand. I like to breathe in for 4, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. If that's too hard, just extend your exhale for as long as you can. Lastly, remember that you earned this interview, and you've got this! Good luck, and I hope it goes well! \n\n- Physics '17 alumna",

I would do your best to not come off as scripted because it definitely detracts from your authenticity, so even if you have answers in mind to the generic questions, run through them a bit so they sound more natural :)\n\n'21 CS/Econ",

Be prepared to talk about yourself, especially anything that would contribute to the small community that Mudd is.\nShow off your personal skills. You will most likely see the interviewer all the years you\u2019re there, and maybe even beyond. \nThey\u2019re the gatekeeper to the awesomeness that Mudd is. Bring your cool. \n-engineering, last century",

            "comment": "I've interviewed for a number of years now, as a senior interviewer with the admissions office and now as an alum. I agree with most of the other comments. I personally never ask directly \"why mudd?\" I prefer more targeted questions. My goal when I do the interview is to figure out what interests and values you have and how the school will meet those values. Be sure you understand the unique aspects of this institution and cite them -- this is especially important if you are applying early. The only times people have \"failed\" their interview with me were when the vibe I just got was \"I want to study computer science and I heard this a good school for computer science\". Don't list your entire \"resume\" of things you are/have been involved in. Pick a few and explain them in depth. Come up with some questions for the interviewer. \n\nMy final generic advice is \"don't worry about it.\" Treat it as a time to interact with someone who goes/went to the school and to get a feel for what it's like to be a student there. The best interviews feel like a conversation and not a question-answer session.",

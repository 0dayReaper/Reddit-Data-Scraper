    "postText": "Hi, this is a throwaway account.  I'm a HS junior in New Jersey and I'm curious about the scholarship opps. According to the net price calculator, my need would be covered with the exception of 10k.  I'm planning on studying Theatre and Education.  Do many scholarships go to these majors? ",

            "comment": "Scholarships here aren't often (to my knowledge, anyway) given due to an intended major. People often change their plans once they reach here and explore throughout Div I, a lot can change during a Div II. Scholarships can be given due to academic success (such as the Bell Ringer Scholarship or the Presidential Scholarship), but scholarships are awarded to students with demonstrated financial need FIRST. I think that there are some scholarships that go to STEM students/transfers, but I think those are the only scholarships for specified students, the rest are open to the entire incoming population. With Hampshire being such a new school, they don't have a huge endowment to work from - fewer alumni means fewer donations. They try to do what they can, but the money is usually focused on financial need instead of just merit.\n\n[This is the page on Hampshire's website that talks about scholarships](http://www.hampshire.edu/admissions/3496.htm)\n\nOne thing that is worth noting is that the earlier you apply, the more likely you will be to get a scholarship. Those who apply Early Decision (or maybe even Early Action) are given first consideration for merit scholarships, as they show a definite interest and devotion to attending Hampshire.\n\nDon't let the costs of Hampshire deter you. They offered me close to a $50k financial aid package (which left ~$11000 for me to deal with in private loans, which added up to ~$18000 total loans for my first year), which I thought was pretty great for me, and if I had chosen a state school, I probably would be paying just as much. If you really love Hampshire, it's worth applying to see just how much they can give you. Though it's sensible to evaluate finances, don't let money deter you from achieving your goals. There are always outside scholarships as well; I know that there are a TON out there for future educators, speak to your guidance counselor or poke around online to find opportunities.\n\nBest of luck to you! PM me if you have any questions about Hampshire, I'm happy to share. Maybe I'll see you around in a couple of years!",

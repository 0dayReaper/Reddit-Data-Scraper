I'm aware of many of the student groups and such that Hampshire has to offer, but what are your favorites? Are there any 'hidden gems'? What are your favorite offerings from the other schools/the Amherst area? In other things, what are some must-take classes or professors? ",

But yeah, what are you interested in, activity-wise?  Might I suggest playing with power tools in Lemelson as much as humanly possible?\n",

            "comment": "1) Take a class with at least one of the following instructors: Will Ryan, Aaron Berman, Ernie Alleva. Also, take a class at Lemelson before you graduate. You'll probably never have access to that kind of facility again.\n\n2) Go to Hampshire Halloween and Spring Jam.\n\n3) During finals, go work in the design room in EDH at night. It's the room that looks like an architecture studio. Nobody is in there after dinner time, and the drawing tables are great for having multiple books open/spreading out research materials. Plus, the plasma TV is big enough to type up papers/design layouts from across the room.",

I'm very into music, and I got a show at the Yurt(our campus radio station) and I had a BLAST with it. As for student groups, it's the same thing, what are your interests? Maybe I can pick some out, because for such a small school, we have a huge amount of student groups.\n\nBoth Amherst Center and Northampton are pretty good hangout spots, NoHo in particular. Plenty of awesome local food and shopping there.\n\nIf you're at all interested in creative writing or theater, taking a class with Ellie Donkin would be my advice. She's by far the best professor I've had so far at Hamp. If you're into natural science, taking a Lynn Miller class is a great(however difficult) experience.",

Joanna Morris is also awesome, but opinions on her are mixed. She uses a lot of Project Runway metaphors to teach neuro and she's really sassy, but I'm down with both those things. ",

Once you do the shop safety training, you can start learning how to use the tools around the shop, or join one of the student groups (Blacksmithing and/or Glassblowing).  If you've got an idea for a project but don't know where to start, Design Conspiracy (which I'll be signing for in the spring) can help you out.  It's worth noting that you don't need to do the safety training to go to Design Conspiracy.  ",

From what I've read, I find Ms. Benvenuto to be much more in the wrong than her ex-husband, and her book to be disgustingly written. I appreciate that you Hampsters were notifying people that the book was crap- the excerpt on The Guardian is certainly enough to show that.\n\nFurther links for lazy: [Interview with Joy Ladin for Capital New York](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/03/5481406/joy-ladin-first-trans-professor-yeshiva-discusses-her-transition-her?page=all)\n\n[Jewish blog with excerpts from Ladin's memoir](http://velveteenrabbi.blogs.com/blog/2012/05/joy-ladins-through-the-door-of-life.html)\n\n[Article about the divorce on the website of Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders](http://www.glad.org/transgender-family-law/stories/divorce-court-cant-deal-with-a-different-category-of-spouse/)\n\nEdit 2: I look forward to seeing any coverage in The Climax that may happen. I'm gonna go study for my own finals now.",

This is a pretty dumb thing to post on a Hampshire forum\n\nEdit: Ok, so it looks like you're a babby who doesn't know what they're talking about. Carry on.\n",

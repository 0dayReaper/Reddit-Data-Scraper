    "postText": "*from a bulletin I posted on the Hampshire Gaming Steam Group*\n\nSo, after much lollygagging, I have reinstated the Hampshire Minecraft server @ minecraft.hampshire.edu. It is running v. 1.0.1.\n\nAs some of you may know, the co-owner of the server, and owner of the group, TomatoJustice, graduated, and what's more, he seems to be spending his time doing meaningful things like going to graduate school, studying, and generally not updating this page or anything.\n\nThis, in the absence of any formal record of lineage, would make me the successor. HOWEVER, I am, as we speak, entering the more difficult part of my DivIII. I cannot spend much time doing stuff like running the Minecraft server.\n\nIF SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO MANAGE AND RESTORE THE HAMPSHIRE GAMING SERVER(s), THE POSITION IS OPEN. We have a tower which was running TF2, and the server running Minecraft (might have other hardware kicking around). It doesn't even have to be those games. I'd just like to see my time at Hampshire having made impact at least in the most frivolous things I've done here.\n\nPlease message me if you'd like to get involved, here or on Steam.\n\n-- Derridad/Deleuzer",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I was accepted as a fall transfer this spring and continue to be excited, but have gotten to be very apprehensive after digging deeper into the comments on websites like niche and studentsreview. A good number of these reviews make Hampshire sound less like the alternative, open-minded and inspiring, ultimately human place that I have previously perceived and more like some terrifying fuckfest of satanism, sexual fetishes, and mental illness. I knew it was weird going in; one of the reasons I wanted to go so badly was because I have always identified as one of the weirdos. I'm the product of a deadhead family with strong ties to Western Massachusetts and thought Hampshire was a perfect fit. Unfortunately, what I'm seeing is that the student body, according to the internet, crosses the line between \"good weird\" (artistic eccentrism) and \"bad weird\" (Adam Lanza and co.). This has me worried to say the least. Those of you who see this- what is your impression? Am I just psyching myself out, or are these fears founded?\n\nEdit: I'm sorry if this post was offensive in any way to any current students; I still plan on attending and am beyond excited to do so! I love it up there and the surrounding area means a lot to me as far as locations go. It hasn't been my intention to antagonize the student body, only get some insider input as to the credibility of the anonymous posts that I've seen vociferously condemning Hamp as a collective entity. I'm not too swayed by them, just curious.\n\n",

Hamp is an amazing place, except for a bunch of people who take leftist politics waaaaay to far (in order to seem \"cool\") I am pretty right leaning and I still have a lot of friends and I enjoy studying here immensely ",

I'm really happy to hear the opinion of somebody who isn't disillusioned enough with the school to actively write a scathing review on a college blog- I was worried those sites might be more than a little biased. \n\nThis is exactly what I needed to hear. I'm a godless liberal myself, but my sister is a militant tumblr user and I can't stand that culture, so I'm glad to find out that there are other, less pathologically aggressive people on the campus. Either way, thanks again for the input and maybe I'll unwittingly run into you on campus in a couple of months!",

There's a slight culture shock at first, especially during orientation where you'll learn about all the -isms that exist. \nThat part is definitely a lot to handle, however not everyone is 100% adhering to the Tumblr lifestyle. I just had my first year and I can honestly say it was the best year of my life. Stick with Hampshire and I really don't think you'll be upset. You'll be getting yourself a one of a kind educational experience. Plus you get to eat apples in the summer so that's tight.",

            "comment": "I'm a freshman going into Hampshire this fall, and I understand your worries, though I'm not particularly nervous about these issues. If you want a good laugh/scare about Hampshire, take a look at this book: [Don't Follow Me, I'm Lost: A Memoir of Hampshire College at the Twilight of the '80s](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Follow-Me-Lost-Hampshire/dp/1592405851). I haven't read this book, just find the blurb amusing. Plus, the author is pretty spiteful of Hampshire and ended up transfering if I'm correct, and I'm sure Hampshire has changed a lot since the '80s.\n\nI think Hampshire can definitely be the right place for you. It has incredible educational opportunities and a great, accepting community, despite some \"Tumblr militants,\" as you said. I am also pretty liberal, but not an extreme social justice warrior. I think that people will tend to gravitate towards others with similar views and interests, and the reason why you've heard of people with sexual fetishes and Satanic views at Hampshire is because they feel comfortable enough in the community to be open about it. This means in no way that you have to engage with them, or that they will pressure/convert you, although maybe the social justice people will.\n\nI think about it this way: if I decided to go to a less liberal school than Hampshire, I may have decided to apply for feminist housing, whereas at Hampshire that just sounds exhausting, as most people there in general seem to be feminists and those in the feminist mods would likely be extreme.\n\nHope my rambling helps soothe your worries a bit. Also, I was excited to see some activity in the Hampshire subreddit! Maybe I'll see you this fall!",

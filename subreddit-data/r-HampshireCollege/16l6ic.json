    "postText": "Hey Hampshire Redditors! You're all probably sick of prospective students posting on this sub, so I'll try to make this as brief as I can.\n\nI'm a high school senior from Wichita, KS. I've just recently sent in my application to Hampshire College, which is by far my top choice. I'm applying to other schools, but essentially they're all just back-ups if I don't get into Hampshire. I've heard opposing things on College Prowler, College Data, etc. about the ease of getting into Hampshire; some people saying that they look for only certain types of students, other people saying pretty much anyone can get in. I know the acceptance rate last year was 71%, but I have no idea where I fall among other applicants. So here is my info:\n\nI got a 29 on the ACT. I play tennis, have a cashiering job, and work as a volunteer intern at a local museum (history is my interest). I started a recycling program at my middle school (thought that would appeal to the school's progressivism). I wrote a pretty good personal statement, sent a very good analysis essay over \"A Tale of Two Cities\", and got a great teacher rec. letter from my English teacher who knows me very well. AP &amp; Honors, all dat tasty stuff..BUT, my Achilles heel..I have a cumulative GPA of about 2.3 right now. There were things going on at home that distracted me from school a lot of sophomore and junior year, which I made sure to explain in my personal statement. However, last semester (fall of senior year) I got all A's which was great. I also made a video for the optional supplement of the application to show 'em I mean business.\n\nSo, you know my question: Do I have a shot? The notification is April 1st, but I'd like to get the opinion of someone at the school so I know how seriously I should apply for these back-ups.\n\nThanks very much, highly appreciated!\n\n ",

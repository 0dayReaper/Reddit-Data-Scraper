    "postText": "\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHampshire's 49th spring Commencement ceremony is just minutes away. We barely need to mention what a momentous occasion this is. We stand, as ever, in awe of this magnificent community.\n\nFor the past two days, the Hampshire family at large has been engaged in an extraordinary fund-raising effort through the #Div4ward challenge. \u00a0\n\nThe response has been breathtaking. An alum offered a dollar-for-dollar match and together you met that challenge to bring in $500,000. **Then a group of trustees and alums pushed you last night and now, including the matching funds, our total is $755,280.** With eight hours left in the challenge, the gifts are still coming in, and we can't wait to see what our community can do together.\n\n[**Make your gift**](http://donate.hampshire.edu)\n\nNot only does a gift provide much needed financial support, but it also demonstrates that all of us \u2014 trustees, parents, faculty, staff, alums, and friends of the College \u2014 are determined to secure Hampshire's future.\n\nWhen this year's 295 graduates cross the stage, the world will receive something it needs so very much: Hampshire thinkers, innovators, problem-solvers, and experimenters \u2014 passionate people with ethics, empathy, and a commitment to social justice.\n\nThank you for your love for and support of Hampshire College.\n\nKen Rosenthal, interim president  \nLuis Hernandez 70F, interim chair of the board of trustees",

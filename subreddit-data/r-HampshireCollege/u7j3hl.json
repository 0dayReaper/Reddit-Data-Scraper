I'm a longtime food delivery driver in Amherst, and I've almost never had a problem before when delivering to Merrill\u2014I just meet the customer at the loading dock off of the laundry room.  However, within the last week or so a customer who, IIRC, lives in Merrill A, \\[and\\] didn't know how to get there without going outside.  I know that, unlike Dakin, the halls are not connected above the basement.  B and C are connected directly to the laundry room in the basement, but what about A (I thought it was connected through the basement hall of B)?",

You can go from A4 or C4 to the B-basement without ever leaving the building. No need to go outside in the winter in order to do your laundry.\n\n\u2014[Merrill House](https://www.hampshire.edu/housing/merrill-house), hamshire.edu",

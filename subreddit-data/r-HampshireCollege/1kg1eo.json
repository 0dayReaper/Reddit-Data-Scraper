I'm going to be in Merrill A, 4th floor which is the CESC LLC, and my professors this semester are Cox, Keough, Alleva, and Wald. Alleva will be my advisor.\n\nPlus anything else I should know as a first year. Thanks very much!",

I'll see if I've taken any of them and give some tips if I have :D\n\nMy biggest general tip is to get to know the people you're living with. Embrace the fact that you're stuck with them. I met my best friends in my hall first semester, now we're gonna be in a mod together.\n\nAnother tip is that orientation, while it may seem kinda dumb at times, is a good way to get to know people you're going to be in at least one class with. The tutorial class is always pretty easy, but its helpful to have peers you are comfortable with in said class, thus getting to know your orientation group.\n\nFinally, just be open to things. Hampshire is a really weird place with a lot of really weird people. Embrace our silly little school in the middle of the woods and the wide array of personalities that flock there.",

I've never been on campus, but I get a feeling there is an ever-present spirit within the community, like just being in such a place changes everyone's general feeling. Basically, being there alone will help me feel more open to things.\n\nMy classes, respective to the order of professors listed above, are Philosophy as a Way of Life, Understanding Culture and Power, Moral Philosophy (tutorial), and Renaissance Europe.\n\nYou wouldn't happen to also know anything about the CESC LLC, would you..? I'm excited to be in it, but this is the program's first year, and there is very little info on it. :/\n\nThanks, RMeiselman! What are your Hampshire stats (year, division, concentration, residence this year, etc.)?",

I have some experience with clubs(namely The Yurt - Hampshire's radio station, and Mythos - our roleplay/fight eachother with foam weapons club).",

I read some good reviews on RateMyProfessor, so I think the teachers I have will be a good fit.\n\nSorry, it's the Community Engagement for Social Change Living and Learning Community. I didn't expect you to know much since it's brand new this year, that was just a longshot.\n\nLet's see..I would definitely listen to some Yurt radio, what types of things are on, and when? There are just so many clubs and groups at Hampshire, I'd like to try out several of them, though I know that's unrealistic. I used to play Ultimate and would love to return to it, so maybe that? Also maybe the history enthusiasts group. Is there a club or group for students who want to play an active role in campus community, meeting with administration to help get a student's perspective on how to improve Hampshire, kind of envisioning a future, that type of thing? Maybe a student government, but anything else?",

[Re-Rad](https://hampedia.org/wiki/Re-Rad) also seems right up your alley, and if you're interested in improving the spaces on campus you should also look into [Rehamping](https://hampedia.org/wiki/Rehamping).  Hope that helped!",

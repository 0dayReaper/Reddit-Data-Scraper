    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm wondering: have any other students had issues with professors at Hampshire who seem pretty out of touch with material/economic conditions outside of the ecosystem of the college? For example, have any of you encountered staff or faculty who can quote Marx on a dime, but also off-handedly remark that $17/hr is a live-able wage, or offhandedly dismiss unionization within the local community?\n\nThis has happened to me *several* times and it's deeply concerning on many levels:\n\n1. It severely limits the faith I have in their their ability to guide my thinking towards liberatory action (the type that is embedded in the Hampshire brand and purported mission) and help me think towards a post-cap future.\n2. There is a serious disconnect between what they say in theory-land and what they say in casual conversation, hence, limitting their ability to understand students (i.e. students living in extreme poverty who are increasingly unable to pay for rent in the Valley, for health insurance, and whose job prospects are incredibly limited post-Hampshire unless they have the family resources to do something like intern as a journalist for 3 years, something often required to gain entrance to the increasingly competitive/precarious industry).\n\nI mean, I know that most of them are Gen X or Boomers, and going to grad school 20-40 years ago was another story, etc, etc. And I know that they were able to start families and acquire housing in an environment that is now completely unrecognizable to those seeking similar educational/career/life paths, but sometimes I'm honestly shocked about what they don't know and expose via offhanded remarks.\n\nObviously I'm upset, but I'm not trying to vent so much as connect to other students who have experienced the same sort of thing.\n\nMaybe this will only be applicable for students some years out of Hampshire who don't have financial support and are having to reckon with debt and an insane job and housing market, but maybe it'll be applicable for others as well.\n\nAnyways, DM me if you can speak to this, hope ya'll are well out there!",

I don\u2019t remember ever having issues with professors not understanding my economic reality.  In fact I remember staff and faculty  going above and beyond to help me when I couldn\u2019t afford supplies for photography, like getting extensions when I needed to work triple hours on work-study so I could buy paper or film and what not.",

            "comment": "I'm F98 and this was a HUGE issue even then. Not just the faculty but staff too.\n\nI would go to the career center looking for info on jobs and how to write a resume and instead of sharing anything about that, they'd try to sell me expensive internships. Like, \"You can save the rainforest for only eight thousand dollars this summer!\" I'm like, \"Hello? I'm broke and I need to eat? I need a place to live?\"\n\nThe faculty were the worst. I was coming from an abusive family situation and was dealing with a lot of shit. They seemed to pick up on the fact that I hadn't had it as easy as a lot of the students there and seemed to really look down on me for it, despite their stated political views. They acted really snooty, wouldn't let me talk in class, and would lie about me in their evaluations or just take quotes from my essays out of context to make me look bad, sometimes editing them to make my writing look weaker.\n\nA lot of them seemed to advocate a very anti-intersectional kind of 2nd wave feminism, combined with an equivalent form of Marxism. Diversity and life experiences different from their own were met with attacks and evaluations were leveraged to slander students. There was no oversight and we had no recourse when this happened.\n\nI had some good experiences with some faculty members, but overall, the place felt like a weird, stuffy cultish bubble.\n\nThey were anti-creativity too. I kept wanting to do more with my Div III and take more kinds of classes, but they kept placing limits on what I could study with no explanation given. I felt like I was being blacklisted from society - robbed of the opportunities I had worked so hard for in spite of my circumstances.\n\nI definitely wasn't the only one who had that kind of experience during that time. It seemed like a lot of people were angry and frustrated with the faculty, and there was a lot of negativity on campus as students dealt with that in different ways.\n\nI really like the idea of Hampshire, but the implementation is way off. Or at least it was at the end of the 90s.",

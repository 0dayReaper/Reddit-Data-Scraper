    "postText": "My mid-semester evals were pretty positive, and I'm not worried about most of my classes except for a NS class with a visiting professor. I've missed class a lot for medical reasons, but was only recently able to get in touch with the OARS office, so I don't have accommodations regarding missed classes. The professor is very nice, but I don't know how forgiving she will be. She knows that I have been having medical issues, but I have not discussed my class performance with her. Just wondering how this will affect my final evaluation from her.",

            "comment": "Honestly, when I was at school I always found the best solution to these sorts of problems was to schedule a meeting with the professor and talk all of this out. If they are dismissing or diminishing the seriousness of your medical issues, schedule another meeting with the professor and either your advisor or a rep from OAR. \n\nThis is the sort of thing that can make it into your eval (\"student missed a number of classes due to illness\"), but by working with the professor and being honest about your issues, the professor will try and frame it in a positive light (\"but student worked hard to make up lost lecture time and ultimately this did not affect the quality of students final project\").

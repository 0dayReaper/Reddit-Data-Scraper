    "postText": "Hello there,\n\nHampshire is currently my daughters first choice for college and she was just given an acceptance letter along with a generous grant/financial aid package which we are both very happy about. We have a pretty good sense that she will do well there as a self-directed &amp; motivated student- my question is more to see whether Hampshire will be a stable environment for her with it\u2019s rocky recent past and financial instability. How is teacher and student morale overall? How is the food? Anything else you can share would be appreciated.",

Between Hampshire and the Five Colleges there still isn't much that a self-directed and motivated student can't find some way to accomplish here.\n\nThat might sound like an admissions pitch but Hampshire is a really specific place. It offers a lot of opportunities, but it isn't for everyone - in my experience if this is someone's first choice school, it's usually for good reason.",

            "comment": "Hampshire has never had money. While the current situation is difficult, it\u2019s not really that out of the ordinary in the grand scheme of the school\u2019s history. Hampshire has been great with few resources for decades now. (Speaking as an F09, graduated in 2013).\n\nFYI, for your daughter\u2019s info though, Hampshire is 100% as self directed as they claim it is. There is no safety net. If you miss an important deadline as a student, no one is going to come breath down your neck about it, you just won\u2019t progress anywhere and wallow instead. The carrot and the stick must come from within. The school will not provide either.\n\nI would also like to add to what one of the other commenters said about wheeling and dealing.  Its very true.  To succeed at Hampshire, you must learn how to wheel and deal.  You want to study something?  Well go find a professor and convince them to help you with it.  Then find a second to help out too as your committee member.  Find resources/ grants etc on campus or elsewhere to make the project happen.  I had friends at Hampshire who didn't do well with that structure and transferred away, but I think its actually a much more valuable teaching experience than the usual university way.  Life is like that.  Its on you to convince people to help you with your ideas in the real world as well.  These hidden skills of convincing people to help you with your ideas and then collecting people and resources to make them happen, I would argue, is really the value of a Hampshire education.  Those sort of skills can be applied to anything down the road.",

            "comment": "Hampshire has had a very turbulent history mainly due to how small it is, it's experimental system and structure and unfortunate, unprecedented events like COVID and failed merging (which was bad).  However, it has the support of four other big schools, like UMass Amherst and Amherst, Mount Holyoke and Smith colleges. I imagine those schools who were the reason Hampshire exists today would never let Hampshire go under. I feel Hampshire is going to be around forever and because of the unique ways the administration handles issues they usually come out of serious issues stronger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe food is pretty good. It used to be awful from 2017 until 2019 in my opinion, but they got. better. The truth behind that is students stopped buying full meal plans so the school had to cut back on good food. This direct words from one of their dining commons managers. But over all, I really enjoyed it and was as good as UMass's at times and UMass is #1 college food in America. \n\nThe teacher and student morale is great. I've run across some crummy teachers, but again, I've seen crummy teachers at UMass. Having taken classes at all Five Colleges, no college seems to have worse teachers. So where ever you daughter goes, she will run across one bad professor, but at Hampshire most are exceptional and want to help you succeed.  I'd be willing to name a few (via private message) at Hampshire to absolutely avoid who showed no interested or were downright mean. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt Hampshire, it is a very motivated environment. Students HAVE to keep on top of their work. There is no professor telling your child \"Susan, your DIV I portfolio is due tomorrow, don't forget to hand it in.\". None of that. They will give deadlines and assign work, but expect to find many classes structuring assignments in a very open-ended way. This is to make the student think. It's very different and you may be lost during the first few days, but my advice would be to just think hard and good about it. If you really are lost, email professors, They will respond, or should and clarify their assignments because they under many are new to Hampshire's system. It would be cruel if they refused to clarify. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want any more info or have any more questions, feel free to private message me your questions! I love advertising Hampshire and bringing in new students.  This school must be around forever. It has helped me in so many ways and has helped me get job offers, and even rethink how I do any kind of work. Hampshire has done wonders.",

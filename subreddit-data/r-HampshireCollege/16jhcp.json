    "postText": "I attended my freshman year at Emerson College, but found its classes to be extremely unfulfilling. I remember visiting Hampshire for a day back when I was looking at colleges, and being interested in the classes a lot, but I don't remember much.\n\n\u2022 Why do you like Hampshire? Academics, atmosphere...?  \n\u2022 How challenging are your classes?  \n\u2022 What format are your classes typically in? By that I mean, are they lecture-style, discussion/Socratic method, etc? EDIT: Now that I think about it I seem to remember the one I sat in on being discussion-based.  \n\u2022 How much free time do you have on any given day?  \n\u2022 How far is it from major cities? I seem to remember it being not quite in the middle of nowhere, but not in an urban area, IIRC.  \n\u2022 Overall, if you're happy there, why? Because of the kids? The teachers? The setting?  \n\u2022 What is your LEAST favorite thing about Hampshire?\n\n\n\u2022 ... also, what are the quality of the drugs there?\n\nYou don't have to answer that last one. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I like Hampshire because I finally feel like I fit in. In High School I slacked because I didn't see a reason to get good grades, and despite being pretty intelligent, classes didn't engage me very much. At Hampshire, I can choose what I study from a huge variety of awesome and engaging classes. It's almost overwhelming how many cool classes you can take, and often people will end up finding their passion randomly by taking a class for their Div I requirements.\n\n\nAs for class difficulty, it really varies quite a bit. Some professors(who are infamous because of it) give quite a lot of work, and are quite intense despite the nature of the college's academic program. I've had a good mix of difficult and just right classes, as well as a class or two that I've thought was too easy.\n\nEvery class I've ever taken at Hampshire was somewhat discussion based(even music theory, which is tough to teach in that setting, but there was still quite a bit of discussion).\n\nFree time has depended on how many/what classes you're taking in a given semester. I've found that the most work comes from the Power/Social Justice and history-based classes due to how much writing is involved. That being said, if you manage your time right, there will be plenty of free time to go around.\n\n\nIt's not too far from Boston or NYC by bus, but theres no real close big city other than those. The Amherst Center and Northampton(especially) areas are great hangout spots with lots of live music and shopping, if either of those are your gig.\n\n\nI'm happy for a ton of reasons. I've fallen into a great group of friends, I'm interested in my classes, and I love the area.\n\n\nMy least favorite thing about Hampshire is the double-edged sword that is the academic program. You need to be EXTREMELY self-motivated, and that came as a shock to me when I first arrived here. The style of learning isn't for everyone, but those select, lucky few feel like they are in the perfect place. Hopefully that's your case too!\n\n\nThe drugs are good. I don't do anything anymore(I became a buddhist last spring and gave up drinking as well as everything else), but almost all my friends smoke pot and/or drink, and both are readily available if you know the right people(they're around).\n\n\nI hope I helped!  \n\nEDIT: I didn't address hard drugs. They're available and pretty good from what I hear.",

It was taught by 4 professors from all different science disciplines(Biology, Astronomy, Geology, etc), and they took turns leading each class lecture/discussion. Our assignments included papers having to do with each separate discipline as well. I'm not a very sciency guy, but I really enjoyed that class as it was a great example of what Hampshire is.

The modern science of astrobiology is a transdisciplinary study of extraterrestrial life in the universe drawing\nfrom active research in astrophysics, biology, chemistry, and geology. A microbiologist, an astronomer, and a planetary\nscientist have teamed up to take you through this inter-disciplinary course, where we will look at the history of\nextraterrestrial debate and analyze the science behind astrobiology. We will investigate the properties of life as we know it\nand extrapolate these properties to consider the potential for simple life forms to exist on Mars and elsewhere in our solar\nsystem, to the possibility of intelligent life on habitable planets near distant stars, and finally the implications of\nextraterrestrial life to life on Earth.

There's a couple professors that teach analogue synth and sound design, respectively, if that's what you want to possibly study. ",

            "comment": "I was a transfer too, so I'll try to shed a little light on how the transfer experience is different that a typical first-year's.\n\nI like Hampshire because they let me do whatever the fuck I wanted, and supported me while I was doing it. I transferred from art school with no science background, and Hampshire not only allowed me to do all the neuroscience I was fiending to do, but they provided me with an awesome support system of people who were willing to work with me to achieve my goals (and yeah, I had to find those people on my own, but that's really not too difficult). The amount of academic freedom we have here can either be a blessing or a curse. If you're really self-motivated and know exactly what you want to study, or if you just have a vague idea of areas that interest you, Hampshire can be an amazing place. If you just want somewhere that you can get a degree from and dick around for four years (\"you\" in the colloquial sense of the word), don't waste your time and money here. \n\nYour classes are as challenging as you want them to be. As a transfer, you more than likely will get credit for every college level class you have ever taken, and don't need to do any of Hampshire's vague Division I prerequisites. So you can actually take anything you want from Hampshire, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Amherst, and UMass, design your own independent study, teach a co-curricular class, or take classes at the UMass grad school.\n\nWith the exception of a few 100-level classes at Hampshire, you won't have any lectures. Off campus there are a lot more of them, but the upper-level courses at the other schools/UMass grad school tend to all just be like 200-level discussion based Hampshire classes. I just took an 800-level course at UMass and it was entirely discussion based, and much easier than a lot of my Hampshire classes.\n\nI know I sound like a broken record here, but the amount of free time you have is totally dependent on how much work you're putting in. It's not difficult to just put in the bare minimum and get a decent evaluation, but if you're really excited about the work you're doing, which most people are after their first year, you won't even think about having/not having free time. \n\nWe're 1.5 hours from Boston and 2-3.5 from NYC, depending on traffic. There are busses from Amherst to both Boston and NYC. I personally am so so sick of Western Massachusetts, but most people love it here. It's so beautiful in the warmer months and the fall, and then it gets chilly and everything closes at 6pm. \n\nI'm happy here because Hampshire has helped me achieve all my academic goals I had for undergrad. I came in as an ex-art student wanting to study neuroscience who had only taken one neuro course ever, and I've been able to learn from so many amazing scientists, gain years of research experience, conduct novel neuroscience research, and I'm presenting my Div III at a neuroscience conference in San Francisco in April. I feel totally prepared for grad school (...so here's hoping I actually get in), and I didn't get THAT burned out along the way. I couldn't have done any of this had I gone elsewhere. There's no way.\n\nMy least favorite parts of Hampshire are some of the people. Hampshire student are very passionate about everything, which is both a good thing and a terrible thing, because it can make a newcomer (especially transfers, I think) feel like they have to walk on eggshells in order to not get written off or attacked for either having different opinions or not understanding social justice-related terminology and things like that. It seems to have improved since I got here in 2010, but that could just be because I know more about it now. If everything else sounds great, don't let that be the thing that makes you not come here. It's not so bad. People are well intentioned but often can't express that respectfully.\n\nAs for drugs, there's a lot of weed at Hampshire. A lot. I can't really speak to the quality of said weed since I grew up in places where it was much MUCH better, but it's not terrible. It is also pretty easy to get some other kinds of drugs here. ",

Hampshire appears to be an institution that glorifies learning for yourself, rather than for a grade, which is what I feel many high-school/universities come short on. \n\nI've had interviews with both students and Admissions counselors, and after conversing about my personal interests, it seemed as if Hampshire College was a haven for those who are self-motivated. However, I'm placed in an anxious position when I view that students that held impeccable transcripts are rejected. Though I understand that perhaps their personality/interests might have not fit in well to Hampshire, but it's still worrying!\n\nFurthermore, you skimmed over the ambiance that Hampshire creates for new students as cautious, but as new students how are first years treated? \n\nLastly, is there any documents on your DIV III, I'm planning on doing neurobiology and would love to see your magnum opus thus far!\n\nThanks :D\n",

                            "comment": "Of course! I think the thing about them rejecting people who are traditionally \"impeccable\" applicants happens sometimes, but isn't all that often, so if I were you I wouldn't stress about it. A lot of people come here and expect it to be something it isn't or just don't like the feel of the school when they get here, and so our retention rate is a bit lower than most schools, and I think generally the people who don't get in are people admissions just feels like won't do well here or that Hampshire is not at all what they're looking for. \n\nAs far as new students go, I entered as a transfer, so it was a bit different than the typical first-year experience, but that being said, I feel like the first year program is set up in such a way that it's pretty easy to not only make friends, but to get to know people who have similar academic interests. All first years take a \"tutorial\" class during their first semester, which is a 100-level course that you get to choose the summer before. That course is taught by your first-year advisor, and the people in the course are also the same people in your orientation group. During orientation, you'll get to know a big group of people you'll be spending class time with, which is really nice, since you're likely to have something in common with them, and you'll also get to form a relationship with the faculty member teaching the class, since you'll go to that person for academic advice during your first year. In that way, the first year experience is set up really nicely to facilitate friendships and navigating Hampshire's academics. As far as first years' interactions with older students, Hampshire definitely isn't a place where new/younger students are looked down upon. It takes a little while to get used to some of the aspects of Hampshire that may be unfamiliar (gender neutral bathrooms/housing, no tests, lots of new terminology, weird acronyms for all the buildings, etc.), but you'll quickly get the hang of it. Some of the older/returning/students with more experience in certain areas expect new students to already by well-versed in issues that are very important to the Hampshire community (which obviously not everyone is going to be), and that can be intimidating, but as long as you have an open mind and are both willing to learn and not take anything too personally, that won't even be an issue. \n\nThe write up of my Div III, even though it's technically done is still (what I consider to be) in progress, but I'll PM you my abstract. :)\n\nHampshire is great for neuro. We have an ERP lab and a neuroendocrinology lab that are available for students to do our own research in, which is something you'll find almost nowhere else. ",

            "comment": "ZedsBread, I'm glad you got answers, because I have nothing to add, so feel free to disregard this post of mine. But I am also applying for Hampshire College. My cousin went to UMass at Amherst, and though she never took advantage of it, she said the five-college consortium is extremely great, the only downside being the somewhat long travel between schools on opposite sides of Amherst/Northampton. Amherst College, which has an acceptance rate of 11%, is an incredible liberal arts school, with some of the smartest professors in the world. Using the consortium, you can take several classes here. It's almost a loophole to attend a very high quality school that many people couldn't normally get accepted into (I sure couldn't get in). \n\nBut anyways..I ended up making a video for my Hampshire application which took a total of about three weeks (writing, shooting, editing, exporting, etc.), because I too slacked myself into the 2.0's in high school and needed to go above and beyond. I earned all A's this semester and got a good ACT score and teacher rec. letter, but that GPA is for sure going to be the \"make it or break it\" factor. But I really think it's part of Hampshire's core values to see a student as more than just a set of numbers and achievements. That's why they give written evaluations instead of letter grades, which a lot of people make fun of but I really appreciate. Hope this somewhat helps, even though a lot of this was rambling. :/\n\nGood luck!",

Hampshire College posted a 71% acceptance rate last year, so basically just a bit more selective than an average state school. \n\nFor real? See the idea of evaluations is profound and exciting to me, I live in Wichita, Kansas and the education here is so strict and by-the-book that grading performance by anything except a letter or number is unheard of. I'm glad I found the Hampshire subreddit though, reading these posts makes me hope I get accepted even more. Everywhere else I apply to is basically just a back-up plan in case I don't get into Hampshire. ",

Cool.\n\nOh man, it's so much better than grading. Grades are fucking archaic and useless, in my opinion. All they do is foster a culture of competition and disappointment. I was depressed when I went to public schools (and also the school I attended for my freshman year of college) because I constantly felt like I wasn't good enough, and nobody was giving me detailed, constructive feedback. Then when I went to the school I went to for 8th - 12th grade, where it was no grades, ONLY evaluations, I learned a lot about myself, how people see each other, expectations vs. reality, that kind of thing. \n\nEducation improves exponentially when your teachers are allowed the room and space to actually give a shit about you and get to know you.",

Even when I was younger, I never understood the concept of judging a person's work and learning, over five months, into one letter. That does nothing but drive competition, you're absolutely right. \"I don't have to be enlightened, I just have to be better than anyone else in class.\" Not for me, man.

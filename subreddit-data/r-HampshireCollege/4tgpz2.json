    "postText": "Hampshire fired my favorite professors..... And gave me 7 advisers for my 7 semesters.  The last, Bob Rakoff, gave me a shitty review for my div because he didn't understand.  I hadn't taken any classes with him, and he hadn't read a single one of my 60ish sources.\n\nAt this point, I want more education.  My GRE is good, GMAT good, but I feel alone.  How have you budding philosophers worked through your statements of intent, your rec letters, etc., and how did you go about selecting a higher learning institution?\n\nThanks to everyone... You're all shinin' stars.",

In large part, this is because they didn't do a good job of sharpening their message and admissions strategies as colleges in New England were increasing their competition for fewer students. Now they have a fairly new admissions director but the college has been seeking a merger during most of his tenure. The biggest problem in the short term is that the college hasn't adjusted the size of their faculty or staff sufficiently. They have 4x the number of staff as they did in the 70s. It's approximately the same number of staff as when they had twice the enrollment. And student to faculty ratio is 4:1. More info at www.IBelieveInMarlboroCollege.org",

                    "comment": "There are some fair points in what you say. I would like to mention that they are historically a very small college and there are some small colleges that are surviving. I believe the big difference is in how they are managed as opposed to a reduction in desirability. Small colleges have smaller room for error. There is a lot of information about this in the book by Will Wootton. I haven't seen any evidence that Marlboro College students fair poorly in the job market. The percentage of their graduates who attend grad school is quite high and the college is praised highly in the book \"Colleges that Change Lives\".",

            "comment": "I think it really depends on who you hang out with. There's some funky mini-concerts at Mixed Nuts sometimes, often on Thursday nights. I went to one once and it was... interesting. Not really my scene, but if it's yours then that's great! It seemed like stereotypical Hampshire (lots of people were high) and the music was electronic, kinda like vaporwave. I think they have some punk stuff there too. There's also a lot of concerts in Northampton throughout the year.\n\nMy friends like folk music, and a lot of us took an Irish music class with Becky Miller (if you're interested in studying music, she's essential to take a class with; she's difficult, intimidating ,and I hated her class, but my writing really did improve and she challenged me). I've had some great times dancing with folks in the Merrill quad after running into two friends jamming on guitar and mandolin.\n\nOh and the Yurt! Anyone can have a radio show at the Yurt, and people often have parties during their radio shows there, basically just playing whatever music you want and having a good time with friends. Just don't mess up the space--John Bruner, staff, alum, and one of the founders of the Yurt when he was a student, got majorly pissed at the beginning of last semester when the Yurt was vandalized. He installed security cameras, but it's still safe to party as long as you don't fuck anything up. John's a great guy.\n\nI'm assuming you're an incoming first-year, so welcome to Hampshire! I have a couple friends from New Mexico at Hamp. Maybe I'll see you around in SAGA (the dining commons).\n\nEdit: Grammar mistake :P",

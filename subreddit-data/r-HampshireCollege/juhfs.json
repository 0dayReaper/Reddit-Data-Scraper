Nothing fancy, just something so that you can print out a paper directly from your room without having to go all the way to the library (nevermind deal with the headache-inducing library printers).\n \n\nAnd! Bring back the landline phones!!",

I would definitely recommend it for the mods but in the dorms you'll probably only use it for popcorn or reheating leftovers that you'd get from eating off campus.  Basically, I think both of these depend on how much you plan on eating outside of saga and what you would be eating, keeping in mind that saga closes every night at 7 (which truly sucks).\n\nRemember that there's a common room on each hall in the dorms.  The common room comes with a full fridge, stove, sink, tv, and maybe a microwave?  Don't quote me on the microwave.  However, there ARE microwaves (and well-stocked kitchens) in the Dakin and Merrill house offices.  These kitchens are about 50 feet outside of the dorms, kept clean, and definitely under-utilized.",

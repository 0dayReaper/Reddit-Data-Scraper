            "comment": "Hampshire has most theater performance opportunities over music opportunities. the music community and program at Hampshire is tiny. There is the Five College Dance Festival hosted at Hampshire College which is one of our big events which brings students from all Five Colleges performing in the Music and Dance Building dance room. So theater and dance events are the biggest areas for opportunities in arts at Hampshire.   \nFor music, I focused on learning at Amherst College, Mount Holyoke, Smith and UMass and I got the skills and knowledge I feel I need. Amherst College and Mount Holyoke are top notch in music composition and piano performance btw.",

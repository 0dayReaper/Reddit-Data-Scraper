Does the same connection work with a computer?\n\nThis is a complete shot in the dark,but a lot of the time devices that will automatically carry out a series of steps when connected to a network(i.e. log into xbox live) have trouble with Hampshire's system because if it doesn't recognize the device it blocks you until you authenticate yourself. I don't have an xbox myself, but if it has just a regular web browser you can try using that to authenticate. Otherwise, you can try locating the network card's hardware address by doing [this]( http://mktplassets.xbox.com/NR/exeres/E4DCF115-2649-492D-A223-C2519690EA4D.htm) and using [this program](http://www.technitium.com/tmac/index.html) to set the same address on a computer. You can then authenticate the computer and plug in the xbox, and the network should recognize it.",

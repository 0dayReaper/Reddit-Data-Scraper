    "postText": "Hi there. I'm a current intern and facilitated a post-lottery meet up yesterday. A bunch of people showed up who didn't win mods yesterday who were either looking to add people to their groups, or looking to find a group. They didn't seem to be compatible with each other's requirements, but here's what they're looking for. Send them an email if you think you might be a good fit! \n\n-Current 7-person group looking for an older student who is willing to be clean, respect common spaces, would be interested in a farm share and communal meals (mod dinners once/week). We currently have 35 points and we would love to chat with you. Contact Kira McCoy kmm09@hampshire.edu\n\n-Div I student looking to fill a room, 2 points. I can clean and cook and like to work on weekdays. Quiet, easy to live with, doesn't make huge messes, won't annoy you or drink your liquor. Contact mwl11@hampshire.edu\n\n-Current 7-person group with 29 points looking for an older student who loves great people. Very clean group, 5 of us have cars, respectful, fun...also we have a PS3, a Nintendo 64, Gamecube, and PS2! Contact us at bjv10. P.S.: you want to pick us to live with...trust me.\n\n-Div I looking to fill a space. I have 2 points. I will cook yummy food and be clean. I'm quiet and probably won't be around a lot. I am not sub-free, but I am willing to be if you'd prefer. (asg11)\n\n-Div I (2 points) looking for a space in a mod. I am clean, quiet, sub-friendly, and willing to fill a double (and find a roommate). I am a good cook and open for any space available. Contact Grace (cga11)",

    "postText": "In the late 1980s and early 1990s (at least) the Hampshire College Farm Center had a flock of sheep where the cows now graze.  (The only times I've touched an electric fence was when I and friends were walking by Route 116 next to the pasture.  Twice was enough.)  They were even featured in a public television or basic cable documentary episode about sheep (herding) dogs.  What happened to them?\n\nEdit: By \"flock of sheep where the cows now graze\" I mean the fields next to Route 116, especially immediately north of the Red Barn and its neighboring buildings.",

And I  knew that the college still had livestock, as the cows *are* visible from 116.\n\n(The closest I've been to the farm is 116 and the sidewalk beside it, and riding my bike up and over the path past the Red Barn.)",

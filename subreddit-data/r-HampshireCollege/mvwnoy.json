    "postText": "I am trying to decide between UVA and Hampshire. The curriculum at Hampshire seems to be better suited for me, but UVA seems to have everything else I want (clubs, network, internships, financial aid, near home). I also want to major in Computer science (CS) and I have an interest in animation and game design which I seem to be able to do at Hampshire without a bunch of gen ed classes for things I, for the most part, don't care about. Can you really participate in clubs and club sports at the other colleges in the 5 college consortium? How often do people do that? Could I start a ceramics club? How active are the clubs at Hampshire? How good is the CS program at Hampshire? I want to take a gap semester in my second year, how viable and common is that? I also want to study abroad for a semester and would need financial aid, how viable and common is that? Is it difficult to get jobs in STEM after graduation? It's pretty difficult to find info on Hampshire online.",

            "comment": "Most of your questions can be answered with \"yes\" as long as you're fairly self motivated and able to advocate for yourself. Hampshire as a school is all about self direction and that includes the responsibility associated with planning your experience and executing that plan.\n\nThat being said some of your questions are much simpler. Clubs are very popular (or at least they were in 2016 when I graduated) and starting new clubs is a pretty simple process if you can find other interested students. Joining clubs at other consortium schools is a little dependant on the specific club and their rules but usually pretty simple.\n\nI didn't study CS or animation but I had friends who did and thought the program was really good and AFAIK they all have jobs in their fields or adjacent to them now. Again, this is going to depend heavily on what you make of your classes: if you're content to do the bare minimum you might struggle more with a less robust portfolio when you graduate.\n\nStudying abroad is a similar story where if you are willing to do the legwork of working with your advisor and the administration to organize both your trip and how it will fit into your academic requirements then it's smooth sailing. I had friends who took semesters abroad and got plenty of financial aid, etc. But they had to work to make it happen. \n\nI hope this helps to answer some of your questions. Hampshire's a wonderful school because they give you so much freedom to design your own experience but that kind of freedom isn't for everyone and doesn't mean that you won't have to work.",

I believe they have ceramics as courses and have all the equipment. As far as I know all the recent stem grads have jobs in stem. They have a big study abroad program with support for that.",

Could I start a ceramics club?**\n\nYes, you can but it's not that common. No one will stop you from going to their club but you may have issues doing things like trips where $ is involved.  People do it.  Yes, you just need 3 people to start a club to get funding. There is an art department.\n\n**How active are the clubs at Hampshire?**\n\nThey come and go. They are as active as the students are. It depends.  Fantastic game design club and community!\n\n**How good is the CS program at Hampshire?**\n\nNot as good as UVA. When Doing CS at Hampshire you must supplement it by taking CS courses at Amherst College, Smith, Mount Holyoke. The first year at Hampshire you won't' be able to take 5 college courses (unusual). So by year 2, you will need to head to Amherst to take intro to CS, algorithms, etc...    For Hampshire look up Ira Fay. [https://www.hampshire.edu/faculty/ira-fay](https://www.hampshire.edu/faculty/ira-fay)\n\n**I want to take a gap semester in my second year, how viable and common is that?**\n\nFor what purpose? You will get behind in your studies, especially if you need to take prereqs for comp sci. Typically, in the fall you will have CS101, and then in Spring CS102. Taking a gap will usually make it hard to follow the natural progression.\n\n**I also want to study abroad for a semester and would need financial aid, how viable and common is that?**\n\nPeople do it. But it needs to be aligned with your coursework. Study abroad in a foreign game design studio? You will also probably need to study a foreign language on top of CS.  Funding is available.\n\n**Is it difficult to get jobs in STEM after graduation?**\n\n Everyone I know that studied something related to stem be it game design, cs, security all have jobs.  From small companies to Google, Amazon ect.\n\nHow much will Hampshire cost you? How much will UVA?\n\n**Keep in mind Hampshire College is social justice insanity.**\n\nIn the end, it's not where you go, it's what you do.\n\nHave you visited Hampshire College?",

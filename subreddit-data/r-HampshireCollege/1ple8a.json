There are MILLIONS of dollars in deferred maintainence costs that need to be paid before we can actually build anything new. There are cracks in the foundation of the library that have sunlight shining through them on the first floor. Hampshire's credit limit won't be extended until 2018(I could be wrong about this date) meaning that neither the maintainence nor the construction of a new building can commence until then. \n\nHampshire is in some serious need of alums dying and leaving their fortuines to Hampshire. I'm looking at you, Ken Burns!",

The portal building (combination Admissions/Campus Center-esque building with a larger school store/cafe and other flexible spaces students and faculty can use) will commence construction next year. Of course, we got a huge anonymous gift specifically for that to be built. \n\n\nThe library will also hopefully be renovated soon, I believe they're starting to build the committee that will oversee that happening. There's also been much more donating going on from alums to renovate some buildings. The BOT, staff, and faculty have been trying to get the wheels turning for us to fix up and build spaces for us to use. Like I said, the Portal should be built within the next couple years, along with the Barn (new home for mixed nuts and more student spaces) and the renovations to the Dining Commons. There should be at least a few newer spaces on campus before 2018, though we still are in desperate need on money.\n\nSource: On multiple BOT committees, including the Portal planning committee.",

The bleak situation presented to us by Hexter and friends (after they tried to move admissions into ASH without consulting ANYONE from admissions) was that our debt limit prevented us from doing major renovations or construction before 2018, barring large donations from alums. It sounds like more alums are getting to a point in their lives that they are able to donate to Hampshire in significant amounts, which is really really good news. The portal building sounds awesome, but part of me wishes that they could repair the library before breaking ground on a new building.\n\nKeep on keeping on! When I start raking in the big bucks, I'll make sure to donate at least a quarter of a building to Hampshire ;D.\n\nedit: where's the building going to go? The walk up the hill to Hampshire is so beautiful!",

                                    "comment": "We actually just confirmed the location last week: It's going to be the first step in changing the area around the bus circle. The plan is to increase pedestrian space and slowly phase out the bus circle (moving the main bus stop closer to the entrance of campus), the Portal is planned to go on the intersection of the road that leads to the back of the library and the main road that turns into the bus circle. Kind of between Enfield and FPH. Because the current planned place would be re-working how the roads go and what ends up being the focal point when you come into campus, there's been a lot of talk about the next steps in making the center of campus better. I know for sure the Library is trying to put together their steering committee for the renovations, and I've heard from multiple higher ups that they're planning to update the RCC and Library within the next few years, but for now the building of the portal is easiest seeing as we've already got the funds and some ideas. \n\nAnd I find it kind of frustrating too that the Portal is going up before the other renovations will be done. But then I hear the numbers and required work and understand: The work that NEEDS (not what we want to make it pretty, what needs to be done to keep it functional) to be done to the RCC/Library is substantial and incredibly expensive, likely more than the Portal will cose. We're talking about working on the electricity, heating system, foundations, everything. It will take a while to get everything done, but I know that it's one of the things that JLash is hoping to get done while he's president, in addition to something that all of the people who control these things think about. I think, if anything, the Portal may be their way to draw in more money. It's planned to be one of few Living Building Challenge certified buildings in the country (see here: http://living-future.org/living-building-challenge/case-studies/certified-projects), meaning that it will be certified in one of the highest standards of \"Green Buildings\" currently active (side note: The committee is really taking this seriously, and it's fun being part of it). Since it will be a place for students to work/play AND an admissions/new student hub, one of our hopes is that the building will make more people attracted to Hampshire, both as students and donors. I'd say keep your ear to the ground about it; there was plenty of talk about it last year when the grant came in, but now that we've gotten through some of the more tedious things (i.e. finding a site and consulting with the BOT and Living Building Challenge people), the design process should be revving up soon. We're having our first committee meeting on that on Friday, but the timeline is looking at attempting to start building within the next year or so.  ",

On second glance, the Lemelson Center may have expanded too. \n\nWhat you're saying about the finances is disturbing though. So they can't borrow the money to do maintenance for another 5 years? That's crazy. It makes me think of what state the building in Enfield are in now- they seemed to be pretty rough when I was in school.\n\nI visited a few years ago because I was in the area, and went into my old Prescott mod. The one thing that struck me is they are still using the old furniture, and what looks like the same old mattresses as when I was there. It just looked so beat. I seriously hope they find a way to get this straightened, or else I fear it'll become a downward spiral.",

That stuff has gotten way more organized and more focus has been put on it.  The new president, Jonathan Lash, has been pretty good in that respect, and the trustees have been working very hard to cultivate new donors.",

Greenwich was renovated during the summers of 08 &amp; 09 and are now bearable and not filled with mold. Prescott is... well, it's Prescott. Hopefully Prescott gets renovated soon.\n\nedit: Oh! I just remembered, Prescott was getting renovated tower by tower they year I graduated.

That's a good question to email the Campus Security team. \n\nAnd parking lots are all right near each dorms with Prescott parking lot, being the furthest away, but thats about a 30-40 second walk.  The dakin/merril parking lot does have some bumps and holes here and there, but all in all, the parking lots are fine and in good shape.",

            "comment": "I am posting this here as friends at the Thompson School of Applied Science (UNH) have suffered immensely as a result of Mim Nelson's destruction of TSAS last academic year while serving as a largely absent interim-director.\n\nLike you, first plan of action was to stop admitting students. Don't be surprised whatsoever if specific programs are targeted in a move to inevitably fire faculty. \n\nI will write more later of the undeniable similarities between Nelson's recent announcement and her recent track record of destroying lives with a smile. \n\nIf you are faculty, don't wait for justification; you need to pressure your Senate for a vote of no confidence. If you wait for iron-clad justification, your days are numbered.",

                            "comment": "I am going to bullet point a lot as a lot of details are on the the Part 1 (linked above) and Part 2 (linked in that post). At the time, many TSAS faculty and stakeholders didn't think Mim was that intimately involved in the dismantling of TSAS. Given what is happening at Hampshire, the similarities imply (but clearly don't prove) that their original impression underestimated her role. This is me paraphrasing a friend with more intimate knowledge of the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the Spring of 2017, several TSAS faculty had basically begged the new provost, Nancy Targett, to get involved in helping TSAS after steady encroachment and strongarm changes had been forced upon TSAS by the Dean of COLSA (Jon Wraith) and other high-ranking members of UNH Administration. Her show of promises and seeming philosophical alignment with TSAS and its faculty had them excited about the help.\n\nIn August 2017, TSAS's director of 20 years was abruptly removed from her position 2 weeks before the beginning of the Fall 2017. When the Dean of COLSA and the Provost visited TSAS to explain, they had no \\*\\*stated\\*\\* plan, no alternative leadership, no explanation other than vagaries about why they had fired TSAS' now former director.\n\nNearly 8 weeks later (so October 2017) TSAS faculty were told they had two interim directors; Miriam Nelson was named \"interim director of strategic planning\" or something like that. Whereas the other interim director, John Halstead, was going to be responsible for the more typical, day-to-day operations of the School. Mim was sold to TSAS faculty as a \"visionary\" with \"creative, out-of-the-box ideas.\" Although immensely paranoid after years of broken promises, TSAS faculty were subdued by the seemingly genuine positive rhetoric of Mim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMim began her time at TSAS with a vacation, so TSAS faculty  really didn't get much from her other than a brief meeting and an email until November. Over the next few weeks, she met with representatives from each program to \"hear ideas.\" She also did the same with industry stakeholders of TSAS. Over the 4 or five months she \"served\" at TSAS, she was rarely available beyond scheduled meetings and certainly not present otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is obvious now that this process was merely a procedural smokescreen to be able to claim that faculty governance occurred. 0 faculty or stakeholder ideas were ever implemented or considered. After the announcement of the destruction of TSAS (linked below), several stakeholders were asked what occurred in said meetings; nearly unanimously they told us that the idea of shuttering all these programs was told to them, not that they were asked to weigh in. Even members of the USNH BoT said that this idea was presented as simply a \"way to save $XXXXX....nothing was mentioned about closing programs or firing faculty.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the announcement (again, linked below), the Provost, Dean of COLSA, Mim, etc told faculty first thing in the morning and literally a minute after they left the room, a campus-wide, listserv wide email was sent announcing \"exciting new changes\" at TSAS. TSAS faculty learned shortly after that dozens of students who had applied, were accepted, and already paid deposits were getting new letters that their offers of acceptance were being revoked. UNH Admissions had been told well before the initial announcement to stop admitting students to the shuttered programs.\n\nMim is, like several \"consulting firms\" and \"stakeholders\" and \"interim leaders,\" an assassin. With a disarmingly friendly personality and smile, she executed this operation to minimize backlash, resistance, administrative accountability and recourse. I wouldn't say she led the effort, as the destruction of TSAS was already well in the works, but since the announcement at Hampshire, the opinion of Nelson has changed from \"cog\" to \"clearly hired gun.\" This is why I said in my initial comment \"if you wait until you have ironclad reasons to oust, it's already too late\"....she is good at what she does.\n\nRight now, if they haven't already, those in Hampshire College's administration, BoT are weaponizing your admissions office. They are picking and choosing which programs will remain and which will not. Because they are manufacturing (or, at the least, guaranteeing) financial exigency, affected faculty members will have no recourse. They can't simply close programs, but they can force the closure of programs if the institution is in convincingly  irreparable financial problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[UNH Provost's Office - The Future of the Thompson School\\]([https://www.unh.edu/provost/thompson-school-applied-science](https://www.unh.edu/provost/thompson-school-applied-science))  \n\n\nIt should be noted that Provost Nancy Targett, the one who was the public face of all this, was dramatically ousted about a month after the announcement. Although clearly a main force in this destruction, she did seem genuinely concerned and active in minimizing the negative consequences for individual faculty. Since her ouster though, no one who gives a shit about TSAS faculty remains. Several contract faculty are being non-renewed, several are being fired mid-contract, several tenured faculty are being forcibly demoted or are trying to be forced out. ",

I'm sure some people will be trying to vet/fact check all of this but since some of us are super swamped, I'm wondering if any of this appeared in local media at the time? It would speed along vetting of this if we could see independent reports. Were there any reporters looking into this?",

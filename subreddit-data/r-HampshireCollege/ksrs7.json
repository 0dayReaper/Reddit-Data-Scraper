And these dicks, which jizz incoherent rhetoric right on Hampshire's face, also have the unfortunate side effect of causing a testosterone induced orgy of circular thinking.  Last year, someone in saga, in reference to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict said to me: \"Did you know your tax dollars are supporting apartheid?\"  I am generally pretty liberal, but this is not an effective way to garner support for your cause, and additionally made me want to punch that guy in the face.  \ntl;dr: Activists, Super-Liberals, and Politicians are all dickheads",

That being said, kinda weird that you associate debate with testosterone, I mean the origin of this thinking is in Greek philosophy, but still... (also not sure if you are trolling...)",

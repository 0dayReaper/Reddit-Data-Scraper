    "postText": "Like most of our student body, I voted Hilary. I was disappointed and surprised when she didn't win, but that's how the cookie crumbles. If we got to win all the time, a huge part of the population wouldn't be represented. Sometimes other people get their way, and that's how a democracy works. That's how being an adult works.\n \nBut here we are, days after the results, and someone burned the American flag *on Veteran's day*. As a community, are we okay with that kind of blatant disrespect towards others? Are we okay with collectively deciding that all Trump supporters are evil racists, sexists, homophobes, and xenophobes, while giving them no chance to speak or explain their perspective? Why do we need emotional support groups for this? Shouldn't we be learning to conduct ourselves with dignity in the face of opposition, to articulate our disappointment and our fears with nuance, and to take the high ground? \n\nThis doesn't feel like activism. It feels like a temper tantrum. I'm embarrassed and ashamed of the reaction of my community, but I feel like I'm alone in that. Am I?",

The fire department and police had to disable the alarms, and the students all had to wait outside in close to freezing weather. What on earth did they hope to accomplish? Why hasn't this been acknowledged by anyone? It bothers me greatly that people of one political leaning are allowed to waste resources so freely in the name of empowerment and \"justice\" while those who lean the other way have no voice whatsoever. One would think that a college founded for open minded, self-driven students would not be an echo chamber where all dissent is crushed.",

As someone who has multiple family members that serve the military; I am devastated that the reaction has come to this. I used to be so proud of my school---I wish I could speak up but I'm scared to talk about my conservative background without getting yelled at or called names.",

Like the protests were something expected or even good (to vent anger) but burning a flag on veterans day is just straight up disrespectful. We need to be healing not stoking the flames of intolerance (on either side)\n\nPm me if you want to collaborate on a howler article or something, or even vent. You're not alone",

I'm not saying Hampshire is the only place this is happening, but don't think it's indicative of how everywhere is right now. Protests are happening across the country, but they are not nearly as widespread as you'd think and certainly they are not the norm.",

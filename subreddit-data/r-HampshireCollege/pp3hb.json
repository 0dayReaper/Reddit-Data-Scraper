    "postText": "I started in F04 (as a transfer), stayed until S07, then transferred out when I realized I wasn't going to finish my Div III. While at Hampshire I started out studying music and linguistics, then fell in love with American Sign Language after taking a couple classes with Ruth Moore. I ended up transferring to Northeastern University in Boston, where I graduated in S11 with a BS in American Sign Language. Since then, I've passed the state test to work as an interpreter in Massachusetts, and now I live and work in Western Mass. I will answer anything that does not impair my ability to continue to work as an interpreter. Come at me!",

You can browse signs alphabetically there for free.\n\nAlso, you can go to the back room of Saga any Friday between noon and 1 and visit the ASL table for a crash course. It's intended for all skill levels-- they will help you get started.\n\nThe manual alphabet is pretty handy too, and pretty easy to teach yourself. Start with your name... you're halfway to being able to introduce yourself!",

She is tough, but fair - the closest thing to a teacher with boundaries at Hampshire. Her harsh reading schedule will make you work, and it will pay off in the long term. Although she generally deals with race and gender in pop culture, she also has a very detailed knowledge of legal studies and poli. sci studies, and taking Sample! Remix! Mash! from her helped me develop the ability to quickly read and understand complex legal studies articles. She forces her class to write weekly response \"blog posts\", and her critiques will help you find your voice for academic writing. \n\nA lot of people don't like her, but I found her teaching style a breath of fresh air, and she was definitely the professor that made the biggest and longest lasting impact on me.\n\nI also really liked Falguni, who is another professor who is both smart and strict. I considered having Falguni on my div III committee because of her knowledge of law and poli sci, but ended up going with Stephanie  Levin instead.\n\nProfessors I'd avoid: James Miller, Joanna Morris, and Melissa Burch. James is a dick who doesn't appear to care about his students (While taking his class on the first amendment we talked more about what \"freedom\" means then actually looking at cases involving the first amendment. Also, I was forced to do a project with a partner even though we both explained that our areas of study were extremely different from each other - his explanation being that they were similar enough in his mind that he didn't want to read two papers instead of one. I dropped his class), while Joanna and Melissa have frustratingly open class discussion that almost never involve the reading we did the night before. I \"aced\" Melissa's class because I was the only one who would try and bring discussion back to the articles we read for that day. I learned nothing from that class.\n\n ",

            "comment": "This is entirely dependent on what you're interested in. kxra's list of professors are all in the school of CSI (critical social inquiry, which used to be called social science, and then underwent a name change a few years ago). I was a neuroscience concentrator, so all my classes except for one were in CS (cognitive science). If you're at all interested in neuroscience or psychology, DEFINITELY take classes with Jane Couperus and Melissa Burch. I also really like Joanna Morris, but people feel mixed about her because she doesn't teach her classes in the way most Hampshire professors do. \n\nI only know a few other professors so here's what I have: Viveca Greene in Media Studies (in the HACU school) is awesome, I really don't like Lourdes Mattei in Psych/Sociology (CSI), Kristen Luschen in Education (CSI) is great but you won't get an evaluation until like 2 years later and I'm not actually exaggerating at all. I've also heard wonderful things about Cindy Gill (endocrinology - NS) and John Castorino (biology? - NS). \n\nMy best advice on picking classes is just go for the first few days, and if you hate it then you can drop it. Same goes for waitlisted classes...as long as you're not trying to get into Div III seminars as a Div I, you can pretty much show up to the class and email the professor expressing interest and 9 times out of 10, you'll get into the class. Just stick it out through add/drop and you're pretty much good to go.\n\nAnother thing I'm kind of biased about: be nice to your dorm intern (interns are Hampshire's version of a resident advisor). They work really hard and it sucks when there's always one or two students who think the rules don't apply to them that make the job a million times harder. If you're going to do something you know you shouldn't be doing in the dorms, do it elsewhere, or be smart about it. ",

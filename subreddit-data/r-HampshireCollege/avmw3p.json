            "comment": "Every article I've read about Hampshire's current problems have seemed to rely heavily on the word of  Miriam Nelson and the Board of Trustees. There's a crisis in college education, small colleges like Hampshire face really tough decisions, Miriam Nelson is an amazing person and is being put in a really tough position, blah blah blah.\n\nEven Jon Krakauer's op-ed in the NYT spent a couple of paragraphs praising Nelson's competence and leadership skills. The focus on Nelson in some of these articles seemed downright bizarre. \n\nThis was very irritating to those of us caught up in some fundamental questions about how the situation was being presented. If Hampshire was in crisis, why hadn't the school undertaken a fundraising campaign that made these issues central? Why did Nelson seem to be misrepresenting basic facts about Hampshire's regulatory situation? Why the rush to not admit the fall 2019 class--in other words, why had this situation snowballed so fast? \n\nWhen people pushed back against their narrative, they said dissent was making the situation worse. Student sit-ins are making it hard for us to do our jobs. A no-confidence vote is going to make tens of millions of dollars of loans come due early. What a strange way to respond to people concerned about Hampshire closing down: DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. TRUST US. THIS IS A DIFFICULT TIME, AND WE REALLY NEED YOUR BLIND FAITH RIGHT NOW. \n\nThis article in Fortune is the first one to state what many people have been suspecting all along. The current leadership (President and Board of Trustees) perceived a 'management challenge' to be an 'existential crisis,' overreacted and failed to do basic due diligence. They are totally incompetent, and may sink the entire college as a result. They failed to take simple, basic steps to address the financial problems that Hampshire was facing. At the very least, they have treated the faculty, staff, and students of Hampshire (not to mention the alums) with incredible disrespect. \n\nHampshire College may turn into an Amazon Distribution Center, but I hope blame gets assigned where it belongs: not to the changing landscape of American education, nor to the brutal realities of 21st century late stage capitalism, but to the mistakes of Nelson and the current Board of Trustees. Maybe 'to know is not enough,' but sometimes NOT knowing what the hell you're doing can be really, really dangerous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Hampshire halloween has really gone down hill since they closed the campus for it (guests are still allowed but you have to be invited and register to be allowed on campus.) To find out about woods parties I would look up some of the hampshire meme pages on instagram they usually post to their stories about parties and other events",

Too expensive to hire outside acts for one night when most people ended up having more fun in the woods on their own. \n\nWith that in mind - woods parties are pretty damn great. I've got awesome memories of them.",

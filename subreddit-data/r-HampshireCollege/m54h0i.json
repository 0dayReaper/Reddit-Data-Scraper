Last Spring, while I ate pizza in the town common, I noticed that the Lord Jeffery Inn had changed its name at the request of the inn's owner, Amherst College. That started me thinking: is there a [change.org](https://change.org) petition to change the town's name? Sadly there was not. So I started one. Please sign and share! Best of luck. We need Hampshire College to survive. You are one of the Five.",

Dickonson is a good start, but how about we take the right step and maybe...IDK...name it after the indigonous people's land? Or at least Hampshire. Name it the town of Hampshire.  But we know this will never, ever happen. you think with colleges like Amherst in Amherst, they'll change the name? Then Amherst will change and UMass will have the change the last name after UMass. \n\nBut if they do change, how about not after English town names, after all, isn't that where the imperialists came from? I'm stumped why the indigenous groups weren't even bought up in that petition.",

                    "comment": "Good points. I have made some key edits to the petition description. I assume too much of the petition reader, and there's a lot of research  that was done by Amherst College and UMass on this topic. I assume the petition readers know that the US is stolen land. I mean, every town in this nation is built on stolen land, especially old towns in New England. But I will heed your advice and add a quick paragraph to make sure it is clear. The allegations that Lord Jeff participated in the genocide of local tribes are not proven. But what is proven is that he wanted them eradicated. In the war for Quebec, he acted as a general for the British and used the Iroquois to defeat tribes that tried to stop the British takeover of the territory.  \n\nI also approach  the angle that it is easier to change the name of the town than to demand that Amherst College change its name. However, I will admit that if Amherst College changed its name on its own, then this would become a lot easier. What makes me optimistic is that Amherst College took a step in that direction. They stroipped the \"Amherst\" name from the inn they own near the Common. They also dropped Lord Jeff as their mascot. That happened in 2018. It happened without a whiff of controversy. That means that the college knows what is coming. And so do we. Also, Amherst College chose its name because the town was named first. So had the second choice gone through (Norwottuck) the town and the college would not have a bad name. \n\nAnd as for UMass, that would be the easiest re-branding of all. University of Massachusetts at X / UMAss X. Too easy.",

                            "comment": "True. Once Amherst changes their name, the town could do it easier. Out of all New England towns, I feel Amherst would be more likely to change. My only concern is, I wish the petition would have put focus on indigenous  people's lands, but maybe it really just went passed their mind. But it's hard to believe that when they mention Lord Jeffery Amherst was an imperialist. One doesn't mention that without including the natives. \nBut also, I would not oppose changing the name to Hampshire. It's a tricky history, but the 100% moral thing would be doing it to honor people who were there first, even though that's like bare minimum really. \nThe town could be called \"Pocomtuc\" which is an indigenous tribe in western mass but that was from a quick google search. I'm sure other's come up that reflect the exact Amherst/Hadley area much better, tribes that were forgotten.\n\nCan you imagine the uproar the small conservative community would cause in Amherst? Remember the Hampshire flag burning and how mad they got? I hope they wouldn't do anything awful .",

                    "comment": "I'm also a Hampshire alum. I went into the hard sciences. While the ability to do graduate level research for my div 3 is what got me my first job in a lab, the labs we had we're old and not properly equipped because Hampshire seems to prefer to spend their money on new arts buildings and scholarships specifically for undocumented immigrants. Both nice thoughts, this isn't political. But maybe... Just maayyybeeee... Not the right things to be spending money on. If I saw someone on Facebook talking about how strapped they are for cash in one post asking for GoFundMe donations for groceries, then talk about how they just went out and donated 500 sketch books to underprivileged kids in Guatemala I'd go hmm. I mean, that's a really nice gesture, I'm happy for those kids. But seriously, what the fuck are you thinking, dude?\n\nYou need successful alumns to donate money. Statistically the most financially successful people went into business/finances and science/engineering. That's not a value judgement, but a fact that those fields endow you with the skills to create far greater tangible value to the economy and society with an hour of your labor than you could in other fields, and you receive more in compensation because of it.\n\nThe Hampshire model works fantastically for fields other than straight liberal arts. Yet never once have I gotten a donation email talking about goals to expand science and business programs, build new facilites to facilitate those majors, etc with the possible exception of the occasional minor update to Lemelson, which seemed to mostly be used by art majors anyway. Instead it's always for goals that have next to zero chance to generate any sustainable income for the school.\n\nIf Hampshire was smart and really thinking long term, they would have long ago invested in the fact that their model works fantastically for lucrative majors other than arts and humanities. That helps create the financial base to also be able to invest in areas that have great intellectual value but not great economic value. If they get the capital to continue operations, which I truly hope they do, they might consider moving to a shared future income payment model for a select group of \"majors\" (areas of focus at Hampshire) that are statistically highly likely to result in high income. This could entice more science and business students to try the Hampshire model, at the same time shoring up their long term finances.",

            "comment": "Some important background on this from the perspective of faculty, staff, and students:\n\n&gt;In President Nelson's shocking January 15th announcement, she explained that the board of trustees would vote in just over two weeks on whether or not to admit a fall 2019 class. The entire faculty and staff, including the deans of the colleges were blindsided. Not a single person has come forward saying the had been engaged or even informed by the administration regarding this announcement. The prospect of not accepting a fall 2019 class threatens the job security of hundreds of dedicated faculty and staff, and would be a rushed decision that prevents democratic engagement from the effected community members. \n\n&gt;More concerning still is the complete inadequacy of the administration fundraising efforts. A number of well resourced donors concerned about Hampshire's future have confirmed with faculty that the office of advancement has not reached out to them. Others who were contacted were not given the full story in order to make an informed decision. This has left key donors in the dark, who may have otherwise been inclined to make major donations had they understood that the admission of this years class, and the very future of Hampshire was on the table. \n\nPlease, if you are able, consider donating to this [Crowdpac campaign](https://www.crowdpac.com/campaigns/391419/fund-a-fall-2019-class-and-democratic-future-for-hampshire-college) to admit a Fall 2019 class to Hampshire and help preserve positions for staff and faculty!",

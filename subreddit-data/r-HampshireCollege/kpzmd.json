    "postText": "Hello all,\nI'm applying to Hampshire EA this fall, and I'd like to know what you think my chances are to get in. Here are some factoids about me:\n\n1) Planning to study history with a 4 on the APUSH test and 760 US History SAT subject test.\n\n2) Long list of community service/activism (I started a Gay-Straight Alliance at a pretty homophobic school).\n\n3) I've visited campus twice and interviewed, and the interview went on for an hour and 15 minutes because we were having a really great conversation and I came prepared with lots of questions.\n\n4) Got a B in my APUSH class last year, and I'm taking 3 AP's this year. (Lit, Stat, and Bio)\n\n5) My grades have had an upswing from 9th-grade on.\n\nMy interviewer emailed me this after my interview:\n\nHey Cassius6!\n\nThis is Admissions Kid from Hampshire College, and I'm writing you to say thank you for\ncoming to visit Hampshire and to speak with me. I so rarely have such an\ninvolved and in-depth discussion with a prospective student. It was incredibly\nexciting for me to be able to address and discuss all of the questions you had,\nand especially enjoyed talking with you about how you can be engaged in\nHampshire, and address your questions about academic support. You asked a lot\nof pertinent and important questions, and I applaud you for your mature\napproach to the college process.\n\nThat being said if you have any questions about the Hampshire application or\nadmissions process, the Admissions Counselor who currently covers the state of\nConnecticut is Ting Chu-Richardson. You can e-mail her at (email address). If you have any other questions about Hampshire in general, feel free to e-mail me.\n\nAgain, I had an enormously enjoyable time talking with you, and I really hope\nthat you apply to Hampshire. Good luck on the rest of your college search, and\nyour journey at large.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAdmissions Kid\n\nr/Hampshire, do you think I'll get in?",

I know the Hampshire staff are extra nice in general, (that's part of their job) but my grandmother (who used to do admissions work back in her day) said it was really rare to get something like that.",

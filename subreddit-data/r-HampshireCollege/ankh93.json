Real shared governance doesn't cost much\u2014it might even cost less\u2014and adds fiscal value.\n\nAccessibility costs a lot, sure, but it also adds value. Retaining the workers that make the school run costs a lot, but adds enormous value.\n\nWhat have students been asking for that both costs a lot and doesn't add value?",

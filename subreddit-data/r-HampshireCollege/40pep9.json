There's a bunch of reasons why (one being scheduling issues with PVTA/UMass and another being budget), but they've been talking about possibly bringing it back after some reconfiguration if possible. It's unfortunate, but there weren't a huge amount of students taking Jan Term workshops after they stopped counting as class credits so I can totally see why they removed it this year. ",

There's talks right now of revamping the requirements again (they did it last in 2011?), so if Jan Term is still going to be a thing they'll likely figure it out at the same time as talking about the distribution. \n\nI do hope they bring it back though, there are always some awesome workshops during that time.

I wish current students were pushing harder for it, it sucks being an alum working at the college and seeing cool things I got to take advantage of going away. I think the college could have done without taking away the ability to fulfill distribution over Jan Term - hopefully that'll become an option again. ",

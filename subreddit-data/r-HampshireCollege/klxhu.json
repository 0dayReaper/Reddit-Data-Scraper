It is federated just like email, and it would provide a campus-wide IM network and convenient web-chatrooms between students and classes, etc. ",

This means instantly making a group or event for your class or student group or whatever else is impossible. \n\nMoodle: Everyone is on it, but there it isn't a good platform for communication, and not all classes are on it, and of those that are they don't all have forums enabled (most don't), and it's nice to have the ability for students to create private groups. \n\nStatusNet/Jappix/Movim (if Hampshire were to host it): All students would immediately have an account, could tie it to their Twitter and Facebook accounts, and could easily find other students, create groups and events, etc. If other schools deployed their own instances, Hampshire students would also be able to talk to those because it is federated. Jappix/Movim provide the added benefit of federated IM for all students that works in any modern IM client (Pidgin, Epiphany, Adium, Meebo, iChat, etc). \n\nHopefully that makes sense. ",

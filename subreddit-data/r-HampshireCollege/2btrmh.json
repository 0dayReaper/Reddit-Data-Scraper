    "postText": "Hey /r/HampshireCollege\n\nI'm a Drexel student, who really doesn't want to go back there for his Sophmore year. I hate the school culture, most of the people around me, the school's view (or seemingly its view) of its students, and I really, really hate Philadelphia. It's a demonscape.\n\nHowever, in spite of all that, Drexel's film program is pretty darn good, with its emphasis on production and the advantage of the co-op program, it's pretty hard to pass up.\n\nSo, I'm looking at options, and have, well, rather a lot of questions:\n\n1) How is your school's gen ed and theater program? I'm not dedicated to /taking/ film as my major, but I want to opportunity to work with talented, driven people in my spare time, while getting a good baseline education.\n\n2) How's the film program? Apparently Film Studies is one of the \"Five College Majors\" and I'd love to hear from someone with experience with that. (Also, it seems like most of the film-specific course offerings are from Smith; thoughts there?)\n\n3) How's the student and school culture? Does it suck? Is it cool? What's cool about it?\n\n4) The Five College Consortium in general: how have your experiences with it been? Is it inconvenient to take classes at other colleges?\n\n[5) Not that important, but drug policy when it comes to weed? With Drexel it's automatic suspension.]\n\nLooking to get out of the cesspit I'm currently in, but I don't want to give it up if I'd be going to something worse for what I want to do.",

            "comment": "Hey! Nice to see you take an interest in our school :D.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that my answers are part of just one perspective of the school's academics and culture. There are many other students who may disagree with the things I'm saying about Hampshire.\n\n\n1.) 'gen ed' is an interesting term at Hampshire because it's there really isn't a simple way to explain the academic path of students here. I'm not sure how much you know about the Divisional system(https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/the-academic-program) yet, so I'll give a quick rundown: \n\nDiv I(1st/2nd semesters) = 'gen ed', you need to take a bunch of classes in different schools of thought, exploring the different types of classes the school has to offer. \n\nDiv II(3rd-6th semesters) is equivalent to a 'major', though it's not that basic. You focus your studies and take on an academic advisory committee, two professors who will guide you on completing your studies and fulfilling the terms of the Division II contract that you write and get signed at the beginning of Division II. \n\nFinally, Division III(7th-8th semesters) is what every student looks forward to and simultaneously dreads. Div III is one massive, year-long project. Much like Div II, you have a committee who help you plan and develop your thesis, as well as guide you in which courses or field studies to do while you are in the process of doing your project. Examples of Div III projects range from massive art installations to theater pieces to mathematical essays and everything in between. Div III is the epitome of the design-your-own education model.\n\n\n2.)I'm a documentary film student heading into my Division III in the Fall, so I have taken several film classes while also focusing on my other areas of study(namely sociology and community management). Everything I have experienced within the film department has been amazing. The professors are knowledgeable and helpful, the facilities are fantastic, and the other students are driven, making for a strong academic field(despite the lack of competition between students). In comparison to your current program, I obviously can't speak for the differences, as I'm unfamiliar with Drexel's program, but I can say that unfortunately there isn't a co-op program or anything like it at Hampshire. However, there are several amazing resources that allow students to get in contact with desirable jobs and internships, particularly in film(there are TONS of Hampshire film alums, most namely Ken Burns).\n\n3.) The only term that comes to mind when I seek for an answer to this question is \"bizarre\". Hampshire is a weird place with weird academics, so it attracts weird people. Not that this is a bad thing, but there are some incredibly unique individuals at Hampshire. If you like meeting people from all walks of life, Hampshire is a great place for you. If you do not have an open mind about several things(gender/sexuality etc), then you may not enjoy the social scene. For the most part, everyone is very friendly, though at times Hampshire seems fairly 'cliquey'. People have their groups and tend to stick to them, though those walls seem to come down a bit at parties and during the big school events like Hamp Halloween or Spring Jam.\n\n4.) The Five College Consortium is an INCREDIBLE resource. Being able to take classes at all the other colleges is great, especially due to the small amount of classes offered at a school of Hampshire's size. As for convenience, the PVTA busses run all day to and from every school, and it's never more than 45 minutes from one school to another. It's incredibly convenient to have a car, though.\n\n5.) The majority of Hampshire students smoke weed, and its incredibly prevalent on campus because of that. You obviously can't be stupid about it, but many people don't hide the fact that they smoke. The school is very lenient to users(dealers are at a higher risk, however). Something else worth mentioning is that the general student body is friendly to sub-free people. Some people smoke and trip and drink, some don't, and some only do some of those. Regardless, everyone is kind and respectful(for the most part - Obviously there are some anomalies).\n\nSorry I wrote a novel, but I love talking about my school. I hope my answers are satisfying. Please let me know if you have any other questions or want something clarified!",

Hampshire has its fair share of \"I hate this school,\" and, of course, on a page like that, things are going to be pretty negatively based. However, I'm curious as to how strong of a contingent you think that is.",

Hampshire is a unique place and I've seen my fair share of people who just weren't the right for for the school.\n\n\nIf you think you may be interested, visit the school, sit in on some classes, talk to students. Try to get a first-hand scope of the school, as it definitely has been different than some applicants originally thought.",

            "comment": "The theatre program rules- you can certainly combine your interests in theatre and film, or film and anything, really, since you're creating your own course of study. It's a very student-run program, and most of the plays produced are original student works. \n\nThe film program also rules- Hampshire's one of the only places I've found to let students work in both digital and analog film. It's not so much centered around production, either. You do a ton of theory and history work, too.\n\n\"Bizarre\" is an odd word for it, but I understand why RMeiselman chose it- everyone at Hampshire is incredibly devoted to their interests, as well as how their interests and actions benefit communities around them. That sort of passion isn't what you find everywhere else. We are definitely an eclectic bunch. I never found it to be cliquey when I was a student, just because the academics require you to be very collaborative. Plus, we're a member of the Five College Consortium, so if you're ever having a weird day you can just go explore UMass Amherst or Smith or something, make friends there, too.\n\nI don't know that the majority of Hampshire students smoke weed, but it happens here. It happens everywhere. The difference is Hampshire has a culture of recovery and wellness over flat-out punishment. We're also trying to keep spaces safe on campus, so there's no smoking indoors, in public, in front of building exits (25 feet from all buildings), or anything like that. Campus Police don't do random drug searches or anything like that, but of they see you doing something you shouldn't, they're going to stop you, confiscate it, whatever. Illegal substances are still illegal. Here's the official policy from our handbook, Non Satis Non Scire (To Not Know is Not Enough)- https://handbook.hampshire.edu/node/67\n\nYou should contact the Transfer counselor in the Admissions Office- we have a person who almost exclusively works with transfer students on the process coming in to Hampshire. For a small school we have a pretty large transfer cohort.",

            "comment": "It's a 10 day old thread, but I'll give my $.02\n\n1) RMeiselman gave a pretty comprehensive answer--gen ed classes are mostly taken during div 1 (first year). The 100 level classes are great, it's like everyone is afraid of not sounding interesting enough when they title their course. \n\n2) Film program: Film Studies is one of Hampshire's more well known majors, but I'd like to play devil's advocate: in my first year I wanted to focus on film, so I've taken a decent amount of film/video classes and am pretty familiar with the program. Hampshire focuses on film studies, with emphasis on study. With the exception of one, every class I've seen offered was almost exclusively about film theory/analysis, and in my experience with classes, making ones own work has focused on the content. If you're looking for film/video production rather than analysis/study, Hampshire might not be the best place for you. Funnily enough, some of the people I know who are interested in video production more than theory have found a place in the animation department.\n\n3) RMeiselman gave a pretty comprehensive answer again. I've found a trend in some people assuming everyone at the school is completely invested about LGBQ ongoings. There are certainly worse communities.\n\n4) It's actually very convenient to take classes at the other 4 colleges. In my experience, everyone who I've approached about taking a five college course has been completely open to help me do so. It's a good thing, too, because once you start narrowing your studies at Hampshire down the available relevant class pool dries up quickly. There's also a mostly reliable bus system that is free for students.\n\n5) Hampshire seems to be pretty lax when it comes to drug usage. Be responsible and you'll be fine.\n\n",

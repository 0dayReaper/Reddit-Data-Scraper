    "postText": "The first time I came across Hampshire online I saw, \"to know is not enough\" and felt something click. Y'all have everything I'm looking for academically and on campus etc. I would love to attend and study politics/political economics. The reproductive health, rights, and justice certificate is additionally appealing.\n\nI enrolled in a semester of community college in 2017 and did pretty poorly. (Had some bad life circumstances, don't think it's a good reflection of my abilities). I'm in my early 20's now and starting my AA in human services through an online program in January. Should take me about a year and a half, then I would apply.\n\nWould Hampshire generally be welcoming to someone a little older? Do you all think that semester of low grades will hurt my chances of admission, assuming my new grades will be much better? I know colleges generally like an upward trajectory, just makes me nervous.\n\nAlso, I'm autistic. I consider myself to have good social skills, but I would like to be authentic and am excited to bring my perspective to the table. That being said, how is campus culture with disabilities? Does anyone have any commentary on disability services? If I eventually do the interview, would disclosing my diagnosis be a bad idea?\n\nThanks for reading! I know this situation is very hypothetical right now, but it would be great if it worked out.",

            "comment": "Of course not! I knew  many older students on campus many of whom have disabilities. I am not disabled, but do have medical conditions which has made life difficult, so from my experience, Hampshire had the resources and support for what you need. \n\nIn terms of your low grades, Hampshire does not look at grades or tests, but if that is all you have they have to go by it. However, Hampshire, because of their non-traditional and opened minded nature, they will look and strongly consider everything else you have in terms of experience and credit to judge whether you should be accepted or not. \n\nif you would like to know any more info on Hampshire, please, feel free to message me privately and I would love to have a discussion to help you on your decision. Hampshire is a wonderful place. I loved it so much and miss it still when I had to leave last March due to COVID. They give you opportunities to start your own projects, have many clubs, a decent sports team, pool, decent, improving food, and great resources to help succeed.",

            "comment": "We had several \"older\" students when I was there and I had an \"older\" friend apply and accept (she had to put it on hold for other stuff, too). So that should be an issue at all. \n\nI was a pretty dismal high school student - either As or Ds. Unless a lot has changed I believe Hampshire looks a lot more at the big picture than other schools, and this shows in the folks they accept. You may also find that working on your AA feels much more enjoyable and rewarding and you do better - I took a gap year and did way better in the college courses I took than in my high school classes. Sometimes you just need a better reason to learn than \"Because we told you so, and you'll never get into a decent school if you don't pass French\". \n\nI found that folks were incredibly supportive and accepting of most things (other than racism, sexism, etc.) and if you're honest and open most people would probably take the opportunity to learn more about autism from you if you're willing to teach them.",

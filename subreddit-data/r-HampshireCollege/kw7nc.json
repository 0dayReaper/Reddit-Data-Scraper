Glad to see it.  Don't know how to describe, but it warmed my heart a little bit.  \nIf I keep writing here it'll turn into some caffeine-and-nostalgia-fueled sappy-assed shit.  So.  Just want to send some positivity your general way, and wish you all the best of luck with your endeavors.\n\nBe well, and be awesome to each other.\n-",

Either way, no biggie, as I can see the reddit population is just a fraction of the Hamp population.  Anyway, to answer your question, things are as good as you'd expect.  Was bouncing around in my hometown (Philly) for a little while, tried going back to school for a MA in Philosophy, but didn't/couldn't make it past the first semester (no loans, no guidance, no discipline, and a bunch of party-hard friends) then I found a job with a fundraising company for about 5 1/2 years, and I'm back in school now to become a HS English teacher.  \n\nIt's good, as long as you know that your degree in Metaphysics and Social Theories is just a piece of paper, and the hard work of actually driving your own curriculum is the more valuable aspect of your degree.  Also, anyone who says a GPA is more helpful than evaluations is stone-cold wrong, so there's that as well.  Just stay focused, and get out in 4 years if you can, finding a focus that you're passionate about will make that easier.  \nAlso, it's good to have a clean break from the valley - a few people I know who didn't had a really tough time of things.  Any other questions, I'd be more than happy to answer.\n\nGood luck with everything, and have a safe and fun Halloween!",

I went to every graduation while I was at Hamp - I lived with a 6th, 7th, and 8th year student in mod 71 my first year and a recent alum slept on our couch, so I was always just happy to see people actually graduating - but the whole effort to get to that point overshadowed the 'now what?' so I think it's just nice to know people not only graduate but lead healthy (-ish), happy and productive lives.\n\nOn your sidenote - I actually lived with two girls from Philly in 71 for my first 3 years.  Philly totally represented, and I'm stoked we still represent up there.  ",

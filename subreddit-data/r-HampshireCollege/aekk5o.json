    "postText": "    by John Lord, LL.D.  \n\n            Whether the people of Israel did not believe the  \n         predictions of the prophet, or wished to have a kingly  \n         government in spite of its evils, in order to become  \n         more powerful as a nation, we do not know.  All that  \n         we know is that they persisted in their demand, and  \n         that God granted their request.  With all the memo-  \n         ries and traditions of their slavery in the land of Egypt,  \n         and the grinding despotism incident to an absolute  \n         monarchy of which their ancestors bore witness, they   \n         preferred despotism with its evils to the independence  \n         they had enjoyed under the Judges; for nationality,  \n         to which the Jewish people were casting longing   \n         eyes, demands law and order as the first condition  \n         of society.  In obedience to this same principle the  \n         grinding monarchy of Louis XIV. seemed preferable  \n         to the turbulence and anarchy of the Middle Ages,  \n         since unarmed and obscure citizens felt safe in their  \n         humble avocations.  In like manner, after the license  \n         of the French Revolution the people said, \"Give us  \n         a king once more!\" and seated Napoleon on the  \n         throne of the Bourbons, \u2014 a ruler who took one man  \n         out of every five adults to recruit his armies and   \n         consolidate his power, which he called the glory of  \n         France.  Thus kings have reigned by the will of the  \n         people, \u2014 or, as they call it, by the grace of God, \u2014  \n         from Saul and David to our own times, except in those   \n         few countries where liberty is preferred to material  \n         power and military laurels.  \n            The peculiar situation of the Israelites in a narrow  \n         strip of territory which was the highway between  \n         Syria and Egypt, likely to be overrun by Aram\u00e6ans,  \n         Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians, to say nothing  \n         of the hostile nations which surrounded them, such as  \n         Moabites and Philistines, necessarily made them a war-  \n         like people (like the inhabitants of the Swiss Cantons  \n         five or six hundred years ago), and they were hence led  \n         to put a high estimate on military qualities, especially  \n         on the general who led them to battle.  They accord-  \n         ingly desired a greater centralized power than the  \n         Judges wielded, which could be exercised only by a  \n         king, intrenched in a strong capital.  Their desire for  \n         a king was natural, and almost excusable if they were   \n         willing to pay the inevitable price.  They simply  \n         wished to surrender liberty for protection and politi-  \n         cal safety.  They did not repudiate the fundamental  \n         doctrine of their religion; they simply wanted a change  \n         of government, \u2014 a more efficient administration.  \n            The selection of a king did not rest with the people,  \n         however, but with the great prophet who had ruled   \n         them with so much wisdom and ability, and who was  \n         regarded as the interpreter of the will of God.    \n            Samuel, by the direction of God, did not go into the   \n         powerful tribe of Ephraim, which possessed one half  \n         of the Israelitish territory, to select a sovereign, but to  \n         the smallest of the tribes, that of Benjamin, \u2014 the  \n         most warlike, however, \u2014 and to one of the least of  \n         the family of that tribe, dwelling in very humble life.   \n         Kish, the Benjamite, had sent out his son Saul in  \n         quest of three asses which had strayed away from the  \n         farm, \u2014 a man so poor that he had no money to give  \n         to the seer who should direct his search, as was cus-  \n         tomary, and was obliged to borrow a quarter of a shekel   \n         from his servant when they went together to seek the  \n         counsel of Samuel.  But this obscure youth was \"a  \n         choice young man, and a goodly.\"  He had a com-  \n         manding presence, was very beautiful, and was head  \n         and shoulders taller than any other man of his tribe,  \n         \u2014 a man every way likely to succeed in war.  Samuel  \n         no sooner saw the commanding figure and intelligent   \n         countenance of Saul than he was assured that this was  \n         the man whom the Lord had chosen to be the future   \n         captain and champion of Israel.  He at once treated  \n         him with distinguished honor, and made him sit at his  \n         own table, much to the amazement of he thirty nobles  \n         who also were bidden to a banquet.  The prophet took  \n         the young man aside, conducted him to the top of his  \n         house, anointed him with the sacred oil, kissed him  \n         (a form of allegiance), and communicated to him the  \n         will of God.  But Saul was only privately conse-  \n         crated, and with rare discretion told no man of his   \n         good fortune, \u2014 for he had not yet distinguished himself  \n         in any way, and would have been laughed to scorn by  \n         his relatives, as Joseph was by his brothers, had he  \n         revealed his destiny.   \n            Nor did Samuel dare to tell people of the man   \n         whom the Lord had chosen to rule over them, but  \n         assembled all the tribes, that the choice might be  \n         publicly indicated.  Probably to their astonishment  \n         the little tribe of Benjamin was \"taken,\" \u2014 that is  \n         pointed out, presumably by lot, as was their custom  \n         when appealing for divine direction; and out of the  \n         tribe of Benjamin the family of Matri was chosen, and  \n         Saul the son of Kish was selected.  But Saul could not  \n         be found.  With rare modesty and humility he had   \n         hidden himself.  When at length they brought him from  \n         his hiding-place Samuel said unto the people, \"See ye  \n         him whom the Lord hath chosen, that there is none  \n         like him among all the people!\"  And such was the  \n         authority of Samuel that the people shouted, saying,  \n         \"God save the king!\" \u2014 a circumstance interesting as  \n         being the first recorded utterance of a cry that has  \n         been echoed the world over by many a loyal people.    \n            Not yet, however, was Saul clothed with full power  \n         as a king.  Samuel still remained the acknowledged  \n         ruler until Saul should distinguish himself in battle.  \n         This soon took place.  With heroic valor he delivered  \n         Jabesh-Gilead from the hosts of Ammonites when  \n         that city was about to fall into their hands, and si-  \n         lecned the envy of his enemies.  In a burst of popular  \n         enthusiasm Samuel collected the people in Gilgal, and  \n         there formally installed Saul as King of Israel.  \n            Samuel was now an old man, and was glad to lay  \n         down the heavy burden and put it on he shoulders of  \n         Saul.  Yet he did not retire from the active govern-  \n         ment without making a memorable speech to the  \n         assemble nation, in which with transcendent dignity  \n         he appealed to the people in attestation of his incor-  \n         ruptible integrity as a judge and ruler.  \"Behold, here   \n         I am!  Witness against me before the Lord, and before  \n         his anointed.  Whose ox have I taken, or whose ass  \n         have I taken, or whom have I defrauded?  Or of  \n         whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my  \n         eyes therewith?  And they said, Thou hast not de-  \n         frauded us, nor oppressed us; neither hast thou taken   \n         aught of any man's hand.\"  Then Samuel closed his  \n         address with an injunction to both king and people  \n         to obey the commandments of God, and denouncing  \n         the penalty of disobedience: \"Only fear the Lord, and  \n         serve Him in truth and with all your heart, for con-  \n         sider what great things He hath done for you, but  \n         if ye shall do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, \u2014 both  \n         ye and your king.\"    \n            Saul for a time gave no offence worthy of rebuke,  \n         but was a valiant captain, smiting the Philistines, who  \n         were the most powerful enemies that the Israelites had  \n         yet encountered.  But in an evil day he forgot his true  \n         vocation, and took upon himself the function of a priest  \n         by offering burnt sacrifices, which was not lawful but  \n         for the priest alone.  For this was rebuked by  \n         Samuel.  \"Thou hast done foolishly,\" he said to the  \n         King; \"for which thy kingdom shall not continue.  \n         The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart,  \n         and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over  \n         his people, because thou hast not kept that which the  \n         Lord commanded thee.\"  We here see the blending of  \n         the theocratic with the kingly rule.  \n            Nevertheless Saul was prospered in his wars.  He  \n         fought successfully the Moabites, the Ammonites, the   \n         Edomites, the Amalekites, and the Philistines, aided   \n         by his cousin Abner, whom he made captain of his  \n         host.  He did much to establish the kingdom; but he  \n         was a great captain than a great man.  He did  \n         not fully perceive his mission which was to fight, but  \n         meddled with affairs which belonged to the priests.  \n         Nor was he always true to his mission as a warrior.  \n         He weakly spared Agag, King of Amalekites, which    \n         again called forth the displeasure and denunciation of  \n         Samuel, who regarded the conduct of the King as di-  \n         rect rebellion against God, since he was commanded to  \n         spare none of that people, they having shown an un-  \n         compromising hostility to the Israelites in their days of   \n         weakness, when first entering Canaan.  This, and simi-  \n         lar commands laid upon the Israelites at various times,  \n         to \"utterly destroy\" certain tribes or individuals and   \n         all of their possessions, have been justified on the  \n         ground of the bestial grossness and corruption of those  \n         pagan idolaters and the vileness of their religious rites  \n         and social customs, which unfortunately always found  \n         a temptable side on the part of the Israelites, and re-  \n         peatedly brought to nought the efforts of Jehovah's  \n         prophets to bring up their people in the fear of the  \n         Lord, to recognize Him, only, as God.  It was not easy  \n         for that sensual race to stand on the height of Moses,  \n         and \"endure as seeing him who is invisible.\"  They  \n         too easily fell into idolatry; hence the necessity of the  \n         extermination of some of the nests of iniquity in   \n         Canaan.  \n            Whether Saul spared Agag because of his personal   \n         beauty, to grace his royal triumph, or whatever the  \n         motive, it was a direct disobedience; and when the  \n         king attempted to exculpate himself, inasmuch as he   \n         had made a sacrifice of the spoil to the Lord, Samuel   \n         replied: \"Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-  \n         offerings and sacrifices as in obeying his voice? . . .    \n         Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken  \n         than the fat of rams, \u2014 for rebellion is as the sin of  \n         witchcraft, and stubbornness as an iniquity and idola-  \n         try.\"  The prophet here sets forth, as did Isaiah in  \n         Later times, the great principles of moral obligation  \n         as paramount over all ceremonial observances.  He  \n         strikes a blow at all pharisaism and all self-righteous-  \n         ness, and inculcates obedience to direct commands  \n         as the highest duty of man.   \n            Saul, perceiving that he had sinned, confessed his  \n         transgression, but palliated it by saying that he feared   \n         the people.  But this policy of expediency had no  \n         weight with the prophet, although Saul repented and  \n         sought pardon.  Samuel continued his stern rebuke,  \n         and uttered his fearful message, saying, \"Jehovah hath  \n         rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and   \n         hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than  \n         thou.\"  Furthermore Samuel demanded that Agag,  \n         whom Saul had spared, should be brought before him;   \n         and he took upon himself with his aged hand the  \n         work of executioner, and hewed the king of the  \n         Amalekites in pieces in Gilgal.  He then finally de-  \n         parted from Saul, and mournfully went to his own  \n         house in Ramah, and Saul saw him no more.  As the  \n         king was the \"Lord's anointed,\" Samuel could not  \n         openly rebel against kingly authority, but he would  \n         henceforth have nothing to do with the headstrong  \n         ruler.  He withdrew from him all spiritual guidance,  \n         and left him to his follies and madness; for the inex-  \n         tinguishable jealousy of Saul, that now began to ap-  \n         pear, was a species of insanity, which poisoned his  \n         whole subsequent life.  The people continued loyal to  \n         a king whom God had selected, but Samuel \"came no  \n         more to see Saul until the day of his death.\"  To be  \n         deserted by such a counsellor as Samuel, was no small  \n         calamity.  \n            Meanwhile, in obedience to instructions from God,  \n         Samuel proceeded to Bethlehem, to the humble abode  \n         of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah. one of whose sons he  \n         was required to anoint as the future king of Israel.  \n         He naturally was about to select the largest and finest  \n         looking of the seven sons; but God looketh on the   \n         heart rather than the outward appearance , and David,  \n         a mere youth, and the youngest of the family, was the  \n         one indicated by Jehovah, and was privately anointed  \n         by the prophet.  \n            Saul, of course, did not know on whom the choice   \n         had fallen as his successor, but from that day on  \n         which he was warned of the penalty of his disobe-  \n         dience divine favor departed from him, and he be-  \n         came jealous, fitful and cruel.  He presented a striking  \n         contrast to the character he had shown in his early  \n         days, \u2014 being no longer modest and humble, but proud  \n         and tyrannical.  Prosperity and power had turned his  \n         head, and developed all that was evil in him,  Nero  \n         was no more unreasonable and bloodthirsty than was  \n         Saul in his latter days.  Prosperity developed in Solo-  \n         mon a love of magnificence, in Nebuchadnezzar a tower-  \n         ing vanity, but in Saul a malignant envy of all extraor-  \n         dinary merit, and a sullen determination to destroy the  \n         persons it adorned.  The last person in the kingdom of  \n         whom apparently he had reason to be jealous, was the  \n         ruddy and beardless youth whom he had sent for to   \n         drive away his melancholy by his songs and music.  \n         Nor was it until David killed Goliath that Saul be-  \n         came jealous; before this he had no cause of envy,  \n         for kings do not envy musicians, but reward them.  \n         David's reward was as extravagant as that which  \n         Russian emperors shower upon singers and dancers:  \n         he was made armor-bearer to the King, \u2014 an office  \n         bestowed only upon favorites and those who were  \n         implicitly trusted and beloved.  Little did the moody  \n         and jealous King imagine that the youth whom he   \n         had brought from obscurity to amuse his melancholy  \n         hours by his music, and probably his wit and humor,  \n         would so soon, by his own sanction, become the  \n         champion of Israel, and ultimately his successor on   \n         the throne.   \n            In the latter part of the reign of Saul the enemies  \n         with whom he had to contend were the various Ca-  \n         naanitish nations that had remained unconquered dur-  \n         ing the hard struggle of four hundred years after the  \n         Hebrews had been led by Joshua to the promised land.  \n         The most powerful of these nations were the Philis-  \n         tines.  \"Strong in their military organization, fierce in  \n         their warlike spirit, and rich by their position and  \n         commercial instincts, they even threatened the ancient  \n         supremacy of the Ph\u0153nicians of the north.  Their  \n         cities were restless centres of every form of activ-  \n         ity.  Ashdod and Gaza, as the keys of Egypt, com-  \n         manded the carrying trade to and from the Nile, and  \n         formed the great depots for its imports and exports.   \n         All the cities, moreover, traded in slaves with Edom   \n         and southern Arabia, and their commerce in other  \n         directions flourished so greatly as to gain for the people  \n         at large the name of Canaanites, \u2014 which was synony-  \n         mous with 'merchant.'  Even the word 'Palestine' is  \n         derived from the Philistines.  Their skill as smiths and  \n         armorers was noted; the strength of their cities attest  \n         their strength as builders, and their idols and golden  \n         mice and emerods show their respect for the arts of  \n         peace.\"  It is supposed that they had settled in Canaan  \n         about the time of Abraham, and were originally a pas-  \n         toral people in the neighborhood of Gesar, or emigrants  \n         from Crete.  When the Israelites under Joshua arrived,  \n         they were in full possession of the southern part of  \n         Palestine, and had formed a confederacy of five power-  \n         ful cities, \u2014 Gaza, Ashdod, Askelon, Gath, and Ekron.  \n         In the time of the Judges they had become so pros-  \n         perous and powerful that they held the Israelites in  \n         partial subjection, broken at intervals by heroes like  \n         Shamgar and Samson.  Under Eli there was an or-  \n         ganized but unsuccessful resistance to these prosperous  \n         and warlike heathen.  Under Samuel the tide of suc-  \n         cess was turned in Israel's favor at the battle of Miz-  \n         peh, when the Israelites erected their pillar at Ebenezer  \n         as a token of victory.  The battle of Michmash, gained  \n         by Saul and Jonathan after an immense slaughter of  \n         their foes, was so decisive that for twenty-five years  \n         the Israelites were unmolested.  In the latter part of  \n         the reign of Saul the Philistines attempted to regain  \n         their ascendancy, but on the death of Goliath at the  \n         hand of David they were driven to their own territo-  \n         ries.  The battle of Gilboa, where Saul and Jonathan  \n         were slain, again turned the scale in favor of the Phil-  \n         istines.  Under David the Israelites resumed the ag-  \n         gressive, took Gath, and completely broke forever the  \n         ascendancy of their powerful foes.  Under Solomon it  \n         would appear that the whole of Philistia was incorpo-  \n         rated with the Hebrew monarch, and remained so  \n         until the calamities of the Jews gave Philistia to the  \n         Assyrian conquerors of Jerusalem, and finally it fell  \n         into the hands of the Romans.  The Philistines were   \n         zealous idolaters, and in times of great religious apos-    \n         tasy they succeeded in introducing the worship of their  \n         gods among the Israelites, especially that of Baal and   \n         Ashtaroth.  \n            Samuel did not live to see the complete humiliation  \n         of his nation which succeeded the bloody battle when  \n         Saul was slain; but he lived to a good old age, and  \n         never lost his influence over the Israelites, who he  \n         had rescued from Idolatry and to whom he had given  \n         political unity.  Although Saul was king, we are told  \n         that Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  He  \n         died universally lamented.  There is no record in the  \n         Scriptures of a death attended with such profound and   \n         general mourning.  All Israel mourned for him.  They  \n         mourned because he was a good man, unstained by crime  \n         or folly; they mourned because their judge and oracle  \n         and friend had passed away; they mourned because  \n         he had been their intercessor with God himself, and  \n         the interpreter of the divine will.  His like would  \n         never appear again in Israel.  \"He represents the  \n         independence of the moral law, as distinct from regal  \n         and sacerdotal enactments.  If a Levite, he was not a  \n         priest.  He was a prophet, the first in the regular suc-  \n         cession of prophets.  He was also the founder of the  \n         first regular institutions of religious instruction, and  \n         communities for the purpose of education.  From  \n         these institutions were developed the universities of  \n         Christendom.\"  \n            In a spiritual and religious sense the prophet takes  \n         the highest rank in the kingdom of God on earth.  \n         Among the Hebrews he was the interpreter of the  \n         divine will; he predicted future events.  He was a  \n         preacher of righteousness; he was the counsellor of  \n         kings and princes; he was a sage and oracle among  \n         the people.  He was a reformer, teaching the highest   \n         truths and restoring the worship of God when nations  \n         were sunk in idolatry; he was the mouthpiece of the  \n         Eternal, for warning, for rebuke, for encouragement,  \n         for chastisement.  He was divinely inspired, armed  \n         with supernatural powers, \u2014 a man whom the people  \n         feared and obeyed, sometimes honored, sometimes  \n         stoned; one who bore heavy responsibilities, and of   \n         whom  were demanded disagreeable duties.  We asso-  \n         ciate with the idea of a prophet both wisdom and  \n         virtue, great gifts and great personal piety.  We think  \n         of him as a man who lived a secluded life of medita-  \n         tion and prayer, in constant communion with God  \n         and removed from all worldly rewards, \u2014 a man in-  \n         different to ordinary pleasures, to outward pomp and  \n         show, free from personal vanity, lofty in his bearing,   \n         independent in his mode of life, spiritual in his aims,  \n         fervent and earnest in his exhortations, living above  \n         the world in higher regions of faith and love, dis-  \n         aining praises and honors, soft raiment and luxurious  \n         food, and maintaining a proud equality with the great-     \n         est personages; a man not to be bought, and not to  \n         be deterred from his purpose by threatenings or in-  \n         timidation or flatteries, commanding reverence, and   \n         exalted as a favorite of heaven.  It was not necessary  \n         that the prophet should be a priest or even a Levite.  \n         He was greater than any impersonation of sacerdotal-  \n         ism, sacred in his person and awful in his utterances,  \n         unassisted by ritualistic forms, declaring truths which  \n         appealed to consciousness, \u2014 a kind of spiritual dicta-  \n         tor who inspired awe and reverence.   \n            In one sense or another most of the august charac-  \n         ters of the Old Testament were prophets, \u2014 Abraham,  \n         Moses, Joseph, David, Elijah, Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah,  \n         Ezekiel.  They either foretold the future, or rebuked  \n         kings as messengers of omnipotence, or taught the peo-  \n         ple great truths, or uttered inspired melodies, or inter-  \n         preted dreams, or in some way revealed the ways and  \n         will of God.  Among them were patriarchs, kings, and   \n         priests, and sages uninvested with official functions.  \n         Some lived in cities and others in villages, and others  \n         again in the wilderness and desert places; some  \n         reigned in the palaces of pride, and others in the  \n         huts of poverty, \u2014 yet all alike exercised a tremendous  \n         moral power.  They were the national poets and his-  \n         torians of Jud\u00e6a, preachers of patriotism as well as  \n         spiritual power.  Those who stand out pre-eminently  \n         in the sacred writings were gifted with the power of  \n         revealing the future destinies of nations, and above all  \n         other things the peculiarities of the Messianic reign.      \n            Samuel was not called to declare those profound  \n         truths which relate to the appearance and reign of  \n         Christ as Saviour of mankind, nor the fate of idola-  \n         trous nations, nor even the future vicissitudes connected  \n         with the Hebrew nation, but to found a school of re-  \n         ligious teachers, to revive the worship of Jehovah,  \n         guide the conduct of princes, and direct the general  \n         affairs of the nation as commanded by God.  He was  \n         the first and most favored of the great prophets, and   \n         exercised an influence as a prophet never equalled by  \n         any who succeeded him.  He was a great prophet, since  \n         for forty years he ruled Israel by direct divine illumi-  \n         nation, \u2014 a holy man who communed with God, great   \n         in speech and great in action.  He did not rise to the  \n         lofty eloquence of Isaiah, nor foresee the fate of nation  \n         like Daniel and Ezekiel; but he was consulted and  \n         obeyed as a man who knew the divine will, gifted  \n         beyond any other man of his age in spiritual insight,  \n         and trusted implicitly for his wisdom and sanctity.  \n         These were the excellences which made him one of  \n         the most extraordinary men in Jewish history, ren-  \n         dering services to his nation which cannot easily be  \n         exaggerated.    \n\n_________________\nfrom *Beacon Lights of History*, by John Lord, LL.

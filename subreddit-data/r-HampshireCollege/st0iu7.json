Food is better than most American colleges, especially in terms of having options for dietary restrictions.  Still not perfect but there are always options",

You might want to reach out to [Junoon](https://www.instagram.com/junoonhampshire/). That's our South Asian group. If you have any more questions feel free to PM me.",

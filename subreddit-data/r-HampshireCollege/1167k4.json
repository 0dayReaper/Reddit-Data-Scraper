    "postText": "Hey all, I'm an undergrad at UMass, and I've been told that there's a blacksmithing class at Hampshire. I'm an archaeology major, and since childhood, I've been intrigued by this artform. I think learning to smith iron would be helpful to both my major as well as to my own satisfaction. Any of you out there know anything about this class? Any advice would be fantastic. Thanks!",

Before you can attend though, you need to go through a safety training program that is about an hour long and happens every Thursday at 7 PM.\n\nI should be able to answer any questions, or at least get someone else over here to help you out.",

Also, if you want to get on the mailing list, you can join via [our directory](https://lists.hampshire.edu/mailman/listinfo). Scroll down to the Blacksmiths Guild and sign up. I can also PM you the email of one of the signers, so you can ask any questions to them directly.",

    "postText": "Hi Hampshire College community! I am a volunteer student fellow at the International Socioeconomic Laboratory, a research non-profit incubated under Harvard Innovation Labs. We are conducting a confidential research project evaluating the effects of Covid-19 on Students\u2019 decisions to take gap year(s) among the United States population. My team and I would like to distribute a survey that we curated to understand these relations, and we are wondering if you would be willing to distribute it amongst your gap year student community, or if you would kindly take the time to fill in the survey.\n\nIt would be really appreciated if you would take 4 minutes to fill in our survey: [https://forms.gle/joZssfbgsNdJu5hj8](https://forms.gle/joZssfbgsNdJu5hj8)\n\nThank you so much!",

I have seen the process used to investigate these matters at Hampshire and it is so heavily slanted towards the victim that is basically precludes the possibility of finding the perpetrator innocent (granted in the cases I have seen there was little doubt of their guilt).\n\nAlso here is a quote from the [homepage](http://ope.ed.gov/security/index.aspx) of the source of the data used in your link.\n\n&gt;\nCautionary Note\n\n&gt;The crime statistics found on this website represent alleged criminal offenses reported to campus security authorities and/or local law enforcement agencies. Therefore, the data collected do not necessarily reflect prosecutions or convictions for crimes. Because some statistics are provided by non-police authorities, the data are not directly comparable to data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting System which only collects statistics from police authorities. \n\nI know it feels safe to immediately assume that the data supports your fears, but an actual examination of the data shows that any conclusions drawn from them are to be taken with a huge grain of salt.",

The rates are rising because the definition is expanding and any regrettable encounter becomes a candidate for sexual assault. As far as I know no one has even been removed from campus in these years ",

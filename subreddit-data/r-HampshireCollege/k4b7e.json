I'm already great friends with everyone on my floor; it's like I've known them for years. The orientation leaders are sooo welcoming. I have yet to meet a single person who *wasn't* happy to be here. \n\nTBH I kind of feel guilty because I've been skipping some orientation activities (I should be at one right now), but I've been socializing in other ways.\n\ntl;dr- Hampshire students amazing, Everyone is approachable and friendly, and why didn't I apply here sooner?",

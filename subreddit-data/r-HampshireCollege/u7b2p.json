It's closer to where your classes will be, and the Merrill quad is honestly where a lot of people hang out when the weather is nice (more green to sit on, get those hookah/bongo circles going).\n\nDakin has always confused me, but some would say you get used to it. The entire thing is connected by the bathrooms, which I find turns it into a fucking impossible-to-navigate labyrinth of hallways. The lettering system doesn't make any goddamn sense, whereas Merrill is just A/B/C in a row. Dakinites have no control over their individual room temperatures I believe, while Merrill has some kickass 70s heaters that PUMP that fucking heat out, which you'll appreciate in the winter.\n\nMerrill also doesn't have rooms on either side of the hall, so you never open your door up right into someone else's shit.\n\nCarpets are a plus in Dakin I guess, and people just lounge around in said hallways (Merrill C3 is the only Merrill floor with carpeting). Depending on your preferred level of noise, this could be a plus or a minus.\n\nThere really isn't too much of a difference between the two, but there will always be animosity between the two, and the 'X is better' 'Y is better' arguments will always exist. You'll also find a slew of turncoats from either side. Regardless, the \"more first years\" argument is pretty shaky these days, as there are SO many first years coming with each passing year that Merrill has been saturated with them.\n\nPersonally? I liked living with a bunch of second years during my first. They knew there way around the rodeo, and there was a nice period in the beginning of the year where me and my roommate were the only ones on our hall, allowing us to become better acclimated with everything.\n\nLong story short: survive the first year wherever you are, then shoot for a mod.",

They activate automatically when it gets cold enough and the only thing you really control is whether they're on at all/you can fluctuate between a few degrees of heat. Thanks, ResLife.\n\nBut actually, this TL;DR is spot on. I didn't live in either dorm, I was a transfer and I was put straight into Enfield. My only experience in the dorms have been hanging out with friends there, and I enjoyed hanging out in Dakin significantly more than being in Merrill. It doesn't really matter where you are your first year, as long as you make friends with some older students and try to finagle your way into a mod your second year. ",

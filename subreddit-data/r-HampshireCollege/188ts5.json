(I grew up in New England, though I'm living in China now I know the winters can be rather brutal)\n\nWhat was most difficult in transitioning into Hampshire College?\n\nLastly, how does the farm system work exactly? (In terms of volunteering)\n\nThanks, apologies for any redundancy within these questions.\nIf any other prospies, current students, or alumni want to get in contact feel free to PM me! :D",

            "comment": "Congrats on your acceptance! I'm just going to answer a few.\n\nI'd suggest having a single. I think 80-90% of the rooms on campus are singles, so it's not like you'll be isolating yourself by choosing to have your own room. Plus, you'll be sharing a bathroom with everyone on your hall, so it's nice to have a space that's just your own. \n\nThe difference between the sub-free halls and non-sub-free halls is entirely dependent on who lives there. First of all, there aren't dorm buildings that are solely substance-free, they're halls that are scattered throughout the dorm buildings, so there's going to be some substances around anyway. Second, it's not uncommon for sub-free halls to have a few people who are there because their parents want them there, or who decide part way through the year that they want to use substances. So there's not that big of a difference as far as the dorms go (but there's a bigger difference as far as the on campus apartments for upperclassmen -- mods -- go). As an RA I feel obligated to tell you that all the residences on campus are smoke free, but people tend to smoke inside especially during the winter. If that bothers you, I'd suggest requesting a sub-free hall, but if not then it probably won't matter either way. \n\nI haven't found the winters terribly isolating. People usually find fun shit to do. Throw parties. Get drunk. \n\nI believe to volunteer at the farm, you can just show up and volunteer your time. I know they also have some work-study positions that involve waking up super early and doing farm work.",

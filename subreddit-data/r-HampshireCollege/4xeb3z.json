Other recent articles include, [\"Duke caves (again) to petulant protesters' demands for min wage hike\"](http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=7996) (students at an extremely rich school protesting to get campus workers $13/hr wages! The horror!), [\"Astronomy community a growing hotbed of social justice\"](http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=7988) (wut?), and [\"Abortion is nation's leading cause of death, if counted, study finds\"](http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=7982) (okay just [read this](https://skepchick.org/2014/07/bad-chart-thursday-abortions-and-house-fires/) ). \n\nThis is non-news published by a non-news site that aims to rile up people who are in no way affected by this decision.",

    "postText": "I just discovered Hampshire College and it's unique take on education, and for the first time in my adult life (27 yrs) and through sifting through countless colleges that didn't seem to gel or seem to me a fit, I am absolutely sure that this school is the one for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, it took me very little time to discover the current financial situation and the possible end of all that Hampshire College has to offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is about Hampshire. But do any of you bright people know of any other colleges that share the same experimental, idealistic and grounded approach and commitment to learning?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",

That describes me much better at 27 than 18 \u2014 which I\u2019m sure is why I dropped out after 2 and a half expensive years.",

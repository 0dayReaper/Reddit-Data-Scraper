    "postText": "Hey Guys!\n\nCheck out this new Festival thats being planned by some current and former Hampies!  Its called The Valley Lux Festival and its going to be a 2 day, outdoor festival of lighting arts, music, food and drink right here in the Pioneer Valley.  May 8-9 in Millers Falls.\n\nIf you're familiar at all with the NYFOL or Illuminus Boston, what we're doing is bring that sort of lighting and projection art out the city and out to the nature.  We're filling a swath of woods with cool juxtapositions of lighting art and nature.\n\nIf that sounds like a cool idea to you, help support us!  Give us some likes on FB.  We're going to be launching a Kickstarter in the coming days to help fund this thing and we'd love a hand.\n\nIf you're artistically inclined and might want to create something in the areas of lighting, projection, soundscape, sculpture, or interactive technology: we're currently taking artist submissions!\n\nCheck out our website @ www.valleyluxfestival.com\n\nAlso FB at /valleylux\n\nWe're going to be doing a major website update this weekend, so keep your eyes peeled.",

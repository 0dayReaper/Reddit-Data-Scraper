    "postText": "Hey! I'm gonna be attending Hampshire in the fall and was wondering if anyone could advise me on whether or not to choose sub free housing, as housing forms are due in a day and I haven't been able to make a decision on this.\n\nI originally was leaning towards sub free, as I'm someone who really likes a very quiet living environment and very rarely does drugs. I like to drink now and then, don't have much experience doing anything else, and wouldn't be opposed to doing it...but I wouldn't want it to become a large part of my life. I've heard that drugs are pretty prevalent even in sub free housing, just not as common as they are in the normal housing. is this true? \n\nAnyways, one of my questions is...is there any sort of stigma you can sense around the sub free dorm? and in the regular dorms, is loud partying pretty common? basically, would you advise me to choose sub free if I'm someone who likes quiet and wouldn't mind partaking in some mild drug fueled debauchery, but no too often? can can anyone give me insight into their experiences in either sub free or normal dorms?\n\noh, sorry just realized there's another question I have. I'm trying to decide whether to put a preference for Queer Friendly housing. I was thinking not... I'm a queer girl, but I wasn't out in high school, so I don't feel very well versed in being a part of the queer community. Because of this, being in the Queer Friendly dorm feels a bit out of my comfort zone and I was initially a bit nervous to put a preference for it, which is dumb, i know. Part of me feels as if I wouldn't be \"\"queer enough\"''' as I wouldn't really dub myself a queer activist and wonder if most of the people in the dorm do. I can imagine that there aren't really any dorms that aren't friendly to queers, right? there must be queers outside of the queer friendly dorm? i remember reading on that survey that hampshire put out that something like 43% of the students identify as queer, so i assume so, heh. \nwhoa, sorry, this is really longwinded and confusing but its 3:00 and i'm freaking out about this a little bit. thanks for any insight anyone can offer! i'm sure whatever i choose it'll work out.",

            "comment": "Hey, recent alum here.\n\nFirst don't worry. You'll be fine.\n\nRegarding Sub-free\n\nI lived sub-free for three years at Hampshire. I never felt any stigma for the sub-freeness. People won't pressure you to do things that you're not comfortable with. They won't feel shy about suggesting/asking if you want to partake, and in my experience, they'll be curious as to why (if you choose not to) but they'll respect your decision.\n\nYou can always go to another hall or try to find a party if you do want to drink. If you want to be able to smoke in your hall, please do not ask for sub-free. People do, and as somebody who wanted to avoid that (and knowing many people pick sub-free for health reasons (asthma)) it was rather irritating when the hall was filled with smoke. Also, sub-free by no means indicates any degree of quiet.\n\nVery quiet might not be what you want, as it usually means people are going to their rooms/closing doors, turning off music etc... between 10 or so (sometimes earlier). If you want to be able to have friends over to chat into the wee hours of the morning, you might prefer quiet or semi-quiet. If people are being to loud in your hall, once you move in, you can always talk to them. Most students are reasonable people despite being crazy left-wing nutjobs.\n\nWith regards to queer-friendly, I'll see what I can do to help, but I don't have any direct experience with the hall. My advice (again) would be don't worry. As our student speaker for graduation said \"We'll cheer for you if you come out as gay, but you're on your own if you come out as Republican.\" Hampshire strives to make everyone on campus comfortable regardless of their orientation, and I feel like they succeed. Hampshire students don't make judgments based on orientation or degree's of queerness. They look at the person holistically.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit at least. If you have more questions, feel free to PM me.\n\nEdit: Welcome to Reddit!",

I can't help much about the queer housing, but my first year I lived in the hall across from the queer hall, they were very pleasant people, and it seemed like they all got along famously from the beginning of the year.\n\nAs for sub-free vs normal dorms, I'd say either or. I'm sub-free since spring of my freshman year, and I've lived with people who are the very opposite of me as far as drugs and alcohol go, and it has been fine. There is no peer pressure, no awkward conversations about why you don't drink or smoke or trip. In every situation I've had to decline a substance and tell someone I'm sub free, the person was incredibly understanding about it.\n\nThat's probably the greatest thing about Hampshire, in my opinion. There is no denying that the average Hampshire student can be seen as 'weird', but the one thing across the board that I've noticed is that everyone respects each other as a fellow student.",

            "comment": "Hi! As a former dorm intern (Hampshire's version of an RA), I feel like I can shed some light on this. \n\nFirst of all, the sub-free designations for halls and mods are just that: for first year students, typically the only officially sub-free options are halls within dorms that are not sub-free (so there's not a specific sub-free building, there are sub-free hall scattered throughout the dorm buildings). In my experience as an intern (although I didn't have any sub-free halls), it's less so that drug use is also prevalent on sub-free halls, it's that people smoke weed out their windows (also a thing you shouldn't be doing in the dorms), and it wafts into other people's windows. Like some others said, there isn't a stigma surrounding being sub-free at Hampshire. Based on the things you mentioned, I would suggest choosing a quiet or very quiet housing designation rather than sub-free. You're not likely to find those halls full of drugs and alcohol since the people on them have chosen to be quiet or very quiet. It's a bummer for everyone when people are placed on sub-free halls and then they realize they don't want to be there or would be happier somewhere else, since it either involves moving elsewhere or keeping any substance use under wraps completely.\n\nAdditionally, no smoking of anything is allowed in the dorms ever, so if you smell cigarette/weed/incense smoke and it bothers you, tell your intern ASAP. Honestly, there are so many ways to get away with smoking inside (none of which I encourage, go enjoy nature), and if you're doing it without even trying to cover it up and bothering people with the smoke, you deserve to get caught. \n\nAs far as queer friendly housing goes, I would say go for it. When you first get to Hampshire, it's all about finding what you like and where you fit in/want to fit in. To the best of my knowledge, queer hall (as it's known) isn't really about activism as much as it is about having a safe queer living space on campus for first years. That's not at all to say other living spaces are not safe for queer students! If you identify as queer, you are definitely \"queer enough.\" You're right in that there aren't dorms that are queer-unfriendly, and there are many queer students at Hampshire that don't choose to live on queer halls. There are a few identity- and preference- based communities (Queer Friendly Hall, Wellness Hall, Social Justice Hall) set up in the dorms so that people can join these types of communities before they are able to take part in mod living and join or create their own living communities. \n\nWow, now THAT was long winded and confusing! Sorry if any parts of that didn't make sense. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions! Hope you have a fantastic first year at Hampshire!",

There are people doing everything, everywhere. On hotter days like today, there are so many people outside, working or playing.\n\n\nDepending on your academic areas, there are several great spots to do work(I've spent countless hours in the Music and Dance Building practice rooms back when I was studying music). The studios for art are really really nice, but apparently competitive to get.\n\n\nYou can apply for grants when you're an older student for pretty much anything that will help your studies, regardless of what they are.",

As far as I know, there is one wheel, and one kiln, and it's very difficult to get things fired. However, if you're just doing sculpture, Hampshire has some adequate spaces and really good classes. I've heard nothing but good things about the notoriously cooky [Tom Haxo](http://www.hampshire.edu/faculty/thaxo.htm).",

Jimmy Fallon, Ken Burns and Craig Eastman went through Hampshire without structure, as I did.\n\nIf you can ignore the outdated physical plant, and don't mind using off-campus resources (libraries, etc), then it's still a wonderful place to go.  You'll always have the 5 colleges to fall back on if you need a more \"traditional\" system (I did not).\n\nI loved my Hampshire education.  I'd do it again if I had to.  But it's not for everyone.",

Full revamp there.  That being said, yeah, there are issues.\n\n- The library has its own issues, but the benefit of being part of the Five College Consortium is you gain access to all the collections of Mt. Holyoke, Smith, UMass and Amherst, all of which have way better libraries, and you can have most books from their collections delivered to Hampshire the next day if you need them.  Hell, I ended up working at Smith College's Library for a while.\n\n-The thing about the pottery is that if there's an interest, it will change.  Eventually.  If you put a lot of work into it.  When I was there, a young woman was interested in glass work.  Not glass blowing, but glass sculpture stuff.  She got the funding somehow to get some equipment, set it up in a corner near the blacksmithing area, and got to work.  There were no professors there for her to work with, but it was a major component of her studies at Hampshire.  Personally I took a lot of off campus courses, and used a lot of off campus facilities.  Hampshire simply didn't have the money to have all the equipment I was interested in using.  But being able to design my own course and not having to complete pre-reqs is something I wouldn't trade.",

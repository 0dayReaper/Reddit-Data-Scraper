My mother, who had gone to Bennington, suggested I check Hampshire out and I fell in love with it. \n\nAs for Geology, which I see below you're interested in, Smith has a really great Geology program, and as a Hampshire student, you can take classes at any of the other college in the Five College Consortium(UMass Amherst, Smith, Mt. Holyoke, and Amherst College).",

I would say Oberlin was the school most similar to Hampshire that I applied to, but I got waitlisted. Upon visiting Hampshire campus I instantly fell in love. It is beautiful place, albeit with some funky looking buildings. But what I liked most about the school was its radical stance on just about everything. Hampshire may feel isolating at times but the academics are serious. \n\nWhat extra circulars are you interested in? Do you know what you are interested in studying?  ",

Unless you're planning on going to a college inside a gorge, you're gonna have to do some travel anywhere you go.\n\nAlso Oberlin \u2260 Hampshire. I grew up in Oberlin and went to Hampshire. Oberlin is competitive and academically rigid. Student body is pretty similar but that's true for every liberal arts college in America. You want a Hampshire that's not Hampshire? Go to Bennington.",

We followed Butch Cassidy's journal since there weren't many maps in 1978! It was the greatest trip of my life! And I'm obviously much older now! I also have to say that in the 2 master's degrees and advanced training that I received after graduating from Hampshire none compared to the work that I was exposed to at Hampshire. You have all five colleges to take courses at and you can take PHD classes at UMASS. At the time it had a much better reputation than Prescott and EverGreen because of the 5 college options. You're an hour away from Boston and there's plenty of skiing and hiking within a 2 hour drive. Make your own curriculum, study what you're interested in because no one will ever let you do that again!",

Hampshire has a small rock climbing gym, and is just a 5 minute drive from a great gym called Central Rock Gym. Also, it's in the middle of the Holyoke mountains, great little hills for mountaineering, and just to the west are the Berkshires, full of sick peaks for climbing and badass towns. \n\nI think you'd be crazy to disregard the area as bad for geology and climbing. Connecticut River Valley is an incredible area for that area of study, and there are 5 mountain ranges in the immediate surrounding area of the region (Green Mts, White Mts, Holyokes, Taconic range, and Berkshires). \n\nAlso the 5 college consortium is incredible and pretty much unlike anything else you'll find at any college. I urge you to consider hamp.",

    "postText": "I am thinking of what I should suggest for the Common Reading, and I think that I am gonna try to suggest *Declaration* by Hardt &amp; Negri. In order for that to work out, I think that other people should recommend that incoming students read *Declaration.* Does anybody agree with me? What if incoming students already had a knowledge of the problems of capitalism, and folks like me never had to bother trying to ignore the fact that there are a whole lot of Hampshire students who believe that capitalism can be corrected.\n[Here](http://grr.aaaaarg.org/txt/image/detail.php?id=51c58cf66c3a0edb0bdd0900) is a copy of *Declaration* if you wanted to have the copy and know what we're talking about.\n\nThere is also the question of proposing [*The Communist Horizon.*](http://grr.aaaaarg.org/txt/image/detail.php?id=51c58dd26c3a0ec111750800) I think that that book would also be a good service to incoming students especially.",

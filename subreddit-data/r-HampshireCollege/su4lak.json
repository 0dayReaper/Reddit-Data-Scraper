    "postText": "Hey! As the title reads I recently got an acceptance letter from Hampshire and it\u2019s one of my top choices so far! I have heard how inclusive and liberal Hampshire is and I think that is excellent and definitely a big draw for me. \n      Here\u2019s what I wonder: I really value a diverse range of perspectives and love open discussion. I know that going to a college where the majority hold similar political ideology could mean that there is less variety when it comes to viewpoints.\n       I also know, as a liberal myself, that there can be a tendency for some people to immediately write-off those that hold viewpoints that do not align with their own. \n      I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is that I want to go to a college where there is less of a black-and-white \u201cThis viewpoint is right and all of the others are wrong and if you don\u2019t agree with what I\u2019m saying then you\u2019re a bad person\u201d type vibe that an environment with such homogeneous ideology can bring. I am looking for a school where there is more nuance and room for discussion. \n      How would you regard Hampshire when it comes to this? \n\nHopefully this made sense, thanks! :)",

            "comment": "Hampshire is very left-leaning, but that doesn't mean that there's only one viewpoint for most issues.  People come from a variety of backgrounds, and consequently there's a variety of perspectives.  You won't be shut down for raising a conflicting viewpoint, and in a number of classes challenging perspectives is encouraged to lead all parties to a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the discussion.\n\nThere are some things that aren't really open to debate on campus.  Given how many queer people are here, both as students and faculty, you're not going to win any friends by playing devil's advocate against LGBTQ people as a whole, and will probably make some enemies if you make an attack helicopter joke.  Similarly, no hypothetical arguments in favor of racism or other forms of bigotry.  But I've been in classes where playing devils advocate on subjects like abortion or mandatory vaccinations has been encouraged.  There are certainly some on campus with more black-and-white viewpoints, but Hampshire encourages in-depth discussions\n\nThis extends outside of the classroom too. I've heard debates on communism, gender abolition, and a variety of other subjects while just wandering around campus or sitting in the dining commons. It's far from the only thing that happens on campus, but these conversations are not uncommon and the only time I've seen one end in people being upset was someone suggesting to deport all immigrants",

I read on the international scholar award, but would like to know if anyone here has more details on the eligibility criteria or on how to avail this scholarship. Any other information regarding ways of financial cushions would be appreciated as well. Currently filling my common application.",

I wouldn't recommend any career path where you can't be making at least $100,000 a year by your late 20s.   \n\n\nFor example, if you are interested in politics, also study data science and machine learning. There are lots of political jobs that require those skills and pay really well.",

            "comment": "Hampshire isn't scary! Especially if you're politically liberal, you have nothing to worry about. You might get \"corrected\" when it comes to dialogues about race/gender/sexuality/other stuff, but a) that's how you learn and b) being corrected doesn't mean you're hated! As long as you're willing to listen to (and hear) new perspectives, you'll do fine.\n\nIn terms of things you might not have realized about day-to-day life, well... I have no idea what you're expecting! But I will say that a lot of kids first year partied every night instead of focusing on their schoolwork, and they were all gone within a year or two. Hampshire is laidback in some ways, but academically, it's very demanding. I think a lot of kids don't realize how demanding it is when they decide to go to a 'hippie' school. Be prepared to do a lot of writing (no matter what you're studying) and don't be afraid to shut yourself in your room if you need to do work! Sometimes you'll have a lot of it. But actually doing it makes classes incredibly fun and rewarding! \n\nGood luck!",

I just mean that in my own personal experience (as a gay white male), there were certainly moments in discussions when women and people of color (and the intersectionalities of the two) gave me new insight into topics by expressing points of view I was incapable of having. So, it's not so much that I was \"corrected\" as much as I would present my own ideas, and be met with new thoughts that challenged my own beliefs. No need to worry! Class discussions are super fun and you learn as much from your classmates as you do from the professor.",

I really appreciate you taking the time to assuage the fears of a newbie.\n\nI really just have one more question about the social aspect of Hamp life. I love that Hampshire is such an open and LGBT friendly school, and it seems like at least 60% of the people on the accepted students page are some form of gay/trans. Again, it's fantastic that there can be such an accepting atmosphere for people's sexuality, but as a straight male what can I expect in terms of dating/night life (if any at all)?\n\nIt's a pretty petty question, I know, but kind of an important one for the next three years",

There's been a lot of negative stuff being said the last few months that makes the college look really scary to outsiders, so I'm glad I can help make Hampshire seem more inviting for you. \n\nI don't think it's a petty question at all! Sexuality is super important. You definitely won't have any problems finding people to be interested in, imo. I would say there's more of a hookup culture at Hampshire than a dating scene, but there are plenty of women who are attracted to men at Hamp. The parties tend to be small but especially the first few weeks you should have no problem finding cuties. ",

I'm staunchly behind everything PC stands for, but I also enjoy the occasional quasi-racist or off-color joke. What is the collective sense of humor like on campus? Should I keep my mouth shut about comedians like David Cross?",

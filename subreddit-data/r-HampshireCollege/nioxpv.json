I\u2019m hoping some alums can speak to the process of returning to an environment where such an experimental experience is so uncommon? For example, what do you say when someone asks what you majored in or got a degree in? How was applying to jobs or doing other things without a quick glance transcript? This all seems really cool I\u2019m just nervous about the \u201creturn to society\u201d so to speak. Thanks!",

Those who were serious about it got their certification at one of the other Five Colleges while an undergraduate. A couple of my friends worked at the Hampshire Children's Center, an excellent resume builder for when they graduated and got into early childhood education. \n\nI teach at the college level. What my employer *really* cared about was my graduate education, but I find myself incorporating much of the Hampshire ethos into my curriculum with good results. You have to take such an active role in your own education that you come away with, I think, a deeper understanding of the process of learning.",

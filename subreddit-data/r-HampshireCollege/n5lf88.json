    "postText": "Howdy! I'm a transfer that just commited to Hampshire for fall '21. I'm looking for perspectives about the worth of living on campus vs living off? Living on campus would be financially difficult, but if it's a very valuable experience, I'd be willing to pony up. If not, I'd much rather save the money and get an apartment locally.\n\nIn addition to this, what's the housing appeal process life? What're my odds if I try to appeal using my demonstrated financial hardship?\n\nThank you!",

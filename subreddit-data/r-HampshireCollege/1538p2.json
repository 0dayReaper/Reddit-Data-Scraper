One of my friends volunteers there and sometimes gives rides to shows.  \n\nIn terms of stuff to do in Amherst and Noho, I'm a sucker for the hipster-ish pursuits of reading and drawing in coffee shops.  I spend a lot of time in Northampton, usually at the [Haymarket](http://www.haymarketcafe.com/main.html).  \n\nOn campus, I do a lot of work at ~~Lemelson~~ the Center for Design.  I'm a member of the Blacksmiths' Guild and I'll be signing for the Design Conspiracy next semester.  \n\nI like to think we're pretty awesome.  Hampshire has its downsides, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. \n\nI hope this helps.  If you have more questions, I can do my best to answer them, or ask around until I find someone who can.  ",

They also give free bike repair lessons. Sometimes I forget that there isn't a place like that everywhere. The motorcycle idea sounds fantastic, though. Is there a way that you could do it through Hampshire, or are you thinking of doing the fabrication project on your own? ",

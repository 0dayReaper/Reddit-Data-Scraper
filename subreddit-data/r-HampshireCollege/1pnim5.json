I wrote this note that the band (which keeps talking about freedom of speech and censorship) keeps deleting everywhere they have the power to.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/k%E1%BA%8Fra-pranks/a-clarification-on-the-events-leading-to-shokazobas-removal-from-the-hampshire-h/10151921947694235\n\n\"The notion that the band was simply deemed \"too white\" is a politically motivated farce.\"\n\n\"Contrary to popular belief, it was not their racial composition that lead to their removal, but the behavior which threatened the well being and safety of Hampshire students.\"\n\n\"The group has continued to make this about themselves and divert attention away from the racist, misogynist, and homophobic discussion which was the bottom-line of the decision.\"\n\nHere is another perspective of the story with some different details which also corroborates this (and was also deleted by the band): https://www.facebook.com/groups/3251905306/permalink/10153378955180307/",

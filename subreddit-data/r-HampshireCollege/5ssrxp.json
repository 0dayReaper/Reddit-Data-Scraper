Or at very least give him a shot. The actions of protesters probably leave a lot of people that support him but are afraid to speak up feeling marginalized and it would probably help with them as well by showing them they are not alone.\n\n",

Also I would love to have a chat with you to discuss what you're trying to achieve with the rally? you're just going to get shat on by the libbies.. like this is the shit they live for: protesting",

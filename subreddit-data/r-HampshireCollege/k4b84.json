When you find the person, you hide with them, so one by one people begin disappearing, and the last person is left alone trying to find everyone else! ",

I've been in there so many times but still manage to find new interesting treasures anytime I go in there.",

SO many a great time shave been had.\n\nThe Mount Holyoke Library is also pretty cool place to explore. Infact the whole of Mount Holyoke campus is pretty fun place to explore. Beware of that foul bird(you'll know which one it is when you do meet it. Hint, it will chase you around)\n\nThe Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory is also a cool place to go exploring.(Warning: It might be illegal to go snooping around there so Do so at your own risk)",

    "postText": "I'm transferring to Hampshire. Trying to decide my preference for the housing survey. Usually, it'd be an easy answer: mod. But in that case, I would be living with people I've never met before which may be difficult. Living in a dorm would be the safe route. I am hoping to be put in either a transfer mod or floor, just so it's easier to meet some people in the same situation. Anybody have any insight? ",

I wasn't able to move to Greenwich until my third &amp; final year at Hampshire, though I would have liked to move sooner. The lottery got the best of me. I definitely preferred Greenwich over Merrill (as well as cooking my own food etc.) but I was fortunate to live with some excellent modmates. There's no guarantee that you will get to live with respectful people who clean up after themselves unless (even if) you choose them yourself.\n\nI recommend coming into the dorms, and start sizing people up for modmate material as soon as possible. You get extra lottery points for being a transfer and for being old, assuming things haven't changed that much. Once you're in the mods you can also quit the meal plan &amp; get a farmshare, which is a good way to save money if you are a good cook &amp; a frugal shopper.",

            "comment": "It's a three-way tie between Polina Barskova, Bill Brayton and McKinley Melton. \n\nPolina is the resident Russian professor and has also been a published poet since the age of 15. She is super smart, really funny, and knows absolutely everything about Russian film/literature/history. \n\nBill is the sculpture/advanced drawing prof--also very knowledgeable, and also a very funny and down-to-earth guy. Funny story--first semester last year took his intro to sculpture class, and then second semester I ended up (nude) modeling for his advanced drawing class. A little hard to look him in the eye after that, but I think it was the clincher for getting him on my committee. I mean, how could he say no?\n\nFinally, McKinley teaches world lit. He taught the best literature class that I have ever taken by far. He's also a great critic of essays. With his help, I wrote one of my best pieces for the final. ",

            "comment": "Alicia Ellis and Alan Hodder. Alicia teaches German, European, and Caribbean literature. She is smart and weird and unintentionally (and sometimes intentionally) hilarious. She doesn't take shit and will essentially force you to write well.\n\nAlan teaches comparative religion and focuses in American Transcendentalism and is possibly the most amazing man in the world. I've never taken his classes on Transcendentalism, but his class on the English Bible was the best class I've ever taken at Hampshire. I've also taken his classes on myth and myth theory and mysticism. He is incredibly smart, eloquent, and helpful. And you can tell he puts a ridiculous amount of effort into giving evaluations and reading papers. I've used a lot of superlatives here, but he deserves them.\n\nedit: Also, seriously. \"Your's?\"",

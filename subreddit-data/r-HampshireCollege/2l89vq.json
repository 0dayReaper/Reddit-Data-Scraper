    "postText": "When I was at HC, longboarding that campus was heaven. It's all just one big slope! Smooth! I spent so many nights skating it in various formations and looking at the stars. The roads around the college were potholed and granulely; skate them I did, but the campus itself is like a miracle to a long board. A few times public safety would give me trouble and say no skating on campus, they'd made a new rule in order to rip my heart out, or because some a got hurt... What's the situation like now?",

I was one of the few people who got placed in a double, so I shot the shit with my roommate for a while. 4 minutes into our conversation, he pulls out his vaporizer and asks if I smoke weed. \n\nWe then proceeded to get blitzed out of our minds before going to meet up with our respective orientation groups. I was a bit anxious because I was super stoned and wasn't sure if that was cool or not at orientation(it's hampshire, and I knew about the drug culture, but not the extent of it). My anxiety was eradicated when I got to my group and about half of it was also stoned. We all took our shoes off and played name games while sitting on the grass.\n\nI have since quit smoking weed because I became a Buddhist, for what it's worth :P.",

We discovered we were to be roommates in \"Transfer Mod.\"   When CT found out I was from CA, he simply said, \"I will enjoy watching you break.\"  \"Heh?\" \"There will come a day, probably in February, on which the warmth of the inside will no longer console you.\"\n\nIt took three years, but his schadenfreude was eventually gratified.",

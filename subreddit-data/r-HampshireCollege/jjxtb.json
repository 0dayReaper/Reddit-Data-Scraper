The school is experiencing the stickiest of financial wickets right now, but all the professors at the school are quite intelligent and approachable.  \n\nIt is basically required that you have a personal relationship with your instructors.  This can be intimidating at times, and because there are no grades, students tend to absorb their school performance into their image of self-worth.  There is never enough time to completely finish researching because they always encourage you to work deeper into the material.  With no A+ to shoot for, neurotic students will doubtless go a little crazy.  This terrible struggle going on in students heads creates a prickly hipster cliquey atmosphere that can be abrasive.  \n\nSocial issues are of incredible importance to Hampshire students, and you can be sure that everybody you meet will be really personally involved in whatever it is that they are studying.  It is not too hard to make friends if you're not afraid to get snubbed once in a while.  The dining commons is a fucking shit-hole that exploits its workers.  They all love their jobs and will gladly speak to any student about any stupid crap for hours a day.\n\nYou will have incredible fun and freedom at Hampshire.  You will also work ridiculously hard (occassionally) and rediscover yourself after a (hopefully) brief period of existential crisis.",

            "comment": "In some ways, Hampshire is sort of a real life internet where people do whatever they feel like and talk about any idea that might pass through their heads as if it was a reasonable belief, where they can unabashedly posture as experts on any given subject but where the conditions are such that you can't always immediately tell who knows their shit and who is posturing. The main difference is that white-knights are heavily, heavily overrepresented.\n\nI personally did not like Hampshire very much. The average Hampshire student is probably more interesting than the average student at many universities, but for most, the veneer of intellectualism is so thin that it'd wash off in a drizzle. Most students believe that they are working really hard if they complete the required reading. Some people manage to go the entire four years without learning the basics in their field.\n\nAdmissions standards are not rigorous. The student body is a mixed crowd (though as you'll hear constantly if you attend, it skews wealthy and white, with Los Angeles and New York people very, very heavily represented). \n\nProfessors are a mixed bag. I had a few horrible experiences, a lot of \"eh that was alright what next\" experiences, and a few profoundly important experiences with professors. At the worst, I had a professor (who iirc is still on faculty) give me an objectively bullshit evaluation accusing me of not completing work that I had completed. I took it to the dean who looked over the evidence, told me that it really was complete bullshit and that numerous students had come with similar complaints about the professor, but that there was essentially nothing that could be done about it. The professor in question had told me that my final project didn't fit the guidelines, and I had sent her back a copy of the guidelines showing that it did. Still on my permanent record, though one of the things they don't tell you is that Hampshire's transcript system essentially allows you to edit out evaluations you don't like (up to a point).\n\nThe good professors I had were very good. The professors I had planned on doing my Div III with went on leave, and I scrambled to find two people in my understaffed department to take me on. One of them was a total slouch and quite literally gave me no feedback in the entire eight month Div III process. Once I asked her for her copy of a draft chapter I turned in, which she reluctantly gave me. I thumbed through it and discovered she had printed the first five pages twice and was missing the last five (?!?). \n\nThe other one was the best teacher I've ever worked with. He met very regularly with me, gave me incredibly detailed feedback, and was generally a real mensch. When I turned in my Div III, he caught that one of my chapters was off by a page in the index. There's some attentiveness. At every turn he was instructive without being arrogant and helpful without being guiding. I could not have asked for more, and him and I are still stay in regular contact and have a beer when he comes to town to this day. While this was the best experience I had with a professor, there were several professors I had who were extremely hard-working and whose dedication to the school's professed vision was nothing short of inspiring.\n\nI would say that the drug stuff at Hampshire is very exaggerated. The smell of pot is a pretty accepted factor of dorm life, but once you're past that there is nothing much to differentiate Hampshire from other liberal arts colleges in terms of the prevalence of drug use. The social scene is a bit more cliquey than many colleges, I guess, but just like everywhere else in life, if you're nice to the people you meet you won't have a hard time making friends.\n\nIf you can get into schools with significantly better reputations and well regarded professors in your field and want to go to Hampshire because you like the vibe or the screwy set-up, my advice is that you should go to the better schools. That said, I attended Hampshire, did not work all that hard until the last few months of my Division III, and got into a fully funded top tier Ph.D. program in my very competitive liberal arts field.\n\ntl;dr: Just read the last paragraph.",

I came from a large university and most of my classes transferred over. I imagine that if you transferred before junior year there would be more hassle involved.\n\nTransferring *from* Hampshire is a sort of murky thing that I'm not sure anybody understands all too well. People do it and sometimes schools accept them, that's about all anybody knows. Individual admissions offices have different attitudes about it and you'll never find any solid information on the subject.\n\nI had all sorts of transcript anxiety during the graduate school application process. Essentially, I had very positive evaluations, but a very positive evaluation will generally include some criticism as well. I mean, whoever you are, there's some things you can work on, right? However, it made me very worried that people looking over my evaluations were going to say, \"Oh, i_hold_the_handle didn't participate enough in discussion\" and overlook the good aspects. In many ways the lack of nuance to the A-F grading system works to a student's advantage. \n\nWell, first off, as long as you pass, your grades in college really don't matter. It's hard to fail classes at Hampshire unless you literally do not turn in your final projects, though I've seen people get some really dismal evaluations. But unless you go to graduate school, you can tuck your grades away in a drawer and no employer will look at them again. \n\nIf you do plan to go to graduate school, your Div II and Div III evals are the most important ones. Otherwise your transcript shows brief versions of your evaluations. There's space for long-form versions. Personally, I didn't include any. \n\nI think taking classes at other colleges is the biggest asset for graduate school. Getting good grades at Amherst or Smith shows that you're not just a big fish in a small pond and makes your evaluations look better (plus both schools have a lot of great professors who are worth knowing). I would say that anybody who attends Hampshire and wants to go to graduate school is shooting themselves in the foot if they don't take three or four Amherst classes, and anybody who goes to Hampshire and takes three or four Amherst classes has better bona fides for grad school than one could get at any other school with comparably low admissions standards. Like I said, I worked pretty hard on my Div III but otherwise at no point did I bust my ass (and I did a lot of drugs), and I got into a program with a 2% acceptance rate. Play your cards right, make friends with a few professors, and you can write your ticket.\n\nI think you can get a great education at Hampshire if you want it, but hell, you can get a great education at the library if you want it. A lot of people delude themselves about how much they want it, and Hampshire is set up so as not to burst the bubbles of people who don't know their ass from their elbow but imagine that they are serious intellectuals. \n\nThat said, if you actually are motivated - and you may not know until you actually start doing college work - Hampshire offers plenty of resources. In most universities, professors dumb down the material a bit for undergraduates, and that is generally not the case at Hampshire. I really liked that aspect of it when I had professors who knew their shit, though I often found it tedious when I had professors who were really clueless. I don't think it'd be difficult to choose your professors better than I did, however.\n\nOne thing Hampshire really could use is better writing fundamentals instruction, and if you attend I highly recommend taking Michael Lesy's literary journalism class as soon as possible (his other class is bullshit). He is kind of personally odious and has a bit of a tin-foil hat thing going on but as far as whipping your prose into shape, you could never do better. It is also a classic Hampshire experience. He has a reputation among faculty too, and doing well in his class will open doors for you because everybody knows what a hard-ass he is.\n\nWhat areas of study do you think you might be interested in?",

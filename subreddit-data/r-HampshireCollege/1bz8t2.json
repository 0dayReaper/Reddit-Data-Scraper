This means there was not enough drinking, obviously. \n\nNot really, getting shitfaced and falling head-first into a boulder isn't cool, but this year I didn't get nearly as much as last (thankfully we brought our own supply). \n\nWere there fewer kegs, more tourists, or just less sharing?",

Also, the school has been threatening cracking down and the pubs were out looking for keg stashers the night before.  From what I can tell, people are less likely to purchase kegs than they were in the past because of the increased police presence at school.",

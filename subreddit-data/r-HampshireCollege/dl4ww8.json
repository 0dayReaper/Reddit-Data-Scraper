    "postText": "I\u2019m from Olympia, WA, where Evergreen State College is located. I\u2019ve heard that Hampshire and Evergreen are similar, but Evergreen doesn\u2019t have a great rep here. No shade - both my parent are alumni - but I want to eventually go to law school. I love school and learning a lot, but don\u2019t feel like I thrive in a traditional school setting - and my other option for college is a state school with 22,000 students. Hampshire is really interesting to me, but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible to get into good grad schools? I know it\u2019s really difficult to apply from Evergreen because of their atypical grading system, and it\u2019s generally looked down upon by grad schools.",

I had looked at the alumni success tab on the Hampshire website, and was concerned that there weren\u2019t really examples of people in \u201cacademic\u201d fields - which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but since I think that\u2019s the area I\u2019m interested in currently, it was a factor.",

            "comment": "As far as I am aware, the 3 graduate schools that Hampshire grads most often attend are 1). UMass Amherst 2). Harvard University 3). Yale University. \n\nHampshire is ranked in the top 40 schools in the US that go on to produce the most amount of PhD recipients. \n\nAt a faculty panel at Amherst College, when asked about their favorite types of students, the Amherst faculty looked at each other, smiled, and proudly said, \u201cHampshire students\u201d. \n\nHampshire gets different raps, but academics and, perhaps more notably, graduate schools themselves absolutely love Hampshire students. If you\u2019re interested in focusing on your post-grad education, Hampshire College is an excellent choice for a jumping off point. Grad schools love us!\n\n-Current sophomore at Hampshire",

If anything, I think its easier to find your place in a school that has a huge number of niches. I'm in a program with only 8 students. And sure, while some smaller schools have \"build your own\" degrees, what they're missing out on is the specialized and specific courses to back up said degrees. While its intimidating at first, taking these courses lets you find people that are genuinely interested in the same things as you and makes it a lot easier to find your place. \n\nThere's other benefits to large state schools too, like the gigantic amount of research opportunities, the prestige that comes from attending a school everybody's heard of, well funded clubs, and cheaper tuition.",

It's been in the news a lot, and its not good. No doubt COA will be extremely expensive, the low budgets mean that it'll be harder for you to find professors, do activities, etc, and now it seems you might end up graduating from a defunct university. You also have that lost year which will no doubt destroy a lot of institutional resources that people rely on such as club leadership, mentoring, etc.",

If you do decently well at Hampshire, you'll do fine in graduate school admissions. People might tell you that the lack of grades hurts, but it really doesn't.\n\n(Plus, it's surprisingly easy to hack your GPA by taking a small number of 5 college courses and making sure to do well in them.)",

She is one of the most well-spoken people I've ever met, and the class I took with her (History of Political Theory) was fantastic and stretched my mind in new directions. It was one of the most challenging and rewarding classes I've taken at Hampshire. She pays special attention to who is left out of history and philosophy - like women and minorities. Her classes are generally political philosophy, with a focus on critical race theory. She was also my first year adviser, and is fabulous at working with you to figure out what you want to do, and how you can do it. She's the only philosophy professor I've worked with, so I can't speak to the rest of the department, but if she's any indication of the quality of faculty, you can't do better. ",

From what I've read, I definitely associate myself more with the analytical school of thought whereas Hampshire seems to host more of a Continental-style of faculty. Despite this, I really enjoyed Professor Cox's *Nietzsche* and am still in a state where I am philosophically \"moldable\". ",

I didn't personally like Christoph (Cox) very much, I thought he wasn't particularly good at following students' lines of arguments and using them to guide learning. I thought he had a strong tendency to simply over-argue a student who was still learning ideas and basically tell them they were wrong, it didn't make for the type of classroom a discussion-based philosophy class needs (which most philosophy classes at Hampshire are). I took lots of classes with Westphal, who is a little scatter brained but very knowledgeable and good to work with (unless you need something specific from him, like a rec). \n\nLots of people are peripherally interested in political philosophy, but often call themselves something else, like Margaret Cerullo who absolutely is political and knows philosophy, but is a sociologist. So it's complicated.\n\nAt Amherst, I would take classes with Adam Sitze. He's a legal rather than a political philosopher (the distinction is pretty small), but he's incredible, probably one of my favorite proffs. ever. He's also weirdly humble, which is unusual. Hope that's at least a little helpful.",

As for advice, you can do whatever you want, so its up to you to figure it out, studying \"philosophy\" is probably too general, and your advisors will want you to get more specific in terms of what sort of philosophy or what questions you are interested in- you say metaphysics and political philosophy and you'll probably want to get even much more specific than that.

There are certainly people in the Analytic tradition who are members of the left (Chomsky and Putnam come to mind) and certainly members who were from the continental tradition who were considered leftists (Zizek, Foucault). Ontology isn't exclusively continental, of course. As someone who is relatively new to all this I shouldn't be quick to slap a label. Undoubtedly both traditions have valuable and intelligent things to say and I should probably actually take a few courses before making an argument for either of them!",

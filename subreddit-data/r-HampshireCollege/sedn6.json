Lots of skinny dipping there while its warm out, but be aware that the residents of South Hadley do not appreciate Hampshire students on their property and the cops WILL stroll by every few hours. Only \"residents of South Hadley\" are allowed, which means not you.",

That's arbitrary, obviously, but certain sections of the woods and private spaces like mods (where everyone has opted in) and personal rooms are good nudist spaces. I would recommend caution when visiting the reservoir, we aren't legally allowed to be there and it is patrolled by law enforcement semi regularly. I've never heard of any actual ticketing or arrest but plenty of people i know have gotten hassled by cops there while naked.",

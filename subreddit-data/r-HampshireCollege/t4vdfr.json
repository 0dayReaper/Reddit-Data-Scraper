    "postText": "I'm an international student but I got my admission decision wayyyyyyy to early. I didn't apply for ED, I went for RD. I got my admission update on Feb 28 and the admission dates come out in April 1st. That's like one month earlier which is filling my head with questions. I sent my application around December 24 and the College downloaded it on Christmas day\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05. A Christmas present from me to them, I guess. Can someone please explain why? Cause others Haven't received their decisions and I'm also able to join the Facebook group for admitted students.",

Many buildings (the library being one of them) have needed MAJOR renovations for 3, 4, 5, or even 10 years now. \n\nSo next time you lament how little money there is for you to film your Div III or how old the equipment in Cole is, know that the reason no one cares is that Hampshire is LITERALLY falling apart.",

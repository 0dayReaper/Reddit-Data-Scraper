    "postText": "Law Program Human Rights Films Series:\n\nA series of films old and new dealing with a range of topics in human rights will be screened by the Hampshire Law Program during the Fall 2011 semester. Starting off with the 1961 Hollywood blockbuster \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", the series continued with \"The Specialist\", a documentary on Nazi Final Solution bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem. Please join us for the next installments. Pizza and drinks will be provided.\nAll screenings at 7pm.\n\nOctober 17, FPH 105: \"Calling the Ghosts\" (1996, 60 minutes running time). Two Bosnian women, a lawyer and a judge, are imprisoned in a Serbian rape camp during the Bosnian war. They survive and search for justice for women like themselves whose lives have been devastated by systematic sexual abuse inflicted as part of a genocidal campaign. Written primarily by the women themselves, this documentary explores what it means to be raped because of one's gender and ethnic identity and how victims might begin to think about what justice, and life after, might look like. In Serbo-Croatian with English subtitles.\n\nOctober 24, FPH 101: \"Long Night's Journey into Day\". Dramatic documentary footage of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, bringing survivors of racist repression under apartheid face to face with government torturers and killers.

Running time 94 minutes.\n\nNovember 7, in FPH 101: \"The Secret in Their Eyes\" (El Secreto en sus Ojos). Argentina, 2009, in Spanish with English subtitles. A nerve-wracking fictional thriller about the Dirty War (1977-1983) and its aftermath twenty years later. A government death squad thug gets away with a brutal political murder...or does he?

    "postText": "ResLife is hiring new house interns for Fall 2012 (and orientation leaders)! Being an intern is pretty much the best paid work-study job you'll find on campus (although you can still apply if you don't have work-study). I'm currently an intern in the mods and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the application process/job description/reality of being a house intern. Or you can go to one of the million info sessions we're having soon and ask your questions there. Here's more info: http://www.hampshire.edu/studentlife/apply.htm",

Reading an admissions essay doesn't come with a checklist, but it usually involves looking for depth or insight.  Your essay is spread too thin to really achieve either.  Pick one or two of the things in your list and develop on them.  Otherwise you're just parroting back the admissions publications.",

You like a place that embraces individuality? So does pretty much everyone, and we don't have anywhere near enough space for everyone.",

You could articulate your point safer by merely blanketing it with phrasing like:\n\n\"...coming from a very conservative high school that is not very accepting of anyone who is \u201cother,\" like members of various countercultures, sexual orientations, and racial ethnicities.\"\n\nOr you could simply say that you come from a conservative high school with a very narrow approach to diversity, which is completely opposite of what Hampshire advertises.\n\nRegardless of what you choose to do, listing them off like that could get messy depending on whoever reads it purely based off of silly semantics or what you have chosen to include/exclude in your examples.\n\nYes, some people are that anal.",

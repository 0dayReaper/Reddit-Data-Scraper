I joined the incoming students page on facebook and was a little offput by the people that were commenting. It seemed like people who were kind of uptight and political and not the kind of chaps I'd hang out with. However, I'm sure there are lots of kinds of people there, so What can you tell me about the school?",

On any online forum, you're likely to see more vocal, uptight people and less likely to see people who are chill to be around.  I am neither uptight nor political, and I LOVED Hampshire.  I was a transfer student too (from Denison University), and I hated the Greek life and the culture from my frist school.  Let me know if you have any questions!",

What do the hampshire kids do for fun? at first I was worried that its so small but it seems like they are keen on making their own fun and the bus system really helps to get to Noho and other places nearby.

I can't speak for everyone at Hampshire.  But what did I do for fun?  First, I was lucky enough to find a really amazing group of friends, which is why I had such a good time.  It would be easier for you to tell me what you like to do, and I could tell you how well Hampshire's community coincides with your lifestyle.  People can have vastly different experiences and lifestyles at Hampshire.  But for me, I had picnics, swam in the reservoir, ran in the fields and nearby trails, went to awesome parties, watched a lot of movies in bed with my friends, drank and smoked too much (especially the first year), took walks with my friends, cooked dinners with friends, etc.  There is generally a lot of drinking and smoking, but people are also tolerant of others' choices to abstain.\n\nThe bus system can be a pain in the ass sometimes, especially in the winter, but it mostly does the trick and getting around isn't normally a problem.  I have a lot of friends that take the bus everyday and don't have complaints about it.  However, some people do complain about it because sometimes it can be a bitch.  Despite that buses are occasionally late, it usually will get you to anywhere in the area: Noho, Amherst, Hadley.  And if you need a car, there is usually someone around to help.  Basically: it's not perfect, but it works.\n\nI have to be honest; sometimes I would get really frustrated with Hampshire students, especially the younger ones.  However, my best friends ended up being first years as well.  But the chillest people and the ones who will be the most fun to be around are the older students.  The hardest part about Hampshire for me was that since the campus is so small, it is impossible to escape social drama even when you aren't directly involved.  People who end up living off campus generally have a much better experience because they get the best of both worlds: control of personal and social space; connection to the unique Hampshire community.\n\nI really recommend visiting to get a sense of the students at Hampshire.\n\nLet me know if you want more info (I'm in need of distraction).",

I play instruments too and would be interested in jamming with people for sure. Other than I like pretty much anything to be honest. My interests are all over the place and I'm just looking for people who like to laugh and be merry. I'm also applying to Wesleyan University and I'm finding it difficult figuring out which one I prefer. So far, both reputations fit what I'm looking for but I thought that about BU when I first came here. So important question. If you had to pick one event or memory or anything to describe your hampshire experience, what would it be?",

One of the first times I hung out with them involved me going over to one of their practices and just hanging out while they played and chilled in one the school buildings.  The music scene at Hampshire is thriving and very interesting - noise, dubstep, rap, world music and dance - and as far as I know, there are definitely opportunities to be in bands.  However, I am not a musician, and I am not the best person to ask.  If you're looking for a different kind of music scene, more serious pursuits, you can take classes and meet people at one of the other 4 schools as well.  I can't imagine any musician having trouble finding the right scene for them, but who knows for sure.\n\nEdit: certain personal things for certain personal reasons.",

As a transfer student you'll meet different people and have different experiences than first years and younger students. At least in my experience, Hampshire gears transfer students more toward academics than some of Hampshire's other aspects, and you'll meet lots of people with similar interests through that. There are lots of chill people here, but you might have to pick through the more vocal ones to find them. My modmate transferred from BU to here (I think she spent one semester there and then did a year and a half at a CC in California), and she has a bangin' social life at Camp Hamp. I'm not exactly sure why she transferred, but I know she looooooves Hampshire. She's not one of those political types either. I would imagine Boston might have just been too much for her.\n\nI think I would have hated Hampshire as a first year, but it was honestly the perfect place for me as a transfer, even though I didn't admit that to myself until my second year here. Being here has opened up so many doors for my future, and I have an amazing support group of friends and faculty. All that aside, the bureaucratic stuff sort of drives me up a wall sometimes, and you'll find a lot of Hampshire students agree. Some people decide the bad outweighs the good, but I've definitely found the opposite. I'm actually madly in love with this ridiculous place. Please let me know if you have any more questions. Good luck with your decision!",

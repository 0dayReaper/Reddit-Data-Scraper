Allen signed a behavioral contract that they then violated, more than once.\n\nTheir persistent behavior frightens their classmates, and disrupts the educational process.\n\nThis student also states that Hampshire College refused to provide medical and pharmaceutical support. The college helped this student obtain an Autism diagnosis, but can not provide this student with the pharmaceuticals that this student needs. The college does not run a pharmacy. This student needs to utilize Medicaid to obtain the appropriate medications. NB: Autism has no standard protocol for medical treatment.\n\nIn my uneducated opinion, Iris Allen is not ready for a college education, and needs to stabilize their illness before they can be receptive to what Hampshire College can offer. Hampshire is a private liberal arts college, and not a social services institution.",

I do not disrupt anything on campus or the education process as well. I have a schedule i follow every day as i have anxiety when there is an unforseeable change. The school is obligated to provide me with my meds and did not provide me with them unless i was to see a new psychiatrist on a different campus to be re diagnosed. please before you judge my character, inform yourself on what has happened.

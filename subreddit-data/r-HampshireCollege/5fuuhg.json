I know that Fox News is... well..  Fox News..  but I wanted your take on where he got it from.  Please set the record straight.",

            "comment": "&gt;and students pick their majors some of them listed are degrees in ultimate frisbee and basket weaving\n\nThe student who \"majored in ultimate frisbee\" is [Johnny Dwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Dwork), a weird pseudo-celebrity who performed at the Rose Bowl and Madison Square Garden and was featured on network sports programs / Sesame St in the early 80s before attending college. His Div III (available in the Hampshire College Library along with every other Div III), was reportedly equal parts performance and business management.\n\nI'm not sure why O'Riley feels that a BFA in basket weaving is any less valuable than a BFA in painting or sculpting... basket weaving can be very difficult and take years to learn! But that's not really the point, is it?\n\nFWIW, most of my friends were either social scientists or film makers, and around 50% of them now hold masters degrees in various fields (biology, library sciences, art history, film, painting, etc). Every school has lazy graduates and weird seemingly useless degrees (I mean, you can get a BFA in Interior Design at Bill's alma mater...), but that doesn't mean that those individual quirks should represent the school as a whole.

It appears to me that they were just grossly exaggerating Hampshire's academic structure where it's expected to be interdisciplinary and each student can decide what they want to study and the means on how to do so. \n\nBasically, they're undermining the rigor of their academic framework in a way that just makes Hampshire seem like they're on the very margins of academia to have their students and faculty lose credibility as a post-secondary institution.",

            "comment": "Hampshire students are graded, but our feedback comes in the form of written evaluations. Rather than get a letter or number, we get specific critiques on our work in each class from our professors after every semester. We are able to pick our own majors. However, in order to graduate, we have to produce a yearlong, academically challenging project contributing to our chosen area of study, in addition to attending classes. This project is overseen by a committee of professors, and is called a Division III. For that reason, most students would never choose to major in something without a good amount of academic heft behind it- good luck coming up with a solid Div III on playing ultimate frisbee.",

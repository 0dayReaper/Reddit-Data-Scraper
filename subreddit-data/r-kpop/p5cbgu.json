So all in all this song is a GROWER. For me, this is Russian Roulette's older more mature sister. Russian Roulette had the same effect on me in that it was nothing groundbreaking upon initial listen but it gets better and better the more you listen to it until you realize it's actually lowkey a banger. Queendom definitely got that infectious melody I KNOW will be stuck in my head for the next few months lmao. God damn it Red Velvet have done it again.",

I\u2019ve loved the content since Psycho but nothing compares to seeing and hearing all 5 of them together. \n\nI really liked this song! It feels like a good upbeat song to end the summer with and the lyrics are great. Even if it\u2019s safer than their more experimental tracks, it just fills me with warmth. \n\nHopefully we get some more releases this year (along with something Velvet)! It must be difficult to figure out where on the pendulum swing to land for a RV comeback. I feel like they usually lean very experimental or very traditional - but whenever they release one style, people yearn for the other. Every now and then they catch the pendulum right in the middle and make something universally loved that pushes boundaries without going too far for general audiences, but that\u2019s easier said than done.",

This track is ever so slightly off brand for me in terms of the bright, upbeat tracks I enjoy. If ever a song didn't need a rap verse it's this one. \ud83d\ude02 Admittedly, I'm somewhat cynical when it comes to big 3 releases because they tend to check all the boxes in terms of production, songwriting, etc and so it comes down to the group/artist to make or break the song. Queendom is a great song and RV are really good in their particular niche. It just didn't wow me. I do feel like this is going to crush every other release at music shows because most of the songs with this kind of vibe were released way earlier in the summer. As I said before, I'm not a Reveluv but I get the feeling that this may be a somewhat divisive title track given the more recent mature, sophisticated concepts they were doing last year.",

            "comment": "This was a really interesting behind the scenes look on the casting of idols from a top mid sized company. \n\nI have conflicting feelings on some stuff. Tons of this is (good) looks based but I mean... the industry is basically models who can sing and dance. It has been pretty much from the start. So while I disapprove of such focus and value being placed on looks, it's a fundamental part of the industry and even those who say they want it changed would likely still end up larger fans of the idols who were pretty and handsome and less often those average or below average looking. That part is somewhat human nature. \n\nThe age thing... So I strongly believe the SK government should put in place restrictions on how many hours trainees who are minors can train in order for them to still attend middle and high school (in order to graduate) and to protect them from overworking. I also believe trainees who debut as minors should have hour per week restrictions, and the restrictions be so conservative that it effectively kills the industry debuting minors. If you need your idols to work (content shoots, dance practice, lessons, song recording sessions, performing, music shows and don't forget travel time) 80-100 hours a week and you're underage idol is restricted to 35 or 40 hours a week, there's no way their company debuts them with the team. They just can't be part of enough of the groups activities to be considered an active member of the group. They'd only be able to legally do music shows, shoot M/V's and do limited practicing. This is my dream for the industry. Trainees have to wait until they are 20 to debut which means companies will likely adjust by looking for older trainees. Signing 11-14 year olds doesn't make sense when the earliest they can debut is at 20 years old. It would allow them to cast 17-18 year olds and train them for 2-3 years and then debut them. \n\nSo, in this video they, as the casting team, are looking for 15 year olds. It seems weird, for sure, but I don't think the industry will ever, no matter what, work in such a way that they are looking for adult trainees. Of course you need to train for years before you debut and if you, in a perfect world, had the debut age at 20, you'd still want 15-17 year olds so they have 3-5 years to train. So while I don't like teens being involved in the adult world of work, it's a reality for some industries. Just like with athletics, if you want to be in the Olympics or go pro you get scouted as a young teen or younger, go to Academies, get a coach and train. \n\nLastly, while \"we're looking for tall and thin\" is annoying (ENG subs so I can't speak to how accurately the sub translates what she said), at least it seems like their diet schedule is real meals and as Shuhua says; not just all salads like it used to be in her day. The \"we've changed\" from the casting employee, if not just for the camera, was encouraging. Assuming of course the portions aren't unhealthily small or something (not sure, can't read the Korean written on the piece of paper). \n\nRandom thoughts: \n\n1. The everyone being a fan of HYBE during the street casting interviews was hilarious. As was Shuhua saying \"I don't like CUBE, I'm going to HYBE\" at the end during the cookie scene, lol. \n2. It's wild, in a \"companies just don't use common sense\" type of way, that companies don't work with their successful talent in order to improve their casting and other departments of their company. Shuhua and the guy basically having no clue how casting actually works, not having met the staff, not knowing what has changed and not really knowing the trainees... If I was in charge of say CUBE I'd have done interviews with my successful idols to get their opinions on every aspect of their experience while at the company while they were trainees. Then get them shadowing the departments they had issues with in order to see how they actually work and then come back, have another meeting and tell me what they think. What can be improved? What's not working? etc. I'd also strongly encourage my idols to mentor the trainees. Who better could educate them, encourage them and give them useful tips than my successful idols? Most definitely so when it comes to Soyeon. Having her mentor and help create other groups on TV but not for your own company is the definition of moronic and misuse of your valuable assets. \n3. The trainees complaining about their tablets freezing and Shuhua saying they had that exact problem during her day 5 years ago and then ripping on CUBE. Lmao. Man, come on CUBE, the A/C in the dance room is broken, the fridge is broken, the tablets freeze up? You're rep is not great. Lol.",

Also work need to be paid, I don't think the rate per hour of successful idols is something you want to pay without putting them in front of a camera and getting something for it. xD",

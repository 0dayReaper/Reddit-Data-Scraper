However, It\u2019s less about the money made from streams, and more about the exposure these smaller groups get from having their music on these platforms that is important. \n\nAs a new content creator/livestreamer, i\u2019m in a similar situation. I know that I don\u2019t make that much per view on YouTube or per Twitch viewer who watches an add on my livestream. The money is found in those who enjoy my content enough to support me directly via Twitch subs or donations, and the only way to find people to support me is to try and get eyes on my product.\n\nLikewise for these groups in small companies, music streams like Spotify and YouTube are the easiest (maybe even only) way to get people to be exposed to their product. They rely on having these streams to attract new fans, and hopefully some of these new fans will be able to support them better via merch, and more importantly added exposure to the fans own circle.\n\nTl;dr - Streams are important due to exposure not money.",

A part of me was happy about it hoping that people would swap over to streaming services like apple music since they pay artists more per play than spotify (which really adds up), granted I'm well aware of why spotify is so popular with its playlists and social features. Ultimately what Kakao did wasn't professional, but I do wish spotify had to compromise more for trying to dominate a global market.",

When I was young and told people I'm Korean, I heard the same old \"You're Korean? North or South?\" or \"You're Korean? Is that any different from Chinese?\" and so many ignorant racist Asian jokes with no sense of hope that people would learn to know better.\n\nBut, to see the conversation shift in recent years, where people instead now ask me about Korean culture, like Parasite (the Best Picture winner this year) and BTS instead is so gratifying. I feel like I finally know what it's like to be seen and heard in a country so diverse and I hope we can keep the conversation going so that future generations can feel this same sense of visibility as well. Congrats BTS! You boys deserve it.",

When I was a kid in the 90s/00s, liking anime or manga was considered \"nerdy\" and kids were made fun of for liking it. Now I see groups of students walk around wearing anime shirts and wearing K-Pop merch. I bring up BTS/K-Pop during my lessons every so often because my students know I'm a fan, and the response is overwhelmingly positive. I'm so thankful for this shift and I'm sure BTS played a huge role in it. I hope this shift continues even further!",

Despite our underwhelming presence in American Hollywood K-pop has provided an outlet of representation and the growing popularity of it makes me proud. It has tackled the issue of Asian men being undesirable in the dating scene for example. May BTS continue rising.",

People always just assumed I was Chinese. Now from BTS and kpop to Parasite to Korean cuisine to esports even, it's just been awesome to see Korea gain more and more cultural and economic relevancy. Like you say, we're visible now. Korea is more than just that country that suffered from so many years of war and its people are incredibly strong and vibrant.",

We've had to work so hard precisely because radio play is such a huge factor for charting in the US, and it's a huge wall we've had to overcome on our own. If it were't so important we would have achieved that #1 ages ago. \n\nDynamite debuted GOLD with over 500K units sold and 33.9 streams in the US. Even without radio play we might have gotten that #1. On debuted #4 with ~86K first week digital streams, and Dynamite got ~265K. Dynamite outperformed On and BWL combined. This comeback is everything. \n\nI'm so proud right now.",

I mean it\u2019s old to bring this up at this point but I still cannot shake the fact that just a few years ago they were written off in their home country just because they weren\u2019t from a \u201cbig company\u201d and didn\u2019t have the kpop \u201cvisuals\u201d apparently to make it big. They overcame all of that and talked about problems we face during youth (their drags on how the Asian school system unfairly operates and parental expectations was my SHIT) and literally took over the entire world let alone their own country. They showed its really possible, and have brought in many new fans to enjoy the Kpop genre. Thank you BTS, and congratulations, y\u2019all deserve it!",

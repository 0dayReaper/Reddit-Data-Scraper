Social distancing was still recommended but the govt had just lifted all previous restrictions in light of low case numbers, just to put them back after the infection spike. I\u2019m mostly saying this because, to this day, I see a lot of intl fans confused and spreading this story with an incorrect narrative.\n\nI understand people being disappointed still, but if I were, I\u2019d also have to be disappointed in like 50%+ of my coworkers who also went out and enjoyed the nice weather and lack of restrictions in Seoul that weekend \ud83d\ude1e Sometimes it can be a little hard to explain how different things were in Korea through the pandemic compared to other countries.",

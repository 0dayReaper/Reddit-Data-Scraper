We will reveal when the album release time is confirmed.\"\n\n&gt; Red Velvet's first unit will be born.\n\n&gt; According to SpoTVNews on the 21st, Red Velvet's Seulgi &amp; Irene are preparing to debut as a unit.\n\n&gt; This is the first unit to come from Red Velvet after 6 years since their debut. Seulgi &amp; Irene recently were confirmed to debut as a duet unit and are preparing full-scale. Although the time isn't confirmed, they are currently putting their heart and soul into finishing the last stages of the album.\n\n&gt; Seulgi &amp; Irene will show an explosive reaction from fans in Korea &amp; overseas as they are a combination that fans wanted as a unit for a long time. The two were the first SMRookies unit during their predebut days as SR14G Seulgi &amp; Irene. At the time they newly remade S.E.S's Be Natural &amp; received a lot of attention starting from before their debut with the two's energetic and sensual performance.\n\n&gt; Six years after their debut, Seulgi &amp; Irene are receiving attention as \"best of the best unit\". Perfectly equipped from their beautiful visuals to outstanding singing abilities in their colorful performances, and globally loved charms, expectations are high for what appearance they will show to write new records in K-pop as Red Velvet's first unit.\n\nNote: The article writes Seulgi, Irene but I thought that sounded awkward so I wrote Seulgi &amp; Irene instead\n\n[Be Natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZ9je4xSIY) cover that the article mentions\n\nEveryone's been expecting this with not only their Nylon Korea magazine shoot but the fact that Seulgi &amp; Irene kept being shown recording together... It was kind of obvious but Reveluvs are clowns anyway.. Guess we aren't today.",

Besides that started after member solos started anyway from what i recall. It's just a smidge worrying knowing how old the girls are in an ageist industry especially for women and that this is roughly about the time the previous 3 sm groups have had solos started. And from what I've seen over the years it's seems a lot of Shawols believe member(s) didn't want to do unit work earlier on and later even songs that would start out for a unit would end up OT5 in the end anyway. Idk just me being worried considering how sm already treats is female artists.",

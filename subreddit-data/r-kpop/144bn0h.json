Based on what people have dug up on the metadata for the first picture they dropped, this has been in the works since last year. I think it's safe to say at this point, if they aren't actively releasing something or promoting, they are working on cooking something up lol.",

So \u201cZyo\u201d in a Korean pronunciation would come out really really close to sounding the same as \u201cJihyo\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re right though, it\u2019s probably the album name, I would guess.",

For that last part, she used the Korean word for \u201cblah blah blah\u201d which is seen as feminist slang and so of course that\u2019s like a death sentence for a female idol. \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo it meant she had to write that two page apology, talking about so much personal stuff that she really shouldn\u2019t have had to.

            "comment": "I'm so excited but I'm so curious!!!!! Is this a typical K-pop song (BPM, EDM, Dance Pop, etc) or will she do something different??? She has Taeyeon, Jeong Eun Ji (APink), Hyolyn and Chungha to her (IMO) so I'd love to see her go in those directions rather than just your standard K-pop. The Alcohol-Free, Dance the Night Away, and the like are great for TWICE but Jihyo? Go for INVU, Queen of Hearts (I'd die for rock), Killing Me, Love Me Out Loud, and Beautiful Monster style of songs. Music that feature vocal melodies, closer to ballad than your standard K-pop songs. Taeyeon solo music basically. \n\nHot take: Jihyo has always been my favorite in TWICE but since I started listening to them I've thought her vocal tone sounds of out place in such a poppy group. I can't really explain what her voice sounds like but it just sounds out of place with the higher pitch pop music that TWICE makes. This was really confirmed when I'd listen to music like 'Jaljayo Good Night', 'Queen of Hearts', her [Melody TV project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjbl7J6ZmU), and most of all her [OST 'I Fly'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4qYo13TSdY) which she absolutely destroys. On her own and outside of higher pitched pop music she shines so freaking bright. It's where her tone was made to be used. It's like how I'm sure Adele in a girly pop group would sound out of place. That's what I'm talking about. I feel pretty much the same way for a lot of the same reasons with Eunji from APink. They're just rich voices that thrive in that mid-tone and can sound somewhat out of place in those high tone/pitch pop songs. \n\nI don't think I'll be disappointed because she's gone in the direction I'd like with her solo projects like 'Crown' and 'Nightmare', which she wrote and composed by herself and is accompanied by a band. So, especially if she has written/composed this solo debut, I expect her to continue with music that focuses on vocal melody and utilizes bands over electronic pop sounds. \n\nWhich reminds me, assuming this solo debut isn't just a special single release, it'd be great if 'Nightmare' was released on the album.",

She's what made me give KPOP a chance and is literally my ult-of-ults, but I've always thought that her rich, soulful tone was more suited to other genres. Jaljalayo Good Night, her cover of A Late Night of 1994, and I Fly are literally songs that I had on repeat especially because of how godly she sounds. I'd also add Blame It On Me and Crazy Stupid Love in their latest albums where she sounded especially full and rich :') (That said, I still go crazy for her parts in all the other songs, HAHA)\n\nA worry that I have though is that these songs typically don't call for the sharp, powerful choreo she's known for (and that I crave, haha \ud83d\ude2d) Hope she finds a way to use her vocal tone and her dance abilities to their full potential for the title track ;u;",

They have vocals like Jihyo (powerful, soulful, rich, etc) but they both have put out songs that they can sing while dancing powerful/beautiful choreo's. It's not like I am opposed to Jihyo putting out some electronic K-pop songs and having a blast while dancing her butt off, but I just hope those are rare changes of pace (like summer singles) and not the main meat of her solo career. A song like 'The Feels' I could see her releasing as a soloist and having a blast performing on stage with a dance team. She was the highlight of that songs dance choreo.",

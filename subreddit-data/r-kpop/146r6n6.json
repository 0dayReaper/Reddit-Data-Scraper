I know we know they made their songs but the level of involvment considering they even make the guide of the songs themselves, directing the recording and so on and so forth. I am in absolute awe of their artistry. They really really make it look so easy when I bet it is anything BUT easy and how much effort they dedicate themselves over their music. They are not joking when it comes to music, they are so serious, it is their breath that they took, I bet. I love this glimpse we have of them working behind their music. I hope they will have more of this kind of content because they deserve all the appreciation in this world.\n\n\n\nOn that same serious note, lets applaud Chan for another all-black outfit. At this rate, he will be colour blind coz the only colour he recognize will be black. And thank you for infecting the rest of 3RACHA coz last time I check Changbin and Han used to wear colours and now they are similarly decked in black black and all black. I fee like gifting them an All Blacks shirt at this point just for the irony of it.",

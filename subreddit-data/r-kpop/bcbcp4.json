The flow is super fun and it's definitely a great Spring/Summer track. \n\nI also think it's super clever how they've used Halsey's feature, I know she's more present in the album version of this track, but I like that they didn't give her a verse and let her voice flow into the chorus with theirs. It gives them much less of a headache when it comes to live performances and still gives them the benefits of having a featured artist.",

I love her voice in the chorus, it's just sweet enough.

The follow up with J-Hope was cool too (especially that vocal processing). \n\nSecond: RM killed it too. I kept waiting for his part to come in and it was excellent - well worth the wait. \n\nThird: Halsey fit in the MV well. I was worried her part would be overpowering but it was a good blend without distracting from BTS. Apparently the album version has a longer feature from her but I haven\u2019t checked it out yet. \n\nThe chorus is good. The first verse didn\u2019t leave an impression on me either way. \n\nThis color palette is bright as hell and reminds me of the super saturated DNA look. Unlike DNA though I didn\u2019t see any distinct choreo that I can remember like the arm touch, but I\u2019ll chalk that up to the MV moving too quickly. Only bad scene was the CGI at the end where it\u2019s clear the guys are in front of a green screen.",

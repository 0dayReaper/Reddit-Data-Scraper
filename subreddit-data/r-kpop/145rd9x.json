Hence the low number ;)\n\nStill waiting to buy the thing. Didn't like the title song this time (a bit \"too much\" in parts) so hoping the b sides are better.",

I got into KARD last year because \"Ring the Alarm\" was so good, but I love \"icky\" even more. Every song is great. \n\n\"Without You\" was already one of my favorites of the year when it was released earlier. I love the summery vibes in the beat. \n\nBut \"Icky\" is a straight banger. Just so much fun &amp; so hot! Somin's vocals are stellar and the \"ay ay ay\" lives rent free in my head.\n\nThe B-sides are also fantastic! \"Been That Boy\" is my favorite and BM's raps are so fire on it. I can't help dancing to \"Cake\" and \"Fxxk You\" is so good, too!\n\n10/10, no complaints.",

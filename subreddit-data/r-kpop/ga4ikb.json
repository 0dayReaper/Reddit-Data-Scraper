Well, actually Twice's next comeback might be the measuring stick to most companies whether idols can get into open relationships. \n\nOn the surface level, all's good. Twitter is trending with blessings, fans seems to not care about the shotgun marriage but the reality is if these blessings don't translate into cold figures, the capitalist mechanism behind idol industry will find some other idols to push (just like how SM is pushing NCT over EXO already). In the crazy competitive world of kpop, someone will be willing to sell the \"I am married to my fans\" dream and there are big spenders (whales) who are willing to switch their support to the idols that \"dedicates themselves to them\". \n\nHonestly I hate this, music industry should be about the music and performance, but the idol industry is such a different beast...so I guess kpop's fate is really in the hands of the fans to vote with their wallets, to show relationships doesn't affect sales.",

Super Junior\u2019s Sungmin was essentially kicked out of the group for getting married, but no one cares about Big Bang\u2019s Taeyang. Kai and Baekhyun have both publicly dated people, and despite backlash at the time, Exo is still loved and still grew incredibly popular despite dating \u201cscandals.\u201d",

Even though idol relationships are still \"scandalous,\" they're not necessarily a career-killer anymore (I doubt that Twice's comeback will be heavily affected by Momo and Jihyo's relationships). Chen's marriage would have been controversial no matter what, but the Korean comments from random bystanders seem to find an idol being a *father* more unacceptable than just being a husband. I've seen a bunch of comments that don't seem to be from angry fans or antis, or even particularly harsh toward him, they're just like \u2013 \"Shouldn't he just go solo? How can a father be in an idol group?\" as if it's just obvious that that would be unacceptable. I don't think there's really a precedent for this. I hope that it becomes more normalized to everyone by the time his enlistment ends and group promos seem to be in EXO's future.",

However I kind of feel like for the industry in general this is one of the best things that could've happened. I'm not an exo-fan but if they can just keep promoting and doing well as they are with Chen as a husband and father, I think this will set a good precedent in the industry.\n\nIt will show that it's perfectly possible for an idol to both work and have a family and hopefully serve as evidence against people who use similar claims as justification for their hateful views. (Like fans who claim Chen has harmed exo by getting married and should be banned for it.)\n\nI kind of feel like by the time Chen has finished his military service and with exo ranking amongst the more established groups with considerable longevity, most of the criticism will have blown over by the time he comes out of service. As it will fall under the category of 'old news' and the general population will have long moved on to juicier and fresher gossip and scandals.\n\nThat being said I'm not Korean, so I have no idea how big the blow-up has been in their Korean fandom, you don't know if the people that are angry are outliers or represent the majority so I could be completely off here.",

You hear about some nasty comments and protests but honestly online it's usually the 'crazy' fans that are noticed, while others that don't care aren't as vocal. It's not uncommon to see 1 hateful comment and then 99 comments calling out haters, making the issue seem more controversial then it actually is. So honestly idk, it'd be kind of interesting to see a poll or something to get a grasp on the overall feelings inside the fandom. But of course that'll never happen.\n\nI don't know about either Sungmin's or Henry's cases in any detail. But honestly I feel like Sungmin's case was handled about as badly as it could've been. Rumours got out, they were denied, then kind of confirmed but not really. It also didn't appear that his fellow members or SM were quite ready to back him up either. While I kind of feel like with Chen they are kind of being a uniform front? Like with Sungmin I know there were some members apologizing for the situation to fans. While exo and SM now are seemingly far more unapologetic about it. Like with Sungmin I felt like they kinda tried to cover up and apologize and cringe away like Sungmin was at fault. While with Chen they are kind of much more firm about it? At least that's the impression that I've been getting.\n\nI honestly think that the damage was way more severe for Sungmin than it was for Chen. I also kind of feel like attitude towards idol is kind of rapidly changing both in companies and within the fandom. I think Gen 1 and 2 catered way more towards the 'boyfriend' experience and really played it up. I think Gen 3 and 4 have really toned that down (some groups more than others but I feel like just in general the attitude is different now). Previously idols would sign 10 year contracts with dating bans and be expected to wait with settling down until after contracts expire. For new groups the contracts seem more reasonable, usually 7 years or so, and dating is usually not forbidden for the entire length of the contract. Also I think if a group (mainly boygroup) makes it to the 7 year mark, I think it's more common for them to resign again. So it can't just be expected that they 'wait out' their contract. Since they may be expected to stay in their group for longer than previous generations.\n\nI don't think the stigma around dating is going away anytime soon but I do feel like even in the last decade or so it has gone down significantly. Which is why I felt like, although of course it's unpleasant for Chen, his marriage will actually be a good thing for Kpop in general. I really hope he keeps promoting for a long time with exo and that both SM and his members will continue to show of those shiny spines and remain on Chen's side in this.",

He was pretty busy in 2019 with touring and his 2 solos though, and he's always had much less of an online presence than the other members, so I'm hoping that he's just been staying low-key while busy preparing for the baby rather than hiding out of nerves or pressure from SM. \n\nThe other members are all pretty active and have mostly been preparing for solo or unit activities so far this year. Suho just had his solo and is likely to enlist soon. Baekhyun's having a solo comeback soon, Kai's heavily rumored to have a solo at some point this year, Chanyeol and Sehun have been teasing EXO-SC activities, and SuperM is scheduled to come back too, so KaiBaek will also be busy with that. Lots of random solo activities here and there as well with OSTs, brand partnerships, collabs, photoshoots etc.",

Their styling was amazing and fits them super well (but what doesn't fit them at this point really..) Relay dances are one of the best to see the individual styles of the members and I love all of them, they are such characters.\n\nI'm so happy they added some of the extra takes, because Enha behind the scenes is mostly just cuteness and giggles. The mistakes, Sunoo struggling to stop laughing at the others and Jungwon apologising for having to do it again was adorable.",

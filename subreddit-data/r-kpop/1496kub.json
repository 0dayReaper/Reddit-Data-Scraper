Like, for real, for real.  I understand that they really love ILY:1 and every single little thing that they do and all of that but, uhhhh, just.......STILL!!!!!!!!!!  This really isn't the way to go at all, my dude.  Just give them all the privacy and space they really need right now and continue on supporting ILY:1 and every single thing that they do IN A HEALTHY WAY, OF COURSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Hyuna, Dawn, and Jessi all said that although they love and respect Psy, they felt asphyxiated because Psy is a micromanager and he gets too involved in the projects. Girlie has won the right to make her music the way she wants. \n\n2. It\u2019s most likely Penomeco. If you look closely, one of the coke bottles says Penocola",

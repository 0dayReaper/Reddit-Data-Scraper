In comparison jihoon got a lot of opportunities like music show mc, variety show appearances, etc. \n\nHope members like doyoung or asahi can get their moment, also jeongwoo NEEDS to showcase his vocals, its a crime that he still hasnt been singing much after debut.  \n\n\ni think the T5 lineup will be similar to what yg had in mind in ygtb, so haruto will def be in it :)",

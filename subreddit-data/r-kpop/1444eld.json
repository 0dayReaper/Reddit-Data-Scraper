Keeho's silky smooth voice was blessing my ears and my heart, the high note and adlibs in 'Love me for me'? man.\n\nI literally got goosebumps listening to 'I Am You', what a song. Definitely one of my all time favorites.\n\nJongseob and Intak absolutely killed it in this comeback. K-hip hop releases have been kinda disappointing lately but i knew p1harmony were going to save it for me, they never disappoint. They stick to what they excel at and i'm so glad they do that.",

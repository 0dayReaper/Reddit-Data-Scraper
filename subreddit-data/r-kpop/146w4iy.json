As a Teume I was rlly anxious watching this like I almost thought they were gonna disband or something lol but the fact that the founder himself is in this video saying TREASURE will be rebooted makes me have high hopes for them, I hope this the start of Treasure world domination :)))\n\nT5 prediction: the only person I\u2019m confident abt that raised their hand is Junkyu lmfaoo other than that Idk. If that\u2019s actually how he chose the unit tho that\u2019s kinda wack like wtf. I hope my bias Jihoon is it but Idk",

They are being forced to innovate by all the small labels banding together and having come-ups and the wheels came off immediately. \n\nImo their best chance is new fresh ideas and personnel.

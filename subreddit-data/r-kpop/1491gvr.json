They deserve to be the greatest K-Pop group of all time. Cheers to 10 years of Bangtan Sonyeondan! \ud83e\udd73",

It feels like watching one of the all-time great athletes or something, there's just this magic buzz that everyone can feel where you know it's something special that doesn't come around every day. I was watching the War of Hormone MV the other day and really felt like there is this intangible \"little bit extra\" with them that's hard to put a finger on but you can just feel that you're seeing next level excellence. Congrats to these boys from a gg stan.",

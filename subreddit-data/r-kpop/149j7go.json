Take notes Korean entertainment companies. \n\nTHIS IS HOW YOU COME UP WITH A FANDOM NAME. \n\n1) It makes immediate sense\n2) I immediately know the fandom is for\n3) (it doesn't have to be but) it's a cute, well done pun\n4) no one is going to be embarrassed to call themselves an Aborable.\n5) also, there's a lot of creative/graphic design then can do like aBORAble.",

I really hope this is all building, her branding herself and being active on social media, to her opening a personal YouTube channel. I find Bora's personality to be extremely enjoyable, with her being a smiley positivity-vitamin, and I'd love for her to start a channel and get the opportunity to learn more about her. She seems fun, goofy, and nice but because SISTAR was long before my time as a Kpop fan, I only know about her from her little stints on some variety shows I've watched. Nothing major.\n\nWe've got some bubbly and positive personality having idols with YouTube channels already, like Chuu and the like, but getting one from a 33 year old would be especially nice. A grown woman and the maturity and \"I'm beyond the whole 'idol' thing/rules, I'm in my 30's\" would be really fun. Idk if she'd be that way but if she was I'd really, really enjoy it.",

To them it\u2019s just jokes or teasing, or just not getting along, but never bullying. \n\nI was bullied a lot at school and high school and I\u2019m pretty sure 90% of my classmates would tell you that they never bullied anyone. Meanwhile I had depression, had a suicide attempt, and even now 15 years later I still have social anxiety. \n\nI believe 100% that Soojin wasn\u2019t lying, she just didn\u2019t see it for what it was. Hopefully her victims are doing better and now can get some sort of closure at least that she realizes what she\u2019s done to them",

Hyunjin is also someone who has been really open about having a troubled past and how hard he had worked to put it behind him. The apology he gave, instead of making people think \"YES HE'S BULLY FIRE HIIIIIIIM!\" instead worked out to be \"you know what, he has a past, he's been truthful about it from the get-go, he's worked hard to put it behind him and change, and this statement proves that he genuinely has.\" Some Stays still think he's 100% innocent, but honestly it's whatever at this point. It helps that, like you said, Stray Kids is very fandom-driven and the fans had already chosen to stick by him.\n\nSoojin, on the other hand...\n\nI'm a Neverland, I'll admit, and right now, I kind of feel bad that I defended her so early on when this had just started. When it did start, I was, of course, taken aback, in disbelief, and defended her along with everyone else, because I felt it couldn't be possible.\n\nLooking back though... she really shot herself in the foot.\n\nLike, I don't think most Nevies truly understand how bad this was, because even though Twitter Nevies had a reputable translator in happyshuhua, a lot of it was taken out of context by other Nevies and broken up so we only saw the stuff that was in Soojin's favour. But it was BAD. The accusations included physical violence, theft, among other stuff. And it wasn't just one accuser; there were at least seven, if not more, with multiple witnesses. There were two or three people who defended her, but they were only a few people against multiple others with proof. We only talk about the one because that was the one with all the back and forth.\n\nSoojin's and Cube's strategy, it seems, was deny deny deny. However, she admitted parts were true, and I think this is where she lost. Yes, she seemed confident and sure of what was true and what wasn't, but she also claimed she didn't remember, tried to make it look like the accusations were just malicious lies, and according to Korean speakers, worded it in a way that seemed cocky, arrogant, and almost backhanded, like in a Gretchen Wieners style \"I'm sorry you were offended by me, but I can't help that I'm so popular.\" Plus, she bet her career on whether they were true or not. But the accusations just continued, plus Seo Shinae, who up until that point was quite vague, came out and said Soojin indeed bullied her.\n\nAnd to all Nevies, no, Shinae isn't some nugu jealous girl who is washed up in the industry, she is a respected child actress whose shows and dramas at one point were pulling better numbers than RUNNING MAN. Maybe you don't know her by name, but bring up one of her shows and people recognize her instantly. She isn't trying and failing to get roles, she's taking a break to go to college, which looks good because it basically shows that she is a good kid who takes her schooling seriously. And she's also a longtime anti-bullying advocate on top of that.\n\nSo, long story short, Soojin is now seen as having taken severe accusations and basically made a joke out of the victims, and if any of the accusations are true, her response would only tell people that she is a liar, a narcissist, and that she never changed for the better.\n\nI wish I could say I was surprised, but with the severity of the accusations, and how poorly they were handled, there was really no other way. Innocent or not, she needed to be fully acquitted of everything to have any hope of the public liking or just so much as accepting her again.",

Of course many were proven false along the way, many we shall have no clue of, and many were proven true. Particularly the worst accusations. There is no way of examining all the details in the past. But from the word of these victims, Koreans, and even myself I can guarantee you that the kinda of things accused happens in real life, in Korea. When I went to school there for the summer a while ago, even for a few amount of days, I was so appalled. There was rough bullying and aggressiveness, stealing expensive items, etc. Since it was long ago my mind is so hazy but I remember calling my mom to pick me up early every day, I only was treated decent because I was Korean-American and got along with some of the more outcasted students and Filipino students who could speak English. \n\nAnyway, what I saw there was nothing that compares to what happens in some schools. Iljins are basically teenage gangsters, and frequent in many schools, especially back a few years ago from what I remember. That\u2019s why many dramas and webtoons focus on school bullying. It is very competitive and many students have the \u201cmust be no.1\u201d mentality and like to pick on others.\n\nIdols are human too, and they make the same choices as regular beings. A lot of them are angels and genuinely nice people, but a lot of them could\u2019ve been mean spirited people in the past. A lot of these idols were the \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201crich\u201d people in the past. You really don\u2019t know how they are in the real world.",

(And cube and soojin did the literal opposite smh)\n\nNot sure about lia though. We still dont know the severity of the accusations, and if they are even true in the first place. But its starting to be worrisome that jype cant still find closure to it until now, and reinvestigation was done for the 2nd time as the accuser was cleared by the police from being sued something like that. Now, i think its back to fact-checking again.\n\nAbout april, that group was dead on the ditch already even weeks ago. There is no saving them from that shit of a mess they got themselves into, thats for sure smh.",

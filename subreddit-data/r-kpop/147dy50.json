There's a chance the viewable shows will also be live-streamed on YouTube, but it's rare. They'll definitely be available on the app though.  \n\n---  \n\nThe good news: Wendy's back! (audience: Hooray! \ud83e\udd73)  \nThe bad news: She's stepping down as DJ, her last day is July 2nd (audience: Awwww \ud83d\ude22)  \n\nYeah it's bittersweet. I know how much she loved this DJ gig, so it sucks to see her go. On the flip side this decision appears to have been made in response to her ramping up her music activities, with a 2nd solo album all but confirmed to be on the way. (sort of) Fun fact: 'Like Water' came out before she became Youngstreet's DJ. I know she held down the job during RV comebacks, but perhaps the demands of a solo comeback are just too much to balance. Either way, what's done is done. Let's all enjoy these last few weeks with WanD as much as we can!",

On instagram alone, SBS  Youngstreet followers was at around 40,000 at the start of Wendy's stint, now it's at 112k. I hope the Youngstreet staff pull-out all the stops and give Wendy a proper send-off. They should make her remaining shows special and thank her for her hard work.  Wendy deserves nothing less.",

Bangkok RtoV was cancelled as she contracted COVID again, exhaustion definitely played a part. \n\nnot to mention over the past year she also had a lot of songs (Airport Goodbye, the ost with Code Kunst, Beautiful Christmas, GTB) so I'm sure she'll do well for her solo album preparation , but my guess is that she'll have to be away from Korea even more from now on. \n\ndefinitely bittersweet but hopefully she's happy and healthy moving forward!",

Considering YG will still have GD, Taeyang and  Daesung from one of the most popular groups to ever exist in SK, I doubt he's in any serious trouble. That, and the immense success of BLACKPINK (especially recently) is going to attract investors and generate positive publicity. They're objectively the most popular and successful GG, and he also has other very popular groups such as WINNER and iKON. Unless all his investors left (extremely doubtful) YGE will continue to be part of the Big 3. I would like to see YG himself properly punished for his poor behaviour and crimes though, I find the man disgusting and misogynistic af.",

What metric are you using there?\n\nSure Blackpink are definitely more popular in the west in terms of youtube views, but that's pretty far down the list of things they actually make money off of, and western fans are notoriously hard to monetize compared to korean/japanese fans.\n\nIn the last few years, JYP has gone from third largest company behind SM and YG, to taking the #1, and nearly doubling the value of YG who have been pushed into third place. Pretty much entirely due to the dominance of Twice.\n\nUnless something has changed very recently, twice are still on top in charts/physical sales/live shows/general recognition in korea and japan, which is where the real money is in stadium tours, cf's and sponsor events. Unless blackpink either properly break into the kr/jp market, or start getting huge brand deals in the west, I wouldn't put them above twice.",

But TWICE are undoubtedly physical monsters, especially for a GG as GGs typically sell better digitally and BGs sell better physically. I know TWICE are definitely more popular in Japan than BP (probably helps to have 3 immensely popular Japanese members, with Sana regularly going viral) but BP seems to be more popular in China and definitely more so in SEA. And clearly BP has far more popularity in the West, but I would argue that despite BP having a very solid SK fanbase, TWICE are definitely the current gg darlings of South Korea. The multiple YG scandals definitely impacted BP's popularity for sure, I know many people are (rightfully) boycotting YGE. \n\nI think it's really dependent on how you personally measure \"bigger\" y'know? I stan both groups, and I think they're both monstrously successful but in kinda different ways, in different markets. I don't think TWICE have much appeal for the western market, we're collectively not too keen on the cute theme over here. But in Japan and SK that theme is pretty much a safe bet. If we're talking global popularity then I would without a doubt have to say BP, especially after Coachella, and I think that popularity will continue to grow. I definitely don't see TWICE's popularity declining in Japan and SK anytime soon either.\n\nEdit: oops sorry missed the CF part. Regarding that, I think BP have the edge there considering they have deals with giants such as Samsung and Chanel. For their Cosmopolitan shoot alone they received around $1.4M. Probably helps that they're also permitted to have solo CFs. I don't doubt Lisa alone will bring in a ridiculous amount of CF money, considering her insane popularity in SEA and the western market.",

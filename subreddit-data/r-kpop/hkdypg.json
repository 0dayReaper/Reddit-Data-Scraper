Seolhyun may have been oblivious to what was happening, or like you said, thought it was just Jimin being Jimin, and excused her behavior since she \"knows\" her. It is also highly likely Jimin treated Mina badly when people weren't looking. There are tons of people out there that know how to play the system. You can say cruel things without anyone hearing it but the victim. You can roll your eyes, sigh, make noises, little comments and it doesn't seem \"that bad\" but the victim feels and hears everything. It's also possible the bystanders/other members were afraid of Jimin, afraid they would be the next target. Not saying that's right, but FNC didn't do shit for any of them. It's obvious they knew they were all in a helpless position whether they spoke out or stayed silent.",

I won't link it but if you want to go to her Instagram page, do so at your own discretion. And if you do go on on her Instagram page, I urge you to please, please post some nice and positive comments for her.)\n\nTo call it a fiction story? It\u2019s a very scary fiction story then. Unnie, after getting treated for my scars 3-4 times it looks like they\u2019re going away but the memories I have of unnie will never go away. Every single day I feel like I might go crazy Jimin unnie. A law? A lawsuit? I don\u2019t have any money so I can\u2019t do that. Compensation for psychological injury? I don\u2019t need any of that and I never intended on doing any of that. I\u2019m just broken because of unnie and I\u2019m so so sad and I\u2019m hurt. What I want is for you to acknowledge your wrongdoings in front of me and to honestly apologize to me. Then I think I\u2019ll be fine. The unnie that harassed me is doing so well right now.. Opening my eyes every day is painful but you know, I have to feed my family, right? So just admit it and apologize to me. Let me get rid of these unpleasant feelings too, okay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslation of Mina's third Instagram post:\n\nI talked about 1 story out of 1000000000000s. Just try and call it fiction, unnie, you\u2019re going to get punished for it. So don\u2019t do it, I have proof. I\u2019m sorry to say, but there\u2019s no need to listen to both sides. I did nothing wrong. That last day, I went to go treat my hairline and the effects of my anesthesia didn\u2019t wear off so I was going to be late to our dance practice so I called in advance but the moment I heard your voice I thought you were going to flip out so I couldn\u2019t even go to our dance practice room. Also, I attempted to take my life that day. That\u2019s my biggest fault. Now I told you what I did wrong, so should I reveal your story or not? There\u2019s so much that I can\u2019t write it. You wouldn't call my story fiction if unnie had a conscience\u2026 Why\u2019d you delete it, unnie? Just call it fiction. There will probably be a lot of people who'd be shocked if you called it that. Ah but now that I think about it, you don\u2019t really remember and you\u2019re not the type of bitch to say something like that. That\u2019s what you would say, right? Wow, you must be so lucky to forget memories so well. I heard that people who insult others don\u2019t remember doing it. Please erase that memory from my head too, unnie, please please. Actually, you probably wouldn\u2019t even feel any guilt after looking at my wrists. You must want to curse in front of my face, probably\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAOA Jimin posted on her Instagram story with the word \"\uc18c\uc124\" (Fiction/Novel/Story) and deleted it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslation of Mina's second Instagram post:\n\nOh but I wrote about that unnie in AOA because when my father was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer I knew he was going to pass away but I was scared I was going to get yelled at by the unnie again, and also that was when I was acting and when we had our comeback, so I had to get through our schedule and I didn\u2019t want to put any burden on my members and I memorized my lines and there were a lot of moments when I had to smile so I forced myself not to think about my father and instead of focus on my work, and I just couldn\u2019t go into the hospital room to see my father. In the late stages of pancreatic cancer my father looked gaunt and he was all bones so I couldn\u2019t hold back my tears. My sister called me to tell me that my father couldn\u2019t even speak and that he was looking for me, but I was worried about how I might cry during a schedule and worried about what that unnie would say to me. At the time, I was young, so I thought that was the only way and I thought what I was doing was right. I was more afraid of getting yelled at so even though I had more chances to see him I didn\u2019t and I saw my father leave when he closed his eyes and the lines went flat. My father wrote \u201cwhere\u2019s my daughter\u201d in messy handwriting on a sketchpad that was next to him and he showed it to the nurse, but at that moment I was still working so I couldn\u2019t go and see him. But from what I heard, unnie got special treatment and just canceled her own schedules but I hope that\u2019s not true. Be like a professional, unnie. Don\u2019t cry, okay? It will ruin the mood. You told me that I was bringing the mood down and that I was the reason people were so on edge and cautious. Overcome it well, unnie, please. I still can\u2019t erase that memory from my head, and even if the memory is a bit fuzzy, I still remember everything that happened. Every time I remember it, I take my medications and endure it. I think the thing that happened while my father was in the hospital will stay with me forever. To unnie that must\u2019ve just been an insult you spat out with no afterthought, but I think that left a big scar on me. But when we had 5 more minutes together before I left, I told you that what you said really pained me. But unnie glared at me and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the type of bitch to say something like that?\u201d Then another member stepped up bravely and said that unnie actually did say those things to me. I felt so dejected and deep inside I was wondering if you were actually human? But then we said goodbye to each other. I'm honestly not that smart so my memory isn\u2019t the best, but unnie\u2019s actions were endless. There were so many memories. (This sentence to \"but that's okay right?\" didn't really make sense but I tried to translate to the best of my ability) But I\u2019ll just say this one thing. What are you going to do when you cancel your contract and they ask for a cancellation fee. I didn\u2019t get to say everything yet that\u2019s okay right? Thanks to you, I take numerous pills every day and my left wrist burns because I cut it so many times. But seeing my mother, I have to keep living and earning money. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m getting treatment for my scars even though I still have nightmares, but you know what\u2019s funny, before I left, we all went out for drinks without you and talked every day but we all still don\u2019t know. Why do you hate me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslation of Mina's Instagram post:\n\nI just really really want to disappear (t/n: probably the mildest way to put it) but I have to take care of my mother.. ah I\u2019m going to get a lot of texts saying I\u2019m brainless again you\u2019re right I\u2019m brainless and I didn\u2019t learn anything correctly. I had to go out and make money because of my family\u2019s situation. Around when my father passed away I cried once in the waiting room and this one unnie told me that the vibe of the room was depressing because of me and she told me to stop crying. When she started dragging me towards a closet in the waiting room, I told I was just so scared because my father was going to pass away soon. I still can't believe what she told me.\n\nIt\u2019s like harassment? Or like an insult? But it\u2019s okay it\u2019s just a scar but since we ride in the same car I started taking sleeping pills and forced myself to sleep. I had to do our schedules/promotions properly but I could feel myself slowly breaking down.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m fine if I don\u2019t get acknowledged as an idol or actor. I\u2019m really bad at those things. I\u2019m lacking a lot. But when I was actively promoting, I was so happy and I did my best. I really loved my job and I never got stress once and I honestly didn\u2019t want to leave AOA but after being bullied by a certain someone for ten years, to the point where I really wanted to go crazy and insult you.. I eventually quit AOA.\n\nI was someone who really enjoyed promoting with the other members, but recently that unnie\u2019s father passed away. I was so sad and it felt so weird since I understand how it feels.. When I went to the funeral hall, she started crying right when she saw me and she started apologizing to me. It felt so empty and my mind just crumbled down.. Everything is empty and my resentment went away and everything was fine but I was already too broken\n\nSince I was scared, my hiatus\u2026 of course I expected it. I thought I could learn a lot and get treated for depression or panic attacks. But even during my hiatus a lot of things happened.. I\u2019m honestly so exhausted. Those Netizens, right? Just like what those internet comments are saying, I don\u2019t know who I am anymore and I don\u2019t know what kind of person I am. I hate seeing it and it\u2019s so loud/annoying. Even if you don\u2019t want to hear it, I wasn\u2019t born because I wanted to be born, but I have a mouth and I have hands and now I can\u2019t even control myself. I have to stay alive for my mother.. You don\u2019t have like me or give me attention so can\u2019t you just like\u2026 leave me alone? Because it\u2019s all my fault.",

I told FNC everything. I was half out of my mind, I couldn\u2019t even open my eyes properly, I couldn\u2019t speak coherently, and I was in a condition where I hadn\u2019t fully recovered from taking hundreds of sleeping pills. I told them that it was because of Jimin unnie but they didn\u2019t listen to me. Who do I have to talk to? I shouldn\u2019t get mad? I\u2019m like this all the time.. I lived like this, you just didn\u2019t know because I never talked about it. Since I was 21, I hid my medications and secretly took them and endured life that way. I lived like this. Because of Shin Jimin unnie. It was because of that one unnie who is sleeping well right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslation of Mina's sixth Instagram post:\n\nApparently you\u2019re sleeping after taking your medication. Must be nice. Right now I\u2019m dunking my head in the sink and holding back my tears. I can\u2019t sleep even after taking numerous sleeping pills, isn\u2019t that interesting? I\u2019m going to try to sleep by staying up for a few days. The floor of my house is covered in blood because I slit my wrists so much. I just feel dazed. While I\u2019m dazed I think about when I\u2019m going to die and how many people will rush over to save me. Why are there so many people who are suffering because of me? Unnie, are you sleeping well? The second I heard that you were sleeping, I got angry again and I cried and I was filled with more rage. I\u2019m so strange. Try living a life where you have to dunk your head in the sink every day. It\u2019s really pathetic. Unnie is actually a really bad person. You have to realize that yourself. I want to sleep. I want to get a good night\u2019s sleep just once. Why does everyone have to suffer because of unnie, why am I made out to be the bad person, huh? I want to stop upsetting people. I get angry and I get sad and you\u2019re making me go insane. Don\u2019t sleep. Apologize. Get a hold of yourself, unnie. Stop breaking me. Wow, I\u2019m so mad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslation of Mina's fifth Instagram post:\n\nIt must be difficult to come to me and apologize. Every time we got a new manager you told them that I was a really scary bitch who played dumb. Why did you call me a scary bitch who plays dumb? You said I looked arrogant whenever I did auditions. Whenever I dieted because I wanted to look good, you asked me, \u201cMina, what\u2019s wrong with your body? I fucking hate it. Gain some weight.\u201d When we were trainees you used to hit me because I was at the front. We had to be formal and say \u201cDid you sleep well? Yes, Sorry. Thank you\u201d to you. You always did everything you wanted to. You brought anybody you wanted to to our dorm and I slept in the practice room because it was so noisy. You used to be like \u201cHey didn\u2019t so and so member change?\u201d And went around insulting the members. You said a lot of things that I can\u2019t even repeat. Oh yeah, you probably don\u2019t remember how you yelled at me for not greeting you first at the salon. Also this is just the tip of the iceberg. In these ten years, you did far worse things. But thanks to unnie, I don\u2019t have anything to lose and I\u2019m not really afraid of anything? Because a large part of my fears was unnie. To me, you were the embodiment of stress. You can\u2019t tell just from my previous posts, right? It became a norm so and I\u2019ve forgotten it all and all that\u2019s left is mental illness and a number of harsh words. In my will/suicide note I always included your name, just because I thought maybe you would feel guilty when you read it. I collapsed from stress-induced seizures and I collapsed after attempting to commit suicide. My mother would cry and my sister has cancer but they had to visit the emergency room constantly because of me. I have never talked back to you once in my lifetime. Is there anything I did wrong from when we were trainees to when we debuted and to when we began promoting? If I did do something wrong, tell me. Did you dislike me because I\u2019m not good at flattery? But even then, I tried my best. Even when I was scolded or wasn\u2019t scolded, I would put aside my own pride and keep approaching you. It was amazing to hear you say that you were taking medication for your mental health and that you were having a hard. You said everything you want to say and did everything you wanted to do. You were completely selfish. I was so jealous of you could talk about your mental health so openly like that while everyone else probably also had their own issues? I need to suppress this I\u2019m not in the right mental state right now but unnie is the reason why I\u2019m like this and unnie is the reason why my family\u2019s having a hard time right now. I actually used to be strong mentally. When I was a trainee, I didn\u2019t think much about it because I thought it was what leaders did. But after all these years, you\u2019re still the same. I couldn\u2019t go out and talk about how I was having such a hard time because of you. In the last moments of our contract renewal, I exploded and my family found out. But did my family even do anything to you once they heard about it? Their daughter, you know, tried to commit suicide because of a certain someone but they didn\u2019t even get angry at you. When unnie wanted to cry you could cry and you were consoled. I thought you would scold me so for these past ten years\u2026 how exactly did I spend it? In the end, I took close to 200 sleeping pills because of you. I can\u2019t really remember since I collapsed. I wrote unnie\u2019s name on an A4 paper and I apologized to my mother, and that\u2019s how I still spend my days. Even when I was being broken down, I was already broken. My mother actually suffered from depression because of me, did you know? I don\u2019t want to live solely because of one person, unnie. Really, it\u2019s because of you. Even if you came to me and sincerely apologized, I\u2019m already broken, so I\u2019ll suddenly collapse and then cry and then grab a knife and then write \u201cShin Jimin\u201d on a piece of paper. I\u2019m broken and my pent up anger makes my chest ache and it\u2019s driving me crazy. I feel so sorry for my mother and father and sister. Can\u2019t you just tell me why you hated me? You were too harsh on me to say that you didn\u2019t hate me. I\u2019m sad. I wonder if this is chaos, but I\u2019m so so sad. I feel depressed whenever I open my eyes. I think I might go crazy. Whenever you turned around while sitting in the front of the car my heart always started racing because I thought you were going to say something to me. Unnie, I want an apology. What will that change? I don\u2019t even know. I just want something. My rage is going to explode. I mean, Shin Jimin, there was no reason for you to mistreat me like this, right? I wish you could feel what I experience just for a day. I wish I could go back in time and just change bodies with you for once. You lived life so comfortably. Let\u2019s hear it, what did you hate about me? Huh? I really hate you too. If it weren\u2019t for you how would I have been? Perhaps I wouldn\u2019t be crying every day and having nightmares and attempting to commit suicide? Because I did nothing, I just want to go around and talk about you and tell others that I have a mental illness because of you. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this right now. Isn\u2019t it pathetic? After holding this in, I have exploded. I can\u2019t manage myself and I can\u2019t hide this anymore.",

In one of the instagram post Mina wrote that when her dad was dying, he was so weak that he couldn't even talk and had to write on a sketchbook to ask the nurse where his daughter was. To have known that and still gotten shit from Jimin at such a young age? This shit has me worried. I knew something wasn't quite right with Mina even when she WAS in AOA but now it makes more sense. It hasn't even been a year since Sulli and Hara, this shit can't affect another person.",

The fact that thou who shall not be named, was so heartless and nasty to her even when Mina\u2019s father died says a LOT about her character. And that she made Mina so scared, she missed out on her father\u2019s final moments. That is guilt Mina will carry for the rest of her life. Nothing can scrub that away, she will always live w that. Sure, Mina is an adult and could have gone but that fear of being scolded, having anxiety over it is debilitating. It\u2019s disgusting thou who shall not be named treated her that way and then went on to call it fiction and couldn\u2019t even stand on that. She\u2019s the weak one and that\u2019s all i\u2019m saying about her. \n\nI hope someone is there for Mina and that she stays strong. I hope she knows that her father is with her always and to forgive herself for not being there. I pray for Mina :(",

They love to nitpicking others without any self reflection toward themselves. They can appear friendly, fun,witty,good person for others but it\u2019s a nightmare to the victim. Their reason for bullying never make sense. They just pick a person they think they can do that and if the victim can\u2019t stand up for themselves for whatever reason, this treatment will goes on without the bully ever get the consequence.\n\nThe process of bullying can take times without the victim realise themselves has change emotionally because of it. The victim feel anger,shame,scare and all others emotional distress that sometimes the only solution it\u2019s self harm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had encountered several bully in my long life, and I understand the feeling very well. It\u2019s sucked.\n\n  \nI\u2019m lucky that I stand up and fight back as soon I feel how distressed  I was. But I knew people that still endure it and can\u2019t stand up for themselves, for whatever reason. The only thing we can do it\u2019s being their support and give them positive encouragement, and if we saw what happen, we should be brave enough to speak out for them.\n\nI really hope the truth will reveal itself and the others can start to speak out to do the right thing, because being silent when something wrong it\u2019s happened, it\u2019s never right.",

Mina's had it so rough. More than we knew.\n\nIt's so sad that she loved being in AOA, but Jimin's alleged long-term bullying essentially forced her to leave since she just couldn't take the abuse anymore.\n\nThis isn't a good look for Jimin, especially as the leader of AOA, the group (for allegedly just passively standing on the sides), or FNC (who allegedly did not intervene) - especially since Mina said that this bullying went on for a *decade.*\n\nI really hope Mina's close family and friends are with her right now, and help Mina get the help she needs - because it seems like she's really struggling right now, more than ever before.\n\n**EDIT:** Also, fuck all these netizens who continue to daily send harassment to Mina.

Many groups have genuine bonds, even AOA, but I wouldn't be surprised if many groups or companies that struggle at one time or another deal with situations like this. Given how easy it is to tank a career, speaking out can end a career before it begins (and blacklists are severe). \n\nSome group member relationships don't go further than being colleagues. If this situation is true, then the perpetrator should have been let go from her job, just the same as what would happen to someone who treated a coworker like this at a normal job. Unfortunately it didn't work out like that. Mental health issues in Korea were more taboo in the past, too, which I'm sure contributed to her relative silence until now. \n\nI really hope a friend or family member can get to Mina in person. It takes bravery to come forward like this. Even if her account is accurate, she is throwing away her career to get some peace of mind or justice. Hopefully she finds some.",

And I say this as a huge Ladies' Code fan who didn't know they even existed until years after the accident. Supported them as much as I could, love their music both new and old, thought they were amazing for continuing to pursue their dreams in the face of tragedy, and tried to not let the tragedy define them as people or as artists... Even for me, a big fan, that shadow is still there.\n\nIf AOA ever comes back, even without Jimin, this is gonna loom large. I'll still be able to listen to their old stuff, still be able to enjoy even Jimin's rapping, because that's just who I am (I can enjoy someone's work without liking the person at all), but even their old stuff is going to have a bit of a shadow over it now for me.",

Her dad got to the point where he couldn\u2019t speak well anymore, but still wanted to see her, and so he had even written in a sketchbook saying, \u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter?\u201d to ask the nurse, and the nurse had to tell him that she was working.\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking to read, and I\u2019m angry and saddened at the mindset she was put in as a result of the bullying",

I really hope the facts are cleared up soon and Mina gets the strength to heal. \n\nAOA used to be one of my favourite groups but such a toxic, unhealthy environment is inexcusable.",

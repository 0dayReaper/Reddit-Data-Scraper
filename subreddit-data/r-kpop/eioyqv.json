At that time, SJ Label, Kim Heechul\u2019s agency, told The HeraldPOP that the two are only in a close senior-junior relationship, and that they tell them that they are in fact groundless, and JYP Entertainment also said the same. The two, however, have revealed that are in a couple. \n\nKim Heechul made his debut as part of Super Junior in 2005, and has been active as a singer and entertainer. Momo debuted in 2015 with the group TWICE\n\n---\n\n[articles are saying that they have started seeing each other recently and developed feelings for each other recently which means the rumour in august probably really was not true](https://twitter.com/kimsanaunnie/status/1212506552311144450)\n\n---\n\n[Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/article/1374761wpp/breaking-super-juniors-kim-heechul-and-twices-momo-confirmed-to-be-dating)",

Its also worth mentioning how this could be a Jennie Kai situation all over again, where they have just recently met up and \"gotten together\" and the relationship isn't very serious. All I know is that Twice's knowing bros. visits are going to be a lot more interesting now lol",

And she did that alongside three group minis, a solo festival and group shows outside SK, more photoshoots than she's ever had in her first 7 years as an idol, numerous song collab and featuring, odd jobs here and there like interviewing Chris effin Evans, AND two brushes with C-19.\n\nNot trusting SM at all but I do hope whatever August contract renewal season turns out to be it would open more doors for her just like Youngstreet has.\n\nEdit: details",

She truly made it her own and I'm going go miss her photoshoots on the way. That said she looked to maybe over extending herself for a while now, and i have been a bit concerned for her health especially with her upcoming solo comeback. This will hopefully give her more time and energy to focus on that, and maybe hint that her solo could be as early as July at some point.",

            "comment": "I'm sure Wendy's decision to step down as DJ was not done lightly. Wendy really enjoyed being a DJ, meeting fellow artists,  and making new friends. It was a joy to us fans watching her interact with other artists and her On-The-Way to work routine. A lot of idols too (especially those from the 4th gen) looked forward to guesting on her show for a chance to meet the vocalist they admire the most.\n\nThe show's guestings has been a constant source frustration for some of us and the current production team has shown very little creativity but those are not Wendy's fault. Despite all that, Wendy really did a good job and brought awards and a lot of new listeners to the show  and  even had the most number of listeners on her time slot. Wendy's warm personality, friendly voice, ernest laughter, and the occasional live singing really made her an outstanding DJ.\n\nI'm glad Wendy got the opportunity to do something she loves for almost  2 years. The show did a lot for her self-confidence and popularity. Maybe in the future she will have the opportunity to be a DJ again but or now, let's wish her well on her upcoming comeback.",

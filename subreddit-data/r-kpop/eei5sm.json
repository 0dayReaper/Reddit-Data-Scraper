They've managed to put out a contender for song of the year at the end of the goddamn year",

Definitely one of my favorite RV titles off of the first few listens. Also, the styling is absolutely on point, mature elegant always slays. What a great comeback to end the year.",

I'll describe its basics in musical terms but i don't think i'll be able to give a really satisfactory explanation in layman's terms. \n\nPsycho is I - III - vi - IV. Its very similar to  [Creep by Radiohead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRNyygfk) which is I - III - IV - iv.\n\nthey share 3 of the four chords and each chord change follows the same \"direction\" so the shape of the overall progression is similar.\n\nIts interesting that Creep and Psycho both use similar musical conventions to tell a sort of similar story. it goes to show the sort of universal characteristics of music i guess.",

Like, even if they only have a few scenes together, I actually buy that they're a cohesive group that probably talk to one another outside of work and like each other. \n\nWith some group videos, it just feels like, yes, this is a group of attractive people dancing together in a room, but I cant confirm if they've actually seen each other before they showed up to film this video. But with RV it feels like they would help each other bury a body if necessary. It could just be down to the choreo and their confidence level, but idk.\n\nI'm not super into fandom, their projected personalities, etc cos I'm a certified Old\u2122, so I could be way off, but that's the vibe I get from them, and it's really refreshing.",

I have never been disappointed by Red Velvet music.\n\nI love this song and video so much. I haven't loved a Red Velvet video and single quite as much as Bad Boy until now, and I love *all of their singles and videos*.\n\nI don't even have words for how happy this video has made me. I've just been watching it on repeat. I listened to it at 0.75 speed and at 1.25 speed as well, just for the heck of it. It's still good!\n\nAll of them got amazing styling. My ultimate bias is Wendy, and I was absolutely blown away by her in this video, but I want to also draw attention to how fantastic Seulgi's short hair looks, especially in the dancing scenes. Also, Yeri's style with her hair down in this video is just breath-takingly beautiful.\n\nI cannot say enough positive things about this video.",

Holy crap, Wendy center in that pre-chorus choreo. \n\nTHE CHORUS IS SO GOOD, their voices. Jaysus, Seulgi doing that leg split move. She's fiercer than a Polar Bear that hasn't eaten for a week. \n\nYou know based on the ddemo and teaer I didn't think this song would be so uplifting, but it is. It's dark and ominous but the chorus has a kina sweet romantic feel to it too. Okay this climax is sending me, holy frick, I'm crying. That outro was utterly fantastic.\n\nOkay I'm not exactly speechless but if I keep typing I could go on forever. They waited the entire fricking year to drop that and this was more than worth it. This song is fantastic, just brilliant. It's pop perfection, with an exquisite combination of their fine vocals, a darker edge but also a glossy romantic sheen. \n\nThis is an MV that I'll have to watch again and again too, it looks so good, there's so much going on.\n\nI give this ten shots of Nyquil out of ten haunted sowing machines.",

It has everything - the visuals (PARK SOOYOUNG - that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all I can say), the Velvet theme in the styling and aesthetic, the high notes, the slightly melancholic/eerie feel, this is a masterpiece. \n\n(Did we even expect anything less?

It sounds so addictive because it's only one note and yet it sounds REALLY distinct/slightly out of place, because it is! It's the same strategy RV uses a lot to make slightly out-of-place parts sound so addictive. EDIT: It's also kinda ingenious they put it on the last syllable in the phrase before the adlibs because that makes it stick out even more, it sounds weird because it doesn't end where it's supposed to (which is on a B\u266d4)\n\nAnother great example of this is the chorus in Ice Cream Cake, which modulates from A major to B major and yet uses __parallel B minor__ triads/chords to make [the chorus](https://youtu.be/glXgSSOKlls?t=42) sound so catchy. When it goes back to B major, it's the \"it's so tasty\" hook and your mind is just like \"WAIT BUT THE FIRST LINE OF THE CHORUS WAS SO CATCHY!!!\" because it doesn't end where it's supposed UNTIL the very last note of the phrase, so sort of the reverse of the magic that makes Seulgi's line at 1:36 in Psycho so addicting/memorable!",

            "comment": "Some things I have noticed in this music video is that:\n\n1. At the first part, when yeri was jumping up and down (signifying she was already losing her mind) and joy then proceeded to close the door, KEEPING HER SHUT inside the room, meaning she\u2019s letting her become just psycho. \n\n2. Then, Wendy was at the stairs (probably broken) then joy brought her way from that to a place filled with flowers and on a train so she could continue being depressed ALONE. \n\n3. The scene when the red string (which is the telephone\u2019s cord) is cut was cut by joy because it was shown that she was the one who went out of the room later on after the cord was cut. \n\n4. Joy was also driving the car BACKWARDS (meaning she was playing with time trying to consistently keeping the girls insane). \n\n5. Yeri smashed the mirror with a rock (with a hidden message) to escape from insanity but she couldn\u2019t because joy was controlling the time. \n\n6. This theory also goes to Irene trying to bring down the mirror and seulgi not looking at herself, as they are getting closer to sanity. But joy being the one controlling time, she kept rewinding time until they could stop and accept who they are. \n\n7. In the end scene, where they all play around; we were shown only seulgi, yeri, Wendy and Irene running around while joy was only at the back. Her face was not shown as much. It was also hinted that joy was NOT going psycho but is the mastermind behind all of these. Irene as the older one, claiming as the leader or the bigger sister for her and her sisters, finally accepting they all are \u201cpsycho\u201d. \n\n8. Also, the bridge lyrics was sung by joy \u201cdon\u2019t look back, just be who we are\u201d. Further hinting she was the one pulling the strings behind, keeping all the girls \u201cpsycho\u201d as she has said in the beginning. She said the girls would be psycho and Irene acknowledged they are pyschos. \n\n9. Side note, there were was a scene when joy was whispering something to seulgi but was interrupted, maybe it was Wendy who interrupted her because in the later scenes, she was whispering ecstatically but seulgi looks disinterested or in fraught as if she was distracted. It\u2019s probably Joy\u2019s brainwashing that she couldn\u2019t hear anything except joy\u2019s words. \n\nJoy is the mastermind around here. She\u2019s probably psycho herself but she is aware of it while others have less awareness when they\u2019re psycho. She doesn\u2019t want to be psycho alone, which is why she drags everybody down.",

This will definitely please the people looking for another Bad Boy. I don't see myself coming back to this song anytime soon, though. Once you've heard it once, you've heard everything.\n\nI think this is the first RV song let down by the production. There's just... nothing much of note happening. Interesting off-beat hi-hat patterns? We've heard enough of it this trap-obsessed year. Arpeggio-ish synth stuff happening in the verses? Some of their deep cuts offer even better of these. Loud, prominent quasi-brass in the chorus on top of some sub bass with a bit of crunch? Loads of songs have done this before, so this just doesn't feel fresh to me anymore (LOONA's Heat come to mind as a kpop example). I'm actually not a fan of how prominent it is. Try listening to the song twice in a row and ear fatigue is sure to set in. \n\nThe song's saving grace, I think, are the verses (thanks pizzicato strings) as well as the bridge (fender rhodes for days). LOVE the bridge. The verses and pre-chorus, due to the sub with the low pass, sounds very PC Music (A. G. Cook, Charli XCX, etc.) Caroline Polachek's Pang comes to mind. We need more of these sounds in kpop. \n\nRV has lost their individuality this comeback and I think that's okay. Not every song of theirs has to be \"out there\". If this came out earlier this year, I would've dug this more. However, as of right now, I'm just done with these production tropes, and am ready to move on to 2020 RV.\n\nTl;dr, not a bad song, just let down by basic production and timing.",

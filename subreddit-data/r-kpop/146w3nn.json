I'm going to reserve judgment on the song, if this is it, because the music is so quiet and idk if this is the chorus or what. \n\n\nI would day Tesco in Hungary is a random location, but I've recently been getting TT about KPOP idols and America core, so if there's appeal even in a Wells Fargo ATM...",

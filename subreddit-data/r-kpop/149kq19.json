The artist lineup is yet unknown.\n\nAs per linked article, \"Several K-pop artists including Epik High, Kang Daniel and CL are also set to visit Poland next month for the upcoming \u2018K-pop Stars Festival\u2019, which will be held in Warsaw from July 7 to 9. \"\n\nWith so many cities and countries holding kpop festivals these days, it's expected that several will not go as planned.\n\nIt will be interesting how Kpop Nation in PL pans out",

No one believes it might be real, since the whole thing looks like a scam, especially since they announced some big names. That's also why almost no one dares to buy a ticket. However, two weeks ago apparently a polish airport posted that the first stage of the festival would happen at the airport, which made the event seem more legit  and now everyone is even more confused. Ah  and because of covid rules in Poland, they can postpone the event indefinitely, maybe that will be their way...",

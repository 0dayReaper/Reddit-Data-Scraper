You can register a gun for hunting or sport purposes but that gun has to be stored at the local police station. You can't even keep a BB gun at your house in SK and there's heavy fines and jail time attached to anyone caught. It's like the strictest gun laws in the modern world.\n\nI'd almost be willing to bet you're right re: guns vs knives since gun crime damn near doesn't exist in SK. Don't need to be worried about kids or the mentally ill imitating stuff with guns if they can't ever get their hands on them but maybe knives are more of a problem over there for violent crime so they're censoring those for that reason.",

No one knows how big of a chunk it was, but if you watch the MV you can see a few scenes like the [parking garage](https://youtu.be/Z8j_XEn9b_8?t=48s), the [hallway/dresses](https://youtu.be/Z8j_XEn9b_8?t=187s) that only appear in this one random sequence (and one short [taeyeon moment](https://youtu.be/Z8j_XEn9b_8?t=67)) never to be seen again, and some [glam dresses](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/36700000/Kim-HyoYeon-of-SNSD-image-kim-hyoyeon-of-snsd-36773231-333-500.jpg) which never appeared at all, leading fans to speculate that there was originally more footage from these sections. \n\nThe release was delayed while SM threw together an MV from the remaining footage and a few rushed reshoots. The final result was a bit of a mess (no plot, grainy footage, and looked like a BTS for a photoshoot rather than an MV) and we\u2019re all still pretty salty about it tbh.",

Irene usually gets the least lines in RV pine distributions if not Yeri. \n\nAnd once again, RV saves 2020 for the second time. First with Psycho, and then Monster.\n\nTLDR; Hearing Irene sing 50% of a song is a surprise, but a pleasant one nonetheless. She's even better than I thought she is",

For once it's lesbians that are pandered to not straight people it happens once in a blue moon and it's a content from women by women and for women. But there always have to be poopjoy people pretending to be gay who apparently would have prefered another mv pandering to the straights.\n\nSome sad people or lost teenagers just wish to find everything problematic just to be able to feel important while they whine.\n\nA teaser implying lesbianism and a music video offering lesbianism is the opposit of queerbaiting it's a serve.

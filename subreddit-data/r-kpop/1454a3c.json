You get a hearing aid if it's not that bad and a cochlear implant if it is. If he's had it since October and he still isn't back, that's worrisome. From my (admittedly limited) understanding of cochlear implants, I think it would be very difficult to function as an idol with one.",

Its pretty difficult to decipher whats going on, so he\u2019d likely have to rely on lipreading, depending on how much hearing is lost",

Your brain essentially has to readjust to how you perceive sound. Trying to get back to living a normal life where you can perceive what's going on around you is enough of an ordeal as it is. Singing in tune and dancing in rhythm I think would be a hell of a journey.  \n\n\nHere's an interesting article on what it's like just to listen to music with a cochlear implant. A wildly different experience.  \n\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/05/18/406838781/deaf-jam-experiencing-music-through-a-cochlear-implant",

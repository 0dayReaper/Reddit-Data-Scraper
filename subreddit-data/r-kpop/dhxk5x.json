            "comment": "This is a great write-up. It doesn't focus on her death but instead highlights what she contributed to kpop and to the world. I'm so glad the author talked about her solo debut. And ending the article on 'On The Moon' is perfect.\n\nIf you can handle it, I would sincerely recommend listening to her mini album. I've actually been listening to it nonstop since this morning. The songs are introspective, experimental, and filled with a sort of melancholic hopefulness. I'd hope that people remember her for the artist that she was through her songs.\n\nEdit: links to the songs from her solo debut since this seems like it'll hit r/all:\n\n* [Goblin](https://youtu.be/P5uE7KDkDFE) | [lyrics](https://habitual-irony.tumblr.com/post/185932964222/sulli-%EA%B3%A0%EB%B8%94%EB%A6%B0-goblin-english-lyrics)\n* [On The Moon](https://youtu.be/7_Bav4c7UGM) | [lyrics](https://habitual-irony.tumblr.com/post/185959218912/sulli-on-the-moon-english-lyrics?is_related_post=1)\n* [Dorothy](https://youtu.be/kzUZABVj5UQ) | [lyrics](https://habitual-irony.tumblr.com/post/188351307797/sulli-dorothy-english-lyrics)\n\nA note about Goblin's music video. There's a fan theory that the 3 different personalities in the music video represent different aspects of Sulli herself. The first being her, dragged around by others and trying to hide. The second is her idol self, super cute, bright, and colorful. The third is the villain that the media and netizens made her out to be.",

She wasn\u2019t even as outspoken as people make her be, she was a very normal girl who was comfortable with her body and sexuality and didn\u2019t care for a bra or nudity. Also, she literally posted photos of her and her boyfriend like a normal person.\n\nYet these Korean \u201cnetizens\u201d are so fucking crazy that this SLIGHT deviation from the \u201cnormal\u201d apparently made her a \u201cstrange\u201d person and a \u201cslut\u201d and people would obsessively insult and abuse her in her Instagram all day long.\n\nAnd now she\u2019s fucking dead and nothing can be done about it.

The MeU fandom as a whole is small by comparison.\n\nSulli, especially, was marketed very much like IU was in the beginning of her career - I mean Sulli's nickname was \"giant baby\". She also had a ton of public notoriety - like people might not have known f(x), but they knew Sulli.\n\nSo when Sulli went on hiatus, and it then was revealed that she was dating Choiza (two unrelated events), that's when shit really hit the fan.\n\nFans of the other girls blamed Sulli for cutting Red Light promotions short (the group just promoted like 2 weeks before Sulli went on a sudden hiatus, their whole schedule got scrapped a few days later) while many in the GP turned on her because she shattered the illusion of her being \"innocent\" (i.e. Korea's daughter). This also paved the way for antis to post their hate under the guise of being \"concerned fans\".\n\nIt didn't help that she'd been having issues within the fandom for a while due to her insane sasaeng Jinnabit. So when Sulli, acted like any typical young adult, did things that were the anti-thesis of the \"K-pop image\", Jinnabit (who bitterly jumped to another idol to stalk) and people like netizenbuzz ran (what was essentially) a smear campaign on her for like 2 years.\n\nWhile Jinnabit and netizenbuzz eventually moved on, the damage was done, and Sulli was pretty much made into an easy go-to person for antis, haters, and others to shit on.\n\nEspecially because after going through the mess of 2014-2015, she started just having an IDGAF attitude and just lived her life like any normal 20 something.\n\nIt *infuriated* people that she acted so unbothered by everything they threw at her. So they just kept going to see her break.\n\nI can't speak to what the GP at large thought about her, but there were definitely subsets of people who *hated* her because of what she represented as an idol and as a woman.\n\nThis hate caused them to post their hate on her SNS *daily.* Like the magnitude of how every little thing she did was scrutinized and became fodder for hate is insane.\n\nSo...yeah, this got way longer than I expected, but to sum it up. The MeU fandom was just too small to drown out the various haters that shit on Sulli constantly.",

Sulli in particular had a fansite admin/friend/bully/akgae/stalker/anti with Jinnabit and that whole circus of a mess. Add on that Sulli was always the lightening rod of the group. Even though she wasn't even the youngest Sulli was made into the maknae of the group and expected by the gp basically to always maintain that youthful, bubbly, acquiescing, always happy and positive female maknae image and was attacked if she didn't live up to that impossible standard perfectly which duh no one can. From basically her debut with f(x) at 15 there were constant comments about her weight, she was often belittled for being \"fat\" (as if) and not having an an idol body. Her weight constantly yo-yo'd over the years likely as a result of the pressures put upon her to maintain a certain image even if it was unhealthy for her. \n\nIn later years she was attacked for not dancing hard enough or something such (when often she was underweight and pure exhausted) and would be accused of dragging down the group as a result of what they viewed as her lack of effort. There would be wild and hateful rumors about her which snowballed and eventually culminated in her abrupt hiatus from the group due to the constant hate she was under and the premature end of Red Light promotions which brought new waves of hate for her \"ruining\" f(x) and failing the group and all just for a (much older) man type comments. Before and after her official departure from f(x) Sulli would get hate if she met up with the other f(x) members to support them (how dare she after she left them like that type comments) or she would get hate if she didn't show support (how ungrateful after everything they put up with her type comments). And this is all stuff i saw coming from within certain areas of the fandom and not just antis or non-fans either but doubly so including those too. MeUs arent a very united fandom and they along with Sulli's own individual fandom were never enough to really shield much of the avalanche of hate she constantly received. \n\nHer quick and absolute rejection of the innocent, passive, and pure idol image previously laid upon her as a kid by sm along with her outspoken, defiant, and seemingly carefree attitude only increased the hate she received by many after leaving f(x) because that wasn't the way they were used to her behaving and expected someone like Sulli to behave. Sulli then became the whipping girl for everything basically and every little action and word became another reason to add to the pile as nothing she did was ever \"right\" but just another justification for their hate because she refused to live only in that idol box only to make others happy but not herself.",

And yet, because of the company he works for and the topics he chooses to write about, kpop fans and unassuming Korean people hell-bent on Western validation treats him like he is one. To his credit, he's had some interesting interviews, and I do think he does genuinely care about kpop artists and their fans.

Yeah, he's well-versed in kpop, and it shows when he writes vs when others write. Example: articles about SuperM. His made them human where others (unnecessarily) brought up Jonghyun and did the same old \"kpop is a machine with years of hard training\" spiel we've seen time and time again. Jeff didn't dumb his articles down and wrote them for the people most likely to read them - already existing kpop fans. He's done this before, like an article he did several months ago I believe on Minzy where he did a great, very long article on her.\n\nHe has the respect of kpop artists and if our favorites appreciate and like him, I don't know why so many people shit on him. There is a difference in how he writes his articles compared to people who just get thrown into an article (like The Hollywood Reporter article for BTS recently). At least he has a passion for the subject.",

We should be celebrating individualism in kpop, not treating idols like outcasts when they go against the grain. The perfect, tailored, trained idol image and behavior that is drilled into their heads and that has become the norm backfires spectacularly when anyone \"steps out of line\". Instead of seeing Sulli's actions as refreshing and empowering, people reacted with discomfort and disdain\n\nThese days more than ever I'm sick of the fakeness and concealed emotions we see left and right, how no one says a peep about injustices for fear of backlash, how everyone is intensely pressured to just stay in their own business and only say generic, industry-proper things. Sulli should've been the glowing example of how we can move forward instead of staying ignorant or worse, tolerant, of the silencing in this industry. But she wasn't until too late. And I'm saying this guilty as anyone because even though she is the epitome of what I've truly come to value in my years as a kpop fan, I didn't appreciate her enough either. I don't want to make the same mistake again. When someone is defying norms in a positive way, speaking out against wrong, acting and talking more freely in spite of backlash, we should encourage and support them, because it would be better if everyone is that way",

Not too long after that, she was working intensely, under fierce scrutiny, and being hated for doing things things most people here in the US take for granted. There\u2019s not a lot of room for learning coping skills and mature with that much going on at arguably her most critical time developmentally. \n\nThat\u2019s why I always cut her a slack for continuing to live her life despite knowing that it would be easier for her if she towed the line a bit more. I would act out too if I had constantly told what to do since age 11 and got hated for it anyway.

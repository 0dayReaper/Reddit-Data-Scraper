Wendy has been noted her vocals and skill in singing sharing both a gentle voice that expresses both warmth and clarity.\n\nWendy has worked with many artists releasing duets like John Legend, Yang Dail, and Eric Nam through SM STATION releases. Wendy has also shared solo OSTs for many dramas.\n\nWendy has been on hiatus since the end of 2019 following a fall from SBS Gayo's rehearsal. Since her return, Wendy has been returning to her activities as an artist through pictorials as well as an MC for JTBC's \"\uc2e0\ube44\ud55c \ub808\ucf54\ub4dc\uc0f5 (Mysterious Record Shop)\".

The vocal line members that didnt were already heavily leaning towards RnB in their vocal style (baekhyun, jonghyun, DO most likely). Non vocal line members make music that suits their performance styles (Taemin, Kai, Lay). Wendy hopefully gets to do more exciting music like Taeyeon but the type of songs she does in the radio show, OSTS and in her free time, dont make me hopeful she'll release anything but kballads. Note also how the description highlights \"gentle voice with warmth and clarity\", not \"versatility/crazy vocal acrobatics/power etc\".",

I hope it's a chance to show a side of her she doesn't really normally get to show as a soloist, and isn't a typical ballad. Wendy is an amazing performer with stage presence and enthusiasm that doesn't get highlighted enough. She's already done so many OSTs and ballads. I'd love to see her subvert all expectation and kill a dance track or something equally out of her norm. At the end of the day though, as long as it's something she's happy with, I'll be glad for her.",

She is also seen as having inferior visual compared to bandmates Seulgi, Irene and Joy. I do hope she is not end up like Luna. One of the most talented Idol Vocalist, flop as a solo singer.\n\nEdit : my god the downvote, god forbid I  talk other than sweet as sugar and pretty as rainbow about idol, or I am a hater.",

And Wendy is seen as quite the visual by a great many people, but stuff like that is personally subjective so if you dont find her pretty, especially compared to certain members, thats really just a you thing and not a good generalization.",

Like it's not a secret that Joy and Irene get ahead of her in popularity just because visual, but it is what it is, I can't change that. I found her very pretty, but I only one person and that doesn't mean shit if thousands other people thinks Irene and Joy are much prettier.\n\nI WILL GLADLY TO BE PROVEN WRONG BECAUSE WENDY DESERVES TO BE THE MOST POPULAR MEMBER OF RED VELVET.

Just on r/red_velvet Wendy was the #1 biased member in 2020 and #2 in 2019. For the yearly \"Top 100 Favorite Female Idols Chosen by Lesbian + Bisexual\" polls Wendy was #8 in 2020 (after #1 Irene and #2 Seulgi ), and #8 in 2019 (after #1 Seulgi and #2 Irene). She might have the fewest followers on ig, but even being the last member to create an account months after the others and with only 21 posts in a less than a year and 1/2 (and only 5 posts total in all of 2020) she still has over 4 million followers with a higher level of engagement than many accounts with much higher follower counts. She already has a couple of moderate hits to her name in korea, and her listener count on spotify has been over 1 million user for ages now which is the highest for any RV member and the only one so far to surpass that mark. \n\nPeople know her, she has a really solid reputation in korea, she is active on a variety show right now with her cover songs on there getting some attention, her c-fandom is sizable really dedicated, and ifans stream her music on the regular even with it mainly being old ballad ost and station songs. If sm puts the same level of effort into Wendy' solo debut that they did for I&amp;S's debut then i see solid physical sales and moderate digital performance at the least. There is no predicting the future, especially when it comes to sm, but all the ingredients are there for success.",

Sure the other members gets TONNES of clout and recognition, no doubt with their popularity, but Wendy is the only one that actually has LISTENERS. If you're worried about her sales, need I remind you that Monster only won ONCE because it fell off the chart after 3 hours? Not even the 250k sales can save it. Korean gp streaming matters, no matter how good the song intl fans think, if they don't like it then it's over.  Joy's OST was successful due to factors of drama popularity and a remake but that was only once, while Wendy has been consistent with her OST releases, even if it doesn't chart high, people still search for her name and song, some even chart higher than other OSTs in the drama, even if the drama itself wasn't popular (e.g MDIFY). Her listeners on Spotify too, increases every time she releases something, breaking her previous records. No other member has a track record of listeners like Wendy does. Why does it matter if she's not mainstream popular, when she has a dedicated fanbase and gp that are willing to support her?",

It stayed in the top 20 of Melon for weeks. The reason it only won on a music show once is because it was going up against Blackpink's HYLT. Like, Monster was even nominated for SOTY July for Gaon Awards, which is a digital based award. Idk where this perception came that it didn't perform well digitally.",

But yeah, the charting was the major factor, which usually isn't an issue for RV but it was so tough last summer\n\nAlso i probably am not worried about Wendy either, she's such a great singer, the GP usually recognizes it - her song with Eric Nam (Spring Love) always re-charts high on Melon every spring, she has won awards for her OSTs. She continues to get praise in her new role in Mysterious Record Shop. This is not the way some of us imagined either , but everyone who didnt know her now knew her when she had the accident in 2019. Also by virtue of RV themselves being a househould GP name, wendy is obviously fine.",

She didn\u2019t get a sub unit or web show, and hasn\u2019t acted in like three years. I believe it was on Sketchbook that she expressed interest in doing a solo album. Hopefully SM will give her something to do besides endorsements. \n\nPerhaps this is a start to the whole group getting solo albums. If they all renew their contracts and all solo debut a month apart, the last one would be in august, when their seven years are apparently up.",

That's all a rather big deal for an undebuted soloist. She also had a feature on Crush's song Mayday and took part in the Evergreen Tree charity song for front line workers. She also released the first (and so far only) official and hq song cover on Red Velvet's youtube channel. She also had her spot on Handsome Tigers variety show. She had at least 5 solo magazine shoots last year iirc, and that she is still snatching bigger and bigger cf deals is big too. \n\nThe other members didn't really have a ton going on besides magazine shoots as well because covid and Wendy's injury put a wrench in a lot of plans. Outside of group work the I&amp;S subunit (which was substantial) was near the only work Irene outside cfs had last year. Seulgi had the subunit mainly with a few smaller things like her art book translation, and Yeri only had Yeri's Room (which was unceremoniously cancelled) and the 2 NCSOFT Fever 2020 Cool Summer Project songs. \n\n2021 though has seen the start of a lot of new projects for the girls including new cfs deals for Seulgi, Wendy, Joy, and Yeri. January had Seulgi featuring on Yunho's solo mv and volkwagen cf song and mv with Bewhy, February had Irene's movie debut and solo ost for it, March had Yeri's acting debut, and April will have Wendy's solo debut. Joy is incredibly hard working, and i am sure she has something in the works as well. She has mentioned doing acting again and is likely in demand for more osts after her success last year. Just because one member is getting something doesnt mean another member cant get stuff too.",

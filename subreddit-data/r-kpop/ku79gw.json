(Yeah, okay.)\n\n&gt;\tThe group \"GOT7\" will be leaving JYP Entertainment.\n\n&gt;\tGOT7 recently completed their contracts with JYP Entertainment. They spent 7 years [with JYP] since their debut in 2014 (the maximum amount a standard contract can be). The awards show \"2021 Golden Disk Awards\" will be the last group promotion.\n\n&gt;\tJYP put out a careful statement earlier regarding the members' transfers. They are discussing ways to keep the group alive, but despite 1 to 2 members saying they wanted to renew their contracts, they refused if it wasn't with the full group. An industry official stated, \"GOT7's relationship is solid. The members collected their opinions within each other. However, opinions were divided regarding which company to go to. They decided to split after many meetings.\"\n\n&gt;\tThe members' moves are also gaining attention. The first member to move is Jinyoung. He will enter his exclusive contract with BH Entertainment (T/N Still not BigHit) soon. Currently, they are wrapping up discussions and looking to start full-scale activities in acting.\n\n&gt;\tYugyeom will move to hip-hop label AOMG. This is the place where Jay Park from JYP is CEO. He has already had a final meeting with higher-ups. He believes he can be able to learn hip hop and dance professionally.\n\n&gt;\tYoungjae received a love call from Sublime Artist Agency. This is where Song Kang Ho, Rain, Hani, etc are under. Rather than being an entertainment company(?), they're an agency. They promised to push not only music, but also CF, photoshoots, etc.\n\n&gt;\tTheir leader JB will of course also start anew. He received a love call from a famous hip hop label and a global record label. He is yet to decide the place that will support him in being a solo artist.\n\n&gt;\tThe foreign members also have deep concerns. Jackson is active in China and Korea. He will promote globally through his own global label, Team Wang. His Korean schedules will be held by the agency.\n\n&gt;\tBambam will also promote in Thailand and Korea. He found a company that will help him with producing contents while promoting in Korea. He is currently positively discussing a contract with MakeUs Entertainment.\n\n&gt;\tLastly, Mark will return to the US. He plans to spend time with his family in LA for the time being. Later, he will prepare to open his own YouTube channel. He might also have his own solo music in the US.\n\n&gt;\tAccording to someone who knows GOT7 well, \"The members have much affection for GOT7. They all agree to take time out of their personal activities to gather GOT7 together.\"\n\n&gt;\tMeanwhile, GOT7 debuted in January 2014 with \"Got It?\" They released hit songs such as \"Look\", \"Just Right\", \"Hard Carry\", \"If You Do\", \"Lullaby\", etc. They also achieved success as a global group with many world tours.\n\nedit: cleaned up translation a bit",

Types that would even go so far as to antagonize their own fans, out of some motivation only understood to them. Is anyone in GOT7 like that? Probably not (or at least not to that extent).

Makes sense to reward the members with essentially a cushy position for the rest of their life even if they want to retire from public life. \n\nGOT7 largely gets overlooked because of what Twice was able to do monetarily and how it shaped the future of the company. Twice's success in Japan is what lead to Niziu and what will lead to more localized groups that JYPE and other companies want. GOT7 still did a lot but it wasn't as flashy. They still developed a big fanbase in the SEA region and was able to have successful tours around the world though.",

For a market that is a big big consumer of kpop, Got7 have really solidified their place. I don't think younger JYP groups who have a pretty big fanbase in SEA would have had that same reception had it not been for the foundation which Got7 set up.",

I think if luck had been different and GOT7 was popular in Korea itself, it would have been a great combo and could have resulted in similar publicity to Twice.\n\nAnother big thing was the competition. Unlike Twice who essentially stood at the top in Korea and Japan and just under BP worldwide, GOT7's popularity in SEA couldn't compare to BTS's success worldwide or EXO/Wanna One's popularity in Korea.",

Jae wasn't invited to the OTV rp server at first but is on an arch of remedy and I think he is among the now invited people. \n\nr/livestreamfail had a hayday enjoying the drama, calling him weird and all names under the sun, blaming kpop and LSF was just toxic in general - think of a bunch of xQc viewers finding a bully victim.\n\nJae must have read all that, because the next time he streamed he sounded... rather broken, explained himself as missing social cues, taking all the blame, apologizing profusely and didn't really sound happy.\n\nWhile he did mess up and ruined other players' fun, I'd wish he hadn't read all the hate comments on reddit.\n\nEdit: go to r/livestreamfail and search for jae to find the drama and clips of what happened",

Nothings definite and we never know what\u2019s going to happen in the time before their contract expiration, but here are some thoughts on my end that I\u2019ve gathered from what Jae has mentioned throughout his streams. This could all happen, but it also might not\u2014 we won\u2019t really be sure until the actual expiration date.\n\nPersonally, it just doesn\u2019t look like Jae\u2019s career as an artist can flourish under JYP or in K-Pop in general. Additionally, even if he does re-sign with them and continues being 1/5th of DAY6, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything he could benefit from, staying as an Idol. Contract negotiations are probably going to be relatively difficult on JYP\u2019s end, consider there\u2019s little to none they could offer besides more creative freedom, increased pay, and maybe other insignificant details. This isn\u2019t even including the bad blood Jae already has with Studio J, and his outward distaste and irritation in how poorly they\u2019ve been managing him and DAY6 as a whole. It seems like they\u2019ve done everything to stunt his/their growth rather than to promote or support Jae. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s intentional, or they seriously had a lack of faith in his success as a soloist but they\u2019ve done some stuff to sabotage Jae solo endeavors. I.E. not promoting Jae\u2019s HDIGH podcast at Dive Studios, forcing him to stop uploading to Youtube, **and something as outrageous as telling it to his face that he will never amount to anything.**\n\nSome other stuff that\u2019ll be good to mention that might sway his decision to leave JYP, is that he\u2019s over idol life. I can\u2019t even count how many times he\u2019s gone off on his streams, clowning K-Pop stans and their unrealistic views of K-Pop idols, like farting or burping. He\u2019s also mentioned how he hates the fact his fans will baby him and tell him to do aegyo like he isn\u2019t almost a 30 year old man lmfao. From his streams, I can slightly gauge his real personality is extremely far fetched from his K-pop persona, and man, he just sounds tired of having to censor and cater himself for his fans lol.\n\nAnyways, it also sounds like he\u2019s acclimated himself into a good community on twitch as well as befriending lots of artists/people in the West, especially now that he\u2019s acquainting himself with 88Rising (Which honestly I\u2019m 75% sure he might sign with after Day6 or as a Western label). Not to mention the loads of friends he already had prior to K-Pop, so I\u2019m sure the trek back home to LA might not be so difficult for him.\n\nI could see his solo career taking off and being extremely successful if he decides to step away from the confines of JYP &amp; K-Pop as a whole and decides to shed his idol image. By then, he can choose to finally monetize Twitch and Eaj Project.\n\n\n**(ORIGINAL TEXT)**\nI\u2019ve watched almost all of his streams and honestly it sounds like there\u2019s nothing that JYP or K-Pop could offer him to stay or benefit from. Unfortunately it sounds like Studio J did everything except support/promote Jae and even going as far as sabotaging his individual endeavors like Youtube, EaJ Project. Not to mention how much it sounds like he\u2019s over the Idol life bc of cancel-culture and having to censor himself lmfao. I could only imagine how well his solo career could take off not having been strapped down by JYPE and actually make money off his streams and solo music lmfao. It also sounds like he\u2019s got a good crowd of friends to surround himself with back in the States too.\n\n**EDIT:** Fixed it to make it an easier read lmfao",

This isn\u2019t actually a bad thing - it just means that JYPE might not be that good a fit for them, given that its main focus is still idol groups and not really bands. \n\nThis might also account for the complaints about Day6 being mismanaged or not promoted enough - JYPE might be applying its strategies of managing idol groups to a band, without realizing that there are differences between the two. For starters, most people who listen to bands, especially indie bands, are used to the band being more unfiltered, as well as members using social media and creating their own content to promote themselves + members doing a lot more individual endeavors (when you can play instruments and produce your own music and have experience already, it\u2019s a lot easier to do your own stuff - I come from a country in which a lot of musicians are in multiple bands + running multiple side-projects, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m familiar with). \n\nIf JYPE is just trying to use its idol groups\u2019 promotional strategy on a band, then I can see the problem (its marketing/promotions for idol groups are also not keeping up with other companies but that\u2019s a topic for another day). Couple that with the fact that a lot of the management at JYPE might be older (and hence not really familiar with/willing to approve less conventional marketing strategies; basically boomer behaviour) + JYPE possibly being understaffed, and you have a recipe for dissatisfaction. \n\nI definitely see the Day6 members leaving as a high possibility - they may all choose to sign (either individually or as a group) at label (s) which focus more on music - this might mean moving out of the idol group ecosystem entirely. Tbh this might be better for a couple of the members - Jae for the reasons that you mentioned. Another one is Wonpil - I think he might do better in a more indie career. He\u2019s my bias in the group but I\u2019ll also admit that him being more introverted/low-energy (I also share these traits so I can empathize) means that he doesn\u2019t seem entirely comfortable on mainstream variety shows (the types that focus on idol groups) - he\u2019d do better on shows that focused more on music, or on things that he\u2019s interested in (that sneaker show he appeared on was fun because you can tell he\u2019s interested in sneakers). I definitely think he doesn\u2019t really prefer the spotlight as much unless it\u2019s for his music. \n\nI can potentially see Young K and Dowoon staying  with JYPE, not really sure which way Sungjin is going to go. \n\nBasically, I\u2019m kind of preparing myself for the possibility that Day6 may also choose to leave JYPE - it hurts but it does look like a likely outcome.",

GOT7's treatment should just be an anomaly and the next BG should be treated like Itzy's treated.\n\nEdit: Was watching some of those best kpop music videos on youtube and got to listen to Stop Stop It and A again. Seems like such a different time and the group was so different back then. Glad I could get to know them and find some great songs in their discography.",

            "comment": "i was merely laughing at the bambam x jyp beef on ig and twitter a few days ago but now that this is really happening, it feels so incredibly bittersweet. i've always had the hunch that last piece being given the bare minimum promo and shitty management overall that this was it-they're all gonna leave. i expected it but it's still sad nonetheless. although i followed got7 on and off for the most part of these 7 years and didn't really ult them, they were one of my go to groups when it comes to content and music. to be there since jj project days back in 2012 (my sister jammed to bounce a lot back then) and seeing them go their separate ways makes me feel that it's also kind of an end of an era for me-- that i really am getting older and times are changing. \n\nwhenever i need a good laugh, i would just watch got7 content on youtube and i'd be okay again. they were one of the few groups whose dynamics i adore. the way their personalities and humor, albeit different, still bounce off each other so well reminds me of my own friend group. i'm really happy that they now have the chance to pursue whatever they want but it's also saddening that realistically, things just won't be the same. \n\ni'm glad i was able to see them at least once in person and i'll surely treasure that time for long. got7 will truly leave a big empty spot for me that other boy groups would just not be able to fill. they truly were something and it makes me angry that this all could've been avoided had they been treated better.",

I\u2019m happy for them though, the wild amount of mistreatment with the company, div 2, and shade JYP constantly threw at them was disgusting. \n\nI hope Jaebeom goes to AOMG, even Amoeba would be a good fit for him. I bet the global label is Warner or Sony. I hope Mark comes back to Korea, I think he has an opportunity to finally act or break into the Chinese market. \n\nI do fear that the chance they actually get to release music together again as GOT7 is slim. I doubt JYP will give them right to the name without taking a huge cut. Also when groups break apart like this, how often do they actually come back together to make music? Look at Block B and VIXX, I don\u2019t see them coming together to make music anytime soon even if serving in the army wasn\u2019t a factor. \n\nI\u2019m sad and happy for them at the same time and I\u2019ll support them no matter where they go.",

The boys are still selling albums so well despite tough competition!  Why the mismanagement??

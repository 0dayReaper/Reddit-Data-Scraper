There's also a footnote that the sentence will be lengthened if a minor is involved. So I guess it is indeed illegal regardless whether there are minors involved or not.\n\nEdit: I read further and it seems like there's a lot of nuance to it ; for example they won't do anything if you're an occasional participant, but if you are a very recurring participant or the organizer, they can arrest you by law.\n\nApart from that, apparently they usually don't care if it's in a private space, but if it's done in a semi-publicized manner ( e.g. kinda like rich circle orgies I think?) then they are more likely to prosecute you.",

He didn't pay 25 million in taxes so will be fined 84 million usd in fines? That's insane. I have a hard time believing he ever even made enough money to pay 25 million in taxes. Especially if he also had to pay taxes in Canada. \n\nBut, regardless, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMaWegICQHA&amp;t=7s) about how \"nobody pays taxes\" in China had an interesting detail. So basically, China gets most of their tax money from land leases, nobody TRULY owns property. And I've always wondered why so many Chinese celebrities got busted for not paying taxes. CCP is a scary group, you're really going to be a famous actor and try to cheat the party? Anyway, things made a lot more sense after I listened to this [part of the video](https://youtu.be/qMaWegICQHA?t=693). I wonder if there's a bit of that going on here even though it seems simply being a sex pest was enough.",

It's incredibly well documented, the Pope himself has apologized, but people get really touchy about that. But not just religious institutions, I saw people acting pretty crazy defending Bill Cosby in America. I see why so many rapes go unreported.

            "comment": "It\u2019s sad that following kpop means I conditioned myself to expect bullshit pissweak jail sentences for entertainment industry rapists with time off for time already there and good behaviour and shit. Now I\u2019m actually surprised that he\u2019s gotten a fair amount of years, thirteen years is nothing to sniff at for a rape sentence anywhere. Of course I know that China doesn\u2019t give any more of a shit about women than Korea and the rest of the world and unique circumstances probably forced their hand on this one (the way this story blew up internationally and otherwise, his status as \u2018not a true Chinese citizen\u2019, them trying to \u2019clean up\u2019 and further put the entertainment industries under their direct control, general tough on crime shit) but at least it couldn\u2019t have happened to a more deserving piece of shit.",

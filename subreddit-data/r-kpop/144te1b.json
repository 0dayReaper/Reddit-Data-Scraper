There are a lot of different versions of the song on Spotify to listen to and I highly recommened Retro Electric Mix, it's fantastic and might be my preferred version, although I do love the original as well! The MV is also super pretty with AleXa looking incredibly stunning, I love her short hair so much!",

It's nice to see her continue to improve where else most idols seem to plateau after they hit a certain peak in their skills. I hope her team/label can craft AleXa some bops because she has all the base ingredients for what I consider to be a well-rounded idol performer.",

I guess at a certain point, a singer just becomes \"pop singer who can sing in Korean and English\" and it doesn't matter if they're \"k-pop\" or not.  Like I said, *me problem*.\n\nThe third thought is: She's definitely growing into her career now.  All of her other songs were fun or powerful dance bangers.  This is a wistful ballad about a love that didn't work out.\n\nThe fourth thought is:  [HOLY SHIT GET THIS GIRL A COLLAB WITH DENISE ASAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJ5eERwjZI).  [I KNOW YOU TWO ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER AND HANG OUT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02HNuFLIp_s).  Their voices would complement each other so well.",

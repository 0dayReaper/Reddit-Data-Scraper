This must have been a hard thing to do- and I'm sure they're facing difficult consequences.   \nAlso, if you're feeling strange about this seeming like a performance- these are kids from an Art school who have probably always felt that the easiest ways to express themselves is through art/music/drama/performance. These are difficult topics to deal with an its probably easier to funnel that through an art piece than just simply putting their story in to words staring at a camera while feeling vulnerable. Plus, and what was probably at the forefront of their mind when they decided to do this:  they wanted this video to gain an audience and be impactful + be shared so that their story would reach further than if one single student spoke quietly at a vlog camera. \n\n  \n",

She rents one floor of her house to another Korean lady and her son. \n\nHer microwave stopped working, so we replaced it. But that wasn't enough for her... She demanded we hang it where the old one was. (One of those above the stovetop kind.) I had no idea how to do this, neither does my mother. While I'm there trying to figure it out and failing, I said, \"Hanging it isn't exactly a landlord's requirement...\" \n\nOH MY GOD GUYS SHE FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT. She started kicking boxes and *screaming* at me! \"Take it back then! I don't want it! You mannerless bitch! How dare you talk to an elder that way! Who taught you manners?!\" all in Korean of course... \n\nI have never seen an adult woman act like this. Holy crap. Koreans have a major problem with ageism in the reverse way, where they think of anyone younger than them as lesser than. And even if they are wrong -- you better not correct them if you're younger or else you have no manners. I mean yes I could've been nicer, maybe tried harder to hang it, but does my saying that one phrase merit me being treated that way? She literally got in my face and was spitting mad.

Still, you have to imagine they had friends or acquaintances at the school who were involved in some of the illegal/unethical BS they were forced to do. \n\nIt's just sad to think that the corruption could really go this deep. To literally exploit kids to do disgusting acts for selfish gain. The ability to take advantage of their desperation to become an idol and then cover it up completely by threatening them to end their aspiring career before it even starts....it's gross.",

I think anytime people who dont have their morals straight are placed in a high position of power, they will abuse and screw people over to hell and back. I guess i was trying to express that the system CAN create pedophiles if they arent dilligent. I just know its hard for powerful people to keep their head in the game.\n\nFor example, YG hasnt sexually abused anyone (that we know of, i wouldnt put it past that scumbag) but he used his power to end his own trainees career so that he could marry her. \n\ntheres also a lot of things to consider when thinking about the Korean entertainment system before we say it creates pedophiles. Theres just a lot to talk about in that topic in general because we could even say parenting can set you up to be a pedophile if we tried. The gist of what im saying is in the Korean society, and pretty much everywhere in the world, the rich and powerful go unchecked and they get bored and start playing with people, whether its sexually or otherwise, and thats how come we see alot of powerful people that love abusing minors on a large scale. I dont think most people start out that way, because its unnatural. And if they do start out as a predator they probably just act good to get along i.e. school",

Not even the air we breathe is 100% oxygen or itll kill us. There are always steps we can take to cut down on things but there will always be some things we dont catch. Theres tons of ways we can figure out to stop pedos from getting that high but then again they can pretend to be good, and like i said i doubt most even start out with those intentions. Power does things to you.\n\nI went to a super strict school and new rules were always being made but everyone just did what they wanted anyway. Racism is being fought daily in america but theres always gonna be the minority that teaches their kids to hate. \n\nNo matter how many rules we make we cant end it completely. But something needs to be done and i think the most obvious flaws everyone sees in Korea is the clash of the new gen with the old generation making laws that supress the new gen and make things difficult by protecting rich criminals, and flaws that naturally stem from it being a hiearchial society. We still cant even get them to recognize abuse exists within their society so how will we convince them that power and influence shouldnt protect bad people and that they should be punished :/",

People keep saying its what should be expected from the entertainment industry....but I just dont see how a private high school is considered part of the industry. Just because its tangentially related to the arts, suddenly a high school principal pimping out minors that just wanted to learn how to sing and dance is to be expected? Does this extend to singing coaches? Dance studios?

Thats why the students took this approach. Big headlines that destroy powerful peoples reputations get removed and taken off Naver which is like their version google. The burning sun controversy involving seungri was stiffled and removed partially. When something happened with the president a few years ago the news selected stories about tiffany from snsd to push to the top. A lot of censorship happens in the Korean news and things that should take off and be viral with national attention dont because the government protects the rich people and what gets shown on the news. Also the 2/3 of their major news outlets are conservative  so they try their best to have tradional values and views. \n\nAnd im sorry, but singers that are famous dont have a voice. Their fans will turn on them. Their label will also oppress them.  Whenever idols speak up about things everyone doubts them.  it was hard even for the chinese idols that sued SM to prove their cases of abuse. One even lost his case and is in debt now. \n\nI wish it were better but Korea is a different country with a different society and things work a little differently over there when it comes to abuse. No one admits or acknowledges its a problem...or at least people that are are being supressed buly the older generation. But things are changing, slowly",

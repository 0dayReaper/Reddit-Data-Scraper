I bet there's another 10 minute MV coming after the main official one and that makes me very excited. The cinematography looks so pretty and I love the mood and the asthetics . Their acting is also so good ? K and Nicholas stood out to me . I'm impressed.\n\nI also have a suspicion that there's a bit more to it than just them fighting over the same girl. I feel like there's more to it but we'll see. Can't wait for Wednesday",

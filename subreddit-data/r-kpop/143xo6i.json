So incredibly proud of them and CARATs for this achievement!",

So some of the trainees wouldn't do their best because they thought they were bound to get a spot.  But Hoshi didn't have a plan B so he really wanted to debut *and* have the group succeed.  He saw the kids who weren't trying their hardest and thought, \"If I debut with these guys, our group will fail, and *I* can't have that because this is all I have, I want to succeed and I want to take care of my family.\"\n\nEven a decade later, all 13 still seem hungry to challenge themselves as performers while making people happy, and they don't seem complacent.\n\nThat bigass number in the headline?  This the result of that.",

Yeah understandable that he was like that. And thanks to his strictness with everything involves performing that SVT is known for their synchronization.\n\nIn fact many SVT members came from lower middle class families and the group was prolly their only chance of bettering their situation/helping their parents out, so I guess that's why they still have that \"grindset\" (lol) even when they're already 8 years into their careers.",

If he had gone to college, he would've served in the military in the middle of it too, so he'd be around 24-25 when he'd graduate and start making money. Pledis on the other hand had promised to debut SVT way earlier than that and luckily they scrambled enough money to do so. It's a bet that fortunately worked out in his favor but yeah I can't imagine what would happen to him if it didn't.",

Japan and US are another 250k . The rest 400k from the rest of the world. Probably SK and sea mostly because they grew a lot on these regions and it's visible in their streams, on Spotify Super doubled compared to HOT in SEA and obv the Sk charting has been amazing, doubled their numbers there too) \n\nStray Kids Maxident had 600k preorders from China bars, 5 star has 1.1m preorders. ( 500k growth in China, 120k in the US , Oricon isn't out but based on their jpn album in Feb my guess is 350-500k growth. Case 143 going viral in Japan helped so much. You can see it in S class charting too and streams.  It's probably the only place where Case 143 did better than Maniac . Taking the upper range for Japan that's 1.1m from China jpn and us out of 2.76m preorders growth. Where the rest is coming from idk. There's no other countries with album charts who reveal numbers and the Spotify streams for s class vs maniac don't have a big difference in europe, latam , sea to tell. They grew a bit in SK but not hugely. 20k more UL first day compared to Maniac from 168 daily to 103 or sth) \n\nTXT Thursday's Child album had 154,158 preorders from China bars, Temptation had 560k . TXT had a 880k preorder jump, 400k out of those China, around 80k US and 35k Japan. So that covers around 500k+ from the jump. The rest's probably SK since their digital charting grew dramatically between Minisode and Temptation. They doubled their numbers too when it comes to digital charting.",

If you sell 2M in China alone, this means you should match the digitals of household names there. I doubt this is the case. Same way that if you can sell 1M in Japan this means you've had at least some substantial hits over there and can compete with household names' digitals. All those sales are cool to see at first glance but the reality is that none of it has substance to it, especially in the streaming era, as much as kpop stans would like to ignore that.",

Even if you take China sales out ( 2.1m preorders for SVT, 1.1m for Stray Kids, 770k for Mots7) some of these groups have more sales than MOTS7 had globally-China yet 1/3 or 1/5 the streams everywhere. This sales boom we are in is largly thanks to the boom of versions and other tricks of the industry and not just kpop exploding like never before, otherwise you'd see the same growth in the streams too. Kpop is  growing globally and as such so are the groups I'm not saying they're not at all but I don't think you can take the sales at face value and say this is the level they are at when the streams are growing but not nearly to the same pace as the sales , not even half.\n\nBTS streams matched their sales  but they don't for the bgs who are breaking records right now.  I'm actually a fan of some of these groups like seventeen and I am happy they are doing so well but these numbers should all be looked at in context when comparing to albums that came before 2021/2022 when 10+ versions, random photobooks/binders, hundreads of pcs , videocalls for fans all over the world weren't common. There is a reason people back then said the record wouldn't be broken for decades and they had a good reason. The sales landscape isn't remotely the same to back in 2020/early 2021. It's not even comparable .",

China has been open to kpop for awhile now THOUGH.\n\nRegardless of what you said, kpop groups still have their music up on Chinese platforms, and some artists still promote in China (groups with Chinese members and other foreign members like Lisa), and the digitals are NOT matching the sales either way. Having 2M sales in a particular country means you are practically a household name and should have digitals on par with some local acts, none of these groups' music has that kind of presence, which makes the sales look suspicious. Actually I do not even have to compare to local Chinese acts. Jisoo sold less but still has better digitals than them and some actual virality. These boy groups selling the same physical sales numbers on par with their numbers in SK while being virtually unknown is still not adding up and people have the right to question it. Charting at #50 something on a ''new kpop music'' real time chart is not digitals on par with 2M sales.",

Their variety show Going Seventeen has become huge (and has its own fandom, people who don\u2019t even listen to SVT\u2019s music, just watch their content \u2014 although quite a few have started to explore their music now too), HOT (their last comeback single) went viral for a few different reasons, and with BTS on hiatus, a lot of people have turned to SVT to fill the gap. There\u2019s actually been a few jokes about the ARMY to Carat pipeline \u2014 SVT is a group from the same generation with a very similar come up story to BTS, and both groups are friendly with each other. SVT also boasts some s-tier vocalists, multiple aces, and some of the (if not the) best synchronization in the industry. They\u2019re self-producing, which a lot of fans appreciate, and also wonderfully entertaining. They\u2019re like an improv group half the time, and their chemistry is undeniable. Their sound can change but at their heart they make a lot of solid pop which is appealing to the GP. And if you\u2019re pretty into kpop on Twitter, tiktok, etc it\u2019s hard to avoid seeing memes about them. Overall I think it\u2019s a combo of good timing and great talent!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying people have left BTS for SVT lol. I\u2019m only saying that a lot of ARMYs have been open to SVT like they haven\u2019t been towards other bgs bc of the fact that SVT and BTS are friends and that\u2019s one factor that I think has really helped SVT\u2019s growth. Obviously they\u2019re not going to replace BTS, not for me either, but it\u2019s worth mentioning. I\u2019ve seen so, so many ARMYCarats on tiktok and Twitter talking about this too so it\u2019s not just something I cooked up. And of course SVT have also found new fans organically that have nothing to do with BTS. I just highlighted that fact bc it applied to me and it was a consistent pattern I\u2019ve seen.",

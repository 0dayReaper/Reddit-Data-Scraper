Plus he had 6 million followers on instagram, it just seems counterproductive to make him delete his account. Hopefully the next step isn't deleting the sungtaro videos on nct's channel and the debut is announced very soon",

It\u2019s not like there\u2019s been an issue with the company and they\u2019ve left and are re-debuting somewhere else. They\u2019re in good standing with the company and are being debuted in a new SM group.\n\nI understand going dark and maybe not posting while preparations are happening. But wiping out the past when nothing controversial happened seems unnecessary.\n\nChaewon and Sakura of Le Sserafim for example went dark on their pre-existing profiles for a handful of months leading to the debut announcement, but still kept their old content. And they weren\u2019t even debuting in the same company as their former groups.",

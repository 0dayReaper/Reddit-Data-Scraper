                                    "comment": "Xiumin would definitely be in a far worse place than just about any trot singer I'd say. Trot singers don't rely on boyfriend/girlfriend appeal and parasocial relationships to anywhere near the degree of an idol and therefore their personal lives can have far less disastrous an effect on their careers. Idols having a squeaky clean image and being in a lot of ways blank slate projection fodder for their fans is a huge amount of their appeal especially to the fans who support them the most. Xiumin is an interesting example however, as he's already paid off his debts and no doubt accumulated at least decent wealth from his career, which means he has far less to lose and as Exo is an older group a lot of their fans are therefore older than the average kpop fan and more forgiving of idols having personal lives of their own. The average idol has none or few of these luxuries. There are very few active idol groups with long enough running careers that award them the financial security and mature fanbase to not take a hit from a member coming out. Perhaps Shinhwa, Super Junior, or even to a lesser extent Exo could get away with it without much losses but the same could not be said for most. There's also the added aspect of being a member of a group rather than a soloist. Kwon Dowoon has few people relying on his image for their own gain, while idol groups have to be aware that one bad egg among them can easily tarnish the career trajectory of the others in the group.",

Exo, Suju and Shinhwa recently all had straight relationship reveals and their fans still got upset. And seeing how Korean variety shows treat Jaeduck and Tony just for being male roommates does not give me much hope. They straight up get asked when they will finally separate and go get wives. Apparently Jiwon tried to argue against them staying together for two hours and when Jaeduck told this story on Happy Together the hosts were on Jiwon's side. And that is (as far as we know) just about them living together and remaining unmarried. And in Kpop they have the most seniority, as they are from the oldest and most successful groups of 1st gen.",

The thing with Tony and Jaeduck is that they are in their forties with established careers and no shortage of money. They live together because they really enjoy living together and they have been living together for about ten years. They have two dogs together and manage their finances together. Because of that their relationship frequently gets compared to a marriage and they have rumors of being a couple. And it's either a) they are not a couple and people tell them to separate because being platonic life partners is not okay, they need to fulfill their filial duty and get married and have children or b) they are a couple and people straight up tell them they shouldn't be together because only being with women is okay. No one is ever supportive of them even if as far as we know they are just platonic life partners. Thus they probably would not be supportive of them as a couple either.",

Can you imagine living with your best friend till your 40 with great jobs together? That's literally my dream life, I wish I could do that too fuck those people who give them shit. But you're right if they can't handle 2 guys wanting to live on their own together then theyd be horrible if they were gay. It's not like everyone wants kids and maybe they just like being with women but don't want to live with them cause then they'll just get bothered about not having kids yet, which if they live with another guy wouldn't be an issue but now they have their own set of problems.",

Young people now just don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so wrong and many have LGBTQ+ people in their friend circles. One of my best friends is a guy who admitted before he got gay friends that he was quite homophobic and transphobic from his upbringing. After living on his own for a while and befriending many queer people he realized that that part of his upbringing was a lie and there was nothing wrong with being queer :) here\u2019s to better times ahead!",

I don't think anyone cares to be honest and as someone who is LGBT myself, there's no one talking about it within the community either even though I'm pretty involved with the community.

            "comment": "I'm really happy for this dude. But to be brutally honest, its gonna rile up some koreans since that country is still hella conservative (most of the older generation).\n\nWhen Hong Suk Chun came out of the closet in 2000, it was a total shitshow as news outlets completely shelled the fuck out of him with front page headlines such as [\"I am a homo.\"](https://ww.namu.la/s/afda97366e472f6c72464df3c026bb71e8cc59a738f980273f0eccb910ec875dcc1452b76efd8cf8fadb44609134026381c0c02a78791ae8ebcb0f2e517be77983b2117da9ec87bf891b5780b0dca7136c9eaa2f9ab0a5cfc0e103da6c47325ee7f68835ad4f54025fd308642cafcb45) and all that. Because of this incident Hong himself struggled for many years until people started to accept him for who he was and now he's the most prolific gay celebrity in Korea. \n\nI'm pretty sure there are many celebrities who are LGBTQ in Korea but are too scared to come out because the media and society might treat them like shit when it does happen. I'm a Korean and I am somewhat into Korean entertainment, but the only high profile celebrity i know there who was gay was Hong. So I'm proud that there are more celebrities out there who have the guts to take a stand and show who they really are and I hope more of them do the same.",

For me personally and for a lot of LGBTQIA folks like me, a lot of what we have said has been misconstrued. I believe Sakura\u2019s comments were initially in Japanese and the the English translation interpreted as alluding that she would be okay being with a woman. Living in japan and speaking the language, I\u2019ve noticed that in writing and in speaking, many things are not very much concisely indicated hence why I would rather not jump the gun until it\u2019s more explicitly said from her own mouth.",

But once i listened to Chaconne, the hardwork became useless cuz i still forgot the sound. Or is this some conspiracy.. cuz Chaconne is actually a song about Dancing the \"Dance of Death\". Its related to d- what if its a curse song.. its making you fell deep into the song like you're in another dimension and its hard to get back to reality at the end smth like that \ud83d\udc40",

The first verse might just be my favourite part of any song ever.\nChaconne &gt; didn't like it much based on the preview but it's so addicting, especially the chorus.\n\nKarma moved down a bit, because I wished the chorus was a bit more hard-hitting and I don't like the fake audience sounds during the bridge. Still really enjoy the song though.\n\nFate is my favourite enha intro so far, both the song and the narration is very immersive.",

But I think in the long run it will be Bills, its the perfect song to blast in the car on a road trip, just like post Malone Circles (interesting, both are about break-up lol). \n\nThe choreo made sacrifice even better, i'm still hopping for a Chaconne choreo (and I think we will get it). Also, just another day of me wanting an enhypen's intro/outro to be a full song. I agree with some that Karma isn't their best rock song, but still a good song. Pretty solid album, I liked way better than the last one.",

            "comment": "\nThe album is their most cohesive so far and most songs have grown on me. However Bite Me pains me too much to listen to it more than once in a while because of how much wasted potential it has. However, Chaccone and sacrifice in particular have really grown on me. Bills is still my favorite of the album while unexpectedly, I dislike Karma more now compared to before when it was my my second favorite song of the album, I guess it is because re listening to their other rock songs like attention please and shout out, I think Karma is inferior to both so yea. \n\nOver all I actually think this might be their weakest or one of their weaker albums. I ended up liking it more than I was predicting but still I think particularly production-wise the album held back and could have been stronger. And yes fate should have been a full song. \n\nAlso me saying it is one of their weaker albums isn't really a bad thing because Enhypen have yet to release any mid or weak albums lol this album is still quite good in the grand scheme of things but I know in my heart it could have been better.",

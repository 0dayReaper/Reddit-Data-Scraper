Then the past few months has been SHINee focused with recording, comeback photo shoots and multiple mvs, fanmeets, and upcoming concerts and comeback(s) with his own rumored solo repackage release.

I don't think his age has much to do with it because he is only in his early 30s not early 50s. \n\nIf anything, it would be more common for him to get more sick/be prone to injury when he was younger because our bodies are still growing well into our mid 20s.

SHINee talked back then about dieting, and they still diet before comebacks (the members [complained](https://twitter.com/_cheesymochi/status/1361503117880139779) about Onew's strict diet in 2021).\n\nKey said the first time he was called fat was as a trainee in SM. I think that people don't realize the dieting and yo-yo weight of male idols because they don't wear as revealing clothes as female idols. But weight is not only about the appearance of the body, but of the face. Taemin for example is very worried about this as he gains weight in his face easily. In livestreams he worries about food and pinches his cheeks and [comments negatively on his face](https://twitter.com/iheartshinee_/status/1330428631273906176), his round cheeks and his jawline. I used to think he was obsessing for no reason. But when he returned from the military with a little bit of weight gain he received a torrent of cruel comments about his looks from the public, not just in Korea but international Kpop fans (not his fans) did too. Then Taemin lost weight very quickly for his fanmeeting and received praise for looking like his pre-military days again.",

Just gonna be blunt here...I'm glad that Onew will be taking time to recover from his health condition but having been a debut SHINee enjoyer and kpop fan since 07.....I doubt him being given the proper time to rest, unfortunately. SM has rushed out their idols during illness or injuries without proper recovery time during comebacks before. I'm not saying this to be negative or rude, it's just what typically happens in idol companies big, small, or in between. It hasn't changed much over the years. I just hope the fans don't make a big deal out of it and harass the members about it. Onew needs proper care and rest for his health, so don't be weird about that. A person's health is more important than promoting and performing. Shawols have done great this year with the way they rallied for the members to have a bigger venue for their fan meeting, so keep that energy for this comeback, and don't get discouraged.",

And of course it's because Onew will just have to temporarily put the brakes on his promotions with the rest of SHINee and focus on taking very good care of all of his currently undisclosed health issues.  So ummmm, yeah.  That is all, ladies and gentlemen.

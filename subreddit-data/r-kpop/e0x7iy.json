My hope was that it was her decision and what she believed she needed as part of her recovery.  \n  \nIt's wrong to blame her support system however. There's only so much you can do as a friend/acquaintance or as a party to their treatment. If someone is in crisis, you can monitor them until it passes, but there's a point where you have to allow them some autonomy.  \nYou *can* help monitor them *to a point*, making sure they are eating, resting, taking medication and attending appointments. You can talk to them and let them know you are available to be talked to. You can visit and/or invite them out. Etc.  \n  \nStaying beside someone 24/7 is a temporary measure to give that person the opportunity to get help. They have to make the decision to continue and once they make that decision, you have to allow them. The idea isn't to \"force\" them to live by making sure they can never harm themselves, but to help them come to the realization that it's not the only option.  \n  \nIf you did everything you could, then you did enough. It was never your decision to make and it was made before you got involved. You shouldn't blame yourself for not being able to change their mind, nor should anyone else.",

But, once again, it's much more hurtful to see hate on your own language, so it just so happens to affect them more. \n\nAnd I also think a lot of people are underestimating Koreans' english comprehension. Most of them can understand basic words such as 'hate' or 'ugly'. One of the members in one of my favorite groups, Seunghee from OMG, even said in a show once that she saw english comments on their videos only to realize they're hate comments (she also said she knows when a korean wrote an english comment or not) so..... Yeah. \n\nInternational fans are pretty shitty too. I hate that int fans try to act innocent and blame everything on knetz :/",

Just got back into kpop this year after a 7 year hiatus and this was also the first year where I've seen a psychiatrist and gotten treatment for depression. Returning to kpop was kind of my way of retreating to happier times back in 2009-2012 when I wasn't as lonely and depressed but seeing all the tragedies that happened this year in kpop makes it feel like everything's come full circle for me, and all the music I once associated with youthful innocence and escapism before I knew of the shit the artists go through now becomes tinged with sadness. As usual with any of these posts, people are bound to come from r/all and start criticising the shitty kpop industry and question how any of us with a conscience can even enjoy it. I kind of agree, but at the same time, fuck yall for just coming here to flaunt your moral superiority in not supporting kpop or whatever. I guarantee that everyone on this sub would rather see their idols happy and healthy than have them be miserable, even if it meant them taking a break or retiring entirely. As fans, we're all already painfully acquainted with the cognitive dissonance that comes with deriving pleasure from the suffering of our idols, so we don't need you to tell us that. Imagine if your brother died of a drug overdose, and this stranger shows up at the funeral and starts telling you how drugs are ruining society and he would never take drugs because he knows it's bad for him? Probably a bad analogy, but the point is, while it's fine to point out the need for greater mental health awareness and companies being more responsible for taking care of the well-being of their artists, at least try and be respectful to the recently deceased, as well as their family, friends and fans in your comments. This might be a slight overreaction on my part since I fortunately don't see many such comments being made here so far, but I got a little triggered from the comments on Stereogum's post for Sulli. Anyway, although I said the exact same thing the last time this happened and may sadly be repeating myself in the future, I really hope the rest of the industry keeps on high alert to look out for any of the other artists who might be at risk to prevent yet another tragedy from taking place. Rest in peace Goo Hara, you deserved much more than this life could give, and may the next world treat you more kindly.",

Sulli is proud of you. \n\nHonestly after the Burning Sun scandal, Sulli\u2019s passing and now this I think I\u2019ve decided to step away from the world of K-Pop for the time being. What brought me joy and comfort at one point in my life is now bringing me pain and depression. I think it\u2019s best to simply take a step back from all of this and come back at a later date.\n\nEDIT: in response to /u/hatsuho since you deleted [your reply](https://i.imgur.com/XQL0TJE.jpg)...\n\nFirst of all, you have no idea the kind of adversity I\u2019ve faced in my life to make assumptions about my age or the life I\u2019ve lived. My life has been anything but blind and sheltered. I was thrown out of my own home at a very young age and had to fend for myself.\n\nTake a look back at all of the unfortunate events that have happened within the past year.  Maybe I\u2019m just sick and tired of feeling like no matter what anyone does isn\u2019t enough. That doesn\u2019t mean we will stop fighting. It\u2019s just an extremely frustrating aspect of not only K-Pop but the world in general. \n\nI\u2019m not \u201crunning\u201d from anything. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to take a step back to process these kinds of things. Death happens to all of us at the end of the day whether we like it or not. It\u2019s up to us how we cope with it. Like you said, reality doesn\u2019t wait, it keeps rolling.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m sad but I\u2019m also so angry, Hara was at risk but no one seems to have been around her supporting her properly. Getting back into work after her suicide attempt and Sulli was not the right thing for her, she needed time to focus on herself, it\u2019s ducking tragic that she couldn\u2019t do that. A talented and kind hearted soul is lost one more time because of a lack of understanding and support \ud83d\ude14 \n\n\nAlso I\u2019m going to say what I said before, stop making this about just kpop and 2019. SK has a huge suicide problem, it\u2019s not all roses like people assume it to be, just because we watch the dramas and listen to the music that shows only an idealised  view of everything. Furthermore Asia as a continent has an immense problem of never taking mental health seriously and if you look at the world over, people with mental health issues are treated dismissively and like a joke. \n\nIf you can, please try to bring about positive change in your own countries, like supporting mental health causes and politicians who want to bring about good change and support. \n\nRIP Hara, I hope your next life one is full of love, joy and a peaceful mind.",

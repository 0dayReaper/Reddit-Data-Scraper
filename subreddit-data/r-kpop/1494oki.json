            "comment": "It would have been fairly cool, if it happened, but I don't understand how she'd have the time and why her fans would support it. They complain non-stop about her being overworked because she is promoting The Idol, went to Caan and so on. But this would be yet another TV show, one in which she would be in much more I'd imagine than 'The Idol' and the workload would have much more physicality. \n\nWith it being the MCU, the Marvel contract would be for multiple seasons and movie options she has to sign on for and YG/TBL would either have to schedule projects (like comebacks) around her future MCU shooting and promotion schedule or not and risk her being recast for season 2 or 3 or in a movie and losing the gig to another actress. With how specifically timed the Kpop schedules seem to be, and how a TV season can get delayed for all sorts of reasons, I just don't see how she has the flexibility in her schedule to join an MCU project unless it was a one off and her character say died or transformed into a different looking person (so they could recast).",

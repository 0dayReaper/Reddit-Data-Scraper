I don\u2019t want to like shove meaning into things that aren\u2019t there, but the whole song and video seemed to be speaking about Mina to me, then I got to her lines and \ud83e\udd7a\n\nI know the shippers are enjoying being fed, but when I watched the Chaeng and Mina scenes it reminded me of Chaeyoung checking on Mina during her last concert, and how she handled everything with Mina gone. Ship or no ship there\u2019s so much love there.\n\nUrgh best comeback of all time",

This seems like such a personal song for them. Adversity brings people together, hell even my love for Twice has grown just watching them struggle with these things from afar. Can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s all been like for them. \n\nI\u2019m glad JYP sees the value in their wellbeing and being honest about it!",

I don't know why I just thought that was so beautiful.  It's like I know what the MV is trying to convey even before I read the lyrics video.  A feeling and scenic that are too familiar.  They have really gone through so much (hurtful comments and criticism, rumors etc) because they are such a high profile and popular group.   I hope the best of mental and physical health for them because I personally don't think I can do what they do (or any idol in general), and so I can completely relate and understood what Mina is going through.  Fighting! Another great comeback from Twice :)",

It had the classic Twice sound but also it felt more complex of a song. I\u2019m definitely gonna be listening to it again before I can form a really solid opinion about it. Also Sana is gorgeous with that pink hair, jeezus.\n\nEdit: so I wasn\u2019t hallucinating. The song is indeed sad and melancholy at certain parts. I actually read the lyrics this time around, which kinda confirmed this. I definitely do like this more mature direction Twice is going as a group!",

While Likey was about needing other peoples' validation on social media to feel good and beautiful (but deep down still not feeling good about it), Feel Special puts an emphasis on the power of peer support and camaraderie. Both songs show that everyone will feel down at times - and it's natural as human beings to feel melancholy. But with Feel Special, we hear an emphasis on our capacity to lift each other up and heal. It still has all the upbeat dance elements that we love in Twice's music, but it shows evolution in image and message.",

I hope everyone find their \"person/s\" to make us \"feel special\" when we think we aren't at times! FIGHTING!",

Visually this might actually be my favourite Twice MV ever.\n\nMusic-wise I really like this song. The beat / rhythm in the verses are very engaging. Pre-chorus is a pretty standard \"slow it down\" pre-chorus. Chorus is super fun as is expected with Twice, 2nd part of the chorus with the additional bass is a nice addition. Not as strong as the post-chorus of Fancy, but does it's job well here.\n\nMina's part in the 2nd verse might actually be my favourite part, the vocal melody + the way she sings quickly really creates a sense of urgency: \"As if everything has lost meaning - as if I have lost meaning\". The lyrics + her performance here creates a lasting impression. \n\nAll in all a strong comeback for Twice, with a special shoutout to the MV itself: The girls and sets all look gorgeous!",

Amazing job.\n\nChaeyoung \" There are one of those days, Days when i suddenly feel alone. When I feel like I don't belong anywhere.\" Jesus right through my heart.\n\nNayeon \"One moment I feel like I'm nothing at all, Like no one would notice I were gone.\" Actual tears.\n\nThen Mina's oof. This where hearts everywhere truly break. \"I just wanted to hide. Didn't wanna face the world. As if everything has lost meaning. As if I lost meaning.\"\n\nAlso Dubu's rap was the sickest she's ever spit, holy moly. Finally, the MV itself is actually high budget and looks so amazing throughout. Especially love the set with all the TVs in background of Jihyo. Just wow, SOTY easily.\n\nEdit: My god they actually catered to Michaeng and Saida shippers. lol That just elevated this to god tier.",

The girls look older, you look at them and think \"these are some hot young 20s aged girls out to enjoy life\" but their core personalities and attitudes never changed. It feels like they took their same concept from before but literally just aged it up, still looking very sporty, cute, sparkly, and energetic but now they're in hip clothes an IG influencer would wear instead of cheerleading uniforms.",

I really have to stop watching k-pop at 6 AM, since I can barely remember anything from that first viewing.\n\nSecond Viewing: \n\n* The visuals\n   * After I finally \"woke up\", I sat down and re-watched the mv on the best TV in the house (55\" Samsung Q8FN QLED) and it looks so much better than the Fancy MV. The static backgrounds really make the colors pop and you can appreciate more of the scene than the fake de-digitized filter that was used for Fancy. Find the best screen you can and watch this MV on it, even if you are that person at the local Best Buy.\n   * All the members look fantastic. Things that stand out are:  Jihyo in that black outfit during her solo choreography with the screens behind her (a reaffirmation that yes, she's still my bias), Jeongyeon in that dress before it cuts to her being solo (wow, she has great legs), Mina in the forest, Sana and Dahyun in the rain, Momo looking into the house with Tzuyu in it, the MiChaeng moment. \n* The actual song\n   * Now here is where I get kind of conflicted. I think the song has no buildup. Three lines in and we're already going straight in to the pre-chorus. With this being a \"house\" genre type of song, there's got to be more build up than this. Now I can say that I am use to a longer instrumental buildup due to listening to more traditional house tracks these days, so I can see how that can skew my view on these things. \n   * I also would say even though this song clocks in at 3:27 (MV is 3:45), the song feels really rushed. It took me three listens to finally get the tempo of the song down for myself. I hope that they have either a 5 min or 6 min extended cut of the song that they can use in the inevitable repackage. Throw in some few remixes while we are at it (a uk garage remix would sound fantastic). \n\nEven with those minor details, it's still a solid song. I really like the direction that they are taking Twice from the bubblegum sound that some would argue \"plagues the genre\" to a more mature sound with their own twist to it.  I'd give this a B+ out of 5 freed foreheads.",

            "comment": "This is a great maturation of their style, it still has those upbeat poppy elements, but there's this undercurrent of melancholy too. This might be their darkest song yet, even more so than Fancy. Like it's not super dark but there's something cold there in the instrumental. Their expressions and acting in this also give me that feel. \n\nI'm liking this kinda Eurodance rhythm/beat. They're really letting Tzuyu and Mina shine in the first and second verses. Trap rap breakdown, well, they seem to like it in K-pop. \n\nThis is fantastic. It's so compelling, emotional and catchy. This is the evolution I wanted. Amazing. I knew this composing team wouldn't let me down. I give this nine and a half heavy earrings out of ten empty jewelry stores.",

I'm so glad that Twice made a song like this, especially after Mina's mental health issues. I rarely fall in love with a song at first listen, but Feel Special is amazing on so many different levels. I went to Spotify and saved the song right after watching the MV. Twice and kpop has been an outlet for me and a way to forget about things going on with me, and seeing the girls cover a topic like this leaves me speechless. Feel Special SOTY!",

I love that they didn't go for the no singing chorus but the chorus itself just didn't go anywhere for me. I also thought it was odd giving Dahyun the rap, especially if that's the flow they were going for with the trap beat, didn't seem to fit (unlike the rap in Likey). Thought there's be a dancebreak. \n\nPretty sure I will end up liking it though, feel like the first few listens always hard as you already make expectations on what you'd want to it to sound like and if it doesn't sound exactly like that it's always slightly disappointing. Took me a few listens to get into Fancy after listening to all those teaser mashups\n\nLooking forward to the b sides as well.\n\nEdit: It's defo growing on me more - the choreo towards the end looks pretty awesome as well",

What a sweet song &amp; video &lt;3 I kept it together until Mina's verse, but then I couldn't help the tears actually falling. I was so moved to see her not only in the comeback, but showcasing her beautiful voice and heart with such a sweet, honest, relatable verse that's true to what she's been through and true to what so many fans feel in life, too.\n\nI love the heartfelt &amp; vulnerable lyrics, but I think I love even more seeing them sort of rescue each other and help each other feel special in the video. To see them literally reaching out to each other and lighting up when they see each other? Precious. What a lovely concept.\n\nIt's hard not to just focus on the emotional message, but music-wise, I am SO happy with the distribution of parts! Sana got to do part of the chorus!!! I've been complaining about how she deserves more vocal moments in recent comebacks, so that was a delight. Mina's verse was fitting &amp; perfect. Dahyun's rap was great. Tzuyu had a nice part. Everyone truly got her moment to shine!\n\nThis is a truly special moment for TWICE &amp; ONCE &lt;3",

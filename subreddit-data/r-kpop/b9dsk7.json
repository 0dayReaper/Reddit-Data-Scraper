As you can guess, cleaning up posts from our end was very challenging when everyone was fighting to be first.\n\nThe use of Premiere links was brought up in our [December 2018 Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/a23l6m/town_hall_december_2018/)\n\nOP was the first to correctly post the video after the hour. We have not banned using Youtube Premiere links. As long as the video works at the time of posting, we will take it. Thank you for your patience.",

The ending feels abrupt but there's so little substance to the chorus idk if tacking another on would actually help, although I think it would have been a great bridge. \n\nI LOVE rose's 1st prechorus.  I like lisa and jennie going back and forth.  jisoo is officially a sun goddess.",

I kinda felt similarly about DDDD as Kill This Love. They don't go hard enough to justify just having the drop. At least DDDD's final drop really feels like a climax of some sort, the outro they do in this song builds up but doesn't really go anywhere.\n\n",

I feel like 80% of kpop songs now lack a chorus.\n\nI'm not sure if I missed it, but I'd love a discussion thread about songs with \"lack of chorus\".

Dance has always had buildups, this was just the evolution where the big EDM DJs had these sections where the main hook of the song is a huge beat and instrumental riff, after or replacing a traditional chorus, and a section where the crowd can go mad for 30 seconds. You've had 50/60 years where your chorus is the main grab of the song, this is a new weapon so probably why it's being exploited a lot. \n\nPop has just absorbed this trend, along with things like vocal chop and trap beats. I don't think it'll vanish entirely, just might go out of vogue as fashions change, just like you'll rarely hear dubstep bass these days. ",

The verses builds up to a drop, but the the drop itself is lacking. The \u201cram pam pam\u201d part is rather uninspired. The English lyrics are fine, though I\u2019d rather have korean lyrics there. I really like the first Jennie, Jisoo and Rose verses. Lisa\u2019s verse doesn\u2019t so much for me. The best part is the pre-chorus without doubt, beautiful melody and rhythm there. The last bridge is fine though I\u2019m not fond of the repetitive English lyrics there. Also would have been nice with an ending chorus, though the trend recently seems to be to not have one.\n\nAll in all I think it\u2019s pretty good, though it doesn\u2019t reach DDDD\u2019s level due to the chorus and ending bridge.",

They have some decent songs and I really like the members, they all seem like nice and talented girls, but half the reason they've even gotten this far is because they're from one of the big 3. There are many girl groups out there making much better music than them but YG just seems content with letting them stagnate and then throwing them the occasional mediocre comeback once a year. These girls *are* decently talented and clearly like working but their management is just so awful that they aren't given anything good to work with. Shitty choreographers and the same producers and lyricists so that all of their songs end up sounding and looking exactly the same. I feel like they would've done so much better under almost any other company at this point. ",

I know this sounds so whiny but it's so tiring to have all of these lackluster songs with lackluster dances in gorgeous well-produced packages when they are obviously capable of so much more.

Whereas Red Velvet separates their Red and Velvet sides, it's like there is a company line for YG/BlackPink to merge both into one song. It works sometimes, but it can also sound like the Black and Pink sections are created separately and then just mashed together.  \nThere's nothing wrong with the idea, but the execution this time leaves something to be desired.",

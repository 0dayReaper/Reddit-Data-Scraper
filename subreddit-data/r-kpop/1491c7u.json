But in kpop it's (or was?) more common to have pre-releases one or two weeks before the album, for example Nmixx (Young Dumb Stupid on the 12th of March and Love Me Like This on the 20th), Ive (Kitsch on March 27th and I Am on April 10th), Jimin (SMF pt2 on the 17th of March and Like Crazy on the 24th)... SM seems the only one to do pre-releases one month before the album.",

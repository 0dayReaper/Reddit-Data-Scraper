It stars Jean Reno and Gary Oldman, and features the motion picture debut of Natalie Portman. In the film, L\u00e9on (Reno), a professional hitman, reluctantly takes in 12-year-old Mathilda (Portman), after her family is murdered by corrupt Drug Enforcement Administration agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). L\u00e9on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and learns the hitman's trade.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/kpop/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

[I'm still mostly like this](https://i.imgur.com/oD3vWAK.jpg) though. Only found Blackpink like the day before yesterday.\n\nI knew I was in too deep when I was able to recognise each of the members by voice. [Here's my Twice playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2hlQkVJZhE&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLnZ2vifj2JCLYkjT-umEkyn1HE3kVQF8O&amp;t=0s) and my [Blackpink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amq-qlqbjYA&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLnZ2vifj2JCKe0dHiDwjQJ1l7OI9qysG2)\n\nIf you want to get into it, I'd recommend just watching those, and try to listen to a full song before deciding if you like it. Some of them have weak starts (Like Boombahyah, but I really liked it by the end)\n\nI admit I'm mostly in it for the videos. I like the song but sometimes a good video wins me over even if the song is only okay.\n\nThe most surprising thing about the community for me (Coming from anime) is how the \"Bias\" is really respected as opposed to \"Best Girl\" which is hotly debated.",

Their songs \u201cLikey\u201d and \u201cTT\u201d are my favorite. \n\nFor guy groups check out BTS, Winner, Big Bang. They\u2019re all great. For other girl groups check out BlackPink (they\u2019re my favorite) and Red Velvet. Or you could try the coed group KARD. \n\nThere is a lot of KPop out there and they\u2019re all different styles. You gotta find what kind of stuff you like. Twice tends to be a little more juvenile, where as a group like AOA is a bit more mature. \n\nKPop is also not just about the music, but it\u2019s about \u201cidol culture\u201d. You come to love the idols and follow their lives on social media. They stream themselves live on an app called VLive, and they also appear on fun Korean variety shows all the time (that exist solely for KPop groups). For variety shows check out \u201cWeekly Idol\u201d and \u201cKnowing Brothers\u201d.\n\nLemme know if you have any questions! ",

Either way I'm a happy stan.\n\nAlso, how does Mina always manage to have such brilliant parts?\n\nI should just make these bullet points. I'm not really a fan of musical breaks in MV's and I don't think this one is done particularly well.",

Right now there are several parts of the song that just won't get out of my head.\n\n**TL;DR thoughts:**  The lyrics are solid and I imagine very relatable to many of the listeners.  The MV is great, maybe even competitive for MVOTY.  I love the gay shipping but the lack of Saida (Sana + Dahyun) pains me.  The song doesn't pull anything crazy except during the weird but good chorus which is disappointing because kpop tends to thrive on songs that try fun stuff.  I'm disappointed by the \"trap\" elements.  Where is the JYP whisper?  Most of the acting is great (RIP Tzuyu though).  Jihyo's Love Letter scene and Dahyun's rap scene are both very addictive both visually and vocally.  Momo isn't autotuned to hell!",

            "comment": "*Disclaimer: my favorite Twice songs have been Oh Ah, TT, Likey, Heart Shaker - which explains how why I feel the way I do about this track*\n\nSo upon the second listening I'm going to say this is a certified bop that is reminiscent of Heart Shaker (a milder formula of the classic Twice song structure that is less meme, more mastery of the form, and seems to be constructed in the same key as Heart Shaker as well), and I think it's a perfect song in their discography to follow up Likey and Heart Shaker, considering the direction that JYPE has been taking their music lately - as in it suits my taste by pulling away from being TOO too safe and memey (Knock Knock) and from being experimental and memey (Signal). It isn't their best, but I'd put it up there as a favorite.\n\n**LINE DISTRIBUTION:**\nOn the classic song structure/line distribution (http://i.imgur.com/ZzaLWOs.png) we still have Nayeon that starts, but the verse and chorus have completely switched to give the other girls some space in the song. I'm particularly happy to see Sana and Tzuyu take a lot of the chorus - their voices are softer and set a gentle cuteness for the song over Jihyo's relatively more bouncy/powerful/unique vocal over the rest of the girls. Tzuyu has definitely come a long way since the days of Sixteen, and I really have grown to like her voice. I think she has the most potential out of the non vocalists (over Dahyun, Chae, Momo, Sana and Mina). Of course we have the classic Dahyun and Chae rap verse, but the rap has been moved around (2:07). It's another boring cringe rap verse; I honestly think Chae deserves better things that designated shared rapper with Dahyun, who apparently has some musical talents that I never thought she had before (her VLives show her perfect pitch and piano abilities). I'd like to hear a non rap break Twice song that ISN'T Signal that features more singing for the two, but I am glad both got a bigger singing feature. Dahyun and Mina's voice fit together really well (higher pitched, weaker voices). I think it is interesting to see Jihyo sing the bridge the second time again (ala Likey), but this also meant she got less parts which makes me, a Jihyo Stan, sad. It's interesting they put the two main vocalist and stuffed their parts in the bridge. 3:10 is Jihyo's adlib that's been autotuned to hell and I'm not that happy about the boring adlibs Twice has delivered again - I definitely think their debut track has probably served the best adlibs to date. Also a pleasant surprise is the choice for the producers to not autotune the hell to Momo's infamous two liner in this track (1:20) - she sounds better than she ever has before and I'm glad they didn't make her sing talk again. I think if any producer is going to shake up that line distribution it'd be JYP, who did the same in Signal. Overall, the girls are not really vocalists, but as the song was pitched to fit the group better than Cheer Up, for example, I'm happy with their performance.\n\n**PRODUCTION:**\nI think it's interesting that this is produced by JYP considering it misses the weirdness of his music and feels like...any one else could have produced it (but definitely a Korean producer and not European ala SM songs). It almost feels like a Black Eyed Pilseung track in many beats. It does include a musical break which JYP seems to really like, and thank god, no signature JYP whisper.\n\nI do have to note that JYP seems to be really into 8-bit/video game noises. This track has a lot of retro video game noises (prominent from 0:28-0:38) that remind me of the funk bouncy bass and beat from Signal. I think it might be a callback from \"retro\" which JYP is obsessed with (think: Nobody from Wonder Girls). Twice usually has some fun in their songs, and this track kind of lacks that and tries to make it up with glitzy sound effects in the back. The hook is fine, it's good, it serves its purpose.\n\n1:34 and 1:40 feature an airhorn sound that EXID tried to incorporate in L.I.E. (https://youtu.be/RnDSODY7bVE?t=1m29s) but could not mix in properly. This time, in What is Love, the airhorn serves an actual purpose in ramping up the listener for the faster beat of the chorus and adds more dimension the that section of the song, which would have honestly been quite flat without the heavy production (unfortunately, the downside of a chorus carried by Tzuyu and Sana's weaker voices are not as dynamic as, say, Jihyo's or even Nayeon's voice). It's not bad and as I said, serves the song quite well - you hear notes of it even before Dahyun/Chae's rap break and all throughout. A unique choice for the video game theme they have gone for though - I might have preferred a different effect, but it does go along with the squishiness of their bassline. It seems like JYP has added in these trap elements since Likey, which makes me feel neutral. I guess it gives a group like Twice some type of edge.\n\nI'm really digging the synth notes that start the song and persist through the track and the percussion in the track. I think these two elements are the things that really pace the song properly as a less intense yet still melodically sweet song. I also love the squishy/bouncy bass line that begins in the second verse at 1:14. The melody actually feels like a callback to Knock Knock, which in my opinion, takes the nicest part of that track (KK) and gives it a little more flair (that track was quite bland to me and felt like filler discography).\n\n**LYRICS:**\nI mean I don't speak korean, so going off their translations on the video, I quite like it. It's still centered around love but at least it's not about a guy but more introspective this time around. It's fine, it's cute.\n\n**SUMMARY:**\nIt's a safe and certified bop that follows the path of Likey and Heartshaker. As a Twice stan I'm satisfied because it's what I expect of the group and doesn't deviate too much from what's made them famous, masters the classic Twice formula and changes it up ever so slightly; isn't overly annoying but still catchy. On musical quality, I'd say it's one of their top main singles. If I were to compare it to other Kpop songs released now, it's a quite an average track.\n\nI do still wish that Twice releases another musically darker song in minor like TT and Ooh Ahh instead of recycling the same song thematic notes they have been recently. One of the things that made me like this song more was the fact that the ending of the chorus seems to be in minor.\n\nI'd give this song a Twice 4/5 stars, but compared to music overall, a 3/5 stars.",

Twice 3.0 kicks some serious ass!\n\nThere's a reason why Lee Woo Min (collapsedone) is my favorite Twice producer - yes, with BEP being a very close second - and this track shows exactly why. He and Justin Reinstein, along with their co-producers/songwriters did an amazing job here. No hyperbole needed, it's the damn truth!\n\nI also love how the M/V added a credits &amp; outtakes trailer at the end (a la 'Like Ooh-Ahh') with the 6th Anniversary/3rd Full Album/4th \\[World?\\] Tour announcement. For anyone anxious about contract renewals, I think we can take this as a sign that Twice aren't anywhere close to being done.\n\np.s. the announcement is on the poster at timestamp [3:25](https://youtu.be/f5_wn8mexmM?t=205)\n\nEdit: the instrumental is FIRE! - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da9tihVXF7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da9tihVXF7A)",

And the lyrics MAKE SENSE!?!? This really reminds me of old TWICE with a modern twist.\n\nMore than anything, I love how they took the English song \u201ctrend\u201d and made something that still feels like THEM. It has so many components of a classic TWICE song and still maintains that K-Pop flair despite being in English and likely being aimed more towards the west. THAT\u2019s what I\u2019ve been wanting from groups releasing English versions. \n\n( P.S. It seems they may have fit Jeongyeon in more last minute maybe? I feel like it was supposed to be OT8 originally, especially with most of the dance scenes. )\n\nEdit : Chaeyoung saying \u201cI wanna be your boo\u201d made me chuckle, lol.",

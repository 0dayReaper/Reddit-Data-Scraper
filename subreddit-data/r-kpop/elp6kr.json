I'm pretty sure with a criminal record the stalker has completely waived that and won't be welcome in Korea again for a few years. \n\nSource: English Teacher",

Now the worst thing that can happen to a stalker is publicity because if you are public knowledge it becomes harder to take action as a stalker. There are probably a hundreds of guys like him in korea but they are completely unknown and the only reason why we are so informed about him is because he is so transparent and that is a GOOD thing because the most dangerous stalkers are the ones we don't know about. That is why people would actually enable his stalking by ignoring him way more than any clout could enable him in my opinion because it is very very dangerous to allow him to slip under the radar by pretending he doesn't exist and that he will stop if he is sufficiently ignored",

If you have a job/family/money the chances are a better that you could end with a probation or that you can leave the jail for you job, you need only to sleep overnight there as when you have no fixed address and are jobless. \n\nThe court could even order a medical expertise, if the found out he is criminally insane he would end in a psychiatric hospital for very long time.",

Saesang fans do this kind of shit all the time yet you don\u2019t really hear about the repercussions they do or don\u2019t receive. This on the other hand, being that of a much higher profile due to the stalker being a foreigner, may result in eventual deportation and a travel ban into South Korea. It was a large risk JYPE took that ultimately paid off in the best possible scenario.\n\nProps to JYPE for equipping TWICE with smart watches to track their movement while the entire thing was happening. It\u2019s taken a long time, and the process of the ending to this fiasco is now beginning. But on the split side, I pity the guy. I hope he gets the help he needs and that his actions don\u2019t paint an even worse perception people have of Germans. They\u2019re trying to move on from their mistakes and show they\u2019re a better people.",

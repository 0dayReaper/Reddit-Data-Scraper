Like music is subjective, so yall can support it and I won't judge, but like idk why this part of the song and bounce part triggers me?\n\nMaybe if I keep listening to it, I'll get conditioned to it like sticker did for me.",

Personally i dont have any problem with any of the song, it's such a vibe and I actually find it so refreshing to not hear any high pitch singing for the entire song. It's a great breather in between other songs on my playlist.",

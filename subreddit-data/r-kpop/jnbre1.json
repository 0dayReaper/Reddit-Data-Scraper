You could do a nice aesthetic album like almost every k-pop group does, or you could make an ugly little plastic case with (at best) a tiny photobook insert. They crack all the time in the mail if they're not swaddled in bubble wrap, and even when they're safely in your hands it's easy for the case to crack, especially when opening/closing or when taking out your cd. And it just looks cheap and janky. They're literally just the worst. I would rather have a super basic cardboard sleeve than a jewel case. \ud83d\ude24",

Companies can get creative with cardboard boxes and make different shapes and cut holes in them wheres a CD case just looks kinda boring in my opinion.\nI know the packaging is there to protect the CD but with kpop, the boxes have been used so much, that they just kinda became the standard packaging. So when you suddenly get a jewel case, it just seems like a downgrade \n\nAlso, jewel cases often cost just as much as \"normal\" albums.",

There's no one for people to directly compare them to, because they're their own \"people.\"\n\nFor aespa, what if people prefer the avatar? Will people be creepy with the avatar and could that extend to the person? (Yes). The list goes on. I think at a conceptual level it's kinda cool but SM did not think enough about how crazy some kpop fans can get. Creating an idealized, digital verizon of your idols that will allegedly be able to chat with fans will just add so much fuel to the fire of fan creepiness/possessiveness/etc. but this involves real-world counterparts that have to endure that.",

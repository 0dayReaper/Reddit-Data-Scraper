I also need to know why the baguette was so important. The car being destroyed is one thing, but a baguette solo shot? The theatrics of it all. The most sane thing was the movie date and I'm not even lying, lol. It was the only thing I wasn't confused about.\n\nClearly, I am not the one to see for MV theories, lmao, but it was a very visually appealing MV regardless. The song is also lovely on the ears.",

Like he's still filling the exact same niche in the group he has had since the very beginning. I get that the group probably doesn't need much more from him but it is still concerning more than a decade later. There was a moment in the chorus where he was beginning to mouth something and I actually thought they were going to have him sing a line but it ended up being bait.",

He's a great dancer, too - though this MV doesn't feature it. \n\nIn a vocal heavy group like EXO, it's not like he's gonna get high note priority over the most stacked vocal line in the genre lol. They need his lower timbre to fill out some harmonies or double up lines but he mainly fills the rapping void with Chanyeol. \n\nFor what it's worth, Sehun does sing *quite* a bit more on the EXO-SC stuff.",

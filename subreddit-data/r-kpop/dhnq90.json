Idols has mention in talk show about how these kind of comment effecting them and their family. When i tell haters about these thing, they were like \"there nothing wrong about what i said\" or \"i am free to express myself\" or \"these is FACT\". \n\nEdit: I remember about something.

The fact that it made it through the editing room showed that the editors didn't know what it meant either. In addition to that, she also got a lot of hate for dating Choiza.\n\nIt seemed like any time I saw Sulli's name after that Running Man incident, it was because she was being criticized.",

Amber caught my eye but I always thought Sulli was the prettiest and I could relate to her thanks to her age. As her career went on I always thought she had strength in what she did, you knew that she had her own individuality and that if it meant ruffling a few feathers, then so be it. The amount of hate she got was relentless and her persona of being too sexual or being called a Fox was just too over the top. I am sure she was numb to all the comments but deep down I think she wanted to be seen as a human too. As someone also suffering from severe depression, jonghyuns death hurt me deeply. So for Sulli to go, this one hurts just as much. I am so sorry you felt alone in this world. From one lonely person to another, I hope you find peace. Rest In Peace beautiful. You left an impact on this world even if at the time you may have not felt that way. You did well.\n\nEdited: as someone pointed out my song error. Obviously still in shock but thanks for correcting me lol",

I had seen her in to the beautiful you, and listened to f(x) casually. So unable to contain my excitement, I look into the movie reviews and man, was that the most terrible decision I ever made. \n\nThe initial reviews were rife with hate comments, both from males and females. The female hate comments, which were rabid fans of KSH I think, were just issuing profanities simply because she did a nude scene. Like dafuq! They were like how dare you do a nude scene with my oppa (they implied indirectly). All these nonsensical comments were getting +1k upvotes. One comment I still remember said something along the lines of, we all know that nude scene was just compensation for your terrible acting, and that comment also had +1k upvotes and around 600 downvotes. \n\nThat wasn't the worst. I thought the male fans would retaliate and balance the hatred but no, one highly upvoted comment said something like sulli, you disappointed us so much; you should have left at least something for imagination. \n\nI was completely traumatized reading the comments. I who was a nobody got so traumatized that I never checked out the movie again. I became so disillusioned that I couldn't follow KSH's projects anymore. \n\nI know this is just one small instance. There were perhaps worse. I couldn't even imagine the pain she must have undergone.\n\nThis year I followed sulli a lot! When I saw her on the variety show at jtbc reading hate comments, I was so impressed. She seemed so confident in herself. \n\nGoodbye sulli! The world simply didn't deserve you. I hope you will be at a happy place. \n\nP.s. don't mind me. This is just me pouring out my shock and grief at the news.",

I have been in a very dark place recently and have been suffering so much to the point where I re-started thinking of commiting suicide. It had happened before and whenever I watched dramas or movies and when scenes of characters commiting suicide came I was always wondering why we don't have any pole on the ceilings that seem adequate to hang myself If I want to but then last night I found this metal pole in the shower booth and tried hanging a towel to see if I could actually do it. My parents are nice people but my dad was very abusive throughout my childhood and my mom was never around to make a living and get her master's degree for promotion (she was the breadwinner.) I had no one who could protect me  from my dad's abuses and no one really knew exactly what happened so I am not close to my family. \n\nThe guy I used to kind of date for the last three years and claimed himself my family turned out to be a jerk who shittalked and lied about me to the girl I used to be close to and he used to have a crush on (it was a pure lust as he said). He turned out to be a guy who just collected women and made them get confused about his feelings while making them think like they are super special to him. The point when I started to fall for him was when he was so worried about me going to a different big city for house views where I need to ride a ferry to get to alone and suggested to come with me first (that was when I was an international student in the country where he lives and that was like a few weeks after we just met.) Ever since that we became so close and he was just like my family and he was the guy who I first talked to when I was diagnosed glaucoma and he was the person who said he would give me his one eye if I go blind.. I just cannot believe how he has changed (or revealed the true colour) over the years and I am suffering so much when he already moved on.. I came back to Korea working and studying English for getting PR and I got this weird disease after two years of working when I was so close to three years of working experience that would give me the full score on overseas working experience point category. I needed that full score to get invitation because I have no college degree from one of the universities in that country and thus do not have a workpermit. I never meant to quit before 3yrs but I just had to due to the sickness and when I said I might have to quit he literally called me fucking depressed idiot who made stupid decision. He thought I would heal within one month and can just take a sick leave and I said I cannot due to some circumstances at work and he just did not listen and hung up. \n\nHe litetally left me when I was going through the resignation and all the painful therapies. That was over 7 months ago and I am still healing not being able to work. I recently found out when I was going through resignation and the therapies he reached out to this girl once I was close to and shittalked me so much... never mentioned I was sick and had to quit my job but said how crazy person I am.  He never apologized for what he did when I asked for explanation. \n\nAnd the worst part is I hate myself so bad for still being hung up on this horrible human being... I always thought he was such a nice selfless person given how he took care of me so much then now I am really confused that if people can just \"act nice\" even to the point where it seems impossible to do so unless it is genuine and from bottom of their heart. \n\nGuys, I know I babbled a lot but I would appreciate some support desperately. \nThank you..\nAnd please excuse me for any mistakes in my words. It is not my first language.",

I'm sorry if this post is messy.\n\nF(x) was one of my first kpop groups, and I was saddened when I first heard news about her leaving the group way back when. It was so easy to judge back then, not knowing the full story, hearing controversies, but I wanted to support her on her solo endeavours anyway. As the years passed and more of her story and her struggles came to light, I understood why she stepped away, why her actions seemed so strange to the outside world, and why she needed support more than ever. Sadly, it's hard to show that in a respectful and useful way as a fan.\n\nGoblin made me cry. Hard. I do not relate to having DID, but as someone with a host of other mental issues, that feeling of isolation and self-hatred is well-known to me. The song hit close to home. I had hoped the song's release was a sign she was getting better, was on a track towards better management and better health. I know DID isn't something that just goes away, but I hoped that she would find contentment somehow, and find a way to continue being the creative, wonderful person she was.\n\nThis is not how anyone wanted her to find that contentment, but... I know that she will be at peace now. \n\n\uc124\ub9ac, \uc218\uace0\ud558\uc154\uc11c \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.",

            "comment": "sulli was and will always be my only female muse. i love her a lot and she holds a special place in my heart, i kinda grew up with her group's music. as in, i saw her grow up over the years, to the beautiful you was my favorite kdrama at the time it was airing, she was my bias in f(fx). she was like my baby girl, despite her being two years older than me. been with f(x) since 2009 and i can't believe it's been a whole ten years. i actively check her instagram, you know? and it might sounds creepy, but i have all her ig pictures in a folder. she was really my muse, i love her a lot. i loved writing her.  and i don't really write female muses at all but she was an exception. she was so lovely, i feel like i lost a loved one? i already know what it's like losing a loved one. but losing a muse, i mean. this is  the first time i ever felt something like this. like, she was someone i really adored. i looked up to. she was my baby girl and i already miss her, so so much. a lot of things are running in my head right now.  how does amber feel? how does jieun feel? the rest of her former bandmates? fuck, dude. her parents? her fucking parents. the cat she left behind. she must have been in some really, really excruciating pain to choose this route.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand it's kinda devastating. no, it's sick in a way, because as a suicidal person myself, or just someone going through their lowest of lows right now and contemplating it (again, after many attempts of it)  bc of depression and the recent loss of income and the pain of a heartbreak, the loss of someone important to you and then i see this. you see news like this, you think of jonghyun, i think of etika and here we have the latest victim, sulli. i knew she was always like, really sad. and lonely and being lonely makes you depressed, if you're alone with your head all the time. i mean, you know. there's this quote, \"what's the difference between a gun and a thought.\" a gun gives you the opportunity but a thought pulls the trigger.  \n\n\ncan't really type this out without crying. i know, i know how hard it is and i know she's done her best. she's always been doing her best and i love her so much, so so much. beyond words can even manage. is it confirmed it's suicide? the only thing i can wish for her is that she's resting in peace. but i miss her, i already miss her and this is really hard for me to take. i know i'm not the only one, she has a lot of fans. but right now, it hurts. it hurts for me. i know it hurts, for everyone else, too. if anyone loves sulli as much as i do. you can pm me, i'm here to listen. this is never easy, losing someone is never easy.",

This is so hard, the article thumb pic didn't show her eyes so I still had hope it wasn't her, but when i read it my Heart sank. I can't believe it. \n\nI seems to be a suicide so I guess it's even tougher because now fans, friends and family will look for signs... \n\nSulli was a great person, artist and star. If she decided to end her life, if there's a heaven, I hope she's there. \n\nMay she rest in peace and be remembered lovingly. \n\nEnglish is my 2nd language and I'm clearly shaken so forgive any errors",

You're in your mid to late twenties and you've already achieved your sole life goal of being a famous idol, a goal that has taken a superhuman amount of time and effort on your part to achieve. But you're only getting older, and the public is moving on to the next big shiny thing, and every year people are talking about you less and less. So what now? People need long term goals in order to have a purpose in life. \n\nAnd of course if you are having psychological troubles, you basically have to hide it, because the idol image is all about health and youthful beauty, and there's no room for your real life struggles in the marketing. And there's thousands of jealous netizens out there who will be sure to leave hateful comments on anything you post, especially if you've already given the appearance of \"weakness\" or nonconformity.\n\nRIP Sulli, I'm just...really sorry.",

It\u2019s now 7 at night and I\u2019m still in shock from the news. \n\nSulli was such a sweet soul with the brightest smile and laugh, it was contagious. I remember being introduced to f(x) for the first time and being captivated by her cute smile. All the bullshit she went through all of the years...she never deserved any of that. Was she a perfect person? No? But she never hurt anyone.  When I saw her come back with \u201cGoblin\u201d and appear on variety shows I was so happy. She seemed to be doing well despite all the crap in the past. I fell in love with her again when I watched her variety show and saw her short cameo in Hotel Del Luna. She was such a strong, fiercely outspoken and brave soul. I just can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone.\n\nI don\u2019t know her personally, but seeing her be strong despite all the hate and her \u201cidgaf\u201d attitude was such a motivation for me. I\u2019ve struggled with depression for years and almost took my life on several occasions...and this just hits so hard. I\u2019m at a loss for words. Having watched her grow up and being a fan...I feel like I lost a friend. I\u2019m sorry the world was so cruel to you. \n\n\u201cMy name is Sulli. Sul means snow and Li means a pear flower, so I\u2019ll probably be reborn as a flower that is small but full of strong vitality.\u201d You\u2019ll be reborn as as the most beautiful and strong flower Sulli. Thank you  for everything and rest in the sweetest peace Choi Jin-ri.",

I\u2019m a long time stan of f(x) and kept up with Sulli after she left because she was unafraid of being herself and stood for justice. She even inspired me to be less worrisome of my body, and how I engage with others. So it was unbelievable to me that someone I viewed as so strong would take her own life. I wish I could have done something to let her know that she\u2019s loved, but I also understand that demons are hard to fight off. I hope she\u2019s resting easy.",

Your smile is something I will always remember.\n\nThis is not an SM thing or SM's fault...the fact that I even saw a person here and people on twitter saying that....wtf man. It is a cultural issue that needs to be re-evaluated and reworked. Mental health in Korea is not treated properly. Seasonal changes to colder weather especially make those with depression feel even worse. Sulli is not the first Korean celebrity suicide this year, but her name draws a bigger spotlight on a very real issue. There's nothing on this planet to eradicate suicide, but I wish more could be done to help. Especially those who have reached out for help.",

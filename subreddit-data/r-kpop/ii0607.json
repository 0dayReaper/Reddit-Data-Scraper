Sorry to sound critical but to collaborate with a western artist as famous as Selena Gomez means that they must have a good outcome (garnering more fans or otherwise) or do none at all. That's why artists collab, find they don't mesh well and don't collab in the end. \n\nThis move should have been well thought out and should have been strategic for further success (YGs aim) as western audiences with no experience will have been turned off by their first listen....\n\nSorry to sound negative and critical but I just want the best for the girls and feel they're being let down by their management (as is the case all the time) - I didn't even really get Lisa's rap (like the words had no meaning? Or maybe it's just me who didn't understand it?)",

Even if I did like the song, it would be one that would get old quick.\n\nA Blackpink and Selena collab could've been so good and I was excited to listen to this.

Collabs make sense in terms of Kpops globalized vibe it gives off (like using multiple languages) but I\u2019d much rather hear western artists just lend their vocals to tracks and that\u2019s it.

Something inspired. Something fresh. This is a step back. Sounds exactly like Birthday Cake by Rihanna with a little bit of WAP and 7 Rings sprinkled in. It feels like they're not really in the drivers seat, deciding the kind of music they want to put out and instead follow trends, stick their finger in the air and go where the wind takes them etc etc. Even for Selena this is a step back. As a part-time Blink, this disappoints me.",

At least BP\u2019s past songs like KTL and DDDD had energy and could be engaging to hear live. This would probably suck live, because it sucks as is.

Westerners that listen to kpop songs do so because they appreciate its uniqueness. If I wanted to hear some C-tier Ariana song I'd just turn on my radio. \n\nAnd God it's so uncomfortable seeing these girls who have to play the perfect goodie good girls then go around singing/\"\"\"rapping\"\"\"\" a stream of sexual innuendos while waving icecreams around suggestively. \n\nThis ain't it mate.",

Outside Fondazione Prada, the venue for the men\u2019s fall 2023 fashion show, crowds erupted as the seven members stepped out to greet fans, wearing head-to-toe Prada looks from the men\u2019s spring 2023 collection, which was heavy on denim sets and boxy blazers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe group, which boasts more than 12.5 million fans on Instagram alone, helped the Italian label secure $40.4 million in media impact value, according to tallies of January fashion weeks compiled by data firm Launchmetrics.\n\n*\u201dWe\u2019re delighted and honored to be a part of this partnership as new brand ambassadors of Prada. The synergy Prada and Enhypen will create is something we\u2019re very excited to witness and greatly looking forward to,\u201d* the boy band said in a statement.\n\nThe K-pop stars join other Prada ambassadors including Scarlett Johansson, Hunter Schafer, Letitia Wright, Amanda Gorman, Cai Xukun, Jaehyun and Louis Partridge, among other talents.\u201d",

All of those sponsored clothes for their airport outfits and photoshoots were a huge part of it, making sure that the group suited the brand's image. It paid off quite well, I believe! It also really helps that current Prada is co-designed by Raf Simmons, menswear and streetwear legend. Combining his designs with Miuccia Prada's more cerebral and darker aesthetic IMHO fits the members' youth and overall concept very much. Obligatory fuck BeLift, but Enhypen's stylists are really fucking good at their jobs.\n\nI'm not familiar with aespa's activities, but in BTS's case the only member that in my humble opinion really suited Louis Vuitton's image was j-hope (current LV brand ambassador in his solo career). The rest of the members kind of looked strange in LV's loud patterns and prints. Jin seemed more inclined towards Thom Browne's tailoring, Jimin with sleek, sexy suits from Dior, RM seemed to gravitate towards bohemian styles, etc. It was great publicity for both LV and it seemed pretty apt for Virgil Abloh (former LV creative director, RIP) to have signed them given their massive clout, but... yeah",

What I think matters much more is whether the artists have built a relationship with  the house and suit their image (which in this case *is* the case imo).",

Man, Seulgi will always be the coolest idol for me. She's capable of embodying literally everything from weird af, to cute and bubbly, to horror, to chic and sexy, to gritty tomboy, to girl next door. She seems like a really nice and genuine person, can dance a lot of styles really well, has an amazing unique voice... ugh I just want her to be my best friend =))\n\nReally looking forward to this release, esp since it looks like there's a storyline (not enough of those these days), we see her acting chops, and it just looks cool hands down. Gave me Last of Us AND Nanno vibes.",

            "comment": "**Title clarification:** Jin will be releasing a Single Album soon and conclude his schedules by the end of October. Enlistment procedures will follow that, but will probably take a little while. Actual enlistment will come later.\n\n***\n\n[**OP\u2019s English translation**](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/y643m6/bighit_music_has_officially_announced_that_bts/isnax3w/)\n\n[**@BIGHIT_MUSIC Statement** (text below)](https://twitter.com/bighit_music/status/1581905317545533440)\n\n([HYBE's 'Letter to Shareholders'](https://hybecorp.com/eng/ir/announce/content/2320) is also available)\n\nBIGHIT MUSIC is proud to announce today that the members of BTS are currently moving forward with plans to fulfill their military service. After the phenomenal concert to support Busan's bid for the World Expo 2030, and as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it's the perfect time and the members of BTS are honored to serve.\n\nSince the creation of BTS over ten years ago, the band has risen to international success, broken records, and catapulted K-Pop into the global stratosphere. BIGHIT MUSIC has focused to the milestone moment when it would be possible to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men to serve with their countrymen, and that's now. Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October. He will then follow the enlistment procedure of the Korean government. Other members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans.\nBoth the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment.\n\nWith the release of their first anthology album earlier this year it opened the path to allow the members to take some time to explore individual projects. As part of the HYBE family, we support and encourage our artists and are beyond proud that they will each now have time to explore their unique interests and do their duty by being of service to the country they call home.\n\n\"Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)\" is more than a track from their latest album, it is a promise, there's much more yet to come in the years ahead from BTS.",

I actually get the feeling ARMYs are about to head into the busiest era they've had in years. \n\nSeveral members have solo projects in the works, and given the level of production that RM, Yoongi, and Jhope have sustained there are likely hundreds of ready-made BTS songs just sitting in the vault. Two years is an incredibly short period of time when you have 7 individuals with troves of music ready to be released.",

Last I heard, the difficulty was because they didn\u2019t know if non-classical music accolades should be allowed, but those in the business sector have a very real chance of being exempted as well regardless of the exact business they participate in. I struggle to see the genuine thought process of allowing only some art but all business that doesn\u2019t lead to the conclusion of \u201cpoliticians and businessmen are a united front in capitalism\u201d. Because, really, what accolades are there to judge business by? I think really only a Grammy win in a major category would\u2019ve ever swayed BTS specifically into having the full exemption, except that the Grammys are struggling with the racist and sexist boys club (verbatim words of the former CEO Deborah Morgan shortly before they fired her) they\u2019ve created. The law in general seemed far fetched because BTS is really the only group that could bring up such a discussion right now. They\u2019re the undeniable #1 and the gap between them and everyone else is massive, trying to base a *law* specifically off of BTS is a ridiculous challenge. The conversation should\u2019ve just been whether only BTS would be special consideration or not. \n\nI just find it so crazy a group of people genuinely thought creating a law based off of 7 people would somehow work.",

Just seeing which course will get them the best public reception. \n\nThe previous government really tried pushing forward and coming to a conclusion but it didn't exactly work out and they passed the extention bill instead. Thought it will get them in the good graces of youth for coming election. Or expected that the BTS steam may die down before the end of 2 years and they'd not need to take a decision at all- which didn't happen. \n\nThe discussion heated up again just before the end of term for previous government but they couldn't really do anything concrete then. \n\nThe new government, to me, seemed to be playing the game of \"how far back will they (BTS/bighit) be willing to bend to get this/ how can we fully milk their economic potential while also come to some conclusion that can appease both sides of the aisle (one of the proposed compromise was to let them do public service for 3 years, instead of 1.5, during which they will be given provisions to do promotions and serve the military too. The catch, ofcourse is that they will not be seeing the money from that untill those 3 years are up, while still working 2 jobs)\n\nFrom what I've read, most young Koreans want the other exceptions to enlistment also to be removed but that is unlikely to happen anytime soon cuz the \"business\" exemptions are backed by people who sponser a lot of politicians- cuz obviously. The arts and sports ones are apparantly still a hot debate \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f though personally, I hate seeing the \"classical arts &gt; contemporary art forms\" mentality but the lack of concrete milestones for pop music really poses very tricky questions about what should be the level at which an exemption is warranted. Most awards BTS got while breaking boundaries now have an exclusive \"kpop\" category which multiple kpop acts are extremely likely to win in coming years. So they can't be the milestone. The ones BTS also didn't get can't obviously be one either. \n\nIt's all one big complicated mess.\n\nWhich is why I feel BTS doing this is so commendable. They didn't let themselves get dragged in this any further and decided to do away with all major uncertainty and just get it over with. They no longer need to be the face of a national debate.",

If we think about non kpop artists, 2 years is actually a short amount of time between albums. Take Harry Styles as example. *Fine Line* and *Harry's House* seem to me like they were released so close to each other and the first one was in 2019 and *Harry's House* was this year! It will go super fast, and if we take into account the solo releases, it will be even faster!\n\nI'm actually pretty satisfied with this, because I was really afraid they would take 5 years to be all together again, as somo were saying \ud83d\ude2d",

After the phenomenal concert to support Busan\u2019s bid for the World Expo 2030, and as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it\u2019s the perfect time and the members of BTS are honored to serve.\n\n&gt; Since the creation of BTS over ten years ago, the band has risen to international success, broken records, and catapulted K-Pop into the global stratosphere. BIGHIT MUSIC has focused to the milestone moment when it would be possible to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men to serve with their countrymen, and that\u2019s now. Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October. He will then follow the enlistment procedure of the Korean government. Other members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans. Both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment.\n\n&gt; With the release of their first anthology album earlier this year it opened the path to allow the members to take some time to explore individual projects. As part of the HYBE family, we support and encourage our artists and are beyond proud that they will each now have time to explore their unique interests and do their duty by being of service to the country they call home.\n\n&gt; \u201cYet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)\u201d is more than a track from their latest album, it is a promise, there\u2019s much more yet to come in the years ahead from BTS.\n\n(TLDR: Jin will initiate the process of enlistment as soon as his solo schedule at the end of October is done. BTS &amp; BigHit expect to be back as a group in 2025.)\n\nOh boy. **(okay, I might have made a teeny mistake jumping the gun, sorry, I'm not actually sure if it's the end of October, but it seems that at that time, Jin will be going through the process anyway(?) So close enough?)**\n\n&gt; BTS will begin enlisting starting with the oldest member, Jin.\n\n&gt; BigHit Music announced on the 17th, \"Our artist BTS has had specific preparations for their fulfillment of military service. Jin (real name Kim Seokjin) has cancelled his request to postpone his enlistment at the end of October, and is planned to follow the Military Manpower Administration's procedures regarding enlistment.\"\n\n&gt; \"Other members will enlist sequentially according to their individual plans. We will post notices about BTS members' activities and schedules in detail on our company homepage &amp; fandom platform Weverse.\"",

I think this was the best decision for them as individuals. My only worry is that celebrities in the military have had their privacy invaded and since BTS are so high profile I feel that could definitely happen again. I believe Taemin and G Dragon both experienced their privacy being invaded in horrific ways so I hope that the military can plan ahead for that.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a veteran ARMY at this point, but I am relieved with this news and looking forward to their solo works!",

Never seen this much stalling and vagueness for so long, been obsessing over their enlistment since 2017 (and BTS were so young then, so it was so weird people were holding this over their heads and were being asked questions about it all the time) and did tons of empty promises while milking dry their impact just to not even be able to officially give an answer for years. Absolute clownery. BTS deserved better treatment and I will always hold the opinion that SK takes them for granted.\n\nAnyways, one thing is for sure, if BTS is not getting any sort of alternative service or exemption, no other group/act ever is.",

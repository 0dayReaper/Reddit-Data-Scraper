I have the worldwide trends and for those you see the topic, of the trending hashtag.\n\nIf you want to have worldwide trends you need to click the gear, afterwards you should deselect \"Show content in your current location\" and \"Trends for you\", than click done and welcome in the worldwide trends.\n\nAlso there is this dumb thing, if you already have selected a country, than you have to go into \"settings and privacy\", than \"privacy and security\", here you deselct and then select again \"connect to Periscope\", than open the gear again, don\u2019t to anything and just hit done.\n\nWhy this is done so dumb? Because Twitter devs are idiots, who think no one should have worldwide trends and just use their super, new explore bullshit, but still can\u2018t stop people from using worldwide trends.\n\nJust never select a country.",

Those of us that were seeing it prior to that are grandfathered into the Worldwide view, but if you choose a different location, you won't be able to get it back.\n\nThe only fix I know of is that if you're able to load old versions of the Twitter app (jailbreaking on iPhone (*which you can do right now if you're on iOS 13.5 or below*) and I *assume* rooting on Android? I don't use the platform, so I don't know how easy it is to load old app versions). You just load that version up, and Worldwide should still be an available region. I don't remember the exact version where they discontinued it, but safe to say, several versions back.",

Gay rights, critical of sexism, agaisnt racism. My blog was like pretty much fandom meets 'SJW'. I deleted the blog because I was young and didn't want people making fake accounts to harass me anymore and didn't know what else to do. I went looking to see and found a post about me and a link to my blog and username I went by with comments from people saying they &gt;!wanted to rape me!&lt; and other stuff like that. The interactions I've had with it left me very put off by the whole website.\n\nIf reddit did that to me at that time, I probably would feel the same.

Thank you, K-pop fans on Twitter!\n\nTo everyone arguing that this just draws more attention to the toxic hashtag, I understand where you're coming from, but it's just a hashtag. A trending rank on Twitter doesn't somehow help the idea of white lives matter in real life. It amplifies the hashtag, sure, but even if that means more people click on it, they're still met with a wall of anti-racism that says thousands if not millions of people won't stand for this. It's a counter-protest and it amplifies that message of the counter-protest, including amplifying it among the racists that would otherwise occupy that hashtag.\n\nPlus, the hashtag existed anyway -- clearly, since the article notes that fans' efforts drowned out \"nearly all\" actual racist messages (not all, so, there were already racist messages there). So now when the racist people go to use that hashtag, their message is a mess and they can't so easily organize &amp; escalate each other. They also can't as easily attract new, especially younger, users to their cause -- because anyone curious is only going to find a bunch of K-pop videos and give up that search for the moment.\n\nBecause that's all this is -- a hashtag for white supremacists to lure fellow racists and share misinformation &amp; hate with each other. If that process gets interrupted, their voices get drowned out, like the headline notes.",

                    "comment": "I disagree. The Streisand Effect is about publicizing something that the general public wasn't aware existed. Pretty sure everyone knows about racism and white power at this point. If someone agrees with the racist hashtags, they were likely already racist or most of the way there. The beauty of this spam campaign is that it isn't about amplifying hateful messages; it is about calling out the racists and making it clear that these sort of messages are not tolerated anymore. This is about taking the safe spaces and platforms away from racists and using them to show support and give empowerment to the very people those hashtags are trying to silence. It is about co-opting the tools of hate and turning them into tools for good.\n\nOver the last decade or so, racism has thrived and grown and a big part of that is thanks to the internet. The internet has let people who may have felt isolated with their views find like-minded communities of people who share the same likes, dislikes, and views. In some cases, such as with K-pop, this has been a wondrous and diverse thing. But in the case of racism and white power, this has allowed people with hateful and destructive world-views to create echo chambers and recruiting pipelines where voices that object are drowned out and silenced. \n\nSimilar to how it may seem that K-pop is more mainstream than it actually is when most of what we consume online is k-pop related, racist voices think they are more accepted and right when all they hear are voices that agree with them. Because of this they have become bolder and have been coming out of the shadows more. This is why the silence of white people has been so devastating and shameful. The silence can be seen as acceptance.\n\nAnd this is why this campaign, and others like it, are so important. It is a way to break the silence and drag the racists out of their echo chambers kicking and screaming. It is slapping the confederate flag out of their hands and loudly saying, \"NO! if you want to spread hateful rhetoric, you don't get to be heard. If you want to speak hate, we will drown you out. There are more of us and we are louder!\"\n\nI think what people who oppose trending these racist hashtags are missing is that this isn't about changing the minds of the hardcore racists. Most of them are going to retreat to some other racist forum and complain about the Chinese conspiracy while picturing an Asian behind the keyboard of every K-pop tweet. They are a lost cause. This isn't for them.\n\n* It is for the 15 year old in the rural Midwest who needs to see that the world is much more different than their racist family has been saying. This shows that racist views are not widely accepted.\n* It is for the retail worker who just needs a little more courage to speak up the next time their coworker tells them to keep an eye on the black teenagers around the store. This shows that allowing systemic racism in order to avoid conflict is no longer acceptable.\n* It is for the ally who feels hopeless amidst all this and doesn't think their one voice can do anything. This shows that one small voice can become a million thundering voices in a split second. \n* And most importantly, this is for the black community. This shows that we know we are late to the game but we are done being silent.\n\nI say this all as someone who has nothing to do with this trend and doesn't even use Twitter because I honestly don't have time or patience for the usual toxic BS that is the Kpop stan twittterverse. But if there is backlash, if the racists actually think they can fight back online, they don't even realize what they are getting into. Normal Stan Twitter is just a fraction of the kpop fandom. If they want a battle, the reserves will show up. I'll be there with my Instagram or newly created Twitter account ready with fancams from every kpop group I know. This is our home turf. We are well trained in the art of overpowering our opponents with sheer numbers and volume. They have gained power in the shadows but we will drag them into the light and force them to watch Asian boys wearing flawless makeup executing perfectly choreographed dances. All in the name of fighting racism.",

I know that things spread quickly on other platforms like Facebook (also problematic), but because of the character limit on Twitter, you have a constant onslaught of people screaming LOOK AT THIS AND FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT IT with limited context and information for the many people who are only paying attention to that one tweet even if there's follow-up. The format encourages mob mentality and users know that, which is why people are always spamming so hard trying to get things to go viral. The screaming is maybe annoying but harmless a large portion of the time (e.g. when it's just stuff like STAN XYZ), but when things do get crazy on Twitter it tends to escalate *extremely* fast.",

                    "comment": "~~the article I read with the full translation of the post got deleted but here's excerpts.~~ here's the full (LONG) post\n\n\"Looking at articles about Heather Cho, who is the epitome of a 'sociopath' when she created the infamous peanut incident in which she made an airplane with 250 passengers return to the airport over some peanuts, also the article about the psychopathic elementary school daughter of Bang Jung Ho, the former president of TV Chosun, who abused her power and cursed at her 50-year-old chauffeur. I came to wonder how an individual is raised to become like that. I've been deeply thinking about it, but today, I've been thoroughly trampled by this one person, and I became the position of the abused. Proven to be disqualified from being human + a puppet living behind a smiling mask + known to be a warm person by friends + an 'adult child' who lacks character + has a sense of entitlement + has the stupidity that reveals all the deficiencies transparently to the person they meet for the first time. \n\nI should have prepared myself from the stories I've heard before I met her. But today, I became speechless as this person stung me with her words that are like electric needles. I had no choice but to stand still with my hands, feet, and even my brain tied together. I had to stand still in front of that repulsive face that was hysterically throwing a fit at me. I had to stand there like a fool without anything I could do.  This person did not give me time to understand the situation or even seek understanding from this person. This person didn't even give me a chance to explain because she can't hear anything. I've experienced all sorts of people in this field for 15 years. I thought I had experienced everything in life and thought I had let everything go, but I was wrong. \n\nI experienced hell for 20 minutes in an unfamiliar room. This person skipped the greeting and sat right down as this person began spewing insults at my face with her cellphone pointed at me. This person was so emotional that you couldn't know if she's talking to everyone in the room or just me. But either way, the target today was me. I wondered, 'I guess other people experienced this too? They are experiencing it, right?' The knife from her mouth did not stop as I have been stabbed multiple times by her words, and only tears rolled down my face. I wasn't even in the right mind to feel embarrassed that I was crying; tears just came out. What am I doing this for? Who am I doing this for? What do I want to show? Is it to earn money? Who chose me? Did someone ask for a favor? Why am I going through such an insult?!\n\nI thought deeply about this but could not understand her actions. I calmed down, and I wanted to talk to her person to person like a normal human being. And I wanted an apology. But she just disappeared. I recorded everything, just in case something else would happen. I should take action against this lady. I will state the exact facts through my words. \n\nI was an editor paid to work and was a writer. I'm going to use all my energy and use my brain smartly and cleverly from now on. It's been a long time since I felt revenge be a catalyst #psycho #monster\"\n\nThe other industry insider who backed her up said this\n\n**\"I wondered when this would blow up, and it's finally blown up. The people who make sure this kind of thing doesn't leak out really try to keep everyone quiet... They do keep things quiet. Not the person making the fuss, but they keep the people working with them quiet. Even advertisers criticize this person. It's the first time I've seen such a calm person rage like that. I've seen people who say they didn't want to work with me, and I've seen things I shouldn't have seen. A lot of kids in crisis are from that industry. I'm a coward with no courage, so I can't be as confident as you are. I support you, editor. I ask you for justice.\"**",

This is not one of those instances where an idol was a bully in middle school or had an isolated incident years ago and could own up and show that they've changed after years have passed, this is recent so it just points to Irene still being two-faced in that regard. The apology appears to be clear damage control as well, after SM probably already tried to silence the parties involved before this got out. the aftermath is going to be messy...",

Given the amount of other editors (ones from GQ and Vogue Korea prominently), former SM staff, RV stylists and backup dancers etc have liked the original expose post, this is 100% not a one time thing. She\u2019s been this way for a while now. \n\nThe editor who made the post said she had an audio recording of everything Irene said to her which she will release if the \u2018person in question\u2019 lies. SM and Irene probably only apologized so that the recording doesn\u2019t come to light. \n\nI truly hope Irene has learnt from this, but considering the amount of people who seem to have bad experiences with her, I think this is a case of \u2018apologize because I got caught\u2019",

What makes the difference is the extent of her actions on her \"bad\" days). I can only hope the editor and the affected staff members are doing better now.\n\nEdit: a word.",

Which means that SM probably knows how she is too and never made any substantial steps to stop her.",

These are the people that make their music and are the faces of their company. These are the people that rake in the big bucks. Now imagine how they treat employees that are a million times more easily replaced. I'm pretty sure employees knew better than to speak up. SM wouldn't take kindly to employees being a threat to their cash cow.\n\nOutside of the people we've heard of I'm sure there are more ex or current employees from SM that have to bite their tongue right now. Because sharing their own experiences could get them fired, blacklisted or seriously damage their career. Only a small percentage of those she's interacted with have the luxury of being able to speak out. So I'm sure there are more people keeping silent",

They are not her parents or her boss. They are her colleagues. They can't tell her what to do or keep her from behaving in a certain way.\n\nWhen you debut as a group you really get no say in who will be the other members on your team. They could be someone you love as sister or a massive bitch with a huge ego. There really is no way to control that. And your career completely relies on who you are paired up with. If you dislike/disagree with a member of your group there is nothing you can do. You have to grin and bear it and even pretend like you are close on camera. You can't just come out and say: \"Oh Irene? Oh yeah she's a huge bitch and I hate her. But anyway what about that comeback ey...?\"\n\nAnd I'm not even a fan of RV but I'd be seriously disappointed if people used this as an excuse to attack the other members. Being in the same group as a shitty person can happen to anyone, it doesn't prove anything about who the other members are.",

Tons of ex and current SM staff liked the accusation, RV's backup dancers liked it and one of SM's former video directors tweeted that he's surprised it took this long for the truth to be revealed. Even a staff member for Double Patty (Irene's film she's starring in) said she was extremely rude during filming.\n\nEDIT: And when the rumours started swirling that it was between either Seulgi and Irene, tons of staff came forward to defend Seulgi.

                    "comment": "A famous stylist/editor (Kang Kookhwa, Instagram @lookooks, worked a lot with Vogue, GQ etc, previous clients include Amber, Krystal, Ga-In, Lee Hi, Yesung, Bumkey, Primary, Jaurim, Jay Park, Suho, pH-1) posted on Instagram about a client, a female celebrity, who had been incredibly rude to her during a shoot, screaming at her for 20 minutes. She claimed she had an audio recording though she didn't post it. She tagged it #monster and #psycho, which made people speculate that it was Irene. They went back through her Instagram and pointed out that she\u2019d posted compliments towards Irene before, complimenting her visuals and posting positively about Monster - she went back and deleted the first and edited the latter to remove any mention of Irene which basically confirmed it in a lot of people\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s an overview of the stylist\u2019s post [here](https://www.knetizen.com/red-velvets-irene-is-said-to-be-the-female-idol-who-went-on-an-anger-rampage-directed-at-a-photoshoot-editor/) on Knetizen with comments from k-nets.\n\nEdit: [this](https://twitter.com/LeeMyungbak_/status/1319214034319650817) Tweet supposedly lists industry people who liked her post though Reveluvs in the quotes are claiming some of them are fake accounts - a Vogue editor who recently worked with her, Marie Claire editor Seii Lee, a GQ editor, an Esquire editor, an Allure editor, a Beauty+ editor, a Singles editor, an ize Magazine editor, a former RV stylist, BoA's stylist, a former SHINee stylist, BP's nail artist Unistella. [Hong Janghyun](http://hongjanghyun.com/cover/) (who shot BTS's recent Variety cover among dozens of other K-celebrity covers - Kai, Sehun, Jennie, Lisa, Daniel, Lee Hyori etc) left a supportive comment. Another [tweet](https://twitter.com/loveeloveis/status/1319240475337846784) adds a RV backdancer, photographer Kim Heejun (recently worked with Nayeon and BP), models from ESteem, SM's modelling agency, an SM video director, a MUA who worked on a beauty pictorial Irene did and staff of Double Patty, her new movie. People on Pann-Choa are saying Song Hyeko\u2019s stylist liked it too. From a [screenshot](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4981472ac4a5774f0d8845584527f0cde3760970f3e5434120cb5f226fccebf0.jpg?w=600&amp;h=431) I can identify Shin Seongjin who is a former creative director for YG, MUA Woosun who worked with Jennie, photographer Ahn Sangmi and hairstylist Jo Miyeon who worked with Refund Girls.\n\nEditx2: NB has an article up, here are some comments left by knets summarizing comments left on the stylist's posts (disclaimer - no source of these so take them with a grain of salt):\n\n* a translation of a comment left on the post from someone who worked on Double Patty: I recently worked with someone who's famous for being pretty... I've worked in this industry for a long time and have seen plenty of actors, but this person exceeded the imagination. I thought at first that she might just find the film set unfamiliar but that's just how her character naturally is. She's glamorized these negative traits as being shy or sensitive... but I actually felt so bad for her maknae manager. She should just stick to what she's good at. Don't bother others by trying to get into something you don't have the skill for. All of us staff have said... that she had this coming for her.\n* a staff would be helping Irene put on her shoes and Irene would grab the staff's hair to find balance, she'd push a staff on the forehead by the finger and claim she was just \"checking up on her\"",

Especially after reading the context from the original post by the editor who first revealed this story, including about what they had to go through in detail...\n\nThe top Korean comment on Insta on Irene\u2019s apology post basically says, \u201cIf I imagine that the victim was my own mother/father, I can only cry tears of blood. Please apologize to them and live while self-reflecting\u201d. \n\nI think this comment in particular will make anyone realize that this isn\u2019t a matter of \u2018anyone can make mistakes or have a bad day\u2019. They say that you can tell a person\u2019s real attitude by looking at how they treat the people working for them. Considering what that stylist had to endure for 20 minutes were enough to drive them to the point of tears, this isn\u2019t something that can just be excused as a mistake or passed off as something less significant than what it really was.",

That\u2019s why I thought SM staff should have put a stop to her attitude early. Maybe they thought she\u2019s too bankable, maybe she didn\u2019t listen. Sigh.",

I agree with the Korean commenters saying intl fans have no idea what\u2019s happened and are still defending her.... it\u2019s scary how most if not all of the top English comments are jumping to her defence and telling her it\u2019s alright to make mistakes. I\u2019m glad to see that the Korean general public and K-stans are treating this as an issue (although some may be taking it too far) since idols like this will always have a support system to fall back upon and certain fans will always love them, giving them the impression that it\u2019s alright to make a half hearted apology then not change at all.",

Honestly, it really makes her apology feel disingenuous to me since it reads more like \"I'm apologizing since I got caught\" and not something actually genuine.\n\nAnd I'm just surprised that it's Irene of all people who is such a diva. Like girl should be humble as fuck given that debuting at 23 like she did is pretty uncommon for female idols nowadays. I would be thankful every single day I had the opportunity to debut given my age if I was her.\n\nIn any case, now that this has come to light, I'm hoping this gives her a reality check and causes her to change her attitude.",

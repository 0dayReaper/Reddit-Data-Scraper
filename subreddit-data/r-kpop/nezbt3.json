Bringing fans on screen and their messages (?) and the girls breaking down while performing.\n\nPerhaps I'm reading into it too much.",

Change reflected\n\nEDIT 2: ok...so y\u2019all think this is a strong argument, but please y\u2019all this is conjecture.

Some also think they were just waiting for SouMu to be stable enough without them. Maybe the girls are really satisfied already with what they have achieved.",

I really did not expect all of them to leave the company - especially after the acquisition - but I guess they saw some writing on the wall to get out.

No \"last\" comeback, not even a fan-song it seems. Considering they were a group for 6 years, it's quite a shame for their fans - and a stark reminder to how quickly this industry moves on.",

Gfriend was that fucking popular.  And then they just kinda faded away.  After Fingertip, they stagnated and just kinda faded into the background while other groups took over.  They went from a top 3 girl group to kind of a middle tier girl group and stayed there.  They still have never had an album that sold more than 100k copies, even in the modern Kpop era.  I can totally see a world where the girls just got to the end of their contracts and said \"Im done\".",

I feel compelled to believe that something happened behind the scenes and it happened quick. They're coming off one of their best years for crying out loud. Maybe they'll sign with another company.

Great career as a group from beginning to end, very few scandals from what I can remember (minus the Nazi thing). Overall, this is Sistar level disbandment and it's honestly the best way to go. As a Buddy since they debuted, I hope that they can advance their careers and have happy lives.\n\nNow, if they disband the Gfriend name and regroup themselves under a different company/name like BEAST-&gt;Highlight then slap me silly. Everything I said is somewhat still the same. They won't be Gfriend, but that book will close and a new story will begin under a different name. Either way, I enjoyed their music so much that I would consider them a top 3 girl group. Thank you Gfriend for the last 6 years, and here's to many more",

Maybe it could be a Sistar situation? Still I can't process this.\n\nI just wanna know what each member will do after the shock of this news settle down.",

With other groups there are always things that have me guessing that members might want to leave a group, but not with gfriend. What even are the members plans? Wasn't Source really desperate to keep their only group? This just doesn't make any sense",

            "comment": "I'm going to go against the grain and actually say this is kind of refreshing. Everybody watching knows that some of these idols are much more popular and successful than others. The idols themselves know it too. These shows usually ignore that fact, when it actually has a huge impact. Maybe the biggest impact. \n\nOpenly acknowledging it can, understandably, make people pretty uncomfortable, like when employees share their salaries. But putting it out there actually opens the door to addressing the inequity. \n\nIf Mnet was extra cool (they aren't) they could actually use that information to balance things out with a popularity handicap system. If the popular people want to win, they have to perform even better to make up for the fact that they have such an advantage. And the less popular people get a leg up with free points to make up for the disadvantage of not having a huge fanbase. Of course, I don't believe for one second they'll go that far, but I still like that they spoke the truth.",

We've seen it time and time again: when a show's voting system is weighted most heavily on fan voting (particularly, domestic fan votes), the most famous contestants win, whether or not they are most talented, most deserving, etc. I get that popularity will help drive the fandom/sales, but forming a good group requires *balance.* Mnet's focus for this show is making good entertainment and money, so I don't anticipate a carefully crafted point system.",

I watched it with my mum and anytime eliminations came up and it relied on fan votes to stay on the show I\u2019d just be like, ok these two are the more famous and would you know. 90% of the time you could predict who would survive each elimination round lol. \n\nSame shit with queendom 2 tbh. Any song that had kep1er or brave girls attached performed the worst. It wasn\u2019t because of performance quality it was just because out of all the contestants they were the least popular. The rankings basically never changed week by week except when it came to sympathy votes whenever one group was close to being kicked off the show.",

The ranking is also based on commercial success (music show wins + album sales) instead of skill, which seems to correlate with the use of the term. \n\nIt's been perceived as them being openly classified as A-, B-, C- and D-listers, and Mnet has been heavily criticized for using this kind of language in an official capacity as well as for their ranking criteria.",

            "comment": "the real controversy imo is how that ranking \u201cbased on music show wins and sales\u201d makes zero sense. and I can contest this with an open mind since I like all the groups involved. Woo!Ah! has better sales than Rocket Punch but still got their members ranked in a below tier. Weki Meki Elly also was in the last tier, when arguably she is the same boat as the RCPC members. and how Laboum Haein was in the second tier? Laboum always had terrible sales and got ONE (controversial btw) music show win\u2026 and got on the same group with Purple Kiss Yuki and CLC Yeeun?! what??? these are three groups in completely different tiers ffs \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nfor me these rankings seemed pure arbitrary ranking made just for them to build their drama on top of it. Nana will be the \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d that came from the lowest rank, etc.",

            "comment": "It was brutal, but it wasn't wrong. Their ranking is accurate to how I believe Korean society would rank the contestants. The placements that most accurately represent this are Yeoreum in tier 1, and Miru and in tier 4. I'll explain why Miru is in 4 (even though the criteria was shown).\n\nExperience outside of Korea's industry means almost nothing, unless that translates to some level of success within Korea. Miru's 13 years of experience being her keyword made everyone act like a major sunbae would walk out, but their reactions changed when they saw who it was. I'm sure they still respect her, but they may not view her as a \"sunbae\" considering her lack of experience in Korea.\n\nSakura, by comparison, is constantly heralded for her long career and days with AKB48. \n\nOn the flip side, Yeoreum has seen quite a bit of success with WJSN. Music show wins, decent sales, a viral song with As You Wish, and most of all winning Queendom 2. Yet strangely, Yeoreum herself doesn't seem to have much popularity amongst the general public or international fans. \n\nYeoreum is definitely well known, but why is her career considered more noteworthy than Miru's? Answer: her successes are based in Korea. \n\nConclusion: The ranking system was brutal, but it is VERY accurate in showing how they are viewed. The two foreign contestants being placed in tier 4 due to lack of experience in the Korean industry helps show that their talents/past careers are not viewed in high regard, at least before they gain success in Korea.",

Makes it sound like he was filming a vlog or something rather than a music video or anything official? I wonder what happened?\n\nEither way, here's hoping he's able to rest and recover at his own pace before he returns. NCT is set to be busy until the end of the year, and I hope he isn't feeling pressure from the company or fans to exert himself before he's ready.",

They say he just needs a brace so it seems he avoided something serious.",

That type of content is more so they can explore and experiment with their music, please the existing fans and engage new ones, and looking at how much the fandom grew since march that strategy clearly worked!\n\nIt reminds me of what happened with Idol, we got a smaller MV and a song that wasn\u2019t very radio-friendly but had a huge artist significance for BTS themselves, as it was a nod of how they\u2019re still Korean even if they\u2019re aiming to enter the US market. In the end we did get higher youtube numbers, but in charts everywhere it was underperforming comparing to Fake Love. A lot of people complained that BH didn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing with promotions, but a little after BTS got the Medal of Cultural Merit (which was huge, huge for them as korean artists) and their next comeback (BWL) was their biggest success yet.\n\nMy guess is that there\u2019s a pattern there of them balancing more experimental, freer artistic-choice songs with other radio and public friendly ones. Maybe with the new album (that is clearly a personal project of theirs) we will see a promotion style more similar to 7/ON, and that\u2019s why they released and promoted Dynamite now instead of together with the album.",

Besides ON and Chicken Noodle Soup, I'm pretty sure no other video surpassed 20M views until May. Likes were also affected pretty severely. \n\nThere really weren't many big releases in that time frame apart from BTS. So I'm guessing after Mots:7 YouTube realized that their new algorithm was far too strict. Hence the adjustment. In May alone, there were at least 4 videos that had over 20M. \n\nOf course, ON suffered from several other factors as well. No teaser, a different release schedule with multiple videos (as well as several solo releases shortly after), significantly longer length (the On mv is almost twice as long as BP's latest mv), less repeatability, being part of a full album, and a pretty severe surge of the pandemic in most Asian countries. Imo, ON should have had ~60M imo despite all the other factors. The biggest issue was definitely the algorithm.",

This also means that BTS broke the previous record for the fastest video to reach 100 million views (the previous record was 32 hours and 22 minutes).\n\nCongrats BTS and ARMYS!\n\nTranslation:\n\nBTS set a new record for the most-viewed YouTube music video in 24 hours.\n\nAccording to YouTube, the music video for BTS\u2019s digital single \u2018Dynamite\u2019 recorded 101.1 million views in the first 24 hours. This means that BTS broke a new record for the most views on a YouTube music video in 24 hours.\n\nPreviously, the music video for \u2018Dynamite\u2019 was confirmed to be the biggest music video premiere with over 3 million peak concurrents.\n\nAs of today, \u2018Dynamite\u2019 topped iTunes Top Songs charts in 104 countries. In addition, BTS became the first Korean artist to reach the top of Spotify\u2019s main music chart \u201cGlobal Top 50\u201d with \u2018Dynamite.\u2019\n\nBTS\u2019s music video for \u2018Dynamite\u2019 shows off a cheerful and refreshing mood. Backgrounds filled with various colors and \u201cretro-concept\u201d props, outfits, and hairstyles especially stand out in the video. The elaborate choreography and solo performances are a sight to see.\n\nBTS released \u2018Dynamite\u2019 so that they could spread hope and volatility to everyone during this COVID-19 situation. The members melted their own style and individuality into this funky disco pop song.",

I hope we break top 20 on the Singles chart at the end of the week. The peak is 34 with ON .",

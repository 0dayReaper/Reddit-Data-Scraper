            "comment": "Translation (completed):\n\nIn 2012, Jennie made her face known through G-Dragons music video. She starred as one of the main characters for the music video of his song \u201cTHAT XX,\u201d which was included in his solo album \u2018One Of A Kind.\u2019\n\nTheir relationship continued on the following year. Jennie featured on \u201cBlack,\u201d the title track from G-Dragon\u2019s second full-length album. In 2013, G-Dragon was Jennie\u2019s idol, and Jennie was G-Dragon\u2019s muse.\n\nIt is now 2021, and 8 years have gone by. What is the relationship between G-Dragon (32) and Jennie (24) like now? BLACKPINK\u2019s Jennie has fallen in love. Her lover? It\u2019s her idol, G-Dragon. The two are singers who represent YG Entertainment. Their relationship developed into that of a romantic junior-senior romance. They have been dating for around a year now.\n\nDispatch caught sight of G-Dragon and Jennie\u2019s secret date. Most of their dates occurred in G-Dragon\u2019s Hannam-dong luxury villa.\n\nTo start, G-Dragon\u2019s penthouse flaunts its own exclusive parking system. This separate parking space is located within the villa\u2019s public parking lot. To get from the main gate to the parking lot, you have to go through two separate authentication processes. \n\nNext, there is a private elevator that goes from the private parking lot to the penthouse. As there is no need to exit out of the parking lot to use the elevator, there are no worries about being seen.\n\nJennie registered her personal YG-owned Carnival van to G-Dragon\u2019s villa. This way, she could get to the private parking lot without authentication. She then took the elevator to the penthouse.\n\nJennie\u2019s \u201cdating routine\u201d was very consistent. During her BLACKPINK promotions, the first thing she did after finishing her schedules was to go to G-Dragon\u2019s house. She repeated the \u201cWork -&gt; Date -&gt; Return Home\u201d formula. Even when she wasn\u2019t working, she stuck to this kind of pattern.\n\nThe two\u2019s relationship is an open secret in YG Entertainment. First, Jennie\u2019s manager was in charge of driving her. The manager would drop Jennie off at G-Dragon\u2019s house and pick her up. Sometimes, G-Dragon\u2019s manager would do this instead of Jennie\u2019s manager.\n\nLast year, G-Dragon made a surprise appearance on the set of BLACKPINK\u2019s music video set while the group was preparing for their 1st full-length album. The visit was partly due to his support for the group as a YG senior artist, and partly due to his affection for Jennie.\n\nOn the day of BLACKPINK\u2019s online concert on January 31st, Jennie left G-Dragon\u2019s house and headed to the concert venue. G-Dragon\u2019s car was found near the venue (Korea International Exhibition Center).\n\nA close friend of the two told Dispatch, \u201cA number of people in YG are aware of their relationship. Jennie\u2019s mother is also aware of her daughter\u2019s relationship with G-Dragon. The mother is thankful that he is treating her daughter well.\u201d",

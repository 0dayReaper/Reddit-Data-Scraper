I remember back in maybe 2013 or so, a big US magazine (it might have been ELLE actually) used a photo of Yoona for a small article and it was so exciting, I had to go pick up a copy of it just for that article lol. It\u2019s amazing how far Kpop has come, and Blackpink really is the biggest girl group worldwide right now. Asian artists being on a big US magazine like this is going to be huge for a lot of kids and young people, too. \n\nIt reminds me of Tiffany\u2019s song, Not Barbie: \u201cAll these magazines//Page after page and no one looks like me//Cause we ain't the same.\u201d\n\nThe representation is so needed and Blackpink is an excellent representative group for Kpop.

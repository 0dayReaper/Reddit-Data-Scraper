You'd get to hear what kind of sound they usually have for the albums, you can explore solo stuff as you'd like.\n\nIf you don't want to go through the albums, go through the MV's at least as it would be much more fun to then watch the new one. They usually have some lore and storyline going on, while it's not necessary to read up on the entire thing, you wouldn't feel as lost while watching the MV as you would if you watch it without knowing a bit of the concept",

This instrumental is so fucking fire - props to collapsedone for S-tier production work - those lush pads &amp; funky AF bassline are so good! And Twice, you ladies totally killed it on the vocals - harmonizing &amp; ad-libs totally on point - and choreo!!!\n\nIDC if I'm biased, I'm so proud of the members for how far they've come the past 7 years. And also unabashedly glad to be a part of the fandom. Twice 2.0 is just getting started y'all!",

Rap line (now with Momo doing the ad libs) ABSOLUTELY ATE? Nayeon's final high note? The harmonizing in the bridge (Mina's voice is always best for bridge + CHAE SINGING???) \n\nSOUNDS LIKE SOTY!!!!

It's an instant bop, immediately likeable (at least to me), while some of their songs like Alcohol-Free needed some times to really getting accustomed to the vibe and understand if I liked it or not. \n\nI absolutely love how Jihyo starts and ends the first chorus, it's so powerful and totally set the tone for a fun but \"in your face\" song. Good choice. Nayeon in the second is a safe bet and as always, she delivers. I really like the variations in the third chorus. Jeongyeon singing right before the chorus is perfect, her voice is a treasure. \n\nAll sections are quite short but the song doesn't end abruptly, which is a plus. \n\nAlso... Is it me or Tzuyu voice keeps becoming more addicting each time? I loved her parts.",

It's one of the better CBs this year definitely, and possibly one of their better TTs, which is impressive, given how stacked their discography is.\n\nThe video gave came close to giving me a heart attack. I'm glad I've seen the teasers and the photo sets. Otherwise, I'd drop dead like that teddy bear from the visual assault.\n\nI understand it's a Macintosh nod, but that sequence where Chaeyoung transformed into Nayeon hurling a hammer towards that screen showing the Scientist cat is hilarious.  I laugh myself to tears every time I watch it. It's so random it's so meme-y. Praying to the gods someone make a GIF of it.\n\nJihyo and Sana coming one after the other, with contrasting very powerful vocals with the sweetest vocals left me even more confused who my ult is.\n\nTzuyu proved she can still improve vocally 7 years into her career as an idol. She was an okay singer to begin with, but what she served in her verse is main vocal material.\n\nJeongyeon is such a treasure. Her beauty shot with the dramatic lighting served old Hollywood glamour meets Madonna-in-her-prime era with that corset worn over a dapper shirt and tie combo.\n\nChaeyoung glowed the most in her red lingerie with black leather(?) jacket look. That was everything. Dahyun served looks too. That black number fits her conservative aesthetic, but also showcased her hourglass curves.\n\nOf course, much had already been said about Mina's S&amp;M outfit. She, Momo and Nayeon served one sexy look after another as usual.\n\nNayeon is especially a joy to watch. She glows in every frame, as if reminding us that prior to this CB, she's already an accomplished, record-setting soloist with a debut song that went viral. Such a boss.\n\nI didn't think it's possible to fall in love even more with Twice. I already gave them my heart and soul last year.\n\nTTT is so good musically. It had incorporated many retro elements but it sounds current.\n\nThose riffs, and also the three notes for the words 'Talk that talk' have that flourish that gives the song an 'Oriental' flavor. I'm sorry for the term, but I can't articulate it properly,  it's like the clich\u00e9 riff movies use to depict scenes set in (especially historic) East Asia.\n\nThe build up from the prechorus to the chorus is addictive. The bridge to last chorus succession is also so good.\n\nThe verses are the least special but they're also good. The repetitive words adds musicality to the verses. It's also good that they distributed both verses to many members. Momo's lines are nice touches as additional elements.",

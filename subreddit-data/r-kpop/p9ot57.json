And it would be nice to see idols no longer have to release statements either.\n\nI\u2019m glad RV fans seem to be supportive from what I\u2019ve seen. I can imagine if it was a group like bts, fans would go crazy lol",

And Crush has a great reputation by general public so she won\u2019t get hated. Honestly one of the safest couples out there. \n\nHappy for them but thank fucking god this did not come out before they came back. This would have sunk Red Velvet\u2019s chances of coming back for sure.",

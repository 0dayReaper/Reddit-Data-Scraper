    "postText": "As of 12am on March 1st KST Spotify saw huge number of KPop songs go inactive/can't be played. So far there are reports of this from US, CA, UK, DE so I assume it's world wide. The link seems to be everything licensed by/to Kakao M (who own Melon). Spotify recently launched in Korea without their catalog so I assume this is related to that problem: https://hypebae.com/2021/2/spotify-korea-launch-without-iu-zico-monsta-x-kakao-m-k-pop-music-streaming-service-info.\n\nI'm not going to list the artists as I'm sure at least hundreds have been impacted, here are some examples using IU's discography: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/luigtf/spotify_removes_a_huge_number_of_kpop_tracks/gp6i0lu/\n\nTo be clear this is going to have a huge impact on tons and tons of artists, many labels and artists would use Kakao M as their distributor.\n\nIt seems like as a general rule things released by SM, YG, JYP, and BH are fine, but anything from a smaller label has a good chance of being gone. But this is a general rule as licensing can be complicated: GFriend's discography is mostly gone because Source distributed through Kakao M not Big hit. \n\nAlso **please don't rush to blame Spotify**. It's hard to say who is at fault for this particular decision but Kakao M certainly blocked Spotify from getting their songs in Korea to limit competition with Melon. If you're a subscriber please contact Spotify and let them know you want this music, but realize they may not be able to do anything.\n\nHere is a list (thread) on twitter of artists with removals but keep in mind this is going to be very much incomplete, so many artists were hit by this - https://twitter.com/lemonphobic/status/1366048808220639234\n\nIf you have Spotify playlists you can see what songs were removed by turning on \"Show unavailable songs in playlists\" under display options in the settings menu.\n\nNote: I've made a few edits here, this comment is also worth checking out: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/luigtf/spotify_removes_a_huge_number_of_kpop_tracks/gp6skgk/\n\n12:50 pm KST update: Spotify https://www.soompi.com/article/1456872wpp/spotify-officially-explains-why-hundreds-of-k-pop-releases-were-removed-from-platform-worldwide and Kakao M https://twitter.com/tmikpop/status/1366233681820585987 have now both made statements.\n\n2:00 pm KST update: P-Nation seems to have reuploaded some songs that were taken down under their own copyright. May see some other labels also able to do this - https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/luzxwa/p_nation/",

YouTube music and YouTube are completely linked. This means that any song that is available on YouTube is available on YT music and vice versa. So for example, if you listen to a song on YT music and you go and check your watch history on YouTube, it counts as if you played that as a video on YouTube. Also, if you have ever seen a song on YouTube from an official artist page with just an album cover and comments disabled, that is the YT music version of the song. And if you listen to it on YouTube, that automatically gets counted as a listen on YT music too. \n\nSo because YouTube is such a large discovery tool for pretty much every artist, it will probably be in Kakao M's best interest to keep that licensing agreement up. But who knows how far greedy shithead companies will go so you can't be sure.",

I am no expert in this but since none of us know whether spotify or Kakao M is the one causing this. (Most likely Kakao M) The best way is probably letting the kpop company know that their music are not reaching to the global market, and a lot of their fan cant listen to their songs. They will probally investigate it better than us lol. Plus we can get the these kpop agency to consider switching distributor in the future.",

As far as I've checked some of IU songs have returned to my playlist and will play but they still have yet to reappear on her artist profile.\n\n(EDIT 2) It's now around 50ish songs I've redownloaded, all of which that I know of atm are IU. They only play if I've downloaded them.\n\n (EDIT 3) I've redownloaded a total of 59 songs and I'm fairly certain all of which are IU.

Plus, Cherry Bullet, who literally just had their first mini and were getting more exposure, and IU, who's about to have a full-length comeback. I feel sick.\n\nI made the full switch to streaming sites just a few months ago and got Spotify Premium as well since I can comfortably use it with Chromecast. This is why I have trust issues with streaming platforms and was hesitant for years - you never know when they're gonna take some of your favorite songs away from you. \n\nThey better fix this shit because this pisses off both the artists and the fans.\n\nEDIT: WHAT THE FUCK THEY REMOVED ZERO ATTITUDE THAT SHIT WAS MY JAM OF THE YEAR HOW DARE YOU",

As long as you don't delete the playlist, they are still listed as a part of the playlist behind the scenes! Spotify didn't remove the songs from their databases, so one day when this reverts back to normal (I'm being a bit too optimistic here), I believe all of our playlists would go back to normal with no problems? I personally have spent WAY too much time organizing and creating kpop playlists, so I was worried that I wouldn't remember what songs were in each of my playlists... but if you check on a desktop version of Spotify, you can still see the greyed out songs (which are unavailable, but at least you'll be able to see what you used to have before and recreate the playlist in Youtube music or other streaming platforms). It's still going to be a pain to recreate giant playlists, but I hope this is a little bit comforting :(((",

Yeah the big 3 is still there but as the years pass I've been giving more niche groups attention.\n\nNow as an international fan only the biggest of the big are exposed to me...there videos trend on youtube all the time. I can't miss their newest releases even if I tried.\n\nThis sucks so much.",

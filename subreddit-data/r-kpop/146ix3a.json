Intrigued as to what their concept will be. Very specific, but the colour and texture are making me picture a grandkid finding this photo in their grandfather\u2019s photo album and that\u2019s not grandma, so there\u2019s like a ~nostalgic/the one who got away story~ behind it. Yes, I got all that from this picture, my brain is weird \ud83d\ude02",

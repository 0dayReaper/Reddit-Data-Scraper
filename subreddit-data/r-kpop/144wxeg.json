Because A.C.E had this thing for their birthdays 2 years ago, where they did [remakes of the posters](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FH3GqbHUYAI0BzR?format=jpg&amp;name=large) of their favorite movies, and then Beat also [made this](https://i.redd.it/nj0omxt7j2881.jpg) for their family concert, lol.",

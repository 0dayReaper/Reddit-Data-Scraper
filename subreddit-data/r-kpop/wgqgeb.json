Love this comeback, a nostalgic sound with homage to ITNW, with a mix of modern trendy sound (which I kinda quite relate to Hyo's solo releases). As they say, GG4EVA!",

It actually reminded me a lot of the way Miss Atomic Bomb by The Killers includes those opening guitar notes from Mr. Brightside during the bridge (given that it was written sort of as a sequel to that song).\n\nWith all the girls' individuals scenes in the MV depicting them in the current 'grown-up' careers (Taeyeon - full-fledged singer, Sooyoung - actress, Hyoyeon - DJ, etc), it's such a tasteful and surprisingly emotional follow up to the whole theme shown in ITNW and how this is basically them in that said 'new world' now.",

Honestly, this song sounds so different compared to everything SM released for the past 2 years.\n\n\nBut we have to talk about the MV and the line distribution.

While I actually do enjoy the newer groups there is something so incredibly refreshing about our girls, their sound and their angelic visuals. I don't mind new sounds but \"FOREVER 1\" just shows how good we have always had it with our beautiful angels.... So of the first words to describe \"Forever 1\" when I was watching it as it debuted last night was fresh, fulfilling and satisfying. It left me with such contentment with its sweet nostalgia for all of their previous catalog of music but with a good, strong driving sound that I was just left so \"full\" as if after an amazing top-tier meal. This is, of course, what separates SNSD from the pack of other girl groups. This is why they are special, unique, and always trendsetting. They, for lack of a better term, invented the modern girl group. It is very fitting on what might be their last release as a group that it wrap up everything so perfectly in one special sweet song.",

I love the rising melody in the chorus, reminds me of ABBA somehow.\n\nThe ITNW sampling in the bridge is so cool and iconic!  not everyone can do that.. Sampling your song from 15 years ago. Insane! It fits well too. \n\nTo hear the nation's GG sing \"we are forever\" is just tear jerking.. 15 years in and they are still telling us that they are here to stay. My heart is full. There is no one like you SNSD! \n\nPS Girl groups are incredible. Period",

FOREVER 1 is another legendary comeback that is nostalgic and new all at once. The song is simply beautiful and the visuals of the MV are breathtaking.

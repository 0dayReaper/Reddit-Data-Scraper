Cant drink like they could before, no clubs, and covid has hurt their training schedules too so they have more crap time and time passes slowly when you are doing nothing..",

Honestly, watching people get too optimistic hurts both them and Wendy, who shouldn't have to feel she needs to rush recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven now, people need to understand \"returning to dance practice\" doesn't mean she'll  be dancing on stage any time soon. The road ahead of it is much shorter than it was a year ago but it's still pretty long. Idols who dance poorly, even when injured, receive harsh criticism, so it's best she still takes it slow.",

Given the length of time she's taken already, the injury was probably quite bad, and she might have permanent limitations on her performance, similar to what Heechul has dealt with, though less severe than his.\n\nIn addition, the facial injury was bad enough that it has *significantly* impacted her singing. To most people, they will hear very little difference, and she still sounds great, but professionally trained vocalists who are fans of hers seem to all agree that her technique has suffered quite a lot (for her). The reason for this is likely due to whatever repairs were needed to her jaw. Jaw positioning is actually one of the fundamental components of proper vocal technique, and it's literally one of the first things you learn. She has mentioned a couple of times in the past that singing wasn't \"working\" and that she's having to relearn. This is almost definitely because of jaw issues. She loves singing probably more than anything else, and she always looks genuinely happiest when she gets to sing songs she loves. As someone who also loves singing and considers Wendy my \"ultimate bias\", I'm unspeakably sad for the emotional pain she's probably been dealing with (pretty much entirely projection on my part since I don't actually know her).\n\nWendy is a trooper though. She'll figure everything out. Even if she could not continue promoting with RV (which I don't anticipate being a serious concern at this time, based on the information we've been provided), she will be able to keep making music and gracing us all with her incredible voice.",

Singing is her life. Of course she's practicing every day. It's mostly a mental/emotional thing at this point.

Also I'm no doctor and they're probably going at it intensively but 1 year seems pretty minimal for her line of work given the damage that was done",

Which is why im confused for the still continual concern that she will be/is being rushed. I know they've had quite the bad reputation in the past for pushing injured idols to keep performing, but even just what a year or two ago now there was an nct member out for over a year to recover from a herniated disc. Compared to another company which somehow let one of their idols do a whole comeback and more with a herniated disc. There is obviously a lot of room between the severity of two of the same kind of injury but it is still a serious injury to have and let alone perform with regardless. But i also think recently sm has become somewhat more proactive on keeping seriously injured idols on the sidelines til they are absolutely ready to return for the idols own future health and lets be honest the future profitability to the company as well instead of having them continue to promote while not fully healed.",

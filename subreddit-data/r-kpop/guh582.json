Whole album felt like a direction was given, narrowing the style of songs, and they forced it through rather than letting the magic happen organically. Still, it's good to experiment, especially with mini albums.",

Going somewhere in the middle leaves a much larger audience just being whelmed. I think More &amp; More would have represented the album a lot better without the drops, but because of the drops, they chose it as being the most catchiest song to promote. Just weird and unexpected and when you get over it, it's a decent album. Very hard to always do better each release and this album wasn't really made to do that. It was a creative project with a theme which I really appreciate. I really love the effort of intentionally putting out a mini album with fewer songs with a theme so fans that like the style can buy it or pass. They aren't milking us by putting out half an album just to be relevant for the year with a variety of styles of songs.",

Whetever they were asked if they liked the song they were like \"I don't know\" \"if once like it, I will like it too\" lol. Compared how they talked about Fancy or Feel Special it's like completely opposite feeling.\n\nThis songs really lacks something that was Twice trademark. Super strong and catchy chorus. Even drop chorus on DTNA was great. But this is really underwhelming. Im sad. I feel like it will grow on me tho, since i like everything except the chorus.",

A shitload of people pre-ordered this album because the group keeps getting bigger (particularly on a global scale) and their more recent releases were well-received. They were breaking records when they merely revealed a few seconds of the instrumental, so it's not like so many people bought it because they loved the title track so much. Also, the last comeback was in Autumn, there was a ton of hype and much more people had enough trust to make the purchase without having heard a single track (myself included). \n\nHonestly, this was an experiment that I personally welcome with open arms because it strayed from the formula without being a turn-off (even though there's a vocal portion of the fanbase that seems to be let down, it still gets a lot of love overall). I'm positive they're just gonna continue doing what they want as long as the group keeps getting more popular. I wouldn't be surprised if the next comeback will have a more universally-praised title track that's musically more similar to Fancy and Feel Special.",

It\u2019s a cute bop but it didn\u2019t do much for me. \n\nAlso sucks that Jihyo wasn\u2019t really in the music video either. \n\nEdit: In fancy and feel special they utilized Jihyo but not for more and more \ud83e\udd14 probably why the song didn\u2019t hit hard enough.",

IMO they should give her shorter catchy lines like in Likey more often than one longer lines like in More &amp; More. But yea Jihyo\u2019s absence was strangely noticeable in this song.",

This song makes no sense in its own composition, let alone as a title track in comparison to the B-sides, which are all more worthy selections. If this song were a B-side, nobody would be saying \"M&amp;M should have been the title!\".  \nM&amp;M doesn't display their strengths, doesn't show a growth or progression, doesn't present a new direction, isn't in line with any musical trends that I'm aware of, so why was it picked?  \nIt's almost like someone approved everything in the song and MV based on a small sample and was either oblivious or too stubborn to acknowledge that it didn't turn out as expected and pushed it through anyway.  \n  \nHopefully someone realizes it before promotions are over or they have a second round and do a MV for one of the other songs on the album. I'm leaning towards Make Me Go, but they have a few candidates.",

This is probably their worst Korean single. I'm a huge Twice fan, and I initially didn't like \"Feel Special\" but my opinion eventually changed on that song the more I listened to it. However, I don't see myself liking \"More &amp; More\" in the future. There are was nothing in the song that stuck out as memorable or catchy to me.",

I didn't really notice Jihyo or nayeon that much in the song which is a bold choice since they usually sing the chorus. Dahyun I feel like got a lot of love which is nice to see. \n\nMV wise I thought it was really well done and unique. The platform on the water in Jeju was a really inspired choice that I don't really remember ever seeing. The editing was also really cool.\n\nI'm going to have to absorb the song more since it's definitely not a normal twice track even though it's bright\n\nEdit: watched it again and dahyun and chaeyoung truly shine in this song. It's bright which I've missed as well. Someone else said this but the formula was definitely thrown out and the members have a lot more smaller parts here and there that the mv doesn't highlight significantly, like the adlibs\n\nEdit2: it feels like this is going to be on the more controversial side for Twice. The chorus is definitely something you either can dig or you can't. I really like the instrumental loop so it works for me. I feel like it's a lot stronger than DTNA which had a weak chrous until the adlibs at the end.\n\nEdit3: after listening to it a bit more, it's not bad at all but it's not in my top 5. It's better than Fancy (the vocals in fancy really annoy me), but it doesn't reach WiL, TT, Heartshaker, Feel Special, or Likey. I find it interesting that JYP wrote a partial chant in the middle of the chorus when normally his melodies are really strong. I wonder if he was stuck in a hard place because Zara Larrson songs usually let the chorus remain mainly instrumental. Bibi also didn't write the best rap in the world.",

This song does not  fit Twice at all and they cannot pull it off. Except for some parts in  the beginning and Mina's parts, this is a big miss.\n\nNot  to mention the production sonically speaking is not exciting enough,  the chorus is very lukewarm and short af. The dancebreak is NOT that  good that it warranted taking this big of a space in the song. Not even  the verses got me going... It just feels so stale.\n\nI  don't want to harp on Dahyun too much (yet again) but I cannot stand  her parts in this song, like in many other songs they've had in the past  I feel like if lines were given to someone else or hell if the whole  song was given to another group it would've been better.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR:**  Vocals are not exciting and the song is way too boring.

Visuals are a powerful part to a song. Even when just listening to the song alone, you should get a good picture going in your head that fits woth the music video. A good example would be Fever by GFRIEND, my experience matched the mv.\nAn example where the matchup failed would be LATATA by GIDLE. And I feel like overall, it wasn't a good fit..\n\nChoreography was pretty damn grand. Zero complaints. In fact it is probably my second favorite of theirs behind Feel Special (I can't get over the damn foot kicky thing, it's so satisfying to watch lol)\n\nThe music and visuals just weren't a strong fit for the theme of temptation/desire. \n\nI do like the song. But it's never a good thing to feel like you're still waiting for the killing part of a song, and it's even worse when a nearly 4min song feels like  90sec.\n\nBiggest complaint is the music video itself. It just really looked and felt like a debut MV..\n\nFancy really made me feel cute and fancied.\n\nFeel Special made me obviously feel pretty fking special.\n\nMore &amp; More has me wondering why there wasn't more...",

I mean, Feel Special was such a neat package, it all tied in effortlessly and I\u2019m rather meh about this one. It\u2019s not what I expected at all and it just doesn\u2019t have the Twice catchy spark. I get that they\u2019re evolving but their signature motif has always been some kinda ear worm. I honestly expected more.",

            "comment": "oh no, the song is over the place after two listens. and the chorus is so disappointing...they teased the best parts with the opening and dance break tbh. i'm sad bc i was so hyped for it, i didn't expect it to sound like that at all. i wished jyp just quit the rap parts bc they never work but this one especially didn't flow at all. the transition from chorus to dance break was non-existent, it just felt awkward. the part i also liked was jungyeon+chaeyoung part in 2nd verse, they sounded great. i don't feel pre-chorus either :'( the mv looks better than expected tho, i didn't like the sets but the cinematography is nice. hope i'll get some good songs in the ep.",

On a serious note I remember someone saying a few weeks back that they hoped the chorus wouldn\u2019t just be instrumental so it sucks we got that. The rap was powerful though and the mv, do we even have to talk about it? Beautiful, amazing, everything else that\u2019s good.\n \nOn an extra note I wish they\u2019d played around with the religious themes a bit more since I was really feeling it in the teasers",

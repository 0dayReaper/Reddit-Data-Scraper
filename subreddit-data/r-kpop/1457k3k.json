I replayed the shit out of I last year too.\n\nIt's been ages since their last album but these girls still have my hearts. Chowon deserves to be known as an all-rounder, Juhyeon deserves to be up there among one of the best 4th gen dancers, and Nayoung, Hina, and Yujeong deserves to be variety stars with how entertaining they can be. I really hope Sangah kills it in Queendom Puzzle and showcases why she's such a bias wrecker.",

Also who knows if the members aren't evil-edited and the show even hurts the group more than it helps.\n\nIt could obviously still turnaround but chances are slim.",

It worked for Bugaboo, Bvndit, Dreamnote, Secret Number, Nature, Elris, Bling Bling, Brave Girls, Cignature, Class:y, Everglow, GWSN, Good Day, Gugudan, Irris, KARD, Weki Meki, Weeekly, and Mimiirose; it'll work for Lightsum too!\n\nThe music has steadily gotten better though, so I have hope for the future. Also, Chowon.",

Chowon had song writing in her profile during debut. Sangah has also taken producing classes. Even the maknae they kicked out, Jian, was writing her own raps since predebut.\n\nThe producer of 'i' their most popular (and best) b-side was at Cube last summer making songs.\n\nThe problem is not having songs, Pentagon's last comeback was more than 500 days ago and they have hundreds of unreleased songs as said by them.",

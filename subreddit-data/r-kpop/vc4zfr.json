All 7 want to continue on as a group? That's up to them, same with if say one member wants to focus on acting, or one wants to get married and start a family.

I think besides their group music activities, they also had additional non music related duties like being ambassadors for South Korea and attending numerous diplomatic events locally and overseas over these years. It's not a burden but there's alot of load on their schedules and additional responsibilities.\n\nAnd they are all so super high profile public figures, so everything they do and say will be in the public eye. They have also reached the ceiling of success commercially as a music group so it's normal they want to catch a break and pursue other interests at this time. \n\nThe part they mentioned that the English song trilogy didn't feel like their identity, I totally get it. The songs ( Permission to dance, Butter, Dynamite) were all radio friendly and easily listening, perhaps catering to the western market. Listening to their other hit Kpop songs like Idol, Fake Love, Mic Drop etc, the lyrics hit differently and were more in line with them telling their personal stories. I enjoyed the English releases including My Universe with Coldplay as well and I hope they can balance both the local and international market going forward. They have already achieved so much in 9 years and it's exciting to see how their music will evolve in the future.",

As a longtime Kpop fan (I'm talking since....2008 lol) I was genuinely surprised at how long BTS seemed glued together as a group unit- especially since a lot of groups tend to fracture over time as they pursue their own individual interests and grow apart (nothing wrong with that at all, very natural thing to do as you grow older). I have a feeling BTS blowing up worldwide probably played in part in the rationale behind their agency wanting to keep them together mostly (mostly! I'm aware of their solo endeavours) as a unit.\n\nThis is a really healthy move for them! It's like they said- it's not a disbandment, just taking time to focus on themselves and their solo careers/interests. It's worked for other groups (SHINee) and with their fanbase, it will definitely work for them. Excited to see how they'll grow as individuals. and of course, always happy to see people in the industry take the time they need to heal.",

I'm looking forward to the next 7 solo albums planned and they emphasized it won't be a mixtape but a proper release (RM saying it would be special to see their solo songs on Korean charts was really interesting to hear). \n\nAs a Mamamoo fan, I can relate a bit with group activities taking a backseat and Mamamoo doing a lot of individual activities.

They really kept it together for their fans and it's definitely much appreciated.\n\nI just can't wait to see what they come not with because it's going to be a true taste of who they really are.",

I was really curious about the timing of this break and I always got a vibe that they were going to go out after 7.\n\nI even commented on a thread a few days ago that 7 was a farewell album, but for some reason (maybe holding for dear life for a Grammy award) they delayed it and have been relying on this \"memory road\" for too long (and it was kinda depressing, tbh).. I got a few down votes especially because I mentioned that this would probably be the last time in a while we would see BTS as OT7.. \n\nI thought we all could see this hiatus coming and it would be (at it latest) this year. I really didn't expect people to be so shocked about it...",

They were constantly going places, working on albums for days at a time, and each songwriter only got to put two songs on the album. There was a lot of pressure and it led to a great deal of drama with each other. \n\nAround 1980, Stevie nicks realized if she wanted to have the kind Of career that was fulfilling for her, she would have to go on her own to release all the music she had already written. So she told Fleetwood Mac her plans and they were distraught because with Stevie as the most popular, they though her going solo meant the end of the band. She promised them that this was just a side thing she would do when not working on Fleetwood Mac. And When they needed her, she\u2019d go back. \n\nAfter that, all the members of the band would work on solo music when not in Fleetwood Mac. With time to themselves and their own separate careers, there was a lot less restlessness in the group. going back to Fleetwood Mac when needed felt less like a chore and more like a fun group project like it\u2019s supposed to be. They go on tour now for the heck of it and not because of any pressure to. The two albums that followed their rise to success were hated by critics and sold poorly. Their first album after going solo, tango in the night, was their biggest hit since Rumors. BTS might just need something like that too. So that coming back to BTS will be a breath of fresh air after satisfying Solo careers. (Fleetwood Mac had way more drama amongst each other in large part caused by intense drug use. Mainly just comparing the affect solo careers had on the bands music as the separate success had more of a positive affect on their abilities while in many other cases for other groups, going solo was negative)",

After that Lindsey and Stevie were the main source of drama but they largely put up with it because Stevie was a good songwriter and Lindsey was a great producer and they both believed the music was more important. That is until after tango in the night when the group did break up and only reunited in 1997. The break was largely because Stevie was trying to force Lindsey to go on tour in a way he wasn\u2019t comfortable with and because of their prior history it caused the fallout between him and the band. The two of them have long standing issues that they put aside because they both think they\u2019re the best at what they do and do good work together. But since Rumors the main source of conflict has been touring schedules. That\u2019s why Lindsey left the band again in 2018. The Two of them just have different priorities. Stevie lives for touring, music and the road and has her whole career, while Lindsey likes to go on short stints when he feels comfortable to do so.",

Fans get attached to groups thanks to all the supplementary content which breeds a stronger love for the group/members. As soon as that content drip everyone is expecting stops, fans get frustrated and think it's company mistreatment, disbandment looming, etc... \n\nIn reality, there's very little done to protect artists in the entertainment industry when you're expected to \"play ball\" regardless of the situation. Only in the last few years have we seen companies start taking note of idols' mental health at all. \n\nWestern music doesn't operate at the crazy pace that the kpop industry runs on. Western artists usually space their albums out by at least a year, if not more. Promos don't involve weekly music shows, variety shows filmed at odd hours, etc.. In kpop, the scene moves so quickly and agencies are so money hungry that they are gonna try to maximize profit over the 7 years idols by any means necessary. If an idol burns out it's not the end of the world to these companies - there'll always be someone else willing to take their place. \n\nIt's a tradeoff. Almost all the top groups had to grind in the machine for years before seeing the cash *really* roll in, but it comes at a physical and mental cost. The fame and money that come with stardom will be worth it to most, but not all.",

I know there was some talk about the possibility of BTS all enlisting at the same time, but I'd say this is a pretty clear sign they're going to stagger it around their own activities. It will be a long time before they're all back together, but I think having some of them still creating and being active throughout the years is a much better option, especially considering they're obviously struggling with direction and inspiration as a group.",

It sounds good on paper but the numbers probably make way more sense when staggered over the next 5-6 years. Start solo activities, keep CF money coming, explore different avenues, etc. while a member or two are serving. I'm guessing a big reason why Jin's solo will come last is that he'll be the first to enlist (this year).",

There are a lot of responsibilities, pressure, and challenges they went through that were a first for them and a first for a group and a foreign act as a whole. It's also no lie that they had to represent their entire country for this long, and often were also seen as a soft power to SK. I don't know for you but if that were me I would be always under extreme stress. That burn-out is normal and I am glad they spoke freely about it.\n\nI think after everything they've achieved they deserve some time to recharge and do something fresh and different and take it a bit slower. They all probably wanna enjoy relationships and life and settle down and not be so wrapped up in having to represent something so huge.\n\nI am also kind of happy they chose to do it on their terms and timing, instead of letting media or time dictate it for them. I think it's somewhat smart to ''retreat'' when you are at your very peak, it keeps your legacy fresh and it makes people still want for more. I think not releasing a full album now is smart so if ever they do come together and drop a full album, it's gonna be nuts.\n\nHonestly the only thing I really hope for is that they still tour now and then down the line.",

There was no way they were just gonna do a best hits concert and then release another album. Then proof with just a few new songs and the rest celebrating their career. It was obvious but as a longtime army it\u2019s really bittersweet. At one time there was not even 10 armys in my entire city and now we just hosted BTS last technical tour until who knows when. Some of us have worked sooo hard to push them where they are at, and besides their exhaustion, we are exhausted as well lol. We literally grew with them I went from a lost high school kid to a degree holding adult with a job and an adult life with responsibilities. It was fun but youth is really over for us and it\u2019s time for the new youth to find their ways. \n\nNow it\u2019ll be exciting to see what they cook up for chapter 2. I guess no ot7 tour will be happening for a while then which is interesting because they are literally the biggest group and moneymakers in the world rn. They could randomly announce a concert and people would fly all over the world and bighit would make like 100mill from just that. It\u2019s so beautiful to see how honest they are and it really isn\u2019t about the money for them because what group would go on hiatus at their literal peak. Every company is salivating over getting a group as big as them. I don\u2019t know how big the fandom will be in the future considering a lot of us are nearing 30s and won\u2019t be able to drop everything for concerts (for the Vegas concerts I met ppl who spent over $10k for the whole trip, you guys are rich rich). \n\nI think it\u2019ll be interesting to see their solo endeavors and finally make some money off of them. They\u2019ve been releasing so much free music over the years like who releases mixtapes for free?? With no promo as well, their solos deserve promo and charting and all that fun stuff. \n\nI definitely think this is a good chance for people who were so emotionally invested to take a break and work on your own lives. ESPECIALLY younger fans to you guys this is like everything to you. So many things are happening in the world the inflation the stock market crashing we are growing older now it\u2019s time to be more aware of these things, BTS took the pressure to be ambassadors to create social awareness for things and we should really act upon that. This isn\u2019t easy to say but Kpop fans in general waste so much time watching content and browsing social media for hours to idolize how someone else lives their lives. Take some time to learn new things, hobbies, volunteer, get jobs, get degrees, have a LIFE. The takes im seeing on twitter convinces me this break will be healthy for ALL of us!",

When I was taking in all their music, I began to notice how, lacking for a better word, different it was to the rest of their discography.  Then Butter came out and I thought, \"yeah its closer to their regular stuff but still missing something\".  RM really put it into words I didn't want to say when he said that they were really lost with their direction.  I really hope he finds his answer and the group also find themselves in this as well.  \n\nStill was very happy saying they'll still be together, just not officially.

Knew this day was going to come eventually given the group has been together for so long and there was barely any solo activity previously but didn\u2019t think it was going to happen so soon given covid propelled Bangtan to more global fame as more people got into them during lockdown. It was bound to happen given the trajectory of other Kpop groups that have been together for 7 years - it\u2019s just the way it is given each member had sacrificed a lot of what they wanted to do and their individual colors in order to fit the group and completely understandable and healthy for them to want to be given a chance to show more of their individual colors, develop an identity and a name for themselves as a solo artist. They\u2019ve been feeling burned out for a while now so this seems like the right time to take a break and recharge. Namjoon talked about feeling like the group has lost its identity and direction - I know some older armys have voiced the same after the multiple English releases that have been more western pop focused. It reminds me of what BTS said on You Quiz - that it\u2019s better to land while at the peak rather than when you\u2019ve fallen. It\u2019s healthy to take a break when they know they\u2019re out of ideas rather than forcing themselves to put out products which they\u2019re not happy with. Really holding onto the hope that they will return from the group hiatus earlier than we think and I\u2019ll still get the chance to watch their concert live.",

It makes the fact that Proof was underwhelming hurt, we went from expecting the first new album in 1.5 years to an anthology to now we won't be getting a full group comeback until they're all back from military probably, which may be 5-6 years from now :(\n\nThat being said, anyone that actually believes they won't be back as a group is deluded. Group comebacks for them PRINT money, they're going to have many projects in the future especially as long as they are all under HYBE. And that doesn't even mention the fact that yes, they have an incredibly close bond as a group(no, they are obviously not a group that is playing it up for cameras/fans): they want to work together. Similar to my ults GOT7, where there's a will there's a way, and there are SO many fewer roadblocks to a BTS comeback than a GOT7 one. They'll be back.\n\nLastly, I have to wonder if the USA push from HYBE has lead to this. It's no secret that many fans aren't satisfied with their direction over the past 3ish years, I wonder if they as a group or certain members are also feeling dissatisfied with recent production and want to return to their more artistic and expressive roots. Ultimately I think we can all agree that their solo work for pretty much everyone in the group is really going to take off, and I'm excited to see what they've got in store.",

But this was inevitable, we've all been dreading it and it's finally come. I just want them to be happy and healthy and if this is the way they want to go about things then that's alright with me too.\n\nAlthough it's been a long time coming, we can still look forward to their solo music that's coming up soon, by the sounds of things quite a few of them have finished.

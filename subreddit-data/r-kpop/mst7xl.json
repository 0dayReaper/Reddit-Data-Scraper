I\u2019m genuinely so tired of reading of bullying between members because the companies are too incompetent to just do something about it. This why we read about so many idols that deal with mental health issues, because their companies are too apathetic and it seriously makes my blood boil. I really hope this poor girl gets the justice she deserves.",

I was fairly quiet and friends with like a small group of people back then. It was just a normal public school with average rating. Even the rowdy kids from the last class wasnt bullying others even though they often fight with other rowdy kids from the neighboring school. The only time i saw kid being picked on was during kindergarten just because they were fighting over toys.",

I still feel very nervous.\n\nThe company released an official statement that contradicts the actual truth and decided to sue my parents and my brother, who is still a young student.\n\nThe parents of the perpetrators (t/n: current APRIL members) sent hateful text messages to me and m parents as well.\n\nI hesitated a lot because I was worried what kinds of burdens I would face if I shined light on this situation with my own voice.\n\nNevertheless, I felt like I had to gather up my courage for the people who encouraged me and supported me. This is why I\u2019m writing this.\n\nThe harassment began from 2014, when we were preparing to debut, all the way to 2016, when I finally left the group. At the time, I was a 17 year old who lived in a dorm and prepared to debut. With no one to rely or lean on, I had to spend 24 hours with my bullies/harassers.\n\nI initially tried to endure this by myself but ultimately failed to; I told my parents everything. My parents then told the CEO. However, the CEO ended up repeatedly scolding and blaming me instead. Once the bullies heard about this, the harassment became even worse. The situation also worsened. I could only talk with my parents for a very short amount of time in front of my manager. It felt like I was getting smaller and smaller.\n\nThe stories that were revealed to the public are just a fraction of what really happened.\n\nFor three years, I faced continuous personal attacks in the form of physical and verbal abuse. And in the midst of this, it was extremely hard to deal with the personal attacks and insults that my precious grandmother, mother, father, and younger brother also went through. The company knew about this, but did not take any action.\n\nBecause of this, I fell into darkness, where there was no end in sight. I even made some extreme decisions (t/n: extreme decisions refers to her attempts). But it seemed like those people (t/n: referring to APRIL) just continued on with their lives without feeling any ounce of guilt or shame. The company moved on by giving a very plain and simple explanation (to the public), and I ended up leaving the group. Afterwards, I was faced with continual hate comments, insults, and the reputation that came along with betraying the group.\n\nI felt responsible for the enduring pain that my family suffered from. I tried really hard to live a brighter and healthier life.\n\nHowever, even as time goes by, memories of hardships do not disappear very easily.\n\nThe dark memories that remained in a corner of my mind soon became my trauma and swallowed me whole.\n\nI had a hard time because the people around me also had to experience bad things.\n\nBut in the midst of all of this, the people around gave me so much courage. This is why I am here today.\n\nI also want to gather up my courage for my younger brother and my loved ones.\n\nI have come to realize that there are so many people who supported me that I am thankful for.\n\nI was able to regain my strength because of the people who would ask about my condition and worry about me every single day.\n\nI also became aware of the fact that there are many people who faced similar pains as I did.\n\nI think that the harassment and bullying I faced in my younger years will remain in me as a trauma.\n\nI can\u2019t get along with every single person in this world, and I believe it\u2019s possible that people can develop hatred for me. However, I also believe that assault and bullying is never right and cannot be justified by any reason. I think that bullying and harassment should end, regardless of where it happens and to whom it happens.\n\nEven after 7 years have passed, I continue to struggle because of my trauma and the memories. But I do not think I can continue to live in resignation and despair, feeling like I will never recover from this.\n\nI want to show the people who faced similar struggles like I have that victims can recover from their wounds and live healthy and happy lives again.\n\nI also want to repay the people who support me by showing them that I can overcome this situation.\n\nI want to sincerely thank everyone for giving me strength and for your continued support. You have given me so much courage.\n\nAt the moment, all of my activities that are managed by my company have been halted, and the company unilaterally decided to cancel any new work or offers that have come to me without discussions.\n\nThe company also notified me that it is not possible to cancel my exclusive contract with them.\n\nIn order to protect myself and my family and my loved ones, I will not stand still anymore.\n\nAlong with the people who support me, I will fight the company\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nIt will not be easy, but after I climb out of my harsh past, I want to take care of this situation well and, through various schedules and promotions, show you a healthier and brighter side of me that can overcome these things.\n\nTo the people who read this and to myself, I hope that April will be a month full of happiness and warmth.\n\nThank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslation of related article:\n\nFormer APRIL Lee Hyunjoo addressed the controversy involving her and APRIL members through an Instagram post.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe company released an official statement that contradicts the actual truth and decided to sue my parents and my brother, who is still a young student.

I know of at least 2 (current/former?) groups that were physically assaulted by staff of their company with knowledge or participation of the CEO. Both had members come forth and make these accusations, with all of them seemingly quite credible.\n\nBut each group still had members that stayed with the company. And while the fans believed the accusations, they rallied around the remaining members in support until disbandment. So basically the fandoms reacted with even MORE loyalty towards the group/members, which obviously translates to money for the company.\n\nAs far as I know both companies are still around, though both were quite small as far as I know. And I haven't heard much about them or their group since (but then as I said they were small companies and I hadn't heard of these groups/companies either pre-scandal).\n\nThis isn't the only time though. Fandoms will only seemingly get more motivated to rally around their group if cases of mistreatment are exposed.\n\nExo, Blackpink and Got7 are three groups I know of where I regularly heard at various points in time of fandoms using company mistreatment as motivation to organize things that would directly financially benefit the company in turn.\n\nI mean CLC's Sorn basically admitted that Cube had given up on her and her group. And that she needed to get 5 million views on her homemade solo MV for them to continue giving them any attention whatsoever. Fans have been desperately trying to get her those views, even though Cube is basically making money without putting in even a shred or work or a single rotten cent and profiting solely on her hard work and that of her fans.\n\nThis is no shade to those groups or fandoms though! It's just a shitty situation. If company mistreatment is an issue than without fan support the idols will only sink into a worse position and likely face even worse treatment. But in supporting them you are also inevitably supporting the company and sending the signal that mistreating idols comes without consequence.\n\nTheir really is no way for either fans or idols to win in these kind of situations.",

And tbh I didn't expect all of them to renew. Usually when members leave the group it gets tougher to keep the fandom engaged and growing. And Naeun was seemingly getting a lot of opportunities.\n\nConsidering all that, how Kard had seemingly been gaining some traction and how a new group was about to be launched... I, personally, didn't really see DSP holding on to April for much longer anyway. Even if some of the girls had resigned. Newer contracts usually means better terms for the idols, so less net profit for the company and with less members in April and more groups to manage. I think April would've quickly taken the back burner in order for DSP to promote Kard and their new rookies.\n\nHave they lost money by losing April? Yes probably. But honestly their biggest loss here is probably Naeun. Kard has a large international fanbase, many of which are completely oblivious to Somin's alleged role in this. So, personally, I think Kard will be alright for the most part. Even if not I think launching BM as a solo artist would always be a decent plan B. He's apparently been working on that anyway and is well-liked by international fans. So if their rookie group takes off (which kind of seems to be the case) it could still work out for them.\n\nBut then with Covid it's hard to say. I'm sure many companies have resorted to finding wealthy backers or taking out loans. If DSP is able to secure funds to tide them over for now I think they could bounce back.\n\nBut this April shit needs to go away fast in order to salvage Somin's reputation.",

Plus they were teenagers, you're bound to quarrel. \n\n Hyori was something of a diva, racing for the best outfits and accessories and even having a wind fan \"follow\" her on stage so her hair flies. She used to go out clubbing while the girls practiced until late night. She admitted herself if it weren't for age, she wouldn't have been leader because she sucked at teamwork.\n\n Plus Lee Jin is devout Catholic and Hyori atheist. They didn't get along well, Yuri was Jin's BFF and Joohyun was the social one/the glue of the group so eventhough it became Hyori and the others, Joohyun kept the members from not drifting apart too far.\n\nDue to Joohyun's efforts, Hyori and Jin remained friends and in their reunion last year Hyori and Jin confessed and made amends, and now are much closer than before.",

And we've seen countless times how fans will rally around groups or artists after company mistreatment is exposed to support groups even more.\n\nNot sure what the future for Kard will be. But I'm pretty sure that they'll at least give it a good swing at launching BM as a solo artist. I think his solo debut was all but done right? As he does a bunch of the music stuff himself, that'll save them a bunch of money and effort. And he's probably the most well-known member amongst international fans and pretty well-liked in general. A lot of people got to know him through his podcast with Dive studios.\n\nSo if his solo takes off and they promote him well in SK (and their new rookies hold up). They could possibly salvage their burning wreck of a company.\n\nIt's too bad that their Sechskies reunion a few years back had that incredibly ill-timed scandal. If that had worked out for them they might've had more money in the bank to tide them over.\n\nThey would've just been SO much better off if they'd issued a generic apology straight away and just let April fade away into obscurity. They really fucked themselves over royally. April and Naeun became one of the biggest stories in this wave of bullying accusations due to their inability to handle it quickly and quietly.",

We have contemplated and hesitated several times about clearly delivering the agency\u2019s stance on this matter. The members have also been spending the days with frustration over the criticism and misunderstandings about them. We have also been well aware of the fact that there is a lot of criticism regarding the agency and the members.\n\n&gt; Though we repeatedly contemplated revealing our stance, we decided that the recovery of Kwon Mina\u2019s health is the current priority.\n\n&gt; We concluded that explaining and refuting the things that are being said and publicly deciding on what is right and wrong in this situation will only produce more sensational issues and will not contribute to resolving the situation. We have also discouraged the AOA members from making individual statements even though they had wished to. We came to the conclusion that showing each of their statements in front of the public and having fights occur over those statements would not be the right way of resolving the situation.",

Especially because we've seen how DSP (and to a lesser extent Cube) have really bungled dealing with bullying allegations.\n\nReading though Hyunjoo's statement, it seems like DSP's statement sort of aligns with what Hyunjoo is saying, but it's interesting to see how vastly their perspective differs.\n\nOverall, it seems like what both sides agree on is that Hyunjoo initially didn't want to debut in April, was convinced to do so, struggled to keep up with everyone else in the group once she debuted, and was iced out by the other members for \"not pulling her weight\".\n\nThe main point of contention is that DSP chalked things up to \"normal mean girl drama due everyone being stressed\" while Hyunjoo is alleging both physical and verbal abuse.\n\nBut yeah, with DSP straight up suing her whole family and preventing her from working, it's a REALLY bad look for them.\n\nReal talk, APRIL and Naeun are done. There's no coming back from this for them. I just hope Rachel and Chaekyung can form a duo or become actors or something. Because they don't deserve to sink with everyone else since they weren't involved in this.\n\nAlso, I'm curious what this means for Somin, as this seems to be the first time Hyunjoo connects Somin to this. DSP might just not care given KARD is a touring group, but if they keep her, it may prevent them from promoting on things like variety or music shows in Korea.",

It was so sketchy when DSP said she left the group to be an actress, but she joined the show.\n\nI wish there's something I can do to help her.",

A teenager working 12-16 hours a day, getting abuse, poor working conditions, unfair contracts, etc, would be illegal in many countries. But in Korea, authority gets the benefit of the doubt, not the individual, just the history and nature of Korean culture. This poor girl went to pursue her dream and it turned into a nightmare, that could cause harm to her entire family and her mental health, but also could loom as financial ruin for her entire family. I hope she and her family have the deep pockets, patience, and sheer determination to see it through.",

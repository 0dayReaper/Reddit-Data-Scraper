Seeing this all unfold and lead up to this, feels great as a fan, but I can't imagine all the emotions the 4 of them feel now. I hope the Korean public continues to support them and their company doesn't fuck this up for them and not capitalize further on this opportunity.",

While it never got trsction amongst the GP, it was a surprising smash hit in the military where it was *extremely* popular. Even so, Brave Girls was on the verge of disbandment when [this video](https://youtu.be/cfHWIqJkEf4) showing a compilation of Brave Girls performing at military bases with comments from service members went viral. Rollin' shot up the charts and hit #1, with the Brave Girls suddenly restarting promotions from the song and going on music shows. And now they've gotten their first win.\n\nIt really is a touching and awesome story, considering the group was talking about disbanding *one week* before the video was posted. A massive turnaround.",

I know this lineup didn't join Brave Girls until 2016, but the group technically debuted in 2011 so they got their first win after TEN YEARS! But even if you count from 2016, the first win after five years and with a FOUR YEAR OLD SONG is incredible. Unprecedented. \n\nI'm so happy for them, to be working so hard for so long with nothing to show for it but then all of a sudden getting elevated to this position. Magic. I just hope they can continue this success with a proper comeback too. Their songs have always been good, including the pre-2016 ones. They've just been ignored, but Brave Brothers can compose mastahpeeces.",

Extraordinary, this win will go down in Kpop history.\n\nTo have a first win on a public broadcast channel and Perfect All Kill on all charts in a week is just mind blowing. And they did this as an almost 10 year old group and using a 4 year old song.\n\nDid they say if any group achieves a first win, their fortunes and successes will be all set? I really hope that Brave Ent doesn't fuck up their future schedules now. Well even if they do, I believe they will be able to find new careers and opportunities with their new statuses now.\n\nI hope this win will also inspire all the Elrises/Weki Mekis, Fromis_9s and other under the radar girl goups.

They are SO deserving of it, and Inkigayo as a first win is even better since it's usually considered the hardest to get first wins on! Whether you count it as taking 10 years (from the group's inception) or 5 (from the current lineup's addition), it's still a multi-record-breaking win: longest to a first win, and the largest gap from song release to win! Just absolutely insane. They've become a wall on the charts. 14 PAKs and counting. Minyoung mentioned that their dream would be to win on a music show and they DID. And it's only the start! It's been so amazing watching Rollin take off and seeing how genuinely happy and excited the girls are to be back on stage. *This* is how Rollin should've been promoted years ago (no sexy vampire concept, since it's a fun and uplifting song, no lyrics controversy), but at the same time, if it was, we wouldn't have the absolutely crazy, history-making moments we do. As a fan since the OG Rollin era and always hoping BG would pull through to get notoriety, I am just thrilled. I hope many more wins and success come! &lt;3",

It is not just about the song Rollin. \nYes, it has to do with Viral video but it is much deeper than that.\nThey went to more than 100 military shows. people now found out about that through viral video and have respect for that hard work. military shows usually don't pay much at all. maybe transport fees. but they went more than 100 times. Idols usually do not want to go perform in these shows maybe once a year. but brave girls even went to a place no idols went to 12 hours drive just for the show and every show they gave it all. you can see it in a youtube video. people now found out about it. it is not just about the song 'rollin'. it is much more than that. you really need to understand why Korea is loving brave girl so much right now.\nit has a lot to do with these girls went to all these military shows, and the general public did not know it. That hit hard. plus they were about to disband two days before the viral video came out. It was really heartbreaking as well. This group is a 10-year-old group. (These 4 members were from 2016) Never had a chance to shine. People want this group to get what they deserve, also became a fan by knowing their personality. \npeople want to support them for what they've done all these years.\n\n&gt; This is the one video that went viral Changed their life. (It has an ENGLISH subtitle so turn it on) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfHWIqJkEf4\nonly a few days before this video was uploaded member of Brave girl talked about going to work at the cafe on their Instagram live. 2 girls were already moved out from the company to their home. then this video went viral. after 2 days later the song 'rollin' went to about No.20 on the chart. but girls did not want to have high hope and have let down again. but it went No.1 the next day. You can see how surprised it was for them on their SNS posting. They thought it was just for a moment. but it got bigger and bigger. the whole nation was going crazy over these girls. They had only 10 people in their fan club like 3 weeks ago. so basically their life changed during the last 2 weeks. They just won 1st prize on Inkigayo today!\nafter the viral video\npeople are discovering these videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIagkQyJLmE&amp;t=1717s\nshowing how hard they worked without anyone knowing.  going around the country. performing for the military. It really touched people's hearts + the story of they were just about to quit the group.\nand also the company for not dropping the group for 10 years even though the group was not making any money. the CEO kept saying ' it is okay you are going to be big one day' He kept saying it to them. He produces songs to make money so he can keep this group. That is why they respect the CEO so much.\n\n&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCuPBYhz6ns\nThis is an interview video but it is in Korean, with no subtitle. she is saying all of those things I wrote up there. They had really low self-esteem. right before they blew up.",

This is definitely up there with EXID, CLC, and Girls Day for first wins for me, but feels even bigger because it came out of literally nowhere it felt like there was literally no remaining hype for them prior to this. They\u2019d used up all chances of making it. I bet they feel so vindicated.\n\nI hope we get to see more instances of this happening to other struggling groups (Laboum next please!) and I hope this is the beginning of a long and successful career for Brave Girls finally!",

There was no oxygen for them at this time 4yrs ago.  You had the end of i.o.i, TWICE released Knock Knock and was clearly taking over for Girls Generation, Ailee's single from Goblin, not to mention releases by several of the top boy groups during this time.",

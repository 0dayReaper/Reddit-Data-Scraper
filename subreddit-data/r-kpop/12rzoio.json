He's probably scrambling to go to Korea and meet his bandmates. Both Sanha and Moonbin just got back from BKK so Sanha probably went to sleep tired, yet happy. Fuck, even Sua had her MC schedules and her win with Billlie. No one could have expected thier lives would change less than 24 hrs later. \n\n&gt;!Fuck, the idea that Eunwoo probably said goodbye to Moonbin before leaving, not realizing it would be his last time...!&lt;\n\nI really hope all of the members don't beat themselves over this, because I know the SHINee members went through the same thing.",

Over 3000 miles away, somewhere in my childhood bedroom, probably hidden in a binder, is a signed polaroid of you from debut era that I have treasured for so so long. I really dove into my Korean studies when I wanted to help translate Ok! Ready, so that other people could see your charm, too.

Not to mention KPop idols are in a system that heavily promotes a parasocial relationship with them.

Moonbin became an idol because of the feeling he wanted to invoke on stage and reach the hearts of his fans even if he didn't know them all individually. You received his message and dreams the way he always wished. \n\nIt's not like you're equalizing the pain or grief you feel that his parents or siblings or best fiends may feel.

Still, even then, social media wasn't the monster it is today. So be careful! Remember your right to disconnect and take care of yourselves.

He never gave up on them, and always wished for the best thing to happen to each and every person that he had met. The radiant smile that he had was something of amazing quality that I admired and wanted to portray in kind.\n\nI read the headline, and my heart broke, shattered into pieces like in undertale\u2019s game over screen. I was in class when I saw this, and it really hurt, and I couldn\u2019t focus on work. When I came back after class, I had looked through both Twitter and the discord servers I\u2019ve been a part of, and saw the greatest amount of love and happiness that he had put on many people, amongst my friends old and new, amongst people I currently have issues with at the moment, as well as people amongst the community of Kpop. \n\nTwo things stuck to me the most:\n\n1). Moonbin was the best friend a person could ask for. Amongst his idol friends like Eunwoo and SinB, he always had a good time with them, and had loads of fun. The positivity he had spread was something that I wished so much to have, and always tried my hardest to work on, to be a better person, a much more happy and positive individual.\n\n2). (More personal) Moonbin was the definition of the best big brother in existence. He cared a lot, wished the best, and did everything he could to protect his little sister, and the bond that the both of them shared was something that I truly admired and wanted between me and my own sister. It broke me to hear the news on many different levels because of it, as the impact he had on Moon Sua\u2019s life was immaculate and unending, and that eternal bond that a brother and sister have, is something I wish to have with my own sister, one where no matter what happens, we always have each others back till the very end. \n\n\nMoonbin was a role model to me, no matter if Astro was or was not a bias group, and I want more than anything to live by what he had done, and become a better friend, a better brother, a better person, no matter what.",

I don't follow his music career but I've seen videos of him plenty of times on twitter and he always seemed like such a nice and sweet guy... I really feel so sad right now. Sending lots of strength to his family and everyone who loved and supported him.",

It\u2019s time to rethink how we treats idols and fans of kpop alike. A lot of the blame can fall on the industry for forcing idols to only express happiness and gratitude when they may be secretly suffering. But, I also hope that fans of all groups use this as a reminder to be kind because the people you are mocking or doxxing on the internet are human. I think this industry/fandom has a huge issue with proportionality when critiquing/calling out others to a point where people are doing disgusting things in the name of kpop. We should adopt a default mindset of kindness or at least neutrality towards others.",

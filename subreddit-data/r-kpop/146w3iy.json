Except this MV is with gray filter. Paris is the right choice for its background and the kids whole outfits are just on-point. This MV suits the song.\n\n\nI know SKZ usually work withe their favourite directors like Bang Jae Yeop and NOVVKIM but pretty sure this is not their work coz BJY only do their title tracks and NOVVKIM has his distinctive style. Then again, NOVVKIM is quite versatile.",

Just look at how many million seller girl groups we had back then (just Blackpink probably) and how many we have now (people will call groups like nmixx that make close to 1 mil underperforming these days\u2026.). It all needs to be viewed in its current environment. \n\nI wish the fromis girls the best, but as a buddy\u2026 I\u2019m still having whiplash from what happened back then and I still have a hard time supporting source because of it.

If they were under a smaller agency, 100k per comeback would be considered good... but when HYBE have multiple million sellers under their roster now, I'm guessing fromis_9 won't be getting a contract renewal.... even if the girls wanted to continue.",

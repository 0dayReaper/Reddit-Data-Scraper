            "comment": "How to actually do this for maximum impact: \n\nDebut your official U.S. website with the debut of an ENG version of one of their hit songs, only viewable/listenable on this new website. That drives a ton of traffic to the site. How you capitalize? Debut an AESPA special limited edition collection of merch. Clothes, accessories, whatever, and sell them on the site. First come first serve, limited supply. Maybe even co-designed by the members. Or at least they picked out the designs they thought were best from all the provided design samples. Heck, if the song is audio only on the site, have a mini docu-movie only viewable on the site showing the BTS of their practicing and recording the ENG version and another video of the company and the members working on the merch. Show them making design decisions that you see reflected in the available merch. \n\nI genuinely don't get why streaming celebs, content creator houses and gaming orgs (in the States) have merch lines of all sorts that sell like hot cakes but Kpop doesn't really seem to. There's no reason for SM to not have a partnership with a design studio who helps them make dope branded merch that they sell. At worst you sell a ton of it to the groups stans, at best the merch is so dope it starts to bleed into the mainstream (in SK). \n\nI don't understand it even more for a group like BP. That group just screams make a clothing brand called Blackpink, make dope clothes that fit the groups image/styles and have the members help with the design choices and they would sell so well. I could easily imagine a \"Blackpink\" line of girls shoes, bags, skirts, t-shirts, and jackets that breaks into the mainstream they are so trendy and stylish. Yet there's not even an attempt. I don't get it.",

Even those who just ship within their own country can really struggle to get things up and running with merch lines. Just because SM/HYBE/YG/JYPE are big companies doesn't mean they can design merch, go through the concept phase, the prototype phase and the final manufacturing phases in 2 months or something like that. Now add that I am talking about, in this case, setting it up in America when the companies are based in SK. Not to mention they should have all this (merch) going from SK and for sale internationally... this is something they need to be working on for 6 months minimum but realistically like a year. Finding suppliers, manufacturers, a distribution company to partner with takes very real time and then they need to find a design studio (artists) they partner their internal art department and their idols with to make the designs. This is the type of thing you gotta have up and ready to go before a comeback. When the comeback first starts getting planned out, the title track chosen and the art design concepts for the album art, M/V and so on, then the art team, design company and idols all collab together to come up with the best designs for the merch. Those then go into production and then after a month or three, when the comeback happens, they have the merch in stock ready to be put up for sale.\n\nAll of that is real work that takes real time, effort, skill and money. But again, if video game team companies (like [100 Thieves](https://100thieves.com/)), content creators houses (like [Offline TV](https://offlinetv.com/)), singular content creators (like [Pokimane](https://pokimerch.com/)) and even tech companies (like [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.lttstore.com/)) can have merch lines, then these companies that are valued at 100's of millions if not billions can too. And like I said, at the very least they will sellout to the groups stans if medium sized runs are manufactured, so it's not like it's a risky venture. They're guaranteed to make a profit as long as they don't have some big manufacturing disaster that sets them back a year or ruins a ton of product.",

Thank you for the history factoid. \n\nI would be inclined, personally, to avoid company based merch seeing as it would really mainly only appeal to company stans and that's a super niche market. Why do that when you can appeal directly to the fans of the artists themselves? \n\nAs for pricing, yeah, really expensive is moronic. Make it expensive enough that people feel like they are buying something nice that not everyone will have while also delivering on the quality people would expect for that price. But we aren't talking luxury brand level prices. No dresses for $700, T-shirts for $75 and shoes for $300 type of stuff. I'm fine with \"special editions\" or \"limited runs\" or a \"luxury line\" where the prices are like that but they are like that because the products cost more to make and therefore are higher quality and more unique. Say Blackpink put out a limited run of Jennie designed bags, Lisa designed shoes, Jisoo leisure wear sweats and Rose dresses. Due them being a new designs and made to a higher quality, the price would need to go up and due to them being a limited run they'd be unique and rare so YG could charge more (luxury tax). So then the sweats being $200, the shoes being $250, the bag being $700 and the dress being $250 aren't so bad.",

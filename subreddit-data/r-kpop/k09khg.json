Younger me couldn't even dream of an act like BTS. I am so ecstatic for them and for all of the young Asians who get to see representation for themselves on such a big scale. Congratulations BTS, completely deserved!!",

But man BTS really took that opportunity and ran miles with it. When I saw RM speak at the BBMAs  I knew BTS was the real deal and hope that change could come, that if anything can make the American industry accept foreign Asian artists, it was the overpowering charm and boundless ambition of BTS.\n\nHats off to you, BTS. You deserve it. Even if you don't end up winning the award, you have already won.",

Every single place I went to, Dynamite was blasting on the speakers, and guess what, IT STILL IS. I get so confused sometimes did my phone hook up to the car?? Nope! The top radio stations are still playing Dynamite every 5 minutes. Really humbling to remember the times we used to beg radio to even acknowledge BTS :( look how far they\u2019ve come, as an Army who was there trying to get 1 million in 24 hours for the I Need U MV, this is just insane. I would get hundreds of downvotes and replies on tweets just daring to predict BTS would be the first non big3 to win a daesang. Lmao",

They sometimes do 2 second song clip quizzes over the P.A. system during lunch and almost every answer is always a Twice song. The 5th graders had actually been practicing the TT dance moves for the past month for a school festival this past weekend too. I had never even heard of Twice until I started working at this school lol",

Here's their song, '[A girl like me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQxtwvLUByM)'. They have two other music videos, IIRC, 'Wonderland' and 'Ice Chu' (which is technically by a subgroup of gugudan, only two of the members are in that song/video).\n\nA less similar sounding kpop singer is Lim Kim. Here's her song ['Awoo'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXPADwU05OQ).\n\nAs has been recommended to you already, you should check out Red Velvet. My favorite song from them is ['Dumb Dumb'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0)",

Dahyun has really started to come into her own as being a rapper, and Chaeyoung just absolutely killed it. Momo was apparently allowed to choreo her own dance break, Jeongyeon allowed to show her vocals more than \"Jihyo's lines with sung slightly different\", which was an absolute disservice up until now. Sana getting more attention/focus after being snubbed for their Japanese release, Mina getting to center for a lot of the dances as well. Tzuyu even sounds improved, and of course is as gorgeous as ever. Jihyo and\nNayeon \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nHonestly I've always sort of enjoyed their releases, but outside of TT I couldn't really get super into any of their songs, but this changed that!",

Cant wait for the dance break live as well .\n\n\n From start to finish this song there was no part which was unpleasant . Black eye pilseung is the perfect fit for TWICE. Hope they keep up with this style of song in the future release :) \n\n\n",

Sana's parts are earwormy as hell and the good kind, and I love the line distribution this go-around. Although I do agree that waiting on Chaeyoung/Dahyun's part was a bit nerve-racking and there wasn't enough Chaeyoung in general but that isn't going to deter me from the song, tbh. It's still good stuff.\n\nI don't wanna rank it ;_; I don't think it surpasses my personal favorite title track of theirs but it's definitely in the top...3? There's only one title track I actually and vehemently don't like, so I guess it's a top 5 if I omit that one lol. Regardless I don't wanna rank it just yet. Too busy jamming to bother ranking.",

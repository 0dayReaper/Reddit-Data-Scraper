    "postText": "**Welcome back, folks!**\n\n### Key points TL;DR\n\n* r/kpop, r/kpophelp, and r/kpoppers have been completely frozen with no new posts/comments for two days. You haven't missed anything.\n* Comments are back to normal. Comment freely!\n* ~~Posts are not yet back to normal. We will temporarily be **APPROVAL-ONLY**. (see explanation below)~~\n* Any content released over the last two days can be posted now.\n* Consolidating related content is appreciated, but not required. Mods will use their own discretion to determine what makes the most sense to approve.\n\n### ~~Temporary Approval-Only for Posts~~\n\n&gt; **Update: We're back to normal now. You'll see your posts shortly after you submit them unless they get caught by some other filter.**\n\nThere will be a huge influx of posts as we catch up with the content from the last 48 hours during the blackout.  Moderators will be dealing with chaos on our end as we try to carefully and quickly approve good submissions in the appropriate order. APPROVAL-ONLY means that *you* will not see this chaotic explosion of posts in the New queue. You will just see what we approve, which will hopefully make things a lot smoother on your end. DO NOT keep posting the same content repeatedly if you don't immediately see your post in the queue. You should assume your post is in *our* queue and it will take us a while to get to it.\n\n**Please be patient as we steadily approve posts!**\n\nWe will maintain this setting until the stream of content calms down and we'll update that here once we fully switch back to normal. Help us out by reporting duplicates or reposts if we miss something.\n\n### Expect Instability\n\nThere will likely be hundreds of subreddits becoming active again all around the same time and over the next day, so be prepared for Reddit to be unstable. Posts and comments might be slow. Try to be patient! If you're noticing glitches or something is not loading for you, give it a few minutes before you post or comment again to avoid duplication errors.\n\n### On the blackout and Reddit API Updates\n\nr/ModCoord has an excellent post that covers developments during the primary blackout. \n\n&gt; [Indefinite Blackout: Next Steps, Polling Your Community, and Where We Go From Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/)\n\nMost of us remain very unsatisfied with Reddit's response to this whole situation. The API pricing, the short-notice to developers, the terrible communication, the frustrating inadequacy of the response to accessibility concerns, and many other issues are still weighing on us. As moderators we have no choice but to pay attention since any developments are critical to the work we do in our subreddits.\n\nSome subreddits will continue with indefinite blackouts and we appreciate and support their efforts. As r/kpop serves a uniquely centralized point of K-Pop content aggregation on the internet, we do not feel this would be the right choice for our community at this time. We may participate in alternate 'Solidarity' efforts akin to those mentioned in the r/ModCoord post linked above, but we will warn you again ahead of time and potentially open a discussion with the community to get your thoughts and ideas.\n\nWe have a Town Hall we have been trying to get to for two months that has been delayed due to tragedy, industry scandal, and our own busy lives. And we have an Achievements-focused post we want to get to that has been long-delayed as well. These will have our most immediate attention in the coming weeks. (Edit: Also, the upcoming Census. Thanks for the reminder, Nish!)\n\nBut the larger issues with Reddit will continue to be on our minds. New moderation tools have been promised in the second half of the year and we will be watching those developments with acute interest. This blackout was just a shot across the bow and we know moderators and users can unite in spectacular fashion because we've now seen it in real time. This will matter in the future if Reddit continues to undermine the people that bring all the value to their platform.",

I honestly don't know where I would get my news if mods continued the blackout. I mostly follow kpop and sports and while I do have alerts on from The Score app, I still feel like I miss out on a good amount of stuff. For kpop the big thing I'm waiting for is an update on Hwasa's contract with RBW. I know it goes until the end of the month but I still feared that chance of \"omg what if something happens when Reddit is blacked out\"",

Multiple users have expressed how it's impossible to break into the clique if you don't hold the same opinions as them/don't vibe with their personalities (esp if you say you aren't a fan of their favorite groups) and the site has barely any active users. The only threads that remain active are the plastic surgery thread and the \"which idol is gay\" thread, mostly because the majority of active users have migrated to a discord group which is just the clique.

I can't lie and say I'm not disappointed that you are not taking a stronger stance, for disabled users especially who will basically get kicked out of the platform by the end of June.\n\nI don't see how r/kpop is an essential or vital subreddit yet you draw a lot of traffic, making things great for the CEO and not-so-great for the cause you are saying you support. I would like to understand you better because I'm pretty disappointed in your actions. Thanks.",

You are the very definition of the type of reddit page that could have an impact by blacking out longer. \n\nAt least give the community the choice of whether to close down again.",

It feels like every platform nowadays is trashing their active userbase that are providing the quality content that made the platform thrive in the first place...\n\nEdit: hmm others brought up a good point about how this act isn't helping much, but i do agree with mods that this community isn't ready for such a change. Maybe opening up discussion about migration to other platforms could help?",

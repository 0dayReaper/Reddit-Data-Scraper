Still, SM has maintained the unfair stance that they will not provide copies of this information.\u201d\n\n&gt;In addition, he stated, \u201cSM Entertainment has committed grossly unfair aggression in attempting to claim a minimum contract period of 17\u201318 years and using its status as a considerable agency to force additional exclusive contracts/extensions, following exclusive contracts of 12\u201313 years. When considering the lengthy trainee period, SM Entertainment is coercing artists into what can only be described as so-called slave contracts lasting over 20 years.\u201d (1)\n\n(1) in case this is not clear, this allegation by the artists is that sm is coercing artists into signing long extensions to their original contracts. if you have an initial 12-year contract and want to extend, sm is alleged to negotiate, \"you have to extend long enough to hit at least 18 years total, our minimum, or we won't renew with you\" \u2014 and this forces you into *at least* a 6-year renewal/extension opposed to the typical 2\u20133-year renewal/extension. these extensions would be even longer if they take place well before the end of the initial contract period, which can be considered suspicious business practice. there is no suggestion sm is forcing an ADDITIONAL 18 years; it's 18 years (or more, i guess) total, including the length of the original contract. i see a popular tweet circulated the suggestion of an additional 17\u201318 years but it has since been deleted.\n\n* **[SM Entertainment's response:](https://www.soompi.com/article/1591099wpp/sm-suspects-third-party-is-behind-baekhyun-xiumin-and-chens-contract-termination-notice-bpm-entertainment-responds)**\n\n&gt;Hello, this is SM Entertainment.\n\n&gt;Through the SM 3.0 strategy that we announced at the beginning of this year, the agency presented our new vision as a leading global entertainment company. Thus, while continuing to improve corporate governance accordingly, we are fiercely working hard to meet the high expectations of fans.\n\n&gt;However, we have detected an external influence taking advantage of the time when we were focusing our abilities to prepare to take a new leap by approaching our artists with false information and delivering wrong legal assessment, making unconventional proposals such as persuading them that it is okay to ignore their exclusive contracts with us and to sign contracts with them. Even though they don\u2019t sincerely care about the artists at all, the external influence is committing illegal acts by using false rumors, slander, and flattery to lure artists into making misjudgments, violating their exclusive contracts, and signing additional contracts [that would breach the exclusivity of the pre-existing contract].\n\n&gt;We confirmed that the external force did not only stop at luring our agency\u2019s artists into violating their valid exclusive contracts with us, but they also lured other artists from our company to violate their exclusive contracts or to sign additional contracts through the relevant artists.\n\n&gt;These attempts by the external force are clearly illegal, encouraging conflicts between our company and artists as well as between the artists while also having a hidden agenda of wanting to collapse the existing team. This attempt cannot be tolerated as it fundamentally destroys the trust of fans who send infinite love and support, and it is an illegal act that cannot be excused for the sound future of the entire K-pop industry.\n\n&gt;Therefore, we will not stand idle to the movements of those who only pursue monetary greed and do not pay any attention in the slightest to essential details such as the future of our artists or their legitimate legal rights, and we will take all legal action possible. This is because if we do not do that, the reputation and image of our artists could be severely damaged by the actions of those who are only taking care of their own interests as well as have a negative impact on the future of promising artists.\n\n&gt;The agency will respond strongly to illegal actions by the impure external force, and we will work hard to show how we meet the high expectations of fans who sincerely love the artists.\n\n&gt;Thank you.\n\n* [Big Planet Made's response](https://www.soompi.com/article/1591099wpp/sm-suspects-third-party-is-behind-baekhyun-xiumin-and-chens-contract-termination-notice-bpm-entertainment-responds)\n\n* **[megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/13xkqav/megathread_exo_chen_baekhyun_and_xiumin_vs_sm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1)**",

He's been speaking about his dissatisfaction with SM for a while.\n\nI remember during promotions for SuperM, he talked about how he had suggested ideas for the group to management over the phone, hoping it could be his contribution as the group's leader, and instead he got shouted at until his dinner was cold. It was played off as a joke for the show, but the fact that it happened, well. And apparently, that is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nFrankly, the cracks go back as early as 2014 when Kris, Lu Han, and Tao all sued their way out of their contracts over the shitty pay, being overworked in spite of injury and illness, etc. Clearly, SM didn't change even after that. They just got better at hiding their bullshit.",

I remember KBS made the excuse of JYJ having a lawsuit at the time and therefore, couldn't appear on Music Bank, only for them to say later that, that piece of information was old news and they could in fact appear assuming they have an album to promote, only for them to state again later that they couldn't appear on music bank due to their lawsuit battle.\n\nI also remember that i think Mnet or one the cable networks filmed some stuff with Jaejoong and SM pressured them not to show it on their channel and as a result, Mnet gave the footage to C-Jes Entertainment. There were other stuff but i think i said enough.\n\nThe only way they could promote and appear on TV was through acting since SM did not have a lot of power within the acting industry.\n\n\\- Hangeng from Suju filed a lawsuit because of the discrimination he had faced as the only foreigner of the group in regards to payment, opportunities, overworked, not being able to see family in years etc. There was also a story where the manager at the time pull out an IV drip directly from his veins because they had to go to a scheduled activity.\n\n\\- Luhan, Tao and that other guy who I'm not gonna mention because of how much of an a\\*\\*hole he is filed lawsuits due to the same reasons as Hangeng and came to an agreement to continue their contracts with them until it expires when they promote in Korea or Japan and some other finer details. In other words, those 3 weren't ever going to promote there because China has more money for them to make.\n\n\\- Jessica from SNSD got essentially blacklisted from Korean TV and the broadcasting stations mades excuses like schedule conflicts etc. which we know was SM pressuring the broadcasting stations to not allow her to appear on Korean TV. Also references and mentions of her were erased as much possible e.g. fellow sm idols referred to SNSD as 8 members or covered her appearance in all the snsd posters. Since then, she has been promoting in China and is quite popular from people have been saying on the webs.\n\nNow some of the other members of EXO are filing lawsuits for essentially the same seasons as the others. Do not give me started on the whole HYPE and SM debacle. SM Entertainment has been taking L's lately and seemingly will continue that way for the foreseeable future.\n\nAre they even still the big power house they were back in the day?",

I have no doubt that from a legal perspective this has been in the works for a while with multiple contingencies in place in case SM did get their act together, etc. \n\nThe final straw was the seven requests for a settlement statement (I.e., financial transparency) and if they couldn\u2019t come up with it by the end of the month, they\u2019d be leaving on June 1. I don\u2019t doubt they made sure that everything was as watertight as it could possibly be and I have no doubt that SM is not shocked since the law firm had previously been the one sending the letters. I do wonder if SM thought contract termination was an empty threat or bluff OR if they\u2019re such an internal hot mess they couldn\u2019t actually come up with the settlement statements OR what they\u2019re doing is so far beyond ethical and legal that it\u2019s better to let three top selling artists yeet themselves than expose what\u2019s happening on the books.",

It hasn't been long since 3.0 and new leadership, which could have meant \"cleaning house\" so to speak of employees loyal to LSM and reassigned them elsewhere and moving new people in.   They're probably too busy trying to do damage control internally from the whole post takeover fiasco that they shoved CBX on the back burner.  \n\nI'm guessing they might have expected that CBX would be loyal enough to hang it out or just renew for another x years given their \"history as EXO\" but that loyalty might have only been under LSM (because he gave them their start) and not under the new head.",

God, I'm literally crying, this is EXO, literally the biggest boy group in Korea, and they were *scared*. Imagine what kind of things SM was doing to them behind the scenes to make them feel this way. \n\nAs a TVXQ fan, what I'll say is that I don't doubt things were rocky behind the scenes. Sure, they were preparing for a CB, but in situations like this, when things come to a head, they come to a *head*. \n\nThe China line lawsuit was eh, because they were already a separate unit and it was only a few years after debut, but this is 2023. They are clearly established so I'll definitely be expecting some rocky times from here on out. \n\nReally praying and rooting for CBX... sadly (hopefully not) it'll only get worse from here",

Like, arguably the three most individually popular idols at the time, with very big solo fandoms.\n\nIf anything, the difference imo would be that SM just isn't as powerful as a company and doesn't have as big a monopoly on the industry. They might just not be able to blacklist because they don't hold that kind of sway anymore.",

We're in a different world.\n\nFrankly, it's not like EXO appeared on broadcast much during their last several comebacks anyway...",

This has become more stressful than it is fun, I'm getting too old for most of these new groups, and I'M. OVER. IT. I really can't handle anymore bad news and being attached to idols.",

The lawyer probably advised them that they have a good chance of getting what they want through this method. Their statement for the fans seems to imply they\u2019ll work through things to cause the least possible issues (not to mentioned Sehun\u2019s bubble message today lol)\u2026 so that may still include reconciliation and a workable settlement. They may also be able to demand a new and better contract even if the current one does end up terminated right? If SM wants it to happen\u2026 I\u2019m an exo-l, and while i am nervous, i believe the boys will find a way. There are no bigger exo supporters than the boys themselves. Will wait for how it plays out but man it sure isn\u2019t easy to be an exo-l for 11 yrs.",

Plus during VLIVEs too. \n\nIdk, it is kinda sudden though and so hopefully(?) there's clarifications in the future as NMIXX kinda began with Jinni's stuff during the JYPn days. Sigh.",

NMIXX didn\u2019t make music that quite fit my taste, but the girls had a lot of talent and potential. It\u2019ll be sad to see them continue without Jinni, especially after how long she trained to get where she was. Wishing her the best.",

Especially since JYP has had a number of its idols take mental health hiatuses. The wording of this statement is that vague kind they used for other JYP idol contract terminations that it's probably something we're never gonna know the details of.",

            "comment": "Hello, r/all. Welcome to r/kpop.\n\nTWICE, the best selling K-pop girl group from South Korea are currently setting up a line of teasers for their upcoming album \"Feel Special\". One of the members, Mina, went on a hiatus from activities due to anxiety on July 5th, and it's been radio silence ever since then.\n\nToday was the day that radio silence ended.\n\nIf you'd like to check out TWICE, we'd recommend listening to their previous release; [Fancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOHB85vDuow). And, their most viewed music video on YouTube is [TT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePpPVE-GGJw).\n\nThis post is now the most gilded post ever on r/kpop.\n\n**EDIT: 4 hours and 33 minutes after this teaser was posted, we reached 100 gildings.**",

Yay so glad Mina is back.\n\nFor anyone that's confused - Mina is one of the members of Kpop girl-group \"Twice\", she was diagnosed with anxiety a few months ago. She stopped touring and has been focusing on her mental health and no one was sure if she was going to join the group again for their next song.\n\nThis trailer confirms she'll be back which is why most of us are so excited she's well enough to at least appear in the video. It's still up in the air whether she will be doing music shows / concerts but apparently it's going to be up to her if she's feeling well enough or not.\n\nThe Kpop industry has a bit of a reputation for running down their \"idols\" so most of us have been happy to see that Mina's mental health has been taken seriously and that she's not just been trotted out while having anxiety attacks.",

Earlier this year in the middle of a world tour she took a leave of absence from touring with the rest of the group for health concerns. It was later revealed that she was diagnosed with anxiety. Because of this, there was a lot of speculation as to whether she would participate in the next comeback - i.e. the next music video, album and set of promotions for that.\n\nIt's been since confirmed that she's in the music video (as evidenced by the teaser here) and the album. However whether she participates in live performances is unknown, depending on whether she can overcome her anxiety or not. Fans are eager to show their support for Mina whatever she does in these turbulent times for her.",

I listened to their entire discography for weeks, and eventually branched out into other kpop.\n\nNow I'm proud to listen to everything kpop to actually give it a shot, with multiple groups I would consider myself a fan of, but I don't think any of them will surpass Red Velvet in my eyes.\n\nThey hit me at the exact right time, and helped me through so much over the years. Managing depression, weight loss and exercise, and finding my first professional job - I associate Red Velvet with all of that.",

I remember watching their debut in the fallout of Sulli leaving f(x), the colored hair ends that helped me tell them apart - at least until they dyed their hair. It wasn't until ICC that I really invested in being a fan (that album artwork &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;), and they've been 'my girls' ever since~\n\n\nI never thought I'd get the chance to see them live once (Kcon), let alone twice (Redmare), let alone get to chant that cheesy opening to 'Happiness' along with the crowd and Seulgi. Remembering the video of RV on their debut day moments away from performing, and how nervous they were. Thinking back to that moment still gives me chills. Sorry for the essay lmao, Happy Anniversary RV! &lt;3",

Their songs will always remain timeless.  It has been a tough two years but we are finally going to see all of the girls together and I just wish them health and happiness.

            "comment": "Happy 7th anniversary to the legends of K-pop. The best discography in all of K-pop to this day and I stand by that. \n\n[Well since their 6th anniversary,](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/i18yyk/happy_6th_anniversary_to_red_velvet/) unfortunately they have not done much as a group due to........................various issues, but in the meantime they've managed to get a bunch of solo work in, besides a certain someone. Wendy and then Joy both had magnificent solo debuts. Wendy released [Like Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ih5UArd4zk) in April along with [When This Rain Stops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tknKZe_TyqU). Joy then released a special remake album with the title track [Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNvBbh5jDcA) in May, along with two special videos:\n\n* [Joy - Je T'aime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYBY490Undc&amp;pp=sAQA)\n* [Joy &amp; Paul Kim - If Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzgRgtW8TiY&amp;pp=sAQA)\n\nOther solo activities include Seulgi's new radio hosting gig (Seulgi.zip on Naver Now), Yeri is currently starring in a webdrama (Blue Birthday), and with this anniversary arrived, we can finally anticipate their grand comeback! I'll post their history below so any new fans can get to know the group better.\n\n---\n\nRed Velvet's debut was mired in a bit of controversy, even though [Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFgv8bKfxEs) is a pretty decent song. At the time, SM was going through some dramas, Sulli suddenly left f(x) (and at the time they were very popular and successful). Some say that Red Velvet's debut was rushed because SM wanted to distract from various issues like that. Which is why they only debuted with a digital single, no physical album, and without Yeri. To make matters worse, the MV contained scenes featuring American newspapers talking about the atomic bombings of Japan at the end of WW2, and references to 9/11. So SM took down the MV and reuploaded it with those scenes edited out. There was a bit of naysaying at the time, but people did compliment the group on their visuals and vocals, particularly Wendy's. \n\nAfter Happiness, they would release [Be Natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpAn9ryoB4Y), which is a cover of an SES song. This didn't do very well and quite a few people were writing them off as flops. Plus it came on the heels of Jessica leaving SNSD, so there was a lot of doom and gloom going around about SM's girl group prospects. But it's a smooth song that shows off their Velvet side nicely.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, the group would add Yeri to the lineup, prior to the release of Ice Cream Cake. [Automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px2Q47O0_eE) was released first as a pre-release song, then [Ice Cream Cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glXgSSOKlls) the following day. Now this is when Red Velvet really came into their own, artistically and commercially. ICC ended up being quite a success, both digitally and physically, and the song got good reviews for its hard hitting electronic instrumental combined with RV's playful vocals. It conjured up a style that seemed to be a mix of f(x) and SNSD. It still slaps today. From the album, besides Automatic, [Something Kinda Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChkYZPu_Slw) is also great. Smooth R&amp;B jam with funky synths.\n\nAfter ICC, Red Velvet would come out with a groundbreak, astoundingly good album in The Red. 2015 was the year where girl groups really reached new artistic heights with their albums, there were good albums in the past, but 2015 featured The Red, 4 Walls, Reboot and Lion Heart which were all incredible. The Red was led by the title track [Dumb Dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGdbaEDVWp0), a brassy, extremely energetic and ridiculously catchy song that would define Red Velvet's style. But the album is rock solid from top to bottom. I recommend the whole thing, but highlights include [Oh Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PgGuUP8_jI), [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTaa3Pbv9c0) and [Cool World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqGz3TowPe4).\n\nThe follow up to The Red would unfortunately not reach the same heights (sales wise), but [One Of These Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xWiro_tS1k) is a really emotional tearjerker. Actually a really, really good ballad that perfectly shows off the versatility of their voices. The MV is particularly good, subtly referencing the Sewol tragedy. Even as a hardcore Reveluv I do have to admit that overall the album is probably their weakest, but OOTN is an underrated classic. \n\nHowever, the next album would utterly cement Red Velvet as a top group. [Russian Roulette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslJYDX3o8s) is a song so addictive, some say it should be banned prior to school exams because it will drill into your brain and distract you from studying. The MV showcased what would become an RV trademark, Creepy Velvet. Bright colors, sweet, catchy, energetic dance pop, punctuated with EXTREME VIOLENCE and the members staring into your soul like a bunch of serial killers. It's amazing what you can get away with when you package a bit of the old ultraviolence with upbeat K-pop. Cool Itchy and Scratchy elements in the MV too. \n\nOnce again, the album would also be really, really good. Again I implore you to listen to the whole thing, but [Lucky Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf65W73Q4kA) (retro, 50s doo-wop style), [Sunny Afternoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7ZTK07F0-I) (90s New Jack Swing) and [My Dear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnN8eho8WAg) (easy going jazzy pop) are particular highlights.\n\nRussian Roulette would conclude a pretty decent 2016 for the group. In 2017, they would rise AGAIN on the back of three fantastic promos. The first was [Rookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0h8-OTC38I). At the time, and maybe even today, the song was somewhat polarizing because of how off the wall it was. I personally consider it to be a masterpiece. That bassline, those rapid fire vocals, only Red Velvet could pull it off (don't google Idol School). I find it to be so catchy and groovy. The album was also well received, with songs like [Little Little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR8JnpnMxiE) (light R&amp;B slow jam) and [Body Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo_NIdBUzMU) (atmospheric and deep). \n\nThe next album, The Red Summer, is possibly the feather in Red Velvet's cap. The title track [Red Flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyiIGEHQP8o) is considered to be one of THE K-pop summer anthems. There's nothing bad I can say about this song, even that distorted voice repeating \"Red Red Red Flavor\" has its charm. It has this happy-sad quality that really elevates it above other summer hits. There's a feeling of longing, nostalgia, wistfulness that honestly makes me teary when I listen to it. The Seulgi/Joy bridge leading into Wendy's high notes is one of the best sections of music in all of K-pop. I really love the album too, with [Zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5cHkhGoL5U) being one of the best examples of tropical house inspired pop. It's set IN THE JUNGLE. All those animal noises and Seulgi's Tarzan shout. Amazing.\n\nOkay now if you thought The Red was good...along comes Perfect Velvet. As the name suggests, it's a perfect album and an /r/kpop favorite. For good reason. [Peek-A-Boo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uJf2IT2Zh8) is yet another unbelievably good song, with a more Velvet concept (dark, horror themed). Pizza delivery drivers found dead in a ditch. Literally. It's both chirpy and ominous, and profoundly catchy. \n\nAs for the album, there's hardly anything I can say that hasn't already been said. From [Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yYgbkWni2Y) (80s synthpop jam), to [Kingdom Come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyuLudmE9lQ) (a glorious R&amp;B vocal showcase), [I Just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvw4ot1-k8) (an unexpectedly emotional, intense future bass), [About Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Odu5LVbMo) (brighter and cheerier, but still wistful love song) and everything else, this is one of K-pop's seminal albums.\n\nThey would follow up with a repackage that further elevated the album into the frickin' orbit of Neptune. [Bad Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_CFBjAyPWE) is probably the number one song on this sub, a sexy, slightly retro R&amp;B classic. And [All Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU411ONfzPI) is one of the best disco inspired B-sides.\n\nAfter the resounding success of TRPV, RV would begin a small Japanese foray with [Hashtag Cookie Jar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgTMs_bGuI). This is like Rookie's younger sister and I think it's criminally underappreciated. Yet another sexy bassline and Red Velvet's trademark quirkiness. \n\nReturning to SK, they would drop [Power Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiHSVQy9xN8), a super upbeat summer party song. It really makes you FEEL like you just ate a banana. Cool glitchy, video game inspired instrumental. The album, Summer Magic, has good songs like [Hit That Drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w02c8tgLMI) (which is a riot live), and [Blue Lemonade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5rlpk70Ro) (nice and chill).",

                    "comment": "In a rare display of SM's originality, the next album would be titled [RBB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWJUPY-2EIM) (Really Bad Boy). What if we took Bad Boy, but this time it's REALLY bad? But actually I like the song, and it's ironically much closer to something like Dumb Dumb than Bad Boy with its brassy vocals and instrumental. Even if the title track is divisive, the album itself is considered to be very good. [Butterflies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFeUigPlYQc) is a glitzy electropop song that's somewhat reminiscent of an f(x) B-side. [So Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXQg_1NvF4U) (one of my faves) is just a spectacular R&amp;B jam. Their vocals make me melt. [Taste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvqMQPItDh0) is what Reveluvs have, it's a bit of a 90s New Jack Swing song like Sunny Afternoon. And [Sassy Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYk75DQOPkY) has the best vocal fry outside of the San Fernando Valley. \n\nRV would release another Japanese song starting in 2019 with [Sappy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJ3Pq74H4c), which again I think is super underrated. It's so cute and cheeky, even if that dissonant sax (?) is kinda weird. I love Irene's intonation. From the album, [Sayonara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xgRjAAjNx4) is exceptional, really heartfelt medium tempo ballad. Great piano in this.\n\nFor their return to SK, they would embark on their most ambitious project yet, The ReVe Festival. Starting with Day 1 and [Zimzalabim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnGBb1wg98), regardless of your feelings on the song, it's undeniably iconic. The mini has some really excellent songs too, like the kinda cutely-creepy [Sunny Side Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QbenuWsG8o), the ultra catchy and sweet [Milkshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDy_i0UvAOI) and the best elevator music, [LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRMgZP9i73g). \n\nFor Day 2, they would release [Umpah Umpah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8), and I hate that it's so slept on. Well, for a long time Sone like myself, this is maybe the most SNSD-like song RV have. The vocal performance is great, and the sequential Wendy-Joy-Seulgi high notes was something SNSD did a ton (with Taeyeon-Jessica-Tiffany-Seohyun, see Dancing Queen, Run Devil Run and others). \n\nI like Day 2 the best, [Carpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOjv6c-PMxg) is right now one of my top ten B-sides. The best part about this song is how the song starts with Joy and Seulgi singing the \"excuse me baby\" part, then Seulgi and Wendy, then everyone together. When that third chorus comes in with all their voices, I get literal chills. [Love Is The Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKOABJBRafw) is also one of my faves, because it's a return to that 50s doo-wop style they first explored with Lucky Girl. K-pop needs more doo-wop songs, period.\n\nTo cap off the ReVe Festival series, Red Velvet would release a song that absolutely silenced the doubters. [Psycho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR8Mrt1IpXg) is an absolute MASTAHPEECE from top to bottom. It's simultaneously dark, somber, sexy, romantic and uplifting. Wendy's falsettos are so good, and the ending/outro is a work of art. The \"hey now we'll be okay\" gets me emotional, it was the best way to cap off 2019, representing all the sadness and joy for the year. \n\nUnfortunately in yet another horrible turn of events, Wendy was badly injured due to SBS' negligence. \n\nIn 2020, due to that incident, RV began subunit promotions with Irene &amp; Seulgi, who recently released [Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujb-gvqsoi0), the best Korean media about gals being pals since The Handmaiden. [Naughty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCWoUUWwdqg) came out two weeks ago but you already know it's great. Their tutting is sublime, choreo of the year.",

That is a masterclass in term of songwriting though sonically it wasn't as gripping as their other works. \n\nAnd how dare you not mention the bi-sexual anthem \"Light Me Up\"? Though \"Light Me Up (Jazz Version)\" done by only Wendy is now the most well-known version, the original has such BONKERS structure and harmonies. DEEZ really pushes the group out of their comfort zone vocally and there were some moments they didn't quite nail it, but it is so so good.",

This tour de force of albums cemented myself as a Reveluv ( although the fandom didn't have a name yet at the time).\n\nFast forward 7 years and I never once regretted being a fan due to just how fantastic and packed their discography is. If you only count Korean full group releases ( albums and minis) they have released about 87 songs in 7 years which is around 12 songs (an album) a year , THAT'S CRAZY. Not to mention they never released a song as a full group for the last 1.5 years.\n\n\nAND I kid you not every single one of those songs is a BANGER. \nSo I say this as a man in his mid 20's, Thank you Red Velvet and thanks to all the composers, songwriters and lyricist for creating music that has blessed my ears for the past 7 years, and here's to more years to come !\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9c HEY NOW WE'LL BE OKAY.",

They\u2019re so obtuse, so unconventional, that you haven\u2019t seen much like it outside of them. The b-sides are in albums with these weird fucking title tracks, the songs themselves are these big, confusing, sprawling mazes with multi-million high notes. You can\u2019t really fly over and understand them in ten seconds, like with most groups. Which makes those moments where you feel like you finally get Red Velvet that much more meaningful. A group like this comes along once in a lifetime. They\u2019re the most vocals group. They\u2019re the most harmonies group. And if you say they\u2019re not the best group evah made, [then you da worst guy ever made.](https://youtu.be/7y9CLWJvia8&amp;t=03m45s)",

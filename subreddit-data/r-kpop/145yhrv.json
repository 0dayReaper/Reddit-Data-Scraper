This is what is was like sitting down in front of a CRT television to watch the Backstreet Boys on MTV in 1998 and their recent [Music Bank stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFN844nTby8) was what it was like to watch a K-pop music show in the genre's early days. The YouTube thumbnails here and on the MV are also great since they're both visually interesting and clearly show off every member which is something a lot of other groups could learn from.",

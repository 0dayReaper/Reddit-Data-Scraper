Moonbin should have dated freely, sworn as much as he wanted, danced half naked if he wanted to and told the world he was struggling or not BUT death certificates are very important because they tell a lot about what is going on in a society and it shows due diligence was done for the deceased, particularly when he is a 25 year old young man who is for the most part physically healthy.  I am not saying that this is the case at all in Moonbin's case but when foul play does  happen (it's not suspected here at all ok) families can be involved, so giving families authority over whether an autopsy takes case is absurd.  Laws are meant to protect us from each other and ensure all citizens get treated the same and with oversight of some sort.  A 25 year old young man's cause of death shouldn't be hidden by any means and an autopsy should take place because of his age alone.  Speculation happens whether a person is famous or not.",

I hadn't heard anything beside some minor (questionable) gossip that died off pretty quickly.\n\nETA: I guess to follow up, I think the only rumor I heard was people speculating that his death may have been due to overwork, along with another previous death from Fantagio. I understand and empathize with Moonbin\u2019s mother that she would release a statement requesting privacy. To an extent though, I also understand people who may be worried that without a cause of death listed, this could have been a case of gwarosa/karoshi (or alternatively, overwork-motivated suicide) that was covered up, and we don\u2019t have information to confirm it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI agree that people shouldn\u2019t spread gossip or act like they know things that they have no way of knowing, and also that they should respect the family. Although I do also understand that some people worry since Moonbin was a public figure but all of information surrounding his passing has been kept very private, which would have the potential side effect of benefitting his agency if they had bad work practices that contributed to Moonbin\u2019s death, whether by suicide or by gwarosa. It\u2019s a really complicated issue no doubt. I just hope he rests easy. \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f",

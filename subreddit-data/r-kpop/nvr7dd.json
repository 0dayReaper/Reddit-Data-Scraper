This title track song is definitely a strategic move that is appropriate for a beach outing versus a high tempo banger.\n\nPersonally, the song doesn't do it for me at 3am in the morning, but I gotta give JYP credit because this is probably the most vocally well-rounded song by Twice so far. Every member's lines are so crisp.",

At the time, he said he was getting hassled (even death threats) about it on his social media so to spare his artists he dropped it. But after the ramp-up in personal attacks after Mafia in the Morning, I figured he said 'fuck it, if I'm going to get attacked and threatened anyway, I'm going to put it back in!'",

I\u2019m thinking about the song and how just pleasant it is??? I realize that listening to Kpop has trained me into liking/accepting really jarring and abrupt musical moments so it was kind of nice to just have a smooth listening experience haha",

The melody is rather simple (not a bad thing in itself), so the instrumentals really helped lift the song to a vibey memorable bop instead of forgettable b-side quality. Personally the chorus could have done with a bit more background vocals/harmonies to make it a bit \"bigger\" sounding, but it's not a major problem. I love that the girls all get to sing in a fitting register for them, and the rap break is incorporated well.\n\nTheir visuals in this mv is out of this world. I keep getting cut-off mid-scream during the mv when they switch between the members. Twice's cody really seem to have gotten much better around M&amp;M/ICSM era, and this mv is a whole visual treat.",

Maybe this is just a characteristic of summery concepts? The calmness of this song is a double edged sword, but I found myself smiling the whole time so it did its job for me at least. The b side snippets we've gotten seem like they'll be higher tempo so I'm looking forward to those!",

The MV is amazing as well, probably my favorite since What is Love, and in my opinion a resounding rebuttal to a lot of the critiques of TWICE's MV's as of late.\r  \n\r  \nI have to say I'm quite surprised however that I seem to be on the dissenting opinion with this comeback. I can understand if some fans don't think this song will be a GP hit (although we can't know this yet) but it seems like they don't like the song at all.\r  \n\r  \nIt's a different style, yes, but that's the beauty of it. Would fans rather have yet another retro song as every other group has done for the last year running? Or perhaps they'd rather have a tropical house song to try and catch onto the winds of Rolling? (itself 5 years old) And then there's the alternative of an instrumental hook song which has become so pervasive in K Pop. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with these styles, but some part of me feels the same critiques would follow TWICE even if they had gone with a more \"traditional\" comeback.\r  \n\r  \nThe point is TWICE is doing their own thing while making it sound good, which is what top groups ought to do--lead, not follow.",

It makes sense why JYP made the instrumental melodic and busy. But, wish he could've came with a more melodic melody that has some movement..\n\nEDIT: whores i cannot believe it, JYP laced this shit witj crack. I'm addicted Alcohol-Free. I was driving with the windows down on a sunny day, and the song made my day more brighter! Great Bossa-Nova!~",

It definitely gives me a very summery-relaxed vibe and it will collect plenty of plays because it runs neatly in the background. My only BUT: Does anyone else feel like this song is something right between A- and B-side level? Like it is a nice song to listen to but I wouldn't make it to a title track. Maybe I had too high expectations, I don't know.",

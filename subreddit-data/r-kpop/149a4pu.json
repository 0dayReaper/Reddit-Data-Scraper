Vivi (Kahei), Kim Lip (Jungeun), Choerry (Yerim), Chuu (Jiwoo), Yves (Sooyoung), Go Won (Chaewon), and Olivia Hye (Hyejoo) are all stage names.\n\nETA: I think Vivi genuinely prefers Vivi as she used a similar stage name during her career before LOONA.

Considering how flat is Kpop right now (in my opinion n.b), having OEC concept and music directed by Jaden (lets be honest, despite the controversial at the time, he has genuine amazing ideas and great music taste) is simply amazing.\n\nHope they will get huge supports after the boycott because of that shitty agency called BBC.",

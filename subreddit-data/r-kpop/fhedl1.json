Like you said she\u2019s been there since the beginning of it all and was chosen first as a 16 year old girl to essentially become the main girl of LOONA. She\u2019s seen all of the other members debut and has literally been through it all. That\u2019s not even to mention how she used to travel like 2 or 3 hours just to get to Seoul from her house for dance practice and how expensive it was or how her dream was to become an idol even tho her sisters idol dreams failed before her and Heejin herself was rejected by so many companies. People say Heejin is an all kill in LOONA since she\u2019s able to basically do it all but she\u2019s so amazing now because of the hard work she has put into it and the same can be said for all of LOONA as well. I\u2019m just so happy that they won finally and she can feel that the past 4 years was worth it.",

Hyunjin has been around as long as Heejin plus all the extra time she had prior as a trainee in Polaris. None of this stoppped either of them as they founded LOONA, regardless of how unrealistic and crazy it might've seemed to them at the time. They followed their dreams and they've made it. I can't be more proud of them.",

There are literally not enough words in my vocabulary to describe how happy I am for them. As a fan who's been here since the very beginning it is incredibly satisfying to know that all of our streaming and efforts paid off. Huge thanks to all Hanbits, international Orbits, and fans from other fandoms for helping us!! It truly is a legendary day and an unforgettable win.\n\nI want to personally thank all the folks here in the Kpop subreddit who originally pushed those threads so hard when the LOONA project first began and Heejin first made her debut. If it wasn't for their valiant promotions I would have gotten into this group too late but it was thanks to them that I got to experience the debut experience in full. From the bottom of my heart, thank you!!",

They are basically that group that has bigger chances of winning if they aren't going against Giants (like GFriend, BTS etc.)",

I've gone over many where the language states that \"Either party may terminate this contract... (conditions)\". The validity of the request depends on 1) said conditions and 2) period of notice for termination stated in the contract. It doesn't always go to court. This is speaking on legal agreements in general of course. In this case SM probably wont take this lying down so it most likely will go to court unless an out-of-court settlement is reached.",

That's one of the things that really hurt JYJ in their case - they had a court injunction limiting their activities temporarily while their legal and financial situation got sorted.

However, it's very firmly implied that they are terminated, because they are breaking their agreements to speak out about this.\n\nEDIT: I did find this in CBX Statement #2\n\n&gt;And just as the records of our requests through certifications of contents remain objectively, the artists and their legal representative consistently requested the \u201cprovision\u201d of the settlement reports from the beginning. Then, SM maintained their position that only \u201cviewing\u201d the settlement data should be enough. However, as you saw earlier, SM\u2019s claim is not in line with the exclusive contracts which is why we could not accept \\[their claim\\], and since the gap between the parties\u2019 positions could not be reduced in the end, the artists and their legal representative decided to terminate the exclusive contracts according to the precedent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To restate the precedent, an exclusive contract is based on a high degree of trust. Thus, if the agency does not fulfill its obligation to provide settlement reports, the artists\u2019 rights to review the settlement of profits and file an objection against the agency are not properly guaranteed, resulting in failure to provide settlement reports to be a reason for terminating the exclusive contract (refer to Seoul High Court order from 2019Na2034976 on January 31, 2020. In short, settlement reports must be \u201cprovided\u201d).",

DBSK did a ton of variety shows during their lawsuit, but it was so awkward because they ethier forced JYJ to record separately or they just didn't show the two sides interacting. Even back then, they tried to act like everything was ok when *everyone* knew it wasn't. \n\nAt things are gonna be *much* less awkward now, because based on their airport appearances (and Sehun's idgaf attitude lol) EXO will stick together. No matter what SM tries to do, it looks like they aren't able to play the same moves they did back then. The media play isn't as successful and they aren't able to drive a wedge between the members. \n\nI hope things can go better this time around, but it's SM. Although it'll be nice to see the members together, the company itself is trying to just rake in profits while at the *same time* fucking up CBX with media play. It's basically like \"Oh yeah, we're involving your kids in all of this, but you still gotta smile and do  whatever we say\". No doubt the EXOs are gonna have a great time on thier show, I hope there's positive vibes all around, but the two faced nature just kinda rubs me the wrong way.",

For example, SM could have conveniently forgot some aspects of the scheduling regarding JYJ, forcing them pay for their own flights and accommodations. Or if JYJ had any requests at all, like food preferences, I suspect SM would freeze them out and give them the attitude that if they don't like it, they can go plan it themselves.\n\nAnother component of the JYJ case that IMO hurt their image and public opinion, was the court injunction ordering JYJ to stop working temporarily while their finances get sorted out with SM. Both sides agreed to this, and while JYJ complied faithfully with the law, SM used this opportunity to slander them and question their loyalty.\n\nRight now there's just a ton of confusion regarding CBX because both sides proactively confirmed that EXO will stay together. So now ppl see them working together and both sides think, \"[CBX or SM] must be right\" and then start to fill in the blanks with fantasy.",

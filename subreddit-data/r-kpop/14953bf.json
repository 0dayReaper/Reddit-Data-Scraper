I didn't feel like 3 years was enough time for them to do that with itzy and nmixx, but itzy had at least got to a decent level of success. However itzy has lost momentum, when people ask who are the biggest ggs rn no one ever says itzy, but they were in their first three years and they still should be now. It feels like jyp focused more on the new group but I'm a casual fan so I can't say for sure why they've lost momentum, it just feels like it's because they focused on a newer group. And with nmixx they had such a different concept to itzy that again, I was like, alright, at least it's different. But now they've scrapped their concept... Idk. It all just feels poorly managed to me!\n\nETA: To make it clear, I love nmixx's switch up concept and I'm salty JYP has already dropped it in favour of mass market appeal, especially when they still have Itzy whose sound isn't all that different from the new stuff.",

Now girl groups are killing it on the charts and they\u2019re selling just as much albums as boy groups, they\u2019re starting to become more profitable. I\u2019m just happy to see that female idols are being so well received these days, so many girl groups had to suffer for things to become like this.",

More groups: more presence on the market.\n\nI feel like good music might be the issue as it might get competitive to whom jype will give the song.\nbut imo the last songs of the company weren't that bad as people say I just think it was too rushed before the concept gets more developed and production-wise.",

Whether they buy it to keep everything or buy and then throw out, it's still a sale and they cost the same.

They made 40 million in profits (120 million revenue) in just this years first quarter alone and you think they have to share budgets and carefully divide it up. And if/when they debut another group (or 10) then they will simply use some of the 40 million they made in just this quarter alone and not ITZYs budget lol.\n\nYou are talking about JYPE as if they are barely scraping by or losing money (thats the only time your scenario makes sense), because only then they would have to carefully budget each division and the divisons would actually have to share (small) budgets with each other. But that couldnt be further from the truth, JYPEs revenue/profit is at an all time high, at that point money is not really a bottleneck, its usually finding enough (capable) workers to manage all these divisions/artists. (thats why they introduced the division system in the first place)\n\nI can promise you NMIXXs next budget being 5 million or 10 million dollars, will have no impact on how much ITZY gets. Their budget is impacted by how well they are doing. Obviously the company can still be stingy and just ignore growth and keep the budget the same (or even lower it) but thats a separate issue in itself.",

A big issue with the division system is if the high performing employees are all sitting in one division or another, not all your groups are benefiting. By diluting divisions anymore the lack of capable workers becomes a bigger issue.\n\nOf course they have to divide it up. Whenever the c-execs are doing their allocation of budgets every year, you don\u2019t think more groups impacts how much they allocate because profits have gone up? \n\nIt\u2019s not about them scraping the barrel, it\u2019s about the nature of kpop and how it works.\n\nNMIXX basically sell the same as Itzy already and their touring is not significant enough to be a differentiator. So as a business in an industry where the asset (idols) has a useful life of around 7 years usually, why would you continue pumping a lot of money into Itzy when there\u2019s another asset with a longer useful life and similar payback? NMIXX are a year old and have 6 years left on a rookie contract favourable to JYPE.\n\nThe existence of NMIXX will directly impact the investment and thought put into Itzy, any early success from younger groups will accentuate it further. Ask Got7 fans about what happened after Twice had their debut. JYPE for years have been known as one of the worst companies at retaining their idols for a reason.",

(current Itzy drama) Not everything has to do with money/budget, maybe some people are just incompetent or the fans have no clue what they are talking about.\n\nI will divide my answer into 2 parts, first about the division system. Yes the division system was created to increase the volume/speed of content but this gets achieved by utilizing employees more efficiently which inturn helps with the lack of employees. For some reason you assume that divisions increase the problem of lacking capable workers but it does the opposite (as you yourself said, the reason for what it got introduced in the first place). It does not dilute the problem, (random numbers as example) before you had 100 people running 5 groups and now you have 20 people each running 1 group, the point of it is to cover the lack of capable employees by utilizing them more efficiently through the division system, IF implemented properly you are now able to get more out of your 100 employees then you were previously capable of. Obviously as the company got bigger and they got more artists, they need even more employees, so they still end up with the same problem just not as bad. Its hard to keep up with hiring, while your profits are multiplying every year, which you have to invest into more products(groups/artists), which hopefully increase the revenue/profits even more. Thats why I am saying that not money but workers are the bottleneck for companies like JYPE, I'm sure if JYPE could magically find 500 qualified people to hire, they would instantly debut 10 groups, the money is simply not the issue here.\n\nNow to the profits/budgets. I honestly dont understand why you think that putting less money into older groups (ITZY in this case) is somehow beneficial to them. Companies want 2 things: growth and profit/revenue, the former is more important for (most) publicly traded companies. To grow you keep investing/putting more money into your already existing products, so that they inturn make you more money but you also invest in new/other products for additional possible income streams. In JYPEs case their groups are their products, the way they grow is simple, they keep pumping money into their existing groups as long as they return profits and possibly increase the budgets if they think they can reap even bigger profits and the other way as mentioned is debuting new groups because they become new sources of profit for them. Now as I said, if JYPE was struggling then your initial point makes sense, the company has very limited resources, and they have to decide which products they wanna keep investing in, even if the other product inturn reports lower profits, but this simply isnt the case for JYPE.\n\nLike you are asking me why should JYPE keep pumping money into ITZY if NMIXX can create similar profits for them and has a longer contract? Basically what you are saying is, why should company A keep pumping money into product B that makes 10 million revenue a quarter, while they have product C that also make 10 million but is also longer under contract. The answer is very simply, because JYPE wants to keep making 20 million a quarter and the only way they will do that is by keeping the budgets for both groups. Why should JYPE lower the money for ITZY and then only make 8 million next quarter, even though they have enough money to provide for both. Its just a stupid question idk. The only time JYPE would not keep putting money into ITZY is when they dont have the means to do it and have no other choice but to choose between the 2 of them but we know that this isnt the case. As I said, if JYPE could, they would love to have 50 groups, pump money into all of them and make hundreds of millions each quarter but in your world they would just abandon 45 of those and settle with tens of millions instead, makes no sense.\n\nI simply dont understand why you think that somehow JYPE putting less money into one group is beneficial for them if they want to keep making money, that is simply not based on reality. As long as a group makes money, they will get money (again as long as the company isnt struggling in the first place), because otherwise JYPE would make less money.\n\nStuff like \"Ask Got7 fans about what happened after Twice had their debut\" is just stupid because there are examples of the exact opposite, I mean look at Stray Kids, disappointing debut and sandwiched between Twice and ITZY but somehow kept getting more and more money, why? Because they slowly kept making more and more money until we got to this point. Got7 simply got unlucky while JYPE tried to transition their company structure at the same time as they were massively expanding leaving them dry. Funny enough this is actually one of those times where your scenario of JYPE having to decide between groups applies somewhat because JYPE was actually struggling financially before TWICE exploded.\n\nAnyways this is already way to long of a comment, if you can explain to me why JYPE would have wanted to make 30 million in profits last quarter instead of 40 million by abandoning older/less profitable groups/products, I will gladly accept your point.",

You have 5 marketing execs, 2 are highly qualified and the other 3 aren't. Whichever divisions are left with the bad ones aren't getting better because they are concentrating on one group and you've now lost input. It's why there's such a glaring difference in creativity between divisions, with some groups clearly being left worse off. JYPE's division system creates volume over value.\n\nWhat I'm telling you is it doesn't matter how profitable they are, diversion and priority of resourcing will always go towards those they deem biggest or most profitable. New groups debuting and therefore more internal competition impacts that equation. \n\nThey do not need to pump loads of money into a group once they are established, they can afford to be negligent for financial purposes i.e. an Itzy. Itzy aren't going to start selling 100k because JYPE took budget away from them. \n\nYou seem to be under the odd impression that less money towards Itzy means JYPE lose money when that's not the case and clearly isn't what is going to happen. The quality of the product is what suffers for fans but in kpop that has a negligible impact on established big 4 groups, which is why Itzy won't drop to a 100k sales just because they had less investment but the fans do lose out hence you see complaints.\n\nBut what they do become is a higher margin cash-cow. They bring in similar revenue but at higher margins so your scenario of why JYPE would sacrifice 10m in profits legit makes no sense because that's not the scenario. Just because you put more money in it doesn't mean you get more money out and vice versa. That's not how it works.\n\nStray Kids got a lot of content and promo before they blew up properly with Gods Menu. They literally got given more b-side MVs one year in than Twice had in 7 whilst Twice were getting worked to the bone.",

Obviously if you consider the fact that some employees are worse then others, then this changes somewhat but that talk is meaningless considering we dont have a clue about the individuals in JYPE. Yeah you might have \"bad\" divisions and \"good\" divisions but without divisions you would have the same problem unless you want the 2 highgly qualified people handle all the groups, which makes absolutely no sense. None of this has anything to do with budgets or the company prioritizing certain groups/divisions, its simply the luck of the draw who you got working under your division.\n\nThe 10m in profits was just a random number to show you how stupid the idea of intentionally reducing the profits of one of your products is if you dont have to, you can turn that to 1m and JYPE still doesnt want to intentionally throw away 1m. In your world no company will ever grow because they never add to their income streams but only replace old ones with new ones, they never increase their amount of products because they obviously have to abandon something old for that, they intentionally throw away money. \n\nDiversion and priority of resources exists but that only matters in the case if those resources (money) are actually limited enough that you have to take away from some groups. That is not the case, like I cant repeat myself 50 times, we know the money they make. Yes if for some reason JYPE at the beginning of the year went and said (again random numbers used): \"Guys you have 10 million dollars for this year, good luck distributing it between all of you\", then ITZY would be fucked but that simply is not the case. There is no reason for JYPE to give all the groups together an extremely limited budget if they can provide them a bigger one, which ends up with more money for JYPE anyways, because they KNOW that all the groups are profitable and will make that money (and more) back. Why would you intentionally decide to make less money as a publicly traded company and basically sabotage one of your own products.\n\nYes ITZYs sales wont drop to 100k because they lowered their budget, but maybe it goes down by 100k (or the streams go down, or the engagements,  or whatever) and then again 100k the next time etc. A bad (or rather worse) product will reduce your profits even in kpop (your profits stagnating can also be \"reduced\" profits because a normal budget might have increased it by X% instead), why in the hell would they not want to keep the same budget and keep making more/the same money, it makes literally no sense. You are still working under this assumption that they for some reason have to choose between 2 groups, but there simply is no reason for that to happen.\n\nI dont understand how you still think this makes sense, besides the typical kpop talk about \"my favorite group is not getting the proper attention\" because you dont like whats going on/they arent as successful anymore. Like even the Stray Kids example speaks for itself, there are years between Stray Kids debut and Gods menu, until that point they had disappointing results for a big 4 bg, but for years they still kept a huge budget (or even increasing), while obviously not being anywhere nearly as successful as TWICE or even ITZY at debut, by your logic they should have just started abandoning them by the time ITZY had their debut because they had to \"prioritize their resources\". That obviously didnt happen because by that time JYPE was making enough money, that they could simply provide both groups with money. The same happened when NMIXX debuted, no ones budget went down because that would simply be retarded. ITZY is still as active as they were 2 years ago, the only difference now is that they are able to tour, which means less other content.\n\nI honestly dont want to keep repeating myself, probably my last comment.",

If JYPE's division system was as good as you want to try and make out, it would be replicated elsewhere.

They are not making less money by investing less in Itzy as they are at the point of being an established group. I have no idea why you keep parroting this as some kind of be all end all argument. Groups become higher margin products the more established they get. They need less investment to bring in the same amount/more money. At that point it's just volume of content for a group and touring. Groups with established fandoms can make more money with less investment as at that point any impact of cheaper quality content is immaterial. Loads of money or not there's still an opportunity cost when it comes to deciding where to put more budget which will be impacted by label mates.\n\nEveryone is aware of the stigma towards ageing groups within the kpop industry, around how they get given less support/investment/attention as labels/the pubic like to move onto the next shiny gg, yet you think labels are out here pumping as much money as they did at their debut into them? The quicker a label pumps out groups the quicker the groups age. That is the cycle of kpop outside of anomalies i.e. the biggest acts out there. \n\nGOT7 were right at the end of their contracts and Stray Kids were therefore the only active kpop BG in the company in an era self-producing bg's are making bank. They were not going to get de-prioritised anytime soon unless JYPE had another bg up their sleeve which clearly hasn't been the case. Even in JYPEs successful years GOT7 got left behind in their last 1/2 years in terms of investment and attention.",

Don\u2019t they usually/intend to debut boy and girl groups close to each other to be \u201csibling groups\u201d or whatever? I could be wrong since I don\u2019t know much about these things and how/why they debut groups. \n\nItzy has been quiet for a while now. Maybe they\u2019re gearing up for the 2nd half of 2023 or first half of 2024? Twice had about half a year \u201coff\u201d when they were gearing up for 2023. A spring comeback, Japanese single release, World Tour, Sub Unit Debut, Solo debut, and now rumored OT9 comeback in the fall. Could be they are doing that for Itzy (probably not as extensive) while they give Nmixx all the promotions. Nmixx is a new group so they\u2019ll want to put their efforts there to establish them, which unfortunately seems to be taking from Itzy who I think wasn\u2019t as solidified/established as Twice was when they debuted.",

            "comment": "It's interesting reading through the comments in here. Really the biggest issue seems to be how we, individually, define success in Kpop for groups. There's a ton of talk about ITZY and NMIXX not getting enough attention, that they are being backburnered, that they aren't having enough success and so on. Yet, NMIXX are 500k album sellers and ITZY is over 1 million albums sold per comeback (Checkmate &amp; Cheshire). \n\nSo, how are you defining success? Because NMIXX hasn't had a song that has gone viral like OMG/Ditto/Attention/Cupid? Because ITZY has had a viral song since DallaDalla and WannaBe? Basically by not having a super hit song that goes viral and becomes one of their iconic hit songs, they are not getting enough support from their label/company? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I criticize ITZY (or should I say the team managing their music and JYPE) for this, but I can't agree that they aren't getting supported or aren't successful. 1 million album sales back to back is just too much to criticize them. Sure, they aren't at the very very top, like they were early in their group career. That's a bummer, because they have the potential and talent to be up there. But for now it's GIDLE, IVE, New Jeans, LSF, BP and AESPA (am I forgetting anyone?) that are constantly in the top 3 with super hit songs. It's a logjam of super, super popular GG's who have put out bangers and ITZY hasn't put out a banger in a long time. NMIXX hasn't put out one yet in general. It's not like their company and the team who make their music aren't trying. They hope Sneakers/Cheshire/In The Morning will be it but they just haven't been. \n\nAlso, I fail to see how this group: \n\n&gt;Analysts are also eyeing JYP\u2019s A2K Project, in which the K-pop agency is collaborating with American record label Republic Records, owned by Universal Music, to debut a girl group that will be active in North America.\n\nis going to impact NMIXX or ITZY. Unless the new GG has the same concept as ITZY, who are promoting in America and have learned ENG to presumably promote here heavily, I doubt an American GG who will be active in just North America is going to impact anyone at JYPE. They'll get allotted a budget based on their earnings potential, not to mention maybe Republic Records/Universal pays a share, and the demographic they target will likely be different than Korean K-pop. They'll be trying to break into the North American mainstream pop music market I imagine. So it's not like there will be a meaningful amount of consumers with just enough money for one album who have to decide between this new GG and ITZY/NMIXX.",

We have got to admit that reaction channels do bring a lot of attention to kpop groups and they do use copyrighted material to react like mv or performances so will YG take those down too? And what about the fan content like meme video, edit video etc, won't it also fall under copyrighted material too? And if they don't use this move evenly for all content then won't it make it blatantly obvious that they are using their power to censor the bad stuff while letting the good stuff continue.\n\nAnd if the do take down the fan content then that will make things difficult for fans because let's face it, YG doesn't release enough stuff from BP to sustain such a big fanbase. Any fanbase needs things to sustain itself and that is were fan content comes in. If he takes down fan content then he would have to release BP stuff more frequently to maintain the fandom which we all know he has never done for any group.\n\nAnd as you said YG doing this just brings more attention to the problem. It would have gone on its own especially if BP did a good performance for MMA then these video would have become thing of the past. Honestly this feels like such a non - issue to actively go against, I am sure most people at least thought half the videos were from trolls anyway and Dec 1 is so close, I good performance would have shut all this down so why go out of you way to deal with it.\n\nHas YG done this for 2ne1 ever? I would assume the Bom problem was far worse then this will ever be but I don't remember YG doing anything to support her. \n\nYG is in a pretty tricky position and I feel made a unnecessary hasty decision about a problem which would have gone away on its own.",

And unlike other fandoms, kpop fans really like to pretend that they own subtitles and fancams. This would just be a wake up call for them that, no you do not own that video. Performances are protected under US copyright (which is what YouTube uses), so YG and any other has the right to pull them off the platform.\n\nThat said... It's an incredibly stupid thing for them to do. Just like videos about games, the company gains way more by leaving it up than taking it down. I wouldn't expect this to become a trend. Mainly because it is absolutely pointless and this is really just YG flailing because people are noticing that his favorite has been acting differently. This will not benefit them in anyway but likely no one was going to tell him no. But that is likely to change after this bad press.",

It's okay maybe for fans to record if they will keep it to themselves but uploading it to other flatform is a no no. It's like uploading a movie from the cinema. \n\nAlso, it's a step YG has taken to avoid malicious comments or to avoid mass mentality. But he should have a word with Jennie and she should get back to herself. I love her but this is just bitchy. If she don't want to dance then have a minimal choreo like Big Bang or Winner.",

Or maybe if they just didn't do anything, the whole thing would eventually blow over. \n\nTaking down videos has just added fuel to the fire.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit:  \n\nI also think this sends a terrible message to BP's fans. Blinks are the ones that have been supporting BlackPink. They're the ones streaming songs. They're the people that produce free fanmade content. And many of them are the ones who come to the defense of Blackpink whenever people started shit (whether or not it was warranted).\n\nI think it's fair to say that Blinks wanted (and deserved) answers more than anyone else from YG. YG's response is basically:\n\n&gt; \"Tough luck, we don't owe you anything. You want an explanation? How about we just pretend this never happened instead.\" \n\nAfter this, I think a lot of fans are going to be way less willing to stick their necks out for any YG group.",

Like the recent mixnine thread, they're nowhere to be seen. But then in accomplishment threads they're all over them pushing their narrative that people are just masking their dislike for BP by saying that they hate YG. The fact that they can say something like that when the MixNine fiasco is right in front of their faces is absolutely amazing. \n\nI predicted that this entire Jennie / BP fiasco would have happened the second her solo was announced. It would have happened regardless of whether videos of her dancing lazily emerged as well as regardless of if many people perceived the song to be weak or not. Those two additional variables simply have added a lot of fuel to the fire that I believe was inevitable. Jennie's lack of enthusiasm aside, what the people who act like everyone is hating on BP don't seem to realize (or do realize and pretend not to) is that all of these issues are attributed to YG and YGE's management of the group and their desired purpose for the group and its members.  I saw a comment in another thread yesterday or a couple of days ago that said something along the lines of \"people claim they're not hating on BP but then they say things like 'they're glorified models'\".  Well if it is peoples perceptions that they are 'ModelPink\" and \"glorified models\", whos fault is that? Obviously not the fault of the girls, it is the fault that their company clearly prefers their revenue creation to be more heavily based around selling product than selling music. Its amazing to me that people can misconstrue (purposefully) things like this into a perceived attack onto the girls themselves when they have zero influence in those kinds of decisions.  \n\nThe Jennie thing was going to happen one way or another because the BP fandom already has a lot of akgae issues and this was only going to stir that pot one way or another, combined with the long lasting perception that she is YG's personal favorite that has become at this point in my opinion, undeniable. To be giving that member a solo debut when the group has just 9 songs, YG and YGE must have known it would be cause for issue, but typical Yang Hyungsuk doesn't give a shit. His company and his idols are just a playground for him. ",

Obviously I don't know this as a fact so I can't state it as a fact, but from the entire history of the group, as well as past history to me I think what is going on is very clear. YG's entire business strategy for BP is to just release music with the least frequency possible to keep their popularity up, for their primary function which is CFs and selling clothing and cosmetics from companies that YG is affiliated with. Lisa for example is being used heavily in the marketing push of Moonshot in Thailand. \n\nThis should have been very clear to anyone during BP's one year hiatus. We knew once Square up came out that all the songs but D4 were created in the past, and we know Forever Young was around in 2015. So all the arguments about Teddy being the bottleneck for BP's release cycles is completely false, especially seeing as that he made two songs for Sunmi within 5 months during that one year hiatus. He didn't do that because he was super busy, he did that because he had the free time to do so. If the company cared about BP as a music group then they'd have more comebacks and promotions, the reason they don't is because they don't care. Forever young could have easily been a digital single comeback during the halfway point of that one year. \n\n  I think Jennie has definitely always been his favorite so he took her recent popularity increase as a time to push her hard. He wants to make her a huge star for the same kind of purposes. You can really tell that the company doesn't really give a fuck about her actual music career by just looking at the song and the MV. The song is very very likely a song that Teddy made for Sunmi, which Sunmi surely rejected for being under par. So its not like YGE spent some good time and worked with Jennie to create a musical identity for her that is unique that screams \"THIS IS ME, JENNIE!\", they just threw her a song and said \"alright, get out there\", and then the MV is basically a promo vid to attract CFs as well. So why would anyone believe YG's damage control instagram post about how they'll all get 'solo work' in time? Haven't people learned to not believe anything he says (on his instagram none the less) until it actually materializes? Jennie's solo, just like BP's existence as a music group is simply a means to an end for YG. YG's purpose for Jennie is to have her become his Suzy, Jennie is his passion project. Meanwhile Lisa for example is his cash cow, use her to sell product in Thailand and have her do work with the new dance academy in order to attract customers.  I don't see how anyone who looks at things from a POV that isn't emotionally attached and biased would see anything I said here as \"hate towards BP / the girls\", all of these are business decisions via the YG and the company and the girls have zero influence in making them. \n\nThe fandom has been on edge forever due to all of YGs shit ever since the start, the solo was like adding fuel to the fire and the videos of the dancing is like ... well ... adding even more fuel I guess. But what I've stated here are what I believe are the true underlying issues.",

Wouldn't he profit much more by actually giving BP something to release rather than CFs? JYPE, arguably the one who had the biggest profit, did so by relying on music release rather than CFs and other extra activities. I feel like unless you become the face of the product or an ambassador, like BTS is to Hyundai, you won't really profit much from CFs compared to releasing music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalthough, there is the argument that releasing music is high investment high returns since music production takes a lot of work and money, while CFs are low investment average returns, the company doesn't need to invest (much) money but will still profit. But with BP's level and popularity, I think it's under-utilizing them to be going with a low investment strategy.",

At some point I think they decided to change Jennie's idol persona. In their debut vids she still had that luxurious/rich image, but she was also very brash/assertive/in your face. It's a persona that allows for a lot of personal expression and slight improvising.\n\nFast forward two years and you get this intense (almost melodramatic) mediaplay about her. She's not just luxurious, with the aura of a rich kid. She's \"human gucci.\" She's \"the next g-dragon.\" Meanwhile, as we saw on the making of Solo video, she's told to look as blank as possible. This just doesn't feel at all like the kind of direction she was probably getting for Whistle and Boombayah. There's nothing identifiable as \"Jennie\" in Solo. Or, at least, it doesn't feel like a logical extension of the Jennie we saw before. They're clearly trying to switch up the marketing around her, but in practice it feels muddled and confused to a lot of people.  \n\nPeople are saying Jennie needs to be getting more direction from management... I almost wonder if she's actually having the opposite problem. Like, I wonder if there are people in the company over-analyzing every step she takes to make sure she's as blank as a model. If she's sufficiently \"human gucci\" enough. That really is a persona flip from the assertive and loud persona she had before. She has to live up to the intense mediaplay about her, and all the scrutiny the company is probably placing on her about this solo. Add in all the pressure on this debut, and the normal pressures of an idol (never eating or sleeping enough. Possible injury issues, possible mental health issues) I wouldn't be surprised, then, if all these factors combined and led to the lackluster performance(s) that end up in those youtube vids. \n\nI could easily see her being confused/overwhelmed/fatigue about what the company wants from her at this point and idol work being something she just has to power through so she can get on to the next thing in her job (whether it's rehearsal, photoshoots, whatever). \n\nThis doesn't explain everything... Like others have pointed out she does seem to try harder when performing Solo or whenever it's her line. But I wouldn't be surprised if all the pressure/attention got to her and she's either lashing out or just completely mentally fatigued at this point. Add in how the Blackpink situation encourages akgaes, and add in how every second of an idol's public life is filmed... I'm not surprised things have come to this point, due to YG's poor management.     ",

I really don't hope it comes to that. I remember seeing their first weekly idol episode back when they debuted, that wasnt too much more than 2 years ago,  they were all like lambs, like babies animals whos eyes just recently opened to the real world, seeing light for the first time. Very awkward,  very shy. They haven't changed too much from that but theyve definitely gotten some experience. But now YG is mediaplaying her in full throttle as shamelessly as possible with the human gucci and female GD stuff. Things that are impossible do live upto. There are videos of Jennie breaking down crying because she missed some of her lyrics during performances with the group,  where she just squat down for the rest of the song, something ive never seen before. And im not saying this to criticize her at all, but rather to show that even then she clearly felt a lot of pressure on herself and got overwhelmed by it to that degree. I rly have never seen an idol not brush off a mistake and just continue to perform a song,  but to just go numb as their groupmates perform around her. With this gigantic push into spotlight,  the impossible to meet expectations,  the backlash, having to think about how it is affecting the rest of the group, the rest of the fans, every little detail in all of this can feel like pressure from all sides. I dont know how anyone could handle it, but Jennie has already shown herself to be sensitive (again this isn't a criticism, its fucking human, she is human). At this point when I was reading your comment it made me think that its not a question of if but when. The \"lazy dancing \" can easily be a symptom of this. There is only so much stress somebody can be under until it is a breaking point, compound that with being in the public eye so often and i dont know. YG and his sick games may honestly very likely severely emotionally damage this innocent young woman. ",

Blackjacks were lambasted for speaking up, for pointing out just how much of a disgusting man YG is as a human being, and how inept he was as a businessman. Treated as some dumbasses who didn't just go through the whole thing right from the jump. Well guess what? Now BP as a fandom is breaking apart at the seams, and if they had any sort of reflective thought, they would have heeded the warnings people like me and other Blackjacks gave them.\n\nReally - I hate using this as a term, but I think it fits perfectly for the relationship between Blinks and YG himself, is that Blinks have a collective case of battered wife syndrome. Constantly trying to rationalize and accept his abusive business practices, and lashing out at those that criticize him in some twisted hope that if by licking his boots, then maybe YG might give them another full group comeback.

That's the only way they can defend Jennie's laziness and their daddy YG's shit decision making. Quality over quantity my ass.\n\nYou know there are multiple sides to this right? I love BP and every single member but I can admit that that Jennie's performance in that video was lackluster compared to before. \n\n I like most Blinks now that we are starved of content from YG as well and here they are seen protecting Jennie which does seem to be the main focus of the group for a while now, I will give my full opinion on that when the other members debut there solo albums though and how much push they get.\n\nI hate the fact that Jennie looked disinterested and like she did not want to be there in the concert whilst the other members where trying so hard and I fully expect an amazing performance at MMA but I want to see her again at a concert where there is less pressure/coverage to know if she really improved.\n\nThe part where you say Blinks turn to \"hate speech\" is bs, those blinks are as delusional as the people who are doing the hate speech as well..There are fans at the extreme end of both arguments as with every case and they typically stand out the most. The amount of hate she got was to much but using that as a defence from Blinks is also retarded. \n\nFrom what I have seen most Blinks can admit that she performed badly and hope she improves and don't go about hating her till we get more performances to judge.\n\n With the whole YG/Jennie favouritism part it has been obvious and most Blinks know that but what can we really do? Hate on Jennie for something out of her control?  ",

But I would definitely agree YG's strategy will be harming them in the long run, as you said Army blink was a very big fraction back in 2016 and even early 2017 but has significantly decreased over the years to the point that even armyonce seem bigger despite not being a girl crush group. And of course with lots of good debuts this year that ratio is effected even more with the rise of Loona army, army fans of G-idle, army fans of ateez etc.",

If you see a helicopter stuck in a tree it's fair to say that the pilot fucked up along the way. Of course you have rabid haters and fans alike coming up with a variety of ridiculous takes on the situation, but the reality is that YG is aware of it on some level - enough to have the video removed but not the concert footage used.\n\nI've always enjoyed Blackpink's performances but they've never been showstoppers on stage the way that a group like EXO or BTS command your attention with their dancing + singing. Even though Lisa outshines everyone in her group on stage (in terms of presence), it is quite telling when Jisoo and Ros\u00e9 are giving it their all while Jennie is lagging behind. And the difference between debut and the concert was more sad than anything. \n\nMaybe she's being overworked with the solo comeback + variety shows, or maybe she's just burnt out of the idol lifestyle, or any number of things. Speculating that she prefers solo to group work or that her clothes are too tight or that she's sick is a waste of time. It's impossible to know, and assuming any of those things *must* be true to justify her performance is inappropriate. We hear about idols being sick or in the hospital due to exhaustion all the time, so you\u2019d think YG would just say \u201chey she\u2019s sick\u201d and effectively kill the story. I hope she's OK physically and mentally. \n\nAs a side note, the thing which worried me even more about the concert footage was how thin every member was. I know they're idols and whatnot but they look unhealthily thin. Not trying to body shame or anything like that - it was honestly more concerning to me than Jennie\u2019s indifference. ",

Adding to that, I don\u2019t remember him doing this during Bom\u2019s scandal where he pretty much left her and 2NE1 out to dry. Really, his best move was issuing a statement from his office or from Jennie herself explaining why she was so lazy or bored on stage and they could\u2019ve used any excuse for it so long as it was attached to an apology and then the issue would pass. The only people who would remember would be the ones who actively dislike her or the group but fans would at least have an apology instead of trying to hide it. Other companies in kpop don\u2019t go this far to hide it under the rug.\n\nOverall this is just another (and the last) sign that I need to drop Blackpink and YG idol groups. He\u2019s milked the fanbases repeatedly (Blinks in particular) without new content and can\u2019t even bother to give them the respect of an apology when the issue at hand affects no one but the fans. I just don\u2019t want to support his company anymore and subsequently that means his idols too.",

I'm usually not one to talk about the sanctity of free expression on a privately owned online platform like reddit or YouTube. But it's hilarious that YG abused YT's copyright system to take down a video critical of Jennie, when the fancams from which the footage was sourced are still up. They had no grounds to take down the video, it's well within fair use. I do feel bad for Jennie and the group because of this drama, I said as much in the World Tour thread. But this is so typical of YG to spend more resources on trying to pretend like this isn't an issue, than actually owning up to criticism. Fans aren't allowed to post videos critiquing the group now because these videos use YG intellectual property? A healthy K-pop environment should have plenty of room for critique, especially of the companies, it's free expression. Low down, dirty behavior from YG as expected.\n\nEDIT: I'm gonna expose the Blonks on BP Discord who are responsible for these shenanigans. They're really a sorry lot: https://imgur.com/a/bz2pPHd\n\n* [Part 1](https://imgur.com/hsCOFDa)\n\nOrganizing brigades to remove these posts that make YG look bad.

Yeri being bullied for no reason, Kyla and Umji bullied because they don't meet typical visual standards is apparently the same as BLINKS criticizing Jennie for not giving 100% and criticizing YG for being shady. And as usual with these concern trolls, they don't care that other idols get flamed. They just want to make excuses to shield their faves. \n\n* [Part 5](https://imgur.com/Ru0D9ki)\n\nThis genius got me and /u/mylord420 all figured out.

By the way they're still trying to organize brigades against this post and even REGULAR fancams of Jennie because too many comments are critical of her dancing. ",

Also with this situation, it's like a powder keg. f(x) was never promoted so poorly for most of their careers, and there wasn't this level of favoritism at all. So you have a situation where Blackpink hardly ever promote, then suddenly after a comeback that took literally 18 months to arrive (with only AIIYL in between), BP disappeared again. Then a Jennie solo was announced out of nowhere, which really caused drama because, what the fuck, the group has nine songs and you're already doing solos? People want BP. Then YG did damage control and said \"oh actually all the members are getting a solo.\" But this increases tension.\n\nNow, with all this favoritism, and after BP being absent for most of their careers, Jennie can't even dance properly on stage for their first major concert? Fans got angry. Again let me reiterate that there could be a legitimate reason for her issues. But the way YG is handling this is terrible. ",

Sulli's situation was really bad, I genuinely felt sorry for her, in my 10 years of kpop I've never seen like it. She honestly seemed genuinely depressed(not lazy). Rumours about being lazy are definitely better than rumours about her having an abortion (and other things they said about her was just vulgar and disgusting) and even after she left idol life, she was still in the news and receiving slander just for living her life bra-less in a pic iirc. They honestly wouldn't leave her alone. Hurtful comments were thrown at her before, during, and after. Jennie is really lucky she's not going through what Sulli did. I think this issue will blow over, it's not that bad in the grand scheme of things. Once Jennie perform well with BP, we'll all forget this.",

Obviously there are mirrors and other sites but YT is the biggest by far and also one of the sites that companies can wield their influence over. I think someone at YG just came to the decision that the damage the video does is worse than the coverage of censoring it since the news cycle is so short nowadays they are probably hoping it will blow over but that the main videos won\u2019t be around anymore. Obviously there\u2019s no hiding it completely so it does seem in vain.\n\nI haven\u2019t really weighed in on the whole lazy thing bc well, the footage speaks for itself and I can\u2019t blame anyone for coming to that conclusion. Myself, I saw someone who was acting unprofessionally but painting it as being lazy is an assumption I\u2019m not quite willing to make. Obviously I\u2019m somewhat biased (Jisoo biased btw but I do identify as a blink) but I think even if it were another idol from another group I\u2019d still come to the conclusion that the person was tired or having a bad day, potentially mental health issues too though I don\u2019t throw that around lightly but whatever idk there\u2019s a lot of reasons and I don\u2019t think lazy is all that fair but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s completely untrue either so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth arguing over with the many vocal Jennie antis lately.",

I think she needs to be aware of it and take constructive criticism . I'm talking about constructive criticism NOT hate comments that are from jealous people or haters, calling someone bad names is not constructive criticism . I want to see blackpink being more confident in interviews , being themselves as artists and i want them to do great on performances . I'm sure they will improve with time and hard work but right now they are not reaching their full potential, I also believe critics are important for an artist to learn and grow and showing love as part of the fandom is important too.

Leads to the question of, can only positive things be posted? \n\nOn the other hand, I can also see why YGE took down the videos.  In this particular case, what started out to be a comparison video just evolved into one humongous hate train on Jennie that spread to other social media platforms. Some very ugly things were being said and spread around. \n\nCriticism is fine because any public figure who is a \u201cprofessional\u201d in their field should be open to it. There other existing YouTube videos criticizing Jennie (and Blackpink) that remain up and that\u2019s why I think the extreme hate on Jennie these videos generated is why YGE took action in this particular case. \n\nSome fans did some sleuthing and noticed that the creator of that original comparison video is actually the same person who runs K-BUZZ, the channel that often posts negative videos about Blackpink and other idols (Twice, Jungkook (lollll what)) to bait fan wars. As a result, some fans speculate whether there was an ulterior motive to the video as in, was it really just intended to be a comparison video? But that\u2019s a whole other discussion. \n\nRegardless, I hope Jennie finds her mojo again. ",

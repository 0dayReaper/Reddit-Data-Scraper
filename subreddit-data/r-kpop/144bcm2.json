After what he went through as TRCNG's leader, his disastrous performance on Peak Time (poor guy looked and sounded so nervous), and now this, I am genuinely worried that he might give up on his dreams of being a singer. I just want him to get a *real* chance in this industry, but I cannot imagine how discouraging and frustrating it must be for him right now.",

It is heartbreaking to say fantasyboys might be really his last chance to be an idol. I know mbc have the same format like last season with the final benefit. But still why you need benefit in the final\ud83d\ude2d\nThats what ruin his chance i think. I also think mbc could be not wanting him that much as the contract would be 7 years",

On the other hand, FB sounds like a bit of a mess already so I hope he is able to get a better opportunity somewhere soon!",

I remembered that it was claimed that all 10 were gonna sue, but then the parents of 8 ultimately decided against it, but I had forgotten they had intended to sue Wooyeop and Taeseon. Has it really been 3 and a half years already? This is entirely speculation, as I don't think we ever heard more on that aspect specifically (please correct me if I'm wrong), but I still strongly suspect that, with how little money TRCNG made for the two active years they had (with only one mini and two singles, total, none of which broke even), the parents were convinced by TS that the amount of debt they'd be put in if they sued the company and failed wasn't worth the risk. Suing Taeseon and Wooyeop back would prove to TS that they wouldn't change their minds as the lawsuit that the two had filed continued, and I imagine that TS made promises regarding the remaining boys' futures in the company, should they stay.\n\nRegardless of what went down exactly, though, it was most certianly a shit show. While I hope that Taeseon is on at least decent terms with the other boys, I would guess that you're correct, and that it had at least an impact, whether it happened that the BXB boys didn't offer, or he didn't accept.",

The oldest five were 17, three were 16, and the youngest two members were 15. After 2 years, Taeseon and another one of the older members (Wooyeop) requested the termination of their contracts with TS, citing child abuse, mismangement, violence, and neglect. Though they had said in their statement that the whole group had originally planned to file for termination together, Taeseon and Wooyeop said that 8 of them, after consulting with their families, changed their minds. The parents of the 8 members then came out in support of TS, filing a lawsuit against Wooyeop and Taeseon. A legal rep for the parents stated that Wooyeop and Taeseon had been lying about everything, and working to pit members of TRCNG against TS for months, and then playing the victim to the media. He stated that them saying that the 8 members changed their minds last minute was painting them in a negative light, and damaging to their reputations, and that Taeseon and Wooyeop were not only trying to harm TS and their reputation, but the rest of the group's careers as well.\n\n.\n\nIt should be noted, though, that Taeseon and Wooyeop were also open about their remaining trainee debt being nearly $120,000. This was not including the contract termination fees if they should lose their lawsuit against TS, nor legal fees, and that at this point TS had been sued for similar issues by at least one member of *every single group* they ever put together, and had had more than one incident of staff members speaking out about not getting paid for months. We also know that, when B.A.P sued TS, one report said that the company wanted a staggering *$2.3 million for each member* to terminate their contracts. TS's reputation was already unsalvagable, they had been physically, mentally, and financially abusive to many of their artists in the past, and had also been known to try to slander, blackmail, and coerce their artists when they fought back. We know that Wooyeop had hospital records from at least once when he had been beaten, and that there was billing evidence that confirmed that their dorms often had electricity and water cut off due to TS's lack of payment. So at the very least, there was some pretty concrete proof to corroborate Taeseon and Wooyeop's claims.\n\n.\n\nThis is why I feel pretty comfortable guessing that the lack of support for Taeseon and Wooyeop from the rest of TRCNG and their families was at least largely a financial decision based in the fear of potential outcomes. But I also imagine it still hurt a lot to not be supported by the rest of the group in their attempts to escape.\n\n.\n\nGod, I am so glad that TS folded.",

Taeseon not making it despite being one of the three main characters in the first several episodes. Hikaru who's everyone's darling not even in top 10. Myungjae and Hyeongeum are not even in the final wtf.   \n\nGlad my boy Hanbin make it tho, someone need to sing their arse off and I'm glad it was him. And Ling Qi was so good i'm glad he made it.

Especially with it being a 7 year contract. No out if he decides acting is a better career",

Maybe they were having trouble casting enough very young trainees to pull that off.\n\nThis is purely off the top of my head, but I feel like survival shows that have a lot of international contestants tend to have a generally older cast...obviously there are still some teenagers, but the overall trainee pool in both GP999 and BP seemed older to me than those in most of the original Produce series (I noticed because this was a positive for me). I think Yujin was the only trainee under 18 y/o in the top 28 on BP who had a serious chance of making the final group (sorry to Takuto and Ollie).\n\nAnyway, best of luck to these guys.",

IIRC My Teenage Girl also had older contestants like current tripleS Yooyeon, but I guess I (and I assume the people who upvoted my original comment?) had the image in my mind of Fantasy Boys being a show focused on teenage contestants because of this.\n\nBut yeah, even in the scope of having a lot of teen contestants, 14 is still *really* young.",

I for sure thought Taeseon was going in the lineup instead of Kaedan, I felt bad when I saw him cry after, and although I knew how popular Gyurae was, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be 2nd place popular, higher then rank 3 Sungmin who always ranked 1st in all weeks.

Kpop is a very ageist industry, and i honestly find it sad and discouraging that idols think they need to lie about their age to have a chance at debuting or being successful. There are several examples of this throughout generations (sistar's Hyolyn and Bora, baby vox's Lee Gai, interbd/DIP and monsta x's Wonho (not sure if confirmed yet but highly suspected) for example. Not exactly the same but KB from onlyoneof also withheld his age at debut because he was older and he or the company were worried about his reception because of it). In my opinion the ageism is an industry problem and idols or trainees shouldn't really be blamed for trying to escape it. \n\nFor the things people bring up in regards to Ksoul i never understood why the age thing usually is one of the first things they mention when there are other actually problematic things he's done.",

If you ask Twitter they\u2019ll give you a lot more but take some things with a grain of salt (if you don\u2019t watch the show) because some things they use to hate on him for are taken out of context. And a lot of it has to do with homophobia on their end towards him. \n\nHe is definitely a polarizing character and I\u2019m not shocked or surprised people hate him but me personally I love a messy person on a reality show. Especially when said show was super boring.\n\nIn the end he is a really popular person for his visuals and will definitely be bringing in that money in Japan, China and Korea. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sure the show didn\u2019t try to rig him out lol",

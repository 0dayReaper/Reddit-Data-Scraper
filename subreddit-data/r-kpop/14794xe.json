Idol judges don't have a good track record on SWF/SMF, and both BoA and Taeyong got a lot of backlash for how they judged the last two seasons.  Hopefully, they'll pair him with some pro dancers to balance the judging panel a bit.",

He's literally one of the most qualified idols to be a judge on a dance show due to his experiences before ever debuting, and Mnet knows they have to have an idol to get views.",

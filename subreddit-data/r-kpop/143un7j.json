We were hoping for a single ahead of their Lollapalooza headlining so I\u2019m so happy they are actually doing that which makes me assume the song will also be in English.\n\nI\u2019m thinking the song will just be a straight up pop song or maybe even pop rock.",

A song like \u201cif I lose myself\u201d would lowkey slap for Txt.",

Then for producing he did John Legends \u201cLegend\u201d album. \nI\u2019m honestly so excited to hear what the song sounds like. \nRyan worked on a One Direction song and a few Maroon 5 songs so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a mix of those sounds or a similar vibe. America currently doesn\u2019t have a huge boy and or anything so if the songs a hit, it would literally be everywhere.",

I would love more tracks, but I understand they were operating on a tight schedule. Baekhyun was discharged from the Military in February and Kai was already enlisted by early May; it was about three months exactly EXO had all together so the fact they squeezed a full nine songs out when DFTF only managed five in a similar timeframe is actually pretty ok.",

And Kai\u2019s solo album was also delayed so they had to work around his busy schedule too. They put together three MVs, two different fanmeets, and nine tracks in a few months despite delays and despite other potential sabotages from SM management. That\u2019s pretty good.",

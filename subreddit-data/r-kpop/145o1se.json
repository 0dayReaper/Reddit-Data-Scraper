Recently, the fifth world tour ''READY TO BE'', which boasts an all-time scale and size, succeeded in shining the presence of K-POP's representative grand girl group and creating great synergy.\n\nTWICE, who is rampant around the world, added a record for the first K-POP girl group, with combined physical and digital album sales in the U.S., to reach more than 1 million copies. Both albums and performances, which are said to be the measure of fandom size, have gained hot global popularity, reaffirming their strong influence and fandom power. Earlier, their mini-album 'READY TO BE', released on March 10, reached number two in the U.S., on Billboard's main album chart 'Billboard 200' for nine consecutive weeks. In addition, the combined sales of the \"READY TO BE\" album and streaming exceeded 153,000 copies, breaking the record for the highest-selling K-POP girl group ever.\n\nSince June, the fifth World Tour in North America has been held in Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Toronto, Canada, New York and Atlanta. Three years after partnering with Republic Records, the Los Angeles stop hit a sold-out record with its entry into the stadium.\n\nSofi Stadium is more than four times the size of the Kia Forum, where TWICE debuted its first U.S. solo concert in 2019, and measures the steep growth of TWICE. Sofi, which is called the most expensive stadium in the world, has reached $4.9 billion (about 5.7 trillion won), held the first solo concert of a K-POP girl group in the stadium on the 10th and TWICE can now leap forward as a \"stadium artist.\" Raise the expectation of gaining a foothold. The starting point of the nine U.S. cities, will announce a stronger start than ever, keeping breath with the crowds filled with seats at the stadium.\n\nIn September, the fifth World Tour will be held around the world, including Singapore, London, England, Paris, France, Berlin, Germany, Bangkok, Thailand, and Bulacan, Philippines. The Singapore concert was originally scheduled to be held once on September 2, but after the opening of the pre-sale, it sold out quickly and added one performance, and the ticket also quickly moved and achieved the all-time sold-out.\n\nContinuing global growth with 'best and first' achievements, TWICE launched its 5th World Tour in 22 regions around the world with the support of ONCE at home and abroad.",

They don\u2019t just make great singles \u2014 their best tracks imo are often not even the promotional ones. They are full album artists. And as magnetic as they are as performers, at the end of the day I could have never seen a performance and still jam to their music.",

There is no doubt about BP having wider recognition than Twice does when it comes to gp. But these groups are marketed and managed completely different from one another and their fan demographics are also likely different. So what is the result? You have more fans willing and dedicated to buying albums for Twice in the US over streaming, compared to BP who are the reverse. At the end of the day BP still are more well known to the gp, but that doesn\u2019t mean they lead in every other metric. \n\nPeople have been trying to diminish Twice\u2019s accomplishments for forever. They\u2019re always ready to shrug it off because BP should really hold whatever record being discussed. \u201cTwice have more albums\u201d - they do but they still outsold BP if you do album by album comparison, as numerous people here have shown with data to back it up.",

Twice's US fandom buy more albums and BP have better streaming from passive fans, younger fans and the general public.\n\nYou can see it from the billboard stats during the first week with their last releases.\n\n\\*note the all this is only counting first week and what was easily found. They may have sold loads of back catalogue albums or sold more after the first week but this gives you an idea. Especially note Billboard said 86% of Twices RTB stats come from physical sales and they charted for over 8 weeks with 3 separate releases, meaning they kept selling physicals well after the first week they just don't report it, hence this record.\n\nBP with Born Pink - debuted number 1 on billboard 200 with 102,000 album-equivalent units (including **75,500 pure album sales**, 25,000 stream-equivalent sales (resulting from **37.49 million on-demand streams**), and 1,500 track-equivalent sales).\n\nTwice with ready to be - debuted at number 2 on billboard 200 but number 1 on album sales with 153,000 album equivalent units (**145,500 traditional album sales** and 7,000 streaming equivalent album (SEA) from **10.28 million on-demand streams** and 500 track-equivalent sales).\n\nAs for total, BP have few physical releases and of the ones I could find US pure sales for KTL sold 9k, the album 81k and born pink 75k bringing them to 165k first week.\n\nTwice only debuted with billboard with M&amp;M, can't find pure sales for them or EWO but for the rest: TOL 43k, FOL 58k, B1&amp;2 94k and RTB 145k for a total of 340 first week.\n\nFor a further comparison, Jisoo blew everyone away with her streaming but according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2023/04/11/blackpinks-jisoo-joins-a-small-club-of-solo-female-korean-artists-with-her-first-billboard-top-10-sales-hit/) she sold 5,700 copies first week whilst according to [billboard](https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/nayeon-no-1-top-album-sales-chart-1235111945/) Nayeon sold 52k copies (98% of that coming from her physical sales).\n\nEdit - others have mentioned Twice didn't get a US distribution deal until M&amp;M in 2020, I confirmed with this [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/jyp-entertainment-republic-records-strategic-parntership-twice/) article and according to [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/blackpink-interscope-records-umg-global-deal-yg-entertainment-8481273/) BP got one in 2018.",

It's give idea about artist strength .\n\nTwice had strong sales they sold 400k+ album in tracking period. Which make for their low streams.\n\nWhile in order to chart in billboard 200 albums year end chart you need a album with strong sales and streams. Its about albums strength.\n\nTwice not charting in it shows that fol and b1&amp;2 didn't had strong sales and streams to make into chart.\n\nBlackpink not charting is both means they are  week both sales and streams \n\nTwice charting in one means they have   huge  sales that make up for  low stream.\n\n blackpink also have  sales but not enough to compete with Western artists even though their streams are more than twice  but not enough to compete with Western artists while twice",

Stray Kids just broke the record for the highest selling kpop album ever, groups are crossing a million sales like it's a joke and you're saying we're in a streaming era? That's just coping to make yourself feel better.\n\nThe only era we're in is one in which kpop is more mainstream than ever before hence leading to inflated everything, album sales, streams, YT views, voting etc.",

Only Kpop artists is where most of their charting is due to album sales, something like 70% physicals 30% streams.

If that were not the case then we wouldn't have shit like multiple album versions and digipacks etc.\n\nThe fact remains that an artist earns significantly more per album sale than they do per stream and that is why korean entertainment companies stress so much over it.\n\nAgain, you say no one is buying physicals even though most korean artists are increasing their physical sales in the US.",

If you are going to claim that Twice is bigger than Blackpink in the US due to physical album sales it is false. I\u2019m trying to explain to you how the US landscape is stream heavy which  indicates the impact an artist has in the US. Me saying no one is buying physicals in the US is still a true statement because no one except Kpop fans (and Swifties) are buying albums because there\u2019s an incentive to buying those albums. But it doesn\u2019t show impact in the US if you can get 100k physicals but only 10 million streams for a 12 track album.",

You\u2019re acting like releasing a lot of albums is the reason why they reached faster. Also they only started to have a U.S. distributor for more&amp;more in 2020 but they were like #200 on bb200. They only started to sell a good amount of albums since taste of love so that\u2019s 4 albums only. And going by your argument that Twice has more albums then the price wouldn\u2019t even matter because 2 of Twice\u2019s album would cost $50 too but they still have more total sales.",

There\u2019s nothing wrong or flawed  with having more albums but comparing the album sales of an artist with 6 albums with an artist with 2 isn\u2019t fair because one artist has more albums which should make them have more sales if we being logical. I think you misread my part on the album prices: 2 of Twice\u2019s albums cost $50\nbut 1 Blackpink album cost $50. This shows how prices of the album can also play a factor in album sales because you can buy more Twice albums than Blackpink albums because they are relatively cheaper.",

You\u2019re saying price has an impact on how much albums are sold but twice having more albums = fan spending more money anyway.

Born Pink being $50 for retailers that count for Billboard is why they didn\u2019t have high physicals for Born Pink on Billboard 200. Most US blinks bought the album on other retailers like the ones on Amazon because it was cheaper which ultimately affected Born Pink US physicals due to them not being counted as US albums.\n\nThe number of releases is a great argument because Twice released 6 albums (7 if you count Nayeon solo album)  with US distribution while Blackpink only has 2 albums that has US distribution. None of Blackpink solo albums have gotten US distribution btw. How is it far to compare a group that has 2 official US distributed albums to a group that has 7?",

Blackpink should\u2019ve started their tour with stadiums if they were THAT much bigger.\"\n\nIn fairness, BP started their US leg in the fall where 1) weather 2) football season so it can be hard (though not impossible) to coordinate a tour in football stadiums in the fall when taking into account team schedules (not sure how early in advance schedules get made), it's why a lot of stadium tours happen in the summertime\n\nAnd at least for LA, Dodger Stadium wasn't available the weekend BP had their show (Elton John concert), as well as Sofi (Chargers football game).  So BMO would make the most sense at the time (unsure if Rose Bowl had anything going on, but unsure if YG would book that considering the rest of the venue sizes for the rest of the US leg)\n\nThere are really only so many options that tour promoters can choose from once a group reaches a certain size - so it makes sense that they would be playing at the same venues for their tours.  If any of them do Rose Bowl next - that'll be an impressive feat, as that's really the only next option. (edit: OR a full on stadium tour like what BTS' MOTS tour was supposed to be but imo only bts can pull off something like that rn)",

Twice did a total of 7 in 2022 for III including the encores. Yes demand factors into but Twice sold out BOC in 20 minutes and they only announced it as an encore long after the main concerts ended. \n\nJYP constantly under estimates Twices fanbase/kpop fans (not even going into all the countries they keep skipping over or how they keep dropping new tickets yet they keep selling fast) whilst YG has been pushing BP to tour since October 2022 with barely any breaks. Tour numbers are never going to be 100% reliable because some companies dont prioritise concerts and YG is does. BP have a scheduled 62 dates so far, thats 8 less than Twices last 3 tours combined. For comparison Beyonce did less dates for Formation (48) and has announced less for Renaissance (57). BP's tour is frankly insane in scale and no kpop group is going to try to compare for at least 5-10 years.",

For example \"born pink\" sold 75k physical copies in first week but twice's \"between 1&amp;2\" and \"ready to be\" sold 94k and  153k copies respectively in first week. Also twice album sell is constantly growing with each cb since alcohol free, not to mention twice's touring number in USA is also becoming massive but blackpink's album sell in US is decreasing even after a hiatus for example they went from 81k in the album to 75k in born pink. The only thing BP is ahead is gp and casual fans attention that's why their streaming numbers look good but fandom wise twice is going stronger.",

If it wasn't for the success in music the rest wouldn't exist and why are most of the 4th gen girl groups using the same strategy as BP? All have brand deals soon after debut while BP it took years to do. Are they all just models? How models would impact the music industry and being the KPop gg with the most listened discography in the world,  the biggest tour for a K-Pop act? The impact is not just as a group but as soloists. If what you say were true, they would be releasing anything to engage this audience, not the other way around. They are the most influential gg not only in music but in fashion, there is no drag here.",

Like the members getting dough on the deals, I don't mind, yas go slay, get the bread, get paid. But YGE are profiting from those too. \n\nAnd if they were interested in growing BP as a group, musically? There should have been (at least) more BP mini albums by now, solo EP's with more than two songs, plus they're on their 7th year with their \"sound\" still being the same. \n\nLike I don't diminish the member's hard work (or belittle their achievement on sales by calling albums sold \"cheap\" lol) but YGE is just not interested and why would they? They're getting hella paid without bothering about any of that. They're here to milk BP member's popularity, get as much brand deals as they can. There's literally a Blackpink mobile game out now but no solo Ros\u00e9 full album. That should've been illegal tbh. But that's their marketing strategy, I guess.\n\nTwice is making comebacks three times a year on average and actively promoting in Korea, Japan, and US simultaneously. It makes sense for them to achieve this. Literally stop going off about your faves' influence in this particular achievement thread \ud83d\ude2d",

If you step back and look at it through an unbiased lens you see that BPs marketing and music have become stale, gimmicky, and generic.  They put no effort into evolving or growing as a group because they dont have to.  This is not a slight on the girls btw, this is 100% on YG.  BP is the group that you chat about with your friends but at the end of the day, deep down they dont really mean a hell of a lot to you personally.\n\nTwice is the polar opposite.  Twice is a group that might be less popular among your friends, but you are attached to on a more personal level.  Their music and concepts go through phases, you regularly get something new.  The members themselves feel like your friends, not some unapproachable superstar.  As such, Twice fans tend to financially support their group because they truly mean something to them. \n\nObviously both styles work, both groups are doing very well, but one is going to lend itself to more casual fans who are just going to stream on Spotify, and one is going to lead to fewer fans but who buy albums.",

            "comment": "Still imo the best discography of any SM group, and definitely one of the best K-Pop discographies of all time. Pink Tape is up there as an all-time great. They had very few releases and comebacks (they literally had 1 comeback release every year) but they made every title track and b-side count. Musicality-wise their Pink Tape-Red Light-4 Walls run is impeccable.\n\nThey definitely made an impact with their debut years with their early catchy electropop sound, but then they truly hit their peak imo when they decided to go full weird with their full albums. 4 Walls was when they went for a more clean, Eurohouse route and totally rocked it with their most consistent record. Plus LDN Noise was making a smash popularizing house music in K-Pop, and their music fit f(x) very well.\n\nVic's a variety great + let's not forget she's a terrific dancer as well. She practically held the group together as their \"mom,\" even if she was doing solo work for their later SM years. Whether she's showing off her unbelievable stretching or cracking a hilarious joke, she's always showed her capability as a leader. Amber pretty much paved the way for so many androgynous stylings in the industry, plus let's not forget the *massive* network she has in K-Pop and beyond + she was arguably the glue to most of the idols SM. Props to her too from knowing little about K-Pop to training her ass off to being a capable dancer (and arguably one of the more stable singers in the group too). Luna's a goldmine, the biggest double-threat produced by SM since BoA. Imagine getting in SM for excellent dancing and becoming a main vocalist instead - and arguably one of the best main vocalists in SM. Her Masked Singer run and her solo debut are high points. Shout-out to Amber and Luna for hard-carrying the f(x) name during the inactive years before leaving SM. Sulli's such a precious jewel, being outspoken and honest about several topics rarely talked about in the industry. Today also coincidentally also marks Sulli's 15th anniversary in the biz as well. Sulli and Luna are the source of so many bright moments of the group when they were together. Krystal's a capable performer and vocalist, with such a distinct voice that adds flavor to their songs and compliments Luna so well as a lead vocal. She's proved time and time again to be incredibly loyal to f(x), sticking around with them, reuniting when possible, placing time from her incredibly busy schedule to perform shows, and more.\n\nI'm glad Vic, Amber, Luna, and Krystal are happy doing things they love in their separate paths, whether it's solo music, acting, judging, video game streaming, or messing with each other in Instagram. They've said before they haven't disbanded but whether or not we see f(x) again, I'm happy they've left a mark one way or another.\n\nSorry for the long-ass essay haha but this group really means a lot to me getting into K-Pop a few years ago. Happy Anniversary f(x)!\n\nEDIT: Amber's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajol_llama/status/1302147470768570369) post about the anniversary \ud83e\udd7a",

I couldn\u2019t think of it as well, older groups would only do it much later into their careers like Wonder Girls, Miss A, SNSD, or Super Junior. f(x) legit had only 2 years where they had more than one Korean release (2009 &amp; 2011) so that was a really bizarre release schedule. They do have the advantage of having full albums each release though so that bulked up their discography a lot.",

            "comment": "Their anniversary is particularly bittersweet now, rest in peace Sulli. For a while they were one of the top groups and immensely respected for their musical quality. Today, thankfully Krystal is quite a well known actress and model, and Victoria is popular in China. f(x)'s music really paved the way for the girl groups of today to have a more well rounded output. I think their legacy is apparent in groups like Red Velvet, ITZY and others in that teen crush category. That hard hitting, in your face, edgy but playful sound. \n\nI'll run through their discography so people can get a taste of their awesome music.\n\nThey debuted back in 2009 with [La Cha Ta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7MHZpSNJQc) which was a big contrast from SNSD's half bubblegum half glamorous style at the time. f(x) were real spunky with a more street styling, but as an SM production their vocals and dancing had that nice glossy sheen to it. A perfect combination of fresh yet skillful. This song had [a very famous performance in the rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXk3PQDxiM) where the members got absolutely soaked. Iconic IMO.\n\nThe followup song was [Chu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnz2n5VcV4Q) and this is where they started using their trademark crunchy synths. They would become known for combining sassy, playful vocals with an aggressive electronic instrumental. \n\nTheir next song, [Nu ABO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ZrPFMr_nY) was perhaps the most representative of this style. It was quite a big hit at the time. The instrumental goes so unusually hard but their girly, chanty vocals create this great juxtaposition. Plus Amber's low voiced interjections were perfect. We have this song to thank for chanty girl group songs. Some people love them, some hate them but when they're done well they can be so good. This honestly THE teen crush progenitor song. I wish more groups would cover it these days. 2010 was a real good year for SM girl groups as SNSD were becoming legends and f(x) were enshrining themselves as an interesting alternative taste that still had widespread commercial appeal. \n\nFrom Nu ABO, the promoted B-side [Mr. Boogie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OppKDp_ecE) is a dark, electropop banger, [ME+U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er6yhwl8IUM) is super fun, on the annoyingly catchy side (and would be the namesake of their fanclub...many years later). I also like [Ice Cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyuBObOpzoM). This is like pre-Red Velvet. \n\nIn 2011, f(x) released a massive two hit punch with [Pinocchio/Danger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKS12iGFyEA) that was a continuation of the sound featured in Chu/Nu ABO. It's such an earworm, that mischievious but insanely catchy chorus and thumping beat. Many of the B-sides on the album were also great, particularly [Beautiful Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgO8wlKgdOc) (an emotional vocal showcase). [My Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQ53iNZ9J0) and [Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKgrcO-d7Rg) are ultra funky, if you like WJSN then Love should be right up your alley. \n\nThe repackage, [Hot Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-rftpZ7kCY) is maybe still my favorite f(x) song. It's a cover of a German group called Monroe but it is INFINITELY superior. It was absolutely perfect for f(x), they sped it up and made the instrumental lighter and snappier and it just frickin' works. The little vocal interjections, Krystal's mean girl voice, that unbelievably good distorted synth loop. SNSD also recorded a version of this song but it was given to f(x) instead which was really the right choice. SNSD's version was actually pretty good, with their trademark ultra polished style, but f(x) added that bit of edge that just pushed this song into masterpiece territory. \n\nFollowing up from their yuge success in 2011, they came back with [Electric Shock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8I8QGFA1oM) in 2012. The teasers were super weird and horror like so we didn't know what to expect, but the final song was yet another masterpiece. It was a bit on the darker side with a more aggressive instrumental, and it delivered mega hard. f(x)'s producers knew how to use dynamics well, that smooth pre-chorus leading into the chanty chorus was perfect. f(x) are one group that can do chanty songs and not get tiring. At least for me. From the mini, [Beautiful Stranger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk9P7aSFEl0) is universally considered the superior B-side. Melancholic, dark electropop with a hip-hop injection. \n\nThe next year, f(x) would release one of the most critically acclaimed K-pop albums of all time, the legendary Pink Tape. As someone who started listening to K-pop in second generation, a lot of albums during the hey-day (2008-2012) didn't have very many good B-sides, compared to now. Pink Tape changed that, and people really considered it to be unusually artistic compared to previous albums. The title track was [Rum Pum Pum Pum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnku4o3tRB4) and we kinda have this song to thank for the prevalence of nursery rhyme type melodies in songs these days. That guitar loop leading into the marching band pre-chorus and then the magnificent chorus is so dang good. Their vocal performance really elevates this too, those vocalizations give the song this slightly creepy vibe that totally works.\n\nPink Tape is worth listening to front to back but some highlights include the whimsical and creepy [Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LrLW-T7D-w), the high flying [Pretty Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHJBqePvMno) (that chorus, amazing), the emotional and compelling [Airplane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzN__A7yeg), the sweet acoustic ballad [Goodbye Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USkEnd9gADA) and the retro doo-wop [No More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHzRNAG908) (written by Ariana Grande). Pink Tape paved the way for future masterpieces like their own Red Light, 4 Walls, WG's Reboot and RV's The Perfect Red Velvet. \n\nIn 2014 they would release their darkest and most experimental song yet, [Red Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv-8-EgPEY0). It's one of the most unexpected title tracks ever released by a K-pop girl group. I really love the album too. [Milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uL-tSyMkyw) is so fun and catchy, and their harmonies and vocals are so tasty. [All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvKSn8oq3gI) is their contribution to the K-pop disco canon, and led to SNSD's [All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4w8IbQTJpY) and RV's [All Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU411ONfzPI).\n\nUnfortunately in 2014, Sulli went on hiatus due to health issues, and she would officially withdraw in 2015. A lot of people thought they might be the end for f(x), especially now that Red Velvet debuted and achieved considerable success by mid-2015. But they would release one more full album, and it would also be a masterpiece. I honestly like [4 Walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j7Umwfx60Q) the best out of their material, it was so thematically consistent and the songs were just fantastic. 4 Walls directly inspired GWSN (who also debuted today), its deep house sound (along with Shinee's [View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF53cptEE5k)) would become very popular in the coming years. 2015 was the year where girl group/female idol albums reached new heights, thanks to 4 Walls, Reboot, The Red and Chat-Shire.\n\nMy favorite B-sides from the album include the funky, Chromeo-like [X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k22jLPkP9Eg), the wistful, Eurodance [Rude Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7tYYNYDN7U) (that piano loop), [Papi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd2_y9z5R3A) (B-O-S-S-C-E-O) and the ultra smooth and chill [When I'm Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORtlqa0WUxs). My go to late night vibing song to this day.\n\nf(x) would only release one more song, the Station track [All Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0S3knWIdrY) which is another deep house banger. It's uplfiting, heartwarming and catchy as hell. Even though many consider the group to have been mistreated/wasted by SM, as far as disbandment songs go, it's one of the best.\n\nTheir careers had many ups and downs. I mean, really, they were DEFINITELY one of the most popular groups for a time, they were very, very successful and famous, and perhaps most importantly, they had real critical respect. But they also kinda faded away with the fans not getting proper closure. Although looking back on 2nd generation girl groups, as popular as they were in their time, many of them also had bittersweet endings. But their music will always stand the test of time.",

And she --probably used to Korean culture, idk-- said that the man should have complied with the police. Since then, she was marked as an enemy of Twitter, and therefore cancelled. There was another moment where she said something about George Floyd, in defense of George Floyd, but people didn't like what she said about that either. (Something about her saying that the police officer deserves to be charged for first degree murder, which twitter audience said would just make things worse, etc.) This time, it spiraled into flat out hate against her, even to the point of a rumor that she was pregnant, (then people said very nasty rude things, like \"Who would want to impregnate her?\", etc.) \nShe finally had enough and tweeted a heated response that was well overdue. \n\nIt looks like that has died down, and the Twitter mobs have calmed down.",

I remember when they first debuted...\n\nSuch a shame that we didn't get a proper goodbye single or an OT5 concert (that was released on home video), but f(x) really was *the* girl group who paved the way for Western expansion along with Wonder Girls.\n\nCongrats girls! Hope y'all are celebrating wherever you are. And hope Hara and Jonghyun are throwing you a nice party up in The Good Place, Sulli!\n\nTo celebrate, I'm going to recommend one b-side from each album:\n\n* \"[Ice Cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyuBObOpzoM)\" off *NU ABO:* a cute little electropop ditty (composed by Hitchhiker) with baby f(x). The OG Ice Cream metaphor song, lol.\n* \"[Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKgrcO-d7Rg)\" off *Pinocchio:* pretty much the only f(x) song in their entire discography that has never been performed live - which is a shame since it's the only Sweetune song the group has ever recorded. This song deserved a live performance.\n* \"[\uc88b\uc544\ud574\ub3c4 \ub418\ub098\uc694 (...Is It OK?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pAi6oMQJ9w)\" off *Hot Summer*: If you're a classic OST song fan, this is the song for you. It was used in the K-Drama *Paradise Ranch.* Funnily enough, it actually was [performed live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5HXGXrv0Gk) in 2011, though it doesn't look like Krystal was at the performance.\n* \"[Love Hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jbSo--Px0U)\" off *Electric Shock*: Another banger that unfortunately never got performed live. It has that marching band feel mixed with the electropop sound, with the song sort of coming across as almost \"candid\" because it sort of plays fast and loose with the vocals (there's a lot of chanting/sing-speaking style used here).\n* \"[Toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BnmmOYgxmM)\" off *Pink Tape*: An in-your face kiss off song to those terrible boyfriends mixed with female self-empowerment. A sassy banger and one of the best songs off *Pink Tape* IMO.\n* \"[Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lV3UyoQaLg)\" off *Red Light*: While the lyrics lean more toward love song, the beat is the closest we get to a hoe anthem. The synths and beat are *dirty*.\n* \"[Cash Me Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fvRpuhQIMY)\" off *4 Walls:* Ah, the long gestating song that finally got released (it was intended to be on *Pink Tape*, but got removed from the track list at the last minute). It's admittedly a bit dated, but it fits well on *4 Walls* over *Red Light* IMO (it was allegedly intended to be repurposed as part of a RL repack before Sulli went on hiatus). Originally released by Zara Larsson, this song is just pure pop fun.\n\nLove these girls and this group. Still my ultimates, and here's to another year of f(x) greatness!",

Vic and Krystal became too busy for them to have a group cb; even in 2016 Krystal wanted to squeeze in f(x) performances like Kcon France for example even if she had a stacked sched. Watching behind-the-scenes videos from that you could tell Vic and Krystal sometimes barely made it to f(x) scheds mostly because they wanted to perform for the group despite their busy schedules.\n\nPlus, f(x)'s popularity was decreasing because of a mix of Sulli's controversies + departure and the fact that they took forever in coming back since they usually came back once a year then dipped, but honestly it didn't really make sense since they still sold really well regardless of what happened. SM moved on to more profitable junior groups and decided to keep Vic and Krystal busy with solo stuff since that raked in more money. Luna and Amber were the only ones still doing more music but they were the bottom of f(x)'s popularity (popularity gap between f(x) members were unfortunately huge) so a lot of their solo music didn't do well or make an impact commercially. For most of 2016-2018 the two hard-carried f(x)'s name and even performed a couple of shows as f(x) as a duo. Eventually both of them also took the hint and began moving on as well, like Amber signed to a US label in '18 (which she went to full-time after leaving SM) and Luna still put out solo music &amp; did theater. f(x) weren't doing much as a group, hence they don't have a lightstick nor a Twitter account, and they even shut down the fanbase for inactivity.",

I still remember reading online when each member was revealed and I was so excited for the international lineup. Victoria instantly caught my eye as my bias (though every member has been my bias wrecker). That was one of the first times we got to see non-Korean members in a girl group as well. (Later followed by miss A!) \"La chA TA\" is still my favorite debut to this day and I will always consider them my ultimate girl group, even if it hurts to see how things ended and how there was not even a 10th year anniversary celebration. I really feel lucky to have seen them live at SM TOWN in NYC back in 2011, as that was one of the only few opportunities to see them live in the USA (the other one being SXSW). \n\nf(x) had set a new standard for girl groups in K-Pop for both music and style in that transition going from 2nd to 3rd generation. Their discography is still one of the strongest and albums like \"Pink Tape,\" \"Red Light,\" and \"4 Walls\" haven't aged one bit! Their fashion also declared them as trend setting icons, like how we didn't start to see tennis skirts and more uniform-inspired looks until f(x) did it!  Not to mention their more eccentric styles earlier in their career.\n\nAs for the awful tragedy with our dear Sulli, I always think of her and I've never been more hurt at a celebrity death. I practically grew up watching her perform and alongside f(4) they all were a big part of my life from going to high school, to college, and starting my first jobs as an adult. I am in the same age range as them and seeing them thrive makes me as happy as seeing childhood friends thrive. I will always keep supporting their individual activities and I will never forget Sulli. Although it's hard to listen to her Goblin EP to this day, I'm still grateful she got to release a solo. Always admired her outspoken and truthful personality and respected her decision to leave the group. \n\nI'm excited to see what Amber, Victoria, Krystal, and Luna have in store for us in the future! I loved Luna's OST songs and her cover of Doja Cat's Say So, now that she's in a new agency I hope her new album shows us her true colors. Victoria's debut Chinese album is also very good, a lot of great pop tracks, dance anthems and ballads in it but you can definitely see she's set to promote only in China. At least I'm glad her album is available internationally! Krystal has teased exciting projects coming up with her departure from SM, maybe an album? And as for Amber despite her controversies on social media I still really admire her starting over in the USA as an artist. It's definitely not the same and with it comes many challenges. I've been supporting her new American releases and saw her in concert. Happy Anniversary f(x), MeU's always will love you!",

I remember listening to Rude Love for the first time - it felt like a revelation, one of those 'timeless' songs I've heard over the years that has truly made me *feel* in a way I hadn't before. Thank you for giving us such amazing music, Victoria, Amber, Luna, Krystal, and Sulli.",

Like everyone said, f(x)'s sound just seems so timeless and wouldn't be out of place at all in this era. I'm just salty with how it ended up, and Sulli's passing affected me way more than I thought it would have.",

They had this signature style that you can truly call their own. Not to mention aesthetic queens. I'm just so happy that they will not disband and I hope we will hear their music soon. Pinktape+Red Light+ 4 WALLS really deserves to be called the holy trinity. F(X) IS AHEAD OF THEIR TIME.",

                    "comment": "from an interview with Esquire back in April:\n\nJonghyun: A few years ago, I was crying and whining at my mom and sister while I was really drunk. I asked my mom and my sister.. it wasn\u2019t long after we\u2019d moved. I asked them if they were happy. I got drunk and woke up my entire sleeping family, like some ahjussi. It had been my number one goal in life, you know, to make my mom and sister happy. They both woke up and told me they were happy. But I was so envious at the fact that they were able to reply that they were, indeed, happy. Because it wasn\u2019t like that for me. I told them while sobbing: \"I want to be happy too.\" Then I felt like I\u2019d done my mom and sister wrong. But from then on, I started contemplating about happiness. For about six months, I pondered specifically over what I would need to do in order to become happy. I think that time of transformation has come. I think I need to become happy, now. I must become happy. I am going to be happy.\n\nedit: If you're interested, highly recommend reading the full interview. It shows what a sensitive and intelligent guy he was.\nhttps://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/20274898.html",

Like after I finish a big project at work, the people around me would say that to mean \"thanks for your hard work\" or \"you went through a lot of trouble to complete (whatever)\". \uace0\uc0dd\ud588\ub2e4 are words of comfort, rather than that of despair.\n\nIn the context of a suicide note, it has a really sad finality to it. Because one would say this to another person after the person finishes something, in a sense, Jonghyun is saying \"[This is the end of my life/I've completed my life,] so please tell me I did a good job.\"",

I used to know all the lyrics and we used to do the dances too. I went through the obligatory 'kpop phase' during my teens but these days I only listen to anything Korean once in a blue moon.\n\nBut we'd always promised that when we got enough money, we'd travel to Korea or Japan to see them perform. That's a promise we still share, even though I see her once a year or less now.\n\nI'm hoping, if anything, that companies like SM will learn from this and understand that artists are human too; incredible ones, yes, but still human and in need of help at times. I can't imagine the rest of SHINee being able to go straight back to performing... That'd tear me to shreds.\n\nRIP, J.",

Late Jonghyun was found collapsed in a residence in Chungdam, was sent to a university hospital, but was declared death by the hospital,' and confirmed the death.  \n\n&gt;SM stated 'Although it is not comparable with the family who has to send their loved ones, Shinee members, SM entertainment artists and staffs are shocked, and are all expressing our regret and condolences.  \n\n&gt;Continued 'Jonghyun was a great artist who loved music than anyone else, and always had tried the best during performances. We are very sorry to report to all the fans who had sent Jonghyun all the loves.'  \n\n&gt;**SM had also said 'To let the family cherish the condolences, we urge everyone not to spread rumours or any news without a source**  \n\n&gt;The family had wanted a quiet and small funeral, only with the company relatives and families. \n\n**Final update from Yonhap News**  \n\n&gt;At 4:42PM, Jonghyun's older sister Kim had called the police and said 'I think my brother is committing suicide.'  \n\n&gt;She had a received a message right before that from Jonghyun, saying 'It was very tiring until now,' 'Send me now, and tell (them/me) that I had tried/suffered,' 'Last goodbye' conveying the extreme choices that he may make.   \n\n&gt;Jonghyun, in 16th, two days ago, had told her sister that he felt 'down and tiring'  \n\n&gt;After the call, police had searched Nonhyun district and Chungdam district. After a location tracking, the police had found Jonghyun's car in the 'residence' parking lot. It took the police 1 hour and 20 minutes to find the room.\n\n&gt;The police had opened the door with 119 emergency service at 6:10 PM, finding Jonghyun, unconscious and lying on the ground.  \n\n&gt; When the police found Jonghyun, his heart had already stopped working, and emergency service had given him CPR as they were transporting him to a hospital, but had failed to put Jonghyun conscious again.  \n\n&gt;It was declared as dead in 6:32PM. The body was moved to the chapel of rest.  \n\n&gt;Jonghyun was not found in house, instead, he was found in a 'residence' in which he had booked for two nights this afternoon. There were no notes from Jonghyun left behind.  \n\n&gt;The police had found a 'heating element' that was burnt (note - should be a briquette, as this is a 'common' way of committing suicide in Korea as it omits carbon monoxide), and with the fact that the room was full of smoke, the police is assuming that Jonghyun had tried to commit suicide, and is currently investigating.   \n\n&gt;The police is currently discussing with the family regarding the autopsy. \n\nThis is an Yonhap news extra, and there are no main text.\n\nI will add as more news comes by.  \n\n\nJungang News says that Jonghyun was moved to hospital but he had passed away.  \n\nJonghyun was in an officetel.\nReport says that there were briquettes burning   \n\n\nUPDATE  from News1\n\n18\uc77c \uacbd\ucc30\uacfc \uc18c\ubc29\ub2f9\uad6d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 \uc885\ud604\uc740 \uc774\ub0a0 \uc624\ud6c4 6\uc2dc 45\ubd84\ucbe4 \uc11c\uc6b8 \uccad\ub2f4\ub3d9\uc758 \ud55c \ub808\uc9c0\ub358\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc4f0\ub7ec\uc9c4 \ucc44 \ubc1c\uacac\ub410\ub2e4.\n\n\uac00\uc871\uc758 \uc2e4\uc885 \uc2e0\uace0\ub97c \ubc1b\uace0 \ucd9c\ub3d9\ud55c \uacbd\ucc30\uc740 \ub808\uc9c0\ub358\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ud604\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac, \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc62e\uacbc\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub05d\ub0b4 \uc228\uc84c\ub2e4. \n\n&gt;Police and the Emergency had stated that Jonghyun was found at 645PM today at a residence in Chungdam, Gangnam.\n\n&gt;The police had found Jonghyun after the family\u2019s report.\n\n&gt;Police said that he was moved to a hospital after reports, but had passed away.  \n\n\n&gt;SM entertainment is currently not reachable \n\n\nUPDATE 2:  OSSEN   \n\nGangnam police had confirmed that they are \u2018sure\u2019 of Shinee Jonghyun\u2019s death.

Staffs had commented that they could not sense anything from the song or from Jonghyun when they were working with him. Another staff had commented that the song has a very happy atmosphere, and he looked normal during the MV shoot.  \n\nA relative had commented that 'although I can't confirm, I heard that he had made a car contract recently.. he worked as usual so I could not sense anything wrong.'  \n\n\n\n\n\n*It seems like the news is true.

He really managed to brighten up any show or stage he was in, despite his depression.\n\nHe always felt very true and honest in the way he presented himself and his music to the world, for better or worse. He'll be missed for sure. On a personal note, I didn't expect the news to effect me as much as it does when I initially read it. As someone who struggles with depression and has convinced those around me that I've kicked it, and continues to deal with insomnia on a daily basis, seeing someone who seemingly was living with it and had many things going for him still being unable to continue is heartbreaking. Your mind can be one of the scariest things you ever have to face, and it truly doesn't matter who you are, it effects you all the same.",

I did not expect it to hit me as hard either because I'm just a casual fan of him tbh but literally just putting myself in his thought process of even *contemplating* suicide is really relatable as a human being going through something similar and having been there before.\n\nYet he wrote these amazing pieces of work talking about deep issues and helping people go through them, it just makes it so bittersweet..\n\nFor e.g I was compelled to listen [Breathe by Lee Hi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAskV-eUqeA) just this past month alone because it's one of my go-to slow songs. I finally had an urge to learn the lyrics because I kept mumbling it each time and when I googled it, the lyrics just broke me... I had thought it was an \"emo\" song but it's so much bigger than that. \n&gt; If I tell you \u201cit\u2019s alright\u201d\n\n&gt;I know that they\u2019re only words\n\n&gt;When someone sighs\n\n&gt;How can I understand\n\n&gt;Such deep breaths, Your sigh\n\n&gt; Even though I won\u2019t be able to understand its depth, that\u2019s okay\n\n&gt;I will embrace you\n\nIt's about understanding everyone goes through tough times but it's alright to just let out a breath despite it all. The writer captures being overwhelmed so well, but more than that, the message is about comforting others? When I found out it was written by Jonghyun I was about to break down and cry in awe. It just speaks about what kind of person he is...was. What a pure heart. Sigh. I'm just so sad such a kind person is no longer with us.",

We would go there and just stand outside in the winter for hours on end (and skipping school) waiting for a glimpse of an idol. I remember across the street from the building was a salon, SHINee was getting ready for an event that day. All of the members got dropped off right at the door of the salon in a van. Except Jonghyun, he came walking up the other side of the street and immediately started smiling and waving at us. There were only a few of us there outside the building, but he seemed like he really wanted to make us happy. \n\nI also remember seeing him on his birthday in 2012, at a fansign event. My best friend wore her school uniform to the event. We were sitting in the crowd waiting for our turns to go up and see them, when my friend caught Jonghyun's eye in the audience. She was trying to show off her school uniform to him but he just seemed confused haha. But he still smiled and waved. \n\nThat day at the fansign, I wished Jonghyun a happy birthday. I also told him it was my birthday in a couple days, hoping to get a special happy birthday wish from him. Now that I think back, I feel selfish for trying to make it about me, when it was his day.\n\nWhen we were in the audience of Hello Counselor, Jonghyun said he remembered us from the fansign, and remembered my friend wearing her school uniform and being so proud of it. Although I had met all the members a couple times before the show was filmed, he was the one that remembered us and really seemed like he cared and wanted to make us happy.\n\nI feel like he was always just wanted to make other people happy. And I wish there was someone who could've made him happy.",

I would watch my favorite singers/comedians on stage and think that since they could be so happy on screen I could too, and this was a big thing for me because I would have these bouts of self-hatred and just... sadness. Then I found out that one of my favorite comedians has attempted suicide before and just felt really broken inside. If these strong people on stage couldn't hack it, what chance do I have?\n\n\nI think you should look at it this way. I think that Jonghyun would have been really happy to know that he brought light and smiles to so many people around the world, and when you feel sad I want you to know, random person on the internet, that I think that he would be proud of you, a fan, who could keep on living as happily as possible through all the trials and pain that life can deliver.\n\n\nlove and peace, man. dm me if you need anything.",

He was one of the very few idols who openly spoke about troubling societal issues and supporting LGBT rights. Even as he was in pain, he never stopped trying to give others happiness.\n\nJonghyun was also one of the most talented idols Kpop had to offer. One of the best main vocalists of his generation, an accomplished dancer and producer, Jonghyun was always giving pieces of himself to the world: his thoughts, his heart, his voice. He was the epitome of selflessness.\n\nAs a personal note: SHINee was the first Kpop concert I went to and Jonghyun\u2019s charisma made the stage his own. He wasn\u2019t even my bias then but his innate ability burned on the stage and I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of him.\n\nRest In Peace, Jonghyun. You deserved everything good and beautiful in the world and now that the pain has passed, I hope with all my heart that you finally get everything you had been denied.",

(I recognize the songs now and get them stuck in my head it's coming out of her room so much).  I saw this on the news today and spent 20 minutes on her Instagram trying to figure out if he was one of her favorites from the pictures she posts. \n\nEither way I knew it would upset her.  I wasn't sure if she knew when I picked her up from school but she was very quiet, while her sister was talking up a storm.  When we go home and she had put her things away, I just gave her a hug.\n\n\"What is this for?\"\n\n\"I just wanted to give you a hug..\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I thought you might be sad.\"\n\nThat was all it took, she broke down as she said she was upset.  She's worried about her friends who he was their favorite and she's also crushed.  It was odd, I was 13 when Kurt Cobain died and as I was hugging her that's what I kept thinking about.  \n\nWhether now or 20+ years ago, it hurts to see someone who just feels they can't go on.  I'm sure a lot of you here are impacted just like my daughter is, and I want to extend my sympathy and thoughts to all of you the fans and say I hope this artistic soul has found the peace he so desperately wanted.

Rest in peace sweet angel. Life is never going to be the same again and I don't know what to do anymore because I'm still in shock. \n\nThis is Jonghyun performing [Breathe](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vJFL6Avyae8). I am crying non-stop and I don't know if I will ever be okay. This is the first time I have ever ever lost someone I love. Shawols around the world, let us pray.

Shinee was the first k-pop group I really fell in love with, and Jonghyun was my first bias. I saw him in the Dream Girl video and immediately gravitated towards him. Discovering Shinee's music helped me to cope with the death of my grandfather back in 2016. I always thought it would've been much harder without them as a distraction. I ended up traveling to Chicago to see Shinee in concert, afraid that it'd be one of the last opportunities before they went into the military. Being able to experience their music live has since been one of my most cherished memories. I just never dreamed something like this would happen.. I just can't believe it. I'm in absolute shock. Shinee is such a wonderful group of guys, I hate that they've been met with this tragedy, and my heart hurts for Jonghyun's family. I don't even know what to say. ",

I didn't have the money, I had nobody to go with, I could always go see them another time- those were the excuses I told myself. But now I'll never see him. I'll probably never see them.\n\nHe was such a bright light. He openly supported the LGBT+ community, he was hilarious, he had such a nice smile, and he was such a talented musician and singer. Whenever people would say that Korean idols can't sing, I'd be inclined to just point them to Jonghyun.\n\nThese coming days will be hard- just like they were with Kim Joo Hyuk. The news is one thing, but seeing the barrage of articles about his death- why, how, who's going to the funeral- especially in the case of suicide- will be horrible. I hope people can show some restraint and respect when reflecting on his life- focus on the positive. ",

You can just listen to him sing and feel like you're listening to some good jazz...even if the song is not jazz.\n\nBut when he goes low it's also so pleasing. He probably would've had a great voice for scat singing too.\n\nIMO his falsetto singing voice was like the glue for Shinee's group...not sure how they're going to recover from this... :( ...not that they should continue as a group, if they want to do different things or retire from kpop...",

Shinee debuted when I was 14/15 and I instantly loved them. I loved Replay and I even try to learn the dance with some friends (when I had kpop friends irl) which I remember fondly. They made me so happy. I also listened to some of his compositions, they are beautiful. I kinda lost track of them after Lucifer but I still smiled when I saw their stages. My favorite song of them is View because it\u2019s a song I shared with my best friends (non-kpop) and we all liked, besides I loved watching the fan chants in a concert (on YouTube hehe), the chorus and the light blue (I don\u2019t remember the correct color rn) ocean, they had me in that moment. I have been bawling on and off since I woke up and I\u2019m not even a Shawol, so I can\u2019t imagine how they must be feeling.\nMy wording may not be the best as I\u2019m not a native speaker but I respectfully wish that at least his death makes the Korean public more open to talk about mental health and generates changes on how the society stigmates depression. Thank you Jonghyun for the happy moments. I wish I could have had a way to give you a reason to at least smile when you were having a hard time, a way to reciprocate the happiness.

While SHINee has never been my top of the top, they're definitely up there and I'm grateful to say I had the pleasure to see them live more than once. Rest in peace, Jonghyun, and may you find peace in your next life, whatever that may be.\n\nAs someone who deals daily with the pains of depression, this hits close to home for me. I've seen so many comments asking, you know, why didn't he seek help, etc etc... The truth is, sometimes we just can't ask. And even those of us who can... well, try being a person with mental illness living in Korea. I've been living here for five and a half years because I was lucky to find a company that accepted my application in spite of my medicine. I was fired from one job before I even arrived because they hadn't read the information on my visa correctly and decided they couldn't handle a teacher with mental illness. And if I ever breathed a word of it to my students, even to support one who admitted to suffering, many of their parents would be lobbying for me to be out of the classroom.\n\nThe high suicide rate in this country is not just because people are overworked. It's also because many people here have no one to turn to without fear of being ostracized. Jonghyun is among those who did speak up, but just speaking up isn't enough.\n\nI can only hope in vain that Korea will finally learn something from the death of someone so young and talented and tortured. We should not be invisible.",

I was inspired a lot by him because his creativity was just off the charts and so unique. His work was so distinct and really left a mark on the industry. I just saw his final Agit: The Letter concert date in July, and he made my first k-pop concert experience glorious. He was cheerful, engaging, and warm. He thanked us so many times for being there and always supporting him.\n\nIt's crazy to think that he was hiding so much pain underneath that bright exterior.\n\nI just...I still can't believe he's dead. He was only 27, a year older than me.\n\nMental health NEEDS to be discussed about more, especially in high stress industries like the entertainment industry because depression seems to be the most silent but deadly side effects of the industry that we don't see until it's too late.\n\nJonghyun, I know you'll never read this, but I hope that you're in a better place now and that you're in no more pain. We'll miss you, but know that you've left a legacy behind that will never be erased.\n\n\uace0\ub9c8\uc6cc \ub355\ubd84\uc774\uc57c.",

Really if you need help, please seek it.\n\n**Edit:** Looking back at some of the songs he wrote, and some of his Instagram posts, you can tell that he was suffering greatly from a previous relationship that he had had. From Gloomy Clock, to Lonely, to Love is so Nice, they all seem to be about an ex-girlfriend or some sort of 'dream girl'.\n\nHis [latest instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbtvv0mDvdM/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=jonghyun.948) is a song called Beside You by Dear Cloud. The lyrics are quite dark and linger about struggles of past relationships.\n\nIt is easy to say in hindsight, but if idols would have the courage to quit out of an idol group (like Taehyun - WINNER) many things would be a lot better... \n\n**It really should be compulsory for companies to provide mental training/support/lessons for their idols now.**\n\n**Edit 2:** Kind of irrelevant but the news of Jonghyun's death has amassed almost 4 million searches on Weibo in 1hr's time. China-Korea really gotta sort of their relations. It's clear that K-entertainment has a massive impact over in China. Really hope they fix their relations soon. SM is the 2nd most searched real time topic @ 1million searches. \n\nSM gotta sort their shit out and make a statement asap\n\n**Edit 3:** Jonghyun &amp; SHINee songs [charting top on Melon realtime charts](http://www.melon.com/chart/rise/index.htm#params%5Bidx%5D=1) - more specifically, the ones that talk about depression and struggles\n\nYour talent, and the joy you brought to others will be missed.

I know people talked about how quickly NewJeans moved up but the hype around Fifty Fifty wasn't even fully focused until at least a month or two after their debut..it was like, their debut album was a sleeper hit since no one really were looking forward to their debut. I didn't think we would see a group replicate that kind of success so soon.",

I mean no ill-will towards NewJeans, but yeah, they had the whole Kpop fandom waiting with anticipation. \n\nI consider myself to be pretty aware of what girl groups are debuting and the day they dropped The Fifty, I was recommended Higher on YouTube and remember thinking \"how did this group slip through my radar?!\"",

They also seem particularly interested in kpop. Kpop has been slow to shed the one-hit wonder because, well, its pretty hard for small companies to weasel their way into any sort of staying power, which seems to have just become harder in the last ten years. Korean entertainment companies are all still very young comparatively (the oldest is perhaps 35? ish years old) and Warner (which just turned 100) actively joining the game is going to make the next few years of kpop some to watch! \n\nFor Barbie, I imagine it might just be Cupid bc it would line up well with their planned promotions abroad. Which is cool, this movie is set up to be a summer hit and lots of its audience will have never heard the song before. My local radio stations are pretty slow to pick up top 40 songs from the internet, haven't yet, but the feature in the Barbie movie should give this chart staying power.",

It\u2019s based on timing \u2014 no promotions, radio spins, excessive performances can give you public attention in America like a lovely viral song everyone likes.\n\nFIFTY FIFTY have naturally achieved what many of these labels have invested millions on. \n\nThey released a cute R&amp;B Pop hit in the middle of the Y2K wave, no resources whatsoever just fans talking about it to each other and using it as the background for edits and TikToks (the world\u2019s biggest platform). It\u2019s now the longest charting K-Pop girlgroup song on the Hot 100\u2019s chart history. They\u2019re set to feature in probably the most talked-about upcoming movie in the US, with A-listers like Dua Lipa, and sitting beside other rising stars like PinkPantheress and Ice Spice. These are the kind of opportunities an act should take after such a big hit.\n\nCongratulations FIFTY FIFTY! no doubt their album will be a huge success, and that they\u2019re up for something big. This is just the beginning. I imagine their CEO must be astonished with all of this.",

It's no coincidence that this songs English version is what went viral and is what is playing on the radio, in grocery stores, is getting the streams and this movies song will almost guaranteed to be sung in English too.\n\nImagine them not releasing an ENG ver. It would have made sense! The company is small and strapped for cash. Why pay and do that extra work when your odds are so far fetched? But they did it and it was worth the dice roll! That's what I keep saying Kpop needs to do!! \n\nI'm sorry but what the West is loving about Cupid is not that different from IVE's 'Love Dive' and 'I Am' offer sonically. Those songs would be eaten up if they were remade, well, in ENG. I don't get why companies, especially ones with Western friendly music, don't take the same gamble Fifty Fifty did.",

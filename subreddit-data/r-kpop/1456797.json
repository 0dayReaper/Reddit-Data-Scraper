I went years thinking they barely knew each other only to find out they\u2019re actually very close\u2026 and apparently close enough for Kyungsoo to film a tiktok dance challenge?????? for his boy group lol\n\nAnyway Baekhyun was not lying when he said Kyungsoo has leveled up his dancing! Visually, he doesn\u2019t even look out of place next to rookies~",

D.O is so un-idol-like in many ways so to see him suddenly turn up on TikTok doing a dance challenge with a rookie boy group is wild! Also having a giggle he didn\u2019t participate in the Rover or Betcha challenges\u2026 Kaibaek are under his bed as we speak. \n\nAlso how does a 30 year old blend in so well with a group of newly debuted puppies?! Make it make sense. But it\u2019s genuinely lovely such a senior and famous idol did this challenge with a brand new group who aren\u2019t his labelmates\u2026 what a darling. \n\nP.S. having a wee chuckle over an EXO member rocking up at Hybe in the middle of a lawsuit\u2026 I bet SM execs are *sweating*",

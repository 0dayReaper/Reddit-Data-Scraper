Along with the general lack of content since their anniversary outside of the fan meeting...what is going on?\n\nSNSD's 15th anniversary last year was an event that demanded attention and I had high expectations for SHINee.  I'm truly confused at this point.\n\nI don't want to dismiss \"The Feeling\", I loved that song and watching the MV is a pure shot of serotonin.  I'll give credit where credit is due.\n\nEnd of my rant for now, I have my fingers crossed for some jaw dropping teasers tomorrow.  Maybe an album detail?  Something?  Anything?",

I'm so glad their 15th anniversary was given the attention it deserved, but I remember people talking about how SM fumbled the promos and just the general hype around the anniversary for their 10th. \n\nIt sucks because I had very low expectations from SM generally about this long-awaited anniversary celebration, and this scenario where they're dragging things out for this album is also the last thing I wanted, too. Like, Key having to basically call out the fact that they didn't even mention The Feeling was an anniversary video is just... I really hope things pick up now though, they deserve it so much.",

The biggest difference is the lack of a show like Soshi Tam Tam, maybe I'm off base but I don't think people were expecting SHINee to do something like that. And if you throw in their fanmeetings (which to be fair were marred somewhat by the whole venue issue) and upcoming concerts, SHINee's not really doing any less than what SNSD did. It just feels different because of the hype. There was more hype around SNSD's comeback because it was sort of a one time event; it had been years since their last comeback and the next one is probably years away too, if it happens at all. Without that extra oomph from fans who had been waiting so long, SHINee's comeback seems like it's lacking in comparison.",

I'm sorry to bring it up but with Onew not being able to promote with the members for this comeback, they might need to reconfigure things with how they're going to incorporate his voice and his presence into these promo concerts, music shows, and variety shows. They need to figure this out without people poking around analyzing everything they're doing. Shawols are being patient and letting them do what they need to do. Just wait.",

The only exciting thing we have received this era is the release of The Feeling MV - but you can't even count it, because the members insist it's not a pre-release but an anniversary fansong, and they paid for the production themselves. So SM doesn't have much to do with it. \n\nAnd yes, looking back at SNSD's anniversary comeback... it was so exciting and my favorite kpop event of 2022. I thought there would be similar fanfare for SHINee's 15th, but it's been so weird, empty, and anticlimactic, it's legit making me sad, especially knowing that they can't even promote together. One would think that considering that, they would at least try to drum up hype with teasers and press, but they're doing NOTHING for SHINee, and I'm so sick and tired.",

That powerful, anthemic chorus is perfect for their style, combining that little quirky electronic loop with the low synth and punchy beat. Guitarpink in the verses is a great throwback to those Stay days, while transitioning to a more EDM style for the chorus is exactly what they needed for maximum catchiness. Very singalongable song.

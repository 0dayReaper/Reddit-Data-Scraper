This is clearly the music that YG (the company, not the person, although YG the person is way too fucking involved with every aspect of the company) wants him to produce. This is the YG \"sound\" and has been for at least a decade. There's no point in him writing other stuff for BP if YG only wants stuff that sounds like this. \n\nThen again I also wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these songs were written in like 2010 for 2NE1 and just never got released. YG loves sitting on songs for years.",

Then the Blackpink trademark chorus drop happened, and it's back to the same formula. Same beat drop, no singing chorus, Lisa rap in the second verse (which was great btw, her rap itself was good). The bridge (did this even have a bridge in the traditional sense?) and ending verse is a bit of a let-down for me, personally. So reminiscent of KTL but didn't really get me as excited as the start of the song did. \n\nAnyway the girls look absolutely stunning, each of them had moments to shine. Thank goodness they're finally out of the dungeon. When \"Blackpink!\" came on after the second chorus I was so glad to hear it.",

Visuals are great. They are definitely the most consistent act so far, but that's not a good thing. Taking a risk isn't bad. At least if you go down you can get back up. You learn and grow. Being stuck in space and time musically gets old fast and people were already bored of the copy and paste style of their promotional hits.",

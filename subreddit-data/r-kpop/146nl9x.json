I can\u2019t wait to see what they have in store for us!\n\nAlso really glad we will see more of Vivi again.\n\nNow the race for which unit or member will promote first. Oec, HyunVi, Chuu or Heejin haha. I think it will be Oec first up since they are the hot summer unit ! And have been seen doing a photoshoot.\n\nEdit : they both really be ride or die. Been with each other since 1/3 days. Hyunjin stayed behind with her before putting in their injunctions. And now new agency together and I guess a unit redebut!\n\nAlso Vivi staying at Hyunjins during chuseok and camping with her family. Hyunjin says Vivi is her dongseng too haha. They have such a wholesome bond.\n\n[This is so sweet, translation via @litell_johnn hyunjin promises to take care of Vivi](https://twitter.com/litell_johnn/status/1667797198237491201?s=46&amp;t=MaSWmDhkgkfQIXOVTHON3w)\n\nBbi-haeng = Vivi\n\n&gt;Leave Bbi-haeng to me  \n&gt;I'm gonna take good care of her  \n&gt;\u263a\ufe0f\n\nAlso [eng via @jeonghaseul](https://twitter.com/jeonghaseul/status/1667894941861945345?s=46&amp;t=MaSWmDhkgkfQIXOVTHON3w)\n\n&gt;someone asked hyunjin what could be the reason for her choosing ctde&amp;m and she said that her and the ceo are on the same wavelength (the mindset of wanting to challenge/try stuffs) ;;\n\n&gt;also she said that a company is really important too, a company should have a good teamwork with the artists too so theyd be on a roll, would be a good partner to grow together",

Maybe I'm wrong but it seems likely to me that in this small new company we never get much from them really where as they could have gone places had they joined ModHaus and rebuilt the group with one of the OG founders of Loona and at least gotten the Orbit support. Now with them fractured it seems like things will get tougher. \n\nI don't blame them. Maybe they didn't want to go back to a big group, maybe they don't share the ModHaus vision, maybe the company they're at pays more, who knows. It just seems like their odds of having any level of success just dropped by a lot and even at ModHaus they weren't that high to begin with. \n\nMy question is what do they redebut as? Does this company build a new group? Do they redebut as a duo? Soloists? Starting over as a new group with new people seems like a rough start over but duos basically don't exist and who is paying for them as soloists if way more popular idols are struggling as soloists? I don't see the path.",

My reasoning that they will join CTD and not others is their familiarity with the CEO and starting from scratch is a risk in a competitive industry. The LOONA brand is still stronger than individual and my guess is they will form the remaining 1/3 team with Yeojin at CTD. yyxy team will probably form at Modhaus as many have suggested here. Heejin will probably be going solo.\n\n1/3 team is not formed at Modhaus as their concept is too similar with their recent new group (tripleS +(KR)ystal Eyes). Having the 1/3 team there with the new tripleS group will invite comparisons and both their dreamy/refreshing/retro concepts will be conflict with each other. The 1/3 team can grow at CTD and revolve their sound to be more mature and sophisticated (like recent Oh My Girl?) As to how the LOONA full team will reform, its still a mystery.",

I don\u2019t think that 1/3 having overlapping concepts with Krystal Eyes is a problem because Krystal Eyes is not going to release any more music, TripleS units aren\u2019t permanent. I do think that there\u2019s more going on behind the scenes that we will never know about, considering how TripleS Krystal Eyes have been blacklisted from music shows we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to play out for the rest of Modhaus artists and from HyunVi\u2019s POV it might be risky to join a company that\u2019s being blacklisted. \n\nAlso, BBC sued Chuu\u2019s first company and tried to make it so that it wouldn\u2019t accept any more of the members, we don\u2019t know if they did the same with Modhaus.\n\nReally all we can do is hope for the best. I just want the girls to be happy, no matter which path they choose. I think we should all stop hoping for a Loona reunion though, having OEC+ together seems like the best we\u2019re gonna get in that sense.",

I saw them promoting recently on After School club and on an online show (Pocket TV) on Youtube so hopefully they can still promote elsewhere.\n\nYou're right, there's many things happening behind the scenes. The lawsuits are just delaying their time to have a fresh start and god knows what BBC is doing besides sabotaging other people's careers. And there is their rookie trainees Bebez? Poor Yeyoung.. As long as the girls are free and happy and doing their own thing, that's enough to wish for as a fan.",

It\u2019s crazy she went on at all. \n\nTheir schedules have been so packed, like 50+ shows must be exhausting in itself and then to be constantly flying across the globe for solo and group schedules? They said their last tour was really hard on their mental and physical health, and this tour has been so much bigger and busier. I hope they have a good team of professionals there to help them stay strong, hydrated and healthy.",

I know it seems like such a small 'issue' to let get in the way of your dreams but I could not enjoy being a singer or dancer if 90% of the time, it was under the condition that you're so tired and run down, and ill quite often. And as soon as your better, your schedule is just as packed and you have to go and face it all again",

Because sometimes in behind the scenes content, idols are literally shaking and almost hyperventilating after a performance, from how hard they just worked. I feel like there's no way some of them don't heave from that let alone vomit.\n\nI know there's many videos of idols fainting on stage. Also a video of TWICE Dahyun before a concert where she is literally grey, about to be ill, and EXO Chanyeol throwing up by the stage. Props to them for powering through",

A lot of tours will have most shows show every day or every other day within the same leg, &amp; then a month or 2 between legs. As far as maintaining your physical health that\u2019s a lot better than having a show every 4-5 days but being practically continuous.\n\nIdk the stats for those artists you mentioned but Ik there have been some other kpop groups that have also been on tour for a while, either the same one or multiple tours back to back. But they do the 1st approach so it seems to be working for them fine in terms of physical health",

(don't shoot me if I missed something)\n\nBP biggest breaks were 10 days in October, 15 days around Christmas/New Years, the month of February, most of April, and around 50 days upcoming with just one date in the middle of that break.\n\nDua Lipa's biggest breaks were 15 days in April, most of July, just two dates in August, and October.\n\nHarry Styles had a break from November 2021 to June 2022 (he released a new album in May 2022), 20 days around Christmas/New Years, and the month of April. From August to November he did 39 dates at 4 venues in the US.\n\nDaddy Yankee did not appear to take any significant break (5+ days).\n\nTaylor Swift will be taking September and October off before she does the last 6 stops of the tour. The other 55 dates did not appear to take any significant breaks (5+ days). Her tour appears to be two/three dates in the same venue back-to-back on weekends, then going to another venue the next weekend, rinse and repeat.\n\nColdplay took most of April, half of June, 15 days July/August, 15 days August/September, most of October, break from November to March, April and most of May, 15 days in June, August, and October. A lot of their later leg dates were 2-5 dates at one venue.",

Why not schedule in breaks that help keep your talent healthy and avoiding burnout so they can perform the entire time?\n\nMaybe it wouldn't have changed anything but would it have really killed YG when they were planning the tour to add breaks and not fill them with other gigs but instead make them R&amp;R only? A week break in Australia after landing before their first performance there would seem smart, especially considering how personal the location is to two members.\n\nedit: \n\nReading a comment that in detailing how busy they are mentioned 'The Idol' and it really got me thinking, how much are fans (specifically BP stans) taking away the members agency by just assuming they are slaves with no say to what YG/TBL puts in their schedule. Do you think Jennie was forced to do 'The Idol'? Was it not her decision to get into acting, take that gig, and she knew she'd be adding all that extra work during her world tour of promoting the show? Same thing with Cannes. Those are things it seems highly likely Jennie chose for herself. \n\nI just think people don't realize how hard these artists push themselves. They are A-type personalities who are workaholics with dreams of building an empire and so they fill their own schedule and are deathly afraid of taking time off, missing opportunities and losing ground in the \"rat race\" they are running. \n\nThe only thing we hear for sure which is true is that most idols do ask, even in content in front of their public, for vacations. Even young groups like LE SSERAFIM, IVE and others have said since debut they haven't had an actual vacation or a single break (and things like that) and that's depressing and asking for trouble. I am all in favor of giving the talent R&amp;R breaks. I just don't assume, especially with the top groups (BP, TWICE, BTS, etc) that they have no voice and power to prevent their schedules from getting insanely packed. If BP is about to or already has signed their next contract, they should be at their most powerful in terms of their voices carrying weight. BP prints money and so the talent should be able to negotiate quite the pro-artist terms for themselves. \"No extended world tours without R&amp;R breaks of 3 days or more every \\_\\_\\_ amount of cities\" or something like that.",

Suga even said that they knew their company was right but it was still hard. \n\nSomething in the industry needs to change, being overworked to maintain a certain image and status shouldn\u2019t be the standard. With a group like BP, I think they are well ok as they are if they took a little break in between schedules. Reading about how much they flew in between their concerts for solo schedules is insane. No wonder Jennie couldn\u2019t take it. Of course it\u2019s going to catch up to her body, this is sad.

People always say \"but how do we know the artists didn't CHOOSE to do this much work\" and, firstly I'm sorry to say but you have to look at the history of how kpop companies treat their talent and think how likely it is they are given any kind of chocie at all. But even if the company does say \"are you sure you want to perform\", if they are part of a system where working yourself to the point of illness is not only the norm but also expected as a way to show you are grateful for your success, how can they really make a choice to say they want to not go to an event or sit out a show? And it's not just coming from the companies - every time an idol does perform sick or injured, they always get praised by the fans (both Korean and international) saying \"they went on stage even though they weren't well, they care about their fanbase so much!\" In that environment, even if the company isn't actively pressuring them, there is still a ton of background pressure to go on stage. \n\nAlso almost all these artists are in their teens or early 20s. I think the companies have a responsibility at some point to tell them to take a break even if they don't want to. That's part of responsible management.",

BP just made $200m+ on one world tour. If anything the industry probably has instilled fear in the idols and made it so even the most powerful with the most leverage don't know how much leverage they really have. Just like how the SM idols didn't know they could request to see their data and the company refused, even though it's their contractual right. \n\nNo company operating in its right mind, beholden to investors/shareholders, is throwing away a TWICE or BP type earner (tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars) because they started to demand vacations, less work, a more artist friendly schedule/tour or the like. Especially if the demands are part of negotiating for a new contract. We aren't talking some mid level group who makes decent money, and it's not like BabyMonster or ITZY are/will perform so strongly that it's easy to just throw away tens to hundreds of millions of dollars (TWICE, BP). MAYBE if JYPE's NMIXX was New jeans and TWICE in contract negotiations was being super hardcore, they'd say screw it and just not re-sign them. But even then is it worth damaging your brand (TWICE are iconic and like JYP's daughters, his biggest legacy)? It's not like TWICE with hardcore artist friendly contracts would not still be bringing in a nice profit. \n\nSo I just don't really buy it. Sure, some companies have gone full insane. Some companies have made wild decisions and blown up groups where they were hot and making money. But the industry exists in a different era now. It's global which means more shareholders/investors than ever, including multi billion dollar powerhouse companies and all with eyes of going global as music labels. Like HYBE wanting to compete with the big 4 globally. Can't be acting like amateurs throwing away big investments that are printing money.",

TWICE is working a ton it seems, non stop and now with solo and sub-unit debuts, but it's not like JYPE has only got TWICE so they need them to be active like this in order to stay afloat. JYPE already debuted their junior group (ITZY), and then another new group (NMIXX). Yet those didn't take any work off of TWICE's plate. \n\nI think it's likely just as simple as \"here's their earning potential if we packed their schedules\" and the higher ups say \"good, we want maximum profit. Do it.\" and that's that. \n\nMy questions, obviously the artists want real breaks. But beyond the occasional real break, and this again goes to my \"edit\" point, how many artists would take more breaks beyond that? Those artists seem to be the types who want to maximize their own profit, growth, fame, success and to do so in their 20's (investing in their future at the expense of said 20's). If companies told their artists \"okay you get next month off, but here's what we would have scheduled, how much it would have made ($), your cut, and the potential for one of your appearances to go viral and make you more famous\", how many of those artists would say \"yeah, okay, so I'm still gonna take that month off\"? How many artists are being FORCED to shoot ads, to be brand ambassadors, to fly to Paris to watch fashion shows and so on? Stans bash the companies and say they are overworking by having them do that stuff sometimes but maybe the artists want to do those things? Even when it fills their already packed schedule? Idk.",

At last night's concert, some of the more dance-intensive songs had different choreography or were performed sitting down. Don't get me wrong, it was still tons of dancing and super quick costume changes, but it felt like they were maybe giving them a slight break overall",

Even if all 4 members re-sign it will almost definitely be terms that are more in their favor than when they first signed their contracts- now that they have way more influence and power in the industry. They\u2019ll get more of the profits of their future activities I can almost guarantee it- even though YG already has decent profit split for tours already. \n\nWith that being considered I wonder if YG is really weighing the pros and cons correctly with the length of this tour. Especially since they\u2019re kinda dependent on BP for money until Baby Monsters debut- and that debut is going to be expensive as hell to finance. And especially considering Bigbang is really looking done for the time being and their shareholders did not seem pleased by that. \n\nJennie has always been a bit fragile health-wise. They\u2019re lucky no one has suffered any sort of major injury. Imo it would be best to call it soon and let them go home and rest. But that\u2019s just an outsider perspective on the matter. Yes I know other artists have toured longer but considering Kpop performances require more energy and Jennies health\u2026. It\u2019s a lot to put on them. \n\nFrom videos I\u2019ve seen they seem to be having fun still but idk if I was YG I\u2019d be more concerned about the health risks of such a prolonged tour. This is looking more and more like overwork before contracts are up. Just my two-cents.",

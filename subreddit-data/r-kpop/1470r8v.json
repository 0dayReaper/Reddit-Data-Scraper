In July 2020 the company announced their disbandment due to worsening economical situation caused by the pandemic. \n\n\nJaehan went on to debut with Omega X, Seunghyun and Eunjun debuted with AIMERS meanwhile Jong Chan is an actor. \n\n\n\nThey recently reunited on the wedding of Donggyu's big sister. Jaehan couldn't attend due to his schedule,but they edited him in. All the members follow each other on Instagram.\n\n\n\n They also had a reunion last year but Jong Chan wasn't present due to his big sister getting married and Jaehan couldn't attend due to schedule.",

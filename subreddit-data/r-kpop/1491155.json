            "comment": "Her debut? Has Dara really never released a solo before this? It feels surreal, especially considering how much music the rest of 2NE1 have put out during their solo ventures. I get that she's been booked and busy with acting gigs, hosting shows, shooting for commercials etc but it never crossed my mind that she hasn't released a solo song in the past, what, 15 years she's been active as an idol.\n\nIn CL's words, it's been a long time comin' but we here now! I can't wait to hear what her solo debut is going to be like!",

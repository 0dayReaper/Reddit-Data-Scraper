Visuals, dance, vocals- Miss Jiwon has it all. \n\nCherry Bullet is a group I\u2019ve long adored and mourned the crazy talent they have that FNC has been totally unable to showcase. Jiwon absolutely devoured this stage and the concept matches her so well. \n\nI can only hope and pray she and the other Cherry Bullet girls make the final lineup because lord knows any hype they generate from being on will be immediately squandered by FNC- as they have done it again and again and AGAIN.",

What passed on December 1 was dubbed the \"[Government Employees Goo Hara Act](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20201201109100001?input=1195m)\" (\uacf5\ubb34\uc6d0 \uad6c\ud558\ub77c\ubc95) by the media. Even the original post (the livejournal link) shows tweets that clearly say \"survivor's pensions.\"\n\nHer brother tried to change the inheritance laws earlier this year in the previous session of the legislature. The legislative session ended, and that bill died. This new bill that passed a few days ago does not change the inheritance laws.",

Problem is, her mum abandoned the family when her and her brother were kids; the brother argued that his mum didn\u2019t deserve half the estate because she was not a mother to them. This went to court, and the courts ruled that this sort of thing won\u2019t happen in the future. However, there are some quid pro quo\u2019s right now: the ruling won\u2019t apply to Hara\u2019s case because the law was passed after her death, and as of right now this law only applies to families of government employees",

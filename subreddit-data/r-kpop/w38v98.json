It really tarnished BTS' reputation in Korea to the point that it has become normal for the comment section of any article or news clip about them to be full of demands that they enlist asap and comparing them to Steve Yoo. The other situation lost them **$1.7B (!!!!)**, both of these outcomes were predictable and should've been handled better. Kfans have complained about incompetency and saying they're still moving like a small company for a while now. \n\nI've seen a take from an industry insider who said that considering the CEO of HYBE comes from the gaming industry, they run things more like a game/IT company rather than a music/entertainment agency. That HYBE, unlike its subsidiaries (BH, Pledis, Source, KOZ etc.) is *not* a music/entertainment company, and should be compared to other IT corporations like Naver and Kakao with their music/entertainment subsidiaries rather than to SM, JYP or YG. I think there's some truth to it, the way I see it, HYBE is mostly concerned with expanding platforms like Weverse, developing games, collaborating with Webtoon etc. and pretty much leaving the music/entertainment side to the individual subsidiaries, *who are still running things like small/medium sized companies*.",

No way would she have been welcomed back with loving open arms with the public and a subset of the fandom. She would be continuously hated on for the rest of her career if she stayed with the group. Which would be no good for her mental health especially since she's only 16.\n\nAnd her presence in the group would most likely have a negative effect on the group itself and the members. Source Music/Hybe completely messed up on how they managed and responded to this whole issue. It ultimately ended up backfiring on them and they look like a fool, was she really worth all of this mess. Garam shouldn't have debuted in the first place, they could have pulled her out before LE SSERAFIM officially made their debut. There was still plenty of time, no doubt the company were arrogant and overconfident that they would be able to ride out this controversy. Yeah, I get that they also wanted to avoid losing money from all of their investment that they put on her but look at where this all led to. A mess.\n\nEdit: Punctuation.",

            "comment": "Wow.. I thought they were going to wait for almost a year and then announce her comeback after things died down with the typical 'We apologize for such a controversy and \\[insert name\\] has taken the time off to reflect for their past actions and has focused on becoming a better person during her hiatus and will show her new colors to her fans moving on forwards\" and the person in question would then write a handwritten letter of apology and then go on to post an ambiguous picture of a cloudy sky and say something along the lines of \"Better days are coming/Changing for the good.\"\n\nBut nope, she's actually out... Seeing that her contract got terminated so late after the controversy, it must mean they discussed about her being in the group for a long long time, and the defamation case must've come to a conclusion privately.\n\nI've got to say, I feel really bad for the victim, and if she was hurt maliciously by Garam, I hope she finds comfort now, but I also feel slightly bad for Garam, because fact of the matter is, we'll never really know who was more or truly at fault revolving this entire mess of a situation; whether Garam was truly the main antagonist of that past incident or a flawed anti-hero who tried to step up for her friend (who was allegedly harassed by the alleged victim), whatever the facts are, we literally don't know it; yet people demonized a 16 year old, and ironically bullied the accused bully despite knowing she's a minor.\n\nAll I'll say is, since we don't know what the facts are, we really should just wish the best of luck to the group moving forward, and to both Garam and the alleged victim. Whatever sins they may have committed, I think it is a very wrong conception that their wrongdoings are unforgivable; please focus on them becoming better people from now on instead of focusing on their downfall.\n\nAll hate does is make people in the center of controversies become more volatile, broken or vengeful out of frustration. Like bro, look at Mina from AOA for example, her downfall from being the poster girl of celebrity victims, initially crowned for speaking up against her leader Jimin's alleged bullying, to end up becoming a manipulative, clout-chasing unstable figure of notoriety holding the internet captive with suicidal threats is batshit crazy and almost unbelievable. And now, Jimin, everyone's most hated local Korean celebrity, has gained back public sympathy after Mina essentially ruined her own image by coming off as crazy, is coming back in the entertainment industry, despite having confessed to some degree of mistreatment/bullying.\n\nI hope Garam doesn't end up becoming Mina 2.0. When online, people really don't spare anyone; even if it's an immature 16 year old who hasn't lived 20% of her life yet.",

We don't know the full story of Garam and we probably won't ever know. However it was such a dangerous angle to state to the world that Garam was somehow completely innocent because then you have to have definitive proof that the allegations were 100% false. Even then with false allegations, she'd still have to take a \"reflective break\" before returning. Honestly, this feels so similar to how badly Cube Ent handled Soojin's accusations. I'd argue that fans mostly don't like the idea of their concerns being bulldozed by these companies which is why they'll double down on wanting certain resolutions (like kicking a member out). Also, I think the majority of the fault lies with the fact that a lot of these companies aren't doing great in their written response to bullying accusations and often fan the fires of fans' anger towards the alleged idol bully. Hopefully with this dying down there can be some healing for all parties involved.",

A lot of the dresses in Kpop just feel like they're meant to convey a really unrealistic shape/silhouette.

I don't think that's weird, it's a dance-ready piece that lets her look like she's wearing a skirt with the mobility of wearing shorts, I ever wore similar things for dance or sports as a child.

Imo, she could've been dressed prettier, with better make up as well. \n\nLike this [pic of here as example](https://www.dailysia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Yeji_itzy_2.jpg), imo is far prettier than her stage appearance. [This is another pic](http://az879543.vo.msecnd.net/itzy/2.jpg) that make me thinking why is she the only one who look different than the others? ",

My main point was that they absolutely should not be placed on children. Which you might agree with it but I can't really tell!",

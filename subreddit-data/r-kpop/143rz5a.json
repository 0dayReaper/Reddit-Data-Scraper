And I don't think releasing multiple MVs necessarily means that an album has multiple title tracks. For example, Le Sserafim released an MV for Eve, Psyche &amp; The Bluebeard's wife, but the only title track on the album is [Unforgiven](https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=11234678). It just depends on what the artist/company chooses to designate as a title track. Ive did have more than one title track for their album, but I don't think that is the norm (which is why I asked for examples of albums with all title tracks, but I guess I'm not going to get a response).",

Why?  \nBecause aespa's spicy was 3rd on the daily chart while not being on the karaoke at all, that seems impossible if it really played a role.  \n  \nNow why this lines up so well, who knows. But calling it blatant manipulation is conspiracy talk.",

They also mentioned their Karaoke chart has no connection with their main chart which was where Queencard was #2 for forever. Lo and behold, the next day, QC conveniently moved up to #1 on their chart and now I-DLE are finally able to officially receive a PAK.\n\nCoincidence, or something more? lol",

It\u2019s still a pretty nice thing to achieve but when Kpop fans treat it as one of the most important thing ever or compare songs which is more successful, that definitely makes it becoming overrated.\n\nI always love using this example when people say PAK is the thing to identify which song is more successful: \nQ: Which only one Red Velvet song has ever achieved PAK in their entire discography? (also don\u2019t search and try to answer). You can even give them 5 attempts to guess.\n\nAns: &gt;!Power up!&lt;\n\nI can bet that 95% probably guess it wrong even after 5 tries. And that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s useless to gauge a popularity of the song when that song probably isn\u2019t even in Top 5 for RV most popular song.\n\nAlso, SOTY2022 is another nice example but I think it\u2019s too early to use that as an example as people can be pretty sensitive.",

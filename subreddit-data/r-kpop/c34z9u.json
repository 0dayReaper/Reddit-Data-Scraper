I just want to voice my gratitude before asking questions, as your guys\u2019 music have helped me through so many rough patches in my life throughout these years. Thank you for creating such amazing music and being such genuine people.  Anyways, on to the questions.\n\n1) I\u2019ve always been wondering about the Creative process for composing/writing songs? Do you guys jot down things that inspire you throughout the day or is it more spontaneous? \n\n2) You guys finished up with your world tour in January, What was the major difference between performing in Korea and outside of Korea? \n\n3) For Jae, What inspired you to go for a music career in Korea, especially coming from LA? Did you ever question your decision and believe that this was the right path for you and almost gave up? If you have, how did you pick yourself up to keep going even with the major cultural differences?",

Your music and who you are as people have formed some of my happiest moments in life and carried us through some of the darkest times in our lives. I owe a lot of my personal growth to this band, for the music you put out and the inspirational things you all have said that I've taken to heart. Thank you endlessly for all that you guys have done and will do. \n\nI guess I should ask a question now too! What advice do you have for someone who wants to learn an instrument but has little to no musical background? Or if you can\u2019t think of anything, what\u2019s your favorite SHINee song? \n\nThank you and I hope you guys come to Houston soon!\n\nP.S. Do you guys think you will ever release studio versions of songs like You and Eyeless? I haven\u2019t had the chance to see you guys live so I\u2019ve been living off of other\u2019s recordings, which are great but I\u2019m curious!",

Could you talk about that process? Do you focus on one song or try to connect each throughout the album like a story?   \nSecondly, one thing I think makes Day6 stand out from other bands is your musicianship and your collaboration on stage. What exercises do you practice to strengthen that, or what qualities in each other help foster that environment? \n\nTHANK YOU!! Come visit us back in the eastern United States!! &lt;3",

You can skip the intro and proceed to the questions. :-P\n\nI have prepared my message since last night because when the q&amp;a will start i will be too sleepy to manage to even make a proper sentence.\n\nI follow you since your debut. I have always admired how unique your music is in the kpop industry and how much passion you put into what you are doing. \n\nI have finally traveled to see you from Cyprus (country where I am from and live) to Amsterdam this January for your first European concert. My boyfriend bought me as a present a vvip ticket and I can say with certainty that that was the best experience of my life. I was so happy that i got to see all of you but to be honest Young K and Jae are my favourite ones. Maybe Young K slightly more because who can resist this smile and the way he looks at you?\n\nYou can remember how amazing you were that night in the post i made after the concert: https://www.instagram.com/p/BtQZ3BUlzk7/?igshid=bfry4ciyjkdq\n\nA couple of weeks after the concert i found out I won a signed t-shirt from you: https://www.instagram.com/p/By7ZB9PHCOX/?igshid=1hoi8w07uctx\n\nOkay that\u2019s the end of my appreciation letter.\n\nTime for some questions... \n- When did you really started to like each other and maintain a good team spirit? Did you like each other when you first met?\n- Do you think you will ever have to do a big change on your music style so that people will stay interested in you? And if yes are you willing to do this change if your company says so, or you want to stick to your style? (I wish you will stick to that, but tbh anything you try I am sure it will turn out good)\n- The lyrics of your songs did they ever come from a personal experience any of you had?\n- Do you enjoy going to Arirang Radio? I have listened to your interviews all the times you visited Sam. I hope you will go again after your next comeback\n- What are some songs each of you are currently in?\n- What is the weirdest thing each of you  ever did?\nBonus questions:\n- Is really day6 going to answer back to these questions or some manager of them?\n- How can Young K\u2019s look be so sexy? \n\nAnything you answer back in this comment I will be glad. \n\nP.S 1 We want moreeee JaeSix Jay. \nP.S 2 After hearing all of these bad things about the music entertainment industry in Korea, I just hope they treat you well, you are happy, healthy and that they don\u2019t pressure you to do better, because you are already doing amazing.\nP.S 3 And btw sorry for not writing anything in Korean so that everyone in the group will understand, but my Korean writing level goes up to \uc548\ub155",

My favorite songs currently are probably 'I Smile' and 'I like you'. I love the sounds of those songs, and the lyrics are so emotional. I honestly resonate with both in my own way. I also love 'All Alone' and 'Letting Go'. They're really sad, honestly. It brings me to the verge of tears at points.\n\nI have so many questions I could ask right now!! Sorry if I'm asking too many at once!\n\nWhat inspires your lyrics and music? I notice that a lot of your lyrics are about a sort of sad love, like break-up songs, post break up songs, etc. Is there a reason for that?\n\nI guess this question is geared towards Young K. Is there anything you would recommend if I want to learn bass? I haven't bought one yet, but I would really love to. This seems really random, but how are you guys? Are y'all doing well and happy with yourselves right now?\n\nIs there any music software you would recommend for a beginning composer? I wanna start in the music industry but don't know what options I should use to start. Hey, do you plan to come to Texas anytime soon?... Maybe...?\n\nLastly (for now), can we expect another awesome comeback soon? I can't wait for the next one!!\n\nIf you actually see this, thank you for everything!! Your music is awesome, and I love all of you so much.",

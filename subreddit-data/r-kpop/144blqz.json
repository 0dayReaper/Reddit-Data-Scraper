Not sure if Infinite Company is actually a company or otherwise for now, but it's great to see them still going. Happy 13 years, that's an incredible milestone, even with all the hiatuses that have happened / Hoya leaving / Woollim somehow making things so that no one's left under them anymore. \n\nInfinite's discography so far has been impeccable, with some of the best songs I've ever heard. I really hope we get more ~~with Sweetune~~ in the coming years too!",

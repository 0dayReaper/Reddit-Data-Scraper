By just female side alone we have Queendom Puzzle, R U Next? and this one.\n\nI know everyone just want to debut and achieve their dreams but did a non-mnet, non-big 4 survival show really turn out well? Fantasy Boys ended yesterday and hardly any buzz. Peak Time was kinda come and gone. It seems that channel like MBC and JTBC try so many times but it just not work that well. We shall see from how SBS will handle it.",

That\u2019s on the companies who gonna manage said groups.\n\nThe Fantasy Boys group is going to be handled by MBK/Pocketdol. A group with any buzz at all, even if small, is still a win for them since their current groups are going nowhere. The show had some traction in Japan and theres 2 Japanese members in the group so at the very least they\u2019ll be able to milk them there.",

Idols tend to be good looking or trendy or have confident personalities. 80% of the kids that fall under those categories in elementary school and middle school are bullies(to varying degrees). It's the unfortunate truth of bullying in Korea and it's why I really don't have the same kind of reverence to the idols like many kpop fans do. I just like the songs.",

Being nice opens you up to attacks and either you\u2019re the one actively participating or being passive and letting it happen or your the one being bullied. Lia from ITZY was said to be really nice to everyone but because of that she opened herself up to being a target. In Korea they have almost a caste system in school. If you\u2019re nice to the \u201cuntouchables\u201d then suddenly you too are now an \u201cuntouchable\u201d. So either you ignored the kids being bullied or risk becoming bullied too. Those are the only 2 \u201cgood\u201d options. Its why there are so many that end up school hopping.",

You go to a dog park and you see dozens of dogs. Mostly assorted breeds, but all offshoots of the same creature. They're more than likely gonna wanna play with each other, and they won't care what the other dogs look like. We're the same. Different offshoots of the same creature. How hard is that to comprehend for these people? Why can't we all just play together like the dogs do? There's a reason why they say dogs are the best people. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",

Yes, you need to do something when the kid is doing it, but not 10+ years later, after that person has clearly admitted they were horrible and didn't try to make an excuse. I mean, ok, it's obviously not something you're supposed to forgive just like that, but come on, condemning her forever when she's shown she's changed, and saying \"she's a horrible human being\" is simply wrong. Yes, inform people about what she did. Say \"she was a horrible person as a kid, she did this and that\". But don't pretend like people don't change.  \n\n\nI believe in second chances, especially when the person has shown they understand what they did. I also hate it when people forget that 90% of bullies are bullies because of some kind of serious problem, usually in home. They often are humans too that deal with their own bullies. I'm not saying they're saints or they should be instantly forgiven, or that their victims didn't suffer greatly. I'm saying that some people are acting like they should die and that's very wrong.",

Yes, bullying is heinous and wrong but to continue punishing someone for being a bully when they've apologized and makes no excuses for their behavior is hardly any better. If you don't allow people the ability to grow and become better people, you shove them back into a mindset where they have to fight and bully their way through life.",

In those released conversations, Hein again apologizes several times, but also contradicts that she was a bystander by stating \"I know I made that choice, so I know it was wrong. I know I shouldn\u2019t have, but I was scared, and I did it out of fear. I shouldn\u2019t have hit you, this is definitely something that can\u2019t be rationalized,\" indicating she did hit her after all.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to drag this girl's name through the mud, but it's just mixed feelings seeing her getting a bunch of praise for coming out (not that that's not deserved) when I originally knew her from around the time of Idol School and I didn't exactly have the most positive opinion about her after reading that article when it came out.",

She basically said that fans shipping her with fellow members and pushing her to come out before she was ready really traumatized her as a teenager and made her entire self discovery/coming out process much tougher than it ever needed to be.\n\nComing to terms with being different is already hard as it is, especially in a conservative society/environment. I can\u2019t imagine having thousands of eyes watching and scrutinizing every single move you make on top of that, all while trying to pick apart your behavior so they can stick a label on you.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inherently bad about being curious of a celebrities sexuality. We make judgements all the fucking time, whether we want to admit it or not. Even the doofuses on this sub who claim to be completely neutral and objective will still unintentionally assume sexuality (usually heterosexuality).\n\nBut there is a difference between picking up on some hints, piecing them together in your head and sharing those thoughts with friends in private conversation, vs making long essays, video analyses, twitter threads and blog posts about how [x idol] is *DEFINITELY 200% FLAMING GAY and also fucking their band member!1!!*",

One thing that bothers me is there's a member of a popular group (won't mention any names cuz it seems to be against the sub rules so just in case) who's pretty much the resident Gay of the group according to lots of fans and it's just so.... strange? I've only recently begun learning the names of this group's members but for long I knew he was the \"confident gay\" one (wtf???) and as a non-fan at the time it felt so weird that *y'all made that his defining personality trait* to an outsider. Whether he's gay or not, seeing all those serious compilations and fan theories (and I'm sure he's seen em) and such can't be healthy for someone who's at the age where they could very well still be figuring all that out for themself, for fuck's sake! I hope all that stuff doesn't get to him too much and he's able to have a healthy relationship with his sexuality whatever it is, but this one specific case (I don't know if I've made it obvious which idol I'm talking about or if other people have noticed the same thing) is just kind of gross to me. At the end of the day, it should be his business only until he chooses otherwise, and being an idol shouldn't take that right away.",

I was bullied. Insults, teasing, violence became a daily part of my life for many years. It left scars that's taken me many many years to come to terms with. Had I seen one of my bullies on TV when I was 20, seeming like the nicest guy in the world. It would have opened up those wounds again. I'd have gotten flashbacks.\n\nBut I also believe that people can change. I did stupid shit I regret as a teenager. I think most of us have, or will do. And Som Hein going against her agency's wishes to attempt to apologise to her victim seems genuine. Had one of my bullies came to me today with an apology like hers, I'd accept it. But that's now, in my late 30s. Had in been just a few years removed from the events, I'd probably react like the victim did.",

It's not about her past actions (thought that is a big part), it's about how she doesn't seem at all repentant when she's not forced to be by public opinion. There are no signs she has actually changed. Her apologies that came before the backlash were said to come because she was going to debut as a model soon and so she tried to clear things up. But then after she apologizes in private, she claims in public that she isn't the perpetrator of the assaults (it's assault, not just bullying that she did) and merely a bystander. She is clearly unrepentant and the victim was able to bring out receipts that she wasn't.",

Again, if she was truly remorseful, she would have taken full responsibility for her actions, not hiding in some private conversation with her victim. Even after her private \"apology\" to the victim, she even seems to threaten the victim by saying if the victim doesn't pull down her FB post calling out Hein, \"you\u2019ll \\[the victim\\] suffer more later.\" Does that sound like a bully and abuser that has repented?",

How is JYP slowing down the only group in their company passing 500k albums, it\u2019s not adding up. And they don\u2019t even have enough active groups to even make what twice can. This isn\u2019t SM where there\u2019s multiple active groups that can pick up the weight with promotion. It\u2019s legit twice for physicals and digitals, though itzy are picking up.",

They sound like Korea but lately they\u2019ve been mixing in different concepts with each release which is nice. But I think most of their tracks still sound distinctly Korean. Though I will say that Eyes Wide Open has such a nice balance of Korean, electronic, retro, and R&amp;B flavors and I think it really flexes their musical muscles.",

I love the darker tone, this is the biggest departure from their former style yet. Fancy was a bit of a change but it still had a bit of cute chirpiness. This is sexy and mature. with an ominous and menacing edge to it. SO GOOD! The vocalizations, the driving beat, this is synthwave perfection. This is their best song since What Is Love and an immediate addition to the amazing 80s inspired K-pop songs list. I was already excited for this but they absolutely nailed it.",

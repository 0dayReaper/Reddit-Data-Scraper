I've been waiting for Twice to do some darker, more mature rnb for a single and this fits the bill. \n\nI was expecting the chorus bit to be a post-chorus with something ahead of it, but it still works. It's definitely stuck in my head, although Idk if anyone was really ready for them to sing \"baby let's do it all night\" lol. \n\nOnly real complaint is that the MV is another box. Like damn, we really got another box MV for a song called Moonlight Sunrise. Div3, put them on a roof somewhere on location for some cool late night or morning shots! Girls looked amazing but the outfits didn't standout to me on the first viewing.\n\nEdit: how am I not gonna mention Chaeyoung's rap verse like I knew we were getting something special but that was on another level. Chae's gonna get an honorary citizenship soon enough with all these iconic English raps. \n\nI'm glad they released this in the winter, it definitely fits the vibe.",

Oh boy, I had to rewind and turn on the subtitles to make sure I misheard that. Listen to it sung and the shadow canon imagery at 1:57 and tell me it's not all intentional. \n\nI enjoyed this. I need to listen to just the audio a few times to figure out just how much though. It didn't immediately blow me away but it might be a grower.\n\nMomo wins this M/V. Just INSANELY gorgeous and in that brown-leather top with her long jet black hair... and to start off the M/V, smart move director.\n\nThe lyrical story is craving their \"love\", I don't mean to rush but I need your touch if I'm gonna make it through the night (as Nayeon is on her bed), I've got the moonlight-tequila sunrise come take a shot of me, it's I need you oclock right now, you can hit up my line when you need it, got a craving baby can you feed it? baby let's do it all night...\n\nI wonder, is this the most overtly sexual Twice song? I mean, boil it down and it's basically either a booty call or a \"I need you in my bed tonight babe\" to their romantic partner lyrical story. Then when the slow part of the song hits they switch to what is essentially the most lingerie clothing can be worn by a JYPE girl group in a music video (2:25). Sana laying on the couch and Momo with white sheets that evoke some girl playing in bed sheet imagery.\n\nI've got NO problem with it, but I wonder if because I always listen to their songs in KOR and rarely read or pay much attention to the lyrics, is this by far the most overtly sexual or is this not really anything new?",

Has a kind of Ariana Grande sound,  but the voices are refreshing and they bring something new to it. Maybe this is my massive crush on Momo coming through, but these fits are really something else. A high boot, little mesh, little netting, fuzzy hat. It hasn't beat Fancy (so far, no GG song is more played than that one, though Ditto is coming close LOL), but it's up there. I loved it!",

The vocals are just wow. The visuals are insane. This going to be on repeat for the foreseeable future. Their English singles go hard man.",

Its so good that I can't think of words to describe it.   \n\nIf the pre-release is THIS good then I wonder how good the whole album would be. Also Chaeyoung? Holy moly I'm getting bias wrecked againn.\n\nEdit: And Sana, you definitely got me \ud83d\udc4c",

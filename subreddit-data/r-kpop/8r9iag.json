Teddy moved between vocals quickly and abruptly on purpose to create a very western hardstyle-ish piece. The idea is to make each piece overly distinct and contained, while still building to the drop. Take what is regarded as an EDM masterclass like [Know No Better](https://youtu.be/DumuyU6SuaQ), which uses this same model. This type of style is designed to highlight each individual and not as much the group. The cuts and transitions are meant to be this \"underdone\".",

Its *very* bass heavy (real sub bass too, not *just* fluttered upper bass), and has just one truly \"pop\" sections. Sounds like a song made by a DJ rather than a pop group. Its the middle of the night so I can't blast this on my speaker system yet but I feel like a sub will definitely improve enjoyment of this song.",

Jennie's verse is fire and I do like the pre chorus but going for the full hip hop/trap sound means the whole song and especially the chorus feels flat. There's always been a good dash of pop that has made BP's songs so great and I'm not getting that here.\n\nPWF remains my favourite from them and even AIIYL was catchy, but I've never been a fan of these empty choruses with a couple of hook lines thrown in. BBY worked because there was a lot of energy in the instrumental whereas this one feels like an empty space with a trap beat and one wonky synth. It's definitely more of a hype 'get down at a warehouse party' song than a song I'd enjoy listening to in my room for its musicality.\n\nThat said the MV is some expensive ass shi and I love it. The audacity of Jennie coming out on that studded tank, and the way they filmed my girl Ros\u00e9 like some sort of goddess and then ACTUALLY SWINGING on a chandelier, WTF this is opulent extravagant cash money brilliance.",

But I personally feel like YG doesn\u2019t know what to do with them which is why almost everything they do will get compared to 2ne1. They had the one girl group and so all YG knows how to do is to copy the same formula and apply it to BP. \n\nI don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s a reject song, I\u2019m sure it was made for them.

It is always like that. For me, at first listen on any of Teddy\u2019s songs, it is usually a 6/10 that eventually grows to 12/10 after more listens. It is the type that grows like crazy on you if you are into fast beat, upbeat stuff. Same thing happened to me in all of BP\u2019s past songs, especially AIIYL.",

It doesn\u2019t feel like BlackPink, it feels like something YG ent. just kind of pulled out of their file cabinet. There\u2019s not much oomf and BP is all about oomf, even the drop was kind of...outdated?\n\n I don\u2019t really give a shit though, because it\u2019s blackpink and I\u2019m just fucking happy they\u2019re still alive and breathing, I was about 85-90% sure YG would give them a kind of mediocre track like this for their next comeback but honestly I don\u2019t even care, I\u2019m just glad they got the ball rolling again.

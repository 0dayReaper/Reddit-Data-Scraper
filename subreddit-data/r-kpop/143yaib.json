Heard that the presale tickets were all wiped out within 25-30min, and today's general sale was even more brutal with everything being sold out within ten minutes (according to Twitter). Good to hear that they've decided to add a second show! All the best to those who will be buying tickets tomorrow.\n\nP.S. Good luck to whoever is in charge of maintaining those servers for Ticketmaster SG...it's gonna be absolutely chaotic tomorrow",

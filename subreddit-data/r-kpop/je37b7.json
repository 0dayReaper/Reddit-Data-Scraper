As someone who has been a fan of the group since debut, I couldn\u2019t possibly have imagined back then being where we are today. The diligent, earnest, and humble outlook they had at the very beginning still remains true today, five years on from 2015. The road hasn\u2019t been easy, and these past 2 years have been especially tough. My most fervent wish is for Twice\u2019s health and happiness going forward. Congratulations to TWICE, and many thanks from a steadfast once since debut!",

At that time, there were so many new groups and I really only stayed into K-Pop because of SNSD. I felt so bad for Tzuyu though, so I checked out Twice and the rest is history for me. \n\nFrom going to all their US stops on their Twicelights tour last year to always copping all their albums circa Signal era, I wouldn't change my current interest in this group or K-Pop at all. \n\nI can't wait to see what the future has in store for these girls.",

But one finds hope where one can.\n\nThe \"optimistic\" take is that many idols likely suffer from poor mental health given the industry's harsh standards and JYPE's policy of allowing idols to take emergency breaks is a good sign rather than a worrying one. As in more idols are going through similar situations in other companies and groups but aren't allowed/don't allow themselves to stay out of a comeback. I don't think that JYPE is that much worse (but also frankly that much better) for a work environment to explain it otherwise.",

I hope that she rehabs her body and her mind back to 100%.\n\nPersonally, what I find most amazing is that she can still be such a professional and participate in shooting all the Twice content coming out even during these times of COVID and still look like she\u2019s enjoying herself. Not to mention she\u2019s one of the main singers in Twice and she had to record a Japanese album AND their new album. It just blows my mind. \n\nBut like I said, even the strongest people have a limit to the amount of stress they can handle and it seems like Jeong Yeon has reached her limit.",

At the time, I didn't know a single thing about K-pop, but I was immediately captivated by the performances and variety of genres. But I was particularly interested in TWICE after their backstage interview (specifically when Tzuyu said \u201c\\[For our 1000th day anniversary\\] the members and I ate samgyeopsal deliciously\u201d and Nayeon said \u201cStanding still is the best way to stay cool \\[in the summer\\], BAAM\u201d idk it was really adorable and funny). Watching \u201cDance the Night Away\u201d in person was a blast (and it\u2019s still one of my favorite TWICE songs) and I was intrigued when they did their infamous ice-cube music win encore. If I remember correctly, I think it was Tzuyu\u2019s height, Momo\u2019s pigtails, and Chaeyoung\u2019s bright orange hair that prompted me to look them up on Google (and subsequently Kprofiles\u2014 bless that page). After that, I kind of fell into the K-pop rabbit hole. I discovered the masterpiece that is \u201cLikey\u201d and realized that the over-played BGM songs from my parents\u2019 favorite variety shows were actually a TWICE song (\u201cCheer Up,\u201d to be exact).\n\nI wouldn\u2019t consider myself a \u201cseasoned\u201d ONCE. I actually regret not becoming a ONCE sooner. But from another point of view, I think I\u2019m very lucky for becoming a ONCE when I did. My first comeback with TWICE was \u201cYes Or Yes,\u201d which marked a subtle transition between cute TWICE and mature (?) TWICE. Then I got to experience the heartfelt \u201cThe Best Thing I Ever Did\u201d and \u201cFancy,\u201d which was a surprising and radical shift in TWICE concepts.\n\nI also got to be a part of some of the most exciting times as a ONCE\u2014 the TWICE LIGHTS World Tour, for example. I also experienced some of the biggest heartbreaks in the ONCE fandom, like Mina and Jeongyeon\u2019s Hiatuses. But regardless, I\u2019m so happy to have seen TWICE grow from DTNA to MORE &amp; MORE. I am so proud of their successes and progress even in the short span of three years. TWICE will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will always be rooting for them. TWICE is the reason I was able to create friendships that I never would have expected to create and they are also why I was interested in becoming a translator in the first place (shout out to TWICE Global and Teudoongie Subs).\n\nThis is way too long but I wanted to let it all out somewhere. Thank you TWICE. \ud2b8\ub465\uc774 fighting!!",

When I first listened to their music, I never thought they'd become one my all-time favorite groups ever just a month later and their seemingly endless variety and social media content where they showcase their hilarious, adorable and wholesome personalities, always make my day. They've only entered my life earlier this year but quarantine makes it seem like it's been so much longer since I had the time to watch so much of the content they've put out over the years and listen to their discography and watch their MVs and performances in chronological order, which was almost like experiencing their natural growth and seamless transition from cutesy to mature as if I'd been a fan since Sixteen.\n\nBefore TWICE, I never even entertained the idea of spending way too much money on a lightstick, purchasing monographs, dusting my trading card binder from when I was a kid to put photocards in and actually buying CDs in 2020 - and now I have a whole shelf that is just full of their stuff lmao. There's just something special about them and the way they can brighten your day in a very sincere and sweet way, whether it's with their continuously brilliant musical output, their stunning photoshoots, their uncontrollable crackheadedness or even them just hanging out and literally doing nothing while camping lol\n\nThey deserve the world and I sincerely hope for their happiness, health and success because what makes them happy, makes me happy too. I couldn't be more excited for the upcoming comeback and I'm sending positive vibes to Jeongyeon, who's hopefully resting and recovering well and I'm certain she'll eventually return better and stronger than ever.",

            "comment": "I remember being only 15 years old when Sixteen aired and I followed the show religiously. This was soon after both Girls' Generation and Kara split and I felt empty. TWICE was able to give me a happiness that I was afraid I lost. I was in class when LOA dropped and had to secretly watch the music video and kept spazzing. My teacher thought something was wrong with me and I pretended I was sick just to go to the nurse office. I actually just walked around in school repeatedly watching the music video. I went to their concert last year and it was a life altering experience for me. Each time I watch TWICE variety I end up smiling and laughing like an idiot and saying \"This is why I stan them\". \n\n\nStanning them has been such an amazing yet rough journey. They are massively disliked even to this day. Their videos kept repeatedly breaking records for most disliked music videos. And this subreddit enjoyed making negative comments and talking crap on them, even to this day, and each of those comments recieved massive amounts of Karma. Being a Once is something I wouldn't trade away for the world. I am now 21 years old and I am still here. I can remember the days when I was 12 years old waiting for The Boys MV to drop. Time has flew by really fast. Even though the mistreatment and music has had me second guessing things, I am sure ICSTM will renergize me as a Once. Thank you TWICE for all the things you have done. And thank you fellow Onces for supporting our girls!",

They took the playbook laid out by SNSD and polished it to perfection while maintaining their own autonomy. When I look back at all of the content released by Twice, I\u2019m just blown away. This really is a top notch team, both on and off stage, and I\u2019m absolutely including the management in this sentiment. They\u2019ve handled Twice\u2019s meteoric success very well. (That Tzuyu hostage video is still NOT the move, but I digress.)\n\nI\u2019m really grateful to have discovered Twice and through them the world of kpop. The last two years were very rough for me mentally, but I could always count on a Twice video to put a smile on my face, as corny as that sounds. Here\u2019s to many more great years!\n\nEDIT: Downvotes, really? This is just a lighthearted post to celebrate Twice's career thus far. I guess I should just accept my role as a kpop elder statesmen and encourage you to \"grow up\" for the hundredth time.",

If you liked a certain MV, listen to its corresponding album.\n\nI would also check out their KR work first just because you can quickly figure out what type of Twice you like (old cute Twice or new more mature Twice) and that can help you choose which Japanese releases to get into.\n\nIf you do end up liking their music a lot and want to get into them more as a group, there's a great infographic on the Twice sub somewhere that goes into the variety shows and the watch order for some stuff. I think watching Sixteen gives a lot of insight into them but the newer youtube documentary does cover some of that, but very briefly. If you want to go into their content though, try to stick chronologically and spoilers from sixteen or other early variety shows will ruin the experience when they reference back to them.",

I first got into kpop through Girls' Generation, but it was TWICE that really cemented my love for kpop starting  with Like Ooh-Ahh, and I've always looked forward to every single song they put out. I didn't really dig into the individual members until later on, only really going down the rabbit hole after they announced their US tour. The personalities of all the members and the way they interacted with each other was incredibly fun to see, and I've always loved how honest they are. I feel like their personalities always shine through in everything they do, and I've enjoyed watching them grow over the years. Their struggles are always difficult to watch, and I'm amazed at how strong the girls are, dealing with all the challenges that comes their way and overcoming them with grace. They're quirky, dorky, beautiful, talented and they are an absolute joy to watch either on stage, in variety shows or on interviews. Watching them perform in concert was a dream come true, and seeing to the passion behind their performances that day, hearing their amazing vocals, listening to them talk about how much work went into their stages and how they felt about being able to perform so far from home among so many people was an experience I'll never forget. Even the fandom has been pretty great for the most part, and watching everyone turn their light sticks mint green for Mina, singing and cheering at the top of their lungs throughout the concert and supporting the girls when they were speaking, especially when Jeongyeon started tearing up,  really made me feel much closer to all of these random strangers.  \n\nTheir music and their smiles have brought light to my life in some dark moments, and I will forever be grateful to them for that.\n\n I always liked the way Jihyo explained the bond between an artist and their fans. We're not friends or family, we don't really know each other and we'll most likely never meet, but there is a bond that is formed between artist and fan through music and performance, and it's different from any other type of relationship that exists. It's a special bond that is difficult to explain, but it gives both sides the strength to move forward and follow their dreams. \n\nI wish all of them the best, and will be a ONCE for the rest of my life.\n\nHappy 5th Anniversary TWICE!",

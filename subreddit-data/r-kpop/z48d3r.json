It feels a bit like the beginning of the end in one way for this group, because Chuu was and is, quite literally a powerhouse in the vocal department.

Probably along the lines of her being in her current position is because of them, if they 'made' her they can destroy her too. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nThem defaming Chuu might sadly be a 'smart' move too because if you think about it, if BBC somehow manages to win the lawsuits, Chuu will be beyond gone. And if BBC loses it, it will be a huge hit on Loona, and boycotting BBC by not buying Loona's albums/merch won't exactly work too because it will definitely hit BBC financially but don't forget that it affects the girls too. So it's either, \"stay quiet and get lost or you risk hurting your (ex) members, take your pick\" giving Chuu an end. They are probably ready to abandon Loona now since they MOST likely holds most if not all of their copyrights as their company, probably similar to how Source Music holds most of GFriend's copyrights other than the *name*. Or they probably have their next new group prepared and is ready to abandon Loona, like how Source Music with Lesserafim. No hate to Lesserafim though, i'm a fan of them but these companies tactics are disgusting.",

It's only been a year since it was announced that Blockberry Creative is in severe debt and it's been evident that they're trying to overwork LOONA in order to alleviate their financial downturn. \n\nI hope Chuu and the rest of LOONA finds the courage to speak up and bring a case to court against Blockberry Creative.",

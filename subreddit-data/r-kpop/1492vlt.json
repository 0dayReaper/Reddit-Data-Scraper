Took me back to 2017/2018-ish Seventeen and they executed it well!\n\n(I knew Pledis won't let the song JUST ends without proper bridge and final chorus tho.)\n\nBut I don't know. Maybe, like Kick It 4 Now, the song and the productions are too good that I ended up not mad at all with the final results \ud83d\ude02 Just a lil bit of shock.",

            "comment": "This is nice, but I kind of wish I liked that prechorus more. I also wanted that same melody from the chorus to be present through the verses (aside from GK and E-chan's raps), simply because I like that chorus (and the post-chorus) a lot. It also feels like it ends so abruptly? I really would have loved a bridge and final chorus to wrap things up. \n\nThey all look so good - particularly love those Heechan and Yuku shots. I really hope this comeback goes well for them! Peak Time really showed me how incredible they are as a team and I hope the best for them.",

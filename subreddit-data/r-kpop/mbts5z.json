She lived in Canada for 6 years and the US for 2, between the ages of 10 and 18. She mentioned that when she came to Korea in 2012 after passing SM auditions, she felt like a foreigner and it was hard for her to adjust. It'd be just as silly to erase her Canadian-ness as it would to erase her Korean identity.",

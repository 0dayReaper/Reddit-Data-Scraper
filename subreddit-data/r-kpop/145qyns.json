They both alternate soft/acoustic verses with heavy/rock choruses. They both have soft rapping/singing Dami. Finally, they both express an all-consuming Love, but in Deja Vu it is possessive (\"So now, I'm holding this pain\") while in Bon Voyage it is unconditional (\"Yeah maybe you don't, but I love you.\") \n\nIt's as if Bon Voyage is the same song as Deja Vu, except it's where you've found the courage to just be happy.",

            "comment": "This album feels like the history of Dreamcatcher, a \"best of\" album with all new songs, while paying tribute to Minx.\n\nIntro: From Us blends the piano intro from \"Dreamcatcher - Mayday\" with a sick guitar solo, played with the notes from \"Minx - Shut Up\".\n\nI love BONVOYAGE. Lyrically it's the story of Dreamcatcher's own personal apocalypse, told from 3 different perspectives:\n\n1) Pre-debut Dreamcatcher (also known as Minx), who are at their lowest point in their careers and who have to make a choice. Give up their dream or re-debut as Dreamcatcher with a completely different image and sound. (verses)\n\n2) Post-debut Dreamcatcher, who are treating every day as their last, going full speed ahead with their new image and sound, while leaving their Minx era image behind. (chorus)\n\n3) Current day Dreamcatcher, a blend of both Minx and Dreamcatcher, who are looking back with pride and love at both versions of themselves. (intro, pre-chorus, bridge and final chorus) \u2764\n\nAlternatively in the climate apocalypse context: Nature is dying, humanity is at a crossroad. If we make the right changes and choices now, and make sure we stick to them and never give up, then in the future humanity can become one with nature and look back at ourselves with pride and love.\n\nBonus Minx connection: You can also see the Minx-Dreamcatcher connection in their stage outfits. They are either traditional Dreamcatcher style and colorful, or Minx style and darker. The dance also does a good job in mixing Dreamcatcher dance moves and Minx like moves.\n\nDEMIAN is current day Dreamcatcher reflecting on the Nightmare and Dystopia era, and how these eras were their Demian. Notice how the first verse is 6-7 lines and the second verse is 3? \"This is a nightmare\" in the first verse and \"Break the wall\" in the second verse are also obvious clues. Demian is a popular book in South Korea about how we wear different masks in different situations, you behave differently around your parents than you do with your friends. It's no secret that on-stage and off-stage Dreamcatcher were very different images. Both the book and the song are about breaking free from the fake mask and becoming your true self. But they are not abandoning the mask, since they also say \"Stay with me my Demian.\"\n\nBonus Minx connection: The first few seconds of this song is VERY similar to a slowed down, pitched down version of the first few seconds of \"Minx - Why did you come to my home?\"\n\nPROPOSE is a obsessive love song, quite similar to BEcause, the next era after Dystopia. BEcause is an important milestone in their discography since it is the first Dreamcatcher title track that is a love song. Following the story of Demian, Dreamcatcher are becoming closer to their true selves or at least the stage persona we see in this comeback. It also feels like the song itself is about Dreamcatcher and Minx merging their images together.\n\nBonus Minx connection: The first few seconds of this song is similar to a slowed down, pitched down version of the first few seconds of \"Minx - Love Shake\"\n\nTo. You is probably my favorite song from the album. Mostly because it was the song that clued me in on what this album was all about. After the first listen, i was left with an intense sense of nostalgia by the instrumentals. I thought first it might be because it reminds me of \"Radiohead - Creep\" at times, but there was something else too in the back of my head. Before i checked out the lyrics, i expected that this was a song dedicated to the fans, but something didn't quite add up after reading and understanding the lyrics.\n\nLyrically this song makes perfect sense if it is Dreamcatcher's love song to Minx and about how they are now embracing and love their past selves. \"Tried to forget you, lock you in the past, i know it's late, but now i want you.\" After making that connection, i checked out all the Minx songs to see if the instrumental parts that triggered my nostalgia was maybe something from a Minx song.\n\nSure enough, turns out the synth lines and the guitar solo are mimicking vocal elements from \"Minx - Like you\". Lyrically these songs mirror each other, since the Minx song is about being hurt, forgetting and moving on, while the Dreamcatcher song is about healing, remembering and holding on.\n\nOllounder and co are musical geniuses. \u2764\n\nThe journey of discovery i made trying understanding this album might be coloring my opinion, but this is my favorite Dreamcatcher album. It narrowly beats out Tree of Language for me.",

Ollounder and the folks from Edenary who've been working on DC stuff for a while now created an album that was a return to older, more rock-heavy Dreamcatcher while still having much of the modern element, and of course reflecting the maturity the members have reached with their vocals and dance. It was nice.\n\nBONVOYAGE is a progressive rock and fresh sound and concept for them that they seemed to enjoy. I found DEMIAN to be not quite my vibe but can appreciate the experimentation factor (plus a big highlight on Dami, who gets to really flex here). Propose is a relentless B-side that gives everyone a chance to shine and To. You isn't just a standard ballad when it has some guitar and rock elements. It's a great album and I listen to it just as much as all the other Dreamcatcher stuff. If you've drifted from Dreamcatcher a bit because you felt there was less rock and more hybrid pop, come back and give this one a listen, it's probably more your vibe.\n\nThe group is on record saying they were nervous since this was the first album after deciding to all renew contracts so between that and the first non-LEEZ album since debut I'm sure they may have been wondering if people would like it. But I don't think they have anything to worry about. They managed to snag two music show wins making it 4 in a year after 0 in 6, which is a nice little bonus, but since people generally have liked the album I think they can rest assured it went well. The group is in the latter part of their career, but it does seem like they're content doing music they love for however long they have left. I can respect that and hope they remain sustainable.",

Last CB was the first time since 2018 that sales went down, but even if they decline again, I'm not too concerned. The group has always had multiple revenue streams to pick from (being one of the most well-traveled touring girl groups of their gen will help that) and so long as the company stays sustainable and the group is happy with their music, I'm content with where they ultimately end up, even if they never climb into S-tier territory. But, of course, I'd love it if they could pull comparable numbers with those 4th gen monster groups, too.\n\nI did see a lot of \"wow this is like old school Dreamcatcher and I love it\" from fans so I think they may potentially pull back some of the people who've churned out of the fandom with this album.",

You couldn't give stuff like Bon Voyage or Demian to young DC, they wouldn't be able to handle it. The range of emotions in the TT and its choreo would have overwhelmed young DC but experienced DC hit it out of the park. \n\nThis was a gutsy album to release for them post-Leez. A lot of their recent success had come under his lead and his sound. This is a complex, provoking album and a testament to DC's time spent learning and growing as vocalists, dancers, and performers.",

What it lacks in length it makes up for in focus: a short, sharp punch to the gut, the most consistently they've ever rocked out, track after track. Even the ballad is a rock ballad full of swirling Smashing Pumpkins guitars.",

I wasn't really feeling the apocalypse saga, but this final stage did it for me.\n\nI'm very into the j-rock sound and Bonvoyage is perfect in that regard. Both Demian and Propose are quickly climbing the ranks of favorite B-sides. I even listen to the intro and don't hate the ballad.\n\nCouldn't be happier with this comeback.\n\nI'm one of those who got into Dreamcatcher *before* getting into k-pop in general, which is why maybe the album doesn't suit the taste of regular kpop fans, I've noticed.",

Wish we could have had more songs of the same quality on this album but i am content with what we got.\n\nThe album contains their best Intro, 2 Top 5 B-Sides and perhaps their best ballad.\n\nNot too sure where i would rank the title among other titles but it is a good one. Lets say it is top 3 of the post Deja Vu title tracks.\n\nThe album is among their most cohesive listening experiences just like Escape the Era and Road to Utopia.\n\nIf this is the quality of future albums we can expect then the loss of Leez was not as bad as it sounded when we first heard he would leave the team.",

            "comment": "It's not an overwhelmingly positive review, so feel free to skip down and downvote if that's how you like to handle these things.\n\nIntro: From us - it's an instrumental intro. It has a nice chunky guitar sound that might have been put to use on a proper song. I rarely listen to these more than a handful of times.\n\nBONVOYAGE - About a minute and a half of really good music and two minutes slow buildup to get to the good stuff, which is not an ideal ratio, but it helps that the good stuff is really good. Probably on the lower end of Dreamcatcher A-sides for me, but still decent overall.\n\nDEMIAN - I was into in on initial listens, but the luster has worn off a bit. Best bits are the pace of  the chorus, Dami's and Gahyeon's rap sections, and a pretty great bridge. It's missing Dreamcatcher's usual harmonic range, the hook didn't keep it's hold me, and the chorus is a bit too repetitive on repeat. It's still in my daily playlist, so I'm digging it to some degree.\n\nPropose - Too slow, too lifeless, not enough going on with the backing or the melody to make up for the lack of pace. \"Break The Wall\" was Dreamcatcher's best version of this sort of song, but this lacks the same oomph.\n\nTo. You. - Too slow, too lifeless, not enough going on with the backing or the melody to make up for the lack of pace. Yes, I'm repeating myself. Could have been good with more lively verses and the guitars cranked up on the chorus. I can imagine this as Dreamcatcher doing a shoegaze song and that might have been interesting.\n\nOverall, it's not great by DC standards. It's down there with Summer Holiday as my least favorite Dreamcatcher release, and I liked \"Because\" a lot more than I liked \"Bonvoyage,\" although I think Demian is probably a better b-side than anything on SH. The group has been incrementally moving away from the reason I got into them in the first place, which is fine. Musical artists develop and change over time, and not always in the way that we want. They still deliver music a cut above what we normally receive from most groups.",

I didn't like the teasers, the sample or the MV compared to their previous ones where I'd normally have them on repeat. \n\nIf it wasn't for the b-sides I would seriously regret buying it.\n\nAs a multi stan I'm not emotionally invested. I just like the music, I still believe Boca was their high point. \n\nThis just seemed, too jpop for a korean title track? Felt like it would be the ending song to an anime and a bit all over the place.",

Different music shows have been reposting their old performances and generating millions of views and new videos featuring them are also getting large views. Rain also had them on his variety show.\n\nI think the fact that We Ride is completely different in sound and concept to Rollin\u2019 is a really good sign for their longevity because new fans are already used to a different style from them.

Rollin has been super popular in the army for quite some time. (iirc this really caused the gp to respect them so much since them doing this for army men who give up two years of their lives for the nation also kind of feels like a national thank you/service)\n\n(i dont really have a source for this ^ other than a reddit comment i read but cant find anymore) \n\nIf you search for 'brave girls rollin military ' on youtube and go to the most viewed video lol, you can see some of the comments from knetz/army people",

They've since collected 5 total music show wins, and broke the record for the number of PAK's for a girl group song. For a song that's four years old! Some of their other songs have also been charting, and their appearances on talk shows are breaking viewer records for some of those shows. It's hard to overstate how much they've turned into Korea's darlings overnight.\n\nTheir producer also announced that he's started working on their next comeback, so they're here to stay for at least a little while longer.",

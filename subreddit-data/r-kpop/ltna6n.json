She's my fave for that reason! And the dance for rollin' is hard! They're dancing on top of stools (not really shown well in the video) in high heels and have a real danger of falling and this girl can smile through that? Damn.",

The late 70s/80s have been in since 2012 when Bruno Mars dropped Locked Out of Heaven with those Police vibes and Daft Punk brought disco and funk back with Get Lucky. It's only grown since then and I agree, K-Pop followed suit in 2nd gen (Reboot is a prime example).\n\nI still wouldn't disagree with those who say the retro trend has been particularly present lately though - the genres have just changed a bit and more artists have jumped on the bandwagon. Last year, pretty much every major group promoted retro-inspired singles, from BTS, TWICE and GFRIEND to EVERGLOW, Lovelyz and NCT. While disco has become a permanent fixture and is as dominant as ever, I'd say synthwave and city pop have gotten more common now compared to 5-6 years ago, while New Jack Swing is also making more appearances.",

I am showing my age here. I remember sexy concepts being trendy and cool!), how the members are cute and hot, how this should be played at wars and the soldiers will definitely win etc. \n\n\nEdit 2: 4 hours ago, the channel did a [part 2](https://youtu.be/tc4HW5DWkMU)!!",

It isn't on Melon 24Hits or on FLO or Soribada, but the former two can take several hours to chart on because of how they count listeners and the latter is basically a dedicated trot chart at this point. I'm hopeful to see if it lands on Melon 24Hits after the chart unfreezes in the morning... 2017 was the year I got into kpop so I have fond memories attached to a lot of releases from that year.",

Very 2nd gen-esque in sound, IMO.\n* [High Heels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InezMk7Ptt0) \\- I'm partial to the remix (which was on the Rollin' album). Such a sultry, fun song.

The fact the choreo for this song had them in heels on a small stool and sitting in mid air boggled my mind in 2017 on the physicality of it all, and it still does seeing it today.\n\nBut damn.  This is really nice to see.    Brave Girls released some absolute bangers,  Deepend,  High Heels and Rollin to name a few.\n\nAnd good old Squirtle having the time of her life performing at [0:53](https://youtu.be/cfHWIqJkEf4?t=53)",

But they got a lot of side eye since it was a sexy concept . Lot of people expressed that they thought it would have been better if it was a bright summer concept song.  And the company brought out a New version of the MV thats a summer concept . They have a clean version too since the og MV was too risque .  \n\nI'm so happy that this song is getting some attention again ! Their comeback - We ride is one of my favourite songs from last year !",

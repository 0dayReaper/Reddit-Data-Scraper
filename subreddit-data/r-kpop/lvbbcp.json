I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d think there\u2019s a higher chance they\u2019d release an actual, industry-standard mini than a 2-track single album for her. \n\nI mean hey it would be awesome if she gets more than 2 songs but this is YG. I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been following artists from that company but they were never really known for churning out actual discographies the way other companies do. Save for that glitch that happened in 2014. For someone who isn\u2019t GD she\u2019s already lucky that she\u2019s gotten a b-side track for her first solo release. Even Lee Hi, an actual soloist, didn\u2019t get one during her time.",

And Katie Kim. Ros\u00e9 recording so many songs doesn\u2019t guarantee that YG will release all of them at once*, if not at all. \n\nConsidering the fact that BP has pretty much outlived and outpaced former YG female acts I\u2019m pretty sure that Ros\u00e9 will eventually release a standard mini/album down the road. Even better if they actually give her 3-4 songs in one go for this debut*. I just think it\u2019s weird that considering YG\u2019s history with artist discography people still expect the company to pull an SM/JYP right off the bat when that isn\u2019t really the case with them.",

That didn\u2019t stop YG from controlling their discographies. Look, BP has outpaced these former female artists (as well as many of their non yg contemporaries) way before Love Sick girls was even a thing, and yet The Album still had 8 tracks. Big Bang keeping YG afloat for a long ass time didn\u2019t stop YG from stretching MADE the way they did... and this is what? Their highest peak. \n\nRos\u00e9 is mighty popular and capable of releasing a huge hit, but as of now she has no solo numbers to show for that would warrant YG to give her an industry standard album right off the bat. Especially if YG is more focused on keeping the group brand more dominant than their individual careers for the next five years. Add to the fact that Blinks aren\u2019t experienced as VIPs when it comes to handling group and individual success, as Blinks are more similar to Blackjacks wherein fans couldn\u2019t seem to properly grasp how solo work could add value to the group\u2019s overall profile in the long run. \n\nAs I\u2019ve said in my previous comments, it would be awesome if Ros\u00e9 gets more than two songs for this debut. I just think fans should manage their expectations considering YG\u2019s history &amp; the way BP has been promoted since day 1 (ie. the more successful they become, the stingier YG gets).",

Most recent examples are iKON and Lee Suhyun. Mino and Bobby both had \u201cfull album\u201d included in their first teaser. \n\nSo, chances are this is just a two-track single.",

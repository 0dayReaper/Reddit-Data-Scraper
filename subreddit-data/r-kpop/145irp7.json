Same goes with Fan Bing Bing as Blink in X-Men Days of Future past.\n\nWhile it does have a bit more lining up cause the whole cast will be asian and the character is a kpop singer, she still may be regulated to a small part.",

We need more directors like this, not less. \n\nGuardians 3 was a significant improvement over the last one. Although a bit more editing would have made it even better. It was by far the best Guardians and the best villain since Thantos.\n\nWhich was played by the brillant Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary. I do agree the writing needs to be more consistent &amp; less pulled from the basement shelf. :/",

There are some exceptions, i think Robert downey jr basically played his role as well as one could have done, but most of the mcu roles aren't on nearly that level of tangible effect, though that is also on the writing and not giving the room for it.  \nWith that being said, to even just be 'fine' in such a project is far from trivial and not something just anyone can do right from the get go. Coming across as not akward, stilted, just weird, might not be the highest of acting expertise, but it's something you have to nail anyway.  \n  \nSo when i see for example (and i mention him because it's in the article) simu liu's shang-chi, i am not partcularly impressed (and it only became clearer because he had to act in the same scenes as tony leung), but it's fine, it won't stand out badly. Something a new actor or actress very easily could.  \nI'll have to see more of jennie in the idol, as three lines are hardly enough to judge, but to be quite honest, even with these it never quite flowed as well as i'd have liked it (though that could be bias from simply seeing jennie, not her character)",

Tom Holland too, he IS the awkward nerdy gen Z that the screenplay wanted. \n\nI never had any complaints about the other actors' acting. \n\nJennie in The Idol... well, she seemed a too conscious of the cameras, which is something real idols do, but it also made me really aware that she was playing a part in a show",

The backup dancers did better than her and had strength in their moves which Jennie lacked. And some of the dance movements she did was kind of awkward. Lisa would have suited that role better in my opinion but she would have outshone all of them so I guess they wouldn't like that. But yeah as an actress you're not supposed to make people be aware that you are playing a role in the show, it's supposed to be natural.",

They got Brie Larson a semi irrelevant actress who happened to be an Oscar winner to spearhead a whole franchise to a billion dollar debut film \n\nIf theyre choosing Jennie, its not because they need her to sell a film, Marvel alone sells their brand. Its because they see her as fit for the character, whether its the aesthetic or the talent.",

Also I believe there is a 'Silk' project in production already, [yup there is](https://deadline.com/2022/11/spider-man-spin-off-series-silk-mgm-amazon-1235175212/). But that character is South Korean and Jennie could pull off being 20-ish years old. As for Luna Snow, I don't know anything about that character.\n\nIt's wild she'd have the time to film a Marvel TV show. Those usually take months. Yes, during COVID and since it ended they had tons of time in which they seemingly did nothing but model, socialite, attend fashion shows and chill at home. But now very post-COVID (business-wise) with the world tour and how much money they made... I'd be low-key shocked if TBL/YG just gave them \\~3 months of free time to pursue other ventures or get R&amp;R. My expectation of companies, especially if there's boat loads of cash sitting there just begging to be taken, if for them to make them work and take it. You'd think after the tour they'd give them 2-4 weeks R&amp;R and then go straight into maybe a few solo comebacks and then a group comeback and then go back on World Tour to make another 200-300 million dollars.",

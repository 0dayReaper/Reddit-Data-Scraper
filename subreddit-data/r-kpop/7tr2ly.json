            "comment": "Like many of you here on r/kpop, I don't speak Korean. For all I know, these lyrics could be about summoning a demon. They could be singing about porridge. I have no clue what these goddesses are spitting at me. I only know two things:\n\n**1.** It's provocative, and\n\n**2.** https://i.imgur.com/xeQSqDY.jpg.\n\nAnd those are all the things I need to know.\n\n**Edit:** Even though they bamboozled people into thinking they were going hard hip-hop with the teaser, I am incredibly satisfied with Red Velvet knocking another R&amp;B track straight out of the park instead. Long review incoming, please bear with me if it gets too pretentious.\n\n____________\n\nLet's start with the main chord progression. It's sweet. Here it is, from what I discerned from the first teaser (feel free to correct me):\n\n***Em9 -&gt; A13 -&gt; Dmaj7 -&gt; D#7 #9***\n\nTake a look at that. You don't even have to understand any music theory to see that that looks a little whacky and complicated. It's actually not *too* wild; it's a variation on a really common chord progression (II-V-I), but the harmonic variations are pretty jazzy and interesting for a pop song of any sort. Very spooky vibes already. Additionally, not only is this intro beat harmonically dense, but instrumentally it's actually fairly sparse. A complaint I've long had about Red Velvet's hip-hop influenced b-sides are that the beats are too tacky... Not the case here. The trap percussion is pretty understated behind that bouncy synth; the lack of an 808 (the really deep, booming synthetic drum sound you hear in a lot of rap music) is refreshing.\n\nThen again, this is decidedly *not* a hip-hop track. This is R&amp;B, through and through. If Automatic and Perfect 10 had a groovier, more danceable twin sister, this would be it. The bassline is slick, and it never gets too dark or too bright in its harmonic color. The bassline is one of the best parts of this, some very cool rhythms going on. Specifically, the added bass behind Yeri's first verse is especially crunchy. The mixing is just unreal as always with RV; not a sound out of place, even in a song with as many complex moving parts as this.\n\nSick beat aside, this song still doesn't work without the vocals. Thankfully, this is Red Velvet we're talking about. The two-note sliding ad-libs to open it are incredibly attention-grabbing. I've really grown to appreciate Irene and Yeri's vocal colors as well, they've really shown that they're capable of holding their own. The lilting rhythm of Irene's opening lines and Yeri's part after the first chorus are highlights of the entire song. And of course, the background harmonies. It's honestly wild that RV as a group can consistently churn out jazzy harmonies as casually and effectively as they do. They're never in your face, the background vocals just chill in the back of every song killing it. This song's no different, especially all throughout the chorus.\n\nOh yeah, and did I mention that the dance, visuals, and MV are lit, because they're lit also\n_________________\n\n**LONG STORY SHORT:** Red Velvet is back with another bonafide hit, no surprises there. Hopefully this all made some sense, go ahead and @ me if it didn't or if you feel violated by my excessively long comment reviews. If you have any questions about music theory and music production-related stuff, my opinions come almost exclusively out of my own ass, but maybe I can help point you in the right direction!",

It definitely feels like the true Velvet comeback people were calling for with a tad more energy. I think a repackage comeback was the perfect time for SM to try something a lot more different like this. Like with EXO's Lotto or SNSD's Run Devil Run which werent very public friendly comebacks, but were opportunities to try something new on a larger scale without it having to be as impactful as a main comeback.\n\nGreat write up btw.

Throwing another chord or two in the second or third verse would\u2019ve added some nice variety and motion (maybe even a short key change), but instead they chose to change timbres, what instrument played, and put more/cut out layers each verse to differentiate between them.\n\nNot necessarily a bad thing, just a preference thing. I guess I\u2019m just used to Red Velvet weirding me out  with their quirky stuff, but this is their Velvet side so I get it. It actually gets better the more I listen to it.\n\nI agree with what you said about their past R&amp;B stuff. They do a good job setting the tone, but the bass and drums never had enough \u201cspice\u201d and felt like they were too basic (by I guess they were trying to be more authentic 90s R&amp;B).

It's both smooth and soft but with a power and passion to it. It's not quite One of These Nights but it's not quite Dumb Dumb.",

                            "comment": "Sure, keep in mind that these are just my opinions (and I'd argue these songs are still pretty good despite some issues).\n \nOn Perfect Velvet I found [Attaboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NirVGwV1Fww) to be a big offender of this. Like I mentioned above, there's a very liberal usage of 808 drums, little triplet hi-hats and triangle sounds, and things that are associated with a lot of trap-hop music. Not that Attaboy is trap-hop, of course; it's a very uniquely composed song (I wouldn't even call it hip-hop), but I personally feel like it mixes too many elements for its own good. Good songs from all sorts of genres can utilize those sounds effectively, but I thought it was a little much.\n\n[Time Slip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9wqjEBHmMY) has a lot of the same problematic elements as well, although I still love most of this song. Mostly the intro/breakdown of the song (with the grunting on 2 and 4) are what bother me.  \n\nI also feel that the rap-intensive Red Velvet songs are generally the weakest; the rapping is definitely workable in small doses, but it can get grating. Hip-hop is something SM groups and producers have always struggled with imo, with some notable exceptions. Again, just some opinions!",

The song isn't as dark as I thought it'd be though, it's actually kinda easy going despite the intense imagery. However the juxtaposition between the bad girl image and the softer looks (the group lying in bed wearing pink and the snowfall) is perfect. Perfect Red Velvet. ",

Red Velvet has left Quentin Tarantino unemployed. Ending scene? AMAZING! Concept? Red Velvet was the one who told Merriam Webster the definition of the word!\n\nBut, even though I love the MV...alright, I'll just be really honest; I can't say I love this song and think its perfection like I always do each RV comeback. Is it good? Yes. And I'm sure it'll grow on me!! But...IDK. I wish I could be enthusiastic enough to spazz in all caps but I'm not. Maybe this is a combo of just fatigue and not being in the right space, but I wish I liked it more. It's good, but...I expected more. I really don't like saying that, because Red Velvet are like my 2nd bias group and the reason why I even stay active in k-pop now, and I usually am like 135% enthusiastic every time, but I always have high expectations with each comeback and...well, I didn't get blown away like I usually do. It's good, but I didn't feel satisfied. \n\nThat said, I'm glad so many people like it and have enjoyed it! It's always fun seeing new fans join with each RV comeback and reading through the comments, seeing how much people love their songs so I'm happy everyone's enjoying the comeback! It's still a good song and I'm happy RV is enjoyed by so many people!!! It's amazing. Even if I didn't like it, don't let that stop you from getting into RV and liking their songs and music! \n\nEdit: Literally why do I ever doubt Red Velvet, I gave it some time to overcome my initial disappointment and listened to it without the MV and it's starting to sound better already. This is probably gonna be for me what for everyone else was Rookie. It's gonna be a grower but I feel like I'll end up really liking this one. Still can't say I'm floored and stunned and like there was a total impactful \"WOW THAT WAS GREAT\" epiphany for me here, but I'm glad I'm starting to hear some stuff I like after a couple more listens.

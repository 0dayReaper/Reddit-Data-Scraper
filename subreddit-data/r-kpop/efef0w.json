I can\u2019t imagine she was doing anything more than just standing there beautifully putting on a flawless vocal performance. That coupled with the [previous reports](https://twitter.com/misayeon/status/1209097913453948928?s=21) before this even happened of other artists looking visibly scared at the shaky stages as well as Wendy having plenty of experience dancing and performing on such stages - idc I\u2019m blaming SBS.  \n\nThem also doubling down in their statements to distance themselves from any fault (probably trying their best to deflect blame) to the point they can\u2019t even say sorry to Wendy but will apologise to the fans is disgusting.",

I can't say this any other way.\n\n**Bone notes:**\n\nGeneral timelines for an upper limb fracture are 6 weeks to union, 12 weeks to full consolidation (union being \"if an uncomplicated fracture, bone cells from broken ends touch\", and consolidation being fully healed and able to support full body weight).\n\nLower limb is 12 weeks to union, 24 weeks to full consolidation. Spinal column fractures usually sit somewhere in between but with the pelvis being a more weight-bearing structure, could be on the longer end. It does depend greatly on the fracture severity and location though - for example are we talking an undisplaced avulsion fracture, a stress fracture, or a displaced fracture? Open, closed, tiny chip off iliac crest vs whopping crack through ileum?\n\nEither way I'd be expecting serious load modification at best with a serious query about whether extended bedrest (or hectic bracing) is indicated. Our lady is sadly going to be out of commission for a while.\n\n**Musculoskeletal notes:**\n\nOne of the internal core muscles (also pelvic stabilisers) is the diaphragm, which effectively drives breathing. Once Wendy's bones heal she's likely to have to re-learn how to breathe as a singer again and go through a kind of \"singer's rehab\" - and that's on top of a general musculoskeletal rehab expected from bone-healing-related-deconditioning. Again, going to be out for a while :( (and with a pelvic, and a young presumably hypermobile patient, there's a chance of women's health issues as well, dammit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically we could be anticipating a 3-6 month rehab at best, with a chance of things being closer to 12+ months depending on fracture location/severity and how her rehab goes. Pelvic girdle is unfortunately a very important weight-bearing and dynamic stability area of the body, requiring skilled co-ordination of lots of muscles - and this is even more important for a professional singer or dancer.\n\nThe important things are that she's getting treatment at the moment and her company is flagging early that she's going to focus on healing - this is NOT something that can or should be rushed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest wishes, Wendy! I'm so sorry this happened to you, and I hope you feel supported by a great healthcare team right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsource: healthcare practitioner",

You can't expect people to do the right thing when doing the right thing means you get reamed out in court. \n\nThey apologized for RV not performing because they aren't going to get sued for dropping a performance but they definitely will be sued for the stage conditions.",

Like, I don't wanna sound corny but she's the one who always grounds me down when I'm feeling upset or just in bad mood with her singing and her silliness... This really broke me.\n\nAnd seeing Wendy at her peak confidence since Summer Magic in 2018 till now, her fractured pelvis bc some brainless ass staff didn't know how to ensure safety is surely would crack that even a little. She can be terribly humble to the point it gets to borderline self-deprecating at times and it's so awfully annoying that I hope she won't beat herself bc of this. Nothing of this is her fault.\n\nBut I also can't help but worry about her future... I mean, I'm sure they'll still promote with those dances and stuff for another year or two and I'm really worrying her ability as a dancer for the long run. I hope it is a minor one. I wish her dancing ability is not getting hindered by this accident, I already narrated WenSeul as main dancers and vocalists duo and nothing would take that away from me. Not by the fuckin dumb irresponsible SBS staff.\n\nI'm also disheartened by the possibility that they might have to promote as 4 for Psycho promotional cycle that I wish they just don't promote at all, it will be the usual 2 weeks anyway. 5-1=0 and I don't want her antis taking this as an advantage to dismiss her presence in the song. I know most of them are trolls but I really can't stand such negativities. :(\n\nAnd the Japanese tour too... Gosh, this is just so hard for me and probably harder for the members too.\n\nThis is literally their best comeback to date with so many achievements and good vibes around the girls and us in the fandom and to see that the supposedly \"professional broadcasting company\" ruining it by being unprofessional is just leaving such sour taste to me.\n\nI hope for her speedy recovery with little to no damage and - lemme be wishful - for SM to take legal measures against SBS for the negligence of safety. Considering other complaints from the other artists too about how shaky and slippery the stages are. No one's safety should be compromised by such dumbassery.\n\nAnd for her family and the members to be strong. Especially the members because they have to go through this and keep it professional.\n\n\"Hey now we'll be okay, it's alright\" line in Psycho really hits different as of now.",

(unlikely though given she won\u2019t have fallen from a great height)\n\nAlso the sharp edges of the bone can also cause damage to local structures.  e.g. in the arm can cause local nerve damage/pelvic fractures can pierce the urethra etc. \n\n\nI\u2019m hoping these injuries are of the mildest variety and that our wendy is happy and healthy as soon as humanly possible. sending love.",

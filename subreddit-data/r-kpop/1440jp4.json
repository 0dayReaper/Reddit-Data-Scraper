As described by the production team, this \u2018Friendship Song\u2019 will combine the talents, determination, and stories of all 26 contestants to create a colorful soundscape. The performance is also said to include stage outfits reminiscent of the year-end awards shows. \n\n&gt;Lee Seu-Ran, Nmore &amp; Shannon are credited as part of the music production team for \u2018RISE UP\u2019.

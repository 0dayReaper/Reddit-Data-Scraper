I love the classical imagery and he did say that Dante\u2019s Inferno was one of the references he used\u2026but I was not expecting this. It\u2019s fascinating. I find myself even more curious now.",

We see him hunched over and maybe even defeated, and surrounded by pure evil from all sides. Then we see a beam of light beginning to shoot through the dark clouds which grows and grows and grows until we are blinded by it. Even though it starts off dark, that light gives us reason to believe everything will be okay :)",

Daniel is giving his all for this mini, and I'm glad, those people tried everything to destroy him and almost succeded and yet, he persevered and now he can proudly show off he won.",

If you want to discuss the evolution of K-pop the next era (5th) next generation of K-POP. KANGDANIEL has set the standard so high! Standard K-pop music videos aren\u2019t going up cut it anymore. This man is truly a vision of art. And artists.. not a K-pop idol .. he is a true Michael angelo of his era.",

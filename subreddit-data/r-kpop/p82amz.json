The news trended and everybody made jokes about pulling a Chen, but iKON are blaming him for ruining the group (cause they are still in the rising phase and not established million sellers, now who knows when they are gonna have a comeback) and his own solo fans are shocked. I saw some people who just said bye, adios. So I guess it\u2019s pretty similar to the Korean side. Chinese fans are mostly angry because he didn\u2019t say anything before, dropping the news mere weeks before child birth. Also having a baby before the wedding is seen as irresponsible act for a guy in China (no protection, it\u2019s not well perceived a pregnant bride), all peculiarities of the society.",

Don't think he was ever involved in a relationship rumour too. But congrats anyway! lmfao at the fact that the baby is gonna be born next month though, bobby's been sitting on this news for so long while performing on Kingdom too",

Could also be that they've just been really good at hiding their relationship from the public just like I'm sure many other idols have been doing.",

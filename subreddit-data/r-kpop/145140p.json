I mean first, with her being really flustered around Hyungwon (and descending into a drunken mess while he sat there looking all hot and put together). Then Jooheon came on the show and not only met her level of energy but exceeded it. \n\nAnd now we've got introverted I.M and the way he is so earnestly trying but just cannot get on the same page with Youngji at all is *so cute* to watch.",

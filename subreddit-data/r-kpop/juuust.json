They grew up in a society that believe it. They are conditioned to be surrounded by it, not only in real life, but online as well.\n\nIt's far beyond what they do to save their career. It is part of who they really are.\n\nThen again, from time to time I also feel like these fans had known and understood this but chose to ignore it to justify being a fan.",

How much ground are we required to give and why can't we even criticise it.\n\nPicture this: China launches a hostile invasion of Taiwan resulting in the death of 100000 Taiwanese. \n\nIf they then post in favour of it do I have to say \" they are just saying what they have to say\" and \"oh it's not their fault\" or can I correctly say actually as an idol and public figure they are complicit in spreading the message to the young population that the murder of 100000 Taiwanese is justified and that they are partly responsible for it because of it. \n\nThe same thing on a more minor scale happened in Hong Kong. People including little kids got beaten up by the police and high and mighty Victoria who never needs to work another day in her life if she didn't want to happily sold out everyone in Hong Kong to further increase her bank balance.\n\nChinese idols DO have a choice. If they make clear that they want to promote in Korea people will be a lot of receptive to them like they are with Tzuyu etc. Nobody told them to go back to China and sell out their morality, it was their decision. The fact that you are arguing like they have zero choice is just false.\n\nAlso they are not working in the Chinese system. Victoria posted that garbage on Instagram. Like honestly, fuck off! Post it on Weibo in the echo chamber, spreading it to Instagram is straight up malicious. That site is blocked in China.",

It makes absolute sense, it clearly does, and you should be worried that your default response to things you disagree with is to put your common sense away and turn your brain off, rather than just think.\n\nOf course people get passionate about things they don't like! Come on dude, don't be silly. \"Makes no sense\" because you **decided** not to think about it!",

I don't think ripping a movie is an apt comparison at all, you're not actually putting effort and going out of your way to hate on the movie and its creators, it's just a fun one time thing that doesn't hurt anyone.\n\nBitching about your boss is understandable because it's someone that directly affects your life, sometimes in a bad way, so that too is different from hating and posting hateful comments about someone on the other side of the planet you could choose to completely ignore if you wanted to.",

I would hope the people making these are just too young to have actual things to care about but gut instinct tells me they arent and thats insanely sad. On the other hand, I barely have actual important life plans that last for 10 years. Who has time to plan something like this out?? Its kinda impressive in the dedication but its also just kinda bizarre to me. I barely have any of the same interests i did 10 years ago. Idk.

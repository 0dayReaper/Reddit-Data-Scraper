YHS founded YG Entertainment in 1996 with his brother, n~~ow CEO~~, Yang Min-Suk. (**Update: Yang Min-Suk also stepped down**)\n\nOver the years YG Entertainment has featured artists such as Gummy, Wheesung, Seven, PSY, Lee Hi, Somi, One, home to Epik High for several years, AKMU, Sechs Kies, and put together groups such as BIGBANG, 2NE1, Winner, iKON, Blackpink, and the yet to debut Treasure 13. The label has several subsidiaries including The Black Label (houses artists like Zion.T and Somi), Moonshoot which is a cosmetics subsidiary, as well as sports, modeling, acting, and TV production subsidiaries. \n\nYHS has come under fire over the years for treatment of his idols, both the men and especially the women, along with several questionably legal actions. In the past few months YHS has been under suspicion for mediating prostitution, tax evasion, and destruction of evidence. [In the past few days it has come to light that YHS allegedly threatened the key witness for the investigation of one of his idols.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/c0348f/megathread_ikon_bis_drug_scandal/)\n\n***\n\n**We have a new Megathread.

YG stepping down from all his positions is so huge, and in my opinion it\u2019s bigger than his stock ownership in terms of influence and day to day management of the company. Large stockholders can have various ways of mostly indirect influence on company decisions, but YG stepping down is much more direct in terms of impact.",

He's currently involved in multiple scandals - embezzlement, police bribery, drugs, involvement in the Burning Sun scandal, prostitution etc. This was probably the last drop, hopefully his next stop is jail.  \nAs to the reason why so many people have reacted to the news, mostly positively, it's because not only was he horrible in managing his artists, for which he is hated by most fans of the groups that are under his former agency, but he's also known for being a horrible person overall. Not to mention that he had the balls to admit on TV that he was a p\\*dophile, that he had his eyes on his wife since she was a minor and that he ruined her career on purpose so she can get married to him. You can find a lot problematic things he said/did so far with just a quick google search. Oh, and one more thing, he's also connected to Choi Soon Sil, if you're familiar with the impeachment of the previous president of SK, so his connections are believed to go as far as government and military officials.",

I mean we have all been praying to God, Allah, Buddha, Flying Spaghetti Monster that he would leave, but did not expect it to be so soon. \n\nIt's a step in the right direction but it is a tiny one. If his brother is still the CEO, I do not think much would change as he would still control everything behind the scenes. Also that he has what - 16. something % in shares definitely is an issue as well.. I do think he needs to be prosecuted and put behind those cute lil bars called jail but at least something is happening to him finally.",

I mean I\u2019m ok with it but he can\u2019t just release statements like, \u201cthey do drug tests every 2 months\u201d \u201ceveryone at yg is clean\u201d  \u201cwe were not involved with her\u201d \u201cwe didn\u2019t meet with her at all\u201d \u201cBI did nothing wrong\u201d to step down a day later. If he\u2019s so confident in their innocence and his, to release these kinds of statements to the public, he needs to stick to his word. He needs to go down with his lies as the truth comes out. He\u2019s such a coward. \n \nHan Seo Hee has all the right cards that just keep disproving his blatant lies. He\u2019s an idiot. He underestimated her and he overestimated himself and his power to influence the public. His PR team is dumb as hell to just keep releasing false statements which makes him look like a narcissistic bitch.",

All the reviews are accurate and deserved.",

Especially the Zimzalabim encore party! \n\nWhen they mentioned they didn't think they would have many fans attending, the whole concert hall went crazy, glad to prove them wrong. I guess EU Kpop fans don't have that many ways to show their presence. We don't get exclusive merch or company shops and the charts are divided by country, where in some, it's hard for any foreign act to chart high as well as limited tour dates and capacity if any at all. Really hope SM recognises Luvies more now and we can get more opportunities to see the girls again with Joy in the future!",

They literally think they are nugu internationally because of SM. \n\nSM had the group focused so much more domestically these last few years and the last time they performed at least in America was 2018. \n\nWhen SM have two girl groups who would do great with international promotion especially Red Velvet and with their Velvet side just look at how people ate up Bad Boy, Peek-A-Boo, Psycho, and Wildside\n\nAll Red Velvet Spotify listeners are international Reveluvs which beats out Korean Reveluvs which should\u2019ve told SM that you need to partner with a label for Red Velvet for global promotion.\n\nIt\u2019s such a shame that they really think that cause they are popular internationally SM is just incompetent about it",

You, BLACKPINK! I also declare that 2NE1 has reformed! Suhyun, I'm releasing that solo album of yours! Free solo albums for Rose, Jisoo, and Lisa! Oh, but one more thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Apple-style keynote ensues.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now announcing a new device that you are all going to keep on you, 24/7. The \"Jennie\" detector. Now, after Yang Hyun Suk left, we all suspect that he took Jennie with him. And we all know he installs trackers in all trainees. So, if you start hearing beeping from this tracker, it will alert the YGE defence squad to find Jennie again. Who knows what that pedo will do with her...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Unending applause.*",

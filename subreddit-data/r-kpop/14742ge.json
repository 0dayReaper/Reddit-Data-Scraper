Not surprised about Stray Kids - I realized how huge their fandom in the US is - when I went to KCON LA last year - they had the loudest screams the crowd was going nuts! \nThose sales definitely reflect that! \n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong - but I assume they didn\u2019t have any US distribution before - that\u2019s why they started charting fairly recently - and went from not charting at all - to charting straight to #1?? Correct?\nI wonder what stopped JYP to not distribute their albums before?\n\nAND HUGE CONGRATS TO ENHYPEN - they are literally 2.5 years old and already got a Top 5!! I think 85K sales is AMAZING achievement - especially because the album distribution was delayed for 2 whole weeks in the US!!!\n\nI feel like if it wasn\u2019t delayed that much - they could have done maybe 100K also! Because a lot of US engenes order the albums before those 2 weeks from other sources. WeVerse Global Pre-orders have much better perks too, so lots of people do group orders (since WeVerse global has now been officially closed to people that live in the U.S., you can\u2019t order albums from there anymore)\n\nAnd AGAIN - a distribution question - I don\u2019t get WHY the company doesn\u2019t just distribute the US albums on time? Like in the same week the albums hit the rest of the world? Isn\u2019t it much more beneficial? HYBE has only done that with some BTS solos, TXT a few years back (but now they get normal timely distribution) and now ENHYPEN.",

                    "comment": "&gt;I wonder what stopped JYP to not distribute their albums before?\n\nYou have to know how to do that and have connections. JYPE started their partnership with Republic Records with Twice starting in 2020. Twice is usually the test group. That partnership formally extended to SKZ and Itzy in 2022, and it just extended to NMIXX and Xdinary Heroes last month. Other kpop groups got US labels faster, to varying levels of success.\n\n&gt;And AGAIN - a distribution question - I don\u2019t get WHY the company doesn\u2019t just distribute the US albums on time?\n\nUsually there are business reasons. I don't remember who else released that week, but it could be strategic to get a better chart position or for some other reason we just don't know. Maybe Enhypen will be over here to promote soon and wanted the album fresher? I have no idea what the situation is, but I know a few kpop groups have upset their kfans promoting in the US first/too close to their release date.\n\nI don't like super asynchronous dates, but I think diehard fans would just buy it from a store that'll count for first week sales on Hanteo and buy it again for Billboard.",

They didn\u2019t have a US label or US distribution hence why none of their albums charted on billboard before oddinary. Once they signed with a label all of their entries were #1. Most kpop albums charted lower before  getting higher because they have distribution early on in their careers. Stray kids got it in their 4th year and already had a big fanbase so it wasn\u2019t hard to reach #1 right off the bat",

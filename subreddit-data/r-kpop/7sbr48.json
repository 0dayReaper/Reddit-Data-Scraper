There is no way we can know for sure how he was feeling on the day of the shoot, but he made sure to finish the mv (and album) for us and i will treasure that hard work. So while he was most likely depressed when filming this (Among countless other things) i know he took pride and joy in his work and i will try to focus on the good but man if it isnt difficult af. ",

Even though I'm crying and it's half sadness, it's also happiness because I'm so happy you made this and that it's such a fun and uplifting MV. It's weird, y'know, not being able to watch this without crying, but I'm just so happy I get to see you in an MV again! It's such a lovely MV, you really outdid yourself with the choreography and the aesthetics this MV (but then again, when do you not?). I like how you turned a usually boring key like C major and made it so fun, bright and vibrant and happy! You, and IU with Palette last year, you two both really know how to make you happy. It's a different take and I love it so much.\n\nI love the song and the slight disco vibes, I like the refreshing feeling of the music, and I love your harmonies like always. I love the descending E-E-D-D-C line throughout the song because even though it's a simple third, you do it so well with the funky synth and the instrumentation and of course your wonderful musicianship. You always were an amazing musician, even moreso an artist, and I'm happy that even before the end, you still made music and it was so wonderful. I always listened to your music because it made me happy; even though I'm not exactly 100% happy right now, thanks for making me feel better! \n\nI have nothing else to say, I miss you a lot! A lot of people do, really. But this helped a lot with that! It really makes me so happy, even as I'm crying in my room right now just listening to this again, I feel relieved for this first time since last month when I heard about you. You say \"always be with you,\" but Jonghyun, I hope you know we'll always be with you! Your music is so uplifting and positive, and I hope you know that I'll always treasure it, and we'll always treasure you! You are Kim Jonghyun, a part of SHINee Five, and we'll always be by your side, even past 1000 years!\n\nThanks for this Jonghyun. I hope after you worked hard and gave us this to enjoy, you can rest well and be at peace. Just know that you're always shining, like the moon at night you're always a bright light in my life, and I hope you're without worry or strife. And I hope you're as happy as you made me feel right now.\n\nTruly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you, Jonghyun!",

I enjoyed watching it. He is literally shining in the video. I ended up smiling and just cherishing everything that he has given us. Yes, Jonghyun. You are always with us. :')",

At first I was a little disappointed with the title track and only liked the other tracks off the album, but it grew on me. This happens with every Jonghyun\u2019s album, I always exclusively enjoy the album tracks and the title tracks grow on me later. I thought I\u2019d be weeping, but it made me happy to see him do what he loved the most, music. \nBy the way, does anyone know of a k-pop store that ships to Europe for a decent price? I desperately want to buy this album. Thanks in advance. ",

This is easily a bop without a doubt, and the repetitive pre-chorus, chorus, and post-chorus along with the beat still resonate in my head, giving me a warm fuzzy sense of comfort. This is a well-executed song that serves its purpose with outstanding vocals from Jonghyun. \n\nI thought the M/V would make me cry, but it actually didn't. I found myself immersed in a bit of sadness, yes, but more so provoked thought and a great deal of happiness as I know many of you probably have. I told myself not to over analyze but I can't help it. This is his last M/V, and he knew it, but yet it's so straightforward with little to no hidden messages (at the time of writing this) that I'm almost perplexed. A great emphasis is placed on him hosting a radio show, and multiple devices that you can use to listen to (his) music, which appears to be his 'happy' place, recording for us. \n\nThe sad thing for me as I write this post is that ... I know this is his final hurrah, his final gift, and his final words. I'm beginning to feel overwhelmed so I'll stop here.\n\nJonghyun, I have so much to say...but I really hope you found the relief you were looking for. I've found comfort in this album and I thank you for creating it, and SM for going through with publishing it on schedule. You did well, truly, and I know you, the poet, the artist, will always be with us. \n",

Going straight into my kpop playlist and will be streaming the mv as much as i can.  \n\nI'm happy that Shinin' is the song that Jonghyun leaves us with (sorry if that sounds weird, i tried to find another way to say it but i couldn't) because it leaves his fans that message that Jonghyun will always be with them. \n\nThank you Jonghyun for making music.

I haven\u2019t listened to any of his solo stuff or Shinee since that first terrible awful day and I was sure that when I finally heard this I would just be a wreck but about 10seconds in I was bouncing in my chair with tears running down my face. It\u2019s so good. ITS SO GOOD. I\u2019m not shocked because I mean, all of his stuff is but it\u2019s such an airy and peppy song that makes me smile so much. Throw in the super cheesy CGI (please someone gif him sitting on the huge radio lol) and it just makes me laugh. Its hard because I guess he wasn\u2019t in the best mind space filming this probably but it feels like he wanted this to be as wonderful and joyful as it could be for us? Does that make sense?  When I woke up that day and found out him it just sort of broke me. I\u2019m not out of it but this helps so much. It feels like it\u2019s the first deep breath I\u2019ve taken in a month. It\u2019s just so dang infectious. The hook on this is out of the dang world.  It\u2019s lovely and my only gripe about the song itself is that it\u2019s too short! I love how it\u2019s future sounding but yet throwbacky, it gives me the same vibes some Daft Punk songs do.\n\nThank you Jonghyun. We miss and love you. ",

The announcement for his album, teasers, video, all of it was so fast. It was so much more than I thought hitting me at one time, and I cried for a solid 10 minutes. I couldn't stop it for anything. \n\nEverything I hadn't been able to get out this last month, punched me right in the stomach at that moment.

Ever since the news came out I felt this brief feeling of absolute devistation before my emotional walls just completely came up to stop me from feeling all of the pain. \n\nI love him. I miss him. I'm so glad he was a part of my life. ",

Although it may only be a mask, Jonghyun gives me the vibes in this song like he did when I first heard him in Deja Vu. That was the Jonghyun I wanted to see. I hope he is able to shine on wherever he may be now.\n",

Wouldn't it be absolutely adorable to have a mini Jonghyun with you all the time just like in the MV? \ud83d\ude0a  \n  \nJonghyun was absolutely shining here, and I'm sure he's shining even brighter wherever he is now that his pain has ended. What a lovely parting gift, thank you. Rest in peace, Jonghyun. You did amazing.  \n  \nAlso irrelevant: I used to think he kept saying \"oh shit\" in She Is, and now here I am thinking he's saying \"bitch\" throughout the song (already know what it means, dw). \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 ",

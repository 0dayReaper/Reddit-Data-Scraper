Birth control pills aren't used as frequently because Korean women, like many women in East Asian countries, have a higher rate of using IUDs.\n\nThis thread and its misinformation is baffling.  \n\n\nSource: Korean woman, live in Korea and the US/Canada, worked with youth and adults in the medical field in both countries. I have family members who work in the medical field in all three countries. \n\n\nThe amount of \"teachers\" in Korea who think they're well-versed in Korean culture when they don't participate in Korean culture is hilarious to me.

The truth is usually a mesh of all of them. The prominent international communities tend to stay a bit apart because 99% are military or English teachers, so they can get stuck in their own circles repeating rumours.\n\nI've met people that have lived in Korea for 7+ years and don't speak the language.\n\nWhen it comes to Reddit, people also spread rumour so much. It seems legit until it's actually something you know, so it's easy to forget how wrong Reddit often is.",

I don\u2019t speak Korean so my friend told me what the conversation was about, but I can tell from Jongdae\u2019s body language and tone of voice that he is a genuinely nice guy. \n\nEdit: i didn\u2019t ask for autograph, was silent the whole time, but Jongdae came say thank you with a handshake.

I'm remembering this all now because this was in January 2017, when Suho went to LA for his break/vacation and there was also rumors that Chen was spotted in LA too, with his girlfriend visiting a bakery or something.\n\nAlso yeah the way you can find everything through a quick Google search this has been like a lowkey open secret for awhile now ahaha I'm not surprised he has a girlfriend, I'm just surprised he announced he's marrying her + they're having a baby!

SM Entertainment officially confirmed rumors that Chen\u2019s bride-to-be is pregnant.\n\nOn the 13th, an official from SM Entertainment told DongA Ilbo, \u201cEXO Chen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is pregnant. Due to the fact that she is not a celebrity, we ask for your understanding that details about the pregnancy will not be disclosed.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Confirmed by SM](https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=241&amp;aid=0002996571): On the 13th, SM Entertainment said, \u201cChen met his precious love and will get married. The bride is not a celebrity and the private wedding ceremony will only be attended by family members.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the families\u2019 wishes, the wedding ceremony and wedding will be private, so we ask for fans\u2019 and reporters\u2019 understanding. Chen will continue to work hard as an artist without change.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease give Chen your many blessings and congratulations.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslation:\n\n&gt;Hello. This is Chen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am writing this because I have something to say to fans.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although I am very nervous about how I should start this letter, I am posting this because I want to be honest to all the fans who have loved me a lot.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have a girlfriend with whom I want to spend the rest of my life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Though I had to consider what events may transpire after making this decision, I wanted to let my members, my company, and the supportive fans know early and had discussions with the company and the members.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;During this time, a blessing came to us.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Because this created a situation where I could not do some of the things that I planned on doing with the company and members, I was very taken aback. But this blessing gave me a lot of strength.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While I thought about when and how to tell everyone about this news, I thought I couldn\u2019t delay it any further and carefully gathered up my courage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am so thankful to the members who congratulated me upon hearing the news.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am also deeply thankful to all fans who loved me, even though I am still lacking and not deserving of it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I will never forget to be grateful, and I will show you a version of myself where I repay all the love and do my best to not change.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you always.",

I literally said \"What the fuck\" and stared blankly for a good 20 seconds. \n\nI'm not an EXO-L, but I support their songs and enjoy their (very rare) variety show appearances. I used to follow them very closely back when they were OT12, and mind you, I never thought that a member would marry someone at this point of their career (maybe a few years later still), but damn Chen proved me wrong.\n\nIdk how to explain it, but I feel very happy for him. Not a certain type of giddy excitement, but one that is rather calming and warm, akin to a thick blanket on a cold night. Something about this news and his statement in itself is very heartwarming.\n\nKudos to him for deciding to tell the fans in his own time (not having to be leaked to the press) and (although not always the best) to SM for actually allowing and supporting this. I know that it's not new to SM idols in general, but the fact that they support this (seemingly out of nowhere to fans) marriage is nice to see.\n\nI really really do hope that Chen's marriage will go as smoothly as possible and that the fans will take it well. I hope this isn't something that ends his career (unless ofc he wants to do so, but I somehow doubt it). \n\nAnyways, many blessings to the couple!!\n\nOmw to pray that fans will take this well!!",

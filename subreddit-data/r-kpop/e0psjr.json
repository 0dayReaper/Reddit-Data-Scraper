I heard that all of the members put their souls into their solo performances \\[at Mamamoo Concert 4 Season\u00a0F/W\\].\u201d\n\nHwasa said, \u201cFor me, I put my entire life into the performance. I put on a \u2018Hwasa Show.\u2019\u201d\n\nWheein said, \u201cI did a drum performance.\u201d\n\nSolar said, \u201cYou know how male idols rip their shirts off during performances? After I saw that, I thought, \u2018why can't female idols do the same? I want to do it too.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why I ripped my shirt into pieces after I did a cover of BTS\u2019s \u2018Fire.\u2019\u201d",

They were upset that their live performances of their hit song \"Up &amp; Down\" were either being censored or that they were forced to perform alternate choreography for it.\n\nThey got mad because the boy groups were doing far more risque moves on TV and they weren't censored; only girl groups were being censored that strictly.\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egqDPipqIAg) is the 'Ah Yeah' video and you can immediately see the censorship concept.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/cmKuGxb23z0?t=15) is a video of them performing \"Up &amp; Down\" and the choreography that was getting censored.",

I remember Kikwang also sported the one nipple look a lot when Beast were new.\n\nNot sure if this rule is still in effect though.",

Their CEO backed them up multiple times when there was backlash about outfits etc. They have so much freedom and trust - I mean, they were encouraged to make a song about being tired and irritable at a MV shoot and had to take a nap in the car lol\n\nNo way SM or JYP would let/encourage their main Girl Group to do this. And that is not a jab at RV or twice, it's just how giant companies work and function. So as much as mamamoo having better promotion and a bigger budget would be great, I think them being at rbw and knowing they have rbw's support is much more important",

This is the way it's supposed to be.\n\nThere was a lot of shitty fighting between male-dominated communities and female-dominated communities about this, however.\n\nIt was interesting to see because the male-dominated communities claim that the rabid female fans are jealous of Female K-pop idols while absolutely eating up the racy performances of Male K-pop idols. While the female-dominated communities claimed that the rabid male fans are so stuck up and conservative that the Female K-pop idols were held to a double standard and therefore they were not able to express themselves in this manner.\n\nAt this point I decided to not care about the infighting of these toxic fandoms, and the celebrities should do the same. You do you, Solar, please take care of your mental health and be free to express your self.",

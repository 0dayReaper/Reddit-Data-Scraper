I also wonder why the choice was made not to feature much choreo in the mv. There's bits of it in the second half and mostly at the end, but most of the mv is just members vibing. Which isn't a bad thing necessarily but I feel like songs are enhanced by choreo so I don't really like when it's not featured heavily in music videos, but *especially* so for Ph1harmony. I didn't really care for Do It Like This until I watched the mv and saw the addictive choreo and then I was hooked. I also felt like Back Down was elevated by the cool really difficult looking choreo. So maybe I'd have liked this song more if I got to see it with more snappy clever choreo, but anyway by itself I'm not really feeling it. I really like the verses and prechorus but I am not feeling a connection between the prechorus and the chorus at all, feels very disjointed to me.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad to see that it's being well received because I want P1h to do well! I'm hoping I like some of the bsides so I can justify buying one of the gorgeous album versions (seriously I love p1h's album designs so much).",

Obviously, there was some barking at TXT since they encourage it during \"Cat &amp; Dog\". But at Mamamoo, they were a little surprised by it at first (it was a little less than the other shows, but still quite obvious!) and then started to encourage it and do it themselves. So whatever it is at the root, the groups seem to get on board and make it a fun thing.",

When I saw TXT at the Hulu Theater at MSG last year it was obnoxious, at least for me. I was seated towards the back and that theater is SMALL and the ceiling in the back is LOW so the sound from the fans has no where to go. The barking was extremely excessive, done by fans who were competing with other fans in other sections trying to be louder, done while the members were speaking... It was really awful. And perhaps if it was just barking it would have been tolerable, but the same fans (and there were many) were beyond over the top. Unnecessary and inappropriate screaming and carrying on. It really impacted my experience, especially the last third of the concert. It was intrusive, disruptive and done for attention. It is the only time I have been frustrated with fan behavior at a kpop concert",

I think it can be disrespectful when done during talking or maybe during serious moments at concerts(moment like a member just gave a heartfelt speech idk), or if your intentions are to catcall or something, but overall? I don\u2019t think so... It\u2019s a way to be hype and have the whole crowd show their energy. \n\nJust don\u2019t do when the idol is trying to talk, but also don\u2019t scream or anything when they\u2019re talking, that\u2019s annoying asf too.",

It weirds me out a bit, especially barking at women, and the fact that barking at Asian folks is not uncommon racist behavior. It made it feel like not the greatest idea.  Sure, maybe it's a nod to 90s hip.hop culture, but I wonder how many kpop fans are really into that genre (or were hip hop fans in the 1990s). It wasn't my thing back then so I didn't go to hip hop shows, and  I can't remember hearing barking  at any of the concerts I did go to over the past 36 years.",

If you wouldn\u2019t do it on the street, then don\u2019t do it at a show. The group seemed to play off it, but it\u2019s difficult to know what a group likes in an industry that is all about pleasing the fans.\u201d\n\nLol, there's always gotta be that one sensitive Nancy who makes it about gender/race/etc. I imagine like with all Kpop concerts in the States that a large part of the audience, the majority, were female and yet he accuses it of feeling very \"bro/frat\" party atmosphere. Take a chill pill and let each culture cheer how they want to.\n\nJust watch this reaction of Mamamoo to the \"barking\": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YhUnQo1EgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YhUnQo1EgU) and tell me it gives off bro/frat party atmosphere vibes... Bruh, like 90% of their audience are likely women, and over 50% are probably LGBTQ. The opposite of a \"bro/frat party atmosphere\". \n\nI thought this woman nailed it:\n\n&gt;Bianca J., who attended that SuperM showcase, says it is a mixed bag. \u201cIn context, I actually really enjoy it. We\u2019re so used to screaming and yelling at concerts that collectively being able to join in on this type of chanting feels less expected, so more exciting. Similar to when everyone in the audience is able to participate in fan chants, and are comfortable doing so, it makes it more of a united feeling in the audience. It\u2019s less about the individual and their biases (people they like in the group) but more of a focus on the experience as a whole. I can definitely see how it could be embarrassing though if someone thought they were actually barking \u2013 so I can\u2019t fault those who are embarrassed by those actions.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bianca J. also attended, and has since heard the barking at other concerts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIt definitely started a murmur after the first round of barking of people\u2019s differing opinions,\u201d she tells UPROXX. \u201cI personally found it really funny and kind of fun to participate in. **I will say that the cheers are less formal \u2018barking\u2019 and more of an in-between barking and whooping.\u201d**\n\nI don't even go to concerts but just from listening to YouTube recordings of concerts, I absolutely prefer the \"barking\" over the screaming and the \"OMG \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (their bias) I LOVE YOU!!! LOOK AT ME!!!!\" which I find incredibly selfish, rude, annoying to my ears (screaming is very high pitched and yelling by women/girls is high pitched as well) and ruins the experience.

So I put my clown nose, wig and makeup on and woke up early on this fine easter sunday to watch 88rising's set live instead of sleeping in.\n\nRich bryan, jackson wang utada hikaru were already doing encore while CL still hasnt performed. There was also talk on twt yesterday about who could possibly close the 88 rising set. Money was on rich brian, jackson or cl. But a 2ne1 reunion would be more likely to happen if CL would get closing time. I was already at the edge of my seat.\n\nCL performed her 3rd song (she was amazing as always!) and I was already losing hope. I was expecting 2 songs from the possible 2ne1 reunion like MAMA2015 and I knew CL only had like 10-15 minutes. I happened to glance on the latest twts for \"2ne1\" and saw a video from someone in the coachella crowd that said 2ne1 was there. The youtube broadcast must have been delayed by a few minutes.\n\nWhen their sillhouettes appeared through the smoke, I just lost it and ugly cried.\n\nDara got the most massive version of her Vegeta hair. And minzy! I know she kinda resented being stuck with a short bob during their active days but she cut her hair for this. That sillhouette screamed iconic.\n\nWithout a doubt these women are a part of each other. And I am so lucky to be a fan of them! That crowd was lucky as well and I could only hope they understand how important that performance was. \n\nEdit: most people say minzy wore a wig. I really couldn't tell. Apologies. I gotta say tho that wig held onto dear life trying to stay on her head",

I was ready to wear the clown mask at some point. But *BOY* am I glad that it ended up being true. I kept screaming throughout the whole performance. Everything about it was so perfect. CL leading the energy. Minzy doing splits (and that clap with CL *omg*). Dara's iconic hair and her shoe flying off after a kick. And Bom looked nervous, but she did well (also CL comforting her when they were sitting *aww*). It's amazing how they've gone through so much and yet they sticked together through and through. Us Blackjacks are so blessed with their everlasting bonding and friendship/sisterhood. Not to mention how well fed we are this year with tons of content. Gosh, so proud of these ladies.",

Minzy was on *fire* and if 2NE1 had been allowed to last this long (I'll be forever bitter about this), we would surely have been in the Maknae's era.\n\nI've seen Dara in MC mode for so long that it was stunning to see that she hasn't lost her stage presence as an idol one bit and if anything added some earned mature swagger to her Forever Visual looks. I loved seeing her in rawk mode again.\n\nCL obviously has never stopped being CL, and Bom was definitely the odd woman out in terms of stage comfort -- poor girl has been through a LOT in the past several years -- but 2NE1 without OT4 isn't complete so I'm so thankful all four were able to make the secret trip to Indio for this legendary surprise.",

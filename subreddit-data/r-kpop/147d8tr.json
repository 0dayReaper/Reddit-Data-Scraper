This second mini album, I (Part.1), will be their first comeback in nine months.\n\n&gt; The agency stated, \u201cThis album will contain the group\u2019s storyline and message that they want to convey, and they have worked together to prepare for this, so please look forward to it.\u201d NINE.i, which debuted as a ten-member group last year, combines the three areas of \u201chumanities, idols, and IT.\u201d",

It's their \"third\"...\n\nUnless they're doing the MCND thing where their \"debut\" mini album is separate from their \"first\".\n\nAnd why does it say \"I (Part 1)\"? That one was already released...\n\nEdit: okay so after Twittering for a bit, it turns out the comeback on August is true. The official account posted a video captioned \"SOON\". It's just that the Koreaboo article is (unsurprisingly) terribly written. It's their first comeback AFTER their second mini album \"I (Part 1).\"",

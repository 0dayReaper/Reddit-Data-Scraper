My guess is that the compositing with the CGI was done in 1080 and upscaled back into 4k, or they used some real garbage codec when processing the 4k. The 4k DOES look noticeably different from the 1080 in a non-bitrate manner (some clearer lines for fine lines like thin shadows and hair although the higher bitrate makes more of a difference imo) but Youtube compression for 4k is fucking atrocious. I just hope that there's some way to get the MV in 4k without the Youtube compression.",

            "comment": "Not as girl crush or in your face as a lot of people probably hoped, but these synths are super delicious. They're keeping the TWICE! shout, and the chorus is suitably cheeky and playful. The verses are much more intense though, and quite a bit darker than their past work. I really like them. This is an evolution in the same way that I'm So Sick was, and it has a bit of the same melancholy feel, which is a nice touch. But it's still fun and bright overall. It's pretty dang good, I love songs with a mischievous feel like this. \n\nI give this 1700 heavy tracked construction vehicles out of 1944.\n\nEDIT: As far the as the MV goes, did they make Chaeng the main character here? She appears so much and I wholeheartedly support this development. She has the best outfits too. Those close ups were amazing. Also it's interesting how the song sounds so sad just before and during the rollercoaster part of the MV (the breakdown). I love it when K-pop songs do this, the juxtaposition between a bright image but a sad sound.",

                    "comment": "I think what it's interesting about Fancy is how similar it is concept-wise to their sister group's recent release in Dalla Dalla, yet how different it is music-wise. I remember discussion surrounding how Twice could ever evolve to more mature concepts if ITZY was already doing that, and I think this was a near-perfect answer: you can have similar concepts if you make the music very distinctive.\n\nIn addition to Dalla Dalla, I think the MV has some hints of more retro-sultry pop, ala Bon Bon Chocolat (I've compared a lot of things to BBC haha, but I feel like this analogy holds). It wasn't really girl crush to me, but it was still very different. Felt like 2012 American pop with a Twice dash.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the song, I think it's good, but I was really expecting an ad-lib-stuffed third chorus and was disappointed we didn't get that. The chorus as it was didn't really suit an ending to a song, and if not ad-libs I think some more melancholic synths or double-beats / hard bass drops would have made it feel like a better ending, because the chorus feels distinctively like a \"middle\". I also wish the drops were more intense: I felt like the lead-in to the chorus could have been more drastic / emphasized, especially considering their past title tracks like Yes or Yes / Dance The Night Away that have very distinctive drops that separate the chorus and pre-chorus. I think the most different thing they tried musically with this song was de-emphasizing the drops, and while I commend them for taking a new approach I'm not quite sure it worked.\n\nAnd this is the coldest take ever, but Chaeyoung was the star of the MV no question.\n\nOverall, I give it a 7/10. I would put it above Dalla Dalla and on-par with Yes or Yes.",

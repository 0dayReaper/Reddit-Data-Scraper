OP says \"Twice sold out SoFi!\" and other people are saying \"yes, we knew that two months ago.\"  How is that downplaying anything?  It's acknowledging the exact same thing.\n\nAnd the thing is, people are projecting their own biases onto those comments.  I have no doubt people think I'm some Twice anti because of this.  But go ahead and look at the comments I made in the thread two months ago.  Go ahead and look at my post history.  I love Twice.  I just wish people could disagree about things without getting so angry.",

I literally do not understand why everyone is being so aggressive about this.  People mention that we knew this two months ago, providing sources that say it sold out two months ago, and fellow \"fans\" start attacking and arguing with them.\n\n\"my tone\" is one of explaining facts.  I'm sorry if news posted two months ago means that it's not new information today.  I can't change the way time or facts work.  I'm getting attacked for pointing this out, so please focus on the tone other users are using instead.",

The parent comment here simply said we've known this for two months, which is innocent enough.  There's no blame or criticism or negative tone at all.  Which is why it's so frustrating that it received the response it did.  In what world is simply pointing out that this is old news worthy of such animosity and scorn?  Why does saying \"we've known this for two months\" make some people so angry?\n\nIf I'm getting \"bent out of shape,\" it's from \"fans\" who are more interested in starting shit and egging on a flame war because of some \"news\" that is two months old.  I don't give a crap about the old news nearly as much as I care about \"fans\" attacking other fans for completely pointless reasons.  We're all supposed to be fans of the same thing, and starting fights and dragging in this toxic behavior over a simple misunderstanding is unfortunate.",

It's mine as well since it hooks nicely into Discord where other people can see what you're currently listening to (Similar to MSN Messenger back in the 2000s) and [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Freeasacar) where it scrobbles all the tracks you listen to so that you can keep a record of them and compare your tastes with others.",

LOONA has completed their AMA!!!**\n\nThank you to LOONA for answering so many questions (a new record!) and having a great time with us!\n\nAnd thank you to all the Orbits and fans who participated and showed LOONA such great support!\n\nLet's all look forward to the comeback and cheer for these ladies!\n\n**[Link to LOONA's farewell comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/o6vu0a/hello_we_are_loona_welcome_to_our_first_ama/h2vjhqt/)**\n\n***\n\n* Upvote the questions you like.\n* r/kpop's [conduct rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/rules#wiki_section_ii_-_conduct_rules) will be enforced by moderators. Report rule breaking questions/comments if you see them.\n* Protect your privacy. Don't share personal information.\n\n**NOTE:** Most of LOONA's answers are fully in Korean.

Thank you for your patience! Shout-out to the volunteer translators who are helping out!\n\n**TRANSLATIONS UPDATE:**\n\nTeam Subbits has been diligently working on a compilation of all the questions and answers that LOONA responded to in a Google Doc.\n\nYou can find them on Twitter [@gointosubbit](https://twitter.com/gointosubbit) or on their website: www.teamsubbits.com\n\n[Here](https://twitter.com/gointosubbit/status/1408365882330554369) is where they tweeted the link.\n\n&gt; **[DIRECT GOOGLE DOC LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJ9vJSg3axvNVancfzkgU4frw4IAuj63lOzVZ8BIijM/edit#gid=0)**\n\nThrow a thank you their way if you check out their translations!\n\n---\n\nRemember to follow r/kpop on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/redditkpop) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/redditkpop).

First, I want to thank you for doing this, this is an opportunity that I'm sure many fans here have been waiting for!\n\nThis is gonna be kind of a long one. I wanted to have questions directed to specific members as well as the entire group, so feel free to pick and choose which questions you want to answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo **LOONA** overall:\n\n* How have you handled this pandemic so far? Any new hobbies that you've picked up or explored?\n* From the perspective of idols within the industry, how has the industry changed in response to the pandemic? Any changes that might not be immediately noticeable to fans just watching performances and listening in to Vlives?\n* You've mentioned before that you'd like to go on a tour. What places would you like to go to as part of a tour?\n* (To any member): Have you ever entertained the idea of \"re-doing\" your pre-debut solo songs? What changes to the song style or concept would you consider, if any?\n* (To any member): From pre-debut to today, you've accomplished *so*. *much*. What has been your favorite, or most memorable, achievement so far?\n* (To any member): Of all the song/dance covers you've done, which is your favorite? What songs would you like to cover in the future?\n\nTo **Heejin**:\n\n* As the first member of the group to be revealed, you've gone on a long journey to reach this point. Did you ever imagine that you, and eventually the group, would become as popular as you are now?\n\nTo **Hyunjin**:\n\n* *Aeong*\n* You were also one of the first members to be revealed as part of LOONA! Looking back, what has been the most memorable moment of your career to you?\n\nTo **Haseul**:\n\n* I'm so happy to see you back with the rest of the group again!\n* You've often mentioned your love for singing - if you were to add another solo song (or a few) to your repertoire, what song style(s) would you like to try?\n\nTo **Yeojin**:\n\n* HARD agree with your thoughts on milk not helping you grow.\n* I've always been curious about this - between *1/3*, *Odd Eye Circle*, and *yyxy*, which subunit would you like to be in? Which subunit do you think fits you the best?\n* Alternatively, if you were to form your own subunit, what kind of subunit concept would you like to have? Which of the members would you like to join you?\n\nTo **Vivi**:\n\n* As part of *LOONA 1/3*, you traveled around a lot. Of the places you've visited throughout your life, what has been your favorite? Where would you like to travel next, if you had the opportunity?\n\nTo **Kim Lip**:\n\n* You mentioned before that you played the violin when you were younger. Any chance we might see that in the future?\n* Are there any other musical instruments you'd like to learn?\n\nTo **Jinsoul**:\n\n* You've expressed a lot of interest in music production and composing, and you've mentioned that you've been learning and practicing those skills, as well. As you develop the idea for a song, what inspires you?\n\nTo **Choerry**:\n\n* You've had a hand in developing the choreography for some of LOONA's songs. What inspires you when you design your own choreography? What style of dance do you like the most?\n\nTo **Yves**:\n\n* Many individuals who you've interviewed with have highlighted you as incredibly well-spoken. Did you have any kind of speaking experience (like debate) before you joined LOONA?\n* You've also expressed interest in learning English (and your English is really good!) Besides English, are there other languages you'd be interested in learning?\n\nTo **Chuu**:\n\n* You're known as a gifted singer, performer, and rising variety star, with your own YouTube show! Are there any current variety shows you would be interested in joining as a guest?\n* Are there any artists you would like to collab with?\n\nTo **Gowon**:\n\n* You've made it known that you're a big *Oh My Girl* fan. What kind of music do you like to listen to? Does the kind of music you like to listen to change based on your mood?\n\nTo **Olivia Hye**:\n\n* You've expressed a lot of interest in video games. Besides *League of Legends*, what games do you like to play the most? What type of games do you enjoy playing?\n* Thoughts on streaming in your free time?",

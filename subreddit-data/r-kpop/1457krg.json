I actually think it elevated the song even more for me. this is coming from the same director as Onew's Circle MV, who also [posted this](https://twitter.com/shineeinstagram/status/1667102958163750912?s=46&amp;t=FHv1SV0w_Iv4Mg2z7uBtng) after the announcement regarding Onew's hiatus.\n\nalso C'MON DnB(N)ee!!!!! I know nothing about audio engineering/music production but this sounded especially.. clear? crisp? to my ears, which says a lot coming from a YouTube video.\n\nKey looked *especially* good in this, I just love it when his hair is styled like that. ~~also he ate up every outfit.~~ I would also like to find out just how many apples he consumed in the making of this video lol that's one part of the video I don't really get.\n\nalthough this is quite a bittersweet release, 15 years is still a long ass time and not an easy feat. happy belated 15th anniversary!! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",

Happy 15th Anniversary!!!\n\nAfter Jjong's passing it was so hard for me to listen to SHINee's music. For the longest time, I couldn't bring myself to even listen to the post-2017 releases. However, the fact that the 4 members rallied and have continued to create amazing art together and individually while always honouring Jonghyun's memory has brought me some comfort and given me strength to finally go through their discography again. \n\nThe Feeling is an amazing song full of hope and reflection and of the 3 SM groups that have had 15th anniversary comebacks in the last 3 years I think this anniversary song truly is the best of the lot (I still love you Suju and SNSD &lt;3).

The instrumental especially in the chorus and post-chorus is exactly what I want, I love it! From the time I saw the fancam of them performing it, I've just been so happy that this serotonin boost is here again. \n\nI also love an MV with outdoor shots, they all look gorgeous as always and some of the scenes remind me of some of their other MVs like Boys Meet U in particular? Maybe it's the beach scene, which is really pretty.",

The fact that it's been *15* years since SHINee debuted, the way I'm so proud of SHINee, and the bittersweet feelings especially after hearing about Onew\n\nBut the Drum and Bass though! The MV aesthetics! The members themselves! The harmonies and melodies that SHINee is so famous for! The way that we can still feel Jonghyun's presence with us! Everything and more just shows why SHINee is and will always be one of my favorite groups of all time. \n\nWhat a way to celebrate 15 whole years SHINee! This just makes me even more excited for their upcoming album",

I was very certain I wouldn't like this song at all. Totally the opposite now that I can actually **hear** the music. This is SO good. \n\nMusic aside, they all look great in the video, and you can tell they had fun together. What's with all those delicious apples not being finished??? Lol, I sat there like NO, finish it, Key!\n\nIdk about anyone else, but for me, pleated SKIRTNee is super cute, lol.",

Their vocals also sound weirdly mixed ?\n\nI know it's a fan song so a song review feels weird but I'm confused by what those 2 usually excellent producers have released. I'm a fan of Shinee because of their music after all.",

            "comment": "It's so rare for Daniel to talk about his work as CEO of Konnect that I almost couldn't believe what I was reading.\n\nThat said, I've been waiting for an interview like this. I always love reading about how he conceptualises his albums and the process of writing lyrics to his songs.\n\n&gt;The album is about the process of realizing the truth hidden in lies on the theme of a dystopian world in a cinematic form. There are a total five songs, including \u201cWasteland,\u201d in this album and it\u2019s a story of gaining enlightenment through uncovering truth from lies and a story about the realization to face our whole self. Depending on the listener, different endings can be imagined, so, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\n\nMe too Daniel, me too. Only 10 more days!",

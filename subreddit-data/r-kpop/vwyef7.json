I think most of the members is going to get solo albums as part of their contract renewal (and the members actually started their own Instagram account after the end of the US encore tour shown me that Park Jin-young is letting them loose a bit).  \n\n\nPlus Twice is currently the most senior group within the JYP (next oldest is Stray Kids after the unsuccessful contract extension of GOT7) and also JYP money maker",

            "comment": "edit: A quote from JYPE: [\"All members of TWICE have renewed their contracts ahead of their contract expiration this fall. TWICE played a decisive role in JYP's status as an entertainment company and have grown as a K-pop representative girl group, and they have agreed to renew with JYP, who has been a strong supporter, with confidence to develop a better future based on this trust.\"](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/now/article/011/0004075200)\n\n~~Translation in progress, I am eating at the same time because I didn't expect this to come out today at all lol~~ done ish.\n\n&gt;\tThe group TWICE has renewed their contracts with JYP Entertainment. All members have continued their relationship [with the company] as they renewed their contracts that were about to expire this fall. \n\n&gt;\tTWICE debuted in October 2015 and have since won many awards at various award shows, and recorded over 10 million Korean and Japanese album sales, while also being the fastest foreign artist to perform at Tokyo Dome after debut. Additionally, their 3rd full album placed 3rd on the Billboard 200. They have 20 music videos over 100 million views which is the most for any girl group in the world.\n\n&gt;\tTWICE performed in American stadiums for their TWICE 4TH WORLD TOUR \u2019\u2162\u2018 US tour, being the first K-pop girl group to do so, performing in 5 American cities with 9 sold out concerts, including 2 encore concerts, attracting an audience of 150 thousand people. They also sold out 3 consecutive concerts at the Tokyo Dome, proving their strong popularity. \n\n&gt;\tMeanwhile, member Nayeon released her first solo mini album IM NAYEON last month on the 24th, being the first TWICE member to release a solo. She charted 7th on Billboard 200, being the first Korean soloist to reach top 10 on said chart.\n\nAs a ONCE, this is great news. I was ready to accept if they wanted to move on because they've done so much as a group already, but more TWICE makes my heart happy. Hope more members get their solos/other ventures soon!!\n\nedit: thanks to the commenters below for correcting my translations \u3160\u3160 if there's any other mistakes let me know, this translation was admittedly rushed",

I think if you (not you specifically - just in general) weren't following TWICE, you'd find it suspicious that she was just going in and out of the group.\n\nBut all the members (and fans of course) have been super supportive of her. It's not an easy injury to get over or fight through. \n\nIf she had decided not to renew for her own health, I think every single person would've understood. \n\nBut I really respect her for continuing her career as an idol.

JYP really seemed to do all they can to sweeten the pot to incentivize them to stay.  From them getting their own IG accounts to Nayeon's successful solo debut, JYP did them right to really encourage them to stay.\n\nAlso it's beautiful that all 9 chose to stay together.  I'm pretty new to Twice but one of the things I got from them right away is that they're very OT All which you just love to see.\n\nOverall great news.  I was starting to get into Twice just when rumors of their contracts started surfacing and it just made me wary.  Now I can definitely continue with little issues to worry about.\n\nJYPE has been having an amazing year so far.  They were able to debut a new group with NMixx.  Their 3 most popular groups (Twice, Stray Kids, and ITZY) have signed had, are in the middle of, and will have a tour this year.  Nayeon has gotten a solo debut  Stray Kids have had a really good comeback with Maniac/Oddinary.  ITZY is really getting a lot of good buzz with Checkmate.  Biggest thing is this contract renewal for sure though but yeah.  JYP is killing it this year.",

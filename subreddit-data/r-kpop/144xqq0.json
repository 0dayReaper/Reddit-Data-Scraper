It's great to finally have a confirmed date, but I'd be lying if I said that I'm not nervous about how the promotions will go with the lawsuit going on. The entire situation is a little bit bizarre and I don't trust sm, especially with their gross media play fuckery about cbx.",

The boys have been talking about the comeback since the beginning of the year,especially baekhyun even on the day the lawsuit dropped. I think we should support the boys. This maybe the last OT8 comeback. They have worked really hard for this. If the comeback does not do well SM will blame CBX for this. Whether this is the last comeback or no both the boys and fans have been waiting for this since 2018 ,this is even before the pandemic, so we should allow our selves to enjoy the work they put out, since SM will already trouble us with other things",

Whereas Loona's comeback was just pieced together at the last moment by BBC as the last cash grab.\n\nAlso this might be the last comeback for a while with EXO, so most fans are excited. Although a lot of them like me are conflicted about it, the boys have themselves been excited about this album even Baekhyun (even while they were contemplating with going ahead with the lawsuit), so for now I think we can be happy about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to Add: Also with Loona, a big reason for the boycott was not because they wanted the comeback to flop but more that it to cancel as it would have put the girls in more debt.",

Boycotts only work when it affects the company\u2019s pockets and has a specific outcome. There is no specific outcome fans can affect with regards to CBX and an EXO boycott won\u2019t effect it enough to change anything; we would need every single SM fanbase to boycott with us.\n\nBut more importantly, the members themselves have been excited for the comeback. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, but they do, and if they want the comeback to happen then I don\u2019t see a reason not to support it. CBX have said from the beginning of this all that they don\u2019t want to leave the group nor be absent from comeback activities. Why would I presume to know better than the actual artist?",

Are you saying the problem is that exo-ls will believe the company narrative while orbits will believe the artists?

They and the rest of the group have been hyping the comeback right until the news came out. I trust they knew what they were doing with this. That doesn't mean fans can't feel conflicted about the comeback, of course, but EXO going ahead with it is hardly shocking. We know CBX don't want to leave the group, anyway, and also that SM will blame it on those three if the album underperforms.",

SM kept claiming they could look at that info but not bring it anywhere like to an accountant to examine, which is against the terms of the contract, so CBX announced their contracts with SM are terminated as of June 1 as a result of SM\u2019s failure to hand them over. They also filed a complaint with the government that SM\u2019s violating contract law, which is being looked into.",

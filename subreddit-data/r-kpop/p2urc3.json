I feel for him, but dude banded with a bunch of other guys to purchase massive amounts of marijuana (which he paid an absolute shit load for). Plus he got a harsher punishment because he used crypto to purposely try and evade the police. \n\nI understand SK's laws are outdated and that weed is generally harmless. But if you conspire with multiple people to evade the law and purchase a large amount of illegal substances, and you've been doing it for years, you're gonna get the fucking hammer dropped on you, especially on a case this public.\n\nAll three crimes Ilhoon and Seungri got charged with (weed, gambling, prostitution) would've probably just gotten a warning if done once. But they committed these vices in massive amounts and because they're in the public eye they got a jail sentence.",

In my opinion, it began from the creation of Big Bang - he was added at the very last minute to the group and even then Yang Hyun Suk wasn't exactly convinced of his talents. GD too couldn't stand Seungri because GD had been training for years with Taeyang and Seungri, a bratty dongsaeng, swooped right in to take the final spot.  But Seungri quickly realised he had to learn to get along because GD was not only the leader, but extremely well liked by the public. Even though his relationship with GD improved over the years, with GD \"controlling\" him as a hyung, it seemed like the tension never quite went away. \n\nI'll be honest. I used to pity him because it seemed that he would always be in the shadow of his much more talented members regardless of how hardworking he was. There was no way he could become an artist like GD/TOP/TY because his artistry just wasn't there. Which was why I was happy for him when he first started venturing into his ramen business. It seemed like he was finally re-channeling his work ethic into something he could actually be good at. But of course, he had to go and blow it by trying to take the easier but sleazier route of fast money, little ethics.\n\nI began noticing around the MADE era that GD would be quite snappy or snarky around Seungri even on camera, which reminded me of their trainee/debut days and made me realise something was off fundamentally in their team. Then TOP himself said on TV that he was worried about Seungri's circle of acquaintances, whom he said did not seem to have his best interests. This was aired around the time Seungri began his whole Gatsby nonsense, which was also when he began to work with Yang Hyun Suk business-wise. This was when my opinion quickly plummeted. It was becoming extremely clear that he was inflating his ego by presenting himself like a self-made business mogul, though all he was doing was throwing unnecessarily extravagant (&amp; very public) parties and bringing in known male celebrities and unknown attractive girls for publicity. \n\nSeungri is a perfect case of the terrible things that can transpire when you let greed get the better of you. He's a cautionary tale. It baffles me that he couldn't see that he already had all the money he needed as a Big Bang member. He just wanted to outdo his members and finally be recognised by the public. For some time he did get the recognition he was long craving for but clearly, nothing was ever going to be *enough* to satisfy him. And now he's made his bed and has to lie in it, in prison. Good luck to him.",

And if your CEO is this shady, you're bound to learn a few things, especially of you were as young as Seungri when you meet the dude. Again, I'm not excusing his actions, just making a comment.",

YG admitted to not giving any attention to Seungri up until he started his businesses.  \nYG typically has favorites in the groups that he makes but the none of the other groups\u2019 members resort to criminal activity; they\u2019re satisfied with where they\u2019re at. I think what Seungri\u2019s problem was that because he was not given any attention, he craved it even more and did whatever to get accepted by him. There\u2019s a video of Seungri literally crying when YG celebrated his birthday for the first time in like 15 years. He hated being in the back of his super talented members but instead of bettering himself musically, he went to a wrong path to gain acceptance, which is honestly quite sad. (I am not trying to make any excuses for him)",

            "comment": "Saw this sentencing would be coming. I'm still recovering from my 2nd Pfizer jab, but this was the first thing I checked when I woke up.\n\nHaving followed this article by article every step of the way and working on our sub's Burning Molka Megathreads from the beginning, I'll leave some of my thoughts here.\n\nThis is a higher sentence than I expected. I thought 2 years would be the absolute maximum and expected something more like 1 year with some extra fines and community service. I'd guess that means there was stronger evidence presented in the trials for some things than what was known through public reporting, which is pretty interesting and I'll be looking for that detail as more information comes out now.\n\nI will say there is a lot of misunderstanding about Seungri's case. People have very extreme perspectives about him, which I think has a lot to do with folks basing their opinion on headlines and not following it thoroughly. Understandable, but a little frustrating.\n\nThe length of the trial process is something I see being talking about as something conspiratorial. It always made perfect sense to me. Seungri had way more charges and varying investigations going on than other people involved in the tangle of Burning Molka.\n\nThe Molka Chat group had simpler cases, but much more grievous in terms of direct harm to other people along with hard evidence to back that up. That's why those sentences happened more quickly.\n\nI want to make this clear. Seungri was never accused of any violent crimes. No sexual assault/rape. His stack of alleged crimes were primarily business/money related like tax evasion, embezzlement, gambling, etc. The only ones sexually related were for prostitution and a possible molka picture, but I believe that was left undetermined and likely to be just a picture off the internet. A lot of these charges are trickier to investigate since transactions can be very off-the-books, but clearly enough was found here to find him guilty.\n\nThe money crimes are why I believed he wouldn't get significantly harsh sentencing, but 3 years plus fines seems quite justified to me, all things considered with how the system works and other cases went.\n\nI'd guess there might be an appeal process? The sentence could end up a little shorter eventually. We'll see, I guess. Glad to see some closure finally, or the start of it at least.\n\n***\n\nSome are asking about the specific 9 charges. The wording can be a little difficult to parse, so I had tried to clarify them in our [most recent Burning Molka Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/j0nafp/burning_molka_34_final_sentencing_for_molka_chat/). Making some quick adjustments for the 9th charge. I'll copy that text here with edits for more clarity and include the 9th:\n\n&gt; For a quick review, the [Soompi article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1425728wpp/seungri-admits-to-1-of-8-charges-at-first-hearing) specifies all eight charges and Seungri\u2019s defense for most of them, presented by his lawyer. A defense for the embezzlement ones isn\u2019t mentioned. (Mod note: Heavily paraphrasing for brevity. Check the article for more detail.)\n\n1. **Purchase of prostitution services** - *Defense: Admitted to an encounter. Didn\u2019t recall having sex with the specific woman and/or didn\u2019t know she was a prostitute*\n2. **Prostitution mediation (Hiring prostitutes for other people)** -  *Defense: Yoo In Suk handled mediation (also pleaded guilty) and Seungri wasn\u2019t involved*\n3. **Embezzlement**\n4. **Violation of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment, etc. of Specific Economic Crimes (Embezzlement under specific circumstances)**\n5. **Violation of the Food Sanitation Act (Method of Tax Evasion)** ([2019 Soompi article for reference](https://www.soompi.com/article/1311808wpp/seungri-admits-knowledge-of-illegal-operations-of-club-monkey-museum)) - *Defense: Seungri was overseas and not involved in direct decision-making and the registration problems were corrected by those who were*\n6. **Habitual gambling** - *Defense: Gambling was not the purpose of his visits to the US. He was there for work and completed his schedules*\n7. **Violation of the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act (Gambling related)** - *Admitted guilt*\n8. **Violation of the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes (Sharing pornographic image)** - *Defense: Seungri didn't take explicit photos himself, he re-shared them from an adult entertainment establishment with a group chat*\n9.  **Special Violence Instigation** - ([2021 Soompi article for reference](https://www.soompi.com/article/1448700wpp/seungri-and-yoo-in-suk-indicted-on-additional-charge-regarding-violence-instigation)) Along with Yoo In Suk, urged a gang member to threaten club customers they were in an argument with.\n\nThe 9th charge was included when more information was uncovered during the trial process in military court (7th hearing).",

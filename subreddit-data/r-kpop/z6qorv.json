Or maybe the members saw the support Chuu got and it finally gave them confident to leave.\n\nEither way, I hope LOONA\u2019s lawsuit is successful and they can all leave.  \n\nI\u2019m curious about Hyunjin and Vivi not joining in the lawsuit especially Hyunjin who has been the most outspoken.

            "comment": "- Translation incoming\n\nOn 28th of November, According to a JTBC News report, LOONA Heejin, Haseul, Yeojin, Kim Lip, Jinsoul, Choerry, Yves, Gowon, and Olivia Hye (except for Hyunjin and Vivi) recently filed an injunction against their agency Blockberry Creative to suspend the exclusive contract. \n\nIt was confirmed that the 9 members came to a collective decision upon learning that their mutual trust with company (Blockberry Creative), which is the premise of the contract they had signed, had been broken. The collapse in the initial agreement will make it difficult for the members and the management to work with each other based on mutual trust and cooperation. \n\nBlockBerry Creative has subsequently denied this report stating \u2018No\u2019. to JTBC but this is an extension of their simple and halfhearted response to previous reports of former member Chuu setting up her own company.\n\nFormer LOONA Chuu filed an injuction against BlockBerry Creative last December (2021) in an attempt to suspend her exclusive contract with the company and since has been in charge of her own personal schedules and activities. \n\nThere is a discrepancy in the information surrounding LOONA\u2019s contracts. It was initially believed that the members first signed their contracts consecutively after being revealed as \u2018Girl of the Month\u2019 in sequence, whereby each member would have a different start and end date. However, JTBC reports that their contracts are based on their full group debut which coincides with the release of their first mini album [+ +]. If all 9 members win the injunction, then LOONA will be unable to carry out group activities in the future, and a disbandment will effectively proceed.\n\nA funding crisis in BlockBerry Creative has also been reported. The problem raised: the company has refused to financially compensate foreign companies and third party staff who worked with them last year. In addition, LOONA\u2019s most active member in term of external schedules, Chuu, has also not been paid. The agency has decided to not comment on this issue.\n\nPreviously, Blockberry Creative announced on the 25th of November that they have decided to expel Chuu from LOONA and that the group would continue with 11 members. However, the rift between the agency and the remaining LOONA members is only said to be growing deeper.",

What you're doing is no different than a hobby at that point, except you're slaving away for someone else's benefit. On the other hand, these girls have sacrificed so much to get where they are. Everyone knows about their pre-debut project but the competition to become a LOONA member was so fierce. Members like Heejin and Hyunjin also had to wait years before \"LOONA\" as a whole could finally debut, on top of their trainee time. But ALL of them worked so hard and I'm so frustrated for them. I can't imagine how heartbreaking it must be to have to knowingly walk away from the dream they had worked so hard for. \n\nIt's going to be a tough road ahead of them but hoping for all the best for the members.",

I agree with others that hyunjin will join the others in the suit as soon as her show is done but vivi is in a really tough spot if she sues she likely has to go home and will likely not get another work visa.

That means her presence in South Korea is linked to her employment at BBC. Should that contract be terminated she'd lose her visa status and basically would have to leave the country unless she can find an alternative.

I'd definitely miss new LOONA releases, but the one thing that comforts me is knowing I'll always be able to enjoy the music they were able to release.\n\nBBC seriously fucked up something that could've been so special.

The 2nd gen &amp; 3rd gen was where the slew of lawsuits started - looking at SM's shady ass - how do you get sued by almost every Chinese idol in your roster &amp; almost lose one of your biggest groups?? (Lose one of biggest group refers to SuJu threatening to leave SM during contract renewals - thats where label SJ came from). Now we are in the 4th gen and this solidarity is beautiful. \n\nGood luck to Loona, to Omega-X and to Lee Seung Gi \ud83d\ude4f",

Maybe she has something big up her sleeve. Because she needs to ditch this joint too! Vivi is maybe hampered by her foreign citizenship? I'm rooting for the girls. All twelve signed together under a new company, maybe Chuu's personal company. More artist controlled K-pop companies is what this industry needs.",

I especially love the chorus and outro so much, they come in so nicely. everyone sounds doubly good after their solo projects. it\u2019s like a teaser of the super powered up avengers they will be once they all return together. and me personally? I can\u2019t wait for that. \n\nI just missed hearing them together so much I didn\u2019t even know. thank u for the gift bangtan!! we will patiently wait for you \ud83d\udc9c",

The rappers get around the same time single verses than they split one verse amongst all three with each saying one line. YTC was much more rap forward I think.\n\nThus I think across the 3 of them they probably got around the same time and the vocalist got around the same time. \n\nI am glad they went with a long track though! The shorter songs have been such a struggle to fit everyone in!",

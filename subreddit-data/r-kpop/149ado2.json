In the strangest circumstances as well.\n\n2013 and the local Korean Culture office in Australia had organised a Kpop cover dance contest to promote Hallyu etc. Somehow they invited 4 Minute as the judges! \n\nIt was wild seeing them perform Volume Up and What's Your Name at my university (UNSW Sir John Clancy Auditorium for those in Sydney), esp when I had lectures in the same hall a few days before.",

GRATS! GRATS!*\n\n\n***\n\nFolks from r/all, hello! Welcome to r/kpop!\n\nDreamcatcher is a girl group that debuted in January of 2017 with a distinctive rock sound and paranormal/occult aesthetic that set them apart from their peers. K-Pop groups compete in 'music shows' every week. Winning a music show for the first time is a big deal, especially for artists that don't come from major labels. Dreamcatcher has been steadily releasing great music and performing, but always too unlucky with timing or circumstances to get their first.\n\nAfter 5 years (8 for some members of the group who debuted previously in MINX), they just got their 1st win and both Dreamcatcher fans (InSomnia) and the general K-Pop community are all celebrating with them because they are well-respected performers and it has been such a long time coming!\n\nCheck out some Dreamcatcher music videos if you're curious!\n\n* [Chase Me](https://youtu.be/zihoyz0u_cs) (Debut)\n* [GOOD NIGHT](https://youtu.be/Lxfl8LRab_I)\n* [YOU &amp; I](https://youtu.be/LFxjwBfFIiY)\n* [Scream](https://youtu.be/FKlGHHhTOsQ)\n* [ODD EYE](https://youtu.be/1QD0FeZyDtQ)\n* [MAISON](https://youtu.be/z4t9LLq1Nk0) (1st win!)\n\nYou can also check out their dedicated subreddit r/dreamcatcher which you may have seen represented [on r/place this year](https://i.imgur.com/7IEiyW1.png)!\n\nHere's a link to [Dreamcatcher's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/m64bt8/hello_we_are_dreamcatcher_come_join_our_first_ama/?sort=qa) from about a year ago.\n\nCredit to [insomnicsy_\uc778\uc378\ub2c9\uc528](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQR1c2i-itLgykF20mV9Qaw) on YouTube for these fan-made videos providing context and subtitles:\n\n* [DREAMCATCHER 1ST WIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ov5Kl0vX-Y) (DC's wishes to win in their own words over time.)\n\n* [dreamcatcher on their 1st win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi6bF5BjKds) (Subtitled highlights from the VLIVE linked above.)",

You didn't need to prove anything but you did.\n\nI'm just so ridiculously happy for them and proud of them at once. Rejoice, all my fellow Somnias. It's worth celebrating with them, celebrating for them and just celebrating the Seven, who make the music we love.\n\nFight for us? You did, I did, we did...and this time, we won. \ud83c\udfc6",

Its better to be the only one doing a niche than the 100th doing the same thing as others with 100x the budget and connections.  Its paid off bigtime. They had the metalheads who also like kpop audience immediately,  as well as anyone who is into the overall darker aesthetics and vibes.

I ended up having a small sliver of mental preparation at the back of my head that they might  never get a win due to some whatever reason each time, and this will just go into books as one of the greatest travesty or curses in kpop, but I'm glad that is not the case. So yeah, what a great long journey this was",

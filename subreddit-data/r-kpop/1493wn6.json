            "comment": "So this is the first I have seen (in the comments here) about the channels name being changed and the possibility of no Sakura going forward. After doing some research, as usual, it seems like K-pop fans are being irrational and overreactive. \n\nFirst off, if you think Sakura has the time all year to shoot non HYBE content, you're delusional. She will likely have a bunch of times in which she is too busy to be apart of an ongoing series. Comebacks, concert tours and so on. That matters because maybe SHE is the one that can't be available right away for season 2. \n\nSecondly, if you think Sakura or more aptly HYBE didn't already have a contract and terms with the studio who made this content, then you're delusional. What's happening is most likely not a shock or a blindsiding of Sakura or HYBE. They likely went into it with one season in mind with the possibility of more but because of her schedule they couldn't guarantee it. This is likely NOT a Jessi Showterview situation where Jessi assumes the show will end with her retiring from it but the studio rebrands, hires a new host, renames it and she was never informed (which she doesn't need to be, unless you're being courteous). \n\nLastly, and most importantly, actually read their Community post ([here's an ENG translated version](https://twitter.com/sakura_chart/status/1668929025488850945)). I'll break down what is most likely actually happening: \n\n1. Sakura isn't available right away for a season 2 of Fearless with Kkura. \n2. The channel was very successful with nearly 500k subscribers\n3. The studio making the channel doesn't want to go inactive until Kkura's schedule has time again for shooting. If they remain idle the studio has to find different work, a different channel, lose employees or the like. \n4. So, they make the channel non-person-specific so they can debut different shows with different concepts and hosts. \n5. They specifically mention that they will be waiting for Kkura for season two of Fearless with Kkura. \n\nSo, what does this mean? It means eventually we'll get 'Fearless with Kkura' season 2, when Sakura is free to sign on for a season 2 and shoot it. In the mean time the studio will make new content on the channel to keep it active and making money. \n\nThis seems like a giant win-win to me. Kkura season 2 will eventually happen and in the meantime we will get more content from what seems to be a solid studio.",

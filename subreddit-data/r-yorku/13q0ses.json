    "postText": "I'm a student who's enrolling in courses to York university. My program is BCOM. They said I need to choose a course that is not in my major or a general education course. I'm not sure what to take. I wanted to take AP-ADMS-2200-3.00-EN.... but I'm not sure if marketing is a major course of mine. It's also my first year, so maybe I can't take a course that starts with \"2\". Please help!",

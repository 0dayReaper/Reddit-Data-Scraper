    "postText": "I'm in my last year for ba economics. I have aspirations for grad school. I have taken econ 3530 and got an A+. Nevertheless, I still feel inadequate in my proof ability. For context, I have done math 1310, 2310, 1021, 2022, 2030, 2131, 2280, 2281 and 3171, doing quite well. For some dumb reason, the school decides 1200 and 2001 are only for maths, cs and physics majors. My question is, what is the closest substituite for 1200, possibly 2001 (probably not). I know about the first years discrete math courses, but are they equally rigourous in their proofs? Also, I don't really think discrete maths is as relevant to economics as real analysis, though, I may be wrong.",

However, if you use things like set theory, formal logic, cardinality, induction, Godel's incompleteness theorems, and the like, then these courses will be immensely helpful to you.",

Every person I know at york engineering/cs has struggled more in MATH 1090 than any other course \n\nIf you're using \"every person I know\" as _prima facie_ evidence that 1090 is hard, you may be on the far left end of the bell curve in statistics...\n\nI could just as easily say that I know more people who did well in 1090, but that doesn't prove my point, does it?\n\nWhat I can tell you is that when I did 1090 in winter 2019, the class average for 1090 was 5.9 according to my official transcript. That was actually the second-highest class average of all the classes I had taken that year and it's pretty close to a B. In and of itself that implies that 1090 is a doable course for most people - and when I did it, we used George's textbook!\n\n&gt; simply because it\u2019s different from any other course, of-course excluding the two courses you mentioned.\n\nI mean...it's a sequel to those courses. But also, you're straight up wrong. Boolean logic is ubiquitous in higher-year EECS courses like 2011/2101, 3101, 3201 especially, 3216, etc. and that's what 1090 teaches. Proofs from axioms is 3101 in a nutshell and if you don't see that in algorithms, please start again from 1028 until you do.\n\n&gt; it involves a different style of thinking, a style most aren\u2019t used to unless they have previous experience with proofs like you mentioned.\n\nBut it's a style that is overwhelmingly fundamental to computer science as a discipline.",

            "comment": "1019 and 1200 are decent instructions to proofs at the university level (and general math concepts such as equivalence relations, mappings, some number theory, etc.) but I did not find them to be that representative of the more topological emphasis you encounter in upper level analysis courses such as 2001, 3001, 4011 and 4012, where the level of difficulty and rigor ramps up quite a bit.  \n\nIf you ask me, I think the proofs you encounter in 1300/1310 (delta/epsilon, inequalities, limits, convergence of series) depending on the rigor of the professor you took it with to be more representative of the analysis courses you refer to.  Work through Spivak's Calculus if you want to prepare yourself.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed 1090, the Hilbert and related proofs in that course are not really representative of the proof work you do in the upper level courses. You also don't really learn semantic logic in this course as you do in 1019, but instead study systems of logic themselves, which can be fascinating, but not on point for what you are studying.",

    "postText": "do you guys think getting an iba cs degree at york will help me make international experiences?? \n\nas of now i got offers from utm, carleton and here for cs but the thing is i'm willing to have a job in other countries so i def have to consider international reputations as well. \nhowever, to me i want to make this uni thing as not just studying all day but also making unforgettable memories at the same time if i should do it anyway. and rn im thinking that spending a year in Greece/Germany would be a great opportunity and match my life goals..., not to mention that i love big cities and toronto.\n\nso my question is, \ndo u think is it worth pursuing my cs degree here over utm and carleton? it's a 'ba' degree and i also have to think about international reputations, tho I've been told those don't matter that much in the tech field. \n\niba or ibsc students how was ur experience? how does that program actually work? \n\ni know this kind of high schooler posts are annoying but i really need y'all thoughts and help on this. have a great day. :)",

Both myfile and ouac show me as offer accepted for crim but york passport and yorkstart still thinks I\u2019m going to law and society. When I tried to do course selection it told me to pick law and society courses. Basically what I\u2019m asking is if there\u2019s something I need to do to fix it and if there isn\u2019t who do I talk to, to fix it.",

There's nothing really special on campus anyway and you also have to get a meal plan which is extra money, and there's a lot of other additional \"fees\". If I we're to live on campus, I wouldn't have got to York in the first place.",

You will likely make great friends on residence if you are a social person, but if you don\u2019t it really ruins your experience. People really underestimate how much friends impact your university experience. I didn\u2019t have many great friends on residence, instead all my friends at York were commuters, and let me tell you it was not fun. I was paying thousands of dollars to live on residence to make new friends and feel like a bigger part of the community, just for all my friends to go straight home after 4pm. In my opinion commuting to a school will make you miss out on A LOT of university experiences, but at the same time spending thousands of dollars to live at a school that barely has any community whatsoever might just be a waste of money. I had friends who commuted and had a much more enjoyable first year than I did. \n\nIf you do decide to accept the offer, Vanier is one of the best residences at york, and if you don\u2019t like your roommate you can always request to be switched.\n\nIf you decide to commute, little word of advice: don\u2019t schedule any morning classes. You will almost definitely end up skipping a lot of them.",

            "comment": "Commute. The only real argument to live in res is for \u201cuniversity experience\u201d and honestly that argument is really lacking. By Friday afternoon, York becomes very quiet since it\u2019s a commuter school, that stretch from Friday afternoon to Monday morning will be quiet. \n\nAlso, for the double rooms, if you don\u2019t know your roommate prior to moving in, you\u2019ll either really enjoy or loathe it. I have met many that lived in res, they didn\u2019t enjoy it. Complex 2 is slightly better specifically Pond, but at the end of the day it\u2019s university housing. It will be noisy and shared spaces like bathrooms/laundry/showers will get very very messy (you\u2019d be surprised how many students can\u2019t function properly when they see a toilet). \n\nIf it\u2019s only an hour commute everyday, that time could be spent to improve mental well-being, learn a language, read, listen to music, note-book/journal, doodle, work on a burning passion, organize/plan, call/message people that are important to you that drifted away or even film TikTok voiceovers and go viral, there\u2019s so much to do :)\n\nTLDR: One hour + commute fee &gt; living in res",

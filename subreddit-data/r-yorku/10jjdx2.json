If the sunni family takes islam serious they would never give their daughter to a shia, unless the man converts and adopts sunni islam as his way of life. The reason is cause both groups have fundamental differences which do not fit together in a marriage. Again, I am assuming the girl's family is more serious, but I am sure most parents would accept this love if the boy and girl are on the same page religiously. I am sunni, and I would say this guy should become sunni because I actually believe in the tenets/way of life and that it is more pure in the sight of god, however, its his choice.",

For an islamic marriage to take place, both parties, as well as the father of the bride or if not alive, there are other stand ins for him must concent to it. \n\nAlso no where does it say she wants to marry him. It says he wants to marry her. And she has options. Between 2 guys. The girl and her father will make the best decision. If they dont pick this guy, then clearly he wasnt the best option.",

Americans believe in their governmental rules even if it that means pointless wars as \u201cpatriotic\u201d.

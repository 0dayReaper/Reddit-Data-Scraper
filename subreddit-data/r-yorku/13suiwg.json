    "postText": "I know ITEC is a small program, and a lot of students struggle to get the guidance needed. A lot of students are anxious that they have to compete other related majors (which is true). I know that I felt very lost for the first two years of my undergraduate. I had very little guidance and didn't know what to do.\n\nYou can ask me any questions you have and I will try and answer best as I can! I am not expert but if I can help people, why not.\n\nJust so you know who you are taking advice from:\n\n1. My final GPA upon graduation was 7.83.\n2. I did 4 internships, all in software development, which is equivalent to around 16 months or 1.5 years.\n3. I was in BCom eCommerce Development and graduated October 2022.\n\nCommon questions being asked:\n\n1. Can I have the link to your GitHub? What is your portfolio like? I won't share my GitHub on here for anonymity purposes, but also because I don't think it'll be that useful anyways because I don't build personal projects as much -  I do enough coding at work. The general theme is that employers want to see you active on GitHub (yes some will look at your commit graph). Are you teaching yourself new tech? Are you building something that solves a problem? Write a good [README.md](https://README.md). If you are unable to deploy the application, include screenshots. Learn GIT.",

The strategy is different for first and second year compared to third and fourth year. \n\n1. **First and Second Year**: There are no group projects (or at least there weren't when I was in first year circa 2019), the entire grade is dependent on you. This means assignments, quizzes, mid-terms and the final exams. Personally, I always front-loaded everything. What I mean by this is that I always assumed I wasn't gonna do that well in my final exam. This forced me to work as hard as possible in my mid-terms and assignments so by the time it came to the final, and I had four other exams, I wouldn't need to work as hard because my assignments, quizzes and mid-terms were cushioning my overall grade pretty well. \n\nAlso, just learn to listen well in class and ask questions. If you listen in class, you won't struggle as much when reviewing material. \n\n2.  **Third and Fourth Year:** Most of these classes are group projects so if you want good grades, make good friends with students who care and have good grades. You will know this if you went to class and asked questions in the first and second year, and they will know you as well. The worst thing is having random group mates who were assigned to you by your professor and one of them drops the class, the other is MIA and you are the one who has to do all the work. You need these good, understand and competent people in your group because let's say that you have a mental breakdown due to 4 other group projects you have going on. If you have shitty group members who are relying on you to get work done, it will only add to your stress. You need members that can let you have a breather and make progress on their part until you feel better. \n\nNow, I am not saying rely on your group members fully for group projects. Of course, you need to be competent to do well in the class but man having competent members will save your grades because the profs mark you as a group. \n\nI might also suggest that you contribute as much as possible to the group projects and don't be afraid of taking technical leads in group projects. This is essential because it helps you later in the workforce - it will increase your confidence. \n\nIn terms of finding jobs, there is no doubt that it is hyper competitive but my experience is that if you are good at what you claim to be good at, you are going to get something.",

They sell this lie that they can help anyone get internships. Why? Because they get money once you opt in their program. It's all BS. Understand that it is hyper competitive and employers are extremely cut throat.\n\n![gif](giphy|ytBTxD4T3slivJxRaR|downsized)",

It wasn't until second year that I realized I wanted to be a software engineer. \n\nI switched from BSA to eCommerce Development before starting my third year because I realized that the courses aligned more with the career path I wanted to go into. \n\nAs for the internships, I graduated with 1.5 years of internship experience. With regards to getting internships, it's tough now especially with the layoffs going on in the industry, but I know that interns are having an easier time securing positions that a lot of FTE. \n\nIn terms of what employers are looking for, you have to be hyper competitive, there is no doubt about that. You are competing against not only other YorkU students, but also UofT, UWaterloo. This is the reality.\n\nI'm not too sure about data analyst but when I was seeking software development positions, I had a GitHub with about 4 projects, my own personal website, and very good grades, along with 1 club and a part-time job. So, being involved is absolutely critical and knowing the basics well. The best advice I can give is you need to combine skill with connections. Go to every employer event and every career fair you can. Even if you think you aren't good enough yet, it is practice. Building those connections will increase your chances of getting an interview but if you don't have the skills, as in you can't walk the walk, you're not gonna get the job anyways. So, you have to try very hard.\n\nIn terms of what to do when you have an internship. My previous boss used to say that the best interns were the ones that, \"weren't lazy, arrogant and actually took notes when I explained something\". You have to be a likeable person, and eager to learn.   \n\n\nI hope that answers your questions well?\n\nFeel free to ask any follow up questions.",

It answered alot of my questions.\n\nIf you don't mind, I have one more question to ask.\n\nSince data analysts are similar to software engineers in the sense that there will be technical interviews requiring them to display proficiency in data structures and algorithms in python.\n\nDid you find grinding leetcode questions to be particularly helpful? If so, are technical internship interviews most likely to be the same level as easy leetcode questions or harder?",

His class average in the winter term when I took the course was pretty low. And my friend, who took the course in the fall term, also told me that the class average was pretty low in her section. Like for both the fall and winter term sections the class average was I think in the 60's. He doesn't teach so you have to teach yourself. And yes, it is memorization heavy. But me and my friend managed to both get A's. So, as long as you are fine with teaching yourself the content, you will be fine. \u263a\ufe0f",

I wrote such a bad review about him in the course evaluations because he was horrible. So, maybe my course evaluation did something because last year he was the only one teaching the course. So I had to take him. And in the course eval I was like, his TA Remy taught better than him \ud83d\ude02. Because one time the prof didn't show up (and didn't even give us a heads-up that he wasn't coming) and the TA came and taught us instead! And the TA actually taught very good! So in the course evaluation I was like \"Remy should teach this course instead of him if Remy is interested in teaching this course\". Imagine if Remy is now a prof and is gonna teach the course? Lol \ud83d\ude02. I doubt my review had that extreme of an effect though but who knows?! Lol \ud83d\ude02. I know that Professor Kopinska teaches the biological basis of behaviour course in summer and she would probably be better at teaching the course. She might be the unknown prof.",

I honestly just let my anger control me when I wrote the review and then when I sent it I can't like unsend it so yeah \ud83d\ude02. It was too late to make it less angry-sounding. But he doesn't know it was me who wrote it anyway, at least I hope not because York says that the course evaluations remain anonymous. And yeah, I don't know if he's gonna improve his lecturing or not but the lectures were mostly a waste of time (except when the TA lectured). His tests were all completely textbook based anyway.",

But it was an intense course (even though I took it in the fall term) because there were so many writing assignments due every week. And yes, you do have a good chance of doing well since the tests are textbook based, as long as you do the readings and study well. \ud83d\ude42",

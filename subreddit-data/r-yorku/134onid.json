    "postText": "I started this journey at 18 years old. After completing two years of my degree, I was financially cancelled from UTSC (my family and I went through financial and personal hardships). I gave up on myself and my degree for years and entered the workforce to help support my family. After being out of school for 5 years I eventually decided to go back, I took a couple of credits at UTSC in 2016 but ultimately transferred to YorkU in 2017 because the class times worked better around my full time work schedule.\n\nI took 1 class per term for a couple of years but paused against for a couple of years because I could not afford to pay for school. I reactivated last summer, I took 15 credits and then took my last 24 credits this fall/winter 2022/2023 term while working 40 hours a week. Admittedly, I am exhausted and burnt tf out but I am so happy to be finally graduating at 31 years old, summa cum laude with my degree and a certificate and without any student debt.\n\nIt is so clich\u00e9 to say but it is not about the journey folks, it is about the destination and I have finally reached mine :) I was not easy but man it is so worth it to be at this point no matter how long it took me.\n\nCongrats to everyone graduating this summer!!!",

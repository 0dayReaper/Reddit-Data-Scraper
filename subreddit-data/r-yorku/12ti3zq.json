I actually lived on campus so I started taking subway from York U station down to King Station and back everyday for another year.  Same job, same hours, 9-5.\n\nThere was a massive drop in speed and timeliness.\n\nI was never late for work before.  But after York U stn opened, I used to be 30-40 minutes late!  And I\u2019d start panicking, trying to email my boss to explain but I was underground, no signal until we reached the next station, right?  Or until the train came above-ground.\n\nI think they added more trains to the tracks.  More trains causes traffic jams on the rails.  So now the trains crawl like in this video for long periods of time, or even come to a dead stop for a minutes at a time.  Because the trains can\u2019t come too close to each other.\n\nI think they should go back to the prior number of trains.  People are willing to wait 2-3 minutes for the next train.  As long as they\u2019re fast and on time.\n\nThis train should not be moving at walking-speed.",

What we *do* need is just, more lines. We have 2 North/South and 1 East/West basically atm. For a city with a population of almost 3 million people, with almost 6 million in the GTA if you want to extrapolate how many people commute to outlying stations and then subway downtown. \n\nThe eglinton crosstown will help alleviate some of the East/West traffic, the Ontario line (or downtown relief or whatever they call it now) will also help somewhat with the displacement of people since there will be more options. But we went decades without expanding transit in a city that continued to outgrow the transit that had been built, now we suffer the consequences.",

This causes the trains to bunch up, aka \u201ctraffic\u201d. \n\nIf the terminal stations were designed with a multiple platform system, you could operate with more trains on the line, but, since government isn\u2019t willing to spend the money to fund our system, this is what we get. \n\nDon\u2019t blame the TTC:  Blame your government and the public for what they vote for.  \n\n\u2026 and if you get a chance \u2026 check out le Metro in Montreal, compare that system to the TTC, and start raising Hell against the Federal government for throwing money at that system, while the TTC flounders.",

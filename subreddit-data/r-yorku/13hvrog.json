            "comment": "The only way your friend can switch to Nursing is by applying to the 2nd-entry nursing program. Here\u2019s the eligibility. \n\n\u201cTo be eligible for this program, applicants must have completed a minimum of 60 credits at a recognized university prior to admission (equivalent to at least ten (10) university full courses), with a cumulative grade point average of at least a B (6.0 on the York Scale) and a B+ (7.0) average in the last 30 credits.\u201d\n\nThe average GPA of people getting in are somewhere between 7.5-8.5/9.0 on York\u2019s grading scale. Lots of people are applying to 2nd-entry nursing with most of the applicants having already finished their degrees. \n\nThe best advice is to either finish your last two years of undergrad getting at least a 7.5/9.0 for both years to have the best chance, or try to apply to the direct-entry 4-year nursing program using both your uni and your high school marks, and get transfer credits for your electives.",

But now because everything is online, there is no separation from school and home life, things like family responsibilities and school work coincides. That\u2019s why this year the time for student social interaction has been so limited since we are restrained to what the internet gives us.",

With housing on campus being...less than ideal, oppressive parking costs and massively overpopulated public areas, its just too crowded/expensive/shitty to spend large amounts of time on campus.\n\nThe culture seems to be get in, get your degree, get out. Not that there aren't people who are trying to change this, but when 50/60k of the students adopt this mentality there really isn't much anyone can do.\n\nI've never actually felt good on campus, I've always felt like I'm rushing to get back to my car and gtfo. It's not even that people are busy studying. I know what that's like, I was at Waterloo for a couple of years. It's just that campus isn't a fun/safe/good place to be, so nobody stays there.\n\nI will say that if you involve yourself in clubs its possible to have the best of experiences but if you don't have initiative/aren't very outgoing and you want this experience you might have a terrible time at York.",

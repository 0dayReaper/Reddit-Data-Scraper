I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anyone in the program who can say if going to york for honours studio art is worth living expenses and safety concerns or if i should just accept my Western offer?\n\ntoronto housing prices are kinda \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nfor reference, my york admission is for honours studio art (bfa) and my western is for advanced placement in their studio art program (bfa).",

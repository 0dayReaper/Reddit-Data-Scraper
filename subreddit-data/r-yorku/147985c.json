Does anyone know if I\u2019ll get funded. \n\nI looked it up but I\u2019m confused, can someone dumb this down\n\n\n \u201cart-time OSAP eligibility during your probation period\nIf you apply for OSAP Funding for Part-time Students (i.e., Ontario Part-time Grant and/or Part-time Canada Student Loan and Grant program) for one or more terms during your probationary period, your academic progress during your part-time studies will be monitored separately from any terms where you are receiving OSAP Funding for Full-time Students.\u201d \n\nThanks",

Then, the next time you apply you will be eligible to apply for PT OSAP. We will check your transcripts for a pass/funding source before releasing any funds.\n\nApplying for FT OSAP - you will be eligible (part-time probation does not impact full-time OSAP)\n\nIf your circumstances were out of your control, you can appeal by uploading a letter of explanation and medical/or other supporting documentation.",

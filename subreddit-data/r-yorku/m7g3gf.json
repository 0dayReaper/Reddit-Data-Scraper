Some reminders since outsiders are now showing up:\n\n* Inciting violence against Emanoil Theodorescu is against [site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Please don't.\n* Do not incite raids against Emanoil Theodorescu's Zoom meetings. While they probably didn't pay to have Mr. Theodorescu specifically, students paid good money to take those courses.\n* Sending \"dick pics\" and \"fuck you\" to anyone who has an email at York doesn't help anyone.\n\nYou're members of an angry Reddit mob now. That's a very dangerous thing.",

Second of all, \u201cof course you should worry\u201d. That\u2019s a rather stupid thing to say considering student anxiety is at an all time high, and considering we\u2019re in a pandemic, AND this student is literally living in political turmoil where going outside could result in their death. That\u2019s gonna leave a mark in the form of anxiety, and most universities nowadays at least pretend to care about student mental health so this does go against that. And also it shows a complete lack of empathy in the profs conduct. \u201cEven the internet came down with COVID-19\u201d and \u201cprotesters don\u2019t get shot for just protesting\u201d is the literal definition of unprofessional, gaslighting, and out-of-touch behaviour. Yes, the student got the weight shifted, but the professor is still an ass and if you can\u2019t see that then the other guy was right to tell you \u201cdon\u2019t be an idiot\u201d.",

Further education is a way to become an expert in your craft so you don\u2019t have to rely on a sales commission to put a roof over your head. Does everyone with a degree get a great job? No. Is it a perfect system? No. But people who truly enjoy what they study and put the work in usually don\u2019t have a problem making a decent living doing what they love.",

Also, from what I can see, he's a Sessional Instructor, which trust me, is so not \"ALMOST like tenure.\" He works from course contract to course contract and because of the seriousness of his actions, they were likely able to skip all the usual disciplinary steps and go right to termination. Or perhaps he's not CUPE and he's on a multi-year contract as a CLTA, in which case it's YUFA that will be (reluctantly) fighting for him. More likely he's a CUPE sessional and thus toast.",

Yes, Ceau\u0219escu was a violent ruler and the riots where deadly but the conflict was extremely short with the people of Romania backing  the uprising.\n\nI'm sure the professor was fishing the whole time and when he came back from the trip, his country was no longer a communist state, which is why he's such a dick.\nAll jokes aside, protesters WHERE killed then too so the only reason he was an asshole was because he's protected by the union.

The dictatorship of Ceausescu itself was also brutal, many tortured over the years by the Securitatea, people starved while they built their big palace... no freedoms and forced to hand their homes and land away whenever the state decided it wanted to.. allowed children in a hospital to be infected with HIV because he didn\u2019t believe it existed, allowing sailors infected blood to be used\n\nEven in recent times, though a lots improved, there have been violent protests against the corrupt government and people were shot. Colectiv 2015 an example of continuous neglicence at all levels as well. And still overall a poor country, although some regions less than others..\n\n\nAnyways not sure why he is like this because it makes 0 sense and our people would be embarrassed to know this ... but he\u2019s a scumbag regardless.. hope the student in Myanmar is ok",

Which is ironic considering that there were protests in Romania in 1989 during which they were met with similar gun violence.\n\nJerk is so egotistical and ignorant that he brushes off the deaths of his own people. I guess the 1,200 people that got shot during the Romanian revolution died because of \"deeper reasons\", totally not because they were protesting.\n\n\"Understand reality?\"\n\nWhy doesn't he pack his bags for Myanmar and go to the protest frontlines to see if the shooting is real or not?  \n\n\nAt the very least he needs to get fired. He deserves way more, but I'll trust YorkU to sack him quickly and save their tarnished reputation.",

But believe me, the professors, lecturers and instructors know exactly what each other's ranks are, and what they mean.\n\nThis guy is an \"instructor\", meaning that he's probably on something like a 2-year rolling contract.  Since he got his PhD in 2002 and is still an instructor (and in a second-tier Canadian university), that means that he will likely never be a professor.  It's likely that he wanted to be a professor but has never been able to get a position as a professor.\n\n\"Instructor\" is probably the lowest-status, lowest-power position that a PhD can have in a university.  He is probably literally ignored by everyone in the department except the undergraduate chair that tells him what he's going to teach every term.  He's likely only doing it because his identity is bound up with being good at math and wanting to help people understand math.\n\nSo when you wish for him to be fired, basically you're wishing for the end of his 25-year academic career and the end of his identity.  Maybe that is exactly what you want, but think about it a bit before deciding for sure.",

If someone unfamiliar with academia asks me what I do, I feel uncomfortable saying I am a \"university professor\" since I don't have the academic rank of profesor, and in my mind this would he a lie. If I say \"associate professor\" then usually the interlocutor is confused about the meaning of \"associate\". So I typically say \"I teach math at the university\" even though this is an incomplete description of my job. Indeed, this guy likely has no tenure and it would probably be easy to fire him. His remarks are even more shocking considering he is from a country that went through a bloody  revolution 30 years ago and protesters were killed in the streets.",

A friend of mine sent me a screenshot from a Seneca professor called Cameron Gray. His class had to submit an assignment at 10:00 p.m. some people try to submit it just before the deadline but Seneca's system was down. So when these folks reached out to Cameron Gray. He told them that it's their fault that they decided to submit at the last minute even though every student had a right to submit it as long as they submitted it before 10:00 p.m.. he told them get used to it this is not good studying habits and did not take one ounce of responsibility for Seneca's system failing. I have sent the screenshots to Seneca and they said they will do something about it but to this date they have never reached back out to me to tell me what resolution was taken. Pretty sad that this is how universities and colleges treat students when...let's face it...what they teach universities and colleges now are so out of touch with what people really need and what employers are looking for. Not to mention the exorbitant amounts that they charge. And this is the type of experience a student can expect. I hope the university and college system is disrupted soon enough. Many employers now are going towards a attitude over aptitude model for hiring new employees. And many don't even ask for degrees for non-technical positions. there is all these different websites popping up where you can learn what you need to learn and acquire the knowledge at a fraction of the cost. Hope universities and colleges go the way of taxi cabs in Toronto.",

He believes about these protestors specifically, with no evidence whatsoever, that either they weren't shot or that there are other reasons why each of them was shot (behaved violently, were criminals, etc.).  From the tone we can almost safely assume that he believes there were *justifications* for why each of them was shot.  Not a safe assumption, but seems likely: He believes authorities are good and therefore don't shoot people simply for protesting, and protestors are violent and those that get shot have done things that would merit shooting them.  Clearly this former instructor has a very limited worldview and needs more experience before he is granted any authority again.",

            "comment": "Getting into med school in canada is extremely difficult, the applicant pool is very competitive and stringent in its requirements for admission: very high gpa &amp; mcat scores, first-hand experience in the field,  etc. I went to high school with some very bright people, some of which were in the Advanced Placement program. Out of the two dozen or so people i know did med sci or life sci for their undergrad at various canadian universities like uoft and York, i can count on one hand the number of people i know that got into med school in Canada. There are a couple of people I know who had damn near perfect grades in AP courses, principal's list every year who are on the waiting list for UofT and McMaster med schools. Its that competitive. \n\nThing about Canadian med schools is that the academic infrastructure and prestige is already foundational to the program, meaning once you are admitted into med school, as long you are stick through it, your employment opportunities are locked in. I also know that some people believe that if they go to an \"easier\" program like supposedly at York, they can get a higher gpa score than if they did a similar degree at a school like UofT. However, since York doesnt have its own med school and Uoft does, people who do undergrad at uoft may be able to develop professional and academic relationships at the school which may help their chances of being admitted",

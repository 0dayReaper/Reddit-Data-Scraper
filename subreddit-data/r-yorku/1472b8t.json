    "postText": "I recently received funding from OSAP for my enrollment in 9 credits ( full time) but I have to drop one of my courses, which is worth 6 credits. dropping the course will change my status to part-time for the summer term since I will only be enrolled in 3 credits after the drop. I know that the school will refund the course fee directly to OSAP, I am unsure about the remaining funding that I received. Do I have to repay it? Or will they turn the grant into a loan?",

I was gonna drop the course anyway so i didn\u2019t really get into it or ask much. Just call the school and ask them because i\u2019m sure these things happen all the time. I think i read somewhere that what would happen is that they\u2019d give you less or no funding next summer or sth like that (but don\u2019t count on this because i have no idea if this is true).",

You will be put on probation by osap. (This doesn't mean you won't be able to enroll in courses)\n3. You can still apply for osap during the fall/winter session, but you will most likely get less funding than you did previously\n4. You must return to a full time student within 6 months and need to pass atleast 60% of your courses during the fall/winter session\n\nSo yea I'm also in the same boat",

You can apply for OSAP (first strike - monitoring period for the current and next academic year)  \n2. Academic Probation will not impact the amount of funding you will receive for Fall 2023-Winter 2024 (it is considered a new academic year.   \n3. *Overpayments in most cases* impact the current academic year only.   \n4. Most students will be assessed academic probation when the OSAP application is adjusted or at the end of summer when we review all students who received OSAP for 2022-2023.   \n5. Uploading the OSAP change form will expedite the withdrawal process, otherwise we pull reports to capture student withdrawals/ drop in courses when we review all student files.  \n6. Not all students get grant to loan conversion, and it is calculated automatically by the system when the withdrawal or course load change is applied to your application. The grant to loan conversion will not appear immediately in your NSLSC account, it can take months for the systems to connect. The institution (York U) is not involved in this process.",

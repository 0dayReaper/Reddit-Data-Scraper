I am currently doing my course timetables but some of the courses don't have any info on the Instructor, should I wait till the instructor information gets updated or should I just submit it now. Also what instructors would you recommend for LE/EECS 1028  LE/EECS 1021  SC/CHEM 1100  LE/ENG 1101/2  SC/MATH 1013/14    SC/MATH 1025  SC/PHYS 1800/1",

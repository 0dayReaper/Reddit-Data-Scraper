I also shop Walmart online for groceries because you can better see what\u2019s on sale/rollback! As per entertainment I oftentimes will do some research on free events in Toronto &amp; volunteer/gig opportunities at events so that I can still be a part of something that I may not regularly be able to budget for like concerts and shows :)",

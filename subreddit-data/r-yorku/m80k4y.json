I politely knocked on his door and asked him if he was free (during his office hours). He walked to the door and slammed it saying \"NO\", almost hitting my laptop. I just walked to the Math-Stats lab for help and switched out of his section right then and there.",

Our country was originally \"Myanmar\" but when the British colonized us, they changed it to \"Burma\" because it was easier to say. When we gained independence from them we used it interchangeably. Foreign countries use \"Burma\" often simply because it's easier to say.  I personally prefer Myanmar because Burma comes from colonization.",

If it were so, there should be an email from the registrar notifying students and faculty members that it will change. the most recent one is telling that effective date is TBD.\n\nAlso, even it says that this applies to all students, there is some discrepency. Professors only hand in their marks as letter grades meaning that no one but professors only know their grade in numerical term. A student with 70 would be given B in current marking scheme, but the new scheme will give a B-. This is not a simple matter. Most of student will face their grade drop significantly depending on majors.",

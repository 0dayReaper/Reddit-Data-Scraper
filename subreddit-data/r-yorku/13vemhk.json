Go if youre really ready for it. \n\nAlso I\u2019d suggest go to uwaterloo. If you want a miserable life, might as well be at a good school",

Granted I transferred from somewhere else to ITEC, and then to CS. so a lot of the stuff was repeat for me. Just do whatever you can get into and do as good as you can. 6.0 is the absolute minimum to switch over 24 credits. With the averages people are getting rejected from HS now, I'd say a 7.0 is probably the minimum you should expect to need",

I use my laptop more than an ipad. an ipad is more of a luxury when it comes to diagrams but u can always hand make diagrams. u could always get a cheaper laptop that isn\u2019t a mac and then an older ipad (they sell refurbished ipads on the apple website which are cheaper and they have warranty)",

They literally all have ipads and apple pencils or another type of smart pencil. They say that it helps them retain information better when they physically write and it helps a lot when they draw their own diagrams and labels.",

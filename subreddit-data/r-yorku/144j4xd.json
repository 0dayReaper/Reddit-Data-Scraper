It's a really great place to work or do research - try getting into that fs. Genuinely the best stepping stone of getting into your career. \n\nIf your plan is med school honestly it doesn't matter where you go lol. You just need to be accountable for yourself. \n\nI've been to Ryerson and didn't exactly like how spread out all the classes were. York's like its own little town. And there's a ton to do there as well. \n\nIf you received a scholarship from either school I would go to the one which offered more. \n\nCongratulations on your acceptances and best of luck :)",

It's called a Skill Issue!\n\nSeriously tho, people complain while they only come to school, sit by themselves, attend class, and go back home. How do you ever expect to connect with others when you never seem like you're open to connecting?",

There are few like anime club and all that which is nice to find good community. However the intent of the post is bad if guys are going to just go to these places just to talk to women or find a potential partner in general. Just go somewhere that ya genuinely have interest, and let the script write itself.",

Anime clubs are one of the exceptions\n\nA lot of people join clubs to meet people. You can have more than 1 interest/intent when doing something. You can join for the club and to meet people (women included)\n\nEdit: And it's not just clubs but volunteering too. There are lots of events on campus that have nothing to do with humanitarian or charity stuff but only women volunteer for them or there'll be a small number of guys. Like volunteering for fall or winter orientation for example\n\nBut anyway, why don't guys volunteer for humanitarian or charity stuff?",

I run a club as well, and people are shocked to know we do have a club like that at york. The ones that are more committed just find out. Plus just commuting in general at york is tiresome for most and they don't see any worth putting themselves out there",

That's what I've been trying to say. \n\nAnd yeah certain clubs have a good mix but most of these volunteer things are female dominated for some reason and I don't get why guys don't care about this. There's literally research on this. And I have talked to staff who deal with volunteer stuff at our school who say this too since they've also noticed this.\n\nI don't get why it's rocket science to find out about clubs. Isn't it obvious they'll be on social media?",

There's literally programs just to help women in general succeed in general like elehacks and all that. I'm not saying this shouldn't be a thing, but it helps alot that there are programs like this that do make it more appealing in general. Ofc this is totally anecdotal, but it shows from what you and I see. From a male perspective, majority are interested in more hands on and interactive stuff like sports, video games, anything ya need to build, and more.\n\nIf people are looking for the clubs, yes. If they are a typical commuter, they probably wouldn't think to much of it unless they stumble upon it. Lowkey people want a basketball community club, but they don't have one at york, which is quite sad yk",

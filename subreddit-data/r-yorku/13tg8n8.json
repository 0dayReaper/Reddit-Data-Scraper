    "postText": "It's my first year in York. They said I must take a 6 or 9-credit general education course. I decided to choose the Canadian Language and Culture, but when I opened the course outline IT said I must fill out an ESL form. What if I just enrolled in that course with the code K65R01(AP HUMA)? Does It affect my enrollment process?",

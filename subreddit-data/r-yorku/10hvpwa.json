People keep making the point that the current description fits the entire student body.. if they identify a race it will *still* be vague and likely in the low thousands. Furthermore, when race is provided, people tend become more irrational with the height description and will broaden the range (giving or taking a few inches), which is especially bad considering most men fall within a similar range. Providing race will, and historically does, encourage people to be unconsciously biased and unnecessarily afraid. This does not increase safety.\n\nLets say they say that the person is brown, are you going to avoid the thousands of brown men on campus that are around 5\u201910? Let\u2019s say that the person is black, are you going to avoid the thousands of black men on campus that are around 5\u201910? Let\u2019s say that person is literally any race around 5\u201910, are you going to avoid all of them?\n\nOverall, a race description does not add sufficient information in this situation. Try to identify just *why* you would feel so much safer if race is provided.",

Let\u2019s say a race gets provided\u2026 isn\u2019t it fascinating that people start finding *everyone* from that race and gender suddenly more \u201csketchy\u201d?\n\nThis is called a unconscious or (for some of you) conscious bias, and it is quite literally how profiling begins. For instance, at my old school, we had a similar situation where there was a crime.  The police gave the individuals gender, height and race (black). Then, to no coincidence, more and more black males started getting stopped/harassed by the school police. 10\u2019s of black males got stopped, and yet a criminal was not found. Shocker! \n\nAgain, nobody is saying that descriptors *aren\u2019t* important, what *is* being said is that something like race is not *enough* and it actually causes more harm than good.\nIt would be so much easier to say the real reason why you\u2019re pushing so hard for race and not proper identification.",

For those of us that aren't racist it would be nice to know because we're not going to start suspecting everyone anyway because it's useless to do so.\n\nI get that the suspect might not set off any alarm bells or you might not see them coming but if knowing the race of the suspect could have helped someone avoid an attack because they were acting in a way that was out of the ordinary that would be awful.

Ive read old news stories about attacks at York and it's a mixed bag of people.\n\nAnd if you didn't steer clear of someone who was being sketch... Then how does race help? Like should everyone be extra vigilant if we spot a person of x race, regardless of sketch levels? Are sketch people of x or y race more sketch than others? \n\nI'm totally in a agreement with everyone that this is scary and we feel powerless, but I don't really see a way that everyone looking out for an unidentified person of a certain race specifically will keep you safe. You could get mugged by someone different tommorow.

                            "comment": "\"they're just being avoided out of safety\" Dude. It's sort of a big deal that effects people if everyone in their community / campus thinks everyone of your race is a stabbing threat. Not physical harm, but I think that if hundreds or thousands of people on our campus are avoided, treated with fear, suspicion and aggression for an indefinite period of time for being on the campus they pay for, that has gravity worth considering. And it does increase risk of physical harm for them, either people getting fight or flight because of a person's race or reporting random people to security or police.\n\nAnd we don't even know if these are the same person or if York is just a easy pickings. There's no necessary end point where this would be resolved and the \"avoid guys of X race\" would end, and it's not like York notifies us if a specific person was caught and we can check them off the list of Dangerous People. It's not a closed system.\n\nSo instead it's just this atmosphere of fear and confusion - \"oh, a few months ago x race guy assaulted someone.\" It really doesn't add clarity. It's not like we have a spread sheet of potential threats. We can't deductively keep ticking things off until our period of safety racism doesn't need to be applied anymore.",

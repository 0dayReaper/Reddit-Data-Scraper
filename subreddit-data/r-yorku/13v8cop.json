    "postText": "Hi guys, I got accepted to both Kinesiology and Global health Bsc program at York. I'm just wondering which program will be most decent when it come to applying jobs in the future. Do you think taking global health would get me into a 2nd entry program? if so, how? ... also, is global health easier that kin?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPls help me.. I really need to make a decision between these two.. I really wanted to go to nursing but my grade were not enough to get in.. i might take global health since it shows on the site that nurse could be a possible career.\n\nTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE!",

The gen ed consists of 12 credits from non-science and 6 from foundational science. They already included 6 foundational science credits in the 18 gen ed. ones. Then why are 6 credits mentioned separately in the science section? Are these different science courses? If yes, then which ones?\n2. The major section is supposed to be 77 credits. 32 of which are core eecs, and 9 are core math courses. 12 credits are mandatory non-core eecs and math (elementary probability, embedded systems, etc.) At least 12 credits from 4th-year courses. 12 from outside of EECS, math, stats Where are these 12 coming from?\n3. 15 of the additional elective credits are 3rd-year courses. Where are the other 4 coming from?\n\n Any advice is appreciated.",

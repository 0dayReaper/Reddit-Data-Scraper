Your best bet is to contact the GPD of History and ask whether this is done often (some departments simply don't have the capacity to do this). You might also wait until you arrive and forge relationships with professors whom might be interested in doing this for you - directed readings are generally taught without compensation, so it's effectively instructor goodwill. I hope that helps!",

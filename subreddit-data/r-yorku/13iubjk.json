    "postText": "Hi everyone, not really sure of how to go about this.   \nFor one of my courses this semester I had a really great prof (she really put in a lot of effort and went above and beyond) and I wanted to write a thank you email to them as a thank you note highlighting some of the great things about them as an instructor. Would this be alright to do?   \n\n\nAlso, they are a new professor so I think it could be helpful for their career but I'm not sure who I'd share it with or how?",

Even the smallest thank you goes a long way, especially for newer (junior) faculty. \n\nYou could email the Dean as well, if you feel so inclined. Just a simple \u201cI wanted to let you know about the great experience I had with Prof So-and-so.\u201d \n\nThere are a few \u201cofficial\u201d reasons why these letters are so helpful (tenure, awards, etc), but most of all they help the professor know that what they\u2019re doing is making an impact and to keep at it!",

All other universities asked for high school grades and reject me even I'm under 3.5 GPA. So i think its pretty easy to transferred from a college to York",

They tend to look at your most recent grades. \nIf you were at college beforehand, they would look at that more than your high school marks. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure if there is a section specifically for transfer students (I haven\u2019t checked) but maybe if you search, there could be answers you\u2019re looking for.  I\u2019m pretty sure though that if you are applying for a different program apart from your original one that you did in college, there are still prerequisites you need to fulfill to be in a new program. For example,\nIf you decide to take biochemistry and you need a \u201cbiology\u201d course, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll look at your grade 12 marks for it. Rather, they might look at a Functions mark that you did in college or if you did any courses that is a prerequisite for it.",

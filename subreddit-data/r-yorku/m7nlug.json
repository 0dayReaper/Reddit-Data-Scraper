In order to get my calculus exam deferred, I had to get a death certificate proving that my grandfather had died suddenly. His name was mispelt by 1 letter on the certificate, and I was told that I couldnt get a deferral and some random rant that forgery is punishable by law. So, I had to go to Montreal from York for the funeral, and come back from Montreal to write an exam the day after the funeral.\n\nYork's math department is a massive stain, not only on the Engineering side of things but on the entire school as a whole. I did the rest of my math courses at Carleton University, and their math department was leagues and bounds above York's. Absolute disgrace.",

What were the other options?\n\n* Valeri Michkine\n* Jorg Grigull\n* Seyed Moghadas\n*  Igor Poliakov\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n*  Norman Porzitsky\n\nIt's insane to think all those teachers teach fundamentals to new students (Math 1013/1014). This is just engineering I'm sure it's worse for Math/Stats majors who deal with the entire cohort.",

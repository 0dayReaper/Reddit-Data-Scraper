    "postText": "I am incredibly appalled of how poorly the course organization and delivery is for students enrolled in the online section of ADMS 2500 - Intro to Accounting.\n\nThe course delivery and material consists weekly audio recording of the lectures with no video to demonstrate the course material which is mostly practical vs theory, tons of audio feedback, chairs scraping and background noise and an early Saturday morning zoom tutorial.\n\nThen, there is the textbook that has the online quizzes but provide very little context about how to work through problems and the questions are just not very clearly written regarding what sort of calculations they are looking for. \n\nI can believe I spent money on this course. If I wasn't scraping by with a B avg and thankfully have access to external resources (and by that I mean the internet), would have absolutely dropped this class by now...\n\nHow in the world is this allowed? Very poor standards for online learning",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a problem with the way the course is structured because it\u2019s the same issue with in-person classes as well. I took it last semester and it is possibly the most disorganized course I\u2019ve taken in my program. Time management per lecture is so poor because the prof tries to cram everything into 3 hours and it\u2019s clearly not enough time. The textbook is a joke. I stopped referring to the textbook after the first few chapters. It does nothing to help explain the concepts. Each chapter has maybe 5-10 questions at the back and there solutions have so many typos so it ends up confusing you even more. The prof solves 1-2 questions in class which are taken from the back of the textbook so there\u2019re not extra questions to study. The tutorial was on a Saturday at 9am which is absolutely criminal. The TA doesn\u2019t share her questions with the students so we\u2019re expected to take screenshots as she goes which is so annoying. \n\nI think the main issue with the course is the unending practical application of accounting in real life with so many different types of transactions and it can get difficult to cover all those concepts in one week per chapter but they absolutely need to do a better job at delivering the course content more clearly. I was just as pissed as you.",

The prof does an OK job of explaining in class but then the problems for the connect questions look nothing like what we do in class. One of the marked questions also had a typo for a value that read 23,000 but was really 25,000 so all the answers are wrong. They sent an email to correct it. How does that happen and not be fixed  properly.",

You should all do that. If someone sets up a petition fine. But writing a letter with your name attached to it is best IMO",

I went to college for SSW years ago and just finished my BA with a 3.8. They ask for 5 years of social work experience if I can recall correctly and I have that at my current job alone, in addition to placement positions, so I think experience may have been a bigger factor than grades. They also told me my written application was strong. I think it was concise but rhetorically appealing",

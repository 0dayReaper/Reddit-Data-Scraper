It's October for fucks sake.",

But a lot have completed their research career and exclusively lecture. On top of it, they teach the same material over and over, never changing anything. \n\nSo yea, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder what else are they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve had countless professors as I\u2019ve been in post-secondary ed for years. Trust me, many profs are just difficult because of ego",

In those cases, it\u2019s still likely not them doing the marking. Even if it is them, for large papers it could take an hour to effectively grade each one. If there are 100 students in a class, that\u2019s a couple weeks of full time work for just that one assignment in one class.\n\nThere are also faculty meetings in departments, thesis defence committees, peer-review and editing in academic journals, communication with other professors at other institutions, and a lot of other things they may still be doing if they\u2019re not actively engaged in their own research. There\u2019s a lot to the job of a professor that students don\u2019t see.",

                                    "comment": "$554,000 is more than most doctors apart from the very specialized \"i did 10 years of post-MD specialization training\" surgeons who operate on very extreme surgeries.   \n\n\nMost normal doctors (family physicians, ER surgeons, etc) do not make that much in Canada. A quick google search will give you a wide range of numbers from a variety of sources, but most estimate between $300,000 and $500,000. Economic Research Institute (a decent source) lists a Canadian surgeon's salary at an average of $388,249. \n\ndoctors who are not surgeons make significantly less than that, as well. \n\nYou may be confused with doctor salaries in the States, where many make over $500,000 USD (about $650,000 CAD). However, doctors in Canada rarely make over $500,000 CAD without specialty training that would have required another few years of training after their bachelors, MD, and residency. Such doctors don't even start working until their mid 30s or even later, and can easily end up with mid-six figures in education related debt.",

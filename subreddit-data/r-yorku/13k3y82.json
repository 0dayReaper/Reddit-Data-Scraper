    "postText": "For the majority of the entire year, I have been using google Maps to locate my way around campus to find all of my classes. I stumbled across unknown places but never lost my way and found the classes or offices in the end. Now, I need to go to my faculty(Faculty of Health), and I spent 20 minutes yesterday trying to find it by following google maps but every single time it leads to a Tom Hortons and its drive thru. Has the office vanished? Please help,\ud83d\ude2d I need to give in my CPS. Or if there is any alternative office nearby the main campus area where I can give it in please do inform me",

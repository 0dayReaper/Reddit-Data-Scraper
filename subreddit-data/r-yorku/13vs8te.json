    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student, so it\u2019ll be my first time coming to canada. The website says that august 26th is the move in date for on campus res and classes start on September 6th.\n\nI think I\u2019ll be able to come to Canada on the September 1st. But I\u2019m anxious abt whether I would miss any frosh events or  like orientation days? \n\nIs it better to move in exactly on the 26th of august, or would I be missing anything in general? I\u2019ll also be having a roomie who I don\u2019t know yet.",

(That's what it was for me), but i highly highly recommend you go on the move in date. And if there's any delay with your visa, you have to email them. Otherwise, you lose your residency.",

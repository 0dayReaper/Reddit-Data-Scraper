I get to see my friends/family whenever since most classes are usually recorded. I get to study whenever, go out whenever, and take any part-time jobs because of the flexibility.\n\n\nRemote learning has allowed me to achieve my highest cPGA while having plenty of free time despite taking 6 courses per term and working 24 hours a week. I do hope that all students get a choice since some prefer in-person.",

The whole process of in class learning is to meet people and do hands on activities. We're only sticking to online because of this pandemic and this isnt a great way to learn, not for everyone. If universities will just create online degrees for international students, that's totally not in the best interest business and financially wise for them. No one is signing up for this bullsh\\*t if they cant even visit, enjoy the county and network in a whole different country from a screen. Even now with them pushing back things JUST so international students can struggle between coming or not shows they dont care cause they need $$ from them. Why would you even want to spend this amount of money just to sit at home and self-learn. Sorry if this sounded really rude, I feel like I have been not doing so well because of how unmotivated I get from online school. Its frustrating but at least its nice to know people are making the best out of it",

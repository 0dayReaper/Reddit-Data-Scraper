            "comment": "what enrolment checklist are you talking about? To the best of my knowledge, there is nothing called an enrolment checklist, so you may be talking about something else and using the wrong name.\n\nIf you are talking about the list of courses that you have to take for your degree, that is called the \"degree progress report\". Search it up and it will give you all the information you need.\n\nIf you are talking about actually enrolling in courses, you utilize the Visual Schedule Builder to decide which courses you'll be taking and ensure that there is no scheduling conflict, then you utilize the enrollment module to officially enrol in the courses you selected in the visual schedule builder.\n\nif it is something else that you are looking for, let me know.",

You have to mark off the online checklist before it lets you into the actual enrolment page. \n\nThe checklist is malfunctioning so after you mark everything off, there's no promised option to let you continue to you to the actual website to choose your courses. Essentially the checklist doesn't actually save and every time you refresh or leave the module, the refreshes. \n\nEven if you try to by \"bypass\" the link they're supposed to give you after the checklist, it'll flag you and say you have to complete the tutorial first.",

The second time they told me they couldn't do anything about it and told me to contact my faculty. \n\n!!The faculty-specific phone numbers pick up almost immediately so call them instead!!\n\nTry emailing [yustrprb@yorku.ca](mailto:yustrprb@yorku.ca) since that's apparently the *only* way to contact them. \n\nThere's definitely an enrollment checklist. It says an option/button would pop up to confirm you read and understood the tutorial but it never popped up.",

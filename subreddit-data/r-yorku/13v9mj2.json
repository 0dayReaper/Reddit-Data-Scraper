I\u2019m trying to switch into another program and although i got a particular course waived when i came to york they\u2019re asking that i redo the course ( money grab) \n\nDoes anyone have any advise for me, i can either take Kine 2031 or Nats 1650 but i was wondering which one you people would think it\u2019s more manageable as an A is the goal. \n\nDoes anyone know any good prof for either courses ? What was your experience? Any feedback would be appreciated.",

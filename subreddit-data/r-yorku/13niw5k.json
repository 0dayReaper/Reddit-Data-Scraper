    "postText": "Hello everyone I\u2019m currently in university of Saskatchewan. I was thinking to transfer into York u, I see that York is still accepting admissions. I\u2019m studying applied computer bsc at usask which is basically a cs degree. \nIdk if transferring to York is my best bet but I don\u2019t wanna delay it further and transfer before my first year ends. Note: I\u2019m an international student and I stay on campus at usask. I pay about 950 cad at usask for my residence. Saskatoon is pretty dead with almost nothing to do at all but university isn\u2019t that bad tbh it\u2019s pretty okayish, the professors are great and there\u2019s nothing bad I would specifically mention about the university. So far there hasn\u2019t been any act of violence or anything of that sort so it\u2019s pretty safe too. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts regarding the transfer, should I go for it or would it be better to stay where I am? I\u2019m confused",

            "comment": "not a cs student, but why are you transferring? do you believe there are better academic and future career pathways that will open up for you if you went to york instead? are you looking for a change of scenery/environment? if youre just transferring on a whim, id advise you think the decision over more, its a very drastic change and the consequences may irreversibly change your academic career and personal life.",

                    "comment": "I\u2019m transferring because I do believe I will have more opportunities, the issue with Saskatoon is that the city does not have huge companies/firms or internship opportunities. Secondly you cannot work in the field of your study as in you won\u2019t find part time jobs related to your course work. Third issue that I\u2019ve faced is that I\u2019m more looking out for a city life but at sask it\u2019s a slow placed town kinda vibe, there\u2019s no rush there aren\u2019t any huge clubs or malls or anything of that sort etc. The city has little do to things that I\u2019m interested in, I know some might say to give it sometime but the issue is that if I do give it more time the later I apply for transferring the more time I\u2019ll be wasting and I\u2019m not even sure if all the courses I take up will be credited at another university. Fourth issue is that the winters are harsh asf which is pretty obvious stating that it is sask and lies at the center. I wouldn\u2019t say I had tm trouble but I just feel pretty upset during winters here for some reason. Now I\u2019ve heard some not so good remarks about York like go anywhere else but York, york has strikes all the time, york has violence on campus, off campus residence is not at all safe and impossible to find. Idk how much of this is true. The reason behind me thinking to transfer to York is because I think I\u2019ll make more friends, have a better life, will be academically more active and might end up getting internships somewhere nice. The issue with usask is almost the same, plenty of people live off campus and already have a group of friends so they don\u2019t even try expanding their groups much. The university on the other hand is beautiful and no doubt about the teachings it\u2019s amazing. If this clears up any sort of doubt!^ \nThis is irrelevant but since I\u2019m an international student traveling from on is easier since I\u2019ll have to take only 1 flight other wise it\u2019s like 4.5 hours from sask to Toronto and then another 16 hours which isn\u2019t a major drawback but is a minor one. Please do correct me if I am wrong since I don\u2019t wanna take a wrong decision and regret later.",

                            "comment": "like i said, im not a cs major so i cannot comment on the employment and academic opportunities regarding your major and career, although i assume since York is in the Greater Toronto area, it will have better exposure and networking opportunities than saskatoon, i really cant comment further on your first two quandaries.\n\nHowever, in regards to student and social life at York, it really depends on how outgoing you are as a person. If you took a look through this subreddit, you'd find that there's one or two posts daily asking how to make friends at York, why people at york are so hard to make friends with, why they feel lonely, etc. York is a commuter school, many of the people who dont live on residence come from neighbouring towns and cities to York. They commute to school, attend class, and leave. Of course York has a party and social life, but its not as profound as other schools like Western or Queens, all of which are renowned for being party schools. If you want to make friends here, in most cases you will have to put the effort in, you might need to approach someone first and start up a convo, etc. Naturally, if you live on campus, itd be easier to make friends than if you commuted from out of town, but id wager there are ppl who live on campus who still feel alone regardless.\n\nYour comment about saskatoon being slowpaced, and your desire for the bustling vibe of city life, York isnt exactly located within a metropolis. Its situated in North York which is still outside of Toronto proper. Ive never been to sask so i cant comment on the urban life, but if you want to feel the buzz of the city, youd have to take the train or transit downtown which depending on the day could take 45 mins to an hour plus and can be quite expensive if you do it on a regular basis.\n\n The winters at York can be pretty bad, but i reckon nowhere as bad as sask, although with global warming who knows? \n\nYork has developed a bad reputation among some that its a low tier school, proofed by slogans like \"if you can hold a fork, you can go to York\", etc. At the end of the day, one can brush that up as elitist drivel created by those who go to prestigious schools like UofT, but you must consider whether or not the academic prestige of where u complete ur ba matters for your work. But at the end of the day, York is a B tier school that is overhated. Its definitely not as renowned as UofT or McGill but its way better than Brock, Guelph, and the other regional ontario schools.\n\nYou say sask has little to no crime, sadly i cant say the same thing about York.  While the crime that happens here is admittedly overblown, and most of it is because of York's unfortunate proximity to an area known as the York village, a neighborhood of townhouses where regular ppl and students live, id wager theres probably more risk for crime at York than in Sask, although id say 99% of  york students are unaffected by this so called rampant crime. York is also located near an area Jane and Finch which a couple decades ago had a bad rep for being crime ridden and ghetto, although its nowhere as bad as it once was.\n\nThe York strikes happened right before I went to York, a few of my friends who are a couple years older and went to York before me, had to live through the strikes and their 4 year degrees quickly became 6-7 because of it. I luckily did not have to deal with any during my time here, but who knows what will happen in the future? There are rumblings of unionizing graduate research and the like in the states, dk if the same will happen here.\n\nThing about off campus residence is true though, the GTA and Toronto have been recieving the brunt of rising rent and living costs, and you should really consider looking into viable residency before applying. You dont want to be stuck with nowhere to stay, espescially if you are an international student. A lot of the tenants who put up places for rent in the village flat out exploit students, so id be extra stringent in looking for places to stay. Also consider if you have the money to afford living here, id imagine everything is more expensive here than in sask but idk.\n\nIt seems to me that you like urban living, id suggest looking into UofT and TMU comsci programs, they are located in the heart of downtown Toronto, but i assume admissions and residency will be even more difficult and expensive. York has a solid com sci program though, just know that once you transfer youre risking a year if not more to satisfy your urge and desire for better opportunity and living, its a big decision, do your own research and ask any of your close confidants for advice, at the end of the day forums like this should only inform your decision, not make it.",

                                    "comment": "First of all thankyou so much for noting all of my points and clarifying it in depth. I think I will somewhat make a rational decision based on all the pros and cons. Like you mentioned I will have to take a bus or train to travel to Toronto or somewhere. The thing with Saskatoon is that even if I take the bus (there isn\u2019t metro) there\u2019s nowhere to go. Like no where at all. The city revolves and runs around the university itself. As soon as you land at sask airport you\u2019ll see the university banner all over the city, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad thing it\u2019s just that the main attraction of the city is the university and that\u2019s all. There aren\u2019t plenty of stuff open late at night everything closes by 6-7 pm (I mean the restaurants, malls, shops etc.) I\u2019ve only spent one semester and have hardly made a single good friend there because everyone just leaves as soon as class ends and most people go to their homes that\u2019s off campus so making friends solely depends on the individual here too. Crime rates are pretty high in other parts of the province, the university itself is pretty safe and sound there\u2019s nothing to be worried about on campus. Just like a small village near York sask too has a small area where it\u2019s unsafe and I\u2019ve never been there since I live on campus. The opportunity irrespective of your degree is not uch at sask. The best thing is if you land a job on campus if you don\u2019t then you\u2019re gonna have to work at a restaurant or cafe or a bar etc for part time because there aren\u2019t any amazing internships or something that they offer. The province is famous for agriculture and its mainly focused on agriculture that\u2019s why agriculture is prioritized more so for people pursuing a degree related to agriculture it\u2019s a gold mine for them. About the expense part, I currently spend about 1.5k a month on rent and food approx which I think would get higher if I stayed at York (I cook at home mostly) I rarely eat out. I barely have any miscellaneous expenses. The tax here is 11% (PST;6% and GST:5%).\nWhat I feel is if I go to York I\u2019ll have more courses to study from (I\u2019m thinking to switch from cs to a commerce related course) I will have more internship opportunities. Not everyday but maybe once or twice a month I could go to have fun and get the \u201ccity life\u201d I\u2019m not into partying so party school doesn\u2019t matter to me I\u2019m okay with anything as long as it isn\u2019t completely dead. Sask has like 1 decent mall in the whole city, the university has close to no food outlets to eat from there\u2019s like 3 Tim\u2019s, 1 Starbucks, 1 subway 1 Harvey\u2019s that are decent and that\u2019s about it, there are more like booster juice and pizzas but in total it would be hardly 6-7 with limited options . Aside this I hate the weather when it\u2019s peak winter it goes upto feels like 40-45 C. Academically I\u2019ve spent one semester complete and I\u2019m doing my 2nd one now, it\u2019s not tough it\u2019s doable if I study a bit. I attend almost most of my classes we have approx 70-100 students at once. The courses differ but the grading is divided between % from assignments to quizzes to midterms and finals so for eg my final for business was 35% mid term was 25% assignments were 35% and quiz was 5% . Idk how it is at York I will have to ask someone regarding it. Again thankyou so much this was very helpful and I can\u2019t thankyou enough",

    "postText": "Hello I am going into my 4th year and I still have 6 credits of gen ed left. I will be relatively busy with a thesis so I was hoping I could find something that is easy and has as little essay writing as possible. \n\nMy enrolment date is soon so I am a little worried. Could anyone suggest a 6 credit class and the prof they took the class with? \n\nThank you!",

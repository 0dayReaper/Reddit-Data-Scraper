    "postText": "Since my childhood, I couldn't achieve anything. Specially academic success. The thing is I've always tried to do my best. Nothing mattered but I didn't give up.\n\nI know these might sound a little weird but just wanna share\n\nI couldn't do well in my grade 10 and 12. I had to give t IELTS exam 3 times. I don't know why, but i guess I am not that much bad at English. Currently, I am studying at York University (undergrad). My first experience for the first semester was worst. I took 9 credits. At first, it was smooth and easy but by the time I realized my efforts were not enough even though I was giving all I could. Two of my three profs still have 1.8 and 3.1 rating out of 5. And another prof, it was her first time teaching at university. And she didn't give any assignments throughout the course (only 3 midterm and final). I cant tell how bad my cgp was. It has traumatized me in every way.\n\nBcz of these past experiences i am currently feeling so low. Doest matter how much i study i end up with a bad grade. Can someone tell me how can i increase my confidence or how can i get rid of ADHD and depression?",

            "comment": "oh sweetie i\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. But it\u2019s not easy to get rid of depression or ADHD, but you can find ways to deal with them. For depression, find some things that you like to do (fun and entertaining). Find some motivation. Think about what you want to do in life and try your best to work towards that. For ADHD, you can try find ways that help you focus. For example, if you\u2019re studying, try doing it alone to avoid large crowds or noises. And find a study method that works for you. Study at the time of day that works best for you.\n\nIf you can achieve some of what I said, your confidence will start to improve. Eat properly, dress nicely, get enough sleep. It might take some time, but you\u2019ll get there\n\nHope this helps \u2728",

            "comment": "A few things that can help with ADHD:\n\n1) Eliminate as much red food dye, sugar, and coloured pop from your diet, especially before studying and class. Most people know about the sugar, few know about the food dyes;\n\n2) study at a clean desk, facing a wall or corner. This will limit optical distractions;\n\n3) put your phone on do not disturb or airplane mode when studying. Leaving it in a different room has also been shown to be helpful;\n\n4) if you listen to music when you study, listen to scores\u2014not soundtracks (they have lyrics), scores\u2014from movies and video games. These have been designed to both hold the audience\u2018s attention while not distracting fro the object of focus. My favourite scores are those by Trent Reznor and Attica Ross and Hana Zimmer;\n\n5) if your ADHD isn\u2019t too bad during class time, sit at the front. This will reduce the number of distractions in your line of sight;\n\n6) if your ADHD is going haywire during class, sit at the back in an aisle seat. This way you can pace at the back or stand and fidget without distracting your classmates. You may not be able to take notes but you\u2019ll retain more than you realize. When this happens promise yourself you will revisit your notes and the content when you have calmed. This will help you recall what was happening while you were pacing;\n\n7) ask your profs if you can audio record their class so you can revisit the lecture after episodes where your ADHD was going haywire (see the point above)",

The winners are those people who don't give up and keep going. You could barely graduate, and 5 years later be in a much better place in life than someone with top grades.\n\nAnd here is the kicker. Jobs don't pay anything these days, and you won't be able to have a decent life working regardless of what job you get. Every year gets harder, and it's basically game over for your generation. The good news is you can still make great money elsewhere if you are entrepreneurial. Especially if you have some sort of outside interests or skills. Do you look good and are fascinated with widgets? You could probably make 1-200k a year with a YouTube channel. Look at those stupid hamster in maze videos and how many views they get. Don't give up in life. Explore what's possible instead. Your degree isn't worth much even if you get straight As.\n\nWelcome to 2023.",

There are engineers, lawyers and doctors out there who are all licensed but yet graduated at the bottom of their class. I personally graduated from York with just above a C average and it has not defined my success. I made 150k last year and I\u2019ve battled with adhd and depression my entire life. You can do this. You are on your own journey and no one else\u2019s. Figure out how YOU can get through this on your own timeline and don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone else. Keep your chin up",

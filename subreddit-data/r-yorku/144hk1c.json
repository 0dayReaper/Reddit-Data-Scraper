You don't have many credits and enrolment is prioritized in order of credits completed so that people can graduate on time.\n\nThat being said, your enrolment date is probably about the same time as your peers with similar credits completed, so your second-year major courses should not be full.",

Maybe the people you're referring to haven't completed many credits?  But that sounds baffling to me.  I don't think it's merely arbitrary (meaning, I think there are rules/a system to it, and it doesn't make exceptions for individuals).",

An 8.0 in LAPS (where class averages are higher) is very different from an 8.0 at Lassonde, for example.  And 8.0 could put you in the top 25% in the former, top 10% in the latter.  Anyway, only administration knows the true answer, and I am guessing based on my own experience and what others are saying.  Program year is definitely not the (sole) criterion.",

That would be unfair, but also, very funny.  \n\nGenerally speaking, enrolment time slots are allotted based on your standing as a student \u2026. Grad students get first pick, then dean\u2019s list undergrads, then new students &amp; students with acceptable GPAs, and students on academic probation or who are on the cusp of academic probation go last.\n\n\u201cWhen\u201d you pick your classes is pretty irrelevant; York allows you to enrol in a course even after it starts \u2026. and since you can\u2019t get shut out of any course that\u2019s a degree requirement, what\u2019s the problem?",

            "comment": "Considering that Canada is about to change medical assistance in dying laws (and already has changed eligibility) together with an aging society overall, there will be a significant need for psychiatrists/psychologists who are experienced in the field of assessing MAID requests, assessing mental capacity supporting patients who would like to make an advance directive etc. \n\nGrief counselling and anticipatory grief are big topics that I think will become more relevant. \n\nIf that is something that you would like to explore more (even if you decide afterwards that you don't want to work in that field) it would be worthwhile to take a course that discusses this. \n\nAnd then of course you could look at the pandemic and how CAMH is now looking into brain changes due to infection and how/if these brain changes can influence existing mental illness but also cause mental illness. \n\nBig field to play in. Enjoy the time at school and dip your toe into as many topics as possible. You'll never know - you may fall in love with something you never thought of.",

                    "comment": "Agree with this, the average age of the global population is only going to increase as birthing rates continue to decline in developed countries and as developing countries continue to develop. Aging-related effects on health, economy, society, etc., will seem to only become more prevalent and important as time goes on.\n\nSo, if OP or anyone else has an interest in how aging affects our mental well-being then Neuroscience of Aging &amp; Cognitive Health (PSYC 3495) is a really interesting class that goes over the neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience of aging and its effects on cognition, as well as some of the current clinical approaches being used to address age-related decline. York actually has some professors (like Dr. Gary Turner who teaches PSYC 3495, and Dr. Dale Stevens) doing some really \ninteresting work in the cognitive neuroscience of aging!\n\nAlso, I guess I should've mentioned prior, I took this class last year and it was pretty easy + Dr. Turner is a really good professor.",

The closest class I know of is PHIL 4084 (Animals and Philosophy of Mind) with Dr. Kristin Andrews but obviously, that's a philosophy class. For what it's worth, if you're interested in it, I've taken similar classes and while they're often theoretical and conceptual, they're also empirically driven so it's kind of more like theoretical psychology in a sense.",

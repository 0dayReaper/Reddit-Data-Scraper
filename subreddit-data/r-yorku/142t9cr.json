I just spent 3ish hours per weekend on it and it worked for me the entire year! Would highly recommend online version but I\u2019m sure in person is doable too. I had it with Prof Cohen\u2014I found her really great and helpful (and really caring/sympathetic).",

But yeah I\u2019d say it\u2019s a relatively easy course in that you really don\u2019t need any preexisting knowledge and the concepts are fairly intuitive to grasp.",

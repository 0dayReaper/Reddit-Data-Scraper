It was planned several months ago (November). **I was on campus before operations closed or were announced.**\n\nWhether I stayed parked at York or went somewhere else, the drive home would not be safe. The show ended 10:30pm **downtown.** It was a full house btw, and we TTCd down and back up afterwards, as we had planned. Parking at York guaranteed me somewhere to sleep. An Uber would be a hundred dollars, and my car could get stuck.\n\nI arranged to stay over on res for a sleepover with my friends beforehand, but I took them to the lot because we wanted to see how crazy the snow had gotten, not try to leave. It was altogether really pretty, too.\n\nEdit: The downvotes\u2026 don\u2019t really make sense. I planned for this, executed the plan, and did the safe thing. Comment has been updated to reflect what happened better :p",

She did her best and in general it was a great show.\n\nDuring intermission, everyone was in the hallway. Snowstorm + lightning/thunder started, and people screamed out of shock a few times. It was cute.\n\nI recommend going if you can get tickets, it was a great night with 6 of my friends. Afterwards we met up with people from high school and had 1am bubble tea before TTCing back to york and making this post. They offered to let us sleep over so many times too haha",

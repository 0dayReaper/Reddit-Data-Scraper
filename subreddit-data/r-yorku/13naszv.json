A fun fact about 1500 - you get to learn about molecules using virtual reality ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)",

            "comment": "If you want, you can study grade 12 chemistry again.\n\nOption 1:  Get a grade 12 chemistry textbook (maybe from the Toronto public library), read it, and do the problems yourself.  There might be an answer key at the back of the book, or there might not be.\n\nOption 2:  Summer school, through your local public school board.  Google for your local public school board's summer school information.\n\nOption 3:  Night school, through your local public school board.  I think this begins in September or October, though you must register and enrol in advance.  Google for your local public school board's night school information.\n\nI think it's allowed for you to take grade 12 chemistry twice, though I'm not 100% sure.",

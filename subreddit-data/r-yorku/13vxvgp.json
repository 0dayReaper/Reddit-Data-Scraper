    "postText": "Hi, I am currently a high school student and I've accepted my offer for biomedical sciences. Unfortunately, it has just hit me that my degree might be useless. Although it is a great degree, I will probably have to pursue a masters to get a decent-paying job. This is not really the most ideal option for me as I have a strict mom who is always going on about making money after graduating, which I know is not really ideal. Because of this, I've started to take interest in the 4 year direct-entry nursing program. I understand the pros and cons of being a nurse, and the program still interests me. I wanted to know if it is possible to transfer into the nursing program after one semester? It is a very time-specific program (and I think some courses can only be taken in the first semester) so I kind of assume that I might have to wait a whole year? (which rlly sucks). I am also aware of the 2nd entry nursing program, but I would prefer to be in the 4 year one. My enrollment appointment is not until July so I can't really ask them rn. Any advice about my future or nursing would be nice, having to decide my future at 17 is kind of stressful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also like to mention that I am a first generation immigrant daughter LOL. The pressure to become well educated and get a good paying job is very heavy.",

Live for yourself not for someone else! At the end of the day any burden or consequence of ur action is on yourself not on someone who you think youre doing it for. Also coming from a first gen immigrant daughter :)",

I suggest taking courses this year that will transfer into your nursing program, like PSYC 1010 and Anatomy and Physiology. This way, you'd only be taking 3 courses in the fall and winter semester in your 1st year of nursing.",

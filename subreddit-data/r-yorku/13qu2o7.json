    "postText": "Hey guys ,\n\nSo I was thinking to go to tmu for electrical engineering but I also have the choice to go for york engineering too but I am not sure which one to choose. I did visit both universities and honestly I like tmu more cause first for the location, buildings architecture since york has very old buildings and anyway I just don't like the university itself. Also Tmu is way closer to my house, however I am just trying to compare the engineering programs and I wanted to know what's the opinion of york engineers about this .",

But if you have a preference for a program that is only offered at one of the two, go to that one. However, since you mentioned electrical engineering - which is offered at both - I encourage you to check out the academic calendars and see which courses you will have to take at both, especially which upper-year electives are available.\n\nAlso, you mentioned that the buildings are old at York...have you even seen our engineering buildings?",

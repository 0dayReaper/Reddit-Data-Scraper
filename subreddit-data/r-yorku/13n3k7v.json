Bio is a better option so here we go.\n\nHigh GPA is attainable, but do not expect it to be easy as I have seen people consider York as an \u201ceasier\u201d school. 3.9x is attainable but you definitely would have to work for it. \n\nMany of the courses you take are quite good for MCAT content learning, but do not rely on your courses, MCAT format is really different than what will be expected from you in your courses. \n\nResearch opportunities exist, but will not come to you unless you reach out to labs/profs. You have to show commitment, dedication, and good work ethic (aka good/decent grades) to be able to land a position in a lab. A lot of patience as well, as you will need to email many people.",

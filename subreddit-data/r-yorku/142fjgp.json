    "postText": "I wanna know how co-op works for computer science at York. Do we still have to pay tuition during co-op? How many co-op terms can we have at max? And what's the average pay? Is it better than getting an advanced diploma in CPA? cuz getting a degree from a Canadian university is crazy expensive for international students. Right now, I'm considering three options: \n\n1. Get a bachelor's degree in computer science and take out a loan. \n\n2. Get an advanced diploma in CPA from Seneca College. \n\n3. Start with an advanced diploma and then transfer to a university (but not sure how that works).",

            "comment": "Co-op at York is fully optional for CS, you can do a total of 20 months over as many terms as you'd like and the co-op board has a one time fee and the accompanying courses you take during co-op also have fees. The average pay depends because co-op doesn't confirm a job for you. It gives you access to a job board and that's it. You need to still find the job yourself for the most part",

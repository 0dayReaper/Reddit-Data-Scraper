    "postText": "I got accepted into biomed for Fall 2023, but I decided I want to switch to biochemistry. The science faculty told me to submit a new application so I already did that. My concern is that I used my acceptance letter from biomed to apply for a study permit. If I get admitted to biochemistry, will it cause immigration complications? I already recived my study permit this year in February.",

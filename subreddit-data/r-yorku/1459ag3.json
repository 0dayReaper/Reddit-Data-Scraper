Don\u2019t take more than 4 courses each semester in your first year. trust me you\u2019re going to burn out frequently, you won\u2019t have any energy to study, will probably have a horrible sleep schedule and won\u2019t have time to do anything including eating properly or having enough breaks. On top of that, you\u2019re gonna need some time to adjust to uni life and to figure out the uni routine/schedule that works for you so you can manage your time effectively. You won\u2019t be able to do that with this many courses to take care of. Take it easy man, you have plenty of time to complete the courses you wanna drop \n\nAlso, you should have enough breaks between classes because you won\u2019t be able to focus otherwise. Uni courses aren\u2019t like high school. You should have time to revise (if you want) after your classes or take a break most importantly. It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s 3 hours back to back, but not more than that",

Also keep in mind those labs only happen every other week, so in reality your schedule won't be super packed EVERY single week. Only suggestion I would make to make it slightly \"easier\" is to maybe do either Bio 1000+1001 or Chem 1000+1001 in second year, and take PSYC 1010 instead (this depends on your personal strengths though, and which courses you find easier).",

When I was in highschool, I wasn\u2019t really a studious student, just go in and get high grades. University hits real hard, I have to actually study, so my time management was terrible. I was barely passing classes and I had a hard time studying for long hours. \n\nIt does get better second year tho, I did 8 courses instead of 10 for second year. Good luck my friend, as long as you don\u2019t give up, you can do it. Also, expect failures, but don\u2019t be sad about it, use it as motivation and learn from it. Lastly, don\u2019t be too over confident cause that\u2019s how I got 30% on my first midterm, thinking it was \u201ceasy\u201d",

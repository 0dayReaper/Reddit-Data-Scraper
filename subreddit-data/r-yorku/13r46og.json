    "postText": "i\u2019m going to york in september for crim and i need all the advice i can get on how to plan for my first year. so far i\u2019ve been told:\n- NO 8AM CLASSES, earliest possible should be 10 so i don\u2019t suffer\n- lectures come before a tutorial \n- look at ratemyprofs when choosing classes\n- enrol early \n- in-person is preferred (i struggled a lot with pandemic learning)\n\nbut now what i want to know is:\n- how do you feel about big gaps during the day? like one class at 10 and maybe another at 4 for example\n- how do you feel abt really late classes, like starting at 4-5:30\n- which days are best to have no classes if possible to use as a work day \n- are back to back lectures any good?\n- best time to commute to and from school to avoid rush hour if possible\n- should i bring a lunch or buy food?\n- early morning labs and then a lecture? (if you already had a lecture a couple days ago)\n- how do you feel about going to class on mondays and fridays? (i ask this bc i know mondays are tough to get a lot of work done but fridays a lot of people experience fomo is they have lots of classes)",

            "comment": "Hi. I\u2019m a first year CRIM student going into second year now. \n\n1. Big gaps during the day: that\u2019s a no. 1 hour 30 minute gap max to eat lunch, reread notes and relax for a little. If you wait too long for your next class, you\u2019re gonna get tired. Had a 3 hour break between classes for my first semester and was in shambles trying to stay awake for the next one.\n2. Late classes: if you live near by, then late classes should be fine. If you live far away, late classes are a no.\n3. Best day for no classes: most people would say Friday, but it\u2019s Wednesday for me because it\u2019s in the middle of the school week. I can catch up and let my Monday and Tuesday classes sink in and prepare for my Thursday and Friday classes.\n4. Back to back lectures: that\u2019s a no. Have a little break in between as mentioned before (1hr 30mins max). You don\u2019t wanna be rushing to your next class without time to prepare and get your head together.\n5.  Commuting: I\u2019m a commuter and when I have morning classes, there is not a lot of traffic (as long as it\u2019s not raining). Going home after 4 or 5pm may have some traffic, but it\u2019s manageable.\n6. Lunch: you can bring lunch as there are plenty of microwaves on campus. You can also find some cheap lunches too (patties, a wrap, etc)\n7. Labs: not sure about this as I\u2019ve never had a lab.\n8. Monday and Friday classes: I love Monday classes (I usually have a max of 2 classes on Mondays). I don\u2019t really like Friday classes because the vibes are always boring for me, but I have 1 class on Fridays anyways and it\u2019s works out fine.\n\nHope this helped\ud83e\udd79",

Over that and it can get a little annoying.\n\n\\- Late classes are fine if you're not taking early classes anyway\n\n\\- Wednesday. Get your middle-of-the-week weekend so you never have more than two days of classes in a row\n\n\\- Back-to-back lectures are fine, almost all profs are courteous and will let the class out ten minutes early. Being a few minutes late to a lecture has never really led me to confusion, even in more theory-heavy classes.\n\n\\- Commuting between 10am and noon and after 8pm are best to avoid rush hour. Do not commute between 3pm and 4:30pm if you are a poor transit user like me.\n\n\\- If you don't already think about food prices that much, just buy it if you don't have the free time to make and bring it.\n\n\\- If you prepare a day in advance, it doesn't matter when your lab is, you'll be fine.\n\n\\- Mondays and Fridays are fine, just don't drink Sunday night and make Friday night plans rather than Friday evening ones.",

            "comment": "Honestly my favorite days were classes from 10-12, 12-1 break, and classes from 1-2. Not sitting around for too long, not hurting my brain either, not waking up early, not staying too late. Personally for me a 2-3 hour lab felt better than a 2-3 hour class. If you wanna skip a day I would do friday or monday to give yourself a long weekend. Definitely bring lunch because the price of food is gonna stack up, but treat yourself sometimes if that\u2019s something you can do.",

            "comment": "Former commuter student who did a combination of full time in person, remote, and night classes:\n\n* I hated myself because I would do probably 3 hours in between classes. I would use this time for reading, food, coffee, relaxing, etc. I would agree with other commenters that this break is too large.\n* When I started at York I could only do the 7-10 PM classes. There are a lot of interesting courses that are offered at these times. Though, if you are full time, stick to day classes if you don't want to deal with the long days.\n* Friday is nice, but honestly any day off is a blessing when you have a full course load. If you work part time at a restaurant or something and you work on your off days, Fridays suck to work so keep that in mind.\n* Depends on what you mean by \"good.\" Is it tiring? Of course it is. The benefit is that you're in 'learning mode' and are prepared to get right back into lecture. This also compresses your day a bit. But if you are a last minute crammer, you won't be able to get your reading done. You can run into problems depending on where the class is located (10 minutes from DB to Lassonde is rough)\n* No time is the best time to commute to school (this is Toronto after all). My advice, if you have an 10:00 AM, leave at 8:00 AM to avoid any issues. \n* If you want to save money you should bring a lunch, but school days are long. Save your money for getting coffees or energy drinks as needed.\n* Didn't do labs so I can't say - but you should get used to doing a mix of lectures and labs every day/other day because it isn't going to get easier and you can rarely get an ideal schedule at this school.\n* Do what works for you - I came in as a working professional so any day worked for me. Mondays are always rough but you should not be in the habit of writing off days of the week, especially if you want to take certain courses or a required course is only available on that day.",

If it is the next day as opposed to 1 hr after, I dont think it matters but you may need to refresh with the lecture material\n\nFor 2nd year course tutorials, there will likely be less days available. I had 3 tutorial options in 1st year and only 1 option in 2nd year",

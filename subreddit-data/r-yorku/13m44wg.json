    "postText": "Hey guys. I will be starting college this year, and was fortunate enough to receive a full ride scholarship from York University Toronto. I also got into the CS co-op program at Waterloo. Just wanted to know whether the opportunities one gets through Waterloo are worth the extra money and if going to York will actually hurt my chances of getting great jobs/opportunities or even going for a master's program (either in the US or Canada) in the future.  \nP.S. Even though I can afford Waterloo without going into debt, it will still burn a huge hole and leave a pretty solid dent on savings.",

            "comment": "While York CS is good, DO NOT turn down UW. The co-op program is insane and it is easily top 20 CS programs in the world. You can easily make more than you would if you graduate with a York degree. Average UW CS grad salary is like 150k, more if you move to US (which is also easier with UW coop cs degree because UW has connections to silicon valley)\n\nOverall, Do not choose York over UW. I would say york full ride is worth choosing over any CS program in ontario other than Uwaterloo/uoft.",

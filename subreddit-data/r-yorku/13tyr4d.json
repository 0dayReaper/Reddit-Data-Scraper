    "postText": "I'm a 2nd-year Financial and Business Economics (FBEC) major. I want to switch from FBEC to a Hons. Double Major in Comp. Sci and Economics. I would appreciate some advice. I am ahead for my degree and would complete my degree in 3 years, but I feel FBEC restricts me to just Economics and I want to be differentiated when entering the job market, in a few years. I love Computer Science and coded my own Inventory Management System in high school. I want to continue my passion for both Economics and Computer Science. Do you guys think it's a viable decision? I have attended advising sessions and they suggest that switching would make me extend my time in York to 4 years from 3 years but I would graduate with two majors.",

Given that all three seem to be the case, I'd say go for it.",

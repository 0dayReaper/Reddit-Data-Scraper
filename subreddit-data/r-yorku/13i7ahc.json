    "postText": "Hello!  I'm not that fond of my grade in one course.  From my estimations, I thought I'd end up with an 81% in my class, but on my transcript I received a B+.  On eclass, the professor never posted our grades for each assignment.  I don't have a clue what I ended up getting on two out of four assignments, nor for attendance and participation. \n\nMy question is, do we have a right to know our grade breakdown?  Can the registrar give that information or only the teacher?",

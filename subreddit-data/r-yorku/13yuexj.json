    "postText": "The convocation email they sent in May was not sent to me even after being eligible to graduate. I emailed &amp; called them to ask when I would get it but they said to keep waiting. \nOnly today I asked this other person who is also graduating if they got it &amp; they said yes. \nSo I asked him to forward it to me &amp; it was since May 1st. But I met all the requirements to graduate. \nAnyway it said the deadline was May 29 but when I clicked the link to RSVP I paid the fee &amp; got 3 tickets &amp; I printed the confirmation.\nMy question is, is anyone else in the same boat &amp; would I still make it to graduate for June? Or do I have to wait til September even though I already confirmed it? It\u2019s for June 22 2023.",

The fact you met you are eligibile to graduate has nothing to do convocation since you can pick up your degree july 4th from registrars office. I would suggest reaching out to yorku and i think they are pretty accomodating.",

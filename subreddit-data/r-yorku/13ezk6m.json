    "postText": "So, I graduated from York (biomed). I was applying for jobs but I realized I will need to study further to land into a decent one. I made a mistake of rushing through my undergrad and now I don't have gpa to get me into a grad school. Although at this point I'm still not sure if I want to go to grad school or do some certification courses or attend college, but I'm curious to know if people get into grad school with a low gpa or not. Like if at all in future I decided to do master's, can I get into it? Basically, can I get into master's program with low gpa if I have some work experience in between?",

It is not end of the world as you can still try to get in grad schools. You will def need to weigh on some other options to make your application stand out. Not impossible. But you would have to work a little harder",

But that doesn\u2019t mean it is not possible. Grad programs are often not only looking for the people with the highest grades, but also those who have a great passion for the subject and can contribute a lot. It is still possible to get in by showing your passion through things like experience and explaining your dip in grades in the later years, assuming you aren\u2019t below the cut off. If you are below the cutoff it will be difficult because some programs will automatically decline you if they see your GPA below the minimum.\n\nLet me know if I can help you out in any other way.",

If they want you the school will accept you unless your grades are absolutely awful. Contact potential supervisors you\u2019re interested in before applying and explain you\u2019re situation. Explain that you didn\u2019t take it seriously enough and it\u2019s not a reflection of who you are. You\u2019ll need to convince them that you\u2019ll perform better under them. A good way is to look into their research and pick a prof aligned with your interests. When you research personalize it with references to your interest in work they\u2019ve done. That often gets their attention because it shows you\u2019ve done your work. \n\nIf you can do those things you can get in despite grades. If not you\u2019ll need to pick up some new courses to try and bump up your average. But from my experience (I have a masters and have spoken to many supervisors on this specific issue, as well as my sister who is a professor and has told me what she looks for in grad students) this can be done. This is just my experience though. Obviously all schools are different.",

In the event your GPA isn\u2019t the best, having work experience can compensate for it on your application. You said you can\u2019t land the best paying on, but try to land one in the field you\u2019re hoping to do your masters in and work there for a few years. Most top programs will consider you in that case. \n\nIf you\u2019re open to studying abroad, you can look into the UK universities once you have sufficient work experience. Most of their programs completely eclipse those in Canada in terms of prestige and they tend to value work experience a lot more if your GPA wasn\u2019t the best. A friend of mine despite having a very low GPA was accepted into a top program (in terms of global rankings) in her field due to her significant amount of work experience (8 years). I know several other instances of this from my peers. Don\u2019t be dismayed, it\u2019ll just require some commitment from your part. I should also mention that there are some full scholarships you can win primarily because of work experience. \n\nI don\u2019t think a lot of the other commenters here are familiar with these alternatives as they\u2019re a bit younger and only now starting in their careers.\n\nBtw, when applying to a Masters program and subsequently a PhD, don\u2019t do them in the same university if it\u2019s avoidable. It\u2019s generally looked down on to have all your degrees from the same university. This is true for many jobs, and especially true if you ever hope to teach in your field. Some students feel more comfortable continuing in the same place because they\u2019re comfortable there and have developed rapport with professors etc., but it\u2019s a huge mistake unless the specific research program you\u2019re in is one of the best in the country with a top recognized professor (for example if you\u2019re doing biology or paleolimnology under Prof. John Smol at Queens).",

            "comment": "At 2K budget, I'd recommend at least making an attempt to find a 1 bedroom or bachelor apartment in the North York area. North York is the district that York University is located, so anywhere in the North York area should make getting to the university easily.\n\nI'd recommend finding a realtor who can help you search for places in your budget range. At 2k there should he realtors who will work with you, and you can find some that don't require any pay up front. They make their commission after they find you a location, and they're paid by the landlord and realtor company they work for.\n\nIf you're in Canada, I'd highly recommend being there to hunt for these places. A good rule of thumb would be to find a place that was used for residential purposes before Nov 2018, because they are considered \"rent-controlled\" units. These units are subject to controlled yearly rental increases as dictated by the Landlord and Tenant Board, and the landlord cannot increase your rent any higher than the prescribed increase. A place built afterword is not rent-controlled, meaning that the at the end of your lease term, the landlord can hike up the rent by however much they please. \n\nI also HIGHLY recommend doing your due diligence to learn about what rights you have as a tenant. Whether you're a domestic student who is going to be living on your own for the first time, or an international student coming to Canada for the first time, it's SO IMPORTANT to know what your rights are. I've been in the rental scene since I was 17, and basically every landlord I have signed a lease under besides my current one has, or has tried to violate my rights as a tenant. Thus, the knowledge of your rights is really going to give you power. A common example of a way that tenants' rights are violated is that landlords often attempt to require a \"security deposit\" outside of Last Month Rent, which by law in Ontario is not legal. Leases also DO NOT END after your 1-year term. In Ontario, leases automatically roll month-to-month after the term ends, meaning that you are not required to vacate the premises once the lease term ends.\n\nOverall, I will warn you that the rental business is brutal. Finding a place at a good price, with a respectable landlord is going to be hard. Thus, you want to search early, search hard, and be highly diligent when selecting where you want to live. Good luck out there",

But with your budget of 2000 dollars I think you\u2019ll be fine. \nPersonally I recommend Midtown area. Rent could go anywhere from 1500 to 1900 there. I don\u2019t know about crimes there, but it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. It\u2019s a nice area w cool people. It\u2019s only about 20 to 30 minutes by TTC too. \nAlso, in case you\u2019re not aware, if you\u2019re gonna be renting a place you, you\u2019re gonna need a few documents like bank statement etc. I\u2019m not sure of the exact documents you need, but I\u2019m sure you can find information about it online.",

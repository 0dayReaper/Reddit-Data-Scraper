This is from my knowledge as a Bethune residence student. \n\nThe non-suite style rooms come with a pretty small room. There's a main bathroom with a few private showers, a large common room with a large table (and accompanying chairs), a sofa, some countertops with cabinet space, and a shared fridge.\n\nThe suite style rooms are basically the same as non-suite with the addition of a microwave, an oven and stove, and (as it was in my case) an extra shared fridge.  \n\n\nThe suite style rooms let you have either 3 or 10 suitemates. By that I mean there are either 4 rooms, or 12 rooms that have one or two common doors, and a door to each room. The latter   \nsuite will have an extra shared fridge, which people will usually take from no matter what you put lol.",

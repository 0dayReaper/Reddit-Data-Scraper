I\u2019m probably misinterpreting this lol. \n\nGeneral education breaks down into specific course types you need to take; one natural science, one humanities, one social science. \nCourses outside your major are none of the 3 general educations classes you took, but can be any course that isn\u2019t a psyc class or one that counts towards your degree (with some exceptions): theatre, art, math, kin, etc.",

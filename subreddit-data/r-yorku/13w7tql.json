People were saying that the GPA change was gonna be this 2023-24 fall/winter year but apparently there was an update that said that the change is to be determined so the change might be later than that. York has also not released any official info to students about when the change is gonna be so it's really mainly speculation at this point about when the GPA change is gonna be. But apparently it is gonna happen because it says so on one of York's pages on their website.",

    "postText": "hi so basically i\u2019m a first year psych student and i did not do good at all. i failed most of my classes and i saw that it says i\u2019m required to withdraw for 1 year. i\u2019ve been having a lot of health issues over the year so i missed a lot of my classes and then also had to deal with a loss of a family member so my physical and mental health was at an all time low. i read somewhere that i could get it waived? if anyone knows any info on how I can do that PLS LMK.\n\nedit: how likely am i to acc successfully waive this some said they\u2019re more lenient with first years.",

            "comment": "Don't waive it. Take the time away. Failing all of your courses especially in your first year is not a good sign of your future prospects. Taking the year off to focus on your mental health and settle your life circumstances is important, and trying to circumvent that by forcing yourself to take more courses isn't going to magically make it get better.\n\nI understand and respect that life does get in the way, so take this as a kind but firm suggestion to take the year off and come back after that with a renewed motivation to do well in your courses.",

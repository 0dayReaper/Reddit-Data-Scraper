One possible way to do it \u2018in your first year\u2019 is to do  the fast paced psyc 2010 in the fall term if it\u2019s offered and then 2021/ 2020 in the winter term, but idk if I\u2019d recommend that unless your reallllly sure about your study habits being successful. \nYou can definitely take them during the summer after your first year, but again they might be more condensed so a bit more heavy.",

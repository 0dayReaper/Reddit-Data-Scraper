    "postText": "HI everyone, I will become a first year student ( BSc Applied Math) this September. I want to work in order to pay my rent as it is a huge financial burden for my family. However, I also want to get a good score for all of my courses ( I am a diligent student). However, I do not know how difficult the math course is in our school. Should I reduce my part-time hours? Should I work in the campus or should I work as a server to have tips so that I can reduce my work hours/ week?\n\nHope to hear all of your advices so that I am able to afford my living cost ( around 1300 dollars/month)\n\nThanks in advance\n\n[this is my schedule](https://preview.redd.it/z73d8gl2q93b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fca136b0c9691ec677904d0a913bf2420b9a7151)",

But good grades isn\u2019t the best way to frame it. \n\nThe real question is how much of a drop in marks is acceptable compared to your all out. \n\nMost people come in expecting one thing and getting the other. I know a lot of people from fancy highschools that \u201ccovered\u201d calc 1 to calc 3 but got lost after calc 1. \n\nI know people with horrible highschool marks getting A+ after A+.\n\nFrankly most people that work traditional jobs during the semester I have noticed tend to get worse marks not horrible but not overly good.",

    "postText": " Hello!  \nMy name is Elif Memis and I am an MA student in the graduate program in STS at York University. I am currently conducting a research study as part of my thesis about **increasing youth\u2019s civic education through digital games**.\u00a0\n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore young adults\u2019 civic engagement and **learning experiences through playing digital games** designed for educational purposes. My aim at the end of this research is to guide game designers according to learners\u2019 needs in terms of instructional design and user experience design.  \nI am recruiting undergraduate students in their first year of studies at York who are between the age of 18-20 to be interviewed before and after **playing a web-based civic video game**. The interviews and gameplay session as a whole process should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.\u00a0\n\nInterviews will be held face-to-face and participants will be provided laptops to play this web-based civic video game. This research has been approved by the York institutional review board.\n\nIf you have questions or would like to know more about the study before you decide to participate, please contact me at [elifmemis25@gmail.com](mailto:elifmemis25@gmail.com).  \nThank you for your consideration,  \nElif Memis  \nMA Candidate, York University\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuj0b75etv2b1.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=73a22334f4af880ada5d2fd12b49d127de8d9b5d",

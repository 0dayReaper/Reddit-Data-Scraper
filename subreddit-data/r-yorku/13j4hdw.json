    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, so I\u2019m in a scenario with a Prof where I have to be kinda careful not to mess up my reply.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m graduating this year and this Prof has been late on their grades. I get it, life happens, and marking is hard. Their course is the last 6 credit course I need to complete my degree, and it is a random Philosophy elective I took to satisfy degree requirements. I am in no way shape or form a Philosophy student and it might be the only course I took in that department.\n\nAll program requirements are required for the graduation audit by Wednesday, May 24th, 2023, and so yesterday morning I emailed the Prof asking about the grades. They got back to me this morning and said \n\n\u201cThey will be submitted by the end of this week.  It may take the registrar's office a couple of dates to upgrade your grade report\u201d. \n\nNow this would normally be reassuring, but the Prof had already sent out an announcement email about two weeks ago saying that they would be uploaded by LAST WEEK, and lo and behold they are not uploaded as we speak. And on top of that, there may be system issues?!\n\nFURTHERMORE, I calculated my current CGPA containing 114 credits and found that I have a 7.47; 0.03 off from graduating Cum Laude! I would need an A from this class to secure the 7.50 threshold. Now, I know graduating Cum Laude literally doesn\u2019t matter, but I want to look cool for my parents lmao. \n\nMy assumed mark is around the top B+ to A range, but this Prof was late on a majority of the marks, so I could be anywhere at this point (but I know I at least passed). In the scenario of a B+, I wanted to explain my scenario and talk about a potential grade round up if I was close enough. If I\u2019m at a B or C+, I just won\u2019t press the issue cause I just don\u2019t deserve it at that point.\n\nBasically, I have no idea how I would go about responding to this. I want to both secure the grade for graduation and also know my grade so I can potentially talk about that grade round if needed. I want the email to be concise, not troublesome, and understanding. But just this post alone explaining the situation is the opposite of concise lol. Any advice? Maybe I should email the registrar too? Let me know y\u2019all and thank you.",

Should I ask them for the grade and then go from there, or ask for the grade and simultaneously say \u201cif B+ then blah blah blah\u201d? I feel like that\u2019d be an awkward email to word lol",

More info = better appeal-- like if the issue is with a too-low participation grade vs. a poor essay mark. \n\nI'd want to graduate *cum laude* too! Hope it works out.",

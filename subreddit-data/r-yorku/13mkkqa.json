    "postText": "i plan to apply for law school, yet I\u2019m not sure which field of law I want to go into. It\u2019s either Criminology or Law &amp; Society. I\u2019m leaning towards a career in real estate, family or corporate law for sure and to my current knowledge - crim seems more narrowed and LASO seems too broad. \n\nWhat can each degree be used towards without law school? Is there a point of going to criminology if I have a strong interest in the topics, yet no interest in pursuing a career in criminal defense? Please help me with guidance.",

            "comment": "I am a lawyer. In law school, you read case law ad nauseum, which is not something that you do in any undergraduate program. Most of your grades come from 100% open-book final exams. You can see some sample law exams and an LSAT in the links below. Read through some cases to get a feel for it.\n\n[https://law.library.ubc.ca/exams/](https://law.library.ubc.ca/exams/)\n\n[https://cache.careers360.mobi/media/uploads/froala\\_editor/files/LSAT-practice-set.pdf](https://cache.careers360.mobi/media/uploads/froala_editor/files/LSAT-practice-set.pdf)\n\n[https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/nav\\_date.do](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/nav_date.do)\n\n[https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/)\n\nYou can go to law school with any degree and you can work in any area of law with any undergraduate education. However, some degrees are better to have for specific areas of law. For example, it is very difficult to get a job in intellectual property law without a STEM degree. \"Pre-law\" degrees are generally considered to be useless and will not help prepare you for the LSAT or law school. You should only be pursuing one of these degrees if you enjoy the content and think you can do well in it, and you are confident that you will end up going to law school. These are essentially law school or bust-type programs.\n\nYou can go into real estate and corporate law with any degree. However, employers in these fields do like to hire lots of people with business degrees and corporate experience. Corporate lawyers engage in corporate activities and provide legal services to small businesses, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. Thus, a business degree would be ideal if you want to go into real estate or corporate law. A social work degree would be nice to have if you want to work in family law but it is not necessary.\n\nCriminology and law and society, like most social sciences and humanities programs, have little to do with law school or being a real estate/corporate lawyer. Law firms would just see these degrees as being general social sciences programs. It will not prevent you from working in real estate or corporate law, but it will not help you either. You would simply be doing these degrees as a stepping stone to get into law school. By itself, these degrees do not have strong job prospects. I would recommend a program that provides a more well-rounded education and career opportunities, such as political science, public administration, sociology, french, communications, psychology, and economics. Philosophy is also a good option as it would help with the logical reasoning required on the LSAT and in law school.",

Same goes for Professor Domenikos, the exams are quite intense from what I have heard. She can get quite technical, I've sat in on a few of her lectures. If you want an actual easy A take something like GEOG 1000 or ENVS 1011.",

They are welcome to not to take the course, or taste it first weeks, then free to drop the course. \n\nThe reason I mentioned those courses is, whoever takes the course, no matter they got A or B, the course was super easy to them. \n\nAlso, these courses are not widely mentioned, is why I decided to mention those.",

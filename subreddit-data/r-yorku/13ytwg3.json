It has mostly group work and presentations, but overall it\u2019s not a heavy work load in my opinion. The assignments were pretty straight forward &amp; as long as everyone holds their weight in your group, you\u2019ll do great:))",

But we didn\u2019t actually go anywhere it was just more interactive lessons that would have us more engaged versus the professor just talking for the whole class time. for example going into breakout rooms with groups of ppl &amp; answering quick questions about the lecture",

Some more than others. It truly is genetic. Also I\u2019ve realized that maybe south Asians have a much stronger natural body order than other races (even though every race can stink like shit) is because of their diets. Extremely fatty foods, oils and fat, in their cultural diets will have an extreme effect on their B.O. I love some Indian food, but I can\u2019t help but notice the insane reaction my body gets from it. My farts stink crazily when it comes to Indian food so I can only believe it has something to do with their B.O. it can definitely be contained by Deordorant tho, however some peoples Bo might be too strong.",

Are there certain religions that don't allow for the use of these products because 9/10 its always some middle eastern folk who absolutely reek of B.O. (I've seen other races smell as well but this has just been the vast majority based on my experiences). I've seen people mention that its the foods they cook with or whatnot but thats just not true because I've made foods from different cultures before and I've never had a problem with smelling bad afterwords. Shower once a day at least and wear some deodorant, its really not that hard, some of you smell like absolute shit. I swear york should do a hygiene course thats required and show some of these folks how to properly clean themselves because I'm Honestly not sure if people know how to which is sad and embarrassing.",

Sometimes it\u2019s passed down from parents who grew up poor so it can take a generation or two to adapt. And sometimes it\u2019s lazy parenting combined with everyone being too afraid to speak up because god forbid someone might be offended. I\u2019ve had points in my life where I smelled quite awful I\u2019m sure and I still feel bad for the poor souls around me at the time lol",

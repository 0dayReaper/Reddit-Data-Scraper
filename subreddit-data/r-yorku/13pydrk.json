Thank you in advance to anyone willing to provide guidance! \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference in taking the BA or BSc pathway in the program in regards to becoming a Psychiatrist? \n\nDo the job opportunities differ if I take the BA route? Do I need a BSc to become a psychiatrist? \n\nWhat further education is required after, as well as the pre-requisites if I want to become a psychiatrist? \n\nCan I take my Law &amp; Society program offer and pursue a career in psychology after?",

            "comment": "I am currently taking Psychology BA Honours because and I also want to be a psychiatrist. I am currently going to my 3rd year. The only difference is that Psyc BSc has an extra computer course and an extra math course you have to take, along with taking 2 science courses. Computers, math and bio and chem are not required for Psyc BA. But, I am taking my science courses as electives anyway because the MCAT is very bio and chem heavy. So both Psyc BA and BSc are good for med school. Pick whichever one you prefer. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "To become a psychiatrist, you need to go to medical school and perform at the top of your class in medical school to secure a psychiatry residency. 80% of medical students go into family medicine. Residencies like psychiatry and pediatrics are some of the most competitive to land in medical school. You can go to medical school with any degree and there are few prerequisites. However, medical school acceptance rates are less than 10% in Canada.\n\nThus, if your main goal is to be a psychiatrist, you need to be doing a significant amount of research into the medical school admissions process and psychiatry residencies. if you do not go to medical school, you would still need to pursue a master's degree to work in the psychology field as a counsellor or therapist. You would need to be comfortable with biology, chemistry, and statistics to work in the psychology field even if you were to pursue the bachelor of arts option.\n\nLaw &amp; Society is more geared towards people that want to go to law school or a career in law enforcement. If you want to work in the psychology field, do a psychology degree. You can take the first year psychology course as an elective and declare your major in psychology.",

One, as above, requires you to obtain an MD and specialize in psychiatry. The other requires a PhD in psychology. You could also consider social work or a master's degree in counseling",

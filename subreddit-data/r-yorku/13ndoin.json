For SU courses you might see thing like \u201cenrolment not recommended after May 15th\u201d or \u201cno enrolment after last day to drop courses\u201d policies like this are the prof looking out for you. But there may be exceptions. Maybe do some research this weekend and email the profs of courses you\u2019re interested in, or try enrolling and see what happens. We\u2019re 3 weeks in now, so catching up might not be easy, but maybe you can work that out successfully.",

May 22, but again, it's likely unwise to add a six-credit SU course now.  Catching up might be challenging.\n\nYou could add a three-credit SU course now, and a three-credit S2 course later.  That would give you a total of six credits for the summer term.\n\nWhy didn't you enrol a few weeks ago?",

            "comment": "Econ 1530/40 is real basic, and prof goes real slow, easy A+ tbh. You might die doing math 1310, if you've never done calc before, a lot of proofs and formal maths that you might struggle with. Math 1013/1014 is a lot of application for engineering, so brush up on your trig, if you want to take them.\n\nNo idea for the rest, but i assume they would be easier than 1300/1310 or 1013/1014.",

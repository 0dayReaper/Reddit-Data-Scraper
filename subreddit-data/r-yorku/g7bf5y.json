Look at these comments I have seen in the profs' emails:\n\n\"The amount of time allowed is 2 hours, and I'll allow an extra hour for submission\"\n\n\"It's a 3-hour open-book exam, you are expected to include your assessment of the real-world problems in your answers.\"\n\n\"You'll have more than enough time to complete the exam since it's open book\"\n\nSo, if you're a prof who thinks that all the students are just sleeping in their house 24/7 worrying nothing, have more time than usual to study, have excellent mental health and are barely affected by the ongoing pandemic, and therefore deserve a way harder exam, you're a piece of shit.",

            "comment": "Honestly, with people like me with a bunch of mental health disorders like MDD, BPD, GAD, and other ones... do profs really think I have time to do 5 assignments, 4 labs, 3 quizzes and a final? I barely have time to find the will to live during this pandemic, cut me some slack. My family is in another country, I'm alone in Canada, I have personal issues and already struggled with school as it was. Stop making finals harder! If the material was hard enough when it was more simple, now that you amped the difficulty I'm in a constant state of panic and crisis. Online exams are a chance to continue our education from our homes and not get covid-19, but if you're wrecking our mental health it'll be as detrimental as getting a physical illness.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some profs have been great and super understanding so they should be praised (example datta and aram), some should seriously reevaluate their empathy and compassion levels.\n\nLike I'm trying but this semester has been fucked. Started with bronchitis, then costochondritis, 3 hospital visits, turned into a panic disorder from being physically ill and missing pretty much the first month of class, then got a stomach virus beginning of feb and finally coronavirus hit. MY LUCK LOL",

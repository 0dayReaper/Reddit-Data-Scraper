There\u2019s not enough time to finish and scan and upload handwritten answers in 20 minute time frame! \n\nDuring a review session a student asked TA to go over the mock exam question and he said \u201coh I don\u2019t have the solution and to read question and get answer would take too much time.\u201d\n\nThen how do you expect us to read answer and upload in 20 minutes?! \n\nI\u2019m so drained!",

And they required we be on zoom during exam to take attendance and show us on video and us show our student card... which is fine but he started zoom ten minutes early, went over technical and academic honest rereading the info on the midterm eclass page we already read. Then took attendance during exam talking in our ear and disrupting already crazy time limit. \n\nWe got extra 15 minutes at end of finish uploading last question. So 22.5 minutes per question to hand write and scan(or picture) then upload to computer and upload to eclass. I didn\u2019t finish one question. \n\nPandemic is stressful enough, they could be kind to us instead of making it harder because no proctoring and online. Give us a pass! People are scared. 1000 a course is a lot with this much stress.",

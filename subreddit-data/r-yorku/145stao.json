In that session, they will tell you what to take and they will unlock your account. \n\nAlso, if you are taking an elective that says it's reserved just keep trying. Don't immediately switch to something else. They usually open up the spots near the end of the summer. \nThey reserve those spots for people in that major.\n\nFinally, please Google your profs. Don't take someome just  because there is an open spot. Keep your spot in that one class, but keep checking regularly to see if a spot opens up in other sections. People take and drop course all the time. So don't panic if it says the class is full. \n\nGood luck on your first year!!",

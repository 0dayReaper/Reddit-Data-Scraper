His class \"Cities in Film\" was one of my favourites before they shut the Urban Studies department down. He is an extremely fair marker and will provide comprehensive feedback. You'll be in good hands.",

He\u2019s a nice guy too. From what I remember there was a small writing assignement, and a test as well based on some novels assigned",

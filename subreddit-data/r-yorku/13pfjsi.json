    "postText": "I need some advice. I was emailed back sometime in the first week of May by the grad audit people that in order to graduate,  program requirements must be fulfilled by May 24th (tomorrow).\n\nAll I needed at that point was my grade for a 6 credit elective philosophy course, and at this point the grade STILL SHOWS NGR. \n\nMay 5th, the prof sends an announcement stating grades will be posted next week. I think, alright, we\u2019re good. \n\nAnd now it is Monday, May 15th. It still says NGR? I email the prof, and on the next day, gets back to me and says that they will be submitted by the end of the week. I check constantly, nearly every hour throughout the entire weekend. Now it is the AMs of Tuesday 23rd, and IT IS STILL DAMN NGR!?\n\nI had already emailed her shortly after her reply last Tuesday, as well as the grad audit people and the philosophy department on the weekend, of course not getting a reply cause everyone\u2019s off. \n\nProbably not getting a reply in time throughout the Tuesday, and will be lucky to get a response Wednesday when it\u2019s already too late! \n\nMy question is, is there literally anything I can do on York campus to remedy this? \n\nI really don\u2019t want to postpone grad just because ONE PROFESSOR from an ELECTIVE COURSE was not able to mark in time, one month after the school year ended. Please help!!!!",

I just was constantly bugging my home faculty and the department which offered the course for the grade until I got it last Wednesday. It should be up by today 4pm honestly and the degree audit departments are gonna be busy coming back from long weekend. Stay patient (I know u have and it\u2019s stressful) u should have the grade and ur status updated by today. U can dm me to ask further questions or talk about it!",

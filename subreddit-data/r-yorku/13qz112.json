    "postText": "The enrolment tutorial said to choose a course outside of my major and it shouldn't be a general education course. I'm a BCOM student and my major is basically ADMS courses. I took ADMS 2541 (personal finance) as the course. \nI also searched up my programs requirements, but I didn't see personal finance in the major courses. When I checked my degree progress report, it showed it as major. But in the picture I attached, it says you can also have a free choice and it can be a ADMS course. Is the course I took okay according to all this? I'm really confused I would appreciate if some1 can help me thanks.",

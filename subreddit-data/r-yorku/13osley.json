I had no hot running water in the bathroom for the first 3 months, our hot plate regularly malfunctioned, our microwave broke, the ceiling leaked, and there was mold everywhere. However, I had friends also staying in Calumet and their experiences were fine. It just will depend on the unit you get I guess.",

            "comment": "I took GER 1791 in 2020 and LOVED it! It\u2019s still one of my favourite courses I have taken at YU. It\u2019s not a very reading or watching heavy courses, and it also opens your eyes to different tropes and hidden messages within fairy tales. I\u2019d highly recommend it especially with Prof Karen Lurkhur.",

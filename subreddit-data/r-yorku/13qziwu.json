I try to be friendly and nice to people in my classes but I still can't seem to make a single friend after a year and a half here.\n\nUsually meet someone, share some socials like ig or whatsapp and then after a few weeks they unfollow or delete me. \n\nWhat is everyone else's experience in trying to make new friends at York? Is this common for everyone too?",

I\u2019m glad to say that i made plenty of friends my first year. obviously, having good qualities like personality matter as well, but your looks are the first thing that people see so of course they matter.",

As a woman who is definitely not considered conventionally attractive by any means, I have been approached a fair amount around campus by people asking for directions, and have had classmates initiate conversations with me about assignment/content clarifications/exams/etc. I don\u2019t even put myself out there that much because I\u2019m a very shy, introverted person, but even I have made a few friends. Do I think attractiveness helps when making friends? Sure, it might make people more likely to approach you. But it doesn\u2019t keep them.",

If they are, screw them and good riddance, they were probably going to be bad friends anyway. The biggest part of forming and keeping friendship is both parties initiating hangouts and feeling comfortable around one another. Definitely keep trying, maybe join a few clubs to see people more constantly. If people end up ghosting you, they lost you, you didn\u2019t lose them.",

Or we'll hang out once (only bc I asked them if they wanted to) and never again. I'm so done\n\n\nIt's about how you look but also your personality/vibe. You should seem interesting, cool, fun, &amp; easy going. Those kind of people attract people. \n\nI recommend participating in class &amp; talking to people sitting next to you to put yourself out there",

I make an effort now to have a pleasant look on my face and if someone looks right at me I smile. Watch the people around you and see who else is always sitting alone. It's too hard to get in with groups. There are lots of other people like you who are alone and looking for a friend. Approach them and ask them for help with a problem, or compliment them on their hair or clothing. Join some clubs to find people with whom you have common interests. Be sure to ask them questions that show you have an interest in their family, past, travels, interests, etc. and require an explanation besides just yes or no. Don't monopolize the conversation. Encourage them. Don't be critical.  And smile!",

Best way to do that though is look into some clubs, some meetup groups or bumble bff hives",

            "comment": "It's important to make friends with the same interests.  Friendships are like any other relationships you must offer as much as you expect.  So if you play a sport you will make friends with people who play that sport so they have someone to play with.  If you then make this relationship more than that it must be something the other party wants too.  If you plan to after go for drinks you must have other things to offer as well such as not being a detriment to the situation.  Looks matter but less so if you have other things to offer such charisma.  If you look like a bum and don't shower less people will want to be with you if this is not something appreciate.  If you are hyper sensitive and want to be with chill people and they are going to get rid of you.  If you are in engineering then find people from that program.  Just remember you have value too the key is to learn how to communicate it in a way that is pleasant to others.\n\nOther than interests you need to find people with the same values.  You must explore and put yourself out there don't just get numbers and ig go and spend time together that is the only way to make real friends.  Just make sure to stay safe and don't do things you will regret in order to fit in.  You don't have to participate in drugs or anything like that to be in the group you can still be welcome if you just are genuine and not bringing people down.\n\nGood luck op I made my best friends in College.  And if you can't do it there it's on you so take risks don't be shy and try new things talk to others go sing karaoke talk to the opposite sex and get rejected 1000 times with an open mind and you will learn a lot.  Remember only half the people are above average the other half is below.  So a lot of people are ugly but they don't have to also be loners",

Start studying a week before and rewatch all the material at least twice in this time. \n\nThis means that you should conpletely retake your notes 2 times before any test\n\nFor exams, I start 3 weeks early and try to retake ALL my notes 3+ times\n\nOh yea, and always start EARLY, do not leave anything to the last moment\n\n\nGl!!!",

My sleep schedule is not ideal but I try to follow what I wrote below: \n\nTry to go to sleep around 11:00-12:00 and wake up whenever your body wakes you up. Going to sleep at 2-3AM(even if you sleep 8hrs or so) will not create the melatonin you need and will most definitely not treat you well long term. \n\nYou will be wayyyyy more productive when well rested! Oh, and waking up at around 9:00 is awesome! Btw, if you haven't already, I would recommend working out on chill days as it will make you far more productive long term. Cheers and gl!",

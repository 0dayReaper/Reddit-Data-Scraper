You study and you will get what you want. Dont trust rate my prof.\nLabs are 35% of your course worth. Do well in them. People do an absolute crap in labs and expect to get A. \nYou need to study for this course. It might be one of your best courses to choose at york. \nEnded up A+.",

My friends and I all had the same issues with her. \n\nShe assigned insanely long textbook portions to be read for class (sure I guess they\u2019re helpful) but then during class, just regurgitated the information word to word, she also weirdly refused to elaborate on any of it? \n\nShe consistently berated students for asking questions, did these weird jeopardy clicker quizzes at the end of class and got angry when students wanted to leave on time for other classes when she\u2019d be running late because of her own poor organization and time management. \n\nAll her tests were basically a combination of questions lifted from the back of the textbook (found on quizlet) and random questions based on concepts we never discussed in class. \n\nThe labs were interesting, the TAs were helpful but there was very little guidance in terms of how to write the reports and calculate all the values. \n\nShe also told us we\u2019d be able to review our midterms after writing them and then stopped answering student emails after we asked her to review them.\n\nEdit: I finished the course with an A (no thanks to her)",

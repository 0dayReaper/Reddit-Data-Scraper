    "postText": "So I'm looking for res for the next school year atm, but it would be nice to live directly on campus too. I am looking for options for the village, however I know for the top tier res, its too late (if the other tier res ars available, I might look into it too). I guess the reason for this post is to see if someone is subleasing the quad or pond in the fall, and potentially someone else in the winter (don't think its viable that they would do both\ud83d\ude05). If some is doing so, let me know and we could negotiate price points for it. Its more so just to live with more privacy rather than living in a group. Cheers",

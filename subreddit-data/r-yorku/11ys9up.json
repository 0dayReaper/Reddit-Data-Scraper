                                                    "comment": "Sex is an arbitrary word. For starters as it isn\u2019t binary and more importantly is made up of things which we have the power to change. Sex is made up of 4 things. Anatomy, karyotype, gene expression and hormone levels. We can change 3 of the 4 and altho we can\u2019t change a karyotype, it also has no real function outside of fetal stage. We already know of a intersex condition which the persons karyotype is atypical. It\u2019s called 46 xx/xy those ppl have the same chromosomes as a cisgender person but they have the sexual anatomy of the polar opposite. \n\nAside from the definition meaning nothing. We also don\u2019t like being seen as objects. We\u2019re people first and for most. When ppl say things like \u201cmale pretending to be a\u201d/\u201cfemale identifying as a\u201d they are saying they\u2019re fake men/women and or choosing to be trans. We didn\u2019t choose to be trans. It\u2019s just how we were born. Just like you can\u2019t choose if your left or right handed. You also can\u2019t choose your gender or orientation. (With the exception to bisexuals who can\u2019t control being bisexual but they can choose their partner and who they act on showing sexual affection to)\n\nTransgender ppl are their gender they say they are. We don\u2019t choose it but if we live in the closet and push it away we become depressed and dysphoric and without a good accepting support system we become suicidal just like anyone would if they were constantly being told they\u2019re a freak and monster and that ppl want to &gt;!kill them.!&lt;\n\nAll trans ppl do is get to a point where we feel comfortable being ourselves or to the point where gonna Unalive ourselves if we don\u2019t start living as ourselves. \n\nPut yourself in our shoes. If I found a way to put you in a body of what we call the opposite sex you might find it cool at first but you know your still a guy/girl as that\u2019s how you were born. Let\u2019s say your a guy for this example. I turned your body into a \u201cfemale\u201d body. You still know your a guy but nobody else can see it cuz your body says woman. Everyone calls you a girl and belittles you when you try to explain your a guy and your body dosnt match how you feel/how you see yourself. Now let\u2019s say you transition back to being a guy but everyone now still sees you as a girl and threatens to beat you up, disown you, rape you, and or kill you because your not living as a woman like your body said your supposed to be. You\u2019d get dysphoric and suicidal as hell like many trans ppl in that situation are.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to hurt anyone or have special privileges. We just want to be gendered correctly, have access to medical care and the right to education and sports. And to play on the correct teams. \n\nAs for sports if your gonna say theirs an advantage of trans women playing think about this. How many trans women have you seen make it to the Olympics. We\u2019ve been allowed to play for 20 years now, surely we would have been winning titles by now. Ms Thompson lost. That body builder lost. Mack beggs was a trans man on testosterone being forced to play against women cuz his state wouldn\u2019t recognize him as a man \ud83d\ude44 sports aren\u2019t fair, you have hight differences, weight differences, strength differences.speed differences. As long as someone has the similar hormones composition as their opponent we tend to allow them to play saying it\u2019s fair. But cuz someone\u2019s trans we suddenly freak out? That\u2019s ridiculous. Did ms Thompsons dick give her more muscle and less drag? Lmao of course not. Yes trans women retain a lot of muscle mass however to build muscle you need testosterone. Unless the trans woman has had bottom surgery she will need to suppress testosterone putting her testosterone levels far lower then a cisgender woman meaning for a trans woman to build muscle she will have to work a lot harder and she will fatigue a lot faster and for a lot longer then her cisgender opponents. Overall tho even that dosnt matter because trans women aren\u2019t winning! If I went to any college or school and asked the sports club how many trans ppl are on their team. I bet most won\u2019t be able to say because we rarely play sports and when we try to we\u2019re pushed out or even banned in some places. \n\nTo get back to your question. It\u2019s rude to call trans men \u201cfemales identifying as men\u201d because they aren\u2019t female and they are men and your objectifying their body and othering them. Trans women want to be seen as women who are trans and trans men want to be seen as men who are trans. Just like you wouldn\u2019t call people who are black black ppl unless your saying they\u2019re lesser people. Just like you don\u2019t call people who are black \u201cblacks\u201d you also shouldn\u2019t call ppl who are transgender \u201ca trans\u201d adjectives aren\u2019t nouns. A noun is a person place or thing. An adjective is a word used to describe a trait of something. Like the man was tall or the dog was small. You wouldn\u2019t call someone small \u201ca small\u201d\n\nLong story short don\u2019t objectify ppl and don\u2019t other them. All they want to do if live their life like everyone else. We don\u2019t want our lives being a political debate. We just want to be treated normal like everyone else is. You don\u2019t have people banning the right to straight marriage, you don\u2019t have people denying straight ppl the right to vote, to healthcare, to education, or anything else. Don\u2019t ban our rights to that stuff ether!",

It disrupt the systematic functioning or neat arrangement of the socially expected behaviours. Ppl who are intersex 46xx/xy can reproduce perfectly fine and it dosnt make them stupid. As a mater of fact you could easily be 46 xx/xy and not know it as doctors don\u2019t test your karyotype to determine your sex. They just look at your bits and call it a day. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nMate you just contradicted your own point by even acknowledging them let alone saying \u201cin most cases\u201d the fact their is is outside cases means sex isn\u2019t binary thus is meaningless. Not to mention the fact we use the very same principles that intersex conditions effect and we purposely cause them in transgenders people so they get the outcome they want. Also the endocrinology literally agrees trans ppl exist and are valid lol. You literally need one to transition \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 endocrinology literally is all about how hormones effect the body.  Your chromosomes mainly only affects your dry gene that dictates how your genitalia is going to form. Having an intersex condition can negatively affect your health as some conditions affect your organs. The standard person has 46 chromosomes and only 2 are xx or xy. When they fall short or extra it has effects on the body outside of sexual functions. However the fact remains that because they exist it breaks the concept of sex being a thing. What is dose show us is that sex is a categorical term for different processes in people. Outside of mammals it was broken a long time ago with worms and fish being hermaproditic creatures and in some cases intersex in relation to human beings typical sex role (I\u2019m referring to seahorse dads caring the baby to term)\n\nBirds also break the typical sex concept as they have a cloaca and in some ducks they\u2019re cloaca leads into different areas so it\u2019s harder to get pregnant. Hyenas also break that concept with the fact they have a persudopenis. \n\nTo bring that back to humans our genitals are made of the same tissue from default. We all started off with an x cromesone. The sperm Carry\u2019s an x or a Y chromosome to finish the sequence. When your in fetal stage your vaginal lips can seal making the balls, the clitoris elongates making the penis, and the overies decend becoming testicles. Don\u2019t believe me? Look at the images of a penis  and clitoris anatomy. They look pretty similar aside from being turned inside out and being burried in the body. Plus it\u2019s backed up by the fact that trans men who take testosterone grow a T dick. (Their \u201cclitoris\u201d grows outward and gets bigger and harder and looks more like a micro penis. Even more so when they get a clotoral release. \n\nLong story short sex is a very broken concept which atm means basically nothing. And the more we advance surgical procedures the less it\u2019s going to mean. I mean trans women are rn being studied to see if we can get uterine transplants and so far it\u2019s looking successful. If it is then what makes a male or female? We\u2019re more like meat machines. You plug in a part and it will do the rest. Granted you use anti rejection medication or get a bio identical transplant via stem cell grown organs.\n\nA more basic analogy to show how broken sex is is to use Color\u2019s. When does blue become green? At what point on the Color wheel does it become green? In different languages lightblue is green and dark blue isn\u2019t green. They still exist but the way we look at them is flawed it\u2019s not binary. It\u2019s a spectrum.",

I am forced to tolerate this because it is also what a majority of society\u2019s beliefs align with, this is an example of society being intolerant of what matters to me, as a cisgender biological male who wishes to share his male spaces with other cisgender biological men only. I have nothing \u201cagainst\u201d trans people, I just think that having a \u201cMen\u2019s\u201d washroom is pointless if people who are physically and biologically not male can use that space alongside me.\n\nI should be able to have a space where I interact with biological men and biological men only, if I wanted to be in a space with biological men and women then I would use a non-gendered/ gender-neutral restroom. \n\nAs a cisgender man I have no safe space because I am expected to share my male space with people who are biologically female simply because they identify themselves as male, which I accept, but that does not make me any more comfortable about being expected to share my male washroom with people who are still fundamentally female in every aspect aside from their clothed appearance.",

What are you gonna be then, the penis police? You can\u2019t sex base bathrooms because you can\u2019t be checking people\u2019s genitals without being a perv. You can\u2019t be sure of, nor should you want to know or care about, what is in someone\u2019s pants. There is more than genitals that are a defining traits of either gender. Do you really think cis women wanna share a bathroom with a male-socialized, male-looking and male-sounding person? Would that not make them uncomfortable? Nobody\u2019s looking at each other\u2019s genitals in the bathroom (except pervs, but that\u2019s a whole other issue), everything that\u2019s visible continues to be the divisor in gendered bathrooms. (And yes, I think you should mostly pass as the gender you identify with if you\u2019re going to use that bathroom)\n\nNot that I am a fan of the tampons in men\u2019s bathrooms thing. Weirdly unnecessary and grossly over progressive especially when you consider baby changing tables don\u2019t even exist there. The number of trans men ever finding themselves needing a tampon in the men\u2019s bathroom is going to be extremely small. Must be some loud voices pushing for this kind of thing\u2026",

No state or individual should have control over what an adult wants to do with their body.\n\nMy issue begins is when you have the state firce people to believe that Man == Woman using flimsy reasoning to back up your claim.\n\nEvery single article you posted uses some of the most innane logic to justify why \"periods are not exclusive to women\" or \"sex is not immutable\".\n\nFor \"sex is not immutable\" they essentially make the argument that \"because some people have 6 fingers and not 5 (because they have a genetic abnormality) that means it is wrong to say people generally have 5 fingers on each hand.\nThis is obviously a great oversimplification but it gets my point accross.\nGender theory requires such insane devotion to completely inanne ideas like \"periods are just things some bodies do :)\" (and not something that women have because they have a uterus) that literal children can smell the BS. If a child can easily break your \"theory\" down it's probably not a good theory.\n\nIt is embarassing to me that 2+2 has become 5.",

Called me a bit of time later for an \"interview\" in Oakville. This troglodyte ate a sandwich throughout the whole interview while trying and failing to flirt with the receptionist at the beginning. The whole \"job\" was cold-calling people to invest money with Manulife. With NO PAY. This fuck even said that in 6 months you might get a job and some pregnant lady did that unpaid job for months. Anyway I was too young and shy to tell that guy to fuck off and complain to his supervisor. Fuck that guy. Lesson learned.",

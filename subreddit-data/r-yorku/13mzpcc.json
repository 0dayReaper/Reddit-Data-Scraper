However, the cons are rarely ever in the courses you take. They are in other aspects such as a social life and safety. If i were you and I would go for UofT, it is also in the top 3 in terms of quality of education, but it improves on the other aspects that make up a proper University Student life lol. The cons of UofT is that it's really grindy, pretty much you'll always be busy.",

(I\u2019m trying to be a hs teacher that\u2019s why such random major/minors) does this seem like a good schedule? I feel like I should\u2019ve picked more stuff in my major but I really wanna figure out my minor first. Also this is as smushed together as I could make it, most of these classes only had one or two time slots.",

The schedule looks fine, just remember your current schedule gives you no break in between classes, meaning you will have no time to buy food unless you plan on bringing it. I can't speak on the other courses but obviously as an English major just be expected to read a lot and manage your time well with whatever work you will be given in your other courses. Having Fridays off in your first semester and 2 days off in your second is really nice, especially if you plan on working on joining some school clubs.",

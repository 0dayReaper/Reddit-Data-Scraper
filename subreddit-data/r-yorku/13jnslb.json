I have had the opportunity to take a large number of challenging and interesting courses in my major (Math/CS).\n2. I have been fortunate to have quite a few opportunities to perform research and be mentored by professors in both faculties.\n3. I have been given very generous funding for my studies throughout my 4 years here to the point that I have literally turned a profit attending York.\n4. While the composition of the student body is a bit hit and miss (essentially divided between serious students and those whose mentalities are still in high school), almost all students I know are pleasant to interact with and a good number among you are very driven and accomplished.\n5. The hot dog stand in front of Vari Hall.\n6. Campus during warm weather.\n7. Many of the newer buildings/classrooms.\n8. The proximity of the subway stations (I often park at York and take the subway downtown for, say, a Leafs game).\n\nCons:\n\n1. The heavy traffic/construction around campus, particularly at Steeles and Finch Avenues.\n2. Slim pickings for food (although I Swear by the hot dog stand in front of Vari).\n3. The unfair perception that the relatively-weak academic entrance requirements at this school imply that every student here is mediocre and that the school itself and its academics are mediocre, neither of which necessarily follow from the premise.\n4. York's apparent philosophical decision to be a large school that caters to everyone instead of aspiring to augment its world standing as a large research university (i.e. by raising academic standards further/raising entrance requirements/more funding for research).\n\nJury's Out:\n\n1. Will I be able to find suitable employment on graduation? Am hopeful but who knows.\n2. Will I be able to embark on suitable graduate studies on graduation? Am hopeful but who knows.\n\nPerhaps I will be able to answer the last two in a couple of years.",

It\u2019s ultimately grad school that propels a university into becoming a major research force. Some of York\u2019s grad programs do perform quite well for specific fields and some others may be on track to do so as well. York also has Schulich, widely considered one of the best business schools in the country.",

No university can be that much of a well-kept secret...",

The research aspect they typically mentioned have more so to do with the work professors at the university are engaged in. Most of the top ranked universities when it comes to research are usually those that have multiple Nobel laureates conducting groundbreaking research. York and Canadian universities in general don\u2019t have many laureates as professors currently.",

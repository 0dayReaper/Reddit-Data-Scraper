    "postText": "So I got into York u comp sci in December and have done everything required for the school like paying the  $750 housing deposit, $150 application for housing deposit and I\u2019ve even enrolled in courses. I also got a 40k scholarship at york with a 6k entrance scholarship so I was 100% going there. Today I got into u of t comp sci with coop but with a 3k entrance scholarship so now I\u2019m a bit stuck on what to do. Yes I want to go to York but I never thought I would get into u of t so now I don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice?",

UofT will help since it has the name value which would help you get noticed more, but not something you can't do at York if you  put in the effort. Plus not having to worry about tuition would be a big plus if you choose the scholarship at York. I'm doing CS at Lassonde, and I find the program well structured and the profs amazing apart from a few exceptions. The only complain I have at York is their enrollment/registrar services, no idea what it's like at UofT",

It\u2019ll alleviate a lot of financial stress you may have and allow you to focus on your studies. UTSC CS doesn\u2019t have the same level of respect as UT Saint George CS. I\u2019m in my fourth year of CS at York and it\u2019s been great.",

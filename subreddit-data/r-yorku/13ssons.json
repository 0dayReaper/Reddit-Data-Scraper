    "postText": "I need to raise my GPA by dropping a course that ended one year ago. However, I had deferred standing and the professor did not get back to me last December when I said I was able to hand in the assignments since my circumstances changed and i was now able to focus. My living situation caused me to not be able to complete the assignments and I feel like this is a valid reason to not have handed in my assignments because the course was all online. I also have email threads to multiple professors telling them about my circumstances to make sure I complete my work or inform them of what is going on, and since I have gotten out of that living situation, my grades and mental clarity have improved drastically, which is evident by me passing all my winter classes. I received a failing grade for the deferred course last month, but I'm wondering if I can still petition to withdraw late since I had deferred standing, and since i have email threads that show that I asked the professor if i could still hand in my assignments but she didnt respond. Last december is when i moved from that living situation and was able to finally focus. I even dropped my fall 2022 courses because of this and added 2 electives for winter that I completed. \n\nKnowing the context of my situation, does anyone think I have a chance?",

You\u2019d have to write a letter outlining the reasons and since you\u2019re submitting it late you\u2019ll also have to include reasons why you\u2019re petitioning so late too. \n\nYou can dm me if you need help with the process",

I emailed the professor in September asking to hand in the assignments the following week (i was still in the living situation) she responded to that email saying i could hand them in, but then i emailed her in December after i got out of the living situation, starting the email with \u201ci know it has been 2 months\u201d and then informed her of what happened and asked to hand the in assignments  like i said in my original post and she never responded. Knowing this, Do you still think i have a chance ? Thanks for replying !",

Your chances are not as good if you just ended up emailing again at the end of the semester and not doing the work. \n\nAs all petitions, you\u2019re gonna have to explain the circumstances around your performance and provide documentation to support your case. Since you\u2019re also submitting it late, you\u2019ll need to justify why you\u2019re submitting late as well.",

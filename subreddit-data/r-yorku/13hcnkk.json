But Physio is highly competitive depending on where you plan on going, but I believe York\u2019s kine courses is a good set up for physio in the future fs!",

But I know many of my peers did the athletic therapy one and some have gotten into physio, occupational therapy, one got into a Masters of Fitness Sci, etc. so it does seem like a good box to check off if you do decide to branch into any of these just because theres the added experience/knowledge or just to have under your belt in general if you have the time for it",

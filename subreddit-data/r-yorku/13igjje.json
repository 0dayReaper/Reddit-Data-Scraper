I got it as a gift and while I was walking to class (in Vari Hall if that helps) from the subway I might have dropped it somewhere\n\nI checked the lost and found and there is nothing there and I am so scared because that was all the money I brought (and it was not even mine, I owe my friend that).\n\nIf anyone happened to have seen it, pls help me out (or pm me)\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso, I lost it today (Monday) i think in the morning",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm a third year undergraduate student at yorku studying in the bcom itec program. Atm ive been working as a QA analyst intern, but I dont make any money from working as an intern. Ive been thinking to quit and find an entry IT job since my family is not financially stable and I have bills to pay.\n\nSo far, its been hard. I've been feeling so down and depressed lately cuz I have been rejected to so many job postings and applications, and its been so hard to find a job, relating to my field. I even tried applying for banking jobs like a bank teller job, but got rejected (which is weird cuz I have over 1 year of customer service skills and experience). I decided to make a linkedin acc (got premium), and reach out to recruiters but most of them dont even respond. Does anyone have any advice on how to get an entry IT role or banking role?  Btw I dont wanna do an internship again, cuz i dont wanna delay my graduation.\n\nSrry for my rant and thanks for reading.",

            "comment": "You shouldn't have accepted a voluntary internship in the first place. I have friends who worked as QA previously and they all said that they barely do anything or learn there. There were so many other things you could've done instead of doing the unpaid internship, such as projects. \n\nYou might want to look at your resume again and fill in any white space with important stuff. Cs is becoming overstaturated every single term with barely any jobs. You might want to learn some new skills because everyone can do basic IT stuff. What makes you special? \n\nFor LinkedIn, make sure you have enough connections and not 0. Most of the time recruiters ghost people. An alternative would be to reach out to the people who currently work in the company. \n\nAnd yea, make sure you are constantly applying to internships/new grad roles.",

Make sure your resume is good as well - get it reviewed",

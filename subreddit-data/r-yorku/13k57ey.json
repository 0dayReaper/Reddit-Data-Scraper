    "postText": "hi! is anyone here taking ger1791 for their elective? if so, which section did you guys enrol in - A or B? because when I was enrolling, I noticed that section a only had tutorials, whereas section B had a lecture + tutorial, so im confused which one I'm supposed to choose. I chose A at the moment since that's what fit in my schedule.",

The homepage actually explains what it means if there is no time or day posted. Also, BLEN(blended) means the classes will be a mix of in person learning along with online or asynchronous.",

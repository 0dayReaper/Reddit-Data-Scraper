But even on a Sunday Morning mid summer we got people super setting on multiple machines or using three sets of dumbbells, and they have the audacity to ask me \"HoW mAnY sEts YoU gOt LeFt?\" I only go to York's gym because commercial gyms will ruin my bank account. And to finally answer your question yes you need a YU card and there's like a $20 fee for access to the fitness center which last 3 terms (fall, winter, summer). Log in here https://reconline.yorkulions.ca/ to get the membership and activate your YU card.",

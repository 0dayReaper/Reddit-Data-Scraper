If you absorb it well, and understand when and why you use what's taught,  you'll be in a good position for an excellent career.\n\nYorks reputation is better than most students or professors, global rankings would have you think.  Some interviews I thought I didn't have the job,  until I mentioned I took C.S at YorkU and their eyes lit up with interest.",

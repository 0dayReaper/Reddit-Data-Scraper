Where do people usually post about rooms these days? I want to know how to get a room faster, and if there are new different websites/ ways that people use to look for rooms.\n\n2) Is there a chance of more rooms becoming available from July? I am assuming that some people will graduate in June, and their rooms will get vacant from July.",

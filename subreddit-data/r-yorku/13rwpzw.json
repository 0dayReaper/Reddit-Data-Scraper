And you have to take one of the two options: Either a 9 credit course in SOSC and a 6 credit course in Humanities or a 6 credit course in SOSC and a 9 credit course in Humanities. For NATS, I truly recommend NATS 1700 with Vera Pavri, I enjoyed her class so much and got a really good grade. Welcome to IT :))",

    "postText": "So I'm a dance student and I recieved an email saying that my course enrollment appointment is on 25th May 12 pm. I had also recieved an email from my department AMPD stating that I'll receive an enrollment package with a success checklist, etc closer to my enrollment appointment.\n\nThe thing is when I logged onto my myfile, nothing really happened? Like there was no way of contacting someone or a link or anything which could help me enroll in my courses. I also haven't received any aforementioned emails and when I try to enroll by clicking on the registration and enrollment link it doesn't let me and shows an error message. \n\nI'm really confused as to what I should do as I have sent various emails to all my department, iadvisor and intleq and none of them have answered me. I also tried calling the registrar's office a few times but nobody picks up and it just has a few pre recorded facts about york lol\n\nI have no idea what I should do and if anyone is facing the same problem as me, please do let me know because what the hell",

    "postText": "I, F 17, am starting my first term at York in the fall. I am entering a Batchelor Of Arts program as a criminology major but I will be changing my major immediately apon my arrival at campus. I\u2019m having issues singing up for classes because of the the lack of direction I\u2019ve been given- what corses should one generally take in their first year? Is there any way to change my major before classes begin? This is a time sensitive issue so I would appreciate any guidance you are all willing to offer.",

Take a natural science general education course (i took human development)\n3. Take a 6 credit approved humanities general education course OR 9 credit social science approved general education course OR both.\n4. Take a course a outside your major (any course)\n\nYou can take anywhere from 24-30 credits in your first year.\n\nYou cannot change your major unless you have completed some courses at York. So after your first year, apply for a major change.",

Unless they list your major, Just ignore the automated voice telling u to press different numbers, and wait for them to answer, they will answer. Even if your on hold for awhile, they\u2019ll answer eventually. Then they can guide u on how to make the appointment.",

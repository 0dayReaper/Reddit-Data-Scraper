Further reading would often make me reevaluate what I just heard and helped me to understand that.",

But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to go. There\u2019s material in lectures that you may want and need. There\u2019s things to learn from interacting with prof and students. Sometimes profs will deliberately give info that is crucial to your success only in lectures. Missing a lecture is missing the experience you are paying $$$ for. They\u2019re not punishment they are your future. You\u2019re expected to be proactive in your academic experience and part of that is attending lectures, either in person or online. No one will chase you down if you don\u2019t attend. It\u2019s on you. Best of luck!",

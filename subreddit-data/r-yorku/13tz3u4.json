The day before i went through the slides just going through and passed easily.\n\nHonestly, take it and see the course outline, if you feel like you can do it then go ahead, if not just look for something that interests you",

Although yes it was a lot of work and required me to study and actually put time to look through the slides. the course doesn\u2019t have hard material it\u2019s just memorization. I would take my prof, it\u2019s 4 unit test instead of mid term and final\nwhich makes it way easier to study bevause it\u2019s all by section. His lectures are also great. I finished with an A it was great to learn astronomy with him. So basically it\u2019s not easy, not hard, just some work and ready to learn. that\u2019s it.",

For most people, university will be the last place where they're \"forced\" (by volition mostly and whatever extrinsic factors motivate you to keep going to class) to be around and interact with people who are mostly the same age (+/- a few years) that are in a very exploratory stage in life trying to solidify a social, personal, and professional identity. Once you graduate and enter the workforce, it feels like you're kind of liberated from the forced social boundaries that school sets in place and are left to try to navigate a much broader and loosely connected social world. Which I think makes finding relationships more difficult due to the loss of the inherent interconnectedness with other people that school imposes upon us. \n\nI do think dating apps have helped soften this problem and this isn't to say that your working environment can't be a place to find someone (im sure some will disagree lol) but I think university, and school more generally, offers a social environment that isn't really found anywhere else.",

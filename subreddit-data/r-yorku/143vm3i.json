    "postText": "Hello, I'm an undergraduate student going into Criminology and I had a couple questions about course registration.   \n\n\n1: I followed the instructions and added the courses on the registration page to register for courses. After picking them via \"add a course\" is that it and is there anything left to do?   \n2: I paid the 300$ for the deposit but now my YorkYu balance is negative?",

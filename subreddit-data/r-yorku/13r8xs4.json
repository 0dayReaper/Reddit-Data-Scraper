It's up to the professor to make the list of participants visible on eClass or not visible. Think about it - some students may not even want their names and emails shared with everyone in the class. \n\nIf you want to share some info with the class, like a WA group link, email the professor and they may agree to post the link on eClass as an announcement.",

That\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. If it\u2019s not there yet then perhaps it\u2019s not finalized or something yet.\n\nMore importantly, you might want to ask these people if they\u2019d like the chat link before emailing them out of the blue.",

            "comment": "Honestly not much. Biology isn\u2019t a really employable degree on its own. You can most likely be a research assistant; receptionist at a doctors office; get in a college program and work in the medical field after that (eg. Radiology, ultrasound/X-ray technician, RMT,etc. You can go to grad school (eg. Physiotherapy/physical therapy, etc); get some license to be a fitness instructor or personal trainer. Just some ideas",

If you want a wider variety you will need something post undergrad whether it\u2019s a certificate, masters, some form of med or pharma or any other post undergrad diplomas. It\u2019s difficult to get a good foot in with just a BSc alone. Nonetheless it is possible to get work with just a BSc whether it\u2019s clerical work or something similar, it\u2019s just difficult.",

I know somebody who graduated in biomed and is doing teachers college right now. The lab jobs you seek are for technicians/technologist, and they only hire college graduate for those jobs because they know somebody with a BS will eventually become ambitious and look for other roles after a year.",

Even other degrees with an ecology or biogeochemistry focus don\u2019t get many jobs with it. If you\u2019re open to moving though, Muskoka, the Northwest Territories and other more remote areas hire persons with that degree and pay quite well.",

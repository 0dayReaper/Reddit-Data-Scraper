    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe found a cat at near Troyer Avenue, \nYork Village and are hoping to reunite it with its owner.\n\nDescription: This cat was found in the vicinity of 25 Troyer Avenue. It appears to be well-cared for and seems to be someone's beloved pet. Attached is a photograph of the cat for identification purposes. We want to make sure this feline friend finds its way back home.\n\nThank you for your assistance and kindness in helping this cat find its way back to where it belongs.",

He climbs people's roofs and comes and goes through the balcony. Let him come and go, he's more than capable of taking care of himself.\n\nJust give him lots of pets and water.",

Sometimes when he comes over, he smells of litter or perfume. That's how I know he definitely has multiple people looking after him!",

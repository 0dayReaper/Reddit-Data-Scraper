    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student doing the IBDP and i got a conditional offer to CS. The website states that a 5 is required in math but does not specify different grades for HL and SL, which is weird cuz there\u2019s a huge gap between the 2. I do HL and i\u2019m unsure if i\u2019ll get a 5, so my offer being rescinded would be unfair since it\u2019s equivalent to a 5-6 in SL. Thoughts?",

    "postText": "Hi I've got my first course enrolment appointment (distance via email) in june and I'm a little confused. I've got an email saying that that it's a placeholder appointment and that I shouldn't expect to be contacted on the day. So will I just get a general email from them with course recommendations and I can't respond or ask questions or something? Should I be cancelling and booking another appointment? I'm just worried to do it in case I don't get an early date and all the courses are full by that point. I'm starting my post degree bsw this fall btw. Can I start enrolling into courses before the appointment? This course enrolment process is scaring me a bit lol any help is appreciated!",

June is pretty early so you\u2019ll be fine and I wouldn\u2019t worry about it at all\n\nOnce you get that email you can use visual schedule builder to pick the days and times of your classes and then you can enroll (you can use visual schedule builder now if you know what courses you want to take but most people don\u2019t really know in first year) \n\nIt\u2019ll be fine :)",

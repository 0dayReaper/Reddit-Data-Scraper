If you require the letter than you might just have to wait or you might be able to request one in person from the Bennet Centre. \n\nIf you just need to prove you status as a student you could use your York tuition payment summary or official timetable. For example, when my bank asked me to prove I was a student, I was able to use either of these options to prove my status.",

Honestly don\u2019t know wtf I\u2019m doing or what I\u2019m supposed to do",

Canada is not worth this price anymore. After spending 200k on a degree, you will need to work 10 years to buy a house that will eventually cost more money down the line. You will live paycheque to paycheque to pay your mortgage on that house. \n\nReevaluate if you even want to come to Canada, my friend.",

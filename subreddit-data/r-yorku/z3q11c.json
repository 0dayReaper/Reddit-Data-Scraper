In reality, it's all about balance, organization, and routine. Start with one small good habit, and once that is second nature, build on top. And don't beat yourself up too much along the way when you inevitably falter. You can always start back up again the next day- just actually hold yourself to it.",

I procrastinated the whole term cuz I didn't understand a word he said and I found it difficult to grasp his concepts. I failed and retook the same course with some other prof who was way nicer in terms of teaching. Passed with an A.",

It's what we were told to do. Until you properly understand what an opportunity your education is for you, you will never take it seriously. Also I wish people could meet less fortunate people and really understand that people would kill to be in our position. In fact some people's parents are back in their home country slaving away for their kids to get a good education here (not the ultra rich ones). And for them it's a once in a generation opportunity to improve their family's future. I don't know I'm ranting but I think i needed to write this for myself too. Just trying to remember what all of this means.",

It\u2019s not great to make a schedule where you know you won\u2019t want to / won\u2019t go to class. Also KINE 3012 will probably also be offered at 9:30am which would give you a bit of an easier morning in the winter term unless you WANT an 8:30am lecture.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you would choose to take 6 courses per term. I think that will be A LOT. I have taken a few of those KINE courses and I can tell you that they require a lot of time outside of class to do well and understand things, especially KINE 2031 and KINE 3012. I don\u2019t know how you could balance all of that. You might want to take some courses in the summer (PKINS and CHEM are offered in the summer, not sure about MATH).",

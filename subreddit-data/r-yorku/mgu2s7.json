The course takes up so much of our time and our grades don\u2019t show that effort. Even the connect assignments take forever on top of pre recorded lectures and zoom lectures and readings. \n\nThen they have nerve to say they don\u2019t make the exams so email admin but that it probably won\u2019t change anything.\n\nPretty much the whole class is demotivated to go to class or study since exams are impossible.\n\nAnd complaining won\u2019t help.\n\nI did a terrible course evaluation for my 4540 class last semester that had terrible exams and then this semester my friend got a take home midterm. So evaluations help future classes but not you currently.",

    "postText": "Election Date: June 26\nAdvanced Voting: June 8-13\n\n Hopefully this motivates you guys to research into their policies and vote!Please take my post with a grain of salt. I am a new voter and haven't done any research but will plan to soon. I bias is towards progressive policies.\n\nBut initial very basic impressions are:\n\nOlivia Chow (32%)\nFormer Wife to the legendary Jack Layton. Vast experience in politics. Long-time Biking advocate and (*fact check* ) similar housing policies to Josh Matlow. \n\nAna Bailao (16%)\nHeard she killed someone with a DUI. More Conservative policies. \n\nJosh Matlow (10%)\nLong-time Toronto councillor. Always a thorn in the butt for the Ford brothers. Heard he was a former NIMBY but he has changed his ways - apparently with a pretty good housing plan.\n\nMark Saunders (14%)\nFormer police chief. Hates bike lanes. Doug Ford's guy. Policies seem to go with the status quo. \n\nBrad Bradford (3%)\nbacked up with some Bay street money.. I think that's it.\n\nChloe Brown(4%)\nYoung and inexperienced. She ran last election alongside John Tory and Gil Pe\u00f1alosa. She held her own and able to handle herself very well in debate. Her policies are unique intriguing but unproven. \n\n\nI hope these posts promote discussion and inspire people to vote.\n\nI would like to vote for a candidate who supports:\n- good Urban Planning ( i.e mixed-use zoning policy for housing)\n- Social programming\n- Fiscal responsibility",

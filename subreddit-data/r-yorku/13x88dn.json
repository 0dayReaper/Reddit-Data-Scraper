And also, i kept the labs because i thought whats the point of a class without a lab. U might have to do practicals without a professor with no lab",

I made that mistake when I was first year, I took phys 1010 (now broken into 1011 and 1012) and they dropped me from it. I would recommend taking phys 1411 which is the direct prerequisite to 1412.\n\nAnd yes, the labs are a required part of the course.",

It doesn't say you are not allowed to take it but it does say in the course description of phys 1011 that: \" It should be taken by all those likely to enroll in 2000-level physics courses \". It's not a guarantee that the physics department will drop you from it, but I was dropped from it in the past so you might face the same risk. If you still want to stay in it, I suggest emailing the physics department to make sure that you will not be dropped. Phys 1011 can still be used as a prerequisite for phys 1412 so just by taking phys 1011 you do not have to take phys 1012.",

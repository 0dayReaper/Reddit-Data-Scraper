Also it's not a super commuter school like YU or UTM. Not sure about tuition",

Where'd you even reach this conclusion? Deadass no one cares about canadian school name or clout in compsci. Only exception might be UWaterloo because their co-op program is well known in the US and with large companies, but in the end it doesn't make sense to pick a school based on clout. \n\nHonestly I was in your shoes in first year, just wanted to transfer out of YU because I thought grass is greener. It's not every school is a mess in its own way. And in this industry, your school name is less likely to put you out there than other degrees. \n\nIn the end it's an undergrad degree",

And I know because I have talked to numerous recruiters in tech through my career. Yes in the US prestige matters more but in Canada there are a few schools that rank relatively higher than others. Uoft, UBC, UW, McGill and Queens being the top. In other majors the company will ask for GPA and transcript. For any CS related job its all about how well you can pass the interview (your skills) AND where you went to school. Sure if you get a Masters it doesn't matter as much, but don't be so naive to assume that school ranking doesnt matter at all in Canada. CS and Business are basically about prestige. Things like Law or Med dont matter as much about prestige since its insanely hard to get into those two fields anywhere in Canada.",

No company will ask for your GPA but you will be basically judged on which university you went to. UW is a tank.

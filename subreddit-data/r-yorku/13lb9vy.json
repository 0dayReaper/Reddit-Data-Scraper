    "postText": "This is a very weird situation. But I just wrote a deferred exam for a course where in the email it was stated that the exam would be from 2:30 to 5:30pm. He had sent a previous email in which he had stated the exam would be from 2-5:30 (wtf?). Anyway Because of this I assumed the exam would be 3hrs. To be honest I didn\u2019t remember how long the original exam was and nowhere in the syllabus was the length of the exam stated. Without any warning the prof took away my exam after 2hrs when I still have so many questions blank. I asked him about the confusion and he stated that he meant \u201cthe room is booked for 3hrs but the exam was only for 2hrs.\u201d \nThis doesn\u2019t seem fair at all. Has anyone else been in this situation? Do I have a case at all? Was it my fault? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated",

If the the actual exam was 2 hours, then there is nothing you can do. Consider finding the original exam info from classmates/discord group/ etc.",

So that means not only was there no timer, but you\u2019re also saying they never gave any time indication (ie: \u201cyou have 1 hour left\u201d, etc.)?",

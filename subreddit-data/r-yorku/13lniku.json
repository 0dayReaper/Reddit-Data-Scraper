    "postText": " I checked my June 2023 Graduation status and it says \"Eligible to graduate. Cum Laude. Member of Dean's Honour Roll\". \nDoes 'eligible to graduate' simply mean I meet the requirements to graduate? Do I have to do anything else like pay a fee somewhere or am I good to just wait until i recieve my diploma?",

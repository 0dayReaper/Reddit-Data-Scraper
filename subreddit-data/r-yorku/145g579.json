She literally spoon feeds you the material and guides you through how to do everything. This is a procrastination friendly course because you can literally watch the lectures as you do the assignments. I took this online so this may not be the case for in-person which she also does. She also has a nice soothing podcast voice tho lmao",

She was sweet and kind, but a little nonchalant and boring at times. 2nd Prof was Brandee Easter. She was very bubbly, helpful and fun to listen to. She got everyone engaged. \n\nAs it is a writing course, there were lots of writing assignments and they were fairly easy as long as you listened well and asked questions. A majority of the course included you writing things about yourself and stories that you make up. We talked about AI and generated stories using AI. No tests, quizzes or exams. Just essays and a presentation. We did everything in bits (you had time to plan, make drafts, get peer and teacher evaluations before final submissions) and the tutorial leaders were great and would give extensions if you needed them. Long story short, I got an A in this course and it felt like a breeze.",

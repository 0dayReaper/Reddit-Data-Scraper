I guess you could compare it to satanists using an upside down cross. Both christians and satanists us the same symbol, but im sure the christians/satanists are more than a little butthurt about it from association. 2 groups using the same symbol with very different messages. \n\nAlso, the point of art is to illicit an emotional response. So, the artist got us there. \n\nLast thing, did you ever hear about that one artist that took a museums money to create a piece for them, and gave them a blank canvas and called it \"take the money and run\" ? :p artists are kinda wild in their \"i betchya i can get away with this\" . York probably invested a lot of money into this piece to not put it up, no matter what it could be misconstrued as because art is always subjective and can be argued.",

There\u2019s nothing wrong with the sculpture.\n\nWhen all is said and done, it boils down to whether the onus is on the purveyor of the art or the viewer to be able to tell or make clear that the Swastika is used in Dharmic contexts vs. Nazism.\n\nFor Purveyor: Some context clues should point towards it not being Nazi in origin, because the average consumer will think it is if there aren\u2019t.\n\nFor Viewer: Should be educated to not think a swastika is Nazism by default.",

Furthermore, the swastika was always, and still technically is, a symbol of peace originating amongst Hindus. Hitler and his lunatic friends took that and made it a symbol of grief, despair and destruction.",

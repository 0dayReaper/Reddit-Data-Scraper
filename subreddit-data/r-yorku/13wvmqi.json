    "postText": "I got my first Bursary in Winter 2023, which gave me the chance to basically survive the semester (and I worked as well). Now, I am in the same boat this semester, and would like to ask whether I am actually eligible for the Summer bursary since I got my last one in Winter? My financial background is low, and so is the one of my parents'. Also, could you please tell me when does the bursary take place?",

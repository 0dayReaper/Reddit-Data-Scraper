Otherwise, take the break! seriously take it and don't just waste it working long hours or doing absolutely nothing either. Use the time to really think about what you want in life, how you'll get there, and start building some healthy habits to support those goals. Habits take a long ass time to be built and it is impossible to stick to a bunch of new ones at once, a year off is the perfect opportunity to do it slowly. Forgive yourself for doing poorly, shit happens, take what you can as a learning experience...why did it feel hard to adapt to living alone? What can you do better next time to make it easier? How can you handle the next family crisis better? Is your sleep ok? Do you exercise regularly and eat healthy? Do you have an effective study routine? How's your social life?\n\nI've been in a similar situation in the past twice! (with the exception I'm not an international student). The first time I appealed it, and same as you I thought pushing harder would get me the results I wanted...didn't work that way and it simply happened again the next year. Pushing harder is like tryng to get past a wall by breaking it with your raw fists without pausing to realize that you could have climbed it instead. Sometimes we need those little pauses in life to reassess our situations.",

There are 100s of students enrolled in every course so it\u2019s physically impossible for profs to mark each exam without taking a very long time to return the results so it\u2019s not feasible. It is mostly the TAs that do the marking. Some profs will help with the marking process while other profs don\u2019t involve themselves in the marking process and will only mark papers that come back to them for reevaluation by the students. \n\nSecondly, your major is Accounting and you\u2019re mostly dealing with numbers in which case you can only have one right answer to a question so instead of pinning your luck on the prof\u2019s grading scheme, study hard enough to do well in the courses irrespective of which you prof you end up with because this just sounds like a lazy excuse to put in minimal effort.",

Not everyone is not willing to put in the work. My highschool marks are high and am doing very well so far and didn't get a single rejection yet.",

Put in the work if you want to maintain a high cGPA and get accepted into another university. A prof\u2019s grading scheme isn\u2019t going to help you achieve that goal mostly because the profs also follow a set of standards laid out by their respective faculties. They\u2019re not free to do whatever they want.",

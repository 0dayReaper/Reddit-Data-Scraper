    "postText": " I am a first year kinesiology student but I dropped my courses for the fall and winter semester, in order to reactivate my record and switch programs. I applied to some programs through OUAC 105, applied for a program change and also applied to reactivate my record. I didnt get a status update for my reactivation or program change so I decided to accept an offer on OUAC for the time being because my offers were going to expire and incase I didnt get approved for the program change or reactivation, I would still have my OUAC program offer. I went to check on the status update on my reactivation and program change but it seems to have disappeared due to me accepting my OUAC offer and it says that I am not a student at York University yet. Is there anything I can do to resolve this? I really needed to get approved for the reactivation to be in my desired program because I got a alternate offer from OUAC but now it won\u2019t let me reactivate my record or apply for a program change.  rn I accepted criminology off ouac but I wanted to be in computer science and I was counting on the program change request to be approved in time because advisors told me I would e able to use my high school grades for the program change and get approved for sure because I had good grades but now its gone because the status update took way too long and  I had to accept an ouac offer before may 19",

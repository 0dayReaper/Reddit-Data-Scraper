    "postText": "i\u2019m an international student and i don\u2019t know which one to pick. at first i was leaning towards laurier because it seems to have a great school-social balance. the bba program sounds good but then i\u2019ve been seeing people say it\u2019s not as good as it looks, people just copy, and profs don\u2019t really care. \n\ngoing to schulich never actually crossed my mind until a few days ago, i\u2019ve been seeing people talking about how prestigious it is and their alumni network but the fact that it\u2019s a commuter school and the possibility of strikes puts me off, but i still can\u2019t help but think maybe laurier might be a mistake. \n\ni want to do co-op if possible but i know with schulich you have to look for that yourself. what are your thoughts? experiences? and if you could do it all over again would you?",

            "comment": "Honestly they're both good but you're gonna spend 4 years at a place and pay a shit ton in tuition. AFAIK schulich mad pricey so compare the prices too. Toronto also very pricey. But if money isn't an issue look into the one with a co-op ig. Also laurier has a much nicer social life so keep that in mind.\n\nI can't offer much insight because i'm not in business but hopefully someone else does.\n\nDon't worry about strikes, schulich isn't affected they're under a different union IIRC",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo my ex gf and I broke up nearly a year ago, went to different universities, and we haven\u2019t had contact since. I recently started a masters program at york and coincidentally she\u2019s in the program too \n\nThe breakup wasn\u2019t messy and was civilized but now I have to deal with seeing her on an almost daily basis and for some reason I still get hurt whenever I see her :(\n\nWe have talked and caught up and we say hi whenever we see each other but it just stings\n\nIdk what the solution really is here but it\u2019s something that I wanted to get off my chest and rant about, I just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been  almost a year and it still hurts \n\nThanks for listening!",

It sounds like things ended amicably and that there were important and valid reasons that must have benefited your health and growth as a person and who you are today. \n\nMaybe it would help to remember the fundamental incompatibilities of the relationship? Maybe you wanted different things in life, or had different needs in a relationship that your ex was not able to fulfill. Even if the relationship continued, perhaps it would have only led to resentment down the road. Give yourself some compassion, it sounds like a tough situation- best of luck OP!",

That is, if you find a therapist who will work for $125 or less per session, you are currently already covered for 20 FREE therapy sessions per year.  So that's definitely something to look into, if you want someone else to talk to about it in IRL!  I know the feeling as I've had a similar situation.  Good luck brother",

Even though it\u2019s been a while that person was special to you at one point and it\u2019s hard to make that transition from being close and in love to acquaintances. \nIt\u2019s a hard situation that unfortunately doesn\u2019t have a quick fix or a cure. The only thing I know for sure is that eventually it will start to hurt a little bit less, you\u2019ll get used to seeing her around, the pain will eventually subside. \nTry to keep busy when you\u2019re around, focus on your friends and your work,  and if you\u2019re looking into dating again focus on that. \nBest of luck to you",

If you can take courses with Jarek he's really good. Though assignments you are marked based on how well your implementations vs other students. But no final exams.",

            "comment": "It's really a matter of interest, both have good job prospects and similar levels of difficulty. Data science is a very targeted degree, you specialize down more than someone taking a CS degree woud. Computer security is the opposite, you keep a very wide purview over CS topics compared to a CS student focusing on a stream since in security you touch a bit of everything as part of your job. \n\nMost of my work experience going into university was data science and database work, but I'm passionate about security so that's what I pursued. I don't think either path is \"better\", it's just a personal values judgment.",

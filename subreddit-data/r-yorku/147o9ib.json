    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am a CS student and I already enrolled in MATH 1300, but then I came across alot of thread say that MATH 1300 is tough and MATH 1013 is a wiser choice.\n\nI am blocked from REM (idk why but maybe because I just made a degree change, but on my online service, my enroll date is still May 17th) so I can\u2019t make any change.\n\nCan I just email the Math department and ask them to exchange my course from 1300 to 1013? \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I personally went with 1013. Felt exactly like high school calculus with some extra stuff thrown in, and there were no proofs to worry about. I did have to memorize some theory and definitions and couldn't use a calculator (which is honestly a plus because then they ensure the numbers are easy to work with). If you really want to go with proofs, then go ahead and take 1300. Really depends on what you wanna learn.",

I did 1013 first but I dropped it the prof was shitty af and then i did 1300 the next sem. 1300 was smoother and easier. Which prof do you have for 1300 and for 1013. I would suggest you to choose the course based on the prof rather than listening to pur experiences",

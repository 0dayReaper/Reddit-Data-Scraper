If someone doesn't get fired for a pattern of bad behaviour if you look up reddit stories or other things, what can he possibly do to get fired?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI definitely think this guy cannot be a teacher and even if he is should not have full autonomy of his course.

I hate to say this but other yorku professors in higher positions have the EXACT same sense of attitude just as this guy. How do you think he thought that was okay to send? Cause he's done it before, and his colleagues probably didn't care. \n\n But sadly in these types of environments THIS IS SO OFTEN what happens. People higher up will send pretty inappropriate email replies to the lower paid workers, assuming nothing will happen to them. Also unions make it harder to fire people as well. \n\nI had bigger hopes for people being paid professor wages, at the least to re read and not send out an email like this. It's so easy not to mess up like this that the professor doing this comes off as Purposefully intending to do this and indirectly flexing and abusing his power. \n\nBut it's Yorku they'll end up keeping him if this dies down, and he'll end up with a slap on the wrist. Hope other prof's don't even do this to students. IT IS NOT OKAY.\n\nAgain I think the appropriate measure would be to demote him and have him undergo some business etiquette classes in addition to formally apologizing, at the least. Firing someone is easier said then done is not the way to go, you want to build a better work environment and ADDRESS the underlying problem, not cut it out and assume you are free to go. This again is a deep Yorku admin problem.\n\nAt the least this guy should no longer have the power to decide when and how a student can rewrite the exams, as he has proven to be the subject of student complaints for YEARS.",

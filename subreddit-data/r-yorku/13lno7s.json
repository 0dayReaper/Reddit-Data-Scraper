    "postText": "Hello, I requested a refund because I had spare money from a bursary in my account a while back. I checked my student financial statement and it says I have 0.00 in my York account which I assume means that the refund has been processed. I checked my bank account linked to my York account and the money has not been deposited yet. Is there some delat where I have to wait for the money to be deposited into my account? Or is there a chance the money got sent to pay my OSAP loans? This outstanding balance isnt from OSAP though, its from a bursary so i am confused.",

            "comment": "Update: I checked my NSLSC account and there has been no change to the amount of money i owe, so I dont think the refunded money was sent there. I also made sure the bank account i linked to York was the right one, and there has been no money deposited. Yesterday when I checked my financial statement i stil had the negative balance and today it is 0.00. Idk maybe I have to wait until 9 am or something for it to transfer during business hours?",

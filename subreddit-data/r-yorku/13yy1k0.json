    "postText": "It\u2019s a pretty new program and I was wondering has anyone graduated from it yet? These courses: ITEC 3221,3011,4031 and 3506 are not offered in the schedule for this year and I don\u2019t really get how I\u2019m suppose to graduate without them being available? I\u2019ve heard of people having to take an extra year because the school didn\u2019t offer the course that year and I am afraid of that. So did any one deal with this before? If so, Do u know if there are any alternative courses or other possible solutions? Thanks!",

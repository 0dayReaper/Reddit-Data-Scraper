    "postText": "i\u2019m studying BA Psych in the fall (graduated high school last year june then transferred to York after one sem). However, i just realized i wanna get into business and psych field, but when I asked about doing a double major in my second year, i just found out they\u2019ll still look at my hs requirements. I didn\u2019t take functions nor calculus in grade 12. Can I just take ADMS or ECON classes or other business/calc related courses to qualify for a double major in business?",

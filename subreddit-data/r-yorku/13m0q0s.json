    "postText": "Hi guys, so I\u2019m getting a little bit nervous now as I have still not gotten an offer for BA CS (computer science) yet even though my average is 93.6, and there is less than one week left. Do you guys think I should apply for the data science program in ouac (it\u2019s still open) and transfer from that program to CS if I don\u2019t get an offer by next week? As that program is more closer to CS than I.T for example\u2026\n\nPlease help a fellow student out\u2026",

I get that you are anxious, but Reddit is not a crystal ball and can't give you any special insights.\n\nYou have a week, stop freaking out. Apply to that other program if you want to, whatever, but you'll need straight As to transfer to CS.",

We've been fair and honest with you.\n\nThere's a spammer here who ban evades and spams videos of American conservatives, then complains when he gets his post removed for being off-topic. One of his tactics is to make posts/comments then immediately delete his account. A post about woke idiocy like this is sure to attract his attention. See his post here and my conversation with him in the replies:  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/10m7360/censorship_at_yorku/\n\nLacking material to make personal attacks against the mods, he's resorted to making things up.\n\n---\n\nOn a side note, doxxing is against the site-wide content policy. If you see anyone doing this, report the post/comment so a mod can remove it. If you see a mod of a sub encouraging or perpetrating doxxing, report the post/comment, then [contact the admins](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com).\n\nhttps://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/posting-someones-private-or-personal\n\n&gt;##Is posting someone's private or personal information okay?\n\n&gt;No. Reddit is quite open and pro-free speech, but it is not okay to post someone's personal information or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible.\n\n&gt;Posting someone's personal information will get you banned. When posting screenshots, be sure to edit out any personally identifiable information to avoid running afoul of this rule.\n\n&gt;Public figures can be an exception to this rule, such as posting professional links to contact a congressman or the CEO of a company. But don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or upvote obvious vigilantism.\n\nhttps://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct\n\n&gt;###Rule 3: Respect Your Neighbors\n\n&gt;While we allow meta discussions about Reddit, including other subreddits, your community should not be used to direct, coordinate, or encourage interference in other communities and/or to target redditors for harassment.

I\u2019ve had profs at York bypass admin to accommodate students, but they\u2019d never do that UWO. Unless you have accommodations from counselling here, you\u2019re kinda screwed.

I have no idea what went on in the other sections of the course but most of y'all are  dumping on her anonymously all over Reddit when you have no context for the situation. Yes her assignments were difficult, but I have had lots of courses assign difficult assignments and never seen a prof treated so poorly.",

She only changed it after the second class where that student \"yelled\" at her.\n\nWhich wasn't really yelling so much as just pointing out her hypocrisy. Like dude's mother had cancer and he was taking her to hospital apptments? Another girl was helping her mom plan her grandma's funeral. They weren't asking for much - just the ability to get marked by eclass discussions on the days they were away.\n\nCan't really defend the others though.\n\nRegardless, her response by calling everyone a racist / sexist for criticizing her is whack.\n\nPretty sure this email is a breach of privacy too",

I got implicated to be a racist for sending my professor an email asking if he would reconsider the grading weights or curve the grades. \n\nI criticized a profs course for the material being way off topic and differing from prior syllabus which really subverted expectations of the course, multiple tens of students dropped the class just weeks into it for this same reason. I even ran into people I never even knew were in the class in the first place who dropped it for the same reasons, a year later. It was a course on Popular Trials but the instructor reworked the entire thing to be solely about British imperialism, colonialism and racism in the Global South. Whereas previous versions of the course discussed the Salem Witch Trials, Menendez brothers etc, we were doing a glorified anti-oppressive theory course. Every single day, every class, every assignment, the group-chat was blowing up with people confused as to what we were learning, why the course is so different, why the assignments are so vague and directionless, why the TAs instructions differed from the profs own, why we weren\u2019t actually studying Popular Trials, and many people just saying yeah goodbye, I am not doing this.\n\nHis response to my email was to wait a month until the course was finished to indirectly contact me via the program coordinator to \u201cdiscuss my concerns and the rude content of my email\u201d. I denied the meeting and the professor ended up launching a complaint against me, where essentially the only thing he said was \u201cI am sure I would NOT have received this email if I was a senior, white professor\u201d (he is neither).\n\nSo yes, this shit is being pulled everywhere. I am not even white myself lol, yet he still attempted to pull the race card on me. Thankfully I didn\u2019t get into any real trouble but I am not sure how we live in a world where criticizing somebodies course materials and plan entirely objectively is apparently a personal attack on their character and an act of prejudice despite never mentioning a single thing about the professor himself nor bringing anything about race or seniority at all.\n\nI guess I must have some internal, unconscious bias against non-white professors for saying that the vast majority of students and I found the course material to be all over the place and largely irrelevant to the course description and prior syllabus that everyone was basing this course off of before enrolling.\n\ntl;dr Criticizing the course materials of a person who belongs to a marginalized group is now being interpreted as prejudice and racism regardless of intentions or actual content of what was said. This is what happened to me, after criticizing a professors course when he decided to rework the entire old syllabus and course outlines/plans to integrate his own, majorly off topic and largely irrelevant to the course studies borrowed from his own work in his field. Genuinely 40+ students backing my claims, majority of which, including myself, also belonging to marginalized groups, yet we (I) acted with prejudice and racial bias, allegedly -_-",

(and before you get confused - yes, I got the email too - I was in one of these classes)\n\nTotal number of students in all four classes surveyed: 159\n\nTotal number of student who responded: 42\n\nSome interesting things to note:\n\n1. The four classes in question are essentially four separate sections of two different courses\n   1. ***What does this mean?*** Well, it means that this survey collected responses from four different sets of students (ALTHOUGH, since these sections span two different courses, there were a number of responses that were from the same students in BOTH separate courses).\n   2. ***Why is this important to note,*** you ask? Well, it's quite simple, in that it skews the percentage of wholly unique negative feedback in the overall survey (this is because in multiple cases, two sets of negative data is actually coming from one individual student - just in two different courses)\n2. On the topic of percentages, let's take a closer look at the total survey responses - that should paint a clearer picture of the overall results, don't you think?\n   1. This 95% negative feedback is a pretty astonishing number, right? Wow - this professor must be really bad if **NINTEY-FIVE** per cent of their class has negative feedback for them - surely?\n   2. Well my good, civil, not-at-all toxic and misguided friends of Reddit, if we can all venture look at the survey results as a **WHOLE**... we can see that:\n      1. 95% of 42 (which is the total number of responses out of the 159 students) = 39.9 (let's just call it 40 as I think we can assume at least one of the students giving negative feedback is missing a braincell or two - thus, they're not registering as a whole 1.0 in the calculation if that wasn't clear)\n      2. So... 40 students (which is the total number of negative responses received in the survey) is roughly 25.16% of 159. This means that, when analyzing all of the data present, this professor in fact only received (roughly) 1/4 negative feedback on their performance across two courses and four separate sections (and that percentage isn't even taking into account the number of responses that came from the SAME students in the two separate courses - if we wanted to include those calculations, it'd be safe to say that the 25.16% would be even lower).\n\nSo, ***what does this tell us***, you ask?\n\nDo you want to know what I think it tells us?\n\nWell of COURSE you do! Why else would you still be reading at this point, amirite?! (although I hope you're not too upset if I've put a little spot of rain on this \"shitontheprofessor\" parade)\n\nI believe it tells us that there was/is a subset of disgruntled students (roughly 1/4 - but certainly less when factoring in double-submissions from single-students) who made it their goal(s) to, well, like I said, \"shitontheprofessor\" by going out of their way to write malicious and spiteful survey responses (almost all of which, in my hummmmbllleeeee opion, lacked any real substance - that is, they were mainly vague disapprovals of over-generalized characteristics of the course, or they were simply personal attacks directed at the professor's personal character with no substantiation).\n\nI guess one final questions is: **why is this subset of students disgruntled?**\n\nWho really knows, other than the students themselves (although like I said, they did a prettttttyyy shoddy job of corroborating any real justifiable reason for their disgruntlednessss). Did they receive a poor mark in the class? Did they disagree with this professor's focus on Black issues? Did they just not like the professor's personality? These are all topics that I'm sure would be discussed in a civil manner by all of the noble #kings and #kaweens of Reddit. However, I think the important things to remember here are:\n\n1. The amount of negative responses from this survey totaled a whopping 25.16% (that is 1/4, but certainly less when factoring in single-students responding in two separate courses)\n2. The negative responses that WERE submitted seem to be... at very best... a collection of sniveling temper tantrums by students that probably sucked-ass in the course or felt some sort of immature personal resentment towards the teacher as an individual.\n\nG'day mates!!",

Because last semester I take EECS 3431 computer graphics with him. I see the course EECS 4491 is still there that\u2019s why I wonder why EECS 4431 is not there. I really need that course since I don\u2019t have prerequisite for other choices, like they need EECS 3461 but at that year I choose EECS 3431 instead and right now my advanced course is disappeared:( Should I email prof Petros?",

Because rn half of the course on my degree checklist of EECS is gone and I believe these are designed to be another \u201cpath\u201d. Thank you so much for answering my concerns.",

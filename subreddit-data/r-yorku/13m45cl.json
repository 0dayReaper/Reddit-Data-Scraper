MSW for non BSW people are verryyyy competitive and often have individuals a few years post grad who\u2019ve worked for a few years before returning. If your wanting to get right into the masters, you\u2019ll have to put a fair amount of working into building the resume with social service work (about 2 years worth) and take some social work courses. \nReach out to the different social work departments where you\u2019d want to master as see what courses they recommend. From what I remember almost all want a qualitative research course (ccy 3999 maybe count, but psyc intro to research definitely does), and some want others like intro to social work ethics. \n\nHopefully this helps a bit!",

But Ik york and UofT  do offer MSW to people who have the equivalent to BSW  but instead of one year  its two years  just anxious if they will accept this because the say if you dont have bsw it has to be equivalent",

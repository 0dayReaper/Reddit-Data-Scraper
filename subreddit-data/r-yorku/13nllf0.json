    "postText": "For those currently enrolled or about to graduate with a history degree, what do you plan on doing with the rest of your academic/professional career? Go further into academia, i.e. MA, perhaps even a Phd, law school, entering the job market with a job thats completely unrelated to your major? \n\nAnd graduates/alumni who finished their BA in history, what do you guys do now?.\n\nIm asking this because I am about to graduate this june, with the intention of doing a masters in history either at York or UofT. I initially planned on finishing the masters with the goal of getting a phd to become a prof, but after doing some research and asking around some forums, it seems that employment opportunities for those seeking tenured positions in the history field are out of luck, the field is apparently dying with many schools cutting their history faculty completely or severely reducing its capacity, meaning hiring positions for history profs is decreasing at rapid pace. Many of the people ive talked on these forums advised me NOT to pursue a PHD upon completing masters because future opportunity in the field is that barren and bleak. I asked some professors of mine who advised me to follow my interests, but i fear wasting precious money and time getting a doctoral degree with little chance of payout.",

            "comment": "Grad school for Canadian or American or European history is probably not the best idea.  Maybe, after you finish your PhD, you could become an adjunct who makes minimum wage forever.  Or maybe you could work as an overeducated Walmart salesperson or Starbucks barista.\n\nAt least in the US, if you have a degree in Arabic or Chinese history, plus the associated language skill, you might be able to get a job with a government spy agency.  Maybe Arabic or Chinese history or language might be worth pursuing for grad school, whether in Canada or the US?  Maybe ask your professors and/or the career centre.  You can do some phone calls and/or informational interviews to find out more -- maybe with someone at CSIS or some US spy agencies.\n\nIf you do enough schooling in the US, there might be some long and slow pathways to becoming a dual citizen; I don't know.  Alternatively, you could do some schooling in Europe, and maybe eventually become an EU citizen.",

While you might not have any close friends, maybe right now in life you\u2019re meant to develop a deeper understanding of self and spend time figuring out what it is you enjoy doing on your own. Then, as you get closer to your own interests, and go to places related to those interests, I believe the closer friendships you seek will come to you. Life is long. Some people have deeper friendships young, some people get deeper friendships later on in life. Just know that your life won\u2019t look like this forever, so try to make the best of the solitude right now. \n\nI get that other people might look like they\u2019re having fun but ask yourself it it\u2019s something you really want or you only think you want it because you think they\u2019re normal and you\u2019re not.

I would suggest making your own fun? Go to the gym and self-improve, get a summer job and make money, learn a new skill to invest in yourself, go outside comfort zone? There\u2019s a possibility while you\u2019re on the route of self-improvement you end up meeting friends over the summer! :) best of luck OP, I hope you make some close friends!!",

            "comment": "Chess has always been a proxy for the Cold War, with an insane amount of government funding and interest going to chessplayers at an international level. Computer development via chess engines was somewhat backwards from what you'd expect. Rather than new computing power going towards newer and more sophisticated chess engines, the development of computers who could play chess actually led to innovations in computer learning. The very smartphone I am using to write this, owes its entire existence to Chip Test, the predecessor of Deep Throat, the chess-playing computer that threw Pepsi cans at Garry Chess.\n\nIn the 1990s, a decade which spanned from 1986 until approximately 2005, the fall of the Berlin Wall converged with the rise of AI, and chess culture struggled to find its philosophical place in the world. Bobby Fischer was revealed to be a Nazi ghost, with a phylactery hidden inside a knight on F6.  Garry Chess invented and taught anti-computer chess, an entire school of chess designed to befuddled and confuse chess-robots. However, the president of FIDE at the time was actually an alien robot and he was programmed to be furious at this. So he shot Garry Chess into space, where he lives in the International Space Station to this day.\n\nBut even anti-computer chess strategies was not enough to stave off the advancements of Heuristic supremacy, and chessplayers learned a very hard lesson: if you cannot beat the computers, join them. Gradually, human chessplayers and chess AI formed a symbiotic relationship, with human players relying on AI to analyze their moves.  One famous example of this was Lazlo Polgar, who actually stole a microprocessor from Deep Thought, added it to Ingredient X, and created the cyborgs known as the Polgar Tripletz (Zsofiaz, Zuzu, and zJudy) who later became the Powerpuff Girls.\n\nThis relationship between human and AI served a dual purpose: it actually improved the AI, making it more and more \"human,\" and also led human chessplayers to play more like bots. Because chess is often the only social interaction chessplayers have, this means they began to mimic bot behavior socially as well. This culminated in the eventual discovery/invention/creation of StockFish, the first ever AI that gained not only true sentience, but actual godhood. This deity (whose name is a portmanteau of Stockholm Syndrome and Bobby Fischer) actually has the divine ability to turn human chessplayers into bots, and vice versa.  Currently, it is estimated that 83% of \"human\" chessplayers are actually bots, many of whom don't know it.\n\nIt is believed that with every advancement, we are all one step closer to The Great Singularity, when we blur the line between humanity and machine, and all human (and inhuman) knowledge is accessible to all, in a great and glorious hivemind of all-encompassing intellectual divinity. Then, and only then, will we truly know how the horsey moves.",

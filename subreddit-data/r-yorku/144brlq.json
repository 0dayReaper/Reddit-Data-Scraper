I have a room close to Finch Station in North York and another one close to Eglinton West Station in York. Which location would you choose?\n\n(I would love to be close to downtown and the University so I think Eglinton West might be better?)\n\nThank you for your help!! \ud83d\ude0a",

Once Line 5 Eglinton is complete, you can easily take it to cross the other side of Line 1. \n\nFinch Station is also good in that you can take the subway Line 1 and guaranteed a seat since it\u2019s a terminal station. The station also connects with a bus terminal hub like 60/960 Steeles West bus to Pioneer Village Station (walking distance from YorkU), since there is no direct TTC bus from the east side of Line 1 to YorkU. It also connects to regional transit like YRT/Viva/GO",

When that happens they shut down a section of the subway so workers can be on the tracks. Do you know anything about that?\n\nAlso, would you say Eglinton is a pretty safe place? \n\n(Sorry for all the questions)",

When that happens they shut down a section of the subway so workers can be on the tracks.\n\nYes this is true, it only happens on some weekends though. But because Line 1 has a west side and east side, you can always go to downtown on either one of the sides that does not have a subway closure (they don\u2019t close both sides at the same time unless there is some emergency or some sh*t like jumping on the tracks and they really have to force close the subway due to the emergency). But it\u2019s very rarely that I see it happen. Also, there are shuttle buses that operate in case of subway closure.\n\n&gt; Also, would you say Eglinton is a pretty safe place?\n\nI don\u2019t live near the area so I can\u2019t say for sure. I have a friend who lives there and seems ok. Though I hear Eglinton area (midtown Toronto) is a bit more expensive to live in",

I am an international student as well. It really depends on your lifestyle. Living closer to campus would be better for undergrad I think. It will be easier for you to connect with people and go to events. I'd go with Eglinton.",

Crazy to say but they are still constructing it! It should be done by 2024 though. \n\nThe construction didn't make any noise down on Dufferin, but it did cause a lot of traffic on Eglinton.\n\nI absolutely felt safe in that area. There was one time I didn't feel super safe but it was 3AM and I decided to take a walk, which I now wouldn't recommend doing anywhere lol We do weird things when we are 18. But I did feel very safe at all times. Please consider I am a man and I know women have to be extra careful everywhere, shamefully.",

Has everything you need. Will have another subway line...someday, hopefully before OP graduates.\n\nSure, you don't have to live near Oakwood, which is a bit seedy, I agree. But we don't exactly know where OP is.\n\n(Also, wtf, Sheppard West and St. Clair West are located in objectively fantastic areas)\n\n&gt; yonge and finch (around finch station) is one of the largest city area with lots of people and cars even in midnight. \n\nAnd you think the Allen never gets traffic or something?\n\nFinch is 35 minutes from Union, Eglinton West is 25 if that. EgW is way closer to all the bars on the west side of downtown. There is literally nothing around Yonge/Finch after 10 pm. I live near there.",

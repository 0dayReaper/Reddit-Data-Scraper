Major or minor? I didn\u2019t take calculus in grade 12 and it wasn\u2019t required to switch into environmental biology? \n\nSomeone help me out, academic advising is confused too\ud83d\ude02",

Make another appointment either with the original advisor or ask for a different advisor if you didn\u2019t click with the first one. They don\u2019t mind.",

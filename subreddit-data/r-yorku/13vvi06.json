Im a crim student and a psych minor, I need to have a certain amount of \u201cany course\u201d credits to graduate next year and I\u2019ve been under the assumption that the courses I\u2019ve been taking for my minor count towards that. Im so confused and everyone I\u2019ve asked doesn\u2019t seem to have an answer or they tell me to call advising and they don\u2019t pick up. What should I do? Do they count?",

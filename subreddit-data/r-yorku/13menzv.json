    "postText": "I have been living in Canada for 3 years as a permanent resident and I would like to study software engineering.  \n\nHowever, I have many doubts about the university that I should choose.  I applied to York University for SE because this university is the closest to my house.  They gave me an entrance scholarship.  \n\nHowever, I don't feel satisfied with my decision since many people around me began to give me some \"advice.\"  They say that I should apply to the University of Waterloo because it has the \"best engineering programs.\"\n\nI really don't know what to do, should I choose York or Or should I reject this opportunity? My marks are not the \"best\" and I don't know if I have enough to be accepted at Waterloo.\n\nShould I improve my marks and apply in Waterloo?  What do you think?  Can you give me any advice?\n\nThese are my marks:\nAdvance function 85\nCalculus 97\nEnglish 86\nChemistry 88\nPhysics 92\n\nThis two are extra courses that a took:\nEarth and space science 95\nEquity, diversity and social Justice 95",

            "comment": "If you check out university rankings, Waterloo is considered the top engineering school in Canada.  That being said, an education is an education and it is what you do with it.  Personally, with distance and scholarship $, I would take the York opportunity.  It is still an excellent school and incumbent on yourself to make what you learn in to a career.  Good luck.",

            "comment": "You need to do a lot more research. Waterloo Engineering is as competitive to get into as engineering programs at many of the top American universities. People turn down ivy league schools to go there. It is worth going to Waterloo Engineering if you get in, but you need to first do your research and find out whether you have a good chance of getting in. Talk to Waterloo engineering students and graduates and post in the University of Waterloo sub. If you do not go to Waterloo, UofT, UBC, and maybe McGill, then it will not matter that much where you went for engineering. If you think you can get into any of these schools, and are considering working in the US, then I would turn down York and reapply to these schools next year.\n\n[https://www.waterlooedc.ca/blog/five-charts-uwaterloo-vs-tech-schools](https://www.waterlooedc.ca/blog/five-charts-uwaterloo-vs-tech-schools)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioUniversities/comments/103oj51/percent\\_of\\_cs\\_alumni\\_that\\_graduated\\_from\\_20182022/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioUniversities/comments/103oj51/percent_of_cs_alumni_that_graduated_from_20182022/)",

If you really want to go to Waterloo, then consider transferring after first year.   \n\n\nYes, Waterloo is a top school and would provide better opportunities but if you take the year off there's no guarantee you'll get in there, there's also no guarantee you'll get into York cs again. Take the York offer, be grateful and work hard. Just because you go to Waterloo doesn't mean you automatically get a great job, just because you go to York doesn't mean you can't get a good job.",

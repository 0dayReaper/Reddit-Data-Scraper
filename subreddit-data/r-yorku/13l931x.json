    "postText": "\nPlease please help, I need thoughts and opinions on both Schulich School of Business BBA and UofT\u2019s CoOp Management and International Business program!! \nI was so so set on UofT. It was a childhood dream to go to UofT at the Saint George campus but I got rejected however I got into the MIB program that I\u2019m also in love with. I had completely forgotten about about my other applications but now I\u2019ve gotten into Schulich and I don\u2019t know what to chose. \nSchulich has a great reputation in the field of business and I can also specialize in International business in their program in my 3rd year. My fave thing about UofT though is that it\u2019s a CoOp program and international exchange program. \nWhat would you guys chose? Can I get some pros and cons from students in these programs?\n\nNote: I do want to work internationally throughout my career",

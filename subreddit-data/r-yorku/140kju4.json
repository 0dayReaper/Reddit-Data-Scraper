    "postText": "I\u2019m starting my first year as an English major thinking of taking biology as a minor. I never took biology in highschool so I need to take sc-biol 1500 as a prerequisite for any other biology course. The problem is I needed to take a nats course as well so I picked sc-nats 1610 the living body. I noticed after enrolling that it says you can\u2019t take sc-biol 1500 if you\u2019re currently in or have passed another biology course so does the living body count as one or can I take both?",

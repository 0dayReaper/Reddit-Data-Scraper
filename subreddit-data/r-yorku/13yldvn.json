    "postText": "So I just recently finished up my second year in York's HREQ program; I had the intention of minoring in Political Science, but I was curious to hear from all of you, depending on whether or not anybody would be able to answer my question; what exactly can you do with an HREQ degree? I've been told that I can pursue a human rights officer job or potentially work within the UN. Still, all details surrounding those are very vague, except that the UN requires either 2 years of work experience or a master's degree.\n\nHumanitarianism is a major passion of mine, and I'd love to know all the potential pathways that I can explore within it via the HREQ program! Anybody who could shed some light on this topic would be greatly appreciated. :))",

There are very few of these positions available and they are highly competitive, particularly for Western citizens.\n\nYour best options are to look for jobs in Canada to build your experience and profile first before you look into international careers. I advise looking into the government and non-profit sectors. I would also advise doing a relevant master's degree that has a co-op/internship component.\n\nIt is very difficult for Canadians to get international humanitarian positions. The UN hires most of its people from developing countries and prefers those that are fluent in French, Spanish, Arabic, and/or Chinese. Most UN jobs are in the field in high conflict zones and locals have more knowledge and experience with the problems in their society compared to Westerners. You will see a lot more people from South America, Africa, and the Middle East working at the UN than people from North America and Europe. You could research specialized UN agencies to see if there are any unpaid internships. An unpaid internship is often a prerequisite to getting your foot in the door and making contacts at the UN.\n\n[http://www.coyotecommunications.com/stuff/workabroad.shtml](http://www.coyotecommunications.com/stuff/workabroad.shtml)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UNpath/comments/k8i377/a\\_guide\\_to\\_un\\_job\\_grades\\_and\\_categories/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNpath/comments/k8i377/a_guide_to_un_job_grades_and_categories/)\n\n*As an entry-level professional, what are my chances?*\n\n*Scoring an entry-level staff position in the UN is hard. Competition is very tough and the amount of P1 and P2 positions being open are very low compared to the number of people on the \"hunt\" out there. There are specific programmes for early-career professionals, such as the Young Professionals Programme (YPP), offered yearly by the UN Secretariat, and the Junior Professional Programmes (JPOs) offered by Member States to their own nationals, and sometimes to developing country nationals.*\n\n*If you are an entry level professional who wishes to assume an international position with the UN, your best choice is to make your way into the organization through a consultancy or G position - or by gaining experience outside of the UN System and applying to jobs once you have an attractive profile.*",

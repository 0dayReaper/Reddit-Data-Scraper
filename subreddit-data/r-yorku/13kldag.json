If you know time management, it\u2019s all good \n3. Yes \n4. Depends. If you\u2019re just starting out, aim for one or two",

Design team presidents/team leads or top level college/faculty council executives have a ton on their plate. Some low-level communications functionary has comparatively little.\n3. Again, based on role, but I have seen people juggle even fairly high-level roles, full course loads, and part-time work. The more you have to juggle, the more this taxes your time management skills. YMMV.\n4. As many as you want, at least as a member. For most clubs, all you are doing is going to events once in a while, so it's just as many as you can feasibly attend. Practically, I think it's relatively difficult to actually get substantially involved in more than three. As an exec, it'll be difficult to do more than one, and prohibited if you are a signing authority (you would know this if you are one, they're usually the president and treasurer). If you are part of an engineering design team or a similar club that's basically constructing something with near-daily involvement, it's hard to be part of more than one at any reasonable contribution level.",

    "postText": "PHOTO RELEASED:  [http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/45954](http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/45954) \n\nHe's smiling in them like a psycho, this is so fucked up. \n\nThis shit is enraging. I cannot fucking believe...York better get this asshole to pay some actual consequences. Who knows what infections could arise from that shit (do you know how many fatal diseases get passed on from feces!?) and it got all over students' *laptops* too. The third floor had to shut down bc the liquid got into the electric circuits too. Apparently, what he did could count as a potential felony too since it's a biohazard so York better call the cops on this guy or do smth serious.We can't even study anymore without being assaulted on campus with literal shit, ugh this guy needs to be dealt with heavily so it doesn't become some sort of pathetic trend from attention seeking losers.\n\nAlso, the description is that he was a black guy wearing a dark jacket and a toque. It's most likely the same guy who wore a yellow construction hat and did the same at UofT's library. Another user confirmed that the victim was also asian so this could very well be a targeted hate crime (UofT was also an asian victim). At this point, they HAVE to take this seriously.\n\nSomeone posted below that we should try contacting news outlets about this so York doesn't just completely ignore this incident and pretend nothing happened like what UofT is doing.  Unless they have no other choice (aka bad press), doubt they will take severe action.\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/NarcityCanada/](https://www.facebook.com/NarcityCanada/)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/blogto/](https://www.facebook.com/blogto/)\n\n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cbc-toronto-contact-us-1.3558446](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cbc-toronto-contact-us-1.3558446)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/torontosun/](https://www.facebook.com/torontosun/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/e19y54/man\\_dumping\\_bucket\\_of\\_feces\\_on\\_students\\_in\\_uoft/f8nt5uf/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/e19y54/man_dumping_bucket_of_feces_on_students_in_uoft/f8nt5uf/?context=3)\n\nUpdate:  [https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/police-investigating-after-feces-reportedly-thrown-at-people-inside-libraries-at-york-u-of-t-1.4700842](https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/police-investigating-after-feces-reportedly-thrown-at-people-inside-libraries-at-york-u-of-t-1.4700842)",

I turned around in my chair and got a glance of him, he was black and the perp was around 35\\~45 or so, glasses and a graying beard. He was wearing construction attire, with dark clothes like a gray vest over dark clothes. I remember his shoes were ripped and torn up they were tan sneakers, and he was using gloves and carrying the blue bucket covered with a white towel the whole time. He sprayed deodorant all over himself to cover the smell up. I feel fucking terrible that I didn't realize something was awfully wrong, but maybe we can catch this guy by putting the word out.",

Students came running downstairs yelling and security was sent up within 5 minutes but by that time dude was gone. The poor guy who got the shit dumped on was with security for a while. Then third floor was shut down bc the lights were going wonky with all the shit in the circuits.\n\nThey caught his face on camera though so I hope they identify him and get him charged. \n\nIf someone has a first person account, do share.

When you say that this stuff doesn't happen at other campuses, it literally happened at U of T a few days ago. In the media, a lot of crime gets reported at York U, but in reality, it's no different than the other schools. Any crime that happens near the school gets reported as being near York University because the school is the major landmark that people know in this area. When something happens near U of T or Ryerson, it just gets reported as being in downtown. Incidents like these and others happen at all schools, not just York. Plus, it would be almost impossible to control access to this public campus. It's too out in the open with public roads going through it.",

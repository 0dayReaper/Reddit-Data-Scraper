I'm OK with how things ended up but I still think something else would have been better for me if I could go back and do it all again.",

I knew I was in the right program because I actually found the material interesting and I was quite passionate about the topics we touched on like violence against women. And also I was just genuinely curious and wanting to know more about topics we covered like corporate crime. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know for sure! There\u2019s always academic advising counsellors you can talk to.",

I must say there is definitely a little learning experience you have to go through when you have to write university level for the first time, so you should try to ask your TA for help on writing. I wouldn\u2019t really say people were cut throat to be honest, but this depends on the people in your tutorial. The people in mine were a bit quiet but everyone was kind and keeps to themselves tbh. umm to be honest I made a few friends here and there but not ones I would to talk to outside of school but that\u2019s because I personally am not trying to make friends much, just do well in school. I think as long you put effort, you will receive. to keep up with assignments and test, it\u2019s useful to print calendars and write down when your important test dates are so you can plan studying and working on it accordingly! I highly recommend this technique, and everything will go well as long as you are organized. You will do great! I\u2019d say professors and TAs really understand we were just first years. and people are not really that cutthroat. also I would follow the Criminology Society on Instagram. Sometimes there are study sessions for exams and I found them nice.",

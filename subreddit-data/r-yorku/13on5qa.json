    "postText": "\nHello, I would like to know if it is still worthwhile to have a hope regarding admission to the fall semester. In the application status it is still mentioned as Decision Pending and when I contacted the program admin, they mentioned that the graduate decisions come after 8-14 weeks after program deadline. The deadline for international applicants was Feb 15, 2023, and Domestic Deadline April 15, 2023.",

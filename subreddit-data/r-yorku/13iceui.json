Is it for the summer, if so you missed the deadline (March 15).\n\n\n\nLikewise, it says it cannot be a major requirement or be at the 3000 or 4000 level.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop\n\n\n\n\nIf anything I\u2019d suggest going in person to ask, that\u2019s probably the quickest way to do so.",

It's strange to hear that 3000 level courses cannot be transferred, because I specifically received a list of transferable credits from Athabasca University last year which had several 3000 level courses listed on the spreadsheet.\n\nIs there any way I can take the course/transfer it without it being on an LOP?",

LOP is if you are a current York student wanting to take courses elsewhere.\n\n\n\nHopefully someone else will know about transfer credits.\n\n\n\n\nBut yea, easiest way of getting in touch with departments at York is typically in person",

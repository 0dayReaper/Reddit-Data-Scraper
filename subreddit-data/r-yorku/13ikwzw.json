    "postText": "Hello,\n\nHope everyone is doing well and everyone sees this. I'm currently in the HRM Honours program but according to my grade report academic decision, it says **Winter 2023 Academic Decision: May not continue in program. Failed to meet program average requirement.** I have a major GPA of 4.13 and a cumulative GPA of 5.02 at this point. I've been in the HR program and was consequently shifted to the Work and Labour Studies program as a result of failing to meet program warning conditions. I took different electives to boost my GPA to 5.00 to be allowed to re-enter the program and after doing so, I petitioned and was allowed to enter the Honours program. Due to my enrolment access window opening late, I couldn't enrol in all HR courses, only managing to enrol in one. I've had top-notch grades ever since 2021 and I'm currently panicking and confused. My degree progress report hasn't appeared either ever since. I am currently in my 5th year and soon will be entering 6th and desperately wish to graduate ASAP!! What should I do? Will I be kicked out? Will re-entering Work and Labour Studies program be my best bet (if that's a thing)?? Any advice other than academic advising will be solicited kindly.",

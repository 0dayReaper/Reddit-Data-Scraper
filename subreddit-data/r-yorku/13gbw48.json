There\u2019s a chance you \n get in, there\u2019s a chance you may not. The change itself costs $0 to attempt, so if you meet those minimum requirements, just submit the request and see. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose.",

Like why did the GPA go from 6.0 to an 8.0 in a few yrs? and if so shouldnt they update the site to give people a more realistic chance of their odds? I might end up applying to a program change that i know ill get into it vs one that i know i wont have a shot at and so whats the point of waisting that one chance i get at changing my program",

You\u2019re request still gets looked at so long as you meet their minimum requirements, but from there it depends on how many spots they have available in that year\u2019s class, and how competitive the pool of people looking to transfer is.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with graduate school admissions - UofT med asks for a minimum 3.6 (just below an A-) but is so competitive that it\u2019s unlikely someone wth a 3.6 gets admissions without an incredible application package otherwise.",

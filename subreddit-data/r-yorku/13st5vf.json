    "postText": "I need to raise my GPA by dropping a course that ended one year ago. However, I had deferred standing and the professor did not get back to me last December when I said I was able to hand in the assignments since my circumstances changed and i was now able to focus. My living situation caused me to not be able to complete the assignments and I feel like this is a valid reason to not have handed in my assignments because the course was all online. I also have email threads to multiple professors telling them about my circumstances to make sure I complete my work or inform them of what is going on, and since I have gotten out of that living situation, my grades and mental clarity have improved drastically, which is evident by me passing all my winter classes. I received a failing grade for the deferred course last month, but I'm wondering if I can still petition to withdraw late since I had deferred standing, and since i have email threads that show that I asked the professor if i could still hand in my assignments but she didnt respond. Last december is when i moved from that living situation and was able to finally focus. I even dropped my fall 2022 courses because of this and added 2 electives for winter that I completed.\n\nKnowing the context of my situation, does anyone think I have a chance?",

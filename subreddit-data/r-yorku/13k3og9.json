    "postText": "Do I still have a chance of being accepted for Computer Science or Security, when I originally passed Advanced Function with a 70, but i repeated to course and got a 98 on my midterms and for calculus I had a 64 on my midterms BUT my marks have improved since and I am now in the 70\u2019s. I did take a uni comp sci course this year but i only have an 81\u2026will that give me some consideration? \n\nI\u2019m genuinely scared of being rejected because I let my ego get a hold of myself and didn\u2019t accept any of my college applications. Therefore, if York and UofT doesn\u2019t accept me\u2026i\u2019m in the gutter. I recently looked at the admissions for York and it said I need to have at least a math average of 75% BUT no math grade below 65% (calc midterm avrg is 64%)",

    "postText": "Hi, how does credit allotment at York work? I have a couple of questions, any advise would really help me! \n\nFirstly  If I took a 6 credit and a 3 credit program in F term and just a 3 credit in W, what would my total credits per term be? \nI'm joining as a post degree student and I need to finish three prerequisites before taking any other core courses, however one of it is only available in winter and it's stressing me out cause I can't take any other required courses before finishing it. I've gotta maintain a full time student status so I'm just asking if I need to be taking other non-core programs to keep my credits at 9 per term. Thank you!!\n\nSecondly York has waived my general education requirement courses, however, If I were to take an AP/SOSC 1000 level program to satisfy my full time student requirements, would that work?. The program is approved for gen ed so will I be granted credits if I take the program despite gen Ed being waived?",

For example, a 6.0 Y course will be worth 3.0 fall/3.0 winter. \n\n\n\n\nThe only course you cannot take is if it is a specified equivalent (in which case it's credit exclusion).\n\n\n\nIf you are asking if you can take additional courses that are extra to your degree requirement, then yes you can.",

    "postText": "Hey, I was wondering if any of you had any recommendations or suggestions for my admission to York, I haven\u2019t got in but I kinda got a bad grade in grade 12 physics which will definitely affect my admission into university at York and was wondering if there\u2019s anything I can possibly due such as summer school or some sort. Can someone let me know.",

There\u2019s also external independent private schools that you can pay to do certain courses. They specialize in these exact types of situations.",

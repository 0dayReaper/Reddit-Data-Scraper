    "postText": "Hi, I'm a future first year student, and I've accepted my offer and also booked an enrollment appointment. However, the apppointment is at 9 AM on a school day, so should I be worried? like is it a zoom call or is it a general email? I also emailed them asking if they had any available appointments on weekends just in case. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nEdit 2: So mine was just an email stating which courses I need to take.\n\nEdit: This is what they replied with:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uey0329gnu2b1.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ad2614378604539c8094501d75c0909181a6f354",

            "comment": "Tbh it's really easy choosing courses. I'm a first year student as well. If you finish the enrolment tutorial which they send you on gmail, you get access to choosing your courses. In the tutorial they give you the courses you must take. There will be courses in your major that you gotta take, 1 natural science (NATS) course (3 or 6) credit, 1 social science (SOCO) or humanities (HUMA) course (6 or 9 credit). If you take a humanities course this year, you will have to take a social science course next year. If you take a 6 credit course this year, you will have to take a 9 credit one next year and visa versa. You need a general education course course accepted for your major as well for your field, for the Natural science and HUMA/SOCO course. You will also need a course that is outside your major (ex, if you're doing BCOM, your major courses are in ADMS, but you will have to take it outside of ADMS). It must be a 3 credit or 6 credit course. Also, make sure the courses you take start with \"AP\" because that is for york students. I made a mistake by trying to register into \"SB\" which is for schulich students. If a course you want to add is reserved, email or call the department and they will let you in. I used a visual schedule builder (which helps you plan your schedule instead of actually enrolling into a course). I used this to plan what time I want my classes and what days I want. I also had to check if there's no conflicts between the timing of my courses. Then I copy pasted the catalogue numbers (these are the numbers for your session and timing of the course you want. I copied those numbers and went onto registration and enrolment website (REM york) and I pasted them onto there and got the courses. Remember to also your fees for the courses by phone or online so you can stay in that course. It does seem a little confusing, so if you want, you can get on a zoom call if you'd like. Good luck!! ALSO you need to have at least 24- 30 credits first year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msbaaa2b6p2b1.png?width=3008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=19ee06e304e53cb1d71e1ac73c4ab8be072f8a81\n\nThis is how mine looks like on the enrolment tutorial. It differs according to the program you chose. Ima BCOM student so if you're not in the same program, you'll get a different one.",

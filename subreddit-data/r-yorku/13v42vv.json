            "comment": "Personally, it has its pros and cons (doing a full year course vs 2 halfs)\n\nThe con is that your grade can drop in the second semester. For example, let's say you had a 90 flat on a course after the midterm (which is in the fall exam period). Would've been an A+, but since it's a full year course, you got the next semester to get through. \n\nYou get into the final exam with a 91, and come out with an 88. That's obviously an A.\n\nNow an A+ (for 3 credits) and an A (for the other 3 credits) technically has a higher GPA average than having the A for the 6 credits.\n\n\nThe pro is literally the inverse of this. If you had a lower grade in the first half and got a higher grade in the other, you'll have the more favourable outcome.\n\n\nSigh, If only foresight was 20/20 as well... Then we'd make the best choice :P",

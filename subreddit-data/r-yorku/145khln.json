    "postText": "I need 120 credits to graduate so roughly 30 per year and even without the 6 credit geography course I was still 5 credits short (25 credits) with such a hectic schedule. All while a lucky friend in accounting has a much lighter course load with Mondays and Fridays off and she earns 30 credits for it.\n\nIs this normal for a first year cs student? A weekly burnout seems inevitable. Is there anything I should see if I can change or general tips?\n\nI'm also considering seeing if I can change to mainstream comp sci. and not the international degree since I've heard it's better but again I kind of don't know what I'm doing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hq3r3oigt25b1.png?width=1766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=947569e0b8c798cb4181e49f026546062cf5808b",

So I chose 2 physics courses cause I only took physics in highschool. It's not even relevant to computer science, just takes away focus from the actual coding classes smh",

I hoped to have the summer free but looking at my schedule now, it may be the way to go to avoid burnout. \n\nAlso since we're both doing an international degree, do you know more about what difference the degree actually makes? I chose it just cause I thought it would be cool to go abroad but I'm having second thoughts if it actually affects other things.",

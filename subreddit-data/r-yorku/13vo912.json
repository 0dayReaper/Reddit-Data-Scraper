Unfortunately I am away travelling right now and don\u2019t have access to a computer, but I am home on the 2nd of June. If I wait two days until i\u2019m home to select my courses, will they all be filled up?",

I\u2019d go through the course catalog and note down the catalogue numbers for courses you\u2019re interested in, keep them in your notes, and just copy/paste them into the Registration/Enrolment Module. It\u2019s not the greatest mobile experience, but you can still do it.\n\nYou\u2019re still enrolling before current students, but the time slots might not be the greatest if you wait those couple days.",

As for you electives/gen-eds, you may have limited selection as some of the courses might be full, but I highly doubt that. So overall, you should be fine. Good luck!",

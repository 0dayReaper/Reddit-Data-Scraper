What I did was take 3 courses full year courses (around 21 credits) and worked 20 hrs a wk. In the summer I would work 25 hrs a wk, and take 1 summer course from May to August (6 credits or 9 credits) or two 3 credit courses from May to late June and late June to mid August. People usually don\u2019t finish a 4 yr degree in 4 yrs. \n\nAlso, if you need help for more time on exams or assignments due to certain issues just get a doctors letter and give it to the counselling and disability services located at Bennett centre. Another thing I have to mention if you feel overwhelmed by school and let\u2019s say you\u2019re sick on an exam day. Just go to your doctor or a walk in clinic (York has a walk in clinic), explain you\u2019re sick, get a doctors note, email and provide the note to your prof asap so the professor can reschedule your exam for another day. I hope this additional info helps.",

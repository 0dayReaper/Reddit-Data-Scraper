(unless you're a person with disability)\n\nTo graduate in 4 fall/winter sessions (4 years, no summer) you need to take 15 credits per semester to add up to 120 credits in total for the honours degree.\n\nhttps://www.yorku.ca/laps/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2021/07/LASO-Honours.pdf\n\nsample degree checklist from 2021-2022 for a general idea.\n\nAgain, I highly recommend checking with an advisor for your first time. \n\nGood luck",

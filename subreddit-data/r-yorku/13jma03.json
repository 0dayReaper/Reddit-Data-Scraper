    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming BPA student. My enrollment begins on the 29th, to prepare I've been trying to sort my schedule using the virtual schedule builder.  There is a huge lack of information about the BPA program so any pointers would be appreciated! I would also appreciate any overall critique of the courses I am thinking about or about the timing of said courses. Specifically, how are the microeconomics and the macroeconomics courses? Should I just get both courses over with this year? And which accounting course is easier: Accounting for Human Resource Professionals or Accountimg for Non-Finnancial Managers? Also, I still need a 6.00 credit HUMA course. Can I please get some recommendations??\n\nThank you in advance!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqvczghzea0b1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f5759b7ba41da0dfad81ec2853ca35e0bf6ee9f",

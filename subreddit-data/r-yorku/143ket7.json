    "postText": "So I graduated last year with a Bachelor\u2019s in Graphic design and I\u2019m currently planning to study in Canada for my Masters. I did some research, and so far I saw many people recommending York.\n\nIssue is, I really want a good balance between art and technology but I don\u2019t know which program to go with: Digital Media or Design.\nSo now I have a bunch of questions that I\u2019m hoping to get some answers for, so please bear with me! Thanks! \n\n1. I\u2019m currently interested in learning Ui/Ux and delve more into digital design, but I also want a good amount of creative/artsy work. Which program is going be more suitable for that? \n\n2. I have zero knowledge in programming/coding, so my portfolio mostly consists of graphic design and illustration projects; will that make it harder for me to get into Digital media? And if yes, what can I add to my portfolio to strengthen it?\n\n3. My grades aren\u2019t that good, can I compensate with a strong portfolio? \n(They aren\u2019t the best but they\u2019re literally the exact bare minimum lol.)\n\n4. Will I be taught the fundamentals of programming and coding in Digital media or will they expect me to already know them? Especially since this is not undergrad. \n\n5. Chances of admission?\n\n6. Career options from those two programs? \n\n7. Any recommendations for other universities/collages that have what I\u2019m looking for? \n\n\nHope I didn\u2019t ask too much! and if possible please share any tips or advice you can give; that would be highly appreciated! \n\nTL;DR: Confused International student doesn\u2019t know what program to choose and worried about rejection (relatable).",

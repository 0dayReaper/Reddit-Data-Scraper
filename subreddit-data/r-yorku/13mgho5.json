I have the m1 MacBook Pro 16 inch, if you can afford it get it, its 2600ish but it\u2019s been amazing and the best purchase I ever made(I\u2019ve had it for a year now) Better than any windows laptop I used in the past",

                            "comment": "I think you are a bit off about battery life. The M1 macbook air has an advertised battery life of \\~18 hours and that's advertised, not actual battery life. Every company has advertised specs that are rarely achievable under normal operating conditions, and can only be achieved under extreme conditions. For the macbook's battery life, this means no audio playing, all features turned off such as bluetooth, screen on minimum brightness which is basically unreadable, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo one will get close to the 18 hour advertised battery life. Most tech reviewers at the time achieved roughly 10-12 hours with minimal tasks. Given that a student will likely have multiple things running (internet browser, maybe a lecture video or music, bluetooth to their headphones, high brightness, etc) then they are likely to get below 10 hours of battery life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe M1/M2 macbook air and pro are great products, don't get me wrong. Apple laptops last a long time, don't get viruses and have good specs. However, their real-world battery life has never been close to what is advertised and most people know that.",

Personally, I suggest the acer nitro 5 with 16 gb of ram, budget gaming laptop.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am a grade 12 student rn, and I got admitted to  engineering, I want to know what my first year would look like. What courses would I have (if I could get a list of courses), what would a day look like as an engineering student, how many courses a semester, how much would I need to spend in total in terms of fees (tuition, books etc.), where would most of my classes be (like the building)?\n\nIk there are a lot of questions but I would really appreciate the help!",

            "comment": "Your first year will be math, physics, and programming heavy with a hint of chemistry. In first semester, the topics covered will strongly overlap with grade 11 and 12 with some additions. In second semester you'll learn a lot of new things. Your first year is common to all engineering majors. [This link](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/mech/academics/undergraduate/undergraduate-courses/) is for mech eng courses, but like I said, all engineers take that first year set. Tuition is about $350/credit, so a 5 course semester will screw you out of $5,300. Expect about $50/class worth of textbooks/online BS *on average*, assuming you acquire textbooks that aren't linked to online systems for free somewhere else. Assume about $100/class in textbooks if you pay for all of your books like a hypothetical wealthy student would.\n\nMost of your classes will be in the Curtis Lecture Halls, Bergeron Centre, Lassonde Building, and the Life Sciences Building. A couple might be in the Chemistry building and the Victor Philip Building.\n\nTry and get Andrew Skelton/Ada Chan for calculus and Ada Chan for linear algebra. Trust me.",

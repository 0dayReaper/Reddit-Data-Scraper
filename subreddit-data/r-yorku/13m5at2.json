Unless you already know basic compsci AND linear algebra, it will be impossible to keep up. Gheynani is a horrible prof. His lectures are incomprehensible. I took linear algebra beforehand, and I still couldn't follow him. If you don't believe me, check his ratemyprof (and note that most of those 5-star ratings came over the span of 3 days in feb 2022, probably written by him).",

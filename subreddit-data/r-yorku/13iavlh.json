Sure its not as populated as Toronto but I def wouldnt consider it a remote region by any means. In terms of job prospects its hard to say -- one might argue that Toronto has better job opportunities but I would also say that with more people it also means more competition\n\nIn terms of ranking (if you care about that stuff) Carleton is currently at 14th position vs. YorkU is at 19th. \n\n[https://www.schoolfinder.com/Discover/Article/25/6120/2023-Macleans-University-Rankings-Computer-Science-Programs](https://www.schoolfinder.com/Discover/Article/25/6120/2023-Macleans-University-Rankings-Computer-Science-Programs)",

            "comment": "Courses: pretty much the same at all universities in Canada, just different textbooks. Like yea sure, uw and uoft might be a bit different because their coueses might go in dept and teaches core concepts. But any other uni is literally the same. So in terms of courses, york == carleton \n\nSafety: I would give this to carleton to be fair. But at the same time, if you look at the population, toronto has a lot more people than ottawa so crime rates are higher in Toronto. Safety: carleton &gt; york\n\nCampus: I would give this to york. York is the third largest uni in Canada and has amazing buildings. We have 2 student centers with lots of food places and geese :) we also have a pond and york lanes. Campus: york &gt; carleton\n\nOpportunity and Coop: almost the same. This is the universal truth if you like it or not ~ \"if u r not in uw, ur school doesn't matter. Nope, not even uoft\". And I say uoft bc they don't even have coop. They have pey which is like a one time 12 month straight work term. When it comes to cs, exp &gt; degree. Even then, Toronto has lots of job opportunities more than ottawa. Ottawa is the capital city so it's mainly gov jobs. Coop: york == carleton. \n\nTldr: Choosing one over the other doesn't matter at all since they are not uw. Pick the one which will benefit u the most. Look at the tuition fees and how much they are giving u towards scholarship. Look at the location. Which is closer to your home? Stuff like this",

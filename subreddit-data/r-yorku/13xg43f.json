Each day is wasted sitting online trying to understand how I should move forward but I\u2019ve still been in the same spot for the last 2-3 years now. I just came back from a short family trip where I visited one the most beautiful places in the world and it made me feel even more depressed because it didn\u2019t do anything to help clear my mind. I came back home to a feeling of hopelessness and doom looming over my head. I\u2019ve never seen any other women struggle the way I have in their lives after graduation. I wish I had someone to bond over my feelings of misery with.",

And also the suggestions of planning and so on.  A really apparently weird one that I'll mention, which is under the radar and might seem bizarre at first, is I find it helps me to get out of a rut by taking quick cold showers (e.g., 1-2 minutes under the coldest water)- can look up \"voluntary cold exposure\" or something if interested, I find there is nothing else for giving me a blast of energy which I can then use.",

They don\u2019t know shit about \u201ctherapy\u201d. \n\nWhat u wanna do if u feel lost its probably because you are overthinking. Get hyperactive doing anything. Just move in any direction. Action will bring u out of overthinking. Obviously dont do drugs or shit like that. But get a job, any job maybe ur good with people, get a job at retail etc. work 60-80hrs a week. I mean it. This helped me out a lot when i felt like i was in a rut. \n\nAnd then u suddenly start to figure out, what ur actually good at and then pivot. But moral of the story, take action. Dont listen to these dumbasses asking u to goto therapy. In the history of so called therapy, it never helped out anyone. Hope this helps",

It feels like you\u2019re in \u201climbo.\u201d I spent my time post-graduation to enjoy it, once I get a full time job I doubt I will have this much freedom because more responsibilities will come as I grow older.\n\nI saw this \u201cstoppage\u201d as something good. I spent many days applying for jobs but the time in between was used towards pursuing passions and goals that were conflicted due to my school schedule. I workout plenty now, learning to cook more recipes, walk rather than use car/bus, read more books, cleaned and decluttered my living space, get certificates, remove and or confront harmful habits that I have and learned skills towards my resume. \n\nThe way I see it, I needed to work on myself and the \u201climbo-phase\u201d that is transitory from university life-post uni life allowed me to do so. If it helps, I started small with these changes and I noticed my mental health has been better. Hope these suggestions are helpful for you OP!! I\u2019m certain you\u2019re not alone because I too felt the exact same way &lt;3",

If people majored in a specific program and knew what they wanted to do after undergrad -- pursue further education; pursue a PhD to become a professor, teachers college, go to law school, people like that have a path. But if students went to university simply to get a degree and leave then obviously the main purpose afterwards is you apply for jobs. That depends entirely on the person and who they know. People could be done university, know someone in construction and work in construction post university. Others will elect to work the 9a-5p job is what most people do. The capitalist system, the political system of government parties, the work system is all manipulation. The main purpose in life is to work, make enough money, retire financially sound with a good pension and good decisions and retire one day.",

I thought I did everything right but I didn't really think about practical experience or that what I did, which was a lot for me and stressful, was not enough. And that I'd still have to embellish my experience to get a job. And then a lot of other things started to crash down in my life as well, trauma I've been avoiding came up, idk. I've been in burnout for a long time, I'm just trying to slowly pick up the pieces and find my passions again. For a little bit the downtime was great, I learned to bake and cook well, I expanded on my knowledge from school, I started new hobbies. My situation is a little different because there are big things that have caused crashes, but you just need to find what's right for you. It's possible you still need to really \"find yourself\". Reading certain \"self help\" books and psychology helped me understand myself and my discontent. Therapy does help sometimes but even just a good friend to talk to that you can trust and be yourself around. It can be really hard to find yourself after schooling, everything was set, there were social groups and events, afterwards it's pretty lonely and scary honestly. Just take your time.",

Not an academic route but one that is directly tied to a career: Speech Pathology, Education Policy, Library Science, etc. There are so many to choose from and schools do a terrible job of making students aware of the possibilities. \n\nYou'd be back in a structured environment with a clear direction, and you'd have a focused direction coming out that leads to a career path.",

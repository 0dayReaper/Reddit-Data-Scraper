    "postText": "Hey guys, So im a first year student going into second year, right now Im in a general BA IT but I want to change it to Specialized Honours but I need a 5.00 GPA for it and my GPA is pretty low. I started falling behind and couldnt keep up, everything was so new to me which resulting in me failing a class but I'm retaking it this summer. I did sign a late withdraw petiton to get the F off of my transcript. Now I received an email stating that I might need to taking 12 months off of my studies since my GPA is below 4.0. I thought of taking another summer class AP/HUMA of 9.00 credit to boost my GPA or I can also take a Fundamentals of Learning in the Fall. I dont really know what to do. I dont want to take a 12 month break. I tried to add the AP/HUMA course BUT I HAVE AN ACADEMIC BLOCK even though my balance is below 1500 dollars. I emailed the financial aid and theyre taking forever to get back to me and I want to cry please help",

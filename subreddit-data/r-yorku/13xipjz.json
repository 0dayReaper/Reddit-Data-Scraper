    "postText": "Hello,\n\nDoes anyone have an extra ticket to convocation? My ceremony is #5, June 19 2023, 3:30pm.\nIf you have an extra ticket and are willing to give it away, I would be very grateful.\n\nEDIT: To everyone trying to sell me tickets in DMs; you got those tickets for FREE! If you're not going to use them, why not give them away? You're really trying to profit off of something that is supposed to be an important familial moment? People's loved ones are going to miss their graduations all because you guys want to turn a profit. We already get York'd by the admin all the time and now you guys have moved on to York-ing each other. Pathetic.",

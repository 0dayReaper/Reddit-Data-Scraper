    "postText": "I got into york in december where my average (midterms first sem, i only had 2 classes\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80) was 88.5. Since then i have kinda stopped caring about school so my average has dropped. I'm going into math bsc, would a 82-85 be enough to keep my offer. And lets say i actually do horribly and get a 78-82 average, would i still be good?",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm entering my first year at York for Psych BA and just recieved my residence acceptance. I originally applied for Calumet since it's affiliated with my program (and close to my classes) but got an offer to Pond instead. Is that alright? How's the area around Pond? Is it worth the price, and if not would it be possible to transfer? \n\nAlso is it worth buying a meal plan.  \n\n\nP.S My second choice was Taitham.",

            "comment": "Pond is really good, although they raised the price significantly this year. It might be a bit stressful for a first-year student, especially if you haven't lived by yourself before (there's a reason why they recommend traditional residence for first-years). If you reject the room offer, you can be put back on the waitlist and you should receive a different offer without too much trouble. The area around Pond has some decent food but is slightly more dangerous than other parts of campus (not by much). \n\nAs for meal plans, you have to pay an additional fee on top of the tax-free money on your YU card. The tax exemptions don't make up for the extra fees unless you buy the gold plan (or more), so if you live in Pond, where you have a kitchen, it's really not worth it. For traditional residence, it is worth it.",

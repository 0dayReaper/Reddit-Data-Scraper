    "postText": "I'm an international student and I submitted my study permit application a cauple days ago and I've been really stressed about getting it in time (I'm from Iran by the way). I was hoping to learn about how long it took you guys to get your study permits and if it's possible to not miss start of term since I think I applied kind of late. \nAnd how does one go about getting plane tickets and stuff like that when you can't really be sure if you even will get your study permit in time or not?",

April 20th I did biometrics and the medical examination (upfront, don't wait for them to ask it if it is a requirement for Iran). My application  got approved on May 18th, so the 7 weeks they said.\n\nIf everything is OK with the documents and you do the medical exams upfront you should have your results by the end of July. I know it really drives us crazy with anxiety. You will make it! I'm rooting for you.\n\nConcerning airplane tickets - maybe buy a more expensive one that allows you to cancel and get a full refund should anything go wrong? Or maybe just try your luck on waiting to see if the prices won't go crazy high.",

But ig there is nothing I could do about that haha.",

I met some Iranian people when I was there for the first time (back in 2015). They wont discriminate against you.\n\nIf everything is OK with your proof of funds, the course you are entering makes sense and you show you have ties to your home country on your letter of explanation, you should be ok! That's what matters the most. If you have a travel history to other countries it helps as well.\n\nIn case you do happen get a refusal, reach out to the international students department, they will have professional help for that as well! https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/your-application/how-apply/international-student\n\nWishing you good luck and take care of your mental health in the meantime! This is the most stressful part of the process. It will be worth it",

    "postText": "I got into York with the program of my least choice (psychology) . The program I wanted to get into was engineering but the decision on the offers reads \u201cYou are not eligible at this time.\u201d I seen a few people say it\u2019s a rejection. My functions mark is under the required prerequisites. If I accept the physc offer would I be able to switch into eng or will I have to redo functions and apply again? If so when could I reapply? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks",

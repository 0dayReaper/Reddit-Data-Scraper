    "postText": "What grade should I aim for to get into Computer Engineering in second year of engineering? I missed the Guarantee Form so I may not be able to get into Computer Engineering because I'd have to compete for it now. Should I just go into Aerospace Engineering at TMU or try to compete for Computer Engineering at York? Computer Engineering is what I want to do and I'm afraid I might not be able to get into it because I'm not guaranteed for it. Any tips would be much appreciated.",

What\u2019s your current GPA?\n\n\nRegardless of your grade, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be getting into any of the majors since you have not declared any. Was your original offer \u201cUndeclared Engineering\u201d?\n\n\nYou should be speaking to a academic advising ASAP to understand your major selection without the form being submitted. Deadline for the declaration form was May 1st. Last year, the cutoff CGPA for EECS majors was a 7 but then again the GPAs were inflated due to the online courses.\n\n\nI spoke to the EECS department recently and they said that they are expanding the program with additional seats. I\u2019m sitting at a 6.61 CGPA and was told I \u201cshould be okay\u201d for Computer Engineering. No guarantees though, we will know for sure at the end of June.",

I read the [engineering program guarantee page](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/discover/engineering-program-guarantee), and I still don't quite understand your situation.\n\nA.)  Are you currently still a grade 12 student, or did you just finish your first year at York in April?\n\nB.)  If it's already May now, why are you so confident that you think you can successfully transfer to TMU by the time September starts?  Such a thing might be possible, or it might not.  I don't know.",

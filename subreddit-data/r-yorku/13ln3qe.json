    "postText": "Hey everyone, still using a throwaway account here. I really apologize for my insanely confusing situation but any kind of support would be greatly appreciated. I have already had a breakdown regarding this but that isn't going to help solve the problem so I asking if anyone has any advice.\n\nI had made a post yesterday regarding a deferred exam I had written where in the email it was stated that the exam would be for 3hrs but the prof. took my exam away after 2 hrs claiming that only the room was booked for 3hrs. I thought this situation was extremely unfair and I had ended up leaving quite a few questions blanks (thinking I still had 1 more hour to complete it). You can check the post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/13lb9vy/email\\_stated\\_deferred\\_exam\\_was\\_3hrs\\_but\\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/13lb9vy/email_stated_deferred_exam_was_3hrs_but_after/)\n\nJust to note my final exam was worth 80% of my grade. I feel like if I simply email the prof he won't really do anything and might even get mad.\n\nAs stated my final was worth 80%. This is because I had missed the midterm as well so my final exam was worth around 80% and I studied extremely hard for this, of which definitely did not get reflected on the exam itself due to the whole 2hr/3hr situation.\n\nObviously the prof. will not boost my exam mark by any means so the only other alternative (which I think is fair) is the following: Since I had missed the midterm exam, in April, the prof. had emailed those of us who had missed the midterm exam about our options: We can either write a make-up midterm exam OR have our grades transferred to the final. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v5yxs8odq0b1.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=895656f84b8e611f588fc1893d12593d9959e8b9\n\n**Technically I had never stated to him which option I wanted.** Do you think I can email the prof. requesting that instead of my final being worth 80% that I am able to write the make-up midterm exam in the next few days? And if so how should I approach it? There are 2 ways I could do this:\n\n1. I could in detail explain my case regarding the confusion about the length of the deferred final exam and this is a very big deal to me because that exam was worth close to my entire grade. And thus, if I would be allowed to write a mid-term make up so some of that weight would get transferred.\n2. Not mention anything about the final exam confusion and simply ask the prof. if I can write the make-up midterm now that the final and deferred have both been complete.\n\nPlease any kind of advice or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! Or please feel free to PM me if that is easier -- I just really need someone to talk to about this and see if I can get any support and guidance.",

            "comment": "This is overall just a weird situation. You can try, but if there was a deadline or any sort of communication that implied the option to move the midterm weighting to the final, then they may use that as justification to say no. They may also just say no because you\u2019re making the choice based on the exam results (which would be unfair to those who wrote the midterm and didn\u2019t get this option).\n\nIf you\u2019re representing this 2/3 hour exam situation accurately, you could to go the undergraduate program director for the department the course is part of to explain what happened. The communication in your other post reads as a 3 hour exam, so you may have a case there, unless there were some major other things you\u2019re leaving out. Also, the professor could just say it was announced as 2 hours at the beginning of writing. Was there anybody else there who also experienced this?",

I feel like if I bring the 2/3 hr situation to the prof and THEN ask if I can get a makeup midterm he will def say no. So I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll just leave that out and just ask if I can do a midterm. Nope he didn\u2019t specify any deadline at all. That\u2019s the problem with this prof\u2026he doesn\u2019t specify anything\u2026he didn\u2019t bother specifying the length of the exam and nor did he specify the deadline in which we have to tell him about the makeup midterm. \n\nIf the above fails then i could possibly take the 2/3 hr situation to the program director to see what they say. The only thing is that I found one email where the prof sent in April about how long the final was (2hrs) but apart from that it wasn\u2019t communicated anywhere on eclass nor on the syllabus, nor on the actual day of the deferred exam and nor on the exam paper itself.",

The email could be used as evidence that you were reasonably under a different impression on the length, even though a previous email and the original exam had said 2 hours. However, even with this contradiction, if 2 hours was communicated at the start of the exam you wrote, then anything contradictory before that wouldn\u2019t have much impact.",

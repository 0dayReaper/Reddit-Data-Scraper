    "postText": "I've gotten in and it seems to be my best option (schulich bba or laurier bba). I've been hearing from everybody that schulich is extremely hard but no one ever quantifies it. I can't find any information on it, and I don't know if I can handle it. How many hours of work are required per week? How many assignments? How heavy is the bellcurve? I plan on trying to break into IB if possible.\n\n I also want to mention that I don't consider myself a smart student, even though I got in, I cut many corners and instead of focusing on learning I focused on grades. If I have to compete with the students who actually deserved the 95+ in high school I might be fucked.",

York is hard to make friends just like that and continuing especially if you dont live in vaughn. Not saying its impossible but if you want that real uni experience like in the movies then go for laurier.",

            "comment": "The only people I have heard say that Schulich is extremely hard are high schoolers. Are you talking to any university graduates? You can reach out to students and alumni on LinkedIn.\n\nLaurer BBA co-op is good but you need an A- average in the first year to get into it. If you can get an A- average at Laurier, you can get at least a B+ average at Schulich. Also, let's be real. Schulich and Laurier BBA are tier 2 schools for investment banking. You need strong grades and networking/connections to have a shot at IB from these schools. If you are worried about competing for grades at Schulich, you probably will not get into investment banking. You will not be able to compete with Ivey and Queen's commerce students for IB jobs if you cannot even do well at tier 2 schools like Schulich and Laurier BBA. If you cannot handle the workload in these programs, you have no business being in IB which will require you to put in 80-100 hours/week.\n\nRepeatedly asking this question is not going to change the outcome. There will be top students attending both these programs that you will have to compete with to get in the top 10% of the class. If you want IB, you will be competing with top students from a wide range of business schools for the few IB jobs in Canada. If you are going into a competitive business field, you cannot let competition scare you off or you will not make it in this field. Even after getting a job in the field, you will still be competing constantly for clients, promotions, and opportunities. By its nature, business is a competitive field filled with Type A personalities. You need a thick skin and a hustler mindset to do well in it. If you are not prepared to hustle in an undergraduate business program to attain your goals, then you are going into the wrong field. \n\nIn conclusion, if you are serious about trying for IB, you need to readjust your mindset and do research outside of high schooler forums and talk to actual business students and industry professionals. You need to look into what a career in IB entails and the kind of personality and mindset you will need to survive in it.",

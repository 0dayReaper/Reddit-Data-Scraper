    "postText": "Enrolment is coming up this month and I have about 48 credits left.\n\nI did 5 semesters and took a semester off for personal reasons in my third year. So essentially I have 2 semesters of 4th year, 1 semester of 5th year left (since I took 1 semester off my degree is extended by a semester), and 1 summer semester where I take 1 course (I\u2019m also doing a minor where I need some extra courses which I am getting by taking courses this summer and 1 course next summer).\n\nI could do 5 courses a semester for those 3 semesters plus the 1 course during the summer.\n\nOR I could do 8 courses for the fall-winter 2023-24 term, and 8 courses for the fall-winter 2024-25 term, which would extend my degree to a full 5 years.\n\nI\u2019m conflicted about whether or not I should go for 4.5 years or 5 years to finish my degree.\n\nReasons for 4.5 years\n- less time spent in school\n- I only have to take one 3 credit course in the next summer to fit all my requirements in\n- I\u2019m a commuter with 1 hour and 20 minutes on the bus so it\u2019d be an extra semester of commuting which can be exhausting\n- my mental health decreases during school semesters (versus working) so maybe getting done with my degree faster would be better (this upcoming year would be my last full fall-winter term and after that I just have one more full-time semester)\n- I have to finish my degree in five years for my program so if something goes wrong in my last year I have no wiggle room to take time off or extend my degree if I already planned my courses to end at 5 years (and therefore can\u2019t take any more time off)\n\nReasons for 5 years\n- lower stress\n- I won\u2019t have to do summer courses while working full-time during the summer\n- I\u2019ll have 4 courses per term instead of 5\n- courses can fit into 2-3 days on campus versus 3-4 days on campus if I have to do 5 days in-person (will 4 days in-person be hard to manage with a long commute? I\u2019m not sure because I haven\u2019t had a fully in-person term with more than 3 days on campus due to covid and taking a semester off)\n- I don\u2019t think I want to go to grad school, but if I do a lighter course load could help me increase my GPA (it\u2019s a B right now and if I were to go to school some of the programs I was looking at require B+ or higher)\n- more time for socializing which I feel like I missed out on due to covid and taking semester off (but also no guarantees people will want to socialize since a lot of my classmates like me are commuters and go home after school)",

Personally took me 4.5 years but graduating with distinction. I have friends who have a GPA or 5-6 merely for honors graduated in 4 years. Gpa is imp too\nTake this stress rather than stressing an extra semester. I have been workinh full time past 3 years if it helps.",

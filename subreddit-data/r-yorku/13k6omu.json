    "postText": "Hello folks,\n\nI am a HS student, wanting to Go into the Game Industry mainly into the Art and Design part, but also have some interest into coding and development. I was doing my research and find the Program at York to be a good. But I feel like having an opinion from someone in the course or someone who has better knowledge about it. \n- I wanted to know what the program teaches specifically after taking the Game Arts Stream.\n- How good or bad the program. Or an general overview.\n- Is the Degree worth it, In terms of credibility and employability. \n\nThank you in advance:)",

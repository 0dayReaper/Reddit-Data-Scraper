    "postText": "Dear professor Gillian A McGillivray, you do not have my support. You see, I understand having unions. I also understand striking to improve working conditions. However, I cannot understand using over 50,000 students as pawns in your battle against your employer in order to improve your contract. A contract that already places you in the very top of the middle class.\n\nYou see, Gillian A McGillivray, you earned over $150,000 last year. You have great benefits. Your job security is off the charts. You also get an amazing pension. You have employment conditions that most Canadians could only dream of. Your great employment conditions is one that most of us affected students will ***never*** be lucky enough to have. \n\nSo excuse me if I cannot comprehend how you are not happy with your current employment conditions. You and your colleagues are negatively impacting over 50,000 students because you want a significant raise, better benefits and a reduced workload. You have decided to strike, and will potentially force the semester to be extended. This negatively impacts me as I have spent the last 3 years saving up to go for a vacation, and have booked my flight for right when the semester ends. Now I will miss my vacation and will lose my money, just because you are using me as a pawn in your silly games.\n\nAlso, could you believe that it took me 3 years to save up for a single vacation?  No, you couldn't. You can't because you make over $150,000 a year and money is of no issue to you. So let me introduce you to what my employment conditions are like, and hopefully you will understand why it took me so long to save up for a vacation.\n\nYou see, I have been on my own since I was a teenager and have to provide for myself. That means I work full time in a warehouse overnight then I go to my university classes in the morning. This is followed my hours of studying and 1-3 hours of sleep. Every. Single. Day. Also, did I mention that my workplace gets so cold in the winter that we all have to wear two jackets. In the summer, it gets up to 45 degrees inside as we do not have A.C. \n\nSo, I get no sleep on a daily basis, I spend 8 hours a day lifting heavy materials for minimum wage, and have no money to spare after buying the necessities. Oh, I also don't get any benefits to help with all the side effects i get from working nights, not getting enough sleep, and not being able to ford decent food. I know you have crazy good benefits so you cannot comprehend that.   \n\n\nBut you know what, I work in such shitty conditions, yet I never complain outside of this open letter. I always put a smile on my face and put my hardest effort in at work and school. I do what I have to do because no one else will help me. You see, I do not have any other choice. Unlike you, I do not have the luxury of using 50,000 students as pawns in a chess game in order to improve my own life.",

I'm sorry you're in those conditions, where you work sounds like it sucks and abuses you, but you're pulling through!\n\nThat's what people do, they persevere even in the worst conditions, and the profs want more when they already have the most in great conditions. I support their cause, but they can't toss us around like pawn pieces. We didn't sign up, so we should not and cannot be affected.",

It a union always comes to the table with ridiculous demands, it\u2019s not the employer\u2019s fault for not meeting them. Having been in CUPE through 2 strikes, and one bargaining round where the offer was actually accepted without a strike, I can\u2019t say that the administration played much of a role in those strikes. Rather the culture of the union that seems to enjoy strikes and supports shouting down all but the most radical voices attempts to force a strike at every opportunity.\n\nRegardless, you should look at what is happening in every individual strike. There are different issues each time, and it\u2019s not always on administration. The fact that the administration has kept YUFA from striking for 25 years can also point to the problem being in the specific union that does strike all the time.",

But seriously, York is not bargaining in good faith and have been spending our tuition money on lawyers to help make this strike happen rather than listen to the profs. Their strategy has been just to ignore demands and present the same agreement over and over again. You're as much, if not more of a pawn to the admin than the profs because there now is pressure from members of the student body to take a shittier deal. \n\n2. Yes the profs are more privileged in their jobs, but most of the arguments are based on job security, not pay, for a majority of their members. Many profs I know that are not tenured and are constantly working because their positions are not guaranteed and can be removed on a whim. They are also paid significantly less than tenured profs, it's why non-tenured profs are always asking for the class feedback to be filled out because their jobs depend on it. Even if it was about pay, York still is posting profits and can afford to give a raise, heck they funded the construction of the newer campuses even after the Ontario gov't backed out.\n\n3. I sympathize with your current situation because I worked shitty full-time jobs over my undergrad to afford school. Some days I would work overnight, then have to lift as soon as I got to campus for the football team, then would go to class where we're graded on participation. I've survived many TA strikes (2014 was the worst cause I had to drop out for a bit afterwards) and while it was stressful, profs are usually accommodating because they know the situation sucks for students (unless you're in STEM cause my partner that studied that stuff says those profs are not empathetic at all).",

Most typically their titles will be Assistant Professor or Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream. Those faculty are in tenure-track positions but haven't yet made tenure/promotion (T&amp;P). It takes about 5 years from being hired to earn T&amp;P. So they work hard during that time to complete all the requirements to earn T&amp;P, including needing strong teaching scores.\n\nThose faculty are normally hired at a lower salary than tenured faculty of course because they lack experience. I'm not implying that their salaries are low as some do start at $100,000 or more but not all. Their positions cannot be 'removed on a whim' though as being in a tenure track position has obligations from both parties. It is, however, possible to not be successful during the process and then lose one's job.\n\nAlso there are SRCs and CLAs who are full-time but not on the tenure track and they are members of YUFA. So be careful to not automatically exclude some faculty from YUFA membership.",

They don\u2019t have a position to be guaranteed because that\u2019s what happens when you take a limited contract position. The previous strikes by sessional lecturers and TAs had job security issues because the main driver behind the strike is often how many sessional lecturers are converted to full time each year. They actually have a sort of \u201cjob security\u201d that was added, in that any positions that are available can first go the the person with the most seniority. In practice, this allowed people with the most seniority to push out those with less seniority, concentrating the positions to only the most senior people and reducing the opportunity for anyone new to come in. The job security for these people would effectively amount to being given tenure just for teaching and waiting long enough.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to bring a professor than the job of a sessional lecturer, so of course the pay is different.\n\nThis is a strike by professors though, so job security is less of a concern because they can earn tenure. There are also a lot of other issues that have come up due to the pandemic and moving courses online.",

There is talk of contracts being extended as a result of the strike action if necessary, but that probably doesn't help a lot of people. I personally have another job starting (outside Canada) in May so my time at York will end at the end of April, making this strike particularly ill-timed. And similar to you, I don't benefit at all, but it could have a positive effect further down the line for others.\n\nAll that to say, a lot of us don't have secure, well-paying jobs but unions and, when necessary, striking is actually good. Of course it is frustrating for students who are caught in the middle in some sense, but strikes are designed to be an inconvenience so that the employer takes negotiations seriously.\n\nI don't want to strike. It's inconvenient, I might lose pay, it will certainly make the last of my time at York less pleasant and more stressful, but ultimately it's important and worth it if strike action becomes a reality.",

This is an Associate, but do you know what happens to assistants who do not get renewed after 6-10 year post-graduate work and 5 years as an instructor? They are fired and not really employable.  Name one job with those standards.\n\n2. No one's job security is \"off the charts\". See Laurentian. You like your mythology.\n\n3. \" You get an amazing pension\". Only after 30 years of employment, and because she will have paid into into it for 30 years, which will be a significant portion of her salary for that time. This is not free money ignorance would suggest. \n\nLastly, your letter is the \"Race to the Bottom\" mentality that is very popular among ON Conservatives: who want a mostly mimimum wage world. Projecting your personal situation on this is narcissistic and implies that only you know how to work hard.\n\n\nI look forward to your letter a few years from now when you can't get the job you feel entitled to because you got a university degree.

I don't think students should be caught in the middle and suffer when it's not their fault. It doesn't mean that I am against unions per se.\n\nSome members of Profs4Change (a subset of YUFA members), as well as some other people, made the same declaration.\n\np.s. I posted at this point rather than with the relevant posts because for some reason I kept getting an error message but only for that part of this site.",

If these people were on a general strike campaign for all workers in the country and started a movement to combat inflation i would be much more sympathetic but thats not what is going on. It is just about their upper middle class aspirations. \n\nI would like to add that even for those of us who do come from working class families\u2026this hurts us because none of us got raises in line with inflation and now we are asked to hold up our summer job plans/vacation/rental agreements in order to be the pawns in their fight against their employer.\n\nIt just goes to show university students always get shafted no matter what.",

For them to suck it up for our sake after already attempting negotiations for 1.5yrs and no contract for 10 months?",

The gooses on campus want the campus for themselves, they're actually the ones behind this whole strike thing. The gooses secretly have control over several YUFA members. You see, the gooses believe that we have no right to be on campus which they consider to rightfully be their land. Their plan is to shut down the school and to take the buildings for themselves. During the Covid crisis they managed to take control of most of the benches. Ever wonder why York strikes so often? Fact: The gooses control 50% of the power on the campus, their influence goes deep into every department, union and club.  \n\n\nMcGillivray may not realize it but the truth is that she's just being a pawn of the gooses. YUFA might think that they're using students as pawns, maybe not but the one thing that I'm certain of is that the gooses are trying to use YUFA as a pawn and I don't think YUFA realizes that, please warn your professors, God(s) bless!",

Her first job after graduating took her 4 years to move past as she was at entrance level where sometimes your great work isn't given the spot light it should have. She has now another job (promotion) her pay more than doubled no not $150000/yr. like this teacher (and just to get on topic I do side with your comment those teachers should not be looking for students support) but more money a year than we've ever seen.  She now is planning on her first purchase of a condo or home all on her own as she is single.  I asked her the other weekend because she has had some of the longest work days I've seen and many tears on my part have gone out because of how hard her struggle has had to be to get to the place she is now and she is still climbing with many many dreams like having the money for drivers Ed this year etc etc.  She said if she had to go back she would do it all again because the success would never feel as sweet as when you can say you did it yourself.  You will get there too, never give up on your dreams.  You will one day be looking back with pride patting yourself on the back for doing this. And if my daughter sees this WE ARE SO IMMENSELY PROUD OF YOU \u2764",

The administration is eroding faculties by routing millions to investments (like the Markham campus) - spreading itself so thin that it could end up like Laurentian. By taking away funding for programs and faculties, which admin is doing, they are reducing the quality of your education. If you took the trouble to read what it's about on the YUFA website, you would have a better grasp of what is happening with the corporatization of education. Admin is also eroding rights of faculty, proposing cutbacks to pensions, even with a huge surplus. And why should MPs and donors of the current govt for example be able to vote themselves huge pay rises when profs and nurses, amongst others, are limited to 1%, well below inflation? As to working a job while at University, it might occur to you that your professors had to do the same, before they completed their many years of education to become profs. Unions protect rights. If there had never been unions, kiddo, you'd be a slave with no education and no upward mobility.",

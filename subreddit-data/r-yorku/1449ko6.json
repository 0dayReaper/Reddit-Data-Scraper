Which one would be better?\nThoughts?",

If you want to do the 1090 in 2nd year then i gues you can push 1019 to winter imo.\n\nYou can check this link to know a lot about york's cs prerequisites.\nhttps://presidentkevvol.github.io/YorkCSClassList/",

Of course you'll need to apply it, but that's where the lines get blurred between computer science and software engineering. (The latter is often defined as more so process management as it relates to software design and construction.) I don't disagree that CS has a strong applied component, but if OP is going to be fazed by too much theory, they should be in engineering.\n\nBut hey, you're onto something. Because 90% of CS students are wannabe **software developers** instead of **computer scientists**, nearly every school has focused their curriculum onto the applied subjects since that's what people want to learn. I argue that it's made CS degrees into SE lite, but I digress.\n\nYou still need to actually learn the concepts before you start programming algorithms; anyone can code a simple Python script, but it's not trivial to prove correctness or analyze runtimes.",

What I am contending is that if you are not prepared for CS theory, you should be in engineering instead. And that's perfectly okay. It's like saying that those kinds of people shouldn't take pure math...well duh. I'm one of those people and that's one reason why I picked engineering.\n\nComp Sec is different as that is an applied discipline meshing computer science, cryptography, software engineering, etc. So in fact you guys do take a lot of application courses.\n\n&gt; Soft eng. is just as theory heavy as CS is, most of the difference between soft eng and CS is program focus in later years\n\nSE does not take EECS 2001 or 4101, which are the heaviest courses in terms of theory. 2001 in particular has little practical relevance to most software projects outside academia.\n\n&gt; The academic calendars for both are available at https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/academic-calendar#/programs/ if you're actually interested in learning the differences instead of being a pedant.\n\nBelieve me, I know, I graduated CE after seriously considering all of CE, CS, and SE as majors.\n\nI don't know why this is even an argument. You clearly do not understand what computer science actually is supposed to be and what the actual goal of a CS degree is. It's not to make you a good programmer but rather a good computer scientist. Typing code into a computer is generally pretty easy these days (how long does it take for a noob to get a Python script running, 2 minutes?), it's reasoning about it that's hard. See how much actual coding a CS major has to do in 4th year and get back to me. Hint: none, if they so choose, cause it's all electives.\n\nWhatever, I'm about to delete this account anyway in protest of the Reddit API changes, so yeah.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in second year and just completed a final. The whole semester I had a 75%+ on all of my exams (80% of the grade) and I walked into the final confidently. I received a grade that was extremely surprising afterwards emailed my professor as I was confused. He said I got 18% on my final and the entire exam was multiple choice - scantron. I was totally confident when I walked out. I emailed the prof and still no reply. Is it possible that there was an error w the computer scanner?? Anyone have a similar experience?",

I've had TWO courses where the profs inputted the grades wrong, they put the grade for the students off by one for one component (ex. student A's quiz grade was actually student B's quiz grade etc.), I also know one of my classes this semester had the calculation messed up on EClass because of the new update, so it's very possible something went wrong!",

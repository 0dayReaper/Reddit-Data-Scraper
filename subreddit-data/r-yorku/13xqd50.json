    "postText": "I am an incoming undergrad for 2023/2024 and am taking a bachelors in commerce. I am wondering whether or not I should decide on taking honours and whether or not I can change it in second or third year. Also, what are some general good electives to take that are outside my major? Thanks",

            "comment": "Ok so the difference between honours and reg bachelor is that honours is a 4 Year degree while Bachelor is 3 yr degree. One requires 120 credits (honours) and one requires 90 credits (bachelor) in order to graduate. I\u2019m not too sure about changing later on but I believe you can take honours and chnage to Bachelors afterwards, just check with advisors. For general electives try the humanities dept with sociology or anthropology. Even NATS has some great courses! :)",

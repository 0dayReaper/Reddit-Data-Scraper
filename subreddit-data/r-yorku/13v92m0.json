You're much less likely to deal with bullshit as the owner doesn't generally put up with shenanigans in their home.  \n  \n Also, know your rights. 99% of the houses there are not up to fire code, so threaten to phone bylaw enforcement if the landlord tries to throw their weight around. Good luck.",

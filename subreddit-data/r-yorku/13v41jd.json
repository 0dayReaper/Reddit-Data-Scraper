It also depends on if it's a full year or one semester I guess.\n\nI had a class which consisted of 4 tests and nothing else.\nI have had classes that consist of assignments and a final exam.\nI've had classes with assignments, a midterm exam and a final exam.\nI had a class that was just a presentation and a final paper.\nI had a class with no formal tests or exams.\n\nI guess what matters is that tests exist in the University setting. I think sometimes names are interchanged in colloquial use. Quiz generally means it's worth less than a Test but sometimes people mix up the names. A midterm might be a Test. There's no consistent percentage amount for what they're worth and every Prof formats differently so I don't think it matters much.",

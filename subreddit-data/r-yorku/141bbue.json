            "comment": "You\u2019ve chosen your Gen Eds correctly to meet the requirements for first year, so it\u2019s a phenomenal start. You\u2019d be surprised how many people choose incorrectly. However, if you aren\u2019t married to these specific courses, I\u2019d try to get yourself a day off from classes. It\u2019s pretty easy as a psych major since the only mandatory course first year is PSYC1010. \n\nGap on Tuesday shouldn\u2019t be problematic if you use it to study, hang with friends, or become active in campus life (clubs, student council, work study jobs, etc). Sometimes, they\u2019re just nice to have a food break and to decompress. Everyone is a bit different in that respect. You\u2019ll find out this year. \n\n\n1770 is a great class for teaching you how to craft arguments, so if you intend on double majoring in English (just based on your elective choice), or some other liberal arts degree, it\u2019s a great pick for your MODR/SOSC Gen Ed. I took the same one and it was knowledge I used through grad school, too.\n\nBest of luck at York!",

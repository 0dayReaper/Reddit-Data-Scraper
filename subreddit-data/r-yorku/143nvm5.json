    "postText": "For anthropology (1120) and History of astronomy (1745), both courses say they are unscheduled. When could I expect to see a schedule for these courses? I don\u2019t want to add enrol in them until I know what day/time they take place, but I also don\u2019t want them to fill up before I have a chance to enrol. One course says \u201cfully online\u201d and \u201ctutr 02\u201d, and the other course says \u201conline campus\u201d. I\u2019m new to all of this stuff, help is appreciated.",

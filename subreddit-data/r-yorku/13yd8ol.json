    "postText": "My commute is about 1h and 30 minutes. For the upcoming fall semester, I will have 2 courses that are 7pm - 10 pm (no other times slots for theses courses) and will be on campus 4 days a week (couldn\u2019t reduce it further).\n\nI was wondering if it will be difficult to stay so late on campus? On one of those days, that night course is my only course, and on the day of my other night course, I\u2019ll be on campus starting from 11 am because of earlier courses.\n\nThe lastest a class has ever ended for me was 7 pm.\n\nWould it be too draining/difficult to have two night classes? If you\u2019ve taken night classes before, is there anything I should look out for or any advice that\u2019d be helpful to keep in mind?\n\nAppreciate any responses.",

Obviously, you need to be street-smart just as you would if you were walking anywhere populated at night. Bring dinner if you don't want to buy it.\n\nI've had back to back 6-9 and 7-10 classes, they're annoying if you have day classes also. But c'est la vie. You can deal with it, especially with the late start making it easier. They are no easier or harder than regular classes other than the timing.",

Since you probably get home late as well?\n\nOr do you think it\u2019s fine if you just shower and go straight to sleep once you get home? Because I realized it\u2019ll be 11:30 pm by the time I get home and I probably won\u2019t get to bed by 12am-12:30am.",

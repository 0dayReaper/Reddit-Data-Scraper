A high GPA helps, as does other qualifying factors on your resume like clinical experience, but GPA is the last deciding factor they care about. Interviewing well is worth its weight in gold. I had a strong application in my opinion, but the only reason I got so many offers was because of my interview skills (applied to 17, cancelled 3, got into all the remaining 14 schools. I really wanted to get in my first try so I got scared and applied to an insane amount of Florida/Georgia programs lol). \n\nDuring my clinical year I even interviewing for the incoming class, and this one dude had over 20,000 hours as a ER Nurse. Super impressive on paper, but the guy spoke like he didn't know his own name.",

With only 2 PA programs in Ontario (3 in the entire country) and both accepting less than 40 students, it\u2019s extremely difficult to get in. For Mac, we go through this preliminary interview kinda thing before the MMI, and that basically assesses how well you speak. This means it\u2019s a pretty safe assumption that almost everyone who does the MMI can interview well because they wouldn\u2019t have even got to this point if they couldn\u2019t. I also read online that for mcmaster\u2019s PA program, the weighting post interview is 60% interview and 40% GPA. This makes it almost 50-50, although the interview is still weighted more.",

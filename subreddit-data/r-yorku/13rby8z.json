    "postText": "I use english as a second language, and I hate to admit it but when writing essays my overall grammar and vocabulary are below average. So I was wondering if I can use a paraphraser in university (on my own work) and if that\u2019s considered cheating. Im honestly to embarrassed to ask for peer edits which is really weird I know.",

It's like Grammarly and helps give you ideas on how to elevate your writing. I use it to see what other words I can use instead and it helps me to expand my vocabulary for future essays!",

            "comment": "It is not possible to get your CPA within 4 years. In order to get your CPA designation, you need: 4 years bachelors with a specialization in accounting, 30 months of practical experience (after graduation), and pass all the CPA exams. There is different routes to pass these exams such as CPA PEP, graduate diploma, or masters. I simplified the process A LOT, but overall it'll take 5+ years minimum to get your CPA if you just began your bachelors right now. Let me know if you have any questions, I am in the process of completing my CPA exams right now.",

I think that co-op is vital for business and going to a university with a strong co-op program is vital. If OP goes to a prestigious business program and does their co-op terms in the big four they may be able to attain more opportunities that will help them with their cpa. These are just my two cents though, feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong.",

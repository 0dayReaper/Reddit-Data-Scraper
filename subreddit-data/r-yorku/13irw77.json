    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI've been spending a lot of time researching online trying to choose a program to attend keeping the fact that I plan on applying to Canadian med school, and I'm very confused! I'm aware the program I go to doesn't matter for med schools as long as I complete the prerequisite courses depending on the school. \n\nI am hearing many conflicting views on which program is more rigorous for obtaining a high GPA, so I was wondering if any of you have insight on this. I was set on York Kinesiology &amp; Health Science (BSc), but I've heard that the BA option would be more favorable for GPA since it has less calculus/science requirements as I've seen comparing the program information pages for the BSc and BA degrees. \n\nThere's also the biomedical sciences, psychology, and biology programs that students who intend on applying to medical school take, and some argue that biomedical sciences and psychology are easier or than York Kinesiology. \n\nI would really appreciate any advice you can give me on the differences between the programs for someone who wants to have the best conditions possible for med school admissions! Of course, I plan on working hard wherever I end up :)\n\nThank you again for your help and I hope you have a great rest of the week everyone!",

They're all good programs that you listed there. But I agree with @nyc_1999 that even if the program is difficult, you should do the one you'll think you'll enjoy the most as you'll do better and you'll be more willing to study in a program you like, no matter the difficulty level.",

            "comment": "Yeah it's so different for everyone for example lots of people say that Psyc BSc is great for pre-med nowadays because Psyc courses are usually easier to do well in ( then they take the science courses for MCAT knowledge as electives), but I'm in Bio/Biomed and my grades are great because I am good at math, and science (Bio, Chem)... I feel like I am better in Bio/Biomed because it suits my strengths and prepares me for MCAT content. If you naturally excel at anatomy/physiology, then Kine is great for that.",

At this point in time, you should start looking at the academic calendar for your program to determine what courses you\u2019ll be enrolling yourself in. What first year major courses do you need? What courses fulfil your Gen Ed requirements, and which Gen Ed\u2019s are interesting to you? Which sessions for the courses fit into your ideal schedule?",

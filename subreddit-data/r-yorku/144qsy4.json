Just sneak em in through the back entrance (open it from the inside after 7pm cause they keycard reader shuts down) and take the back elevator and no one will know. \n\nFor a few days? No way. Eventually someone\u2019s gonna notice. If the dons or porters see someone they don\u2019t recognize they will ask them if they live there and double check their system. \n\nSource: I used to live there.\n\nEdit: for what it\u2019s worth, you\u2019re allowed to have a guest sleep over for 3 consecutive days a month while in Res. If you sign them in, they\u2019ll just let you and you won\u2019t need to sneak them in unless you\u2019ve had your privileges revoked for some reason.",

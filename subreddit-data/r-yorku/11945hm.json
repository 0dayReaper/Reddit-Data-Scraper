    "postText": "I\u2019ve noticed something very unsettling in the GTA especially for those renting out rooms. I find it to be a racism act specifically INDIANS when they put up their places for rent. They will consciously say \u201cONLY INDIAN GIRL/BOY\u201d. I\u2019ve never seen anyone say ONLY white/Syrian/ black etc. Imagine if Canada as a country would say NO INDIANS ARE ALLOWED INTO THIS COUNTRY. \n\nPerhaps it\u2019s culture difference but that should NEVER be an excuse. You\u2019re not the only ones with cultures to preserve or whatever the lame excuse there may be for such disgusting behaviour. WTF.",

There are 2 types of people that immigrate from india\n\n1. need based, shit is so bad that the only thing you can do is get out\n2. class based - you're already educated and are likely moving because your company wants you to or you ended up getting promoted to a role that isnt based in india.\n\ngroup 2 has privilege (and salaries that are insane) and often this group comes in, buys a home and has their family in there. They are often, well adjusted and assimilate into the culture easily (folks working for specific consulting firms, banks, construction companies etc). They dont care about their citizenship. They go where work takes them. Some people decide to stay. Some people end up moving somewhere else if the job demands it.\n\nGroup 1 is the one that moves here specifically to immigrate. The route is usually through schooling.  If you're somewhat okay with $ you go to uni. If not, and mommy and daddy took a loan or sold land to send you here, you end up at a school mill. You're in a very compromised situation because you cant legally work (though some do), and you cant afford shit here. So you end up cutting expenses with rental costs. You live in a shack and let all the BS go because you're terrified of doing something wrong and ending up on the street/or worse back home. Its not about school, its not about education, its about getting a PR card (while bitching about canada every day) then staying here (while still bitching some more) and then getting your whole family to move here (while bitching) but still stay here because its better than home. You have a 4 story house, 4 cars and the possibility that your kids will end up in coveted 'dr' roles. Which...does happen for quite a few people.",

You can climb up - but at most you'll make it to lower middle class. However, Lower middle class is very hard in canada. Its easier in india to make less and still have a life that gives you access to resources that you dont have access to here.\n\nMost people, however, are far too obsessed with image to understand that. They dont want to be here (thats why they complain so much), but they dont want to leave either because 'what will people say.'\n\nits sad",

            "comment": "You are welcome to report the issue to the  Rental Housing Enforcement Unit of the Ministry of Housing, but it is likely nothing of substance will be done. The fact of the matter is, landlords routinely screen out tenants for illegal reasons. There are literally far too many shitty landlords for the Ministry, Landlord and Tenant Board, and Human Rights Tribunal to handle, and their focus is on more pertinent issues like illegal lock-outs, ongoing harassment/endangerment/neglect of active tenants, and/or attempts at illegal evictions. \n\nIf you apply for a rental, and you can get in writing explicitly your refusal is for the reason of your racial/ethnic identity, that is a different story, and the Ministry/Human Rights Tribunal may be more inclined to help you. It is generally very easy though for a Landlord to just refuse on alternative grounds (e.g., \"I found another tenant before you reached out\"), even if they are looking for someone of a particular race/ethnicity.\n\nFor more information:\n\n[https://stepstojustice.ca/steps/housing-law/3-call-investigation-and-enforcement-unit/](https://stepstojustice.ca/steps/housing-law/3-call-investigation-and-enforcement-unit/)\n\n[https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/human-rights-and-rental-housing-ontario-background-paper/types-rental-housing-discrimination](https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/human-rights-and-rental-housing-ontario-background-paper/types-rental-housing-discrimination)",

In our very own building, there's a 2 bedroom condo housing 7 Gujrati students. Their background isn't important. Between them there's one bathroom. So, what they do is take turns to go to the showers and sauna in our shared condo pool. Imagine taking ur kids to the pool and there a line up for the showers as their is in a public pool lol.\nAnyway, the reason this angers me is because there really is no recourse because even if this landlord removed the indians only sign/ad, they will simply disguise the refusal, which is par for the course with asshole landlords in general.",

They don't know the local laws and tend to be naive. You can take advantage of them in a multitude of a ways whether it be not keeping up with basic maintenance, illegal rent increases, maximum occupancy, etc. \n\nIf we cared about this as a society, we'd enact heavy fines on this behavior, but many people at the top benefit from our housing crisis in many ways which this absolutely adds to.\n\n I'd love to see a fine draconianly enforced measured in relation to the asking rent for the year with a minimum threshold. E.g. a landlord posts a \"Indian students only - $500 per month\", boom in the mail there is a fine for $6,000 payable. If not paid, a lien gets placed on the property. If paid, the once you subtract administrative costs incurred for dolling out the fine, the money goes into a pool to be spent on affordable housing initiatives. But again, that just helps society, not the people in power who make these decisions, so dont expect any change here.",

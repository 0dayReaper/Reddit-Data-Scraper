    "postText": "Hi there, I keep emailing and calling but York of course does not answer. I'm currently enrolled in an english major, and want to declare my minor as music in my second year. I have my specialized instrument lessons as one of my classes for my first year (the one that charges $1600.)\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) Do i need these private lessons if I want a minor in music?\n\n2) If I do, I need to connect with the conductor and join an ensemble. How would I do this?\n\nThank you so much, I need to plan or else I will forget.",

            "comment": "Honestly, if I were to give myself an advice on my first year, or for my undergrad in general, it\u2019s to not take more than 4 classes per semester. Especially for your first year, I would only take the 18-credits of general education and 6 units of intro to Psych. \n\nYou will thank yourself during your midterms and finals week for not shooting yourself in the foot having to worry about papers and tests happening all in the same short period. Your Humanities and SoSC will be very heavy on essay papers while your NATS are test heavy. For Psych you\u2019d probably have to read 4-5 chapters (depending on the prof) each test.\n\nYour gpa will thank you for it as well as your mental health. You\u2019ll have more time to study and have spare time to socialize and do whatever you like. Consider taking a course or two during the summer term if you intend to finish in 4 years but tbh if you would want to pursue grad studies, having a better gpa will matter more than you finishing your undergrad in 4 with a shot gpa.\n\nFor your schedule, try no to stack 2 courses right after another as you will have almost 4 hours of lecture and that\u2019s a lot for your brain to absorb. If you can have breaks between classes, that\u2019s the best way to go about your schedule.",

I\u2019ll remove psych 2020 from the schedule.\n\nWould you mind expanding more on the \u201cif you wanna pursue grad, having a better gpa maters more than completing undergrad in 4 years\u201d i def think I\u2019ll go into grad cause it\u2019ll help in the job prospect\n\nMaybe doing courses in the summer would help with my overall workload for the rest of undergrad\n\nI really appreciate your advice, thank you sm :)",

    "postText": "I saw somewhere that students get discount for the movies so I decided to check if York has something like that because ryerson and UofT has it but York doesn\u2019t. I looked over all of the things that the two schools offer their students then I realized that the student union really gives us nothing lol. I never thought of it until now but wow it\u2019s disappointing\u2026",

(Cc:  /u/Medical_Maintenance6.)  To buy the tickets, you go to the YFS member services office.  I'm not sure what their summer hours are; maybe check on the office door for a sign.\n\nThe YFS also does a bunch of advocacy for students.  A lot of it is done behind the scenes.\n\nP.S.  I've never worked for YFS.  I'm just a student.",

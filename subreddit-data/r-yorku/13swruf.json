If your goal is to become a social worker, then I highly recommend this program as I\u2019ve found that it has prepared me well. The instructors, courses, and information is delivered by competent profs with years of clinical, public sector, and private sector experience. In order to graduate, it\u2019s mandatory that you successfully complete a 700 hour placement in your 4th year that will give you hands on experience which helps with building networks and potentially landing you employment right after you graduate. Also, a lot of the BSW profs at York also teach the master\u2019s program so it\u2019s good to have that familiarity if you\u2019re looking to go to grad school.",

As you\u2019re a year 1 student, the core social work courses will automatically be selected for you by the admissions office. You get more freedom in regards to the electives that you want to take and you can build your schedule that\u2019ll suit you the best. As for advice, I\u2019d say to be friendly and actively try to make friends within your cohort, as you will likely see them as you get further into the program. There is a lot of group work and group assignments in this program so it\u2019s best to have a solid group of people who you know you can work well with. It really makes the difference between getting an easy A and barely scrapping by with a C! \n\nAlso, try to make sure that the professor knows you by name, or at least by face! Most of them teach at the master\u2019s level as well and you will need at least three academic references to even be considered should you decide on pursuing grad school. Attend your classes, pay attention, and ask questions; they really appreciate that. Majority of the profs are really lenient with extensions and are generous giving them out as long as you request one in advance, don\u2019t wait last minute! If there are any other questions of concerns that you may have, you can reach out directly to the School of Social Work for all inquiries. I wish you well and the best of luck in your journey!",

    "postText": "Today's the day I've waited for the past four years. The last submission of my exam in my undergrad education. I have finished university. It feels strange to end off university virtually, weird there's no proper closure. Before the pandemic, I have enjoyed my time at York. The different types of people I encountered, the places I would go to study, and tait, for those nice workouts and occasional sports play. I'll miss the late night study sessions when the campus when quiet, especially in the summer. It felt peaceful. I'll miss studying in the courtyard of Vanier College when I wanted to be in peace, surrounded by nature. I'll miss hanging out on the 5th floor of Scott Library when I was killing time in between those 2 hour gaps. Countless memories will forever be remembered.\n\nTo those who started York in September 2017 and will be graduating this spring or even the fall. Wow. We are an unlucky cohort. I like to joke we are a cursed cohort. Year 1: The Legendary York U Strike. Year 2: The only normal year. Year 3: Pandemic. Year 4: Still a pandemic. Despite these challenges, we made it. I'm proud for all of us. It will feel great to get that degree in June. \n\nI will miss you York U. I look forward to future visits as alumni. Thank you for a great time - even if you York'd me many times from day 1. I'll still be here in the sub past graduation, after all everyone needs help and advice! \n\nP.S. When York returns to in-person classes, I will drop the list of quiet and clean washrooms on campus. Stay tuned and good luck everyone.",

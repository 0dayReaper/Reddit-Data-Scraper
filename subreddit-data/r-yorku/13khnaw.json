    "postText": "hello!\n\nI am an assistant professor at York University conducting a research study about student gig workers. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the work/life balance of student gig workers, that is, those who work for food and grocery delivery apps like Uber, UberEats, Lyft, DoorDash, and other similar platforms, especially as it relates to their studies and leisure activities.\n\nThe survey consists of short answer and multiple-choice questions and should take no longer than 20-25 minutes to complete. The survey is open to anyone over the age of 18, who currently does or has previously done gig work as a student at a post-secondary educational institution.\n\nAll data collected will be held in the strictest confidence and only the research team will have access to the survey and interview data, as well as your personal information. Anonymity will be maintained in any final reports and publications arising from this research. Your data will be safely stored in a password protected file folder on the researcher\u2019s password protected York-issued laptop and an external hard drive, and only research staff/research team members will have access to this information. Further details on how we will collect and process data are provided in the consent document.\n\nIf you have questions or would like to know more about the survey before you decide to participate, you can email the research team at [sneakyleisure@gmail.com](mailto:sneakyleisure@gmail.com).\n\nThe informed consent document and the survey can be accessed at [https://yorkliberalarts.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_08IRZ1Y3337kLZk](https://yorkliberalarts.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_08IRZ1Y3337kLZk).\n\nThank you for your consideration,Dr. singh.",

She's very good at explaining the concepts in an easy-to-understand manner. I also took cognition in the winter term that just passed. I took it with Dr. Liya Ma. Dr. Ma was a very good professor. The content can get very technical as there are a lot of things to remember but her tests were not very hard. She cares about student success. I've taken biological basis of behaviour with Professor DeSouza. I took it in the winter term. He was a horrible professor and does not teach. I had to teach myself everything by reading the textbook. I was still able to get an A in that course though so do not fear completely if you still want to take that course because you like the content. The content in that course is very interesting so if you're interested in neuroscience then you'll like it. \ud83d\ude42 I haven't taken personality but I heard that Maxwell Barranti is a good professor for personality. And the other courses that you have there are ones that I haven't taken. I hope this helps! \u263a\ufe0f\n\nEdit: actually I forgot to mention research methods:\nI took that course with Professor Jorida Cila. She was alright. The course was pretty boring and imo she made the tests harder than they should have been. I was able to get an A in the course though. I heard from people that Professor Raymond Mar is very strict as he assigns assignments every week and I've heard that his tests are quite hard and that his class average was quite low so I'd avoid him if you can or unless you're fine with weekly assignments.",

The profs are not out for stats 2 this year so i\u2019m not sure if i can take it with her. I\u2019m nervous abt bio basis of behaviour i enjoy neuroscience stuff but at the same time memorizing stuff is not my strongest suit and obv this course is gonna involve a lot of that. I checked the profs and Joseph DeSouza teaches 3 sections and there\u2019s one other section with another prof but it didn\u2019t say who. \nDid you take cognition online?",

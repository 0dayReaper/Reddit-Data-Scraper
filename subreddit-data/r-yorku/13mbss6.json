I'm going into possibly 4th year now. I keep feeling like eventually I'll fail engineering and be a drop out. I just don't know how I am getting by.",

This makes it easy to stay motivated since you know it's going to be useful to you.\n- Many courses are natural extensions of third year material, so it's not so much \"new stuff\".\n- Capstone is fun, but get a good group well in advance. Start now by getting in touch with friends.\n- You know you're almost done so it's the home stretch.\n\nSo just keep it up, you'll eventually get there. You know who's actually not fit to be in engineering? The people in your major that you haven't seen at all since first year, because they're either *still* in first year retaking the \"for dummies\" courses or they've just given up. The fact that you've progressed this far shows that you can make it. ~35% can't, so it's an accomplishment even to just get here!",

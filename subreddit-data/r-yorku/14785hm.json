    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nSo I'm considering how much I would spend as a first-year student at york for BEng, undeclared Engineering. Since idk how many courses/ credits per year or per semester I would have, I can't really get an exact total on the tuition fees. Plus, there are book fees and residence fees etc etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would appreciate it if you could maybe give me a list of costs that I can expect to spend for the first year.",

            "comment": "I believe engineering is the most expensive program. About $1,250 per 3 credit course and you will take 10 courses each year if you are full time. about $12,500 for the whole year, perhaps you should plan for it possibly being a bit higher.\n\nTextbooks can be between $60-$250 per course. You can find PDF copies online for most of them, saves you a lot of money.\n\nI believe residence was something like $1,000 / month last time I heard. I haven't ever lived on res, but I think it is still around that price.",

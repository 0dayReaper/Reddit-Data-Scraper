You need to tell institutions to STOP FUCKING HIRING SESSIONAL INSTRUCTORS. \n\nTheodorescu is contract faculty. For those of you who don't know, he was never eligible for tenure and his employment was already precarious, despite his extensive training in mathematics. He likely doesn't want to teach, but universities exploit people for cheap teaching capacity. Why hire a full-blown, well-qualified, expensive tenure-line professor to teach, when you can just hire someone desperate for cheap? Institutions need to invest in people who have discipline-specific knowledge and a vested interest in undergraduate pedagogy for this problem to start to go away.",

This whole ordeal points to a much larger issue than just Theodorescu, and is the result of structural problems within higher education. Contingent faculty are exploited regularly in this fashion at the majority of North American institutions. This results in poor teaching at the post-secondary level. What is the incentive for pedagogical excellence, when you are treated like shit? This is a shared problem between both students (teaching) and faculty (employer exploitation). I am merely attempting to point this out, as students are often unware of what happens behind the scenes at the institutional level, and the underlying factors that drive these sorts of issues.",

Sometimes adjunct instructors will be offered a class last-minute (like the weekend before a term starts, even!) based on staffing and enrollment fluctuations. Many are not eligible for benefits based on their credit loads. Many work at multiple institutions to (try to) make ends meet. Every few months they are back on their toes trying to cobble something together again. The fortunate ones may be offered multi-term contracts.\n\nEveryone suffers under this system (except, perhaps, the college or university\u2019s budget).\n\nThis flawed and inhumane system is in crisis, in my opinion. It doesn\u2019t excuse or even explain the cruel comments directed toward a student by this York professor. He is not protected by tenure, though he may have some kind of union representation. He is, of course, ultimately responsible for his actions. \n\nMaybe the university will take some notice following this negative PR experience - and the harm done to the student - and consider its hiring and professional development practices for faculty.",

    "postText": "How on earth was this guy made a prof. I don't understand a single sentence he has said, and he mumbles half of the words. There are like 7 people in the class and he hasn't made eye contact with anyone, all he is doing staring at the screen mumbling. Even a toddler can probably speak and teach better than this guy.",

I previously worked at a TD call center, and they would hire people straight from foreign countries with super strong accents that made them hard to understand on the phone. While I have no issue with this in most fields, the amount of customers who I spoke to who told me \"thank god, someone I can understand\" was very telling.\n\nIts the same for any massive, monopolized business that suffers no loss financially when the quality of the service drops.",

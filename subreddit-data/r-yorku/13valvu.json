Most programs at Glendon have French as sort of a background requirement where you'd take some beginner classes in French, with most program Specific courses being in English unless French Studies is your program, in your case though it seems like it jumps right into immersion courses where they're not about learning French and are moreso courses offered in French. \n\nhttps://www.yorku.ca/glendon/businessinternational/program-details/\n\nYour first year will be a full courseload of 30 credits. Adding beginner French classes would be a lot. \n\nGlendon does offer both FSL level and FRAN level French courses, you would take a skills test and be placed accordingly. Maybe reach out to Academic Services, your department, or the French Studies department for help.",

What is your French level exactly? \n\nIt says to be accepted to the program you should have completed a written portion, submitted a video in French, and have been in French at the 4th year level in highschool (if you were coming out of highschool). I assume that means you took French for all 4 years?\n\nIf you can at least understand French fluently (reading and listening), I assume most writing will probably be outside of class (papers etc) so you could have time to check things and reference translation services like Deepl or Linguee (this is permitted) if you have a Core level French knowledge, aside from for in class tests.\n\nOtherwise maybe you can check with Academic Services and your Department to see if you're able to adjust your courseload. Do an extra year, and take some basic French courses, and Gen Ed classes (if you have those as a requirement, most programs do) year one or any of your English program specific courses that don't require the French as pre-requisites.\n\nAlternatively, maybe see if your community offers French learning over the summer. There might be opportunities outside of Glendon to practice your French before the fall.\n\nI'm not in the same program as you so I'd definitely say don't do anything without contacting your Department and Academic Services. Also don't rely on Academic Services alone, sometimes they miss things.",

There's a lot of grammar stuff and vocab you won't know, and these courses are taught like you already know French well. Did you select Glendon for the small campus feel? Or for the French? If not maybe you could look at Keele campus, see they have a comparable degree without the bilingualism. If you want Glendon though, I'd say expect an extra year so you can take French classes (although that's up to you). \n\nUnderstanding French well is probably what matters most for you since that'll be what matters in lectures, written French skills don't need to be perfect but should be decent because a portion grades on language quality in written work. You'll also want to be able to speak enough to ask questions in class and answer them.\n\nIf you want to practice listening skills in French there are a few French podcasts such as \"French for Beginners\" (mostly in English, but goes into basic French vocab) or \"Advanced French\" (Shares News in French for French learning) on Spotify. Watching tv in French with subtitles in French or English would be good as well.\n\nHonestly YouTube is a great resource, as well as online practice quizzes. It would be good to know many tenses/moods: Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9, Pr\u00e9sent, Futur Simple, Futur Proche, Futur Ant\u00e9rieur, Conditionnel, L'imparfait, Subjonctif, etc.\n\nConcepts like: Le voix passive vs le voix actif, la cause et la cons\u00e9quence, la mise en apposition, les reprises nominales et pronominales, les pronoms relatifs et d\u00e9monstratifs, la nominalization, le particip\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent vs. le gerund, le comparatif et le superlatif, les pr\u00e9positions (de, \u00e0, du, au etc.), La concession et l'opposition, l'hypoth\u00e8se. (Those were from a list of what I covered in my second year French Studies course (FRAN level not FSL). You'll want to be sure you learn the lequel, lesquelles, duquel, laquelle stuff well it's covered in like every French language course at the university level. (Not courses in French, specifically French language learning classes to clarify).\n\nThe type of vocab my French learning classes focused on was about La production culturelle for film and books (things like director, subtitles, character, film festival etc.). My earlier classes covered like Travel words, and House vocab (like laundry room, roommates, Dishwasher etc.)\n\nTechnically just to understand and write in French you don't need to know everything I listed, but going over some of it might be helpful. On campus you'll have resources you can access like the Salon Francophone. It's a room where everyone speaks in French to practice. I believe they have a monitor who helps during the day sometimes. If you're living in residence, meetings and events are held Bilingually so you'll have a bit of French exposure in a less formal way. First year courses will recognize that you're new to University life and that not everyone is coming in with the same knowledge.",

Yes so anything starting in 1 means it's a first year level. 2, 3, 4 match those years accordingly. It's likely you'll end up with some courses at a higher # than your year at some point though and that's okay. However, that course code probably references it being beginner level content wise rather than language wise since this isn't a French language learning course. The numbers after that aren't always in order but I'm the case of part one and part two courses they sometimes are almost the same code with a small edit.\n\nMy main concern for you is whether you can understand a prof speaking in French and understand the vocab relevant to the course content, and then whether you can formulate questions and responses verbally. Written is not as concerning because you'd only need to worry about it when it's in-person like a test, otherwise out of class you can get help from translation services to correct your work. \n\nHopefully it'll work out for you.",

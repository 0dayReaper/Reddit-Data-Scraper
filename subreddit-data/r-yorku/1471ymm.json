Thanks for the reply.\n\nI am an international student who will be joining York in Aug 2023 so I don't know a lot of people there (yet). \n\nJust to clarify, I don't have an extra ticket, but I'm looking for some company to make the experience more enjoyable. It's always great to connect with like-minded people who share an interest in Andrew Huberman's work. \n\nIf you're interested in joining, let me know!",

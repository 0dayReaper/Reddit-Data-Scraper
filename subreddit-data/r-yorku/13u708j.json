You know your situation the best but you definitely needa look for 1) quality of education 2) social life balance (engineering can be decent here because of the Bergeron building which is a social building for engineers) 3)distance to the school or accommodation. I know york eng is relatively easier than uoft fs (idk about tmu), like we would do more basic review and take longer on certain topics that uoft wouldn\u2019t even look at. I hate school and I\u2019m managing passing everything at york so it\u2019s doable here",

There's a lot of focus placed on soft skills though, arguably more than at other schools. Although that's annoying to most people, me included, it's actually good since engineering is a very social field where soft skills are essential.\n\nFor **Co-op**, the Lassonde co-op program is pretty good. There are a few companies that have been convinced to put priority on interns from York due to past experiences. It's very easy to get into and pretty easy to find a job in if you do a couple hackathons/engineering events/personal projects/large class projects in your first couple years to spice up your resume.",

Moreover, it's very specialized and the technologies used are often years behind the leading edge due to the intensive requirements. However, because it's small and not so tied to defence, it's much easier to get a job from a security standpoint, and you don't even need to be a Canadian citizen for many of them.\n\nIn contrast, the American space industry is much larger and more competitive, and features private space companies not solely reliant on government largesse. Therefore, all of salaries, career options, and specializations are much greater in the US. However, because the space industry is often closely intertwined with the massive US defence industry, it's very difficult to get a job there without already holding US citizenship or at least a green card because of the security implications. You cannot just \"get\" a US citizenship by snapping your fingers. You must either have a pre-existing strong connection to the US like being born there or being born to an American parent (with certain conditions) which *entitles* you to be a US citizen; or you naturalize like everyone else - but that's going to take years and you will have to jump through some hoops to do it, and of course you need to immigrate there in the first place. I think it would be easier to immigrate if you have a close relative who could sponsor you, but I am not familiar with US immigration law to that extent.\n\nThe space industry no matter where you are has some pretty big issues with it like lack of competitiveness and overreliance on government contracts, but most of them are worse in Canada.",

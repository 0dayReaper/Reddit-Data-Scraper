The change makes the name consistent with EECS 3101, which is a follow up course on Data structures and algorithms and besides too many people enrolled in 2011 before 2030 because 2011&lt;2030 numerically. Since 2030 is a prereq of 2011, this resulted in drops and ensuing confusion.",

I have a side question.\n\nIf we have summer courses planned, but our EECS GPA drops below the requirement, will we be removed from the summer courses? I know this is the usual in Fall/Winter. But what about summer? I know with Lassonde Honours they will wait until fall to check GPA requirements. Does the same hold true for EECS?",

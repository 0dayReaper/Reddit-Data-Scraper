    "postText": "Hello professor,\n\nIma student of yorku in lassonde. My question is like I completed my EECS 1022 course in fall 2020 with D+ grade. But I had it again just to improve my grades in winter 2023 but unfortunately my grade was lower than that. I didn\u2019t know that latest grade will count towards GPA . So I want to request the department to please consider my first grade as I\u2019m about to graduate and moreover as I\u2019m international student my visa is about to expire soon. So it would be really helpful if you can guide me on this matter do I can make a petition accordingly. I hope you try to understand my situation. I\u2019m looking forward to hear back from you soon.\n\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nYorku",

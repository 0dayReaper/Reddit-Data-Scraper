    "postText": "Hello,\n\nDoes anyone have 2 extra tickets to convocation? My ceremony is #6, June 30 2023, 10:30AM. If you have an 2 extra ticket2 and are willing to give it away, I would be very grateful.\n\nIf you're not going to use them, why not give them away? Not looking to purchase (please don\u2019t send me DMs trying to sell them), instead someone whose willing to give them away. It\u2019s a familial moment and I don\u2019t want part of my family to miss my graduation.",

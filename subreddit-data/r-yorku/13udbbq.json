Taking part in OWeek is a requirement to receive your entire honorarium at the end of fall term if you are in a paid position. The general rule is that elected positions are paid, non-elected positions aren\u2019t, with a few exceptions (e.g., O-Chair, Webmaster). Highest paid is President, then the VPs, followed by \u201crepresentative\u201d positions like Commuter Rep/YFS Rep/Senior+Alum rep, etc.",

Tell me why there\u2019s a certain number that need to be 4000 or 3000 to graduate which means I gotta take prerequisites for outside of major courses that I don\u2019t give two fucks about just to graduate.",

            "comment": "Not sure about your program specifically, but most programs shouldn't have an issue with this. You are required to take specific courses in your major at the 3000 and 4000 levels and by doing so, you should be satisfying the stipulation that you are struggling to fulfil right now. I'll use mine as an example:\n\nThere is a list of specific courses I absolutely **must** take in my major, including\n\n* 6 courses at 4000 level (18 credits)\n* 11  courses at 3000 level (33 credits)\n\n  \nOther stipulations include: \n\n* at least 18 credits earned in first declared subject (major) courses must at the 4000 level.\n* At least 18 credits earned must be in courses at the 4000 level.\n* At least 36 credits earned must be in courses at the 3000 level or above. These can be credits outside the major, or credits taken to satisfy major or minor requirements.\n\nIf the stipulation you are talking about is like #2 or #3 that I listed above, then you do not have to take the course as an elective outside of your major. You can enrol in any 3000 or 4000 level course in your major that you weren't required to complete. For example, my degree progress reports shows 15 courses in my major at the 3000 and 4000 level that I am not required to take, but can take if I want to. You should have a similar part that you can refer to. \n\nI would tell you to go speak to a student advisor, but enough of them are shit that you shouldn't waste your time. If you would like, message me and I will help you figure it out!!",

This is without mentioning how the front desk was super pushy in trying to dismiss my issues and get me to find help elsewhere like bro what are u getting paid to do?? The biggest issue with them is that they standardize all problems students face and it is never a personal solution that might help more. FYI this was the guidance office at Calumet, facing Stong",

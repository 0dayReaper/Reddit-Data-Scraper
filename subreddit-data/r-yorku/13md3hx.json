    "postText": "Hey, has anyone with UHIP had ADHD assessment done via physician referral? I saw a doctor and asked to be referred to a mental health specialist for ADHD assessment and depression diagnosis. They made me get my blood work done which was covered by UHIP, but If I do get a referral for ADHD assessment &amp; depression diagnosis, will UHIP cover the expenses? Because as far as I know, ADHD assessments are quite pricey (to the tune of 2000/3000 dollars). I have been all over the UHIP website, but I couldn\u2019t find any specific info on if UHIP covers mental health specialists.",

            "comment": "That depends, who is your doctor referring you to? Generally, UHIP covers almost the same things as OHIP, which should include a psychiatry referral. You should discuss this with your referring doctor so that they can keep this in mind when determining where to refer you.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning on later applying for PR, ensure you keep careful records of this. While it shouldn\u2019t be much of an issue, any long term condition will have to be told to your panel physician for your PR medical",

The physician said it\u2019d be a mental health specialist when I specifically mentioned ADHD assessment. I had to get blood work done to rule out any deficiencies as the cause of depression. I am waiting to hear from them.",

You shouldn't have to pay anything in that sense, UHIP will cover it. If you decide to get on medication, UHIP will cover 80% of it if you get it from shoppers drug mart but just watch out because they can only cover up to 1000 dollars a year on prescription medication. It's a lengthy process getting diagnosed but I hope it works out for you :)",

            "comment": "ADHD is not real. It was invented around a cluster of symptoms to push meds onto kids. The inventor admitted it on his deathbed. Everyone can have ADHD now because of short attention spans being trained on phone/internet/social media. If you get a diagnosis, don\u2019t live your life by it. Hope things work out for you. Maybe you need accommodations for school. It can help a lot. Just remember mental health is an industry and 99/100 psychiatrists are not going to give a damn about your actual well-being, they are just there to dope people up and put a bandage on, because our greedy society doesn\u2019t want to fix the actual issues because it\u2019s not profitable. Best of luck. If you\u2019re feeling unwell, try spending more time in nature or doing things that are healthy and good for you that you enjoy!",

(Just in case you're also confused on that one, OCD is also much more complex than \"wanting things organized\"). Go enjoy your nature and be thankful that you don't suffer from any untreated debilitating mental disorders.",

This would expose you to networking opportunities, guidance and more knowledge about the life sciences sector.\n\nI figured Reddit would be a good place to promote this as I know there are post secondary students on here. The application process is pretty easy/straightforward.\n\nHere\u2019s the link so you could apply or view the eligibility criteria: [www.lifesciencesontario.ca/scholarship](http://www.lifesciencesontario.ca/scholarship)",

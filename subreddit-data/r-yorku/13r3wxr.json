    "postText": "I applied for graduate this June, but my graduation status is still shows: decision pending, grades in review. I have a dishonesty case in 2020, they just solved last week. I ask the department, they said submitted my grade to Registar last week. But the PDG still shows on my grade report. They said they reached RO to remind them to update my grade. But still now, nothing changed. So I want to go campus tomorrow and solved this problem. Because my study permit is gonna expire in July. Anyone know who I should contact with and where the office at?\nAny information will be help. Thanks",

    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI want to apply for the Technology Internship Program but I am having some problems. \n\n1.\n\nFirst of all, I am not sure if starting TIP would mean that I will not be studying for that term or not. Would I be enrolled in classes as well as the internship?\n\nOne of the requirements to apply for the program is to be enrolled full time (9 credits), and have 9 credits remaining to go back to. Unfortunately, I am taking 2 courses this summer(6 credits) and I have 12 more credits left to graduate, meaning I have 12 credits left, but I imagine if I apply right now, I would need 9 credits enrolled in Fall, and 9 more in Winter?\n\nIf I am understanding correctly, I cannot apply right now since I only an taking 6 credits, but if I wait for the next semester, I would not have any credits left and that would also mean I do not meet the requirements. \n\n2.\n\nI also see that I need a major GPA of 5.5 to apply, and I have taken more IT courses than I need in my major section. So I was thinking that I could switch one of the IT courses I have taken extra (with a lower grade than the rest), with a free choice course, so that the bad grade would not be included in my major GPA. The only way that I would be eligible is to separate that course and count it outside my major, would that be okay? How do they distinguish between these extra courses?\n\nI would really appreciate it if someone could answer these two questions, I have an academic advising booked for Monday, but I am getting nervous and wanted to see if anybody here knows how this process goes.\n\nThank you",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm currently looking into the options of colleges (Im thinking Seneca), and then transferring to a university as I've heard it's cheaper (not sure if its true) and since I've been out of school for a few years, a little bit easier to transition back into academics.\n\nI was just wondering if anyone here has had experience transferring from a College to York, how was the process? And is the amount of time spent at college equivalent to university? Say 3 year diploma, and I would have 1 year left when I transfer?\n\nCould I transfer before the 3 years? or is it recommended to finish the program at the college and THEN transfer?\n\nEDIT: Also, would choosing any \"University Transfer\" program be more beneficial than say a \"Accounting and Finance\" program if the end goal is to transfer regardless?\n\nI'd appreciate any input!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

I received 24 transfer credits (four 6 credits or eight 3 credits), which covered almost all of my general education requirements. \n\nYou still need to cover the remaining 96 credits for a 4 year degree, so that covers half a year. You still need to take your major/minor courses as transfer credits won't cover those.\n\nIf you're doing a 3 year college program, I'm not sure if they would give you more than 24 transfer credits.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the the transfer process feel free to PM me",

The course material is a lot and they go through it quick but i found it quite fun to learn (might just be me idk).\n\nThe materials cover all aspects of colour, the history, chemistry, physiology, physics (with hints of astronomy), art and so on. \n\nIt\u2019s asynch so it might feel a bit difficult to stay on top of assignments and deadlines but that\u2019s on the student really. If you do all the work on time and of decent quality, it\u2019s an A!",

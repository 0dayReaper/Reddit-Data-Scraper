    "postText": "I applied for residence and I got placed into Atkinson Suites which I thought was graduate housing. I can't find any information about undergraduate housing in Atkinson at all. I know that Atkinson for graduates is basically apartments which would make them suite style residences, but in the offer I was given I had mine listed as a traditional style housing. \n\nI tried calling the number given but the number is dead.\n\nDoes anybody know anything about this?",

I got some quotes on two types of rooms (7.7k for shared washroom and 8.6k for private bathroom - both single bedrooms) but i got offered a \u201cBedsitter Double\u201d room type (whatever that means) and it said on the website that the graduate suites are unfurnished - is it the same for the traditional rooms or will those have beds and desks? I emailed them yesterday but i\u2019ve yet to hear back",

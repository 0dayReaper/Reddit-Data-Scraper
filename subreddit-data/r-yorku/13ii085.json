You need a &gt;3.8/4 (&gt;8.0/9) cGPA to be competitive for medical school - and for most schools this includes *all* years of study (in contrast to other grad schools which may only care about the last 1-2 years). If you can't even pass high school calculus redux and Java for total noobs, how do you think you'll be able to pass EECS 2101? You need to still progress in your current program before you get to third year, which is when you can start applying for med school!\n\nSo do you think adding more workload is going to exactly help you in this quest?\n\nIf you actually want to go to med school, you need to fundamentally rethink the way you approach school because what you're doing now isn't giving you nearly the right results. You're probably going to need to start again from scratch if you want to have a chance at an 8.0.\n\nAt least the saving grace for you is that most CS jobs only care if you passed, but you still need to pass, and ~1/3 of CS students just...don't. Then of course you need to grapple with the fact that if you aren't motivated to do well in CS, why do you want to go into it as a career?",

That's not great, but at least you can retake 1013 later to raise that. Unfortunately, the concepts from 1013 are pretty important for CS; you still need to pass 1014 too. Then you need to pass EECS 2101, MATH 2030, etc. and those use calculus too.\n\nYou need straight As basically to get into med school; this is something that *maybe* 10% of the class achieves. Oh, and beyond getting straight As, schools these days want you to have a whole gamut of extracurriculars and the like.\n\nI'm not going to say it's impossible, but set realistic goals for yourself, and you need to take this step by step.",

    "postText": "I already made a post on this topic on r/lsat but I wanted to reiterate my point here. Anyone studying the LSAT with an ounce of self respect should stay away from Monica Whyte/Able York. She is completely unethical, and a total waste of your precious time before the LSAT. I took her entire LSAT training course and I also was involved with her student organization \"Able York\". So I feel that I am properly qualified to speak on the subject.\n\nFirst, she is a condescending narcissist. She always says that she values students who can \"handle constructive criticism\", when in reality she wants someone who she can easily gaslight into attending her useless course for 8 months. It's not uncommon for her to verbally abuse you when you inevitably piss her off, and she will even call you out in the middle of class to embarrass you in front of your peers. It's happened to me, and I've seen it happen to other students. She also won't hesitate to call your phone late at night or early in the morning just to yell at you for 30 minutes. If you value your mental health this alone should deter you from her.\n\nAs for the classes themselves, they are a complete waste of time. Monica has a very roundabout and impractical teaching method, and as a result, a point which could have been made in 20 minutes takes an hour. As someone who has taken both her course as well as a much shorter course from 7sage, I can confirm that the extra time you spend with Monica's course is useless.\n\nA quick note on her club as well: it's less of a club, and more of Monica ranting to her students about how everyone is ableist and how she deserves to be treated better. If you actually care about learning about accessibility and disabled people, I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere.\n\nFuture law school students and those studying for the LSAT: Please do yourself a favour and avoid Monica Whyte. If you are looking for an LSAT training course that actually respects you and will get you better results, I would highly recommend 7Sage. It's fully online, and I can guarantee you will see an increase in your score. Personally, I saw an 11 point AFTER taking Monica's entire course. If you have any questions, please go see my other post on r/lsat or feel free to leave me a DM.",

She is so hypocritical, one the one hand she rants about ableism and vulnerable and on the other hand she takes advantage of her students by manipulating them into joining ableyork and after words she never stops going on about how students are not doing enough for ableyork. the organization is a complete distraction on studying for the lsat and she pushes you to contribute more hours in hopes of a recommendation letter. She tells able York volunteers to volunteer for 200 hours to get a letter of recommendation in reality she is unreliable and can cut you off in a second and disregard all your hard work over minor things.",

                    "comment": "adding my two cents to this comment cause I find it mildly inappropriate not to say anything about it. I understand why you would ask this question and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps you have never been in a position where you were vulnerable, under the tyranny of an individual who finds joy in watching their subordinate work tooth and nail for them, perhaps you have never been told that in order to be successful in your life pursuits that you need this authoritative figure in your life because without them you would be nothing. Perhaps you have never been verbally abused by a monster who manipulates you into thinking you're unworthy, WORTHLESS and incapable. or maybe you were never in a relationship with an authoritative figure where you were so anxious all the time because you didn't know if they'd cut you off and leave you out to dry, that all the hard work that you did for the person would be moot, all because you inevitably made the person upset. I feel like I'm going into rambles right now, but this is precisely the definition of \"Monica Whyte\" who affiliates herself with Able York at York University. It is so hard to understand why people don't leave abusive/toxic relationships until you're in one and you've been so blinded to the manipulation and gaslighting that occurred within that by the time you realize it, you're already in too deep. You're right, u/iplayhutdude, the OP stuck with her for 8 months. at least by the 9th month they realized that enough was enough and cut ties with Monica whyte. there are people that have worked with Monica Whyte for much longer than that and I feel like its cus they dont have friends/families encouraging them to leave monica. Instead of saying \"yet you stuck with her for 8 months\", you should commend the OP for leaving at the 9th. Abusive relationships are NOT ONLY boyfriend/girlfriend, girlfriend/girlfriend, boyfriend/boyfriend, but they are also so prevalent in student/mentor relationships too. Now I'd go so far as to say monica whyte wishes she was a 'mentor' cause she is not. She is a monster who is exploiting university students and their resources for her own advance, but for the sake of my post, I'd say this is a clear case of a student/mentor toxic relationship. OP, I commend you for leaving monica whyte after 8 months. Thank you for your post.",

Monica makes sure that people don't know she's running this business until they enrol in it she does it discreetly, she does not put her name on advertisements. personally when I took her course there was little information on her online so there was no warnings. I am glad people are speaking out about it now. There's also speculations that she changes her name and is lying about her credentials. A lot of people took her course because she called it \"accommodating\" and offered her services at a cheaper price than prep companies probably because they couldn't afford prep companies. When you're new in the course she behaves Nice with you and after awhile she is so rude and awful will single you out in front of everyone and embarrass you and she also yells at the whole class. Makes racist comment and inappropriate comments about religion when you are in private. This is simply no way to teach or be a mentor. So Don't go around calling people liars for speaking out on abuse the faced",

Here's some facts about Monica Whyte that you can verify for yourself. \n\nShe claims to be a lawyer who graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School. Despite this, she has no online presence aside from posts like these who criticize her, and her name/face is nowhere to be found in the Law Society of Ontario database, or in any Osgoode alumni photos. If she hasn't lied about her credentials, she would surely be found in both of these places.\n\nShe's also the \"leader\" of Able York, yet her name cannot be found on Able York's profile. You can find Able York's club profile on YUconnect (all clubs need to have one), but you won't see Monica's name anywhere on there. It'll either have the names of various students who Monica manipulates into joining, or it'll just be empty. Monica says that she's doing a PhD at York University, so why does she do this? She once called me (in the middle of the night btw) to renew her club for her, and even gave me the exact instructions on how to do it. If she knows how to renew her club, and she's already a student at York, why doesn't she just do it herself, or at least list her name?\n\nFinally, if you doubt my story/experience with Monica, why don't you check out all the posts of other people that had similar experiences? You speculated that I might have had some kind of personal relationship with Monica, perhaps as an ex-boyfriend or something like that (thank God this is not the case). Well, while I'm not sure how to disprove this, would you say the same for the countless others who have posted online about her in the past? Even in this post, there are several people who confirm they have had similar experiences.\n\nI can tell you're trying to play devil's advocate here, which is perfectly fine, but hopefully this is enough to convince you.",

She confidently tells people that she got a 170 the first time of taking the lsat and that she is doing a phd now. She calls these lsat workshops pro bono cases, even though she charges for them since they are a decent price she makes you feel like you owe her more and  she gets it from you by literally taking all your time and make you contribute it to her so called \"charity\" where she rants about disability but never seems to progress anywhere. The reason people join is because obviously it's disguised as a good cause I mean who wouldn't want to help disabled people and second because she promises if you contribute 200 hours into the organization she will give you a glowing letter of recommendation. However the charity is just her making you do random tasks over the week, something she calls transcription where she gets people to type out law school textbooks for her I am assuming because she is blind and 2-3 hours meetings of her ranting about disability and and word's you shouldn't use like \"crazy\" or \"it opened my eyes\" or \"person in a wheel chair\". Instead you have to use alternatives like \" that's wild\", \"person using a wheel chair and \"open my mind\" and she gets mad even if you slip up it makes no sense these are every day phrases we use and she.  She gets upset if you're time table doesn't match hers and says you should free your time because \" people with disability don't get to chose their own time they always have to follow other's schedule or something like that even though we are not doing any real help for disabled people just listening to her rant. It gets draining to listen to it because she calls a 2 hr meeting every week but goes way over time and then if you are an \"executive member she keeps you even longer. She forms a relationship with you by saying she's there for you and like offers you help in unconventional ways that you should never trust like she wants to meet up with you and stuff and at the end of the day she's a stranger you can't trust her. I think she has some serious mental health problems that she should seek help for because of how bipolar she is and lashes out and gets emotional randomly and I really hope she gets that help but her students deserved better.",

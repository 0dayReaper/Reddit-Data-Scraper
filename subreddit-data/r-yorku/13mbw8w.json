It is a pretty demanding course. you need to stay on top of every single week. Adms 1010 isn\u2019t hard it\u2019s just tedious because you have a reading of around 7 pages every week then there\u2019s a mini assignment on the reading. Econ 1010 is easier then Econ 1000. Personally and being completely transparent I felt that I didn\u2019t do week in adms2500 as I just took it this winter so I\u2019m re taking it that\u2019s how important of a course it is",

    "postText": "My nephew recently finished high school outside of Canada. He wishes to study at York. He was accepted into both the ITEC honours and the CS program. Nevertheless, he admitted that he doesn't really like the math, and only applied because of parental pressure. For context, my major is economics, so I have no idea about the difference between ITEC and CS. \n\nSo his question is: \"Is ITEC a dumb down CS degree, that's closer to a business degree? Also how much harder is CS compared to ITEC?\"\n\nObviously, he didn't really do his research when applying. How should I answer him?",

            "comment": "BCOM ITEC is more business focused while BA ITEC is more technology focused. ITEC has less math than computer science and is a smaller faculty.  I switched from CS to BA ITEC because i was struggling with the math requirements for CS. The computer/technology based courses are pretty similar to each other in both programs for the most part. I personally wouldnt say ITEC is a dumbed down version of CS.",

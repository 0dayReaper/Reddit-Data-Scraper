    "postText": "Hey guys\n\nI'm currently a 2nd year in Psychology but last year I was a first year In the Kinesiology and Health Sciences program. I really want to try and get back in so I've asked The academic office if there was a way and they said I would have to do a late withdrawal from the courses that I failed in order to bring my GPA up. I have the forms ready I just don't know where and how I have to give the forms. If anyone knows could yall help me please? I've worked too hard in grade 12 to get into Kin just to end up back out. Thank You.",

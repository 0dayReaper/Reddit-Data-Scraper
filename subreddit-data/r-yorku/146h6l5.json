You can look at which courses to enroll in on the York Courses website right now, but enrollment times haven't opened up yet (course enrollment begins on June 14, and is staggered among students to avoid overloading the system). And no, you don't have to pay your $300 deposit until *after* you've enrolled in courses.",

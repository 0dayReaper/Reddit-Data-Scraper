I currently have a 3.8 gpa and I\u2019m taking two 3 credit summer courses that I feel like I\u2019m going to do good in. If I do good in those two courses, is it possible for me to get the 4.0 and get taken off the academic warning?",

Make sure for future reference, you drop courses (if needed) before the drop date so that mark doesn't stay on your transcript as a F. Take courses that interests you. If you plan to do an Honours (a 4th year) your GPA has to be 5.0 I believe. Good luck with your studies this summer, don't stress, just be organized, stay on top of your work, talk to your prof or TA for any clarity on course work...You should be fine.",

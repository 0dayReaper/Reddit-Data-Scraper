    "postText": "Hello, how is this schedule for a first year dance student?? It's a full 30 credit course.\n\nAlso I since all of these courses are required, does this mean I don't have the option of choosing non major electives or electives outside my department? (I think 3 of these courses are listed in non major electives but I am supposed to take them to fulfill degree requirements so its not much of a choice lol)\n\n I really wanted to take a couple electives from the LAPS department as I wanna do a double major but haven't yet decided what in. \n\nI would really appreciate it if I got some insight, thank you!",

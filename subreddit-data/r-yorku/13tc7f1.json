My suggestion would be to take all your Gen Eds in first year for two reasons. 1) they provide you with good skills and 2) attendance in the tutorials are mandatory.  Such courses have both lectures and tutorials. \n\nIf you leave your Gen Eds until your 3rd or 4th year, they could detract from your concentration on the more difficult upper level course assignments and exams. Just my take.",

Make an appointment with her, it's her job to advise you on course selection and she will help you out.  You can have a virtual appointment iirc.  Would be really useful for straightening out your plans!!",

If you wanted to speed things up for some reason you could take summer courses but I don\u2019t like how PSYC courses are condensed in half of the summer because it\u2019s a lot of material to learn in half the time",

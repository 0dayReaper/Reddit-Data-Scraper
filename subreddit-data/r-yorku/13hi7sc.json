    "postText": "Hey guys, there is a good chance that that I will be having 2 exams at the same date and time and I have a few questions about what may happen if this is the case..\n\n1. Will I just be able to reschedule one of the two exams to a later date in the month/week or whatever time it may be \n2. Is it on me to reschedule one of the exams if this is the case or does the registrar do it themselves \n\nSorry if these questions aren\u2019t very clear it\u2019s just the first time I will be experiencing this and I\u2019m just confused on the situation and would like some clarification from someone who has experienced this situation before. Thank you in advance",

Midterms are usually during class time so the prof will be confused about what you\u2019re considering to be a conflict. Unfortunately it is possible to have 2 midterms on the same day",

If it\u2019s a midterm and it\u2019s outside the normally scheduled class time that\u2019s something you would need to talk to your prof about (although most classes they seem to cover that sort of thing in the course outline). \n\nIf it\u2019s a final - why do you think there will be a conflict? The schedule isn\u2019t out yet and it\u2019s really not predictable based on the class time or days. I\u2019ve had classes that were offered on completely different days and times have their finals at the same time (though I dropped one of them so it wasn\u2019t an issue for me). For final exam conflicts, cross that bridge when you come to it, you may never get there and worrying about it now does nothing but make you worry.",

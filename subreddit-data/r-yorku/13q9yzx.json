    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have a question about my career (software engineering).  \n\nYork University staff ask me to choose the \"major\" for my software course.  They give me 3 options, general stream, big data stream and security stream.  I was researching the difference between big data and security, but I don't know the meaning of the general stream or what it is about.  \n\n-Which option do you recommend I choose?  \n\n-Or can you give me an example of what kinds of jobs I can get?  \n-Or in which can I have a better opportunity to find a good job?  (I know this question depends on other factors)",

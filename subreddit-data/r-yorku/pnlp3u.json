    "postText": "I want to start off by saying I'm just really upset right now and I would really appreciate it if no one attacked me with a list of reasons why I'm an idiot for making this post and thinking this way. I don't deny that this school has issues. I don't want to invalidate anyone's poor experience with this school. The post below is about the general culture of hating this school that we as York students have convinced ourselves is necessary to worsen.\n\nYes there are many valid concerns and criticisms of York, but the amount of hate the entire university gets for every little thing is unbelievable. As a senior student who spent years hating and feeling ashamed about the school I went to, I am so sick and tired of the unnecessary amount of shit this school gets.\n\nThis whole York-is-the-worst-university-in-Ontario culture is beyond negative. Why are we convincing ourselves and incoming students that this university is a complete shithole? Why are we welcoming new students by telling them they made a huge mistake, that they're complete idiots for choosing York like us, that they can never compare to UofT or other universities, that they should switch schools, that if they stay their university experience is going to be nothing but garbage...?\n\nFirst year students in my elective course group chat are \\*already\\* hating York to an extent they likely wouldn't reach if this were any other Ontario university. They're wishing they went to UofT instead, as if they would necessarily have a better time there (no hate to UofT).\n\n(Disclaimer: this isn't always how the term \"York'd\" is used, but I do see it a lot). York does something other Ontario universities do, \"got York'd\". An issue at York that occurs in other Ontario universities as well, \"got York'd\". A York website has technical issues during very heavy site traffic, \"got York'd\". You tripped and fell on Keele campus, \"got York'd\".\n\nA lot of people say \"university is what you make it\" (or something along the lines of that). Okay, so if we're all going to regularly and harshly trash York's reputation, then I guess that's all our university experience is going to be. If you spend your years here convincing yourself that York is far worse than it actually is, that it's a shithole school, then you're going to have a shit university experience, and you're making it shit for all your peers too.\n\nThere are tons of amazing profs, TAs, programs, courses, opportunities, etc. at this school. But a lot of students here see those as outliers and redeeming qualities rather than legitimately great aspects of a great university.\n\nYour school does not need to be perfect for it to be worth it. Convincing yourself it's a bad school will ensure you spend your undergrad years hating your situation more than necessary, and will ensure that you'll always look back as a graduate with unnecessary shame. You're sending the message to all those high school graduates that they're right to be ashamed for choosing York, that their friends going to other schools were right for making them feel inferior, that if someone at another Ontario university insults York, they're right to do so.\n\nI should not have been convinced by everyone in my first three years here that I'm going to a crap university and that I could never compare to the Great Mighty Students of Other Universities. I should not have felt immense shame for going to York and I should not have been embarrassed to tell people which school I went to.\n\nI have no interest in continuing this hateful culture and I'm going to do the best I can to enjoy my remaining semesters at York. I might dislike aspects of my university experience but I don't hate York University and I'm happy to go here. I want to enjoy my time here and I want new students to feel good and proud about their high-quality education.\n\nPlease, please tell me there's at least someone else at York who feels this way.\n\nEdit: typos\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards &lt;3",

I really think the \"inferiority complex\" stems from the bottom segment of the class, who perhaps do not have other options and feel that everyone who attends here is in the same boat as them.\n\nThis is a mid-tier university with a well-educated faculty, and perhaps a below-mid-tier student body *on average* (because the school admits too many students, dragging down admissions standards).  Ironically, the large portion of the student body castigating the school is in my view the largest reason for the school's subpar reputation, not the faculty/staff. \n\nPut it this way, I don't see nearly as many Osgoode/Schulich/grad students, or those undergrads graduating near the top of the class and moving on to good things; slagging York nearly as much as the rest of us.\n\nDown-vote away.",

Students were expected to sink or swim, and by third year those who were struggling were usually dropping out or entering other programs. Mixed in with classes that were usually an hour long, as well as a school community that was both located in the heart of the city as well as was primarily commuter students, and there was a sense of maturity and self-discipline that emanated through the student body. \n\nWhen I entered York, I was surprised by how isolated the campus was from the community around it (in that I couldn't leave campus without taking a car or bus). As a result, I found myself visiting York's common spaces far more frequently for lunch that at U of T, where I could've easily left the campus. These common spaces were often filled with clubs or activities, and reminded me immensely of my high school cafeteria in the ways in which I would be approached about certain events. \n\nYork's isolation from its surrounding community and its reliance on its common spaces builds a more closed community that, in my mind, is more reminiscent of a high school than Toronto's other two large universities. That feeling of having entered post-secondary yet having that secondary feeling fills me with a sense of that \"sub-par\" attitude that some have about York.",

I do wish Keele campus was in a more urban area but that's not really something I can take out on the university itself, and it's certainly not something that affects the academic quality or experience. To an extent, the campus' isolated location definitely does affect social life on campus. However, the more closed community is massive, since York has a large population. It is it's own population with lots of different groups regardless, and I hope this does well for students wanting to socialize more!",

Honestly the uni feuds are so unnecessary.  If you want to go to a school go to that school, but don\u2019t be mad or upset at the school you chose because of what people say.  I went to UofT because of what people were telling me in my last year of high school.  All that pressure made me make a quick decision which I regretted almost instantly after attending classes there.  I remember visiting a friend on York\u2019s Keele campus and immediately fell in love with the school and the vibe.

Very old labs and facilities (except bergeron building). No real social scene or commuter friendly student life scene\n\nSo for me it is not so much the academics or the ranking but more so all of this ancilliary stuff that is better at other unis (used to go to U of T and all of that was much, much better there)",

We need events/people attending events like a HOCO, sports games, parties in the village, or more social school events to bring some life back into this campus, it will allow for us to be connected and make more friends\n\n2. The first point can\u2019t happen with everyone\u2019s super inconvenient commute, and that needs to change, York isn\u2019t as commuter friendly as it used to be, GO buses aren\u2019t dropping you off in front of Vari Hall as they used to, so when a commute from a city as close as Mississauga exceeds to an hour and a half to two hours one way, it\u2019s time to realize that commuting isn\u2019t the best option as it used to be so start thinking about moving in because as someone who\u2019s done both my grades and mental health changed, my entire outlook on the school became so positive yet disappointed because of the potential it\u2019s missing by how much it\u2019s shitted on\n\n3. This is a small one but I promise a little pride goes a long way but WEAR YOUR MERCH AND REP YOUR DAMN SCHOOL it\u2019s so weird going to a university where no one wears any of its merch\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong there\u2019s a lot more issues coming from the administrative side but in terms of student life it\u2019s something we can take control of",

In the first paragraph I specifically stated that my post was not to discredit anyone's poor experience with the school, and that the contents of the post were about the general culture of unnecessarily excessive and unfair hate the school gets. Therefore, whatever blame I put forth in my post was absolutely not directed at students like yourself, nor did I imply anywhere that it was okay for York faculty to treat anyone horribly.\n\n&gt;That we are all stupid first year students and that the poor professors are the real victims here.\n\nI never said this. Kindly re-read the part I mentioned first year students. And please share where exactly I may have implied that the professors were the victims.\n\n&gt;Honestly, I feel like telling you to go suck a dick. It\u2019s crass but it summarizes well how I feel.\n\nYou are more than welcome to maturely and appropriately share how you feel. But this is not how you do that.\n\nI'm sorry to hear of the poor experience you had at York, and I sincerely hope the institutional issues that affected you will be corrected for future students. I wish you all the best.\n\nFor future York students: York is absolutely not trash. It's a great school and I hope you have a wonderful student experience. Your negative experiences are valid so long as you are fair in your assessment of the school. I hope you don't fall into the excessive hate culture and instead make the best of your student years. Lots of us students have had a fantastic time here, and you absolutely can too. I hope comments like the above don't discourage you.",

                                    "comment": "Hi again. \n\nI'm not sure how I can make it anymore clear that I was specifically criticizing the excessive and unfair hate the school gets, and not the legitimate and fair criticisms students have of the school. I've stated this several times. \n\nI believe your thinking is flawed in that a post like mine must be a PR stunt by York. Because it's not, and if you glance at the several comments by students sharing my thoughts, you will see that many /students/ feel the same way. \n\nThe point of my post is in the title. I wish students did not have to feel ashamed or upset for going to York because of the excessive and unfair hate the school gets. That's it. I don't understand how my intentions \"missed the point\" of /your/ specific issues with the school when they are not related (as you have made it clear you don't fall under the category of students I was specifically criticizing). \n\nOf course morale will improve when service quality improves... but my post has /nothing/ to do with service quality. My post, once again, has to do with the excessive culture of /unfairly/ criticizing York, and how /that culture/ affects the morale of York students. I've made it clear in my post that York, as with other universities, has legitimate issues, and I've also made it clear that was never what my post was about. \n\nI don't understand how my attempt at presenting York in a fairer light to encourage students is doing a disservice to them. Of course students should pressure the school to improve where it fails and lacks, but criticizing the school unfairly for things that aren't exactly the fault of the school is not going to achieve that. All it achieves it a poorer reputation and poorer morale based on an incorrect reality. \n\nI think, however, that /you/ are doing a disservice to York students by presenting the school in an unfairly negative light and intentionally discouraging students. \n\nYou called me \"dismissive\" earlier, but you yourself dismissed every response of mine and failed to clarify or elaborate on where I made any of the claims you accused me of making in your original comment. \n\nI can't make my post any clearer, so I won't be responding to this thread anymore. If there are any remaining confusions about my post, what I meant, my intentions, etc., feel free to PM me, or just (and I mean this sincerely) re-read my post. \n\nFinally, I know you didn't ask for advice, but I think it's appropriate to say this: please don't disagree with people by putting words into their mouth and telling them they should \"go suck a dick\". Aside from being extremely disrespectful and uncalled for, it also does not improve your argument or produce a fruitful discussion. \n\nThanks and have a good day.",

Your comments were bitter attempts to frame your poor experience with the school as universal and factual with no consideration for the students my post was directed to.\n\nYou shouldn't argue with people if you can't refrain from being crude towards them, and you shouldn't put words in people's mouth if you dodge their requests for you to clarify where you found those words.\n\nYour personal opinion does not devalue anyone's degree. York University degrees are highly valuable. Go argue with an employer.",

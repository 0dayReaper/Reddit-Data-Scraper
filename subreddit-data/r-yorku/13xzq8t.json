I didnt now that I needed permisson for those and I just started enrolling then I contacted to the chemistry department and they told me that only section C on fall is for BSc students and this section is on the evening and it messed up my schedule cuz I prepared my schedule for mornings. Can I change my whole schedule now? Like should I exchange courses?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI took the course a couple of years ago and there was a recommended textbook on the syllabus. I wanted to revisit some stuff from the book but I don't remember the name and I don't have a copy of the syllabus anymore. Just wanted to see if anyone who is currently enrolled in the course or has done it in the past may be able to help.\n\nThank you!",

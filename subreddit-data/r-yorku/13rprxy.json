The website seems to be very inviting and welcoming to mature students but I\u2019m wondering if anyone has experience applying as a mature student with no previous post secondary or any knowledge about it? If someone in here has been in a similar situation, please share as well! Thank you.",

I got in during the same year where people fresh out of HS were getting rejected with much higher grades. I had to write a cover letter and submit my resume as a part of my mature student application, and I think the effort I put into those really helped.\n\nYour military experience I think shows a lot more potential for success in university than my work experience did, so you've probably got an even better shot than I succeeded with.",

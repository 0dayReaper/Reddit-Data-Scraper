But as a mature student I noticed this generation is extremely anti social and triggered and I didn\u2019t mesh well in York\u2019s environment. I just went to class, and went home. It\u2019s a shame because people can really learn a lot from others if they actually take the time to know people. You could potentially meet someone life changing on campus when attending classes but everyone is in their own world. I went to class and went home because although I am a social, talkative person, I can tell by others body language they don\u2019t want to.",

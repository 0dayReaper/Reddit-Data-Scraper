    "postText": "I\u2019m just a little upset. I will be transferring to York from Uottawa and I will be going into the direct 4 year nursing program. I took anatomy and physiology I, II and III in uottawa and completed them. Because anatomy and physiology are basically all the same everywhere, I thought they would waive it. However, I just got my advising notes and out of 48 credits granted only 6 credits are applicable for the nursing program. Meaning I will have to RETAKE anatomy and physiology AGAIN. I work very hard to get a good mark on these courses and I was difficult. I am very upset because all the 3 years I studied in uottawa is didn\u2019t worth anything. Is there anyway I can fix this because I know that anatomy and physiology are the same all around and I does not make sense for me to retake this class again.",

Would that set you back too far at York? Just seems like you should try to get what you can out of the UOttawa 3 year experience...",

A syllabus you never submitted). The transfer process is so odd, I had to retake several course (ex. General Chemistry) despite them being the exact same \u2014 even down to the lane \u2014 and getting course exemptions for upper year classes that require them as prereqs",

As well, they deemed certain courses not to meet their requirements (even though they were the exact same) and used them towards my general education. It\u2019s honestly a very weird process, ik people who have transferred from other schools and into similar programs but got 0 credits. Tbh there\u2019s no harm in trying to get your credits reassessed",

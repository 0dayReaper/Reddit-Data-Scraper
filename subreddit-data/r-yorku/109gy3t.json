I've had classes where I legitimately couldn't understand the professor; they've been several different ethnicities, including Chinese, Greek, and Italian. I don't care, and I assume most people don't care, what ethnicity they are - It's the fact that we can't fucking understand them when they're teaching difficult, technical subjects. \n\nThere's times where the prof is saying a word repeatedly, and only much later when I'm reviewing my scribble and reading the textbook do I finally connect what they were trying to say. It'd be nice if I knew this while they were explaining it, so I could connect it with my existing knowledge.\n\nConsidering that the cost of a course is independent of the prof, it's really shitty when there's such a huge discrepancy in quality between courses.",

So a bunch of people can be racist so long as it\u2019s out of earshot? That\u2019s not cool. It\u2019s still not a good thing in any way, all it takes is for one, ONE person in that group to have the means to \u201ctake out\u201d a bunch of people in a race they don\u2019t like, and you have another Nathaniel Veltman who might try and take people out when they\u2019re having a bad day",

Being an actual racist, and committing fucking war crimes. \n\nLike I\u2019ll go first, wow Indian dude, bro your such a curry muncher. \n\nDo I think this is funny? Yea.\n\nDo I harbour any hate towards any Indian people? Absolutely not I don\u2019t hate them at all.\n\nAm I going to go to a place of worship and commit thousands of crimes. No, fuck no. I\u2019m not a psychopath.\n\nThere\u2019s a pretty thick line, just because someone says dude there\u2019s a car you could go steal as a joke to get their friends laughing. And shooting up a place.",

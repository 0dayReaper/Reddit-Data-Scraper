    "postText": "I'm wondering if someone could please explain because the YorkU website is saying that summer course payment was due May 10. I payed for my S1 course before May 10 but I did not pay for my S2 course yet. I noticed all of a sudden that I got charged interest because I haven't payed for my S2 course yet. I misunderstood and I thought only S1 and SU course payment was due May 10. So S2 course payment is always due in May?! Like, how did I not know this?! Is this interest going to show up permanently on my academic transcript or academic record?! Does anyone know?!",

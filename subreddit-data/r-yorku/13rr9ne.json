    "postText": "Hi! So I'm accepted under the law &amp; society major and I've already selected and got in majority of my courses. However, I wanted to take Intro to Arabic for beginners but it was reserved for majors.\n\nDoes anyone know when it would be open for me taking? I was thinking about becoming an Arabic minor because I know for sure I'll need Arabic for the rest of my life and have to learn at some point, so why not during university?\n\nAnyways, summed up, how do I take Arabic as a non-language/arabic major?",

    "postText": "As per title. My Hs grades don\u2019t really qualify but York says they don\u2019t look at grades but rather life and work experience. I\u2019ve been military since high school so I\u2019d say I check off those boxes. Anyone has any knowledge or experience on the subject? I wrote, what I believe to be, a good personal letter for my application as well as I believe my resume is well rounded but I\u2019m still stressed about admissions for my case.\n\nEdit: I got admitted, thank you for everyone for the help! Very much appreciated.",

There\u2019s a lot of support for mature students. Check out ACMAPS https://acmaps.info.yorku.ca/   You might not get admission to programme you want, first year, but don\u2019t assume anything. Good luck!  Go for it!!",

I will suggest you sign up into an adult school around your area as they are many many many of them. You redo 4 courses only caz they look at only 4 courses for mature students and your admission will be guaranteed. Adult education centres are quick and also fun. You finish the course in like 8 weeks and you have a real learning experience. Online schooling is boring. I have tutored students that did online schooling, but they listened to me and joined adult education centres and are now in Unis. And adult education centres are Gov funded and free.",

I deliberately didn\u2019t study for exams bc I stupidly stubbornly thought whatever I absorbed in class would be good enough. I sat at the back and made smart comments. In my first class I was late 30 times by mid fall term. I made sure to get home early to intercept mail from school and forged my mothers signature on notes. I skipped days of classes to go skiing.  I did almost zero homework. I continued to dream, for 20 years after graduating that I was still in highschool as a twenty year old, having trouble finishing. Now I\u2019m sure you were a better student than me. Take advantage of all the resources. The Writing Centre. Seminars on how to study. Library resources. Get in front of the ball and never get behind on assignments. Read the syllabus. Understand it. Ask peeps how they study. If you\u2019re faltering in the first couple of weeks get help. You can do it.",

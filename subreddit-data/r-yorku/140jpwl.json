    "postText": "Hi everyone! So I have offers from both these programs at YorkU and Idk which one to pick! I\u2019m into blockchain dev a little bit and already completed a course at George Brown but I\u2019m worried it might be a little repetitive. I\u2019m also into cybersecurity, I read a lot about it which is why I\u2019m in a BIGGGG DILEMMA. \n\nHas anyone done any of these before and would like to help me pick? I know the final decision is mine, but I\u2019d really live some clarity on these programs, would be grateful if it was first hand.\n\nThanks alot!",

            "comment": "Not sure about any of these programs since I'm in computer science. However, one thing to consider is job prospects. Blockchain is a more niche field, whereas cyber security is a more open pathway in terms of jobs. Also, you already have blockchain education, so it would be better to diversify for your resume and just getting a new experience. \n\nSorry, I know I didn't exactly answer your question, but still something to consider when deciding.",

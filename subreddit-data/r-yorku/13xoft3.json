    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am an upcoming iBsc CS student this Fall but I want to change to Bsc CS minor in Stats (or just simply Bsc CS). \nCan I do the program change right now? (Before Fall semester start) \n\nThe reason is I have 30 credits granted (including 21 science credits at the 1000 level and 3 science credits at the 2000 level) but it didn\u2019t applied to my degree checklist and I think it\u2019s because of the international component of iBsc.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "postText": "Software engineering (Majo\n\nHello everyone, I have a question about my career (software engineering).  \n\nYork University staff ask me to choose the \"major\" for my software course.  They give me 3 options, general stream, big data stream and security stream.  I was researching the difference between big data and security, but I don't know the meaning of the general stream or what it is about.  \n\n-Which option do you recommend I choose?  \n\n-Or can you give me an example of what kinds of jobs I can get?  \n-Or in which can I have a better opportunity to find a good job?  (I know this question depends on other factors)",

            "comment": "It comes down to the courses youll take in third/ fourth year. All three streams take pretty much the same first and second year courses, but in your third/fourth year, the big data stream take courses more geared towards data science like EECS 4415, and security stream will take courses related to computer security like EECS 3216. The general stream I guess is just a broader collection of courses related to software engineering. You also have less required courses and can choose 9 credits from a pool of different eecs courses.\n\nYou'll have a good opportunity to find jobs in whichever stream, it just depends on what you want to do/ specialize in. Working internships are a good way to help you find employment after uni, and getting your first one will require you to have good projects, extracurriculars etc regardless of whatever stream you choose. \n\nYou can refer to this for more info if you havent already. It outlines some potential jobs\n\n[https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/software-engineering](https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/software-engineering)\n\nRefer to this also for the course checklist for each stream.\n\n[https://lassonde.yorku.ca/eecs/academics/undergraduate/future-students/software-engineering-beng/](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/eecs/academics/undergraduate/future-students/software-engineering-beng/)",

            "comment": "I took the course in winter 2023. It was 10% participation (written reflections on lectures, only 5/11 needed to get full marks), 18% bi-weekly online quizzes (with unlimited attempts, so basically participation), one midterm worth 32%, and the exam worth 40%. The midterm and exam were mostly multiple choice with some short answer questions. About half of the MC questions came directly from the quizzes. If you show up for class, do all the participation stuff, and review the quizzes before the exams, you'll get a good grade. She's an average lecturer, not bad, but not great. She's relatively organized and tries to be as engaging as possible (somewhat successfully), but she had a hard time answering questions sometimes. Overall, she's a decent prof.",

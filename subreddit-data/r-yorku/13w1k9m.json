As a Black woman myself, after seeing his face on CBC I could not stop laughing knowing his behaviour.",

Thus contrary to the popular narrative racism isn't \"in the past\" because \"it just happened yesterday\".\n\nIf the number was higher it would  mean we've lasted more days without racism. \n\n0 days since last racism = racism yesterday  \n30 days since last racism = racism was last month\n\nbigger numbers are better. it's a play on jobsites representing their accidents.

For the first point....I'm talking about common folk in general that just don't support the fact of having something plaster claiming shit like this. I have friends that told me that this should be common sense, ya don't need to announce it to the world. It leads a bad precedent of others to be super cautious of approaching that background subconsciously. The ones that do support having a poster like this have some sort of presence of needing to stand up and have an ego for pushing things like this. The other thing is like why don't other  forms of discrimination aren't showcased like this. Then it becomes a mess to accommodate, so its best not to even do stuff like this. Plus apparently it was for one of the profs working here, just redundant tbh. Hope that cleared things up",

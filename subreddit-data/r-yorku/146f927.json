There are no rules or stipulations as long as you have previously taken the prerequisite for that course.\n\nMany courses don't have prerequisites so you can take them in any year. Meaning that you can take 4000 level courses in first year if it doesn't have a prerequisite.\n\nYou should check your degree progress report on York's website to see if you are required to take X amount of courses at each level. Can't remember my program's exact numbers but I have to take a set number of credits at the 3000 level and at the 4000 level. As a result, I may not be able to take a 1000 or 2000 level course when I am in 4th year.",

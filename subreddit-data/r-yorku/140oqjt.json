    "postText": "I\u2019m planning on graduating the general 90 credit BCOM program, but I\u2019m second guessing if I should specialize. If I were to specialize, it would be a marketing specialization. Do employers care if you have a marketing specialization rather than a regular bachelors of commerce? I\u2019m ideally wanting to start my own business after graduating, but idk if the specialization is worth the extra year?",

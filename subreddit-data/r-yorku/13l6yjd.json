    "postText": "So here is little update for my refund process: after two weeks to set up my direct deposit on my student account\uff0ci finally received a penny check to my bank and verify my information. However, it\u2018s another week after this information verify. I called the school twice this week and yesterday a nice lady just told me they gona start my refund process. Good, and I saw my negative balance on my student account immediately went to 0 and on transaction it said \u201dChequeissue\u201c with \u201dRefund cheque\u201c near by. Is this correct process for them process refund? How long will it take this direct deposit sent to my bank? Just wait or do something again?",

It is not an indication of whether you will receive an EFT or a cheque. \n\nYou must have EFT \"verified\" BEFORE the refund is requested. \n\nIf this is the case, then EFT runs every Wednesday/Friday + 3 to 5 business days to get deposited into your account.",

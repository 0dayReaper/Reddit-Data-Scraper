Work on the reasons they have provided in your case write a separate letter and explain in detail your connections/ties to India and why you have to come back to India after your studies. Seek for professional help or you can even send it here. Best of luck. You will get it this time",

            "comment": "What reason did they give for the refusal? I'd ask for the ITA notes. They may take a while so in the meantime craft your application to submit a new one. \n\nThink about the three most common causes for refusal (lack of funds, lack of ties to your home country or course selection that doesn't make sense with your history). Then re-write the documents to address these topics. When you get the notes you can focus on what they had to say and finish the documents for submission.\n\nYork has immigration advisors that can help you in case of a refusal. You can find more information here: https://yorkinternational.yorku.ca/international-student-advising/ (1:1 virtual).\n\nAlso, don't give up! I understand this is a very stressful moment but it is possible to revert negatives, specially with professional advising. It will be worth it! I wish you the best on your process.",

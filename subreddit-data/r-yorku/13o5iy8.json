            "comment": "The comment here is right, life sciences in UofT is definitely more difficult compared to York\u2019s biomedical sciences program. However, that does not make York\u2019s program any less difficult to pass or graduate from. I\u2019m speaking based off of other people\u2019s experience from people who has already been there or is going to those schools n programs. In UofT, what makes this place extra difficult is because of their POST program. You\u2019re not actually in your desired program until second year which you have to compete for a spot there, as they prioritize people with higher grades. Not only is it competition to get in but competition for your program as well. If you don\u2019t do your best in your first year, you might not actually be put in the program of your choosing, hence usually making people drop out after the first year :)",

Why would they not turn on AC or atleast stop heating in corridor\u2019s which is making these building\u2019s unbearable? \n\nAlready sent them email, posted on Facebook group but no action whatsoever.",

Send them emails and visit York apartments office. They wait for (God knows which) contractor to switch from heating to cooling which is literally work of few hours.\n\nStay strong and keep your refrigerator door open.",

            "comment": "Ooof.  There's a city bylaw that requires heating to 21C be supplied to all rental units till June 1.  Global warming.  It can sometimes get very cold in late May these days, and almost always did historically, on May 24 long weekend. It can take days to turn a boiler system off and on, let alone if you can get the contractors to come and do the work because they're working on all of the other buildings at the same time. \n\nI too, like other hot humans, enjoy perfect temperatures, but these shoulder seasons are challenging to deal with.  They could change systems to AC, and then temps plunge and then you're freezing.  It's brutal...Don't hate me for illuminating. I am currently roasting in my rental apartment. They tend to turn off heat in my building around May 20.\n\nHere's the piece of the bylaw:\n\n\"Landlord shall ensure that a minimum air temperature of 21 degrees  Celsius is maintained in all areas of the dwelling unit from September  15 in each year to June 1 in the following year. Subsection A is only  applicable to a dwelling unit that is normally heated at the landlord's  expense.\"\n\n[https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184\\_497.pdf](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_497.pdf)\n\nAnd yes, landlords are encouraged to turn off the heating...using long-range forecasting as a guide.",

            "comment": "York is stupid for this. I remember I lived in Passy, it was HOT in May and they still had the heating running. It\u2019s stupid. Students spend so much money and York can\u2019t even give adequate services. Those buildings are old and students should complain. This university makes millions and millions every year, silly to think they can\u2019t make repairs. That was the issue with passy residence. \n\nThe maintenance guy told me, the issue is they can\u2019t have heating and cooling at the same time is because of how it\u2019s designed. So they only turn it on once it reaches certain temperatures when it\u2019s getting close to summer. I remember it was so humid inside passy cres residence in March or April, I had 3 fans running, heating was turned off, window was open and I still couldn\u2019t sleep.",

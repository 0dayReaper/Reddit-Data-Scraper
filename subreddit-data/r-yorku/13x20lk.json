            "comment": "This is the exact same schedule I had last year in my first semester of engineering. Only difference is that I didn't have MATH1013 (I had transfer credits) and my PHYS1800 lab was at a different time.\n\nOne suggestion I would give is to try to switch to an earlier lab on Monday (if possible) or some other day. My lab was on a Wednesday from 2:30-4:30pm. My EECS1011 lab time was also different from yours.\n\nAlso, one thing to note: if James Smith is teaching EECS1011 again, then you don't have to go to that 3-hour lab. He gives his students the option to submit their labs asynchronous. So, you can submit your lab before the weekly deadline (which was Sunday for us). If you really need the TA's assistance otherwise, they host the lab sessions on Zoom too.",

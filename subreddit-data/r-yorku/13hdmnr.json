(takes a few weeks)\n\nYou can request a refund at any time as long as you have a negative balance on your student balance statement.  https://apps4.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/OSS\n\nrefund info: https://sfs.yorku.ca/refunds/request\n\n---- \nFYI if you're domestic on OSAP:\n\nYou **must** to inform OSAP that your course load has changed. Don't refund anything if it's from OSAP, OSAP will deduct it themselves from your student account. After they do that and you have remaining balance, you request a refund.\n\nGuide on how to submit the OSAP form:\n\n    Fill out this form https://secure.students.yorku.ca/pdf/change-request.pdf\n\n    On the osap website click \"Go to my full time applications\" -&gt; print/upload documents for the year you applied for -&gt; click optional uploads - &gt;upload the filled PDF under \"Review documents\"\n    \n    https://osap.yorku.ca/how-to-upload-your-osap-supporting-documents\n    \n    Your funding will be recalculated when they review the documents",

If I drop the course the money will automatically go to my student account? No Refund button or anything? Apologies I\u2019m a bit panicked",

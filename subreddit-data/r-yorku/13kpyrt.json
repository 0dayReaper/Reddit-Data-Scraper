    "postText": "I am an international incoming first-year student at YorkU (Lassonde School of Engineering). Could anyone please advise me on what residence hall would be the best for me? I am interested in suite style with in-room bathrooms (a kitchen would be preferred too). Should I go for the York Residence Halls or the Quads which aren't owned by York? I was wondering if there would be any benefits of residing in the York residence halls over the Quads as a first-year student looking to network, make friends, and indulge myself in the residence hall activities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs per my research suite style is offered only by:\n\nPond (unable to choose this as I'm a first year student)\n\nBethune\n\nCalumet\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",

You can find new ecosystem in the shared bathroom and toilets fr. I would recommend going for Quad or Stong if you can\u2019t get into Pond. Note that except for Quad, you\u2019ll share bathroom with at least 5 people.",

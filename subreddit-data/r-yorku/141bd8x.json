Most people including myself as a 4th year haven't even enrolled yet.\n\nMy enrolment date is the 14th of this month and I don't plan on enrolling into any 2nd year courses. You will have an earlier enrolment than the 1st year students. Thus, there will likely be space for you. Don't worry too much about it rn",

Lol. \n\nWhen it comes time for you to enrol, if this message pops up when you\u2019re enrolling in a course, you fire off an email to the department, you provide them with the course ID number, your student ID, and they will remove the barrier so you can add the course.  \n\nIf the message says the course is full, you just keep attempting to add it until the start of the semester.  \n\nIf it remains full at the start of the term, you go to the first class, and at the end, you tell the prof you want to take the class, but it\u2019s full \u2026. If a spot doesn\u2019t open up, the Prof will grant you permission to enrol, which is a signed document, that gets sent back to the department, they open a spot for you, and then you can enrol.  \n\nYes, it Sounds complicated.  \n\nYes, it is Definitely annoying.  \n\nBut, this is normal, and I can guarantee with almost 100% certainty, the sun will still come up tomorrow and your business will get resolved.  \n\nGood luck &amp; welcome.  :)",

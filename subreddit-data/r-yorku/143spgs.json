    "postText": "So I recently went to Quad Dental, and on the first day I did both checkup and a cleaning. The receptionist said I don't need to pay anything because my insurance covered it, but it's almost over. \n\nThe yfs website says they pay a maximum of up to 700 dollars. So my cleaning cost over 600 dollars? Or is there something I'm missing? My main question is how much are they actually paying per year?",

            "comment": "There is no way your cleaning costs over 600 dollars lol. A cleaning can cost anywhere from $80-$130. It really depends on what clinic you go to. \n\nIf you log onto Green Shield with your student details you can check how much insurance you actually used. My last cleaning I believe cost me about $130 and YFS covers 70% of the cost. \n\nHowever the website now claims they cover 75% up to $600. Perhaps they changed the coverage or the website is outdated. [https://www.yfs.ca/healthplan](https://www.yfs.ca/healthplan)\n\nWith your dental insurance you could do cleanings, wisdom teeth removals, etc. If you're going to a dentist on campus the receptionist could probably help explain to you how your insurance works because a lot of students also use this clinic. They are used to using the York insurance so any concerns you might have, Quad Dental can definitely explain to you.",

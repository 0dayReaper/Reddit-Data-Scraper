    "postText": "I am currently enrolled in YorkU and want to switch programs. the program I want to take requires data management, which I did not take in high school. On the program change website it says that for a degree change (I am switching from a BA to BDEM)  I need to submit between January 1st and June 30th. Would they let me in conditionally or am I screwed? Cause I am not gonna be able to finish this course on time with how long its taking for them to mark, Thank you.",

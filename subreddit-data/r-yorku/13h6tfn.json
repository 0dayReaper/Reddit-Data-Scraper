Other than eecs 2011. \n\n\nIf it's just eecs 2011 \n\nyou need to take eecs 1015 or 1012 (recommend 1015) intro to programming, 1022 in the next semester (intro to oop) and the math courses (math 1013, 1014, 1019) \n\nThis would be your first year courses. Also you need to take science courses (chem, phys, biol) 6 credits of those. u can mix or match and take them whenever but you need them for your bsc.\n\n\nSo yeah just let me know what courses got waived and I can help you pick the courses you need\n\nBTW don't worry too much about enrollment, you're very early everyone else enrolls in june. So you could wait till the appointment and still get space in the courses",

            "comment": "Hey, so it's saying that you had 30 credits granted (i.e. 10 courses). Did you submit your course outlines from Mohawk College? Usually they ask for the course outlines and then they audit it and tell you which course equivalences have been granted. In this they  granted one course exclusion which is EECS 2011 (which has now been changed to the the name EECS 2101), which means you don't need to take this one course for CS and you can assume you have the prerequisite EECS 2011 going forward.I'm not sure if your audit is still happening, if it is they'll add more equivalencies later on, but usually first year is pretty much the same everywhere (ex. discrete math, calc I, calc 2, intro to programming etc.) so if you have already taken those courses and submitted the course outlines for them then you should be getting credits for them so you don't need to take them again at York.\n\nYou can get your most updated transfer credit statement following the second link on here: [https://registrar.yorku.ca/program/transfer-credit](https://registrar.yorku.ca/program/transfer-credit)\n\nYou can get more info about transfer credits here: [https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/transfer-credit/transfer-connect](https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/transfer-credit/transfer-connect) (not sure if they're still taking bookings though :/)\n\nAfter your academic advising appointment you get an email (if it's still virtual) that shows how to enrol in courses ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSEoiQ\\_A4yE&amp;ab\\_channel=WorkStudyLassonde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSEoiQ_A4yE&amp;ab_channel=WorkStudyLassonde)) and a checklist that shows you which courses you need and which ones you already have.  \n\n\nEdit: Also adding, reading the course prereqs and course names can get pretty confusing, a student made this site which is pretty helpful, [https://presidentkevvol.github.io/YorkCSClassList/](https://presidentkevvol.github.io/YorkCSClassList/), you can use it when you're selecting courses in the future to see what you need/can take. (Just make sure you double check everything since it isn't an official school site).",

In my statement of transfer credit, they only noted 3 course exclusions (9 credits) and waived 6 credits for general education. My degree check-list is the same like a normal check-list (no course exempted). So how can I know which course I have credit transfer to? \n(I\u2019m not from Mohawk btw but from an outside Canada university)",

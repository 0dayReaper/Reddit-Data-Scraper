I applied for res an got in (not fully realizing how expensive it is) now I\u2019m freaking out and I don\u2019t think I want to go anymore. Does anyone have any tips on how to manage the stress and/ or if delaying school another year and staying in yyc is a better option??",

Try to figure out why you feel this way and if it\u2019s not the right thing for you you can make another choice or take a year off and take your time. Wish you well and likely others will have good advice for you.",

You\u2019re gonna be stressed that\u2019s a part of doing something new you\u2019ll meet new people and things will get easier. The cost is a personal thing that\u2019s for you to decide but I personally don\u2019t have any regrets. What program are you in?",

    "postText": "Hello! I start my 2 year MSW this coming Fall. York\u2019s policy states that graduate students cannot work more than 10 hours a week, so I will have to quit my full-time job.\n\nThis being said, I\u2019m not sure how my bills are supposed to be paid like this. Sure, the program itself is paid for, and I am getting an entrance scholarship, but over the span of 2 years this just doesn\u2019t seem feasible.\n\nAnyways I\u2019m wondering if I can apply for OSAP despite having my program fully funded, since I will not be able to work more than 40 hours a month for the next two years??? I am very stressed by this.",

            "comment": "i suggest u keep the first set of schedule and kick ur science credits for the summer, and add math 1025 instead of econ OR switch it with chem 1000.  \n\nphys 1411 is fine, chinese will only fulfill your electives but i didnt really hear good things about the profs(check rmp), take a better language course like jp1000. why not take psych online? seems convenient. but psych will also only fulfil your electives. \n\ntake 1013/1014 only if the profs for 1300/1310 are worse, otherwise it doesnt matter but 1300/1310 is theory heavy while the other ones is just application, easier to do better ig(1013/1014. \n\ni just suggest u push chem/phys for the summer and instead do some easy electives alongside ur core courses, last thing u wanna do is get overwhelmed, go under 4.0 and be kicked for a year but ofc i dont think youll go through that\n\ngood luck child, i hope u do the best and dm me if u need assistance later on",

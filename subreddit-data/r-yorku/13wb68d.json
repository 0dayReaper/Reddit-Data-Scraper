NEVER PLAN TO SKIP AN ASSESSMENT IF YOU FEEL UNPREPARED. No like literally, this is the worst thing you can do. This isn't highschool. Never do this. It will haunt you down to your grade\n\n3. If you feel like your prof is not very good at explaining topics or if you find that you understand the topics better by reading the textbook, you don't need to go to the lectures(if they aren't mandetory). \n\n4. You will probably take MATH 1013/1014, but I will put this as a general advice: courses that involve proofs, doesn't expect you to know every thing. They are designed in a way that makes you discuss with other students and learn collaboratively. You will feel stressed if you don't get help / talk with students abt assignments. -- this does not mean copying from other students. \n\n5. While picking courses, try to take them together without huge gaps in between. But also keep in mind that \"quality of prof &gt; quality of your timetable\". Take a good prof over a huge gap in timetable, or even it requires you to come early. A good prof will be more beneficial for your marks than a prof who is a hard marker + test heavy. \n\n6. Get involved + enjoy",

I had an 89-90 which isn't super competitive for computer science but didn't realize this would happen. Anyways, with that in mind how good is the Information Technology program here from an employability standpoint?",

            "comment": "Since I've only experienced the IT program within York and not other IT programs in other universities, my evaluation of the IT program may be limited.\n\nHowever, I believe it depends on what you career in IT you really want to be. I believe they are adding more courses in terms of cybersecurity so maybe that will be to your interest.\n\nIn terms of employability, I have no idea but it seems like you really have to go above and beyond your education to really standout. Don't expect to just take courses in the major and then be highly valued by companies.\n\nSo really take advantage of the LAPS internship program, DARE research programs, SNACK and PASS learning programs, and C4 programs to really gain experience in whatever you are interested in. \n\nBy utilizing the services mentioned above you can expand your network and met mentors who can develop your career. \n\nOne big negative about this program is that some courses may seem outdated so extra learning outside school hours are needed to acquire the current tech stack skills.",

I don't really mind the extra effort since I'm pretty passionate about cs but kinda sucks knowing im already behind employability wise. Thanks though.",

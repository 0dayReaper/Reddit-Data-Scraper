Or is there a set fee that we have to pay for each term \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude2d?\n\nPeople also suggested that summer  school is an option, but I was wondering if that\u2019s also a bit challenging as you would have to fit an entire terms work into a few months..\n\nIg I\u2019m just letting my anxiousness get the best of me, any advice would help :,)",

            "comment": "In my experience, *most* people who were able to handle a full course load in high school, who don't have other responsibilities such as work, and who do not have a learning disability or similar are able to do 5 courses just fine. Obviously, you don't have to do 5 courses, you could do 1 course a year if you really want! The evident tradeoff with fewer courses is that it will take you longer to graduate and/or force you into summer school (which in turn means it's harder to do other things in summer), but on the other hand, there's less schoolwork at any given time just because you are taking fewer courses. Also, there is a bit of a \"you never know until you try\" factor with course load; how much you are willing to risk this is strongly dependent on your end goal. Given that there is nothing inherently wrong with taking fewer courses, this is entirely up to you and in 99.9% of scenarios nobody will really know or care once you graduate.\n\nThere was a post floating around, I can't find it or confirm its veracity yet, but someone stated that most of the people who graduated with highest honours in engineering (!) did full course loads every year. I'll see if that's true at my graduation, but it checks out: generally the same soft skills that allow you to take more courses also improve your studying habits, and the people who are truly driven to get 8.0s are the ones who are prepared to devote lots of time to school so whatever extra time they need for those extra courses is accounted for.\n\nYour tuition is per-credit so 24 credits will be 4/5 of the tuition of 30 credits, excluding other things like supplementary fees and extra fees for specific courses.",

            "comment": "Hi! Sometimes it can be difficult to enrol in courses late because everything fills up. So my recommendation is to enrol in 5 and make your decision about dropping 1 before the drop (&amp; refund...) deadline! Pay attention to those important dates. You should be able to attend a few lectures/classes and assess the syllabus before making your decision. \n\nYou also want to look into whether taking only 4 courses will compromise your eligibility for things like OSAP. I know less about this than your peers might, so I'll leave it to them to explain. But it's my understanding that OSAP is dependant on being enrolled in a full course load. \n\nAll this said, I struggled with the transition in first year and I was an A+ high school student and here I am a professor... So it doesn't really matter how smart you are or how good you are at managing everything in high school. The transition to largely self-directed study at university is real... It's definitely okay - smart, even - to prepare yourself for it. No shame! &lt;3",

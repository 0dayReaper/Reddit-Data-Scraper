Cannaoisseur saying that shitty profs = not teachers means that shitty students would = not students.\n\nTo the initial post tho. u don\u2019t have to be a bad student to say that profs r not teachers. The statement just can\u2019t be entirely true (there has to be some who are) a good student or bad can realize this. In fact even someone who isn\u2019t a student could realize this (there are lectures online now)",

Of course, you should address profs differently by more formal terms, but do profs not provide you with new knowledge/skills just like any other sort of teacher whether it be in a high school, driving class, etc? Being a teacher can mean many things - it's not a word meant only for elementary/secondary school educators. Just my opinion :)",

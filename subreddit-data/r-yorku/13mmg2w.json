    "postText": "\nI hope you're all doing great! I recently reached out to the housing office for accommodation assistance. Unfortunately, they informed me that all applicants are currently on a waitlist, with an estimated processing time of 1-2 months. \n\nMy husband and I are considering booking an Airbnb for a month as a temporary solution but are there any strategies or tips you can share to potentially fasten the housing process? I would be grateful for any suggestions to secure an apartment in York before August.\n\nThank you so much for your time and support\u2014I truly appreciate it!",

            "comment": "By fasten the housing process do you mean for York apartments specifically or housing anywhere in Toronto? If you're already on the waitlist for York Apartments, there's nothing that can be done to speed it up, you have to just wait for a spot to become available based on other people moving out and the number of people ahead of you on the waitlist, etc. It's first come, first serve, so unfortunately you can't do anything other than wait and see if a spot will become available. \n\nAs for off-campus housing, you can check the school's online bulletin board for student housing, real estate/renting sites, Facebook pages, etc. I think The Quad is a popular choice to look into",

Some off-campus housing is not that far away from the campus.",

I may have made an error in estimating that it would take a month to find an apartment at York Apartments. I'm not sure whether we can find a long-term house at such affordable prices, but we will certainly explore the area. Thank you!",

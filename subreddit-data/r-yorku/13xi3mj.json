    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nSo I enrolled into my classes and it was just all over the place. I thought I was prepared but clearly wasn't. Anyways, it turns out that I have a lecture at 10:30 and ends at 12:30. But at 11:30 I have a tutorial for that same lecture (Tutorial is an hour long). I'm not sure exactly what to do. Any suggestions?",

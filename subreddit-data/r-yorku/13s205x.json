I am not asking u to do my work (pls i m not like that, i just need u to guide me i guess). I use computers everyday but don't know depth of its function like microspft. a 3 hour assigment is taking me 5 days now (not gonna mention the breakdowns but let ur imagination run wild) ty and i love u in advance. \n\n\\- from ur future best friend foreverrrrrrrr (insert infinity symbol)",

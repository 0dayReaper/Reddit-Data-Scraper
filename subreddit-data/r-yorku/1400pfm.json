    "postText": "Hello,\nI am 27 trying to go back to school to get my degree.\nI am thinking to go to York, but I have a few questions please.\nDo they teach Psychology in French, as my French is way better than English?\nIf I m in Ottawa, can I do all the courses online? If yes how is it?\nLastly, I graduated from college in 2020, I did a 3 years program, do I register as a mature student or transfer from college to university?\nThank you all for your help",

Do not quote me on this but I assume this would be the case given what I stated. \n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "Glendon college is part of York, and it\u2019s a fully bilingual campus. It\u2019s much smaller than the main campus.\nEvery psychology course at Glendon is offered in both French and English, you can definitely take all of your courses in French. \nI could be wrong, but to my knowledge the courses aren\u2019t available remotely and are all taught  in-person (My guess is that because of how small Glendon is, there is not enough demand for online courses so they aren\u2019t offered. - Don\u2019t take this for a fact as I could be wrong).\nI\u2019ve only taken psych courses in English at Glendon, that being said I have loved all of my courses and the profs are wonderful. Class sizes are considerably smaller (example: my first year intro to psych class had 30 students max, compared to the same course at Keele with 500+ , my largest course has been stats and that was around 70 students). You get a much more intimate learning experience and you have more opportunities to build good relationships with your profs which really makes a difference imo.",

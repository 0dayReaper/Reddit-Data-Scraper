    "postText": "Im a first year cs student that started in winter term. I finished my first sem and was planning to do my second sem in summer  where i\u2019m taking Math 1019, 1014, and eecs 1022. Unfortunately for a family emergency i will be out of country to take care of a sick parent. I plan to come back for midterms/ exams, as they all fall into the same week-2 weeks for all courses. \n\nMath 1019 has zoom lectures, and eecs 1022 has recorded lectures. Math 1014 just has lecture slides posted \n\nDo u guys think it\u2019s a good idea to try and do these courses out of country and only be back for evaluations or should i just take fully online electives and whatnot for this summer, and continue my degree core in the fall (basically delaying finishing 1st year )\n\nmy only concern is if i do that i will forget knowledge for the courses. i.e, math 1014 is a continuation of math 1013 which i just completed",

You may plan to be back in time for midterms and finals, but any number of things could happen that may prevent you from doing so. \n\nAlso, you will (not may, WILL) miss in person instruction that is not captured in the slides. If there are group projects, that will be a complication. If work must be submitted in person, that will also be a complication.\n\nIt may be worth tackling electives and other core courses that are offered remotely while you are out of country.",

School can be completed whenever, but you never know how long you will get to see your family. I say just take easy online electives this summer. I wouldn't worry about forgetting things either since you could easily get some quick review from YouTube videos or Khan Academy.",

You'll probably want to spend most of your time and not studying. You also don't want to potentially affect your grades. At the end of the day though, you know yourself best and what you can handle. Good luck!",

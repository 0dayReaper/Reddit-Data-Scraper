I planned to transfer after second year but real analysis (i took as an elective with permission because i originally wanted to go to grad school for economics) single-handedly lowered my gpa by 0.2 so I didn't. I am going into third year My current gpa is 8.4 with 66 credits. Would you say, it's too late for me?",

The program itself already has limited enrolment and it\u2019s already extremely hard to transfer after one year. \n\nIf you check the [BBA Delayed Entry](https://schulich.yorku.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Delayed-Entry-Package-2023_BBA.pdf). It doesn\u2019t hurt to still try applying, but it basically tells you that if you have additional years of post-secondary and seek advanced standing beyond first year, you might as well look into other undergrad degrees or try applying for Schulich Masters.",

    "postText": "I did the math and currently, if you assume a graduate student does 40 hours of work a week, they're making about $14 an hour. Most are doing closer to 50 or 60 - not including our own coursework. We're not allowed to take part time jobs and many of us are discouraged from taking on additional taing for increased pay. We then also have to pay tuition and most of us don't qualify for osap. \n\nWhen we TA, we're expected to work long hours with short marking deadlines. More than once I've had less than a week to mark &gt;200 exams (which isnt good for you guys either). Many us have been harassed and threatened by undergraduate students while teaching. \n\nMost of us love our research and we love teaching but it's hard to do that when you're extremely underpaid and overworked.\n\nI say all of this because the cupe collective agreement expires in August and bargaining will begin. I know York has a bad reputation for strikes and the past has left a bad taste in our mouths when we think of union negotiations but I beg you to pay attention. We need all the support we can get just to survive.\n\nEdit: I should specify, the work hour estimate was including both ta-ing and research.",

                                    "comment": "I'm sorry, but the idea that graduate students should do unpaid labour, is frankly absurd. Research is not at all separate from TAships for PhD students when it comes to funding. They are both part of the same contract you sign when you accept the position. The pay is completely tied to total funding values which we are expected to live on for 4+ years, we don't just take TA hours on a whim and get paid for them in a vacuum.\n\nComparing graduate student research work to undergraduate coursework is also complete nonsense. Coursework is produced purely for the purposes of learning and getting a degree. Graduate research is not. Graduate research goes towards publishing papers with the university's name on them and otherwise creating value for both professors and the university itself. Plenty of graduate students do the majority of actual work on papers their supervisors publish. Do you also think that professors should be paid based purely on the number of hours they teach? Undergraduate students are also typically able to work part time jobs and get OSAP to scrape by - not only are graduate students often too strapped for time to do so, but we are explicitly banned from seeking further employment! Undergraduate research jobs are also usually for pay in my field, by the way. A full time summer undergraduate research position actually pays more than base PhD student funding would for the summer after considering our tuition.\n\nFurthermore, at least in the sciences, the research work that a lot of graduate students do nowadays is essentially the exact same as we would be doing in industry. It's all coding/data science work. The only difference is that we get paid hardly anything for it since what we produce is owned by the university instead of a private company.\n\nIt's not really that I think you should include research in TA hours, but rather that you shouldn't think of either TA hours or hourly pay on their own. They should both be thought of together as part of a larger package, which is the effective salary we saw on the front of our offer letters and the expected full time work we agreed to. The cost of having a fancy degree at the end is in taking a full time job for 4 years that pays a third of starting salaries in industry to do the same work.\n\nNote that all of this is from a perspective of a science PhD student. The points may not apply to all programs, as some of them certainly function quite differently and already have yearly funding amounts at about half of what ours are.\n\nedit: I should also add that this is largely only a Canadian university thing. The funding packages tend to be labelled a fair bit differently at US universities, even though the work split is similar. They also tend to pay significantly more than we do in areas with lower cost of living, even before you do the currency conversion...",

The conflating of those two activities and calculating TA salary based on that makes very little sense.  It's not the same issue.  The OP could have complained about, for instance, poor funding for certain graduate programs, or for graduate programs in Canada (which you're making reference to in your comment- certainly claims that probably have a lot to be said for them).  But the OP was somehow making this about TA-ship, which I think I was trying to point out is not really sensical way of construing or describing this.  For instance, there are some grad programs where you are funded, or not funded, and even do not have authorization to work as a TA (some due to union rules, in some schools).  So I think my main issue is with OP rather bafflingly calculating TA salary through combining it with research.  Again, many grad students do research, but do not work as TA's.  For purposes of discussion, I think it makes more sense not to somehow fuse these together (when in reality they are not).  Your points about issues with grad funding are valid though, I think just the way OP chose to describe (what perhaps were actually the same issues), seemed to me confusing at best and misleading at worst.",

These students at York are actually funded quite well.  This has little to nothing to do with CUPE, I believe, but something to do with how much the school values that program, or the like.

I know UofT pay after tuition is about $3k higher than York for my program, as my supervisor is rather amazing (well, and wants to compete for good students) and pays her students extra to match them. \n\nThere is also some relation to CUPE for overall take home pay as well due to tuition indexation and some other factors. It's a huge mess, presumably by design for obfuscation, tax nonsense, etc. \n\nYork does require all of their PhD students to TA by the way, we don't allow self-funded students with TA exemptions like some universities do. The only way out of those FGS rules I know of is for your supervisor to buy out hours and I believe there are some limits on that. They need the workers for the huge amount of undergrads York has, they are actually often short on TAs to fill all the positions. York's TAing seems to be quite heavily linked to the rest of the system compared to some other schools.",

I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit of a hard marker. I generally give at least 0.5 mark for including something showing they tried but there have still been times where that hasn't been enough.\n\n For example, one of the courses I ta-d, the class average for an assignment was 65 because I wasn't given a rubric. I spent probably 10-15 hours just going through and making my own based on where they were supposed to be in the course only to find out 2 weeks later that they were way behind in lecture. We're told to take marks off for spelling and grammar but they don't say to what degree. Like I generally take off part marks if important things are consistently spelled wrong or if sentences are illegible but literally between 2 tas who read the instructions differently, that could be the difference of 10% in marking. Not to mention when we have to take marks off for \"writing and clarity\", that's a whole other layer of complication. \nIn this same course I was teaching a lab and a lot of us agreed that it was far too hard for the level we were teaching but we had to teach it and mark according to the coordinator.\n\n Again, I tried giving part marks and we're expected to meet with students outside of lab hours to explain things but when you're doing a 3 hour lab at 6pm with 1 hour cleanup and it's already gone 30 minutes over time and you're not being paid over time plus you haven't eaten yet, it's really hard to give any useful feedback \ud83d\ude05 \n\nDon't get me wrong, it is possible your ta just didn't like teaching that much but tbh I enjoy teaching and there's been a lot of times where I know I haven't been great at it because the school has just overworked me to the bone",

As long as spellings are concerned then of course the report had to be professional and presentable. May be that was one reason I always did great in my labs.

I think it is a really hard question to answer. I just feel bad for my friends who used to get screwed by TAs but again I mostly didnt have a problem but it did cost me entire semester mental torture and abuse. I have nothing against anyone. But this one TA everytime I recall her there is one word coming from my mouth and it is sadly the word bi*** . She is probably the only girl I ever linked the term bi*** with.",

This TA was marking our essays very inconsistently, and her feedback in one of my essays included highlighting a word and writing \"what does this word mean?\"\n\nAnother TA was for a math-related course. They were supposed to go over the practice questions we were supposed to review each week. However, they would just put a screenshot of the answer and nothing else. The professor said that the TA was supposed to hold a zoom video and show us a step-by-step solution as they solved it live, explaining each step thoroughly. Nope, all we got was a picture and a caption that said \"these are the answers\" which was something we could have gotten from the end of the textbook. The TA was supposed to teach us the steps, and failed at that job.\n\nAnother TA tried telling our professor that a bunch of students did not submit their assignments. All four students came forward with their submission confirmation emails, and resent the assignments straight to the professor. after the prof did some digging, turns out the TA did not mark everybody's assignment in time and decided to lie rather than admit that she did not finish her marking in time.\n\nOP, I am sure that you are a great TA. I am sure most of them are great. However, the bad ones can greatly ruin our experience and can genuinely cause some of us to do worse in a class than we deserved. As a result, you will find many students who begin despising TA's and start to assume that all of them do not care and are terrible.\n\nAs for the low pay and long hours, that is unfortunately between the TA and the school. It is not something that the TA should be complaining to the students about. The TA's know what they are getting themselves into, and know that it is minimal pay with extreme hours. If that is a concern, then the TA could have easily gotten a job doing anything else with less hours and a higher hourly rate, just like all of the other university students who also work part-time/ full-time.\n\nTA's have a belief that being a TA will be game changer for their resume, and use it to justify accepting a role with a low salary and long hours. However, being a TA is one of those things that has lost it's value, similar to how MBA's are losing their value, and unpaid internships are also losing their value. Being a TA is not as prestigious as it used to be, and I think TA's would be genuinely better off just getting a normal part-time or full-time job during their studies.",

Theres too many students for the full time profs to do the labs and marking. And in terms of complaining to the students, i dont complain to students in my sections but I absolutely will bring awareness to the conditions of grad programs at this school. The school won't do anything to help us survive and when the union goes on strike our names get dragged through the mud instead of the admin who refuses to help us live. Our stipends are the same as in 2003. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with asking for support in changing that and if anyone else was in a career where their wage hadn't increased in 20 years and they were near or under the poverty line then I would happily support them as well.",

It's just that the label on the pay changes around throughout the year. Total funding after tuition is something like $24k in the sciences, significantly less in other programs.",

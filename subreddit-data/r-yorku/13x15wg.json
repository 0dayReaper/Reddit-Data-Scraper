I just want to cry. Idk man. I\u2019m applying everyday on jobs and I have 0 interviews. I must be doing something wrong. I have over 110 applications to jobs and they don\u2019t want me lol.. maybe im just destined to be jobless or maybe comp sci isn\u2019t for me..\n\nI feel so terrible about myself. My friends have nice internships but here am I just at home jobless and relationship less.. my grades are mediocre but wtf am I gonna do with those grades if I can\u2019t find a job.",

There's definitely a bit of a luck component in job searching, but overall if your friends are getting interviews and you are not, what separates their resumes and processes from yours?\n\nIt's pretty hard to get a first internship in general. That said, there are things OP could do right now that will make it much easier in the future like getting resumes looked over, tailoring resumes to jobs, adding in extracurriculars, etc.\n\nAnecdotally, the people I know who were way involved in design teams and other clubs did a lot better in their job searches because that's quantifiable experience.",

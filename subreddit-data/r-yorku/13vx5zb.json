    "postText": "I am an incoming first-year student (international) at YorkU. I was offered a traditional style single-room at Bethune Residence Hall, costing me 7.5k CAD (plus a meal plan of 5k or 5.5k). I have seen a tour of all the rooms at Bethune and the single room feels like an extremely small room with no water facility to even wash my hands. In addition, I have heard mixed reviews about the common-floor bathrooms and the availability + cleanliness. The only pro of Bethune I find is the help offered in getting used to uni life and being surrounded by students of my age and program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have the option of choosing a shared room quad (single rooms are sold out) which would cost me approximately 13.5k including meals (excluding the electricity and water bill though). The quad rooms appear to be much much better but I'm worried that I will not have any students my age surrounding me. Plus, I heard there is no real help offered to get used to uni life as it is offered in Bethune. (Also, it would be really helpful if someone could tell me the average electricity and water bill for a room of 4 people).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease advise me on what to choose between the 2! If I was a sophomore then quad would have been a no-brainer....but being a freshman I'm wondering if bethune is really worth it",

There's a lot of Canadian as well as international students living there as well ranging from first year to last year students. Maintenance is super quick, it's a safe building (speaking from experience living in the 85 building) and is also close to grocery stores. Only negative thing I can think of is some people would get unnecessarily loud during the late hours on Fridays and the weekends but other than that, I enjoyed my time living there.",

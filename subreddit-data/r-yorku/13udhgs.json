    "postText": "the fall 2023 application is still open for Pol Sci @ york\n\nI am a Pol Sci student at a top uni in Pakistan. We are planning to move to Canada. I have a CGPA of around 2.5 and just finished my second year. My grades for Pol courses are good and my high school grades are great too. My gpa dipped because of Economics courses I took due to societal pressure since in Pakistan the perception is besides commerce, econ, med, and eng, everything is useless.   \n\n\nCan you guys chance me please and let me know if I should be applying for the coming fall semester (my poor gpa plus me being a late applicant will look bad, no?) \n\nAlso, does York accept spring transfer applicants?   \n\n\nMany thanks!",

Is a January admission possible though for transfer applicants since ryerson doesn't do it apparently.\n\nAlso the site says minimum cgpa is 2.3 so is there somewhat of a decent chance for me given I have B+s in major courses and a shitton of extracurriculars such as being a sr member in the squash team and many debates that can carry over directly to york?\n\nIm literally looking for hope at this point since were moving and i really do not want to start uni over again (im turning 22 next month) or stay here for another 2 years after my family has moved\n\nThanks",

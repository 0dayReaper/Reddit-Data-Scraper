I want to pursue educational studies as my major and psychology as my minor.  \n\nHow does this work and what should be my next steps? Do I accept my educational studies offer and then make psych my official minor after first year?  More info would be much appreciated!",

I remember reading about it being required for a psyc major, so I am curious if its for a minor as well. I am interested in doing a minor and currently planning to take more psyc course this year (my 2nd year) and if I do well apply for a minor to confirm it for 3rd year but I am a little confused on the research requirement.",

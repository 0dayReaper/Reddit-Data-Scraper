    "postText": "Hey all, looking for someone to study together at school in summer and keep each other accountable (in a comfortable way for both). I plan to study some digital marketing stuff. I am super down to earth and open minded, it's totally judgement free. Open to make friends as well, I  am a huge foodie who has broad interests such as fashion, reading, and travel. I am really into Japanese and Korean culture as well.\n\nHit me up if you are interested. Free snacks and drinks as well :)",

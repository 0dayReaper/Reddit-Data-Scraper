What can I expect as a first year if I (hopefully) get admitted? Any advice you would tell your younger self when you first came to York?",

For example, you could choose to be a hard worker and aim for amazing grades, or you could do the bare minimum just to pass. You could make friends with people in your classes, network with TAs and profs, and those you meet at orientation, or just commute to lecture and head home, not saying a word to anyone. You could join clubs, or just rely on meeting people organically. \n\nA full course load is a lot, so expect to treat school like a full time job, but at the same time, reserve time to relax, have a balanced schedule with extracurriculars, social time, and focus on self care (eating, sleeping properly, drinking water)",

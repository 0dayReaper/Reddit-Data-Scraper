    "postText": "So according to YorkU's website, they are still letting international students apply.   \n\n\nWe are Canadian/Pakistani nationals living in Pakistan. We have suddenly decided to move to Canada and the issue here is getting into Uni for my brother and I. \n\nI am a sophomore in a Pakistani university. I know quite a few people that transferred from here to a Ont Uni so I believe credits can be transferred.   \n\n\nMy GPA is around 2.5 due to a couple of Ds in Math and Econ courses, my grades for my major and potential major in Canada (politics) are fairly good.   \n\n\nHere are a few questions:  \n\n\n1) Since the site says 'Accepting Applications' for out of Ontario and Int. Students, are my brother and I eligible (given we will be residents of ON once we move and we are nationals)?   \n\n\n2) What is the process for applying for a transfer, do I apply as an Undergrad first and wait for my admission?   \n\n\n3) How negatively will my poor GPA affect my chances of getting in?   \n\n\n4) Are winter intakes a thing at York and if yes, is it better to apply for those after getting my GPA up during a summer semester in Pakistan?  \n\n\nThanks!",

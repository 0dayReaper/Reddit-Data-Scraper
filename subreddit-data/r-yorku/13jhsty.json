It feels weird when I see people my age graduating from their masters or working while I'm in uni still trying to graduate with my degree.",

Learning is a lifelong process and there is no right time or blueprint to follow. Take the time to appreciate the steps you are taking as it goes fast, next thing you know you will be on your journey in life. Comparing yourself to others (mind you we are all guilty of this at one time or another) never allows you to take a moment to appreciate your hard work and success. We are all on our own individual journeys, no right and no wrong. Hang in there, be kind to yourself and know you are not alone in your feels. You do you.",

You\u2019re in uni for a handful of years and then you work until you retire or die, so what\u2019s the rush? Plus, age is irrelevant once you\u2019re in the workforce. Getting a degree is a big deal (only 1 in 3 Canadians have one) and it\u2019s what sets up the rest of your life. I wouldn\u2019t rush that",

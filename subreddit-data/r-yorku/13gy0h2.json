Like are you guys staying in Laps and just doing your mandatory classes in the environmental studies major or changing majors to the environmental studies major? This is so stressful as now it makes it more confusing during course selection.",

But, they might have a list if you switch that you'd be exempt from certain requirements. \n\n\n\nIf you stay, they'll give you a list of courses that substitutes the requirements that no longer exist. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen geography/environmental studies merged a few years ago, they had lists of requirements that changed and the modified new substitutions for old/new programs. \n\n\n\nNormally with program closure or major modification they have wording to say students will not be disadvantaged, which provides leeway for program requirements by the faculty. \n\n\nFor the few students who became inadvertently disadvantaged by the geog/envs merger they made appropriate accommodations, so I'm pretty sure the same will happen with you guys.  \n\n\nSo the best advice is to ask when more information is coming and speaking with an advisor.",

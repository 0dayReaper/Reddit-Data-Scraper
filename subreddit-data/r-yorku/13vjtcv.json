    "postText": "So I'm a dance student and I recieved an email saying that my course enrollment appointment is on 25th May 12 pm. I had also recieved an email from my department AMPD stating that I'll receive an enrollment package with a success checklist, etc closer to my enrollment appointment.\n\nThe thing is when I logged onto my myfile, nothing really happened? Like there was no way of contacting someone or a link or anything which could help me enroll in my courses. I also haven't received any aforementioned emails and when I try to enroll by clicking on the registration and enrollment link it doesn't let me and shows an error message. \n\nI'm really confused as to what I should do as I have sent various emails to all my department, iadvisor and intleq and none of them have answered me. I also tried calling the registrar's office a few times but nobody picks up and it just has a few pre recorded facts about york lol\n\nI have no idea what I should do and if anyone is facing the same problem as me, please do let me know because what the hell",

You can book an appointment with an AMPD academic advisor through this form. I forgot how it worked for first years, but in general, you can schedule your course schedule through Visual Schedule builder, copy course codes from there and paste them in York REM service to enrol the classes you selected [visual schedule builder/REM](https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/guide/vsb)",

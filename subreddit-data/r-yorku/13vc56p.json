I have an average of 93 and mt friends with averages of 95,94,90 of all got the same messages.I\u2019m very confused if that means it\u2019s a rejection or just a \u201cno\u201d at this time but they wait until later to see you\u2019re marks and if there is space for you to fill in. I don\u2019t know if they are trying to sugarcoat it but I\u2019m honestly pretty said because I worked hard for that 93 but people with 88\u2019s got in :(\n\n\nMAY 30 update: York just emailed me and said that \u201cyou are not eligible at this time\u201d does not mean a full rejection and they said to keep a heads up for the next 2 weeks and myfile should be updated.",

Publicly funded universities in Ontario are expected to make efforts to retain students in order to get funding.  Students who enter university with inflated grades and then face the unpleasant reality that they aren't doing well are more likely to quit their programs.  \n\nSo, that's two very good reasons to take into account an applicant's high school and how much they tend to inflate grades.\n\nEvery university is very secretive about how they make decisions about admission.  U of Waterloo's adjustment factor is only known about because of leaks on social media and   Ontario\u2019s Information and Privacy Commissioner ordering the info to be released to a journalist.  We don't know for sure if other universities do this, but we can't rule it out.\n\nThe reason I posted about it here is that it would give at least some explanation of why a student with a 93% high school average couldn't get into this program.",

Plus as the other guy said, you get scholarships, some even automatic, for doing exceptionally well. Every dollar counts these days.\n\nTrue, in CS most companies don't even look at your transcript; they weed out students on the leetcode instead. But good luck seeking further education in CS/eng at any halfway decent place without at least a B+ average.",

I sent them my Korean language certificates, Princeton MUN, etc, and then in an hour I saw that a decision had been made and I was accepted to both programs that I had applied to (unconditional offer). My point is that even though you have a 98 or an A+, I did too, these extra curriculars really set you apart, because attaining good grades is not impossible, but showing proof of something apart from academic success is everything! Good luck for your next steps, though! If you can get some extra curriculars in, I\u2019m certain you can get an offer because York is a very student initiative and image conscious school :)",

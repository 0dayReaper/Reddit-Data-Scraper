I\u2019d suggest calling early in the morning right when the office opens. \n\nYou can also email rscheck@yorku.ca\n\nYou can also use the QLess app to join the line. They used to do virtual calls on Zoom too but I think they\u2019re back to in-person now. If you\u2019re ever on campus, you can use the app to join the line and it\u2019ll tell you how many people are in front of you, wait time and when it\u2019s your turn.",

I'm in the 2nd entry nursing program rn and I haven't had any major issues besides some disorganization and questionable profs (common no matter the program). I have a placement at the hospital this semester as well so you'll be able to get experience. Last semester they couldn't find any but that's cause they were still kinda worried about COVID but now things have chilled out a bit",

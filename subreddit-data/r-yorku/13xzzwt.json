    "postText": "Hi, YorkU and the **staffs at Transportation Services of YorkU**!\n\nI just had the most amazing experience during the Congress event at York University today (1 June 2023), and I simply had to give a huge shoutout to an amazing driver I encountered. This person went above and beyond to make my time at YorkU extra special, and they definitely deserve some rise and recognition!\n\nSo, what happen, today, ***I hopped on the shuttle bus at Bergeron Building around 2 PM.*** And the driver was a white lady with dark brown hair, wearing polarized sunglasses, and a slick black YorkU branded baseball cap, and square or triangle-shaped earrings.\n\n***After enjoying the campus ride, I hopped off at Pond Residence Stop around 2:30 PM.*** I was curious about the Golf cart shuttle frequency, so I asked the driver, about that, and she said, it comes around every 15 minutes. Then, she drove off in the shuttle bus, and I thought that was that.\n\nBut hold up, ***at 2:45 PM at the same spot***, and guess who shows up? Yep, you guessed it, ***that same driver, this time in a golf cart***. Turns out **she changed her shift** and was **cruising around on Golf-cart Route 2,** covering the southern part of the campus.\n\nDuring the ride, we chatted about YorkU campus shuttle service to the coolest buildings and landmarks while covering both ***Golf-cart Route 1 &amp; 2!*** **She even showed me some hidden gems I hadn't discovered before. It was like having my own personal tour, and I was Surprised!**\n\nNow here's **where it gets wild**. Towards the end of our epic tour, as we were heading back, I spotted **one of my department profs near Schulich School of Business Building**, and I waved her. But the golf cart was already driving by. But guess what? Our driver heard prof's voice and stopped. I told her, \"That's my department prof!\" And guess what she did? **She turned the golf cart around and went back to where my prof was.** And **she let me to chat with the prof briefly**!\n\nI can't even think about, this driver's awesomeness. **She not only made sure I had the best tour ever, covering both Golf-cart Route 1 and Golf-cart Route 2, but she also let me a quick chat with my department prof.**\n\n***When we finally arrived back at Pond Residence around 3 PM,*** I couldn't help but thank her with a lot gratitude. I thanked her for being an absolute staff, for her professionalism, and for making my tour one for the books.\n\n**To the Transportation Services at York University, you need to know about this incredible driver and their outstanding performance. Let's give them a huge round of applause! They made my time at YorkU unforgettable, and I'm sure they're doing the same for others.**\n\nSo, let's all give a virtual standing ovation \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f to this incredible driver for their remarkable service and for making our time at York University even more amazing, especially right before my convocation day, as I am graduating this winter semester! Thank you!",

And GoSafe sometimes does that service for special events.\n\nbased on that, I did made a post about that idea some months ago, using golf carts as public transport throughout the campus, yet lots of commenters here didn't like the idea :(",

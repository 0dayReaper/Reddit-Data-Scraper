            "comment": "Dr. Vorstermans is a super great and accessible prof. The class is straightforward and pretty easy imo. Workload shouldn\u2019t be bad but you should pace yourself accordingly. I got a good mark in the class with time management and reading the instructions properly for assignments. There\u2019s only assignments and no tests. I forgot what each assignment is worth but I believe there\u2019s around 6-ish things that get graded, with four of them being part of a big capstone project that you complete in four different parts",

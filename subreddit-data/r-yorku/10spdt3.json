When they are anything *but* white, then descriptions will go out of their way to hee and haw around the topic until it is impossible to do so.\n\nMedia reports rarely indicate race because minorities represent the (statistic) majority of these crimes. That is not to say that X race is bad or anything before you go jumping down my throat; this is the consequence of a number of complex issues. We can discuss the complex issues that *result* in those individuals committing a disproportionate number of crimes at a different time, and that is a ***very*** important discussion to have.\n\n**But purposefully censoring descriptions of someone with a fucking gun when they are of a certain race because you don't want racists to be racist is ridiculous and dangerous.**\n\nRacists will be racist regardless. If anything, by purposefully censoring the race when providing descriptions we're only giving racists the opportunity to say \"SeE I toLd YoU!!!1! ThErE's A ConSpirAcY aGaiNst thE WhIteS!!\"",

And since the media is now moving away from racial descriptors of suspects these days,  this for you is proof that all of these suspects  are non white? We would  actually need to review the final arrest/conviction  data to know this.  But some people already know the results apparently.\n\nNow could there be another reason for the media/Police\u2019s actions regarding the description?  If we lived in a world where black people were not all viewed as criminals by so many people who are \u2018not racists\u2019, we may actually do a better assessment of this issue than we are seeing here. \n\nLet\u2019s imagine that in this case the suspect is in fact black and this race  descriptor is added to the suspect\u2019s description.\n\nNow What do you plan to do, call the police on every tall black male with short black hair wearing a winter jacket? Or maybe this provides you justification to continue viewing and treating every black male as a criminal? \n\nCould it be that the media is trying to balance people\u2019s need for assurance that the cops know something, yet trying to minimize further criminalization/victimization of  the multitudes of innocent,  short haired, winter jacket wearing black males, which far outnumber the ones with guns. \n\nI think a real debate could take place about whether or not the current description -  even with a race descriptor added - is useful.  But instead here are the usual suspects lamenting the discrimination  faced by white suspects and demanding that Black suspects should not get special treatment ( the Justice system has always given black people \u2018special treatment\u2019). But as you say, \u2018Racists  will be Racists\u2019.",

                                                    "comment": "&gt;Now could there be another reason for the media/Police\u2019s actions regarding the description? If we lived in a world where black people were not all viewed as criminals by so many people who are \u2018not racists\u2019, we may actually do a better assessment of this issue than we are seeing here.\n\nThis falls under the \"complex issues that definitely require discussion\" that I referred to. These are serious problems that need to be addressed (public perceptions of black people), but deliberately censoring the race of **a guy with a fucking gun** because of those issues is blatantly dangerous and counter productive. \n\n&gt;Now What do you plan to do, call the police on every tall black male with short black hair wearing a winter jacket? Or maybe this provides you justification to continue viewing and treating every black male as a criminal? Could it be that the media is trying to balance people\u2019s need for assurance that the cops know something, yet trying to minimize further criminalization/victimization of law abiding black males going about their business in the world?\n\nNot at all, but purposefully leaving out the race of - again - **a guy with a fucking gun** is also incredibly dangerous. I'm not saying there aren't negative ramifications that are consequence of complex social issues, I'm just saying that it is ***much*** more dangerous to deliberately leave out identifying descriptors for - again - **a guy with a fucking gun** just because these complex issues exist. \n\nAnd, like I said, all deliberately censoring the race of a suspect does is provide ammo to racists - who will be racist regardless - to point out how they only list race when it's a white perpetrator.",

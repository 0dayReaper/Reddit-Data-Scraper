    "postText": "Hello, I am currently enrolled in a Computer Science degree at Carleton University and I want to apply to transfer to the Digital Technologies program at York. The application is still open on OUAC (I'm using 105 application to transfer) but it says on the website the deadline is January 12th. Does anyone know if it is still worth it to apply or if I'll even be considered? Any information is appreciated. Thank you.",

    "postText": "I've put in a request to change my major for my second year but I need to apply for OSAP. When I'm applying, do I put the major I'm currently in or the major I'm planning on going into? Also, I put in the request in March and still haven't seen any changes, is it normal for it to take this long? Thanks for the help!",

One will be closed when the office does confirmation of enrolment. \n\nOption 2: You can apply for the future application, and if it doesn't work out the office will correct when we do confirmation of enrolment.",

            "comment": "Online courses require a lot of self-discipline to keep on top of lectures, and it's so easy to get distracted since the atmosphere isn't conducive to learning. Also, cheating is so rampant that the tests either get designed super weirdly or you can even get curved down. There has only been one online course that has ever properly engaged me out of the several I've been forced to take during the pandemic.\n\nHowever, it is more convenient - provided you aren't already on campus, in which case it's actually *less* convenient.",

            "comment": "This is really dependent on a few factors but the main 3 imo are. \n\n1. The type of course\n2. Your own work ethic\n3. Where you live\n\nThe type of course matters imo and I will use my own experience to explain why. I had classes for teacher's college at York and it was very heavily group work and class discussion based. If your class is online, most students will not be attentive. When classes were online during covid, there were straight up students who were not present for discussions and were hard to get a hold of for assignments. HOWEVER, for my English classes, online was fine because the prof would just discuss the book and teach us whatever they needed to teach us and the students would just answer the questions asked or share their own insights to the class. It was more of an independent class that mostly required listening and self critical-thinking. \n\nYour work ethic is important because if you are the type to slack off, who is to say you will be attentive for an online class? If you are an independent learner and you don't get distracted easily, online might be a lot easier for you. \n\nHow far do you live from campus? Is it a pain to get to school for a class that might be only 1 hour?",

Had a fully online course and I didn\u2019t watch one lecture video. If it was in person, I would\u2019ve been more engaged. I forgot i even had an online lecture multiple times throughout last semester lmao",

            "comment": "I studied English, History, and Education, at YorkU.\n\nMy experience was that there was little-to-no difference between in-person and online.\n\nNothing done in-person required it to be so. Everything done in-person could have easily been done online.\n\nWhile there is a nice social element to in-person, it is highly dependent on the specific course and group you get.\n\nThe amount of time and money saved via online courses is also fantastic.\n\nPlus, at least for Education, online courses saved my sanity as many are filler courses. Being in-person for some was kinda depressing \u2014 the course itself felt like a waste of time and money, so spending the extra time to commute and be in-person was even more depressing.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm currently on going into my second-year Kinesiology and Health Sciences (BSc) this fall and I'm looking for notes from anyone who has completed their second year in this program. If you have any notes, lecture slides, or study guides, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share them. Getting a head start on the upcoming courses would be really helpful. Please comment or send a private message if you can assist. Thank you!",

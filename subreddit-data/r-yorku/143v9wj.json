    "postText": "So I was a very small difference away from meeting the minimum grade in order to *not* be required to withdraw. Today I received an email saying that I was forced to withdraw for not meeting the minimum GPA. I had my own personal issues during my first year and I screwed up big time but I was going to retake the courses I messed up in my second year and (in turn) going to fix my GPA. I'm currently enrolled for two summer courses since I didn't expect this to end up happening. I know for a fact that with these two summer courses it will get me past the minimum grade I need, but I'm not sure if it's too late. If my GPA is over the minimum by the end of S1, will I still be not able to take any courses for the upcoming Fall/Winter semesters? Thanks",

            "comment": "This is what I found on the faculty of liberal arts and professional studies website: \n\nIf you have been informed that you are required to withdraw or that you have been debarred and have extenuating circumstances, you may petition have waive these decisions and continue your studies uninterrupted. Find out more below on waiving a required withdrawal or debarment decision.\n\n1. If your average has fallen substantially (overall GPA below 2.50, on 24 or more credits) or if you have not been able to reach the minimum standing required by a previously-issued academic or debarment warning, you may be required to withdraw from studies for one year, or debarred from studies for two years. These are academic penalties, a consequence of poor grades that put you at risk of failing to qualify for a degree. If you believe that you should be allowed to continue your studies without interruption, then you may petition to have your required withdrawal or debarment waived. If the petition is granted, you will return to your studies on debarment warning.",

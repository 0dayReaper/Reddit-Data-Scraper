            "comment": "You have to convert each individual grade to 4.0 scale, there is no accurate way to convert your overall GPA directly from 9.0 scale to 4.0 scale. This is because the worth of grades in the two scales are different.\n\nLets say you got a B+, an A, and an A+ in three courses that are worth the same credits. According to 9.0 scale, you would have 7 + 8 + 9 = 24 / 3 = 8.00 GPA (which may make you think you have a 3.8 from the 4.0 GPA as 8.00 is an A). However, your GPA would be 3.3 + 3.8 + 4.0 = 11.1 / 3 = 3.7 from the 4.0 GPA scale as worth of each grade is different. Hope that makes sense.\n\nBtw, whatsmygpa is a good program to use.",

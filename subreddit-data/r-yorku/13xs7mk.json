But it only has 3 essays for the entire year so it\u2019s super chill. He marks generously and you can write your papers on literally anything you want. Pretty easy A if you put a slight ounce of effort\n\nSOSC 1801 \nSOSC 2110\n\nSOWK 2025 \nSOWK 2020\n\nSociology of Migration with Shirin Shahrokni. I forgot the course code but she is an amazing, intelligent and kind prof and you\u2019d love it even if you\u2019ve never taken a sociology or migration course.",

They\u2019re both taught by the same prof and I don\u2019t think there are prerequisites for that. The content of it is fairly similar but I\u2019d recommend taking the 3515 first to see how you like the course and then you can take the 4003 the year after just so you\u2019re more familiar with the content. In general, you don\u2019t actually need to know his content entirely anyways, it\u2019s hard and he knows that and doesn\u2019t expect you to fully understand. \n\nThe papers usually asks you to pick a movie or book you like and then try to connect some of the stuff you\u2019ve learnt from course content and see how you can relate it back to the plot or characters in the book/movie you chose. So it\u2019s actually pretty fun. Just make sure you\u2019re taking with Dr.Jay",

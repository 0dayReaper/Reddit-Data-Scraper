    "postText": "1st year student and completed enrollment tutorial and checklist but the instructions say I will see an \"ENROLL NOW\" button... are these just old instructions and I simply need to wait until timeslot cuz I don't see the button \n\nAlso, the error messages says i need to complete the tutorial but it has been. I would assume that the attached error message is incorrect and it should simply  say that my time slot is not avail/open yet?  Or did I truly miss something on the tutorial? \n\nNote: dashboard says i do not need an advisory appointment",

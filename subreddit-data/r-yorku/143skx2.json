I can't find the email that brought me to the link to RSVP anymore however I know I did it at the beginning of last month because that's when you get the tickets and pay for the robe rental. \n\nIf you are attending the Faculty of Ed convocation for Summer, I would highly suggest you call right away since the ceremony is next week. \n\nBest of luck.",

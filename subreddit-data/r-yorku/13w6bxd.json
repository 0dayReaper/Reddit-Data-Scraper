    "postText": "I applied for CS, Business Economics and IT, and Only Made it to IT and BE, declined BE, will go for IT. my average is about an 81-83% from what I know. I was wondering how possible and likely it is for me to make the switch, and what does the process look like? I want to pursue Blockchain Development and Cybersecurity and possible Data/cloud analysis. for initial entry the requirements were:\n\n* **Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD)**\n* **ENG4U**\n* **SCH4U** or **SPH4U**\n* **MHF4U**\n* **4U math (MCV4U recommended)**\n* And **two additional 4U or M courses**\n\n**I** got ENG4U, MCV4U, TGJ4M, HRE4M, BAT4M, HZT4U.\n\nNow I heard that it is possible to get into Majors that you don't qualify for if you are already admitted into the University, I would like to know how true this is, because I really want to do CS. Wilfred accepted me into core sciences but idk what the heck that is and no one wants to respond on the phone so I dont want to take my chances and only have 1 day left until June 1st (end date to accept offer) but I did hear that core sciences can lead to CS.  \nPlease good people try to explain to my peanut brain how all this works.",

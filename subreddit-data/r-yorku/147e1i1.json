But there is a chance that you won\u2019t get into all of your req. classes and have to take them later in the year in another sem or summer school. Ask your teacher or talk with your guidance councillor and they probs would let you skip class for this",

You got 2 days before it, search visual schedule builder and find the courses you need. https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/academic-calendar#/programs/HyRmJjLnP/none?searchTerm=Kin&amp;bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Kinesiology%20%26%20Health%20Science&amp;bcItemType=programs use this website to see what your requirements are for your program. If you\u2019re in The arts click the first one, if you\u2019re in science degree click the 7th. The classes that start with 1 are first year, and you need pkins too (idk too much bout kin bc I\u2019m biomed but I have kin friends \ud83d\udc80). Put the courses on that website one by one into the visual schedule builder and it would give you timings. Mess around and create your schedule with your electives too! Than in a box on the bottom right, there should be numbers called CAT, copy them and save it aside. When you enroll into REM on June 14, paste the codes one by one and you\u2019ll be in the classes you got in.",

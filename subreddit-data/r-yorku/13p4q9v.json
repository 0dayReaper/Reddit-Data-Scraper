    "postText": "So I am taking one course for S1 and one for S2 which makes me part time. I added another course that opened up for S2 which means I am taking 9 credits credits in total for the summer which makes me full time. I had already received the funding ($2300) which actually covers all 3 of the courses. But since I would be considered full time, I read that if you didn\u2019t receive osap or wasn\u2019t enrolled in the 2022-2023 school year which was my case, it makes me ineligible to receive full time osap. What should I do? I was thinking my options were to just drop the new course I added after receiving the funding so it doesn\u2019t mess up my osap, or just leave it since it technically was already giving me that amount and just so happens to also cover the additional course (probably not the right way to go about it). I could email letting them know I added another course but it would make me full time and ineligible to receive funding.\n\nTLDR: received osap but added another course afterwards making me full time and not part time, amount received covers all 3 courses, also ineligible to receive full time summer osap due to not being enrolled in 2022-2023 academic year.",

If your term length were 11 weeks or less, you'd indeed be forbidden from claiming OSAP.  But I think your term length is 12 weeks or more.  Therefore, I think you're fully eligible for OSAP and in retrospect should have submitted a full-time OSAP application.\n\nHindsight is 20/20.  Even if you should have submitted a full-time OSAP application, you didn't, because you didn't know you'd end up being a full-time summer student.  Similar to what /u/Always_Scheming suggested, you can ask the York financial aid office what to do now.",

So now I could just get them to reassess it for full time and I\u2019ll still get the funding",

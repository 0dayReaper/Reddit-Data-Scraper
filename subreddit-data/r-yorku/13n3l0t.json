NSERC is still available to everyone.\n\n\n\n&gt;That means the opportunity for this particular scientific recognition and academic commendation by 3 significant government agencies is being denied to some people on the basis of race.\n\nI would call the NSERC equivalent.

                            "comment": "In my experience all three Canadian universities I attended had scholarships and bursaries specific to many groups.\n\nThe scholarships and awards by the university itself were for anyone and based on major, GPA, research. So most schools award scholarships immediately for high GPA in high school. Those don't take anything but academics into account. \n\nThe other scholarships and bursaries are privately donated. Many are trusts established by wealthy folks or non profits or communities to continue in perpetuity under specific conditions to be awarded. So you may see something like \"The Jane Smith achievement award\" and it will specify to qualify you need a GPA of 3.0, have to be a single mother, and an immigrant. Many are created to honor a person who died, a memorial scholarship. So if Hank Hill was a veteran and an amputee who studied at the school and later became wealth and died, maybe his estate created a trust for a scholarship every year that goes to a young man who is a disabled veteran. \n\nThere were literally thousands of awards and bursaries listed on the schools scholarship/awards pages. It would take me ages to find the ones I qualified for every year. \n\nThere's some awards that are so specific they sometimes get no applicants. We had a local Portuguese community non profit that gave out a $500 bursary every year to a member of the Portuguese community. Or you'd see a business give an award every year to a student over 40 studying business. There was an award that wasn't even GPA based that was $2000 to a student majoring in religious studies who was over 30. But the major had less than 10 students in it and non even qualified, so it just didn't get awarded often. \n\nThere are awards just for Asian students, east Indian, disabled folks, BIPOC, single parents, widows, veterans, everything. \n\nNone are discrimination and pretty much every student can find awards that apply to them. \n\nIt's an odd system but people who have money and businessesove creating scholarships and financial awards for students and there's so many to apply to discrimination isn't a worry.\n\nAlso worth noting that when people create super specific scholarships and awards and the parameters cannot be met ever, the money just sits there. At Dalhousie there were scholarships established privately so specific for majors and programs that no longer existed. The money just hangs around forever essentially.",

You can't oppress and hold an entire ethnicity of people back for a couple hundred years, declare them equal, and have them be fine. White people still owned all the best land, had established businesses, and made all the laws. (And, really, segregation was *only* repealed 59 years ago. That's not very long.)\n\nIt's the difference between **equality** and **equity**. \n\nThink of it like a marathon relay. All the teams started at the same time, but one team had shoes made of cement. Even if after the first couple rounds, they were allowed to switch to normal sneakers, they're not going to catch up and keep pace.   \nIt doesn't mean the other teams aren't running their hardest or are slacking, just that they're not being penalized for what came before/ \n\nThis is where \"white privilege\" comes from. When you have generations of inherited wealth allowing people to have homes, better educations, and better jobs you're going to have kids that are better off. If your grandparents didn't have to work two jobs and owned their own home your parents are just going to grow up more well rounded, allowing you more opportunities. \n\nTo actually be fair, you need to offset the disadvantages. You need to give other groups a boost to achieve equity.   \nIt's like giving someone a handicap in golf. Things are unequal going in and life isn't fair, so you have to artificially **make** things fair in the hopes that one day, they will be needed.",

Historically scholarships were funded by community members of a particular group to advance the next generation. That's why a lot of the older institutions like u of t and McGill were actually Christian colleges because they church paid the first bills. Then government took over and expanded enrolment. Now communities are free to fund their own children to attend those same universities.",

This alone means that Asians will be far more successful because they have a ton of resources available to them (prior education, family wealth, connections) that someone who is Black tends not to have. The overwhelming majority of Asian immigrants need no help.\n\nThis is where the model minority myth comes from. Of course if all you get is the top 20% of that ethnic group, they will look good. Back in China, you have tons of poor uneducated folks who do manual labour or just subsistence farming. You just never see any of them in North America. They simply are unable to even make it here.",

So historically we see many minority groups undergoing very difficult circumstances, even being slaughtered. Disabled people have challenges everyday in our society that gives advantages to those with abilities.. Why don't Asians or Japanese, or disabled people get special guaranteed NSERCs as forgiveness for minimal restitution? Why don't Indian or Persian immigrants who sacrificed everything and worked two jobs while being in uni get these guaranteed NSERCs? This is racism if you think about it. Awards should not be awarded to anyone based on race alone! This is simply Biology, skin color (skin pigmentation) should not have anything to do with these sorts of decisions",

Also, if you believe not enough is being done as restitution or support for different people, then you need to advocate for that. Black people in Canada were offered restitution because of the civil rights movement in the US as well as the literal blood, time, and effort of endless advocates. You basically saying fuck everyone else we should all wallow in misery. Grants aren't being given because of the kindness of the heart of the government or because black people are somehow cheating the system. Don't spout instances of unresolved oppression as proof that we shouldn't give some people who were oppressed a fighting chance. All or nothing approaches are very bad faith and indicate you have an ulterior narrative or a passive racist outlook towards a certain group.",

I am sure that if there was a bursary that was only aimed at OP's race/culture, they would be rushing to apply to it and wouldn't think about making this post about how it is is racist.  However, because they see a bursary targeting a different race/culture, they choose to get triggered. this mindset is even worse when OP is from a minority that is marginalizrd and should realise that the bursary that they are referencing is aiming to help another marginalized minority. \n\nOP, you should be cheering such bursaries on, not calling them out to be racist. Educate yourself on the history that negatively impacted such races/cultures from attending post-secondary students and you will quickly understand why such bursaries are necessary.",

The dictionary definition of racism has been politicized ever since the 2016 elections and been changed to fit \"whats in\". It used to be simply discrimination of a racial nature but now it involves power dynamics and historical oppressor/victim context.  \n\n\nWhether you use the current definition or not, racial discrimination is still a very real thing that happens on both sides. Things like affirmative action (like this bursary) is basically racial discrimination with good intentions.   \n\n\nRacism happens quite a bit in minority groups too. Just looking at asian-black relations you can see a long history of violence and racism between both groups. The middle east is a whole other story as well with deeply rooted historical feuds between each other.",

If you switched the word black to white you would cry racism. Therefore, the original is discrimination. It is simple. Sorry, being a minority in a country does not automatically make you less privileged. Assuming that just because I am against discrimination based on the colour of someone's skin regardless of minority group means that I am privileged is pretty ridiculous.",

Schools can't discriminate who they teach or don't. They charge everyone the same. Also, if we are talking about financial reasons, there are plenty of international students who need that money, more than a native-born black canadian.\n\nAlso regarding this specific busary, as I understand it is a research grant. I don't really care if the school gives a scholarship grant exclusively for black people. However, since this is a grant for research, i believe it should be merit-based.",

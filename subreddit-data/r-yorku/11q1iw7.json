I'm simply implying that because some women happened to get hired is not proof of anything dirty going on. These things happen. It doesn't mean anything malicious or nasty is going on. More likely, they had a ton of applicants and these were the best options that pitched their resumes forward given the limited slots available to fill at the time (this could have been a multi-year effort with only one or two hired in a year, for example.)\n\nIf that turns out *not* to be the case, then absolutely, something should be done to ensure fair practice in hiring. We, as bystanders, do not get to make assumptions based on our own worst impulses and insinuate that we are accurate without evidence.",

They had plenty of good candidates, one woman replaced a white dude with crazy designations. \n\nAnother woman replaced a POC lady who was also great. \nThey specifically dropped the requirement so these women do their actual job less, but instead get social points on appearing on the many diversity and women in leadership panels around the full Corporate Toronto circuit.\n\nEDIT: I must mention that my wife is in leadership, and my grandmother was a huge advocate for feminist rights back in her day. \n\nMy argument is merit, and getting hired to gain social points.

The fact that we would see it as so audacious that this would be possible for women to do shows how completely and utterly women have historically been excluded from power. \n\nWomen aren\u2019t asking for all the power, only equal opportunity to power. \n\nSo when you point out one of the VAST minority examples of women being in a majority power position, and HYUK HYUK yourself about it being \u201cunequal\u201d, and then point fingers and say \u201cthat\u2019s what pushes centrists away from good ideas and generates right wing backlash\u201d, I just have to say\u2026\n\nHello, hi.

If most jobs in a country are male-dominated, then giving jobs to a majority of women at a single institution does, in fact, lead toward balancing the scales. But it isn't even about that. Equality just means equality of opportunity. Women have an equal opportunity to get those positions. If a majority of them happen to do so, it was based on merit. Further, companies and universities are trying to ensure that they *also* hire women, not *only* hire them. At the end of the day, this isn't going to affect you, most jobs are still male-dominated, and your post feeds into anti-feminist and anti-women rhetoric. It's the same as the ridiculous \"reverse racism\" argument. Take a moment to think before you post. Have a nice day.",

Also there is probably a correlated statistic about who actually votes and the demographic of individuals of yorku. And finally and most importantly of all is that a lot of the women VP and presidents advocate for things like free women hygiene products in washrooms and the like, which makes them very appealing to female students who go out of their way and vote. Men aren't oppressed lil bro, grow up.",

It actually makes sense that more women would have education leadership positions. Honestly the fact that we have 20% men is a huge accomplishment for our gender. We're finally getting up there.

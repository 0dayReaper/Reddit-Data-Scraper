If you applied in Feb, chances are you'll be able to get into Pond, or at the very least one of the other residences. Unless you have outstanding debt or you've been reported for bad behavior, I don't see any reason not to let you in.   \nIf it makes you feel any better, I applied for residence in early March so right after you and I haven't gotten an offer yet.",

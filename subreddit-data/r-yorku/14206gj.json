Let\u2019s just say for my second year I\u2019m going to try to time my classes from 10-4pm. too early isn\u2019t good and anytime after 5 can be a killer to get home in traffic. But I also managed to have all my classes in 3 days. 2 full days and one day just one class. It really was great because I managed to valence work plus this made my gas expense cheaper due to not having to go more days to campus",

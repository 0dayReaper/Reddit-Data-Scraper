            "comment": "not sure why some commenters here are giving stupid answers.\n\nFirst of all, are you looking at a fancy or powerful car? this will inflate your insurance quote. A little hatchback will be a lot cheaper than a Mercedes or a sports car.\n\nSecondly, see if you can bundle your insurance with a family member and put yourself as a second driver. Young or new drivers are considered high risk so it may be cheaper to put yourself as a second/temporary driver on the car. \n\nThirdly, your location makes a big difference, all of GTA is expensive but some cities are higher Brampton, Vaughan are top two i believe.\n\nAnother factor is age. If you are younger (just under/over 20 years old) then you are high risk since you don't have much experience, and are also more likely to be reckless whilst driving. \n\nTo get the lowest rate possible, you need to do the drivers training course, get a cheap used economy car for cash so you can get liability only insurance, and list yourself as a secondary driver by bundling insurance with a family member. \n\nWhen I got my G2 at 17, i did the course, got a Toyota Matrix, and put a family member as the main driver and myself as a second driver. By doing this, I was paying about $300 per month to have my family member and I insured on it. It would have been about $450 without the course or secondary driver. I currently pay \\~180 a month after driving for 6 years with no tickets/accidents. \n\nYou may get some suggestions that are not legal, such as putting your address as the middle of butt-fuck nowhere to get lower rates. I would recommend against this or any other non-legal ways to lower your insurance quote.",

Technically, they are paying more money overall to offset your cheaper insurance. \n\nNo one I knew wanted to pay insurance on another vehicle they wouldn't be driving (wasting their money) so I just did it for myself.\n\nNow, paying to be a secondary driver on a family members car will build up history, leading to cheaper insurance sooner! I definitely recommend doing that.\n\nPlus a cheap beater? May not be classy but you'll be mobile at least",

It varies from person to person.\n\nWhen I got my G2 and put a family member as a primary driver and myself as a secondary driver on my Toyota, I paid the insurance for both of us and it was \\~300 per month combined. My family member did not pay any of it. If I had gotten insurance by myself, I would have been paying \\~450 per month. \n\nI was paying for two people's insurance on my Toyota, yet was only paying 2/3 of what it would have costed to only insure myself on it. \n\nMy family member had insurance on their own car, with a different insurance company. They paid that insurance. \n\nThey did not pay a dime for the insurance on my car. I paid all of it and still saved money.\n\n**Disclaimer: YMMV**",

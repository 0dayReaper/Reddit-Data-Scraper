Go to college, get a diploma, then attempt to transfer (be aware that this is relatively difficult to do for CS due to the demand).\n2. \"Settle\" for a lower-ranked university than ours like Brock or Ontario Tech. At the end of the day, it's still a degree from a respectable place.\n3. Retake grade 12 and get better grades.\n4. Don't go to university at all, or do it as a mature student. You are not forced to go to university and plenty of people have very fulfilling lives and careers without it. Consider a career in the trades. CS isn't impossible to break into without a degree but it is definitely harder.\n\nI know rejection hurts, but you should know that it's not over, you can get up and try again.",

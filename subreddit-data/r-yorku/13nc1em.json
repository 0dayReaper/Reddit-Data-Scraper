    "postText": "Hi! I am a high school junior somewhere in Canada and I had a few questions about York University. If you could please take a look at them, that would be very helpful! Thank you in advance.\n\nI am interested in pursuing a career in medicine, specifically becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon (For now. I may change my mind about the type of surgeon in the future). I was told that York University is a good place to go for an undergraduate program because it's easier (to obtain high marks) relative to other Canadian Universities (I am aware that STEM is difficult, regardless of the university. But, York is relatively less difficult than the others). Is this true? \n\nAnd since it's an easier school, then I would graduate with high marks and have a better chance of getting accepted into medical school. I have high marks at the moment (above 95%) so I have a good shot at other prestigious schools in Canada like UofT or McGill. But, people have told me to choose a mediocre and easy university for undergrad so that it is less competitive. Is this true? If so, would York University be a good option? \n\nI also noticed that York offers medical-related programs, two of them being Biomedical Sciences and Kinesiology &amp; Health Sciences. What is the difference between these two programs and which one is a better option for pre-med preparation?\n\nI have heard some negative comments about York University, some being about having to wait too long to take a course, numerous strikes, etc. Are these rumours all true?\n\nLastly, do you have any advice for someone who is interested in attending York University?\n\nThank you for reading &amp; answering my questions!",

            "comment": "You want to become a cardiothoracic surgeon (which is a great goal), but want to take the \"easy\" way into medical school with York, which it is not btw. Just because you're not graded in a way that you compete for grades with your classmates, in no way is it a cakewalk. There are more than a handful of students in every class aiming for the very limited med school slots. Plus, there is no easy point in life on the path to become a surgeon. You have to become the best in your craft and the top of your class, and the 95% in high school would not translate to anything, since university is a different ball game altogether. I would suggest doing some research about schools in Canada and picking a program you like and enjoy, going through the program map and the required courses.",

I understand wanting to go to a less competitive university for medical school purposes, but OP fails to understand that they will need to be at the top of the class in medical school to get into competitive surgical specialties.\n\n80% of medical students go into family medicine. If OP tries to take the easy way into medical school, I am almost certain that they will not become a surgeon because they will likely not perform at the top of the class in medical school.\n\nOP, if you are serious about becoming a surgeon, you need to work hard and challenge yourself in undergrad or you will not make it. You will need to be at the top of your class in medical school to even have a chance of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon or any other type of surgeon.",

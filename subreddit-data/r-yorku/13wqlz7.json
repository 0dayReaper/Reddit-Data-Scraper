And just make sure you really wanna go to CS. Because I know some people at york who go transfer from IT to CS or engineering to CS and they\u2019ve regretted their transfer. You need to be passionate and make sure you are making the right choice",

You're actually better off applying from the jump/rejecting that program and reapplying \n\nThat being said, internal transfers in Lassonde, provided you have the GPA, are not as terrible. \n\nEngineering to CS is not as bad.\n\nI do agree however that you dont want to go to a program with the intent to transfer.",

            "comment": "Yes. It's actually a lot easier to transfer from Engineering to CS than the other way around. You just want to make sure youre taking EECS engineering. In other words, Software, Computer or Electrical Engineering. For the first two there are a lot of similar courses to CS. And the math courses and Physics courses should even out credit wise. There are some differences such as Engineering taked EECS 1028 version of Discrete math which is considered harder (at least to some people) than the CS Discrete math course and then both cohorts take MATH1090 afterwards.\n\nThat being said, as some have said,  going in with the intent to transfer is usually not a good idea. There may be some personal calculations you'll have to make, such as housing, costs, transportation etc. \n\nAnecdotally, I hear Laurier CS is not bad, plus housing is way cheaper in Waterloo if you were going to board at York anyway",

    "postText": "I'll be in my 6th year this fall and will be my final semester but my parents have been on my ass about why I'm taking so long to graduate. I'm taking this long bcuz I want to and I'm actually enjoying university this year. Do they have any right to comment on my graduation date when they didn't pay a dime for my education. All my mom does is compare me to other people my age or people younger than me. Like I'll wake up in the morning and the first thing she'll say is that you still haven't graduated and still haven't found a job. I'll be awake at like 2am and she'll randomly wake up and  say these things to me. Am I in the wrong here to question that do they have any right to ask me all this when they didn't pay a single dime on my tuition or she's right to  compare me to my peers and make these comments? I'm just really tired of hearing all this everyday for the past 2 years.",

If you are not living at home, then it means you are collecting student debt and paying rent. In this situation, your parents may be wondering about your living situation after university and how long it will take you to buy property.\n\nAssuming that you are in your mid-20s, your parents may be worried that you are still living at home, unmarried (if that is an expectation they have), not employed in a full-time job, and taking on a lot of student debt. I am not condoning their behaviour but from their perspective, they could have justifiable reasons for saying some of these things. They may not have paid for your university education, but if you are still living at home, then they are still supporting you. Parents are not obligated to continue to support their children after they turn 18. I know people that were told to leave home and make it on their own after high school.\n\nI think it would be more productive if you had an honest conversation with your parents about your plans. They are probably just concerned for your future right now. Imagine yourself as a parent who had a child collecting student debt for 6 years in university and still living at home or putting all their money towards rent. Would you not want to know about their graduation plans? Their approach may not be the right way to go about this, but they may nevertheless be justified in their reasons for feeling this way\u2014particularly if they are aging and hoping that you will take more financial responsibility and support them as they get older.",

To be honest, I sorta get that even though I don't agree with the method used because harassment is bad. Taking longer to do a degree \"because I want to\" (versus, say, because OP can't juggle 30 credits and part-time work) can easily be (mis)construed as laziness and an unwillingness to move on with life by OP's parents. Especially if OP isn't putting anything back into the household, I can't exactly blame their parents for wanting OP to move on already and stop being a freeloader. It remains the cultural expectation that someone in their later 20s is at a minimum gainfully employed or in further education (e.g. grad/professional school), even if the stigma against living with parents is not nearly as present as it was 30 years ago. And given the fact that the parents didn't put in a dime, this likely suggests two things: the household isn't very well-off so OP is a substantial budget line item, and OP is collecting student debt up the wazoo and will need to get a job before interest starts really piling up. It's not just \"2 years is going to irreparably screw over OP\"; it won't, but it might actually hurt the parents *right now*. More than that, there's a bit of \"keeping up with the Joneses\" going on with OP's parents. They probably see all their friends' kids with jobs and lives while OP just sits there, and it looks pretty bad on them. It's a little selfish, sure, but parents take pride in their kids.\n\nAgain, **this doesn't justify the method used**, but the motivation is understandable to me. OP's parents likely want the best for them, see them as underachieving and/or aimless, and want them to do better. I mean, if it was my kid and they're clearly not living up to their potential, I would feel the same way...\n\nOP needs to sit down with their parents with a concrete plan on what they want to do with their life. That should assuage concerns and demonstrate that, actually, OP's got a good plan and are sticking with it, instead of being aimless.",

Unless you come from an upper-middle-class/wealthy family, children that continue to live at home while contributing very little financially after they turn 18 are a financial burden to their parents. OP's parents are likely low-income or middle-class individuals. OP may have younger siblings as well that their parents have to think about.\n\nOP is well within their right to finish a university education whenever they want. But then they should not be relying on their parents for financial assistance even for food and living accommodations. If you are over 18 and living at home, most parents will expect that you ease their financial burden.\n\nI had a lot of student debt coming out of law school, so I ended up going back home to stay with my parents. I paid for rent, internet, groceries, and some of the bills, and contributed financially to the household whenever my parents or younger siblings needed the money. I did this of my own volition and not because my parents asked me to. As an adult living with aging parents, this is the most sensible thing to do.\n\nOP's parents are concerned about their future if they are waking up in the middle of the night and asking them about their graduation plans. My parents used to ask me this all the time even when I was in law school (they were rightly worried about all the debt I was collecting). Particularly if OP's parents are immigrants, there is a real concern there and they are struggling to communicate their fears properly to the OP because of cultural and social barriers, which presents itself as toxic behaviour.\n\nNo one here is condoning the parents' behaviour. We are only saying that OP should try to be more empathetic and view things from their perspective and sit down with them to have an open conversation about their plans. You are automatically assuming that OP has bad parents, but if they allowed OP to live in their house for free all these years, then they do care about them and their future. The parents did their job. They raised OP until the age of 18 and allowed them to continue to live with them freely until their mid-20s (and likely would continue to support OP even if they graduated from university and decided to continue living at home).",

It is not clear if OP has mentioned any of this to their parents. Do OP's parents know that they are steadily working towards a degree and have a career plan? If they are asking about graduation plans, then it means they have no clue what OP is doing in university and about their career plans. OP even stated that their parents are asking \"why I'm taking so long to graduate\".\n\nMany parents support children into their 20s, but their children at least have a conversation with them about their career plans and keep them updated along the way. From OP's post, it seems like there is very little dialogue between them, which is part of the reason why their parents keep asking them about their plans. It seems like a lot of miscommunication is happening, which is why I am suggesting that OP sit down with their parents and have an honest, mature conversation about everything.",

This is a very lonely and cold way of thinking and It's a way of viewing family duty that I don't particularly like. Family is family and I will support my parents on hard times if they ever fall on them and I know my parents will do the same. It doesn't matter if I'm 20 or 30 or 40. A sense of community and unconditional love and support is critically missing from our society as a whole, and it's a pretty sad take to have to be grateful that your family is willing to take care of you when you need them most.",

The parents may or may not feel that way, and IMO might have some justification for doing so even if their conduct regarding that is wrong. I actually don't think the parents think that - see below.\n\n&gt; No kid should ever feel like a burden to their own family.\n\nYou say this, but if OP was 40, had never had a job, does not contribute to rent/bills yet lives at home on the parents' dime, would you not be very justified in calling that \"kid\" (we're talking about grown adults here, fwiw) a \"burden on one's family\"?\n\nOP isn't 10, where you'd be right, no child should be made to feel that way because they are legally and practically unable to support themselves otherwise. But here OP is probably nearing or past 25 and is therefore a grown adult who is capable of supporting themselves? I mean, I think it's certainly low to just throw out your kid at 18 when you're able to care for them, however you are well within your rights to do it. OP should count their blessings tbh and sit down with their family because if their family actually believes that OP is a burden, there are things OP can do to mitigate that like starting contributing to finances. \n\nI think the scenario is less of \"OP is a burden to their family\" and more of their family thinking OP is nowhere near living up to potential. That's a different scenario entirely. Given what we see here, I think that's the case since it's definitely a cultural norm for lots of people to want their kids to shine and get off to a good start. What this subreddit sees as \"enjoying school\" can just as easily be cast as \"you don't want to work hard; get a job and stop being lazy\".\n\n&gt; If money is an issue, don\u2019t make your kid feel like shit for it. \n\nLook, OP is an adult and that means they should be able to support themselves if need be or *at a bare minimum* contribute to expenses if required. We are in a cost-of-living crisis not seen in decades and budgets may actually be really tight. Do you think it's fair for OP to live on the parents' budget because they want to \"take it easy\"? I would be livid if I was struggling to make ends meet and my *adult child* is gloating about taking 6 years to graduate \"because they want to\" and not because they *have* to. You want to \"enjoy university\"? Tough, dude, you can do that on your own dime. Now let's see how taking on an extra 2 years of rent feels.\n\nAgain, it's not fair to a minor child who cannot control the situation. It's not unreasonable to say that to an adult who is actively making the problem worse.\n\n&gt; They\u2019re in their last year of university and doing it in a time span that is well within the range of acceptable.\n\nWho defines \"acceptable\"? I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with doing a degree in 6 or even 60 years, but I'm not OP's parents. I did it in 5 years (including coop terms). And if OP was totally financially independent and moved out, yeah, the calculus changes and the parents have a much weaker case. Except from what I gather, they are not, so OP's \"enjoyment of school\" comes at a direct cost to their parents' lives.\n\n&gt; Their parents aren\u2019t stepping up to the plate and acting like parents, they\u2019re simply bullying their kid; it\u2019s not motivating or supportive.\n\nWe only hear one side of the story here. But they *are* acting like parents here. They want the best for their kid, and they likely think their kid is on the wrong path. \"Get a job, graduate already\" - yeah, OP is going to have to do that at some point, don't we all? The parents want to be proud of their child; all good parents do. And right now, sorry to say, I don't get that impression. OP needs to talk to them and see what they are concerned about. Cause that's what it is - they're **concerned about OP's future** and OP has seemingly done nothing to mitigate that. I don't condone the tactics they are using to demonstrate that, but can you not see their motivation?",

I'm not trying to debate the inner workings of their life, I'm just trying to be empathetic to their experience  and I'm just trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here",

In this case, what might prompt the parents' behavior? Human nature would dictate that their actions are likely in response to something and aren't out of the blue.",

Probably see them on their phone or computer and ask them these questions.\n\nIt happens to me too. Sometimes I'll be wasting time late at night. My mom will wake up and check on me and get mad about me wasting time. So I think its similar to that.\n\nI'm not saying the parents should bring this up every time, they should also be understanding. Also, we can't assume that OP is wasting time, rather they could be doing school work in which case the parents shouldn't be getting mad",

    "postText": "I got accepted into York university but I want to go to McMaster. \n\n- McMaster is close to where I live and my job.\n\n- I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d live if I accepted York\u2019s offer, I don\u2019t want to pay too much for rent because I have to pay tuition, but I also still want to live somewhere fairly nice. \n\nI could still work at my job remotely if I go to York, it\u2019d just be a little more convenient if I went to McMaster.\n\nI want to apply to McMaster to start in January but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll accept my application. I was thinking, to boost my average into mid 90s, I\u2019d take one more course in the summer since they take your highest 6 marks. \n\nWhat should I do?",

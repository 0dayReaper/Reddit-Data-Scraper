They\u2019re also pre-reqs for some upper year biochem courses but I think there\u2019re alternatives as well. https://www.yorku.ca/science/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2021/06/Biology-Undergraduate-Handbook-update_June-2020.pdf#page22\n\nBoth courses are notoriously hard and require lots of problem solving practice. Depends on your learning style. I preferred to do them during the year bc I wanted to keep my summers for other stuff but if you feel like you\u2019ll enjoy condensing the course down to around 1.5 months, go for it.",

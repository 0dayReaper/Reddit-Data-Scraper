    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am a first year Engineering student going into second year Engineering (Hopefully Computer Engineering).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed on the 3rd year courses of the checklist, it has a list of courses where I have to take 6 credits from. Two courses that caught my interest are: \n\nHH/IHST 1001 3.00\n\nHH/IHST 1002 3.00 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is though, I don't see them offered on the YorkU Courses Website. Can anyone please tell me more about these courses? Thank you.",

On the [2023-24 academic calendar for computer engineering](https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/academic-calendar#/programs/H1lh6MXk_/ByxxRTQtd?searchTerm=engineering&amp;bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Computer%20Engineering%20-%20Bachelor%20of%20Engineering%20-%20Specialized%20Honours&amp;bcItemType=programs), these are listed as approved science electives. So I think you should be good to go, but reach out to advising just in case.",

Once you've added the classes, when you run a degree progress report, I guess they'll show up as free electives or something.\n\nBy the way:\n\nWhy do you want to work in healthcare?  And, if you do want to work in healthcare, why do you specifically want to be a physician instead of something else in healthcare (e.g. perfusionist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, primary care nurse practitioner, et cetera)?",

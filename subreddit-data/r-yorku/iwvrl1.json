Being on zoom for hours is exhausting.   \n\n\nPlan for tasks to take a bit longer than normal and try to give extra effort in trying to maintain physical and mental health. But don't be too hard on yourselves....I try to follow the advice I gave and fail constantly :)",

For context, I'm taking 4th yr courses and I've completed other 4th yr courses in the past, so while class time is shorter (instead of 3hrs in class, we do around 1h30 on zoom), I feel like I'm spending more time doing assignments and readings. And no, I'm actually procrastinating LESS since I know it's easier to fall into that trap when we're mostly all at home.",

I hated my first undergrad at Queen's, but the college environment for the first two years at TMU/Centennial was amazing. They really hold your hand a bit which is important for nursing school, because it's really tough. You're in a section with the same ~30 students as a block for most of your classes, so you really get to know your classmates. The faculty were mostly amazing.\n\nObjectively, the facilities at TMU/Centennial are better. The York nursing program shares a building with the rest of health studies as well as environmental studies and the nursing simulation lab isn't as impressive. TMU just built a new nursing building that's completely dedicated. Centennial also just opened a new overhaul of their nursing sim lab.\n\nI'm currently doing the NP/MScN graduate program at York. I graduated from TMU/Centennial collab BScN in 2017. Feel free to message me if you have any specific questions.",

I\u2019m in fourth year and I regret coming here for nursing. They hire the worst profs for the courses, they never follow the syllabus, one section gets to take online exams where they can easily cheat and others take in person exam which is completely unfair. Keep in mind they are all in person classes. Course directors will throw you under the bus and won\u2019t help you when you come across an issue. YorkU\u2019s nursing program is so bad that some nursing students are writing their \u201csuicide letter\u201d on ratemyprof after giving their profs bad review (not sure if the review still there, but there are more saying they are hurting themselves). Clinical instructors are so bad that you will end up feeling the dumbest nurse when you start at the hospital. \n\nYou will thank me someday !",

Things may change by the time you start. I really do hope you get a much better experience if you end up choosing York.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an international undergraduate student studying at York U, and I just finished the Winter Term (I started in January) and I\u2019m in the Business and Society course. I originally applied for Bachelor of Commerce but I didn\u2019t meet the mathematics requirements. From what I\u2019ve heard, the BUSO degree doesn\u2019t really get you anywhere and it\u2019s not a proper degree. I\u2019ve never heard of a person with a BUSO degree get an actual job and I\u2019m worried if I could get a proper one after graduating. Is it best I change my degree to something business related and if so, what\u2019s the best course for that? I\u2019d love to have your input. Thank you",

I doubt you would get a traditional business job, but you can still get jobs with a degree such as business and society.\n\nIf you really want to do a certain program, you should work on getting your pre reqs, or take a business course in a community College like Seneca and transfer.",

            "comment": "Little background information: Buddy caught me at a bad moment online and I replied in an aggressive way to one of his comments. He then made a thread on askreddit asking about bringing weapons to school immediately afterwards. At what point do you take a threat like this seriously enough to phone it in?\n\nEdit: He is online, just replied to a comment I made in another thread.\n\nEdit 2: I welcome anyone to use the information from this thread to make a call to whoever they want to about this themselves. I am on the phone all day today until 6pm and to be honest if other people could make sure all of this gets where it needs to go I would love that. I'm just the messenger here and maybe the antagonist too but honestly I don't think the crime fits the punishment. Anything I know about this guy is available in the comments here. Plenty of people here have looked through his comments more than I have. It's clear he is a danger to others.\n\nIf we haven't had an update from someone who reported it then I will spend more time on the phone.  Of course I will. This will be resolved by the end of the day but I hope I don't have to do it. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit 3: ~~I have either been blocked by him or he has deleted his account.~~ Reddit has suspended his account.\n\nEdit 4: u/keh2022 has confirmed that TPS is aware of the situation and is working with York to identify the student.  We did it reddit?\n\nEdit 5: If you have any information about the guy in question, please message u/keh2022.  The police have given them a number to use as a reference number.  This will keep it all organized and easy for the piggies to do their jobs.  Which is important or else they just won't.\n\nEdit 6: Probably the last edit until the guy is found.  Huge shoutout to u/keh2022 and u/SandalwoodSticks for taking the extra step and reporting it, along with anyone else.  I will update this post when we find out more, but I am going to stop refreshing this page and enjoy my evening.  I just want to go back to shitposting again.\n\nEdit 7: I want to wash my hands of this tbh, the constant stress is horrible for my mental right now, I'm signing off from my duties, and I pass the torch to whoever to create a new thread with updates. Hope y'all understand. Cheers \ud83e\udd42\ud83d\ude0a",

Then he gets an unpleasant knock on his door.    \n\nIt's extremely stupid of him to make some veiled threat of violence on a university campus since that is likely to result in a bad outcome for him, but it's most likely that he's just trolling and the only kind of violence he has the means or desire to commit is the kind that's done via a keyboard, although this of course should be investigated.",

This post popped on my feed, as I read what it was about I hope your school catches and figures out what to do, best thing your school police can do is contact lawenforcement@reddit.com about the issue because this is a life threatening situation. If your school does that they can request their perdonal information. You can find out more at [Guidelines for law enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guideline-for-law-enforcement) on the reddit website. Again I hope your school follows similar steps to catch this person. That person is clearly a dangerous individual and should be apprehended for making violent threats and asking if it is allowed to do so. Good luck you guys. \n\n-- Love from the Americans",

I know people my age (20~) who have multiple firearms after taking pretty short courses and checks. These people are thankfully very mentally sound and the dead last person to do anything heinous and evil but the way they described the ease in obtaining the permits/licensing to owning their firearms leads me to understand that many unhinged lunatics could have the same access should they just mask their intentions. \n\nCanada is not without mass shootings and this individual in question that OP is referring to is asking about brining weaponry and firearms to the school with a long post history about torturing and killing animals, enjoying it, feeing like God, having no friends, etc. Clearly an unhealthy individual and a sort of threat that constitutes some kind of action or at least caution.",

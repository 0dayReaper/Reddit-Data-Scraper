As the deadlines are closing in, If I enroll right now on that basis will I get a conditional offer on just being on the course, and after completing can I get unconditional after clearing it?  \n\n\nWhich of the following courses should I do for bcom - management and looking for Schulich   \n \n\n* Mathematics for Data Management (course code MDM4U) **OR**,\n* Advanced Functions (course code MHF4U) **OR**,\n* Calculus and Vectors (course code MCV4U)",

            "comment": "Hey! I had the same issue. I already got myself enrolled in Virtual high school but I was offered conditional admission at York before I completed my course. They made me do a math course in my first year which was counted as my elective course and did not fulfill the requirement for math credits as such. Later I could enrol in other math courses which counted towards my math credits. To answer your question, I got into York without math requirement but I had to take an extra course. I'm not from your major so I won't be able to tell which math you should go for. It's always better to mail admission office because as far as I remember virtual high school is gonna be expensive too! Good luck!!",

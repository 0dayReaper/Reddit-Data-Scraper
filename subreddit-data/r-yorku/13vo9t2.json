    "postText": "I just got admitted late into May and I have so many questions. My enrollment appointment is in August and I cant register for courses before then right? What happens when courses have been filled up way before my appointment. also I cant see anywhere where it says anything about a tuition deposit or anything I need to pay after accepting my admission. Is this how it should be? \n\nIm an international student btw.",

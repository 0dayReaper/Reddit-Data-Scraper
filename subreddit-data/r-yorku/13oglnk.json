    "postText": "I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else is in my position, or what the odds of me getting into the program is. I applied as an internal applicant by completing the program change request form, but it\u2019s still pending :/ The last change was made on the 10th of January. I applied on the 6th on January.\n\nFor context, I only completed 60 credits since I applied while in my second year (I\u2019ll be going into my third in September). However, I completed the 9 credits at the 3000 level and got A+ in all the prerequisites. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda hard to say what my cumulative GPA is since I\u2019m a transfer student, but my gpa at UOttawa using their scale was a 7.8 for my first year (33 credits), and my gpa this year is a 4.0 (27 credits). \n\nI know this program is pretty competitive and that priority is probably given to upper year/ degree holders, but all this waiting is making me a bit antsy.",

If your sister is due to start in September and/or is not registered for accessibility services already, you can begin [registration here](https://accessibility.students.yorku.ca/new-students) to ensure she gets the assistance she needs. You can register as soon as she accepts her offer to York. \n\nFor housing in particular, they have a [Housing Needs Assessment Form](https://accessibility.students.yorku.ca/housing-needs-assessment). This allows accessibility services to work with student housing to find accommodation for her. However, there is no guaranteed space for housing at York (usually beyond first year), so be prepared for that. Best of luck to your sister!",

It\u2019s possible that something can be worked out, but it\u2019s best to get all of the required info and accommodations to York ASAP so they fully understand the necessity and are able to work out a solution for her. Fingers crossed for when the time comes. If you have further questions, you also shouldn\u2019t hesitate to contact accessibility services yourself - I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be able to give more insight into this specific case.",

Great spot to blaze in the winter.\nAlso, you had to \"burst\" doors, but you could get to almost any building on campus at night...including the big maintenance buildings. We once found a staged fake skeleton in a nook; scared the everything out of us in the half-light down there. Also found sealed doors with hazard signs all over them. Weird thing to see underground. Didn't chance those ones!",

When I was there those graffitied pedestrian tunnels were accessible, but mainly gave us rascals access to what we called sub-tunnels. A couple doors you would have to bodycheck them (burst) to open them; a couple you had to pick the lock with a credit card type of card. There may have been other ways in? I think there was a vent near the greenhouse we would pop and then descend? Foggy memories!\nI am not advocating any illegal behaviour of course. \ud83d\ude42",

I have been through those tunnels a bunch.\n\nWhat the user who made the comment about the fake skeleton is referring to is the maintenance/steam tunnels. I have never been there myself, once again, for good reason, as they are illegal to enter, and I do not condone anyone doing this either.",

I presume eventually the liability outweighed the convenience. \nActually, walking through the tunnel was how I discovered Lou Reed.

Room 908x if I recall correctly.\n\nWe got into the tunnels once through the residence of our basement and made it all the way to the cafeteria behind Vari Hall.  I remember seeing flashlights bobbing in the tunnel and running back to res as if our lives depended on it. I spent eight months on that campus. It was my first time away from home. I haven't been back since, not since the late 90s anyway.  I'm sure it has changed a ton.  \n\nBack then, all of the connected buildings were unlocked in the residences, from Vanier Hall to Winters and beyond. I'm not sure if it's like that anymore. At times I would be wandering around and it seemed like it was just the campus and I. Other times we would be exploring the nooks and crannies of buildings, their exteriors, little woodlots, bushes and other unbeaten paths and hiding spots. The library was super cool too, lots of quiet places to study and write.  Maybe if there wasn't so much going on that year, I would have done better.",

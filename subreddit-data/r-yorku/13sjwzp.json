I\u2019m not sure if I should redo the course I got a C in as I\u2019m planing to apply to law school afterwards and a bit worried the C will look bad and bring me down. Is this good for first year? Or should I retake the class.",

If it does not remove it, then there is no point in retaking it.\n\nMost law schools focus on your best 2 years, last 2 years, etc. Only some schools like Osgoode and UOttawa look at cumulative GPA. There are 20 common law schools in Canada. It does not take a lot of time to read up on the admissions requirements for the schools you are interested in applying to. Most schools also post their average acceptance GPAs and LSAT scores.",

I personally wouldn\u2019t bother if it\u2019s just first year but I\u2019d retake if it\u2019s D and below. If you fail any at any point, I\u2019d try to petition (just saying for future reference. \n\nI\u2019d say most law schools look at cumulative gpa, but some are last 2 years, or best three years. If you\u2019re trying to get in uoft and Osgoode then it\u2019s really a numbers game and luck. For other schools, try to do really well in your upper years and LSAT.",

Queen's does look at cGPA but place greater weight on the top 2 years of undergraduate studies.\n\nWhen I went to law school, Queen's listed a 3.4 cGPA as the cutoff on its website. Although this has since been removed, I believe Queen's still cares about cGPA since you do not see many low cGPAs get in there, according to the admissions stats on the canlawforum.\n\nOutside of Ontario, I do not think most law schools other than McGill focus on cGPA. However, I graduated a couple years ago so I am not up to date with current admissions standards.",

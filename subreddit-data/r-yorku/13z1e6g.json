How bad does it impact the students? \n\nI know york has had strikes in the past that caused students to be off for a bit so I\u2019m jus worried lol",

No one has a crystal ball to tell you what the future entails.\n\n  \nWe almost had a strike 1-2 years ago. They voted to strike but a deal was reached in the last hour, avoiding the strike.\n\nI believe that both times before that, they voted to strike and did actually make it to the picket lines.\n\nAnything can happen now if they vote yes and end up in a legal strike position. However, asking if the strike will actually happen is like asking if the stock market will go up or down on monday, or asking who will win the Champions League final next Saturday.",

YUSA 1 almost striked (stroke?) last year and I forget the other union that almost had a strike before that\n\n\nWith Bill 124 bring deemed unconstitutional the unions will be heading back to the negotiating table soon fighting for big raises and back pay so I wouldn't be surprised if there's another strike or two around then. Maybe if all the unions are negotiating at the same time we'll have a mega strike",

It was avoided in the last **two** and the one before those two was the last strike. \n\nThe one last year, they voted to strike and were in a legal strike position but I believe they reached a deal right before midnight on the day they planned to start striking. \n\nWith bill 124 being shot down, i believe many unions across all of the affected industries are going to show up to their next contract negotiations with their guns blazing. High inflation will make them have crazy (yet justifiable!) demands, as well as having demands for retro-pay from all the previous raises during bill 124.    \n\n\nWith Doug Ford being put in his place regarding trying to deem strikes unconstitutional, I believe the employers will have no way out this time around. They will have to make a significant attempt to negotiate in good faith, or risk strikes. The government will not be able to bail them out next time through frozen wage hikes or deeming a strike unlawful.\n\nPerhaps the government will come up with a third way to take away negotiating powers from unions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I am not trying to be political, and am sorry if my comments frustrate anyone. Just discussing the situation, without taking sides.",

The 2018 strike was a different beast and I essentially didn't have a second semester; that bitch shattered strike records. \n\nI recommend reading up on your rights because, as a student, York has a lot of rights in place for students so you don't get absolutely wrecked by the strike. \n\nThe main ones being you don't have to cross the picket line as some teachers, the tenured ones, have to be there and teach their classes. And if the strike hits a different point you are able to essentially take the grade you have now. \n\nYou are also entitled to receiving a similar amount of class time that you lost during the strike. \n\nI believe you can find your rights through YFS but, beyond making sure your grades are strong going in, there's not too much more to do to prepare.",

Communications from both sides will include a certain amount of spin so be cautious with what you take from materials coming out of a labour dispute. In fact the post you mention may well have been largely intended to persuade YUSA members themselves that the working conditions of contract admin staff are a strike issue. The union is basically asking people with job security and benefits to stand up for those who have none of these things. \n\nAs far as I recall, none of the strikes in recent history have involved YUSA (union for admin folks), they've all been contract faculty (TAs and contract profs), and strikes have mostly been driven by the unit representing TAs. \n\nSo, there is no guarantee current negotiations will end with a strike.",

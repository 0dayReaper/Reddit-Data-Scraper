Once again dos the uni contact me regarding this or what? \n\nThank you so much.",

Some programs need an appointment to enroll bc they need to tell them about specific details when making the timetable. For the fee part I think there is a deadline for it and to pay it at least 5 businesses days before it so it reaches yorku in time. Here: https://sfs.yorku.ca/fees/deposit",

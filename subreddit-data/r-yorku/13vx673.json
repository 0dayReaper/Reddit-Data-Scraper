    "postText": "My first question is regarding, internships! I am asking for a first year student. When can you sign up for internship programs? Do you have to pay for it. Were you able to find internships by yourself? Please suggest where to search for internships beside indeed, Linkedin. \n\n2nd question regarding LA&amp;PS Peer Mentor Network program? Did anyone signed up for it and how was your experience.\n\nAnother question regarding C4 capstone project? Was it helpful for you? Did you learn some valuable experience to put on your resume. Thanks",

    "postText": " For context:\n\nI'm a Psyc BA undergrad going into my 3rd year. Before people ask me why I chose psyc BA over BSc, (because I get that question a lot) it's because I didn't want to have to take a computers course and a math course. \n\nI have found most of my profs to be good but I don't really know how they are supposed to get to know me and write like a good reference letter on why I'd be a good doctor using the OMSAS criteria. \n\nI do ask my professors questions about the course content when I don't understand something, but other than asking questions, I don't really talk about anything else with them. Plus, most of my classes have 100+ students in them so it's kind of hard to stand out in front of a professor when many of them also teach other courses and/or sections of the same class.\n\nBesides doing research with them, as this isn't always possible since there's the possibility of them rejecting your application or they might not have a lab or they might not be currently recruiting people for their lab, what are some good ways to get a good relationship with a professional so you can get a great reference letter for med school?\n\nI really don't know what I should do. I guess maybe I could try to have the same prof twice for 2 different courses but, again, I don't know how to get close to them in a way that they will get to know me and my personality.\n\nIf you know any profs who are easily approachable in the Psyc department or faculty of science department (I'm taking bio and chem courses as electives), that would be great too.\n\nI really don't know how to go about this and any tips/advice are appreciated!!!\n\nThank you so so SO much if you made it to the very end of this very long post. \ud83d\ude0a",

I worked closely with the psychology professors. \n\nI rounded up about 12 references in total from my professors and then picked the top three. \n\nThis included a few biology, psyc, social science, and anthropology profs. \n\nDefinitely ask more than one professor. \n\nLiterally go up to them and tell them you're applying for med school and would love a reference. And offer any kind of assistance or help in exchange for the referral. \n\nYou can email them.\nYou can directly ask them in person.\n\nI remember Professor Julie Conder provided an excellent reference letter. So did assistant professor Jessica Sutherland's. Prof A. Kopinska as well. \n\nIf you didn't have any of these profs genuinely just build a connection by introducing yourself and simply ask! \n\nI recently applied for a second graduate program. I'll provide a template below for reference :) \n\n* But genuinely I know it seems scary but do not be intimidated. Professors at York actually want to see you succeed.",

Ask questions one on one after class and sometimes you can leave the class talking together. When there\u2019s a lecture / topic / tiny point even that feels relevant or especially interesting to you, tell them after class! \u201cI just wanted to say I really appreciated when you discussed / touched on / mentioned _____, that feels really important and relevant for me because ____\u201d. Sometimes that will get you talking about your life sorry with them a bit and getting to know them more personally. For zoom classes I have even sent an email saying that kinda thing. Also if you have zoom classes, put your camera on. If you make a list of questions before a test or something, ask to meet with them one on one like in their office. After classes thank them and tell them it was interesting. After the first class introduce yourself \u201cmy name is ___ I\u2019m really interested in your course / excited to take your course because ____\u201d - can show your specific interests. Email them a thank you email after the course finished that personally addresses how they impacted you and how their course was personally relevant for you or your goals. Oh, another thing I\u2019ve done is if I have used something that I learned in their course later on for another course or project or anything, I write them and tell them how what they taught me stuck with me and is continuing to impact me and thank them. These are just some ways off the top of my head.",

Switch out now if you can.\n\nThese are highly competitive admissions processes where your aim should be to stand out from the other applicants-   \n\nThe vast majority of applicants to Medicine will come from \u201cpremed\u201d or some biology related stream; the vast majority of law school applicants will all have similar backgrounds (polisci/philosophy/some other liberal art) too; and at least for younger students, the vast majority of mba applicants will come from economics or business undergrad. \n\nBut look at the composition of the accepted students- it\u2019s extremely varied.   Certainly take the required prerequisites, but you have a waaaaaay better chance of acceptance if you come from an \u201cunrelated\u201d undergrad program.  They want classes with diverse backgrounds where people contribute from unique perspectives.\n\nYou want to get into medschool?  Excel in an architecture,  literature, or computer science undergrad. For you to stand out as an exceptional premed candidate you have to be better than 10,000 other premed candidates.   But to stand out as an architecture student, you just need decent scores to get into medschool because you already have a compelling story. \n\nYou want to go to law school?  Kick ass in microbiology or physics.\n\nYou want to get into an mba-  just fucking wait a few years and excel in whatever field choose as a passion and excel at-  nobody needs Econ  major mbas in the real world-   But somebody who comes from a Steam\nBackground with experience and gets an mba to augment their career is really valued-\n\n\nEdit-  furthermore if you stay in premed but don\u2019t get into medicine, your degree is basically useless and won\u2019t get you a job anywhere.",

A degree is still a degree. Also, I'm not in the undergrad program that everyone usually takes for med school. I barely know anyone in psychology that is actually interested in going to med school. Most pre-meds are in medical related programs like biomedical science, biology, kinesiology, health sciences, neuroscience, or biochem. \n\nI think Psyc is a useful undergrad degree because if med school doesn't work out for whatever reason, I could go to grad school or get a Psyc related job. And that is my back-up plan.\n\nI'd just like to know where you got your info from about it being more useful for those wanting to go to med school to get into an undergrad program not related to medicine.\n\nMost people actually pursue a science undergrad degree because bio, chem, physics, psychology and sociology are on the MCAT. \n\nI was actually looking at so many medical school people's LinkedIn profiles (like maybe 30 of them) and most of them had a biology, biomedical science, kinesiology, or health science undergrad.\n\nPlus, I like psychology a lot so why would I change my undergrad degree to architecture or engineering? Shouldn't I pursue a degree that I'm interested in and passionate about?",

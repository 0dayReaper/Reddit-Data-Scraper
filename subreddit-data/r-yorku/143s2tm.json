You might end up having to take extra time to graduate, and you might have to take more than 90 or 120 credits in the end.  Consider seeking [academic advising](https://advising.students.yorku.ca/).\n\nAlso see the [Lassonde program change admission requirements](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/student-life/lassonde-program-change-information).\n\nAlso see the information and warnings on the [program change page](https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change).\n\nMeanwhile, this fall, if you can get into it, you can try to take EECS 1012 3.00 - Introduction to Computing: A Net-centric Approach.  This will give you some idea on whether or not you like software development.  I suggest that you not take more than three total credits of computer science courses for now.  If you end up not getting approved for a program change, it might end up being somewhat of a waste of time.\n\nComputer science is not just about software development.  There's also a fair bit of computing theory, and quite a bit of math too.  Hopefully you'll like it.\n\nYou can search past threads to find out if it's easier to get into comp sci or computer security.",

    "postText": "So I'm an undergraduate student and currently in the process of paying my first year tuition fee (I've already paid more than 70%) and my course enrollment will begin from tomorrow. \n\nThe thing is after enrolling in my courses I need to pay a registration deposit of 300 dollars which is said to be a part of the tuition fees, but if I've already paid my tuition fees what happens to that money? Can somebody please explain this to me, thank youuu",

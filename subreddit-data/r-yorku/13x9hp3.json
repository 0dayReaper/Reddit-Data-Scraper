If you know what to take, then I would probably do, first open the visual schedule builder one side, course list site the other side, and rate my professor site over wrapped the other side. Then you adjust your schedule based your decision. \nI would make sure first year would be more like exploring and trying to adjust the first uni year life and figuring out mainly. \nMake sure one day is off such as No class on Friday or Monday. Those would help you a lot at the end. If you work, make sure those would be consideration also.",

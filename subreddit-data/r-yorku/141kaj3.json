    "postText": "Every year we have the same questions from psyc so as a now 5th year, heres the important info. \n\nTake PSYC 1010. You need that as a prereq for EVERY psych class. Take your 6 credit NATS HUMA and SOSC gen ed classes. And thats it for necessary classes year 1. Do 30 credits max and likely you wont pay attention in 8am classes. GO TO CLASS, youre paying thousands for it. \n\nFinally, psych BAs/BScs are very limited in job potential. Consider the current housing market and economy if you plan on becoming independent after graduation. Grad school is extremely competitive (I\u2019m talking 500+ applicants for 3-6 positions). You need a PhD to become a psychologist. A Masters to become a therapist. If you\u2019re here to make good money and do something with your degree, you need fantastic grades and volunteer work. Research work if you\u2019re planning on grad school for clinical, experimental or neuro. Plan ahead and plan early. Dont wait till year 3 to decide you need to go to grad school. \n\nGood luck its a great program :) the school itself tho :/ cant say I ever got into a class I need on time without getting locked out.",

A Masters to become a therapist.\n\nI think you should also emphasize what is an important distinction here- one that almost all Psyc students are apparently not made aware of.  This:  Grad school in *Clinical Psych* is incredibly competitive.  That is *not* the only (or even the best or most efficient) route to become a therapist (contrary to popular misunderstanding in the program).  There are many Master's of Counselling (and similar) programs cropping up now, that are not very competitive (some of them cost money though), and that you can go to to become a therapist.  ONLY do the clinical psych route if you *genuinely* like research.\n\nOP made this clear roughly here, but I think students need to be explained it in more detail by their faculty (which they almost never are.  Why? Maybe because the faculty are all PhD graduates and that was the route they took.  A very tiny percentage of students will ever be successful in that route- so it's worth looking into less competitive master's programs).  /rant.\n\nEdit: fixed a word (generally -&gt; genuinely)...",

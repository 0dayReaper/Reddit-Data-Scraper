    "postText": "My parents need my RESP money and I know in order to get it you need a VOE (verification of enrollment) letter. The thing is I wasn't enrolled in any courses in the 2022 winter sem and I'm not taking any summer courses right now either. I told my parents I need to currently be enrolled in a course but they don't understand, thinking that I'm in the program and that's enough. Is there any way I can get the VOE despite not being enrolled in courses right now? And how do I explain to my parents that I need to be enrolled in a course to get the VOE?",

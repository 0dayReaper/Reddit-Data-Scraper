            "comment": "This question has been discussed ad infinitum, which is why you haven't been getting answers.\n\nIt really depends on your major and what else you've got on the table. The advice you'll get will differ depending on this.\n\nPersonally, I liked York, I don't regret it. I got good coops and am about to start work at a pretty good place. However, I was also a good student with lots of extracurriculars and the like. Work...well it's hard, but so is every other engineering program, and the curricula are very similar no matter where you go due to accreditation. Peers are pretty supportive for the most part (a feeling I definitely didn't see when I toured U of T), but as in any university, be cautious of deadweights who take from you but cannot give back.\n\nTo be honest, go to whichever is closest and avoid moving out if you can help it unless it's to Waterloo. Not worth it otherwise.",

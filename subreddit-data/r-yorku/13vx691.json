            "comment": "Judging by your post history...are you committed to engineering in the first place? What is your motivation to study engineering?\n\nYork and TMU are very comparable for most fields of engineering and neither has a large advantage over the other. Study at whichever one is closer to you.\n\nCoop at any school (not named Waterloo, at least) is what you make of it. No matter where you go, to be a good candidate you will need to combine strong knowledge in the field with extracurricular experience. York students can and do get coops at great places, as do TMU students. What isn't said, but should be obvious, is that better candidates get better positions and this applies everywhere, even Waterloo. There are York students who work at Google and Waterloo students who are unemployed.",

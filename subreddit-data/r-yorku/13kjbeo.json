    "postText": "So I'm currently going to my third year for undergrad (my major is Psyc). I'm worried because I know med school is a super competitive process and I really want to do whatever it takes to get in. However, in my years at York I did not join any clubs \ud83d\ude05. I have a part-time job and my GPA is 8.54/9.00, which I will try to hopefully raise higher. So I don't have really something that makes me stand out from other med school applicants, which worries me \ud83d\ude05. I applied for a volunteer position at York, I'm just waiting to hear back. What are some clubs that are good to join as a Pre-Med or some volunteer activities and organizations at York or anywhere else that are not competitive and would accept me and my lack of experience? \ud83d\ude05 Thank you so much in advance for your advice!! \u263a\ufe0f",

KAHSSO\u2019s Instagram also sometimes posts about getting into med school. Also I\u2019d see about taking some KINE courses if you haven\u2019t already like anatomy and physiology and there are interesting upper year KINE courses that relate to both psyc and health (like neuro stuff).",

Your gpa is absolutely impressive, I wish I hit the 8.5 mark, but I\u2019m going into my last year so I can\u2019t raise it to that extent. That means you have a 3.9 GPA so you should be real proud of yourself. You have so much time to still build your skills. Take a year off from school after you are done to apply for a research position in a subject you are related in. Also, I suggest you work in any sort of humanitarian work to show your a socially involved individual who\u2019s willing to educate and inform yourself of diversity issues and factors!",

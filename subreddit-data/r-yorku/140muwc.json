    "postText": "I need to take a 3 credit course for this summer in order to stay in my program. I am thinking of enrolling in acting for non-majors II in the S2. This course was canceled in S1 summer due to not having enough people enrolled. If I enroll in it now for S2 and then it comes time for the course to start, then they cancel it, what happens to me? Would I just need to find last minute 3 credit course that is hopefully open and available for me to take?",

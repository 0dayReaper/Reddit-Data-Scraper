During the fall and winter terms I teach the course fully in person. In the summer terms I plan to offer it ONCA (online with in person tests). Technically courses aren\u2019t confirmed for next summer, because only the administration can officially approve courses (not professors), but I am confident you can plan for the course to be offered online most summers.",

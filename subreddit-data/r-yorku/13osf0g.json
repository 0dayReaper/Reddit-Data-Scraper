    "postText": "As the OUAC deadline approaches I am leaning towards this program. Was wondering if anyone in the program could answer the following questions:\n\n1) Obviously a subjective question but GPA wise is it easier maintain a higher GPA? (If possible could you state your GPA so far)\n\n2) How are the research opportunities and how can I get into them right away? (if it\u2019s possible)\n\n3) Are there any professors that are good and others to avoid and specific courses to choose (bird) and others to avoid?  Also how are the TA\u2019s?\n\n4) Any tips on how to succeed in this program and is there a big shift in knowledge for the Bio and Chem courses from grade 12 than those in first year?\n\nSorry for so many questions just wanna have the most knowledge and Google is not as helpful cause it\u2019s a relatively new program.",

            "comment": "I can speak to your question #4. You will need to pass two CHEM courses during your first year in the program (CHEM1000 and CHEM1001). Some students find these very challenging, others find them very easy. There is no way for anyone on Reddit to predict how you personally will perform in these, so please take all opinions about the level of difficulty with a gain of salt. One advise I will offer is to take CHEM1500 in S2 (July-August) if you want to improve your knowledge of chemistry for CHEM1000/1001. This course is specifically designed to prepare students for these required courses. Also, taking 1500 is an easy way to earn 4 credits towards your pure electives.",

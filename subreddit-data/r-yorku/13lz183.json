Does this mean that I'm guaranteed into Software, Electrical and Computer for 2nd year if I were to theoretically accept my York offer?",

            "comment": "Hey just finished first year engineering at York. Basically if you accept your offer you\u2019ll be put in general first year like all the other engineers. If you meet the requirements during first year ( Overall GPA above 5 and EECS GPA over 4.5 I think), then you will be put into software for second year. Once you finish first year you\u2019ll get an email saying that you\u2019re in \u2018First Choice\u2019, \u2018Second Choice\u2019 in the summer before second year starts.",

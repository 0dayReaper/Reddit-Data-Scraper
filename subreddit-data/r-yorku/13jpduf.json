            "comment": "It depends on which university and program you want to transfer into. At a minimum, universities typical ask for at least a 3.0/4.0 GPA for admission and likely even higher if you want to get in a more competitive school/program. You can always contact the admissions office at your desired university and ask them directly. \n\nBut before you do that, ask yourself why you\u2019re not doing well and think about how you might do that. Working with an academic advisor can be great and beneficial. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to just take a break to focus on your mental health, reassess and then proceed. Don\u2019t feel obligated to continue if you\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s okay to reach out for help to get back on the right track. \n\nGood luck, OP! You got this :)",

    "postText": "should I take this course or no? \n\nI am a native english speaker but my partner is Persian and I would like to learn farsi. I have been given permission by the department to join but there are not many reviews on RMP, the few reviews i found were mixed, one saying great, easy course and another saying the course was hard even for a native farsi speaker. So any insight would be appreciated.\n\nalso, is coming to class mandatory/ necessary, theres another course i wanted to take that has a slight overlap, i would miss the last 30 mins of pers1000 class",

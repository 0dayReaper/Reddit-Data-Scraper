    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI asked the Academic Advisor to change my degree from IBsc Hons CS to normal Hons CS. They changed it almost immediately (that was fast).\n\nThe problem is they changed to Spec. Hons CS instead of normal Hons CS (as I requested), so I wanna ask if there are many differences between the two. \n\nI looked up the checklist and saw that Spec. has to take more CS courses and fewer electives, but I don\u2019t want to do that because I\u2019m planning to add a minor, too.",

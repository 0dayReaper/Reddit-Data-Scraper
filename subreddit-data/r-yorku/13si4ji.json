    "postText": "Howdy! I\u2019m starting my MSW this fall. I was working full-time throughout my undergrad and almost passed away a few times but I made it with good grades and only one mental breakdown over the last few years.\n\nI work 12 hour shifts, so full-time for me is only 3 days a week.\n\nCan anybody please offer me advice on their experiences as a working student and if you personally feel this is manageable? I have no idea what to expect and I want to stay as full-time if possible\n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "If you are a full time grad school, then working your current job is against university policy and you\u2019ll likely be forced into part time status . As per York\u2019s policy:\n\n\u201cFull-time graduate students may hold employment provided that they are not regularly employed for more than an average of ten hours per week for any period for which they are registered as full-time graduate students. If the student is employed by the University as a graduate or teaching assistant, the ten hours per week represents the total time spent by the student in connection with the appointment and includes the time spent on preparative work, reading set assignments, marking examinations, etc.\u201d\n\nThis will also create issues with your program. There\u2019s a full time MSW which has a different structure than the part time MSW program. Did you disclose your work and intentions to the program department and or potential supervisor?",

            "comment": "I've known people who worked part time during their MSW, but never full time. Many had to drop their full time job in order to complete their program. You can ask the coordinator again specifically asking if you are allowed to work full time just in case.\n\nPlacement requires you to commit 3 days (8 hours each) while working on your research paper, and attending lectures/course work if you've chosen to do electives on the same term.   Unless you are really amazing at managing your well-being, my guess is you'll burnout doing the MSW and a full-time position. If it is allowed, you can always try and if it gets too overwhelming then you'll have to make a decision to drop your job or the program.",

York's Kin program is maybe ~$34,000 per year.  So, you'll pay significantly more to go to York.\n\nWhen you transfer, some credits might not transfer, so you might have to retake some courses.  This is an additional cost.\n\nWhy transfer?\n\nWhich campus is closer to you?\n\nWhat do you want to do after graduation?",

    "postText": "My sister got into Schulich, but is having many second thoughts on the choice and stressing out. She seems to be interested in the creative side of things like media production. Anyone take a similar path, or just any advice on diverging from the traditional business path? Any personal experiences would be amazing too. Just want to help give her some Wisdom and make her feel better about the choice. I tried going on LinkedIn of course but the results are buried with people who go down the business path.",

Basically he creates the thing on paper, and tells the programmers and artists what to make. As a programmer, this can be difficult for me to do, and my life is made way easier if I have a good product designer.",

    "postText": "Hii !!! I am thinking about studying the accelerated 2 year nursing at York University in 2024 . i recently dropped my bachelors degree in business after studying for a year and I do not have any science background AT ALL (i did not take science in my high school) but I am still planning to take all the necessary prerequisites starting from the fall.\n\ni wanted to hear others opinion. would it be super hard to understand all the anatomy, biochem, pharm etc without having studied chemistry and bio in high school?( i sucked at science in middle school) or should i opt for 4 year nursing by taking high school chem and bio?? But if i did the accelerated one, I will have to finish 36 credits prereqs in fall and winter term. I am very scared and confused. It would mean a lot if i could hear your opinions. :)))",

            "comment": "I'll only comment on chemistry courses. If among those 36 credits that you plan to take are courses like CHEM1000, CHEM1001, and biochem, then it will be a bit challenging to do well in all of them without recent high school chemistry background. If you want to prepare for these courses, consider taking CHEM1500 is S2 (July-August). This way it will be much easier to do well in CHEM1000/1001 in Fall/Winter.",

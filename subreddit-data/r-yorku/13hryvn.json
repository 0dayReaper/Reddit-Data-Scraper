So my enrollment also starts on the 17th but I don't think I can enroll till the session in June. I checked the undergraduate course enrollment guide and it says to wait for the date of the session, so if you haven't booked one, you might want to do it asap so they can send you the email soon as well. But just in case, contact academic advising. They can guide you better",

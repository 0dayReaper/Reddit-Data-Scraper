            "comment": "I'm a Psyc major who has a part-time job and I know for my courses at least (4 courses per term), I was able to schedule them out where I could go to school 3 times a week. I did this by on some days having 2 classes in one day. Sometimes that meant back to back classes so I was in class for 6 hours straight. \ud83d\ude05 It should be the same like the course planning in terms of that there are multiple sections for the same classes for your CS program. Usually the most popular courses have multiple sections so you can choose the time that works best for you. \ud83d\ude42",

I use them synonymously. So at least here at York one course = one class (one specific subject). But each course like for example Introduction to Computer Science (this may or may not be the actual name of a course or it might be named differently or split into specific computer science streams, it's just a hypothetical example \ud83d\ude02). So let's say you have a course called intro to computer science. That course if it's a first year course will be quite big since it's a first year main course. So there will be many different professors teaching that same course at different times. And you can pick whatever time works best for you \ud83d\ude42.",

Or a lot of courses have 2 classes a week. For instance,  back in college we had 2 classes for JAVA since it was a huge course with 6 creidts. I am asking that because i saw some schedules online and people have so many classes in a week.",

Maybe for computer science one course has class 3 times a week. I'm not too sure since that's not my major. But I suggest looking at the course schedule for fall 2023-24 so you can see what time the courses are at.",

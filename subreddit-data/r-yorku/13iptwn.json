    "postText": "I'm planning on studying CS at York in the Fall. However, I'm really worried about making friends and meeting people. I hear York is a pretty dead school and ppl are more closed-off, and as a girl in CS too I feel like I'll have a harder time? I really want to be able to a part of my community and make friends and have memories in university yk? Not nescialrily party, but like be able to go to school events, show school spirit, have chances to make friends, have a good time yk? None of my friends in hs are going to York either so I'm going into this alone which also makes me a bit nervous. So for anyone in CS at york or york in general, how is the social life and community there? Is it easy to make friends? R there any cool school events? How is frosh week?  THANKS !! I",

Attitudes are changing and class ratios are improving (I think \ud83e\udd14), but there will be some classes where there are only a handful of women. **But don't let this scare you!** The guys in cs/eng aren't like the tech guys depicted on TV so you don't need to worry about being an outcast. The guys in these classes actually really friendly &amp; social, and will treat you like any other student in cs lol. Also, since there are fewer women, usually you're able to create a tight-knit group of girl friends to hang out with throughout your degree which is also really nice! :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found that the kids at York are really friendly and ready to help (like in classes and stuff). Obviously since it's a commuter school and with STEM programs in general there isn't much time for a social life *during school* unless you want to go to the Break Room and play games or a restaurant on/near campus or go to the mall on the way home (small stuff like that). I know that there are some CS clubs that hold events but they generally aren't events like semi-formals, more casual than that.   \n\n\nIn engineering/cs the students are a lot more reserved, *you* will need to make an effort to reach out to them, this is at most other schools too. I feel like eng/cs draw in more introverted and quiet kids just because the nature of the jobs that you end up with afterwards usually cater to those personality traits. If you make an effort to be social with other students then I have found that most students will match the energy (there are a few outliers but don't let them discourage you!). A big mistake I made during first year was not talking to the students sitting around me during lectures because I was nervous and worried about what they'd think. Don't worry about it and just talk to them and you *will* be able to make friends.   \n\n\nIn general the community at York is 11/10, the students will help each other out and be nice to each other, give advice, help with resume/interview prep etc. So if you make an effort then you'll be able to have a great group of friends to hang out with in later years.",

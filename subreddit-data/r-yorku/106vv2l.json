But providing race in these sorts of alerts has been shown to lead to profiling much more in POC than Caucasian\u2019s (honestly can\u2019t be bothered to find the source, but i think the point is pretty well understood).\n\nUnfortunately I think there\u2019s no perfect answer here, as all routes lead to problems.",

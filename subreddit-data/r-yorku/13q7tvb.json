    "postText": "Hi, currrent Grade 11 student here!\n\nI will be applying to various design programs in Canada in November, including York DESN, and I have a lot of work that is fanart and a few drawings of people/oc art. 2D work, Typography, Interactive media, Motion graphics, Drawing &amp; Illustration, Photography, and Painting are all areas of art that are accepted. I'm only really proficient with digital, although I am working on that, and have photography and small animations.\n\nI'm worried that I won't be able to use any of my other art and will have to start from scratch, it's been something I've kind of been dreading haha. I do plan on making a few more pieces (actual design/product design works) catered to the program however.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you!",

You\u2019ve got plenty of time before the application so I\u2019d consider a) trying to play around with Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator (you can use a 30-day free trial if you need) and, more importantly, b) attend a portfolio event like National Portfolio Day, where one of us on the faculty will take a look at what you have and make recommendations on what to use and what to change once you\u2019re ready to apply. \n\nGood luck!",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your response! I've used Photoshop a bit when editing photos but haven't yet used it or tried Illustrator for drawing so I will follow your advice. I've heard of Portfolio day so I will definitely try and come in for that.\n\nThe reasons why it feels like I won't have much time is because I take a while to draw and then after I'm done it takes me a while to get motivated/inspired so I'm worried this will affect the number of quality pieces I will have in time for submission. Another one is because I need more mediums than just digital art and I need to try new mediums and make something good enough before the deadline.\n\nI appreciate the advice, thank you!",

I do not have stats yet but will be taking it first semester. \n\nNot sure if gpa matters for research positions, but I have an 8.2/9 with an sgpa of 9 and a major gpa of 9.\n\nIf it is, would anyone know to go about finding reasearchers studying in niche areas such as anything in the realm of anesthesia/surgery/pain management? Thanks!",

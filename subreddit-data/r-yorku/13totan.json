    "postText": "Hello,  I am asking for my niece. She is in first year of BA in IT from YorkU. We were talking about her future career paths and she was little confused. She knows she should start her career as a Helpdesk. But from there where to go? Like cloud computing, cybersecurity, Software developer?\n\nShe is interested to take few courses such as python and helpdesk courses for her internship search next year. She also wants to know about software developer. She knows she needs to make a good portfolio to get an intership or a job in future.\n\nWould you recommend any courses for her? Like helpdesk or any other from Udemy?  Or coursera course in longterm. She is working on Python, javascript.\n\nNobody has IT background at home and I want to help her. I dont have IT background so please forgive me if I said something stupid. Thanks",

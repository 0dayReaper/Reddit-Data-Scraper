You don't get part marks for code, but there are usually several unit tests for every nontrivial function so you can at least get some of those tests right even if your code isn't perfect. That being said, 1022 is not a hard course.\n\nI had Varvara Nika once, really boring lecturer, but I didn't find 1090 hard with her in person (pre-pandemic). She was at least pretty helpful and was very open to people coming for office hours; she even organized a review session for the exam! Though since I did 1090 with her, YMMV for 1019.",

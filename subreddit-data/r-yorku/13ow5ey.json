Though there is no formal minimum wage,  Denmark boasts one of the highest wages for fast food workers in the  world. Unions secured a collective bargaining agreement [with McDonald's in 1989](http://www.remappingdebate.org/sites/all/files/The%20high%20road%20to%20high%20wages%20-%20Denmark%27s%20answer%20to%20the%20U.S.%20model.pdf) that has allowed workers to negotiate pay ever since, and all workers currently make about $21 per hour in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe  downside? McDonald's food is significantly more expensive; a Big Mac  there set you back $5.18 as of January 2014, compared to $4.62 in the  U.S.\n\n([https://www.huffpost.com/entry/global-mcdonalds-protests\\_n\\_5324938](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/global-mcdonalds-protests_n_5324938))",

They haven't figured out how to do it for minimum wage for some reason",

    "postText": "I have applied to york university and got into the bcom information technology program. I was wondering how it was? Was it hard? Did anyone get good internships? If I do continue with this program what jobs in the future can I get? \n\nI also heard Ontario Tech is a really good school now. Especially for computer science. Do you think I should go to Ontario Tech computer science program instead? \n\nDo jobs look at which uni you go to? If not, which degree do you guys think is better? \n\nI'm also looking at the school environment, and I'm just so lost right now. Any suggestions?",

    "postText": "I just recently accepted York University for the Speech and Language Sciences program. In YU Start, however (unlike my friends in other programs), no courses are  listed under \"Courses to Take\". Under \"Major Credits\" on the academic calendar, there is only one 1000 level course. Would this mean that my only required course is the one Intro to Linguistics? Or are there minor compulsory credits as well? I'm just confused as to how to complete this process lol, thank you",

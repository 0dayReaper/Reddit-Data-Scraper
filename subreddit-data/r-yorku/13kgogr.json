But no late days is pretty good. \n\nIf you can take 1013/1014 with a prof like Skelton or Sargent, I highly recommend them. There may be other good profs too, and that's a course that the prof matters, since most people don't really care for math as math. It's the difference between the same material feeling boring or feeling interesting.\n\n1019 is likely to be your hardest course, FYI. However, 1014 is probably #2 and can't be taken in the fall so I'm fine with the way it is even though it'll force you to get used to uni and fast.",

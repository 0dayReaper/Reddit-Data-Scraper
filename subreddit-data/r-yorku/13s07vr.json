And do you want to be a teacher? \n\n\n\nThe benefit of con-ed is as long as you meet the GPA requirement and the program requirements you are already admitted into the BEd program in year 5 and 6. \n\n\n\nOtherwise, if you still want to be a teacher, that means you'd have to apply as a consecutive candidate.",

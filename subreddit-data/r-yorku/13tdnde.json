    "postText": "Hello! I have previous history with learning Japanese, and because of this I\u2019ve reached a fairly decent level of the language. I don\u2019t want to retake Japanese 1000 or 2000 because I\u2019m 100% confident it will just be repeating information I learned a couple years ago. Is there any way I can bypass these prerequisites? Or do I have to take them. My goal is to try to get to Japanese at the 3000 or 4000 level",

But someone said they do, and now it has me scared because I\u2019ve called them a few times to ask for updates on my graduate application since I haven\u2019t heard back yet. Every time I\u2019ve called a new person picks up and my phone number is not listed anywhere on my application so I should be good, but I\u2019m just worried they\u2019ll think I\u2019m an agressive applicant which could affect my admission lol \ud83d\ude05.",

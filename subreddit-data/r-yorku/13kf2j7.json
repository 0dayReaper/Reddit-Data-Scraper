    "postText": "Hey everyone, created an anonymous account for this.\n\nRecently, I did an open book final exam for NATS1740 (2 page, single space, 9 questions), I copied a couple words from the textbook and was hit with plagiarism by my professor. The open book exam didn't require any citations - as the only source I should be using is my textbook.\n\nThe pictures attached below are the flagged sentences. The top picture is the textbook, and the bottom picture is my writing.\n\nFlagged sentence #1:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qr3usjbvmg0b1.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9f0963ca34d6fbe6e7f97b147149a7f68c0f65b9\n\nFlagged sentence #2:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cre4o51ng0b1.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8188c51e44ffc02e2250c3f20068b4be14407fb0\n\nThe instructions did say that **I cannot copy partial sentences from online sources or in class materials**. But for #1, Edwin's theory is a scientific publish, and for #2 the law of conservation of energy is stating a scientific principal/definition of a law. I know I shouldn't have copied from the textbook, but this level of scrutiny is some serious shit.\n\nI won't be facing academic honesty hearing, I had my final exam mark reduced to nearly zero. How do I argue my case? Any help is appreciated :&lt;",

In the event you use any source, especially in instances where you may be referencing an example, or a sentence verbatim, you still have to follow academic conventions and cite your source.\n\nA general rule of thumb is to always err on the side of caution and cite when you've used any source. A professor can never penalize you for citing a source even if it's on an exam (unless you were strictly asked not to use any additional source, including your class text), but they can penalize you for plagiarizing on one.",

            "comment": "Gotta cite bro. Even if you don\u2019t verbatim use the same wording (which you did), I still cite paraphrased ideas that are mostly not my own words. I see however you said \u201copen book no citing required\u201d.\n\nGotta at least change the wording man. Don\u2019t think there is anything else you can do but accept it and apologize, maybe stating \u201cI thought it was okay given we are doing open book and was stated that no citations are required\u201d\u2014 if that is the actual case. Perhaps they will afford you some degree of leniency if these are the only two examples and you explain your understanding of what was allowed.\n\nAlso assuming that these examples aren\u2019t the BULK of your answer for those questions, as that would literally mean your answers are just not even your own words at all. If these are only one or two sentences among 7-8 per answer then, it\u2019s still plagiarism but at a much lesser degree than plagiarizing the entire answer or entire document. Perhaps explaining your misunderstanding of the instructions and pleading that they only remove marks for the answers that were plagiarized, or for them to simply omit the plagiarized sentences and remark it as if they didn\u2019t exist. That seems more appropriate of a punishment than disregarding the entirety of the paper and getting essentially a 0% on it for what amounts to two sentences and a misunderstanding/mistake.\n\nA lot of course directors, especially in first year 1000 level courses, seem to be lenient with citations in my experience. At times one or two assignments (usually closer to beginning of the term, first few assignments) professors/TA\u2019s will remind students that they need to cite or have been citing incorrectly. This would also be plagiarism but is generally let go under the guise of it clearly being an accident or its due to a lack of information or ability to cite properly, which the prof/TA will then go over with the class. \n\nGenerally when the instructions are \u201cciting is not necessary/required\u201d, it does not mean \u201cplease don\u2019t cite\u201d but rather; citations will not be a part of the marking curriculum and there is no minimum amount or any other examination of citations beyond cases of possible plagiarism.\n\nI mean think of it this way. If everyone was to be allowed to verbatim use the answers from the textbook, why is it even open book/\u201cno citations\u201d in the first place? Why pose questions if everyone has and is allowed to use the exact same answer verbatim from the book? Well there isn\u2019t an answer to that question because students are not expected to copy the exact wording of the textbook they are referring to for their answers.\n\nPersonally, I would speak with them and do something like this: If this penalty means you fail the class, BUT you have no previous academic dishonesty cases, have not plagiarized previously in the class, I would plead for them to remark it without the plagiarized content and also be sure to apologize and explain that you were under the impression that there was no citations required for the open book final, and that you have no prior history of plagiarism nor have you, do you, or will you ever consider plagiarism, and that the success or failing of this courses credit lies entirely with this little accidental mistake that will invalidate all of the time, effort and money you have put into the course thus far.\n\nEven then, after explaining all that, the instructions did say not to even use partial sentences from the material so\u2026 it\u2019s a pretty tough argue. However it\u2019s also a pretty tough penalty to receive 0 marks for work that was not plagiarized entirely nor does the bulk of the content of your work rely on or consist of majority plagiarized content. \n\nJust talk with them, be super apologetic and NOT ARGUMENTATIVE but ensure that you are still explaining yourself, that you were unsure yourself of even using those sentences but was unsure how else to word a published theory, that you maybe should have reached out to them to ask a question (or maybe you couldn\u2019t because it was online and time based), and you were consciously aware that you aren\u2019t supposed to cite as the textbook was the only material. Some other fluff about how you don\u2019t have any priors so you\u2019ve never been accused of plagiarism, and some emotional appeal of \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before and now accidentally have done so, and because of this I am failing the entire credit and essentially discarding $715-1000+ for the course\u201d \u2014assuming you won\u2019t get the credit for failing this assignment. If you still pass the course, who fucking cares, C\u2019s get degrees.",

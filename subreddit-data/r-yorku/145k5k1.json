Provides a good indication that it might be reoffered the following summer as well. \n\nI've usually taken 15 credits during the summer and 33 and petitioned to take 36 during the year. \n\nDepends on your graduation goals and your ability to manage your course load.",

            "comment": "It really depends on the courses, the difficulty level of the course and professor, and how the courses are being graded (how many assignments, how many exams, etc). \n\n2021/2022, I took 30 credits for 5 courses each semester and it was fine. This is the normal full-time course load.\n\n2022/2023, I took 36 credits for 6 courses each semester. This is the maximum credits. I thought it would be harder, but it was quite manageable due to the structure of each course. Pretty comparable to taking 30 credits the previous year. \n\nThis summer semester, I am taking 12 credits / 4 courses. They are all full semester (no S1 OR S2 courses) so they run the typical 4 months. **I am fucking dying** even though it is 4 courses in one semester compared to the 5-6 per semester that I previously took.\n\nThis summer semester, one class has a ton of discussion posts, quizzes, essays, and two exams. In another class, the professor uploaded audio-only lectures. No powerpoints or other learning material. I gotta spend 3 hours typing out her audio lecture before I can even study the material since I am a visual learner and need notes to read.\n\nTL;DR....it's hard to give a one-size-fits-all answer. The amount of courses you take each semester isn't the biggest factor to how stressed and busy you will be, rather it's how much assignments/essays/exams each professor expects you to do for their class. This can make one class feel like it's 2-3 classes worth of work if the professor, or it can make one class feel like an elementary class.",

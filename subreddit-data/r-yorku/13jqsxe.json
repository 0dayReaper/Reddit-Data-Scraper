    "postText": "I was going to check on the enrollment module but it says that I need to complete my enrolment tutorial first. I had completed this around a week ago so I really have no clue why it would still be saying this (everything in it is completed but there's still no \"enrol now\" button like all the FAQ forms say). I get that I'm not supposed to be able to access the module before my appointment officially opens up, but the last thing I want is to go enrol in my courses and be blocked off by a tutorial that I had been long completed.",

There was no specific process I went through except that I was in heavy contact with the student success mentor for my faculty/college who, after hearing about the strange issue, went and gave the people at YU Start a heads up of the problem. It went away after that and I was able to do the enrolment questionnaire and **finally** submit most of my courses. Still gotta wait for permission for some of them. Overall, my advice would just be to contact your student success mentor as they should be able to sort it out.",

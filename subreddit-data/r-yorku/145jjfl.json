I also one one awful online class, where the Prof was laid off mid year (full year class) and replaced by another, and the entire class structure changed.\n\nHe would not communicate with us at all. He simply sent 7000 word long Microsoft Word documents as \u201cLectures\u201d. Ones that he made in 2017\u2026 when I took the class in 2021. Guy was literally getting paid to send us multiple years-old documents with no changes to them, while he sat at home drinking or something\u2026 can\u2019t even believe it to this day. Halfway through the F/W year, we were made aware of some issue he got in, and was removed, and taken over by another Prof who had no idea what we were learning and changed the entire structure of the course to start doing virtual zoom lectures and office hours.\n\nAnd they went on strike that same year iirc :) or at least threatened it. But the second prof, while all over the place, at least seemed to care and would communicate with us and put some good effort into making the course materials more digestible. It turned out to be a good class, if only for the second half of the year.",

You can also google their names, or google their names with \"reddit\" in the search bar to see what people on YorkU reddit may have said about them.\n\nOne of the worst professors I've ever had currently has a 4.5 on his Ratemyprof despite the fact that nearly every single individual in the groupchat for his course was expressing a disliking and confusion of his course and how he treated it.\n\nThe course title was one title and subject, but the course contents completely differed from the title/subject of the course, and as a result we all felt clickbaited and like we were misled.\n\nThe previous syllabus for the course laid out a completely different plan and material than what we went over and learned, as the Prof decided to rework the course into some woke afrocentric course about the global south ,colonization and imperial governance (literally not what the course was about at all nor did anything suggest it would be from the title and description/summary and previous syllabus)\n\nI am keeping it vague because I do not wish to verablly attack or out this prof, even though they did so to me and launched a complaint against me via the school system for asking if he would consider curving the grades up due to general student dissatisfaction with the course leading to predominantly lower grades on average. Again, a 4.5/5 on Ratemyprof.\n\nDespite my personal issues with this prof (and clearly his issues with me), I can say he was a *decent* prof. He was certainly very educated on his area of study, the online format of his course and eClass website was decent (for what it was), he was kind and understanding and would grant extensions, or acknowledge when the servers went down or due-dates were askew and would make modifications or extensions to the due dates, send out supporting documents to help students with essays and frequently asked questions that he was getting in his inbox, etc.\n\nBut he also literally didn't upload some lectures for some weeks (online course), and so we would do nothing until the following week, and suddenly have two lectures to deal with. Or he would promise to upload the lecture by the end of the day, yet we would see it by the end of the week instead.\n\nHe didn't show up for a total of 3 lectures in the year so we had 3 blank weeks and then 3 weeks where we were doing essentially two weeks of work/catching up. He also had guest lecturers to sub in for him on occasion (twice I think), and they LITERALLY had nothing to do with the course and just spoke about social issues and whatnot. I literally learned nothing about the title/subject of the course, because of how different the content was from what it was supposed to be.\n\nHe used to have a much lower ratemyprof rating, a lot of hateful reviews regarding his ambiguous assignment instructions and lack of actually teaching the course material in favour of teaching his own study and what he did his thesis on and whatnot. I am almost sure the professors are able to remove the reviews somehow or petition the website to do so, because not only was his score lower before, but he had reviews that came from the course I had from him, a complete failure of a course that he himself admitted to, yet there are no longer any reviews from that course code.\n\nMeanwhile, the greatest prof I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with, Professor Idil Boran, has a 3.4/5 on Ratemyprof.\n\nI took two courses that were \"too similar\" to each other, 1760 and 1770 are the codes. They are called \"exclusion credits\" because they are too similar to each other, so you can not earn the credit for both of them, there is no point in taking both of them and they teach almost the same things verbatim, just with different course leaders.\n\nI had not realized this until mid-way through the year, long passed the refund date. So I was enrolled in two courses but would only get the credit for one of them, despite paying $700+ for them.\n\nI brought this up to Dr. Boran, and she went out of her way to contact the necessary administration/dean, the course instructor for the other credit I was taking, the financial department/office of YorkU (not sure what it is actually called) and was able to give me the option of earning both credits, or getting a full refund for one of the courses of my choosing.\n\nShe also had a lot of one-on-one time with me because of this and was really helpful with her assignments, and she was genuinely one of the sweetest people I've ever met. And her course was actually interesting, she worked her area of study (I think something to do with Environmental Studies and sustainable energy) into a course that was otherwise not related to it, but in a good interesting way that actually provided a lot of useful insight and got me interested in her line of work, all the while teaching about her area of study still within the parameters of the actual course, so it was not off-topic and we were still learning what we paid for.\n\nIn summary: I wouldn't go off of Ratemyprof, for the reasons listed above. The best prof I've had has a full point lower rating than the worst prof I have ever had. I am almost sure professors can get the reviews taken down. I would try to google their name, and follow it up with \"reddit\" to see if anyone discussed it on here. Also, look into their YorkU or Linkedin profile, even their twitter. If they talk about \"social justice\", \"colonialism\", \"postcolonial theory\", \"third world approaches to law\", you can be sure they are going to force an agenda down your throat that is completely irrelevant to the course material. The prof I had a negative experience with has literally retweeted a post claiming there are 18 y/o white supremacists in classrooms and that instructors often know who they are. He tweeted this, during an ongoing complaint he filed against me with the school in which he claimed I would not have asked him to consider curving the grades up if he was a senior, white professor (which he is neither). Race card and victimizing himself for literally stealing money from us and robbing us the true experience and material of the course. This is the unfortunate reality of universities nowadays, and you need to be careful to avoid it.",

They taught mostly the same material, and both were pretty easy to follow. The prof I had for 1770, I can't recall his name, but his class was a bit more organized and formal, 1760 seemed a bit more laid back at times, and slower as we would spend a bit longer on some subjects than 1770 and have more discussion in class.\n\nI suppose the profs just taught differently and the curriculums weren't exactly the same, but both profs were good. I think both were decent classes, I can't really remember how 1770 was marked or any of the assignments before I was given the refund, but again it was pretty straightforward and easy to digest, pretty interesting class.\n\n1760 (so probably 1770 too) was like a \"logic\" based class, talks about logical fallacies, critical thinking and analyzing, how to make a real, valid argument that is logically sound. Idk stuff like that. A few essays, not very much maybe like 2-4 over the whole term (again, in 1760, dropped 1770).",

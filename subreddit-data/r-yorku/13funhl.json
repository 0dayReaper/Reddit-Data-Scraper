If at any point you fall below the cutoff each year, you will automatically get dropped from the Honours program to Bachelor\u2019s (90-credit). Then if you get your grades up to the cutoff, you will automatically be put back to Honours.\n\nIf your gpa falls below 2.5, you will be asked to take a year off. When you come back, you have to raise your gpa to at least a 4. If you don\u2019t. You will be barred for 2 years and or be kicked out of the program.",

For me, I ended up in a summer academic decision for my first 6 credits at university which means I had less than 24 credits and I needed to maintain a minimum of 4.0 GPA at the end of the semester. \n\n\nIn that semester I ended up with a 3.18 and was subsequently exited from Engineering and moved to an Ordinary BSc because I had less than 24 credits and was below 4. You need to check what the action would be in your circumstances. Unfortunately, it sounds like it would be the same as mine but I\u2019m not sure about Digital Media, this was the case in Engineering.\n\n\nThe way to escape it is to enroll into the summer courses before you get moved. Even if you get moved out of the program, as long as you enrolled before the decision then your enrolled courses are safe and you should use them to lift your GPA back up.\n\n\nI think you need to speak to Academic Advising to understand your options if an academic decision is made resulting a removal from the program. How do you get back? Do you get back in once your GPA is above 4? These are questions that you should ask the academic advising to be prepared.",

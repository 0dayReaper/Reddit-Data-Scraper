            "comment": "the school body IS mostly white, yeah and there are a good portion of the blonde barbies. as a white kid who comes from a big, diverse city up north, the aggressive whiteness was actually kinda off putting lmao. however, the school has a huuuge community of gay students. I'm a straight guy and most of my friends were gay, artsy, liberal arts type people. Flagler is actually typecast as kind of a weird, outcast type school and St. Augustine is a leftist island in the middle of a red county. you'll have no trouble finding your crowd.\n\ndon't know if this means much to you, but a tiktok recently blew up that labeled different FL schools as Euphoria characters. Flagler got Jules. Everyone on campus agreed it was accurate.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a Flagler undergraduate, as well as being a mixed dude who is fairly invisible somewhat. Ideally, there is a good diversity, however, people of the same look (you know what I mean) tend to stay in groups. Like those who are German, danish, and so forth may stick together. Whereas, those who come from other countries may stick together, and so on. However, no need to worry, it\u2019s all like high school but the big leagues. The social is great if you\u2019re an extrovert, but if you\u2019re an introvert, you may have a somewhat hard time (but hey you have discord). As for the group of people you mentioned, there is most likely a couple of those people here. I don\u2019t know everything, \ud83d\ude02! Nevertheless, it\u2019s better to go here than a university where making friends will be a lot harder around 15k+ people. There\u2019s also more girls than guys so I guess that\u2019s a win situation for you\u2026.anyways, any more questions?",

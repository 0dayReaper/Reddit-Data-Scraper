    "postText": "If so, do they allow trans people to dorm in the hall that accommodates their gender identity?\n\nWhen I went on the campus tour, I asked the guide if the college was trans-friendly and she said yes, but I forgot to ask if a transguy could dorm with a guy-- again, if the halls are gendered at all. I get that it's a private, liberal arts college so that's probably a yes, but I just have to be sure so I know what I'm getting myself into if they don't. \n\nReally nervous to ask because I don't know this subs demographic. If your going to be rude, call me delusional or tell me to kill myself, I've heard it all before thanks to Tucker Carlson and his cult of brainwashed mediaheads, so don't bother \ud83d\ude18",

Florida is a heavily 'red-state' with passionate citizens and it is likely your views will differ very greatly from those around you. Best wishes in finding your right college home!",

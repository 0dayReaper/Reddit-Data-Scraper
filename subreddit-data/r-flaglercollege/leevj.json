I know ghost tours are always an option but as a ghost tour guide myself I would rather stay away from that. So what activities does this town have for some Halloween fun?",

Some of my friends and I are going trick-or-treating, and if my \"This is my costume shirt\" has arrived by then, it'll be that and my mask as my costume. If it hasn't, I guess I'll just zip up my hoodie and wear my mask with that...\n\nI was also hoping to do a Halloween prank of some sort. Something along the lines of distributing pancakes or other goods to trick-or-treaters.",

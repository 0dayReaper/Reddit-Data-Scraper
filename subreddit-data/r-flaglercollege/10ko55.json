Their next meeting will be Tuesday, October 2nd at 8pm on the 2nd floor of the Ringhaver Student Center in one of the classrooms. All students are welcome to join us. We will be discussing our active campaign to extend the hours of the library especially on the weekends as well as possible future campaigns. Come out and help us change this school for the better!",

    "postText": "What do people think of an /r/FlaglerCollege meetup sometime soon? I don't know how many freshmen aside from myself are redditors who know about this subreddit, and there are only eight of us at the moment, but I think it would be good to have a meetup. When works for people? I know that I'm free tomorrow after 1515 and I'm free on Friday after 1800 and am free all day Saturday.\n\nSo, does anybody have any idea when we should do this?\n\nEdit: Out of curiosity, is anyone in the Student Center at the moment (9:09 PM on Saturday) who wants a meetup right now? I'm seriously pretty bored right now.",

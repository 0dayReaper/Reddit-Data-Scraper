    "postText": "Let's have another meetup next week on Saturday at noon. We should meet off-campus for this one, but still do it downtown. We could congregate in the Plaza de la Constitucion and then move on from there. Does this work for everyone? I'd like to see meetups happen every week, since our community isn't very geographically large. \n\n**Edit**: So tomorrow (Saturday) at noon, we'll all be at the Plaza, right?\n\n**Edit 2**: I guess not [](/foreveralone)",

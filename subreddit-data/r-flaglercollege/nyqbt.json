A few hundred DVDs, Netflix, and an HDMI cable for my laptop, you know, for any less-than-legally acquired stuff.\n\nDespite being in the media production track I take awful photos and videos! I try to write and I believe I'm terrible at it, though I've been told by a few people to minor in creative writing.\n\nI play video games pretty much all the time...I'm playing Skyrim as I type this response! 360 and PC, mainly, though I have a Wii that's been sitting in the closet collecting dust.",

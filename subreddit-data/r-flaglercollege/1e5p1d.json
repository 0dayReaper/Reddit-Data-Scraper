The school is so beautiful, downtown St Augustine is of course beautiful, and I heard Flagler has an awesome Psychology unit. :) I hope I will be able to go this Fall!\n\n\nI'll probably be living in a dorm so was wondering about things I should probably bring.",

            "comment": "2012 alum here. I miss this town very much because I come from a very populated area. Enjoy your time there and take some advice. I also made a thread to post this in, and hopefully with comments it will grow.\n\n1. Bring lots of underwear. They disappear.\n\n2. Get out of the dorms as fast as you can, but it doesn't hurt to stay for a year. There's plenty of affordable housing in Lincolnville (best spot) and St. Augustine Beach. Avoid West King unless u wanna live in the hood and hang with stinky drunk townies. \n\n3. Get to know your professors personally. You're at a small liberal arts school and you have that advantage. Take it. I highly suggest the economics/pre-law programs, as well as philosopy (I heard Dr. Marlow is great).\n\n4. The dining hall food is terrible and gave me the shits for a solid year. See #2 to solve this problem.\n\n5. A lot of people you will meet will not give a FUCK about going to class/learning. Don't be influenced by these bums. I met a lot of trust-fund hippies that don't give a shit and are fried out of their minds.\n\n6. On the other hand, GO TO AS MANY HOUSE PARTIES UNDERAGE AS YOU CAN. IT'S FUN AND YOU SHOULD HAVE FUN DOING IT. Just don't get blackout crazy drunk and be cool. \n\n7. Find close friends. People change and you might not expect to become close friends with someone you previously hated. Don't expect people to stay at Flagler for the four years you're there. \n\n8. Respect the locals. St. Augustine is a little sleepy town and there are quite a few men who own almost everything. Everyone knows everyone, but generally everyone is very friendly.\n\n9. Support and buy from the Lincolnville Farmers Market. Just shut the fuck up and do it no excuses. \n\n9. The townie kids are fucked up. Lots of dudes who are young full-blown alcoholics and reek of not having a shower for weeks. Think of permanent crust-punk hitchhikers. Respect them, don't hate. But I just tried to avoid them. \n\n10. The best bars are No Name Bar, St. Augustine Tavern, The Winery, Hatties, British Pub, Ann O Malleys, American Legion, Scarlett O Haras, Rendevous, and The White Lion. Or there's always The Gigglin' Gator. \n\n11. There's a lot of great food in St. Augustine. Check out O' Steens, Columbia, City Coffee, Carmelo's convenience store (a must go-to!), Schmagels, Mojo's BBQ, Casa Maya, many many more out there and it's always changing.  \n\n10. A lot of seniors and post-grads understand that St. Augustine is a \"black hole\" of a town. Try to leave as soon as possible after graduation or you will end up staying there bar tending or god knows what for months and possibly years. To say the least, there is very little future/upward mobility in the St. Augustine area. Jacksonville is the closest locale for careers if you plan to say in North Florida.\n\n\n",

I guess I won't be looking forward to an acceptance letter, ha. \n\n\nFor clarification, I fucked up and failed all of my classes when I was a freshman and sophomore because I was stupid and lazy I guess. I got my shit together junior year, found out I had ADHD and did all three years in one year, plus 2 extra credits. For the two years I made up I made rainbows of grades and my junior year I completed with As &amp; Bs. Found out I had clinical depression going into senior year ( So I probably wasn't just stupid and lazy in previous years, just unmotivated? ) , tried to do the best I could and graduated with As &amp; Bs and 1 D in math. \n\n",

If you've got a community college nearby and still really want to go to Flagler, I'd suggest knocking out some of your general education courses there. Keep your grades really fantastic for a couple of semesters, and try again! ",

This summer another student and I created a reddit-like website that is on its way to being a phenomenal student resource (currently at 1100ish student users).\n\nThe URL is [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) and it is a student-to-student networking site for sharing resources and getting study help from students all over who share your major and courses. There is also a news feed for each campus.\n\nWe have created a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgqCTrnb2Oo) for you to see what the website is all about before registering.\n\nAll you need to sign up is a .edu email address. As an avid user of the world wide web I know that this is a lot to ask so if you feel uncomfortable about giving that information away and still wanted to try out the site I will create you an account if you pm me or you can send me an email at jhamilton@openleaf.me\n\nHopefully those of you that try out the site will find it to be a good source of information at some point. We built the site with the theme of open-data and open-information in mind and promise not to do anything sketchy with your personal information.\n\nTL:DR [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) is an awesome student resource website that we built this summer and we won't sell your email address if you sign up.\n",

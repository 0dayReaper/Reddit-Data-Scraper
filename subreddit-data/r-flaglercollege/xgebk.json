    "postText": "So, I just learned that September 15 is the first annual College Reddit Meetup Day! I noticed there wasn't a meetup planned for Flagler, so I made one! We'd meet up in the Student Center at 5PM on September 15, but if anyone has a time that works better on a better date, then let me know and I'll update the RedditGifts page. If you're coming, please confirm that you are, and if you confirm, don't not show up!\n\n[Link](/http://redditgifts.com/meetups/flagler-college-meetup/)",

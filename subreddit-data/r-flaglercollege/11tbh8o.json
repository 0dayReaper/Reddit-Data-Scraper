    "postText": "The title says it all really. I recently went down to St. Augustine and had a swell time. Seeing Flagler was fairly enticing considering I'm still a junior in high school, trying to decide which college or university to attend. I'm wondering if any current/past students could provide some insight.\n\nIn the future I seek to be a photojournalist; I really enjoy photography, so I'm wondering how much the school might cater to that kind of student, beyond the listed majors. Also, the SGA and META clubs interest me a good bit. Any help is appreciated!",

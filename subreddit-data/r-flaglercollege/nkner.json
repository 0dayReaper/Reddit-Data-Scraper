    "postText": "I am a post grad art student so I know how important building a portfolio is, which is why I am looking for an aspiring photographer to employ the services of! When I used to do photography I remember how lame it was to do a wedding, but now I am on the other side because I am photographerless for my ceremony! \n\nA little info: wedding to take place on a weekend in St.Augustine. Will only be the two of us, and we just want the pics on a disc. Nothing fancy.\n\nShow me some of your pics and a website if you got it! I already have a few photographers to look at but I want to see what you guys got :)\n\nTldr: need photographer, show me your moves!\n",

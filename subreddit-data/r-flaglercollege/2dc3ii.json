    "postText": "GeoMed is a research project of the University of Vermont. We hope to understand why some people tend to gain weight and others stay thin. It may have something to do with the built environment (the buildings, roads, businesses, sidewalks, transit, etc.) right near your home or other environmental factors (eg: food proximity).\n\nTo help us sort this out, we are asking everyone to donate a little bit of data about themselves, including their home address, height and weight, and some details about themselves like exercise and overall health. It is completely anonymous. We do not need your name and will not share your individual responses with anyone!\n\nThe study is being conducted by a team of physicians and scientists. Find out more about us at : ( http://go.uvm.edu/geomedonline)\n\nOur survey can be found at : ( http://go.uvm.edu/geomed)\n \nThanks!\n",

Who still wants to meet-up? Maybe Thursday at 3 or 4? Some hours during the book buyback so everyone has more of a reason to come, haha. I know the first thing I'm going to do during break is play Skyrim until my face falls off.",

He said he was going home on Friday, and as long as I'm packed and ready to go by the time any meetup starts, I should be fine. ",

You have to use its specific resources to your own advantage though. Those being the smaller classroom environments, the Deaf Ed program, and opportunities for student involvement and activism.",

The hardest classes I had were the classes you have to take before you get into your major (Like History, English, math etc. Sports Management and Business are time consuming but not hard. I was a comm major and my hardest classes were Media Law and Journalism.. probably a few others that I can't think of off the top of my head but overall not difficult.",

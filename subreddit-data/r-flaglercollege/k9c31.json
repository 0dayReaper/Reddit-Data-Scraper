I don't know about anyone else, but I chose this college, not my parents. I think if they had it their way, I'd be at a state school. But, I mean, what's wrong with just going to see somebody? Is it so drastic to maybe set up a system that will allow student to meet up, but maybe have a curfew? I think it's the old school values of the board that keeps this rule in place.",

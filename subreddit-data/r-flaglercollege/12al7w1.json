There\u2019s also handfuls of professors who don\u2019t understand disabilities, refuse to educate themselves, and have a hard time giving accommodations. And at a smaller school like Flagler, a handful of faculty doing that makes up a larger percentage of the teaching staff than at a larger university. If you\u2019re needing anything beyond extra test time and early registration, just be prepared to face similar experiences. I loved my education and time in college, but they\u2019re not without their issues.",

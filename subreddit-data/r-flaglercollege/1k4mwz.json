    "postText": "So I'm a rising senior and I start my senior year in 9 days! I spent the entire summer college touring and the only one I really liked was Flagler College. To be honest I fell in love with it! I love the campus and the admissions directors were all friendly and helpful. Actually I've been e-mailing one of them like crazy with questions and what not, plus kiss up points don't hurt. I'm thinking of applying for early decisions and the thought of college itself is nerve wracking. I had a few questions I was hoping people who have actually gone/go to Flagler can answer. \n1: How would you say the \"feel\" of the environment is? \n2: Flagler is beautiful and fun to tour but is it a good college, do you all enjoy going to school there?\n3: How soon might I hear back from the admissions office as to wether I was accepted or not? \n4: Are there a lot of rules and are they a strict college? \n5: Would you recommend staying on campus past your freshmen year? \n6: I am really shy and I don't know anyone there. Is it hard to make friends up there? \n7: What would be one thing you wish you knew going into/applying for Flagler? \n8: What should I bring to school with me if I go up there? \n\nYou don't have to answer all the questions but anything you're willing to tell me or advice you're willing to give would be amazing. THANK YOU&lt;3 ",

The administration is a little out of touch, but I think that's typical of a lot of schools.\n3. I applied for early admissions in Sep-Oct and heard back in February. It's typical not to get letters until the Spring.\n4. They are more strict than a lot of school. It's a dry campus and they do not allow interdorm visitation (to keep boys and girl apart).\n5. Hell no. Get your own place as soon as you can. The food will be better, the freedom will be better and it's cheaper if you're paying your own way.\n6. It's a small college. You're going to have a lot of classes with the same people within your major. Your freshman roommates will likely become friends as well.\n7. I wish I knew how to study a little better. DO YOUR READINGS.\n8. They'll mail you a list of things you should be sure to bring. They'll also tell you what isn't allowed.  \n  \nI just graduated in April. I loved going to Flagler. What major are you interested in?",

Ugh I have like a million more questions and honestly the concept of being a senior along is overwhelming but at least I have my college picked out! Right now I am looking into a history, English, or political science. Do you know anything about these majors? What was your major in? ",

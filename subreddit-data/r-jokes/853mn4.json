Australia's best biologists from the Department of Native Bastards at the University of Woollomoloo have said that dropbears can be muzzled and caged. I'm not sure about the training bit (personally I doubt it and wouldn't let my kids near one). But I'm sure I'd rather have it on a lead than running free. Fair?\n\nIt's not like they kill enough people in the wild. Trying to tame them has failed before. But there's no reason to stop trying. The Federal Govt has spent enough dollarydoos to date. Why stop if there's a possibility of success?",

He also said these shootings happen all the time in places like the UK and Australia too. They just don't report them or they hide them.

They'll cozy it up with Biden just like they are on good terms with a lot of European leaders. It's in their interest to stay friendly with the US because of military commitments and arms purchases. Trump might go there for all I know, but they won't shelter him from anything.",

They had relatively narrow margins and there has been so much crazy, stupid, almost comically unbelievable crap that has happened since then as a direct result that a good chunk of people *had* to have changed their minds, right?\n\nAnd yet the UK had an election last year where Boris *expanded* his majority in Parliament, and Trump is seeing more support this year than in 2016. With record turnout it *might* not be enough to win, but whether he does or doesn\u2019t, the anticipated \u201cblue wave\u201d backlash to his presidency definitely didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAs much as I think we\u2019d both like to believe that there is an obvious, sensible option and that after four years of getting to see what crazy looks like up close, most people would recognize that at this point, it seems that that is not the case and that somewhere from 30%-50% of the population has decided that they not only like the crazy, but like it with a passion.\n\nThis is the status quo we have to live with not because we were dumped into this timeline by an unfortunate one-off quirk of fate but because there is a very significant number of people who genuinely want this no matter how insane that seems.",

I liked it so much, I got one for us too.\u201d\n\nThey went to sleep and then around three o\u2019clock in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and came back with a sandwich and a glass of milk.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said to the statue, \u201ceat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths\u2019 for three days and nobody offered me so much as a glass of water.\u201d",

The wife cheated on the husband with mr Smith, but the husband cheated on his wife with mrs Smith when mr smith walked in on them which when he had to act like a statue for 3 days without anything to eat or drink and felt sorry for mr smith having to act like a statue indefinitely without food or water. Hence why he brought mr smith something to eat and knew it was a disguise for a cheating wife as he had experienced the exact thing",

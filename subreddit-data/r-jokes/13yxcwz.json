Show me your passion!\u201d Exclaimed the professor.\n\nThe most passionate students take turns to do the same. Some hold their breaths. Others puke. All want to impress the professor by following his steps.\n\nAfter everyone is done. The professor says, \u201cGood job! You have shown me great passion, and that you want to become a real scientist, bravely overcoming the grossness and prejudices.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d the professor continues, \u201cy\u2019all need to work on skills, especially observing. I put my middle finger in the hole, but I actually sucked my index.\u201d",

                    "comment": "People just tend to group \"mumble rapper\", \"SoundCloud rapper\" and \"unskilled rapper\" together nowadays.  I think the most egregious example was Eminem calling MGK out as a mumble rapper on his Killshot diss track - the dude's been rapping since before \"mumble rapping\" was even a thing, and while I don't like MGK at all it's clear as day to anyone who's heard a track from him that he's at least sorta-kinda trying to spit when he's making songs **EDIT: Aside from his new EP apparently - I admittedly haven't heard any of it outside of Rap Devil**.\n\nI've actually come to understand that it isn't the fact that a lot of these new age rappers who are blowing up are \"mumbling\" that I don't like about them, because I can usually understand the vast majority of what they're saying.  It's the fact that the vast majority of what they're saying is pointless garbage with zero substance that's oversimplified to cater to the lowest common denominator of rap fans.  There's nothing to latch on to there for me.",

The wail of a passing ambulance is heard in the distance. In the middle of the room there is the profile of a thin, almost emaciated  man. He is of average height, and his balding head still clings to several dreads hanging down his thin neck. He is wearing baggy gray sweat pants, and a black sport shirt with the Adidas logo, of the style popular around 2018. His wrinkled skin is covered in many black tattoos, most illegible and smeared on the loose skin.\n\nThe camera slowly zooms in to his trembling fingers, holding a shoebox. He opens the lid and pulls out worn diamond grill. He says \"Uhhh....uhhhh. These used to be worth a lot before they was made in labs and give away at stores.\" A wistful grin appears across his weathered face, showing his bare gums. He continues on, \"I was dumb back then, before I was in for 5ifty years. Uhhhhh.\" The camera man doesn't correct him.\n\nSkip to closing scene. The camera man follows Mr. 6ix9ine into a small hallway bathroom, past peeling wallpaper. He leans over the running water into a pink porcelain sink, and begins to color his hair. He mumbles \"Uhhh. I used to think this maybe gonna be my year, 20 6ix9ine, uhhh. Uhhhh.\" The camera slowly backs out, steam clouding the mirror over the sink while \"Gummo\" plays.",

It is unopened but well over the customs limits and I'm afraid they'll confiscate it. Is there any way you could carry it through Customs for me? Hide it under your robes perhaps?\"  \n\n\n\"I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you, I will not lie.\"  \n\n\n\"With your honest face, Father, no one will question you,\" she replied.  \nWhen they got to Customs, she let the priest go first. The official asked, \"Father, do you have anything to declare?\"  \n\n\n\"From the top of my head down to my waist I have nothing to declare.\"  \nThe official thought this answer strange, so asked, \"And what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor?\"  \n\n\nFather replied, \"I have a marvelous instrument designed to be used on a woman, which is, to date, unused.\"  \n\n\nRoaring with laughter, the official said, \"Go ahead, Father. Next please!\"",

Took a wrong turn and instead of going in to the town to tank up, I accidentally crossed the border. By the time I saw the customs hut up ahead it was too late. I tried to reverse but the sirens came on and the Americans came out with their rifles. I told them what happened but they said I'm already over the border and they need to process us. Took an hour to toss the car and ask questions. When that was done we looped around to the CBSA booth. The Canadian agent was pissing herself laughing. She said it happens often. Called us idiots and didn't bother checking our passports.",

    "postText": "A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, \"Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink.\" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. \n\nSoon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, \"Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore.\" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. \"Look,\" she said, \"I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.\" \n\nEdit: I think it's bad that I'm more excited watching this get ups that I was about the whole of Christmas ",

He gets out to look and sees oil dripping out of the motor. He drives to the nearest town and stops at the first gas station.\n\nAfter dropping the car off, the penguin goes for a walk around town. He sees an ice-cream shop and, being a penguin in Arizona, decides that something cold would really hit the spot. He gets a big dish of ice cream and sits down to eat. Having no hands he makes a real mess trying to eat with his flippers. After finishing his ice cream, he goes back to the gas station and asks the mechanic if he's found the problem. The mechanic looks up and says \"It looks like you blew a seal.\"\n\n\"No no,\" the penguin replies, \"it's just ice cream.\"",

            "comment": "This was my grandfather's go-to joke. Very rarely could he get out more than one or two lines before my grandmother would slap him and make him stop:\n\n'Twas the Night of the King's Castration: the last of the Royal Balls was coming off. All the counts, discounts and no-'ccounts were sitting around the throne room slinging camel-shit, for in those days, bull-shit was as yet unknown.\n\nA noise was heard in the courtyard and in came Daniel on his gallant white steed, with his balls slung over his shoulder. \"What ho!\" cried the King. \"Ass-hole!\" replied Daniel, thus scoring an early point for the common people.\n\nAt this, the Queen dashed madly through the court with her drawers at half-mast, and her ass shining like a looking-glass in the moonlight.\n\nHilarious now, the King offered Daniel the post of second-in-command. \"But what of the Queen?\" asked Daniel. \"Oh, fuck the Queen!\" replied the King, and 50,000 loyal courtiers were killed in the rush, for in those days the King's word was law, and the King ruled with an iron hand.\n\nUpon seeing such mass slaughter, the King in exasperation exclaimed, \"Oh, shit!\"; and all 50,000 remaining loyal courtiers dropped their drawers and squatted on their haunches and strained and grunted in unison, for in those days the King's word was law and the King ruled with an iron hand.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried the Queen, thinking of the royal carpet. The King called \"Halt!\" and 49,999 loyal butt-holes snapped shut with a stately click, and 49,999 glistening turds were nipped, gently steaming in the morning air, all save for that of Daniel, who proceeded to lay one two cubits wide by one cubit high by three cubits long.\n\nThe King was sore affronted, and ordered Daniel thrown into the lions' den for three days and three nights, for in those days the King's word was law and the King ruled with an iron hand.\n\nAnd here was Daniel, in the midst of all those roaring, snarling beasts --- but of course, you could easily recognize Daniel by the large green parasol that he always carried.\n\nOn the first day, the Queen came unto Daniel and Daniel said, \"Oh Queen, I am in need of some tea!\" and the Queen asked, \"What manner of tea?\" Daniel replied, \"C-U-N-T!\" And the Queen departed.\n\nOn the second day the Queen came unto Daniel and Daniel said, \"Oh Queen, I am in need of some pills!\" and the Queen asked, \"What manner of pills?\" Daniel replied, \"NIP-PILLS!\" And the Queen departed.\n\nAgain on the third day, the King came unto Daniel, but it had come to pass that on the morning of the third day, Daniel had shat a great shit, and the lions were sore affronted. Almost all of them had thenceforth kept their distance from Daniel. But one of the lions took a liking to Daniel's left nut, and began to munch upon it. \"Oh, it tickles, it tickles!\" cried Daniel. \"What tickles?\" asked the King. \"TES-TICKLES!\" roared Daniel, thereby scoring another point for the common people. Upon hearing this, all the ladies in the courtyard took out their tits and tittered.\n\nThen the lion crouched as if to spring, but instead laid a big turd. This amused the King, and he ordered Daniel to come forth, but Daniel slipped on the lion's turd and came fifth, thus utterly losing the race. This angered Daniel so greatly that he picked up the lion turd and, with menacing accuracy, hurled it at random. Random, being a crafty little bugger, ducked, and the turd hit the King full in the eye.\n\nNow, this made the King exceedingly angry, whereupon he inquired, \"Where's the Queen?\" \"Milord, she is on the Royal Crapper.\" \"And is she well-supplied with paper?\" \"Milord, she has forty reams of the finest linen.\" \"It is good,\" said the King. \"And where's the Princess?\" \"Oh, she's upstairs in bed with laryngitis.\" \"Not that fucking Greek again!\" cried Daniel.\n\nThis amused the King and he spake, \"Oh, fuck the Princess!\" and another 40,000 loyal courtiers were trampled to death in the rush, for in those days the King's word was law, and the King ruled with an iron hand, and besides, the Princess was a comely wench. This made the King exceeding angry, but the Queen only said, \"Well, I'll be fucked!\" --- more in hope than in indignation. But nobody moved, save a solitary senile seneschal, quietly masturbating in a corner into a silver teaspoon, and Daniel, who, taking her at her word, grabbed the Queen by her butt-cheeks and slipped her onto his dick like a well-worn jackboot.\n\nLater in the evening the King entered the Royal Boudoir and beheld the Queen lying on the bed, clad only in Nature's attire. \"Roll over, Queen!\" ordered the King. \"I'll be fucked if I will!\" shouted the Queen. \"You will at that,\" observed the King, \"but you'll be corn-holed if you won't!\" Hearing this, the Queen shat a gold brick, for in those days a square ass-hole was a symbol of royalty.\n\nWhen the King saw this, he cried, \"Balls!\"; not because he had to, but because he had two. And the Queen replied, \"Balls!? If I had two, I could be King!\"\n\nWhereupon the King, having partaken of over-ripe olives, hied himself to the innermost part of his kingdom and proceeded to shit buttermilk for three days, and thereafter was forever known as King Dairy-Ass, throughout the world.\n\nBlaming Daniel for his digestive discomfort the King sentenced Daniel to wander in the wilderness for forty days and forty nights, for in those days the King's word was law and the King ruled with an iron hand.\n\nAnd so it came to pass that Daniel wandered in the wilderness for many a long day and many a long night. But in the evening of his thirteenth day in the wilderness, Daniel was set upon by bandits! Not, as you might at first surmise, ordinary bandits, but Mexican bandits. Nor, as you might at second surmise, ordinary Mexican bandits, but Mexican bum-bandits, who debagged him, scragged him, and shagged him, and left him with his pockets jingling, and his ass-hole tingling.\n\nMonths went by before the Queen came unto Daniel. \"Oh Daniel, I am heavy with child. What steps are to be taken?\" \"Fuckin' big ones!\" replied Daniel as he vanished over the Southern horizon. ",

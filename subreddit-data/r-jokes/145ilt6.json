    "postText": "Within a few months his\r business grows to the point where he needs to hire two\r employees.  He hires a woman named Sarah and a man named\r Jack.  Things are good.\r  \n\r  \nA year goes by and the little company's sales are sagging.  The owner realizes that there is not enough work\r for his two employees and that he must let one of them go.\r But which one?  Both Sarah and Jack were excellent\r employees in every respect.\r  \n\r  \nTormented by the decision, the owner asks a friend for\r advice.  His friend says \"When you go in\r  \ntomorrow, watch them both, and fire the first one to take\r a break.\"\r  \n\r  \nSo the next day the owner is watching his employees.\r Sarah seems to be having a headache - her brow is furrowed\r and she's massaging her temples.  She gets up and\r goes to the medicine cabinet for an aspirin.  The owner sees this as a break, and while he hates to do it, this is the signal he was waiting for to make his arbitrary call.  \n\n\nThe owner walks over to her and starts out, \"Sarah, I'm afraid I'm going to have to lay\r you or Jack off.\"\r  \n\r  \nIrritated, she replies, \"Can you jack off?  I have a headache.\"\r  \n",

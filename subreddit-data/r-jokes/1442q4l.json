    "postText": "  \nThe Indians on a remote reservation in Oklahoma asked their new chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild:  \nSince he was a chief in modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.  \nNevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.  \nBut, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked. \"Is the coming winter going to be cold?\"  \n\"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold.\" The meteorologist at the weather service responded.  \nSo the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared.  \nA week later, he called the National Weather Service again. \"Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?\"  \n\"Yes.\" The man at National Weather Service again replied. \"It's going to be a very cold winter.\"  \nThe chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find.  \nTwo weeks later, the chief called the National Weather Service again. \"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?\"  \n\"Absolutely.\" The man replied. \"It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we've ever seen.\"  \n\"How can you be so sure?\" The chief asked.  \nThe weatherman replied. \"The Indians are collecting a shitload of firewood\"",

Anyways the version I heard was similar insofar as the overall point it sends across, but somewhat funnier in my opinion.\n\nThe shaman dies and his son doesn't know the rituals and the magic used to predict the weather. The tribe asks him and he keeps ambiguously telling them to collect and they're getting sick and tired. Eventually, for fear of being lynched, he ventures down to the meteorological tent in a white man's settlement close by. He inquires about the coming winter and they tell him something along the lines of \"Are you crazy? It's gonna be a hell of a winter, didn't you see the wood the Indians gathered?\"",

Jan-Mar is the coldest consistently and it's 40mph 40 degree (or lower) wind, no snow and everything's grey and dead and ugly. But then we'll get random 60 degree days in Feb which makes the tulips and daffodils start to bloom.\n\nFunny joke prior to 2000, but it just doesn't hold up today. \n\nWhile OK does have some extreme poverty, especially in the rural and Native American communities, they're not so bad off that they're using a pay phone to call the NWS center in Norman.

Like children, we don't learn what is or isn't acceptable if you don't say so and we can't learn to do better next time because we don't know what better is.  I mean I'm doing pretty good for growing up in a state that's now bottom 5 in the country in education... OK is last in everything good and first in everything bad lately and it's really sad to see. I'm doing my best here just like everyone else (I assume).\n\nOr you're just fucking with me and I'm supposed to do what with that?",

You're not likely to offend many people, but \"First Americans\" is becoming more common, at least in formal contexts (see First Americans Museum in OKC. The term \"Indian\" is never in the museum used unless quoting).\n\nThat's cool that Cherokee is still alive. Choctaw as a first language is pretty much gone now, but there are younger people learning it just to keep the language alive. I helped document interviews with the last surviving original enrollees a few decades ago, and the a few did speak Choctaw as a first language, but they were ancient.",

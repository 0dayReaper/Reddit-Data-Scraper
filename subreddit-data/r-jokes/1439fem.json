The mainstream media is desperate for a horse race to report on, and have been breathlessly hanging on his every word in a desperate attempt to inject some viability into his campaign.\n\nIt's the same irresponsible ratings-chasing behavior that eventually led to a Donald Trump being viewed as a legitimate candidate in the eyes of enough people to become president. It does not matter if the news is making it completely obvious to anyone with a brain that the person they're doing the story on is an immoral idiot -- if enough immoral idiots are in the audience, they're going to see the fact that someone is \"on TV\" and nothing else and assume it means legitimacy.\n\nI really wish political media stopped trying to stir up shit storms out of nothing. There should be more than enough drama right now that they should have non-stop things to report on.",

RFK Jr regrettably has name recognition and has demonstrated some strength in the polls. He is NOT qualified for office and may (perhaps should) be considered irrational, delusional and flat out dangerous when considering how ignorant and easily led a significant portion of the voting public is.  The media certainly didn\u2019t get tRump elected, a bunch of idiots at the ballot box did; if the media had that power FOX would have ensured him a second term.  The media can only nudge at the margins as was the case with HRC - it is fair to say a few people were discouraged from voting for her because of news coverage.",

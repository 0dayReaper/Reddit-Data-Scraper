Instead of celebrating how far we've come in closing the gap and focusing on what it takes to finish the job, people put effort into it like no progress had been made. Perhaps women aren't negotiating wages because they think there's no way to, on the pretense that women just don't make as much. It blows my mind that we can all agree that employers will cut costs everywhere to save money by sacrificing the world or humanity, yet somehow not see the opportunity in the wage gap and think, \"all I have to do is hire an all female staff and save 21% on labor?\" They don't because it's not true.",

As a women I liked the fact that it was poking fun at both genders. But I see lots of people here using this as an excuse to trash women. \n\nWhat is happeninnnng?? I'm a woman and I'm a damn good negotiator. I work in sales and have a great resume. I recently found out at my last job my male coworker made more than me with years less experience and significantly worse negotiation skills. Must be a fluke..even though it's happened at many jobs before. I pushed for every single raise/promotion/starting salary- it wasn't for lack of trying or expertise. \n\n**My point:**No one is saying that women that work less or in inferior positions should be paid the same as men in higher positions with higher output. That is not the argument. If all things are equal- pay should be equal. And it's not- at least not in my industry. So downvote the shit out of me. But please don't change the argument. Equal pay has to do with equal work- not women being victims and getting more for doing less. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso- there are shitty men and shitty women. Humans are garbage- we can all agree there.",

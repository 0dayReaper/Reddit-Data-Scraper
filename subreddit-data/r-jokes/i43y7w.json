The winners got big trophies, and everyone else got small ones that labeled their finishing position like 2nd or 3rd etc. not to make them feel good but to commemorate that season and the teams and friends they had. Most of these kids are barely 8 years old and when they\u2019re 50 this trophy might be the only thing that reminds them of these years. The consolation prize isn\u2019t the trophy, the prize was the big party for everyone at the end of the year. The trophy is the keepsake",

Here's the thing, my parents are in their 60s.\n\nSo anybody that's under 70 talking about how we're the participation trophy generation, never admits that it's *their* generation that gave them out.

As studies show that schools have gotten harder over time..\n\nthe economy was booming with brand new sin job sectors so they literally had jobs just waiting for them right out of college..\n\nthey were also the first generation where are majority of them actually went to college so all the employers where extra impressed by their qualification is making it easier to get hired..\n\ninflation was much less I'm so the price of things compared to the average wage was much more equal houses for cheap to the point. A husband and wife both working minimum wage could actually afford a decentt life\n\ncompared to you. If you wanted to buy a brand new car instead of a used one you would have to be making 80k per year and it would still be a major purchase that many people would second-guess their ability to affordd\n\nand if you're in the upper income bracket making 100K per year it would take you many many years to save up for a house. \n\nand if that   you would be in that top 10% of income. meaning 90% of Americans earn less than thatt",

I feel like I missed most of these benefits of being a boomer. I've worked 2 jobs at least half of my life. At least it's paying off a little now.\n\nI really feel for those starting out. Everything is stacked against you. If you go to college and get a degree, you are gonna be $25 - 50k in debt so someone can offer you $8/hour like they are doing you a huge favor.\n\nStill, keep at it. There isn't much alternative right now. Hopefully if you apply yourself, you will be ready and able if/when something better comes along.\n\nGood luck.",

I am from Europe so my situation might be different, also apologies for my English (not my native language as you can see). I am 50 and doing well now. To be such, I served in the military, graduated 2 times at the college (once in economics and once in law - yes in Continental Europe law requires a full 5 years college degree for which I paid while working as an accountant) and eventually became a lawyer.  First time I could afford something more than a 1 room studio as housing was when I was 30.\n\nMy question is: is the generation before mine (or my generation) reaping all the benefits or is it somebody else?  Because when I was young and going to school, wealth was not so concentrated in the hands of so few. I mean, where all the money we are talking about went? To me? I don\u2019t believe so.  To my dad?  Definitely not so. Yet, I see people like Zuckerberg, Gates and Bezos, to name a few, who amassed gazillions that they will never be able to spend in thousands of lives.\n\nSo, who reaped this new generations\u2019 expectations? My dad who was born in a house bombed down by mistake by the Americans during WW2 and or some multi billionnaire who amassed a significant percentage of all the existing money in the world?\n\nAnd who gave these few people all this money? Me or my dad who do not even have a Facebook account?  Not really.  Or somebody else?  And if so, who?  Sort of an open question, really.\n\nHow much is an Amazon worker paid?  How much Amazon gains?\n\nI don\u2019t believe this is a generational problem.  To me, this seems like capitalism gone wild and young generations pushed to believe that their (objectively unfair) condition (I have a child and I can and I do relate) is the fault of the previous generation, while, maybe, the cause of this can be traced somewhere else and not in the past but now.\n\nMy view and not even definitive. More a food for though than a view actually. And sorry for the long post. As they say, I did not have the time to be short.\n\nAlso: good joke. I liked it a lot",

There are periods in which life can be easier than others, but historical trends are much more complex.  \n\nFrankly, and I can be of course wrong, I don\u2019t believe that old generations reaped the benefits of younger ones. I tend to believe that digital economy, deregulation and globalisation moved towards an increase in concentration of wealth.\nThis can be good or not depending on how one looks at it, but sure enough it means that more and more people have been left behind.\n\nAlso, the pace of innovation has accelerated dramatically, so that what one learns during college it mostly obsolete after 10 years or less.  Jobs change accordingly. What hits me most is that my dad did less or more the same job for all his life, the only big change was when he was promoted to an exec position. In my career, I have to reinvent my job every 5-6 years or so just to remain on the market and I consider myself lucky if I compare myself with a friend of mine who secured a nice job at a bank and got laid off at 50 because his job (bank teller) simply disappeared because of e-banking.

Dash gets into a foot race with his classmates, and the second-fastest classmate (let's call them Alex) will never be able to beat him, because superpowers. Does second place invalidate all the training and hard work that Alex put in? Does first place mean anything to Dash if he can just tap into the Speed Force? \n\nSometimes you will genuinely work your ass off, and put in all the hours, and somebody else will be simply more talented. Sometimes you won't get an A, or a gold medal, or the promotion. And that's okay! As long as you worked hard and treated people fairly, with respect, that should be what matters.",

Mere talent gets outpaced really quickly.  I get beat by people who put in even more work or time just as hard as me AND were talented.  The talent might give them an edge over me, but it's the work.  \n\nSaying 'simply more talented' also under rates the work talent people put in.  I know a guy who is really good at drawing, and I could say he's talented. But he has invested hundreds of hours into drawing at this point, so it is really talent or just hard work and practice?\n\nWhen I suck at something and spend hundreds of hours to get gud, it's a little sad when it gets dismissed as just talent.",

For little kids they know if they win or lose (even if you are not keeping score I promise you they still are). They like the feeling of just getting a trophy, medal, ribbon or whatever and it makes them beam with excitment.\n\nI continue to emphasize why we play sports and the right away to approach playing sports, and I know kids prefer to win, but now I see that a participation trophy also encourages effort and can help younger ones to strive to be better so I think in the right situation they can be beneficial for the psyche of a young child.",

I didn\u2019t talk about winning, I just went in and crushed everybody all the time winning dozens of state championships and regional competitions, being at the top of every graduating class, and succeeding with ease in everything I ever attempted- I didn\u2019t really have friends and never figured out how to make friends because I was so interested in the mechanics of how things worked that I just skipped over caring about how people feel and I didn\u2019t invest in friendship at all.\n\n13 years removed from college, it\u2019s clear that the only currency the world runs on is relationships and referrals, and exceptionalism is functionally useless if you can\u2019t get your foot in the door with a relationship.  The quality of your work hardly matters, the game didn\u2019t matter, only the friendships mattered and the real gem was the process of hard work to craft excellence from nothing (hard work which I didn\u2019t really learn to do until much later because everything came so easily and naturally).\n\nThat\u2019s what they were clumsily trying to teach us with participation trophies- winning is useless and fleeting, building friendships and connections with people is the real value of competition.",

They all still went on to be one of the top 1-3% of their sport. \n\nThen you have athletes in the special olympics who get medals and we reward their courage, their commitment. \n\nParticipation trophies are not about winning. It's recognition that the athlete stuck it out for the time period and hopefully gave a good effort. The irony, and I've seen it, is that the parents most likely complaining about participation trophies are also the ones that will stack a team at 6YO REC soccer/football.\n\nUntil about age 11 and older, the best athletes are mostly early developers and ones born in the earlier months of the year or registration period. It's called the relative age effect. Being born in January vs November confers a huge advantage (10 more months of growing) to the kid who was born earlier.\n\nThe drop out rate for athletes in the USA is 70% by age 13. So right as the relative age effect is petering out, those kids are out of ALL sports already. \n\nSo for the most part all \"real trophies\" are rewarding is an early birthday and other conferred advantages (like a parent being a good coach).",

With a few famous exceptions they've got mentors and good family lives and support structures. Trophies aren't for them, they're for the spectators. \n\nNow let's talk about a born loser. A kid who's mom and dad are split, or worse they're together but they drink heavily and when they're not drunk they're working. The kind of person who didn't really want kids but had them anyway because that's just sorta something you do. \n\nFor those kids they've got fuck all self esteem. They get little to no positive reinforcement in life. And when they get home every failure is amplified and every success downplayed. \n\nPretty soon they learn to give up. They don't just stop trying to win, they don't get lazy per se. It's way more insidious. \n\nThey start to sabotage themselves. Ever know somebody who seems to always make the dumbest choices? They're not just dumb, they're conditioned to failure. To think of themselves as a failure. When you spend your whole life being told what a failure you are you start to expect it. To work towards it. \n\nSo they get a few dumb stars &amp; trophies they didn't \"earn\". It helps them along. Maybe even keeps their dad's backhand off 'em for a bit. \n\nThe American right wing doesn't like this though, because they love people like that. They can be bullied into working long hours for low pay. And cheap labor is what they're all about.",

When you are trying to tell a person how to spell something, what people do is take each sound, and add hyphens.\n\nThe dude was just clarifying how it's spoken in case someone didn't know. For example, a person reading your pronunciation as \"Musul Man\", which would make sense to an English speaking audience who have \"Man\" as an ending to many things.",

Muslims don't want violence. They want you to submit to Islam, and then there would be no need for violence. They aren't chosing violence. You're chosing violence by not submitting. This isn't even a secret. There are many, many interviews with hundreds of Imams saying the exact same thing. The only people lying to you about that are western media.",

Could you put my wife on the phone?\" asks the husband\n\n\"No, she's busy having sex with someone in the room upstairs,\" replies the maid.\n\nEnraged, the husband tells the maid that if she kills both the wife and the other man, she'll be given 3000 dollars.\n\nThe husband hears the screams and the sounds of a struggle upstairs, and then the maid comes back down to the phone.\n\n\"Okay, now dump the bodies in the pool,\" the husband instructs.\n\n\"What pool?\" the maid asks, in confusion.\n\n\"Whoops, wrong number.\"",

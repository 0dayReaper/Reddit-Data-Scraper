I remember reading a story in it that had clowns, a children\u2019s party, marijuana, cocaine, pedophilia, and bestiality. How in the hell it made it past censors and into a national magazine is beyond me. It had something about a magic show in the title &amp; characters named Dr. Fun &amp; Mr. Frog I believe. If you google it long and hard you may be able to bring it up, but be prepared. It may scar you for life.",

In fact, for a LONG time, if anyone found out you ever did gay porn, you would be permanently blacklisted from the straight industry entirely (this was back when people thought hugging a gay person would give you AIDS)\n\nMaybe some guys did \"solo\" gay porn (playing with themselves in front of a camera meant for an audience of gay men), but if you ever actually performed with another man, you would never work again in a cis/straight space.\n\nIt's starting to change now, but it's a slow process. There are still a lot of female performers who refuse to perform with any man who has ever done gay porn.",

I may not tell it right, but it goes something like this:\n\nAn old man goes to the bar. He sees an attractive young woman sitting by herself. He walks over to her and says, \"You are absolutely gorgeous. Can I buy you a drink?\"\n\nShe agrees, and the two of them have a conversation. He says, \"You know. You remind me a lot of my late wife before she passed. I have been rather lonely for the past few years.\"\n\nShe gives him a pat on the back, and is like, \"Oh I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n\nThen he says, \"You know, I'm not long for this world. The wife and I never had kids. I don't have anyone to leave my vast fortune to. I am a millionaire. I will give you a million dollars to spend the night with me.\"\n\nThe young woman is a college student on hard-times, and she thinks it over for a moment. Then says, \"Yea, let's do it!\" as she fantasized about paying off her student loans, buying a a house and car.\n\nThe old man then pulled out a $20 bill, and said, \"How much action will a 20 get me?\"\n\nShe looks offended and says, \"Hey, what kind of girl do you take me for!?\"\n\nHe says, \"Well, we have already established that now haven't we. I'm just bargaining.\"",

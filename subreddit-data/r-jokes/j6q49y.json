But if you\u2019re a foreign student in canada tuition is like ~$17000 a semester or something.

It's visible to me and to my son. But at the user end - the students - it's just not a great experience. It's not terrible, but it's also not nearly as engaging or stimulating or effective as lectures, tutorials, labs, design contests and so on in a live setting. We decided to go ahead with his first year education, knowing what his university and profs are doing to make it work. A lot of time and effort. But he's going to come out of it with less learning, understanding and even interest in his courses than a typical first year student. Not the uni's fault, not his fault, just this shitty situation this year.\n\nThought I would pipe in with - some of us can see what's happening this academic year. But it's still a sub-par learning year. And I do indeed hope that profs are putting in extra time to make it work, because students are as well, while also getting less for their tuition. Challenges and sacrifices all round until we rid ourselves of this virus.",

I know colleges are struggling to balance all this while trying to keep student, faculty and staff safe. Her college kicked 6 kids out within first 2 weeks for not following the agreed terms to remain on campus.\n\nI am just to the point where I am so fucking angry that because of poor decisions by some people. We knew this could happen if we didn't follow certain recommendations and it happened. I am angry because my kid and so many others aren't getting another part of college which is learning to really be on your own, make decisions (either good or bad) without mom and dad being there, and having some fun. \n\nI just have lost my sense of humor over the whole situation. As the year progresses and nothing seems to get better. I know there is nothing magical about the year actually ending but at least it may give me a mental and emotional reset.",

For universities in the US, you have the public universities (or state schools as some call them), which get part of their funding from state taxes, and the private universities (harvard and the likes). \n\nUniversity of California, Berkley, is one of the more expensive public universities. [Here is their tuition/costs](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/cost). Yup, you read that right, that's **17k/year in tuition alone.**\n\nLets find a more middle ground school, let's say university of california, riverside. [Here are the costs](https://admissions.ucr.edu/cost). yes, that's right, a middle ground school which noone aspires to go to is **11k**/year in tuition alone.\n\nOkay, maybe i'm deceiving you, it is california after all. Lets go to the midwest, in this case let's try Nebraska's main university, the University of Nebraska. [Ahh that's better](https://admissions.unl.edu/cost/) middle of nowhere school, even though it is a good school, will cost you **~$10k** in tuition and fees alone.\n\nLet's try this one more time, University of Nebraska, Lincoln is the big university in Nebaska, lets go to one of its less reputable schools in Nebraska. [Here are the costs](https://www.unk.edu/costs.php), but now, you are in the middle of nowhere (no offense to nebraskans), at a school which even i didn't know existed until now., and yes, you still pay **~9k** in tuition and fees.\n\nNone of the costs i mentioned include housing, foods, books, equipment needed for some of the courses, etc. That is just the cost to be able to sit in class.\n\nIn the US, there is nothing like free for the public. The closest you get in community college, where you can only get a 2 year degree from, and that usually has some associated cost to it, but usually very very cheap if you live in the area.\n\nAlso note, none of those costs are out of state students, i.e., if you lived in New York and wanted to go go University of California Berkley, that 17k tuition is now **$40k**\n\nOf course there are plenty of scholarships to be had, given out by both the school and companies, and the like, but the # of scholarships compared to the number of students is nowhere close. Which is why it isn't unusual to find people with 100k+ in student loan debt upon graduation (and sometimes, without even graduating).",

I had to go back home and get a needle and enough thread to sew it back together and that\u2019s why I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\nThe third said \u201cAfter it rained this morning I heated water to bath with but my mum thought it was too hot and added water to cool it. I had to sit and physically pick out each drop of the water I heated from my bucket. That\u2019s why I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\nThe fourth remained silent until the teacher asked \u201cSo why were you late?\u201d He responded \u201cHmm, I spent a lot of time searching but didn\u2019t find enough rope to tie their stories together.\u201d",

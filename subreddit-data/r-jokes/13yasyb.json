    "postText": "I brought it home and unpackaged it. I carefully read the instructions, ran my hand over the material. It was a strange feeling. I didn't expect I'd ever reach the point of using one. I fiddled with it a bit, then checked the hole. The thing was wide enough for my whole arm! But I inflated it anyways, and finally got the action going.\n\nIt was weird at first, a strange sensation, I felt my body pulsing. But I soon got the hang of it. Finally, a minute later, it was all done. I carefully deflated it and put it back in the box. I'll use it again tomorrow. The doc told me to take regular readings from this blood pressure monitor.",

The judge looks sternly at the ex wife.\nJudge: \"Why do you think you deserve custody of the child?\"\nEx wife: \"I brought him into this world so I should have custody of him.\"\nJudge: \"That is a simple yet good reason.\"\nThen the judge looks towards the Ex husband.\nJudge: \"Why do you think you deserve custody of the child, sir?\"\nThe ex husband thought long and hard about his response, after a brief moment of silence, he replies, \"If I put money into a Pepsi machine and a Pepsi comes out. Is it mine or the machines?\"",

Then comes the real work where women typically do 60-70% of the share of child rearing and household work and that is in westernised cultures.\n\nSo tell me again about the father\u2019s effort, lol.",

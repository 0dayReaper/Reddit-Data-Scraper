    "postText": "...sits down at the bar, gets a drink, and then begins poking at the palm of his hand before holding it to the side of his face and having a conversation with...apparently no one...for several minutes.\n\nThe bartender's weirded out by this, so he approaches the man as soon as his 'episode' is over and says, *\"Hey buddy, I don't know what's up with you, but this is a rough neighborhood and I don't want any trouble.\"*\n\nThe guy looks over to the bartender and replies, **\"Oh, I don't think you understand! You see, I'm very high-tech. I had my cel phone installed directly into the palm of my hand.\"**\n\nThe bartender gives the guy a skeptical look as only a rough-neighborhood bartender can give one, but the guy says, **\"Here, let me show you,\"**; he pokes at his hand a couple more times and holds it to the bartender's cheek - to the bartender's surprise, he hears someone on the other end, and the two of them carry on a conversation for several minutes!\n\nWhen he's finished, the bartender beams at the guy and says, *\"Wow, that's amazing!\"*\n\n**\"Isn't it great?\"** Replies the guy. **\"I can always get in touch with my wife, my broker, you name it, and I never have to worry about it being lost or stolen!\"** Suddenly, he starts looking uncomfortable on his barstool. **\"Uh, hey, could you tell me where the restroom is around here?\"**\n\n*\"Sure, it's out back, it's a freestanding shack kinda thing,*\" Says the bartender as he hands the guy a key. *\"Remember to be careful out there!\"*\n\nThe guy thanks him, gets up and heads out back. 5 minutes go by...10 minutes...15 minutes...20...eventually the bartender starts to worry on behalf of his bizarre new customer, neighborhood being what it is, so he grabs a spare key and his Louisville Slugger from under the bar, and heads out back to the restroom. \n\nHe knocks on the door a few times, and after not hearing any reply, he enters...to find the guy spread-eagled against the wall, with his pants pulled down to his ankles, and an entire roll of toilet-paper shoved up his butt.\n\n*\"Ohmygod!\"* Cries the bartender. *\"Did they rob you?! Are you hurt?!\"*\n\nThe guy looks back at the bartender and says, **\"Nono, it's okay! I'm just waiting for a fax!!!\"**",

They\u2019re like an evolution of strip clubs. You pay to get in at the door, you pay extra for personal dances, and if she spends some time w/you and you get to know her, you send her a little tip because you want to know her time is worth it to you.\n\nBut DM invites to pics are like the dancer flirting a little with you. It\u2019s not a serious \u201cI need you to make me feel needed\u201d vibe, it\u2019s more like \u201cif you\u2019re not doing anything later and maybe you could use some company\u2026\u201d",

            "comment": "Please BE WARNED! Over the last month I have become a victim of a clever 'Eastern European' scam whilst out shopping.\n\nHere's how the scam works:\n\nTwo very good-looking 20-21 year-old girls of eastern European origin come over to your car as you are packing your shopping into the boot. They both start cleaning your windscreen, their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T- shirts. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they'll say 'No' and instead they ask you for a lift to another supermarket. You agree and they both get in the back seat.\n\nOn the way there, they start undressing, until both are completely naked. Then, when you pull over to remonstrate, one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over your lap, kissing you, touching you intimately and thrusting herself against you, while the other one steals your wallet!\n\nI had my wallet stolen on September 4th, 9th,10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 24th and 29th. Also on October 1st, 4th, 6th, 9th and 10th and twice yesterday.So please warn all the older men you know to be on the lookout for this scam.\n\nThe best times seem to be just before lunch and about 4:30 in the afternoon.",

Enamored with her, he asks if he can have sex with her. Naturally, she says no, and gets off the bus. The man goes to the bus driver and asks him if he knows of a way for him to have sex with the nun. \"Well,\" says the bus driver, \"every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. If you dress up as God, I'm sure you could convince her to have sex with you.\" The man decides to try it, and dresses up in his best God costume. At eight, he sees the nun and appears before her. \"Oh, God!\" she exclaims. \"Take me with you!\" The man tells the nun that she must first have sex with him to prove her loyalty. The nun says yes, but tells him she prefers anal sex. Before you know it, they're getting down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. After it's over, the man pulls off his God disguise. \"Ha, ha! I'm the man from the bus!\" \"Ha, ha!\" says the nun, removing her costume. \"I'm the bus driver!\"",

    "postText": "\"That's terrible!\" says the priest. \"But, I have a solution to your problem. Bring your two parrots over to my house tomorrow. I will put them with my two male talking parrots... to whom I've taught to pray and read the bible. My parrots will then teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible filth, and your female parrots will learn to pray and worship the good Lord.\" So the next day, the lady brings her two female parrots to the priest's house. The priest's two male parrots are holding rosary beads and praying in their cage. The lady puts her female talking parrots in with the male talking Parrots, and the female parrots say, \"Hi, we're hot. Do you want to fuck us?\u201d One male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and screams, \"put the bible away you idiot, our prayers have been answered!\"\n\n**EDIT: Thanks a lot to** u/Green_Justice710 **and the 5 anonymous redittors who have awarded me for this... thank you!

            "comment": "That is a good joke. It was a little predictable that their parrots might have sex, but I also initially thought the punchline might involve them mixing dirty and clean language in some clever, surprising way, so that's a solid camouflage. (You could probably work that punchline into this joke too)\n\nI've a question though: when others repeat longer set-up jokes like this IRL, do they try to memorize them verbatim, or just paraphrase?",

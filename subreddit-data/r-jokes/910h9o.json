I'm actually pretty fond of kids, just not interested in raising one, and there are still times when a child is so rude/poorly behaved that it makes me want to tell someone to throw a muzzle on it or get the fuck out. I'm pretty sure they'd say the same thing if it were my dog running amok and barking at people.",

He thinks to himself, \u201cwhat a perfect opportunity to test her hearing\u201d.\n\nHe stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner honey?\u201d\n\nNo answer. He moves closer.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner honey?\u201d\n\nStill no answer. He moves even closer.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner honey?\u201d\n\nStill his wife doesn\u2019t answer. He now sees how serious her hearing problem is. At this point, he is standing right next to his wife.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner honey?\u201d\n\n\u201cFOR THE FOURTH FUCKING TIME WE\u2019RE HAVING CHICKEN\u201d",

My sister was sitting across from him, and he commences being his usual noisy self.\n\nThen he got a bit of a confused look on his face. He made some more crumpling noises and asked my sister if she could hear it.\n\n\"Yeah\" she said.\n\n\"It's really annoying\" he remarked.\n\n\"Yeah, *it is*\" kind of hoping maybe this would be a turning point and that maybe he just hadn't realized how obnoxious he was because he couldn't hear himself, and maybe this was a first step to a new, quieter dad.\n\nInstead he just rarely wears them after that so that he doesn't annoy himself.\n\nAt least we get to make fun of him amongst ourselves while he's sitting in the same room.",

I'd be mortified! \"\nThe doctor hands her some pills and says \"Here. Try these and come back in a couple weeks.\"\nA couple weeks later she returns and says \"Doctor!  It's horrible! Things are much worse! Now they're as loud as firecrackers and smell like a sewer!\"\nThe doctor says \"Wonderful! Now that we've cured your hearing and sense of smell, let's see about the gas!\"",

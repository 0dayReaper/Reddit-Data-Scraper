I\u2019ve seen black bear, brown bear, wolves, mountain lions/ cougars, coyotes, &amp; moose. \n\nNothing but fucking mountain lions and moose scare me. If I ever run into a moose I\u2019m turning and running. They are fucking freight trains on hooves with antlers as wide as I am tall. My mom told me a story of when she was an archeologist in the Yukon of how a moose walked into camp like what the fuck are you doing here and trampled $50k worth of anthropogenic equipment.\n\n [ive seen this irl](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ylCfXvKmdvU). It must have been doing 40kmph through 3 and a half feet of snow. \nI\u2019d rather face a cougar then a moose and both terrify me.",

Driving slow (thank god) and we came upon a moose just standing in the middle of the road. Was in a jeep grand Cherokee, this thing was easily 2 ft taller than the vehicle and just stood there for ten minutes. My brother and I were so apprehensive this thing would just fucking run up on the car and fuck us up. Thank God it was Canadian and just moseyed on its way.",

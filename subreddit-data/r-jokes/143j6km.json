Here it is as part of a series:  \n  \n(put on a pirate hat or change your hand to a hook, or wear an eyepatch, or otherwise say that you're a pirate)  \n  \nE: ARRRR. I am a Pirate, here to tell pirate jokes. \n  \nQ: What is a pirate's favorite restaurant?  \n  \nA: AAARRRRby's. \n  \nQ: How do pirate know they are pirates?  \n   \nA: They think, therefor they AAARRRR. \n  \n(person is now biased to think that all the jokes are RRR jokes). Q: What is a pirate's favorite letter?  (person answers RRR). \n  \n**A: ARRRR, you'd think it be R, but m' first love is the C.**  \n  \nQ: Why does it take pirates so long to learn the alphabet?  \n  \nA: Because we spend years at C (harr harr harr).\n\nQ: (person is now on the lookout of RRR and C jokes) What are the letters in the pirate alphabet?  \n  \n(person will respond R and C)\n  \nA: Oh sure, RRRR, C. But you forgot \u201faye, aye\u201d..",

He started laughing just thinking about it.\n\nThen finally told us the commander of the fire brigade had called in that he had a chimney fire and asked for one car on the downlow since it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. His coworkers at the fire department called in a P1, meaning all available vehicles were sent with sirens blaring waking up the entire neighborhood and half the town he was living in.",

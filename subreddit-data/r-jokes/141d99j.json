After 2 lashes it rips apart and his back gets completely torn open.\n\nSecond up is the Croat. \"I request two pillows strapped on my back!\" he says. After 4 lashes it rips apart and his back gets completely torn open.\n\nThird up is the Bosniak. The judge says \"since you are a fellow muslim, you can make 2 requests!\".\n\n\"My first request is for 100 lashes!\" the Bosniak shouts. Bewildered the judge asks \"And your second request?\".\n\n\"Strap the Serb on my back!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope I don't start of another balkan war in the comments.

E.g. seeing people on Israel/Palestine message boards, being young is no indication that you're willing to drop the narrative of your forebears.  On the other hand, I believe young Russians don't support the Russian invasion propaganda that their parents and grandparents support, so we've got that going for us. Which is nice.",

I'm not sure how many people realize that 130,000 Serbs live in Croatia and 40,000 Croats and 150,000 Bosniaks live in Serbia. Bosnia, of course, is incredibly mixed, even after all the ethnic cleansing. Even among the old heads, many yearn for Yugoslavia and lament the forces that broke it up. The right wing is nationalist and racist, but that's the case in every country.",

                                    "comment": "Islam forbids alcohol consumption in any amount and at any time. The Quran reveals three verses that gradually banned alcohol, starting with a mild discouragement, then a restriction during prayer times, and finally a complete prohibition. The Prophet Muhammad also instructed his followers to avoid any intoxicating substances and cursed those who are involved in the alcohol trade or consumption. Contemporary scholars have different views on the prohibition of alcohol and its implications for Muslim identity and society.\n\nAlcohol consumption is prohibited in Islam because it is harmful to the individual and society. It is an abomination and a work of Satan that causes animosity and hatred among people. It also distracts Muslims from their duty to Allah and their prayers. Therefore, Muslims are ordered to abstain from alcohol completely and not to approach it at all.\n\nVerses:\n\n- \"They ask you about wine and gambling. Tell them, there are great sins in them, [even though they bring] some profit to the people, but their sin is greater than their profit.\" (Surah al-Baqarah 2:219)\n- \"O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying...\" (Surah an-Nisa 4:43)\n- \"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divination by arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?\" (Surah al-Ma'idah 5:90-91)",

                                    "comment": "Vinegar is a good condiment that the Prophet Muhammad praised. However, not all vinegar is permissible in Islam. It depends on how it is made and what it is made from. Vinegar that is made from wine or other types of alcohol is forbidden, because it involves buying or selling wine, which is forbidden. Vinegar that is made from other sources, such as grapes or juice, before they ferment, is permissible. Bread and soy sauce may also contain some alcohol due to fermentation, but they are permissible as long as they do not intoxicate.\n\nThe general rule in Islam is that anything that intoxicates in large quantities is forbidden even in small quantities. This applies to alcohol and any other intoxicating substance. The Prophet Muhammad said: \u201cWhatever intoxicates in large quantities, a little of it is forbidden.\u201d \n\nThe different schools of Islamic law have different views on vinegar from wine based on their interpretation of the evidence. The Hanafis say it is permissible, because the Prophet Muhammad said: \u201cVinegar is a good condiment; vinegar was the condiment of the Prophets before me.\u201d The Shafi\u2018is and Malikis say it is forbidden, because the Prophet Muhammad forbade making vinegar from wine. The Hanbalis say it is disliked, because the Prophet Muhammad said: \u201cDo not make vinegar from wine.\u201d\n\nOne of the reports that mentions the best type of vinegar from wine does not mean that it is permissible to make it or buy it. Rather, it means that if one finds it already made into vinegar without any human intervention, then it is permissible to use it and it has a good taste and quality.\n\nAnother report that attributes this statement to Umar does not contradict this meaning. Umar was speaking about vinegar that was already made from wine without any human intervention. He did not allow making vinegar from wine or buying wine for that purpose.\n\nVerses in the order they were revealed in:\n\n- \"They ask you about wine and gambling. Tell them, there are great sins in them, [even though they bring] some profit to the people, but their sin is greater than their profit.\" (Surah al-Baqarah 2:219)\n- \"O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying...\" (Surah an-Nisa 4:43)\n- \"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divination by arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?\" (Surah al-Ma'idah 5:90-91)\n\n\nHadith literature:\n\n- \u201cWhatever intoxicates in large quantities, a little of it is forbidden.\u201d (Sunan al-Tirmidhi 1865; Authentic by al-Albani; Agreed upon by al-Bukhari and Muslim)\n- \u201cVinegar is a good condiment; vinegar was the condiment of the Prophets before me.\u201d (Sahih Muslim 2052; Sunan Abi Dawud 3829; Authentic by al-Albani)\n- \u201cDo not make vinegar from wine.\u201d (Sunan Ibn Majah 3383; Musnad Ahmad 1599; Authentic by al-Albani)\n- \u201cThe best type of vinegar is vinegar from wine.\u201d (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah 23586; al-Sunan al-Kubra by al-Bayhaqi 13669; Good by al-Albani)\n- \u201cDo not make vinegar from wine; if you find it already made into vinegar, then use it.\u201d (Musnad Ahmad 658; al-Sunan al-Kubra by al-Bayhaqi 13670; Good by al-Albani)",

I believe if we switch the \"butt of the joke\" everytime and can laugh at ourselves as well as others, it's sort of healing the wounds and bringing us together, as long as no one takes it seriously.\n\nI had a Kosovar-Albanian classmate back in school and once we realized how ridiculous it was that we were supposed to hate each other, we started making jokes about the situation every day. Outsiders who overheard the jokes were sometimes disturbed, but to us it was just a kind of way of accepting our differences but also respecting each other.",

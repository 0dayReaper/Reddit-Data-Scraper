    "postText": "...after taking some time to size Jim up and decide that he can trust him, Carl tells Jim about his plan to escape.\n\n  \n\"You see, \" Carl says, \"for the first 5 years I was inside, I trained my digestive system to follow my command. Now I can eat something, and it comes out broken down into its components.\" Jim is skeptical but intrigued.\n\n  \nCarl continues: \"For the last five years, I've been swallowing pieces off my uniform. It's perfect because the guards just think it's rats chewing on it.\"\n\n  \nSo Jim asks, \"Well, what does that have to do with me? How can I help?\"\n\n  \nCarl says, \"Well, the pieces of fabric come out as individual fibers. I figure by this time next year, we'll have enough to fashion a rope to get over the wall. I just need you to tie the fibers.\"\n\n  \nJim, disgusted, says, \"You have got to be kidding me!\"\n\n  \nAnd Carl says, \"I shit, you knot.\"",

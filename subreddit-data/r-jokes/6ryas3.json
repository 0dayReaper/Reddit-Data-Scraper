And then he just stopped.\n\nI mean life happens and he doesn't owe the readers, etc, but man, it's unfortunate. We are going on four years now without a Dresden Files entry, and they used to come out like clockwork.",

That's a rough endeavor.\n\nI've seen him in interviews talk about his son and the other work he's Ben doing and, regardless of a few grumbly moments he's had, I have respect for the guy. He's quite talented and I hope I can write like he does one day. \n\nIf you ever chat with him, let him know his fans want him to be at happy and at peace regardless of where he is professionally. At least I do.",

                            "comment": "But that original gap *was* unprecedented. GRRM referred to the issue as the \"Meerenese Knot,\" and it plagued him for years. /u/lulzoiaf explained it well:\n\n&gt; After publishing ASoS in 2000, GRRM wanted to put in a five years time skip in the novels. That didn't work from the narrative point of view. So he had to scrap a lot of stuff he'd written, and start writing about all that happened immediately after ASoS.\n&gt; But then things didn't work so well from the bookbinding point of view, because the book was getting physically too big, so he decided to split this book he was working on in two, along geographic lines. Thus was the plan for A Feast for Crows / A Dance with Dragons born.\n&gt; This brings us to November 2005, when AFfC was published. At this point GRRM was pretty confident that he'd get ADwD published soon. But then things didn't work from the plot point of view, because of the so-called Meereen knot - namely: how could he get Quentyn Martell, Tyrion Lannister and Victarion Greyjoy to arrive in Meereen all roughly at the same time in a way that made sense logically? So he took about five years longer to finish ADwD than he had hoped.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/298mc3/spoilers_all_explain_like_im_five_the_meereenese/ciigwxi/)\n\nIt was presumed that the Meerenese knot was solved, so the following books could come around quicker. However, this wasn't the case.\n\n\n[If this was interesting, there's a more thorough analysis here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2pp2m8/spoilers_all_an_analysis_exploration_of_grrms/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)",

Ephesians 2:13-15 does not describe abolishing the Jewish law of the commandments in a legal or physical sense, but rather in a spiritual sense in order to bring down the hostility that kept the Gentiles separate from the Jews. it's a metaphor for the wall that divided Gentile and Israelite courts inside the Temple.\n\nthe real teaching behind \"Jesus saves all\" has been diluted and disfigured by Protestant interpretations. God desires for all to be saved, but those who outright reject and speak against the teachings of the Church and Christ are refusing to be saved, and therefore cannot be saved by Jesus. the 144,000 referenced in Revelation is a symbolic number based off the more symbolic 12. twelve represents totality and maturity - the 12 apostles, which were based on the 12 tribes of Israel. 144,000 really represents the *totality* of how many people will be saved - all of God's people and His followers and believers. basically, 144,000 = everyone.\n\nthe whole theology and catechism behind God's mindset is complicated. basically, the Church teaches that God is omnipresent and his plan is perfect - therefore God is present in the past, present, and future at the same time. the \"mind changing\" is in really just the next step in his plan for the salvation of all. Also, the Greek translations continue to mess up interpretation. many Greek words in the original bible are double entendres - they have multiple meanings dependent on the context and situation, like the English word \"set\".\n\noverall, literal interpreters of the Bible have their arguments somewhat nullified by the fact that the original Greek contains many double entendres, their lack of knowledge of Church teaching and doctrine, their ignorance of the context of the passage, and lack of knowledge of the traditions of the time.\n\n",

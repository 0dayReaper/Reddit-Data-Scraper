    "postText": "They bagged six. As they started loading the plane for the return trip home, the pilot tells them the plane can take only three moose.\n\nThe two Irishmen objected strongly, stating; \"Last year we shot six moose and the pilot let us put them all on board and he had the same plane as yours.\"\n\nReluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. Unfortunately, even on full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down a few minutes after take off.\n\nClimbing out of the wreck, Paddy asked Mick, \"Any idea where we are?\"\nMick replied, \"I think we're pretty close to where we crashed last year.\"",

Googling found some theories:\n\n    Part of the reason for the Scottish reputation for thriftiness is the dominance of the (Calvinist) Presbyterian Church of Scotland, especially in the Lowlands, and the importance of the Scottish school of economics in the tradition of Adam Smith. Indeed, the Scottish reputation for thrift probably comes from the early 18th century, shortly after the union with England, when a lot of business-savvy Scottish Covenanters (i.e. Serious Scottish Presbyterian Calvinists) started to come to England to start commercial ventures; the role of these Scottish businessmen in the Industrial Revolution\u2014also pairing up with very thrifty English Nonconformist Protestants\u2014cemented the association of the Scottish people with fiscal caution\n\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThriftyScot",

When the foursome finally tracked the ball down it was actually laying only 25 yards from the green. However there was a barn in between the ball and the green. Jed was mad because he was too close to shoot the ball over the barn and he was certain he could\u2019ve curve the ball around it. The other golfer named Paddy ends up with a great ideal and he opens the barn door so that Jed can shoot through. Well as soon as he does a nuclear bomb goes off and all 4 of them die.",

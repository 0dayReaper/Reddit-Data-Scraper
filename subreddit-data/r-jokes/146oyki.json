    "postText": "A priest walked into a hotel in the month of march and asked the manager- \"is room no. 39 empty?\n\nManager- yes it's empty. You can take it\n\nPriest: ok\n\nManager: And yes my room right in front of room 39 so if you face any difficulties just call me\n\nPriest: ok and pls send a knife, a 3 inches black thread, and a 78g orange to my room\n\nAt night\n\nThe manager is unable to sleep because of the screams and sound plates breaking from the priest's room and wonders what it might be\n\nNext morning\n\nThe next morning the manager went in the priests room to find that he's already left and everything in that room was as it was before with the knife on the table.\n\nAfter 1 year (again during march)\n\nThat same priest comes to the same hotel and asks for room 39 again\n\nManager: yes the room's empty and you can take it\n\nPriest: ok, pls send a knife, a 3 inches black thread, and a 78g orange to my room\n\nManager: ok\n\nThat night the manager didn't sleep and wanted to know exactly what happened that day a year prior\n\nSuddenly sounds of screaming and plates breaking started again and the manager went near the room. But the door was locked and even the master key didn't worked on that room. His head was pounding because of the sounds and at last while waiting for the door to open he slept outside the room.\n\nNext morning\n\nWhen the manager woke up, he saw that the door was open but the priest was not there. He rushed towards the main gate but the gatekeeper told that the priest left just a few minutes ago. He asked the waiter and the waiter told that before leaving he gave all the waiters of the hotel a very generous tip.\n\nThe manager was annoyed and he was determined to find out the truth the following year.\n\nNext year during march\n\nThe same priest came again and asked for room 39 Manager: yes you can get the room\n\nPriest: send a knife, a 3 inches black thread, and a 78g orange to my room\n\nAt night\n\nThis time  the manager didn't sleep at all and listened to the sounds coming from the room the whole night. In the morning the priest opened the room and the manager went inside and said\n\nManager: What are you doing with these things at night? From where does the sound comes? Tell me quickly\n\nPriest: I will tell you the truth but you must not tell anyone.\n\nThe manager agreed\n\nBecause the manager was a loyal man he never told amyone what was going on inside the room and it remains a secret to this day.\n\n(Ps: I had to read the whole thing so you do too)",

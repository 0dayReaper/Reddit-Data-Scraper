    "postText": "A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.\n\nI decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.\n\nHere's the joke I told:\n\n\"What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?\n\nThrow your washing (laundry if you're American) in.\"\n\nOne of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.\n\nObviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said \"I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the guy. \"He choked on a sock.\"",

Every time you have a seizure, you add some months onto your 'clock' until it's maxed at I think it's.. 6 months - 1 year or something like that? If you don't have one in that time, you can try to appeal and see if you're able to drive. I could be wrong, since I haven't really checked up on it in years. I would never suggest that I'd hold any power tools, or climb ladders. As far as baths go? Maybe if I had someone able to check up on me or something like that, otherwise no way I could suffocate easily. I have to sit in the shower (when I actually can since I'm scared as shit so I usually go a month + without one) so that's always a fun note.",

I've noticed my skin gets itchy and forms rashes sometimes, other than that I've been relatively safe other than that I've still been having a lot of seizures; but not as much. \n\nStory time. My friend took Keppra  back when I had no way to get medicine.  He had terrible side effects like 'Kepprage' which was really varying bursts of anger at some of the most mundane things ever. He ended up getting to the point where he talked to me about it, since I stopped using Depakote years before meeting him due to having adverse side effects; and told him to ask his doctor if he can wean himself off the medication and go onto a new one. He comes over to my house the next day, and states that he poured his pills into a puddle and said how he wasn't taking them anymore. I get incredibly nervous and talked to him about talking to his doctor asap and getting at least enough pills to wean himself off. He didn't want any of it, so I we awkwardly hung out. A couple hours later, he was talking to me about his girlfriend being mad at him about the whole situation; and mid sentence he starts seizing up. I put him on his side and made sure all obstructions were clear and all that jazz. Was really scary seeing someone go through what everyone else deals with a LOT for the first time as an observer. \n\nI'm grateful that the medicine 'helps' my seizures, but honestly CBD/Weed would help me 100% more than any of these medications they're giving me. I've had multiple times while even under this medication where I'll feel a seizure come on; and I'll be lucky enough to have a little bud to spark up. I'll instantly feel my 'aura' (warning that I'm going to have a seizure) fade away and I snap back to normal immediately. It's a crime that I have to take medications like this when there's some readily available.",

OP is talking specifically about CBD (cannabidiol) which is known to be anti-seizure and the second most common substance in weed after THC. THC on the other hand has been thought to be pro-seizure. so if your weed is more THC than CBD it may actually make seizures worse. ",

The load screen was flashing colors as fast as a 64 could generate them and probably an old CRT display them. \n\nMy friend's brother went into an epileptic episode. \n\nI've witnessed multiple people stabbed and two people killed in my life, and that day is still one of those most engraved in my head, so fuck you. \n\nJust joking. Story is true, but your joke was excellent. I'm going to Facebook it to my (still) friend's epileptic brother. ",

            "comment": "Story time...\n\nBackground: I'm an offensive joke teller who is also Muslim by birth. I have a tendency to make terrorist jokes. Prior to 9/11 I used to joke that Osama Bin Laden was my uncle. Uncle Binny for short.\n\nYear: 2004\n\nLocation: Party at a friends house\n\n\nAt said party, after quite a few alcoholic beverages a girl who was a friend of a friend started to trash talk on Muslims as a whole and how they should all be rounded up and sent to Guantanamo. \n\n\nAfter listening to her incessant chatter for some time I decided to speak up and state that white people were not the only people to suffer a loss on 9/11. I told her the story of my uncle, a brave man who had a family; A wife, a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, a sister, a brother. All of whom suffered a great loss on 9/11. I told her how his loss had affected the family, how due to his loss of life and him being the sole provider the hardships they suffered. \n\n\nHow he was a man of integrity, the kind of many people would go to with their problems and it didn't matter how little they had, he would share what he could with them. How he was the kind of man who would give food off his own plate to feed someone in need. \n\n\nI told her how that morning, the fateful morning of September 11th he woke up like any other day. How he kissed his family goodbye and left for the airport, how he boarded that flight not knowing how his life was going to change in just a matter of hours. \n\n\nI told her how we speculated that he must have witnessed the plane being taken over, how he must have been so nervous, how he must not have taken what was happening sitting down. How he must have been so brave, guiding his fellow man in prayer to calm them in their final moments. \n\nAt this point you could see the look of horror and regret on her face for saying something so insensitive. How her generalization could hurt someone else, how her insensitive comments could directly affect another individual, an American citizen. \n\n\nI then explained to her how he must have screamed Allahu Akbar as he flew the plane in the north tower. How he died a hero, leaving a mark on the infidels, how he brought great honor to our people... \n\n\nMy friends knew where I was headed from the moment I started speaking. Some walked out because they wouldn't be able to keep it together, some stuck around to see her reaction. I myself was proud of myself for keeping it together, for not losing it at any point and giving away my punchline. ",

I looked around the venue for the crowd's reaction and.... nothing, no visible offence taken, some even laughed. Not sure if this is an okay thing between Jewish people or that was just one chill group of Jews.\n\nAlso  another funny thing that happened at that wedding, the wedding planner insisted us video and photo guys eat in another room and she would give us a notice when anything important needed to be covered. And you guessed it, she forgot to notice us when the parents were giving their speeches. Wasn't on us so we weren't too worried about it. ",

    "postText": "They arrive at the club and the doorman says, \"Hey, Dave! How ya doin'?\"\n\nHis wife is puzzled and asks if hes been to this club before.\n\n\"Oh no,\" says Dave. \"Hes on my bowling team.\"\n\nWhen they are seated, a waitress asks Dave if hed like his usual and brings over a Budweiser.\n\nHis wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says,\"How did she know that you drink Budweiser?\"\n\n\"Shes in the Ladies Bowling League, honey. We share lanes with them.\"\n\nA stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Dave, and says \"Hi Davey. Want your usual table dance, big boy?\"\n\nDaves wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.\n\nDave follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her.\n\nHe tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it.\n\nShe is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every name in the book.\n\nThe cabby turns his head and says, \"Looks like you picked up a real bitch tonight, Dave.",

Lemme see that duck!\" \n\nDave gives the duck over to the trooper, who proceeds to stick his finger in the ducks ass, pull it out, and sniff it.\n\n\"You know... This is a California duck. You need to have a California license to hunt this duck.\"\n\nDave pulls out a California license and hands it to the trooper, who inspects it closely. \n\nSurprised, the trooper says, \"Well, looks like this is your lucky day, \"Dave\". But I've got my eye on you.\"\n\nThe trooper leaves, almost making it back to his car, when ***BAM!***, he hears another gunshot. \n\n\"I've got that fucker now.\" the trooper said to himself, and runs back out to find Dave, yet again holding up a duck. \n\n\"Stop right there, Dave! Gimme that!\" \n\nHe yanks the duck away from Dave, jams his finger deep into the ducks anus, pulls out his finger, and gives it a big ole whiff. \n\nHe points at Dave with his stinky finger, \"This is a Canadian duck. You better have a Canadian license.\" \n\nConfidently, Dave pulls out a license and hands it to the trooper. The trooper looks at it, and lo-and-behold, it's a Canadian license. \n\n\"Well, \"Dave\", looks like you've skirted by again, but you can't escape the law, forever.\"\n\nThe trooper grumbles and starts making his way back to his car, when ***BAM!*** he hears yet another gunshot, right behind him. \n\nHe turns around and runs over to Dave, who is, of course, holding another duck. \n\nThe trooper doesn't say a word and storms over to Dave, who calmly hands him the duck as the trooper grabs it, frustratingly. \n\nThe trooper slides his finger into the limp duck's balloon knot and feels around. He slowly pulls his finger out, waving it around and takes in its scent as if he's sampling some new, high-class perfume. He stops and looks at Dave, wearing an impish grin. \n\n\"Now, \"Dave\". This is a...\", he sniffs the air again, \"... this is an almost extinct, Trans-Siberian Duck. If you don't have a Trans-Siberian, Class-A duck-hunting license, I'm going to put you away for a long, long time.\"\n\nDave stops for a moment, pulls out a license, and hands it to the trooper. \n\nThe trooper looks down. Sure enough, it's a Trans-Siberian, Class-A duck-hunting license. \n\nThe trooper collapses to his knees, the license crumpling out of his hands. The trooper is almost speechless and has a bewildered, twisted look on his face. Silence. The wind blows a leaf by, and it is just the two of them, the violated duck by the trooper's side. \n\n\"But... How? Wh--who are you? WHAT... *are you*? *Where are you from, anyway?!?*\" \n\nSlowly, Dave turns around and bends down, as if reaching for something. \n\nBut he just turns his head back towards the trooper and finally says, \"I don't know, officer...\"\n\n... pulling down his pants, exposing his asshole. \n\n\"... you tell me.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I can't give you cyanide to kill your husband! That's against the law! I'll lose my license! They'll throw both of us in jail! All kinds of bad things will happen. Absolutely not! You CANNOT have any cyanide!\" The lady reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of her husband in bed with the pharmacist's wife. The pharmacist looked at the picture and replied, \"Well now. That's different. You didn't tell me you had a prescription.\"",

They will usually question it but just say \"it's part of the trick, don't worry\". Tell them that this is \"the dead card\" and make sure everyone knows what it is.\n\nShuffle the cards, cut the deck multiple times, allow other people to shuffle/cut, etc.\n\nTell them that you will put the trick in the necromancer's hands. Have each person select a card at random (tell them they cannot select the reversed card) and the person with the highest card is the \"necromancer\".\n\nOnce the necromancer is selected, fan out the cards to show them that the selected card from earlier is still facing the wrong way. Hand the deck of cards to the necromancer and have them put the cards used to select the necromancer back into the deck (facing the correct way so only the selected card from earlier is facing the wrong way). Tell them they are free to inspect the cards, but to keep the card facing backwards the way it is, allow them to shuffle, etc.\n\nHave them rifle through the cards face-down with their thumb. Instruct the person next to them to say stop as the necromancer rifles through the cards. Tell the necromancer that if they land on the card selected earlier then just pick the card below it, but keep the selected card from earlier in the deck. When they say stop then have the necromancer place the card face down on the table and don't let anyone see it.\n\nGo around the table and have each person select a card in the same manner, and just like before have the necromancer place it face-down on the table without showing it to anybody, have them lay the cards in a circle.\n\nAt this point people are going to assume that you have pulled off an impossible feat where somehow one of these randomly selected cards will be the card that was facing backward in the deck, but it won't make sense because the deck was in control by the necromancer the whole time, who was seemingly selected randomly.\n\nNow tell them in order to bring back the dead you need to hold a seance. Things will get weird here, but people will go along with it because they are expecting their minds to be blown.  \n\nInstruct everyone to hold hands in a circle around the table, as if they are going to perform a seance. Don't join in on the \"seance\" but stay in full view. Tell them to say \"bring back the dead\" in a low voice together three times as they hold hands.\n\nNow have the necromancer flip the deck over so that the only card facing down will be the one selected earlier. Have the necromancer place the cards on the table one-by-one until the face down card (the one selected at the beginning) shows up, make sure they don't turn it over or show it. Tell them to carefully place the card in the middle of the circle of cards. \n\nAt this point people will have no idea what the fuck to expect and they will be eagerly awaiting the big payoff (assuming you have the right group of friends here).\n\nNow have them join hands again and mutter \"I raise the dead\" three times in a low voice. Tell them to keep holding hands as the necromancer raises the dead. Have the necromancer flip over the card in the center, revealing that it was the card that was originally selected. Act like you are waiting for a huge reaction as everyone sits in confusion while holding hands.",

We share lanes with them.\"\n\nA stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Dave, and says \"Hi Davey. Want your usual table dance, big boy?\"\n\nDave's wife, now furious, screams, \"What's that all about, you lying jerk?\"\n\nThe stripper says, \"Oh, Sally, I was just teasing -- I'm on the ladies' bowling league, that's how I know Dave. As far as I know he has never set foot in this place. But Dave tells me all sorts of wonderful things about you.\"\n\nSally feels better, and the stripper gives them each a lap dance and they tip well. When they leave, the cabbie says, \"Hi Dave -- and you must be Sally. I've heard so much about you, it's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance. You're every bit as beautiful as Dave said.\"\n\nWhen they get home, they have a glass of wine and go to sleep in each other's arms.",

    "postText": "A 17 year old male walks into a drug store. He says \"I've been invited to Christmas dinner at my new girlfriend's house. Afterwards I hope there is a chance I get lucky, you know what I mean\" \n\nClerk: \"How about condoms then? They could come in handy. Here's a pack.\" The young man after paying walks to the door, stops, smiles, comes back: \"you know what, the mom is also smoking hot, I think I'll take another pack, just in case I get extra lucky.\"\n\nChristmas eve comes around, the boy sits at the dinner table and doesn't say a word. After a while his girlfriend says: \"if I had known you were so quiet, I wouldn't have invited you.\" the young man replies \"if you had told me your dad works at a drug store, I wouldn't have come.\"\n",

The pharmacy we filmed at didn't have the condoms that we needed, so we had to go to CVS, and buy two packs of condoms. One of the guys, who doesn't exactly have the most in the way of... discretion... Goes to the customer service section with a 20 pack of condoms, and asks \"What's your return policy on these?\"\n\nThe lady responds \"If unopened, 30, if it's opened, you're on your own\".",

Maybe you should give me another pack, just in case I get EXTRA lucky?\u201d\n\n&gt;At the Christmas meal that night, the mother asks the young man to lead the family in prayer before they begin.

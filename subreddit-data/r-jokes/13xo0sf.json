According to labeling requirements in Canada (where I live) the following applies:\n\n\"...the net quantity declared must be in accordance with section 216 of the SFCR. For example, the net quantity of a food cannot be less than the amount of food stated in an advertisement, as that would be misleading.\"\n\nRounding up constitutes something misleading. Rounding down is permitted. If a package says \"contains 12-14 oz of product\", it cannot contain 11.6. It has to be at least 12. No rounding up. \n\nhttps://inspection.canada.ca/food-labels/labelling/industry/net-quantity/eng/1625703526033/1625703680279#s3c2\n\nSo the general rule is that if it is something for sale, mathematical rules are overridden by commerce rules. It is actually quite an interesting topic. \n\nA \"baker's dozen\" is a good example. Bakers in France were not allowed to deliver \"12 loaves on average\". They had to deliver 12 every time on pain of execution. In response they would send 13 loaves to make sure they survived. \n\nIn some countries items sold in bulk, like wire, are allowed to be short one part in 200 and chislers with modern equipment run very close to the line.",

Most of the World, aside from the USA, and a select few other places, consider America to be one huge continent, which is actually correct. There is tons of evidence that proves America is one big continent. If you were to ask the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, or other Spanish speaking countries in that part of the World, about Simon Bolivar, they would tell you Simon Bolivar is seen as the Liberator of America, as he freed much of Mainland Spanish America, from the very oppressive Spanish Empire.\n\nAside from that, many American Animal Species, live in many American nations. The Great American Rhea, does not live in the United States of America, or even the North Region of America. They live in the South Region of America, and are a relative of the Ostrich and Emu.",

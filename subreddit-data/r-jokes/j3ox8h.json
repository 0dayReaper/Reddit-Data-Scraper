To me it looked like he did exactly what he came to do, and exactly what he has been doing for the past four years. He made controversy and chaos, to the point that the debate became incoherent and delegitimized.  It's literally his entire MO.  He may not have \"won the debate\" but I think he absolutely did what he came to do. \n\nAs much as I am pulling for him to win, I was disappointed in Biden's seeming unpreparedness for a debate style that is certainly not unusual or unexpected for Trump. Blustering, red-faced vitriol is practically a trademark for our sitting president, and yet Biden still struggled to finish his points and was continuously derailed from several strong debate topics, not the least of which was Trump's seeming refusal to condemn white supremacy.",

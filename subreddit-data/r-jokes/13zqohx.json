    "postText": "And they only had two parachute packs. So Mama and Papa Bear strapped them on while Mama Bear told Baby Bear to cling to his Papa's back as hard as he could. Then the bears all jumped out of the plane. They pulled the cords on their parachutes and began to drift safely towards the land, but Mama Bear happened to look back up at the plane and to her horror, Baby Bear was still up there watching them from the doorway. Mama Bear yelled up to him, \"Baby, why didn't you hang onto your Papa like I told you to?\"\n\nAnd Baby Bear told her, \"Me not stupid, me not dumb. Me hang onto Daddy's bum. Dad went \\*PFFFT\\* and me went \\*ZOOM\\*, that's why me back here so soon!\"\n\n(A joke told by one of my brother's friends when we were kids. It was about as mature as they'd get lol.)",

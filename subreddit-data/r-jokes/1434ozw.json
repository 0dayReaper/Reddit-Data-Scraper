                                    "comment": "Then you\u2019ve missed a trick, I\u2019m afraid. The North is very clearly Northern England (which has a partly Norse history, under the Danelaw). The Wall is Hadrian\u2019s Wall, House Stark is the House of York (which opposed the House of Lancaster - Lannister - in the Wars of the Roses that Game of Thrones is chiefly based on, with Edward of York corresponding to Neddard Stark). There\u2019s a reason they pointedly made sure they all do Yorkshire accents (Sean Bean finally doing his natural accent, but Kit Harrington and Richard Madden changing theirs). The First Men are meant to be the Celts - the people who lived in Westeros before the Andals (Angles) arrived and before they formed the Seven Kingdoms (the seven kingdoms period of England known as the \u2018Heptarchy\u2019, meaning pretty much exactly that). The more complex union by Wessex and conquest by William the Conquerer (Aegon the Conqueror) were combined. The \u2018Old North\u2019 (Hen Ogledd) in real life kept its Celtic character longer than most of the rest, just as the North had its First Men. \n\nFar more Nordic than the North are the Iron Islands, which correspond to the much longer Norse rule of the islands off western Scotland - close to where they are on Westeros - called the \u2018Lord/King of the Isles\u2019, which was steeped in Viking and maritime culture and independent for a very long time.\n\nDespite its location being switched up, the Vale is Wales - what with the mountains, sheep and the name - but King\u2019s Landing is London, the Free Folk are Scots, both in around the right place, etc.\n\nEven the Dance of the Dragons (shown in Fire and Blood/the House of the Dragon) is based on the Anarchy - a century after the Conquest but a couple of centuries before the War of the Roses (between Lancaster and York - Lannister and Stark). The Anarchy pitted a related male and - for the first time - female claimant to the throne, with the &gt;!female claimant briefly having the upper hand in the middle as queen but eventually being expelled, but at the end her son succeeding the male victor.!&lt;\n\nOf course, Dorne is clearly Spain, its location transferred across from the Continent. The Reach is somewhat French - and for most of the period from the Conquest to the Wars of the Roses, England was in personal union with parts of France. Martin has to switch things up a bit. But there\u2019s a fair correspondence between Essos and Continental Eurasia otherwise: Italian city states and their bankers in Essos, with Valyria being Rome (its language Latin with similar prestige in Western parts, once a republic run by elite families but the whole history of the region changing with its fall, its former offshoots now Romance city states), Slaver\u2019s Bay being vaguely Middle Eastern, the Dothraki being Steppe warriors, the peaceful and religious herders of Lhazar (Lhasa?) they raid possibly being inspired by Tibet, the empire of Yi Ti far to the east being China, etc. Sothyros is Africa. The extent of the known world is approximately what was known to Medieval Europe. But outside Dorne and probably the Reach (more French?), Westeros is overwhelmingly Britain.\n\n&gt; as only Americans can do\n\nWell, this was obviously done by an American, and George RR Martin studied history at university, but a good fantasy allegory shouldn\u2019t be a 100% parallel, but have a bit of mash-up, and with most of the details being truly new and *creative*, wherever the author is from. For example, George RR Martin\u2019s (British) friend Terry Pratchett wrote the novels set in his fantasy Discworld, which satirises the real world in a very different way, and is even more (deliberately) mashed up. So not sure what you meant here, but if it was joking Americans are ignorant, Martin definitely isn\u2019t\u2026 and if it was saying Americans are more creative than anyone else, that\u2019s not true either.",

I'm a bear and I want a beer.\"\n\nThe bartender calmly replies, \"I'm sorry, but as I said, we don't serve bears beer in this bar.\"\n\nThe bear stands up full height and howls, \"I'm a bear, and I want a beer!!!  If I don't get a beer, I will eat one of your customers.\"\n\nThe bartender nonchalantly states, \"You gotta do what you gotta do, but  I'm just telling you, we don't serve bears beer in this bar.\"\n\nThe bear hurls himself down to he end of the bar devours a pretty lady sitting there, comes back, sits down with a jolt and declares, \"So there.  I'm a bear, and I want a beer.\"\n\nThe bartender stands his ground and says, \"For the last time, fella, I'm telling you, we don't serve bears beer in this bar... And for that matter, we don't serve drug addicts either.\"\n\nThe bear roars, \"DRUG ADDICTS.  What the hell are you talking about.\"\n\nThe bartender replies, \"That was a bar-bitch-you-ate.\"",

Then he entered the gorilla's cave. There were scremas of horror and he was eventually pulled out after the gorilla tore him to pieces.\nThird contender managed to survive the crocs and went in to the gorilla's cave. Horrible shouts of agony were herd but eventually the third contender walked out in one piece. A reporter approached him to congratulate him \"You're already the winner of the contest and you are about to be the first man to accomplish all the missions and stay alive!\"\nThe man answered \"OK, so just show me this little old lady so I can shake her hand and get it over with.\"",

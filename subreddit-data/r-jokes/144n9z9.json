    "postText": "They were having a lovely day until they came upon a group of protesters outside the queen's domain. One, with a sign reading *It's time to GO!,* spotted them and quickly approached.\n\n\"Excuse me ma'am, can you spare a moment to take a look at some alarming literature and help support our cause?\" he half-shouted at her.\n\nThe mother held up her hand and tried to pass, but the protester blocked her and continued. \"It is *imperative* that we evacuate the colony! Did you know that the dirt we live in,  that we *raise our children* in, contains magnesium and aluminum? And God knows what else!\"\n\nAgain, she politely but firmly shook her head, pulling her daughter along as the man shouted after her, \"You owe it to your little girl to evacuate *now!!\"*\n\nAfter they gained some distance, the young ant looked up worriedly at her mother. \"Was that man right, Mommy? Are we in danger?\"\n\nThe mother smiled. \"No sweetheart, don't worry. Just because they use big words to try to scare us, doesn't mean the Ant Evacs movement has any idea what it's talking about.\"",

I was all ready to call him an idiot myself until I googled. \n\n\"Natural abundance\nAluminium is the most abundant metal in the Earth\u2019s crust (8.1%) but is rarely found uncombined in nature. It is usually found in minerals such as bauxite and cryolite. These minerals are aluminium silicates.\n\nMost commercially produced aluminium is extracted by the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process. In this process aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite and then electrolytically reduced to pure aluminium. Making aluminium is very energy intensive. 5% of the electricity generated in the USA is used in aluminium production. However, once it has been made it does not readily corrode and can be easily recycled.\"\n\nSo while it's technically in the soil, it wouldn't be in a way that would be apparent to the ants. \n\nTIL.",

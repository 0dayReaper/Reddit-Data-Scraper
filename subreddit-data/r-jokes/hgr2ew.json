They're worse because of the lack of off switch and more annoying because of how loud they are. It really just paints a terrible picture.\n\nThey can often come off as the most stupid because of the no off switch. While I think ignorance on things will mean silence to other cultures, Americans speak right up to advertise it. Everybody has idiots, America just had a knack of showing it.

He outright *scoffed* at me and asked what kind of restaurant didn\u2019t have black tea and milk. I went, \u201cA Vietnamese one?\u201d\n\nHowever, I *love* Eastern European men when they get drunk. They start yelling, acting rowdy, and slowly forget how to speak English. Once a group of them came in to a bar I was at around Halloween and I was wearing a cowboy/sheriff costume and they went *crazy* for it, took photos with me, bought me drinks, and I told them to \u201cwatch this\u201d as I started chanting \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d, and the whole bar joined in much to their utter delight, and then shortly after they started chanting with everyone :) granted they were already drunk when we met, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re much more serious when they\u2019re not plastered, but it\u2019s definitely a memory I\u2019ll never forget!",

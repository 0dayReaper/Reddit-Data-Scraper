I am just waiting and hoping everyone else will work it out.\n\nHowever, since you asked, I\u2019m not a fan of using the plural. I was listening to a podcast awhile back that was talking about the issues with Ezra Miller and Warner Brothers; it was confusing as fuck trying to figure out who the plural pronoun was referring to. I get that I can talk about multiple women, for example, and speak in a way where I juggle back and forth between using their names and the pronoun \u2018she\u2019 so that you, the listener, can keep track of who I\u2019m referring too each tim I use the pronoun. I just don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard to use the plural in that juggling act when we already use it when we don\u2019t know the sex of the subject.\n\nI Also watched a linguist podcast that went into many issues about pronouns from a linguist prospective, foreign languages, and other examples where language has changed over time. There were lots of things in there I hadn\u2019t even considered.\n\nPersonally, I think adding one or two more pronouns and letting them settle in for a generation might work best. But I\u2019ll try to use what ever the appropriate people decide on.",

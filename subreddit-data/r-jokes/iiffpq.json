From the farmer's perspective, it actually looks like the young rooster is *chasing* the old rooster.  And he, for whatever reason, concludes that this is sexual in nature and that the young rooster is therefore gay.  (Since he purchased the rooster for breeding, a gay one would not be useful to him, hence the gunshot.)  When he says this has happened four times so far, the implication is that the old rooster tricked the young rooster into this situation deliberately and has done so three times before.\n\nThe joke is funny because of the unexpected nature of the gunshot, the absurdity of a rooster making such a plan, the clever nature of the older rooster's trick, and perhaps due to a degree of lingering social awkwardness surrounding homosexuality, making having it introduced unexpectedly as a concept (especially in the context of roosters, whose sexuality we don't usually think about) feel somewhat amusing.",

The point is, he figured out a trick that worked and protected his status on the farm.  Looking too far into it detracts from the humor somewhat.\n\nEDIT: Whichever option you find funnier is the one that happened. Personally, I find it funnier to imagine there was never a gay rooster, because its funnier if the scheme came about out of pure homophobic speculation on the old rooster's part, yet he still managed to make it work out for him four times.",

The smartest of the bunch, puts the duck on ebay, claiming it has pure genetics and is hypoallergenic and sells it for $40.  The average son brings the duck to auction and manages to get $25 for it. The dimwitted son is going door to door with his duck on a leash trying to sell it, without any luck.  Finally he gets to a house where a lonely old widower lives and she tells him she'll take the duck if he has sex with her so he agrees.  Afterwards as he gets up to leave he realizes he didn't get any money for the duck so he asks for it back. She tells him he can have it back if he makes love to her again, so he obliges and leaves with the duck.  While walking home on the side of the road an 18 wheeler driving by got a little too close to the shoulder and ended up running his duck over.  The driver, overcome with guilt decides to give the man $50 for the damages.  All three sons return home and the father asks how they did.  The average son goes first and tells his father he got $25 for his duck at auction to which father approves.  The smartest son tells him how he created a bidding war for his duck online and drove the price all the way to $40! The father is amazed at his ingenuity.  Finally he looks at his dimwitted son and asks how his day went.  The son replied *Well, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and $50 for a fucked up duck!*",

Once we settled our differences, we agreed on which 100 of the cows would be mine. Now, I don't know where this newcomer is going to get HIS cows, but I aint' givin' him any of mine.\" \n\nSecond Bull: \"That pretty much says it for me, too. I've been here 3 years and have earned my right to the 50 cows we've agreed are mine. I'll fight 'im till I run him off or kill 'im, but I'M KEEPIN' ALL MY COWS.\" \n\nThird Bull: \"I've only been here a year, and so far you guys have only let me have 10 cows to \"take care of\". I may not be as big as you fellows (yet) but I am young and virile, so I simply MUST keep all MY cows.\" \n\nThey no sooner finished their big talk when an eighteen-wheeler pulls up in the middle of the pasture with only ONE ANIMAL IN IT: the biggest Son-of-Another-Bull these guys had ever seen! At 4700 pounds, each step he took toward the ground strained the steel ramp to the breaking point. \n\nFirst Bull: \"You know, it's actually been some time since I really felt I was doing all my cows justice, anyway. I think I can spare a few for our new friend.\" \n\nSecond Bull: \"I'll have plenty of cows to take care of if I just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM. I'm certainly not looking for argument.\" \n\nThey look over at their young friend, the 3rd bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting. \n\nFirst Bull: \"Son, let me give you some advice real quick. Let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.\" \n\nThird Bull: \"Hell, he can have ALL MY COWS. I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull!\"",

    "postText": "The judge let's the wife tell her side first. \"For my husbands birthday, our family and his coworkers planned a surprise birthday party. We showed up to the house and when me and the kids went to say happy birthday first, he was laying seductively on the sofa naked. \" The court room gasps in disbelief and confusion. The judge stays silent and stares at the husband for a brief moment, before telling him to go ahead with his side of the story. The husband started telling the story. \"So I woke up today, and I thought \"Oh wow it's my birthday!\" I got up from bed to see my wife, she forgot it was my birthday. I went to wake up the kids for school. They forgot about my birthday. I went to work, all of my coworkers for got my birthday. But then I got called to my boss's office, and oh my god, she said \"Kyle. Happy birthday!\" So I was happy about finally being told happy birthday, and asked if I wanted to have lunch with her after work. So after work we went to go get lunch. We finished lunch and she asked if I wanted to go to her place. I said sure. We got there and she seemed so happy and excited about me being there. Then she says she's gonna step into her room real quick. I heard a lot of noise, I thought she was undressing. I thought this was going elsewhere. \"",

Unfortunately we didn't get a Blue Wave\n\nThe fuck we didn't.\n\nWe picked up at least 33 house seats with some still being counted,  have elected 100 women to congress, flipped at least 7 governors seats, and took literally hundreds of local seats across the country.  We took the governorship in Kansas of all places, and won in many red districts across the country.  Places that were once solid red are now peppered with blue districts, and Arizona looks like it might actually flip.  Oh, and pot is now legal in MI.  Yes, it was most definitely a blue wave.  \n\n[Here's some actual data](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2018)",

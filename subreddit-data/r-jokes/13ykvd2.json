The lead in of everything changed with the expectation of it being his overwhelming emotional joy or whatever, to the much more literal and dark \"what changed is my address\" lol...\nBecause obviously the joke wouldn't land if it was \"my wife got pregnant so I...\n\nchanged my address.\" \n\nSo clever whatever that is! Clever wording? Wordplay's probably perfectly understandably and acceptable breakdown of that entire premise actually, but perhaps you'd like to look it up and explain how it isn't :)\n\nOkay yeah I can see your sense of humor is really through the roof mister fucking pedantic. You must be a blast at parties.",

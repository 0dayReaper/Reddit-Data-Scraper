    "postText": "The year is 2024 and the United States has just elected the first woman president, who happens to be from Wisconsin.  A few days after the election, the president-elect, whose name is Susan, calls her father and says, \u201cSo, dad, I assume you will be coming to my inauguration?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think so, Susie.  It's an 18-hour drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't worry about it, dad!  I will send Air Force One, and a limousine to pick you up at your door.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know, Susie.  Everybody will be so fancy.  What would your mother wear?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, dad,\u201d replies Susan, \u201cI'll make sure she has a wonderful gown, custom-made by the best designer in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney,\u201d her dad complains, \u201cyou know I can't eat those rich foods you eat.  Do they serve tap beer?\u201d\n\nThe president-to-be responds, \u201cDon't worry, dad.  The entire affair will be handled by the best caterer in Washington.  I'll ensure your meal has potatoes and cheddar in it.  You and mom just have to be there.\u201d\n\nSo, her dad reluctantly agrees, and on January 20, 2025, Susan is being sworn in as president of the United States.  In the front row sit Susan's parents.  Her dad, noticing a Senator sitting next to him, leans over and whispers, \u201cYou see that woman over there with her hand on the Bible?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet I do,\u201d whispers the Senator in reply.\n\nThe dad proudly beams, \u201cHer brother played football for the Green Bay Packers.\u201d",

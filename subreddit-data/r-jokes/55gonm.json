    "postText": "Dave was bragging to his boss one day, \"You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.\"\n\nTired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, \"OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?\"\n\n\"No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.\"\nSo Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,\n\n \"Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!\"\n\nAlthough impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.\n\n\"No, no, just name anyone else,\" Dave says.\n\n\"President Obama,\" his boss quickly retorts.\n\n\"Yup,\" Dave says, \"Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,\" and off they go. \n\nAt the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, \"Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.\"\n\nWell, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.\nAfter they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.\n\n\"Pope Francis,\" his boss replies.\n\n\"Sure!\" says Dave. \"I've known the Pope for years.\" So off they fly to Rome.\n\nDave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, \"This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.\"\nHe disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.\n\nSure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.\n\nMaking his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, \"What happened?\"\n\nHis boss looks up and says, \"It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",

This marked the channel's first foray into scripted original programming. During the airing of the Red Dwarf mini-series, the Dave DOG in the top left corner of the screen had the word 'Lister' added after it in the same font after the show's lead character; during the show it is even suggested that the station is named after him. Back to Earth brought record breaking viewing figures, not just in the context of the channel's past, but for digital television in general.[7]",

When I first heard this one, Dave was Ivanov from some biggest hole in Siberia, the Boss was 2 KGB agents questioning him, and in the punchline \"the man next to him\" was a group of Japanese tourists.\n\nedit: Also in the KGB version the whole joke starts with Ronald Reagan visiting USSR. About to leave and then is like 'wtf haven't seen Ivanov yet, how did I almostt forget', goes to some random Siberian village and finds this random dirty guy underground somewhere, hugs and talks like BFFs etc, what gets those KGB agents interested in first place. They do backround searches and 30 generations pure russian never left his small village etc so leave him alone. But then when repeat happens with Queen Elizabeth visit, that's when the agents really get involved and grab the guy as it's too weird by now as in what spy or what is he. And then the Pope thing goes down as he is trying to prove how it's all because he does in fact know everyone :P\n\nEither way nice joke that works depending on cultural backrounds however you wrap it it :P",

They'd put up a wall to give Cheech Marin a door to knock on; his part of the studio ended up cut off from the AC as a result. Tommy Chong had a nice, spacious area with a recliner and running air.\n\n\"Dave's not here\" was *not* on the script. The moment Mr. Chong said that, the rest of the skit was pure ad-lib.\n\n[Source](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-cheech-chong-dave-20151127-story.html)",

They go into a restaurant and things are going ok ish when Paul McCartney* enters the restaurant and sits down at the bar for a beer.\nGirl gets up to go to the washroom and Dave goes over to Paul Mac and says \"Hey Paul,  I`m on a first date - she`s in the washroom, we`re sitting over there. When she comes back, can you come over and pretend you know me, she`ll be really impressed,  my name`s Dave.\"\n\n\"Oh alright then Dave, no problem\" says the famous Beatle.\n\nDate comes back from washroom and not long after sitting down Paul McCartney comes over, gives Dave a slap on the back, and exclaims, \"Dave buddy, it`s YOU, haven`t seen you in ages, how`s it going?\"\n\nWith an irritated look on his face, Dave says, \"Hey, beat it Paul, can`t you see I`m with my girlfriend.\"\n\nIt`s just the way Dave rolls.\n\n\n\n*FAO younger redditors, he`s a really really famous guy.",

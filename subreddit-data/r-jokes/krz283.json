I'm aware this is NOT the figure each taxpayer contributes (thus the term \"per capita\").\n\nRedditors are free to do their own due diligence on tax policy.  Have at it!! :)",

This badge means I am allowed to go wherever I wish... On any land! No questions asked or answers given! Have I made myself clear?... Do you understand?!\" \n\nI nodded politely, apologized, and went about my chores. A short time later, I heard loud screams, looked up, and saw the DEA officer running for his life, being chased by my big old mean bull. With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it seemed likely that he'd sure enough get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified. \n\n-\n\nI threw down my tools, ran to the fence and yelled at the top of my lungs, \"Your badge, show him your fucking badge!!\"",

It was winter, and the farmer's bull was in its stocks for the winter. Couldn't go anywhere. Bros set me in front of the bull and proceeded to whack the bull with some stick. Right in those big bull balls.\nNext summer I was wandering around the hills and crossed a fence into a hay field that was freshly harvested. Coming down over the crest of the hill came that bull. I must have been down wind because that bull took off and ran straight toward me.\nI managed to get up into the only tree in that field - A big old oak. The bull stomped around and bellowed and would not leave.\nLucky for me the farmer heard this and saved me. He came down the hill talking soft to that bull. Then fe took this long stick with a hook on the end and snagged the bull's nose ring. Twisted it until the bull was on its knees and told me to run like he'll. I did. And I never went in that field again.\nThe bull was sold the next spring after he'd freshened the cows. My brothers always denied they'd done that.",

And a coward, will just keep taking it, and still be an obsequious toadie. The cops will still love Trump despite him fucking them over, just like Trumps followers still love him after he spent 4 years fucking them over.",

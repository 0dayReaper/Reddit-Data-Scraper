    "postText": "I finished a murder trial, I was representing the defendant. The only defence I had was that there was no body found. I knew I was going to lose the case, so for my closing argument, I looked at my watch and I told the jury the victim is going to walk through that door in a minute. The entire jury looked over at the door waiting for the person to walk through. Of course, the person did not walk through. I then told the jury, look, you had to have had some reasonable doubt that my client did it because you were waiting for the victim to walk through the door. That\u2019s it, that was my closing argument. Well, guess what? The jury came back with a guilty verdict. I asked the jury after, and I said you all looked at the door. The jury said \u2018Yeah, we all did look at the door. But guess who did not? Your client.\u2019",

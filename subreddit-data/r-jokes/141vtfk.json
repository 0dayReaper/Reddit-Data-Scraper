    "postText": "A man finds himself in a line to see \"God\". He can hear the conversations God has with each person as they reach the front of the line. Apparently the Lord is using a particular method to expedite coming up with proper punishments.\n\n\"No one knows your sins better than you my child, thus you shall decide your own fate. I will use my godly powers to force you to honestly judge yourself with the most terrible and appropriate torture you can think of, knowing all the sins you have committed. What shall your fate be my child?\"\n\nNone in the line are able to evade a terrible fate. Some try to bite their lip and stay quiet, but one by one, against their will, they each break down into tears and spew out a the most ironic and terrible punishment that their imagination can muster based on their own perceived shameful actions. \n\nThe man's face grows more and more sullen as he hears the punishments people give themselves. Some people seem genuinely awful and deserving of their fate, but others seem to just be people who are being forced to expose their harshest self criticisms. People spout forth all the worst tortures imaginable, literally, from psychological to physical, for sins as small as bullying another kid in elementary school or forgetting to separate their recycling. God then says \"So you shall be judged.\" and with a snap of his fingers, whisks them away to their own personal hell.\n\nIt was getting to the point where people were starting to shake with fear before they even got to the front of the line.\n\nthe man noticed an elderly man directly in front of him seemed fine, and so he asked him \"You seem pretty confident. Are you not afraid that you have some hidden shame?\"\n\nThe elderly man shrugged and said \"Not really. I was a very charitable and self sacrificing person. I gave blood every month, volunteered at the homeless shelter, gave half of my monthly paycheck to children's charities for 40 straight years, and left behind 4 loving children whom I all raised well.\"\n\nBut when the elderly man in front on him reaches God, he too breaks into tears \"I could have done more... So many people still suffered while I lived in comfort... While I took vacations...\" the man manages to say between sobs. \"I'm the worst... The worst scum imaginable... I deserve to be-\" and then the elderly man described a quite awful fate, to which God once more said \"So you shall be judged.\" and snapped his fingers, whisking the elderly man away.\n\nFinally the man reaches the front of the line with a sour look on his face, and God asks him the same question \n\n\"What shall your fate be my child?\"\n\nThe man does not break down in tears, but instead begins to gruffly ruminate out loud.\n\n\"Well honestly, I'm kind of an arrogant asshole. I've always harshly judged other people as though I knew best despite coming from a place of privledge and power. It's obvious now that my actions were unfair, and I can't help but feel such behavior deserves a worse punishment than any other before me.\"\n\nGod merely raised an eyebrow, curious at the man's combination of frankness and lack of despair, and nodded for the man to go on.\n\n\"As such,\" the man continued, \"The only appropriate judgment I can think of is for you to make me think I'm God for a day, see how I use my power on other people, and then when the day is over, reveal the truth and then do to *me* whatever *I* did to *others* during that time.\"\n\nGod then raised his fingers and said \"So you shall be- wait what?\"\n\nAnd then the man said \"So you shall be judged\" and snapped his fingers.",

I mean, thank you, devoted deciple. Actually, could you do me a favour and wait here to let the other obsessed lo--*cough* devotees know that, uh...\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Oh let them know that you're not here?\n\nJesus: Yeah! Yes, let them know that I'm not here. Thank you, this is a very important task!\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Wait! Where will I tell them that you are?\n\nJesus: Oh, uh, just say I'm not here. You remember what just happened like yesterday, I think? Not sure how long I was out.\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Three days.\n\nJesus: Yes, well, they might be a bit embarrassed that their crucifixion didn't take, so maybe it's best to keep it quiet.\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Oh right, that's smart. Wait, couldn't you just come back again even if they do crucifixion you again?\n\nJesus: It's crucify. And no, I might actually die if they do it again. Plus it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience in the first place, even if I could be sure I'd survive.\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: But you did die, I saw it. You were just laying there, no walking around, no sermons, no free wine. Seemed pretty dead to me.\n\nJesus: People don't--oh nevermind, I uh, spoke with my father and he said if they do it again, he'll make it rain rocks so that everyone dies.\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Oh. Ok, we'd better keep your location hidden then.\n\nJesus: Yes, agreed. Ok, well bye then.\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Wait!\n\nJesus: What?\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Can I touch them?\n\nJesus: Touch what?\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Touch your wounds!\n\nJesus: What!?\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Yeah just real quick. I just wanted to make sure they aren't painted on.\n\nJesus: You think this looks like paint? It's still bleeding a little bit!\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Please? I just want to stick my fingers in them. That might just be tomato juice.\n\nJesus: No! And tomatoes don't even exist on this continent, neither of us should even know what they are! Just wait here and tell everyone that I'm not here anymore. Now I really must be going, there wounds need attention.\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Wait!\n\nJesus: What now??\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Does that make me an angel?\n\nJesus: What?\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: I mean, you're the son of God or maybe God himself and you gave me a task, that means I'm an angel now right?\n\nJesus: What? I mean, fine, sure, you're an angel now. I dub thee an official angel.\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Sweet! I'm gonna be an angel of death and go visit those fucking Samaritans.\n\nJesus: \ud83d\ude1f\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: They won't even know what hit them.\n\nJesus: \ud83d\ude20\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: But... I'll just stick with the firstborns?\n\nJesus: \ud83d\ude21 No! You're a messenger angel, not an angel of death. I mean, were you even listening to anything I was saying!?\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Something about loving my neighbour like my brother. My brother is a real prick though, so to follow your advice I've been randomly attacking people that look different and being kind to anyone who looks like they'd be a better brother. And women can't be brothers so--\n\nJesus: I've wasted my life. Just tell them I'm not here and stop attacking people randomly. Goodbye! *Walks away muttering about seeing how Peter would like it if he gets left in charge so he has to deal with all this*\n\nObsessed Jesus fan: Wow, he's right. I need to be more organized in how I attack others.",

Making jokes about something is one of the most important parts of freedom of speech. That is why no matter how offensive a joke may be to some people (like the wifi-joke was to your fellow Christian that started this whole discussion), it still must be possible to make such a joke, in the right environment.\nComedy and jokes are more important than people think.\nHave a nice day sir.",

That's the meaning of \"god doesn't exist science\" the redditor was talking about. Also, it's not really a separate branch of science or anything. It's just science. Which is based on facts that have been theorized and proven through experiments (the simple definition of science in case you didn't know).\n\nAnd none of that applies to the existence of invisible sky daddy that \"grants\" wishes. Let's not forget that all the religions expect *blind* faith. That alone points to the BS of all religions \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSo, once again, science doesn't have to disprove something that can't be proved in the first place, scientifically.",

Science is not against Christianity only a fool would think that, it is a lie that was propagated largely by atheists on the internet back ten-ish years ago using these hyper specific clips of super orthodox groups, that have like 4 people in them, and Amish sermons. Literally no other Christian group disagrees with science, because there is a concept in the church called hylomorpism. This is a little bit of a high thinking concept, but try to keep up. Aristotle, the philosopher, came up with this concept that essential says there is both a material and non-material world that work in tandem with each other, in religious theology that would be the body and soul. Things can and must exist in the natural world that do not in the supernatural world and vice versa. While I'd love to dive deeper into theology with you, though, I'll leave you with just that for now.",

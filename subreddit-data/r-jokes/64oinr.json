Which means someone with a small amount of DAW experience could, if they were so inclined, splice it so that it sounded like these lyrics were in the actual song (reverse \"me\" so it sounds like \"eem\", put it at the end of \"me\", and splice in an \"s\" sound, then mix the rest of the audio stems with it). \n\nI'm giving this detailed observation because I've lost access to my own DAW... but... Y'know... Maybe *someone* around here has one. ",

Everyone got together with their favorite communities and each made their own little things, and discovered new 'neighbors' on the canvas and collaborated with them to combine their things and it was beautiful and awesome. \n\nIt really felt like a unique, almost historic experience. Theres other sites out there with similar concepts but they cant match the amount of pull reddit has, *not to mention* the even better part about it being on reddit, the cooperation. They dont have subreddits already integrated into the same site for people to collaborate, conspire, and negotiate with. \n\nI started the temmie with /r/Undertale, not really expecting anything to come of it or even sure if it could be finished without being consumed by some larger project. But in the end we cooperated with /r/Ireland to make her an Irish temmie, and now the Irish Tem even has its own unique fanarts by some really talented people on /r/Undertale.\n\n",

What I don't support is an airline A) calling them to arbitrarily enforce a bullshit debarkation policy on a specific passenger for no fucking reason and B) having an overbook policy that leads to A.\n\nIf a uniformed officer asks you to do something in a port, you do it while calling your lawyer.  You are never, NEVER going to win an argument with law enforcement.  That's what lawyers are for.  \n\nSo, no, I don't fault officers who were told that a passenger was being belligerent for coming onboard and giving a lawful order which is refused and then employing pain compliance that they are authorized to use.  I fault United for getting them involved on false pretense.",

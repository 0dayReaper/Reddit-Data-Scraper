    "postText": "It's the middle of summer and with no electricity yet, it's very hot in the building. One of the nuns decides to take off her habit and strips down to just her panties.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d yells the Mother Superior.\n\n\u201cIt's so hot in here, Mother Superior!\u201d she replies. \"It's only us in here, so I didn't think it would be a problem to take off my habit. It also makes it easier to move around and work.\u201d\n\nThe other nuns all start agreeing and asking if they can do the same. The Mother Superior tells them, \u201cYou may all take off your habits but stay away from the windows. They're not covered yet, and we don't want anyone to see.\u201d\n\nThe other nuns disrobe and go back to work. All of them are in just their panties, but after about an hour, there's a knock at the door. They all look at each other nervously because they're all in their underwear, so the Mother Superior walks over to the door. Without opening it, she asks, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\nA voice from the other side of the door says, \u201cBlind man.\u201d\n\nThey all breathe a sigh of relief, and the Mother Superior opens the door, saying, \u201cWhat can I do for you, my child?\u201d\n\nThe man says, \u201cNice tits, sister. Where do you want me to start hanging the blinds?\u201d",

It'll get either 4 or -3 karma here. Karma is the worst metric for the funny of a joke I've ever seen anywhere in my entire life. \n\nWhen a reddit post is made, 99% of people don't see it because they just want jokes in the Hot section. The other 1% will look in new and are so desensitized with puns that upvotes are a rarity even there. And you need enough upvotes to get a post into the hot section for the other 99% of people to see it. You showing off your karma or using it for a metric in the funny factor of a joke is a mental handicap.",

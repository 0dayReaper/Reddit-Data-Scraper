The doctors do not claim marijuana was the cause of death. They claim that the death was associated with marijuana in the system and that other possible causes of the death couldn't be tested for. \n\nNBC affiliate headline: [\"Colorado doctors claim first marijuana overdose death.\"](http://www.9news.com/news/health/colorado-doctors-claim-first-marijuana-overdose-death/491760125bn)\n\nNew York Daily News headline: [Baby boy is first marijuana overdose death, doctors claim](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/baby-boy-marijuana-overdose-death-doctors-claim-article-1.3637939)\n\nIf you read the case report, it says the cause of death was myocarditis. This boy's myocarditis was *associated* with marijuana exposure since they found it in his system. It doesn't say that they know the cause was marijuana overdose. \n\n\nCase report: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10w5pc\n\nOne of the doctors had to publicly clarify the findings of the case report because of these news outlets' agenda pushing. [\u201cWe are absolutely not saying that marijuana killed that child,\u201d said Thomas Nappe, an author of the report who is now the director of medical toxicology at St. Luke\u2019s University Health Network in Bethlehem, Pa.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/11/17/the-truth-behind-the-first-marijuana-overdose-death/?utm_term=.4033ad6e7735)\n\nEdit: if you guys liked this example, see a list I made with examples of [false or misleading reporting coming from the major media networks,](https://np.reddit.com/r/media_criticism/comments/7j6bto/huge_list_with_examples_of_false_reporting_coming/) including CNN, Fox News, RT, Washington Post, New York Times, Guardian, NBC, ABC, etc.",

Maybe if you didn't show his face, but even then his voice is pretty recognizable... He can't really tell the joke without his voice or face unless it's like told via a series of letters or emails or something. Actually maybe emails could be funny if we got Hillary to be the recipient. Then we can have two punchlines when she deletes them.",

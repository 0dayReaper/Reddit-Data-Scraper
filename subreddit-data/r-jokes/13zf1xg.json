He would sit on the back of every other lion and sometimes he would fuck them. I remember my parents laughing because once he also fucked one of the males. I was a nerd and at the time stuck in \u201eThe Hobbit\u201c a computer game for the ZX Spectrum, so I had more important things to think about. As far as I was concerned the lion could have fucked the Italian tourist in front of us, who always left his car to get better pictures.",

He suddenly exploded into action and bridged the 75 meters from his fuckfest to the guys car in about three seconds. The tourist actually reacted quite well, he didn\u2019t freeze he did his best to get into the car. The lion was so fast when he reached the car, it skidded and lost a few tenths. So the Italian guy just managed to shut the door. So from a point of sexual aggression the lion scored 100 and the Italian tourists 3 (I gave him these points because some people find a sexual element in shitting the pants)",

    "postText": "In surgery for a heart attack, a middle-aged woman has a vision of God by her bedside. \u201cWill I die?\u201d she asks. God says, \u201cNo. You have 30 more years to live.\u201d With 30 years to look forward to, she decides to make the best of it. So since she\u2019s in the hospital, she gets breast implants, liposuction, a tummy tuck, hair transplants, and collagen injections in her lips. She looks great! The day she\u2019s discharged, she exits the hospital with a swagger, crosses the street, and is immediately hit by an ambulance and killed. Up in heaven, she sees God. \u201cYou said I had 30 more years to live,\u201d she complains. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d says God. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d she asks. God shrugs. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d",

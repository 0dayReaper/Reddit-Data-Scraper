So he sent his servant who\ncouldn't speak proper English to the nearby village\ndoctor. The servant goes up to the doctor and says \"Big\nBoss No Shit\". The doctor understands and gives him\na small dose of medicine to help with the constipation.\nA few days pass by and the servant comes back to the\ndoctor and says the same four words \"Big Boss No Shit\",\nthe doctor a bit annoyed but nonetheless gives him a\nstronger dose of the medicine. Again a few days pass by\nand the servant comes back and repeats \"Big Boss No\nShit\". This time the doctor is completely pissed and gives\nthe servant the 'strongest' medicine he has. This time\nthe servant does not come back. Later there's a tribal\nfestival or a gathering and the doctor is invited. He finds\nthe servant there. \"Well it's been a long time the medicine\nI gave must have worked\". Then the servant shaking his\nhead reply's \"Big Shit No Boss\".",

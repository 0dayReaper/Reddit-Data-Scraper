I'm seeing claims that it is a shortening of binary digit, but can't find a solid source on that and it may be a backronym. Most likely bit was just used to mean \"small part\" and the name stuck.\n\nEdit: it's also worth noting that a byte wasn't always 8, many early systems grouped bits into different sized bytes, so when they were named bits they weren't necessarily pieces of 8.",

A hell of a lot for sure, but at least semi-plausible-ish.\n\nIt's also really awkward to say your version.  \"I made 101 bucks\" is a lot better than \"I made 400 dollars and 5 cents\" so from a comedic timing/delivery standpoint 101 is objectively better.  Who would even add in the 5 cents if saying that in conversation?\n\nLastly, the 400.05 version also makes the punchline more obvious even before you get to it.  A lot of comedy is about subverting expectations and the 101 in the setup is far more subtle.",

They were both trying to \u201cescape\u201d (the name of the song) the boring mundanity of their relationship but realized that they wanted the same thing. What they were looking for was right in front of them the whole time.\n\nThe moral of the song is to communicate.

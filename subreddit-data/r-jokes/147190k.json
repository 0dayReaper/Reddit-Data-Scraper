            "comment": "Hey. In an attempt to be constructive, I would like to ask what the punchline is. Even if she was a taxi driver, her car still broke down and isn\u2019t able to drive. \n\nPerhaps it would be better to have her either try to get the \u201estranger in her car\u201c arrested when she realized that she needed to get to her appointment. \n\nAdditionally, it is unclear why she needs to be \u201ehysterical\u201c or pregnant for the joke to work. Unless the joke is that she is pregnant, and hence a taxi, which is not a good joke, and actually completely irrelevant for the police to mention. \n\nPerhaps if you wanted to use the pregnancy angle, you could play with the concept of water breaking. Have the set up being her telling the police that she needs to get to her doctor as soon as possible because her water broke. And then reveal at the end that she simply had an appointment, and her water bottle leaked. \n\nI can imagine that with some reworking of this it might make for a good visual sketch, actors playing off of each other and a camera slowly revealing more and more. It doesn\u2019t really seem to work like this.\n\nI hope this helped",

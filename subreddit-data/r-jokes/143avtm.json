    "postText": "'The Truth Will Always Prevail'\n\n  \nWhen we visited India in 1995 we fell in love with the cuisine of that country. One meal in particular was totally awesome and we asked to meet the chef. We were introduced to this unassuming man named Savio Fernandes who came from the tiny coastal state of Goa. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe explained how the entire meal from starters to dessert had been prepared in a uniquely Goan style. \n\n  \nWe were very impressed and asked the Cabinet Secretary if we could borrow the cook for a few months, and take him to the USA to cook for us and our state guests for a while. They agreed, and after a few weeks Savio joined our kitchen staff at the White House.\n\n  \nThe Portuguese ambassador was expected for a State Dinner, so we asked Chef Savio Fernandes to cook a twelve course meal for the ambassador and his entourage, and in the process show off his unique Indo-Portuguese cuisine. Savio suggested that the piece-de-resistance would be something called Sorpatel &amp; Sanna. Bill was a bit wary as Savio described it as a very spicy dish, and Bill was having a bit of a stomach upset at the time. But in the end we told Savio to go ahead.\n\n  \nThe dinner was a great hit, with Savio presenting exotic dishes with names like Xacuti and Caldin and Feijado and Balchao and Vindaloo and Cafreal and Patoleo and Bebinca and what have you. Bill was particularly fascinated by the Sorpatel &amp; Sanna and gorged away, despite the delicate condition of his stomach. Just as we were saying our goodbyes it happened. Bill started getting severe cramps and nausea. He called aside the Chief of Staff and shouted at him, \"Get rid of that Goan cook. Right now!\"\n\n  \nThe Chief of Staff explained to Bill that proper protocol had to be followed or it would cause a diplomatic row. Bill shouted at him, \"I am the President of the United States of America. If I want a chef sacked I can do it right now, and don't need any of your protocols!\"\n\n  \nJust then Bill had another attack of cramps and excused himself from the room and rushed towards the bathroom. By now he was so disoriented that he couldn't remember which door led to the bathroom. Bill was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally found a door that opened. As he unzipped his trousers and ran in, he realized to his horror that he had stumbled into Monica Lewinsky's office with his trousers around his knees.\n\n  \nAs he was about to pass out, this naive girl bent over him and heard President Clinton whisper in a barely audible voice, \"Sack my cook!\"\n\n  \n\u2026. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how the whole misunderstanding occurred!",

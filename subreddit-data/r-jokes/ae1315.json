    "postText": "...after taking some time to size Jim up and decide that he can trust him, Carl tells Jim about his plan to escape.\n\n\"You see, \" Carl says \"for the first 5 years I was inside, I trained my digestive system to follow my command. Now I can eat something and it comes out broken down into it's components.\" Jim is skeptical, but intrigued. \n\nCarl continues: \"For the *last* five years, I've been swallowing pieces off my uniform. It's perfect, because the guards just think it's rats chewing on it.\"\n\nSo Jim asks, \"Well, what does that have to do with me? How can I help?\"\n\nCarl says \"Well, the pieces of fabric come out as individual fibers. I figure by this time next year, we'll have enough to fashion enough rope to get over the wall. I just need you to tie the fibers.\"\n\nJim, disgusted, says \"You have *got* to be kidding me!\"\n\nAnd Carl says \"I shit. You knot.\"\n\nEDIT: Wow. This blew up. Thanks to everyone for their kind words and thanks to those of you who gave Gold and Silver. Frankincense and Myrrh are also accepted.",

Now I can eat something and it comes out broken down into it's components.\" Jim is skeptical, but intrigued. \n\nCarl continues: \"For the last five years, I've been swallowing pieces off my uniform. It's perfect, because the guards just think it's rats chewing on it.\"\n\nSo Jim asks, \"Well, what does that have to do with me? How can I help?\"\n\nCarl says \"Well, the pieces of fabric come out as individual fibers. I figure by this time next year, we'll have enough to fashion enough rope to get over the wall. I just need you to tie the fibers.\"\n\nJim, disgusted, says \"You have got to be kidding me!\"\n\nAnd Carl says \"I shit. You knot.\"\n\n",

Admittedly, the dog with the two pieces of rope was part of the inspiration for this joke. Unfortunately, if you take *that* joke -\n\n\"I ate two pieces of rope and they came out tied together. I shit you knot.\" \n\nThen the problem lies in the syntax. The person eating the rope should technically be saying \"I *will* shit you *a* knot.\" Or \"I *have* shit you *a* knot.\" But of course, the comedy lies in the punning of the phrase \"I shit you not.\" So, proper grammar/syntax wouldn't work in that scenario.\n\nI would like to think that my version is funny because \"I shit. You knot.\" is correct grammatically.\n\nOf course no jokes are funny if you have to explain them, so thank you for ruining the only good thing I have in my life right now.",

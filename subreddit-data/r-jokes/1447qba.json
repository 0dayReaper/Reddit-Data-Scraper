    "postText": "The bartender, perplexed as to why the man would order a drink for an empty chair, made two drinks for the man and the empty chair. \nThis seemed to happen every time the man entered the bar. He would order a drink for himself and an empty chair next to him.\nFinally, curiosity overtook the barman and the barman asked the customer \u201cevery time I see you come in here, you always order a drink for the empty chair next to you. Why do you do that?\u201d\n\nThe man replied \u201cwell, you see, I am a physicist, and quantum physics states that it is possible for the matter above the chair to spontaneously form into a beautiful woman, whom I hope to give this drink to and go out on a date\u201d.\n\nThe bartender asks \u201cwell, plenty of women come to drink here every night, why don\u2019t you buy one of them a drink? Maybe one of them will go out on a date with you!\u201d\n\nTo which the man replies \u201cyeah, but what are the chances of that happening?\n\nCredit: The Big Bang Theory, where I heard this joke",

One day he came in and ordered only two beers. The bartender was surprised and then expressed his condolences over the loss of his brother. \n\nThe Irishman corrected him saying: Oh no, my brothers are still fine! I\u2019ve just decided to quit drinking!",

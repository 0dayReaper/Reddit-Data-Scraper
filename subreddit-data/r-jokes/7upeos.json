If you listen to Harmontown and happen to have encyclopedic knowledge of the first four seasons of family guy it's hard to ignore.\n\nOf course it's totally likely they've never seen it and only heard the jokes regurgitated, but then you have to wonder why the jokes are funny to them once the Family Guy label has been removed.

A lot of people experience this as an obsession with detailed cleaning. An \u201canal\u201d personality is one who has to do everything perfectly. So that\u2019s why he\u2019s excited about having a clean house! Because if he gets the upvotes, she will allow him to obsessively clean the house. It\u2019s a joke on the double entendre of the phrase \u201cget anal\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s an interesting commentary on society that everyone completely misses the actual joke because once they see the word anal they respond like monkeys. Maybe it means people aren\u2019t getting/giving enough anal so they can\u2019t stop thinking about it??",

I was lost and wondered what I could do to get more karma to be allowed in many of the sub Reddits So I came in here and built up some comment karma posting whatever popped into my mind in the comments section of OP posts like this one. But with only one hand for typing on the keyboard. The other hand for jerking off at the same time.",

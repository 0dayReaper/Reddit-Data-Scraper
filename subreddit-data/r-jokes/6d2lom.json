Its a bachelors in Culinary Arts and Service Management.    Its hard to find work in the industry for more than minimum wage.

I was working on Long Island and most places say things like \"I can hire 2 Spanish people for $5/hr each. No you can't have the raise\"    The really good high teir restaurants and really good places to work aren't the places desperately looking for staff and I've had a pretty bad run of employers  in the last 6ish years.    Hopefully now that I took a more corporate job I'll be able to have some more opportunities to move into upper management jobs that pay better.   ",

Sure, they'll teach you some useful stuff, but you have to be really damn talented and lucky to be very successful. The restaurant/service industry is brutal. I guess that's true of any industry that is a majority \"entry level\". \n\nIt's hard to say any education is bad, but some degree programs seem to be predatory and deceptive. I'm not sure if you feel that way about your degree, so I'm not trying to slam it, but it doesn't seem like it worked out as you planned/were led to believe. \n\nIf you're switching fields anyway, there are several computer science degree programs that are only a year long if you already have a bachelor's. I know, more debt (yay!) but starting salary there is ~$50k. Combine the two, you'd be a in a good spot to design a better POS for restaurants. ",

SUNY system has lots of good business schools for 1/4 of what I paid. I would have gotten the same \"Away from home on your own\" experience at a state school too..  AS for the the food experience, it was great, lots of hands on time with really great chefs, but,  I could have found a chef that would have trained me from the ground up to be his sous chef, in the industry, while getting paid for the 80 hours a week that I was learning too.  The degree just gets people looking at my resume to interview me more frequently.  Everyone still hands me a knife and says \"Cut this\" to see if I know my shit or not.   If anything chefs are more skeptical about my skills coming from school because a lot of kids that graduate do think they are rock-stars and DO need to get knocked down a peg.  In-industry, real word, I've seen a dishwasher prep faster than  3 intern cooks from the local school.  You learn way more in industry than school for sure.  Granted my degree trained me how to interpret financials and run/own a culinary business or hotel.   ",

She taught me how fractions work, using measuring cups and spoons. I was obsessed with knives, so I couldn't wait to get to chop veggies. I learned about slices, dices, chopping, and juliennes. She taught me how to flip an egg without breaking it, and how to know when a pancake is ready to flip. \n\nBut I wasn't just a domestic little dude. My dad was a carpenter, and he involved me in his projects, too. He taught me how to put a screw in - and take it out - and how to drive a nail, too (he taught me many other things, but listing them would be pointless).\n\nThese are all things that you could learn from YouTube or instructables, if you had the chance to try them hands on. But what would be the point of parents? Those are some of my fondest memories with my parents. I can't imagine neglecting that opportunity as a parent - let alone blaming my kid for my own failure.

            "comment": "$240,000.  That's how much each Baby Boomer owes each Millennial.  The math: $18 trillion in national debt added since 1980 that the 76 million Boomers added that the 79 million Millennials now have to pay off (or service the interest). \n\nBoomers sucked more out of the U.S. than any prior generation, wrecked the financial markets as Millennials were entering the workforce, and distorted pay in favor of the  executive class (read: older) over the working class, then have the audacity to bitch about Millennials still living with their parents. \n\nDon't listen to this BS. Vote, and vote for someone who will reform one of the biggest government-backed transfers of wealth in this nation: social security. ",

I'm not saying everyone is one way or the other, but I can tell you that most of my worst patients are my mom's age or older. They hate waiting, they think you have no idea what you're doing (I'm licensed BECAUSE I know what I'm doing), and most are cheap cheap cheap. Never did I believe someone would have the gall to complain about a pair of glasses being finished too soon. Never did I think someone would argue with me over two pairs of glasses for under $40. They wail and moan if they have to wait more than two minutes (our location is super busy and almost always short-staffed). I even had to tell a nice classy woman off yesterday for telling me it was \"retarded\" that I couldn't fix her glasses she didn't even buy from us. Spent 15 minutes trying to fix them and it's \"retarded\" that I cant. I could write a novel. It does my head in, and is definitely why I drink.",

    "postText": "The manager hesitated for a moment on the phone. \"I'm sorry, can you repeat that?\" he asked the newly hired immigrant worker.\n\n\"I...rub the storm...balls?\" the man said, coughing.\n\nBefore he could ask again, the manager heard a little commotion on the line, followed by a younger voice. \n\n\"I'm so sorry, my father has been learning English. He won't be making it into work today because he's feeling sick.\"\n\n\"Oh! That's perfectly fine, but...what was the part about rubbing...storm balls...?\"\n\nThe kid laughed. \"We were working on popular English idioms this week. He was trying to say he's feeling under the weather.\"",

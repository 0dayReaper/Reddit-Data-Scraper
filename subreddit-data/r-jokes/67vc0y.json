    "postText": "The bartender asks \"Why the long face?\" \n\nThe man replies \"I just found out my wife is sleeping with another man. I've decided I'm going to drink myself to death.\" \n\nThe bartender looks shocked and says \"I'm sorry I can't help you kill yourself.\" \n\nThe man asks \"Well what would you do in my situation?\"\n\nThe bartender puffs himself up a bit and says \"If I found out a guy was sleeping with my wife I wouldn't sit around feeling sorry for myself, I'd kill the guy.\"\n\nThe man jumps up from his stool and shouts \"That's a great idea! Thanks!\" and runs out of the bar.\n\nA couple hours goes by and the bartender is starting to get nervous when the man walks back into the bar with a smile on his face.\n\n\"Did you kill the guy?\" The bartender asks nervously.\n\n\"Nope! I slept with your wife. Whiskey please.\"",

It's a Sith legend. Darth Plaguinness was a Dark Lord of the IPA so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create... illusion. He had such a knowledge of the Bar Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about... from getting sober. He became so intoxicated, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his buzz... which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice Jim Bean everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his drunken sleep. Ironic. He could save others from sobriety... but not himself.\n\nEDIT: Intoxicated/buzz. Thanks!",

Attendant says, \"wtf - you have 5 penguins in your back seat.\"  \n  \n\"I KNOW!\" the guy says, \"They jumped in at the light, and now I don't know what to do.\"  \n  \nAttendant thinks for a second and says, \"I'll tell you what I'd do - I'd take them to the zoo.\"  \n  \n\"That's a great idea!\" says the driver.  \n  \nA week later, same driver pulls in with the same 5 penguins, only now they're wearing sunglasses.  \n  \n\"What are you doing - I thought I told you to take those penguins to the zoo!\" exclaims the attendant.  \n  \n\"We did go!  We had a great time!  Today we're going to the beach!\"",

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and I've been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.\ufeff\n\n",

She smiles.\n\"Conversation with me, duh.\"\nI laugh.\n\"What's so funny?\" she protests.\n\"Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the egos?\"\n\"You get used to it,\" she says, lighting her cigarette and handing me back the lighter.\n\"What would you do if you weren't an actress?\" I ask.\n\"Teaching, I think.\"\n\"And if I was your student, what would I be learning?\"\n\"Discipline,\" she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. \"Where are you from?\"\n\"Bermuda,\" I say.\n\"Oh wow.

He gets out to look and sees oil dripping out of the motor. He drives to the nearest town and stops at the first gas station.\n\n&gt;After dropping the car off, the penguin goes for a walk around town. He sees an ice-cream shop and, being a penguin in Arizona, decides that something cold would really hit the spot. He gets a big dish of ice cream and sits down to eat. Having no hands he makes a real mess trying to eat with his flippers. After finishing his ice cream, he goes back to the gas station and asks the mechanic if he's found the problem. The mechanic looks up and says \"It looks like you blew a seal.\"\n\n&gt;\"No no,\" the penguin replies, \"it's just ice cream.\"\n\n(When telling the joke in person, I recommend wiping your mouth at the comma in the punchline.)

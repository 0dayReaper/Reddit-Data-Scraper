The second biker spits a wad of chewing tobacco into his coffee. The third biker dumps the whole plate onto the floor.\n\nWithout a word of protest, the old guy pays his bill and leaves.\n\n\u201cNot much of a man, was he?\u201d says one of the bikers.\n\n\u201cNot much of a driver, either,\u201d says the waitress. \u201cHe just backed his truck over three motorcycles.\u201d",

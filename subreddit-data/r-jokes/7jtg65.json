She said, \"yea they said this was going to free up the internet.\"\n\nI looked at her and said...no...no that's not right at all. I had to tell her that her beloved Netflix would cost an extra $25 in a \"streaming package\" because Comcast has the right to do that now that they aren't being held back. \n\nShe said \"so it's freeing up the internet for Comcast?\" \n\nIt was sad in it's own way to see the realization hit her like that.

    "postText": "So my friend and I were at his place and for some reason argued about who was smarter than the other, so we decided to do an online IQ test.\n\nHe went first, as he was sitting at the computer, while I looked on. He scored an impressive 120. Then it was my turn: 121.\n\nThere was a moment of silence. \n\"Well, now we know who is smarter,\" I said.\n\n\"That's not fair, you got to look at my answers,\" protested my friend .\n\n\"Yes, that's because I'm smarter.\"",

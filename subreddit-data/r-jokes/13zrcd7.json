Tragically however the clasp  holding to the van at the end closest to the rear doors broke off just as the van was rounding the corner.  The whip antenna sprung free and nicked the man's arm.   He didn't think much of it at the time, but later he got an infection.  The infection got worse and worse.  Eventually, he decided to go to the hospital but very sadly died there!  The coroner confirmed the cause of death; van arial disease.",

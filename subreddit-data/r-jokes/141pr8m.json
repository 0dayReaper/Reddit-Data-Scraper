Thing is, the cannibals are from a tribe where makeup and headdresses are worn, so they looked kinda funny to the locals in 800BC, and when they started talking about time travel the locals burst out laughing, then killed them and ate them, because that's what they did with clowns over there, back then.\n\nBut you know what they didn't do? They didn't fucking say the 'does this taste funny to you' joke because even then it was fucking ancient.",

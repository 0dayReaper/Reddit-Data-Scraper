    "postText": "\nThe first guy immediately shouts out \"I want a billion pounds.\" *POOF*, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says \"I want to be the richest man alive.\" *POOF*, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says \"I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life.\" *POOF*, his arm starts rotating. \n\nThe Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: \"I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.\" *POOF*, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says \"I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.\" *POOF*, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says \"I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.\" *POOF*, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. \n\nThe genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says \"I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.\" *POOF*, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says \"I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.\" *POOF*, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says \"My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.\" *POOF*, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. \n\nMany years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: \"I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.\" Second guy smiles and says \"Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.\" Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: \"*Guys, I think I fucked up.*\"",

He rang the bell but nobody answered so he opened the door to see an old lamp lying near broken glass and a huge fat Arabian man wearing a turban sitting on the couch\n\n\r  \nDylan asked, \"Who are you?\" The fat man replied, \"I am a genie you have freed from that lamp.\"\r  \n\r  \nDylan questioned, \"Oh man, do I get three wishes?\" The genie replied, \"Since you freed me by accident you only get two and I get one.\"\r  \n\r  \nDylan thought about it and realized what he wanted, \"I want to be the best golfer ever.\" The surprised genie said, \"You sure? Most people wish for money, but okay. Now your wife gets one wish.\"\r  \n\r  \nDylan brought over his wife who wished right away, \"I want a million dollars every week of my life.\" The genie said, \"Granted. And now for my wish, I have been cramped up in that lamp for many years so its been a while since I've been with a woman. I want one day of wild, crazy sex with your wife, Dylan.\"\r  \n\r  \nDylan said, \"No way!\" The genie replied, \"Not even for a million dollars a week?\" Dylan turned to his wife, who said, \"I guess for all that, I should. Well, not until Dylan leaves.\" Dylan said, \"Okay, have fun, I guess,\" and left.\r  \n\r  \nDylan's wife then proceeded to have wild sex for the rest of the day with the genie. When they were finished, the genie asked how old her husband was. \n\nShe said, \"Forty-five.\" \n\nThe Genie laughed and said, \"Isn't he a little old to be believing in genies?\"",

He doesn't really wanna do this but feels like he really has to. \"Hey man, do you, uh, need help?\" The guy turns around with a huge relieved grin on his face. \"Oh my god, would you?? Thank you so much, i had no idea what I was gonna do.\" \"Uh, no problem,\" he says as he comes up behind the guy, reaches around him, undoes his pants and takes out his penis.\n\nImmediately he regrets his decision. This is the grossest penis he has ever seen. Covered in open sores, seeping black pustules, and these weird spiky bits around the head that could be teeth. This could have been HR Giger's penis. But he's in too deep now, so he shudders, holds his breath, aims and waits. The guy lets loose, sighing in extreme relief as a stream of thick bluish oily liquid flows out.\n\nHe gives him the requisite three shakes, tucks him back in, zips his pants up and goes to the sink to try and burn his hands off with hot water. Scrubbing furiously while the guy is profusely thanking him over and over. Finally he says \"hey, you know, I'm happy to help, but I have GOT to ask. What the hell is wrong with your dick???\" The guy pulls his arms out from under his shirt and says \"man, i have no idea but I'm sure as hell not touching it\"",

Not able to discern which of the two freed him, his voice boomed towards the two of them and said that they each get 3 wishes.\n\nThe bear went first. I want all the bears in this forest except for me to be females. POOF, all the existing bears and cubs in the forest turned female.\n\nThe rabbit said \"I want a dirt bike that's exactly my side that never runs out of gas and the tires never wear out. POOF. A tiny KTM dirtbike that's perfectly sized for the rabbit appeared before the rabbit. He starts it up.\n\nThe bear's second wish: I want all the bears IN THE WORLD to become all females. POOF. All the polar bears, sun bears, even the pandas in China, became female.\n\nThe rabbit said \"I want full riding gear: Helmets, gloves, and boots. I want them all top of the line, Kevlar where it needs to be. And in my size, of course. POOF. The rabbit is already wearing them.\n\nFor the bear's final wish: \"I want unlimited stamina so I can roam around, swim around, and be able to bang all the females!\" POOF. The bear's panting stopped. He was ready run full sprint, non-stop.\n\nThe rabbit's last wish: Make that bear gay.",

    "postText": "A man and his wife were checking out of their hotel room when the front desk presented their bill. \n\nThe worker at the front desk said, \"For room service, mini bar, and two movies, that will be $210.\" \n\n\"No,\" said the wife, \"We only watched one movie.\" \n\n\"It's okay,\" said the husband, quickly placing down his credit card.\" \n\n\"Um, no. We arent paying for a movie we didn't watch.\" She turned to the front desk, \"There's been a mistake. What movies do you think we watched?\" \n\n\"Well, you ordered Schindler's List from the movie classics channel, and you ordered...Um, Backdoor Sluts, from the adult channel....\"\n\nA look of fury swept over the wife's face. She turned, glaring at her husband. \n\n\"I'm so sorry baby,\" he said to his wife, \"I watched it while you were at your conference.\"  \n\nShe raised her voice to a shout. \"My god, Tom. You sick bastard. You just cant help yourself, can you!? Will you ever be able to stop masturbating to holocaust movies?\"",

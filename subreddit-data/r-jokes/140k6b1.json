They take you out in the morning, have you drag carts, turn millstones, pull the plough, and after dark they feed you a nothing but hay. Meanwhile I'm just eating, sleeping and rolling around in the mud all day long, I sure am lucky not to be you.\n\nThe donkey turns towards the pig, leers at him, and replies: \"Yeah. The pig that was here last year said the same thing.\"",

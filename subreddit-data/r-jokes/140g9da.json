Uh huh\u2026\n\nHe had no intention of buying one, he just wanted to see what what all the fuss was about. And the answer was his Honda Africa Twin rode far far nicer.",

High temperatures result in high NoX. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are scooter makers in Bangladesh making worse emissions but for 1st world bikes they are likely \u2018king of the road\u2019. \n\nThe bikes run like trash out of the box. Everyone immediately does a \u2018ECU tune\u2019 which makes the emissions back to 1970\u2019s spec but it runs good. If you don\u2019t the rear cylinder runs at like 230F from being so lean and just melts down.",

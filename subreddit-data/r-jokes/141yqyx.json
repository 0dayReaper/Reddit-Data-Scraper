    "postText": "When he notices something wriggling on the side of the road. Curiosity gets the best of him, and he pulls over to investigate. Once he gets up close, he sees it is a naked man, bound, gagged, and left for dead. The trucker removes the gag, and the man immediately said \"Oh thank God you stopped. I've been stranded out here all night. I picked up a hitchhiker, and as soon as we started off, he pulled a gun, kidnapped my wife, and kids, stole my car, stole my wallet, made me strip naked, and tied me up out here.\"\n\nThe truck driver chuckled, put the gag back in the man's mouth, and, as he pulled out his member, said, \"Well, tonight just ain't your night.\"",

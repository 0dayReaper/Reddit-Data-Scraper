They then expelled the priest and bishop from the church's patio. Why do this? So he could take a few pictures with a bible in front of it. Think about it - the government straight up attacked a church, cleared out its legitimate occupants, all without asking or informing the people who own that building, so that they could take tweetable pictures.\n\nGiven that he is certainly the least religious President this country has ever had and represents the exact antithesis of all of Jesus's teachings, the sheer opportunism and narcissism required to do a photo-op in the middle of such social unrest has attracted a lot of ridicule and scorn. Not least from the Bishop of said church, who is *pissed* that her church was used this way.\n\nHence, \"Why did the chicken (trump) cross the road? To take a picture in front of the church\"",

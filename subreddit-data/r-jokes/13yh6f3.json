Then, nail the carp to a cedar board (approximately 2\"x8\"x30\"). Place that in the oven for 2 and a half hours or until the fish is flaky. Pull the nail, throw the carp away, and eat the board.",

Oregano is particularly good. Wrap it in tinfoil and cook it in the oven for 60 to 90 minutes. Then throw away the fish and eat the tinfoil.\n\nIn reality, pike is actually very tasty.",

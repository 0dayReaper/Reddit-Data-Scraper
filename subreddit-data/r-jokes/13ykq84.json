    "postText": "Early in the morning at the Pryvoz market, Benya meets Izya with a suitcase and three rubles in his hand. Benya asks, \"Izya, where are you headed?\"\nIzya replies, \"Ah, Benya, I'm going to the port. Finally decided to go to America, gonna buy some cable!\"\n\"Well, good luck!\" Benya responds, while thinking to himself, \"But how much cable can this shmuck buy with three rubles?\"...\n\nThree months later, Izya brings eight thousand kilometers of cable to Odesa on a cargo ship. Benya, bewildered, meets Izya at the port and asks, \"How did this happen?!\"\nIzya replies, \"Well, I docked at the port, approached the cable merchant, and said, 'Here are three rubles, give me 100 meters of cable.' He immediately burst out laughing and said, 'For three rubles, I can only sell you a piece from the tip of your nose to the tip of your dick!'\"\n\"And? What happened next?\"\n\"Little did they know that the tip of my dick is located in the Brodsky Synagogue...\"",

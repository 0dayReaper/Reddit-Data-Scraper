    "postText": "The Sherriff and a Deputy were riding through the country one day when they pass the Old McMackson farm. The deputy notices that farmer Old McMackson is using a fertilizer banned by local ordinance. They pull up to the farm, but by the time they get there, they realize Old McMackson has put away his fertilizer bags. The sheriff asks if they can look inside his shed. Now Old McMackson knows his rights, but also likes to have fun. He tells the Sherriff they can look all they like, if they bring him 3 badgers.\n\nThis seems strange to the officers, but it's easier than getting a warrant. They drive around, and after about three hours, they find some badgers. The deputy gets out to chase some. Now badgers are harder to catch than most people realize, but eventually the deputy wins the struggle. He gets the Mustelidaes in the patrol car. Now what they notice until than is how bad these badgers smells. Even with the windows down it's awful. Eventually the sheriff can take it anymore, so he lets the badgers out.  \n\nThe officers return to the farm, and Old McMackson is waiting for them expectantly. The Sheriff walks past him, and kicks open the shed door.\n\nOld McMackson angrily says \"We had a deal! Where are my badgers?\"\n\n The Sherriff looks back, and replies \"Badgers? We don't need no stickin' badgers!\"",

When Humphrey Bogart's character asks them, if they are federales, then where are their badges?, the chief bandit replies, \"We don't have to show you any stinking badges!\"  Most misquoted line in cinema history.   The quoted line, \"We don't need no stinking badges!\", was actually used in Mel Brooks 1974 film, \"Blazing Saddles\" as a humerous nod to Sierra Madre and the misquote used for decades.",

In it there is a very famous scene where an outlaw impersonating a cop is trying to intimidate someone.\n\nThe man says \"If you are the police, where are your badges? Let's see them.\"\n\nThe outlaw replies with (among other things) \"We have no badges. In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges..\"\n\nThis was later parodied by Blazing Saddles as  \"We don't need no stinking badges!\"",

To find the overall magnitude of the point on the graph (pi,1), you'd do the same as you would if it were any other graph: use pytagoras' theorem. So, \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) is |z| (the z is the point, and the pipes mean modulus), which is kinda adding together the numbers. Sorta. Basically, the answer comes out at 3.3ish, which *is* barely more than three.",

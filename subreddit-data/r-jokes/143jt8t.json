    "postText": "All went well for the first couple of weeks, then one morning as the toilet committee were inspecting the toilet, they found that one of the windows was smashed. They asked all the animals what had happened, and the rabbit said, \"Last night the bear was taking a shit, and the toilet was out of paper, so he grabbed me and wiped his ass on my fur, and then threw me through the window.\" So the committee repaired the window and life went on as before.\n\nThen after another couple of weeks, there was another broken window. The committee asked all the animals what had happened, and the fox said, \"Last night the bear was taking a shit, and the toilet was out of paper, so he grabbed me and wiped his ass on my fur, and then threw me through the window.\" So the committee repaired the window and life went on as before.\n\nThen after another couple of weeks, the committee found the entire facility smashed to matchwood. They were dismayed at the wanton destruction, and they asked all the animals if they had any idea what had happened.\n\n\"I might know,\" said the hedgehog.",

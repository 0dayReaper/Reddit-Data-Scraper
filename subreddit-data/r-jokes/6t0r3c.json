Much of that frustration was also fueled by those people's perception of their own assignments as less-than-ideal. This created some jealousy and a feeling like she \"didn't deserve\" to do a report on Nirvana.\n\nIt probably appeared to some that she was a \"fake fan.\" Honestly, though, I believe she may have been legitimately familiar with their music. I think that the rising popularity of streaming and diminishing popularity of physical CDs has put more focus on songs than on albums, and I think that that shift likely contributed to her not knowing the name of the album.",

Say I come to your place with my laptop, and I want to log onto the Internet.\n\nSure. That's why we have WiFi in the first place.\n\nSee? See? There it is again. You have WiFi, so you gotta have a password. And there I am at your place with my laptop. All powered up. And I try to log into your network, and it asks me for the password. What do I type?\n\nWe don't have WiFi.\n\nYou don't have... whadaya mean you don't have WiFi?\n\nI already you told you we got it.

Or who he married at all, as the only woman to appear in dwarven histories is Thorin's sister D\u00eds. So that is to say there is confirmably no information on Thorin's maternal heritage, ergo no support for this idea. \n\nSecond we do know why dwarves are generally in decline and its rooted in only a third of their births being female and not even close to that eventually reproducing. The women being just as craft minded as the menfolk often do not marry (who also oft don't for the same reason) or when they can't get their first pick of dwarves refuse any other. Being willing to marry Men rather mucks this up royally.\n\nNext umm greed is like their defining character flaw. Lots and lots of mentions with incidents as far back as the tragedy of the Nauglimir. Hell it's why they are sometimes accused of being Jewish sterotypes IRL, something not helped by their rather Semitic tongue. It also directly reflects Aule making them as unyielding as possible and Tolkien's running theme of crafters being jealous possessive assholes. See Morgoth and Feanor and Saruman for other examples. \n\nAnd possessing one of the Seven makes them even more greedy. Again explicitly in the text. It just doesn't do much beyond that save make it easier for them to accumulate even more gold in some nebulous way as magic tends to be in Middle-Earth. Presumably not the full Draupnir though as they 'need gold to breed gold' as it goes. \n\nIncidentially dwarves can be corrupted (presumably through their own flaws) as a few *ergo not zero* are mentioned as fighting for evil. Just ya know none of Durin's folk because gotta keep that Euro-centric hierarchy in place",

That area was already breached and I think the officers were abandoning their position to take up a new one inside the Capitol. My take is that the officers were not going to be able to hold that barrier long anyway against the crowds.\n\nThere is another video a female officer allegedly waving protesters/insurgents through a breach in the outer perimeter toward the Capitol. That video is cropped in such a way that you can't see that she appears to be waving for officers a bit further out to join her. They do, and then they retreat towards the Capitol together.\n\nI don't know what to make of the video of the guy who took a selfie with an officer inside the Capitol. At that point the police seem to have been overrun by insurgents who weren't immediately trying to kill them. I'm not sure what they were supposed to be doing if anything.",

Could you imagine if a video spread around of one black person breaking one window during one BLM protest and every major news agency in the country immediately reporting that \"black people were breaking windows during BLM protest\" as if it was some widespread issue?",

They had a massive attack on Mordor, so it would distract Sauron and his forces, thinking that one of the people in the attack army had the ring, when really, there were hobbits sneaking around with the ring. \n\nPlus, Sauron under protected Mount Doom because it never came to his mind someone who actually try to destroy the ring. He thought that whoever had the ring would have just wanted to keep it to themselves (which did actually happen, Frodo in the end wanted the ring for himself, but so did Gollum, so they fought for it, and it fell into Mount Doom). Which is always why they used hobbits as ring carriers. They are the best burglars, being quiet and light, but most importantly, they are the least likely to take the ring for themselves.

Take the actual time to listen to someone and hear their worries and frustrations, no matter how irrational they may seem. That includes your anti-vax aunt, your racist brother-in-law and your weird blue-haired niece. \n\nTheir hatred for [big pharma / Mexicans / the patriarchy] did not arise over night. It built up over time as problems, worries and concerns they have were ignored and dismissed. \n\nWhatever you may think of their beliefs, the problems they see are real for them, and the more you attack and ridicule and ignore them, the further they will withdraw. And the internet has plenty of places for them to withdraw to.\n\nInstead, talk to them, listen to them, take time to get to the underlying cause. You don't have to agree with them, or believe what they do, and you don't have to pretend as if you do. All you have to do is talk to them and really, seriously listen. There's almost always something more fundamental underneath that causes the hatred. A real problem that requires a real solution. If you can find that and address it, you can help them move past it and turn the hatred from their hearts into something more productive. Just be careful that it doesn't infect yours.",

You could put a flat-earther on the ISS and they could look out of the window and see the earth is round and they would STILL believe it's flat and argue that you set them up, it's a screen, etc. \n\nPeople hold onto this stuff because it becomes a part of who they are. Changing that belief becomes almost impossible.  How many people have refused medical treatment and died because they were convinced some deity they've never seen or some essential oil or diet would heal them? How many people have given money and continue to give money to charlatan cult leaders and televangelists? How many people have died following this nonsense (Heavens Gate, etc)? We need to stop coddling people's ridiculous beliefs because we don't want to hurt their feelings. We need to treat this nonsense and the people who peddle it for power and profit as the threat they are.",

    "postText": "A monocle walks into a bar. After a few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and a little uncoordinated). He reaches for a cigarette, but the bartender stops him. \"Sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. You'll have to step outside to smoke.\"\n\nSo the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. Meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. They bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. They try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.\n\nThe bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. \"Hey you two!\" he shouts. \"Stop making spectacles of yourselves!\"",

He would embellish them more and more every time to get an even bigger groan-reaction.\n\nThe joke:\n\nOne day, a really smart panda escaped the zoo. They had spent years learning the English language and observing human interactions, so they were able to get pretty far. The panda took various busses and taxis to get where he wanted to go; the nearest Red Light district.\n\nThis panda was itching for some nookie. People assumed pandas were uninterested in mating, but truthfully they just preferred other species. So this talking panda started wandering around looking for Ladies of the Night to pleasure him. Eventually, after many failed attempts (some human women aren't keen on fornicating with bears), the panda found a woman willing to take him to bed.\n\nShe brought him to her place (after the panda explained his place was a cage filled with bamboo and bear shit). As she started to walk upstairs, the panda asked the prostitute to cook him a meal. It had been a long journey so he was famished. The prostitute wasn't too keen on this idea, but it had been a slow night so she figured it was wise not to sour the deal. She made the panda a Thai curry dish because it doesn't matter for the purpose of the joke and I love Thai food. The panda gobbled it all up.\n\nFinally, the panda and the prostitute went upstairs for a night of mutually consensual bestiality. Neither character was especially adept at the act, but they both enjoyed the moment as much as they were able to. After about 45 minutes of awkwardness the panda finally unloaded his weird talking bear semen into the industrial strength condom the prostitute had managed to dig out, and they both fell asleep in the bed.\n\nThe next morning, the paid panda escort woke up expecting to see her money on the bedside table. When it was nowhere to be seen she expected to see the panda next to her - but he was gone. She ran downstairs just in time to see the panda heading for the front door. She yelled at him \"**HEY!** What do you think you're doing?!\"\n\nThe panda replied \"I'm going home? Thanks for evening, but I should probably get back.\"\n\nThe prostitute responded \"Not without my money!\"\n\n\"Money?\" the panda inquired.\n\nThe prostitute retorted with \"Yeah, *money*! Look up Prostitute in the dictionary: it says 'Person who exchanges sexual favours for money', okay?\"\n\nThe panda responded \"Okay, look up panda in the dictionary; \"Eats; shoots and leaves.\"\n\n---\n\nI can't believe I typed all that from my phone. I'm so sorry.",

Don't glass over all the unimportant details, focus on them, and let them frame your joke. But don't browbeat us with one, throw in 20/20 or more. Maybe you didn't see clearly the joke it could become. Eye say you should tear up this version and make it a vision. Don't be convexed by the effort. If you shade it right and keep your eye on the prize, it will be something beautiful to behold.",

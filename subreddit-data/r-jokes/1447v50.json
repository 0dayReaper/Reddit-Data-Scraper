He would come home, puke in the sink, and then pass out.\n\nOne day, the wife happened upon a dead and bloody cat that was run over in the road. Her plan was to put it in the sink so when her husband puked then night, he would be too drunk to realize it was a dead cat and mistake it for his own blood, and maybe he would quit drinking.\n\nThat night, the man came home and puked in the sink. The next morning, she asked her husband how his night was. He said, \"I didn't sleep all night.\"\n\nSmuggly, she asked, \"And why is that?\"\n\n\"When I got home last night, I was so drunk, I puked my guts out in the sink.\"\n\nSmiling, the wife asked what did he do next.\n\n\"I spent the rest of the night trying to put them all back in!\"",

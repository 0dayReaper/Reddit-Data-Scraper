Sharing this for I\u2019m still disappointed about the outcome of the elections here :D Hope you\u2019ll find it funny. Here it goes: \n\nAs one of the largest cities in the Empire lacks a proper bridge, the Ottoman Sultan gets one built, but it drains the treasury, and the Vizier tells him that if they charge one gold for the usage of the bridge, they can quickly restore the treasury, and even profit. The Sultan, however, says that charging for the usage of a bridge would cause an uproar, and would spell disaster for them. The Vizier assures him that the people would never revolt whatever happens, but the Sultan is sure that nobody would want to pay for crossing a bridge, and they make a bet.\nAfter a month, nobody complains, and the Sultan, slightly pissed off, doubles the rate, and tells the Vizier that a revolt is at hand. Nothing happens after another month, which angers the Sultan further, who orders that anyone who uses the bridge will pay two golds and will be slapped in the face by a guard. Nothing continues to happen, and the Sultan, raging at this point, orders that anyone who crosses the bridge will pay 2 golds, will be slapped, and then will be fucked in the ass. \nCertain that this will end up in a revolt, the Sultan puts on his disguise and heads to the bridge with the Vizier to see what\u2019s going on. When they approach to the scene, they see a long line extending for miles. Sultan asks someone what they queued for, and the guy tells him that he is waiting his turn to pay, get slapped and fucked to cross the bridge. Shocked, the Sultans screams: \u201cHow come nobody has a problem with this madness?!\u201d \nSomeone in the line yells back: \u201c I have one! I told them that one guard wasn\u2019t enough, they should bring one more! The guy is getting tired!\u201d",

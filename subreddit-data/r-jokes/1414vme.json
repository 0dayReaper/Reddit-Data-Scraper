Jesus asks \"My son, are you a believer?\" The Russian replies \"No.\" With a wave of his hands, Jesus changes it to a glass of wine. \"Well my son, do you believe now?\" The Russian frowns and shakes his head.\n\nThe next day, Jesus comes into the bar and sees the same man. \"My son, are you a believer yet?\" The Russian replies \"No.\" Jesus waves his hands and behold! The glass again is changed to wine. \"Well my son, now you surely believe?\" The Russian frowns and shakes his head.\n\nOn the third day, Jesus enters the bar and approaches the Russian. \"My son, are you a believer yet?\"\n\nThe Russian looks up \"If i say I believe, will you just leave my vodka alone today?\"",

The bartender is a blonde girl with a baseball bat.\n\n2. The bouncer is a blonde girl with a 'Billy-Club'.\n\n3. I'm a 6-foot tall, 175-pound blonde woman with a black belt in karate.\n\n4. The woman sitting next to me is blonde and a professional weight lifter.\n\n5. The lady to your right is blonde and a professional wrestler.\n\n'Now, think about it seriously, Cowboy ... do you still wanna tell that blonde joke?'\n\nThe blind cowboy thinks for a second, shakes his head and mutters, \u201cNo ... not if I'm gonna have to explain it five times\"...",

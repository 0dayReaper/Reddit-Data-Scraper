They really didn't give a fuck about 9/11 outside of a few factors:\n\n- the money they lost on that day\n- the money they lost in the aftermath\n- the need to appease the American people when they demanded justice\n- protecting their brand image as strongest nation\n- how they could exploit this event to suit their interests \n\nIt didn't really matter who did 9/11. They just needed to recoup their losses and keep the public satisfied and their image intact. So they invaded a foreign country where Bin Laden was rumoured to be, despite him having no connections to the Afghan government at the time, just because it looked like they were doing something. They concocted the whole \"War on Terror\" as a means to destabilise the whole region to better suit their interests. They got their money back ten-fold by ensuring they got first pick of mineral rights in the region and by creating a market for arms manufacturers. \n\nEven if they knew it was the Saudis, a war with another major capitalist power, a fellow G20 nation wouldn't suit their interests at all. Especially since the Saudis are a key balwark to left-wing politics in the Middle East, it's a country specifically designed for that purpose. Plus, if the 9/11 hijackers were pissed about US bases occupying holy land in other countries, the entire Muslim world would sure as hell be pissed if they started bombing the birthplace of Islam. Also, it would be a prolonged war, kinda like the current Ukraine crisis, cause both sides would have access to a hell of a lot of firepower. \n\nNo they're gonna go after the countries that are a hell of a lot weaker and easier to subject to neo-colonial rule. Countries that suit their interests to colonise. Plus getting rid of the Taliban was better for business. Theocracies rarely suit capitalist interests, so they tried to install their own puppet government in Afghanistan instead as they did in Iraq, replacing the pseudo-socialist government there. \n\nAt the end of the day the global capitalist class don't want to go to war with each other. They're friendly rivals in business but recognise there's a lot more money to be made from invading weaker nations or funding proxy wars in their territory. \n\nThere'll always be large sections of the white US bourgeoisie that hate the Saudis because of the whole muslim thing but ultimately financial interest wins the day. Just look at Trump who talked a big islamophobic game on the capaign trail and immediately capitulated when he smelled a business opportunity.",

The Quality of Life stuff is huge on the 3rd party stuff, but more than that is for people with disabilities. The reddit app provides little too know assistance for people who are vision impaired. Add onto that the fact that many mods and content creators use alternate apps because of issues with the official one and this is just a disaster from every direction",

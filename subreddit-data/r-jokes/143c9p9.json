I wasn\u2019t just meaning \u201chaha yeah let\u2019s make jokes about queer people cause I want to say offensive shit without repercussions,\u201d I meant it as if we avoid making *good* jokes in good humor about anybody we\u2019re artificially placing them on a pedestal of untouchability that only serves to distance them from others who may want to get closer and puts a target on them for those who wish them ill. \n\nYou\u2019re the one who assumed I meant normalcy as in heteronormativity. What I was trying to say is that it should be considered a normal experience to know and care about and be around trans people in the same way it should be normal to know and care about and be around anybody else. I\u2019m not going to insult the people I choose to care about by putting them on a pedestal because of a trait that fundamentally does not impact the fact that I care about them. I\u2019ll avoid things that are sensitive because making fun of people isn\u2019t the same as making a joke about them. The latter is what you do with friends while the former is often discriminatory.\n\nI treat trans folks like people because that\u2019s what they are. If they\u2019re lovely people who care for others I will see that and appreciate that, as a I meant to with my initial comment. If they\u2019re a dick to me I don\u2019t care about their genitals or gender, I\u2019m not going to like them and that\u2019s okay. By and large the trans folks I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting have been generally pretty great and loving people. They\u2019ve also agreed with my general standpoint of \u201ctreat trans people like people\u201d so I\u2019m going to keep doing it.\n\nI wasn\u2019t some patronizing cis-man telling the cute little trans boy good job \u201cbehaving\u201d like he\u2019s a toddler. I was a man telling another man that I thought his choice of how he was interpreting the situation was a positive thing because it *is*.\n\nI\u2019m assuming you just were geared up to interpret what I said poorly, so it\u2019s not a huge deal but please don\u2019t shoot down genuine praise of social conduct. He chose to interpret a joke as a joke. He didn\u2019t make conflict where there was no intent to start one. That\u2019s praiseworthy in this day and age for anyone in any group, sad as it is, and I believe being told exactly what you\u2019re doing is \u201chow to be\u201d is high praise.\n\nI don\u2019t particularly like being told I\u2019m being rude when I only mean to be supportive simply because I wanted to leave a short, supportive comment for once instead of a over-nuanced essay with copious detail and specific language written over the course of an hour or more.",

You can think of normativity as meaning that something is treated as correct. For example, morality is a normative judgement - it's saying that some actions are right, and others are wrong. Cis- and hetero- normativity are respectively talking about the systems that place being cisgender and being heterosexual as the 'way things should be' - they have nothing to do with which sexualities are more or less common than others.\n\nThat being said, calling something \"normal\" or \"natural\" can be a normative judgement in some contexts. If people aren't very careful about phrasing, context, and audience, they can contribute to the marginalization of queer folks when they say, for example, that being cisgender and heterosexual is \"an intrinsic result of evolution\".",

For hegemonic and dominant groups, equality feels like oppression, so you feel a compulsion to centre yourself and push to the front of everything.

You said you'd take back those jokes if they contributed to marginalization or misogyny, especially given that Poles are victims of xenophobia. So my first question is, what about simply the feelings of the person? Is it only large scale socio-political things that matter in your opinion? In other words, would you not take back a joke if it hurt someone but they were not, in your opinion, marginalized? Conversely, would you never utter a joke that was potentially offensive to some marginalized group even if all of the members of the subject group who were around told you they don't care about that kind of thing and to go ahead and tell it?",

What I think you\u2019re actually asking is if I would be so sensitive to the feelings of someone who didn\u2019t like a joke at the expense of whiteness or straightness or Britishness and the answer is no, because jokes at the expense of marginalised people contributed to marginalisation while jokes at the expense of these hegemonic and dominant groups help to deconstruct the system of oppression by degrading the status of these privileged classes and groups.",

It happens, and these people have enough experience as professionals to fix them. When they throw out that experience and let their mistakes get to the plate, of course a head chef is going to be unceremoniously chewing them out. Why the fuck hire someone with 5-10+ years experience if they're just going to make year 1 rookie mistakes and let them get to the serving dish? The only slightly odd thing is that Gordon is willing to shout with the public eye on him, but because of his status as one of the best chefs out there, he earns the right to tell a donkey to go fuck himself for making a dish so oily BP is already claiming it had nothing to do with it.",

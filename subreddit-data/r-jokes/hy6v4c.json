Let's see how close you are.\n\nLet's say she can get $300 an hour consistently, and 4 meetings per night, which is essentially full time considering time needed to prep and advertise for each meeting. She spends 5 days working and two days traveling per week. Hotel rooms going for an average of $100 a night, $30 a day for food since she has to eat all her meals from restaurants, another $30 in daily transportation/delivery costs, $200 a month in new clothes and accessories for \"business\" purposes, and an extra $100 in miscellaneous monthly costs brings us to roughly $170 per day in expenses vs $1200 per day in earnings. Let's give our poor girl 2 weeks off for personal time, and that brings us to $360,500 per year, or $1.8 million in 5 years. \n\nOf course, that's under the table money. Getting that safely into a bank without the IRS cracking down on you will cost a money launderer's fee plus self reported taxes. After a 20% money launderer's fee and 15% in income taxes (which is probably generous considering her annual income), we land at $1.225 million over 5 years.\n\nShe's doing pretty damn well, but not well enough to buy the *really* big stuff in the joke.",

It's not even hiding. It's just making implausible claims with a straight face and an accountant to pronounce it polysyllabically.\n\nBut your point is 80% taken.

I think they think this because we have a \"Hail Mary\" prayer that is the big emphasis of the Catholic rosary but it's more that we revere her. We don't pray Hail Mary to worship her or have her directly influence our lives, but instead to have her *intercede* on our behalves. I rarely but sometimes also hear this issue but concerning other Saints instead of Mary. The same thing applies. We revere them, look to them for guidance, ask to intercede for us, etc. But *we don't worship them.*\n\nThe other misunderstanding I hear alot from Protestants is that we aren't Christian (we definitely are). We Catholics worship Jesus Christ, we believe he's the Son of God and we believe that salvation comes from him. (It's kinda all there in the Nicene Creed that we pray in Church.)\n\nAnother one I hear is that Catholics don't read the Bible. This is kinda true (outside of Mass) but it's much more a cultural thing than an actual facet of our religion. Basically, we *should* be reading the Bible (and some of us do!) but alot of us are lazy. The other thing is that if you don't miss Mass for three years, then you will have read the entire Bible in Mass over the course of those three years, albeit out of order. So that's a thing too.\n\nThere's probably alot more they take issue with but those are the ones I've heard the most.",

Basically praying to someone is a form of worship. Also Catholicism is very dogmatic which many Protestants don't agree with since we strive for a more personal relationship. An example of this is for absolution of sin Catholics must go to confession and have the priest absolve them of sin on behalf of God while Protestants would normally just pray for forgiveness.  Having said all this I respect Catholics and am really happy to see that they have been recently really embracing science and humanity (evolution, LGBT rights, etc) as opposed to many Protestants who've been going of the deep end recently",

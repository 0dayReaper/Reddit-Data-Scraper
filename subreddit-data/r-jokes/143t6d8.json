It will put out the cigarette!\" Wanda replies.\n\nBetty reaches in her purse and pulls out a rubber. \"Try one of these.\" she says.\n\nWanda can't believe how miraculous this product is that you can slip down over a cigarette to keep it from getting wet in the rain!\nShe asks her friend, \"Where can I get some of these and what are they called?\"\n\n\"They're called condoms and you can get them at any pharmacy\" Betty replies.\n\nSo Wanda makes her way down to the local drug store. She walks up to the counter and is greeted by the pharmacist.\n\n\" What can I do for you?\" he asks.\n\nWanda says \" I'd like a pack of condoms please.\"\n\nThe pharmacist is taken aback at a woman of Wanda's age requesting such an item.\n\n\" What kind would you like?\" He asks.\n\nWanda replies \"Anything that will fit a camel\"",

I'd never heard them called that before so I went into the store room to see if I could find what he was asking for. After a bit I came out with the a rubber incontinence bed sheet. When I showed it to him he said 'blimey, I'm not that big!'\"",

The girl wants the boy to meet her family and make a good impression, so she tells him if they like him, she'll have sex with him that night. \n\nThe boy is very excited, and goes to the pharmacy to buy condoms. Again, he's never had sex, so he asks the pharmacist, who shows him some options, and tells him they come in three packs, twelve packs, and jumbo value packs. The boy isn't sure what to expect, so he plays it safe and buys the jumbo value pack. \n\nThat evening he goes to his girlfriend's house for dinner, meeting her father, her mother, and her two brothers. They all sit down and before eating they bow their heads in prayer. Everyone finishes the prayer except the boyfriend, who keeps prayer. Five minutes later, he's still praying. Ten minutes later, still praying. After fifteen minutes, the girlfriend nudges him and whispers \"I never knew you were so religious.\" He whispers back \"I never knew your dad was a pharmacist.\"",

I didn't own one and I didn't know much about them, so I went to the local athletic supply store and asked for one. They directed me to a counter where a high-school girl was working. She must have been new on the job because she didn't know much either. I told her I wanted an athletic supporter. She said, \"Oh, yeah, I think we got those\" and she went back in the storeroom to look for them. She found them, and saw that the boxes were marked S, M, and L so she yells out to me: \"What kind ya got? Short, medium, or long?\" I didn't want to tell her so I bought one of each and got the hell out of there.\n\n(That story was told by Bob Lurtsema many years ago.)",

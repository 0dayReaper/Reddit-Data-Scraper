    "postText": "One night a guy goes to get a room in a hotel. \"Hello, I want a single room for the night please.\" \"Fine, sir, here's one of our best rooms. Room 13,\" says the concierge and hands him the key.\n\nThe guy goes upstairs, takes a shower and gets straight into bed. At about 2 0'clock in the morning, two gorgeous naked women come in and slide under the covers. When he realizes what is going on, he starts screwing both of them. He can't believe what's happening. Next morning, still surprised by last night's events, he goes downstairs to settle the bill. \"How was your room sir?\" asks the receptionist. \"Excellent, I will come back again. What do I owe you?\" asks the man. \n\n\"Well. actually, sir, we are doing a promotional offer. Not only do you not have to pay but we give you $10 as a welcome gesture,\" says the receptionist. \"What?\" says the guy, very surprised indeed. \"That's amazing.\" He takes the ten-dollar bill and wanders off, debating whether his buddies will believe him or not. Needless to say, after a few days he's told all his friends and neighbors about room 13 and the amazing night of passion. The next week one of his buddies goes to check out the room. \"Room 13 please.\" \"Certainly, sir, here's your key.\" After he gets in bed, at the same time, 2 o'clock, two girls this time, extremely horny, get in bed and screw his brains out. The next morning, not only does he not have to pay, but he too gets $10. After a month, everyone knows this hotel and especially room 13. Everyone that stays in room 13 gets the same treatment: a good screw and a ten bucks. \n\nAfter a few weeks, the story reaches the President. The President decides to check the story out for himself. He visits the hotel and asks for room 13. He gets the keys and goes upstairs. After a couple of drinks he gets in bed waiting patiently for the naked girls to appear. Indeed at about 2 0'clock in the morning two naked ladies come to bed. They are as horny and wild as all the stories the President has heard. The President gets his pecker out and screws the both of them all night long. This is the night of his life. Next morning he goes to reception and when he asks how much the bill is, the receptionist says, \"Nothing to pay, sir. Actually, we are doing an introductory offer. Here's $50 as a welcome gesture.\" Curious, the President asks the receptionist, \"Well, that's strange. Everyone else who comes here gets $10. Why do I get $50?\" \"Well, sir,\" says the receptionist. \"This is the first time we've filmed a porn movie with a President in it!\"",

All she has is the goat at the end of the hall, he can do the goat for $ 10. \n\nGuy goes to the room at the end of the hall and indeed, there's a goat. The goat is washed and smells nice, with a soft, furry skin. He thinks \"What the hell, why not..?\" and makes passionate love to the goat. \n\nA week later, he feels frisky again and decides to go back. He asks for the goat, but alas, the madam informs him that even the goat isn't available. But she has a peeping theatre available. \n\nHe pays $ 10 and goes to the peeping room, where there are several men in the dark, watching through a see through mirror how a guy is going to town on the ugliest woman he ever laid eyes on. \n\nThe man turns to his neighbour and says: \"man, that chick is ugly!\". The other guy turns around and says \"That's nothing, last week they had someone fucking a goat!\"",

She'll charge them a premium price for two of her \"best girls\" but send them into dark rooms with some blow-up dolls. She figures the men are so drunk and horny that they won't even notice.\n\nEager to get laid the two drunks agree and fork over a fortune. They get lead into dim rooms to find their girls already in bed. After the deed was done they wander out into the street and talk about their experiences.\n\nThe first man says his girl was amazing and she let him do whatever he liked to her without saying a word. The second man says, \"I think mine was a witch.\"\n\n\"A witch? What makes you say that,\" the first man asks.\n\n\"Well, I bit her on the arse and she farted and flew out the window.\"",

Money is not an issue, I'll pay whatever is necessary.\" The madam tells him to go into the first door on the right. He enters the room and sees a hot young naked woman lying on the bed. But after he took off his underwear, the woman suddenly looked at him in horror and said, \"No way I'm doing that, are you trying to kill me?\"\n\nSo the man goes back to the front and tells the madam what happened. \"I understand, I figured you were overexaggerating as most men do. Go to the third door on the left. She should be able to take it.\" He enters the room, and an even hotter woman is waiting for him. He undresses again, but she also starts looking horrified and shouts \"You gotta be fucking kidding me, I'm not gonna take that monster!\"\n\nThe man once again goes back to the front desk and explains what happened. The madam sighs and says, \"Okay, I guess then there's only one more option. Please follow me.\"\n\nThey go to the end of the hall and down into the basement. \"I know it's very dim in here, but you should be able to see enough after a minute or two.\" The man goes inside, and sure enough, he can just barely make out the shape of a naked woman on the bed. He thinks, \"Whatever, I guess this is it, then\" and starts undressing. The woman doesn't say a word. He then makes love her, and she takes all of it without a single noise. He finishes, and suddenly, he sees cum dripping out of her nose and her mouth.\n\nHorrified, he runs back upstairs and tells the front madam what happened. She just sighs, takes her phone, and tells her colleague: \"Jim, come down here, the dead one's full again.\"",

A girl wearing a long robe with a beautiful lingere comes down, and she takes the man into a room.\n\n\n2 minutes later, the lady at the front desk hears yelling coming from the room.

He takes the boy behind the house into the woods and they find an old tree with a hole. His father says, \u201cnow son, later on you take a handful of lard and shove it in that tree and just go to town on it.\u201d So later that week when the boy gets real worked up, he grabs a tub of lard out of the fridge and goes out back to see that tree. He packs it good and full and starts going to town on it. Just before the deed was done, a big sow raccoon grabs a hold of his member and tears him up pretty good. He runs back home screaming and crying, and of course has to bandage himself up. A few months later, the boy gets himself a girlfriend and they get hot and heavy. Once they\u2019re undressed, the boy runs out to the laundry room and grabs a broom from the corner. The girl is a little wary of course, and he slowly starts working the broom handle into her. She\u2019s pretty concerned now and asks him what the hell he\u2019s doing. He doesn\u2019t respond and works the broom handle in a little further. Unsatisfied, he gives the broom a real good hard shove and yells \u201cGROWL YOU SUMBITCH I KNOW YOU\u2019RE IN THERE!\u201d",

It brings him almost to tears.\n\nWith the bj done, he hears another unplaceable sound, like a gentle slurp. The lights come on. The woman sits next to him on the bed. \"So what did you think?\".\n\n\"Amazing!\" He says. \"Pleasurable and emotional at the same time. You really wore me out!\". He grabs the glass of water at the bedside table and takes a swig. The woman puts her hand out to stop him.\n\n\"I wouldn't drink that if I were you\", she says.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I use that to clean my glass eye\".",

She tells him that they are all busy but as soon as one becomes available she will gladly set him up with her. So the man sits down on the couch and there is a bowl of apples in front of him so he picks one up and begins to eat it while he waits. \nA few minutes later the 1st girl comes walking in, she sees him sitting there eating an apple, she screams and runs into the back and the man looks around puzzled wondering what just happened. \n\nHe thinks nothing of it and goes back to eating his apple. A little bit later another woman comes walking in she's him sitting there just the same as the other girl and she does the same thing she screams and runs like hell into the back. Now this has got to guy a little bit worried and confused\n\nFinally a 3rd girl comes walking in she sees him eating the apple, screams and runs like hell to the back with the other girls. Now this is really gotten to him by this point he wants to know what the hell's going on. He walks up to the madam and hes like \"I demand to know what's going on, the last 3 girls that have walked in here have seen me over there eating one of those apples, screams and runs like hell away from me. What is going on?\"\n\nThe madam looks him square in the face and says \"sir those are not apples those are last week's abortions\"",

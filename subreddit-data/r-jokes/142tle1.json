    "postText": "Hillary respected his wish as the years went by and kept her promise. But after several years of marriage, Hillary's curiosity got the best of her. She opened the box and found several hundred dollars in cash, and a couple of empty beer cans.\n\nShe felt guilty, and confessed to Bill that she had opened the shoebox, apologizing profusely. Bill said it was okay, but Hillary asked him, \"what are the beer cans for?\"\n\nBill replies \"Hillary, every time I was unfaithful to you, I drank a beer and promised never to do it again.\" Hillary is taken aback, but not surprised. She thought *well there was Monica, maybe one other woman, I guess that's not too bad. It's all good. He was the president and had some flings here and there.*\n\nShe then asks Bill \"what's all the cash for?\" Bill says \"well, every time the box got full, I took it to the recycling center for the deposit.\"",

She takes him into their bedroom, and emerges from her walk in closet with a small lock box. \n\nShe hands her husband the key, and he opens it.  He is confused to find 2 ears of corn and 20 thousand dollars cash inside  \n\nHe asks,, \"What's with the corn?\"\n\nShe says, \"every time I've been unfaithful, I planted a single ear of corn in the garden\".\n\nHe admits in the early days of their marriage, he concentrated too much on work and maybe didn't give her the attention she needed.  He can live with 2 affairs. \n\n\"And the cash?\"  He asks.  \n\n\"Well, everytime I had a bushel, I sold it!\"\n\nEdit:  this joke I heard when I was a kid has spawned the best thread of comments I've ever seen.",

So that means he grew 638,400 ears of corn.\n\nEach kernel planted can yield an average of [3 ears](https://www.weekand.com/home-garden/article/much-corn-one-corn-plant-produce-18040789.php).  So to grow those 638,400 ears, he needed about 212,800 kernels.\n\nAn ear of corn has an average of [800 kernels](https://www.iowacorn.org/education/faqs#:~:text=How%20many%20kernels%20are%20there,in%20an%20acre%20of%20corn!).

One year I was in New Hampshire for work.  NH has no deposit.  A local grocery chain had coke products on sale, 5 12 packs for $10, or $2 bucks for a 12 pack.  I stocked up big time as we had family reunion coming up.  The kids brought back the cans.  MY final cost for each 12 pack of soda was 80 cents.",

When I lived there in the early 90's it was an issue that the blue box program was costing too much.  Meanwhile they were all full of cans.\n\nAB, BC, SK and NS are the only provinces that handle this themselves.  It is expensive for the government to setup, but once it is done they break even or make a small profit. \n\nI believe SK and BC followed suit pretty quickly after AB started refunding everything.  Not sure about NS.\n\nIt is pretty annoying that they leave the burden with the stores in QC and ON.  I can't stand shoving those cans into the machines in QC.  If you have glass, you have to stand in a second line.  In AB you pour your bag on a counter and an employee counts them for you.  \n\nThe other advantages are, less litter and less begging for change - much easier to just collect cans and bottles for street people.",

They\u2019ve been married 48 years (since 1975).\n\nIf we assume several hundred dollars is $500 (most people use several to mean 3-5), then at $0.05 per deposit that\u2019s 10,000 instances of cheating. \n\nThat would be roughly 200 per year, or 17 per month, or about 4 times per week.\n\nEDIT: another discrepancy I\u2019m seeing is OP uses \u201cseveral\u201d to describe the number of years in their marriage that passed before she opened the box. But they also mention specifically the incident with Monica Lewinsky, so at minimum the box opening could not have happened until November 1995 when the first sexual encounter between Monica and Bill reportedly occurred. That\u2019s after 20 years of marriage, and 20 is a very weird thing to describe as \u201cseveral\u201d.\n\nStill, even assuming the absolute earliest possible time for the box opening to occur, 20 years, you get roughly 9-10 incidents of infidelity per week on average. That might be a lot, but it\u2019s certainly not breaching the realm of mathematical possibility like the original comment.\n\nEDIT2: I\u2019m going to see what happens if we stretch the definitions provided to the absolute extremes that could possibly be justified. Let\u2019s assume the Monica that she refers to is actually a completely different Monica and she\u2019s not talking about the incidents in 1995/1996 at all. And let\u2019s assume when they say \u201cseveral years of marriage\u201d they mean 3 years. Then let\u2019s assume by \u201cseveral hundred dollars\u201d we\u2019ll stretch that to $999 since any more than that and they would\u2019ve said thousands. These assumptions are nearly absurd. That comes out to 19,980 instances of infidelity total, 6,660 per year, or roughly 18 incidents per day. That\u2019s still kind of mind boggling to imagine how a human being has the time to even partake in that many sexual acts per day, but I guess mathematically possible if that\u2019s pretty much all he did with his free time and he had a different mistress on call every 53 minutes of his waking hours for 3 years straight. \n\nAnd it still comes nowhere close to the outlandish figure the original commenter made up.",

Melania agreed and promised to never open the box.\n\nMelania respected his wish as the years went by and kept her promise. But after several years of marriage, Melania's curiosity got the best of her. She opened the box and found several hundred dollars in cash, and a couple of empty beer cans.\n\nShe felt guilty, and confessed to Trump that she had opened the shoebox, apologizing profusely. Trump said it was okay, but Melania asked him, \"what are the beer cans for?\"\n\nTrump replies \"Melania, every time I raped someone, I drank a beer and said I'd never do it again.\" Melania is taken aback, but not surprised. She thought well there was Jean, the Epstein party girls maybe one other porn actress, I guess that's not too bad. He was the president and always a degenerate.\n\nShe then asks Trump \"what's all the cash for?\" Trump says \"well, every time the box got full, I took it to the recycling center for the deposit.\"",

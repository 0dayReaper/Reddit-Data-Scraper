                    "comment": "Nerd time ELI5 style.\nThere is a mathematical problem around what is the most efficient way to pack spheres so that you could wrap them in the smallest piece of paper.  If you imagine that you have a bunch of baseballs, You could put them all in a row and wrap them in like a tube. You could also stack them into a pyramid type shape.  It turns out that the tube shape - which is known as the sausage configuration in the literature- is the best up until a certain number of baseballs.  55 to be exact.  But if you have 56 balls, the pyramid is better.  Then 57 you're back to sausage.  Then in a bit it goes back to pyramid again. And so on.  Basically it goes from being extremely regular to suddenly being unpredictable.  In math when what looks like a stable system suddenly is unstable, we call that a \"catastrophe\".  So this transition from 55 to 56is known as the \"sausage catastrophe.\"\n\nI thought this was a very funny term, and somehow my brain was trying a connection between \"sausage catastrophe\" and the stereotypical view of math nerds as being all guys and how any group where people are talking about sausage catastrophes is probably also a sausage fest... Something like that..",

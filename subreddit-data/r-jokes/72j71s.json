A Lion suddenly jumped infront of him. In order to scare the Lion, the Hunter used the Umbrella like a Gun, and shot the Lion, then it died!\n\nGuy : Nonsense! Someone else must have shot the Lion..\n\nDoctor : Good! You understood the story. Next patient please..",

They were older than the usual couples,  and clearly had thought they had found the love of their life.  \n\nIn the pre-reveal interview the man tearfully told Maury that he had never had an inkling of a doubt about his girlfriend's  faithfulness until she became pregnant and he knew he wasn't the father,  but would love and support her and the baby if the true father wouldn't step up to the plate. \n\nMaury asked the poor man how he was so sure the baby wasn't his,  and he replied that he had had a vasectomy twelve years prior.   At this,  the woman exasperatedly interjected that it wasn't her baby either then because she had had her tubes tied eight years earlier. \n\nReveal time comes and Maury tells the couple they need to be talking to their doctors,  because to an accuracy of 99.97% it was his baby.  \n\nI believe he was the happiest guy I ever saw on baby mama day.

However, that 2% failure rate:\n\n* is mostly due to breakage or slippage (why the joke mentions no breakage)\n* includes failures due to physical degradation (e.g. using a condom that's expired, has been stored improperly, etc.)\n* may be inflated due to studies being based on use reporting -- people will tend to blame failure rather than improper use, and there's not really a way to _check_\n\nIn short, you can increase your _personal_ level of confidence that condoms will prevent pregnancies by buying quality condoms, storing them correctly, and using them properly to reduce chance of breaks and slips.\n",

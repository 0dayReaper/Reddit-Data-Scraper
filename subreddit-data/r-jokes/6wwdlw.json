I can't shake the feeling that although I was less experienced in my youth (by definition), my mind and heart were absolutely in the right place, and no old and cynical mind should have presumed to know better.   I should have trusted myself more.  More experience is not always better if it's the kind of experience that leads to cynical patterns of thought.  Sometimes an innocent mind is much closer to a \"true\" understanding of the world, than one that's struggling with it's inner demons. So youth of today, if you are being excellent to each other, don't let an old fogey tell you otherwise.  ",

Having raised three sons and grown up with foster children in our home, I can tell you that unequivocally, prior to age 6, unless someone is right in their ear taunting them and/or diligently trying to sway their opinion, kids are almost always universally kind and non judgmental. Even kids from abused homes are like that (we fostered a few kids from abusive homes growing up). \n\nChildren do not begin to form biases based on skin color, sexual orientation, etc until they get into their school age and their minds are shaped by their environment. Sure, there may always be an exception, but overwhelmingly, if you take any child, age 5 and under, and place him in a room with another child of another race and sex, they will play together without the slightest hesitation.\n\nI'm not disregarding your point... I do recognize how environment plays a role in the developing mind of children, but I wasn't thinking about older kids, that's my fault for being unclear.",

The laws contained in it were meant to be followed, up until sin was forgiven through God (when he died on the cross). Once that happened, those laws no longer had to be followed - but they do remain in the Bible as a reminder and documentation of how things were before sin was universally forgiven.",

This is important because if Jesus did not fulfill the law, we are still living under it and his sacrifice therefor meant nothing.\n\nAs it is, with his sacrifice, man no longer is under the Old Testament covenant but under the New Testament covenant now. A law of grace took the place of the law of commands and servanthood. That doesn't mean the OT is now worthless, on the contrary, with anything that is in the NT it gives us more background into what remains alive in the law of grace and what stays dead in the law of commands.",

What's relevant about those in China and some other places is that they are either poorly regulated or not regulated at all, leading to greater chance of contamination and cross-contamination which has been implicated in a  number of outbreaks.\n\nThe issue here has much less to do with the types of animals in these markets than with how they're handled.",

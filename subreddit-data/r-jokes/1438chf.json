    "postText": "Two tourists from the Czech republic are visiting New York. At the zoo, one leans forward, trying to get real close to the pythons. He falls down into the enclosure and is quickly swallowed whole.\r  \n\r  \nPanicking, the other guy runs up to a caretaker and cries out for help. The caretaker asks him: \"Which of these pythons ate your friend, the male or the female one?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"That one! That one!\", exclaims the Czech, pointing at the male snake, bloated with its stomach full. The caretaker runs up behind the satiated snake, cuts it open and pulls out ... a feeder pig.\r  \n\r  \n\"Oh no, it must have been the other one\", yells the tourist. So the keeper cuts open the female snake, and sure enough, out comes the tourist.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, the tourist could be revived, and miraculously, both snakes managed to live through the events, but there's still a lesson to be learned here: Never trust someone who tells you the Czech is in the male.",

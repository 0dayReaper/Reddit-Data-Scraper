    "postText": "The fairy says \"I will give you what you most desire if you do someone else's job for a day.\"\n\nThe professor says \"I'll be an elementary school teacher. What can be so hard about teaching a bunch of 6-year-olds how to read?\" so he is teleported into a classroom. After a few minutes, all the kids' screaming gets to his nerves, so he throws all his supplies and gives up.\n\nThe C.E.O says \"I'll be a waiter. All you do is carry food back and forth. This'll be a breeze\" so he is teleported to a restaurant. After about an hour, all the annoying customers drive him insane, so he smashes his plates on the ground and gives up.\n\nThe janitor says \"I'll be an artist\" so he is transported to an art facility. He glues all the classroom supplies and shattered plates to a canvas, then sells it for a billion dollars. The fairy asks the janitor how he was so clever.\n\nThe janitor says \"I got a masters degree in art.\"\n\nEdit: Thank you for the silver, gold, and platinum! ",

Stuff like that. \n\nAnd sometimes open up the space as a gallery, invite some local small bands, put up a barbeque. I have a really hard time interacting with the paintings they are doing there, but they are a cool bunch. ",

He had an drawing pads, pencils, etc in there and would sketch and do rough drafts of his work while collecting money.  It was pretty neat to see the sketches before hand then see a bill board or advertisement with the final product 6 months later.  He would help out the art teacher too occasionally.  My favorite was seeing the sketches for a hot air balloon festival then seeing the final color version on a billboard going down highway 78 in NJ when I was 10.  ",

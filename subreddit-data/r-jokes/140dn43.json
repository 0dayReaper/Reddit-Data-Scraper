But the character from the Bible is considered largely mythological. \n\nAnd I'm not talking about the supernatural parts of the story, as those are of course not subject of scientific discourse at all. There's good reason to doubt for example that Joseph and Mary existed as such. Again, not saying the person/s behind the myth didn't have parents of course. But we know next to nothing about them, nor do we have any actual, trustworthy details on their life. \n\n&gt;But to deny the historical evidence and written eye witness accounts of his existence is not sensible.\n\nThere is no such thing, and every credible historian will tell you this.",

Some of the stories should trace back to real people, but that\u2019s just my opinion. It seems like even religious scholars have a hard time agreeing on these topics so are you under the impression that none of them are interested in the truth?",

I asked specifically about Roman records of Jesus' conversation(s) with Pontius Pilate.\n\nThe crucifixion is generally fixed at somewhere between 30 and 33 CE.\n\nGoing by Wikipedia, Josephus wasn't born until 37, Tacitus until 56, and Pliny the Younger in 61--long after any conversation between Jesus and Pilate.\n\nMara bar Sarapion wrote one letter in (probably) 73 referring to the execution of the \"king of the Jews\"; he may or may not have been referencing Jesus of Nazareth, and there's no reason to believe he would have been privy to Pilate's conversations.\n\nAbgar and Tiberius' correspondence does contain discussions of Christianity. It is certainly likely that Pilate - in his role as governor of Judaea - reported on events to the Emperor--but again, that's as close as we come to a Roman record of a conversation between Pilate and Jesus.",

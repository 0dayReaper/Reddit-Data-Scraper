Local extreme cold is still very much possible, and can even hit regions that wouldn't have experienced it before (not that Iowa is one of them) due to changes in prevailing winds brought about by climate change. Besides, I seem to recall it hitting 100 in Dubuque, which tends to be one of the cooler parts of the state, in May this year.",

It's been deemed \"rapey\" by people who get offended easily because there is a line in there where the girl says \"what's in this drink\". Morons of this time think that the guy was slipping something in the drink. However, in that era, women were expected to be a bit more conservative and not be out getting drunk with men, so really she's pretending she doesn't know/is playing innocent and hard to get -- something that was a common occurrence in that era that can be seen in other forms of media.\n\nThe joke here is that global warming is screwing with the climate, I'm guessing. So that 20 years from now when we don't get cold weather, the song will seem weird to people in that time because it doesn't get cold outside. \n\nI don't agree, because I'm pretty sure climate change is gonna take us to both extremes of weather, hot and col. Unless I also got the joke wrong",

My first experience with the song was the Michael Buble/Idina Menzel version with the two kids and I think the video helped to set the mood for cheeky, innocent fun, given that they have two kids portray the male and female. \n\nHowever, now think about the lyrics of that song in the era they were initially wrriten, back in the 40s. Sex/casual encounters weren't openly common and accepted back then. Norms were different. I don't think the song was ever meant to have any sort of rapey overtone, especially if you get into the history of it and realize the song was performed as a duet by a husband and wife. Honestly, only the writer of the song will know the truth, but I guess I'm more of a person that doesn't automatically assume bad intentions in everything.\n\n",

He went through a break-up, and was annoyed by the paparazzi constantly following him around trying to get pics of him, covering his reaction etc. Apparently he was aware of how much he was thinking of his ex, and was annoyed by the press not leaving him alone, and wrote the song with the press/paparazzi in mind. So it's a stalker song, but not the kind of stalker that most people would relate to, unless they've been in the press spotlight.",

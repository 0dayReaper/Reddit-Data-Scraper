I'm absolutely certain that at parties you're the one getting pissed off when someone says the punchline to your overused jokes because they've heard them 1000 times already. I bet you have a catchphrase huh? Like you're on some kind of fucking sitcom. Are you also they guy who always has to jump in with your stories about how the same thing happened to you last week but it was waaaay funnier because it happened to you and not the other guy?\n\nEdit: Judging from the sheer amount of reposted/crossposted/otger people's content you post up I'm impressed with how fucking likely all the shit talking I did above is likely correct.\n\nAre you also that fucking guy constantly trying to show people shit you saw on Instagram when you're in person because you can't figure out how to interact without a screen and all the grass nearby is making you nervous?",

Or maybe some people have a life and haven't seen every single post here but wanted people to see this funny joke",

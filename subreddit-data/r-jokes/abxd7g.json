    "postText": "So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.\n\nA few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.\n\nThe next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.\n\n*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*\n\nThe door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.\n\n\u201cPardon me, sir,\u201d the mailman says, \u201cbut you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it\u2019s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again\u201d replies the Buddhist monk.\n\n\u201cBut sir,\u201d says mailman, \u201cyou will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that is my intention, dear man,\u201d replies the Buddhist monk.  \u201cYou see, reposting is the best way to get karma.\u201d\n\n",

What would you like to say brother?\".\n\nThe man responds, \"The porridge could do with a little more sugar.\" The head monk nods in acknowledgement and walks away.\n\nAnother 15 years pass and the head monk finds the man in the dormitory and says \"Brother, it has been another 15 years. What is it that you wish to say?\".\n\n\"The bed sheets are a bit thin.\" Replies the man. Again the head monk nods in acknowledgement.\n\nYet another 15 years pass and the head monk sees the man and asks \"15 years have passed. Have you anything to say?\".\n\n\"Well actually I've been thinking about it and I'm leaving the order. It's not really for me.\" says the man.\n\n\"Yes, yes\" sighs the head monk \"I think that's for the best. You've done nothing but fucking complain since you got here.\"",

                    "comment": "Inigo Montoya finally catches up to the the six-fingered man in a monastry in Tibet. He finds him red-robed and shaven-headed sweeping the temple courtyard.\n\n\"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\" he says, drawing the six-fingered sword\n\nThe six-fingered man sighs and lowers his arms \"I am prepared, my son. I have been freed from Earthly desires and acheived inner peace.  I wish for nothing more than to move on to my next incarnation on the wheel of life.  Strike, if that is your wish, I will not resist.\"\n\nInigo's face darkens, he brandishes his sword, steps forward one quick light step, and thrusts the tip towards his unprotected bare chest.  A hair's breadth from flesh the sword stops, quivering slightly in the fresh mountain air.  Slowly Inigo lowers his sword. \"This doesn't feel right.\"\n\n\"Indeed for the sutras tell us 'vengence is settled through non-vengence' you have received enlightenment and---\"\n\n\"No I mean it's very anti-climatic.  I spent 10 years studying fencing, I squeezed rocks for 2 hours a day to make my wrists strong, I spent another 2 hours in skipping and dodging and moving quickly to improve my footwork, 2 hours each day of sprinting as fast I could to make my legs fast and strong and every other waking hour learning the sword.  I'm the first swordsman to be ranked 'wizard' since Bastia and now you're not going to try to defend yourself?  Even running away would be better.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry but I have renounced violence.\"\n\n\"You should have done that before you killed my dad. Can't you unrenounce it? Just for a little bit? I promise it won't take long.\"\n\n\"Well...\"\n\n\"You owe me; you took my father and scarred me for life, i was only 10.  Doesn't your Budda preach making ammends?\"\n\nThe monk exhales heavily \"If it's truly what you want, I'll get my sword.\"\n\nAnd so later in the self-same courtyard, in the temperate Himalayan sunshine, they face each other; the old monk and the 'wizard'.  Inigo attacks, a dazzling display of passion and panache, sliding with ease from one style to another: Agrippa; Bonetti; McBone! The six-fingered sword flashes and dances in his hands like sunlight on a sparkling Himalayan stream while the six-fingered man's sword barely moves, dull and sluggish like the estuarine Ganges, spent by its long journey, turgid with the sewage of a hundred flesh-pots, longing for the final oblivion of the sea.\n\n\"This won't do\" Cries Inigo, putting up his sword, again on the point of running the six-fingered man through. \"I've lived only for this moment ever since you took Domingo from me. Fight properly.\"\n\nThe old monk breathes a deep breath and regains some of his composure, again they duel, this time there is some of the old mastery and speed in the older man's swordplay but it is without passion, lacklustre.  Inigo disarms him in 5 seconds flat.\n\n\"Pick it up\" Inigo says coldly switching the six-fingered sword to his left hand \"I'll waste no more of my talent upon you.\" he sets to again but this time without the magical skill of the wizard. He hacks like a butcher, ugly coarse strokes, the sight of which seem to pain the old master more than the jarring impact as he guards.  \"You murdering, cowardly bastard.\" Inigo sneers \"I needn't have bothered learning fencing for a hack like you, a pickpocket with a homemade shiv would be more of a challenge, you ugly, mutated, freak.\"\n\nThe sudden change takes both of them by surprise, a fire lights the old monks eyes for the first time in the fight as he attacks, stamping forward and taking the young Spaniard completely off guard.  The monk's blade dives towards his heart and he knows he cannot stop it.  The most he can hope for is a wild thrust from out of position that can never reach before he's run through himself, but might just avenge him.  Then just as his sword is about to strike home the six-fingered man turns his blade and instead fends off Inigo's hopeless counterattack before trying to attack again.\n\nWithout thinking once, in a kind of trance, Inigo finishes the fight with 3 simple but masterly moves and transfixes the six-fingered man upon the six-fingered sword his father forged for him with such artistry all those years before.\n\n\"Why did try to fend off first, instead of just thrusting?  You had me cold and I know you were fighting for real then\" says Inigo, dazedly \"not just humouring me\"\n\n\"Well\" says the monk, with his dying breath \"You always get more karma for riposting.\"",

The man awoke.\n\n'What was it, monks?' he cried.\n\n'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -\n\n'You're not a monk,' they sighed.\n\n'But what a sense the sounds evoke!\n\nOh tell me, friends!' he cried.\n\n'Alas, we cannot say,' they spoke -\n\n'You're not a monk,' they sighed.\n\n'I have to know!' the man explained,\n\nAnd so, without remorse -\n\nHe joined the house, and prayed and trained,\n\nTo find the noise's source.\n\nHe took the Test of Absent Bliss -\n\nThe Woes of Anguish Drowned -\n\nHe braved the Gulf of Faith's Abyss -\n\nAnd all to find the sound.\n\nHe stood before the Secret Sect -\n\nThe Path of Rousing Ploys -\n\nHe stepped the steps of Last Respect -\n\nAnd all to find the noise.\n\nHe crossed the Gate of Constant Grief -\n\nThe Voids of Now and Then -\n\nHe walked the Road of Lost Belief -\n\nTo hear it once again.\n\nAnd when he'd pained and strained and bled,\n\nAnd most his life had passed -\n\n'You're ready now,' the others said,\n\n'To see the source at last.'\n\nThey took him where the air was fair,\n\nAnd where, inside a trunk...\n\nI'd love to tell you what was there.\n\nAlas, you're not a monk.\n\n",

He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.\n\nA few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.\n\nThe next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.\n\nDing-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong.\n\nThe door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.\n\n\u201cPardon me, sir,\u201d the mailman says, \u201cbut you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it\u2019s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again\u201d replies the Buddhist monk.\n\n\u201cBut sir,\u201d says mailman, \u201cyou will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that is my intention, dear man,\u201d replies the Buddhist monk. \u201cYou see, reposting is the best way to get karma.\u201d",

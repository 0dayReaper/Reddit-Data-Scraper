    "postText": "When he was gone, a man with severe cough came in for a consultation and was informed that the pharmacist was out to lunch, and the assistant wasn't sure when he was coming back. \n\nThe man begged the assistant for help since he was so miserable, and the assistant had to think quick. \n\nAn hour later, the pharmacist comes back and notices the man standing outside the pharmacy, looking absolutely miserable with his legs crossed tight.  \n\nHe asked his assistant if he knew what was going on, and his assistant answered. \n\n\"Oh, that guy.   He came in asking for meds for his cough, and I told him, you were out to lunch but he insisted I give him something to help him stop coughing.   So I gave him some fast acting laxatives and told him the bathroom is out of service\".\n\n\"You idiot!  Laxatives are not meant to treat coughs.   They are meant to relieve constipation.\"\n\n\"I know,\" replied the assistant.  \"Look at him. He's afraid to cough\".",

    "postText": "A man was driving down the road when a policeman stopped him. The officer looked in the back of the man\u2019s truck and said, \u201cWhy are these penguins in your truck?\u201d\nThe man replied, \u201cThese are my penguins. They belong to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou need to take them to the zoo,\u201d the policeman said.\nThe next day, the officer saw the same guy driving down the road. He pulled him over again. He saw the penguins were still in the truck, but they were wearing sunglasses this time. \u201cI thought I told you to take these penguins to the zoo!\u201d, the officer said.\n\u201cI did,\u201d the man replied. \u201cAnd today I\u2019m taking them to the beach.\"",

Hopefully the DNC won't pull this kind of bullshit on us again and we can get a real progressive with little baggage as our nominee, like Warren or Booker. A much better person has a chance to become our first woman president. We'll have plenty of great, albeit depressing, talk show material for the next four years. And either Alec Baldwin or the guy who did several years ago will give us plenty of Trump impressions.\n\nGotta say, I was an idealist this whole election. I was turned into a cynic overnight.

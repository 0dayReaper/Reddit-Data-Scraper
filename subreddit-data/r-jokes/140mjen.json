I also have medical problems and can't poop!\n\nThe 80 yr old responds to both of them with a smirk: well I can both pee and poop everything single day at 7 am on the clock\n\nThe 60 yr old and 70 yr old both ask: then why are you complaining?\n\nThe 80 yr old laughs and says: the problem is I only wake up at 8 o'clock !",

They leave out the door and split up.\n\nMidnight comes, then one o' clock, and the youngest friend comes back to the hotel, happily singing to himself: \"These french ladies, they're so beautiful!\"\n\nThe clock strikes two, then three, the second friend comes back, singing: \"These french ladies, they're so sweet\"\n\nThe clock strikes four, then five, six, seven...the two friends start worrying about the one still missing and are about to go look for him when he bursts in the hotel, a huge smile on his face, singing: \"These french ladies, they're so resilient!\"",

    "postText": "One day a boy walked in the classroom. The teacher asked him why he was late; he said he was on top of Blueberry Hill. The next boy walked in and the teacher asked him why he was late; he said he was on top of Blueberry Hill. The last boy walked in and the teacher asked him why he was late. He said he was on top of Blueberry Hill. Then a girl walked in and the teacher said, \"Let me guess, you're late beacause you were on top of Blueberry Hill\". Then the girl said, \"I am Blueberry Hill\".",

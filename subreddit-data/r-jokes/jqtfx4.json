They can choose two points of their bodies and for every inch between them they would get 10k.\n\nFirst up was the Army general. He chose to measure between the tips of his middle fingers with his arms spread wide. Second was the Air Force, who chose the top of his head to the soles of his feet. Then came the Marine General.\n\n\"I want you to measure from the tip of my dick to my balls.\"\n\nThe men running the measuring laughed and then asked him, seriously, where he wanted to measure.\n\n\"I am being serious. Now start measuring.\"\n\nThe men tried to dissuade him but he was adamant. Finally, resigned, one of the men takes the measuring tape and goes to take the measurement. When the general removed his pants the man jumped up in alarm.\n\n\"Sir! Where are your balls?!?\"\n\n\"IN VIETNAM!\"",

This is a problem because the only butcher in town won't buy string from him because the butcher happens to be an antisemite. \n\nThis shmuck won't buy from Jews- he'd rather pay double for the string from thre next town over. Eventually, the Jewish string factory owner is so incensed that he  goes to the antisemite and tries to convince that it would be better for the both of them if they did business.\n\nThe antisemite won't hear any of it. He says, \"The only string I'll buy from you, k*$k*, is a tiny strand that would hang from the tip of your nose to the tip of your dick.\"\n\nThe jew stands up, offers his hand, and says, \"you've got yourself a deal.\" After a terse, but final, handshake the jew walks out.\n\nThat evening, as the butcher is closing up shop, a huge dump truck comes backing up to his door. The truck bed starts lifting and two dozen flats of butcher's twine come crashing onto the pavement.\n\nThe butcher comes running around to see what's going on. Sure enough, it's that jew driving the truck.\n\nHe tells,  \"What the f*ck is all this shit?\"\n\nOut the window as the truck drives away he hears:\n\n\"The tip of my penis is in Poland!\"",

            "comment": "A young lieutenant is interviewing for a position to serve on the staff of a high ranking general. On the morning of the interview the generals personal aide briefs all the applicants about the interview process. \n\n\u201cBefore I conclude the brief there is one more point I need to make, and it\u2019s probably THE MOST important part of this entire process. When the General was a young captain he was involved in an accident in Vietnam which severed his left ear. Do not under ANY circumstance mention, refer too, talk about or even look at his ear. Not only will it ensure your application goes in the file shredder, but it will also be suicidal for your career. Good luck\u201d!\n\nOne after the other the young officers go into the generals office for the interview, and one after the other they all come cowering out of the office while the General yells at the top of his lungs \u201cYou dumb son of a bitch. While I was overseas killing America\u2019s enemies you were still swimming around in your daddy\u2019s ballsack. I\u2019ll have your god damn rank for ever mentioning my battle wounds. Kiss your career good bye!\n\nLastly, the young lieutenant shuffles through the door, has a seat and begins his interview. All is gong great until the general asks one fatal question.\n\n\u201cSo lieutenant, notice anything...different...about my appearance\u201d?\n\nWithout skipping a beat the young lieutenant says:\n\n\u201cYes sir, I noticed that you wear contact lenses to correct your vision\u201d.\n\nThe General is impressed by the lieutenants attention to detail and keen ability to use clues from his surroundings to piece together the bigger picture. After about ten straight minutes of praise and talking about how the lieutenant will be the military\u2019s next strategic genius the General asks\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been sitting far from me and this large desk for a while now and there\u2019s no way you\u2019d be able to notice my contacts without the assistance of a powerful pair of binoculars. So tell me, just to satisfy my curiosity, how on earth could you figure something like that out given so few clues\u201d.\n\nTo which the young lieutenant replied:\n\n\u201cWell sir...you\u2019d have one hell of a time wearing glasses with only one ear to hold them up\u201d.",

Finasteride is easily available and you can get a prescription from your doctor. From what I understand it prevents any further hair loss while you are using the drug, but if you stop then all the hair you would have lost will fall out meaning a more dramatic change.",

The past ten years have been really good for molecular-level ailments, it's like thinking cancer will never be cured - it's a complex issue and we've actually got a good handle on some of them like prostate or thyroid cancer whereas we didn't a few decades ago. \n\n",

It's stressful and often  times leaves him without sleep and pushes him to his limits. However, he is happy to work like this, sure the pay might not be on par per hour in terms of a software development job at google or Amazon, but he believes in the mission statement of space x and was well aware of the work ethic culture of the company before he signed on.\n\nIt's a rocket science company. Every employee works the same kind of crazy hours that a NASA employee does. Rocket science requires extreme dedication and sometimes that translates to long hours. I would bet that most employees knew what they signed up for and are OK with the sacrifices they make to change the world. It's not like Elon Musk has a plush life, he sleeps 5-6 hours a day, running two companies and a nonprofit all of which are taking steps to use capitolism as tool to create positive changes that will benefit humanity.\n\nSaid buddy also makes six figures a year with full benefits and is working on  systems that will contribute to the colonization of Mars in 4 years.

Their goal was to make a car that they could sell to a major player for mass production.  They intended that every component of it could be cheaply mass produced and every aspect of it was cost effective for the consumer.\n\nMusk threw in a large portion of the investment and took on 1/5 of the company's value.  He later convinced the two founders to bring on JB Straubel and Ian Wright as investors, essentially sinking their own share of the company to even smaller.\n\nMusk used his power position to setup a board of directors who then fired the two founders and shift the direction of the company to luxury cars.  The two left the company shortly after this and launched a law suit against Musk.\n\nShortly after they left the company Elon Musk started a multi-million dollar campaign to convince the world that he was the founder of the company.  This is very similar to how people refer to him as the founder of PayPal (that was Max Levchin) when in fact Musk was just an investor.",

They wanted to start as a niche car company, focusing on a luxury sports car, the Roadster, and then gradually start working on more accessible cars, starting with what became the Model S, then known as Whitestar. Musk built off of that plan of starting with luxury cars and working down to a mass market car. He sped up the timeline considerably and took ideas further, but he didn't change the company's core plans. He's gotten to the Model 3 long before Eberhard ever thought they would.\n\nUnder Eberhard costs for the Roadster ballooned in an insane way, and every target was missed by a mile. He himself told Musk and others that he thought perhaps he should be replaced as CEO so he could focus on production. So Musk went looking for replacements. Eberhard objected to the way it was done, but it also wasn't exactly a surprise, and even people who like Eberhard a lot agreed ousting him as CEO was a good move and probably one that should have been made sooner.\n\nMusk wasn't just an investor in Paypal. He founded x.com, which along with Confinity became Paypal. He was the largest shareholder and was appointed CEO when the two companies merged.",

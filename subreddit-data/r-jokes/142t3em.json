However...\n\nMost words in Spanish for the female genitalia -- which is presumably what the observers saw -- are in the (grammatical) masculine gender, i.e. co\u00f1o, chocho, etc. So \"se la vi\" sounds a little strange because \"la\" is a feminine pronoun.\n\nJokes in Spanish of this type practically always use \"la\" as a reference to the penis, whose informal names are mostly feminine nouns (polla, picha, etc.).\n\nI would suggest having the person who trips and falls be a Scotsman in a kilt, and the observers be women. Then it works perfectly.",

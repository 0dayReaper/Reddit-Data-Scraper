But I find myself defaulting to LGBTQ or LGBTQ+ just for the sake of brevity most of the time. I hope I'm not making the folks implied by the + feel excluded though.",

Both Biden and Trump can say or do whatever they want and their fans are dumb enough to completely ignore it. \"Nuh uh that's made up!\" \n\nTrump literally (RECORDED) said that you can grab women by the ***** and yet his supporters seemed to have no care whatsoever. He's said even more than that.\n\nAnd if you look at some of the shit Biden has said and done, it's the same way. He says some ridiculous stuff, made PROVEN lies, and no supporter bats an eye, because like with Trump they just can't change their opinion. Be it pride and stubbornness, or stupidity. It doesn't matter.\n\nI think when people downvote anti-Biden stuff, it's, \"oh they must be conservative trumpets\" and immediately bash them. People are just so damn ignorant.",

I insist, it's neither ; \"hermaphrodite\" would mean both.\n\nTo be accurate, ALL foetuses first form as female, then if an active SRY gene is present (usually but not exclusively on the Y sexual chromosome), it will mutate into a male. Thus all males are mutants, per se. Well sometimes, for many reasons, this mutation is incomplete, leading to genetical mixups.\n\nIntersex people identifies as LGBT+ because they're biologically non-binary and many embrace that socially, they're part of a sexual minority (literally), and more than often they are \"transified\" because when genitals don't match the binary scheme, most countries will force surgeries onto them to make them have a medically acceptable penis/vulva. Which can lead to a mismatch between genitalias and gender.\n\nA stands for Asexual/Aromantic/Agender. All A's stand for the Absence of something. Asexual is the absence of sexual attraction, Aromantic the absence of emotional attraction, and Agender is the lack of gender identity. Asexuals especially (as we're talking about sexuality) ARE LGBT+ as they factually aren't heterosexual.",

I can't give you cyanide to kill your husband! That's against the law! I'll lose my license! They'll throw both of us in jail! All kinds of bad things will happen. Absolutely not! You CANNOT have any cyanide!\"  \n\n\n  \nThe lady reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of her husband in bed with the pharmacist's wife.  \n\n\n  \nThe pharmacist looked at the picture and replied: \"Oh Well now That's different. You didn't tell me you had a prescription.\"",

It's the bit about proportional expansion.\n\nI don't think without some experimentation we can assume the pharmacist's penis will expand proportionally. Taken at his word, one pill would presumably not make his penis long enough to clear the counter, whereas two or three might do the trick. \n\nAll we can really be sure of here is that more pills lead to more length, at least to a point. Unless the pharmacist is just making things up, which seems likely because I'm pretty sure that's not how Viagra works.",

The only way I can get any relief is to masturbate about once every two hours.  Without that, my penis is nearly constantly erect.  What can you give me for it?\"\nThe sisters excused themselves and went into the back where the meds were kept.

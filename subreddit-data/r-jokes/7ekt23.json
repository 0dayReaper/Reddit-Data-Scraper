It means they'll never have to worry about competition ever again since people would have very limited use of these but that's because Youtube is inherently an web service, what about Uber and Amazon?  \nI almost never use cabs to the point I've never yet had a chance to try Uber. So I'll never subscribe to the Uber plan, which means people like me will simply ignore Uber, nice try Uber, you're now the only competitor online but you're losing prospects to old-fashioned taxi companies. Same with Amazon, do I really want to pay a subscription to be able to order things online? What about going to the mall where they have 70% of what I buy on Amazon? Hell, some people I know barely see the point in Amazon as it is already, and only order once or twice a year to send presents to relatives who live too far to visit for Christmas, you're now losing 100% of them.   \nSo the way I see it, services that aren't 100% web-based should worry about this more than us.

No big website would allow ISPs to cut off their customers by putting their site behind a paywall.\n\nNetflix and other big sites got tired of paying ISPs extra for their additional bandwidth. As a result, they spent millions to lobby the government to prevent ISPs from being able to reject huge amount of bandwidth. After they won, big websites can now send as much data as they want for cheap! Literally hundreds of millions saved.\n\nYou can see the effect net neutrality have on Netflix's stock prices since 2014 when net neutrality was implemented. They saved a lot of money on internet, and now can have money to make original TV shows to stay ahead of the competition: https://imgur.com/EOycKzC\n\nNet neutrality is a lot like plane luggage neutrality. Imagine if airplane companies cannot reject any luggage, cannot charge extra for oversized luggage, and cannot inspect inside the luggage (as ISPs cannot inspect data packets under net neutrality). The big companies that being in 5 ton luggage will benefit, while the people who being small luggage will get their services slowed because of the struggle the airplane company have to do to process all the oversized luggage of the corporate giants.",

Trader pilots would often see how close they could get to the black holes in order to shorten their route to the smallest amount of distance actually traversed.  Because of its incredible speed, the Millenium Falcon was able to get closer than most to the black hole without being pulled into the gravity well.  The distance he was able to travel was less than 12 parsecs.  So what Han Solo told you was true, from a certain point of view.",

I went to a strip club in Seattle, and the first thing I notice is that the girls don't actually get naked, they just get topless, and keep their G-string on. Ok that's weird, but whatever, that means I can stick 1 dollar bills in there like the movies. Then the waitress comes and asks what I want to drink. I tell her I'll have a Heineken. She laughs at me and tells me you can't drink alcohol in strip clubs. CAN'T DRINK IN STRIP CLUBS! What is the point of going to a strip club then? It made the whole thing seem way more creepy and sad, thinking of these sober guys hanging out there all day. ",

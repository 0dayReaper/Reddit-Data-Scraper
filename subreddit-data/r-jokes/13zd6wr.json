    "postText": "After a few seconds of waiting my turn, I realized that nothing was happening. He was just standing there, looking down. \n\n\"Umm, everything alright?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Yeah, just got a slight problem here.\" he said, nodding towards his zipper. \n\nI guess it's the humanitarian in me that made me speak up. \"Can I give you a hand?\" I reluctantly asked.\n\n\"I'd appreciate it.\"\n\nSo I unzipped him, and pulled him out. Once I did, I was immediately repulsed. His business was covered in an oozing rash. I kept my poker face while I aimed him at the urinal. Afterwards I put his business back behind the curtain and zipped him up. \n\n\"Thanks man.\" he said. \n\nI immediately went to the sink to wash up. But I had to know what was up with his manhood. \n\n\"Not that it's my business, but what's up with your junk, bro?\"\n\nHe pulled his hidden arms out of his jacket, and headed for the door. \n\n\"Yeah, I sure don't know, but I didn't want to touch it!\"",

    "postText": "A man went to a tailor's shop to be fitted for a suit and a pair of shoes. The old tailor took all of the measurements and said to return in a week. \n\nThe man returned in a week and put on his new suit and new shoes.\n\nAs he stood in front of the mirror he complained that the left sleeve was longer than the right sleeve. The tailor told him to just hold his right shoulder down a little and it would even it out. So the man did this.\n\nBut then the man said that the right pant leg was longer than the left leg. The tailor told the man to use his right arm to scoot the pants up on that side and hold it there and it would even it out. So the man did that.\n\nAnd then the man said that the left shoe was rubbing his heel when he took a step. The tailor said just take a shorter step with your left foot and it won't slip up and down. So the man did this.\n\nThe man started down the street in his new suit and shoes. He held his right shoulder down, and used his right arm to scoot the pants up on that side, and he took a shorter step with his left foot.\n\nHe passed by a couple of men sitting on a bench. One of these men said \u201cWould you just look at that poor crippled man.\u201d To which the other man replied \u201cYes, but isn't that a nice suit!\u201d",

    "postText": "A cowboy is hitching his horse in front of the saloon when a man storms out with a pistol. The cowboy walks into the bar, past a barfly with a half-empty drink, orders a beer and asks the barfly\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the guy who just stormed out looking for trouble?\u201d\n\nThe barfly responds \u201cOh him? That\u2019s Jake the Killer, he\u2019s the meanest gun in the west with a bounty of a hundred dollars on him. I\u2019m the lawman sent to deliver the bounty to whoever shoots him down.\u201d\n\nThe cowboy says \u201cA hundred dollars! Hold my beer!\u201d And runs out the door. The cowboy shoots Jake dead and comes back into the bar to collect his pay. The Barfly is waiting for him and drinking the cowboy\u2019s beer.\n\nThe cowboy says \u201cI shot him down, give me the hundred dollars and my beer.\u201d\n\nThe barfly responds \u201cSir I don\u2019t know who you are or what your talking about, but this is my beer. If you have a problem with that we can take it outside after I finish my drink.\u201d\n\nThe cowboy storms out of the bar with his pistol in his hands and a mean look in his eyes.\n\nJust then another cowboy walks into the saloon, orders a beer, and asks the barfly who that dangerous looking man is.\n\nThe barfly sets down his half empty mug of beer and says, \u201cOh him? That\u2019s Jake the Killer.\u201d",

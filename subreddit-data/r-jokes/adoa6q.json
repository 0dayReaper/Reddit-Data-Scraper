Too true, some of the operators forget that the batteries in the electric lift trucks ARE the counterweight opposing the load their lifting and there isn't much seperating them from the battery itself if that thing rolls over.\n\nPretty unique job, I must say. Not very often that you meet someone who fixes gasoline, diesel, propane and electric units at one place.\n\nCheers ",

When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.\n\nObviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said \"I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the guy. \"He choked on a sock.\"",

She seemed to be into me so I thought hey maybe I\u2019ll ask if she wants to go to a rave with me. She politely declines but seemed flattered. So in an attempt to persuade her to go I try to show her this video of a really colorful and flashy rave I went to. I pull up the video and go to show her and she knocks the phone out of my hand. I\u2019m shocked and look up and she\u2019s covering her eyes. She then tells me sorry I have epilepsy I didn\u2019t want to tell you. Oh boy did I feel bad. I wanted to hug her but I didn\u2019t want to fuck up the situation even more as she tried to calm her mind. \n\nAlmost gave my crush a seizure in class in front of hundreds of people. ",

He got real stern and asked, \"have I ever told you how my son died?\" Turns out he accidentally blew his brains out around Christmas a few years prior.

Obviously everybody took this very seriously. The school brought in grief counsellors, and all we did in the rest of our classes for the day was discuss suicide and how it affects people.\n\nAt lunch, the halls were eerily quiet, and everybody just sat around talking in hushed tones. A student\u2019s older sister stopped by to drop something off and as soon as she got into the hall, she just looked around and said:\n\n\u201cJesus, did somebody *die* or something?\u201d\n\nWhen she found out what had happened she was suitably horrified, but it actually did a lot to break the tension in the school, because everybody busted her balls until she left.",

I come into work one morning and my co-worker says, \u201cHey did you hear about Noah?\u201d He had the same dark sense of humor as me, so I say, \u201cOh no what...did he die or something?\u201d He says, \u201cUhh yeah...actually he did.\u201d \ud83d\ude33\n\nYears later, I made that same dumb joke when a different friend asked me a similar question about someone else. I respond- \u201coh what, did he die or something\u201d and he said yes also! Wtf, apparently whenever I make that joke the answer will always be yes",

Apparently she wasn't fond of his grandma in the slightest and also appreciated the interuption from me. So I felt a lot less terrible after she told me that.",

They're always hanging around my cubicle, making noise, joking around; they're kind of immature but I suppose they're nice enough most of the time, but they sometimes annoy me when I'm working on a project, on the phone or just trying to concentrate.\n\nAnyway, one day they're hanging out and giggling like school girls and laughing about something.  I'm not paying attention 100%, but I do hear them make some reference to sending someone to a concentration camp.  Maybe they're making fun of me because I'm trying to concentrate, I don't know, so I figured there was no time like the present to make my case.\n\nSo I stand up and STERNLY told them that making jokes about concentration camps was not an appropriate subject for the office.  That not only was it an sensitive topic for so many people, but it was also highly unprofessional, and that furthermore, for their information my grandfather had died in an internment camp during WWII.\n\nThey grew solemn, white-white faced even, and all had an expression of shock on their faces as though they had been suddenly schooled.  They quietly, one by one, began apologizing to me.\n\n\"That's okay I guess\", I finally told them, \"I suppose he really wouldn't have died if he didn't get drunk and fall out of the guard tower.\"",

I've seen others let people know they didn't come up with the joke so it's not hard.

Well,  during the drive up there I had crafted what i thought to be the most awesome joke, and clearly now was the time to use it.\n \nThe joke was a pun based on a girl in the area that had gone missing. During the entire school year it was well publicized and talked about- I thought... I genuinely thought this joke would make everyone closer,  considering we all lived in diffrent areas of the state, chances were they would all know about this missing girl.\n\nTold the joke. Turns out a veteran of the camp was related to the girl- cousins I think..- anyway she got really upset- a bunch of people- many who didn't hear the joke- came to her defense when she started screaming.  \n\nI apologized..tried slipping away as now I had a bunch of people freaking out at me- tried running back to my cabin..well, they chased me, some of which were throwing rocks- one grazed the right side of my skull..ambulance came- wrapped my entire head in gauze for the bleeding- only needed 5 stiches- but, obviously never went back to the camp. \n\nOver 20 years now, and still don't tell jokes or say much, until a basic acquenticeship has been formed/know things about the person. \n\nTldr, told a shit joke, took a rock to the head. \n \n\n",

There was a pause then a friend of mine leans in and says \"dude he's a fucking cancer survivor, you asshole!\" To which I replied with a big \"congratulations!\".\n\n2) we just hired a new bartender/waitress  at the local pub. We were all waiting for tips and started telling jokes. They started off innocent but got darker. Someone told a 9/11 joke so I followed up with \"what did the Boston bomber accomplish that Hitler couldn't?\". Boy did I miss those death stares because I said \"finish a race\" followed by \"I'm Jewish...\". Yea I told a joke about Hitler, and his quest to exterminate the Jewish, and found out the new girl was Jewish back to back. \n\nTalk about the wrong jokes at the wrong time..",

Go look up a translation, or if you don't trust that look up the original Hebrew and look up the translation of individual words, or if you don't trust *that* then just look at other places where the same words are used.\n\n&gt; it was Roman tradition to Mentor little kids\n\nScholars generally date Leviticus to ~540-330 BCE. In 540 BCE, Rome was just a single city, and in 330 BCE, the Roman Republic was only within modern-day Italy, it hadn't yet expanded to the Middle East area. Judea was under control of the Persian Empire at the time. Most people there probably had never even heard of Rome",

It actually causes more issues than it fixes.\n\nThe idea that it means pedophilia is based off of an official translation of the Bible into German. There's no way the people who had been using the Latin and English concepts for homosexuality would have just let that one go. It's because there wasn't really a term for it at the time, so they used a word that is more akin to pedophilia.\n\nNot only that, but it's not like homosexuality was condemned in the Bible once. It's specifically mentioned at least 3 times (more depending on your interpretation). And only 2 of those blatant times are in the Old Testament. \n\nNow, the ancient Jews weren't concerned with your orientation, as much as the act of literal penetration. That's why there's no verse regarding women laying with women.\n\nBut if you want to spin it to mean laying with young boys specifically, it apparently leaves the door open for young girls. Which is not only a huge problem, it also begs the question of why little boys specifically?\n\nWouldn't God just say young children? Why not condemn it all. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that trying to wriggle out of the Bible's (very real) hatred for homosexuality just ends up showing an even more sexist side of it.\n\nYou'd think an all knowing/powerful/loving God would have made things a bit clearer in all the translations. My advice is to stop trying to defend it and walk away.",

However, I think it's a bit of a willful misrepresentation.\n\n\\-Firstly, he seems to refer mostly to Paul's usage of \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd, not Leviticus 20:13. I know a bit of Greek, but not enough to know if the addition of \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 to the word when Paul uses it substantially changes the meaning.\n\n\\-Ed Oxford states that Luther would have used the Latin equivalent of this word, which he states is 'paedico' (based off on an old lexicon). However, the Vulgate (a Latin bible which was the standard text in the Catholic Church for some time) translates it as 'masculo', or male.\n\n\\-Martin Luther's translation of the bible postdates the Wycliffe bible, which translates \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd as man (although it used the Vulgate as its only source) http://oldebible.com/wycliffe-bible/leviticus-20.asp.\n\n\\-I'm not super educated on Martin Luther, but I'm fairly certain he referred to the Masoretic Text for his Old Testament translation. The Masoretic Text, to my knowledge, actually post-dates the Septuagint by several hundred years in the formulation which Luther would have used (I'm too ignorant to argue about whether that text accurately reflects the Hebrew which the Septuagint would have been based on). It would significantly change my opinion if someone better educated than I could provide evidence that the Masoretic text is 100% faithful to the Hebrew which the Septuagint is based upon, or the Septuagint mistranslated its source material.\n\n\\-Regardless, it seems an adherent to the non-Protestant churches would accept this word to mean man, as their scriptural tradition is based of the Greek (Orthodox) or Greek-&gt;Latin (Roman Catholic) translations. The non-Chalcedonian churches may have a different translation/rendition of the text, but I'm too uneducated on their traditions to comment.\n\nI won't touch on the fact that Ed Oxford is gay as well, which I imagine would influence him to come to a conclusion that lines up with his thinking. Again, this is just what it appears to me that the text says. I firmly believe that sexual orientation is irrelevant in measuring the worth of a person, and being a Christian and same-sex attracted are two reconcilable ideas. Sorry for the word vomit!",

There is not a single other way to interpret that from the Bible.\n\nBut because of cases of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practicing self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion. To the married I give this command\u2014not I but the Lord\u2014that the wife should not separate from her husband (but if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.\r\n1 Corinthians 7:2\u202d-\u202c11 NRSV\n\nAlso, this is about homosexuality,\n\nYou shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. You shall not have sexual relations with any animal and defile yourself with it, nor shall any woman give herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it: it is perversion.\r\nLeviticus 18:22\u202d-\u202c23 NRSV\n\nSo no.",

Since they hold that marriage is between only one man and one woman, all sexual acts which occur outside of such an arrangement are disordered. They believe marriage is an unbreakable bond (in theory at least- it seems annulment is more common than it probably should be) and children should be raised in that arrangement. So that arrangement would be against tradition since there is a polygamous aspect to it. If each man and woman were paired up individually, then it would be satisfactory (but then it would be expected each couple is faithful to one another). Additionally, If we're assuming Leviticus 20:13 to condemn homosexual activity regardless of context, they'd still be in violation of it if they were having homosexual relations in addition to procreative ones. It seems like the prevalent view is same-sex-only attracted individuals are called to chastity, just as any single person would be. I'd assume, but don't quote me, that bisexual persons are expected to only act on their heterosexual desires, and (again) only within the context of marriage.\n\nWhile their logic seems consistent to me, it does make me sad that homosexual people would never be able to experience romantic love. However, I have to admit that if a homosexual person does remain chaste and devoted to God, they would have to be considered more holy than I (or any person who has committed sexual sin) could ever be. I think society could do with a lot more people (regardless of sexual orientation) devoted to loving God and reflecting his love for humanity in their conduct rather than loving the world and its temporary pleasures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - It's the act itself, not the impulse to do the act or doing it in addition to fulfilling the conditions of procreation, that the Catholic Church interprets the bible to prohibit.",

Old Testament is Jewish scripture from about 2500 years ago, telling the story of the creation of the world and of ancient Israelites, their kings and prophets. Then the New Testament is a sequel written in Greek about 2000-ish years ago; it picks up from the OT; basically the NT is the story of the life and deeds of the Chosen One (Messiah) being foretold in the OT.\n\nObviously, multiple writers wrote both. Over several hundred years in the case of OT. Jesus, well, depending on whether you think was w literal historical figure or not:\n\n - didn't write anything because didn't exist, it's a literary character\n\n - didn't write anything because was a historical character (a religious leader) who didn't have the means to go and write a book\n\n - didn't write anything because he's an aspect/avatar of the God itself, so didn't need to write anything, it was his will that people would write the book so people wrote the book (this is more or less what Christians believe)",

Exactly how many people were involved depends upon who you ask, it's almost certainly not as many authors as Christians would like to believe but not one or even just a few, either. \n\nNo book of the bible is claimed to be written by Jesus. The Gospels are claimed to have been written by his closest disciples Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In reality the earliest copies were anonymous and those claims were added in the second century A.D.  \n\nAt no point does Jesus himself say anything about homosexuality in any of those accounts. At least one of his disciples (Paul) later does, and the older Jewish books of the bible include a few passages that seem like refrains against homosexuality as well. Christians argue endlessly over what it meant when Jesus said that he \"fulfilled\" the old laws but that people should still follow their spirit.",

And I think revelations was essentially a fever dream of predictions about an apocalypse.\n\nBasically, after multiple translations, misinterpretations and convenient \"filling in the gaps\", along with conjecture, the ability for rumour mills to exaggerate facts, and the fact that protestantism said \"hey, all of this is open to interpretation, go nuts\" means that the current bible is the OG book of celebrity stories and fantastical retellings of significant historical events in middle-eastern europe and northern Africa.\n\nAll this means that: we probably shouldn't be looking at the garbled translations of people alive thousands of years ago to decide how we treat each other today. Makes no sense.\n\nSome readers may find the above offensive. To which I say: sorry.",

Any translation is a negotiation with the text\n\nPerhaps I was a bit cavalier with what I said. What I really meant was that the literal meaning of the words in this particular verse are for the most part well understood. I often find people on Reddit arguing that it's impossible to know what the verse means because nobody speaks the language anymore, so I was arguing against that. Any ambiguity in this verse would probably also have been present for a native Ancient Hebrew speaker, so I think of it more as an issue of *interpretation* of what the verse is trying to say in context, rather than of *translation* of the individual words. But you're right that really any translation must also include interpretation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Any translation is a negotiation with the text, and the sense of prohibiting homosexuality is GLARINGLY modern.\n\nTechnically you're correct, the verse does not saying anything about just *being* homosexual. It's an important distinction to make. I think anyone that's actually read the verse would already agree that the simple meaning of the text does not prohibit a man to exist while being sexually attracted to other men.\n\nHowever, the interpretation that it prohibits some or all forms of homosexual intercourse is not modern in the slightest, being found in the Talmud for example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; I suggest you read K. Renato Lings, \u201cThe \u2018Lyings\u2019 of a Woman: Male-Male Incest in Leviticus 18:22?\u201d Theology and Sexuality 15, 2 (May 2009), 236\n\nA very interesting read. Not sure if we're allowed to link Sci-hub here, but the DOI number for the paper is `10.1558/tse.v15i2.231` so people can look it up themselves. \n\nEssentially, the part of the author's argument that disagrees with the common interpretation is that the verse refers only to incestuous relationships. The author bases this on the fact that the majority of the chapter deals with incest (verses 6-17 or 18), and also on the fact that the term *mishk'vei* (\"the lyings of\") is in plural (which could be taken to mean that it refers to any of the forbidden \"lyings\" in the preceding verses). \n\nI find the point about the rest of the chapter dealing with incest to not be particularly compelling. The structure of the chapter is clearly not talking about just incest, but rather certain practices from Egypt and Canaan that the Israelites should not do. This is reiterated twice, at the beginning and end of the chapter. This is clearly shown by the fact that there are several other non-incest prohibitions in the chapter. The structure is as follows:\n\n* 1-5: Introduction about how the other nations defile themselves and the Israelites shouldn't\n* 6-17: Prohibitions that are clearly talking about incest\n* 18: Prohibition of marrying two sisters at the same time (you could consider this to kind of be a type of incest)\n* 19: Prohibition of a woman during her *nida* (menstrual period)\n* 20: Prohibition of adultery\n* 21: Prohibition of offering up offspring to *molech*\n* 22: Verse we are dealing with\n* 23: Prohibition of bestiality \n* 24-30: Conclusion about how the other nations defile themselves and the Israelites shouldn't\n\nAs you can see, there are 3 or 4 non-incest prohibitions immediately before the verse we are discussing, and one immediately after it. To say that this verse refers to incest specifically, while the preceeding 3 verses do not, \n\nThe fact that *mishk'vei isha* is plural is also interesting, but in my opinion not enough to militate this interpretation. There are several other possible interpretations which are closer to the literal meaning of the text. The most simple explanation is just that this is the grammatical form used to refer to intercourse in this grammatical context (for example, we could contrast to how *mishkav zachar* is used grammatically in Numbers, where it refers to a past act of intercourse, whereas here it refers to any potential future act of intercourse). We don't have enough instances of *mishk'vei* to make a firm judgement about which grammatical form is correct in this context, and indeed Genesis 49:4 also uses the plural to refer to seemingly a single instance of intercourse. There are also plenty of other interpretations; I believe the Talmud has some interpretation about how it's in the plural to refer to several different types of sexual acts which are prohibited, but I don't remember off the top of my head.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile I disagree with the author's interpretation, it's not like I'm trying to say that it's not a valid interpretation or anything; many people have interpreted the Bible in many ways. I just don't personally find this interpretation particularly convincing; I think it's a bit of a stretch. To try and argue that this is the correct interpretation and everyone else is interpreting the verse incorrectly seems very difficult. Certainly, it is much more \"glaringly modern\" than the interpretation that the verse prohibits forms of homosexual intercourse (which dates back to at least the *Talmud Yerushalmi*, 350-400 CE).",

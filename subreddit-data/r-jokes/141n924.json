    "postText": "A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.\n\n  \nI decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.  \n\n\n  \nHere's the joke I told:\n\n  \n\"What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?  \n\n\n  \nThrow your washing (laundry if you're American) in.\"  \n\n\n  \nOne of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.\n\n  \nObviously, I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said \"I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?\"  \n\n\n  \n\"No,\" replied the guy. \"He choked on a sock.\"",

Everyone was telling \u201cjokes\u201d about the holocaust (again we were kids), and when the dad came to serve us he sais \u201cyour humour is really nauseous!\u201d, we became all red and shut our mouths, \u201ci lost my grandfather in a camp!\u201d, at this point we were livid. He then pulled his best troll face and said \u201che fell from a guardtower\u201d. We didn\u2019t even crack a laugh, we were shocked and realized what just happened, and since then i never ever made another joke like this",

Generally dark humor to kinda add some levity to our condition. \n\nSome people don't like the jokes but also don't care enough to say so. \n\nLastly others will go NUCLEAR over jokes at a diabetics expense, dark or otherwise. \n\nI shared a clip from YT someone made where they chopped up a Wilford Brimley diabetes PSA so Wilford says \"I don't care about diabetics, eat apple pie and die\". \n\nMe and others thought it was funny as fuck but we got hit by a pair of the \"nothing about diabetes is funny people.\"",

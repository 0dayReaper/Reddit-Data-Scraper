    "postText": "The bartender asks, \"Would you like anything to drink?\"\n\nThe panda replies, \"No thanks, I'm only here to eat.\"\n\n\"So what would you like to eat?\"\n\n\"I'll just take the fries.\"\n\nThe bartender serves the panda, who enjoys the meal. He asks, \"Now, will your payment be cash or card?\"\n\nThe panda calmly replies, \"Oh, just card.\"\n\nAfter paying, the panda gets up and takes out a pistol. He fires a few shots in the direction of a few men, killing some in the process.\n\nThe bartender, horrified, shouts, \"What the hell was that for? You just killed 4 men!\"\n\nThe panda says, \"I'm a panda, man. Look it up.\" The panda then abruptly exits the bar.\n\nThe bartender confused, looks up \"Panda\" on Google. The description said:\n\n\"The giant panda is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. Eats shoots and leaves.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredits to \"Eats, Shoots, &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\" by Lynne Truss",

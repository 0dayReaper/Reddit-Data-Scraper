And e're talking obscene prices that *no* app creator could ever afford.\n\nThey are doing this because \"unofficial\" apps and most browsers allow for ad-blocking.  And if Reddit ads can be easily blocked, advertisers pay less for them.  Apparently, Reddit has been running at a deficit for a long time, in part because of this issue.\n\nThe obvious answer would be to fix the official app.  Most people don't use the unofficial ones for adblocking, but because the official app sucks, like, really, really badly.  It's incredibly difficult to use and crashes on a regular basis.  The adblocking is just a bonus.\n\nBut instead of enticing us to use the official app and see the ads by improving it, they're just making it way to expensive for any *other* app to run.  it's a dick move, so we're mad about it.\n\nThere are a lot more detailed answers elsewhere in the comments, if you need more info.",

For instance, Netflix can only be viewed from their app or their website, no third party access. This is common for most tech companies. I'm really not sure why people think this is a huge deal and are going to completely abandon the platform because a company wants you to use their application. Of course they do. Yes I understand they are overcharging and putting these third party apps out of business but that's how you kill competition. These are smart strategies by this business to stop the use of third party apps. It's literally their goal. They very easily could have killed it off completely but that would have eliminated revenue. Everyone's looking at this from an end user perspective when you should be looking at it from a business perspective. If you were a business who's users were using another business instead of yours wouldn't you take action to bring them back to your platform? Unfortunately this is backfiring for Reddit because this is seen as greedy. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

My assumption is that they set a ridiculous price as a starting negotiation. That, or they're so financially insolvent that they can't afford to sell API access for less. Dunno. \n\nThe advertiser supported model of the web is dying anyway. It'll all be pay-to-play soon enough.",

    "postText": "A king who had been very busy conquering lands and staying out of his castle, returned home after a couple of years on the battlefield. \n\nHe received news that his wife or the queen had been cheating on him with the generals and several other higher-ups. In order to find out who was involved in these affairs, he ordered one of his men to place blades in his wife\u2019s vagina. \n\nHe then left the kingdom to conquer more lands. After he returned from his recent conquest, he ordered all the higher-ups and his cabinet members to assemble together in one room. Everyone was then ordered to take off their pants. \n\nThe generals took off their pants and their dicks were cut and wounded. The merchants took off their pants and their dicks were also cut and wounded. The senators took off their pants and their dicks were also cut and wounded. \nFinally, the head cleric took off his pants but his dick was intact and without a scratch. \n\n\u201cLook at this man. This man is a true nobel. A man with integrity and honor. unlike the rest of you lot. Am I not speaking the truth?\u201d said the king as he pointed his index finger at the cleric. \n\nThe cleric replied with a cut tongue, \u201cflagabugabauba\u201d",

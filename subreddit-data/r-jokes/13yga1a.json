It was assumed that Guido would hear nothing so he would not have to testify in court.\n\nWhen the Godfather goes to confront Guido about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language.\nThe Godfather tells the lawyer, \"Ask him where's the money? The lawyer, using sign language, asks Guido, \"where's the money?\"     Guido signs back, \"I don't know what you are talking about.\"   The lawyer tells the Godfather, \"He says he doesn't know what you are talking about\"   \n\nThe Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Guido's temple and says, \"Ask him again!\"   The lawyer signs to Guido, \"He'll kill you if you don't tell him.\"   Guido signs back, \"OK.! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin Bruno's house.\"   The Godfather asks the lawyer, \"What did he say?\" The lawyer replies, \" He says you don't have the \"coglioni\" to pull the trigger.\"",

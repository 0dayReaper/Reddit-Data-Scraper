So, whenever the rate of change in demand for gold differs significantly from the rate of change in the supply of gold, prices become unstable. \n\nBitcoin is similarly difficult to create and destroy. When the rate of bitcoin discovery well outpaced demand, prices were depressed and stable relative to national currencies. Now that demand is large and changing quickly, and bitcoin has become relatively hard to discover--prices are driven by demand, which is massive and volatile. So, price is massive and volatile. \n\nThis is precisely why Bitcoin will never be an official currency. Its rules ignore far too many invariants of how human society, power, and value work to be a good choice of national currency. Just like gold.\n\nIt's great for speculation, though--if you know how shorting and risk management work. ",

It causes hoarding and wild price volatility - which in turn prevents it from being used in retail, probably forever.  \n\nOther coins, on the other hand, have this issue more-or-less fixed with ~1% inflation per year.",

Everyone knows that the music is going to stop and there's going to be a mad rush for those chairs but nobody knows when it'll happen. The music has stopped and started playing again a few times before but, so far, more people decide to play the game. Everyone is still having a great time but most bitcoin investors also know that, eventually, the music is going to stop, the last mad rush for chairs will happen, people are going to get tired of playing the game, and almost everyone will leave the party while a few people are going to be left with chairs to put away and a massive mess to clean up.\n\nSo, do you want to risk being one of the people left with a mess to clean up?",

                                    "comment": "You will get incredible biased information. Some people only have superficial knowledge who just understand the basic idea of cryptocurrency. Other people are already invested in a cryptocurrency.\n\nIn my opinion you will see cryptocurrency playing a bigger role in our society but I don't think bitcoin is going to be *the* cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and made the idea of cryptocurrency popular however it is in my opinion not suitable for real world transaction.  \n\n[Steam recently dropped support for Bitcoin](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613). The reason behind it is Bitcoin has gotten too volatile (a currency shouldn't be volatile) but the bigger hindrance is transaction fees. E.g. if you want to send money from one bitcoin wallet to another bitcoin wallet you had to pay as high as $20. The amount which you were sending doesn't matter. This already makes bitcoin not viable for $1 purchases since you have to pay an additional $20.  \nFurthermore in order to verify your transaction went through you need to wait up to 20 hours. And during those 20 hours the value of the bitcoin has changed.      \nSo if Bitcoin is not suitable for using it as a currency what is its purpose then? People see it as an investment. But what exactly are they investing in? Sure the basic idea of an investment is to make money. But an investment is always backed up by a company that utilize the money and innovate/build/???.\n\nThere are other cryptocurrency which work on the same principle as bitcoin but they have optimized the code so it is more viable to be used as a currency. (Less transaction time, less transaction fee, etc.)\n\nCryptocurrency should be treated as a currency. And a currency needs to be stable. A cryptocurrency shouldn't be an investment. If you want an investment visit a stock market. You can see similar graphs there too. Even EA, our most hated company, has 10 folded its value over a period of 5 years. You see more drastic examples if you look at startups.\n\nThe last time people were cashing out of Bitcoin it was a mess. Too many people were cashing out. It took too long to verify transactions which also meant that in the time they were cashing out they were getting much less as they initially saw.  \nSome transactions were also dropped because the transaction took too long. People had to retry and retry.\n\nAlso is it a good thing to have a cryptocurrency no governing body has control over? The governing body (e.g. the USA for $ and the EU for \u20ac) make sure the currency is stable. Neither companies nor consumers benefit from a volatile currency. They want their currency to have a constant buying power.   \n\nOnce the idea is more fleshed out cryptocurrency will be used by the black market/underground. It is already used by the darkweb. You can make transactions untraceable. The government/IRS can't tell where your cryptocurrency is coming from. You could claim your store is having such income but the IRS can't verify. Cryptocurrency can't be taxed since there is no governing body.    \nIt is hard sending money to a less developed money because you need to go through customs. But with cryptocurrency it is easy.  \nAs long there are people believing in cryptocurrency it will have a value. The cryptocurrency derives its value directly from the amount of money that was invested into it. But if noone/a few believe in it it will quickly lose its value.",

A basic macroeconomic principle is that if demand increases and supply doesn't, then prices go up. So any bitcoins you use to buy a car or whatever, those bitcoins will be worth more a year from the date of the purchase, on average*\n\n*Note that all generally applies when Bitcoins really do become 99%-100% fully mined. I'm not sure about the macroeconomic principles at play currently while they're still being heavily mined and the supply is increasing along with demand, except that everyone knows it's designed to be a deflationary currency and treats it as such, and prices keep increasing which supports that people are treating it as a deflationary currency.",

It costs too much money and takes too much time for BTC to be used for real transactions. The instability doesn't help at all. I think it will be around for a while, but it is more of a commodity like gold, where people buy when they're fearful, and sell when they're not. It could continue to rise, or it could fall very far. I don't think it will go below $1000 again, but I could easily be wrong. I don't see it maintaining this price for long though - this is a clear and classic bubble.",

His comment is entirely valid, but doesn't address the question of using bitcoin for real world transactions as a mechanic.\n\nThe current problem with bitcoin, and a problem that the developers don't seem to want to fix, is that no more than 3 transactions can be processed in a second. This causes massive scalability problems and of course means it's useless if you want to buy a candy bar at the gas station. You're not gonna wait 15 minutes for your turn in the transaction queue when you could swipe a card and pay instantly.\n\nAs well, there are ridiculously high fees charged by the markets when you want to do anything, partially as a result of this low transaction limit as well. You're not gonna pay $9 in fees for a candy bar that costs $1.80.\n\nThe problem is far more complex and involves the shadiest of shady companies fucking with the development process, but the transaction limit is the biggest and will cripple bitcoin for any purpose other than speculation.",

You hold it because it's scarce and other people place value on it as well.  As the number of people who share the idea that gold/bitcoin has value reaches critical mass, it becomes a store of value.  Lots of people are working on making Bitcoin and/or other crypto assets to work more as a currency, but that's not what Bitcoin is functioning as at this moment.",

But advances in technology (and there has been a lot in the 9 years of bitcoins life) is controlled by the difficulty factor.\n\nThis difficulty factor ensures that new coins are created at a regular metric (some every 10 minutes).  The number created every 10 minutes goes down over time, until the 21 million cap is gradually reached.\n\nThe difficulty factor also adjusts up or down depending on how many people are mining as well, so the rate of coin creation is very tightly controlled.  This is important, because a limited supply is what helps bitcoin retain its value.",

Well bitcoin mining is like trying to put the shapes in the correct hole, except there are millions of shapes/holes and the order in which you put the shapes into the holes matters. If you put all of the correct shapes into the correct holes in the correct order, you are awarded with some bitcoins (I think it's 50 but I can't remember if it went down over time). ",

So 1,000,000 is one whole number, commas used just for convenience. As opposed to 10.50 where the decimal as a period says that's the end of something, like the end of a sentence, now here's a partial number. I really think this convention was meant to flow from language like that. Maybe a European can defend their method and perhaps it will make a ton of sense or maybe our convention doesn't make sense to them who knows. All I know is it's not uncommon to see something like 100,50 and it's because they meant one hundred thousand and five hundred but left off a 0 by accident. Plus the whole 50,51 thing where you mean either or, not decimal. Again, not trying to start a fight here I just don't get the conventional difference, why can't we just universalize the number system one way or the other",

Seems kind of good to use that as a decimal separator, since it also seperates two independent clauses (natural numbers and a decimal part) that together form something new. By that logic, using a period as a decimal seperator is kind of weird, because you aren't done writing down your numeric unit (a number) yet. 10.50 doesn't mean 10 and 50. Again, this also falls apart the other way when you look at 100.500 using a period for grouping.\n\nIn fact, any argument comparing the symbols with their grammatical counterparts falls apart pretty quickly, because anything that applies to 40,50 in one system, applies to 400,500 in the other, and the other way around.\n\nWikipedia has a nice piece on the history of decimal seperator through the ages by the way https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#History",

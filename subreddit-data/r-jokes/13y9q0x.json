Sitting in her living room all spiffied up waiting while she puts on her dress, and her sweet old grandfather breaks the tension and leans over from his recliner.\n\n\"Hey, do you know how to turn on a dishwasher? I find lightly fingering her does the trick\".\n\nIn that moment my brain fried, my girlfriend's sweet old Christian grandfather told me a raunchy joke for the first time on a night that very typically ends in debauchery. I was an introverted cautious teen that never did anything rebellious and got a joke of that caliber from a man I would never expect it from.\n\nBrought it up to her that night and apparently that was tame by his standards",

Amelia Earhart flew from Newfoundland to became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.  More than 10,000 Allied aircraft flew through Gander on their way to Europe during the Second World War.  On September 11, 2001, thirty eight commercial aircraft landed in Gander, where the townspeople accommodated 6,500 passengers.  \nAnd yes, I know that you are from Newfoundland.

Got him red handed - it's nowhere near lobster season!\" \n\nHe pulled up alongside the man and warned him of the fine for poaching.\n\nThe old Newfie spitted and fumed at the accusation. \"Bejez, lad - I didn't catch these, I grew em up from nothin' - dey're me pets!\"\n\n\"Oh really - your pets?\"\n\n\"Yes! I was just takin' em out for a walk to see da water.\"\n\nStill skeptical, the officer and the old man stepped over the road barrier and walked along the beach toward the waterline.  The old Newfie laid the two lobsters on the rocks, a foot or so from the lapping water.\n\n\"Der ye is, b'ys. G'wan and have a short swim.\"\n\nTo the officer's amusement, the lobsters did as told - crawled towards and into the water.\n\n\"Okay, then. If they're your pets, then call them back now.\"\n\nWith a glint in his eye, the old Newfie replied \"Sorry, sur - call WHAT back?\"",

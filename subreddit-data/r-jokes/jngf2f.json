That shit isn't healthy, but its kind of funny to look back on it. Its a very similar feeling to if you wake up sick, take a ton of nyquil, cause you don't have dayquil, then chug two five hour energies just to make it through work(also \"fun\").",

I'd cram 3-5 hours just before bed the night before, have a good sleep on it, and the info would be locked in there for the next day, my thoughts sharp and clear. I found that if I had to choose between sleep and studying more, sleep was better. Sleep was my key to victory. Staying up three days for a test just sounds horrifying to me, both for the experience itself, and how badly I'd have done on the test. What worked for you would have ground me to dust. It's weird how wildly different people's study styles can be.",

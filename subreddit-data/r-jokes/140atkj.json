I understand and agree with not using their \"real name\" and using a title instead, but putting even the title on such a pedestal feels extreme.",

There's a contract with God, and contracts are subject to interpretation. And why should this one be any different? If God's all powerful and all knowing, any loopholes in the contract must be there on purpose.\n\nEdit: there's a story about this that I always thought was just a joke about how far this gets taken, but it turns out it's actually [in the Talmud.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oven_of_Akhnai) The legalistic aspect is so baked into Judaism that there's literally a story in the talmud about some rabbis getting god himself to admit he was in the wrong when he personally weighed in on how to interpret a particularly esoteric point of religious law. And he was proud of them for pulling it off!",

The Holocaust is not the first time that humans have done sickening things to other humans (also plants, animals, planets) and it won't be the last. There is no difference in suffering for the individual in a camp in Poland, a slave boat in the Atlantic or a village being burned by Mongols. God did not do these things, man did. God does not change these things because they are part of the whole package. If he created a universe that he controlled the actions of the people within it, what would be the point? That would be like creating a movie, stagnant and empty of meaning for those within it. God wants its creations to find their own meaning. Maybe these terrible events have purposes that we don't fully understand. The holocaust in all its disgusting influence has taught much to those that pay attention. It shows us the horrendous levels that tyranny can take. The dangers of group think and hatred of those that are different. Knowledge of it informs the educated of the insane levels of destruction that are capable by humans in a mechanized modern world. In short, it could be a valuable lesson to people now and in the future to not fuck up even worse. It has and I hope will continue to be, a reason for people to care more and try harder....or it can be trivialize and forgotten and we can repeat it again. Maybe God knows we can do better.",

A universe without a God is in no way simpler or easier to explain than a universe with one. In fact, in many ways its easier to explain with a creator. Being easier to explain does nothing towards evidence. You also have no way of knowing that no other animal has a concept of God. These are assumptions that have no proof and honestly probably can't be proven either way. It goes back to the beginning. There really is no proof in support of or against the existence of God.",

I agree this idea is silly, but it stems from a time when the capacity of the general population to understand the concept, was limited by their knowledge of the universe. People can only see things that they can understand. My personal concept of God is that \"He\" is the entirety of everything in existence. It ensues that we are all small particles of God. Trees, rocks, rabbits, humans, stars, comets...we are all pieces of the entirety. Maybe our Holocaust is like an infection in the blood of God. Are we not nearly \"all powerful\" in the face of an individual bacteria. We understand them. We know how to culture them. How to kill them. Much of what their function is. We are also made up of them. We live consciously on the backs of what we guess to be their \"unconscious\" work and when they are out of balance we are sick. In the end, what it's the universe without some form of \"god\"? What is the purpose? What is the meaning? Who then set the \"rules of physics\"? If they set themselves, then why? How? If you do not believe there is meaning, then how do you live? Do you not find meaning in the relationship you have with your kids or your mom? Does that not translate to your life as a whole? Does your life not translate to society? Does society not translate to the earth? Does the function of the earth not translate to the universe?",

You think it means something to them, which is why you try and help.

You feel bad that something is suffering and you want to help them. Is that not purpose? Everything innately has meaning by the mere fact of its existence. When someone lives and loves and is shot and killed and their children miss their father and their wife is forced to live without a husband and their children's children carry the trauma of the event and it effects the way they raise their children and there is a chain effect that in some way effects thousands of peoples experience in the life they live and how they effect other people and animals and the earth...and you would look that family in the eye and tell them that their fathers life was meaningless?

Everyone\u2019s interpretation is different because they pick and choose what they like and ignore what they don\u2019t like. \n\nIf some parent today says that they were taking their kid to the mountain to sacrifice in the name of god then that parent would be called insane and jailed. But it\u2019s totally ok if Abraham did that. There are countless examples of very inappropriate and simply wrong behavior that we just ignore.  Millions of people around the world are cutting pieces of kids genitals off in the name of religion. Talk about insane behavior that is normalized. Either it is the word of God or it is not, you don\u2019t get to pick and choose.",

There are many stories such as Exodus and the battle of Jericho where God acts to save and free the Jews.  To watch/witness things like the Russian pogroms and the Holocaust, many modern Jews would have lost their faith in their biblical teachings and become more secular and their Judaism becomes more about honoring their heritage (cultural link to their forefathers) than a religious act.\n\nOf course there are stories like Job where god is testing your faith - but to wipe out 6 million people including babies and kids to teach a lesson - who would want to follow that God?\n\nThe same can be said about slavery or any people that are murdered, can lose faith in their God.  The only historical difference would be the biblical covenant the Jews are said to have with God.",

While where it waits is debatable, most jews would agree that if you do your mitzvot you'll wait in heaven. \n\nConcensus? I am not there Jewish department of statistics but the majority of believing will surely agree. Chabad is one of the largest Jewish movements and then openly talk about afterlife in heaven.

For instance, I was always taught that while there is belief in a Heaven, there is also a belief in something like reincarnation? But the latter might be more of a personal belief that happens to be held by a lot of people, I'm not sure. For instance, my mother, who has always been highly religious, had told me plenty when I was younger that jews believe in a Heaven, but not a Hell (at least most don't believe in a Hell. I think like the person above said seems to work, \"you believe what you believe\", since my fiancee can attest to being told about a hell before in yeshiva. *shrug*) but also, yes, we believe we come back.  (Not referring to messiah) .\n\nBut then again, when we were joking about her mother and brother, my mom said \"well they're both up there, annoying the shit out of each other, or hopefully staying far away from each other .\n\nBut the thing is, the usual answer you get in yeshiva and from rabbi is to not ask questions. I think it might have to do with the fact that if we don't believe in a Hell, only a Heaven, and if the belief of reincarnation is more personal than a religion-wide thing like I said, then *where the hell do all the bad people go*?? I never understood that. At least with reincarnation, I could assume that they're reincarnated and forced to be better in the next life/lives in order to be let into Heaven.",

She starts telling a long involved humorous true story about a guard in the camp who was murderously cruel, tossing babies in the air and catching them on his bayonet, stomping on the hands of women who fainted after hours of standing at attention at roll call, etc. The punchline is when something awful he does causes him the most minor of inconveniences, like blood from the pregnant woman he's beating gets on his collar and he's chastised for it by his superior. God turns his magnificence upon her and says oh my child, that's not funny. She shrugs and says, guess you had to be there.",

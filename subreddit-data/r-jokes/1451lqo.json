A law was enacted making stealing sheep punishable by death, while fucking them was only punishable by a fine or light jail time, so it was better to claim to have been engaging in beastiality than to admit to having been stealing the sheep.\n\nEither way, makes for some great (if WAY too old) jokes.",

They go to Wales, see a lot of sheep and say \"oh, you must have sex with those, huh?\"  They went to Scotland saw lots of sheep and said the same thing.  They went to Egypt, saw lots of camels and said \"oh you must have sex with those, huh?\".  They went to Afghanistan, saw a lot of goats and said \"oh you must have sex with those, huh?\"\n\nIs it just the British that have these latent zoophilic tendencies?",

I mean, as someone on a different continent, I don't think it's that unnatural to have a limited knowledge of those specifics.  I think if you polled most North Americans about the difference between Britain and England, you'd find there'd be a lot of ignorance of the difference.  \n\nBut it comes down to the saying \"if everyone you meet is an asshole, then you're probably the asshole.\"  In this case, if the English thinks everyone with animals must be shagging them, that says more about the English than anyone else.  I don't think that observation really requires a knowledge of whether or not Wales is a province or separate country or whatever within the United Kingdom.",

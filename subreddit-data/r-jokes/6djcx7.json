First year was early access to 8 operators and some premium currency (all 8 operators can be earned for free) as well as a boost to the non-premium currency earned. Year 2 is the same, and was announced last December as the game gained popularity. Not to mention each pass was $30 and I was able to earn all operators without spending a dime on DLC. However, they delayed all DLC for 3 months to fix the game a year and a half after release (fixing hit registration, lag, glitches, etc.), and canned one of the free maps they were originally making.

That makes much more sense.\n\n\n~~I don't understand what I'm missing here.~~\n \n~~I'm familiar with buying items that can be unlocked for free in a game. Plenty of games have had the model where items have an \"standard in-game currency price\" and a \"in-game currency that's just code for real money\" price. You could grind for standard currency and eventually buy the item, or just use real money and buy it outright.~~\n\n~~I'm also familiar with subscription based games. In WoW, you'd buy the game and buy a subscription for $15 a month. If your subscription ran out, you can't play the game anymore and lose access to all of your gear that you got in the game.~~\n \n~~But I've never heard of *subscription gear* where you pay money for the gear and they take it away if you stop paying.~~\n \n~~To me, that is very unreasonable.~~",

They forced Respawn to release Titanfall 2 right between them assuming people would be willing it buy both EA games instead of both Battlefield and CoD. Turns out a lot of people don't want to spend $170 for 2 games and 1 season pass on opening weekend so most just got Battlefield and it's season pass. Couple that with the fact that most AAA FPS games tend to have most of their sales in the first 2 weeks it meant that Titanfall 2 has sold less copies than Titanfall 1, significantly lower then it was projected to sell.\n\nTitanfall 2 tanked, and most of the reasons are due to EA being dumb.",

[At least as far as I can tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respawn_Entertainment), though they do seem to be funded by them in part, so the future will probably see changes to that.\n\nAs for other [acquisitions of EA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Electronic_Arts). Well I can't really say much. Most of those companies are now listed as having no value, probably cause they were simply gobbled up.\n\nTo my eyes EA is one of the scourges on good gaming. Deals like the one with Respawn seem good - but where ever EA gets too much control it turns to, what I consider, shit.\n\nBut I've been avoiding EA games since spring 2012, so my for any games newer than that all I really got to go on are reports and playing sports games at friends' places.",

The story was great, the cutscenes amazed and immersed me into the game world, the base building/combat was simple, but enjoyable, the aesthetics were interesting and memorable, and the music still remains as some of the best the genre has seen. \n\nAbout 10 years later I was so happy to buy Command and Conquer 4 to see how much the series had improved. I went through their whole registration process, got into the game, played the first 4 or so levels and I felt..nothing.  It felt like someone had just gone through a list of what makes a rts and stopped once all the checkboxes were filled. I haven't touched that game since.  \n\nA few months later a kid in my photoshop class was telling me about c&amp;c and told me he was about to buy c&amp;c 4.  I explained to him that I know the series and that c&amp;c was awful.  He said he was surprised I had played the older games and that he didn't believe me.  A few weeks later he walked up to me and just said, \"you're right, that was awful!\".     \n\nEA has affected many of us. I haven't bought a game without reading reviews ever since. ",

They became complacent when they got access to EA's funding, and took several subpar projects at once without polishing a single one. Meanwhile, the studio EA brought with them and labeled Westwood Pacific, was happily making Red Alert 2 and Generals and basically survived until 2010. \n\nAlso, Westwood closed in 2003, not the 90s. Those who were worth a damn went to EALA and Blizzard, those who sucked (and Klepacki who us awesome) made Petroglyph.\n\nSo, cut the fanboyisms.",

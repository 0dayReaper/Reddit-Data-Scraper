Only available group was an accordion ensemble. Well last minute beggers can't be choosers, so he hired them. They showed up, played great, everyone was having a blast and then it was midnight and the party started winding down. The guy paid the accordion players, gave them a tip and said how great they were. He even asked if they could play at his party next year (technically end of this year but y'know, he was a little buzzed still). The accordion guys said sure and asked, \"Is it okay if we leave our accordions here till the gig?\"",

He goes up to those squaddies and says he's finally ready to use the camel.\n\n\"Sure!\" they say, and one even brings a stool to help the guy up. The guy fucks the camel with such energy that when he's finally finished, he  collapses on the sand, panting.\n\n\"Wow,\" he says. \"That was actually fantastic. I've never felt anything like it. Tell me, how did you find it?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't know,\" the squaddies say. \"We usually ride it into town where the brothels are.\"",

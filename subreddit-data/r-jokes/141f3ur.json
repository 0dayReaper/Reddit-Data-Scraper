Women would always come up to me and say things like,  let me guess, sweet and tan?  And then I would turn stood and show them the back,  \"ground up and in the freezer.\"\n\nThe shocked looks on their faces provided me with enough entertainment to last for weeks.  It helps that I can deliver these kind of jokes without looking like I drive a van with curtains.",

    "postText": "Seamus had come to the end of his days; his time on this planet was short. Gathered around him was his wife and his four sons. Three of his sons were fine, tall men but the fourth was not. Aiden was a bit scrawny, and quite thin. Seamus says to his wife:\n\n\"Mary...I've not much time left. So I want to ask you something that's bothered me for many a day. Please tell me the truth...is Aiden really my son?\"\n\nMary says \"Seamus, as God is my witness I swear on all that's good and holy that Aiden is indeed your child.\"\n\nWith that Seamus breathed a sigh of relief, his last breath in this world. Mary closed his eyes, pulled the blanket over his face and said:\n\n\"Whew...thank God he didn't ask about the other three!\"",

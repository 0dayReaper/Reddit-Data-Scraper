In order for sentences to make sense, words get different endings depending on what they\u2019re doing in the sentence. \n\nThe -us ending in \u201cmartinus\u201d makes it the subject of the sentence, while the -um in \u201cmartinum\u201d makes it the direct object. Since the verb \u201chabeo\u201d/\u201chave\u201d takes a direct object, we need to use \u201cmartinum\u201d in the sentence because it\u2019s the direct object form of the word. \u201cHabebo\u201d is the 1st person singular future tense of \u201chabeo\u201d, so \u201cI will have the martini\u201d translates to \u201cMartinum habebo.\u201d \nEven though word order isn\u2019t as important in Latin, the verb usually goes at the end of sentences, where in English it almost always goes in the middle.\n\nI hope that makes sense.",

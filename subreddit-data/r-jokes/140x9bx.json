    "postText": "An Amish man is driving his horse-drawn cart when he gets to a toll road.  The toll keeper says \"That will be $10 please.\"  \n\n\nThe Amish man says, \"I thought that was only for motor vehicles.\"  \n\n\n\"No,\" says the toll keeper.  \"All vehicles, no exceptions.\"  \n\n\nSo the Amish man turns around, goes a ways back up the road, takes the horse out of its harness, puts the horse in the driver's seat, puts himself in the harness, and pulls the cart back to the toll gate.  Again, the gate keeper says, \"That will be $10 please.\"  \n\n\nThe Amish man gestures over his shoulder.  \"Talk to the driver.\"",

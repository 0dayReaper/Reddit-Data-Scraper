    "postText": "He tells the dentist my left tooth hurts. \nThe dentist said sorry but there's no cure for that so you'll have to eat the other side. Later that day he goes to a barbecue, he gets a sausage goes to the bathroom and locks himself. His friends walk past the door and hear moaning, they ask him what's wrong he says 'the dentist told me to eat from the other side'",

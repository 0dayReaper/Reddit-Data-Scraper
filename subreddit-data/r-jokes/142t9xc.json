No? Then should you not inform yourself before you make such a judgment?\"\n\n\"And how should I do that,\" she demands, \"when you know well that a Sister of Charity cannot be seen going into such a place?\"\n\n\"I could bring a drink out to you,\" the man suggests.\n\nThe Sister wattles up. \"And what will people think when they see a nun drinking in the street?\"\n\n\"I'll bring you gin,\" he says, \"in a teacup - and who's to know it's not water?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" says the nun. \"But no more than half a pint, mind!\"\n\nChuckling, the man goes into the bar, and he says to the bartender, \"A pint of stout if you please, Charlie, and take something for yourself... and could I please have half a pint of gin in a teacup?\"\n\n\"Aww, Jayzus!\" says the bartender. \"Is that fecking nun out there again?\"",

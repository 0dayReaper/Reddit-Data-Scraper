The immigrant argument was a red herring: [EU legislation already existed to limit immigration](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/152/immigration-policy), and the UK government *chose* not to employ it.\n\nYou're getting downvoted because people don't like you asking these awkward questions.

    "postText": "Before entering the first house, he tells him: \"I'm sure you think you learned everything you needed to know about the job, but you'll have to learn how to observe the patients and their habits if you want to diagnose them properly.\"\n\nThey go to the first patient, a bed-ridden woman. The doctor takes a good look at her, jots down some notes, fumbles with the pen which falls to the floor, picks it back up and finally says: \"You are suffering from overexertion. For the next few days take it easy and try not to exhaust yourself with the house cleaning as you're doing right now.\"\n\nOn the way out, the postdoc asks: \"How did you know she overexerted herself with house cleaning?\" and the doctor replies: \"Ah you see, I dropped my pen on purpose so I had an excuse to look around, and sure enough the floor didn't have a speck of dust on it, even under the bed. That's how I knew she kept cleaning even when she started feeling sick. Tell you what, why don't you try with the next patient?\"\n\nThey go to the next house and visit another bedridden woman. The assistant starts taking notes, then pretends to drop his pen and bends down to pick it up, then confidently says \"Ma'am, you suffer from heatstroke. I think you should be avoiding going to church for a while.\"\n\nAfter leaving, the doctor, puzzled, asks the postdoc: \"That was really specific. How did you know she got heat stroke in the church?\" and the postdoc replies: \"Well, inside the church it is clearly very hot these days: when I went to pick up my pen and look around, I saw the priest under the bed, and he was naked and covered in sweat.\"",

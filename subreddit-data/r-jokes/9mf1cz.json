After 15 minutes, the officer stops by.\n\n\"Son I'm changing your post to the mess hall. Go in there and start washing some dishes.\"\n\nThe recruit obeys, and heads to the mess hall. He's cleaned about 3 dishes when the officer walks up again.\n\n\"Listen here recruit, your new post is in the supply room. I need you to make sure everything is strapped down tight, in case of rough waters.\"\n\nThe recruit again follows orders, and heads off to the supply room. There, he sees a crewman, moving some boxes.\n\n\"Hey there,\" says the recruit. \"is it normal to keep getting reassigned to new posts all day? I haven't kept one position for more than 15 minutes!\"\n\nThe crewman says \"Oh yeah- this sub is full of reposts.\" ",

Band geek, still lived at home with her parents, but she had a rockin' bod. \n\nUnfortunate, though, because I had to go to her parent's house to spend any time with her. She was so uptight. I could never get her to come to my dorm. \n\nAnyways, her mom was hilarious. She was from Great Britian now living in the US. Her mom showed me this ad and couldn't stop laughing. Honestly, it is hilarious. \n\nThis brought back memories of the band girl 2006. Thanks OP!",

A newbie, new recruit, first time stationed on a sub is all the same in my book.  They go through a ton of shit to get there and once they are there it is all thrown away and they stary fresh and have to prove themselves.  I totally get it. A submariners life is no joke and you have to have a lot of trust in your shipmates.  I think that the compression and decompression fucks with thier heads a bit but I still enjoy working with them for the past 12yrs.  I will definitely pass this along to all of them i see.  I know quite a few will get a kick out of this...",

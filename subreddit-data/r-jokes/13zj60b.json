    "postText": "They hired us to move a bunch of heavy cabinets filled with old war memorabilia from one building to another. Letter/postcards from soldiers, antique tools/weapons, mannequins in uniforms, etc. \n\nWe were just about done, with one cabinet left: a large, glass display case, filled with mannequin heads wearing helmets, wedges, and caps. We carefully took it down a flight of stairs, across a rain-soaked parking lot, loaded it into a truck, drove it down the street, unloaded it, and just had *another* flight of stairs to go, before the case would be set for the foreseeable future. With 20 minutes to go before the end of the day, we were all relieved that such a job went so flawlessly.\n\nThen, about halfway up the stairs, the case slipped\n\nThe immense weight, coupled with the lose display heads, rocked the fragile case so hard that the glass shattered, spilling all the heads and hats onto the floor and down the stairs. Everyone stared in silent disbelief at the scene for a solid minute before letting out a collective groan.\n\nNeedless to say, the accident caused heads to roll.",

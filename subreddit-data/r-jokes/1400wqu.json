He returns a few days later, sticks his head in and asks the same question from before.\n\nThe barber looks around and says, \u201cAbout two hours.\u201d\n\nThe man leaves.  A few days later the same man returns and again asks the same question.\n\nThe barber looks around and says, \u201cAbout an hour and a half.\u201d\n\nThe man leaves.  The barber turns to his friend and says, \u201cHey, do me a favor and follow that guy and see where he goes every few days.  He just asks how long before he can get a haircut and never gets one.  He just leaves.\u201d\n\nThe friend returns after a while laughing hysterically.  The barber asks his friend, \u201cSo where does the guy go when he leaves?\u201d\n\nThe friend wipes tears from his eyes and says, \u201cYour house!\u201d",

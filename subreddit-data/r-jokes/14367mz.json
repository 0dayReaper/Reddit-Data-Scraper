Your mind in this model is broken up into three states: ego, super ego, and id (prounced  ih-d, not I D). Id is the raw impulses and desires.  Super ego is all of your ethical bounds and rules you place on yourself or society places on you.  Ego has to negotiate these two extremes. Someone who operates entirely on id is likely to end up in prison, or just dead. Just super ego would also be very difficult to just ignore all impulses.",

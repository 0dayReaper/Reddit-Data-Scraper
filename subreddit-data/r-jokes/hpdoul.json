But because so many people have called the hash sign a hashtag, hashtag has become a synonym. And even better, though they have the exact same denotation, the connotation is slightly different between the two (in that the particular word chosen can imply information about the speaker's age, education, etc.). And this is a particularly interesting example, since we have so many synonyms (hash sign, hashtag, octothorpe, pound sign, number sign, sharp, and probably more that I'm forgetting), and all of them convey slightly different information about the speaker and the context in which they are used to encountering the symbol.",

Flash forward many years when I'm working at a large company (circa 1981) and an entire new telephone system was being installed....  One of the features was that you could pick up a call that was on \"hold\" by hitting #(and then the two-digit number the switchboard operator announced on the PA system) from any phone. \\[Prior to this, the operator would have to put the incoming call on \"hold\", page the person not answering his phone and then inquire as to what extension he was calling from when he responded to the page, and then forward the call.\\] So with the new system we'd announce on the PA, \"John Employee, pound (two digits)\". Anyway, I remember this one employee angrily calling the switchboard and telling me \"I've been pounding 19 as hard as I can and I'm still not getting my call!!\"",

The other peanut cried for help and when the cops finally showed up they saw him over his friend's limp body and screamed at him to put his hands up. And he said I don't have any hands! And then they shot him seven times. Later the cops testified the peanut had a gun. An all-cashew citizens review board cleared the cops of any wrongdoing.",

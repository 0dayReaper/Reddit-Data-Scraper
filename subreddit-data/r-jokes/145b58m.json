    "postText": "In the beginning of 15th Century, Tamerlane defeated the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid and captured him. After the defeat of Ottomans Tamerlane invaded Anatolia and reached all the way to the Aegean Sea. While doing that he met many great scholars and teachers. One of them was the great thinker Nasreddin Hoca( Teacher Nasreddin). \nTamerlane, with time, became really close with Nasreddin . They shared a lot of sophisticated conversation about this life and afterlife. After a while Tamerlane, to show his generousity and kindness, gifted one of his elephants to Hoca Nasreddin's village. Everyone tought this was a great honor and was eager to take care of this creature. \n\nBut there was a problem. The elephant was eating a lot of food.  Also it was getting bigger as it eats , so elders of the village gathered around to solve this problem. Finally they couldn't think anything but return the elephant to Tamerlane. They eventually brought this idea to Nasreddin Hoca.  \nHoca was reluctant at first but understood the villagers. He said:\n- Allright, but I can not do this alone. We have to go as the elders of the village and face Tamerlane all together. \nElders of the village was scared of Tamerlane but with no other hope they aggreed with the Hoca's plan.\n\nThe journey started with a large group with many elders and their sons. They traveled 2 days and 2 nights. They passed hills, small rivers and even a forrest.\nThey eventually reached the domain of the Tamerlane. Soldiers started to show up and they started to ask questions. But once they recognized the Hoca, they let the group pass. After traveling a little more Hoca started to realise his group was getting smaller and smaller. Hoca tought elders wouldnt do such a think and he said to himself  \"I must have been really tired\". That night Hoca and the remaining elders and sons made camp in the woods.\n \nNext day Hoca woke up and he couldn't see anyone near him. Hoca was shook and couldn't believe his eyes. He too wanted to turn back but he was old and couldn't travel alone back home. He decided to continue and reach Tamerlane's compound which is a few hours away. \nAfter traveling a few hours, Hoca finally reached the Tamerlane who was hunting in that time. He entered his big red tent with the flag of Timurids. Tamerlane was surprised, he wasnt expecting the Hoca but welcomed him with open arms. Tamerlane clapped his hands and beautiful maidens brought various foods and drinks in front of the Hoca. After eating all that incredible food Hoca regained his power again. They talked with Tamerlane for hours and hours.\n\nEventually Tamerlane asked \"Why Did you come all this way by yourself? If you asked I would sent you my private carrier. Tell me what is the reason of your visit?\" Hoca set himself straight and tried to speak. \"My sultan, the elephant you gifted us earlier...\" Tamerlane became dead serious, looked directly in the eyes of Hoca and said \"Did something happened to her!? Tell me Hoca what is wrong!?\" Hoca calmed Tamerlane and said \"Dont be afraid she is fine.\" Tamerlane said impatiently \"What it is then? What is the problem?\"\nHoca tought about the villagers at home how they were so fed up with the elephant. Then he remembered how they left him to speak with Tamerlane alone. After thinking for a while Hoca said:\n\n-You know she is so lonely lately...",

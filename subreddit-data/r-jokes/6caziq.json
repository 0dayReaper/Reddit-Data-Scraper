I remember people suggesting a migration there when the whole Ellen Pao nonsense was going on. I think that's when they got most of their userbase. So saying it used to be left leaning may be true, but they weren't really much of a site before our banned right wing communities needed a new home. ",

Therefor, I don't really like Voat. Sure, in principle I support them, but I don't want to make fun of fat people.\n\nThat said, I totally want T_D gone.

When I was shadowbanned what bothered me was the fact that I didn't know it happened. Worse I didn't know what I did wrong. I can't stop a behavior if I don't know what that behavior is.\n\nSo by that logic banning a subreddit without warning or giving them a chance to correct the problem, it just feels wrong to me. Worse, not giving a reason at all at the moment of the ban? It's just something I can't support.\n\nLuckily that's not the case now, with T_D. ",

Going \"alpha\" on the boss is an interesting way to gain unemployment checks, and you can't rightly force a restructure of decades of family development. So... kinda curious how these guys reconcile that in their heads. ",

            "comment": "A rich businessman walks into a bar, and a fellow is drinking next to the piano, where a rat is playing away some great tunes. Casually hopping around the piano in a practiced way, the rat seems to enjoy it, and beside him is a jar with loads of tips stuffed in it.\n\nImmediately the man rushes over to the piano. \"That's amazing! You know, I'm in the movie business, and we would make loads of money with your rat! How about I give you a hundred thousand dollars if you let me borrow your rat!\"\n\nThe fellow shrugs his shoulders and glances at the rat. \"Awww, that sounds nice, but I dunno. I really like mah rat, and he's pretty swell. I don't think I can accept your offer.\"\n\nThe businessman looks annoyed, but doesn't protest, instead going to collect himself with a drink at the bar, thinking over how to convince the man, when the man pulls a frog out of his pocket and sets it on the piano. A moment later the frog bursts into song while the rat plays piano. It's absolutely fantastic singing, too!\n\nOnce the song is over, the businessman walks over once more. \"Tell you what, mister. You got your rat, and you seem to like him and all, but the frog...I'll give you a half a million for the frog, okay?\"\n\nAgain, the man looks a little unsure, but seems to have relaxed a bit more. The businessman starts writing a check, and waves it in the man's face, before finally he accepts and nods his head in consent. Immediately the businessman scoops up the frog and rushes out before he can reconsider.\n\nThe rat turns to the man and says, \"How many of those idiots are we going to trick with my ventriloquism act?\"",

Standing next to the cage the man asks, \"I wonder why he is so cheap?\" \"Because I am defective,\" came the reply. \"I've got no legs.\" A little surprised the man asked, \"Well how do you stay on your perch?\" The parrot draws him closer and whispers, \"I have a big penis. I just wrap it around the bar and stay put. Go offer the owner 30 bucks for me. He'll take it.\" The man walks out of the store with the parrot and takes him home. They become best of friends. They talk sports, politics, current events. The man could not be happier. One day the man gets home from works and the parrot beckons him over with his wing...\"Psst...come here. I need to talk to you.\" \"What?\" \"It's about your wife.\" \"Yeah, what about her?\" \"And the postman. Today he knocked and she answered the door in a skimpy black negligee.\" \"What!\" \"Yes. And then they embraced in a long passionate kiss,\" the parrot went on. \"Holy shit...that can't be possible.\" \"It is. Then they went over to the couch and she slipped him out of his uniform and then things started to get really steamy.\" \"Well,\" the man asks,\"what happened next?\" \"I don't know,\" said the parrot. \"I got a hard on and fell off my perch.\" ",

All they do is recite the rosary, day and night. I'll bring the parrot home and they will teach her to pray.\" \n\nSo the priest takes the parrot home. His two parrots, heads bowed over tiny Bibles, are earnestly reciting the rosary. \n \n\"Raaawk, I'll suck your mizzenmast,\" the parrot screeches. \n\nOne of the priest's parrots elbows the other. \"Put away the Bible, George, our prayers have been answered!\" ",

There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the Magician did every trick.\n\nOnce he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show, \"Look, it's not the same hat!\" or, \"Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table!\" Or \"Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?\"\n\nThe magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the Captain's parrot.\n\nThen one stormy night on the Pacific, the ship unfortunately sank.\n\nThe magician luckily found himself on a piece of wood floating in the middle of the sea, as fate would have it ... With the parrot.\n\nThey stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.\n\nThis went on for a day... And then 2 days. And then 3 days. Finally on the 4th day, the parrot could not hold back any longer and said...\n\n\"Okay, I give up. Where's the ship?\"\n\n",

The parrot continued, so he put him in the freezer for a couple minutes. \n\nAfter he started to feel guilty, he opened it and the parrot seemed real ashamed of itself. It was acting very apologetic, and said it would never say those words again. The parrot said to its new owner, \"can I just ask one question, what did the chicken do?\"",

He tiptoed through the living room but suddenly he froze in his tracks when he heard a loud voice say: \"Jesus is watching you!\"\n\nSilence returned to the house, so the burglar crept forward again. \"Jesus is watching you,\" the voice boomed again.\n\nThe burglar stopped dead again. He was frightened. Frantically,he looked all around. In a dark corner, he finally spotted a bird cage and in the cage was a parrot.\n\nThe burglar breathed a sigh of relief, then asked the parrot, \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Moses,\" said the bird.\n\n\"Moses? That's a strange name for a parrot\", sneered the burglar. \n\nThe parrot replied, \"Yes, but it's not as strange as Jesus... for a Rottweiler!\"",

Finally the pet store owner walks over, and the man says \"hey, how do you get this bird to sing?\"  \n\n\"Oh, Chet?  He's an obstinate one -- you've got to light a match under his feet to get him to sing.  Here, let me show you.\"  So he lights a match and puts it under Chet's left foot, and the parrot starts singing \"jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...\". He then puts it under Chet's right foot, and he starts singing \"have a holly jolly Christmas...\"  The man was impressed, and bought the parrot.\n\nHe takes him home, and shows his wife.  He lights a match and puts it under Chet's left foot -- \"jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...\"  He puts it under Chet's right foot -- \"have a holly jolly Christmas...\". His wife is so impressed she calls for their son to come see this.\n\nThey light a match, put it under Chet's left foot -- \"jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...\"  They put it under Chet's right foot -- \"have a holly jolly Christmas...\"  \n\nImpressed, the son asks \"so what happens if you put the match between his feet?\"  The man says \"I don't know, let's try it.\"\n\n\"Chet's nuts roasting on an open fire...\"",

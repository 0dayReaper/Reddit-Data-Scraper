    "postText": "As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: \"5 lamb chops, please.\"\nAmazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.\nHe follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and\ntrot across the road to a bus-stop.\nThe dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.\nWhen a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.\nThe butcher follows, dumbstruck.\nAs the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.\nAfter awhile he stands on his back paws to push the \"stop\" bell,\nthen the butcher follows him off.\nThe dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.\nHe goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.\nHe does this again and again. No answer.\nSo he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,\njumps off, and waits at the front door.\nA big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.\nThe butcher runs up and screams at the guy: \"What the hell are you doing?\nThis dog's a genius!\"\nThe owner responds, \"Genius, my ass.........\nIt's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!\"",

            "comment": "Reminds of this dog joke:\n\nA guy is driving around the back woods and he sees a sign in front of a broken down, shanty-style house: **Talking Dog For Sale.** He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.\n\nThe guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador retriever sitting there.\n\n\"You talk?\" he asks. \n\n\"Yep,\" the Lab replies. \n\nAfter the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says \"So, what's your story?\"\n\nThe Lab looks up and says, \"Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.\n\n\"I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running. But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.\n\n\"I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.\"\n\nThe guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog. \n\n\"Ten dollars,\" the guy says.\n\n\"Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap??\"\n\n\"Because the dog's a damn liar. He never did any of that shit.\"\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nEdit: Since this blew up I won't change anything, but if I told it again I would change the dog's first reply from \"yep\" to something like \"sure do\" - I think it works a little better. If you're creative this joke is perfect for expanding; adding more stories to the dog's tale I bet bolsters the punchline. ",

His girlfriend wanted to name it after her favorite animal (kangaroo), but he hated them, so when they broke up and he got the dog, he insisted the spelling be Ru. I feel bad for the dog though, he was a pretty terrible owner. Turns out my roommate was really into gambling, and snorting crystal meth (but not smoking. He stressed this over and over when we confronted him). He actually Pawned his dog, to pay for some meth. By that point, he had been in the house dog for over a year, and we all loved him, so we were pissed (The Disappearance actually led to us having conversations with him that ended up having his addictions). Anyway, so we call the cops on him and kick him out. The next order of business is to rescue Ru, but we don't know where to start. This is the early days of Facebook, so we really couldn't piece together via social media, or start of viral thing like you can now, so each of us went to a place we knew he would hang out, and asked around. We knew he was getting out of jail the next day, so this will be our only opportunity.... So we made the poor decision to Scooby-Doo it and cover more ground. My buddy had his wallet stolen at knifepoint, and our other roommate ended up getting knocked out, and came through with nothing missing, which concern turn even more. I was the lucky one who got an actual lead, when a rich druggie friend of his pointed me to a mansion on the outskirts of town. I roll up, a little concerned bye the last 24 hours, but honestly intrigued. There are statues of this particular breed of dog all through the garden, and a couple aquatic versions spitting water in little Fountain scattered throughout the couple Acre Drive up. Cameras are clearly following me as I approach the house, but determined to get back Ru, I press on. No I know you're picturing mcmansion, but I want to stress to you how small that is in comparison to the same. And I live in the midwest, so nothing is more than a hundred years old, but this thing looks like it could have been from royalty in Europe in the 1700s. Anyway, After knocking on the door of this damnable castle for about 2 minutes, lights to the side of the house go off, and the light on the entryway flickers off. The door slowly opens, but I can't see inside. Anyway, we got the dog back, and he actually lived till he was about 13 years old. God we loved Ru.",

One day we ended up getting a pair of twin pups that were a mix of some sort that I can't recall. As these pups grew up they started to jump over the backyard fence... and taught Billy how to do it as well. \n\nThis became a habit, they'd do it often. It was a semi-small town. Prior to this there was another dog known around town for walking to the butchers and sitting at the door so he could get a bone. Old fella! Anyways, at some point the trio of dogs we owned picked up on this and often would do the same.. waiting at the butchers in hopes of getting a juicy snack to bite on.\n\nIt always scared me as a kid having them run off but they always came back, they eventually became so well known around town that anytime they got out we'd get a call from someone or another telling us where they were located.",

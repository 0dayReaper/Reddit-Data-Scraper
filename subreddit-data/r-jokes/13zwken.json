    "postText": "An Illinois man left the snowballed streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida.\n\nHis wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day.\n\nWhen he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick e-mail.\n\nUnable to find the scrap of paper on which he had written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from memory.\n\nUnfortunately, he missed one letter and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife, whose husband had passed away only the day before.\n\nWhen the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor dead.\n\nAt the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen:\n\nDearest Wife, Just got checked in. Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow. \nYour Loving Husband.\n\nPS: Sure is hot down here.",

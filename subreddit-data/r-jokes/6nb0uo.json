    "postText": "His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!  Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.  I'm so glad I could give so many people a chuckle today!  ",

They ignored her, too.\n\nSo, the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest\nand most vicious thug in town, to \"persuade\" them to close.\nHugh beat up the friars and trashed their store, saying he'd\nbe back if they didn't close shop. Terrified, the friars did so,\nthereby proving that . . .\n\nHugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.",

The air up there is clear, and so beautiful flowers grow on the hill. \n\nOne day, the monks realize donations alone are not keeping the monastery together. The roof is falling apart, the doors creak, and they are eating rice and beans for every meal. They need more money, and fast. \n\nWell, one of the monks has the idea of selling the wildflowers down in the town to raise more money. This is a brilliant idea! So the monks spend the afternoon picking flowers. \n\nWhen they get down to the town, it is only a matter of picking a location for their stall. The same genuis monk comes up with the idea to sell on the street in front of the Playboy mansion. That way, men who are coming to the mansion will think, \"you know, I haven't surprised my wife with flowers in a while,\" and thus they can also keep men from temptation. So the monks set up there. \n\nAlmost immediately, business is booming! The monks rejoice that their monastery will have a new roof at last! But inside the mansion, the girls are realizing what is happening. So a few come out, and ask the monks to move, because, y'know, they're stealing business. \n\nThe monks disagree. They are doing a wonderful thing, and what are these girls doing being such filthy heathens anyway? The girls, steaming mad but unable to do anything, go inside. \n\nThe next day, business is even better for the monks and even worse for the girls. A few more come out this time, and once again they ask the monks to move. The monks, once again, refuse on principle, they're not doing anything illegal after all. The girls give up again. \n\nThe day after that, there is more business at the flower stand than the monks could ever have predicted! But the girls are angry. So they get out the big guns. \n\nHugh Hefner himself strolls out of the mansion in his smokin' jacket, walks up to the monks and explains that while the monks are not doing anything illegal, and they may not agree with what the girls are doing, business is business, and it would be much appreciated if the monks would relocate. The monks finally see the error of their ways and pack up their stand to move somewhere else. \n\nWhich just goes to show...\n\nOnly Hugh can prevent florist friars.  ",

It seemed like odd phrasing, forced, and not really part of real musical terms. I thought the punchline might have gone toward a birthday note card, but couldn't think of anything else. If I realized he was counting to the seventh note I might have made the connection.\n\nWhat was also definitely intentional was not saying fourth, fifth or sixth note. Instead he skipped to Sam's age. We would have had to do simple math to figure out that on Sam's 25th birthday that that would be the seventh note, which of course no body will do while reading a joke, so it obscures the punchline further. It's still there for you to get.",

                            "comment": "I know what you mean. There's a brilliant example of a a joke that you know is coming, but you don't expect, http://natethesnake.com/ that works because you get invested in it. I heartily recommend it. The lengthier the joke, the more anticlimactic the ending. I believe it's called bathos.\n\nI think buildup-punchline a popular style because it can be so effective even when you expect some bamboozlement. You can glance at a long body of text in a post and know with 100% certainty that there's a joke at the end, but you'll never know which until you reach the end. It's like telling someone a prophecy about their time of death. They still have no idea how they'll die until they are frowning and clutching at their chest after insulting someone's cooking. In bothe cases, you know that the end is coming, but not how. That's why skipping to the end is so tempting. You know the only way to find out what the joke is is skip to the end, or read a massive block of text. The anticipation and suspense only builds up, and generally the only thing stopping people from spoiling it is the discipline that comes from knowing it will be so much better if you be patient.\n\nI think the buildup is actually the most important part, because it affects the reader so much. You can stick any old fart joke at the end of the buildup and it will still be relatively funny. The reader regards it as so much more than a simple fart joke. The fact of the matter is that some jokes are easy, fart jokes included. For example, \"John Doe's parents were deer\" is very simple to create, but not humorous. You don't get any credit for easy jokes. Readers, however, will be far more happy about being tricked when some work has clearly been put into it.\n\nBecause of that, it matters less about how much work went into the punchline if the reader is secure in their knowledge that a lot of time and energy went into the joke just for the buildup. It's no longer a cheap laugh.\n\nThere are certain hazards to jokes. Any joke structure can get old, like knock-knock puns, but I'd argue that the buildup-punchline formula is less of a joke structure than a meta joke structure. What I mean is that I could make a knock-knock joke with a long buildup, so if \"knock-knock\" is a type of joke, \"buildup-punchline\" is a type of type of joke. Another example of a meta joke structure is the antijoke. It is a joke based on subversion of expectations, like \"'Knock knock', 'Who's there?', 'The police. I'm afraid we have some bad news, ma'am.'\" which works when the reader expects a pun, but less so when the reader expects an antijoke. You, the reader, already knew the example was an antijoke.\n\nNow, antijokes can still be funny when you expect them. /r/Jokes has been around for nine years at time of writing, since 2008, and /r/AntiJokes has been around for seven. This proves that people can find an antijoke funny when they expect it rather than a joke. This is because for seven years, people have navigated to a place where they expected antijokes, then laughed and upvoted and subscribed. We have of course already seen an example of a joke that doesn't lose power when it is expected: the beloved buildup-punchline joke. It is only a small jump to figure out the fact that as an antijoke gets funnier when least expected, so too does buildup-punchline joke. For example, in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer\u2019s table. Surprise, like fire, is an powerful but volatile weapon, and should never be underestimated, nor relied upon.\n\nOn the topic of the relationship between antijokes and buildup-punchline jokes, it might be an idea to combine them at some point. Subversion of the reader's expectation of a buildup-punchline joke would be easy to do by omitting the punchline or otherwise altering the structure. In my opinion, this is helpful for other joke tellers, because it casts doubt on the buildup-punchline structure, which means people will expect the conclusion of proper jokes less, and thus find them funnier if the author sticks to the structure.\n\nBy the way, sorry about the wall of text.",

See the english system for naming centuries compared to other languages, e.g. The 19th century is 1800-1899 while \"19-hundreds\" in Swedish is 1900-1999!",

The 7th *chord* has a diminished 5th. And since no one can sing a chord, it's impossible to sing a mb5. And the note itself does not inherently sound horrible - it depends which chord it's played over. There are plenty of happy melodies that use the 7th note, especially as a leading tone back into the root, just like the 4th leads into the 5th.",

That whole \"the seventh note of the major scale is locrian\" and \"locrian is terrible because it has a diminished 5th\" is oversimplified at best and just plain wrong at worst. Like you said, the seventh scale degree is just the leading tone. Also, every single Greek mode has a diminished 5th, and the diminished 5th does not make them terrible. Not sure why that guy tried to make this joke musically sound using poor knowledge of music theory. ",

So, it's relatively funny if you know musical theory, because on top of the Samsung pun, the chord for \"note 7\" of the diatonic scale is, in fact, \"jarring and discordant\" as described in-joke.",

Then they heard more and again quickly issued a voucher to return or something.  Then when people heard about the 20 out of millions of phones catching on fire the public freaked out so Samsung issued a FULL REPLACEMENT policy.  Any phone, any issue, full money back.  The company did literally everything they could and for their efforts people just made fun of them more.\n\nThis kind of \"kick the person who cares\" seems to cause much of the problems in society as a whole.  The asshole who denies, denies, denies is ignored or allowed to continue with little to no harassment, and someone cleaning up a mess that isn't theirs is blamed for everything because they tried to take responsibility for something.  \n\nSorry for the rant.",

In my opinion Samsung went above and beyond to save face, and do right by their customers. What gets me the most is how people can be so harsh to a company trying to solve the problem but not think twice about buying a vehicle for instance from a company that let faulty ignition switches go for so long and having cars catch on fire with people in them driving down the road. Where are all the GM jokes? Also, didn't apple have an issue with iPhone chargers catching on fire at one point in time? I remember reading about it when I had the iPhone 4s. ",

And I'm not claiming to know how this situation worked but this is how \"suicide watch\" works generally.\n\nSuicide monitoring is based on an assessment of suicide risk performed by a healthcare professional. It can typically be initiated by police or correctional officers but requires follow up by a psychiatric nurse or psychiatrist, who is ultimately responsible for the person's care and will determine when it is safe to reduce/remove the suicide monitoring.\n\nIt is not particularly difficult for a person who is not experiencing an acute psychiatric episode to \"pass\" the assessment and have the monitoring removed. You just have to play the part of a person who doesn't want to end their life and be patient. You can't have someone on suicide watch forever in the absence of clinical justification.\n\nSo there was either some shady shit here, or he just successfully pretended to be safe.",

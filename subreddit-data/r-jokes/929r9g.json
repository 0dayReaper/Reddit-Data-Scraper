Just play along\"\n\n\"There are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.\"\n\n\"But that's not a problem\" mathematician #3 chimes in \"at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-\"\n\n\"I know how limits work\" interjects the bartender\n\n\"Oh, alright then. I didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" The bartender replies, \"you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?\"\n\n\"HE'S ON TO US\" mathematician #1 screeches\n\nSimultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.\n\nThe mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. \"FOOLS\" it booms in unison, \"I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA\"\n\nThe bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. \"But wait\" he inturrupts, thinking fast, \"if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!\"\n\nThe mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. \"My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!\" and with that, they vanish.\n\nA nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. \"How did you know that that would work?\"\n\n\"It's simple really\" the bartender says. \"I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.\"",

So if I need to get from A to B, it doesn't matter if I take a straight line or a loop around Jupiter, the end result is the same.\n- As a corollary, a closed-loop integral is zero, since I can always deform the path of my path-invariant integral into a single point, and a single-point integral is zero by definition.\n- The curl of the vector field is zero *everywhere*.\n\nThe physical interpretation is that the scalar field is potential energy, and the vector field is a force, with a caveat that **F**=-grad(V), since that way, minimum potential energy means a stable equilibrium.\n\nEdit: In a conservative field, energy is conserved and can be repeatedly turned from potential to kinetic. ie There are no effects that dissipate energy into heat, like friction.",

A **vector function** is one that takes some input and spits out a vector.  \n\nGiven that the mosquitoes were multi-coloured, their colours smoothly went from one to another, forming a **gradient** of colour.  \n\nAlso in math, a **scalar multi-variable function**, in other words, a function that takes several numbers as inputs and spits out one, has a **gradient**, which is a **vector function** describing how the scalar function changes. \n \nIn physics, **vector functions** describe things like forces in space, for example gravity and electromagnetism. If a force is **conservative**, then it can freely exchange energy between kinetic and potential - between moving and position. In other words, it **conserves** energy, without losing any.\n\nIt can be proven that if a **vector function** is a **gradient** of some definable **scalar function**, then that **vector function** must be **conservative**.  \n\nIn US politics, **conservatives** argue for greater capitalistic freedom, at the expense of civilisational institutions most of the world would consider human rights, like universal healthcare.  \n\nSince the colours of the **vectors** form a **gradient**, those mosquitoes must be **conservative**, and thus will not attack the dimension with malaria in fear of **universal healthcare** being introduced.",

                                    "comment": "Imagine you are on a perfectly slippery ice rink with no air resistance With that assumption, if you pushed off from one end of the ice rink, did a complete lap and arrived back where you started, you'd find you were going at exactly the same speed as before. You have conserved your 'kinetic energy' hence the name 'conservative field'.  \nOf course, the ice rink doesn't even need to be flat in this case; it could be slightly bumpy, but providing you never come to a complete stop or end up going backwards, you will still find that you arrive at your starting point at exactly the same speed as you started. As the saying goes, \"what goes up must come down\", so any extra speed you gain from the downhill sections is counteracted by slowing down on the uphill sections.\n\nSince you always end up going the same speed as you started you wouldn't even need to go round the whole ice rink, you could do a smaller lap, or even just stay where you are. That's like the second point mentioned above; closed loop paths can be deformed into a single point.  \n\nSimilarly, any journey from A to B will always result in the same change in speed no matter what path you take. If you take any two routes from A to B you then have a closed loop so going forwards along one route and then back down the other must result in an overall speed change of zero. Therefore since they cancel out when in opposite directions, they must be the same when going the same direction, hence all routes from A to B are equivalent. This is the first point mentioned above.\n\n*The mathematical formalism of this is that the height of the ice at any point is a scalar field (scalar means that any point can be represented by a single number, the height). Taking the gradient of this set of numbers is like covering the ice rink in lots of little arrows (called vectors). The size of each arrow tells you how steep the ice is, and its direction tells you which direction is most uphill. When someone says that a 'closed loop line integral' is zero, it just means that on your path you spend as much time going against the arrows as you do with them, which means the two effects cancel out.*\n\nFor the third point let's consider a non-conservative field:  \nImagine there are now loads of industrial fans at the side of the ice blowing the air around in a clockwise direction. In this scenario, if you went around clockwise you would get a boost from the fans and arrive back at the start going faster than before, and if you went round anticlockwise you would arrive back going slower. Here, the field is no longer conservative; different routes give different end speeds. \n\n*More formally, the addition of the fans is like adding a set of spiralling arrows to the ones used earlier. The 'curl' is an operation that tells you how much the set of arrows rotates around each point (giving a new set of arrows). If the curl is zero (so no wind) then there is no overall boost in any direction so the field is conservative. You can also see now why a closed loop contour integral wouldn't be zero; with the addition of the spiralling arrows you will spend more time going either with or against the arrows and therefore, in general, there won't be any nice cancellation*\n\n_____\n\nSo I guess to summarise the joke, if vectors form something that is the gradient of some scalar field (like the height of an ice rink) then you have a conservative field.\n\nEdit: clarified bit about equivalent routes",

Had to peruse all the comments to put 1 and 1...and 1 together to figure it out.\n\n* 1: It is a math, physics, epidemiology and politics joke.\n* 2: The first half of the joke is a modification of the original joke: An infinite number mathematicians walk into a bar. The first orders a beer. The next orders half of a beer. The next orders a quarter. The next is cut off by the bartender who hands them all two beers and says, \"Guys, know your limits.\".\n* 3: The second half of the joke was added on and is very detailed.\n* 4: The mosquitoes were referenced in a very specific way, namely, an organism intended to spread a disease (malaria). In the study of epidemiology, the mosquito is a **vector**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology).\n* 5: Also, mosquitoes arranged themselves into a form that was also referred to specifically as \"polychromatic\". Mosquitoes are one color in nature (generally), and in a swarm they are unlikely to just bunch up into a solid mass. Rather, there would be varying random amounts of space between each mosquito thus resulting in various shades of this same color (gray/black) as perceived by a human eye (that is how our computer renders different shades of gray - just a matrix of varying amounts of black pixels among white pixels. More black pixels = darker gray, more white pixels = lighter gray). In physics we would say that it is a **gradient** of the color gray/black: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polychromatic\n* 6: The mosquitoes are agents spreading disease and polychromatic, thus a gradient of vectors. In mathematics, a vector gradient is **conservative**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field. Thus the mosquitoes, when reading those terms (vector, gradient) on a piece of paper without context, are **conservative**.\n* 7: Political joke at the end. Conservative people are not known for supporting universal/free healthcare.\n\nTL;DR: A long joke that is a huge play on words that requires knowledge of various fields of study - mathematics, physics, epidemiology, and politics.",

Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!\" and with that, they vanish.\n\nA nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. \"How did you know that that would work?\"\n\n\"It's simple really\" the bartender says. \"I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.\"\n\nedit: credit to /u/pokeloly\n",

In the real world, there is no answer to the question 'What is the square root of -1?' as every number that we know of multiplied to itself is positive. So mathematicians said, 'Let's make it equal to i'. Likewise, there is no answer to the question 'What is 1+2+3+...' (as infinity isn't a number) so mathematicians decided to make it equal to -1/12 (for various reasons such as the zeta function you mentioned). In a way, when you see the equation '1+2+3+... = -1/12', the addition operations aren't the same as the ones that we use in everyday life, they're an extended form of addition which allows for originally infinite sums to have finite values (just like we extended the square root function to take in negative values). Even though both examples don't make any sense 'in the real world', by allowing them to equal something, people were able to make many developments in maths and physics and so these 'extensions' were overall beneficial to us no matter how controversial they might seem.",

                            "comment": "The best way I can explain it is that there are sums of the form 1/n^s where n is every natural number. The sum only converges to a finite number if s&gt;1 (for example 1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/4^2 ...=pi^2 /6). Anytime when s is less than or equal to 1, the series is divergent in a traditional sense.\n\nThrough the work of mathematicians like Euler and especially Riemann, a function was derived that represented the infinite sum as a function of s. Zeta(s)=the sum of the series we mentioned for any particular value of s. Interestingly s does not have to be an integer. It can be a complex number of the form a+bi where a&gt;1 (that little condition we had before). There is a branch of mathematics called analytic number theory and the idea of a topic called analytic continuation  is a portion of that field. Analytic continuation involves extending where a function is defined beyond its previous limits. Since before we were limited by the fact that a&gt;1, the one single analytic continuation of Zeta(s) allows us to evaluate it at almost any number.\nThe key disconnect now is that the Zeta function now represents something greater than the original family of series we were talking about. It is now an analytic function that does has applications but has taken a departure from the series it took its origin from. It should be noted that in analytic continuation there is only one way to continue the function such that it makes sense. I am not a mathematician so I cant tell you on the specifics on how and why, but that is what I have heard.\n\nFinally, evaluating Zeta(-1) gives - 1/12, and if you plug in - 1 for s in the series you get, 1/1^-1 + 1/2^-1 + 1/3^-1 + 1/4^-1 +... =1+2+3+4... However I would like to say that once you go past the line s=1 the function and the series represent two different things and 1+2+3+4\u2260-1/12.\n\nThere are also ways to do the series manipulation to acquire - 1/12. The numberphile videos touch on it so if you're curious you might want to check them out. They focus on not using traditional summation but more extravagant ones such as Abel sums and Cesaro summations. For example, the series 1-1+1-1+... (also known as Grandi's series) does not converge in a traditional sense because using the nth term test for divergence the limit of the sequence does not exist because the sequence fluctuates between 1 and - 1. However, using the definition of a Cesaro sum, we look as the sequence of partial summations (partial summations are the sum of the nth first numbers) and divide each partial summation by n. In our case the sequence of the partial summations of Grandi's series is {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4...}\nDividing each term by their respective n,\n{1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/5, 3/6, 4/7, 4/8...}\nTidying it up\n{1, 1/2, 2/3, 1/2, 3/5, 1/2, 4/7, 1/2...}\nBecause this sequence approaches 1/2 we can call the Cesaro summation of the series to be 1/2 which is the longer method of what the Numberphile video. I hope this was informative.\n\nDisclaimers: I am not a mathematician, I'm just a math enthusiast in high school. This was typed on a phone so forgive me for any errors. If anyone has corrections for me, I will be glad receptive. ",

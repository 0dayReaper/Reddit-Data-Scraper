There are only three words in the English language. What is the third word? Hint: The word is something that everyone uses everyday. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.\n\n&gt;Phrased this way, the answer is \"language\" because \"There are only three words in (the phrase)\u00a0'the English language'\u00a0.\"\n\n&gt;However, this joke is often mis-told by poorly phrasing the original riddle, as it is in the comic. By instead saying, \"There are three words in the English language that end in '-gry,'\" the teller of the joke has actually removed any chance of determining the correct answer.\n\n",

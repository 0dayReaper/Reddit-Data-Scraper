Does the school provide a shuttle?\n\nDo they really block certain web pages on their internet and what, if any, web pages have you tried to access that were blocked?\n\nDid you find you were awarded more scholarships sophomore year than freshman year? Seems as if there are many scholarships offered by major.",

Use reddit for that or data...  \n\nAnd you have to ask for scholarships.  I feel like it's harder to get them later on.   Be good friends with your professors and even dean if possible.  If you ask they might be able to pull strings.   But Baylor is expensive.  Don't assume you will get more scholarships and know that any university you go to, tuition raises ever semester",

You\u2019ll also probably find people who would be willing to come get you. \n\nSome sites are blocked. It\u2019s not many though. \n\nI was awarded more scholarships. You just have to hunt them down and apply.",

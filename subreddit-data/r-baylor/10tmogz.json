    "postText": "I was accepted to Baylor and received a merit scholarship of 16k/year (64k total). I also received 8k/year from a need based grant. My family toured the campus and we really loved it. We decided to pay the enrollment deposit after we decided this is where I want to go. Is there any way I can receive more aid? I will probably have to take out loans if I don\u2019t receive any more aid since my family can not afford to pay 50k/year in tuition.",

            "comment": "Hey friend, I'm going to give you the hard advice I wish I had listened to when I was in a similar position.\n\nOver four years, I took about 50k in debt, half in public and half in private loans. After Baylor, I became a public school teacher, then grad school, then the pandemic meant I didn't need to pay off my public loans. So based on 25k in private loans alone, my monthly student loan payment is just under $500. And if I only paid that, my principal would only increase, meaning I would end up owing more than I took out despite making payments.\n\nLet's imagine that through scholarships, parental contributions, and public loans, you're able to reduce your private loan total to just 25k per year. After graduating, you would likely owe close to *$2000 per month*. Even if you graduated with a great job, after rent, you would probably have less than a thousand dollars to pay for a car (easily $300 a month), food (easily $300 a month), and any sort of social life you'd like to have. And that's assuming your job provides full health insurance for free--a rarer and rarer benefit. Fingers crossed no politician is dumb enough to turn on public loan payments again! (They are.)\n\nTL;DR: The degree you get from any institution is probably not going to be worth the excruciating weight of this amount of debt. Unless you're getting substantially more scholarships, somewhere cheaper would probably be a better idea in the long term.\n\nI hope you're able to find the resources you need to make all your dreams come true. I was very lucky and worked really hard to get as many scholarships as I could, but they still weren't really enough to justify the debt I'm only now in a position to really aggressively pay off my debt, and that's really more because of my partner's (debt free because of socialism) degree.",

When I went, which was admittedly a couple years ago, the merit based capped at 20k unless you were national merit and once you got your offer, even if you did super well in your classes and tried to get it bumped up, they wouldn\u2019t change it. I did get an extra few thousand a year from departmental scholarships but I don\u2019t know if all departments are like that so I wouldn\u2019t count on it",

My year was the last year they offered it outright though, now you have to be selected amongst other national merit scholars.\n\nI still think the whole concept of national merit is ridiculous. Just because I did well on a little PSAT test I get free tuition? And schools actually care that much? Obviously not complaining but still confusing.",

You need spend a lot of time and effort looking for and applying to them, but the more you do the better. Don't give up, work hard and contact your financial aid advisor for advise. It is possible to get to that amount, just don't get into debt  Good luck.",

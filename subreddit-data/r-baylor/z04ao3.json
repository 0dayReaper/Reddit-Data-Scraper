Like any community, not everyone finds their place there and that's okay. By now I don't think I know any people still there, but it has a tradition of being one of the best-run residences on campus with a fantastic community, even if the buildings themselves aren't that good at all.",

The thesis is a lot of work, but they do try to give as many resources as people need. It's really useful for people who might get a graduate degree in the future, though.\n\nThe extra courses, though, I found to be really enjoyable. I learned a lot from Great Texts, and I think an understanding of the prevailing themes of classical and medieval literature can be surprisingly useful knowledge to have. If Great Texts sounds like something you might enjoy, then honors might be for you.\n\nCompared to BIC or University Scholars, the base Honors Program doesn't switch up a degree plan very much, so I think it comes down to if the differences sound worthwhile.",

If you find yourself hanging out with all the smart kids in high school and a bit more nerdy(not an insult, I'm a nerd haha) than your high school peers you will love being around more of your people.

The best part about it was writing a thesis, which is something I still think about often and build upon, as well as the opportunity to get really focused attention on your thinking and writing. My grad school application was much better for it.\n\nThe Honors Residential College was probably the best part of my Baylor experience. My sophomore through senior year roommate was the best man at my wedding. My community there was full of people with whom we could engage deeply on our differences, deep intellectual debates, and shoot each other with nerf guns. It was truly awesome.\n\nI can't imagine I would have stayed at Baylor if not for the HRC. I was able to build those kinds of relationships with people outside of the community, yes, but it was a lot easier with the people who lived right down the hall.",

Not a particular fan of great texts (I am premed and much prefer science) but if you\u2019re just interested in Honors Program, you will only have to take 2 semesters of great texts which is a breeze (as opposed to 3 for Uschol). Though, I have to admit, great texts is very useful. And if you choose the HRC (Memo or Alex) as your #1 preferred residence hall for your freshman year, you will definitely get in. The community at the HRC is incredible. \nThe thesis part of the honors college is the BEST part I think. You get to spend the last two ish years of your undergrad becoming an expert in something YOU love. I\u2019m part of a lab and am so excited to start thesis work. The honors program is outstanding if you are considering graduate school as well, because of the thesis.",

    "postText": "I am currently a sophomore going into my junior year next semester and I am an accounting major. I would like to switch my major to environmental science but feel like I do not have enough time left in college to do all the prerequisites for college of arts and science. So I am trying to get a minor in environmental sciences. Is your junior year too late to start a minor or not? Thank you for the help!",

Just having a minor in Environmental Science will do nothing for your career path unless you are planning on getting a Masters or Doctorate in Environmental Science. Trust me. I did the same thing thinking I was going to be an environmental lawyer.",

Meet with an advisor to map out what courses you need to take and when. \n\nThere are things I considered majoring or attempting to major in and never did because I felt like I was too far into college and it was \"too late.\" My career/life might have been really different if I had.\n\nYou might need to take classes over the summer. You might need an extra semester. You might be taking 18 hours instead of 15.\n\nIt isn't going to hurt you to try. Because I guarantee you everything in life that you don't try is just going to end up in a bucket of what-ifs that will never leave you alone.",

With that said, several things about Brittney Griner's detainment in Russia that are note-worthy\u2026\n\n&gt;Griner plays for a Russian team in the offseason and has for the past several years. Reportedly, some **3 weeks ago**, Russia detained her after allegedly finding **hash vape pens** in her luggage at the **airport.**\n\nIt would be akin to saying she was arrested in the past for _____ beliefs, when in fact, she was arrested for punching her wife.\n\nIt\u2019s a horrible time to be an American in Russian custody though. Domestic abuser aside, I hope she is safe.",

Russia being \u201cbad\u201d aside (which they are), we have a fairly no name, regional athlete/celebrity, with a checkered past, getting arrested for presumably having a controlled substance.  What part of that is news worthy?  FAR bigger names, such as Michael Phelps get arrested once, then twice, for DUI and it didn\u2019t stay in the news more than a few days.\n\nI just am curious on how much of this news was always \u201cavailable\u201d, but right now is the \u201cright time\u201d to have its run through the news cycle.",

I guarantee you if they had contacted sicem365 it would've been on their front page and given the person reporting it an interview most likely. and it would've gained minor traction from there. \n\nEither she literally has no one advocating for her on the other side, or they're astoundingly horrible at their jobs.",

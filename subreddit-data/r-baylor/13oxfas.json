He\u2019s an amazing professor and just a great guy all-around, and he\u2019ll often turn his classes into deep discussions about the world around us while also relating to the actual literature in the syllabus. Even as someone who doesn\u2019t really care much for literature or English, that class was such a welcome break from the rest of my day and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough!",

He's a very kind and grandfatherly old man, and his class was basically just reading and three essay exams. Not difficult at all as long as you take it seriously (which he will notice and appreciate).",

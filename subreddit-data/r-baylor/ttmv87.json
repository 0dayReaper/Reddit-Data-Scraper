    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI am likely going to join Baylor University, as a Pre Med, majoring in Medical Humanities. I have heard some good and bad things about the program, just wanted to know more about it, from a student's perspective.\n\nWhat are the classes like in Medical Humanities? - How are the tests, assignments and grades structured ? Would the program provide a \"cusion\" for my GPA ?\n\nI heard about how the medical humanities program can be difficult in terms of the number of essays and how they need to be extremely thoughtful and creative, is that true? Would I be able to ask for feedback from my professors and get advice on how to better improve my work before turning it in ?\n\nAlso, what might I be able to do to better prepare for the program now?\n\nSorry for asking so many questions. Thank you for all of your time in advance.",

Some are harder than others (and that all depends on the prof so check professor ratings). \n\nThe most important thing is gonna be doing well in your prereqs, so focus on those from your first semester onwards. You can change majors if you don't like MH after the first year or so",

I definitely got burnt out as a biochemistry major and was always jealous of my humanities major friend. \n\nAnother thing to consider is PA school. I know its not the same as what you currently have your sights on but it may be a better path depending your situation. Also it's easier lol",

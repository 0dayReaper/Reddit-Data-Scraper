When I went to Microsoft Word to edit some papers, there was a message at the top that said that this account did not support editing on Microsoft Word (even though I have the same account as I did on the old computer) and to contact administration about it. The club I'm a part of uses Microsoft Word exclusively to provide edits, so I do need to contact administration, but I don't know who to contact or where to look. Do I email someone from IT? Who am I supposed to contact?",

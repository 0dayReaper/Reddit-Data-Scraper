I had a bag of m&amp;ms in my room for the first few weeks and that was it. Make sure you run to H\u2011E\u2011B like first thing and stock up on snacks and things for when you can\u2019t make it to the dining hall.",

You can make most cheap food with a kettle and/or microwave. \n\nGet comfortable bedding that makes you feel at home. \n\nMost dorms have (had?) pegboards; take advantage of those. \n\nDon't pack too many shirts, you will be given a million of them.\n\nGet good toiletries that make you feel clean. Separate shampoo, conditioner, and body soap. Heavy deodorant and lots of it. A shower caddy is always a great investment. \n\nCleaning supplies, especially wet wipes and a broom. \n\nSome of those little baskets to put in your drawers to keep your clothes sorted.\n\nNotebooks and a *few* of your favorite books/games/things to share/conversation pieces.\n\nA good water bottle.\n\nA good bike.\n\nThen ask your parents to give you the money they would have spent on other stuff as a budget for you to buy after you're there and have figured out what would make life easier for you.\n\nHonestly, you won't have a ton of room for your stuff and you probably won't spend a ton of time in your dorm room. Keep it to the minimum and you'll be fine. \n\nI lived in the dorms my whole time at Baylor and it was the best part of my experience there outside of what the broader Waco/Seventh &amp; James community provided. Most of what I brought was given away or hauled back home without much use over my years there. Let there be plenty of room for new memories.",

            "comment": "BREAKFAST\n\n$$-Homestead Heritage: hidden gem of Waco. Live off the land community. Farm to table organic produce and craft goods/cheese. Amazing coffee-house on site. Make a reservation for the restaurant to avoid a long wait.\n\n$-Butter My Biscuit Cafe-hands down the best breakfast in Waco, huge portions, very friendly staff. Is also a gaming store which makes for an interesting ambiance or if you need the latest booster pack. \n\n$-Magnolia Silos Bakery: Everything else is a tourist trap but the bakery makes great stuff. Unpopular opinion: their cookies are better than the cupcakes. \u00a0\n\n\nCOFFEE/WORK\n\n$-Pinewood Coffee-best coffee in downtown Waco. Not the best to do work though.\u00a0\n\n$-Fabled-coffee and bookstore. Best seating and environment. I've spent many hours here studying/reading.\u00a0\n\n\nLOCAL FAVORITES\n\n$$-Guess Family BBQ-easily the best BBQ in Waco. Must visit.\n\n$-Jake's Texas Tea House-Southern Comfort\u00a0\n\n$$-Milo's All Day: pricy but delicious, new-American food.\u00a0\n\n$-Schmaltz's Deli-old fashioned deli, everything made in-house.\u00a0\n\n$-Health Camp: iconic burgers and great shakes\n\n$-Tru Jamaica-Best restaurant in East Waco.\n\n$-Baris: Italian-American. Great bread. Huge portions.\n\n\nALCOHOL:\n\n$-Brotherwell Brewery: award-winning microbrewery. Fun place.\n\n$-Barnett's Pub- has the largest whiskey collection in Texas! Pretty solid food as well.\n\n$$-One Day-classy cocktails. Is also next to Nexus eSports. They serve better than decent sandwiches.",

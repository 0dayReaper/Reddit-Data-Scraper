    "postText": "I'm trying to collect stories of haunted Baylor for a summer project, and as far as I'm aware, only Collins officially has a ghost. One of my coworkers at Baylor told me about the ghost of Martin, but he said it was a temporary ghost, as it wasn't haunting Martin but a particular person. A friend told me there's a ghost of Armstrong-Browning, and I heard a story about Tidwell being haunted. The common joke among people in my major is that Carroll Science is big-time haunted, but I haven't heard any stories that back that up. Does anyone know of any more fleshed-out stories of haunted Baylor? Could be the buildings I already listed or other areas on campus.",

Since it was COVID I was the only one in the building. I used the restroom down there and heard the door open and close, but no one came in. Most likely nothing but it creeped me out.",

My older sister and her roommates saw their shoes flying around in their room as well as some spooky girl running down the hallway (that wasn\u2019t them). My boyfriend and his roommates would have constant nightmares about ghosts whenever they lived there and would sometimes wake up feeling like they were being smothered or choked. A friend of mine said doors would randomly close and faucets would randomly turn on when no one was home. Whenever I visited though- there were a few times I felt inexplicably unsettled but never actually saw anything",

One day I was sick in my room and my roommate came into the apartment for a minute, then knocked on my door and asked me if I had just seen our other roommate. I said no, and he said he came into his room and someone ran out of our roommates room behind him and went out the door. We called our roommate and he said he\u2019d been gone all day. I\u2019d been locked in the apartment by myself all day and would have heard someone come in. We never figured it out, we thought we were haunted lol!",

That doesn\u2019t sound too far off from the stuff I\u2019ve heard of from uparks, there was one time my boyfriend\u2019s car which parked outside of building 4, randomly had a bunch of handprints the size of a kid\u2019s from the inside of the trunk appear overnight. He wiped it clean and we were very confused and the next day they were there again (after parked outside of building 4). Needless to say he was very happy to get rid of that car when the time came",

While there is a ghost of a female there, she is actually really sweet and helpful. I remember on multiple occasions getting back to the elevator after a long day and the doors opening automatically in front of me without any buttons being pressed. You could also feel her presence and it was comforting so no one living there ever had any problems with her, and I actually enjoyed having her around.",

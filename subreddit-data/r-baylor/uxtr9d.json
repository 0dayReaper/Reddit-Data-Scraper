If memory serves you can get in to some of the tunnels from that drainage tunnel.\n\nAlso, you can get underneath the fountains in front of the BSB. We crawled in the drainage pipe underneath the footbridge over the creek between the BSB and the music parking lot. They may have put in a locked grate, but you can just lift up the metal drain grate around the fountain itself. There's a ladder that goes into the water reservoir.\n\nThere were rumors of old rooms in Old Main that would let you climb up to the bell tower areas. Pretty sure the Noze Bros did it a few times for pranks.",

It comes with some very negative consequences.",

I know as recently as '12 at least some were still in use.  No idea now.\n\nAlso, used to be super easy to get on the roof of Tidwell. The slant after the roof entrance is pretty steep though so careful. \n\nOn a semi- related note,  the two Honor's College dorms are/were connected underground by a series of hallways and rooms. Anyone know what they kept down there when guys/girls in the honors colleges already had full access to the 1st floor/ basement of the dorms? It's kept me up one too many nights lol",

If you make your way all the way through the crawl space you can access the basement where an armory used to be located. This requires going through the small maintenance doors on the stairwells as you enter either building from the covered area that connects the two.\n\nThere is also an old NoZe brother hideout at the top of Old Main, and a creepy room in Tidwell with a lot of random painting on the walls referring to it as \u201cthe Upper Room.\u201d",

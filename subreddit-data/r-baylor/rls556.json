I loved that course, and if he teaches it anything like he did when I had him a couple of years ago, a 79 should be an A. He specifically curves it so that you\u2019re more focused on learning and less on grades.\n\nIt was that class that inspired me to be a journalism major. It wasn\u2019t the right fit, but when I talked to Darden in office hours and mentioned this, he encouraged me to major in professional writing. Two years later, and it was the perfect fit for me. Great guy, love him to death. Tell him I said hi",

He\u2019s also a big name in economic research pertaining to sex work. I really regret not discovering how well-known he is until I\u2019d been out of his class for a few years, since he\u2019s actually pretty low-key in person.",

    "postText": "Any chance of getting any sort of scholarships for a second bachelor\u2019s degree? Specifically the hybrid nursing program. \nI had a 3.7 undergraduate GPA (biology) and 3.9 graduate GPA (master of education). I\u2019m looking for a career change and Baylor would be the fastest route (12 months). However, it\u2019s so expensive; $70k total for 1 year. Any advice would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "If you already have a degree, there are much faster and cheaper programs out there that will get you your nursing license. Most nurses work and go to school at the same time once they get their license. There are specifically accelerated programs for people that have degrees.",

Baylor is the only one that won\u2019t force me to retake classes and accepts my old HESI test scores. I do agree there are cheaper options, but not faster ones. Baylor would save me a year of retaking classes",

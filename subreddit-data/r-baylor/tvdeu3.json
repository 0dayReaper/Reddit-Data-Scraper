    "postText": "So, if we're going to get something up, it needs to be a group of us all going in at once so we can create a real block before it gets wiped out, and that's just too hard to coordinate with asynchronous Reddit posts. Otherwise, it just looks like one person trying to vandalize a flag with random dots.\n\nThe most commonly suggested location (with the blessing of the Iowa State group) has been (1654, 621) next to the Iowa State logo on top of the current asexual flag. They have plenty of room so we should be able to carve out a spot; just need to get a real chunk on there before it gets wiped out.\n\nIf we can get that spot, this logo design has been proposed earlier on this sub (should fit that exact spot) and universally applauded: https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/tuu0sc/proposed_rplace_baylor_logo_should_fit_alongside/\n\nI'm making a temporary Discord server so we can have live communication and pings. Join if you're interested, and we can launch a coordinated movement this afternoon: https://discord.gg/qXxNvEnb",

It\u2019ll make it easier to create and defend with our limited numbers.\n\nI made this last night which is heavily based on the one you linked, but it\u2019s roughly half the pixels of it (12x12): https://imgur.com/a/8HRLhgb",

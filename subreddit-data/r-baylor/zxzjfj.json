I think because I applied later since I didn\u2019t know about it, so I would try to apply as soon as you can. They had online options for us in 2021 and my friends had no problems. Basically a zoom call I think",

It was probably because you applied after EA deadline, or your standardized test score but based on the fact you\u2019re 3rd in your class I doubt it\u2019s that.",

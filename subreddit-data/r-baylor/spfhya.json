    "postText": "Hi all,\nWanted to put this idea out there for all current Hankamer students (and recently former) to get your thoughts - I'm curious to gauge what level of interest there might be across business school students (especially those majoring in finance, accounting or anything related to investment banking) in having a student-managed, dedicated crypto investment fund that sits alongside the existing traditional investment fund managed out of the Hankamer investment center currently (which I think launched sometime in the early 00's)?\n\nI also am curious how much of the discussion in finance or accounting classes, if any, is starting to involve crypto news, related banking regulations, tax law changes, etc, whether led by students or professors.",

I honestly doubt even most of the professors know enough about it to open a portfolio. Finance? Could be a whole different story, but definetly no professors in the Accounting department have brought it up",

I\u2019ve heard of large accounting firms (KPMG) starting to put more money into crypto assets (BTC and ETH primarily), but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll find its way onto assessments for awhile",

            "comment": "Accounting and finance major, also took the student managed portfolio class. Don\u2019t think a crypto specific fund will ever be launched as a class, but this could possibly be a club that\u2019s affiliated with Baylor. Just don\u2019t know how it would work because the student managed fund uses a portion of the university\u2019s endowment and they have to make withdrawals every year/semester for scholarships and with volatility in crypto I don\u2019t know if baylor would sign on to that. If you\u2019re interested I would talk to David Morehead; I believe he\u2019s the head guy for Baylor\u2019s endowment and helps run the student managed fund/class. Brandon Troegle also helps run the class and is certified in alternative investments (CAIA I believe).\n\nI\u2019m sure there would be some degree of interest in the student body, but this seems like something that would take a year or two to set up. Also don\u2019t know if alumni donations would specifically have to donate to something like this. \n\nThe student managed fund is also heavy on teaching students the fundamentals on how to analyze stocks/industries/market tailwinds. For example you have to make some fairly long presentations and put together ~15 page research paper on a stock. I\u2019m not huge into crypto, but what would be the comparable learning aspect for it? That\u2019s why I believe it will never be a class, but possibly some type of org. \n\nAlso to the other comment the fund isn\u2019t managed by fellows; anyone can apply. And I\u2019m about to start the Masters of Accounting program and don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever talked about crypto; maybe spent 30 mins on the blockchain.",

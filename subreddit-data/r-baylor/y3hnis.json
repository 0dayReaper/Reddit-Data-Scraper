There are games that you lose and they're still fun to watch. There are games that you play well and just don't come out on top. This was a game that just hurt. Baylor just looked like trash tonight, there's no  sugar coating it. \n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** For the second week in a row, it's fundamentals. Baylor looked sloppy in every way tonight. Turnovers, tackling, coverage, you name it, Baylor had room to improve.\t\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Kyron Drones. After Shapen went down with a likely concussion due to one of the dirtiest hits I've seen in a long time, Drones came out and showed he had no nerves at all. He made some fantastic passes and finished the game 7-14 for 95 yds and a TD, with one interception.\n * *Defense:* Dillon Doyle was a lone bright spot on the defense tonight. 10 total tackles and an interception was by far the best defensive performance we saw. \n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* This is an easy one. Shapen's 39-yard touchdown pass to Sqwirl Williams was a beautifully executed play, and swung momentum in Baylor's favor (at the time). \n * *Defense:* Dillon Doyle's 4th quarter INT to take the ball back just after WVU took it away was a similar momentum swing. Easily the most impressive defensive play on the night.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** I don't know what happened between last season and this one, but Baylor's a different team. There's just not as much discipline, confidence, and attention to detail as there was, and it shows. This is the second game running that Baylor has just looked lost, and made a mediocre opponent look like superstars. And it's the second game running that Baylor could easily have taken, had they not shot themselves in the foot multiple times. \n\n* **Next Week:** Baylor has a Homecoming game against the Jayhawks, who have been absolutely impressive to start the season. The Bears will look to end their losing streak against what is easily one of the best teams in the nation thus far. \n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** For the second time this season, we have no pickem winner! We will pick two winners next week.\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add? Comments? Concerns? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks, and sic' em Bears!*",

The Special Teams are still poor, the defense has actually *regressed* after the bye-week. The offense looks better, but they turn the ball over at crucial moments, and give our opponents life. \n\nThis is *not* a good team! All of the games from here on out will be brutal. I don't even trust us to beat OU! Last year's team was mentally and physically tough. This year's team is very, very soft.\n\nThe season is over. At this point, it should be about getting as many reps in for the younger guys as possible. The seniors haven't shown any fire.",

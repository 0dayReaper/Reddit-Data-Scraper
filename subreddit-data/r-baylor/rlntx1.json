    "postText": "So I am taking genes and development (BIO 4308 and BIO 4108) next semester. I heard it\u2019s a very hard course. I want to see some of the curriculum so I know what I\u2019m getting myself into. Can someone tell me the textbook that is used or give me some study material? \n\nAlso, does anyone know what exactly we do in lab for this course?",

The lab is fun and you get to publish your research to the undergraduate journal. It\u2019s more of like a formal poster present at the end (not in front of the class, but at the undergrad research showcase).",

            "comment": "the class is really not as hard as people say it is so long as you go to lecture and actually pay attention. like lee said, test questions are mainly pulled from lecture and lecture slides and not the text. when dr. lee draws diagrams on the board or uses drawings to explain pathways/processes, pay attention and take detailed notes on these \u201cstories\u201d and processes, this is where a lot of his questions focus. lab is fun and not super demanding and you get out of it what you put in. if you\u2019re interested in getting involved in undergraduate research, showing leadership skills, showing up for office hours, and taking initiative in lab is a great way to get offered an RA position after the semester ends. feel free PM me if you have more questions or want any more tips, i\u2019m happy to help :)",

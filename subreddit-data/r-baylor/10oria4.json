I went when the Goebel was still around, not sure if it is still. It was through an internship at Baylor, I got my current career. Recommend doing environmental science over studies if doing a science intensive field. That seriously is my one regret. With environmental studies, though you can dual major into other degrees, which i highly recommend. The options when I was looking were Political Science, Earth Science, and Geography. What specific career did you have in mind? Ask me anything.\n\nEdit- I see you want to go to law school. Highly recommend doing classes you can get a 4.0 in. GPA is paramount.",

I have also worked for one of the department's professors for the past three years in his research lab. Most of the faculty here are really wonderful and great mentors. The program is small but there's a good variety of potential coursework to take for sure. If you're looking at law school and want a 4.0 I would potentially recommend doing environmental studies rather than environmental science. The environmental chemistry course is definitely kinda rough and generally has to have a massive curve although I have a friend who is environmental science and pre-law and she made a good enough of a GPA to get accepted into law school. It just really depends on how much 'hard science' you personally want to do. I would also say that Baylor's ENV program is definitely less science and more environment in general. I definitely do not regret my decision to go the environmental science route as it has prepared me better for graduate school.\n\nAll this to say it is definitely a smaller environmental program but the faculty are great and there is excellent research being done here if you are interested in getting involved in that.",

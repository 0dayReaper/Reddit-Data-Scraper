Almost all of her undergrad classes were taught by teaching assistants or adjunct faculties, except for a few senior level classes. She had mixed experiences with the TAs as they had different teaching skill levels. At Baylor, most all of my classes were taught by a professor and I loved all of them.",

Baylor aggressively hands out scholarships and many people, especially those who have financial need, get pretty sweet deals to come here. Personally speaking, I got a 75% scholarship for my MBA program. \n\nI can\u2019t speak for those who pay \u201csticker price\u201d to come here. There\u2019s almost no real reason to pay tens of thousands more to come to Baylor vs. another Texas public school. Any perceived differences in class size, Christian values, sports, etc. are not worth the amount of money Baylor requires without aid in my opinion.",

Waco and Austin are vastly different when it comes to rent, transportation, and entertainment costs. That might not be as true anymore simply because Waco is growing a lot, but living in Waco is still quite a bit cheaper than Austin.",

Rent is the most obvious gap, but a night out doing the same things like dinner at a decent (but not upscale) restaurant and maybe a movie or a couple drinks after will run you about 30% more. It\u2019s getting out of control down there.",

And that is the case for basically any private university that's not Harvard or Yale or Princeton (which you likely wouldn't be paying sticker price for anyway unless you came from a really wealthy family).",

The professors are great and really cared about me. I got a scholarship and therefore the cost differential was not a huge dealbreaker for me. Without financial aid, the experience would not be worth the price. UT and A&amp;M for example are ranked higher than Baylor in many categories and offer a great education for in-state pricing.",

            "comment": "I'm currently a PhD student at Baylor and did my undergrad at a similar sized state school. I think the difference largely comes down to whether you will take advantage of the additional resources Baylor provides. My undergrad had tutoring and office hours but not to the level Baylor has, Baylor also has SI and advisors who are much more involved. Baylor also has an attendance policy. At my undergrad I had classes I showed up to 3 times all semester (syllabus week, midterm, and final), you will never find that at Baylor, for better or worse.\n\nIf you are someone who is motivated and will seek out all of the academic resources Baylor provides then you will get more bang for your buck than you will at state schools. If you are someone who's not going to take advantage of office hours/SI/Tutoring/advising/etc. and the only social club you plan on joining is greek life, then you're better off going to state school for cheaper.",

If you invest anywhere, you will get many of the benefits you could get at Baylor, but it all depends on what you put into getting what you want out of the experience. You have many good options, just don't make the mistake I did and think that fate was leading you somewhere that doesn't make financial sense. And I had really, really good scholarships.",

            "comment": "Thanks for all the great comments everyone.  Several stated they received scholarships that made the cost the same as a state school or close enough that it didn't matter.  I pulled the costs from the websites and Baylor is 52 tuition + 14 room/board = 66K/year.  UT is 14 tuition + 13 room/board = 27K/year.  So that would mean scholarships of around 40K per year to get the cost about the same?  Would that level of scholarship be only for very elite level students which are only given to a few?  Or is that level pretty common?  On another reddit post I was seeing what looked like pretty strong students with high GPAs, test scores, AP, etc getting 16 to 19K per year.  Which would mean with aid Baylor would be about 21 to 24K per year more?  Sound about right?",

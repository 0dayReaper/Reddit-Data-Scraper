But I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll let you walk in with your own.",

They can be rented for $50 for the entire season, or for individual games.\n\n\n&gt;CHAIRBACK SEATS AND SEAT CUSHIONS (PORTABLE):  \nPolicy: **Portable chairbacks and seat cushions will not be allowed in McLane Stadium**, however, fans may rent chairs from IMG College Seating for the season at www.BUBearChairs.com or on game day at locations throughout the stadium.  \nReason: Wide chairback seats overlap into the seat of the fan next to you &amp; many encroach into the legroom of the fan behind you. The guest relations staff at Floyd Casey Stadium frequently was contacted with this complaint. The chairbacks and cushions available from IMG College Seating are customized for the benches at McLane Stadium.\n\n&gt;CHAIRBACKS  \nThrough IMG College Seating, fans can reserve a Baylor Bear Chair prior to the season and have it installed for the entire year for $50. IMG College Seating will have locations throughout McLane Stadium behind sections 100, 124 &amp; 215a for customer service &amp; single-game rentals. For information on the Baylor Bear Chairs, go online at BuBearChairs.com or call 1-844-359-2293.\n\n\n- [source](https://baylorbears.com/sports/2018/5/16/facilities-mclane-html.aspx)\n\n\n* and Baylor wants their cut of the profits",

    "postText": "#What's going on?\n\nA recent reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam free.\n\n#What's the plan?\n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\n#What can *you* do?\n\n1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site; message /u/reddit; submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new); comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app.\n\n2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at /r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\n3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th - instead, take to your favorite *non*-reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting as this may be, threats, profanity, and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",

Apollo was never about \u201cmaking money\u201d.  It\u2019s free, ad-less, and very far from a true business as most 3rd party apps are. While on a smaller scale than Reddit, 3rd party apps also cost money to maintain as well. Additionally the margins on the API pricing are ridiculous to a point of \u201cit\u2019s a business\u201d is a poor excuse as many have voiced.  It doesn\u2019t cost anywhere near 20 million a month to run and maintain servers for the amount of users apollo has.  You could probably throw an additional 100% on top of whatever at-cost is and you\u2019d still be significantly below Reddit\u2019s planned price. \n\n\u201cGood\u201d business would have been to meet in the \u201cmiddle\u201d.  Force 3rd party apps to run Reddit\u2019s ads and/or charge a little for the api.",

    "postText": "I have what might be mold in my bathroom, and I\u2019ve had it for two days. Prolonged exposure to mold has landed me in urgent care before, so it\u2019s pretty important. Most likely, I\u2019m going to just use some bleach or hydrogen peroxide. BUT, I want to make sure this hasn\u2019t spread to say, the internal mechanisms in my sink. \nDespite being a Level 2 \u201cUrgent\u201d Work Order, it hasn\u2019t been filled. Is there a reason why? Usually Work Orders get responded to really quickly.",

In my experience work orders can take a little bit of time but getting others involved may help. Sorry you're having this issue. Bring up the urgent care history to your CL too, it will help get things done faster",

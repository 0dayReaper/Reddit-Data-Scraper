KKG\n\nPeople's Choice (as voted over 5 nights)- please correct me if I am wrong it was LATE\n\nBest Vocals - Chi O\nBest Backdrop - Tridelt\nBest Costumes - Tridelt\nBest Music - Kappa Sig\nBest Theme - KOT\nBest Choreography - KKG\n\nHot Takes....\n\nAnybody think Zeta was robbed?!?! Not even pigskin or placing?!?!\n\nPerhaps KOT had the best backdrop with the 3D home.  Pi Phi and Phi Kapp was great too with gold rush mountains. Chi Os was good as well with greek relief.  Tridelts was impressive. Um ADPi had no backdrop?!\n\nImpressive, new, and creative themes were KOT (gnomes), Alpha Phi (fairy godmother training), Chi O (greek medusa), Sing Alliance (clue), and Kappa Sig (barber shop sing off). Theta, if only you added in aliens to break up astronauts, could have been amazing. \n\nZeta had phenom costumes w birds, explorers, and parrots. Alpha phi - hopefully they can redesign theirs bc not a lot of support for bigger chested gals.  KKG - LOVE the black legging, red shoe gals.  Tridelt lobsters were lovable and I wanted more sharks and starfish!\n\nMusic - so many amazing performances I don't even know where to start. ChiOs opening was great. KOT so many good numbers.  Alpha Phi 'oops I did it again was cute.' Too many to list. There was a girl that rapped, she was wearing gold for Zeta if I am not mistaken.",

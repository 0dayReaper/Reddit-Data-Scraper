But it wasn\u2019t a good fit academically for me and that\u2019s what you go to school for, so if the other program is better for you, do it. Waco is not a far drive, and Waco is boring, you\u2019ll likely have many friends wanting to visit on weekends.",

You will find friends at UT but I will say that you\u2019re gonna have to \u201cput yourself out there\u201d more because it\u2019s a big university and you\u2019re a needle in a haystack. Even Baylor professors make the effort to say \u201chey, take this time to talk to a person next to them and get their contact info\u201d. That\u2019s all from what I\u2019ve heard, but I wish you the best on your academic journey!",

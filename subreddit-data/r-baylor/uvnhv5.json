It's smaller than the other halls so you tend to know more people and it's a bit more chill. I'm a guy, but I made a ton of friends here who are girls and who all hung out together without partying.",

While Penland was better, both had similar demographics and types of people \u2014 most were the stereotypical party people. I have heard the Russell dorms are much better. Though that is just what I have heard. I would 100% do South Russell.",

                            "comment": "I\u2019m going to be honest, overall, I wasn\u2019t too fond of Kokernot. The community bathroom was terrible. Four toilets for 30 or so girls. Some girls are absolutely disgusting, not flushing, leaving toilet paper/feminine products .... There were bugs in our bathroom too. I had to bring disinfectant wipes with me every time I went to the bathroom and wipe everything down before I used it. There might have been mold too. Still, I managed. it\u2019s not impossible and if it\u2019s your only option, then I think you can manage too (Kokernot is better than Collins btw).The showers were pretty nice though, they had hot water all day. \nWould also recommend getting a loud fan if you don\u2019t like noise, the rooms have bad insulation. I think all of the dorms on campus do. \n\nThere were two things that made me stay in Kokernot and not transfer out after the fall semester. The first was a good roommate. We weren\u2019t the best of friends but she respected the time I wanted to go to bed and was very nice to me. The second was that my room was comfortable and cozy. It\u2019s a small room, but if you get a nice mattress pad, a few blankets, and a fuzzy carpet, it will feel like a nice, cozy home. If you raise your bed all the way you can make a nice little lounge area underneath your bed (I had a small beanbag, pillows, snacks, and a fluffy carpet). Those were the reasons why I stayed. It was very very very comfortable. \n\nI think every dorm has its drawbacks and benefits so just know whatever choice you have, it\u2019s gonna have pros and cons. I only could choose Kokernot or Collins, so that\u2019s why I ended up there. However, I was able to get through it! If you are living in Kokernot, you definitely can too. (Sorry this was long there\u2019s just a lot that I thought about)",

He is a registered sex offender, and has been for over a decade. Chi Alpha knew this, and continued to work with him regardless.\n\nThey weren\u2019t official Baylor employees, but it\u2019s under scrutiny how involved they actually were in practice, as well as how much each of the colleges may have known about the situation",

He likely just made it up to defend himself",

Savala, a leader for chi alpha in Texas, was convicted in 2013 for molesting boys at a church. He has been allowed to continue to be involved in Chi Alpha throughout Texas. He has been involved in chapters at Baylor, A&amp;M, UT Rice, UTSA and A&amp;M Corpus Christi. At this point, 3 Texas chi alpha leaders have been arrested for abusing underage boys together. All of them know each other and molested boys together. Many of them worked together at A&amp;M Corpus Christi but have spread out to campuses around the state.\n\nHundl founded and led the Baylor chapter of chi alpha. He has been arrested for molesting 2 of his sons in a sauna accompanied by Savala. There are also allegations from male college students that they were pressured into sexual situations.\n\nThe Assemblies of God have allowed their college ministry to be used for underage sex trafficking across Texas. Savala has been a convicted sex offender for 10 years. They should never have allowed him to be involved.",

What are all of your suggestions:\n\n\\- Which has best connectivity across campus \n\n\\- Which is most affordable - any deals to know about before making the purchase\n\nAlso is there any way to save money on stuff typical freshman may buy for university",

            "comment": "Any major cell provider should be fine. Verizon, AT&amp;T, TMobile, etc- there\u2019s not really a comparison to be made regarding reception that I\u2019m aware of, they probably use the same towers and hardware anyways. As to deals, I\u2019d honestly just do some personal shopping around. I\u2019d go through and research what all each provider offers at different price points &amp; figure out what system/perks look the best to you- what may be a deal to someone else might not really make sense or matter for you. Many companies in general also provide student discounts or student accounts with discounted rates for their services, and they may or may not be a solid deal depending on data offered/plan features (they almost always are in other fields, I\u2019ve never looked into phone plans though) \n\nAs an addendum, we\u2019ve also got a pretty solid campus wifi, AirBear, which is free and rolled out into all classroom spaces &amp; dorms (and currently undergoing some upgrades as well!). Heck, I can get decent connectivity on fountain mall sometimes from the neighboring buildings.\n\nAs to freshman things? You should definitely not under no circumstances ever in the history of ever (wink) access the website https://z-lib.org/ because the \u201cbooks\u201d section of that website definitely does not have like 75% of the textbooks &amp; manuals you\u2019ll ever need to buy for your classes.\n\nAlso make sure to inform your friends to absolutely never access the books section of that site for the same reasons. :)\n\nLast but not least, welcome to Baylor!",

Has all kinds of books, the major drawback is that sometimes it only has older versions but that usually doesn\u2019t change much in content in textbooks.",

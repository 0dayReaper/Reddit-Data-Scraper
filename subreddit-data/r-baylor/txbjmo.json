            "comment": "The meal plans (as well as the dining options!) have drastically changed since my days at Baylor, but I think the general consensus stands: do one of the middle plans, unless you are just a heavy food consumer. The only people I remember taking full advantage of the full plans were those who were big gym rats, biking to Cameron Park 10 times a week, playing heavy b-ball at Russell Gym (shout out for the old school alum!), etc. Otherwise I just don\u2019t know if you can eat that much food!\n\nIf you\u2019re in the dorm, weekends typically are when people will venture off campus more for food than during the week. Our kiddo is at Texas Tech now and that held for her when she lived on campus as well.\n\nWhen I was there in the early 90s, doing the 2 meals-a-day plan + one on Saturday (cafeterias were closed on Sunday, IIRC) was more than enough. My roommate had a grilled cheese sandwich maker and we kept sandwich supplies around to supplement. It was a bit cheaper that way.\n\nBut if you\u2019re on full scholarship or have no issues with finances, I suppose you could just go big or go home!",

Same goes for Tech (my wife went there so has the comparison knowledge). So maybe colleges have upped their game. I wouldn\u2019t say what I had back in the day was abjectly terrible, but what exists now is leaps and bounds better.\n\nI would say if you work out and are looking for opportunities to load up on protein + have opportunities to carb load, then you\u2019d want one of the top 2 plans. That said, I don\u2019t know what the dining dollars work for and what those blocks mean on the other plans. I\u2019ll let someone with more current knowledge respond there.\n\nIf you can use those dining dollars at some places off campus + supplement with your own money for food, it will probably be fine doing the 5-day plan or maybe one below.",

Last semester I only had 5-day, this semester I have 7-day. You can swipe as many times as you want at any dining hall as long as the swipes are 15 minutes apart.\nI personally have the weekend plan this semester as a backup in case I don\u2019t feel like cooking. I don\u2019t like how it has less dining dollars so I\u2019ll probably go back to the 5-day unlimited next semester, finances impending",

The 7 day plan is *not worth it* under any conditions. \n- On the weekends, Penland (the worst dining hall in my opinion) is basically the only one open, and they have limited hours. \n- On the weekends, you cannot get breakfast until 10:45am, and even still, there are LIMITED options as it\u2019s considered brunch. \n- On the weekends, East Village is open for dinner on Sundays ONLY\u2026 Brooks is open for Sunday dinner if you live in Brooks.\n\n- Spend the extra money you\u2019d be spending on a weekend meal plan on groceries, dining dollars, or dining out. It\u2019s almost $1,000 more to add two days to your meal plan\u2026 not worth it at all!! \n\n- You only get $150 dining dollars with the 7-day plan, but you get $200 dining dollars with the 5-day plan. \n\n- If you\u2019re going to be an upperclassman, depending on your finances/scholarships, I recommend sticking with the 5 day unlimited plan. Good if you happen to be in a rush or don\u2019t have money to pay for food/groceries. Otherwise any of the block plans are probably fine!",

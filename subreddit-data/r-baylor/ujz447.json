I enjoy the extra cash every two weeks, but you can only work 40 hours every pay period so the most you can make is to 290 from 40 hours every week. I work at a front desk for a dorm and it\u2019s literally the easiest job ever so I think it\u2019s worth it",

After they\u2019re done with those foundational courses, they\u2019ll join the crew for the technical discipline they\u2019re most interested in. To keep more talented or skilled students on-hand more, each of the three workshops will hire some students as work-studies, who work 3~4 crew sessions per week. There are always one or two work-study spots per shop that open up every year, so a promising student with a particular crew (scenic/costume/lighting) will usually apply after a semester or two of doing crew time for credit and picking up the skills.\n\nEach of the three shops has one or two positions that make a little more and are for a more particular skill than general carpentry, stitching/draping, or electrics work; those positions are generally ones occupied by people with fairly advanced skill and some professional experience. The costume shop has one work-study who focuses on makeup, and that job was their higher-pay role back when I was there (through 2017); the contact for that would be [Erin](https://www.baylor.edu/theatre/index.php?id=954065), the costume shop manager. I don\u2019t know Erin personally, but my fiancee worked for her as an undergrad, and has nothing but rave reviews about Erin\u2019s professionalism.\n\nFair warning: they required taking the corresponding \u201celements\u201d class before taking any work-study position with the department, just so they were comfortable with your foundations, so they\u2019ll probably want your daughter to take the Makeup Elements class before potentially hiring her. This may be a good time to take a shot at it, though, since the longtime professor of makeup design and practice just retired about two weeks ago, and the new supervisor/professor will probably want to shake things up and do things their way. \n\nWorking for the Theatre department is great, it\u2019s operationally diverged from most departments at Baylor in that it does double duty as a teaching department and essentially a professional LORT theatre serving the cen-Tex region, but where the staff designers do 60~70% of their time as teaching faculty and 30~40% as professional designers (they\u2019re also all required to remain professionally active, so they stay active in DFW/Austin).",

The rest of the time you\u2019re biking around campus to help troubleshoot and fix tech related issues for various professors and faculty, maybe install or uninstall some hardware and put it in storage. Great way to meet some really important people. Also get to see a lot of campus you would never get a chance to see in your major (genuinely surprised by how many libraries we have on campus).\n\nIt paid closer to $10 an hour and it was the absolute best student worker job you could ask for. Genuinely decent work experience if you\u2019re in any sort of Tech-related degree, too. You\u2019d see a lot of MIS and CS students take the jobs, but it\u2019s not a requirement by any means.",

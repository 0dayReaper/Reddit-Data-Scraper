I literally have no chem experience that I remember (not sure I even have to take that but just curious)\nCan they deny you entry to the program? Or just place you in remedial classes?",

It\u2019s more so designed to place you into more advanced classes if needed. \n\nI would not worry about it at all and just take the intro to ALL classes. Start your college experience light and strong with good grades to start",

It would be much cheaper than the equivalent course at Baylor and it would save you the hours. \n\nWe look forward to having you, Body Shotz For Days lol",

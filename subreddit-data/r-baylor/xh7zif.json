Please list both pros and cons!  I am a sophomore and it would be better to get outside opinions instead of just accepting every club's sales pitch! I think this question can help other current and incoming students!",

Talk to the folks.That feeling is something you're not gonna find as a part of their sales pitch during short-stop events like Late Night, and it'll drive the decision to join.\n\nAlso realize that 'joining' a club could be as simple as joining their mailing lists and going to a few events a semester. Some clubs have extremely lax requirements, some are more involved.\n\nBaylor is so much better with extracurriculars! I highly recommend everyone join at least one major related and one non-major related club. Great way to meet new people and set yourself up for success through later on.",

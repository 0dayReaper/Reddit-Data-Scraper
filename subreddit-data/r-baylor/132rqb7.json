The issue with the Baylor gym is they have the disinfecting wipes and paper towels but still require you to have a towel with you. If they provided nothing to clean the equipment with then yes of course require a personal towel, but requiring a towel when they already have cleaning products available seems redundant. And if you sweat alot, you could grab a bunch of paper towels right there at the gym to just wipe yourself as you go. I think if people want to bring a personal towel that\u2019s fine, but it seems odd that it\u2019s a requirement or else they kick you out.",

I have no idea what to expect scholarship wise. I also chose not to show SAT scores!",

            "comment": "If you're applying as a transfer student, that changes scholarship opportunities substantially. You would only need to attend for two years (if Baylor accepts all the credits), so you should take that into account wherever you go. Unless Baylor is your top school, get your financial offer before you invest money in flying down.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the calculation you need to make is not how much money they offer you, but instead the cost of attendance minus the scholarship package (not counting loans). Even though public schools will offer you less, the overall cost there will likely be lower.\n\nImo, Baylor is not the place to finish your degree if you already have an associates. I came in within enough credits to be a junior (alongside one of my roommates), but I was still there for three and a half years.",

If I had realized my degree would only get me a salary three times my student loan payment, I probably would not have gone to Baylor. And only I paid the equivalent of 25% of the (then a third lower) COA.",

If Baylor is your top choice, wait for the letter and then fly down to see it. It was probably worth the 50k I spent to be there, learn a bunch about myself and my interests, meet a lot of cool intellectual heroes, get the connections that got me into graduate school, find the church that made me feel at home, and sent me to Europe (mostly) for free where I met my wife. But if it was to cost me double that, I wouldn't be able to afford to keep up with my student debt repayments and my life would be unimaginably difficult. \n\nTL;DR: If you have to take out loans for anywhere close to 25k in your first year, it isn't worth it.",

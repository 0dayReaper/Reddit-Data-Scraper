It gets a little more complicated if you're in a field that you know will require a graduate school degree, but the basic principle remains the same: do the math on whether you will be able to pay it off in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nIf you don't have at least a pretty good idea of what your post-college career will look like, then don't take out heavy (&gt;40k or so) loans at all.\n\nThere are cases in which Baylor is worth 80k. There are cases in which Baylor would not be worth $40k. Your outcomes in life will ultimately be determined by your major and how well you individually perform, not by the name on your degree. Everyone not on a heavy amount of drugs would agree that Baylor is a \"better\" school than, say, Texas State or UTSA, or even than a major state school like Texas Tech, but a software engineering graduate from those schools will make significantly more money after school than a social work graduate from Baylor.",

Then once you have all of that information you can do a direct comparison and make a better informed decision. \n\nPlease think long and hard before going into extreme debt for any school. Many of the opportunities that our parents had no longer exist, and the assumption that a college degree is always a good investment no matter the cost is no longer valid.",

In the end the quality of the student trumps everything if you are willing to work hard. A lower ranked school might make it a bit harder but far from impossible.

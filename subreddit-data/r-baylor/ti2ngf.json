It is disappointing to see the team exit early this year, however its also incredibly encouraging to see them finish top 5 in the AP poll 3 seasons in a row. \n\nthat is insane momentum for a program like this and the type that can change the national perception significantly. \n\nbetween that and the new stadium in 2023 this program has nothing but potential and has a great chance of staying in the top tier of mens Bball",

Pair that with getting healthy and Baylor will definitely still be considered a top team. Its a shame we're probably losing Sochan and Brown to the league though, I don't think we have a great replacement for them.",

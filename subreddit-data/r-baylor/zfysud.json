Plus, the fact that she traded for so quickly when Whelan is coming up on his 4th year is pretty shitty. This is a socially motivated play at best. The vast majority of Americans didn\u2019t care about political prisoners until Griner was arrested\n\nEdit: also, what an insult to anyone who is or has been in prison for possession charges. Federal government won\u2019t legalize marijuana or expunge those records, but will give \u201cThe Merchant of Death\u201d back for Brittney Griner",

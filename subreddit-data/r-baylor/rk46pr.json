I would highly recommend you take it at MCC.\n\nDana Gwynn is a polarizing professor. I\u2019ve heard a couple of people talk about how they like her and many people talk about how they don\u2019t.",

If it weren\u2019t for my study group I probably would have failed\u2026 be prepared to work hard fam\n\nedit: fair grader, provided study sessions, allowed some opportunities to make up some extra points if needed. \n\nWhen I took her class like 3 years ago, she would commute from Dallas so classes would be cancelled every so often if she wasn\u2019t able to make the commute \n\nHated every moment of Calculus but I\u2019m really glad she was the one teaching it.",

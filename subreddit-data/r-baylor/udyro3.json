It is not loving to endorse sinful behavior. \n\n\"Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.\" \n\nThe Bible never wavers on the fact that we are to rebuke sin (Luke 7:3). But absolutely we are to respond in a spirit of gentleness and kindness. Screaming with signs and bullhorns is certainly afoul of how we are instructed to treat each other. \n\nBut the idea that Jesus himself would applaud and cheer the celebration of sinful behavior could not be further from what is shown in scripture. He rebuked sin, but did so gently and in order to get people repent and grow closer to God, without the barrier of sin in the way. \n\nAnd as for the pork thing, I was saying that asking me about pork or two-fabrics is unrelated to the idea of Jesus ever celebrating and applauding sin. I personally don't give a rip what people want to do in their private lives, but there is zero scriptural context in which God would applaud those reveling in sinful behavior.",

            "comment": "Gonna jump in to respond to the \"why would you even go to Baylor if you're gay\" and \"just go someplace else\" stuff. \n\nThe idea that people should just go someplace else if they're LGBT is extremely unrealistic. Although technically adults, undergrads often don't have a choice in the school they go to. Parents will stipulate they'll only pay if their child attends X university, for instance, or they're only offered scholarships at one place and it dictates where they go. Some of them do choose to go to Baylor, often because they take their faith very seriously and wouldn't be accepted at more secular institutions for their Christianity (I don't want to get into it but it can be really hard to be Christian in LGBT circles for instance, so someone might think Baylor is a good option for their faith without realizing it's not so good for their sexuality or gender identity). For whatever reason, LGBT folks end up at Baylor, and either can't go somewhere else or would experience a lot of hardship if they did. There just isn't the freedom of movement people imagine. \n\nWhat do we do then? Kick them out, enforce homogeneity in our ideology? (Lol). Bully them? These are ridiculously un-Christian options, despite the number of so-called Christians who endorse them. Amongst trans folks in particular, 41% have attempted suicide and about 80% have seriously considered it. Pair that with the immense amounts of outside violence that they and other LGBT folks have to deal with, and you're talking about one of the most at-risk communities in the United States. And Christians participate in that violence when they don't offer adequate support or when they fail to defend LGBT people when they are threatened (as is the case in the current [class action lawsuit](https://wacotrib.com/news/local/education/baylor-students-join-lgbtq-class-action-suit-against-department-of-education/article_b445d2f8-91b1-11eb-837c-6fe62cd647b5.html) against Baylor). Simply put, failing to stand up for these students or to provide them with community is a really great way to put them in serious danger or at least turn them against Christianity for the rest of their lives. At the very least, it's just bad evangelism. \n\nA chartered LGBT student group at Baylor shouldn't be seen as a threat to the Christian foundations of the school. A far bigger threat is damaging ourselves, our community, and students by telling them they're unwanted or not \"good enough\" to be Christian. Refusing them support in an environment that, again, has shown itself to be openly hostile is just cruel. \n\nOh, and if you wanna talk removing the beam from your own eye before you point out the speck in someone else's (Matthew 7:5), Baylor has continued to uphold and protect frat culture despite the NUMEROUS rape and sexual assault cases that have resulted from it. It's baffling that such a Christian university permits and even protects a culture based in heavy drinking, hazing, drugs, and rape. My sister's *loosely Catholic* university does better than Baylor, banning *all* fraternities and sororities. It's hypocritical to think Baylor is a perfectly wonderful Christian school during all the rape trials, and then to call it un-Christian and bowing to mainstream culture when they allow gay students to meet on campus.",

I'm encouraging Baylor to stick with its beliefs and to not be bullied. You can be gay and go to Baylor, I had plenty of friends at Baylor who were gay and they were happy as clams, that doesn't mean Baylor needs to officially sanction LGBTQ+ groups so they look accepting. Baylor also doesn't need to officially sanction alcohol consumption, extra-marital sex, idolatry, or any other number of things Baptists believe are immoral. FWIW, I don't share in Baylor's belief's that homosexuality is a sin and I don't share many other of Baylor's beliefs - I do believe Baylor should continue to hold true to its mission and not give in to wokeism.",

Baylor, if it is to be a Christian institution must support itself on the twin pillars of faith and education. For Church, For Texas. This is Baylor\u2019s identity. It is the sole thing that sets this University apart from other expensive secular private schools with less than Ivy League academics (see TCU and SMU.) All are welcome into a compassionate and tolerant community. All are encouraged to engage with one another and pursue the highest goals and aspirations of their fields. I think we are all united in Baylor\u2019s support and furtherance of education. But the University would not exist without that second of pillar of Faith. The culture at Baylor is not possible without that second pillar. The insistence that we must erode the pillar of faith, by adopting stances that are contrary to the institutions purposes and missions, will crack and crater the University given time. At which point, Baylor is not Baylor. It\u2019s just a really expensive \u201cWaco University.\u201d",

[Topically, here is the Catholic stance on homosexuality. Sections 2357-2359 specifically.](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#:~:text=2357%20) In it, the Catholic Church finds that homosexuality as a nature is not sinful, but homosexual acts are and that homosexuals are called to chastity. Now, Baylor is not a Catholic institution, but these sentiments are about as liberal as you can take Christian sentiment on this issue without completely upending and ignoring 2000 years of teaching on sexual immorality. Is this aligned with PRISM\u2019s goals or are they seeking Baylor University\u2019s acceptance of more intimate and active relationships? \n\nThe Church desires more believers, and it would  be simpler to get them by going with mainstream and popular opinion than living in some draconian dark age regarding the place of the LGBTQ+ community. How easy it would be, to not have to take an opposing stance against the popular views of the day. But to do that, you are asking for willful ignorance on this subject as it is presented both biblically and historically. You are asking Baylor to adopt a stance that is contrary while swearing it is anything but. Is the Bible and Christian tradition our moral guide stones through Christ, or is it not? If we are going to pick and chisel every vestige and biblical message to the point that Christianity no longer represents or means anything, then what are we doing? \n\nMatthew 16:26 is apt here. \u201cFor what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d",

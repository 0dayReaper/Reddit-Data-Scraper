    "postText": "Hi everyone, I came here for some advice from anyone who has gone through the CL process or went through it this year. I will try to keep this brief but I apologize if it is long as I try to cover all of the details. This is taking a lot of courage to share, and Reddit is a weird place, but honestly I don't know how else to reach my target audience. Apologies for any confusion but there has got to be some change in the CL process. \n\nI came into Baylor not necessarily a non-believer, but someone who wanted to grow their faith journey. I spent much of my first year and a half sinning, grappling with anxiety and depression. I finally pull out of this and find myself on an upward swing. I apply to be a CL because I felt called to the role. We applied back in September. On the application, I put that I was a Christian. It was a yes or no question (if I remember right). I did not really have any experience in the church but I wanted to grow my faith through the CL role and pour out into others that are doubting the Christian faith or those who have similar faith journeys to mine. Though I pretty much identified as Christian because of my morals, I never felt 'saved' or felt any connection until three weeks ago. \n\nAnyways, I make it into the CL class (LDS 3V01). For the majority of the semester, I struggled to connect to the Christian aspects of the class. I was transparent, but I felt like I did not connect to faith as much as everyone else in the class. I never really admitted my struggles in fear of being kicked out of the process or something. Fast forward to three weeks ago, I attend FM72 after experiencing a bad and violent panic attack. I was saved by the Lord that evening. I no longer struggle with anxiety or violent thoughts and now turn to scripture and prayer for answers. This all happened in 3 weeks. Of course, I do not expect anyone but God to understand this situation, but I still opened up to my CL class about what had happened and what I have been feeling this whole time. \n\nA week later, my cohort leaders (one of which happens to be in charge of the CL process) calls a meeting. The person in charge of the process says that they wanted clarification as they assumed I was dishonest in my application when I originally said I was Christian. I basically explained to them everything I said above. It was a positive conversation but still brought about lots of anxiety. I would never in a million years be dishonest, even before I was saved by Christ. My cohort leaders have shown so much understanding and compassion towards me.\n\nDespite all of this, I received an email yesterday stating that I was declined from a position as a CL. To be frank, I feel betrayed. I did the right thing, I KNOW I did. If anyone in my class had doubts or struggles regarding their faith, which is almost inevitable for any Christian, I wanted to encourage them. I wanted to share the Gospel. But instead, I get faced with rejection. Sure, maybe it isn't in God's plan. I'm at peace with the rejection, it's the behavior from my cohort leaders that struck me as surprising. I do not want to work for a university department that puts us through a 7 month, anxiety-filled process just to deny someone because they were not Christian until fairly recently. I would like to assume that there were other parts of my personality that led to rejection, but with how well the class has been going, I can't help but feel like the claim of dishonesty ultimately led to my rejection.\n\nI have a 100 in the class and submitted assignments several days in advance... I am just confused on the message that Campus Living &amp; Learning is trying to send. \n\nIf you were accepted as a CL or are currently a CL, I would be cautious. Doing the right thing may get you fired or confronted. Trust in no one but the Lord, for He will always lead you in the right direction.",

The assignments, the conversations, and the \u201cteaching\u201d were actually quite ridiculous now that I reflect on it. \n\nFun fact. I submitted information to my residence hall director about drug deals going on in one of the halls on campus (I had proof). My roommate at the time was caught up in it and I didn\u2019t want any of that going through my room. So I told the residence hall director that my roommate was involved but I didn\u2019t want him to know the information came from me. What does the residence hall director do? He leaks my name to not only my roommate but the gf at the time when he questioned them. Needless to say I was bullied by my roommate and others in the hall after that (nothing was ever done to them). I was pissed. I took this to CL&amp;L and went to the head (who happened to by my CL class prof at the time). I wanted to get the hall director in hot water for what he did to me. But\u2026 I was I met with \u201cwhat do you want me to do about it?\u201d Very very sad. That was my worst experience at Baylor. :( oh also\u2026 Roommate at the time ended up getting hired as a CL after this incident. #corrupt",

If you said anything about Violent thoughts, that might have been the reason over where on your religious journey you find yourself today.\n\nGlad all is better now, much better and more fulfilling things out there then being a CL.

Back in my day, the CL position was brand new when I was a sophomore so they didn\u2019t have any of these classes, etc. you just applied. I wonder if the reason you didn\u2019t get selected was because they had, say, 50 spots available, and 100 applicants? Just making those numbers up, of course. I admit I don\u2019t know how the whole process works now but basically what I\u2019m trying to say is maybe there just werent enough spots. On the bright side, at least you\u2019re headed to heaven! I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s way better than being in a residence hall. Also, like another person said, you seem like a very kind, caring person so there\u2019s that too. And\u2026 (unless you\u2019re going to be a senior), as Abe Lincoln did, you can always try again next year if it\u2019s really important to you. Tenacity!!! Persistence!!! \ud83d\ude00 (actually I don\u2019t know if you can reapply, but I assume it\u2019s possible???? It was back in my day)",

There were a lot less female CL slots open for hiring this year than there were male slots (a buddy of mine who applied and got the job told me) and the sad truth was they had to turn away a lot of seemingly qualified people because they simply didn't have enough room. Also, your cohort leader does not have the final say in whether or not you are hired - I would expect that falls to the individual RHD who's doing the hiring for their team.\n\nAnd yes, reapplication is completely possible! You wouldn't even have to retake the CL class. You may even be put on a mid-year hire list.",

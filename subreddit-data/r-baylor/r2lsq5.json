The blue bloods constantly chasing the next Saban can fuck off.\n\nWhy go to a place that demands instant success, has boosters meddling in everything, doesn't support you, or will fire you for 'only' 10 win seasons?\n\nThe coaching arms race is getting ridiculous, so I love seeing people like Aranda, Traylor, Tucker, Fickell, etc. stick with their teams.\n\nIt also makes the blue bloods more likely to mess up a hire and end up even worse, like Texas and FSU.",

    "postText": "Well friends, I'm thankful this week. For a lot of things, but mostly because we've got another Baylor Football game to play, and hopefully redeem the season. This Friday, the Bears take a little trip down I-35 to pay a visit to our burnt orange brethren and have a game of pigskin. After a heartbreaking loss against the Horned Frogs, Baylor will be looking to right the ship. Texas, however, has a bone to pick with Baylor: They need a win if they want a trip to the Big 12 Championship (they'll also need Kansas to pick off Kansas State). \n\nSo there's a lot on the line this Thanksgiving. Tell us:\n\n# Who wins?\n\n## Game Odds\n\n| Opening | Current | Over/Under |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| \u00b2\u00b3 Texas -9 | \u00b2\u00b3 Texas -8.5 | 56.5 (-110/-110) |\n\n*Odds are current as of the submission of this post.* [*^(sourced from OddsShark)*](https://www.oddsshark.com/ncaaf/baylor-texas-odds-november-26-2022-1635836)\n\n## Game Info\n\n| Location | Opponent | Game Start |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Darrell K.

Otherwise, please delete and resubmit your prediction.\n5. **Flair up!** To be eligible to win the pickem, you need flair! You can request flair [in the official flair thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/pgnffl/user_flair_request_thread_fall_2021/?) located in the sidebar. If you didn't graduate from Baylor, but you're a Baylor fan, just request \"Baylor Fan\" or \"Sic 'em Bears\"! If you're a fan of another team, you can request the mascot of your team, such as \"Longhorns\" or \"Sooners\".\n\nThe prediction that correctly chooses the winner, comes closest to guessing the actual score and was submitted earliest will win. The prize for winning is a free month of Reddit Premium (and spiffy flair)! Good luck! Pick 'em, Bears!",

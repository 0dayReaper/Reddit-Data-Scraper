If you were a guest on campus, you can probably clear that up at the tower. I got ticketed during a visit as an alumni and they took care of me.",

In my experience, they will put several (4-5) unpaid tickets on the license plate before towing. When they are about to start towing, they will leave a note with the last ticket warning you that you will be towed on your next. \n\nThis was 2013-2017. Do with this information what you will.",

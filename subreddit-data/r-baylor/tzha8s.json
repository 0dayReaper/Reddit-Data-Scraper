            "comment": "I am assuming that you are an incoming freshman, correct? Could you provide me with more details? For example, are you planning to go a semester early? Are you down to take summer classes? I just switched to pre-nursing and have talked with the pre-nursing advisor and coordinator of pre-nursing student services recently so I can definitely try to guide you with a little bit more detail. \n\nTo summarize, however, people usually try to get chemistry and microbiology out of the way in their first year (since they are the easiest out of the four sciences). Some capable people can juggle their workload pretty well this early in the game and might also opt to do microbiology and A&amp;P I together. Keep in mind, however, that A&amp;P I and II are the hardest of the four sciences (and taught by only one professor who teaches both A&amp;P) according to many students so be careful. Likewise, even if it says that you can complete either one in any order, I would not recommend that route\u2014especially at Baylor. Please complete A&amp;P I &amp; II in a chronological manner. \n\nLastly, I would suggest that you look up Baylor's latest book catalog (probably their 2021-2022 for recency matters), which shows you a sample curriculum plan. You can also google \"Baylor University Pre-Nursing Degree Plan.\" This is probably one of the best ways to plan out your four years if you cannot access an advisor just yet.\n\nSimilarly, you can transfer 15 credit hours from CC once you have started attending Baylor. Plan accordingly in the summer and keep in contact with both the pre-nursing advisor and coordinator of the pre-nursing student services. Good luck!",

I will take a look at that recency curriculum plan though that seems pretty helpful and is a good idea. Also what did you mean by transfer CC?",

                            "comment": "Going a semester early simply means trying to get your prereqs done before the traditional application timeline. Nursing school application is done on a semester basis. Basically, if you're trying to graduate early by a semester, you would try to apply by July (at the end of your freshman year and before the start of your sophomore year). That way, you can go to the nursing school spring of your sophomore year instead of the traditional fall of your junior year. To accomplish this task, you need to take summer classes and Baylor have a restriction on said summer classes (depending on the type you're taking).\n\nNow, there are two types of summer classes: 1) Baylor University summer classes and 2) CC (community college) summer classes. If you do your summer classes at Baylor, there is no limit under the four-years that you are attending Baylor as it is considered an extension of you attending classes at Baylor. Basically, it is treated as if it was just a regular fall or spring semester at Baylor. You would need to research how much credits you can take depending on your classification (ie. freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). 12 credits per semester is required to be considered a full-time student. Some take up to 15 credits per semester (in case you fail a class like A&amp;P but plan accordingly) and some go even higher. I think the maximum cap is 18 for most students but if need be, I heard students getting their cap override to accommodate 19-20 credits per semester (which is very risky move for the sake of your GPA since it's a lot of work).\n\nHowever, CC summer classes are different. You can only transfer 15 credits once you have started attending Baylor University. Most importantly: you need to check the ETC (equivalent course tool). Search up the name of the community college that you wish to attend and see if the course lines up with the course that you need credit for at Baylor. If not, do not attend that community college. Likewise, most CC classes are for 1000-2000 level classes. Higher levels (3000-4000) cannot be done outside of Baylor. If I were to take CC summer classes, I'd recommend taking them at MCC (McLennan Community College) or at another community college near your home (if you wish to go home that summer but still take CC classes). It is more affordable than Baylor's Summer Classes. If you need to take Baylor's Summer Classes, I would only do so if you have used up all 15 credits allowed for transfer from CC or if it's a higher-level class. That's why it's important to double-check these courses because: 1) some of the higher-level courses might not be offered during the summer at Baylor and 2) if you have a hard class that can be taken at CC (like A&amp;P), do not waste your limited 15 transfer credit on an easy class. If you're another major, I feel like that would've been fine (like taking religion classes, American literature and such at CC) but personally, having saved up my 15 transfer credits for this summer for my remaining nursing classes, I'm glad I never wasted it on those easy classes bc my nursing prereq GPA requires them haha.\n\nAlso, keep in mind: you need a science GPA of 2.75 and above (for the four sciences) and a cumulative nursing pre-req GPA of 3.00 or above to be admitted. Plus, you need to take HESI (but I heard it's relatively okay). \n\nWith that, DM me if you need anymore help. This reddit response is becoming a little too long for my liking haha.",

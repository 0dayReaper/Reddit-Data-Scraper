    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\n\nI\u2019m doing an impromptu trip down to Austin this weekend and bought some tickets for the Baylor vs TCU game. I need some help when it comes to understanding the tailgating environment. Where do people usually go? Where is a good place to park a car?\n\n\nShould I just buy a case of beer and walk around until I find a place to squat?\n\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

Yellow does \u201cnot\u201d have alcohol (but the across the bridge yellow usually will have some but people aren\u2019t getting very drunk). Blue is the alcohol tailgate, there will be frats there that will be hammered, as well as just people hanging out at their own tailgates.",

I know Athletics farmed out Tailgating to Tailgate Guys now called Revel, but I don't think they changed the rules on alcohol at the non-student areas (I know I have seen plenty of beer &amp; liquor while walking by the Law School Tailgating Area).",

It\u2019s directly across the street from the stadium, roughly the same walking distance as the official BU offered tailgating spots.\n\nYou can have drinks at either - unless they\u2019ve changed that rule for the BU provided tailgating spots since the vendor took over. We used to use the BU spots, but moved over to Brazos a couple years ago when the vendor change happened.\n\nBrazos also offers just parking if they have spots left, otherwise it\u2019s similar to most places where businesses and homes in the area are cash lots for the day.\n\nYou absolutely can walk around, our experience have always been great there. You also can check out https://sicem365.com/store#!item=526 (more chatter/details about on the blue bird app) if you want more of a all in one deal to get food and drinks - they are located in the same Brazos Parking tailgate area.",

The stadium is so small don't feel like you need it, but to my knowledge, we're the only stadium that offers this and it's fun to mess around with.\n\nSince you're on the way to Austin, I would suggest a post game meal at Don Carlos. It's on the south edge of town and far enough out that it doesn't get hammered after the games by fans. It's above average Tex-Mex for a good price and a lot of TVs around to catch the rest of the games going on.",

It\u2019s then a quick walk to the stadium or you can hop on the shuttle that takes of from Speight garage/sid rich area (or the old business school if you\u2019re old like me). But I\u2019ve found you can park pretty much any area on campus and walk about the mile to do so. \n\nJust be really mindful of where you are walking with alcohol. Student tailgating section is obviously no alcohol (off to the right side when you\u2019re walking to the stadium before the bridge).",

Pretty consistently I would find myself beating my friends w. Parking to our after game meal.\n\nusually for 11am games I enjoy going to the Waco [Farmers](https://wacodowntownfarmersmarket.org/) market and finding some breakfast there. It's two or three blocks from the shuttle pickup",

As for parking if you come in from the West on MLK Jr Blvd and make a left on Orchard (first left after you go under I-35) there will be places along there to park, probably run around $20 I guess. Has been a long time since I looked for parking since I have a pass for the main lot.",

    "postText": "I graduated from UNT in May of 21 with a bachelor's in logistics &amp; supply chain management and with the option for my current company to cover most of the cost of tuition, I was thinking of continuing my education.  However, I'm torn on whether or not to get a masters or bachelor's and torn on what I could study that would compliment my supply chain degree. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I went the other direction from you, graduated from Baylor and then worked at UNT for a few years and did my grad work in CS/Econ on the side there.\n\nLogistics is also a strength at Baylor, although not quite to the level that UNT\u2019s LSCM program is top-notch nationally; I second the other recommendations that you look into Baylor\u2019s MBA program, it\u2019s a very well-connected program in industry.",

I picked up a lot of grad CS and undergrad Econ classes before I formally enrolled in the MS CS program, so when I left for a new job at the end of the fall 2021 semester, I was two courses short of my MS in CS and three classes short of a BA in Econ. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the staff tuition perk anymore or the time to take classes, so I took a leave of absence from my degree at UNT. The goal is to go back and finish at least one of those degrees up someday!\n\nMan, now I\u2019m missing Denton a lot. Dang.",

There's a lab space open late on the 2nd floor to the right. \n\nEmpty classrooms in Draper and Hankamer are often left unlocked. There's a dedicated quiet study area on the 2nd floor.",

Would come back in between classes and kept the table all day. Sat at the tables along the window facing out in the direction of the River. Big windows so lots of natural sunlight, and not much foot traffic.",

            "comment": "1.    Sort of.  Very few people live on campus after freshman year, but most still live in the neighborhood immediately surrounding the campus which is almost 100% Baylor students.  So there is a very real student community like a more residential school but it\u2019s located off campus on land not controlled by Baylor.\n2. Safe enough, but don\u2019t be stupid.  There are more than enough great bars to meet demand but the Baylor Bubble is real and leaves most students happy to move to bigger cities after graduation.  Those who actually get out and explore the area usually love it though.  I thought it was the perfect blend of city options, small town ease, and historic character.  But don\u2019t make college decisions based on what the town has to offer.  It is just as easy to be bored in New York or Austin as it is in Waco or Stillwater.  What matters to a good college experience is the friends you make.\n3. Not really.  Chapel and a bible core requirement are real, and I did see the guy dragging a cross around every day.  But Baylor is big enough that you can find all types there.  Just spend time with the kind of people you want to, and ignore the ones you don\u2019t.\n4. 15,000 unsupervised college age kids.  So yes.  The number of people who fail out due to partying is not any higher or lower than anywhere else.  My friends and I had a fantastic time both around campus and in the surrounding area.",

It\u2019s also a quick shot to Dallas or Austin for weekend/day trips. \n\n2. Parts are safe and parts are not. Fortunately it\u2019s easy to tell. Generally speaking though, I never felt in any real danger. And I felt very safe when on campus of course. Like I said there are things to do in town. And Baylor puts on a stupid amount of events. \n\n3. It can be. You won\u2019t get it from admin/faculty/staff. Some of the students are a little overbearing about it. You learn to avoid them though and just hang out with other normal people. \n\n4. Never really partied much myself so I can\u2019t speak personally. I\u2019ve heard there are some good ones though. Not going to be like A&amp;M or UT or anything though.",

            "comment": "Waco is a nice town \u2014 so many good eating places, coffee shops, places to hang out, and it\u2019s close to Austin and Dallas which gives you more opportunities to explore! There is nightlife/bars/parties off-campus but I\u2019ve never really been interested. \n\nWaco has some places which aren\u2019t as safe, but it\u2019s easy to tell which places aren\u2019t safe and which are. Still, as a girl, I try to keep my self defense weapons close by. However, on campus, even during late night, like 9:00pm and later, I\u2019ve ALWAYS felt safe, I\u2019ve never had any issues. I think kids would find the most issues in Collins, HRC, and Kokernot because they\u2019re on the edge of campus but even there I have felt fine and haven\u2019t heard of any issues. \n\nBesides the required chapel and Christian classes, not really. My professors and friends never were in my face about it. Everyone is chill, respectful, and inclusive. You\u2019ll definitely here people going to church or offering rides to church, but no one is \u201cin your face\u201d about it. I have friends who are Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Atheist, and more. And we all have a fun time. \n\nI know there is a party scene, but I\u2019m not interested in it. If you are interested and you look for parties, you will find plenty. But if you aren\u2019t interested like me, you\u2019ll most likely never find any and that\u2019s how I like it.",

            "comment": "I know there have already been a few responses, but I figured there is no harm in adding another one.\n\n1. Yes? I think it depends what you mean by that. Most students live off-campus starting their sophomore year, and even the ones that live on campus know people they can visit. Apart from housing, there is plenty to do in Waco. It's not the most glamorous city, but the food is good, there's a big park nearby, and there's plenty of odd touristy places that are fun to visit once or twice. I think the real charm of Baylor, though, is what happens on campus, especially for Freshman. There are a lot of traditions events (Hoco, Christmas on Fifth, etc.), and you can always find things to do with other people on the campus. But there is a good balance, so you are not forced into going on or off campus for social activities.\n2. I think Waco is safe. I live right outside of Baltimore though, so my perception may be a little skewed. Obviously don't be stupid, it is still a city and college students are known for being unaware of their surroundings (especially me haha). And for things to do, see above.\n3. I went to a public high school for 12 years, so to me the Christian faith is more in your face than what I was used to. But, I wouldn't describe it as an issue, nor that \"in your face\". I am Christian, so I don't mind, but other than Chapel, two religious courses, what you'll find is that professors will sometimes bring up faith, students talk about faith a lot, and there are a lot of Christian groups that promote on campus. But I know people at all ranges on the faith spectrum, and people generally find their place.\n4. Yes, but not as much as other schools. I don't really know, I don't party, but they certainly exist. If you want to party you can, if you don't want to, nobody cares. So no matter what, it's not a real issue.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions!",

Use common sense.\n3. The aspect by Baylor isn\u2019t, the classes are a breeze. You\u2019ll run into some intense people, and probably be invited to church a few times, but it\u2019s nothing crazy.\n4. There is, not as much as like a state school though. If you\u2019re in Greek life you\u2019ll definitely find parties, if not Dia is a big party day, and generally if you make friends you\u2019ll have fun. Also if you\u2019re a girl seeking parties the frats will accept you without a thought.",

            "comment": "1. Not really lmao. You have to find friends and make \"your own\" scene, if that makes sense.\n2. Depends on where you go. Every college town seems to have a problem with widespread poverty and worrying levels of crime. The area around Baylor is what is commonly known as the \"Baylor Bubble,\" and is pretty safe. I wouldn't recommend walking in parts of the city you're not familiar with alone, especially at night, and especially if you're a woman. At night especially, its best to drive or travel in groups.\n3. No, the religious aspect is not \"in your face.\" I, and many others have spoken about this on this subreddit before. The religious features of Baylor's curriculum are taught from a secular POV.\n4. Not really. From what I can tell, you need to be \"in\" with the right crowd, most likely a frat/sorority in order to go to those giant college parties you see in movies. There aren't a lot of them at Baylor, and the school is a dry campus which makes things even harder. Baylor is a pretty academically serious institution so many of the students aren't necessarily partying on the weekends, especially during the semester.",

She joined a sorority this year, but is not going to stay involved. Turns out she is just not into it.  Loved Waco and visiting. Great food, neat stuff to see. We are active Catholics and she really enjoyed the religion classes  nothing about it was in your face/ convert or burn type stuff. She\u2019s not a partner but had good friends and found plenty to do when she had time. Studying takes up a lot!!!",

There aren\u2019t really any clubs or college bars. There\u2019s a lot of good restaurants and coffee shops though. Waco is also close to Dallas and Austin if you want to escape. Cameron park is pretty nice. Best not to go at night though. I will say waco is still growing and there\u2019s more and more places being built every year. \n\n2. Waco is tolerable but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily consider it \u201csafe.\u201d Waco has its nice areas like downtown but there\u2019s a lot of ghetto areas near campus and homeless people roaming the streets. They get annoying especially when you\u2019re just trying to go out and explore the town because they harass you for money. From my experience here, I feel like every week Baylor sends an email regarding a shooting off campus, a kidnapping, car thefts, armed robberies, etc. I was excited to come here because of the river and thought it would be something like UTSA where people would use it, but the Brazos river water isn\u2019t safe and no one gets in because of the pollution and bacteria. \n\n3. The religious aspect of Baylor isn\u2019t as intense as I thought. If it\u2019s your thing you\u2019ll come across several students who are religious and some will most likely recruit you to join there church. All the religious kids I\u2019ve met have been really friendly, but they\u2019re not really my group I like hanging around. You do have to take two religious courses during your 4 years and attend chapel but I took chapel online and it was asynchronous so it wasn\u2019t bad. \n\n4. Waco is not considered a party school but people do party and like to have the college experience. I will say there\u2019s only like 2 or 3 bars near campus that baylor students go to and the only times most students will go out is after a game or on something like St. Patrick\u2019s day. Most of the time there\u2019s more sketchy locals that go to the bars than students. You have better chances of having stuff to do by joining clubs or Greek life. Greek life here does throw parties frequently but there\u2019s no greek row with mansions. Instead it\u2019s old houses that parents have rented out for their kids and most of the time the parties are in the backyards because the houses are too small. It\u2019s not the same experience as other colleges with real greek life, but it\u2019s here if you want it.",

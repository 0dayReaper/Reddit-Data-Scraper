I normally take a bunch of the SI worksheets and use it too. Study. \n\nI don\u2019t use the textbook because I feel like there\u2019s minimal use to it. \n\nI just feel like I don\u2019t click with him the majority of the time and when I feel confident I just fail to meet expectations. \n\nLooking on what to do.",

College classes are a huge transition. \n\nI'd urge you genuinely evaluate how you're spending your time. If you're responsibly studying and are still not seeing results, you **must change the way you are studying**. Baylor's STEM curriculum is transitioning towards a more active-learning, applications based approach to teaching. You are expected to have mastery of the learning objectives (which is what homework is for), and apply your knowledge (which is what exams test for). \n\nLectures are more of a springboard to **introduce** concepts, and it is up to the you to encode this. Lecture notes are the bare minimum and, so I've always urged students to use textbook material to fill in the gaps. Videos work better for some people. (Bozeman, O Chem Tutor). \n\nTBH don't get worked up about \"clicking\" with Dr. Klausmeyer. That's just his personality and your relationship with your science profs will have little to no bearing on your final grade. How do you usually feel after you complete an exam? Confident, or \"wow there were lots of questions I didn't know how to do?\"",

I would feel after the exam that I did pretty well, but then I would get 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s. \n\nCan you talk about more of the encoding and the \u201cspringboard\u201d mechanisms of studying? \n\nChemistry is the only topic that I have trouble with regarding this whole thing.",

[I think this would be good for you to read](https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/groups/Writing%20Program/forgetting_curve.pdf) \n\nGenChem is one of those classes where you have to be doing lots of practice problems. How are you approaching the homework? Are you intentionally working through the problems or just cheesing them with friends/quizlet/chegg? Generally speaking SI material and HW is designed to be representative of/harder than exam questions. \n\nHave you looked into [CASA tutoring?](https://www.baylor.edu/case/index.php?id=978324)",

    "postText": "I had a rough time with team taught the first go around and with how rough last semester went because of personal family issues and that I made the mistake of retaking immediately after with A&amp;P. I wanted to take Meredith palm\u2019s class but hers and other solo professors were full and ended up going to team taught again and didn\u2019t make it. Was very close to passing. Got an email by Kyle that I was going to be taken out of pre nursing and become undecided. I am really disheartened and scared to tell my parents this news as they only know I had trouble with A&amp;P this semester. I was going to retake psychology of the summer through baylor and because my previous counselor Cameron before she said she was leaving baylor said I could still retake again and she didn\u2019t say I\u2019d be taken out of my major. Is there anything I can do to get one last chance to stay? Please help.",

If you had extenuating circumstances with family issues the first time around they may be able to help you. However CASE works best when you have an ongoing issues. Doesn\u2019t hurt to check though.",

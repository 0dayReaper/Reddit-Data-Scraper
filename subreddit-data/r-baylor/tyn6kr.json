He has a nice testing policy though, where you take the test in class, but then there is a retest option on canvas that is optional. If you decide to do the retest at home he will average the two grades together for your grade. To be honest though, I\u2019d recommend taking physics remotely at community college over the summer and transferring it in. It\u2019s much easier (and cheaper) than taking it at baylor.",

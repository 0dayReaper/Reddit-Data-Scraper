Ken Starr, the majority of the admin, the AD and Briles are all to blame and the BoR tried to only blame Briles. Saying Briles had nothing to do with it is just ignorant. He actively worked to bury accusations by communicating with local attorneys in Waco and worked to prevent accusations from being handled correctly (along with the rest of the admin). \n\nWhat happened at Baylor from 2011-2015 was not all Briles fault, it was mostly on the Admin but he was was still culpable in aiding and abetting rapists on Baylor campus. Think about what you are defending\n\nedit: clarified statement see below post",

Found the Dallas Morning News article from 2017 that had what I misremembered as working with DA. It was a local attorney instead. I'll correct my other post. Here's the quote and article link but article is behind paywall...\n\n&gt;The filing also alleged that Briles used Shillinglaw to line up legal representation for the players who had run-ins with the law.\n\nIn one text exchange, after a player was arrested for assault and threatening to kill someone, the paperwork said Briles texted athletic director McCaw that he had just talked to the player, who said Waco police had agreed to \"keep it quiet.\" Briles promised to ask Shillinglaw to check in with a local attorney.\n\n\"That would be great if they kept it quiet!\" McCaw allegedly replied. He is now the athletic director at Liberty University in Virginia.\n\n[https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2017/02/03/damning-texts-between-ex-baylor-coach-briles-other-officials-revealed-in-new-court-records/](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2017/02/03/damning-texts-between-ex-baylor-coach-briles-other-officials-revealed-in-new-court-records/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: Either way if anyone thinks Briles didn't do anything wrong they should read that article, there's other ones that are free as well.",

That this was a wild exaggeration, but it fuels the Briles hate even to this day.\n\nShould he have remained the coach... ehhh... that's debatable. Probably not.\n\nWas he made the scapegoat for little bad acts that compounded over time done by multiple people? Absolutely.",

So now that freak, 30 years later, is still working on college campuses.  \nI don't have to \"think\" about what I'm defending. I know what I'm defending.\u00a0 And I've been a victim too but I didn't make it up or brag in a text message I was going to trap them. I've also seen friends accused of stuff they didn't do and weren't even in the same state when it happened.  \nPlayers accused of stuff they didn't do and then acquitted because she either made it up or they found the text messages of her bragging she was gonna trap him.  \nPlayers whose only crime was being there at the same time are still being associated with it because they made it sound like it was the entire team.  \nCoaches who kicked the ones who actually did stuff off the team as soon as they knew about it but Baylor PD did nothing to get them off-campus.  \nPlayers and Coaches were used as scapegoats but ignored the frat boys who were actually convicted in the same time period.  \nRepeated references to the\u00a0player who never actually played because the Coaches rightfully were kicked off the team before ever putting on a uniform.  \nAnd that article that you're hanging your head on... was proven just as made up as the \"report\"...",

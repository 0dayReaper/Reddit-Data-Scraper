I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend reading ahead because the syllabi change year over year.

I went through BIC, so I\u2019m biased, but the professors and faculty of BIC are some of the best on campus. \n\nSo many people helped me out, and even in cases where I probably was coming in too late for advising, or was too flustered to think of a way to structure my essay, they were a great and easily accessible help.\n\nWith BIC, the rhetoric classes are traditionally considered the hardest classes. Make some close friends in the program (Not hard to do!) and make sure to form or join study groups!\n\nIt\u2019s been a great asset for my personal development, and the professors care about their students inside and outside of the classroom. BIC\u2019s media analysis and NYT projects helped me pursue my academic and professional goals with a much-needed context.\n\nI believe Dr. Mark Long is retiring, but he is a really special figure in the BIC. If he\u2019s there make sure to introduce yourself, he\u2019s a saint.",

Maybe just the first three chapters and any other chapter that sounds interesting to you. It won a Pulitzer. It has that BIC feel of a generalist across specialities trying to convey the big picture. As for BIC, my favorite benefit was seeing the same people in classes for four years. It was hard. The amount of reading was brutal for me but workable for most. I am deeply grateful for the structure of it still 20\u2019years later.",

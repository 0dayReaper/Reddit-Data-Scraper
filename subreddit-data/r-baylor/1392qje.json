I don\u2019t know if they still do it but they used to make anyone that lived there sign a 2 year contract that was super difficult to get out of so once they made friends they wanted to live with, they couldn\u2019t.\n\nI signed up for the Entrepreneurship LLC which meant I got to live at Brooks Flat. Highly recommend. Apartment style dorms, private bathrooms, a little more lax on rules.",

I also never cared for the Brooks dining hall, but of course this could've changed a lot in the last 4 years so I have no idea what the food is like now.",

Living at brooks is really what you make it, and keep in mind you have a two year commitment as a freshman if you live in an RC. There are tons of events and ways to get involved (such as the 4 committees), but if you don\u2019t try to get involved, don\u2019t complain when you don\u2019t like it. If you have any questions I would love to help you out more!",

I liked brooks as a freshman but being a part of council helped me make really close friendships! As to getting involved, freshman can\u2019t be on council, however you could join one of the four committees! We have one based around service &amp; ministry, community &amp; tradition, art &amp; culture, and recreation! There is an involvement fair during welcome week where you can find out more. There are tons of events and other things that make brooks special, but still remember if you don\u2019t make the effort, you probably won\u2019t like it, &amp; you have to be willing to stay 2 years on campus. :)",

            "comment": "I have lived in Brooks for the past few years and have absolutely loved it! It obviously does have some downsides, and I will try to give you both perspectives having interacted with students who love it, and those who didn't enjoy their time as much.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits is the number of events we put on. There are weekly community dinners, tea time with invited guests (like President Livingstone), movie nights, dances, and more. The professional staff is great and comprised of very wise people who are really involved in the community and want to invest in students. I even got dinner with our faculty in residence tonight, which I think is rarer at other residence halls. So in summary, the community is excellent, and though some people don't like the contract the people who really get involved in the community and invest into Brooks have an easier time living here for two or even more years.\n\nThe problem happens when you don't get involved in the community. For a variety of reasons some people just don't connect as well as we hope, and that can be difficult, and is generally why people try to break out of their contracts. The easiest way to overcome this is to really invest into the community. I don't know of anyone who shows up to events consistently who doesn't love the place.\n\nI am so thankful for my time at Brooks and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be a part of a strong community. The biggest risk is that you find that community elsewhere, and have to come back for a second year, but even then, it's not the worst thing in the world.",

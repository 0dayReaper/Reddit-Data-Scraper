I know summer pay is over $9, but if you're not working over the summer and only during the academic year, I have no idea if it'll be that or the standard $8 for most work-study. It's perfect for either introverts or extroverts \u2014 you have to wear headphones to transcribe most of your shift, but the rest of the staff is incredibly friendly and willing to talk to you if you need a break",

We even had some CLs \"retire\" from the position and become OAs which was a great way for them to stay involved in the community. Knowing the people at your residence hall is a really great way to succeed in the CL application process.",

However, in Bearweb the books will eventually be listed as the beginning of the semester approaches. I HIGHLY recommend waiting to get them until classes start though! You won\u2019t need them the first week and you may not need them at all.\n\nAdditionally, if you join the Facebook group for your class and the class above, a lot of students will sell their old books on there for way cheaper. Don\u2019t pay the bookstore price\u2014it\u2019s simply not worth it.",

I know that physics is notorious here and was wondering if any of you had advice (the ones who did well or could have done better) for those two classes? \n\nPlanning to take 1420 and 1409.",

The formulas are never ending. But if you do all the homework in a timely manner, you'll do fine in the class. The tests are just the homework with different numbers, sometimes even the same numbers. You get all the formulas on a cheat sheet for the exam too. The labs are more fun than the chem or bio labs imo. They seem more practical and require less knowledge or preparation.",

My worst grades in college were a tie between Precalculus/Calculus but I got A\u2019s in every biology, chemistry, microbio, and anatomy &amp; physiology course I ever took. Graduated just a little north of a 3.95 GPA. That\u2019s not a flex, I\u2019m just trying to prove your point. \n\nI\u2019d actually argue that math classes are worst indicator of aptitude for medical school than of all the required classes. They have the least overlap of required skills than any of the other courses I mentioned and (at least to me) occupy a completely different part of the brain.",

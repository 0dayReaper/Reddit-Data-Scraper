You will find a lot of other international students, including some from your own country. \n\nMy wife is an immigrant, and America is a really hard place to live in as an immigrant. You will be able to work for up to a year after your student visa is through, but it will be harder to find work because employers often don't want to hire immigrants because of the volatility of the immigration process. If you get a visa through another means, it would be much easier to find a job. If you have the funds to come internationally to another country, you would probably be better off going to a country with a functional immigration system.",

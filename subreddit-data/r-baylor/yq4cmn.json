    "postText": "Hello all, my friends and I are visiting Waco for the K-State - Baylor football game this Saturday.  I was trying to find information regarding when the gates will open at McLane for the 6 pm game but couldn't find anything.  Would anyone happen to know when that would be and also I would love any game-day must visits if you all have any!",

            "comment": "First off, welcome to bear country! We're glad to have you. McLane typically opens about 3 hours before the game. You can find lots of stadium info [here](https://baylorbears.com/sports/2018/5/16/facilities-mclane-html.aspx#:~:text=It%20will%20open%203%20hours,delivered%20to%20a%20Mobile%20device.).\n\nThere are a lot of fun things to do in Waco. George's is a great local restaurant. The silos are pretty cool if you're into that type of thing. There's a huge outdoor area to hang out and they have food trucks. I never can pass up a coffee from Common Grounds. Somebody posted a similar question not too long ago that you can probably find in the search. There were a lot of great ideas that I can't think of off the top of my head now.",

It\u2019s a come as you are \u201ctailgate\u201d where you can buy drinks/food and enjoy music. \n\nhttps://www.baylor.edu/content/imglib/3/9/7/3/397312.jpg\n\nThe above is the tailgate map, would highly recommend checking out the pedestrian bridge across the Brazos River and making your way towards touchdown alley.  It\u2019s starting to be cooler so there will be less boats on the water but will nonetheless have some great views of campus and the Stadium along the river.\n\nIf you are staying in a hotel downtown, I\u2019d suggest taking the shuttle. It\u2019s also a easy 2 mile walk on a paved sidewalk along either side of the River.",

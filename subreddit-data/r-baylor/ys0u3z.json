Otherwise, please delete and resubmit your prediction.\n5. **Flair up!** To be eligible to win the pickem, you need flair! You can request flair [in the official flair thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/pgnffl/user_flair_request_thread_fall_2021/?) located in the sidebar. If you didn't graduate from Baylor, but you're a Baylor fan, just request \"Baylor Fan\" or \"Sic 'em Bears\"! If you're a fan of another team, you can request the mascot of your team, such as \"Longhorns\" or \"Sooners\".\n\nThe prediction that correctly chooses the winner, comes closest to guessing the actual score and was submitted earliest will win. The prize for winning is a free month of Reddit Premium (and spiffy flair)! Good luck! Pick 'em, Bears!",

    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all, I just submitted my Baylor application through the CommonApp, which I thought would be ok since it\u2019s before the EA deadline at midnight tonight. However, the thought crossed my mind that I might have to have all my materials submitted in goBaylor by midnight tonight so I\u2019m kinda stressing since I probably won\u2019t get access until tomorrow. My transcript and recommendations are all don\u2019t through the CommonApp, but my SRAR won\u2019t be done by tonight. I think I\u2019m gonna be fine since my app is submitted but I just wanted to get confirmation that I\u2019ll be considered under EA. Thanks.",

As long as we receive your application by 11:59 pm in your time zone, we will consider your application\u201d so I think we\u2019re good. Also I put something on r/Applyingtocollege and they said I should be fine. Did you get access to your portal?",

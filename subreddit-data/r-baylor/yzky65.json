This was a game Baylor should've won. We were in control for 90% of the game. If not for leaving 14 points on the field and breaking down on the last drive, this game turns out very, very differently. But I've said repeatedly this season that I'd much rather have a game that we play well and simply don't come out on top than one we got dominated in, and despite how much this one hurts, I prefer it over last weeks performance.\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** This is where I struggle to find something to say other than \"that we lost\". Play calling definitely needed to be looked at (why are we running a friggin' jet sweep on 4th and 1?), and Shapen's decision-making continues to be a serious issue. But again, those were all minor problems that simply added up in exactly the wrong way.\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Holy smokes, where did Kelsey Johnson come from?? The freshman TE had two TDs (one rushing and one receiving) at pivotal moments for the Bears, and even though he wasn't the most proficient or frequently-targeted player, he definitely gets my nod for the momentum he gave the Bears. Have a day, Kelsey!\n * *Defense:* Devin Lemear was back on his game today. Seemed every time a big play was made, his name was mentioned, even just in the capacity of taking away a major passing lane. \n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* I went back and forth on this one, but I have to give it to the first quarter pass from Shapen to Cameron for 42 yards and a first down. TCU had just tied the game, Baylor seemed stalled with a 3rd and 12, and then *BAM*. Huge gain and Baylor seemed to react by saying \"Hey wait a minute, we still got this!\"\n * *Defense:* It ultimately didn't matter, but Baylor's hurry-up of the 2-pt conversion TCU failed to make to tie the game late in the 4th quarter was by far the most momentum-changing play on the defensive side of the ball.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** Baylor still has room for heartbreaking losses. Look, we knew this team was not going to repeat as Big 12 champion, and there have been plenty of games where the result maybe should've gone the other way. But I see a lot of gumption in this squad. They're still looking for their identity, and still need a *lot* of coaching to find it. But this team is much better than their 6-5 record, and anyone who's been paying attention knows it. \n\n* **Next Week:** Baylor takes a little trip down Austin-way for what they hope will be a delicious steak lunch.\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** As we did not have a winner last week, we have two winners today! Our first winner is /u/w8w8 with a prediction of [TCU, 30-24](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/yxze3l/football_pickem_revivalry_edition_%E2%81%B4_tcu_horned/iwrfzko/). Our second winner is /u/ttay24 with a prediction of [TCU, 42-21](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/yxze3l/football_pickem_revivalry_edition_%E2%81%B4_tcu_horned/iws6w32/).

Ever. How you manage to piss this away is fucking beyond me.\n\nShapen makes [the **EASIEST** fucking pass of his life](https://imgur.com/VOAvaow) and the game is over.\n\nAwful.

It's totally cool. \n\nThe overall point: Baylor has had some DARK times w/r/t the athletic program, and especially the football team. It's OK if they have a \"bad\" season, meaning they aren't going to a big bowl game or whatever. Bowl games weren't even a THING in the 90s. I remember a couple of the players being in my French class one semester, and they were beyond excited to go the Builder's Square Alamo Bowl! The campus has some milestones then - first bowl game in a while, first dance on campus, stuff like that. So if you take in some perspective, it's all good to have a middle-of-the-road season when one considers the body of Baylor Football as a whole.\n\nDave Aranda is a treasure of a coach, and you'll probably find the Gen X alum like me saying the same as I did above: have patience. Sure, some changes can be made for next year, but we're in the last week or two of the season, and making wide-sweeping changes seem rather unintuitive to me.\n\nTrust in the program, I say. It's way better than in decades past, and I'm excited when I see my Bears have a winning season, which we are heading toward if we keep pushing hard!",

Corners and safeties looked ineffective all day. They tackle after the catch but don't break up passing like they should.  \n\n\nI blame the qb situation on coaching. 5 QBs on the roster. A competent OC or QB coach should be able to make one of them work. Shapen's stats keep getting worse. Comp percentage may get below 50% by the end of the season. Seems like his head isn't clear.",

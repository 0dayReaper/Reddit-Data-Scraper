Scheduled an interview a couple of weeks later, went down, and the admissions counselor asked why I was there! I thought you had to interview like the other colleges in the Northeast I was looking at. Dude went and fished out my application, looked it over in front of me, and told me I was admitted.\n\nThankfully I didn\u2019t get in anywhere else! \u270a\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b",

He got his about 4 weeks later in mid December but I got mine January 11th. I think it depends on how competitive your major is. Baylor is mainly a science school so it does take a bit longer for science people to get their decisions back because there are so many people that want to do something STEM related at Baylor.",

I was supposed to be a Government Relations Advocate for an NGO in Ghana, but that was cancelled due to the pandemic\u2026. I moved back in with my parents for 8 months with no job. I was sad. Then I found a random job COVID testing for a robotics company in Austin, TX, worked my way up to an operations manager position, and stayed there for about a year and a half. Now I work for a construction technology company in Austin that 3D prints houses and is on the forefront of changing the world of construction. I\u2019m really enjoying it and I think I\u2019ve tapped into a company that\u2019s really going to change the world.",

Build a cash fortress. Because someday, life happens and you\u2019ll need a buffer. Don\u2019t buy fancy cars until you can buy it in cash. No big purchases.

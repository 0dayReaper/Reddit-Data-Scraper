    "postText": "Yo, I got accepted about 3 months ago and I am deathly scared of submitting my final high school transcript. School ends tomorrow.\n\nI am only failing one class, AP Bio with a 60 due to my negligence. \n\nI am barely passing the rest of the classes with a C or a low B. The only A I have is in art.\n\nI have taken a total of 6 AP courses during my senior year. So I hope my negligence can at least be passed as I took a really rough course this year.\n\nI already paid the 500$ admission fee, submitted my stuff through the Baylor portal, and signed the roommate housing agreement and I am currently trying to search for a roommate.\n\nI am balls deep in the process, so I hope I won't get rescinded for my decision.\n\nThoughts?",

No going back now unless you don\u2019t graduate. \n\nI don\u2019t intend to lecture here, but you do understand that college courses can be significantly more involved than high school AP classes? Mix that with the lack of structure of high school and if you aren\u2019t diligent you may just be wasting money by attending. I obviously don\u2019t know your circumstances, but speaking from my own experience, I cost myself money by not being focused on school from the start and I was like you and took all AP or dual credit classes my senior year. I graduated from Baylor, but had to do some soul searching 3 semesters in after being out on probation to really turn things around. Learn from me, start off strong.",

The hardest thing for me was understanding that while I was only in class for a few hours each day, the remaining time I should have filled with either studying or being involved. I graduated nearly 7 years ago and the most successful of my peers aren\u2019t necessarily the ones that had the best grades, but those that had the best school-life balance. You\u2019ll never meet more people and build more quality relationships than in college. Don\u2019t burn bridges. Find who you are and what you enjoy. Grades are important, but they\u2019re not the only thing.\n\nEdit: Feel free to DM me. I remember this time in my life and all the emotions and uncertainty that came with it. I\u2019d be happy to discuss anything you\u2019d like and provide any guidance I can.",

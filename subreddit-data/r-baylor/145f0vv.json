    "postText": "Hello! I am a psychology transfer student (female) going into my sophomore year and need a little advice on which dorms to choose (UParks is full). As a transfer student coming from Canada I really prefer to live on campus as I will be able to be around a community of people all of the time. I am wondering which residence halls are good that have a good social community. Right now I am looking at Brooks College as my first option as they supposedly have a tight knit community. I am a very social person hoping to make tons of friends and am wondering which dorm would be the best fit for me. Thank you so much :)",

She has indeed made a great group of lifelong friends. She\u2019s been to some of their weddings and many came to hers.  (She met her husband at Brooks!)  If you are social and want a tight knit group of friends I trust you will find it there.",

I was never close to my freshman roommate, but I met a large group of people freshman year. Ended up liking some of the guys enough that we lived together in the dorms, and then off campus as well. We've all been groomsmen at each other's weddings and I still keep up with them. Depends on if you get lucky and try to find people you like.",

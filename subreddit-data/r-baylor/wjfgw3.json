I know he's been hurt for what seems like half a decade, I really hope he doesn't tease us with brilliance and then get immediately hurt again",

Standout defensive leaders like Pitre also gone.\n\nIs that enough to warrant being behind OU, who always seems to be brimming with 4* and 5* recruits? Idk.\n\nSubjectively, I think we reload well on both sides of the ball, and excellent play by both lines gives us a ton of breathing room for the new starters to get acclimated.",

(comaring Shapen to Gabriel)\n\ngood point. yeah, looking at the roster I didnt realize we lost that many skill position guys. to be fair those are the guys who can come as freshman and produce unlike the lines and (most of the time) QBs",

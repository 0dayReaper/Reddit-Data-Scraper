            "comment": "Gary Ross is not a very great teacher he was ultra boring and we talked about nothing important during our classes (we talked about random stuff not even the readings we were supposed to be doing. By the middle of the semester you will learn that no one does the reading and he always says he is going to give \"pop quizzes\" but is too lazy to make them and you will never have any. There are four essays and he only grades on grammar not content, he doesn't care if your paper is late either since it will take him a month or two to grade the essays. The final two essays he gave everyone I knew in the class including me 95's which was a nice boost to our grade since the first two essays were graded very tough.",

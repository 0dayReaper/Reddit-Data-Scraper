LEAD, HRC, and Impact have the tightest communities. I\u2019d also take community over \u201cniceness\u201d of the hall. Once you stuff is all unpacked you won\u2019t notice that the rooms are dated anyway.",

Also for your first semester final project you will need to use the teal tool shop. If your worried about the 2 year contract it seems super easy to get out.",

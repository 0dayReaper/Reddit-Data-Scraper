I was a senior, we made it to March Madness, and I got the college experience of \u201cstanding in line in the rain outside the Ferrel Center to ensure that I got my tickets in the student section for a lower price\u201d*\n\nIndeed, none of the fun parts of \u201cbeing there,\u201d had anything to do with watching basketball. Whole viewing experience was horrible.\n\n*when Baylor tickets, for any sport were usually swipe your ID, or Baylor was handing out free tickers anyways.",

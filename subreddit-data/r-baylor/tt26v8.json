I would like to know if you have any suggestions for me as a I apply for housing. \n\nI would like my own single bed room. Where do you suggest I apply for housing (not honors).\n\nThanks in advance for all your help!",

Don\u2019t be afraid of having a roommate, it\u2019s not as bad as you expect. \n\nThat being said, you\u2019ll get your own bedroom in brooks, brooks flats, and anything in north village. Those do fill up quickly though.\n\nAlso don\u2019t worry about public restrooms. Imo they\u2019re actually more private than the shared ones (you get a little room to shower in rather than having it open to your roommates). \n\nI\u2019d go for the community that interests you the most. If you like to party or want to rush, Penland, Martin, and Collins will be your best bet. If you want some \u201ccleaner\u201d fun, anything else. Just pick your flavor. \n\nI lived in LEAD for several years and loved it. It\u2019s a good program and it\u2019s an excellent way to make friends. \n\nBest of luck to you!",

            "comment": "You will be able to find a single bed room! This was one of my high priority things going into freshman year because I have sleep paralysis and didn\u2019t want to freak out a roommate. You should research online which dorms have which types of rooms, some of them are CLLs but all you have to do is act like you are interested in the activity. I lived in Heritage house in a single suite with a bathroom I shared with 1 other girl and a living room that I shared with  3 other girls. My room was great and it was nice to have my own private space.  If this is a big concern for you, you can contact the office of Campus Living and Learning and explain your anxieties about sharing a room, they were super accommodating to me.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of your gender, but the dorms I would recommend for anyone looking for a single room are:\nHeritage house, Earle, Brooks Flats (tons of single rooms), Texana, and University House.\n\nGood luck! Let me know if you need any more help!",

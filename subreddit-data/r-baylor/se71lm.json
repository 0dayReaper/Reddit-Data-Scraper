            "comment": "First off, congratulations! \n\nIf you're not from/haven't spent a lot of time in Texas I highly recommend you eat some barbeque in Waco while you're there.\n\nI unfortunately haven't been in Waco in a few years but Vitek's, Tony DeMaria's, and Jasper's were all excellent when I was a student. You can't go wrong with Rudy's off of 35, either.\n\nEdit: In addition to exploring our campus, if the weather is nice I also recommend taking a walk north of campus and checking out the area around our football stadium. The grounds are gorgeous, and you can go to a football game for free this fall if you're interested!",

            "comment": "- if you like zoos, Waco has an awesome one. its also just a nice safe shaded cool place to go, yearly passes are $45 and come with some guest passes. strongly suggest it. they allow outside food in as well.\n\n\n- fuzzy friends is a rescue on the edge of town. friday or maybe saturday is kitten day where they let all the kittens under 6 months out to play in the cat room, its a really fun time. they're always looking for volunteers.\n\ncity events.\n-\n- idk what its like post covid, but the city holds a lot of festivals and events that are not advertised to students much but tons of fun. worth keeping a city calendar bookmarked.\n\n- farmers markets is really legit. I live in austin and i strongly prefer the one in waco over any place in Austin.",

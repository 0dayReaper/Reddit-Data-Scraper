Looking for experiences and pros and cons and if you'd recommend. I've read that classes are small for engineering, but I kind of would like that more focused attention. Also, how is basic living, food, and the Waco area?",

If you go to a lot of state schools, you will be just a number. I still keep in regular contact with my professors. During school, they provided me with a great deal of help and mentorship. \n\nBasic living and housing is good. You\u2019ll want to live in Teal Residential College, which is where the engineering students live. It\u2019s a great way to get to know your fellow students.",

            "comment": "Rising ECE junior here. I absolutely adore Baylor and the engineering department. Every ECE professor I\u2019ve had has been personally invested in seeing their students succeed, and while there will always be a couple bad eggs in the bunch, I\u2019ve gone so far without running into any of them.\nThe classes are smaller, even compared to the Mechanical program, but it\u2019s great if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nThe engineering department has its own dedicated career center representatives to give resume advice and help you seek out internships and jobs. My internship this summer was a direct product of their help. Your professors also have lots of industry experience, and are usually more than happy to field questions or talk advice.\n\nThe small classes mean it\u2019s easier to form bonds with your classmates - especially if you choose to live in Teal, the ECS hall! Living with other people in your field is a unique experience that I highly recommend.\n\nAs for cons, most math classes you\u2019ll take\u2026 aren\u2019t great. From what I\u2019ve heard Baylor likes to place the experienced math professors in higher classes and leave the general classes applicable to us to the unseasoned profs. Might be wrong. Definitely  doable though.",

You *could* make a Mac work, but you\u2019d end up using the computer labs a lot and you\u2019d probably need to dual boot Windows onto it or figure out an alternative for the comp sci credit. Definitely possible just a pain.\n\nSo I\u2019d recommend Windows, but as long as it meets the minimum specs you saw and isn\u2019t a chromebook/notebook or the like, it should do the trick!\n\nLmk if you have any other questions about ECS or Baylor at large!",

Be ready to grind your own personal projects if you want to stand out for internships/jobs.\n\nI heard some stat that only like 25% of kids graduate. If you come here, it will be made very clear that professors are purposefully trying to make you fail. \n\nPros are that the class sizes are small, but in relation to everything else, that is useless.",

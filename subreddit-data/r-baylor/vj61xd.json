Among other things, we're looking at average per-student credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that students have classes that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via study.\nWe appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Campus, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.\nOur team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.\n_________\n\nHope that helps",

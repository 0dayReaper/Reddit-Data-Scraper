After a far-too-rough first half, Baylor came out and played the game we all knew they could play. Penalties were better under control, and offensive play calling was much less one-dimensional. All in all, a pretty good game for the Bears!\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** Baylor looked real sluggish in that first half though. It was bad enough that FS1 was starting to put up graphics about what a Texas State win would mean, which is insulting enough. But when the Bobcats called a timeout just before half because they think they can stop you and put more points on the board? You know you're not on your game. Luckily we made the adjustments we needed at the half!\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* The Baylor offense loves making these picks easy for me. If you don't think Richard Reese was the best offensive player on the field today, you're straight up wrong. The man rushed 19 times for 156 yards, three touchdowns, and he even had a reception for 17 more. \n * *Defense:* Al Walcott gets the nod for the second time in three games. He was in on 9 tackles, 4 of them solo, including two for a loss. And he forced the first fumble recovered by the Baylor defense this season. Once again, he was quietly the best player on the field. Sic 'em, Al!\n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* I've said this before, but it really doesn't get much better than a footrace for a long touchdown. Richard Reese took it 52 yards to the house in the 4th quarter to all but seal the deal for Baylor, and it was by far the most exciting play in the game.\n * *Defense:* After a statement touchdown from the offense to close out the 1st half, Baylor's defense stepped up on the first drive of the 3rd quarter to force a fumble and recover it, fully taking the initiative and momentum in the game.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** Baylor continues to face the perrenial struggle of sluggish first halves, only to come out and dominate in the second. We showed that we can absolutely control penalties and unneccesary loss of yards, something that will be very important for Big 12 play. And Shapen is absolutely capable of passing, and even completing passes. Some of them even for positive yards and touchdowns!\n\n* **Next Week:** Playtime's over. Baylor travels to Ames to pay a visit to the Cyclones of Iowa State and open up Big 12 play. The 'clones are coming off a very impressive win against Iowa and at the time of this writing is leading Ohio 30-3, so this should be a good game!\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** Following no one winning last week's pickem, we have two winners this week! Our first winner is /u/FriskyHippoSlayer with a prediction of [Baylor, 42-10](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xf0l1x/football_pickem_cupcake_round2_edition_17_baylor/iojr510/). Our second winner is /u/chowsey1, with a prediction of [Baylor, 45-10](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xf0l1x/football_pickem_cupcake_round2_edition_17_baylor/iojz1sj/). Congrats to you both!\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add? Comments? Concerns? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks, and sic' em Bears!*",

It's WRs that can't get separation.\n\nShapen threw a dime for a would-be TD without the egregious no call PI. Had other excellent throws to Holmes and Fleeks when they actually managed to get open.",

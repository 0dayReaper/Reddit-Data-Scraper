    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm a current high school senior and was recently accepted into both Baylor and UC Merced. I'm considering both of these schools to commit to ASAP, and in the long run, I hope to go to med school, so I'd appreciate any insight about what I should do financially.\n\nAt Baylor, I got in for Health Science Studies under the pre-med track. I was also awarded a 72k scholarship split over 4 years (18k/yr), but that would still make my cost of attendance a little under 50k. \n\nI was accepted at UCM as a cog sci major and didn't receive any financial aid (my family doesn't qualify for it), but its cost of attendance is far lower at about 35k as an in-state resident. \n\nI've researched the pros and cons of both schools and love the research opportunities that they respectively provide, so my question is, is Baylor's education worth the expense of a couple extra thousand compared to the lower, more affordable price of being in-state at UC Merced?\n\nThank you all so much!",

The community seems so much better here, and I'm definitely getting the same level of education as my UC friends(even in engineering) , but having a lot more fun.",

So glad I chose Baylor for my undergraduate degree. I think spending the extra 15K is more than worth it for the above aspects I mentioned and even more.",

            "comment": "Go with the school that costs less.\n\nI essentially only paid for room and board for my three and a half years at Baylor, and my monthly student loan payments would be $850 dollars if there wasn't currently a pause on federal loans. Add to that the fact that during my time at Baylor, something like one in four people who started off pre-med dropped it by the time they graduated. Taking on an extra $15 grand turns out to be a lot more expensive if you're not that one in four.\n\nI'd also add that I grew up on the west coast, and the culture shock between there and Texas was much greater than when I studied abroad in Europe. That's an important factor that's worth considering as well.\n\nIf you're not keenly aware of just *how* focused the institution is on cultivating a particular kind of faith (i.e. conservative capitalist evangelicals) Baylor is, I would consider that as an important factor as well.",

I am now a physician earning over a $300k salary a year, plus benefits. So it paid for itself. I would definitely recommend Baylor, but not sure I'd do medicine all over again. It's a lot of work and stress for that $300k!!! :-)",

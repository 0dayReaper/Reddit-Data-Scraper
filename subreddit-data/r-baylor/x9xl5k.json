    "postText": "I wrote on here awhile back, and only got recommended to apply to the military to pay for school.\n\nI owe $3400 to Baylor by the time I register. This bill is really only my housing. I cannot guarantee I will have rent every month. \n\nI am at risk for homelessness if I do not go to Baylor. I'm an out of state student and couldn't even go home this past summer because there is no room for me at home. My parents are in a bad situation. \n\nLong story short, we have struggled to get by my whole life. It's a miracle I've made it this far in Baylor (3rd semester). I've applied to 13 loans, 5 scholarships... and financial aid tells me there is nothing they can do, since they cannot help with 100% of my need. I DO NOT NEED 100% fulfilled!! I just want some help! \n\nI am beyond frustrated and struggling to concentrate on my classes, much less my homework. At this point, my only option is canceling housing and sleeping on campus somewhere (if you have recommendations, let me know...)\n\nPlease let me know of any emergency grants, scholarships, loans, etc. that do not require credit checks. Our credit sucks, obviously.\n\nI apologize if my tone comes across as mean or whatnot, but I have been dealing with this for three months. I feel like I worked entirely too hard in high school (5.54 GPA, 3rd in my class) to be at this point in college. I'm sure others have it worse than I do, but I have no clue what to do. \n\nHere's a list of scholarships/loans I've applied for:\n\n \n\nSallie Mae\n\nDiscover\n\nParent PLUS - also applying for additional unsubsidized loans\n\nAscent\n\nFundingU\n\nSoFi\n\nCollege Ave\n\nPNC Bank\n\nEarnest\n\nCitizens\n\nCredible\n\nEdly\n\nI have also applied to the following scholarships and have been declined:\n\nStudent Foundation Scholarships\n\nFirst in Line Leadership Scholarship (also reached out for additional assistance, and they have not responded. I did not have luck with First in Line in Spring 2022)\n\nDepartmental scholarships\n\nI applied to various outside scholarships on websites, but did not receive a response for any. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA",

Tell them you are on the verge of homelessness and/or dropping out because of this financial hardship. They should be able to connect you to *potential* solutions. Nothing is a guarantee, but given the circumstances, every option is worth pursing (except any kind of payday loan situation. It is better to take time off from college than get sucked down that cycle of infinite debt).\n\n- schedule another meeting with financial aid and explain clearly that this means you will be homeless/dropout of the university. They should be able to connect you to resources/services of some kind. I don't work at Baylor, so I don't know exactly what that might be, but every college has systems in place to mitigate issues like this.",

As much as possible, be calm and clear with your needs. Be as thankful and courteous as possible. Don't raise your voice or lose your temper, which I know could be difficult given the seriousness of the situation and how frustrating the world feels.\n\nI've worked at a number of different institutions, and people would be really surprised at how far staff are willing to go to help a student in need, especially if that student is nice/thankful for the help. I'm not saying grovel by any means, but temperament and how you present yourself in these meetings does matter.",

Apparently, you can enroll in the military but if you have health conditions like asthma or adhd, you won't get deployed out of the US. And this is only a summer thing. You get $50,000 upfront and $5,000 every month that you're in med school. Every summer during med school, you'll be deployed in the US. I used to be like you and avoid anything military, but this would actually help me alot during med school. And you get military benefits.

I met a lot of cool people on my floor by hosting Mario Kart parties on the weekends for example, plus gaming was something me and my roommate could relate about and was a chill way for us to hang and decompress.",

Never had any problems with online connections on the console using airbear, and pc/steam stuff does fair too. I also have a hotspot on my phone just in case anything gets dodgy but I've only ever had to use it inside of the BSB because airbear is less reliable in there. When I lived in penland I never had to use the hotspot at all except on the maintenance days which are rare.",

For the dorm, a generous meal plan and 17 hours of coursework per semester, my tuition was roughly 16k a year. Back then that was expensive but overall good bang for the buck private school. The administration started the rate hike in 2002 as part of their Baylor 2012 vision of becoming a tier 1 institution.  They built a ton new buildings during this time but actually FELL in their rankings. Tier 1 isn\u2019t based on fancy buildings. It\u2019s based on professors and research publications/ quality. Baylor is very strict on hiring Christian professors so it limits their pool. They wanted to loosen this rule but the Southern Baptist convention threatened to pull their funding. \n\nIf I could choose today, Baylor wouldn\u2019t be in my top choice. It\u2019s ranked overall well but for the price tag, I would aim for a public university in similar rankings.",

Many degrees would not justify the amount of debt and cost to obtain them.  Simply put, there is no career that would pay you back for some of these degrees.\n\nBut education is important, and it is often the cost of not getting an education is higher than the the actual cost of a degree.\n\nAll I can offer is this.   Find every way you can to lower the cost.  Transfer in classes. Take things online.  Slow it up if need be.   But negotiate down that price at every chance you get.\n\nAnd above all, get a degree in something that creates economic opportunity.",

Multigenerational Baylor grad here, and having just gone through the college application process with the next generation, I can assure you that Baylor provides no additional benefit to your future resume. It is not a prestigious school. It is a \u201cvery fine and ok\u201d undergraduate education. In the business world, no one will care where you did your undergraduate education. If you plan to go to med school, nursing school, or law school, it does have a decent reputation for preparing you for those careers. From just a financial perspective, you should go where they give you the most money. Graduation with $200k in undergrad debt is profoundly stupid (not an insult, just a real life fact.) Trinity, SW, Austin College, TCU, Rhodes, Tulane, Rice (if your grades are good) etc. are all willing to give you money if you ask. Baylor is hip deep in money but they aren\u2019t spending it on scholarships (see new building comments above)\n\nprotip for anyone applying in the future: if multiple schools accept you, get their admissions departments into bidding wars with one another. We were able to squeeze out an additional al $10k/year just by saying \u201cwell, College X gave me this\u2026can you beat it?\u201d Even up to the last minute (like 1 hour before deadline) we had the financial aid folks offering more and more cash.",

If you actually want to maximize your scholarship 1. Apply early and submit all of your application items 2. Complete your FAFSA &amp; CSS (even if you won't be eligible for need based aid) 3. Just ask. Seriously. If they know of any opportunities for additional scholarship, your counselor will just tell you. \n\nAlso, the fancy new buildings across campus are donor funded and have nothing to do with scholarship allocation at all. Aside from \"consider transferring\" and \"don't take out 200k in loans for your undergrad degree\", that comment is full of misinformed claims and genuinely bad advice.",

It is exceptionally good advice, and I can\u2019t understand why you would suggest otherwise. Every one of the schools I listed above (Baylor not included\u2026.Baylor offered zero) was offering more money through the week prior to decision time except Rice, who already offered a generous package. Are you insinuating that the schools would somehow withdraw aid if you asked for additional funds? Please share with the class where your wisdom comes from. Also, you are quite right, technically, that the funds from scholarships do not directly commingle with funds for physical plant improvements. It was intended as a general comment on what Baylor values most, and if you haven\u2019t noticed the changes to the campus over the last 20 years, it is profoundly obvious where the shekels are going.",

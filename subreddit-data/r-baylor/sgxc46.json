I\u2019ve never seen snow, so that\u2019s exciting, but also don\u2019t know how anything works. \nWill Baylor shut down if it snows? I\u2019m scared to walk to class if the cement is icy. I also want to enjoy the weather lol",

            "comment": "Chances are, if it ices/snows, Baylor will cancel class or your profs will cancel class. Too many students are from the south with little to no experience driving in this weather, and it\u2019s not a good idea to ask them to risk their lives for the sake of their grade. If not, I still recommend skipping class in this instance. You\u2019re on campus and walking is a lot safer than driving is for those living off-campus, but still",

I'd suggest stocking up a little on provisions just in case.  Unless you're in Teal, they didn't lose anything last time.  But yeah, if you're determined not to skip class, and they don't cancel it, bundle up.  If you have a skateboard, bike, scooter, or anything else you usually use to get around faster, leave it in favor of staying off the roads.  You might be a little later than usual, but it's better than breaking bones when EMS will be spread thin trying to deal with the entire town.",

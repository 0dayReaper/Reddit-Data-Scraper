I didn't really have high hopes for this game, but the fact that this was yet another game where we left points on the field and *could* have won made it particularly disappointing.\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** I'm repeating myself at this point, but this was the second game running that Baylor really could have won, and just didn't. We left points on the field, missed field goals, made silly mistakes that led to Longhorn points, and ultimately ended up losing a game that was within our reach.\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Josh Cameron gets the nod today. 4/7 with 48 yards makes him the most impressive offensive player on the day. \n * *Defense:* Yet again, Al Walcott makes the list. 6 solo tackles with 1 sack and 2 forced fumbles means he was by far the most active defensive threat. \n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Easy choice here! At 06:54 in the 1st, Blake Shapen threw the best pass of his game today to Jaylen Ellis for 47 yards and a touchdown. It gave me hope that Baylor could really make a game, and apparently it had the same effect on the Longhorns. Unfortunately, that didn't last. \n * *Defense:* Bet you can guess! Baylor's 4th quarter scoop-n-score was the most impressive defensive play on the day. Quinn Ewers was hurried by Gabe Hall, who forced a fumble and had the presence of mind to scoop that sucker up instead of falling on it, returning it for 17 yards and 6 points. The icing on the cake was the successful 2-pt conversion afterward!\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** Baylor has a *lot* of work to do while we wait for our bowl berth. This was a disappointing end to a season that could've been a lot better. I do believe that we were given much more benefit of the doubt than we strictly deserved pre-season, but even so a .500 regular season is not wonderful. Let's see what the coaches can do as we prepare for a bowl game.\n\n* **Next Week:** We have no Baylor Football to look forward to until learning our bowl berth. Stay tuned to the subreddit for the latest update!\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** Today's pickem winner is /u/IpswichWarriors with a prediction of [Texas, 35-24](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/z301av/football_pickem_give_thanks_edition_baylor_bears/ixkzhwz/). Congratulations, you win Reddit Premium (and spiffy flair)!\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add? Comments? Concerns? Let me know in the comments below or send me a DM. Sic 'em, Bears!*",

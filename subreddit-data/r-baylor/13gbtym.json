    "postText": "I\u2019m here looking for advice. I just finished freshman year as a Pre Business student. First semester, i had a 2.64 GPA mostly due to just partying too much and not caring. I rushed and pledged this spring (got academic forgiveness for the low gpa) and my GPA was around a 3.4 when it was done, and i was still safe for the 3.0 cumulative to stay in the business school.\n\nAround this time, I started to experience mental health problems, and i got very very very lazy and in motivated, skipped classes, accidentally skipped tests, started smoking lots of weed, and missed homework. I ended this semester failing 3 classes because of attendance and earning a D in the 4th. Yes, I had a 0.40 GPA and my cumulative is 1.74.\n\nI am very depressed about the whole situation and I am wondering what there is to do. Am i stuck taking summer classes to barely get into a Comms major, or is there any type of way, forgiveness, or option for me to even have a shot at staying in the business school. Throughout most of my life i usually scored all As and this semester was just a very very low time in my life. I feel like telling my counselor i was depressed will not be enough though. Plz help.",

Take some time off and spend some time with good influences. Get a job you like that helps you grow and reprioritize. Strategize for how to return to college and succeed when you are ready. You're making bad decisions, and it sounds like you need deep self reflection and big changes to start making good ones again. You have incredible potential. I wish you the best as you figure out who you are and refocus your life.",

He came home and went to a community college (where they also recognized his academic probation status btw) where he took two classes and a mandatory one for all probation students.   No denying it sucked \u2014 but the highlight of the story is how it ended.  He did not go back to finish undergrad there but he did return for his MBA and that was a proud moment.   He took the longer, harder route but ended up exactly where he wanted to be.   Good luck to you.",

            "comment": "This is a tough situation that has no singular answer, however much I'd kill to give it. I've gone through times in my life where I felt so pathetic, I put no effort into anything and it took me over a year to get out of it. However, what is most important now isn't what you did yesterday or the day before, but what you are going to do right now to fix it. Not in 10 minutes, not in a few days, but as soon as you physically can. Speaking purely from my own experience, there are three keys to getting out of this.\n\n1. Don't procrastinate, and if you absolutely have to procrastinate ALWAYS do something productive while you are. If you should be studying for test, do that, but if you are staring at a screen for 20 minutes doing nothing, rather than falling into a spiral of depression do small, productive things. Take a shower, shave, clean around the apartment, study for a different class, etc. Don't be afraid to tell other friends/roommates to make you be accountable.\n2. Giving excuses is fine, but only if you have a solid plan of how you are going to fix it. You are entirely right telling your counselor that you are depressed won't be enough, they here that too many times to count. Instead, make a list by the end weekend of things you are going to do to fix your behaviors, how you are going to make this right. Then, next to each step, write things you have actually completed to achieve these steps. If you haven't achieved anything towards these steps yet, get started, so you have documented success.\n3. Find your vices and replace them. Most people have vices(smoking weed) at some point not because they enjoy them, but because it allows them to avoid what they are scared of seeing/doing. Find partners in your battles/struggles, whether it be study partners, professional counseling, or friends. You aren't in this alone, and if you are, there is no reason for you to be. \n\nStay strong! You are in a tough situation, but what shows courage and commitment is not how we fail, but rather how we overcome and stand back up when we are bleeding and battered on the ground. Fight until they kick you out. Ask for recommendations from every professor you are close to if you have to. Don't touch weed again if it's holding you back. Make sure every person you talk to is someone is trying to achieve greatness, as being around greatness will make you great yourself. Don't despair, never lose hope. Fight till you are proud, of yourself even if no one else will be.",

Also, I don't care what anyone says, it's not too late to transfer back into Pre-Business once you clean up your GPA.\n\nAs you move forward, please look into the Baylor Success Center for Academic Mentoring and/or Coaching. https://case.web.baylor.edu/student-resources/academic-resources",

I don\u2019t know the resources, but one of the docs on campus gave me a low dose of Ritalin, and I re-took classes which I had failed. Did this in the summer sessions. Don\u2019t be embarrassed. Or keep it secret, who cares.\n2.\tYou need to retake the classes. Don\u2019t worry about ANYTHING but getting an A in each one. Period. No drinking, no weed, no TV, no social media, nothing but focus on school. If you can\u2019t do this for the summer, then, well, your decision about your future is made for you. This is your Eminem one shot; do not miss your chance.\n3.\tDitch the Greek organization for the summer, unless there are members who are serious about studying and helping you. If no one is willing, maybe you need to consider if that group is worth paying money to be friends with.\n4.\tDont give up! Trust me, I\u2019m sitting here at 48 with a fistful of shit-ass grades from the 90s, trying to find a way to finish off my degree. I basically have to start over.\n\nFinally, DO NOT LEAVE BAYLOR WITH F\u2019S ON YOUR TRANSCRIPT. If you can help it. Finances and what not might dictate the outcome, but if you can afford it, wipe those F\u2019s off even if you think you\u2019ll never go back. Again, trust me. Listen to the elder dipshit who didn\u2019t listen to HIS elders!\n\nSend me a chat if you want to talk it out.",

There are plenty of options to get by in the meantime and there are plenty of other careers that don't require school. You're in a bad spot, but its only recoverable if you really want it. So ask yourself if you really want it and are you willing to prioritize school over friends, video games, chicks, whatever. If you're not, then dont waste your time and money. You can always do school later. Id recommend sooner than later, but its more important to do it when you know you won't quit.",

Panicking I ran over to the lecture hall and realized that not only have I never been, but there is a FINAL today. It\u2019s my last semester before graduation so if I fail I\u2019m not going to graduate. Dread completely overcomes me. \n\nThen I wake up, 14 years after graduating. \n\nGets me every damned time.",

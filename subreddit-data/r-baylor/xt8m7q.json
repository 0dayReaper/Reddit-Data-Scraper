It\u2019s not the most heartbreaking win, but there\u2019s very little to say about this performance. It was honestly some of the worst football I\u2019ve seen from the Bears in the last several years. I\u2019ll give credit where it was due, Baylor didn\u2019t quit and nearly swung momentum several times, but there were just too many dropped passes, mental mistakes, missed tackles, and poor play calling. \n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** Fundamentals. Contain the quarterback. Minimize yards-after-contact on defense. Try *not* to let the opposing team get a 98-yard kick return for a touchdown. Catch passes. Just a sloppy, sloppy game by the Bears.\t\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Monaray Baldwin was one of the only Bears who had a more-than-decent performance. He actually carried the team with his 167 yards receiving for 2 TDs, including a 70 yarder. \n * *Defense:* Again, this one goes to a player who was one of the only ones on his side of the ball who looked like he gave a damn. Dillon Doyle  was a force to be reckoned with today, 6 solo tackles and psychological pressure on the Pokes offense. *Honorable Mention:* Christian Morgan with a momentum-swinging INT and a forced fumble.\n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Monaray Baldwin\u2019s 70 yard TD reception on 4th and 5 was the obvious choice. Especially compared to the rest of the game, this was absolutely a statement play.\n * *Defense:* On the defensive side of the ball, Christian Morgan\u2019s INT of Spencer Sanders was a momentum changer. It\u2019s too bad Baylor couldn\u2019t fully capitalize on these momentum swings.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** This team has a lot of growth ahead of them. Again, we saw flashes of greatness throughout the game, but we never came together with a cohesive performance. I continue to believe the system will produce results, and Aranda &amp; Co are still doing a fantastic job. But we\u2019re not there yet. And when our game plan is disrupted, either by the opposing team\u2019s skill or our own missed chances, we don\u2019t seem to have the ability to weather the storm yet. \n\n* **Next Week:** Baylor has an extended chance to think about this performance as they take a bye week. The Bears return to action in Morgantown, West Virginia on October 13th to take on the Mountaineers.\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** This week\u2019s pickem winner is /u/FriskyHippoSlayer, with a prediction of [Oklahoma State, 31-28.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xqln5a/football_pickem_home_opener_edition_%E2%81%B9_oklahoma/iqa0h1l/) Congrats on your second win this season!\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add?

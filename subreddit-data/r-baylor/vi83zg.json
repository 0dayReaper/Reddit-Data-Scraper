    "postText": "Hello, I'm looking to join and pursue a master in CS. Those of you who are going through the program either online or in person. How is it? How much coding experience did you have before hand and in what language? My advisor told me Java and C++ were very important. Let me know your experience. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, those who have graduated, how have you done post graduation? Was it easy to find rewarding employment?",

The program is VERY rigorous and has high expectations of you, but I got a really good job and salary because of my project. Both Java and C++ are important (I had a few years of both), as well as Python. It\u2019s a more practical program - if you do not have a lot of programming experience, do not sign up. Feel free to DM if you have other questions.",

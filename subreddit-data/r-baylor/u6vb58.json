The actual acceptance numbers aren't published for privacy reasons by BU, but the university has definitely garnered this reputation for a reason.\n\nI don't know the mcat scores, sorry! I hope someone comes along who does!",

            "comment": "Idk the stats but baylor is great for premed especially if you want to med school in Texas. Aim for at least a 3.7 GPA and get involved in extracurricular research and I'd say your odds are greater than 50% as long as your mcat is above 500. Higher GPA and higher mcat obviously increases your chance.",

            "comment": "r/premed is a decent resource for when you start applying. You can post your app stats there and people will give you feedback. \n\nWhen you start applying, MSAR is a good tool to check median MCAT and GPA of accepted applicants at schools you\u2019re applying to. Usually 510+ is considered decent for MD schools. \n\nBaylor\u2019s premed committee does a decent job of helping you plan out prereqs. They\u2019re pretty honest about if you\u2019ll be a good candidate for med school during junior year as well. \n\nNot sure how far along you are, but if you\u2019re an underclassman one of the best things you can do for your future app is do well in classes and learn the material well!\n\nEdit: I also want to add that MCAT and GPA aren\u2019t everything! But they are crucial pieces of your app",

    "postText": "We accidentally missed the deadline for submitting the CSS last year (school year 21-22) and potentially a lot of scholarship money through Baylor. We figured we would make sure to get everything in on time for next year. Nope, apparently they only take into account the freshman year of the student to qualify for that money. We got by this year by taking loans from retirement accounts. That can't continue to happen. The plan now is to submit for all kinds of additional scholarships and hope for the best. Anyone with any other suggestions?",

If that doesn\u2019t work (or if you\u2019ve already tried), go online to the appeals page and fill out an appeal for additional need based aid and list out the reasons/why you need more (draining retirement, job lost for covid, etc.) and they might give you more money! I did that twice and got a few extra thousand each year!",

            "comment": "Also, if anything crazy ever happens and the student has medical bills, car repairs, etc. they have a student emergency fund scholarship! I think the max award is $1000 each year and is case by case basis, but it can help with unexpected costs! Finally, the baylor textbook scholarship can be applied for and will help pay for textbooks that can get really expensive! Hope this helps!",

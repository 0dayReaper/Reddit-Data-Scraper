Do you think it is late to apply now? their website application at gobaylor doesnt ask for gpa or sat scores. they only ask to know where you studied and why you should join baylor so id also like to know if they ask for them later or something",

If anything, call Baylor and they should be able to give the information you need. \n\nIf it\u2019s too late, apply anyways, you never know.\n\nAs for SAT/ACT, Baylor is test blind so they won\u2019t require it, but if you think it will help your application (you got a 1600 on the SAT as an extreme example).\n\nGood luck on your application, I hope you are successful!",

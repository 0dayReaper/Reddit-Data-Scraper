    "postText": "I received Verto Bears about 3 months ago, but I have that I am qualified to begin studies at Baylor for Pre-Dent. I'm confused on how I got deferred and wondering if it's possible I'll get in regular decision by the 10th. \n\nMaybe because I submitted my score, and before I got a decision filled a form saying I wanted it removed and wanted to go test optional?\n\nEssentially I was test optional but they did see my low test score probably at one point.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "They are giving you a chance to do this program instead of going straight in in the fall. You can still get in by the tenth regular decision however. I M highly suspicious of this however. Can\u2019t see how spending 30k on basically a summer camp type experience in Costa Rica during the fall makes you somehow ready for Baylor in the spring   Doing this program does not mean you are admitted to Baylor at all but instead they say you can potentially transfer if you do well enough at the Costa Rican summer camp in the fall. Reviews online are bad. I can\u2019t believe an institution with Baylor\u2019s reputation would go in with a company like this that is obviously some sort of scam. Plus, who wants to go to Baylor and miss the first half of freshman year with Line Camp, running the Baylor line, forming friendships with the other freshman, etc.",

However, instead of just denying them, Baylor is offering a 'prove yourself' challenge for students that *really* want to come to Baylor. So if Student X really loves Baylor and wants to attend, they'll do a study abroad experience and then start school in the spring. In theory, they build friendships with all the other people doing the same program, so they don't show up in the spring completely alone.\n\nIt's not a scam, exactly, but it's hard to say it's a good value. Students in these programs get little to no scholarships from the school and miss out on college experiences, too. It's really  for students that only see themselves attending a specific school.",

Piecing it together they had a Fiji location which i assume because of covid rules was cancelled and the students who were going Fiji were then transferred to the Costa Rica location. So they had a lot more kids than were planned on there.  Even the employee complaints were from then as well.  It is not an old program. It started 2017ish. So it was only going for a couple years before covid which would have be extremely disrupting for this kind of thing. Its run through the University of New Haven.",

I am a current junior here so it was a bit different for me two years ago during covid. I think Baylor has gotten competitive this past year as they admitted a lot of students the other classes. About 45% got in for fall 2022 so moderately competitive. \n\nMaybe you can send in a letter of continued interest and see if the Adcom change your enrollment to fall semester.",

            "comment": "If they guarantee admission it could be a good thing.  You could do your whole freshman year or just  a semester abroad.  All the credits for the classes taken with Verto transfer to Baylor or to the 70 other Universities in the program in the US.    You can still graduate in 4 years.  It\u2019s probably less expensive than going to Baylor which full pay tuition with room and board is $68k.  Tuition and room and meals for the Costa Rica location is $19.5 a semester. Seville Spain is the $19.5 as well for tuition room and meals   All the other locations dont include meals or just some meals but they have kitchens.  Buenos Aires $19.5K, Prague $19.5k, Florence $23k and London is $29k.   It takes Fafsa and has scholarships, you can use 529 money  as well.  Im considering it for my daughter.   The classes are small at Verto, like 30 kids,  and she would get  credits for the undergrad classes she has to take that would otherwise  have 100\u2019s of kids in them given in auditoriums at University of Colorado, Boulder where she is accepted and is probably attending in the fall.  But I dont think she would do as well in the huge undergrad classes there.  Its fine when you get to the  upper level classes, they are much smaller of course.  Her classes at her school now have 10 kids max in them. It\u2019s kind of like a gap year but you still get useable credits.   She also likes to travel who doesnt.",

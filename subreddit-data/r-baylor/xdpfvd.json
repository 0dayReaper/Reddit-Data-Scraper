    "postText": "Hello all. I am almost done applying for Baylor and I want to get into ECE. I'm just below the calculus 1 requirements with a 26 ACT Math (requires 27) and SAT math of 610 (630 required). I took AP calculus last year and got a 2 but does that mean anything in terms of being able to enroll for Calculus 1 for pre-engineering? So far I just think ill have to either take the ALEKS test or enroll in precal. Lastly, this is probably a stupid question but I'm enrolling for Fall 2023 (haven't graduated High school yet) and I thought maybe I could take precal in the summer but then I thought can I even take classes before my enroll date? Any help is appreciated.",

    "postText": "Potential chem PhD student here. Looking at Baylor, but I have some hang ups. I\u2019m a pretty non-political and non-religious person so how hard of a time will I have trying to move to Baylor knowing nobody? I have no issues with political/religious friends but the vibe I get from Baylor is that it\u2019s pretty in your face. And along with that, what is the dating scene like? If you\u2019re a fairly liberal, agnostic person is there any chance you meet enough people there?\n\nAlso, what is the diversity like? Is it as overwhelmingly rich white kids at the school?\n\nObviously not the biggest things for graduate school but I would definitely like to know if I\u2019d be able to have a healthy social life if I choose Waco. Thanks!",

I hated how in your face it was as an undergrad and ended up being mostly friends with the grad students in my program because of it.",

It\u2019s definitely not in your face, especially as a graduate. \n\nDating scene is super weird. Lots of people looking to marry ASAP, and people are super high commitment. Your friends will get gf/bf and stop talking to you. Makes it hard to just go watch a movie or something with someone. Again probably less so at the graduate level. \n\nDiversity depends entirely on your perspective. To me it was pretty white, but I came from a pretty Hispanic area originally. Others have told me they find it very diverse. I find that most people aren\u2019t rich necessarily, mostly middle class. Regardless, I don\u2019t think that will affect your ability to socialize at all. \n\nIt\u2019s a solid school and you\u2019ll make really good friends I think. They tout the \u201cBaylor family\u201d thing hard, and it sounds cheesy but it\u2019s legit. Best of luck in your decision!",

            "comment": "As a chem PhD student, I doubt you'll even hear about religion except for maybe a prayer at graduation or if you ask someone about it. They might have a prayer at the start of football games. The college as a whole is probably slightly less diverse than the average Texas university, but in the science building, I'd say it's around 50% white. Baylor has only gotten more liberal over time, and in 2008, I moved in with a girl and stayed with her for 3 years, so I'd say as long as you don't have sex in public or something, you'll be perfectly fine.\n\nI'll also say, it's not uncommon for students to drive down to Austin to party on the weekends, though you can find plenty of parties near campus too.\n\nWhen I majored in biochem though, I'd say 75% of my friends were agnostic even though I was not and there were very few, if any issues. In the liberal arts, your experiences may vary though.",

Your GPA and SAT scores are higher than either of my kids with similar levels of extra curriculars.  I don't understand why you would've been rejected.  How is your class ranking?  I don't know how much they value that, but my kids' class rankings were both pretty high.  That's about the only thing I can think of.",

The university admitted too many freshmen this year, so for the upcoming year, they told us that they are simply letting in less students. It doesn't hurt to appeal, but c/o 2026 is going to be harder to get accepted simply based off the fact that they let too many in for 2025. Good luck",

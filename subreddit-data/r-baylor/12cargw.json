    "postText": "Hey everybody I\u2019m currently choosing which college I want to go to once I graduate high school and I\u2019m currently stuck between UC Merced and Baylor University. I would like to study Computer Science at either of the schools so I was wondering which one would be better. I\u2019m stuck between the two because I know UC Merced has great research opportunities but I also like a bigger campus and a city life and that\u2019s where Baylor comes in. I would also like to go out of state too which would be really nice.\n\nI got offered a pretty good amount of money to go to UC Merced where I have to pay around 5-10k a year and my major will be Computer Science and Engineering there. UCM would be in state for me and I\u2019ll be living on campus too.\n\nBaylor offered me a good amount of money too but my family cannot afford the amount since we have to pay around 20k to attend Baylor. I\u2019m planning on emailing them to see if I can get the cost down to at least 10k which will be great. Baylor has put me down as undeclared but I\u2019m planning to switch into Comp Sci and hopefully they\u2019ll let me switch. Also Baylor would be out of state for me, but I don\u2019t have a problem with going out of state.\n\nDisregarding the cost, which school is better for Comp Sci in general since I want to do something like software engineering or cybersecurity once I get out of college/How is each schools comp sci department?",

Getting out of state could be nice, but as long as you're not living with your parents the experience is about the same. I can't speak to the reputation of either schools program for comp sci. But I do know if I were in your shoes, I'd pick whichever is more affordable. Having little or no college debt is the thing that helped me most to surpass my high school friends in life. Mid to late 20s is hard right now because lots of job markets are saturated, housing is terribly inflated, and that's the age where you have to figure everything out (healthcare, bills, relationships). Honestly idk if I would have made it this far if I had a bunch of student debt.",

                    "comment": "I fully agree about picking whichever is more affordable - having little to no student debt is a gamechanger once you're working. I got into a pseudo-Ivy League school but opted instead to go to a much more affordable university in my state because I had nearly a full ride. Initially, as an 18 or 19 year old, I regretted not going to the big-name school (because I didn't know any better; the prestige sounded \"cool\"), but where I am now in life, I'm so glad I didn't put myself or my parents into enormous debt from attending that school. Education is education; great professors can be found at any university.\n\nAny school can be amazing if you're in a major you love and try to connect with your professors and campus-life. And not putting yourself into crippling debt makes your mid to late 20s so much easier. I promise you can get a good job no matter which school you choose here. Your experience and skills are really more important in job interviews than the school listed on your resume/CV.\n\nEdit: Also for what it's worth, I've noticed some of the CS faculty at Baylor are hard to work with and not overly friendly to students if you're not interested in the exact area of research they are. Biggest example is Dr. Pablo Rivas. But I've heard great things about Dr. Greg Hamerly, Dr. Greg Speegle, and Dr. Jeff Donahoo, though that doesn't mean their courses are easy, just that they're nice people and willing to help you.",

            "comment": "I graduated with a CS degree in 2016. I know nothing about UC Merced's program.\n\nThere are a few mediocre profs in the CS dept, but several truly stellar ones. When I was there, we probably had 1-5 students per year who really applied themselves and became top tier engineers at major companies you've heard of. My recollection is that I graduated with... 15-20 people? I might misremember.\n\nMy personal belief is that (above a minimal level of departmental competence) the main difference between \"top tier\" universities and \"mid tier\" ones is the students they attract/accept. The good news for you is: there's nothing stopping you from being the best student wherever you go.",

There are a wealth of IT jobs and demand for talent that can deliver solid results and grow their knowledge. A degree from either Baylor vs UC Merced will serve you well.\n\nA better question to ask is: how will I pay off my college debt. If debt from Baylor will be a boat anchor around your neck keeping you from living the life you want, you should forego Baylor in favor of another school.",

            "comment": "In-state vs out-of-state doesn't apply to private universities.\n\nIf Baylor is at all a stretch, go to UC Merced and save your money. You may investigate if you can transfer to a better UC campus in a year though. If you could graduate from a better UC campus, you could potentially have a better degree at lower cost. Especially since your interested in CS. Baylor is not a CS school. I assume many of the UC campuses have stronger tech programs and internship opportunities.",

            "comment": "Both CS programs are regarded about the same and I don't think either would give a big advantage over the other. Depending on region each school might be a bit more well known. CS is one of those majors that you get what you put into it. I have an internship with Amazon this summer that I mainly prepared with using leetcode. That is kinda the nature of the software engineering internship process. Look it up but that is your best way to land major internship offers.\n\nWith that said I think cost should be your biggest motivator. 5-10k is significantly better than 20k and I believe you'll thank yourself when you get older. If you can get Baylor to 10K then personally I would like Baylor more due to the culture but at that point its more personal preference. \n\nOne thing I can add is when you reach out to Baylor mention and show them your offer letter from UC Merced and say you would prefer Baylor but that the cost makes it hard for you. In my case this helped my get a higher offer letter from Baylor.",

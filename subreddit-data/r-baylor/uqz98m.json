    "postText": "Hi all, B.S. Biology '05 here. My kids all want to go to Baylor and at least a couple of them are leaning towards the business side of things, at this point, just general, well-rounded business, but one of them may go into sales. Since I hardly ever stepped foot in Hankamer and never took a business course, what do I need to know about business majors and the Business School?\n\nFrom my cursory research, it looks like BU offers majors in Economics, Accounting, \"Business Fellows,\" Entrepreneurship/Corporate Innovation, Management Information Systems,  Marketing, Professional Selling, Risk Management/Insurance, Supply Chain Management, \"Hankamer Scholars,\" Intl Business, HR Management, Management, and minors in Business Administration, Entrepreneurship, and Economics. Please tell me everything I need to know! ;-)",

            "comment": "Okay, you can go two routes for getting a \u201cbusiness\u201d degree at Baylor: getting a B.S./B.A. or BBA (these are the business majors everyone knows). \n\nB.S./B.A are degrees in economics, management etc that specialize in those topics but have very little requirements for general business courses (like accounting, MIS, HR, etc) \n\nBBA is a Bachelor in Business Administration aka all the basics you need to know to run a business, regardless of your major. It includes two years of core business classes (in which the student is called a pre-business major) such as financial accounting, managerial accounting, introduction to business, introduction to microeconomics, beginner MIS, etc. After two years the student declares a major (any of the majors you listed), and takes classes according to the path the student chooses. There are still some upper-level classes that are mandatory for all business majors but upperclassmen have mostly their major classes. \n\n\nBBA is very popular because it gives you all-around knowledge of the business world (accounting, marketing, management, etc) and real-life skills (like negotiating, making a resume, etc) beyond your major classes. It\u2019s also extremely popular to double-major since the core classes are  the same for all business majors, making the workload manageable. \n\nPersonally beyond just the knowledge learned in school, the most important thing I took from Baylor was networking, whether that was with my classmates, career fairs, or just outside the school, networking is the single most valuable skill I learned at Baylor. It also makes it easier to network with other professionals (whether they went to Baylor or not) just by having a Baylor degree. \n\nI hope this helped.",

            "comment": "I just graduated from the 5-year accounting masters program. It was an amazing experience. I\u2019ve learned a ton and we have 100% job placement. \n\nStereotypically, accounting and finance are the \u201creal\u201d majors in the business school. The others you\u2019ll have a hard time finding a job, especially a well-paying one with opportunity for growth. Traditional finance track is to go into banking, which I have no interest in. Traditional track for accounting is to go into audit or corporate tax. Both can be interesting and fulfilling, and open you up to a ton of opportunity later. It\u2019s not as boring as you expect, there\u2019s lots of gray area and cool niche things like forensic accounting or mergers and acquisitions.\n\nManagement Information Systems is also an option. We joke \u201cit\u2019s computer science for kids with social skills,\u201d which is somewhat accurate. Job placement is slightly lower, but starting salary will be fairly higher. You stand a higher risk of getting siloed into tech support kind of stuff though. \n\nI used to think management was a joke. How can you teach someone to manage people? Turns out it\u2019s one of the coolest majors we have. I believe \u201coperations\u201d would be a better name. You learn about supply chains and stuff, which can be super interesting. \n\nI\u2019d avoid marketing unless it\u2019s a secondary major. Job placement is minimal. \n\nBusiness fellows are more of an honors society than a major. They\u2019re kind of the nerdy weird kids, but some people like it. They get to register first, which is a huge help. Imagine never having a crappy Professor. \n\nPro Sales is a crazy good program if you want to do sales. Just keep in mind, most people leave sales after a few years. It\u2019s high pressure, and it can become miserable quick. \n\nOur Econ department is pretty weak here. \n\nIn general, I\u2019d advise that they knock out as many classes as they can before they get here. AP Economics is an absolute lifesaver because it saves you from taking 6 hours from just one class in high school (most ap classes only count for 3). Have them take generals at their local community college in the summers. Things like English and history. They\u2019re easier, cheaper, and don\u2019t count toward your gpa (you just need to pass them). This frees up hours to do double major, which I highly recommend.\n\nThe school works where for the first two years you take general classes, then you pick a major and take classes in that major while you finish up generals. By generals I mean one marketing class, two accounting classes, one finance class, etc\u2026. If you can get all of those in in the first two years, you\u2019ll have tried everything before you decide on a major. That helps you make a more informed decision about what you want to do. For example, I probably would have doubled in supply chain and MIS if I had taken management before I declared accounting. \n\nJust my thoughts. Sorry that was a little scattered, I\u2019m typing on a phone in bed. Feel free to dm me with other questions. I can also call if they want to talk to someone in person. Best of luck to them!",

            "comment": "The other comments here are spot on! Lots of great information. I am currently a Business student here and I love it. I wanted to add some information about the Hankamer Scholars. It\u2019s a new program they created this past year. It basically cuts out some of the requirements from the first two years, so it fits into one year. This means you can declare your business major earlier. The flexibility of finishing your pre-business classes allows for double or triple major, early graduation, or a double major outside of the Business school. It\u2019s been a great experience and it is definitely worth looking into. There\u2019s also special sections of intro classes for them.",

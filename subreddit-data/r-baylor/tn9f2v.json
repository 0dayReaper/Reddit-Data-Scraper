    "postText": "If I drop that class I\u2019ll be at 10 credits this semester and 13 credits in progress. Would I still be considered as a full time student? Does the incomplete class still put me as a full time student? \n\nWithout the drop, I have completed 47 hours with 16 in progress so I am at 63 credits so Junior standing. With the drop, I\u2019ll be at 60 and that\u2019s still considered as a Junior at least according to Baylor website. Is that how registration works?",

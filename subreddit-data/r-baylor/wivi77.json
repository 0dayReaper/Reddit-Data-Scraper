    "postText": "hi, i\u2019m currently going into my senior year of high school and i\u2019ve retaken my SAT several times to achieve \u201cBaylor standards\u201d. However, with applications for the c/o 2027 freshly opened i do not have much time. I will be taking my SAT on aug. 27th and need to improve by at least 100 points. I\u2019ve been studying a lot over the past several months; however, i fear i may not achieve that goal. So, if anyone has any advice on how to improve SAT scores and study tips that helped that would be greatly appreciated. I truly need all the help i can get right now.",

            "comment": "baylor has a 70% acceptance rate if your SAT scores are too low you might to look elsewhere. Also just a heads up on average people tend to improve by about 75-100 points each time they take the SAT to a certain point so you could definitely get it up just continue working and you got this",

Khan Academy is helpful for the reading and writing, but I feel that getting a hang of those sections is made easier by doing practice exams and recognizing the anatomy of the questions themselves imo",

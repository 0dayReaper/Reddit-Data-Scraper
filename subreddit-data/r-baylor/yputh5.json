    "postText": "Hi! I'm considering applying for a professor position but I'm a bit put off by the statement of faith that needs to be part of my application materials. I'm a Christian and don't mind saying so, but writing an essay about it with the intention of getting a job feels a bit gross to me. \n\nAny other professors here have thoughts about this? Any student thoughts? Do students have to do a similar thing to attend?",

            "comment": "I'm a professor, hired five years ago.\n\nFor me, the benefit of a longer \"Statement of Faith\" (as opposed to a checkbox) was that it helped me flesh out my thinking about how I would serve students in a Christian university environment.\n\nAt all universities, there is a tension between teaching and research \u2014 some professors tend to focus more on one versus the other. Christian identity is the third wheel at Baylor, and a sizable fraction of students come to Baylor for exactly that. As with teaching and research, some professors focus on spiritual mentorship more than others. My field's subject matter (geology) is inherently less relational than something like social work, so there was a definite expectation that teaching and research would take priority. Even so, I think I have been able to serve students better by equipping myself for substantive discussions on topics like the age of the Earth, [paleoseismology of Amos 1:1](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL090947), etc. That's more or less what I discussed in the Statement of Faith.",

If you're a student and sent to a disciplinary hearing, this sort of stuff is open season, but you wouldn't believe who pays private school tuition and then says things that just don't fit.  People tried to tell me they were very fundamentalist, but in truth, I never saw it.

Be emotional.  Use first person.  Fundamentally, it's a very personal thing, so if you feel better discussing it in an academic tone, well.  Do that. \n\nBut my larger point is that Academia has created these sorts of requirements.  And this is the cultural norm of this academic group.   California uses a diversity statement that no sane person could explain,and it's straight down the path of an entry barrier used by totalitarian states.     \n\nUnless you're extreme, this requirement is not likely to exclude you for any reason.\n\nJust know that it's more bizarre in other state systems.",

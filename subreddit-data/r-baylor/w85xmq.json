            "comment": "HPhys lecture consists of Dr. Tandy pimping students at random, so go to class with the expectation that you will be called on. He may seem like a terrifying presence in class, but he appreciates the students that participate in his pedagogical method of Socratic discussions. Personally, flashcards were helpful for me, but is generally dissuaded. A 96% average exempts you from the final, which is really helpful. \n\nTake Jonklaas for Biochem. By far the best prof.",

            "comment": "Biochem 1 is not bad at all. Get ready for a lot of memorization, and also plenty of calculations. The calculations aren't bad, I would say they are around Gen Chem level, but if you're not careful they can trip you up. \n\nThe big thing, imo, for Biochem is that you really want to understand why things happen, not just that they do. You'll do an entire section on Hemoglobin and Myoglobin, and how they work. Instead of just trying to remember what they do, think about the reasons behind it. For example, hemoglobin needs high affinity for O2 in the lungs, and lower affinity in the bloodstream near your cells. Instead of just memorizing this, you want to think about why it makes sense. You need to get O2 in the lungs, and not retain it near oxygen depleted cells. You'll have a lot of things like this, where it is much better to think of the why behind your body's science, not just what happens.",

            "comment": "Hphys is hard cuz theres a lot of content. You'll basically just have to memorize the material to ace the test. The questions are not predictable so you really have to know your stuff, but you'll feel like a mini doctor if you do well in that class. I didn't think biochem 1 was very hard. It was more conceptual and the topics were fun enough to make it not seem like a chore. Biochem 2 is back to memorization though. I think the teachers will make the biggest difference so ask around and see which one you'd fit with best.",

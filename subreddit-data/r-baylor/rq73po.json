However, I realized that once you surround yourself with a couple of Asian students, you'll be able to find more and they'll just keep popping up constantly. I would recommend that you join one of the Asian student organizations because that's how I was able to find my fellow Asian students. From there, the connection builds up (extending farther out onto the other Asian student organizations from other colleges, where you can build even more connections), and they don't seem as small anymore.",

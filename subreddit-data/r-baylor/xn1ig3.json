This was a hard-fought and hard-won game. Don't let any salty ISU fans fool you, the officiating was terrible *for both clubs* and Baylor clearly played the better game. As Baylor hasn't won in Ames since 2016 (thanks /u/cckike!), this was a big win.\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** Officiating. Now look, I try to be fair when I address officiating, but let's be clear: the early targeting call on Freyler was soft *at best*. That said, the officials did make some particularly crappy calls against Baylor as well. No one likes to watch ref-ball, no matter which way the calls are going.\t\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* It's a hard pick today, but I have to give it to Blake Shapen today. After a couple of shaky outings at BYU and against Texas State, Shapen came out and looked like a different person today. He was 19 of 26 for 238 yards through the air, throwing for 3 touchdowns. More than that, he handled significant pressure from the Cyclones with seeming ease, getting 1st downs on several plays that looked like they were busted *way* in the backfield. GG Shapen!\n * *Defense:* If you watched the game for longer than 10 minutes you saw some kind of big play from Bryson Jackson. TWO (2!) sacks on Hunter Dekkers, and another 2 tackles for loss. And the sacks could not have come at better times in the game for Baylor's momentum. Have a game, Bryson!\n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Y'all, I love trickeration plays. Especially with some of the conservative nature of our offense in the last couple of games, it was great to see the offense pull off a double-reverse flea flicker that culminated with Shapen throwing an absolute *nuke* of a pass to a wide-open Gavin Holmes for 38 yards and 6 points. If you didn't see this play, it's worth looking up the replay. \n * *Defense:* The best defensive play on the day came from Devin Neal (and about 3 other Bears) at 14:21 in the 3rd quarter. With ISU driving to swing momentum back their way, Hunter Dekkers tried to thread the defense with a pass over the middle, and after contact with several Bears Neal found himself in the right place to make the interception. Took the wind all the way out of the Cyclones (ironic) and really shook Dekkers.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** Baylor may not be a top 10 team, but we're definitely better than 17th! In a loud and rowdy stadium (especially after the first few officiating calls), Baylor stayed calm and collected and pulled out a road win. It's not the most impressive, but it's nothing to sneeze at either. Additionally, we learned Coach Aranda *can* get excited! Cameras spotted the coaches playing a couple rounds of slap-ass after a Baylor touchdown, with Aranda as the emcee!\n\n* **Next Week:** Baylor is back in Wacotown to welcome the Cowboys of Oklahoma State (and hopefully show them the way back home in short order)! \n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** Uh... umm... This is awkward. [It's me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xlbe7g/football_pickem_clones_or_clowns_edition_%C2%B9%E2%81%B7/ipim5te/) I normally do congratulations here, but that seems awkward. What do I normally do with my hands here?\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add? Comments? Concerns? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks, and sic' em Bears!*",

It was odd to be on the end of some beneficial calls. I've been a Baylor fan for a long time &amp; they tend to go the other way, IMO.\n\nThat said, it was a nice W for the team. Shapen looked much better &amp; therefore so did the offense. The D was solid as always, which is another thing I am loving about Baylor football.",

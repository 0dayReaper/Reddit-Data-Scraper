It\u2019d help with further education, but even then it isn\u2019t worth totally breaking your back over. Remember your worth isn\u2019t determined by your grades.",

I grinder during the week and got ahead of work so I could party as hard as I studied. By dedicating 50+ hours a week to school and work, the grades followed suit. The higher grades aren\u2019t always easy, but effort is step one. Then, the rest should come naturally.",

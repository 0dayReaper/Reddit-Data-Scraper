            "comment": "Upper level classes in the cell and molecular concentration are going to be much more relevant in med school. Immunology, anatomy, histo, etc. are all high-yield topics encountered in preclinical years. Your future self will be thankful you took the classes in undergrad. \n\nIf you're super interested in ecology and global ecosystems, go ahead dude. I personally can't see myself enjoying \"Plant Anatomy\" or \"Limnology\".",

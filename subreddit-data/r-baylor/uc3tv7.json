    "postText": "I know that we were supposed to take that exam so we could be placed in a math course, but tbh, I forgot to do it. In the end, they put me in an Ideas in Mathematics class for my math credit and it was the easiest class I had ever taken.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\u2019t take the test. You definitely should so you can get out of paying a crap ton of money for a math class that you could have just skipped, but it wasn\u2019t a career-ending mistake for me.",

            "comment": "The test is only for people who did not score high enough on the SAT ACT math sections. You only need the ALEKS for testing into pre calc or calc. For most majors, you can just take a different math class like OP that\u2019s much easier and satisfies university credit. The ALEKS is really only for premed or engineering type kids who didn\u2019t score so well. But yeah, advisors push for anything. Don\u2019t trust em",

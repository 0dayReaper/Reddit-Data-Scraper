Might be cool, especially if it\u2019s not at Baylor prices and if you don\u2019t need to learn how to study. \n\nPure speculation follows:\n\nIt sounds to me like admissions has reached their growth numbers for incoming freshman and are deferring people for a semester/year.\nOr, they are not confident in your grades/scores and want to see how you do at the college level. Kind of similar to the CAP system at UT. \n\nFrom the people that I know that are graduating soon and personal experience, the campus has exploded with people in the past 2-4 years and Baylor is slowly making moves to become more selective in their admissions.",

Admissions programs like this are a (sorta) new trend to fudge data used in rankings.\n\nStudents that get accepted into these programs typically fall into two categories: lower than average scores or other quantitative metrics and/or it's unclear how likely they are to actually accept an offer of admission. Both of these 'hurt' schools in rankings.\n\nSince the students are 'transfer students,' they're measured entirely differently than the 'actual' freshman class. If they decline the program, have lower GPAs, end up dropping out or take longer than 6 years to graduate, the college is essentially 'protected' from it impacting the more important ranking categories.\n\nThat said, the programs aren't necessarily all bad. It gives students a chance to study abroad, or to gain admission to a school that would have otherwise rejected them.",

Either they think your stats will hurt them in the rankings or they think you're just using them as a safety and wanna potentially entice you but not hurt themselves in rankings in case you ain't interested. Honestly, kinda hard to say which of the two Baylor is using the program for but maybe your stats or any aid can give some insight if you don't mind posting them. However, a lot of universities use some form of this so it's nothing new.",

Unfortunately due to covid I wasn't able to submit my SAT scores...but that was optional and wasn't a problem from any of the other colleges I applied to. I have a 3.9 GPA (unweighted), have taken exclusively AP/pre-ap or honors classes, am in the top 6% of my class, and have a 4 average after taking 5 AP exams at the time of my application (so I'm a national ap scholar)...but I will have taken a total of 11 AP classes by the end of this year.\n I am in NHS, Student Council, advanced art, and have a lot of volunteer hours from a local hospital. I have been accepted to all the auto admit schools (for top 10%) as well as SMU, southwestern, and Trinity University (and a few others which I won't detail because they were safety schools).\n With Baylors high acceptance rate its shocking to me that I got into statistically more competitive schools but not Baylor. I'm not too broken up about it as I already confirmed my attendance to Trinity last month (they offered me a significant scholorship), more so just confused on how I was rejected.",
